GUIDEWIRE STRUCTURE<br>
[0001]    Cross Reference to Related Patent Applications<br>
[0002]    This patent application claims priority of US Provisional Application Serial No. 60/571,026 filed May 14, 2004 and US Provisional Application Serial No. 60/571,118 filed May 14,2004, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0003]    This patent application incorporates by reference: US Patent Application Publication 2004/0111019 published June 10, 2004; US Patent Application Publication 2004/0111020 published June 10, 2004; US Patent Application Publication 2004/0199087 published October 7, 2004; US Patent Application Publication 2004/0199088 published October 7,2004; and US Patent Application Publication 2004/0230096 published November 18,2004.<br>
[0004]    Field of the Invention<br>
[0005]    The present invention is related generally to guidewire structures, and more particularly to a medical guidewire.<br>
[0006]    Background of the Invention<br>
[0007]    A physician typically accesses and visualizes tissue within a patient's gastrointestinal (GI) tract with a long, flexible endoscope. For the upper GI, a physician may insert a gastroscope into the sedated patient's mouth to examine and treat tissue in the esophagus, stomach, and proximal duodenum. For the lower GI, a physician may insert a colonoscope through the sedated patient's anus to examine the rectum and colon. Some endoscopes have a working channel, typically about 2.5-3.5 millimeters in diameter, extending from a port in the handpiece to the distal portion of the flexible insertion tube. A physician may insert medical devices into the working channel to help diagnose or treat tissues within the patient. Physicians commonly take tissue biopsies from the mucosal lining of the GI tract using a flexible, biopsy forceps through the working channel of the endoscope.<br>
[0008]    Insertion of a flexible endoscope, especially into the colon, can be a very time-consuming and uncomfortable procedure for the patient, even when the patient is sedated<br><br>
WO 2005/113053	PCT/US2005/016761<br>
2<br>
with drags. A physician often needs several minutes to push a flexible endoscope through the convoluted sigmoid, and the descending, transverse, and ascending portions of the colon. The physician may diagnose and/or treat tissues within the colon either during insertion or removal of the endoscope. The flexible endoscope may "loop" within the colon, such as at the sigmoid colon or at the splenic flexure of the colon, so that it becomes difficult to further advance the endoscope along the colon. When a loop is formed, the force exerted to push the scope stretches the mesentery and causes pain for the patient. Depending on the anatomy of the patient and the skill of the physician in manipulating the flexible endoscope, some portions of the colon may be unexamined, thus increasing the risk of undiagnosed disease.<br>
[0009]    Guidewires have been used to aid the introduction of catheters and other instruments into many sites in the human body. Many medical applications and specific designs of guidewires have been for cardiovascular use. There are, however, specific challenges relating to the use of guidewires in the GI tract, as opposed to the vascular system. Thus, the bowel is more tortuous, softer and generally of larger diameter. Furthermore, in the case of the small intestine and the colon, these are longer than most arteries or veins.<br>
[0010]    Still, scientists and engineers continue to seek improved medical guidewires. [0011]    Summary<br>
[0012]    A first embodiment of a guidewire structure of the invention includes a medical guidewire. The medical guidewire includes a working portion which is extendable as a loop track beyond a distal end of a medical instrument. The working portion has a maximum loop-track length and includes first and second segments together having a length greater than ninety percent of the maximum loop-track length. The first segment has a first bending moment of inertia and the second segment has a second bending moment of inertia. The first bending moment of inertia is less than the second bending moment of inertia.<br>
[0013]    A second embodiment of a guidewire structure of the invention includes a medical guidewire. The medical guidewire includes a working portion which is extendable as a loop track beyond a distal end of a medical instrument having a mechanized guidewire drive assembly. The working portion includes an exterior surface having a repetitive series of<br><br>
WO 2005/113053	PCT7US2005/016761<br>
3<br>
spaced-apart surface elevation features adapted for operable engagement with the mechanized guidewire drive assembly.<br>
[0014]    An alternate first embodiment of a guidewire structure of the invention includes a medical guidewire. The medical guidewire is extendable beyond a distal end of a medical instrument. The medical guidewire includes first and second segments, wherein the first segment has a first bending moment of inertia and the second segment has a second bending moment of inertia, and wherein the first bending moment of inertia is less than the second bending moment of inertia. The first segment has a free end which extends beyond the distal end of the medical instrument when the medical guidewire is fully extended.<br>
[0015]    An alternate second embodiment of a guidewire structure of the invention includes a medical guidewire. The medical guidewire is extendable beyond a distal end of a medical instrument having a mechanized guidewire drive assembly. The medical guidewire includes an exterior surface having a repetitive series of spaced-apart surface elevation features adapted for operable engagement with the mechanized guidewire drive assembly. The medical guidewire has a free end which extends beyond the distal end of the medical instrument when the medical guidewire is fully extended.<br>
[0016]    Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the embodiments of the invention. In one application, having a loop-track or non-loop-track guidewire including a first segment having a bending moment of inertia less than that of a second segment allows easier extension of the first segment in a body lumen of a patient followed by easier extension and temporary anchoring of the second segment and easier advancement of the medical instrument, as can be appreciated by the artisan. In the same or a different application, having a loop-track or non-loop-track guidewire including an exterior surface having a repetitive series of spaced-apart surface elevation features, such as external threads, allows operable engagement thereof with a mechanized guidewire drive assembly for improved guidewire extension and medical instrument advancement, as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In one employment which utilizes a mechanized guidewire drive assembly, when the surface-elevation-feature engaging component of the mechanized guidewire drive assembly is located proximate the distal end of the catheter (insertion tube)<br><br>

4<br>
of a flexible endoscope, there is less tendency for the catheter to "loop" within the colon and cause pain to the patient during a colonoscopy.<br>

[0045]    Detailed Description<br>
[0046]    Before explaining the several embodiments of the present invention in detail, it should be noted that each embodiment is not limited in its application or use to the details of construction and arrangement of parts and steps illustrated in the accompanying drawings and description. The illustrative embodiments of the invention may be implemented or incorporated in other embodiments, variations and modifications, and may be practiced or carried out in various ways. Furthermore, unless otherwise indicated, the terms and expressions employed herein have been chosen for the purpose of describing the illustrative embodiments of the present invention for the convenience of the reader and are not for the purpose of limiting the invention.<br>
[0047]    It is further understood that any one or more of the following-described expressions, embodiments, examples, etc. can be combined with any one or more of the other following-described expressions, embodiments, examples, etc.<br>
[0048]    Guidewire Structure<br>
[0049]    A first aspect of the invention is directed to a guidewire structure. A first embodiment of a guidewire structure 10 of the invention is shown in Figures 1-2 and includes a medical guidewire 12. The medical guidewire 12 includes a working portion 14 which is extendable as a loop track beyond a distal end 16 of a medical instrument 18. The working portion 14 has a maximum loop-track length and includes first and second segments 20 and 22 together having a length greater than ninety percent of the maximum loop-track length. The first segment 20 has a first bending moment of inertia and the second segment 22 has a second bending moment of inertia. The first bending moment of inertia is less than the second bending moment of inertia. It is noted that describing the first bending moment of inertia as less than the second bending moment of inertia is equivalent to describing the first segment 20 as being more flexible than the second segment 22.<br><br>
WO 2005/113053	PCT/US2005/016761<br>
8<br>
[0050]    It is noted that the term "segments" means non-overlapping segments. It is also noted that the length of the loop track is the distance along the loop track from where the first segment 20 begins to extend beyond the distal end 16 of the medical instrument 18 to where the second segment 22 begins to extend beyond the distal end 16 of the medical instrument 18. It is further noted that when the working portion 14 is not fully extended as a loop track beyond the distal end 16 of the medical instrument 18, the length of the loop track extending beyond the distal end 16 of the medical instrument 18 is less than the maximum loop-track length.<br>
[0051]    The medical guidewire 12 is adapted to guide the medical instrument 18. In one variation, the medical guidewire 12 is adapted to guide a flexible catheter (also known as a flexible insertion tube) 24 of the medical instrument 18. In one modification, the first and/or second segments 20 and/or 22 are disposed to extend beyond the distal end 16 of the catheter 24 from passageways inside the catheter 24. In one illustration, not shown, the first and second segments 20 and 22 extend from the same passageway. In a different modification, not shown, the first and/or second segments are disposed to extend beyond the distal end of the catheter from outside the exterior surface of the catheter with the second or both of the segments engaged by guide ways on the exterior surface of the catheter. Other modifications are left to the artisan. Examples of catheters include, without limitation, cardio-vascular catheters, pulmonary catheters, and insertion tubes of endoscopes such as insertion tubes of gastroscopes and colonoscopes. In one enablement of the embodiment of Figures 1-2, the working portion 14 is adapted for patient intralummal contact. Examples of body lumens of a patient include, without limitation, the upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract, the lower GI tract, and blood vessel passageways. Other examples of medical instruments 18, catheters 24, and/or body lumens are left to the artisan.<br>
[0052]    In one construction of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 1-2, the first segment 20 and the second segment 22 have substantially the same material composition, wherein the first segment 20 has a substantially-constant first diameter, wherein the second segment 22 has a substantially-constant second diameter, and wherein the first diameter is less than the second diameter. In one variation, the working portion 14 includes a third segment 26 extending from the second segment 22 to the first segment 20. The third segment 26 has a length and has a varying third diameter which is substantially equal to the second diameter<br><br>
WO 2005/113053	PCT/US2005/016761<br>
9<br>
proximate the second segment 22 and which is substantially equal to the first diameter proximate the first segment 20. In one modification, the varying third diameter of the third segment 26 substantially linearly decreases from proximate the second segment 22 to proximate the first segment 20. In a different modification, the third diameter of the third segment 26 is less than the first and second diameters except proximate the first and second segments 20 and 22.<br>
[0053]    In one employment of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 1-2, the working portion 14 includes a lubricious sleeve 28 surrounding the first segment 20. The sleeve 16 creates a low friction surface for easy passage through a body lumen of a (human or non-human) patient. Examples of materials for the sleeve 28 include, without limitation, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), such as Striped Teflon(r) PTFE available from Zeus, Inc (Orangeburg, SC). In one method, the sleeve 28 is applied over the first segment 20 through a heat-shrink process well known in the art. In one variation, the working portion 14, apart from the sleeve 28 (or apart from any sleeve), is monolithic.<br>
[0054]    In one illustration of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 1-2, the working portion 14, apart from any sleeve, is made of a super-elastic alloy such as nitinol available from Nitinol Devices &amp; Components (Fremont, CA) and has a suitable diameter for insertion into a body lumen of a patient. In one example, the first segment 20 has a length of over 1 meter and a diameter of substantially 0.46 millimeter, the second segment 22 has a length of over 1 meter and a diameter of substantially 0.76 millimeter, the third segment 26 has a length of substantially 0.08 meter, and the sleeve 28 has a wall thickness of substantially 0.11 millimeter. Other dimensional choices are left to the artisan.<br>
[0055]    One technique for using the guidewire structure 10 of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 1-2 includes inserting the first segment 20 into a first guidewire passageway of the catheter 24 from the distal end 16 and inserting the second segment 22 into a second guidewire passageway of the catheter 24 from the distal end 16. Then, with the working portion 14 extended a minimum distance beyond the distal end 16 of the catheter 24, the catheter 24 is manually inserted an initial distance into a body lumen of a patient. Then, a first guidewire leg 12' leading to the first segment 20 is manually pushed from outside the patient to extend at least some of the first segment 20 beyond the distal end 16 of the catheter<br><br>
WO 2005/113053	PCT/US2005/016761<br>
10<br>
24. Then, a second guidewire leg 12" leading to the second segment 22 is pushed from outside the patient to extend at least some of the second segment 22 beyond the distal end 16 of the catheter 24 and to temporarily anchor the second segment 22 against the wall of the body lumen. Then, the first segment 20 is immobilized with respect to the catheter 24 (by the clinician or by the use of a surgical clamp, spring clamp, or collet) and the catheter 24 is manually pushed a further distance into the body lumen while manually pulling on the second guidewire leg 12" from outside the patient to retract at least some of the second segment 22. The last two steps (described in the previous two sentences) are repeated as necessary to fully insert the catheter 24 into the body lumen.<br>
[0056]    In one example, not shown, of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 1-2, the medical guidewire includes surface elevation features to improve the temporary anchoring of the medical guidewire against the wall of the body lumen. In one variation, the surface elevation features are present on then second segment and are absent from the first segment. In the same or a different variation, the surface elevation features are external threads.<br>
[0057]      A second embodiment of a guidewire structure 110 of the invention is shown in Figures 3-5. A first expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5 is for a guidewire structure 110 including a medical guidewire 112. The medical guidewire 112 includes a working portion 114 which is extendable as a loop track beyond a distal end 116 of a medical instrument 118 having a mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130. The working portion 114 includes an exterior surface 132 having a repetitive series of spaced-apart surface elevation features 134 adapted for operable engagement with the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130.<br>
[0058]    In one arrangement of the first expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5, the working portion 114 includes first and second segments 120 and 122, and the surface elevation features 134 are present on the second segment 122 and are absent from the first segment 120. In one variation, the surface elevation features 134 are chosen from the group consisting of periodic threads (also called external threads 136), periodic teeth, periodic holes, and periodic grooves. In the same or a different arrangement, the working portion 114 has a maximum loop-track length, wherein the first and second segments 120 and 122 together have a length greater than ninety percent of the maximum loop-track length, wherein<br><br>
WO 2005/113053	PCT/US2005/016761<br>
11<br>
the first segment 120 has a first bending moment of inertia and the second segment 122 has a second bending moment of inertia, and wherein the first bending moment of inertia is less than the second bending moment of inertia.<br>
[0059]    A second expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5 is for a guidewire structure 110 including a medical guidewire 112. The medical guidewire 112 includes a working portion 114 which is extendable as a loop track beyond a distal end 116 of a medical instrument 118 having a mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130. The working portion 114 includes an exterior surface 132 having external threads 136 adapted for operable engagement with the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130.<br>
[0060]    It is noted that the arrangements previously described for the first expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5 are equally applicable to the second expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5 with external threads 136 being the surface elevation feature 134. In one enablement of the second expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5, the working portion 114 is adapted for patient inrraluminal contact. In one example, the medical instrument 118 is a colonoscope which includes a flexible insertion tube (also known as a flexible catheter) 124, and the distal end 116 of the medical instrument 118 is the distal end of the flexible insertion tube 124 of the colonoscope. Figure 5 shows the working portion 114 of the medical guidewire 112 disposed in the colon 138 of a patient during a colonoscopy. In one variation, not shown in Figures 3-5, the insertion tube 124 includes an imager, a light pathway, and at least one medical-device passageway (i.e., working channel) for inserting a medical device, such as a wire snare to biopsy a polyp during a colonoscopy.<br>
[0061]    In one employment of the second expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5, the working portion 114 includes a lubricious sleeve 128 surrounding only the first segment 120. In one variation, the working portion 114, apart from the sleeve 128, consists essentially of a nickel-titanium alloy. In one application, the nickel-titanium alloy is nitinol.<br>
[0062]    In one construction of the second expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figure 3-5, the first segment 120 and the second segment 122 have substantially the same material<br><br>

WO2005/113053<br>
12<br>
composition, wherein the first segment 120 has a substantially-constant first diameter, wherein the second segment 122, without considering the external threads 136, has a substantially-constant second diameter, and wherein the first diameter is less than the second diameter. In one variation, the working portion 114 includes a third segment 126 extending from the second segment 122 to the first segment 120, wherein the third segment 126 has a length and has a varying third diameter which is substantially equal to the second diameter proximate the second segment 122 and .which is substantially equal to the first diameter proximate the first segment 120. In one modification, the third diameter of the third segment 126 substantially linearly decreases from proximate the second segment 122 to proximate the first segment. In a different modification, the third diameter of the third segment 126 is less than the first and second diameters except proximate the first and second segments 120 and 122.<br>
[0063]    A first method for making the guidewirc structure 110 of the second expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5 includes steps a) through e). Step a) includes obtaining a monolithic core wire having a diameter. Step b) includes machining the core wire to create a first section, a second section, and a transition section extending from the second section to the first section, wherein the first and second sections each have a substantially constant diameter, and wherein the first diameter is less than the second diameter. Step c) includes obtaining a helical spring. Step d) includes disposing the helical spring to surround the second section. Step e) includes metallurgically attaching the helical spring to the second section, wherein the first section substantially defines the first segment 120 apart from any sleeve 128, and wherein the second section with the metallurgically-attached helical spring substantially defines fee second segment 122.<br>
[0064]    In one enablement of the first method, step e) is chosen from the group consisting of soldering and laser welding. In the first method, the metailurgically-attached helical spring defines the external threads 136. In the same or a different enablement, the helical spring is a njtinoi helical spring having a diameter of between 0.13 millimeter and 0.51 millimeter (and in one construction substantially 0.30 millimeter). In one variation, the external threads 136 have a constant spacing of 40 threads per inch, determining a 0.025 inch pitch, for a fine-pitch application or have a constant spacing of 10 threads per inch, determining a 0,10 inch<br><br>
WO 2005/113053	PCT/US2005/016761<br>
13<br>
pitch, for a coarse-pitch application. In another variation, the external threads 136 have a spacing which varies over the length of the second segment 122.<br>
[0065]    A second method for making the guidewire structure 110 of the second expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5 includes steps a) and b). Step a) includes obtaining a monolithic core wire. Step b) includes machining the core wire to create the first segment 120, apart from any sleeve 128, and to create the second segment 122 including the external threads 136.<br>
[0066]    One technique for using the guidewire structure 110 of the second expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5 includes inserting the first segment 120 into a first guidewire passageway of the catheter 124 from the distal end 116 and inserting the second segment 122 into a second guidewire passageway of the catheter 124 from the distal end 116 to engage the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130. Then, with the working portion 114 extended a minimum distance beyond the distal end 116 of the catheter 124, the catheter 124 is manually inserted an initial distance into a body lumen of a patient. Then, a first guidewire leg 112' leading to the first segment 120 is manually pushed from outside the patient to extend at least some of the first segment 120 beyond the distal end 116 of the catheter 124. Then, the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130 is used to push the second segment 122 to extend at least some of the second segment 122 beyond the distal end 116 of the catheter 124 and to temporarily anchor the second segment 122 against the wall of the body lumen. Then, the catheter 124 is manually pushed a further distance into the body lumen while the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130 is used to pull on the second segment 122 to retract at least some of the second segment 122 into the catheter 124. The last two steps are repeated as necessary to fully insert the catheter 124 into the body lumen.<br>
[0067]    An alternate first embodiment of a guidewire structure 210 is shown in Figure 6 and includes a medical guidewire 212. The medical guidewire 212 is extendable beyond a distal end 216 of a medical instrument 218. The medical guidewire 212 includes first and second segments 220 and 222, wherein the first segment 220 has a first bending moment of inertia and the second segment 222 has a second bending moment of inertia, and wherein the first bending moment of inertia is less than the second bending moment of inertia. The first segment 220 has a free end 221 which extends beyond the distal end 216 of the medical<br><br>
WO 2005/113053	PCT/US2005/016761<br>
14<br>
instrument 218 when the medical guidewire 212 is fully extended. It is noted that such fee end 221 makes the medical guidewire 212 a non-loop-track medical guidewire.<br>
[0068]    In one application of the guidewire structure 210 of Figure 6, the anchoring generally comes from the first segment 220 folding back and having the second segment 222 begin to fold back. In one variation, the portion of the medical guidewire 212 which can extend beyond the distal end 216 of the catheter 224 has a long length. In one example, the first segment 220 has a length between 50 millimeters and 1 meter and has a diameter of substantially 0.25 millimeter, the second segment 222 has a length over 1 meter and has a diameter of substantially 0.76 millimeter, and the third segment 226 has a length of substantially 0.08 meter.<br>
[0069]    One technique for using the guidewire structure 210 of Figure 6 includes inserting the first guidewire segment 220 into a guidewire passageway of the catheter 224 from the proximal end 217. Further advancement of the guidewire structure 210 will result in advancement of the second guidewire segment 222 into the same guidewire passageway from the proximal end 217. The catheter 224 is manually inserted into a body lumen of a patient. Then, the second guidewire portion 222 is manually advanced from the proximal end 217 outside the patient to extend the first segment 220 and at least a portion of the second segment 222 beyond the distal end 216 of the catheter 224 to temporarily anchor the second segment 222 against the wall of the body lumen. Then, the catheter 224 is manually pushed a further distance into the body lumen while manually pulling on the second segment 222 from outside the patient. The last two steps are repeated as necessary to fully insert the catheter 224 into the body lumen.<br>
[0070]    An alternate second embodiment of a guidewire structure is shown in Figure 7. A first expression of the guidewire structure 310 of Figure 7 includes a medical guidewire 312 which is extendable beyond a distal end 316 of a medical instrument 318 having a mechanized guidewire drive assembly 330. The medical guidewire 312 includes an exterior surface 332 having a repetitive series of spaced-apart surface elevation features 334 adapted for operable engagement with the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 330. The medical guidewire 312 has a free end 321 which extends beyond the distal end 316 of the medical<br><br>

15<br>
instrument 318 when the medical guidewire 312 is fully extended. It is noted that such fee end 321 makes the medical guidewire 312 a non-loop-track medical guidewire.<br>
[0071]    A second expression of the guidewire structure 310 of Figure 7 includes a medical guidewire 312 which is extendable beyond a distal end 316 of a medical instrument 318 having a mechanized guidewire drive assembly 330. The medical guidewire 312 includes an exterior surface 332 having external threads 336 adapted for operable engagement with the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 330. The medical guidewire 312 has a free end 321 which extends beyond the distal end 316 of the medical instrument 318 when the medical guidewire 312 is fully extended.<br>
[0072]    In one application of the second expression of the guidewire structure 310 of Figure 7, the external threads 336 themselves act to anchor the medical guidewire 312 when the external threads 336 are disposed along the wall of the body lumen, independent of any medical-guidewire fold back and especially when the external threads 336 extend far into the body lumen from the distal end 316 of the medical instrument 318. In one example, the first segment 320 has a length between 50 millimeters and 1 meter and has a diameter of substantially 0.25 millimeter, the second segment 322 has a length over 1 meter and has a diameter of substantially 0.76 millimeter, and the third segment 326 has a length of substantially 0.08 meter.<br>
[0073]    One technique for using the second expression of the guidewire structure 310 of Figure 7 includes inserting the second segment 322 into a guidewire passageway of catheter 324 from the distal end 316 to engage a mechanized guidewire assembly 330. In one variation, the mechanized drive assembly 330 is used to draw all of the guidewire structure 310, including second segment 322 and first segment 320, within the catheter 324. A second guidewire passageway, if present, of the catheter 324 is left completely open for other accessories. Then, the mechanized guidewire assembly 330 is used to push the first segment 320 and a portion of the second segment 322 to extend beyond the distal end 316 of the catheter 324 into the body lumen and to temporarily anchor the second segment 322 against the wall of the body lumen. Then, the catheter 324 is manually pushed a further distance into the body lumen while the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 330 is used to pull on the<br><br>

second segment 322 to retract at least some of second segment 322 into the catheter 324. The last two steps are repeated as necessary to fully insert the catheter 324 into the body lumen.<br>

The working portion 14 has a maximum loop-track length and includes first and second segments 20 and 22 together having a length greater than ninety percent of the maximum loop-track length. The first segment 20 has a first bending moment of inertia and the second segment 22 has a second bending moment of inertia. The first bending moment of inertia is less than the second bending moment of inertia. In one example, the catheter 24 is an insertion tube of a flexible endoscope (with the endoscope imager, working channel, etc. omitted from Figures 1-2 for clarity).<br>
[0076]    A method for operating the medical instrument 18 of the medical-instrument embodiment of Figures 1-2 is now described, wherein the medical guidewire 12 includes a first guidewire leg 12' having a free end disposed outside the patient and leading to the first segment 20 and includes a second guidewire leg 12" having a free end disposed outside the patient and leading to the second segment 22. The method includes steps a) through d). Step a) includes manually inserting the distal end 16 of the catheter 24 an initial distance into the body lumen of the patient. Step b) includes manually pushing the first guidewire leg 12' to extend at least some of the first segment 20 beyond the distal end 16 of the catheter 24. Step c) includes manually pushing the second guidewire leg 12" to extend at least some of the second segment 22 beyond the distal end 16 of the catheter 24 and to temporarily anchor the second segment 22 against a wall of the body lumen. Step d) includes immobilizing the first guidewire leg 12' with respect to the catheter 24 and manually pushing the catheter 24 a further distance into the body lumen while manually pulling on the second guidewire leg 12" to retract at least some of the second segment 22. In one extension of the method, steps c) and d) are repeated.<br><br>

[0077]    A second embodiment of a medical instrument 118 of the invention is shown in Figures 3-5 and 8-11. A first expression of the medical-instrument embodiment of Figures 3-5 and 8-11 is for a medical instrument 118 including a flexible catheter 124, a mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130, and a medical guidewire 112. The catheter 124 has a distal end 116 insertable into a body lumen of a patient. The medical guidewire 112 includes a working portion 114 which is extendable as a loop track beyond the distal end 116 of the catheter 124. The working portion 114 includes an exterior surface 132 having a repetitive series of spaced-apart surface elevation features 134 adapted for operable engagement with the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130.<br>
[0078]    In one arrangement of the first expression of the medical-instrument embodiment of Figures 3-5 and 8-11, the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130 includes a surface-elevation-feature engaging component 140 disposed within the catheter 124 toward the distal end 116 of the catheter 124. "Toward the distal end" means closer to the distal end than to the proximal end. Examples of surface-elevation-feature engaging components include, without limitation, a nut gear 142, a worm gear, a spoke gear, etc. It is noted that the previously-described arrangements, variations, etc. of the first expression of the guidewire embodiment of Figures 3-5 are equally applicable to the first expression of the medical-instrument embodiment of Figures 3-5 and 8-11.<br>
[0079]    A second expression of the medical-instrument embodiment of Figures 3-5 and 8-11 is for a medical instrument 118 including a flexible catheter 124, a mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130, and a medical guidewire 112. The catheter 124 has a distal end 116 insertable into a body lumen of a patient. The medical guidewire 112 includes a working portion 114 which is extendable as a loop track beyond the distal end 116 of the catheter 124. The working portion 114 includes an exterior surface 132 having external threads 136 adapted for operable engagement with the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130.<br>
[0080]    In a first construction of the second expression of the medical-instrument embodiment of Figures 3-5 and 8-11, the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130 includes a motor 144, a spur gear 146, and a nut gear 142. The motor 144 has a rotatable motor shaft 148, and the spur gear 146 is attached to the motor shaft 148. The nut gear 142 includes external teeth 150 which are engaged by the spur gear 146. The nut gear 142 includes<br><br>

18<br>
internal threads 152 which threadably engage the external threads 136 of the medical guidewire 112. The spur gear 146 and the nut gear 142 are disposed within the catheter 124.<br>
[0081]    In one variation of the first construction, the motor 144 is disposed within the catheter 124. In a different variation, not shown, the motor is disposed outside the proximal end of the catheter, wherein the motor shaft of the motor is a flexible motor shaft. In one modification, not shown, the motor is disposed in the handle of the medical instrument. In another modification, not shown, the motor is disposed in a console. Other motor locations are left to the artisan. In one application, the motor 144 is a rotary motor. In a different application, the mechanized guidewire drive assembly includes a linear motor.<br>
[0082]    In a second construction (not shown) of the second expression of the medical-instrument embodiment of Figures 3-5 and 8-11, the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130 does not include a motor but does include a non-motorized mechanism which the clinician uses to extend the medical guidewire. In one example, the non-motorized mechanism includes a hand crank which has a rotatable flexible output shaft leading to a gearbox operatively connectable to the medical guidewire. Other examples are left to the artisan.<br>
[0083]    In one enablement of the second expression of the medical-instrument embodiment of Figures 3-5 and 8-11, the working portion 114 includes first and second segments 120 and 122. The external threads 136 are present on the second segment 122 and are absent from the first segment 120. In one variation, the working portion 114 has a maximum loop-track length, wherein the first and second segments 120 and 122 together have a length greater than ninety percent of the maximum loop-track length. In this variation, the first segment 120 has a first bending moment of inertia and the second segment 122 has a second bending moment of inertia, wherein the first bending moment of inertia is less than the second bending moment of inertia. In one modification, the working portion 114 includes a third segment 126 extending from the second segment 122 to the first segment 120, wherein the third segment 126 has a length and has a varying third diameter. The varying third diameter is substantially equal to the second diameter proximate the second segment 122 and is substantially equal to the first diameter proximate the first segment 120. In one example, the internal threads 152 of the nut gear 142 are disposed a distance from the distal end 116 of the<br><br>
WO 2005/113053	PCT/US2005/01G761<br>
19<br>
catheter 124 substantially equal to the length of the third segment 126 of the working portion 114 of the medical guidewire 112.<br>
[0084]    In one deployment of the second expression of the medical-instrument embodiment of Figures 3-5 and 8-11, the catheter 124 is an insertion tube of a flexible endoscope (with the endoscope imager, working channel, etc. omitted from Figures 3-5 and 8-11 for clarity). In one variation, the working portion 114 includes a lubricious sleeve 128 surrounding only the first segment 120. In one choice of materials, the working portion 114, apart from the sleeve 128, consists essentially of a nickel-titanium alloy. In one application, the nickel-titanium alloy is nitinol.<br>
[0085]    This paragraph describes in more detail one configuration of an embodiment of the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130. As shown in Figure 8, the first segment 120 of the medical guidewire 112 is seen extending from the first guidewire passageway 154 within the catheter 124, and the second segment 122 of the medical guidewire 112 is seen extending from the second guidewire passageway 156 within the catheter 124. In this configuration, the catheter 124 includes a more rigid portion 158 (such as an injection molded polycarbonate or other plastic portion having two halves which fit together in a clamshell fashion) which houses the mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130 and which has stabilizing ribs 160 to constrain the motor 144. The medical instrument 118 also includes a lead 162 supplying power to the motor 144. In one example, the motor 144 is a miniature DC (direct current) motor such as Faulhaber motor model 0816-006 (available from MicroMo Electronics, Inc. of Clearwater, Florida) with a gearbox having a reduction ratio of 64:1. In this example, the spur gear 146 has 12 teeth, has a pitch diameter of 8 millimeters, and is supported on its non-motor side by a gear bearing 164. In this example, the nut gear 142 has 6 or 12 external teeth 150 and is linearly constrained by a pair of bosses 166. Thus, rotation and counter-rotation of the motor 144 results in extension and retraction of the second segment 122 of the medical guidewire 112. In one application, air is introduced into the body lumen through the first guidewire passageway 154 during a colonoscopy. In an alternate configuration, not shown, the spur gear is disposed between two universal joints which together are disposed between two smaller motors to provide a tighter bending radius for the catheter, as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Other configurations are left to the artisan.<br><br>

[0090]    Medical Instrument Having A Controlled Guidewire Feed<br>
[0091]    A third aspect of the invention is directed to a medical instrument having a controlled guidewire feed, a first embodiment of which is shown in Figures 3-4 and 12. A first expression of the embodiment of Figures 3-4 and 12 is for a medical instrument 118 including a flexible catheter 124, a medical guidewire 112, and a mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130. The catheter 124 has a distal end 116 insertable into a body lumen of a patient. The mechanized guidewire drive assembly 130 is adapted for operable engagement with the medical guidewire 112 to extend the medical guidewire 112 beyond the distal end 116 of the catheter 124.

[0093]    In one deployment of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 3-4 and 12, the motor 144 is a rotary motor which produces a torque in response to the driving force of the controller 168. In one variation, the motor 144 is a DC (direct current) motor, wherein the driving force is an electric current, wherein the torque is related to the electric current, wherein the predetermined upper limit is a predetermined electric-current upper limit, and wherein the controller 168 includes a current limiter 170 which limits the electric current to the predetermined electric-current upper limit. In one implementation, the predetermined electric-current upper limit is experimentally established from at least measurements of the torque of the DC motor and a comfort level of at least one patient undergoing at least one medical procedure using the medical instrument 118 without any predetermined electric-current upper limit.

The coupler also includes a plurality of O-rings which surround, and apply a pressure against, the finger projections. When the moving medical guidewire 412 encounters a threshold resistance, the hexagonal output shaft 481 stops rotating and the rotating finger projections slip over the corners of the hexagonal output shaft 481. When the resistance encountered by the medical guidewire 412 falls below the threshold resistance, the rotating finger projections stay on the flats of the hexagonal output shaft 481. In this way, this<br><br>

[00148]    Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the embodiments of the invention. In one application, having a loop-track or non-loop-track guidewire including a first segment having a bending moment of inertia less than that of a second segment allows easier extension of the first segment in a body lumen of a patient followed by easier extension and temporary anchoring of the second segment and easier advancement of the medical instrument, as can be appreciated by the artisan. In the same or a different application, having a loop-track or non-loop-track guidewire including an exterior surface having a repetitive series of spaced-apart surface elevation features, such as external threads, allows operable engagement thereof with a mechanized guidewire drive assembly for improved guidewire extension and medical instrument advancement, as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In one employment which utilizes a mechanized guidewire drive assembly, when the surface-elevation-feature engaging component of the mechanized guidewire drive assembly is located proximate the distal end of the catheter (insertion tube) of a flexible endoscope, there is less tendency for the catheter to "loop" within the colon and cause pain to the patient during a colonoscopy.<br>
