				<td>This invention relates to a pigments dispersion for the product ion of writing.<br>
        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
a)	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to dispersants for organic pigments (hereinafter simply referred to as "pigments") , pigment dispersions and writing or recording pigment inks, and more specifically to pigment dispersants and also to pigment dispersions making use of the pigment dispersants, having excellent fluidity, dispersion stability, storage stability and the like and suited especially for the production of writing or recording pigment inks.<br>
b)	Description of the Related Art<br>
Marking inks for use in writing instruments, which make use of bundled fiber tips or felt tips, have conventionally been made of resins, pigments and solvents, and as the pigments, dyes have been employed. As the solvents, ester or aromatic solvents have been used from the standpoint of solubility for the resins and also solubility for the dyes.<br>
It is however desired to avoid use of aromatic solvents, because they give deleterious effects on the health of workers (organic solvent intoxication) and<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
they themselves are air pollutants.  Although there is a move toward water-based writing inks, solvent-based maker pens are still employed widely.  This can be attributed to the excellent writing performance of solvent-based inks on plastic films such as polyethylene films and also to the superb drying characteristics of the solvent-based inks shortly after written on plastic films.<br>
Ink-jet printing, on the other hand, is a digital printing controlled by a computer.  Printing information signals are supplied to a printer directly from the computer, so that no plate-making is needed.  Ink-jet printing is therefore suited particularly for the printing of various images in small numbers of copies, and recent advancements in ink-jet printers have made it possible to perform printing of a variety of highly-detailed large images.<br>
Ink-jet printing inks are required to have low viscosity and excellent stability.  There are organic-solvent-based inks making use of dyes, but as pigment-type inks, water-based inks are used because ink-jet printing inks making use of pigments involve technical difficulties.  However, water-based inks contain, as vehicles, resins at extremely low concentrations so that good color developments are not available.  Water-<br><br>
-3  -<br>
based inks are also accompanied by a problem of adhesion to plastic films.  Under these circumstances, there is a strong desire for the development of alcohol-based ink-jet printing inks making use of pigments and assuring good color developments.<br>
Incidentally, as is observed from paints and the like, the conventional technology expects much on the dispersing power of a resin for a pigment upon dispersing the pigment on a resin solution. When the dispersing power of the resin is insufficient for the pigment, a pigment dispersant (pigment treatment) (hereinafter simply referred to as "a pigment dispersant) has been employed.  In general paints, sufficient dispersion of pigments is feasible with conventional dispersants.<br>
Compared with paints, however, writing or recording pigment inks are required to have extremely low viscosity and in addition, to have an extremely high degree of dispersion of pigments.  Despite these requirements, use of conventional resins and dispersants is unable to achieve sufficient dispersion of pigments or leads to changes in the viscosity of pigment dispersions along the passage of time due to desorption of the dispersant from the pigments and insufficient compatibility between the pigments and the resins, thereby making it extremely difficult to obtain pigment disper-<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
sions which meet the property and performance requirements .<br>
If an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol can be used as a solvent in an organic-solvent-based pigment ink, deleterious effects on the health of users of writing instruments and people studying or working in the same environment as the users can be reduced, the problem of air pollution can be lessened owing to the avoidance of an organic solvent, and further, the problems of drying characteristics and wetting to plastic films, said problems being inherent to water-based inks, can also be eliminated.  Moverover, alcoholic solvents are resources reproducible in the natural world so that use of such solvents is preferred.  Nonetheless, with resins soluble in conventionally-known alcoholic solvents, it is still extremely difficult to obtain pigment inks satisfactory in the requirements for low viscosity, high dispersion and high dispersion stability even if dispersants are used.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a dispersant which is excellent in the dis-persibility of pigments and permits production of a pigment dispersion excellent. in the stability of vis-<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
cosity.  Another object of the present invention is to provide a pigment dispersion, writing ink or recording ink, which is using a pigment as a coloring matter, contains a resin - which is soluble in an organic solvent, especially an alcoholic solvent - in a sufficient amount relative to the pigment, has a low viscosity, good pigment dispersibility and excellent viscosity stability, and gives less deleterious effects on the health of a user of a writing instrument or recording apparatus and people studying or working in the same environment as the user.<br>
To achieve the above-described objects, the present invention provides an dispersant for organic pigments, comprising a compound represented by the following formula (I):<br><br>

Conventionally-known organic solvents employed in various paints, coating formulations, printing inks and the like are all usable as organic solvents in the present invention.  When using inks according to the present invention as inks for writing instruments or recording apparatuses, use of alcoholic solvents is preferred.  As alcoholic solvents, solvents containing<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
alcohols the boiling points of which are 150°C or lower are preferred.  Alcohols amount to at least 10 wt.%, preferably to 50 to 100 wt.% of alcoholic solvents.<br>
Preferred examples of alcohols can include ethanol, propanol, methoxypropanol, ethoxypropanol, and propyloxyethanol.  They can be used either singly or in combination.  Solvents other than these alcohols can also be used to extents not contrary to the spirit of the present invention.  For example, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethyl-cyclohexane, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone and the like can be used in combination.<br>
The film-forming resin (hereinafter simply referred to as a "resin") employed in the present in-vention is required to be soluble in the above-described organic solvent, especially the alcoholic solvent descried above.  Such a resin comprises, as constituent monomers, an addition-polymerizing monomer containing a carboxyl group, a hydroxyl group or an amido group and a monomer addition-polymerizable with the addition-polymerizing monomer.  A description will hereinafter be made about the monomers which make up the resin for use in the present invention.<br>
Examples of the carboxyl-containing monomer can include acrylic acid and methacrylic acid; fumaric<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, alkyl monoesters thereof, and hydroxyalkyl monoesters thereof; and monoesters between hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, such as hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, and dibasic acids, for example, suc-cinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride and cyclohexane-dicarboxylic acid anhydride.  Incidentally, acrylic acid and methacryiic acid will be called (meth)acrylic acid in the present invention.<br>
Examples of the hydroxyl-containing monomer can include hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, for example, hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and hydropropyl (meth)acrylate; esters of monoesters between the above-described hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates and dibasic acids with dihydroxyalkyl compounds, for example, monoesters of monoesters between hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate and succinic acid, phthalic acid and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid with dihydroxyalkyl compounds such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol.  The carbon numbers of the alkyl groups in the above-described carboxyl- and hydroxyl-containing monomers range from about 1 to 12.<br>
Examples of the amido-containing monomer can include (meth)acrylamides and N-substituted (meth)acryl-amides, for example, (meth)acrylic butoxymethylamide,<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
N-tert-butylacrylamide, N-tert-butylmethacrylaraide, diacetoneacrylamide, N-isopropylacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N,N-diethylacrylamide, N-methylol-(meth)acrylamide, and N-alkyloxyethyl(meth)acrylamide.<br>
In addition to the above-described monomers, addition-polymerizing monomers copolymerizable with the above-described respective monomers can be used to extents soluble in the alcoholic solvent in order to impart waterproofness, flexibility and/or other physical properties to the resin.  Examples of such monomers can include (meth)acrylate esters, for example, methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, octyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate, stearyl (meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate, benzyl (meth)acrylate, isobornyl (meth)acrylate, and tetraful-furyl (meth)acrylate; styrene and styrene derivatives, for example, a-methylstyrene; dialkyl esters of dibasic acids, for example, dialkyl maleates, dialkyl fumarates, and dialkyl itaconates; and vinyl acetate, and (meth)acrylonitrile.<br>
The resin for use in the present invention can be obtained by using the above-described monomers and copolymerizing them, for example, by suspension polymerization or solution polymerization, which uses<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
an alcoholic solvent, in the presence or absence of a conventionally-known radical polymerization initiator. As a resin for use in the present invention, it is preferred to use a resin in which a monomer between an alkyl (meth)acrylate and a dibasic acid - said monomer being represented by the following formula: CH2=C(R1)-COO-R2-O-CO-R3-COOH in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, R2 represents an alkylene chain which contains 2 to 6 carbon atoms and may contain a branched chain, R3 represents an alkylene group which may contain a branched chain or unsaturated group - is copolymerized at least a part of a copolymer.  A blend of the copolymer with a copolymer free of the above-described specific monomers may also be used. Whichever resin is used, it is preferred to contain units of a monoester monomer between hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate and a dibasic acid in a proportion of from 1 to 50 wt.%, preferably from 3 to 4 0 wt.% based on the whole resin.  If the content of the monomer units is too low, the resin is not very effective for dispersing pigments.  If the content of the monomer units is too high, on the other hand, writing matter or printed matter has lowered alkali resistance.  It is therefore not preferred to contain the monomer units outside the above range.<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
To obtain the resin by copolymerizing a mixture of the above-described monomers, the monoester of the hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate and the dibasic acid may account preferably for 1 to 50 wt.%, more preferably for 3 to 40 wt.% of the monomer mixture.  The proportions) of other monomer(s) can be suitably determined such that the resulting resin is soluble in the alcoholic solvent and can satisfy its performance requirements, and no particular limitation is imposed on their proportions.  The number average molecular weight of the resin (the number average molecular weight as obtained by measuring the resin by GPC and converting the data with reference to the corresponding data of standard polystyrene) ranges generally from 2,000 to 100,000, preferably from 2,000 to 50,000.  The acid value of the resin ranges generally from 0.5 to 300 mgKOH/g, preferably from 5 to 180 mgKOH/mg.<br>
The ink according to the present invention can be produced in a similar manner as in the production of conventional inks and paints by using the above-described pigment, dispersant, film-forming resin and organic solvent, and no particular limitation is imposed on the production method itself.  Illustrative productions methods can include a method in which the pigment, subsequent to its advance treatment with the<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
dispersant, is dispersed in a solution of the resin in an alcoholic solvent; and a method in which the untreated pigment and the dispersant are mixed with the resin solution and the pigment is subjected to dispersion processing in a disperser.<br>
When the method that the pigment, subsequent to its advance treatment with the dispersant, is dispersed in the solution of the resin in the alcoholic solvent is adopted, the treatment of the pigment can be practiced, for example, as will be described next.  (1) Subsequent to dissolution of the pigment and the dispersant in sulfuric acid or the like, the resultant solution is poured into water.  The thus-obtained mixture is alkalinized to have both of the pigment and dispersant precipitated as a solid solution.  The solid solution is collected by filtration, washed with water, dried and then ground, whereby the pigment is obtained in a treated form.  (2) The dispersant is converted into a salt with sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid or the like.  The salt is mixed with the pigment in water and, if necessary, the resultant mixture is subjected to dispersion processing in a disperser to have the dispersant adsorbed on pigment surfaces.  The thus-treated pigment is caused to precipitate under alkaline condition, collected by fil-<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
tration, washed with water, dried and then ground, whereby the pigment is obtained in the treated form. (3) The dispersant is dissolved in a liquid organic acid such as acetic acid, followed by the addition of the pigment.  After the dispersant is allowed to be adsorbed on pigment surfaces with optional dispersing processing in a disperser, the thus-treated pigment is collected by filtration, washed with an alkaline solution, washed with water, dried and then ground, whereby the pigment is obtained in the treated form.  The treated pigment obtained as described above is dispersed in the solution of the resin in an alcoholic solvent to produce the ink of the present invention. When the method that the untreated pigment and the dispersant are mixed with the resin solution and the pigment is subjected to dispersion processing in a disperser is adopted, the pigment and the dispersant are added to the solution of the resin in the alcoholic solvent and subsequent to optional provisional agitation, the mixture is dispersed in a disperser to obtain an ink.  No particular limitation is imposed on the disperser which can be used in the present invention. Examples can include a kneader, an attritor, a ball mill, a sand mill and a horizontal disperser with tumbling means contained therein, said sand mill and<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
horizontal disperser making use of glass, zircon or the like, and a colloid mill.  Upon using the dispersant-treated pigment, it is also possible to further disperse the dispersant-treated pigment in a solid resin to obtain pigment chips and then to dissolve the pigment chips in an alcoholic solvent to obtain an ink. Subsequent to the dissolution of the pigment chips, a resin may be added as needed.<br>
Pigment chips can be obtained, for example, by-one of the following methods: (1) A solid resin obtained by suspension polymerization or a solid resin collected from a resin solution obtained by solution polymerization and a dispersant-treated pigment are kneaded under heat by using a kneader, a Banbury mixer, a mixing roll, a three-roll mill or the like either singly or in combination such that the pigment is dispersed in the resin.  The resultant pigment-dispersed resin is then ground or chopped to obtain chips.  (2) A solution of a resin in a water-soluble solvent and a presscake of a dispersant-treated pigment are mixed in a kneader, followed by heating to the softening point of the resin or higher to remove water.  If necessary, the pigment is dispersed by using a three-roll mill, an extruder or the like.  The resultant pigment-dispersed resin is ground or chopped to obtain pigment chips.<br><br>

(3) A presscake of a dispersant-treated pigment and a solid resin are subjected to flushing at the softening temperature of the resin or higher.<br>
In the ink according to the present invention, the above-described dispersant may be used generally in a proportion of from 0.5 to 50 parts by weight, preferably in a proportion of from 1 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the pigment.  On the other hand, the pigment may be used generally in a proportion of from 5 to 500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the resin.<br>
The concentration of the pigment in the ink according to the present invention may be from 0.3 to 50 wt.% in general, with 0.5 to 30 wt.% being preferred, although it varies depending on the pigment.  The viscosity of the ink may range generally from 1 to 50 mPa•s, preferably from 2 to 3 0 mPa•s.  Depending on the construction of the writing instrument, a viscosity lower than 7 mPa•s may be required in some instances. It is particularly important for an ink to be equipped with excellent stability in viscosity along the passage of time.  Owing to the use of the above-described dispersant and resin along with a pigment, the ink according to the present invention has been imparted with excellent time-dependent stability in viscosity.<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
A variety of additives can also be added to the ink of the present invention.  Illustrative of such additives are fastness improvers such as ultraviolet absorbers and antioxidants; anti-settling agents; release agents and releasability improvers; perfumes and antimicrobial agents; plasticizers; and drying inhibitors.  If necessary, one or more dyes can be added further.  As a resin, a resin which has compatibility with the resin for use in the present invention may also be used in combination to an extent not lowering the dispersion stability of the pigment.<br>
In general, the thus-obtained ink can be used as is.  It is however preferable to process the ink further in a centrifugal separator or an ultracentrifugal separator or through a filter, because removal of coarse particles of the pigment, which may exist in a trace amount in some instances, makes it possible to heighten the reliability of the writing instrument or recording apparatus.<br>
The writing instrument according to the present invention can be obtained by filling the ink of this invention, which has been obtained as described above, in a casing equipped with a porous tip.  No particular limitation is imposed on the casing insofar as it has a size and shape convenient for writing as in the case of<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
a variety of conventional writing instruments fitted with porous tips.  The material of the casing, including its cap, can be a metal, a plastic or a composite, material thereof insofar as it is practically free from solvent permeation.<br>
No limitation is imposed on the structure or material of the porous tip insofar as it allows the ink to move from the interior of the casing to the free end of the tip as writing proceeds.  However, excellent writing characteristics, durability and solvent resistance are required.  Usable examples of fibers of bundled fiber tips and felt tips can include synthetic fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, nylon, polyacrylonitrile and vinylon fibers; cellulose and cellulose-derived regenerated fibers; and natural fibers such as wool, silk and cotton.  Usable examples of open-cell foamed plastic products can include rigid or flexible urethane resin foams, foams of acetalized polyvinyl alcohol, and foamed of regenerated fibers. Usable examples of ink-occluding members can include bundles fibers, felted fibers, knitted fibers, and open-cell foamed plastic products.<br>
In the above description, inks making use of the dispersants according to the present invention have been referred to as representative examples.  The pres-<br><br>
- 32 -<br>
ent invention is however not limited only to inks.  For example, the dispersants according to the present invention are useful as dispersants for a variety of conventionally-known pigments, and are useful as dispersants for various pigments employed as coloring matters in diverse paints, printing inks, pigment printing agents, synthetic resins and the like.<br>
