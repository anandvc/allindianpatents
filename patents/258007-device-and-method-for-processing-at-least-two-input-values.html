DEVICE AND METHOD FOR PROCESSING AT LEAST TWO INPUT VALUES<br>
The present invention relates to a device and method for processing at least two input<br>
values in signal processing and particularly to signal processing of sequential values,<br>
such as audio samples or video samples, which are particularly suitable especially for<br>
lossless coding applications.<br>
The present invention is further suitable for compression algorithms for discrete values<br>
comprising audio and / or image information, and particularly for coding algorithms<br>
including a transform in the frequency domain or time domain or location domain, which<br>
are followed by a coding, such as an entropy coding in the form of a Huffman or<br>
arithmetic coding.<br>
Modern audio coding methods, such as MPEG Layer 3 (MP3) or MPEG AAC, use<br>
transforms, such as the so-called modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), to obtain a<br>
block-wise frequency representation of an audio signal. Such an audio coder usually<br>
obtains a stream of time-discrete audio samples. The stream of audio samples is<br>
windowed to obtain a windowed block of for example 1, 024 or 2, 048 windowed audio<br>
samples. For the windowing, various window functions are employed, such as a sine<br>
window, etc.<br>
The windowed time-discrete audio samples are then converted to a spectral<br>
representation by means of a filter blank. In principle, a Fourier transform or, for<br>
special reasons, a variety of the Fourier transform, such as an FFT or, as discussed, an<br>
MDCT, may be employed for this. The block of audio spectral values at the output of<br>
the filter bank may then be processed further, as necessary. In the above audio coders,<br>
a quantization of the audio spectral values follows, wherein the quantization<br>
stages are typically chosen so that the quantization noise introduced by the<br><br>
quantizing is below the psychoacoustic masking threshold,<br>
i.e. is "masked away". The quantization is a lossy coding.<br>
In order to obtain further data amount reduction, the<br>
quantized spectral values are then entropy-coded, for<br>
example by means of Huffman coding. By adding side<br>
information, such as scale factors etc., a bit stream,<br>
which may be stored or transmitted, is formed from the<br>
entropy-coded quantized spectral values by means of a bit<br>
stream multiplexer.<br>
In the audio decoder, the bit stream is split up into coded<br>
quantized spectral values and side information by means of<br>
a bit stream demultiplexer. The entropy-coded quantized<br>
spectral values are first entropy-decoded to obtain the<br>
quantized spectral values. The quantized spectral values<br>
are then inversely quantized to obtain decoded spectral<br>
values comprising quantization noise, which, however, is<br>
below the psychoacoustic masking threshold and will thus be<br>
inaudible. These spectral values are then converted to a<br>
temporal representation by means of a synthesis filter bank<br>
to obtain time-discrete decoded audio samples. In the<br>
synthesis filter bank, a transform algorithm inverse to the<br>
transform algorithm has to be employed. Moreover, the<br>
windowing has to be reversed after the frequency-time<br>
backward transform.<br>
In order to achieve good frequency selectivity, modern<br>
audio coders typically use block overlap. Such a case is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 6a. First for example 2,048 time-<br>
discrete audio samples are taken and windowed by means of<br>
means 402. The window embodying means 402 has a window<br>
length of 2N samples and. provides a block of 2N windowed<br>
samples on the output side. In order to achieve a window<br>
overlap, a second block of 2N windowed samples is formed by<br>
means of means 404, which is illustrated separate from<br>
means 402 in Fig. 6a only for reasons of clarity. The 2,048<br>
samples fed to means 404, however, are not the time-<br>
discrete audio samples immediately subsequent to the first<br><br>
window, but contain the second half of the samples windowed<br>
by means 402 and additionally contain only 1,024 "new"<br>
samples. The overlap is symbolically illustrated by means<br>
406 in Fig. 6a, causing an overlapping degree of 50%. Both<br>
the 2N windowed samples output by means 402 and the 2N<br>
windowed samples output by means 404 are then subjected to<br>
the MDCT algorithm by means of means 408 and 410,<br>
respectively. Means 408 provides N spectral values for the<br>
first window according to the known MDCT algorithm, whereas<br>
means 410 also provides N spectral values, but for the<br>
second window, wherein there is an overlap of 50% between<br>
the first window and the second window.<br>
In the decoder, the N spectral values of the first window,<br>
as shown in Fig. 6b, are fed to means 412 performing an<br>
inverse modified discrete cosine transform The same<br>
applies to the N spectral values of the second window. They<br>
are fed to means 414 also performing an inverse modified<br>
discrete cosine transform. Both means 412 and means 414<br>
each provide 2N samples for the first window and 2N samples<br>
for the second window, respectively.<br>
In means 416, designated TDAC (time domain aliasing<br>
cancellation) in Fig. 6b, the fact is taken into account<br>
that the two windows are overlapping. In particular, a<br>
sample y1 of the second half of the first window, i.e. with<br>
an index N+k, is summed with a sample y2 from the first<br>
half of the second window, i.e. with an index k, so that N<br>
decoded temporal samples result on the output side, i.e. in<br>
the decoder.<br>
It is to be noted that, by the function of means 416, which<br>
is also referred to as add function, the windowing<br>
performed in the coder schematically illustrated by Fig. 6a<br>
is taken into account somewhat automatically, so that no<br>
explicit "inverse windowing" has to take place in the<br>
decoder illustrated by Fig. 6b.<br><br>
If the window function implemented by means 402 or 404 is<br>
designated w(k), wherein the index k represents the time<br>
index, the condition has to be met that the squared window<br>
weight w(k) added to the squared window weight w(N+k)<br>
together are 1, wherein k runs from 0 to N-l. If a sine<br>
window is used whose window weightings follow the first<br>
half-wave of the sine function, this condition is always<br>
met, since the square of the sine and the square of the<br>
cosine together result in the value 1 for each angle.<br>
In the window method with subsequent MDCT function<br>
described in Fig. 6a, it is disadvantageous that the<br>
windowing by multiplication of a time-discrete sample, when<br>
thinking of a sine window, is achieved with a floating-<br>
point number, since the sine of an angle between 0 and 180<br>
degrees does not yield an integer, apart from the angle of<br>
90 degrees. Even when integer time-discrete samples are<br>
windowed, ' floating-point numbers result after the<br>
windowing.<br>
Therefore, even if no psychoacoustic coder is used, i.e. if<br>
lossless coding is to be achieved, quantization will be<br>
necessary at the output of means 408 and 410, respectively,<br>
to be able to perform reasonably manageable entropy coding.<br>
Generally, currently known integer transforms for lossless<br>
audio and/or video coding are obtained by a decomposition<br>
of the transforms used therein into Givens rotations and by<br>
applying the lifting scheme to each Givens rotation. Thus a<br>
rounding error is introduced in each step. For subsequent<br>
stages of Givens rotations', the rounding error continues to<br>
accumulate. The resulting approximation error becomes<br>
problematic particularly fox lossless audio coding<br>
approaches, particularly when long transforms are used<br>
providing, for example, 1,024 spectral values, such as it<br>
is the case in the known MDCT with overlap and add (MDCT =<br>
modified discrete cosine transform). Particularly in the <br>
higher frequency range, where the audio signal typically<br><br>
has a very low energy amount anyway, the approximation<br>
error may quickly become larger than the actual signal, so<br>
that these approaches are problematic with respect to<br>
lossless coding and particularly with respect to the coding<br>
efficiency that may achieved by it.<br>
With respect to the audio coding, integer transforms, i.e.<br>
transform algorithms generating integer output values, are<br>
particularly based on the known DCT-IV, which does not take<br>
into account a DC component, while integer transforms for<br>
image applications are rather based on the DCT-II, which<br>
especially contains the provisions for the DC component. <br>
Such integer transforms are, for example, known in Y. Zeng,<br>
G. Bi and Z. Lin, „Integer sinusoidal transforms based on<br>
lifting factorization", in Proc. ICASSP'01, May 2001, pp.<br>
1,181 - 1,184, K. Komatsu and K. Sezaki, „Reversible<br>
Discrete Cosine Transform", in Proc. ICASSP, 1998, vol. 3,<br>
pp. 1,769 - 1,,772, P. Hao and Q. Shi, „Matrix<br>
factorizations for reversible integer mapping", IEEE Trans.<br>
Signal Processing, Signal Processing, vol. 49, pp. 2,314 -<br>
2,324, and J. Hang, J. Sun and S. Yu, ,,1-d and 2-d<br>
transforms from integers to integers", in Proc. ICASSP'03,<br>
Hongkong, April 2003.<br>
As mentioned above, the integer transform described there<br>
are based on the decomposition of the transform into Glvens<br>
rotations and on the application of the known lifting<br>
scheme to the Givens rotations, which results in the<br>
problem of the accumulating rounding errors. This is<br>
particularly due to the fact that, within a transform,<br>
roundings must be performed many times, i.e. after each<br>
lifting step, so that, particularly in long transforms<br>
causing a corresponding large number of lifting steps,<br>
there must be a particularly large number of roundings. As<br>
described, this results in an accumulated error and<br>
particularly also in a relatively complex processing,<br>
because rounding is performed after every lifting step to<br>
perform the next lifting step.<br><br>
Subsequently, the decomposition of the MDCT windowing will<br>
be illustrated again with respect to Figs. 9 to 11, as<br>
described in DE 10129240 A1, wherein this decomposition of<br>
the MDCT windowing into Givens rotations with lifting<br>
matrices and corresponding roundings is advantageously<br>
combinable with the concept discussed in Fig. 1 for the<br>
conversion and in Fig. 2 for the inverse conversion, to<br>
obtain a complete integer MDCT approximation, i.e. an<br>
integer MDCT (IntMDCT) according to the present invention,<br>
wherein both a forward and a backward transform concept are<br>
given for the example of an MDCT.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an overview diagram for the inventive<br>
preferred device for processing time-discrete samples<br>
representing an audio signal to obtain integer values based<br>
on which the Int-MDCT integer transform algorithm is<br>
operative. The time-discrete samples are windowed by the<br>
device shown in Fig. 3 and optionally converted to a<br>
spectral representation. The time-discrete samples supplied<br>
to the device at an input 10 are windowed with a window w<br>
with a length corresponding to 2N time-discrete samples to<br>
achieve, at an output 12, integer windowed samples suitable<br>
to be converted to a spectral representation by means of a<br>
transform and particularly the means 14 for performing an<br>
integer DCT. The integer DCT is designed to generate N<br>
output values from N input values which is in contrast to<br>
the MDCT function 408 of Fig. 6a which only generates N<br>
spectral values from 2N windowed samples due to the MDCT<br>
equation.<br>
For windowing the time-discrete samples, first two time-<br>
discrete samples are selected' in means 16 which together<br>
represent a vector of time-discrete samples. A time-<br>
discrete sample selected by the means 16 is in the first<br>
quarter of the window. The other time-discrete sample is in<br>
the second quarter of the window, as discussed in more<br>
detail with respect to Fig. 5. The vector generated by the<br><br>
means 16	is now provided with a rotation matrix of the<br>
dimension	2 x 2, wherein this operation is not performed<br>
directly,	but by means of several so-called lifting<br>
matrices.<br>
A lifting matrix has the property to comprise only one<br>
element depending on the window w and being unequal to "1"<br>
or "0".<br>
The factorization of wavelet transforms in lifting steps is<br>
presented in the specialist publication "Factoring Wavelet<br>
Transforms Into Lifting Steps", Ingrid Daubechies and Him<br>
Sweldens, Preprint, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies,<br>
1996. Generally, a lifting scheme is a simple relation<br>
between perfectly reconstructing filter pairs having the<br>
same low-pass or high-pass filters. Each pair of<br>
complementary filters may be factorized into lifting steps.<br>
This applies particularly to Givens rotations. Consider the<br>
case in which the polyphase matrix is a Givens rotation.<br>
The following then applies:<br><br>
Each of the three lifting matrices on the right-hand side<br>
of the equal sign has the value "1" as main diagonal<br>
element. There is further, in each lifting matrix, a<br>
secondary diagonal element equal to 0 and a secondary<br>
diagonal element depending on the rotation angle a.<br>
The vector is now multiplied by the third lifting matrix,<br>
i.e. the lifting matrix on the far right in the above<br>
equation, to obtain a first result vector. This is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3 by means 18. Now the first result<br>
vector is rounded with any rounding function mapping the<br>
set of real numbers into the set of integers, as<br><br>
illustrated in Fig. 3 by means 20. At the output of the<br>
means 20, a rounded first result vector is obtained. The<br>
rounded first result vector is now supplied to means 22 for<br>
multiplying it by the central, i.e. second, lifting matrix<br>
to obtain a second result vector which is again rounded in<br>
means 24 to obtain a rounded second result vector. The<br>
rounded second result vector is now supplied to means 26<br>
for multiplying it by the lifting matrix shown on the left<br>
in the above equation, i.e. the first one, to obtain a<br>
third result vector which is finally rounded by means of<br>
means 28 to finally obtain integer windowed samples at the<br>
output 12 which, if a spectral representation of the same<br>
is desired, now have to be processed by means 14 to obtain<br>
integer spectral values at a spectral output 30.<br>
Preferably, the means 14 is implemented as integer DCT.<br>
The discrete cosine transform according to type 4 (DCT-IV)<br>
with a length N is given by the following equation:<br><br>
The coefficients of the DCT-IV form an orthonormal N x N<br>
matrix. Each orthogonal N x N matrix may be decomposed into<br>
N (N-D/2 Givens rotations, as discussed in the specialist<br>
publication P. P. Vaidyanathan, "Multirate Systems And<br>
Filter Banks", Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1993. It is<br>
to be noted that other decompositions also exist.<br>
With respect to the classifications of the various DCT<br>
algorithms, see H. S. Malvar, "Signal Processing With<br>
Lapped Transforms", Artech House, 1992. Generally, the DCT<br>
algorithms differ in the kind of their basis functions.<br>
While the DCT-IV preferred herein includes non-symmetric<br>
basis functions, i.e. a cosine quarter wave, a cosine 3/4<br>
wave, a cosine 5/4 wave, a cosine 7/4 wave, etc., the<br><br>
From the TDAC condition for the window function w, the<br>
following applies: <br><br>
For certain angles αk, k = 0, ..., N/2-1, this preprocessing<br>
in the time domain may be written as Givens rotation, as<br>
discussed.<br>
The angle a of the Givens rotation depends on the window<br>
function w as follows:<br><br>
It is to be noted that any window functions w may be<br>
employed as long as they fulfill this TDAC condition.<br>
In the following, a cascaded coder and decoder are<br>
 described with respect to Fig. 4. The time-discrete samples<br>
x(0) to x(2N-1), which are "windowed" together by a window,<br>
are first selected by the means. 16 of Fig. 3 such that the<br>
sample x(0) and the sample x(N-1), i.e. a sample from the<br>
first quarter of the window and a sample from the second<br>
quarter of the window, are selected to form the vector at<br>
the output of the means 16. The crossing arrows<br>
schematically represent the lifting multiplications and<br>
subsequent roundings of the means 18, 20 and 22, 24 and 26,<br>
28, respectively, to obtain the integer windowed samples at<br>
the input of the DCT-IV blocks.<br>
When the first vector has been processed as described<br>
above, a second vector is further selected from the samples<br>
x(N/2-l) and x(N/2), i.e. again a sample from the first<br>
quarter of the window and a sample from the second quarter<br><br>
of the window, and is again processed by the algorithm<br>
described in Fig. 3. Analogously, all other sample pairs<br>
from the first and second quarters of the window are<br>
processed. The same processing is performed for the third<br>
and fourth quarters of the first window. Now there are 2N<br>
windowed integer samples at the output 12 which are now<br>
supplied to a DCT-IV transform as illustrated in Fig. 4. In<br>
particular, the integer windowed samples of the second and<br>
third quarters are supplied to a DCT. The windowed integer<br>
samples of the first quarter of the window are processed .<br>
into a preceding DCT-IV together with the windowed integer<br>
samples of the fourth quarter of the preceding window.<br>
Analogously, in Fig. 4, the fourth quarter of the windowed<br>
integer samples is supplied to a DCT-IV transform together<br>
with the first quarter of the next window. The central<br>
integer DCT-IV transform 32 shown in Fig. 4 now provides N<br>
integer spectral values y(0) to y(N-1). These integer<br>
spectral values may now, for example, be simply entropy-<br>
coded without an interposed quantization being necessary,<br>
because the windowing and transform yield integer output<br>
values.<br>
In the right half of Fig. 4, a decoder is illustrated. The<br>
decoder consisting of backward transform and "inverse<br>
windowing" operates inversely, to the coder. It is known<br>
that an inverse DCT-IV may be used for the backward<br>
transform of a DCT-IV, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The output<br>
values of the decoder DCT-IV 34 are now inversely processed<br>
with the corresponding values of the preceding transform<br>
and/or the following transform, as illustrated in Fig. 4,<br>
in order to generate again time-discrete audio samples x(0)<br>
to x(2-Nl) from the integer windowed samples at the output<br>
of the means 34 and/or the preceding and following<br>
transform.	<br>
The operation on the output side takes place by an inverse<br>
Givens rotation, i.e. such that the blocks 26, 28 and 22, <br>
24 and 18, 20, respectively, are traversed in the opposite<br><br>
 direction. This will be illustrated in more detail with<br>
respect to the second lifting matrix of equation 1. When<br>
(in the coder) the second result vector is formed by<br>
multiplication of the rounded first result vector by the<br>
second lifting matrix (means 22), the following expression <br>
results:<br><br>
The values x, y on the right-hand side of equation 6 are<br>
integers. This, however, does not apply to the value x sin<br>
a. Here, the rounding function r must be introduced, as<br>
illustrated in the following equation:<br><br>
This operation is performed by the means 24.<br>
The inverse mapping (in the decoder) is defined as follows:<br><br>
Due to the minus sign in front of the rounding operation,<br>
it becomes apparent that the integer approximation of the<br>
lifting step may be reversed without introducing an error.<br>
The application of this approximation to each of the three<br>
lifting steps leads to an integer approximation of the<br>
Givens rotation. The rounded rotation (in the coder) may be<br>
reversed (in the decoder) without introducing an error by<br>
traversing the inverse rounded lifting steps in reverse<br>
order, i.e. if in decoding the algorithm of Fig. 3 is<br>
performed from bottom to top.<br>
If the rounding function r is point symmetric, the inverse<br>
rounded rotation is identical to the rounded rotation with<br>
the angle -a and is expressed as follows:<br><br>
discrete cosine transform of, for example, type II (DCT-II)<br>
has axisymmetric and point symmetric basis functions. The<br>
0th basis function has a DC component, the first basis<br>
function is half a cosine wave, the second basis function<br>
is a whole cosine wave, etc. Due to the fact that the DCT-<br>
II gives special emphasis to the DC component, it is used<br>
in video coding, but not in audio coding, because the DC<br>
component is not relevant in audio coding in contrast to<br>
video coding.<br>
In the following, there will be a discussion how the<br>
rotation angle a of the Givens rotation depends on the<br>
window function.<br>
An MDCT with a window length of 2N may be reduced to a<br>
discrete cosine transform of the type IV with a length N.<br>
This is achieved by explicitly performing the TDAC<br>
operation in the time domain and then applying the DCT-IV.<br>
In the case of a 50% overlap, the left half of the window<br>
for a block t overlaps with the right half of the preceding<br>
block, i.e. block t-1. The overlapping part of two<br>
consecutive blocks t-1 and t is preprocessed in the time<br>
domain, i.e. prior to the transform, as follows, i.e. it is<br>
processed between the input 10 and the output 12 of Fig. 3:<br><br>
The values marked with the tilde are the values at the<br>
output 12 of Fig. 3, while the x values not marked with a<br>
tilde in the above equation are the values at the input 10<br>
and/or following the means 16 for selecting. The running<br>
index k runs from 0 to N/2-1, while w represents the window<br>
function.<br><br><br>
The lifting matrices for the decoder, i.e. for the inverse<br>
Givens rotation, in this case result directly from equation<br>
(1) by merely replacing the expression "sin α" by the<br>
expression "-sin α".<br>
In the following, the decomposition of a common MDCT with<br>
overlapping windows 40 to 46 is illustrated again with<br>
respect to Fig. 5. The windows 40 to 46 each have a 50%<br>
overlap. First, Givens rotations are performed per window<br>
within the first and second quarters of a window and/or<br>
within the third and fourth quarters of a window, as<br>
illustrated schematically by arrows 48. Then the rotated<br>
values, i.e. the windowed integer samples, are supplied to<br>
an N-to-N DCT such that always the second and third<br>
quarters of a window and the fourth and first quarters of a<br>
subsequent window, respectively, are converted to a<br>
spectral representation together by means of a DCT-IV<br>
algorithm.<br>
The common Givens rotations are therefore decomposed into<br>
lifting matrices which are executed sequentially, wherein<br>
after each lifting matrix multiplication, a rounding step<br>
is inserted such that the floating point numbers are<br>
rounded immediately after being generated such that, prior<br>
to each multiplication of a result vector with a lifting<br>
matrix, the result vector only has integers.<br>
The output values thus always remain integer, wherein it is<br>
preferred to use also integer input values. This does not<br>
represent a limitation, because any exemplary PCM samples<br>
as they are stored on a CD are integer numerical values<br>
whose value range varies depending on bit width, i.e.<br>
depending on whether the time-discrete digital input values<br>
are 16-bit values or 24-bit values. Nevertheless, the whole<br>
process is invertible, as discussed above, by performing<br><br>
the inverse rotations in reverse order. There is thus an<br>
 integer approximation of the MDCT with perfect<br>
reconstruction, i.e. a lossless transform.<br>
The shown transform provides integer output values instead<br>
of floating point values. It provides a perfect<br>
reconstruction so that no error is introduced when a<br>
forward and then a backward transform are performed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the transform is a substitution for the modified<br>
discrete cosine transform. Other transform methods,<br>
however, may also be performed with integers as long as a<br>
decomposition into rotations and a decomposition of the<br>
rotations into lifting steps is possible.<br>
The integer MDCT has most of the favorable properties of<br>
the MDCT. It has an overlapping structure, whereby a better<br>
frequency selectivity is obtained than with non-overlapping<br>
block transforms. Due to the TDAC function which is already<br>
taken into account in windowing prior to the transform, a<br>
critical sampling is maintained so that the total number of<br>
spectral values representing an audio signal is equal to<br>
the total number of input samples.<br>
Compared to a normal MDCT providing floating point samples,<br>
the described preferred integer transform shows that the<br>
noise compared to the normal MDCT is increased only in the<br>
spectral range in which there is little signal level, while<br>
this noise increase does not become noticeable at<br>
significant signal levels. But the integer processing<br>
suggests itself for an efficient hardware implementation,<br>
because only multiplication steps are used which may<br>
readily be decomposed into shift/add steps which may be<br>
hardware-implemented in a simple and quick way. Of course,<br>
a software implementation is also possible.<br>
The integer transform provides a good spectral<br>
representation of the audio signal and yet remains in the<br><br>
area, of integers. When it is applied to tonal parts of an<br>
audio signal, this results in good energy concentration.<br>
With this, an efficient lossless coding scheme may be built<br>
up by simply cascading the windowing/transform illustrated<br>
in Fig. 3 with an entropy coder. In particular, stacked<br>
coding using escape values, as it is employed in MPEG AAC,<br>
is advantageous. It is preferred to scale down all values<br>
by a certain power of two until they fit in a desired code<br>
table, and then additionally code the omitted least<br>
significant bits. In comparison with the alternative of the<br>
use of larger code tables, the described alternative is<br>
more favorable with regard to the storage consumption for<br>
storing the code tables. An almost lossless coder could<br>
also be obtained by simply omitting certain ones of the<br>
least significant bits.<br>
In particular for tonal signals, entropy coding of the<br>
integer spectral values allows a high coding gain. For<br>
transient parts of the signal, the coding gain is low,<br>
namely due to the flat spectrum of transient signals, i.e.<br>
due to a small number of spectral values equal to or almost<br>
0. As described in J. Herre, J. D. Johnston: "Enhancing the<br>
Performance of Perceptual Audio Coders by Using Temporal<br>
Noise Shaping (TNS)" 101st AES Convention, Los Angeles,<br>
1996, preprint 4384, this flatness may be used, however, by<br>
using a linear prediction in the frequency ~ domain. An<br>
alternative is a prediction with open loop. Another<br>
alternative is the predictor with closed loop. The first<br>
alternative, i.e. the predictor with open loop, is called<br>
TNS. The quantization after the prediction leads to an<br>
adaptation of the resulting quantization noise to the<br>
temporal structure of the audio signal and thus prevents<br>
pre-echoes in psychoacoustic audio coders. For lossless<br>
audio coding, the second alternative, i.e. with a predictor<br>
with closed loop, is more suitable, since the prediction<br>
with closed loop allows accurate reconstruction of the<br>
input signal. When this technique is applied to a generated<br>
spectrum, a rounding step has to be performed after each<br><br>
step of the prediction filter in order to stay in the area<br>
of the integers. By using the inverse filter and the same<br>
rounding function, the original spectrum may accurately be<br>
reproduced.<br>
In order to make use of the redundancy between two channels<br>
for data reduction, center-side coding may be also employed<br>
in a lossless manner, if a rounded rotation with an angle<br>
of π/4 is used. In comparison to the alternative of<br>
calculating the sum and difference of the left and the<br>
right channel of a stereo signal, the rounded rotation has<br>
the advantage of energy conservation. The use of so-called<br>
joint stereo coding techniques may be switched on or off<br>
for each band, as it is also performed in the standard MPEG<br>
AAC. Further rotation angles may also be considered to be<br>
able to reduce redundancy between two channels more<br>
flexibly.<br>
Particularly the transform concept illustrated with respect<br>
to Fig. 3 provides an integer implementation of the MDCT,<br>
i.e. an IntMDCT, which operates losslessly with respect to<br>
forward transform and subsequent backward transform. By the<br>
rounding steps 20, 24, 28 and the corresponding rounding<br>
steps in the integer DCT (block 14 in Fig. 3), there is<br>
further always possible aw integer processing, i.e.<br>
processing with more roughly quantized values than they<br>
have been generated, for example, by floating point<br>
multiplication with a lifting matrix (blocks 18, 22, 26 of<br>
Fig. 3) .<br>
The result is that the whole IntMDCT may be performed<br>
efficiently with respect to calculating.<br>
The losslessness of this IntMDCT or, generally speaking,<br>
the losslessness of all coding algorithms referred to as<br>
lossless is related to the fact that the signal, when it is<br>
coded to achieve a coded signal and| when it is afterwards<br>
again decoded to achieve a coded/dtecoded signal, "looks"<br><br>
exactly like the original signal. In other words, the<br>
original signal is identical to the coded/decoded original<br>
signal. This is an obvious contrast to a so-called lossy<br>
coding, in which, as in the case of audio coders operating<br>
on a psychoacoustic basis, data are irretrievably lost by<br>
the coding process and particularly by the quantizing<br>
process controlled by a psychoacoustic model.<br>
Of course, rounding errors are still introduced. Thus, as<br>
shown with respect to Fig. 3 in the blocks 20, 24, 28,<br>
rounding steps are performed which, of course, introduce a<br>
rounding error which is only "eliminated" in the decoder<br>
when the inverse operations are performed. Thus lossless<br>
coding/decoding concept differ essentially from lossy<br>
coding/decoding concepts in that, in lossless<br>
coding/decoding concepts, the rounding error is introduced<br>
so that it may be eliminated again, while this is not the<br>
case in lossy coding/decoding concepts.<br>
However, if you consider the coded signal, i.e., in the<br>
example of transform coders, the spectrum of a block of<br>
temporal samples, the rounding in the forward transform<br>
and/or generally the quantization of such a signal results<br>
in an error being introduced in the signal. Thus, a<br>
rounding error is superimposed on the ideal error-free<br>
spectrum of the signal, the error being typically, for<br>
example in the case of Fig. 3, white noise equally<br>
 including all frequency components of the considered<br>
spectral range. This white noise superimposed on the ideal<br>
spectrum thus represents the rounding error which occurs,<br>
for example, by the rounding in the blocks 20, 24, 28<br>
during windowing, i.e. the pre-processing of the signal<br>
prior to the actual DCT in block 14. It is particularly to<br>
be noted that, for a losslessness requirement, the whole<br>
rounding error must necessarily be coded, i.e. transmitted<br>
to the decoder, because the decoder requires the whole<br>
rounding error introduced in the coder to achieve a correct<br>
lossless reconstruction.<br><br>
The rounding error may not be problematic when nothing is<br>
"done" with the spectral representation, i.e. when the<br>
spectral representation is only stored, transmitted and<br>
decoded again by a correctly matching inverse decoder. In<br>
that case, the losslessness criterion will always be met,<br>
irrespective of how much rounding error has been introduced<br>
into the spectrum. If, however, something is done with the<br>
spectral representation, i.e. with the ideal spectral<br>
representation of an original signal containing a rounding<br>
error, for example if scalability layers are generated,<br>
etc., all these things work better, the smaller the<br>
rounding error.<br>
Thus, there is also a requirement in lossless<br>
codings/decodings that, on the one hand, a signal should be<br>
losslessly reconstructable by special decoders, that,<br>
however, a signal also should have a minimal rounding error<br>
in its spectral representation to preserve flexibility in<br>
that also non-ideal lossless decoders may be fed with the<br>
spectral representation or that scaling layers, etc. may be<br>
generated.<br>
As discussed above, the rounding error is expressed as<br>
white noise across the entire considered spectrum. On the<br>
other hand, particularly in high quality applications, such<br>
as they are especially interesting for the lossless case,<br>
i.e. in audio applications with very high sampling<br>
frequencies, such as 96 kHz, the audio signal only has a<br>
reasonably signal content in a certain spectral range,<br>
which typically only reaches up to, at the most, 20 kHz.<br>
Typically, the range in which most signal energy of the<br>
audio signal is concentrated will be the range between 0<br>
and 10 kHz, while the signal energy will considerably<br>
decrease in the range above 10 kHz. However, this does not<br>
matter to the white noise introduced by rounding. It<br>
superimposes itself across the entire considered spectral<br>
range of the signal energy. The result is that, in spectral<br><br>
 ranges, i.e. typically in the high spectral ranges where<br>
there is no or only very little audio signal energy, there<br>
will be only the rounding error. At the same time,<br>
particularly due to its non-deterministic nature, the<br>
rounding error is also difficult to code, i.e. it is only<br>
codeable with relatively high bit requirements. The bit<br>
requirements do not play the decisive role, particularly in<br>
some lossless applications. However, for lossless coding<br>
applications to become more and more widespread, it is very<br>
important to operate very bit-efficiently also here to<br>
combine the advantage of the absent quality reduction<br>
inherent in- lossless applications also with corresponding<br>
bit efficiency, as it is known from lossy coding concepts.<br>
Although a rounding error is thus unproblematic in a<br>
lossless context in that it may be eliminated in the<br>
decoding, it is still of considerable significance for<br>
allowing the lossless decoding and/or reconstruction to be<br>
performed in the first place. On the other hand, as already<br>
discussed, the rounding error is responsible for the<br>
spectral representation becoming defective, i.e. being<br>
distorted as compared to an ideal spectral representation<br>
of the unrounded signal. For special cases of application,<br>
in which the spectral representation, i.e. the coded<br>
signal, is actually important, i.e. when, for example,<br>
various scaling layers are generated from the coded signal,<br>
it is still desirable to obtain a coded representation with<br>
a rounding error as small as possible from which, however,<br>
no rounding error has been eliminated that is required for<br>
a reconstruction.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an<br>
artifact-reduced concept for processing input values.<br>
This object is achieved by a device for processing at least<br>
two input values in accordance with claim 1 or a method for<br>
processing at least two input values in accordance with<br>
claim 11 or a computer program in accordance with claim 12.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a<br>
reduction of the rounding error may be achieved by reducing<br>
the rounding error, whenever two values would actually have<br>
to be rounded and the two rounded values are then combined<br>
to a third further value, for example by addition, by first<br>
adding the two values in unrounded state, i.e. as floating<br>
point representation, and then only adding the added output<br>
value to the third value. Compared to the usual procedure,<br>
in which each value is processed individually, the<br>
inventive concept further results in saving one summation<br>
process and one rounding process, so that the inventive<br>
concept, in addition to the fact that the rounding error is<br>
reduced, also contributes to a more efficient algorithm<br>
execution.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
inventive concept is used for reducing the rounding error<br>
when two rotations divided into lifting steps "abut" each<br>
other, i.e. when there is a situation where first a first<br>
value is to be "rotated" together with a third value, and<br>
when the result of this first rotation is then again to be<br>
rotated with a second value.<br>
A further case of application, of the inventive concept for<br>
reducing the rounding error exists when a lifting stage of<br>
a multi-dimensional lifting concept is preceded by<br>
butterflies, such as it occurs when an N-point DCT is split<br>
into two DCTs having half the length, i.e. with N/2 points.<br>
In this case, there will be a butterfly stage before the<br>
actual multi-dimensional lifting and there will be a<br>
rotation stage after the multi-dimensional lifting. In<br>
particular, the roundings required by the butterfly stage<br>
may be combined with the roundings of the first lifting<br>
stage of the multi-dimensional lifting concept to reduce<br>
the rounding error.<br><br>
Since the number of rounding stages in the integer MDCT<br>
with integer windowing/pre-processing and multi-dimensional<br>
lifting processing for the transform is already<br>
significantly reduced as compared to prior art without<br>
applying the invention, particularly in this situation, the<br>
inventive concept contributes to a significant reduction of<br>
the remaining, although already small, rounding error. This<br>
results in, for example, a spectrum now having only a small<br>
deviation with respect to an ideal spectrum, due to the<br>
still present, but now much reduced rounding error.<br>
Particularly in the context of lossless coding/decoding,<br>
the present invention may be combined with the spectral<br>
shaping of the rounding error, wherein the still remaining<br>
rounding error is spectrally shaped such that it is<br>
"accommodated" in the frequency range of the signal to be<br>
coded in which the signal has a high signal energy anyway,<br>
and that, as a consequence, the rounding error is not<br>
present in ranges in which the signal has no energy anyway.<br>
While, in prior art, a rounding error was distributed white<br>
across the entire spectrum of the signal in lossless coding<br>
and particularly in lossless coding on the basis of integer<br>
algorithms, the rounding error is superimposed on the ideal<br>
spectrum in the form of pink noise, i.e. sucit that the<br>
noise energy due to the rounding is present where the<br>
signal has its highest signal energy anyway, and that thus<br>
the noise due to the rounding error has also little or even<br>
absent energy where the signal to be coded has no energy<br>
itself. Thus the worst case is avoided, in which the<br>
rounding error which is a stochastic signal and is thus<br>
difficult to code, is the only signal to be coded in a<br>
frequency range and thus unnecessarily increases the bit<br>
rate.<br>
When considering an audio signal in which the energy is in<br>
the low frequency range, the means for rounding is designed<br>
to achieve a spectral low pass shaping of the generated<br>
rounding error such that, at high frequencies of the coded<br><br>
signal, there is neither signal energy nor noise energy,<br>
while the rounding error is mapped into the range where the<br>
signal has a lot of energy anyway.<br>
Particularly for lossless coding applications, this is in<br>
contrast to prior art where a rounding error is spectrally<br>
high-pass filtered to get the rounding error outside of the<br>
audible range. This also corresponds to the case where the<br>
spectral range in which the rounding error is present is<br>
filtered out either electronically or by the ear itself to<br>
eliminate the rounding error. For lossless coding/decoding,<br>
however, the rounding error is absolutely required in the<br>
decoder, because otherwise the algorithm used in the<br>
decoder, which is inverse to the lossless coding algorithm,<br>
generates distortions.<br>
The concept of the spectral shaping of the rounding error<br>
is preferably used in lossless applications with a high<br>
sampling rate, because, particularly in the cases where<br>
spectra theoretically extend to up to more than 40 kHz (due<br>
to oversampling), the same situation is achieved in the<br>
high frequency range, in which there is no. signal energy<br>
anyway, i.e. in which coding may be done very efficiently,<br>
as in the case of a non-integer, coding, in which the signal<br>
energy is also zero in the high frequency range.<br>
As a large number of zeros is coded very efficiently and<br>
the rounding error, which is problematic to code, is<br>
shifted to the range which is typically coded very finely<br>
anyway, the overall data rate of the signal is thus reduced<br>
as compared to the case in which the rounding error is<br>
distributed as white noise across the entire frequency<br>
range. Furthermore, the coding performance— and hence also<br>
the decoding performance - is increased, because no<br>
computing time has to be spent for the coding and decoding<br>
of the high frequency range. The concept thus also has the<br>
result that a faster signal processing may be achieved on<br>
the part of the coder and/or on the part of the decoder.<br><br>
In an embodiment, the concept of shaping/reducing the<br>
approximation error is applied to invertibie integer<br>
transforms, particularly the IntMDCT. There are two areas<br>
 of application, namely, ®n the one hand, multidimensional<br>
lifting, with which the MDCT is considerably simplified<br>
with respect to the required rounding steps, and, on the<br>
other hand, the rounding operations required in integer <br>
windowing, such as they occur in the pre-processing prior<br>
to the actual DCT.<br>
An error feedback concept is used for the spectral shaping<br>
of the rounding error, in which the rounding error is<br>
shifted to the frequency range in which the signal being<br>
processed has the highest signal energy. For audio signals,<br>
and particularly also for video signals, this will be the<br>
low frequency range, so that the error feedback system has<br>
a low-pass property. This results in fewer rounding errors<br>
in the upper frequency range, in which there are normally<br>
fewer signal components. In prior art, the rounding errors<br>
prevail in the upper range, which must then be coded and<br>
thus increase the number of bits required for coding.<br>
Preferably, this rounding error is reduced in the higher<br>
frequencies, which directly reduces the number of bits<br>
required for coding.<br>

Fig, 1 shows a device for processing a signal having a<br>
sequence of discrete values which is input to means 202 for<br><br>
manipulating via a signal input 200. The signal is<br>
typically formed to have a first frequency range in which<br>
the signal has a high energy and to have a second frequency<br>
range in which the signal has a comparatively low energy.<br>
If the first signal is an audio signal, it will have the<br>
high energy in the first frequency range, i.e. in the low<br>
frequency range, and will have the low energy in the high<br>
frequency range. If, however, the signal is a video signal,<br>
it will also have the high energy in the low range, and<br>
will have the low energy in the high range. In contrast to<br>
the audio signal, the frequency range in the video signal<br>
is a spatial frequency range, unless successive video<br>
frames are considered in which there also exists a temporal<br>
frequency, for example related to a selected image area, in<br>
successive frames.<br>
The means 202 for manipulating is generally formed to<br>
manipulate the sequence of discrete values so that a<br>
 sequence of manipulated values is obtained in which at<br>
least one manipulated value is not integer. This sequence<br>
of non-integer discrete values is fed to means 204 for<br>
rounding the sequence of manipulated values to obtain a<br>
sequence of rounded manipulated values. The means 204 for<br>
rounding is formed to effect a spectral shaping of a<br>
rounding error generated by the rounding so that, in the<br>
first frequency range, i.e. in the frequency range where<br>
the original signal has a high energy, a spectrally shaped<br>
rounding error also has a high energy, and that, in the<br>
second frequency range, i.e. in the frequency range where<br>
the original signal has a low energy, the spectrally shaped<br>
rounding error also has a low or no energy. Generally, the<br>
energy of the spectrally shaped rounding error in the first<br>
frequency range is thus higher than the energy of the<br>
spectrally shaped rounding error in the second frequency<br>
range. However, the spectral shaping preferably does not<br>
change anything in the overall energy of the rounding<br>
error.<br><br>
Preferably, the device for generating the error-containing<br>
sequence of rounded manipulated values is coupled to means<br>
206 for converting to a spectral representation either<br>
directly or via further manipulation or rounding<br>
combinations. Thus, the error-containing sequence of<br>
rounded manipulated values may be fed directly into the<br>
means 206 for converting to a spectral representation to<br>
achieve a direct spectrum of the error-containing sequence<br>
of rounded manipulated values. However, in an embodiment,<br>
the means for manipulating is a lifting step and/or a<br>
lifting matrix, and the means for rounding is formed to<br>
round the non-integer results of a lifting step. In this<br>
case, the means 204 is followed by a further means for<br>
manipulating performing the second lifting step, which, in<br>
turn, is followed by means for rounding, which, in turn, is<br>
followed by a third means for manipulating implementing the<br>
third lifting step, wherein then there is another<br>
manipulation so that all three lifting steps are<br>
accomplished. Thus, an error-containing sequence of rounded<br>
manipulated values derived from the original error-<br>
containing sequence of rounded manipulated values at the<br>
output of means 204 is generated, which is then finally<br>
converted to a spectral representation, preferably also by<br>
an integer transform, as it is illustrated by block 206.<br>
The output signal of the spectral representation at the<br>
output of block 206 has now/ a spectrum which, in contrast<br>
to prior art, does no longer have a white distributed<br>
rounding error, but a rounding error shaped spectrally,<br>
i.e. so that there is also a high rounding error energy<br>
where the actual "useful spectrum" has a high signal<br>
energy, while even in the best case there is no rounding<br>
error energy in the frequency ranges in which there is no<br>
signal energy.<br>
This spectrum is then supplied to means 208 for entropy-<br>
coding of the spectral representation. The means for<br>
entropy-coding can comprise any coding method, such as a<br>
Huffman coding, an arithmetic coding, etc. Especially for<br><br>
coding a large number of spectral lines which are zero and<br>
border on each other, a run length coding is also suitable<br>
which, of course, cannot be applied in prior art, because<br>
here an actually deterministic signal must be coded in such<br>
frequency ranges which, however, has a white spectrum and<br>
thus is especially unfavorable for any kind of coding<br>
tools, because the individual spectral values are<br>
completely uncorrelated to each other.<br>
Subsequently, a preferred embodiment of the means 204 for<br>
rounding with spectral shaping is discussed with respect to<br>
Figs. 2a, 2b, 2c.<br>
Fig. 2a shows a known error feedback system for the<br>
spectral shaping of a quantization error, as it is<br>
described in the specialist book "Digitale<br>
Audiosignalverarbeitung", U. Zoelzer, Teubner-Verlag,<br>
Stuttgart, 1997. An input value X(i) is supplied to an<br>
input summer 210. The output signal of the summer 210 is<br>
supplied to a quantizer 212 providing a quantized output<br>
value y(i) at an output of the spectral shaping device. At<br>
a second summer 214, the difference between the value after<br>
the quantizer 212 and the value before the quantizer 212 is<br>
determined, i.e. the rounding error e(i). The output signal<br>
of the second summer 214 is fed to a delay means 216. The<br>
error e(i) delayed by one time unit is then subtracted from<br>
the input value by means of the adder 210. This results in<br>
a high-pass evaluation of the original error signal e(n).<br>
If z-1 (-2 + z-1) is used instead of the delay means z-1<br>
designated 216 in Fig. 2a, the result is a second order<br>
high-pass evaluation. In. certain embodiments, such spectral<br>
shapings of the quantization error are used to "mask out"<br>
the quantization error from the perceptible range, i.e. for<br>
example from the low-pass range of the signal x(n), so that<br>
the quantization error is not perceived.<br><br>
 As shown in Fig. 2b, a low-pass evaluation is performed<br>
instead to achieve a spectral shaping of the error not<br>
outside the range of perception, but exactly into the range<br>
of perception. For this, the output signal of the adder<br>
210, as shown in Fig. 2b, is fed to a rounding block 218<br>
implementing some rounding function which may be, for<br>
example, rounding up, rounding down, rounding by<br>
truncating, rounding up/rounding down to the next integer<br>
or to the next but one, next but two ... integer. In the<br>
error feedback path, i.e. between the adder 214 and the<br>
adder 210, there is now a further feedback block 220 with<br>
an impulse response h(n) and/or a transfer function H<z in></z>
addition to the delay member 216. The z-transform of the<br>
output sequence, i.e. Y(z), is related to the input<br>
sequence X(z) via the equation illustrated in Fig. 2b.<br><br>
In the above equation, x(n) is the input signal to the<br>
adder 210, and y(n) is the output signal from the rounding<br>
block 218.<br>
Furthermore, the following equation applies:<br><br>
In the above equation, „round" represents the rounding<br>
function implemented by the block 218. Furthermore, the<br>
following equation applies, in which „*" represents the<br>
convolution operation:<br><br><br>
Since E(z) is the rounding error, it is spectrally shaped<br>
by the filter (1 - z-1 H(z)). According to the invention,<br>
now a low pass-like transfer function is used. The simplest<br>
low pass-like transfer function can be obtained when<br>
setting, for example, H(z) = -1. In this simple example,<br>
the rounding error of the previous rounding operation is<br>
thus simply added to the value to be rounded before the<br>
next rounding operation is applied. Thus, a simple low-pass<br>
filtering of the rounding error, which is very efficient<br>
for the present invention and is thus preferred, is<br>
achieved.<br>
An implementation is illustrated in Fig. 2c. In particular,<br>
the means 202 for manipulating an original sequence of<br>
integer discrete values is illustrated which provides the<br>
sequence of non-integer discrete values y0, y1, y2, -, yi on<br>
the output side. Now, in contrast to prior art, each value<br>
is no longer rounded for itself, as illustrated, for<br>
example, with respect to blocks 20, 24, 28 in Fig. 3 or .<br>
with respect to blocks 104, 110, 142 in Fig. 10 or 126,<br>
132, 150 in Fig. 11. Instead, the non-integer discrete<br>
values of the sequence yo, y1, y2, y3, ... are filtered<br>
depending on each other with low-pass characteristic in the<br>
feedback branch by the "network" shown in Fig. 2c, so that<br>
the result is the described spectral shaping. Like elements<br>
in Fig. 2c and Fig. 2b are illustrated with the same<br>
reference numerals.<br>
Furthermore, Fig. 2c shows a parallel implementation, i.e.<br>
an implementation in which the values to be rounded are<br>
provided in parallel. Of course, this illustration is only<br>
schematic. The values y0, y1, y2, - may be provided<br>
sequentially to then obtain sequential output values,<br>
wherein, in this case, a single implementation of the<br>
structure of the elements 210, 214, 216, 218, 220 is<br>
sufficient. The repeating structures of the elements 214,<br>
218, 210, 220 are illustrated only for the sake of clarity.<br><br>
The means 204 for rounding shown in Fig. 2c thus operates<br>
to first calculate the rounded value tyol • Then the<br>
rounding error i0 is calculated. Then, the rounding error<br>
io is weighted (filtered) by block 220 with the transfer<br>
function H(z) which is preferably -1, and is fed into the<br>
adder 210. This filtered rounding error is added to the<br>
next value of the sequence yi, whereupon the result of the<br>
adder 210 is rounded in block 218 to obtain the rounded<br>
next value [y1]. Subsequently, the rounding error is again<br>
determined by the adder 214, i.e. using the rounded value<br>
[y1] and the original value y1, wherein this obtained<br>
rounding error i1 is again filtered in block 220 to perform<br>
the same procedure for the next value y2 of the sequence.<br>
At this point it is to be noted that the direction is<br>
irrelevant. This means that it is also possible to proceed _<br>
from yi with larger indices to y1 with smaller indices,<br>
i.e. in the opposite direction with respect to that<br>
symbolized particularly by the arrows in Fig. 2c extending<br>
. from block 220 to the adder 210. The order, i.e. whether<br>
the procedure proceeds from low to high sequence indices or<br>
from high to low sequence indices, is thus not important.<br>
Particularly in the application case of the integer MDCT<br>
(IntMDCT), the spectral shaping of the rounding error is<br>
preferably used with especial efficiency at places meeting<br>
the following conditions:<br>
A rounding error is added at several adjacent values<br>
independent of each other.<br>
The adjacent values are (in the broadest	sense) time<br>
signals which are later converted to	a spectral<br>
representation by a transform, i.e.	which are<br>
transferred to the frequency domain.<br><br>
In the following, there is a more detailed explanation in<br>
which parts of the integer MDCT the spectral shaping of the<br>
rounding error is preferably used.<br>
The first preferred embodiment consists in the windowing<br>
prior to the actual transform, i.e. for the rounding<br>
specified in Fig. 3 by the blocks 20, 24, 28. The lifting<br>
operation as experienced by each individual original sample<br>
x1, ..., xN, and outlined based on Fig. 3 may also be<br>
illustrated by the diagram shown in Fig. 7. Here, the<br>
applications of the three lifting matrices, i.e. the<br>
respective multiplication by a factor for a sample, is<br>
illustrated sample-wise, so that the result is the sequence<br>
"from top to bottom", "from bottom to top" and "from top to<br>
bottom".<br>
With respect to the notation in Fig. 7, it is to be noted<br>
that, when an arrow meets a horizontal line, an addition is<br>
performed there. Such an addition is shown, for example, at<br>
27 in Fig. 7. When Fig. 4 is compared to Fig. 7, the only<br>
difference is that x(0) in Fig. 4 corresponds to x1 of Fig.<br>
7. In this respect, xN in Fig. 7 corresponds to x(N-1) in<br>
Fig. 4. However, x (N/2-1) of Fig. 4 corresponds to xH/2 of<br>
Fig. 7. Furthermore, x(N/2) in Fig. 4 corresponds to xN/2+1<br>
of Fig. 7, so that the result are the butterflies shown in<br>
Fig. 2 by which always one value from the first quarter of<br>
a window is weighted with one value from the second quarter<br>
of the window according to the lifting steps, while<br>
analogously also a value of the third quarter of the window<br>
is processed with a value of the fourth quarter of the<br>
window by the "down-up-down system", as illustrated in Fig.<br>
7.<br>
There is a corresponding procedure for the pair of values<br>
XN/2 and xN/2+1. There is again a down-up-down sequence,<br>
wherein a down step 29a is followed by an up step 29b,<br>
which, in turn, is followed by a down step 29c.<br><br>
Fig. 7 thus shows the integer windowing by lifting. This<br>
calculation may also be readily resorted without changing<br>
the result, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Thus, of course, all<br>
downward steps (all steps 29a) may be performed first. Then<br>
all upward steps (29b) may be performed to finally perform<br>
all downward steps 29c, so that the result is a downward<br>
block 31a, an upward block 31b and again a downward block<br>
31c. It is to be noted that Fig. 8 corresponds to Fig. 7,<br>
but in another illustration which is more suitable for<br>
understanding the present invention.<br>
Fig. 9 now shows the concept in which the rounding is<br>
performed with spectral shaping. The lifting calculation<br>
concept shown in Fig. 9 corresponds to Fig. 1 in that the<br>
input values X1, xN/2 represent the original sequence of<br>
integer discrete values at the input 200. The evaluation<br>
blocks cs1, cs2, ..., csk in the down block 31a together form<br>
the means 202 for manipulating. The block designated<br>
[.]/NoiseShaping represents the means 204 for rounding of<br>
Fig. 1. The error-containing sequence of rounded<br>
manipulated values now results at the output of this block<br>
204.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 9, the sequence of error-<br>
containing rounded manipulated values is added to a further<br>
sequence xN/2+1 to xN to obtain a new sequence of integer<br>
discrete values, which, in turn, is manipulated (by the<br>
blocks s1, sk in the up block 31b) to then again achieve a<br>
rounding in the up block 31b by the element 204b. Then<br>
there is again provided a value-wise adder 205b, as in the<br>
down block 31a, i.e. as in the case of the adder 205a, to<br>
obtain the new sequence which, in turn, is fed to a<br>
manipulator 202c, wherein "the output signal of the<br>
manipulator 202c is non-integer and is rounded in a further<br>
rounder 204c to be added, in turn, by a further adder 205c,<br>
i.e. to the sequence fed to the manipulator 202b.<br><br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 9, the result on the output<br>
side is a block of windowed samples which, according to the<br>
systematic scheme as illustrated with respect to Fig. 4,<br>
are fed to correspondingly shifted DCT-IV blocks. These<br>
shifted DCT blocks provide a transform to convert an error-<br>
containing sequence of rounded manipulated values to a<br>
spectral representation. The DCT-IV blocks in Fig. 4 thus<br>
represent an implementation of the means 206 of Fig, 1.<br>
Analogously, the blocks for performing the inverse integer<br>
DCT-IV represent analogous means for converting to a<br>
temporal representation.<br>
Subsequently, the application of the multidimensional<br>
lifting is discussed with respect to the Figs. 10 to 15 to<br>
present an integer implementation of the means for<br>
converting to the spectral representation 206 of Fig. 10a<br>
and/or an analogous integer implementation of the inverse<br>
conversion (for a decoder). The concept of the<br>
multidimensional lifting is presented in the German patent<br>
application having the official reference number<br>
10331803.8.<br>
Fig. 10a shows a device for converting discrete values to a<br>
transformed representation, with integer values. The<br>
discrete values are fed to the device via a first input<br>
100a and via a second input 100b. A first block of discrete<br>
values is supplied via the input 100a, while a second block<br>
of discrete values is supplied via the input 100b. The<br>
discrete values represent audio data or image data and/or<br>
video data. As discussed below, the first block of discrete<br>
values and the second block of discrete values may actually<br>
include two temporally successive blocks of audio samples.<br>
The first and the second block of discrete values may also<br>
include two images represented by discrete values and/or<br>
residual values after a prediction or difference values in<br>
a difference coding, etc. Alternatively, however, the two<br>
blocks of discrete values may have been subjected to pre-<br>
processing, such as in the integer implementation of the<br><br>
MDCT, where the first block and the .second block of<br>
discrete values have been generated by Givens rotations<br>
from actually windowed samples. The first and the second<br>
block of discrete values may thus be derived from original<br>
audio data or image data by some processing, such as<br>
rotations, permutations, plus/minus butterflies, sealings,<br>
etc. Still, the first and the second block of discrete<br>
values obtain audio information and/or image information,<br>
although they are not directly audio sampled or discretized<br>
image values.<br>
The first block of discrete values is fed to means 102 for<br>
processing the first block of discrete values using a first<br>
transform rule via the input 100a to obtain a first block<br>
of transformed values at an output of the means 102, as<br>
shown in Fig. 10a. This first block of transformed values<br>
will typically not be integer, but will include floating<br>
point values, as they are typically obtained by some<br>
transform rule, such as a Fourier transform, a Laplace<br>
transform, an FFT, a DCT, a DST, an MDCT, an MDST or some<br>
other transform, such as a wavelet transform with any basis<br>
functions. The first block of transformed values is fed to<br>
means 104 for rounding the first block of transformed<br>
values to obtain a first block of rounded transformed<br>
values on the output side. The means 104 for rounding is<br>
formed to perform some rounding function, such as rounding<br>
by truncating or rounding up and/or rounding down to be<br>
performed depending on the floating point value, etc.<br>
The rounding rule implemented by the means 104 is thus<br>
responsible for the first block of rounded transformed<br>
values again comprising ,only integer values whose accuracy<br>
is determined by the rounding rule used by the means 104.<br>
The first block of rounded transformed values, just as the<br>
second block of discrete values applied to the second input<br>
100b, is supplied to means 106 for summing to obtain a<br>
second block of summed values. When the audio signal<br>
example is considered, it is apparent that spectral values<br><br>
from the first block of rounded transformed values are<br>
added to time values from the second block of discrete<br>
values by the means 106. If the discrete values of the<br>
second block are, for example, voltage values, it is<br>
recommended that the first block of rounded transformed<br>
values also exists as voltage amplitudes, i.e. as values<br>
with the unit V. In this case, no unit problems are to be<br>
expected in the summation. However, it is apparent for<br>
those skilled in the art that any unit normalizations may<br>
be performed with the first block of rounded transformed<br>
values and/or with the second block of discrete values, in<br>
that both the first block of rounded transformed values and<br>
the second block of discrete values are, for example,<br>
unitless.<br>
The second block of summed values is supplied to means 108<br>
for processing the second block of summed values using a<br>
second transform rule to obtain a second block of<br><br><br>
transformed values. If the transform rule used in the means<br>
102 is, for example, a time-frequency transform rule, then<br>
the second transform rule used in block 108 is, for<br>
example, a frequency-time transform rule. However, these<br>
relations may also be reversed, so that the first and the<br>
second block of discrete values are, for example, spectral<br>
values, so that time values are obtained by the means 102<br>
for processing under the transform rule, while spectral<br>
values are again obtained by the means for processing by<br>
means of the inverse transform rule, i.e. the means 108.<br>
The first and the second transform rule may thus be a<br>
forward or a backward transform rule, wherein then the<br>
inverse transform rule is the backward transform rule or<br>
the forward transform rule, respectively.<br>
The second block of transformed values is fed to means 110<br>
for rounding, as shown in Fig. 10a, to obtain a second<br>
block of rounded transformed values which is finally fed to<br>
means 112 for subtracting to subtract the second block of<br>
rounded transformed values from the first block of discrete<br><br>
values supplied via the first input 108a to obtain a block<br>
of integer output values of the transformed representation<br>
which may be output at an output 114. By processing the<br>
block of integer output values of the transformed<br>
representation using any third transform rule which has<br>
 also been used in the means 102 or which differs from the<br>
same and by subsequent rounding of the block of transformed<br>
output values to obtain a block of rounded transformed<br>
output values, and by subsequent summing of the block of<br>
rounded transformed output values and the second block of<br>
summed values, a further block of integer output values of<br>
the transformed representation may be obtained providing a<br>
complete transformed representation of the first and the<br>
second block of discrete values with the block of integer<br>
output values applied to the output 114.<br>
However, even without the last three steps of processing,<br>
rounding and summing, in which the block of integer output<br>
values of the transformed representation at the output 114<br>
is used, part of the whole transformed representation may<br>
already be obtained, i.e. for example the first half which,<br>
when subjected to the inverse processing, allows a back<br>
calculation of the first and the second block of discrete<br>
values.	<br>
It is to be noted at this point that, depending on the<br>
transform rule, the first, the second and the third<br>
transform rule, if any, may be identical. This is the case,<br>
for example, with the DCT-IV. If an FFT was used as the<br>
first transform rule, the IFFT, which is not identical to<br>
the FFT, could be used as the second (inverse) transform<br>
rule.	<br>
For calculating reasons it is preferred to provide the<br>
transform rule in the form of a matrix, which, if the<br>
number of discrete values of the first block is equal to<br>
the number of discrete values of the second block, is a<br>
quadratic NxN matrix, if the number of discrete values of<br><br>
the first block and the number of discrete values of the<br>
second block, respectively, is N.<br>
In one embodiment, the means 104 and 110 for rounding are<br>
formed to round according to a rounding function providing<br>
rounded results whose accuracy is less than a machine<br>
accuracy inherent to a computer performing the<br>
functionalities shown in Fig. 10a. With respect to the<br>
rounding function, it is to be noted that it maps a non-<br>
integer number to the next larger or smaller integer only<br>
in one preferred embodiment. The rounding function may also<br>
map onto other integers, e.g. the number 17.7 to the number<br>
10 or to the number 20, as long as the rounding function<br>
effects a reduction of the accuracy of the number to be<br>
rounded. In the above example, the unrounded number is a<br>
number with one digit behind the comma, while the rounded<br>
number is a number which does no longer have a digit behind<br>
the comma.<br>
Although, in Fig. 10a, the means 102 for processing using<br>
the first transform rule and the means 108 for processing<br>
using the second transform rule are shown as separate<br>
means, it is to be noted that, in a concrete<br>
implementation, there may exist only one transform function<br>
unit which, controlled by a special flow controller, first<br>
transforms the first block of discrete values and then<br>
inversely transforms the second block of summed values at<br>
the corresponding time of the algorithm. In this case, the<br>
first and the second transform rules would be identical.<br>
The same applies to the two means 104, 110 for rounding.<br>
They also do not have to be provided as separate means, but<br>
may be implemented by one rounding function unit which,<br>
again controlled by the flow controller-, first rounds the<br>
first block of transformed values and then rounds the<br>
second block of transformed values, depending on the<br>
requirement of the algorithm.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the first block of discrete values and<br>
the second block of discrete values are the integer<br>
windowed samples, as they are obtained at the output of<br>
block 28 in Fig. 3. The integer DCT in block 14 of Fig. 3<br>
is then implemented by the integer algorithm shown in Fig.<br>
1 such that the transformed representation in the example<br>
of the audio signal to which Fig. 3 relates represents the<br>
integer spectral values at the output 30 of the device<br>
shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Subsequently, means for inversely converting corresponding<br>
to Fig. 10a is illustrated with respect to Fig. 10b, in<br>
which, besides the block of integer output values at the<br>
output of block 112 of Fig. 10a, there is also used the<br>
second block of summed values at the output of the means<br>
106 of Fig. 10a. With respect to Fig. 11, which will be<br>
explained in more detail below, this corresponds to the<br>
case that there are only the blocks 150 and 130, but not<br>
the transform block 124.<br>
Fig. 10b shows a device for inversely converting a block of<br>
integer output values of the transformed representation, as<br>
obtained at the output 114 of Fig. 10a, and the second<br>
block of summed values. The second block of summed values<br>
is fed to an input 120 of the device for inversely<br>
converting shown in Fig. 10b: The block of output values of<br>
the transformed representation is fed to a further input<br>
122 of the device for inversely converting.<br>
The second block of summed values is fed to means 130 for<br>
processing this block using the second transform rule, if<br>
the transform rule used last in coding was the second<br>
transform rule. The means 130 provides a first block of<br>
transformed values on the output side, which is supplied to<br>
means 132 for rounding, which, in turn, generates a first<br>
block of rounded transformed values on the output side. The<br>
first block of rounded transformed values is then<br>
subtracted from the block of output values of the<br><br>
transformed representation by means of means 134 to obtain<br>
the first block of discrete values at a first output 149 of<br>
the device of Fig. 10b.<br>
This first block of discrete values is supplied to means<br>
150 for processing this block using the first transform<br>
rule to obtain a second block of transformed values at the<br>
output of the means 150. This second block of transformed<br>
subtracted values is, in turn, rounded in the means 152 to<br>
obtain a second block of rounded transformed values. This<br>
second block of rounded transformed values is subtracted<br>
from the second block of summed values provided on the<br>
input side, which was input via the input 120, to obtain a<br>
second block of discrete values at an output 136 on the<br>
output side.<br>
With respect to the relation of the first, the second and<br>
the third transform rule and with respect to the special<br>
implementation of the individual function blocks in Fig.<br>
10b by common function units and a corresponding flow<br>
controller/latching, see the discussion given with respect<br>
to Fig. 10a.<br>
Subsequently, a preferred embodiment of the device for<br>
converting to a transformed representation generally<br>
illustrated in Fig. 10a is described with respect to Fig.<br>
10c. The embodiment in Fig. 10a includes a further<br>
transform/rounding as compared to Fig. 10a to generate the<br>
further block of integer output values from the second<br>
block of summed values.<br>
The first input 100a inqludes N input lines X0, -, xN-1 for<br>
inputting N values of the first block of discrete values.<br>
The second input 100b also includes N lines for inputting<br>
the N values xN, ..., X2N-1 of the second block of discrete<br>
values. The means 102 of Fig. 10a is drawn as DCT-IV<br>
transformer in Fig. 10c. The OCT transformer 102 is formed<br>
to generate N output values from N input values, each of<br><br>
which is then rounded by the rounding rule designated<br>
"[.]", as shown by means 104 in Fig. 10c. The means 106 for<br>
summing is illustrated such that there is a value-wise<br>
summation. This means that the output value of the means<br>
102 with the index 0 is summed with the first value of the<br>
 second block of discrete values having the index N.<br>
Generally, the value of the first block of rounded<br>
transformed values at the output of the rounding means 104<br>
with an ordinal number i is thus individually summed with<br>
the discrete value of the second block of output values<br>
with an ordinal, number N+i, wherein i is a running index<br>
extending from 0 to H-1.<br>
The means 108 for processing using the second transform<br>
rule is also drawn as DCT-IV transformer. In the preferred<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 10c, the means 112 for subtracting<br>
is also formed to perform a value-wise subtraction, i.e.<br>
such that the output values of the rounder 110, i.e. the<br>
values of the second block of rounded transformed values,<br>
are individually subtracted from the first block of<br>
discrete values. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 10c, it is<br>
preferred to perform a corresponding subtraction such that<br>
a value of the second block with an ordinal number of N+i<br>
is subtracted from a value of the first block with the<br>
ordinal number i, wherein i again runs from 0 to N-l.<br>
Alternatively, however, there may also be performed other<br>
summations/subtractions, such that, for example, a value of<br>
a block with the ordinal number of N-l is subtracted from<br>
the value of the other block with the ordinal number N, as<br>
long as this is correspondingly taken into account in the<br>
inverse conversion.<br>
The means 112 for subtracting already provides a block of<br>
integer output values of the transformed representation on<br>
the output side, i.e. the integer output values y0 to yN-1<br>
of the transformed representation. In order to obtain also <br>
the remaining integer output values of the transformed<br>
representation, i.e. the further block yN to y2N-1, if this<br><br>
is optionally desired, the block of integer output values<br>
of the transformed representation applied to the output 114<br>
is subjected to a transform using the third transform rule<br>
by the forward transformer 140, wherein the output values<br>
of the same are again rounded, as illustrated by rounding<br>
means 142, to now perform an addition of these values with<br>
the second block of summed values at the output of the<br>
summer 106, as illustrated by the reference numeral 144 in<br>
Fig. 10c. The output values of the summer 144 then<br>
represent a further block 146 of integer output values of.<br>
the transformed representation which are designated yN to<br>
Subsequently, a device for inversely converting the<br>
transformed representation according to an embodiment is<br>
discussed with respect to Fig. 11. It is to be noted that<br>
the operations performed by the device illustrated in Fig.<br>
10c are losslessly reversed by the device illustrated in<br>
Fig. 11. Fig. 11 corresponds to Fig. 10b with the exception<br>
of the additional trans form/rounding stage to generate the<br>
second block of summed values, which is fed to the input<br>
120 in the embodiment shown in Fig. 10b, from the further<br>
block of transformed output values. It is to be noted that<br>
the function of adding is reversed by the function of<br>
subtracting, respectively. It is further to be noted that<br>
an adder/subtracter pair (144 of Fig. 10c and 128 in Fig.<br>
11) may also be provided with input quantities inverted<br>
with respect to the sign, so that, if a group of input<br>
quantities is provided with a negative sign as compared to<br>
the shown case, the adder 144 then actually performs a<br>
subtraction operation, as long as this is taken into<br>
account in the counterpart (128 in Fig. 11), which would<br>
then actually perform an addition operation.<br>
The subtracter 128 shown in Fig. 11, the adder 134 and the<br>
further subtracter 154 are again formed to perform an<br>
individual value-wise addition/subtraction, wherein again<br>
the same ordinal number processing is used as described<br><br>
with respect to Fig. 10c. If another ordinal number use<br>
than shown was employed in Fig. 10c, this would be taken<br>
into account correspondingly in Fig. 11.<br>
At the output of the subtracter 134, there is already the<br>
first block of discrete values 136 designated x0 to xN-1. In<br>
order to also obtain the rest of the back-transformed<br>
representation, the first block of discrete values is<br>
supplied to the transformer 150 operating with the first<br>
transform rule, whose values on the output side are rounded<br>
by the rounder 152 and are subtracted from the second block<br>
of subtracted values at the output of the subtracter 128 to<br>
finally also obtain the second block of discrete values 156<br>
designated xN, ..., X2N-1.<br>
Subsequently, the mathematical background for the devices,<br>
as they were described with respect to the Figs. 10a, 10b,<br>
10c and 11, is discussed with respect to the Figs. 12 to<br>
15. By the illustrated device for converting and/or for<br>
inversely converting, integer transform methods for a<br>
lossless audio coding are provided in which the<br>
approximation error is reduced. In addition, the<br>
calculation effort is also taken into account in that the<br>
basis is no longer the known approach of applying the<br>
lifting scheme to each Givens rotation, wherein there-<br>
always occur trivial sum-difference butterflies here. They<br>
considerably increase the computing effort as compared to<br>
the original non-integer version of the transform to be<br>
copied.<br>
Normally, the lifting scheme is used to obtain an<br>
invertible integer approximation of a Givens rotation.<br><br><br>
This integer approximation is achieved by using a rounding<br>
function after each addition, i.e. after each lifting step.<br>
The lifting scheme may also be used for an invertible<br>
integer approximation of certain scaling operations. In the<br>
specialist publication R. Geiger and G. Schuller, "Integer<br>
low delay and MDCT filter banks" Proc. of the Asilomar<br>
Conf. on Signals, Systems and Computers, 2002, the<br>
following lifting decomposition of a 2x2 scaling matrix<br>
with a determinant equal to 1 is discussed and described:<br><br>
This lifting decomposition, which is one-dimensional, i.e.<br>
which only relates to a 2x2 scaling matrix, is extended to<br>
the multidimensional case. Specifically, all values from<br>
the above equation are substituted by nxn matrices, wherein<br>
n, i.e. the number of discrete values of a block, is larger<br>
than or equal to 2. Thus the result is that, for any nxn<br>
matrix T, which should preferably be invertible, the<br>
following decomposition into 2n x 2n block matrices is<br>
possible, wherein En describes the nxn unit matrix:<br><br>
In addition to simple operations, such as permutations or<br>
multiplications by -1, all three blocks of this<br>
decomposition have the following general structure:<br><br><br>
For this 2n x 2n block matrix, a generalized lifting scheme<br>
may be used which is subsequently also referred to as<br>
multidimensional lifting.<br>
For a vector of the values x = (xo, ..., X2n-1) , the<br>
application of this block matrix provides the following<br>
equation:<br><br>
It is to be noted that, on the right-hand side of the above<br>
equation, there is a vector whose dimension, i.e. whose<br>
number of lines, equals 2n. The first n components, i.e.<br>
the components from 0 to n-1, correspond to x0 to xn-1. The<br>
second n components, i.e. the second half of the vector<br>
resulting on the right-hand side of the above equation, are<br>
equal to a sum of the second block of discrete values, i.e.<br>
xn, ..., x2n-1, but now summed with the multiplication of the<br>
matrix A corresponding to the transform matrix of Figs.<br>
10a, 10b, 10c and 11, and the first block of discrete<br>
values xo, ..., xn-1,. The transform matrix represents the<br>
first, the second and the third transform rule,<br>
respectively.	-<br>
Similarly to the common lifting scheme with 2x2 matrices<br>
of the form<br><br>
these 2n x 2n matrices may be used for invertible integer<br>
approximations of the transform T in the following way. For<br>
integer input values (xo, ..., X2n-1) , the floating point<br>
output values (y0, ...,/ yn-1) = A.(x0, ..., xn-1) are<br>
rounded, namely to integer values, before they are added to<br><br>
 the integer values (xn, ..., X2n-1) . The inverse of the<br>
block matrix results as follows:<br><br>
Thus, this process may be inverted without error by simply<br>
using the same matrix A and the same rounding function, and<br>
by now subtracting the resulting values instead of the<br>
adding in the forward processing. The forward processing is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 13, while the backward processing is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 14. It is to be noted that the<br>
transform matrix in Fig. 13 is identical to the transform<br>
matrix in Fig. 14, which is preferred fqr simplicity of the<br>
implementation.<br>
Since the values (x0, ..., xn-1) are not modified in the<br>
forward step shown in Fig. 13, they are still present for<br>
the inverse step, i.e. for the backward step in Fig. 14. It<br>
is to be noted that there are no specific restrictions for<br>
the matrix A. Therefore, it does not necessarily have to be<br>
invertible.<br>
In order to obtain an invertible integer approximation of<br>
the known MDCT, the MDCT is decomposed into Givens<br>
rotations in a first stage, wherein this stage is the<br>
windowing stage, and in a subsequent DCT-IV .stage. This<br>
decomposition is discussed in Fig. 3, which will be<br>
explained in the following, and described in detail in DE<br>
10129240 A1.<br>
In ycontrast to prior art, in which the DCT-IV is decomposed<br>
into several stages of Givens rotations, the transform<br>
itself is left unchanged and subsequently rounded.<br>
It is known that thus the integer approximation of the DCT-<br>
IV is performed by several stages of lifting-based Givens<br><br><br>
rotations. The number of Givens rotations is determined by<br>
the underlying fast algorithm used. Thus, the number of<br>
Givens rotations is given by O (N log N) for a transform of<br>
the length N. The windowing stage of each MDCT<br>
decomposition only consists of N/2 Givens rotations or of<br>
3N/2 rounding steps. Thus, particularly for transform<br>
lengths which are high, such as they are used in audio<br>
coding applications (for example 1,024), the integer<br>
approximation of the DCT-IV provides the main contribution<br>
to the approximation error.<br>
The approach uses the described multidimensional lifting<br>
scheme. Thus, the number of rounding steps in the DCTIv is<br>
reduced to 3N/2, i.e. rendered equal to the number of<br>
rounding steps in the windowing stage, i.e. in comparison<br>
to about 2N log2 N rounding steps in the conventional<br>
lifting-based approach.<br>
The DCT-IV is applied to two blocks of signals at the same<br>
time. One possibility for this is illustrated in Fig. 12,<br>
where, for example, two temporally successive blocks of<br>
samples are simply subjected to a DCT-IV. The two blocks<br>
which are subjected to the two transforms may, however,<br>
also be samples of two channels of a multichannel signal.<br>
The decomposition from the multidimensional lifting<br>
equation described above is applied to the transform rule<br>
which may also be considered as N x N matrix. As the<br>
inverse, particularly for the DCT-IV, is again the DCT-IV,<br>
the result is the following decomposition for the concept<br>
shown in Fig. 12:<br><br>
The permutations of the multiplications by. -1 may be<br>
extracted into distinct block matrices, so that the result<br>
is the following:<br><br><br>
Thus, the application of a transform to two blocks of<br>
signals, i.e. to two blocks of discrete values, may be<br>
obtained with preferably three multidimensional lifting<br>
steps:<br><br>
The above equation is graphically illustrated in Fig. 10c<br>
based on an embodiment. The inverse converting is<br>
correspondingly illustrated in Fig. 11, as discussed.<br>
With the approach, two DCT-IV transforms of the length N<br>
may be implemented in an invertible manner, wherein only 3N<br>
rounding steps are required, i.e. 3N/2 rounding steps per<br>
transform.<br>
The DCT-IV in the three multidimensional lifting steps may<br>
have any implementation, i.e., for example, a floating<br>
point based or a fixed point based implementation. It does<br>
not even have to be invertible. It only has to be performed<br>
in exactly the same way in the forward and in the backward<br>
process. As a result, this concept is suitable for high<br>
transform lengths, such as 1,024, as they are used in<br>
current audio coding applications.<br>
The overall computing complexity is equal to 1.5 times the<br>
computing complexity of the non-integral implementation of<br>
the two DCT-IV transforms. This computing complexity is<br>
still significantly lower than for conventional lifting-<br>
based integral implementations which are about twice as<br>
complex as the conventional DCT-IV, because these<br><br>
implementations have to use the trivial plus/minus<br>
butterflies based on the used lifting scheme to achieve<br>
energy conservation, as described in R. Geiger, T. Sporer,<br>
J. Roller and K. Brandenburg, „Audio Coding based on<br>
Integer Transforms" in 111th AES Convention, New York,<br>
2001.<br>
The illustrated approach will calculate at least two DCT-IV<br>
transforms at the same time, so to speak, i.e. within one<br>
conversion. This may be achieved, for example, by<br>
calculating the DCT-IV transform for two successive blocks<br>
of the audio signal or two successive images of an image<br>
signal. In the case of a two-channel stereo signal, this<br>
may also be achieved by calculating the DCT-IV of the left<br>
and the right channel in a conversion action and/or inverse<br>
conversion action. The first version introduces an<br>
additional delay of one block into the system. The second<br>
version is possible for stereo channels and/or, generally<br>
speaking, for multi-channel signals.<br>
Alternatively, if both options are not desired, but if a<br>
normal block processing length of N values is to be<br>
maintained, the DCT-IV of the length N may also be<br>
decomposed into two DCT-IV transforms of the length N/2. In<br>
this context, see Y. Zeng, G. Bi and Z. Lin, „Integer<br>
sinusoidal transforms based on lifting factorization", in<br>
Proc. ICASSP'01, May 2001, pp. 1.181 - 1.184, where this<br>
decomposition is discussed. In addition to the two DCT<br>
transforms of the length N/2, several additional stages of<br>
Givens rotations are required. In this algorithm, there is<br>
further applied a block matrix<br><br>
i.e. N/2 plus/minus butterflies, a block diagonal matrix<br>
with N/2 Givens rotations and further some permutation<br><br>
matrices. Using these additional stages of N/2 Givens<br>
rotations, the multidimensional lifting approach may also<br>
be used for the calculation of only one DCT-IV of the<br>
length N. The basic structure of this algorithm is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 15, where, besides the actual<br>
conversion stage, in which two DCT-IV transforms with the<br>
length of N/2 are used, there is first a butterfly stage to<br>
calculate the first and the second block of discrete values<br>
which, however, now only have a length of N/2. There is<br>
further provided a rotation stage on the output side to<br>
obtain the output values yo, ..., yN-1 from the block of<br>
output values of the transformed representation and the<br>
further block of output values of the transformed<br>
representation, which, however, now only have N/2 values<br>
each, wherein the former are equal to the output values of<br>
a DCT-IV operation of Fig. 12, as becomes apparent in a<br>
comparison of the indices on the input side and on the<br>
output side of Fig. 15 and Fig. 12.<br>
Up to now, there was only discussed the application of the<br>
multidimensional lifting to block matrices of the following<br>
form.<br><br>
However, it is also possible to decompose other block<br>
matrices into multidimensional lifting steps. For example,<br>
the following decomposition may be used to implement the<br>
combination of a stage with normalized plus/minus<br>
butterflies and two blocks of DCT-IV transforms by three<br>
steps of the multidimensional lifting:<br><br><br>
It becomes apparent from the above equation that the first<br>
transform rule, which is used in the left-hand brackets of<br>
the above equation, and the second transform rule, which is<br>
used in the center brackets of the above equation, and the<br>
third transform rule, which is used in the final brackets<br>
of the above equation, do not have to be identical.<br>
Furthermore, it becomes apparent from the above equation<br>
that not only block matrices in which only the main<br>
diagonal elements are occupied may be decomposed, but that<br><br>
also fully occupied matrices may be processed. Further it<br>
is to be noted that there is no restriction that the<br>
transform rules used in converting to a transformed<br>
representation have to be identical or even have to have<br>
any relation to each other, such that, for example, the<br>
second transform rule is the backward transform rule to the<br>
first transform rule. Basically, there might also be used<br>
three mutually different transform rules, as long as this<br>
is taken into account in the inverse representation.<br>
In this context, Figs. 10c and 11 are referred to again. In<br>
the conversion of the discrete values to a transformed<br>
representation, the means 102 may be formed to implement<br>
any transform rule 1. Furthermore, the means 108 may also<br>
be formed to use any other or the same transform rule<br>
referred to as transform rule, 2. The means 140 may further<br>
be formed to generally use any transform rule 3 which does<br>
not necessarily have to be the same as the first or the<br>
second transform rule.<br><br>
In the inverse conversion of the transformed<br>
representation, however, there has to be found an<br>
adaptation to the transform rules 1 to 3 discussed in Fig.<br>
10c, such that the first means 124 for converting does not<br>
execute any transform rule, but the transform rule 3 that<br>
was executed in block 140 of Fig. 10c. Correspondingly, the<br>
means 130 in Fig. 11 has to execute the transform rule 2<br>
which was also executed by the block 108 in Fig. 10c.<br>
Finally, the means 150 of Fig. 11 has to execute the<br>
transform rule 1 which was also executed by the means 102<br>
of Fig. 10c, so that a lossless inverse conversion is<br>
obtained.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a modification of the concept described in<br>
Fig. 10c. In particular, the roundings in the elements 104,<br>
110, 142 for the forward transform or in the elements 126,<br>
132, 152 in the backward transform are no longer executed<br>
sample-wise, but such that there is a spectral shaping of<br>
the rounding error.<br>
When comparing Fig. 10c to Fig. 16, it is apparent that it<br>
is preferred to substitute only block 104 by block 204a,<br>
and to use block 204b instead of the rounding block 110.<br>
This is the case because the concept is especially<br>
advantageous when there is a subsequent transformation into<br>
the frequency range where the white noise of the rounding<br>
error is problematic when no spectral shaping is performed.<br>
Since there is no frequency transformation after the<br>
rounding 142, spectral shaping in block 142 would no longer<br>
involve the advantage. However, this is the case for the<br>
block 204a, because there is again a frequency conversion<br>
by the transform in block 108. The spectral shaping in<br>
block 204b is thus also still" advantageous, because there<br>
is again a transform by the last block 140. However, as is<br>
apparent with respect to Fig. 16, the noise-shaped rounding<br>
error already enters the output block 114, so that, in<br>
block 204b, there could also already be performed a common<br><br>
rounding, as illustrated by the blocks 110 in Fig. 10c,<br>
instead of the spectral shaping of the rounding error.<br>
It depends on the individual case of application whether<br>
there will be spectral shaping rounding or common rounding,<br>
i.e. with a rounding error having a white spectral<br>
distribution, at the end of the second transform, i.e. the<br>
transform 108.<br>
The independent rounding of a certain number of, for<br>
example, k values is thus replaced by rounding with<br>
spectral shaping, which may also be referred to as<br>
"dependent rounding".<br>
It becomes apparent from the above discussion with respect<br>
to Fig. 16 that the spectral shaping of the rounding error<br>
may also be used in the integer DCT required for the<br>
IntMDCT. However, it has to be considered here, as<br>
discussed, that the spectral shaping by error feedback is<br>
only particularly advantageous when the values to be<br>
rounded are time signals which are transferred to the <br>
frequency domain by a further transform step. Therefore, as<br>
illustrated with respect to the multidimensional lifting of<br>
Fig. 16, the spectral shaping is advantageous in the first<br>
two steps, but is no longer necessarily advantageous in the<br>
third step.<br>
It is to be noted that Fig. 16 shows the case in a coder<br>
corresponding to Fig. 10c. The case in the decoder<br>
corresponding to Fig. 16 results directly from a comparison<br>
of Fig. 16 and Fig. 11. The decoder directly corresponding<br>
to Fig. 16 results from Fig. 11 in that all blocks operate<br>
identically, with the exception of the two rounding blocks<br>
132, 152. In Fig. 11, these two rounding blocks operate as<br>
independent rounding blocks and would be substituted, in<br>
the decoder, by dependent rounding blocks 204a, 204b, which<br>
all have the structure shown with respect to Fig. 2c, for<br>
example. In particular, it is to be noted that exactly the<br><br>
same spectral shaping rounding algorithm is to be used in<br>
the decoder as in the coder.<br>
The concept illustrated in Figs. 2b and 2c, particularly<br>
for H(z) = "-1", is further also especially suitable to<br>
achieve an inventive reduction of the rounding error and<br>
particularly a reduction of the rounding error in integer<br>
transforms.<br>
According to the invention, such a reduction of the<br>
rounding error is possible whenever two floating point<br>
values are rounded and added to the same value instead of<br>
different values. Such an exemplary situation is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 17. Here, there is first a first<br>
lifting step with a sequence of down-up-down between the<br>
lifting participants X1 and X3. There is further a second<br>
lifting sequence with the known sequence of down-up-down,<br>
but now with the lifting participants X2 and x3. In<br>
particular, the value x3 obtained in the first lifting<br>
operation is used to serve as addition partner in the<br>
second lifting step, as it is apparent from Fig. 17. It is<br>
again to be noted that, when an arrow arrives at a<br>
horizontal line, this represents an addition. In other<br>
words, a value which has just been rounded is thus added to<br>
the value corresponding to the horizontal line.<br>
Specifically, in the example shown in Fig. 17, the value x1<br>
is first weighted (block 250) and then individually rounded<br>
(block 252). The output signal of block 252 is added to X3<br>
(block 254). Then, the result of adding 254 is again<br>
weighted (block 256) and again rounded (block 258). The<br>
result of this rounding 258 is now added to X1 (260) . The<br>
result of the addition 260 is again weighted (block 262)<br>
and rounded (block 264) to be added to the current value of<br>
x3 (to block 266) . Correspondingly, the value X2 is .<br>
weighted by a block 270 and is then rounded by a block 272.<br>
The result of block 272 is added (274) to the now current<br>
value of x3. Then there is again weighting (276) and<br><br><br>
rounding (2.7 8) to add (280) the result of block 278 again<br>
to the current value of x2. The result of this addition 280<br>
is again weighted (block 282), and the weighted result is<br>
rounded (block 284) to then add the result of the rounding<br>
block 284 again to the now current value of x3 (block 284)<br>
to obtain a result value for x3. It is apparent from Fig.<br>
17 that first a first value, i.e. the result of block 262,<br>
is rounded and then added to X3. In addition, a second<br>
value, i.e. the result of block 270, is also rounded (block<br>
272) and then added to the value x3 (adder 274) . So there<br>
is the situation that two floating point values are rounded<br>
one after the other and added to the same value instead of<br>
different values. In the example shown in Fig. 17, the<br>
result of the third and the fourth lifting step is added to<br>
the same value, i.e. x3, so the adding is done with the<br>
rounding function [.]:<br><br>
If the error of the third lifting step in rounding is fed<br>
into the fourth lifting step, the error of the third step<br>
may be used in this case and only one rounding error is<br>
generated instead of two rounding errors. With respect to<br>
j<br>
calculation, this results from the following:<br><br>
With respect to calculation, feeding the rounding error<br>
into the next rounding step is thus in this case identical<br>
to an addition of the values and a subsequent rounding.<br>
This situation is illustrated in Fig. 18, wherein Fig. 18<br>
corresponds to Fig. 17, while, however, the two separate<br>
rounding blocks 264, 272 and the two separate adders 266,<br><br>
274 are substituted by a block 268 formed to implement the<br>
above equation. Therefore, the results of the two blocks<br><br>
262 and 270 are first added in unrounded form and then<br><br>
rounded. In favorable cases, the rounding error is thus up<br>
to halved. At the output of the block 268, there now<br>
results only one single value which is added to X3 by an<br>
adder 269.<br>
A combination of reduction and shaping of the rounding<br>
error may also occur, for example when a set of Givens<br>
rotations and a multidimensional lifting step follow each<br>
other, as illustrated in Fig. 19. Here, by way of example<br>
only, the last step of a down-up-down sequence for several<br>
values is performed of values x1 to X4, i.e., for example,<br>
the down step 31c of Fig. 9. These values are now to be<br>
added to corresponding values, to which also the rounded<br>
values in Fig. 16, i.e. the values at the output of block<br>
204a, are to be added. In this case, it is preferred to add<br>
the unraunded values first, namely by the adders 203 shown<br>
in Fig. 19, to then round the added values in block 204 in<br>
Fig. 19 and simultaneously subject them to noise shaping<br>
such that then only a simple rounding error is obtained and<br>
the output values after the addition by the adders 106<br>
contain less error. The situation is Fig. 19 thus results<br>
when Fig. 9 is put to the left of Fig. 16, and particularly<br>
when an N/2 value DCT-IV is used instead of an N value DCT-<br>
IV.<br>
According to the invention, it is thus preferred to combine<br>
the reduction of the rounding error with the shaping of the<br>
rounding error. In the case of the reduction of the<br>
rounding error, several input values are thus processed and<br>
rounded together, wherein the rounded values are added to<br>
one value, while, in the case of the spectral shaping of<br>
the rounding error, the rounded values are rounded<br>
independently of each other and are added to several<br>
respectively different other values.<br>
It is further to be noted that the situation in Fig. 19 may<br>
also occur when, as illustrated in Fig. 15, N/2 DCTs are<br>
used. Here, prior to the conversion stage, i.e. prior to<br><br>
I<br>
the two DCT blocks, there exists the stage referred to as<br>
butterfly stage in Fig. 15, in which the input values x0 to<br>
XN/2-1 are correspondingly weighted and rounded to be then<br>
added to the same values to which the values of a DCT-IV<br>
stage are also added. It is further to be noted that the<br>
conversion stage in Fig. 15 is illustrated only<br>
schematically. The two DCT-IV blocks illustrated<br>
schematically in Fig. 15 would be substituted by the<br>
components shown in Fig. 16 in a practical implementation,<br>
if, in Fig. 16, xN/2-1 is written instead of xN-1, and if<br>
there is written instead of xn/2, and if xN-1 is written<br>
instead of xN/2-1.<br>
Thus Fig. 19 shows a preferred implementation particularly<br>
for monoapplications, i.e. for the case in which an N/2<br>
DCT-IV is to be used.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, the inventive method for<br>
rounding may be implemented in hardware or in software. The<br>
implementation may be done on a digital storage medium,<br>
particularly a floppy disk or CD with control signals that<br>
may be read out electronically, which may cooperate with a<br>
programmable computer system so that the method is<br>
performed. Generally, the invention thus also consists in a<br>
computer program product with a program code for performing<br>
the inventive method stored on a machine-readable carrier,<br>
when the computer program product runs on a computer. In<br>
other words, the invention is thus also a computer program<br>
with a program code for performing the method, when the<br>
computer program runs on a computer. <br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	Device for processing at least two input values, comprising:<br>
means (202;250,252,254,256,258,260,262) for providing a first non-<br>
integer input value and a second non-integer input value,<br>
wherein the means for providing is designed to weight a first original<br>
value to obtain the first input value and to calculate the second input value by<br>
a transform from a sequence of original input values to which the original first<br>
value (X1) belongs, or to generate the first input value from a first original<br>
value and a third value (X3) by a first and a second lifting step and a<br>
subsequent weighting (262) and to generate the second input value by<br>
weighting (270) from an original second input value (X2); and<br>
means (268) for combining the first input value and the second input value to<br>
obtain a non-integer result value and for rounding the result value to obtain a<br>
rounded result value.<br>
2.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the means for combining is<br>
designed to form a sum or a difference.<br>
3.	Device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the first and the second input<br>
values are discrete values comprising audio and/or video information.<br><br>
4.	Device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, comprising:<br>
means (269) for coupling the result value to a third input value to obtain<br>
an output value.<br>
5.	Device as claimed in claim 4, wherein the means (269; 104) for coupling is<br>
configured as summer or subtracter.<br>
6.	Device as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein the third input value is an<br>
integer input value so that the output value is also an integer value.<br>
7.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the device is enabled to add the<br>
integer result value to a third input value modified by a lifting operation<br>
and to perform a second and a third lifting step of a rotation with the third<br>
input value modified by a lifting operation and the second input value.<br><br>
8. Device as claimed in claim 1, comprising means (106) for adding the<br>
integer input value to a third input value which is part of a sequence that<br>
has been processed by a first transform rule (102) to obtain a value of a<br>
further sequence that is to be processed by a second transform rule,<br>
wherein the first transform rule and the second transform rule are<br>
transform rules defining a first and a second multi-dimensional lifting step.<br>
9. A method for processing in a device as claimed in claim 1, at least two input<br>
values representing discrete values comprising audio and/or video information.<br><br><br><br>
Device and Method for Processing at least two Input Values<br><br><br>
Abstract<br><br><br>
For the reduction of the rounding error, a first and a<br>
second non-integer input value are provided (260, 262) and<br>
combined (268), for example by addition, in non-integer<br>
state to obtain a non-integer result value which is rounded<br>
and added (269) to a third input value. Thus, the rounding<br>
error may be reduced at an interface between two rotations<br>
divided into lifting steps or between a first rotation<br>
divided into lifting steps and a first lifting step of a<br>
subsequent multi-dimensional lifting sequence.</td>
