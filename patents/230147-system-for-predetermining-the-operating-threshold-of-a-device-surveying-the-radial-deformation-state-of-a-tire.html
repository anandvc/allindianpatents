				<td>System for predetermining the operating threshold of a device surveying the radial<br>
deformation state of a tire<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system for predetermining the operating threshold of<br>
a device, which surveys the radial state of deformation of a tire. In particular, the<br>
invention discloses an industrialised embodiment, suitable for mass production of the<br>
system presenting also particular solutions for predetermining the operating and<br>
signalling threshold.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
EP-A 0 893 284, the owner of which is the applicant, discloses a surveying device, in<br>
which a sensor is capable of identifying the difference of pressure between the pressure<br>
of the gas inside the tire and the environmental pressure and of out signalling when this<br>
difference in pressure is lower than a pre-established threshold value. This device is not<br>
used for automatic low cost mass production, presenting a system for the<br>
predetermination of the operating threshold, which is not so efficient for mass<br>
production. In the Prior Art documents now available safety systems for the<br>
identification of the leaks through internal sealing members of the device capable of<br>
meeting any requirement are not provided.<br>
AIMS AND FEATURES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to remedy these defects. The invention, as<br>
claimed, solves the problem of creating a system for the predetermination of the<br>
operating threshold of a device surveying the radial deformation state of a tire. By<br>
means of the present invention it is possible to pre-establish the operating threshold for<br>
signalling when the radial deformation state of a loaded tire is higher than a pre-<br>
established value since the deformation is proportional to the difference between the gas<br>
pressure inside the tire and the environment pressure.<br>
An other purpose to the invention is to provide the device with systems capable of<br>
sensing the leak through internal sealing members and protecting the system by out<br>
signalling the event.<br><br>
The system according to the present invention comprises a closure member in<br>
equilibrium under the force due to the pressure of the tire chamber acting on a side and<br>
the force due to the environmental pressure together with the force of springs on the<br>
other side,<br>
the section of the closure member on which the pressure and springs forces act,<br>
determines the pressure value inside the tire chamber capable of upsetting the<br>
equilibrium of the forces with a pressure value lower or identical than a pre-established<br>
threshold.<br>
The elastic push of the springs determines the pressure value inside the tire chamber<br>
capable of upsetting the equilibrium of the forces with a pressure value lower or<br>
identical than a pre-established threshold.<br>
A plurality of springs is provided, located in series and/or in parallel to define the full<br>
elastic force co-operating to the equilibrium of the forces acting on the closure member.<br>
The used springs are Belleville washers.<br>
A first Belleville washer rests its external perimeter on the external part of a plate and<br>
its internal perimeter on the internal part of the plate, when the system is loaded.<br>
The other springs of the plural ty push on the first one.<br>
A side of the chamber is delimited by the envelope, the wall distal from the tire, a first<br>
gasket, the group comprising a movable closure member, a diaphragm, a guiding plate<br>
and a second gasket, while the other side is delimited by the diaphragm and the closure<br>
member integral with each others; when the system is loaded, the end of the housing of<br>
the group opens the closure member of a tire inflating valve, therefore, the tire pressure<br>
acts in said chamber coming through the chamber, the axial canalisation; a first gasket<br>
and a second gasket are used to prevent the connection between the chamber and the<br>
chamber.<br>
A chamber is delimited by the threaded end of the tube of the tire inflating valve, by a<br>
gasket located between said end and the upper wall of the threaded body, by the end of<br>
the housing of the group and by the gasket.<br>
A chamber is delimited by the diaphragm, the closure member and the gasket, the<br>
chamber communicating with the atmosphere through a hole, a chamber, the passage,<br><br>
the chamber and the chamber at environmental pressure.<br>
A spring is further provided acting on the closure member with a pre-load defined<br>
during the montage of the system.<br>
The spring is pre-loaded by an adjusting screw during the adjusting phase after the<br>
montage.<br>
A cylindrical self-closing closure member housed in the hole is pushed by the spring<br>
against the gasket, to define sealing and separate the chamber from the chamber when<br>
the closure member is unloaded.<br>
A passage connects the downwards portion of the gasket with respect to the chamber<br>
to the chamber, communicating with the atmosphere through passages in series with<br>
environmental pressure causing adjusted pressure losses; in case that the gasket leaks,<br>
the gas of the chamber reaches the atmosphere since it is subject to the pressure losses,<br>
therefore, the pressure in the chamber reaches a value higher than the atmospheric one;<br>
the pressure difference increases with the value of the loss until the equilibrium of the<br>
forces acting on the closure member upsets, the equilibrium being due to the increase of<br>
the pressure in the chamber .<br>

DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 represents a device (1) mounted on a normal inflating valve for tires. Said valve<br><br>
substantially consists of a metallic tube (2) containing a body (3) fixed to its internal<br>
part through a threaded sealed connection (4) where a self-closing closure member (5)<br>
with sealing gasket (6), maintained in closing position by means of a spring (7) can<br>
axially slide.<br>
The closure member (5) is capable of automatically opening if the pressure, acting on its<br>
part faced toward the external side, that is in the chamber (8), multiplied by the<br>
effective surface of the sealing gasket (6), generates an axial downward force higher than<br>
the one due to the pressure acting on its part faced toward the internal side, that is in<br>
the chamber (9), or inside the tire, multiplied by the effective surface of the sealing<br>
gasket (6) together with the additional force of the spring (7) or, vice-versa, of keeping<br>
closed if the force due to the pressure in the part faced toward the external side<br>
(chamber 8) is lower than the one due to the pressure of the tire (chamber 9) together<br>
with the additional force of the spring (7). Of course, the closure member (5) can be<br>
opened also by a mechanical action from the external side applying a force to its end<br>
going to the internal side as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The device (1) is screwed on the inflating valve instead of the usual protecting cup. The<br>
device (1) and more of its internal members have an axial-symmetrical form. The device<br>
(1) comprises a threaded body (11) formed by two parts (11a and 11b) welded each<br>
other: the threaded body (11) engages the threaded end (10) of the inflating valve of the<br>
tire. An external envelope (12) is connected to the threaded body (11) through anti-<br>
unscrewing clicks controlling the most applied torque and generating an axial pushing as<br>
known from other documents.<br>
Said devices realise an unidirectional free tripper allowing the transmission of the torque<br>
between the envelope (12) and the threaded body (11) in the screwing direction only. In<br>
said way, when the clamping of all the system is completed and a sufficient tightening<br>
torque (capable of contrasting a unscrewing torque) is assured, it is impossible to<br>
unscrew the system from the valve since the unscrewing torque applied to the envelope<br>
(12) is not transmitted to the threaded body (11).<br>
The clamping is necessary in order to avoid the unscrewing of the system and its losing<br>
during the vehicle moving due to external forces and vibrations and also to assure the<br><br>
efficient of the functions the clamping must do.<br>
The clamping of the system on the valve is properly effected when it is carried out by a<br>
suitable and not excessive final torque. Either in case of manual screwing of the system<br>
on the end of the inflating valve of the tire, or, above all, in case of use of auxiliary<br>
tools for applying a stronger damping torque, the risk to apply a clamping torque<br>
resulting too much strong capable of damaging the system and/or a sealing gasket (23)<br>
located between the threaded body (11) and the end (10) of the valve exists.<br>
Anyway, the applying of a too much strong clamping torque is not the only problem.<br>
also an insufficient clamping torque results potentially damaging since it makes the<br>
presence and the action of the sealing gasket (23) inefficient and it can also cause the<br>
unexpected unscrewing , total as well, of the system because of the vibrations due to the<br>
vehicle running.<br>
The system is, therefore, capable of assuring, also in case of manoeuvring by a not<br>
specialised staff and without suitable tools (and therefore not able to verify if the<br>
applied screwing torque has a value that is sufficient for the purpose), the efficient and<br>
complete clamping of the threaded members (10, 11) and of the gasket (23).<br>
At the same way, it is suggested to provide a solution that, in addition to assure a<br>
complete and efficient clamping of the threaded body on the valve, and consequently<br>
capable of informing the operator when a screwing torque having a proper and sufficient<br>
value is reached, and then capable of preventing an excessive clamping through screwing<br>
torque moments having a value higher than the one expected for the purpose.<br>
In order to get that it is possible to use a kind of system for limiting the torque with<br>
respect to the screwing torque applied by the envelope (12) to the threaded body (11)<br>
through the above mentioned unidirectional free tripper.<br>
A spring (24) is located between the threaded body (11) and a centring sleeve (25). By<br>
means of the sleeve (2 5) the spring (24) pushes upwards the<br>
sensor/amplifier/transducer/actuator system (26) which, before the screwing and<br>
clamping manoeuvring of the system (1) on the valve, is found in unloading position<br>
(Fig. 2). Therefore, it rests on the upper wall (27) to the opposite end of the threaded<br>
body and rigidly sealing connected to the envelope (12). The sealing is due to a gasket<br><br>
(28) located between the end of the envelope (12) and an abutting on the wall (27).<br>
In said configuration the lower end (30) of the housing (31) of the system (26) does not<br>
touch the upper end of the closure member (5), therefore the valve sealing (2) is due to<br>
the gasket (6) acting against the body (3).<br>
An axial pushing P applied to the envelope (12) is transmitted by the wall (27) to the<br>
sensor/amplifier/transducer/actuator system (26), which, at its turn, compresses the<br>
spring (24).<br>
The pushing carried out by the wall (27) on the system (26) causes the translation of<br>
said system towards the upper wall (29) of the threaded body (11) up to limit stop.<br>
During the descent, the lower end (30) of the housing (31) of the system (26) meets the<br>
upper end of the closure member (5) and pushes said member (5) towards the internal<br>
part of the valve (2) against the force of the spring (7) and of the pushing of the<br>
pressure due to the gas contained in the tire on the efficient section of the gasket (6). By<br>
means of said operation the chamber (9), connected to the internal part of the tire, is<br>
joined to the chamber (8) delimited by the end (10) of the valve (2), the upper wall (29)<br>
of the threaded body (12), the gasket (23) and a gasket (32) capable of sealing the lower<br>
end (30) of the housing (31) of the system (26) and the cylindrical hollow (33) obtained<br>
on the upper wall (29) of the threaded body (11) (see Fig. 1).<br>
The gasket (6) is open until the system (26) is found near the threaded body (11), while<br>
its automatic closing occurs when the system (26) is far from the threaded body (11).<br>
Apparatuses capable of obtaining functions of measuring, amplifying and transducing of<br>
the signal due to the difference between the pressure of the gas contained inside the tire<br>
and the environmental pressure and of signalling of the exceeding the pre-established<br>
threshold.<br>
In this embodiment, said apparatuses are capable of obtaining an efficient pre-<br>
establishment of the operating threshold and signalling for differences in pressure<br>
between 0,05 and 3 MPa with a definition, precision and reproducibility according to<br>
the requirements of using of the tires by means of a limited number of components.<br>
A shaped plate (48) used for rigidly and plane supporting a plurality of Belleville<br>
washers (49) is located inside the lousing (31); said washers (49) consisting of shaped<br><br>
like a cone and drilled disks as shown in Figures 3, 4.<br>
A movable closure member (50) having a central hub (51) rests on the Belleville washers<br>
(49). The hub (51) being drilled in the middle.<br>
A guiding plate (52) provides the centring of the movable closure member (50), resting<br>
on the housing (31) through the plate (48).<br>
A component (39) fixed to the movable closure member (50) and drilled in the middle<br>
seals a diaphragm (53) compressing it on the same member (50). The diaphragm<br>
presents a central hole where the hub (51) is inserted. The same diaphragm (53) is then<br>
sealed on the guiding plate (52) by a sleeve plate (54) clamped by the riveting (55) of<br>
the housing (31). The sleeve plate (54) guides the component (39) while this one axially<br>
moves together with the movable closure member (50).<br>
A seat in the housing (31) houses a gasket (56), which is hold in its position by a<br>
riveting, shaped like a lip (57).<br>
During the loading phase, the pushing P of Fig. 2 is transmitted by the wall (27) to the<br>
component (39), which transmits said pushing P to the movable closure member (50);<br>
for this reason the member (50) compresses the Belleville washers (49) until the edge of<br>
the central hole touches the plate (48). At the same time (Fig. 3), the movable closure<br>
member (50) compresses the gasket (56) for the sealing between the member (50) and<br>
the housing (31).<br>
This operation produces an axial canalisation (58), (59), (60), which, due to the radial<br>
passage (73) on the end (30) of the housing (31), connects the chamber (8) to the<br>
chamber (36) and disconnects this chamber (36) from a chamber (64) delimited by the<br>
housing (31), the movable closure member (50)/diaphragm (53)/guiding plate (52)<br>
system and by the gasket (56).<br>
The chamber (64) communicates with the environment through a hole (65) drilled in the<br>
housing (31), the chamber (66), the passage (67) to the cavity (22) found on the basis of<br>
the threaded body (11) and the envelope (12) connected to the environment through a<br>
hole drilled in the basis of the threaded body (11).<br>
In Fig. 3 the section (58) of said canalisation consists of an axial hole (62) found at the<br>
end (30) of the housing (31). In Fig;. 4 the section (58) of said canalisation consists of an<br><br>
axial hole drilled in a screw (61) screwed in a hole (62) found at the end (30) of the<br>
housing (31).<br>
The section (59) of said canalisation consists of a hole (63) located in the housing (31)<br>
and in series with respect to the hole (62) where the screw (61) is screwed.<br>
The section (60) of said canalisation consists of a hole located inside the hub (51).<br>
In this configuration the end (30) of the housing (31) opens the closure member (S) of<br>
the valve (2) so that the pressure of the tire acts in the chambers (8, 36).<br>
The functions of the device are disclosed by EP-A 0 893 284 and, therefore, they are<br>
not repeated in the present document. On the contrary, it is of interest to point out the<br>
innovative feature of the system consisting of movable closure member (50)/diaphragm<br>
(53)/guiding plate (52) and gasket (56).<br>
The Belleville washers (49) replace, in this case, the bistable lamina of the device as<br>
cited in EP-A 0 893 284. The chamber (64) replaces the housing located under the<br>
bistable lamina. The chamber (36) substitutes the chamber located over the bistable<br>
lamina. The axial canalisation (58, 59, 60) replaces the channels between the chamber<br>
communicating with the inside of the tire and the chamber located over the bistable<br>
lamina when the device is loaded.<br>
The purpose of the system comprising the Belleville washers (49), the group movable<br>
closure member (50)/diaphragm (53)/guiding plate (52) and gasket (56) is to measure the<br>
difference in pressure between the chamber (36) and the environment when the device is<br>
loaded, to signal when said difference decreases under a pre-established threshold value<br>
and then to define the same threshold value.<br>
The pressure in the chamber (36) acts on the section of the diaphragm (53) on which<br>
said pressure operates; said section being delimited by clamping sealing portions with<br>
respect to the guiding plate (52) and the movable closure member (50).<br>
The diaphragm (53) generates a frictionless seal between the movable closure member<br>
(50) and the guiding plate (52).<br>
Therefore, the force due to the pressure in the chamber (36) acting on the movable<br>
closure member (50) is proportional to the surface externally delimited by the<br>
dimension of the external contour (68) of the member (50) which mates, with free axial<br><br>
movement, with the centring in the guiding plate (52), and internally delimited by the<br>
effective sealing section (on the plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the<br>
device) of the gasket (56), since the pressure in the chamber (36) acts in said effective<br>
sealing section of the gasket (56), while the external pressure of the chamber (68)<br>
operates inside said sealing section.<br>
The planing of the sections regarding to the surface externally delimited by the<br>
dimension of the external contour (68) of the movable closure member (50) and to the<br>
effective sealing section of the gasket (56) allows to regulate the force of the pressure in<br>
the chamber (36) on the movable closure member (50).<br>
The reactions of the Belleville washers (49) and the gasket (56), compressed by the<br>
movable closure member (50), act against said force.<br>
The number and the planing of the Belleville washers (49) and the planing of the gasket<br>
(56) define the equilibrium of the movable closure member (50) on which the opposite<br>
forces, due to the pressure in the chamber (36) and of the Belleville washers (49)<br>
together with the gasket (56), act.<br>
This combination of planing and numbers of components allows to predetermine both<br>
the acting threshold and the signalling of the device inside the range from 0,05 to 3 MPa<br>
with sufficiently precision.<br>
An annular gasket (35) separates the chamber (36), located between the wall (27) and<br>
the system (26), from the chamber (37), found between the centring sleeve (25) and the<br>
environment, the chamber (37) communicating with the environment through a hole (not<br>
represented) at the basis of the threaded body (11). This gasket (35) co-operates with<br>
the spring (24) in order to realise the same function of the bellows of EP-A 0 893 284.<br>
The unscrewing of the system (1) acting on the external envelope (12) is prevented by<br>
the free tripper, on condition that the treaded body is clamped by screwing causing a<br>
clamping torque the value of which is higher than the torque capable of being<br>
transmitted towards the unscrewing, which exists even if rather low. In order to assure a<br>
stronger clamping torque, more than the usual friction between the portions, which are<br>
connected by the screw thread when both ends of said portions come in contact, it is<br>
possible to use further details, as, for example, an elastic washer (34) interposed<br><br>
between the end (10) of the valve (2) and the upper wall (29) of the threaded body (11).<br>
With reference to Fig. 3, an axial hole (69) is provided in the wall (29); said axial hole<br>
(69) connecting the downwards portion of the gasket (23), with respect to the chamber<br>
(8), with the chamber (64). In case of sealing loss of the gasket (23), the gas tends to<br>
come into the chamber (64) acting on the active section of the diaphragm (53) causing an<br>
additional pushing with respect to the pushing of the Belleville washers (49) increasing<br>
the acting threshold.<br>
Therefore, the signalling of the exceeding of the threshold occurs before the effective<br>
pressure in the tire decreases under the predetermined threshold value. So doing it is<br>
possible to distinguish the unloading due to the sealing loss of the gasket (23) with<br>
respect to the unloading due to a decreasing of the effective pressure in the tire under<br>
the predetermined threshold value.<br>
Fig. 3, showing the unloaded device, discloses a safety system to prevent gas-leak from<br>
the tire through the device, in case the system (26), after unloading, cannot go up.<br>
When the device is unloaded, but the system (26) in failure does not release the closure<br>
member (5) and, therefore, the chamber (8) is still connected to the tire, without the<br>
safety system (here following disclosed), the gas indefinitely comes out from the<br>
chamber (8) until the whole deflation of the tire.<br>
A cylindrical self-closing closure member (70) located in the hole (63) is pushed by the<br>
spring (71) against the gasket (56), to define a sealing when the movable closure member<br>
(50) is unloading condition. On the contrary, when the movable closure member (50) is<br>
loaded, a laminar protuberance (72) extending the hub (51) moves away the cylindrical<br>
self-closing closure member (70) from the gasket (56) allowing the connection between<br>
the chamber (8) and the chamber (36).<br>
A further regulation of the acting threshold of the device is reached by a screw (61)<br>
screwed in the hole (62) of Fig. 4. By means of this screw the pushing of the spring (71)<br>
is regulated; said pushing moves the cylindrical self-closing closure member (70) against<br>
the gasket (56). Said pushing acts on the laminar protuberance (72) of the movable<br>
closure member (50) when this one is loaded, in addition to the pushing of the Belleville<br>
washers (49).<br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1. A system for predetermining the operating threshold of a device surveying<br>
the radial deformation state of a tire, comprising:<br>
a closure member (50) in equilibrium under a first force due to the<br>
pressure of a tire chamber (36) acting on a first side of the tire chamber (36)<br>
and a second force due to the environmental pressure (64) together with the<br>
force of a Belleville washer (49) on a second side of the tire chamber (36);<br>
characterized in that the Belleville washer (49) rests its external perimeter on<br>
the external part of a plate (48) and its internal perimeter on the internal part<br>
of the plate (48) when the system is loaded; and<br>
in that the closure member (50) on which the environmental pressure (64)<br>
and the Belleville washer (49) acts, determines the pressure value inside the<br>
tire chamber (36) capable of upsetting the equilibrium of the forces with a<br>
pressure value inside the tire chamber (36) that is lower or identical to a pre-<br>
established threshold.<br>
2. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the Belleville washer (49) is preloaded<br>
with a threshold pressure value defined during the mounting of the<br>
system.<br><br>
3. The system as claimed in claim 2, wherein the Belleville washer (49) is pre-<br>
loaded by use of an adjusting screw (61).<br><br>
This invention relates to system for predetermining the operating threshold of a<br>
device surveying the radial deformation state of a tire. The fact that it comprises<br>
a closure member (50) in equilibrium under the force due to the pressure of the<br>
tire chamber (36) acting on a side and the force due to the environmental<br>
pressure (64) together with the force of springs (49) on the other side, the<br>
section of the closure member (50) on which the pressure and springs (49)<br>
forces act, determines the pressure value inside the tire chamber (36) capable of<br>
upsetting the equilibrium of the forces with a pressure value lower or identical<br>
than a pre-established threshold.</td>
