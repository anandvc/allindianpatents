				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PENAM COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for<br>
producing a penam compound.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The 2α-methyl-2β-[(1,2,3-triazol-l-yl)methyl]penam-3α<br>
carboxylic acid ester represented by formula (2)<br>
wherein R is a penicillin carboxyl protecting group,<br>
is a compound that is useful, for example, as an intermediate for<br>
producing a β-lactamase inhibitor.<br>
The compound that is represented by formula (2) can be<br>
produced, for example, by reacting a 2'-halogenated penam<br>
compound represented by formula (1)<br>
wherein X represents chlorine or bromine and R is as defined above, with 1,2,3-triazole (see Patent Document 1).<br>
According to the Patent Document 1, a 2'-halogenated<br>
penam compound of formula (1) is reacted with 1,2,3-triazole in a solvent such as dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, acetone,tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, methanol, ethanol, etc., under<br>
temperature conditions in the range of 0°C to 60°C.<br>
However, when the 2'-halogenated penam compound of<br>
formula (1) is reacted with 1,2,3-triazole as described in Patent<br>
Document 1, a large amount of the by-product cepham compound represented by formula (3) is unavoidably generated as an isomer,<br>
with the result that the desired 2α-methyl-2β[(1,2, 3-triazol-lyl)<br>
methyl ]penam-3α-carboxylic acid ester represented by formula<br>
(2) cannot be obtained with a high yield.<br>
wherein R is as defined above.<br>
Therefore, the development of an industrially<br>
advantageous process is desired that is capable of remarkably<br>
suppressing the generation of the by-product cepham compound of<br>
formula (3) to efficiently produce the 2oc-methyl-2f3- [ (1, 2, 3-<br>
triazol-1-yl)methyl]penam-3α-carboxylic acid ester of formula (2) .<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Examined Patent Publication No.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an<br>
industrially advantageous process that is capable of remarkably<br>
suppressing the generation of the by-product cepham compound<br>
represented by formula (3) to thereby efficiently produce the<br>
desired 2α -methyl-2β-[(1,2,3-triazol-l-yl)methyl]penam-3α carboxylic<br>
acid ester represented by formula (2).<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
The present inventors conducted extensive research in<br>
order to achieve the above object. As a result, the inventors<br>
found that when a 2'-halogenated penam compound represented by<br>
formula (1), wherein R is diphenylmethyl and X is bromine, is<br>
used as a starting material and the penam compound is reacted<br>
with 1,2,3-triazole in a specific reaction solvent under specific<br>
temperature conditions, the generation of the by-product cepham<br>
compound of formula (3), wherein R is diphenylmethyl, can be<br>
remarkably suppressed, so that the compound of formula (2),<br>
wherein R is diphenylmethyl, can be efficiently produced, thereby<br>
achieving the object of the invention. The present invention has<br>
been accomplished based on this finding.<br>
The present invention provides the following production<br>
processes shown in items 1 to 5:<br>
Item 1. A process for preparing a diphenylmethyl 2α methyl-2β-[(1,2,3-triazol-l-yl) methyl]penam-3-α carboxylate comprising a step of reacting a diphenylmethyl 2β-bromomethyl-2α-methylpenam-<br>
3α-carboxylate with 1,2,3-triazole in a halogenated<br>
hydrocarbon solvent at -5°C or lower.<br>
Item 2. The process according to item 1 wherein the<br>
reaction is carried out in a mixed solvent of a halogenated<br>
hydrocarbon and a lower alcohol.<br>
Item 3. The process according to item 1 wherein the<br>
reaction is carried out in the presence of a base.<br>
Item 4. The process according to item 3 wherein the<br>
base is an anion exchange resin.<br>
Item 5. The process according to item 1 wherein the<br>
reaction is carried out at -5°C to -20°C.<br>
The production process of the invention can be<br>
illustrated by the following reaction scheme:<br>
Reaction scheme-1<br>
 wherein Ph is phenyl.<br>
As shown in Reaction scheme-1, the diphenylmethyl 2α ctmethyl-<br>
2β- [ (1,2, 3-triazol-l-yl) methyl] penam-3α-carboxylate<br>
represented by formula (5)(hereinafter sometimes referred to as<br>
"TMPB") can be produced by reacting a diphenylmethyl 2β-<br>
bromomethyl-2α-methylpenam-3α-carboxylate (hereinafter sometimes<br>
referred to as "BMPB") with 1,2,3-triazole.<br>
A feature of the process of the invention is the use of<br>
BMPB represented by formula (4) as a starting material.<br>
When the 2'-halogenated penam compound of formula (1),<br>
wherein R is diphenylmethyl and X is chlorine, is used as a<br>
starting material, it is impossible to achieve the object of the<br>
invention, even if the reaction is performed using the same<br>
reaction solvent under the same temperature conditions as those<br>
of the present invention. Similarly, even when a 2'-halogenated<br>
penam compound of formula (1), wherein R is diphenylmethyl and X<br>
is bromine, is used as a starting material, it is impossible to<br>
achieve the object of the invention, if the reaction is performed<br>
using a reaction solvent different from that of the present<br>
invention or under reaction conditions different from those of<br>
the present invention.<br>
BMPB of formula (4) used as a starting material in the<br>
invention is a known compound, and can be easily produced<br>
according to known methods, such as the method disclosed in<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1983-4788, etc.<br>
The reaction of the invention is performed in a<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon solvent.<br><br>
Examples of halogenated hydrocarbons preferably used<br>
include dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, etc.<br>
Dichloromethane and chloroform are particularly preferable. Such<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons can be used singly or in a combination<br>
of two or more.<br>
The amount of halogenated hydrocarbon used is usually<br>
about 1 to about 50 liters, and preferably about 5 to about 10<br>
liters, per kg of BMPB represented by formula (4).<br>
When the reaction is carried out in a mixed solvent of<br>
a halogenated hydrocarbon and a lower alcohol according to the<br>
invention, the generation of the by-product cepham compound of<br>
formula (3), wherein R is diphenylmethyl, can be further<br>
suppressed.<br>
Examples of lower alcohols include C1-4 lower alcohols<br>
such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc. Such lower alcohols can be used singly or in a combination of two or more. <br>
The proportion of lower alcohol to halogenated<br>
hydrocarbon may be about 0.01 to about 1 liter, and preferably<br>
about 0.1 to about 0.3 liters, of lower alcohol per liter of<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon.<br>
The reaction of the invention is preferably performed<br>
in the presence of a base.<br>
Examples of bases that can be used include alkali metal<br>
carbonates, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, etc.;<br>
alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, such as sodium hydrogencarbonate,<br>
potassium hydrogencarbonate, etc.; alkaline earth metal<br>
carbonates, such as calcium carbonate, etc.; anion exchange<br>
resins; etc. Such bases can be used singly or in a combination of<br>
two or more.<br>
Among such bases, anion exchange resins are preferable.<br>
Weakly basic anion exchange resins are particularly preferable.<br>
Examples of weakly basic anion exchange resins include<br>
styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers, styrene-acrylamide copolymers,<br>
etc. Specific examples include Amberlite IRA67, Amberlite IRA96SB,<br>
Amberlite XE583, and Amberlite XT6050RF manufactured by Organo<br>
Corp.; Diaion WA10, Diaion WA11, Diaion WA20, Diaion WA21 and<br>
Diaion WA30 manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical, Corporation; etc.<br>
Such a base is usually used in an amount of about 0.5<br>
to about 5 equivalents, and preferably about 1 to about 2<br>
equivalents, per equivalent of BMPB of formula (4). When an anion<br>
exchange resin is used, the amount is preferably about 0.5 to<br>
about 5 equivalents, and more preferably about 1 to about 2<br>
equivalents, per equivalent of BMPB, expressed as a titer.<br>
In the present invention, it is necessary to perform<br>
the reaction at -5°C or lower. When the reaction is performed at<br>
temperatures higher than -5°C, the generation of an isomer<br>
represented by formula (3) cannot be sufficiently suppressed.<br>
Although it is advantageous to perform the reaction at<br>
temperatures lower than -20°C in terms of suppressing the<br>
generation of the by-product isomer represented by formula (3),<br>
it takes a long time to complete the reaction. Therefore, the<br>
reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range<br>
of -5°C to -20°C in the invention.<br>
The reaction of the invention is usually completed in 5<br>
hours or more, and preferably in about 10 to about 24 hours.<br>
The desired compound obtained by the invention can be<br>
easily isolated from the reaction mixture by commonly used<br>
isolation techniques such as filtration, solvent extraction, recrystallization,<br>
etc., and can be easily purified by commonly<br>
used purification techniques such as column chromatography, etc.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of the invention can remarkably suppress<br>
the generation of the by-product cepham compound represented by<br>
formula (3), wherein R is diphenylmethyl, and thereby efficiently<br>
produce the compound of formula (2), wherein R is diphenylmethyl.<br>
Therefore, the present invention can provide an<br>
industrially advantageous process for producing the compound<br>
represented by formula (2), wherein R is diphenylmethyl.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples are given below to<br>
describe the invention in more detail. However, the invention is<br>
not limited to the Examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
180 ml of 1,2,3-triazole, 129.5 ml (titer: 1.06 meq/ml)<br>
of an anion exchange resin ("Diaion WA30, manufactured by<br>
Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation), and 118 ml of methanol were<br>
placed in a 1,000-ml reaction vessel. The resulting mixture was<br>
cooled to -7°C and 400 ml of a dichloromethane solution containing<br>
52.1 g of a diphenylmethyl 2β-bromomethyl-2α-methylpenam-3α-carboxylate(BMPB) was added at this temperature. The reaction was allowed to proceed while stirring at -5°C for 17 hours. After completion of the reaction, the anion exchange resin was filtered<br>
off and washed with a small amount of dichloromethane. This wash<br>
and filtrate were washed with water four times to yield a<br>
dichloromethane solution containing a diphenylmethyl 2a-methyl-<br>
2β-[(1,2,3-triazol-l-yl)methyl]penam-3α-carboxylate (TMPB).<br>
The proportions of TMPB and by-product diphenylmethyl<br>
3-methyl-3-(1,2,3-triazol-l-yl)cepham-4-carboxylate (TCB)<br>
generated in the dichloromethane solution were determined by<br>
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The proportions of TMPB and TCB in the dichloromethane<br>
solution were TMPB/TCB =6.34/1.<br>
Example 2<br>
A dichloromethane solution containing TMPB was prepared<br>
in the same manner as in Example 1 except that chloroform was<br>
used instead of dichloromethane.<br>
The proportions of TMPB and by-product TCB generated in<br>
the dichloromethane solution were determined by HPLC.<br>
The proportions of TMPB and TCB in the dichloromethane<br>
solution were TMPB/TCB = 6.41/1.<br>
Example 3<br>
1.00 g of BMPB, 3.6 ml of 1,2,3-triazole, 2.6 ml of an<br>
anion exchange resin (Diaion WA30), and 8 ml of dichloromethane<br>
were placed in a 100-ml reaction vessel, and the resulting<br>
mixture was stirred at -5°C for 17 hours. After completion of the<br>
reaction, the anion exchange resin was filtered off and washed<br>
with a small amount of dichloromethane. This wash and filtrate<br>
were washed with water four times to yield a dichloromethane<br>
solution containing TMPB.<br>
The proportions of TMPB and by-product TCB generated in<br>
the dichloromethane solution were determined by HPLC.<br>
The proportions of TMPB and TCB in the dichloromethane<br>
solution were TMPB/TCB = 5.62/1.<br>
Example 4<br>
A dichloromethane solution containing TMPB was prepared<br>
in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the reaction was<br>
performed at -15°C while stirring for 17 hours.<br>
The proportions of TMPB and by-product TCB generated in<br>
the dichloromethane solution were determined by HPLC.<br>
The proportions of TMPB and TCB in the dichloromethane<br>
solution were TMPB/TCB = 7.01/1.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A diphenylmethyl 2β-chloromethyl-2α-methylpenam-3α-carboxylate<br>
(CMPB) and 1,2,3-triazole were reacted in the same<br>
manner as in Example 4 of the Patent Document 1. More<br>
specifically, 1.00 g of CMPB, 3.6 ml of 1,2,3-triazole, 2.6 ml of<br>
an anion exchange resin ("Diaion WA30"), 5.3 ml of acetone, and<br>
1.8 ml of water were placed in a 30-ml reaction vessel, and the<br>
resulting mixture was stirred at 40°C for 3 hours. After<br>
completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled, and<br>
the anion exchange resin was filtered off and washed with a small<br>
amount of dichloromethane. This wash and filtrate were combined<br>
and extracted with 200 ml of dichloromethane.<br>
The proportions of TMPB and by-product TCB generated in<br>
the extraction were determined by HPLC.<br>
The proportions of TMPB and TCB in the dichloromethane<br>
extract were TMPB/TCB = 4.55/1.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
43.5 g of CMPB, 200 ml of 1,2,3-triazole, 129.5 ml of<br>
an anion exchange resin ("Diaion WA30"), and 700 ml of<br>
dichloromethane were placed in a 2,000-ml reaction vessel, and<br>
the resulting mixture was stirred at 40°C for 3 hours. After<br>
completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled, and<br>
the anion exchange resin was filtered off and washed with a small<br>
amount of dichloromethane.<br>
The resulting wash and filtrate were combined, and the<br>
proportions of TMPB and by-product TCB in the mixture of wash and<br>
filtrate were determined by HPLC.<br>
The proportions of TMPB and TCB in the dichloromethane<br>
solution were TMPB/TCB = 4.20/1.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
The reaction was performed in the same manner as in<br>
Example 1 except that CMPB was used instead of BMPB. The reaction<br>
between CMPB and 1,2,3-triazole did not proceed, and TMPB was not<br>
generated.<br><br><br><br>
