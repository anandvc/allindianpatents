COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10, and rule 13)<br>
1.	TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING CALCIUM CARBONATE MATERIALS HAVING A PARTICLE SURFACE WITH IMPROVED ADSORPTION PROPERTIES<br>
2.	APPLICANT(S)<br>
a)	Name        : OMYA DEVELOPMENT AG<br>
b)	Nationality ; SWISS Company<br>
c)	Address     : BASLERSTRASSE 42,<br>
CH-4 665 OFTRINGEN, SWITZERLAND<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br>
 <br>
The present invention relates to the technical sector of suspensions of carbonate-containing material or dried mineral materials and their applications in the fields of paper, paint and plastics and more particularly their applications in the paper industry, like the manufacturing or the production and/or coating of paper sheets.<br>
In the manufacturing method of a sheet of paper, cardboard or analogous product, one skilled in the art increasingly tends to replace part of the expensive cellulose fibres by cheaper mineral matter in order to reduce the cost of the paper while improving its properties.<br>
This calcium carbonate- containing material, with which one skilled in the art is well familiar comprises, for example natural calcium carbonate (GCC) such as marble, calcite, limestone and/or chalk, and/or synthetic calcium carbonate (PCC) such as scalenohedral and/or rhombohedral and/or calcific and/or vateritic crystal forms and miscellaneous analogous fillers containing calcium carbonates such as dolomite or mixed carbonate based fillers of various metals such as, in particular, calcium associated with magnesium and analogues, various matter such as talc or analogues, and mixtures of these fillers, such as, for example talc-calcium carbonate or calcium carbonate-kaolin mixtures, or mixtures of natural calcium carbonate with aluminium hydroxide, mica or with synthetic or natural fibres or co-structures of minerals such as talc-calcium carbonate or talc-titanium dioxide co-structures.<br>
For a long time now, it has been quite common to use in a wet grinding process , as grinding aid agents, water soluble polymers based on partially or totally neutralised polyacrylic acid or its derivatives (EP 0 046 573, EP 0100 947, EP 0 100 948, EP 0 129 329, EP 0 261 039, EP 0 516 656, EP 0 542 643, EP 0 542 644) to provide aqueous mineral suspensions, but these grinding aid agents do not allow to obtain the requested above-mentioned refinement and viscosity criteria or do not allow to obtain the requested stability of the pH of the aqueous mineral suspensions over time or do not have sufficient capability of developing scattering visible light as required by the end user in paper application.<br>
 <br>
The skilled man knows another type of solution disclosed in WO 02/49766, EP 0 850 685, WO 2008/010055, WO 2007/072168 to obtain aqueous suspensions of refined mineral material, with a dry matter concentration that can be high, while having a low Brookfield™ viscosity that remains stable over time. This known type of solution disclosed the use of specific dispersants like copolymers of acrylic acid with maleic acid or like particular rate of neutralization or like the use of inorganic fluorine compound used to put into aqueous suspension of the mineral particles issuing from the mechanical and/or thermal concentration step following a step of wet grinding at a low solid content without the use of dispersing agent nor grinding aid.<br>
Additionally, the skilled man in the art knows the US 3,006,779, which discloses a completely different solution based on an inorganic dispersant consisting of a homogeneous mixture of sodium phosphate glass, zinc oxide and a potassium or lithium salt or hydroxide.<br>
In the same way the WO 2006/081501 teaches the use of inorganic dispersant like lithium silicate.<br>
Finally, the dissertation entitled "Influence of polyelectrolyte adsorption on rheology of concentrated calcite dispersion" (Robert Petzenhauser-1993) which studies the influence of different polyacrylates with regard to the calcite suspension confirms that difficulties exist in term of the stability of viscosity of the resulting suspensions with all the studied polyacrylates, including lithium polyacrylates.<br>
Nevertheless none of the known solutions provides the skilled man with a solution to the problem of achieving calcium carbonate-containing material be it in a dry form or in the form of a suspension having a dry matter concentration that can be high, while having a low Brookfield™ viscosity that remains stable over rime, and a good pH buffer capacity as well as allowing to work at reduced dispersant or grinding aid agent content and/or increased solid content, wherein the calcium<br>
 <br>
carbonate materials have a particle surface with improved adsorption properties of dispersants.<br>
Thus, one object of the present invention is to provide a process for manufacturing calcium carbonate materials having a particle surface with improved adsorption properties of dispersants for high stability suspensions.<br>
Furthermore, it is highly desirable that in such a process, no compounds are added, which might react in an uncontrollable manner in the environment, in which they are used.<br>
For example there are ionic compounds which tend to form water insoluble salts, hydroxides or oxides or complexes with further compounds in certain pH ranges.<br>
Therefore, it is a further object of the present invention to provide a process, which uses compounds, which do not undergo any undesirable side reactions in the environment of the mineral materials, especially in the aqueous environment thereof, i.e. that compounds such as those in the form of a salt do not undergo any side- reactions, but remain unchanged regarding their ionic components, be it in the salt form or dissociated form.<br>
Faced with the above-mentioned problems of obtaining an aqueous mineral calcium carbonate-containing material suspensions with the required properties while minimizing the dispersant and/or grinding aid agent demand without decreasing the properties of the final products like the optical properties of the paper, the Applicant found surprisingly that certain lithium ion-containing compounds act as adsorption properties modifier of the surface of the calcium carbonate particles permitting to obtain aqueous calcium carbonate-containing material suspensions having a pH stable over time, and which can have a high dry solids content and a low and stable Brookfield viscosity.<br>
 <br>
Without being bound by any theory, the Applicant believes that the use of certain lithium ion-containing compounds modifies the surface of the particles of the calcium carbonate-containing material and consequently modifies the adsorption properties of the surface of the calcium carbonate particle, whatever the nature of the calcium carbonate-containing material is.<br>
Nevertheless, while the presence of these lithium compounds modifies the adsorption properties of the calcium carbonate at this low level of lithium content the incorporation of this element, and especially the below-mentioned lithium compounds has mainly no visible impact on the crystal shape of the pigment under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures and/or the specific surface or XRD pattern of the pigment.<br>
Thus, the above object is achieved by a process for manufacturing calcium carbonate materials having a particle surface with improved adsorption properties of dispersants comprising the steps of:<br>
a.	providing at least one calcium carbonate comprising material in the form of<br>
an aqueous suspension or in dry form,<br>
b.	providing at least one lithium ion containing compound selected from the<br>
group consisting of lithium hydroxide or lithium oxide or inorganic and/or<br>
organic monomeric lithium salts selected from the group comprising mono-<br>
and/or polyvalent acid salts such as lithium carbonate, lithium sulphates,<br>
lithium citrate, lithium hydrogen carbonate, lithium acetate, lithium chloride,<br>
lithium phosphates, in dry form or in aqueous solution, and mixtures thereof,<br>
c.	combining the at least one lithium ion containing compound of step b) with<br>
the at least one calcium carbonate material of step a).<br>
The lithium salts of di- or tribasic monomeric acids can also be mixed salts, e.g. of lithium and sodium such as in (Na,Li)3P04/ e.g. Olympite or Nalipoite.<br>
 <br>
The resulting calcium carbonate material may be in a dry form or in the form of a suspension. They may be dried or resuspended after having been dried, as can be taken from any of the following preferred embodiments.<br>
The at least one calcium carbonate comprising material for use in the present invention preferably is provided in the form of synthetic calcium carbonate (PCC) obtained from at least one calcium ion source and at least one carbonate, hydrogen carbonate and/or CO2 source, or in the form of a natural carbonate containing mineral material (GCC).<br>
Especially suitable calcium carbonate containing material is selected from the group comprising natural calcium carbonate (GCC) such as marble, calcite, limestone and/ or chalk; precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) like vaterite and/or calcite; and calcium carbonate-containing minerals such as dolomite or mixed carbonate based fillers such as, in particular, calcium associated with magnesium and analogues or derivatives, various matter such as clay or talc or analogues or derivatives, and mixtures thereof such as, for example, talc-calcium carbonate or calcium carbonate-kaolin mixtures, or mixtures of natural calcium carbonate with aluminium hydroxide, mica or with synthetic or natural fibres or co-structures of minerals such as talc- calcium carbonate or talc-titanium dioxide co-structures.<br>
Most preferably, the at least one calcium carbonate material is a natural calcium carbonate (GCC) or a precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) or a mixture of GCC and PCC, or a mixture of GCC and PCC and clay, or a mixture of GCC and PCC and talc, and most preferably is a GCC chosen among marble, chalk, calcite or limestone or a PCC chosen among calcific PCC like rhombohedral PCC or scalenohedral PCC.<br>
The above process can be improved by a number of optional steps:<br>
Thus, e.g., by grinding and/or dispersing methods at reduced dispersant content and/or increased solid content, manufacturing methods of aqueous suspension of<br>
 <br>
calcium carbonate containing material particles implementing said lithium ion-containing compound selected as adsorption properties modifier of the surface of the calcium carbonate particles, the manufacturing process can be optimized.<br>
An especially preferred embodiment includes a grinding step, wherein the at least one calcium carbonate material is ground, optionally in the presence of dispersants and/or grinding aids (step d).<br>
Dispersants or grinding aids used according to the present invention may be any conventional organic dispersants such as sodium polyacrylate homopolymers and/or copolymers and polymaleinates, etc. They are preferably in the non-neutralised and/o partially neutralized form. Preferred dispersants are, e.g. partially neutralised totally neutralised, and especially non-neutralized polyacrylic acids. "Non- neutralised" means that all of the carboxylic groups are present as the free acids, while partially neutralised means that a part of the carboxylic acid groups are transformed into a salt, and totally neutralized means that all carboxylic acid groups are neutralised. Neutralized groups may be present in a dissociated, partially dissociated or non-dissociated form.<br>
It is preferred that, in step d), the at least one lithium ion containing compound is present.<br>
If GCC is used in step d), it may be preferred to subject the wet ground natural calcium carbonate to a wet beneficiation step prior to step d), allowing the removal of impurities, such as silicate impurities, for instance by froth flotation.<br>
Furthermore, it can be advantageous that the ground material obtained from step d) is screened and/or Concentrated (step e).<br>
"Screening" in the context of the present invention is implemented by the well known devices for "screening" like sieves, grit centrifuges, etc.. By "screening", it has<br>
 <br>
to be understood a beneficiation by removing coarse particles having a particle size of more than 45 μm.<br>
"Upconcentration" is conducted, e.g. by a thermal concentration or a mechanical concentration such as by means of a centrifuge, filter-press, tube-press or a mixture thereof.<br>
If the ground material is screened and/ or concentrated according to step e), it may be preferred to disperse the material in an aqueous medium subsequent to screening and/or concentrating (step f), wherein it is even more preferred, if dispersing is performed in the presence of the at least one lithium ion containing compound, which can be different or the same as the one used for step d).<br>
The ground material obtained from any one of steps d) or e) or f) may be dried, if the calcium carbonate material of step a) is provided in the form of an aqueous suspension (step g).<br>
On the other hand, if the calcium carbonate material of step a) is provided in the dry form, or when steps e), f) and g) are not performed, the ground material obtained from step d) can be dispersed in an aqueous medium (step h).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the aqueous suspension obtained from step h may be ground (step i).<br>
Furthermore, the dried material of step g), may be redispersed in an aqueous medium (step j).<br>
In especially preferred embodiments, step i) and/or step j) is performed in the presence of at least one lithium ion-containing compound.<br>
 <br>
Generally, regarding the addition of the at least one lithium ion-containing compound, there are several preferred embodiments.<br>
For example, the at least one lithium ion-containing Compound can be added before and/or during and/or after step a), if the at least one calcium carbonate material is PCC.<br>
Thus, the lithium compound can also be added before, during or after the precipitation of the synthetic calcium carbonate. For Example, the lithium compound can be added prior to the carbonisation step.<br>
On the other hand, if the at least one calcium carbonate material is GCC, the at least one lithium ion containing compound is preferably added before and/or during and/or after grinding step d), if steps e) and f) are not carried out.<br>
The at least one lithium ion containing compound may however also be added after grinding step d) and before and/or during and/or after screening and/or concentrating step e), if step e) is performed alone.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to add the at least one lithium ion containing compound before and/or during and/or after dispersing step f).<br>
If the calcium carbonate material is provided in the dry form in step a) followed successively by steps d) and h), it is preferred that the addition of the lithium ion-containing compound is performed in a single addition before, during or after step d) or is made in multiple additions, each of them before, during or after the step h).<br>
If dispersing step f) is performed and if all or part of the quantity of the lithium ion-containing compound is added before step f), the lithium ion-containing compound is preferably added before and/or during and/or after the step d).<br>
 <br>

In this respect, the skilled man will easily determine that the pH value will have suitable values in function of the properties he wishes to achieve, knowing that it is influenced by the addition of a base, preferably of a base of a mono or divalent cation, most preferably of sodium or calcium, e.g. by the addition of an alkaline preparation of a biocide, or by the release of hydroxide, such a Ca(OH)2, during grinding of a material, such as during the co- grinding of precipitated calcium carbonate and natural calcium carbonate.<br>

When there is no step e), f) or g), all of the quantity of the at least one lithium ion-containing compound preferably is used before grinding step d), a part of the at least one lithium ion-containing compound is used before grinding step d), while the remaining quantity is added during step d).<br>
Also, a combination of different lithium ion-containing compounds can be advantageously used. When a dispersing agent is used, the amount of the at least one lithium ion containing compound used ranges from 0.01 % to 5 %, preferably from 0.05 % to 2 %, most preferably from 0.1 % to 1 % by dry weight relative to the dry weight of the calcium carbonate material.<br>

Said aqueous suspension may result from the dispersion of material in the form of a filter-cake.<br>
Especially preferably, step d) is performed at a solids, content of from 10 wt% to 35 wt%, based on the total weight of the suspension, in the absence of any dispersants or grinding aids, and is performed at a solids content of from 60 wt% to 82 wt%, based on the total weight of the suspension, in the presence of dispersants and/or grinding aids.<br>

A measure for the scattering of light is the scattering coefficient S. S should be greater than 110 m2/kg for a coating weight of 20 g/m2 reflecting the ability of a coating to scatter visible light. It might be measured e.g. according to the method described in WO 02/49766 (p. 8 to 10). Accordingly, the ability to scatter light is expressed by the Kubelka-Munk light scattering coefficient, determined by the method, well-known to experts, described in the publications of Kubelka and Munk (Zeitschrift fur Technische Physik 12,539, (1931)), de Kubelka (J.Optical Soc.Am. 38(5),448, (1948) et J.Optical Soc.Am. 44(4)330,(1954)).<br>

This test concerns the preparation of a rhombohedral PCC of a dso of 0.3 um.<br>
In view of such, 200 kg of calcium oxide (Tagger Kalk, Golling A) are added to 1700 litres of 40°C-tap water in a stirred reactor; the reactor contents are mixed under continuous stirring for 30 minutes and the resulting slurry of calcium hydroxide ("milk of lime") at 13.1 % w/w solids is then screened on a 100 μm screen.<br>
 <br>
The calcium carbonate precipitation is conducted in a 1800 litre cylindrical stainless steel reactor equipped with an agitator and probes for monitoring the pH and conductivity of the suspension.<br>
1700 litres of the calcium hydroxide suspension obtained in the slaking step as stated above are added to the carbonating reactor and the temperature of the reaction mixture is adjusted to the desired starting temperature of 16°C.<br>
A gas of 20-30% by volume of CO2 in air is then bubbled upwards through the suspension at a rate of 200 m3/h under a suspension agitation between 200 and 300 rpm. Overpressure in gas feed is 150-200 mbar, corresponding to hydrostatic pressure of Ca(OH)2 suspension in the reactor.<br>
During carbonation, the temperature of the suspension is not controlled and allowed to rise due to the heat generated in the exothermic precipitation reaction. After conductivity reached a minimum gassing is continued for another 4 minutes and then stopped.<br>
The 16.7% w/w solids aqueous slurry of precipitated calcium carbonate obtained by this carbonation step is subsequently screened on a 45 uni screen and fed to a centrifuge for mechanical dewatering. The filter cake discharged by the centrifuge is redispersed in water and made-down into a 47.2% w/w slurry. During slurry make-down 1.0% w/w (calculated as dry matter on dry calcium carbonate) of a sodium polyacrylate-based anionic dispersing aid having an Mw of 12500 and a polydispersity of 2.8 is added to the mixture.<br>
The slurry is then forced to pass through a vertical attritor mill (1.4 litre Dynomill™), containing 0.6-1.2 mm ZrO beads as media, to de-agglomerate the primarily clustered precipitated calcium carbonate into discrete particles in order to obtain an average particle size d50 of about 0.3 pm {Micromeritics Sedigraph™ 5100) after milling.<br>
 <br>
The resulting slurry of discrete ultrafine precipitated calcium carbonate is then further upconcentrated in a vacuum evaporator to obtain final slurry solids of 66.7% w/w solids.<br>
