				<td>A RECEIVER FOR USE WITH A GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM<br>
(GNSS) THAT TRANSMITS ALTERNATE BINARY OFFSET (AltBOC) SIGNALS<br>
AND A METHOD OF DETERMINING GLOBAL POSITION FROM SAID AltBOC<br>
SIGNALS RECEIVED FROM THE GNSS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to GNSS receivers and, in particular, to receivers that operate<br>
with Galileo AltBOC satellite signals, and to a method of determining global position from said<br>
AltBOC signals received from the GNSS.<br>
Background Information<br>
Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, such as GPS receivers, determine<br>
their global positions based on the signals received from orbiting GPS and other satellites. The<br>
GPS satellites, for example, transmit signals using two carriers, namely, an LI carrier at<br>
1575.42 MHz and an L2 carrier at 1227.60 MHz. Each carrier is modulated by at least a binary<br>
pseudorandom (PRN). code, which consists of a seemingly random sequence of ones and zeros<br>
that periodically repeat. The ones and zeros in the PRN code are referred to as "code chips,"<br>
and the transitions in the code from one to zero or zero to one, which occur at "code chip<br>
times," are referred to as "bit transitions." Each GPS satellite uses a unique PRN code, and<br>
thus, a GPS receiver can associate a received signal with a particular satellite by determining<br>
which PRN code is included in the signal.<br>
The GPS receiver calculates the difference between the time a satellite transmits its signal<br>
and the time that the receiver receives the signal. The receiver then calculates its distance, or<br>
"pseudorange," from the satellite based on the associated time difference. Using the<br>
pseudoranges from at least four satellites, the receiver determines its global position.<br>
To determine the time difference, the GPS receiver synchronizes a locally<br>
generated PRN code with the PRN code in the received signal by aligning the code<br>
chips in each of the codes. The GPS receiver then determines how much the locally-<br>
generated PRN code is shifted, in time, from the known timing of the satellite PRN<br><br>
code at the time of transmission, and calculates the associated pseudorange. The more<br>
closely the GPS receiver aligns the locally-generated PRN code with the PRN code in<br>
the received signal, the more precisely the GPS receiver can determine the associated<br>
time difference and pseudorange and, in turn, its global position.<br>
The code synchronization operations include acquisition of the satellite PRN<br>
code and tracking the code. To acquire the PRN code, the GPS receiver generally<br>
makes a series of correlation measurements that are separated in time by a code chip.<br>
After acquisition, the GPS receiver tracks the received code. It generally makes "early-<br>
minus-late" correlation measurements, i.e., measurements of the difference between (i)<br>
a correlation measurement associated with the PRN code in the received signal and an<br>
early version of the locally-generated PRN code, and (ii) a correlation measurement<br>
associated with the PRN code in the received signal and a late version of the local PRN<br>
code. The GPS receiver then uses the early-minus-late measurements in a delay lock<br>
loop (DLL), which produces an error signal that is proportional to the misalignment<br>
between the local and the received PRN codes. The error signal is used, in turn, to<br>
control the PRN code generator, which shifts the local PRN code essentially to<br>
minimize the DLL error signal.<br>
The GPS receiver also typically aligns the satellite carrier with a local carrier<br>
using correlation measurements associated with a punctual version of the local PRN<br>
code. To do this the receiver uses a carrier tracking phase lock loop.<br>
A GPS receiver receives not only line-of-sight, or direct path, satellite signals<br>
but also multipath signals, which are signals that travel along different paths and are<br>
reflected to the receiver from the ground, bodies of water, nearby buildings, etc. The<br>
multipath signals arrive at the GPS receiver after the direct-path signal and combine<br>
with the direct-path signal to produce a distorted received signal. This distortion of the<br>
received signal adversely affects code synchronization operations because the<br>
correlation measurements, which measure the correlation between the local PRN code<br>
and the received signal, are based on the entire received signal - including the multipath<br>
components thereof. The distortion may be such that the GPS receiver attempts to<br>
synchronize to a multipath signal instead of to the direct-path signal. This is<br>
particularly true for multipath signals that have code bit transitions that occur close to<br>
the times at which code bit transitions occur in the direct-path signal.<br><br>
One way to more accurately synchronize the received and the locally-generated<br>
PRN codes is to use the "narrow correlators" discussed in United States Patents<br>
5,101,416; 5,390,207 and 5,495,499, all of which are assigned to a common assignee<br>
and incorporated herein by reference. It has been determined that narrowing the delay<br>
spacing between early and late correlation measurements substantially reduces the<br>
adverse effects of noise and multipath signal distortion on the early-minus-late<br>
measurements.<br>
The delay spacing is narrowed such that the noise correlates in the early and late<br>
correlation measurements. Also, the narrow correlators are essentially spaced closer to<br>
a correlation peak that is associated with the punctual PRN code correlation<br>
measurements than the contributions of many of the multipath signals. Accordingly,<br>
the early-minus-late correlation measurements made by these correlators are<br>
significantly less distorted than they would be if they were made at a greater interval<br>
around the peak. The closer the correlators are placed to the correlation peak, the more<br>
the adverse effects of the multipath signals on the correlation measurements are<br>
minimized. The delay spacing can not, however, be made so narrow that the DLL can<br>
not lock to the satellite PRN code and then maintain code lock. Otherwise, the receiver<br>
cannot track the PRN code in the received signal without repeatedly taking the time to<br>
re-lock to the code.<br>
The L1 carrier is modulated by two PRN codes, namely, a 1.023 MHz C/A code<br>
and a 10.23 MHz P-code. The L2 carrier is modulated by the P-code. Generally, a<br>
GPS receiver constructed in accordance with the above-referenced patents acquires the<br>
satellite signal using a locally generated C/A code and a locally generated L1 carrier.<br>
After acquisition, the receiver synchronizes the locally generated C/A code and L1<br>
carrier with the C/A code and L1 carrier in the received signal, using the narrow<br>
correlators in a DLL and a punctual correlator in the carrier tracking loop The receiver<br>
may then use the C/A code tracking information to track the L1 and/or L2 P-codes,<br>
which have known timing relationships with the C/A code, and with each other.<br>
In a newer generation of GPS satellites, the L2 carrier is also modulated by a<br>
C/A code that is, in turn, modulated by a 10.23 MHz square wave. The square wave<br>
modulated C/A code, which we refer to hereinafter as the "split C/A code," has<br><br>
maximums in its power spectrum at offsets of ±10 MHz from the L2 carrier, or in<br>
the nulls of the power spectrum of the P-code. The split C/A code can thus be<br>
selectively jammed, as necessary, without jamming the L2 P-code.<br>
The autocorrelation function associated with the split C/A code has an<br>
envelope that corresponds to the autocorrelation of the 1.023MHz C/A code and<br>
multiple peaks within the envelope that correspond to the autocorrelation of the<br>
10.23 MHz square wave. There are thus 20 peaks within a two chip C/A code<br>
envelope, or a square wave autocorrelation peak every 0.1 C/A code chips. The<br>
multiple peaks associated with the square wave are each relatively narrow, and thus,<br>
offer increased code tracking accuracy, assuming the DLL tracks the correct narrow<br>
peak.<br>
As discussed in United States Patent 6,184, 822 which is assigned to a<br>
common Assignee and incorporated herein by reference, there are advantages to<br>
acquiring and tracking the split-C/A code by separately aligning with the received<br>
signal the phases of a locally-generated 10.23 MHz square wave, which can be<br>
thought of as a 20.46 MHz square-wave code, and a locally-generated 1.023 MHz<br>
C/A code. The receiver first aligns the phase of the locally generated square-wave<br>
code with the received signal, and tracks one of the multiple peaks of the split-C/A<br>
code autocorrelation function. It then shifts the phase of the locally-generated C/A<br>
code with respect to the phase of the locally-generated square-wave code, to align the<br>
local and the received C/A codes and position the correlators on the center peak of<br>
the split-C/A. The receiver then tracks the center peak directly, with a locally<br>
generated split-C/A code.<br>
The document "Analysis of L5/E5 Acquisition, Tracking and Data<br>
Demodulation Thresholds", F. Bastide, O. Julien, C. Macabiau, B. Roturier, in<br>
Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation (ION), GPS (24-09-2002), pages 2196-<br>
2207 discloses a receiver adapted to demodulate QPSK-modulated GPS L5 signals<br>
(Quaternary Phase Shift Keying), or QPSK-modulated Galileo E5 A and E5B signals.<br>
The European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA) are<br>
developing a GNSS known as Galileo. Galileo satellites will transmit signals in the<br>
E5aband (1176.45MHz) andE5b band (1207.14MHz) as a composite signal with a<br>
center frequency of 1195.795 MHz using a proposed modulation known as Alternate<br><br>
Binary Offset Canier(AltBOC). The generation of the AltBOC signal is described in<br>
the Galileo Signal Task Force document"Technical Annex to Galileo SRD Signal<br>
Plans", Draft 1,18 July 2001, ref # STF-annexSRD-2001/003, which is incorporated<br>
herein in its entirety by reference. Like the GPS satellites, the GNSS satellites each<br>
transmit unique PRN codes and a GNSS receiver can thus associate a received signal<br>
with a particular satellite. Accordingly, the GNSS receiver determines respective<br><br>
pseudoranges based on the difference between the times the satellites transmit the<br>
signals and then times the receiver receives the AltBOC signals.<br>
A standard binary offset carrier (BOC) modulates a time domain signal by a<br>
sine wave sin(wot), which shifts the frequency of the signal to both an upper sideband<br>
and a corresponding lower sideband. The BOC modulation accomplishes the frequency<br>
shift using a square wave, or sign(sin(wot)), and is generally denoted as BOC(fs,fc),<br>
where fs is the subcarrier (square wave) frequency and fc is the spreading code chipping<br>
rate. The factors of 1.023 MHz are usually omitted from the notation for clarity so a<br>
BOC(15.345MHz, 10.23 MHz) modulation is denoted BOC(15,10). The BOC<br>
modulation, which produces, for example, signals that are similar to the split C/A code<br>
discussed above, allows a single spreading, or PRN, code on each of the in-phase and<br>
quadrature carriers.<br>
The modulation of a time domain signal by a complex exponential ewot shifts<br>
the frequency of the signal to the upper sideband oniy. The goal of the AltBOC<br>
modulation is to generate in a coherent manner the E5a and E5b bands, which are<br>
respectively modulated by complex exponentials, or subcarriers, such that the signals<br>
can be received as a wideband "BOC-like signal." The E5a and E5b bands each have<br>
associated in-phase and quadrature spreading, or PRN, codes, with the E5a codes<br>
shifted to the lower sideband and the E5b codes shifted to the upper sideband. The<br>
respective E5a and E5b quadrature carriers are modulated by dataless pilot signals, and<br>
the respective in-phase carriers are modulated by both PRN codes and data signals. A<br>
GNSS receiver may track either the E5a codes or the E5b codes in a manner that is<br>
similar to the tracking of the split C/A code discussed above.<br>
There are, however, advantages in both multipath mitigation and tracking<br>
accuracy associated with tracking the composite E5a and E5b signals, that is, tracking<br>
the wideband AltBOC coherent signal. The respective inphase and quadrature carriers<br>
of the composite signal are modulated by complex spreading codes, and thus, the in-<br>
phase and quadrature channels each include contributions from both real and imaginary<br>
signal components of the E5a and E5b codes. Theoretical analyses of the composite<br>
tracking operations have been made using high level mathematics. Accordingly, the<br>
associated receivers, which essentially reproduce the high-level mathematical<br>
operations, are expected to be both complicated and costly<br><br>
One proposed receiver produces local versions of the AltBOC composite codes<br>
using the same look-up tables that the Galileo satellites use to generate the signals for<br>
transmission, that is, the tables that correspond to the underlying phase shift keying<br>
(PSK) spreading codes. The proposed receiver must thus not only maintain large look-<br>
up tables for each of the codes transmitted by the respective Galileo satellites, the<br>
receiver must also operate complex circuitry that controls entry to the look-up tables<br>
each time a new code chip is received. The tables are even larger and entering them<br>
more complicated when different pilot codes are used on the E5a and E5b bands, as is<br>
now contemplated.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The invention is (a GNSS receiver that tracks the AltBOC (15,10), or composite )<br>
E5a and E5b, codes (using hardware that locally generates the complex composite signal<br>
by combining separately generated real and the imaginary components of the complex<br>
signal.) To track the dataless composite pilot code signals that are on the quadrature<br>
channel of the AltBOC signal, for example, the receiver produces a local version of the<br>
composite pilot code as a combination of the locally generated real and imaginary pilot<br>
signal components. The receiver thus operates PRN code generators that produce<br>
replica E5a and E5b PRN codes and square wave generators that generate the real and<br>
imaginary components of the upper and lower subcarriers.<br>
The receiver removes the complex composite code from the received signal by<br>
multiplying the received signal, which has been downconverted to baseband I and Q<br>
signal components, by the locally generated complex composite code. The receiver<br>
then uses the results, which are correlated I and Q prompt signal values, to estimate the<br>
center frequency carrier phase angle tracking error. The error signal is used to control a<br>
numerically controlled oscillator that operates in a conventional manner, to correct the<br>
phase angle of the locally generated center frequency carrier. The receiver also uses<br>
early and late versions of the locally generated complex composite pilot code in a DLL,<br>
and aligns the locally generated composite pilot code with the received composite pilot<br>
code by minimizing the corresponding DLL error signal.<br>
Once the receiver is tracking the composite pilot code, the receiver determine its<br>
pseudorange and global position in a conventional manner Further, as discussed in<br><br>
more detail below, the receiver uses a separate set of correlators to align locally generated<br>
versions of the in-phase composite PRN codes with the in-phase channel codes in the<br>
received signal, and thereafter, recover the data that is modulated thereon.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE<br>
EMBODIMENT<br>
The Galileo AltBOC modulation scheme generates an AltBOC (15,10) signal<br>
that is a "BOC(15,10)-like" signal with the E5a and E5b bands having their own<br>
respective spreading, or PRN, codes on their in-phase and quadrature carriers. The<br>
AltBOC (15,10) signal has a center carrier frequency of 1191.795 HMz and a<br><br>
subcarrier frequency of 15.345 MHz, with the E5a band (1176.45 MHz) as the lower<br>
sideband and the E5b band (1207.14 MHz) as the upper sideband.<br>
The AltBOC (15,10) signal is generated on the satellite as a constant envelope<br>
signal that includes on the in-phase channel a composite of the E5a and E5b spreading,<br>
or PRN, codes and data, on the quadrature channel and a composite of the E5a and E5b<br>
dataless PRN, or pilot, codes. Fig. 1 depicts the frequency spectrum of an AltBOC<br>
PRN quadrature channel sequence.<br>
The idealized normalized autocorrelation function for the AltBOC (15, 10)<br>
signal is shown in Fig. 2. The envelope 100 of the autocorrelation function 111 is the<br>
autocorrelation function of a 10.23 MHz chipping rate signal and the multiple peaks of<br>
the autocorrelation function 111 are associated with the 15.3454 MHz; subcarrier, which<br>
can be thought of as a complex square wave code.<br>
The operations of a GNSS receiver 10 in tracking the AltBOC (15, 10) Galileo<br>
satellite signals are discussed below. In Section 1, the operations for tracking the<br>
quadrature dataless pilot codes as a composite code are discussed. In Section 2 the<br>
operations for recovering the E5a and E5b data from the in-phase composite data codes<br>
are discussed. The discussion below assumes that the receiver has acquired the center<br>
frequency carrier using a conventional carrier tracking loop (not shown).<br>
Section 1. Tracking the Composite Pilot Code<br>
The AltBOC signal is given by:<br><br>
where c1 is the in-phase E5b code, c2 is the in-phase E5a code, c3 is the quadrature E5b<br>
code and c4 is the quadrature E5a code, and the E5b and E5a spreading codes are<br>
modulated, respectively, on the upper carrier er(t) and the lower carrier er*(t), which is<br>
the complex conjugate of er(l). The upper carrier er(t) is:<br><br>
where cr(t) = sign(cos(2π fst)), sr(t) = sign(sin7(2π fst)) and fs is the subcarrier frequency.<br>
The lower carrier er*(t) is.<br><br><br>
The composite pilot code, which is on the quadrature channel of the AltBOC (15,10)<br>
signal, includes the E5a and E5b quadrature codes c4(t) and c3(1:). An expression Xq(t)<br>
for the quadrature channel signal is derived from equation 1 by setting the in-phase<br>
channel codes to zero and substituting the expressions for the carriers:<br><br>
The receiver produces the local version of the complex composite pilot code by<br>
combining locally generated real and imaginary signal components, as discussed in<br>
more detail with reference to Fig. 4. The receiver then correlates the locally generated<br>
composite pilot code with the corresponding composite pilot code in the received<br>
signal, as discussed in more detail with reference to Fig. 5 below. The receiver then<br>
determines associated pseudoranges and its global position in a conventional manner.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, a GNSS receiver 10 receives over an antenna 12 a<br>
signal that includes the AltBOC composite codes transmitted by all of the satellites that<br>
are in view. The received signal is applied to a downconverter 14 that, in a<br>
conventional manner, converts the received signal to an intermediate frequency ("IF")<br>
signal that has a frequency which is compatible with an analog-to-digital converter 18.<br>
The IF signal is next applied to an IF bandpass filter 16 that has a bandpass at<br>
the desired center carrier frequency. The bandwidth of the filter 16 should be<br>
sufficiently wide to allow the primary harmonic of the AltBOC composite pilot code to<br>
pass, or approximately 1192 MHz. The wide bandwidth results in relatively sharp bit<br>
transitions in the received code, and thus, fairly well defined correlation peaks.<br>
The analog-to-digital converter 18 samples the filtered IF signal at a rate that<br>
satisfies the Nyquist theorem and produces corresponding digital inphase (I) and<br>
quadrature (Q) signal samples in a known manner. The 1 and Q digital signal samples<br>
are supplied to a Doppler removal processor 20 that operates in a known manner, to<br>
/ produce baseband Ibaseband and Qbaseband samples by rotating the signals in accordance<br><br>
with an estimate of the center frequency carrier phase angle. The estimate of the carrier<br>
phase angle is based in part on the signals produced by a carrier numerically controlled<br>
oscillator ("carrier NCO") 30, which is adjusted in accordance with carrier phase error<br>
tracking signals produced by a correlation subsystem 22. The operations of the<br>
correlator subsystem are discussed below with reference to Fig. 5.<br>
The Ibaseband and Qbaseband samples are next supplied to the correlator subsystem<br>
22, which makes correlation measurements by multiplying the samples by early,<br>
prompt and late or early minus late versions of locally generated composite pilot<br>
codes produced by a composite code generator 24. The operations of the composite<br>
code generator and the correlator subsystem are discussed below with reference to Figs.<br>
4 and 5, respectfully. The I and Q correlation measurements associated with the early,<br>
prompt and late or early minus late versions of the local-composite pilot code are<br>
supplied to an integrate and dump circuit 26, which separately accumulates the<br>
respective I and Q measurements over predetermined intervals. At the end of each<br>
interval, the integrate and dump circuit 26 supplies the results of the respective I and Q<br>
accumulations, that is, the I and Q correlation signals, to a controller 40. The controller<br>
then controls the carrier NCO 30 and the composite code generator 24, to align the<br>
locally generated composite pilot code with the corresponding composite code in the<br>
received signal.<br>
The GNSS receiver 10 tracks the AltBOC (15, 10) signals using a locally<br>
generated composite pilot code that is generated from locally produced real and<br>
imaginary composite signal components. The operations performed by the composite<br>
code generator 24 to produce the locally generated composite pilot code components<br>
are now discussed in detail with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
The composite code generator 24 includes c3 and c4 PRN code generators 242<br>
and 243 'that produce, respectively, local versions of the E5a and E5b PRN codes for a<br>
given GNSS satellite. The code generator 24 further includes two square wave<br>
generators 244 and 245 that produce values of cr and sr that correspond to the real and<br>
imaginary components of the upper and lower carriers er(t) and er*(t). As discussed in<br>
more detail below with reference to Fig. 5, the controller uses the correlation signals to<br>
control the relative timing of the locally produced c3 and c4 code chips and the<br><br>
transitions of the cr and sr square waves, which can be thought of as respective code<br>
patterns of 0, 1,0...., and so forth.<br>
The composite code generator 24 adds together the c3 and c4 code chips in an<br>
adder 240 and multiplies the sum in multiplier 246 by the value of cr, which is<br>
sign(cos(πfst), to produce the real component of the locally generated composite pilot<br>
code. The real component of the composite pilot code is hereinafter referred to as<br>
"Ipilot" The composite code generator produces the imaginary component of the<br>
composite pilot code by inverting the c3 code chips in an inverter 248, adding the<br>
inverted c3 code chip to the corresponding c4 code chip in an adder 2.50 and, in<br>
multiplier 252, multiplying the result by sr, which is sign(sin(πfssf). The imaginary<br>
component of the locally generated composite pilot code is hereinafter referred to as<br>
"Qpilot" The local replica of the composite pilot code is then the sum:<br><br>
As discussed in more detail below, the correlator subsystem 22 multiplies the received<br>
composite pilot code by the locally generated composite pilot code. Based on the<br>
results, the controller 40 adjusts the PRN code and square wave generators 242-245 to<br>
align the local code to the received code.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, the operations of the correlator subsystem 22 are<br>
explained in terms of the operations involving the prompt version of the locally<br>
generated composite pilot code. The receiver includes similar circuits for early and<br>
late or early-minus-late versions of the locally generated composite pilot code that<br>
operate as part of a delay lock loop, or DLL, which operates in a known manner to<br>
produce an associated DLL error signal.<br>
The correlation subsystem 22 multiplies together two complex signals, namely,<br>
the locally generated composite pilot code and the received composite signal. The<br>
correlator subsystem thus performs the operation:<br><br><br>
As depicted in Fig. 5, the correlation subsystem manipulates the baseband<br>
signals Ibaseband and Qbaseband provided by the Doppler removal processor 20 and the<br>
locally-generated real and imaginary signal components Ipilot and Qpilot provided by the<br>
code generator 24, to produce the real and imaginary components of the correlation<br>
signal. The correlation subsystem 22 multiples the Ibaseband signal by the Ipilot signal in<br>
multiplier 502, and the Qbaseband signal by the Qpilot signal in multiplier 510. An adder<br>
506 then adds the two products together and provides the result to an integrate and<br>
dump circuit 516. The integrate and dump circuit 516 accumulates the sums produced<br>
by the adder 506 and at appropriate times produces a corresponding real component, or<br>
Iprompt, signal. To produce the imaginary components, the correlation subsystem<br>
multiplies the Qbaseband signal by the Ipilot signal in a multiplier 508 and multiplies the<br>
Ibaseband signal by the Qpilot signal in a multiplier 504. The product produced by the<br>
multiplier 504 is inverted by inverter 512 and added to the product produced by the<br>
multiplier 508 in an adder 514. The adder 514 then supplies the sums to the integrate<br>
and dump circuit 518, which accumulates the sums and at appropriate times produces a<br>
corresponding Qprompt signal.<br>
The controller 40 (Fig. 3) manipulates the Iprompt and Qprompt signals, to<br>
determine the center carrier tracking phase error as the arctangent of QPrompt/IPrompt.<br>
The phase error signal is then used, in a known manner, to control the carrier NCO 30,<br>
which in turn controls the Doppler removal processor 20.<br>
As discussed above, the controller 40 also receives early and late or early-<br>
minus-late I and Q correlation signals. Based on these signals the controller 40 adjusts<br>
the generators 242-245 to align the local composite code in the received code and thus<br>
minimize the associated DLL error signal<br>
Section 2. Recovering the Data from the Composite In-Phase Signals<br>
The AltBOC (15, 10) signals include both data and spreading codes on the E5a<br>
in-phase and E5b in-phase channels The E5a in-phase channel will carry data that is<br>
transmitted at a particular data rate and the E5b in-phase channel will carry different<br>
data that is transmitted at a different data rate. The data transitions on the E5a and E5b<br>
in-phase channels will, however, occur at corresponding times. The GNSS receiver 10<br>
acquires and tracks the AltBOC (15,10) signal using the composite pilot code, as<br>
discussed above. After the removal of the carrier, the receiver recovers the data from<br><br>
the composite in-phase signal using a separate set of correlators, as discussed in more<br>
detail below with reference to Fig. 10.<br>
The AItBOC(15, 10) complex in-phase baseband signal, that is, the signal with<br>
the quadrature pilot codes set to zero is:<br><br>
where the subcarrier is included in the expression as a sinusoid instead of the<br>
corresponding rectangular functions cr(t) ± sr(t) and assuming, for the moment, that<br>
c1(t) and c2(t) are free of data. Note that the term c1(t) •ej2xf + c2(t)•e-j2xf is similar<br>
to the expression for the quadrature spreading, or PRN, codes discussed in Section 1<br>
above.<br>
If the baseband in-phase signal is correlated with a local replica of the<br>
composite in-phase spreading code, the result is.<br><br>
where Rk denotes the auto-correlation function for signal k. The cross-terms will be<br>
filtered over the predetection interval, particularly since the E5a and E5b in-phase<br>
spreading codes are designed to have low cross-correlation values. Removing the<br>
cross-terms and expanding the complex exponentials the expression becomes:<br><br>
In the case of datafree signals, the autocorrelation functions R1 and R2 will be<br>
equal and the expression simplifies to:<br><br><br>
The corresponding correlation function is depicted in Fig 6. Note that this is similar to<br>
the correlation function for the composite quadrature pilot code, which is shown in Fig.<br>
2.<br>
If the assumption that the E5a and E5b in-phase codes c1(t) and c2(t) are<br>
datafree is removed, the maximum normalized ideal value of the individual correlation<br>
functions R1 and R2, and their sum and differences are shown in the table of Fig. 7.<br>
Accordingly, the original data sequence can be recovered if the receiver recovers both<br>
(R1+R2) and<br>
(R2-R1) from the composite in-phase signal,<br>
The receiver may recover the (R1+R2) data directly from the in-phase I prompt<br>
signal. However, the recovery of the (R2-R1) data is not as straight forward. As<br>
depicted in Fig. 6, the R1+R2 component of the in-phase composite signal, namely,<br>
(R1 (ι) + R2 (r)) • cos(2πfsτ) has an autocorrelation function that is similar to the<br>
autocorrelation function of the composite quadrature channel signal. However, as<br>
depicted in Fig. 8, the R1-R2 signal component of the in-phase composite signal<br>
j (R2 (τ) - R1 (τ)) sin(2πfτ) does not have a similar autocorrelation function because<br>
the sin term goes to zero when r goes to zero.<br>
To compensate for the sin term going to zero when x goes to zero, a correlation<br>
operation could be offset so that the operation tracks the correlation peak that<br>
corresponds to j (R2(τ) -R1 (τ)) sin(2πfτ) and the (R2-R1) data sequence may then<br>
be read from the Qprompt correlator, but with reduced power.<br>
Alternatively, the circuitry that generates the local version of the composite<br>
signal may instead generate a signal that produces for the (R2 -R1) term the<br>
autocorrelation function (R2 (τ) - Rx (τ)) cos(2πfsτ) The local in-phase composite<br>
signal thus becomes: <br>
To demodulate the data using this method, the receiver locally produces two<br>
combinations of the c1(t) and c2(t) spreading codes, namely, combinations that<br>
correspond, respectively, to the R1 +R2 data and the R2-R1 data To recover the (R1+R2)<br>
data the receiver produces the local signal:<br><br><br>
Referring now to Fig. 9, the real and imaginary components of the R2-R1 and<br>
R1 +R2 combinations are locally produced by a code generator 54, which may be part of<br>
the local composite code generator 24 (Fig. 3). To produce the real component of the<br>
R1 +R2 combination, the code generator adds together the c1 and c2 codes in an adder<br>
540 and multiplies the result by the square wave code cr in a multiplier 546. To<br>
produce the imaginary component of the R1 +R2 combination, the code generator adds<br>
together the c1 code and an inverted c2 code in an adder 550 and multiples the result by<br>
the square wave code sr in a multiplier 562. The generator also multiplies the sum c1 +<br>
c2 produced by the adder 540 by the square wave code sr in a multiplier 560, to produce<br>
the imaginary component of the R2-R1 combination. The generator further multiplies<br>
the sum c1-c2 produced by the adder 550 by the square wave code cr in a multiplier 522,<br>
to produce the real component of the R2 -R1 code<br>
The receiver then uses the locally produced real and imaginary components of<br>
the R1 +R2 and R2-R1 combinations to recover the data from the composite in-phase<br>
code.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 10, the system multiplies the in-phase baseband signal<br>
Ibaseband by the real component of R1 +R2 in a multiplier 602, and the quadrature<br>
baseband signal Qbaseband by the imaginary component of R1 +R2 in a multiplier 606.<br>
The products produced by the multipliers 602 and 606 are then added together in an<br>
adder 608 and the sum provided to an integrate and dump circuit 615. To produce the<br>
correlation signal relating to R1-R2, the correlation subsystem multiplies the quadrature<br>
baseband signal Qbaseband by the imaginary component of R2-R1 in a multiplier 610.<br>
Further, the system multiplies the real component of the baseband signal Ibaseband by the<br>
real component of R2-R1, in a multiplier 604 code. The two sums are added together in<br>
an adder 612 and provided to an integrate and dump circuit 616. The integrate and<br>
dump circuits 615 and 616 accumulate the correlation values produced by the adders<br><br>
608 and 612, respectively, and at appropriate times produce the R1 + R2prompt and R1-<br>
R2prompt signals. The results are then used to recover the data in accordance with the<br>
chart of Fig. 7.<br>
The circuitry of Figs. 5 and 10 can be combined, as depicted in Fig. 11, to<br>
produce a system that tracks the quadrature AltBOC composite code and recovers E5a<br>
and E5b data from the in phase AltBOC composite code.<br><br>
