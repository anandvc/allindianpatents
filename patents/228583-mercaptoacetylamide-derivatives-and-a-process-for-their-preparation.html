The present invention is directed to novel compounds possessing both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory activity and neutral endopeptidase inhibitory activity and methods of preparing such compounds. The present invention is also directed to phamiaceuticai compositions containing such dual inhibiting compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and their use in the manufacture of medicaments.<br>
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) is a peptidy! dipeptidase which catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor which also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. ACE inhibition prevents both the conversion of angiotensin (to angiotensin II and the metabolism of bradykinin, resulting in decreased circulating angiotensin il, aldosterone and increased circulating bradykinin concentrations. In addition to these neurohonnonal changes, decreases in peripheral resistance and blood pressure are observed, particularly in individuals with high circulating renin. Other phannacological effects associated with ACE inhibition include regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, improvement in the clinical signs of heart failure, and reduction In mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) or left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.<br>
Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Inhibition of NEP results in Increased ANP concentrations,<br><br>
which in turn leads to natriuresis, diuresis and decreases In intravascular volume, venous return and blood pressure. ANP is released by atrial myocytes in response to atrial stretch or increased intravascular volume. Elevated plasma concentrations of ANP have been demonstrated as a potential compensatory mechanism in various disease states, inctuding congestive heart "Allure, renal failure, essential hypertension and cirrtiosis.<br>
The secretion of ANP by atrial myocytes causes vasodilation, diuresis, natriuresis, and the inhibition of renin release and aldosterone secretion. In contrast, angiotensin II results in vasoconstriction, sodium and water reabsorption, and aldosterone production. These two hormonal systems interact in a reciprocal or counterbalancing manner to maintain normal physiologic vascular and hemodynamic responses.<br>
U.S. patent 5,430,145 discloses tricyclic mercaptoacetylamide derivatives useful as ACE and NEP inhibitors. The present invention relates to specific compounds covered by the generic disclosure of U.S. patent 5,430,145 which have surprisingly improved ADME (Absoiption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) properties over the compounds exemplified therein.<br>

In step b, the (R&gt;bromo functionality of the appropriate (R)-bromoamide compound of structure 34 wherein X is O, S, NH or {CH2)n wherein n is 0 or 1 is converted to the corresponding (S)-thfoacetate or {S)-thiobenzoate of strucfcjre 36, wherein X is O, S, NH or (CH2)n wherein n is 0 or 1.<br>
Alternatively, the (S)-bromo functionality of the appropriate (S&gt;bn3moamide wherein X is 0, S, NH or (CH2)n wherein n is 0 or 1 is converted to the corresponding (R)-thioacetate or (R)-thiobenzoate wherein X is O, S, NH or (CHzJn wherein n is 0 or 1.<br>
For example, the appropriate (R)-bromoamide compound of structure 34 wherein X is O, S, NH or {CHzJn Virtierein n is 0 or 1 is reacted with thiolacetic acid or thiolbenzoic acid of structure 35 in the presence of a base, such as cesium or sodium carbonate. The reactants are t^ically contacted in a suitable organic solvent such as a mixture of dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran. The reactants are typically stin^ed together at room temperature for a period of time ranging from 1 to 8 hours. The resulting (S)-thioacetate or (SVthiobenzoate of stnjcture 36 wherein X is O, S, NH or (CH2)n wherein n is 0 or 1 is recovered from the reaction zone by extractive methods as is known in the art. It may be purified by chromatography.<br>
AJtematively, the bromo ftjnctionality of the appropriate diastereoisomeric mixture of the bromoamides described supra wherein X is O, S, NH or (CH2)n virtierein n is 0 or 1 is converted to the corresponding diastereoisomeric mixture of thioacetate or thlobenzoate compounds wherein X is O, S, NH or (CH2)n wherein n is 0 or 1.<br>
Although Scheme B provides for ttie preparation of compounds of formula 1 wherein the tricyclic moiety has a 4-cartx&gt;xy fijnctionality of the {S)-configuration when for example X is -CHz, the compounds of formula I wherein the carboxy functionality is of ttie (R)-configuration may be prepared by substituting the appropriate (4R)-carboxy<br><br>
