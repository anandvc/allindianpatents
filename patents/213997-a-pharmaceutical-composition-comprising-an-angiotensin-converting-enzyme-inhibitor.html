Field of the Invention<br>
Combinations of an angiotensin converting enzyme<br>
inhibitor and an aldosterone antagonist are described<br>
for use in treatment of circulatory disorders, including<br>
cardiovascular diseases of such as heart failure,<br>
hypertension and congestive heart failure. Of<br>
particular interest are therapies using a spirolactone-<br>
type aldosterone antagonist compound in combination with<br>
an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to reduce the<br>
death rate or the number of non-fatal hospitalizations<br>
in patients.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Myocardial (or cardiac) failure, that is, heart<br>
failure ("HF"), whether a consequence of previous<br>
myocardial infarction(s), heart disease associated with<br>
hypertension, or primary cardiomyopathy, is a major<br>
health problem of worldwide proportions. The incidence<br>
of symptomatic heart failure has risen steadily over the<br><br>
past several decades.<br>
In clinical terms, decompensated cardiac failure<br>
consists of a constellation of signs and symptoms that<br>
arise from congested organs and poorly perfused tissues<br>
to form congestive heart failure (CHF) syndrome.<br>
Congestion is caused largely by increased venous<br>
pressure and by inadequate sodium (Na+) excretion,<br>
relative to dietary Na+ intake, and is importantly<br>
related to circulating levels of aldosterone (ALDO). An<br>
abnormal retention of Na+ occurs via tubular epithelial<br>
cells throughout the nephron, including the later<br>
portion of the distal tubule and cortical collecting<br>
ducts, where ALDO receptor sites are present.<br>
ALDO is the body"s most potent mineralocorticoid<br>
hormone. As implied by the term mineralocorticoid, this<br>
steroid hormone has mineral-regulating activity. It<br>
promotes Na+ reabsorption not only in the kidney, but<br>
also from the lower gastrointestinal tract and salivary<br>
and sweat glands, each of which represents classic ALDO-<br>
responsive tissues. ALDO regulates Na+ and water<br>
resorption at the expense of potassium (K+) and<br>
magnesium (Mg2+) excretion.<br>
ALDO can also provoke responses in non-epithelial<br>
cells. Elicited by a chronic elevation in plasma ALDO<br>
level that is inappropriate relative to dietary Na+<br>
intake, these responses can have adverse consequences on<br>
the structure of the cardiovascular system. Hence, ALDO<br>
can contribute to the progressive nature of myocardial<br>
failure for multiple reasons.<br>
Multiple factors regulate ALDO synthesis and<br>
metabolism, many of which are operative in the patient<br>
with myocardial failure. These include renin as well as<br><br>
non-renin-dependent factors (such as K+, ACTH) that<br>
promote ALDO synthesis. Hepatic blood flow, by<br>
regulating the clearance of circulating ALDO, helps<br>
determine ALDO plasma concentration, an important factor<br>
in heart failure characterized by reduction in cardiac<br>
output and hepatic blood flow.<br>
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ("RAAS")<br>
is one of the hormonal mechanisms involved in regulating<br>
pressure/volume homeostasis and also in the development<br>
of hypertension, a precursor condition implicated in the<br>
progression of more serious cardiovascular diseases such<br>
as congestive heart failure. Activation of the renin-<br>
angiotensin-aldosterone system begins with secretion of<br>
the enzyme renin from the juxtaglomerular cells in the<br>
kidney. The enzyme renin acts on a naturally-occurring<br>
substrate, angiotensinogen, to release a decapeptide,<br>
Angiotensin I. This decapeptide is cleaved by<br>
angiotensin converting enzyme ("ACE") to provide an<br>
octapeptide, Angiotensin II, the primary active species<br>
of this system. This octapeptide, angiotensin II, is a<br>
potent vasoconstrictor and also produces other<br>
physiological effects such as stimulating aldosterone<br>
secretion, promoting sodium and fluid retention,<br>
inhibiting renin secretion, increasing sympathetic<br>
nervous system activity, stimulating vasopressin<br>
secretion, causing a positive cardiac inotropic effect<br>
and modulating other hormonal systems.<br>
Emphasis has been placed on minimizing<br>
hyperaldosteronism as a basis for optimizing patient<br>
treatment. This includes the importance of ALDO-<br>
receptor antagonism both in patients treated with<br>
conventional diuretic programs and in patients treated<br>
with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, who<br><br>
are often constrained to small doses of ACE inhibitor<br>
because of orthostatic hypotension. Such patients may-<br>
demonstrate a recurrence of heart failure symptoms<br>
likely related to elevations in plasma ALDO levels.<br>
Many aldosterone blocking drugs and their effects<br>
in humans are known. For example, spironolactone is a<br>
drug which acts at the mineralocorticoid receptor level<br>
by competitively inhibiting aldosterone binding. This<br>
steroidal compound has been used for blocking<br>
aldosterone-dependent sodium transport in the distal<br>
tubule of the kidney in order to reduce edema and to<br>
treat essential hypertension and primary<br>
hyperaldosteronism [F. Mantero et al, Clin. Sci. Mol.<br>
Med. , 45 (Suppl 1), 219s-224s (1973)]. Spironolactone<br>
is also used commonly in the treatment of other<br>
hyperaldosterone-related diseases such as liver<br>
cirrhosis and congestive heart failure [F.J. Saunders et<br>
al, Aldactone; Spironolactone: A Comprehensive Review,<br>
Searle, New York (1978)]. Progressively-increasing<br>
doses of spironolactone from 1 mg to 400 mg per day<br>
[i.e./ 1 mg/day, 5 mg/day, 20 mg/day] were administered<br>
to a spironolactone-intolerant patient to treat<br>
cirrhosis-related ascites [P.A. Greenberger et al, N.<br>
Eng. Reg. Allergy Proc., 7(4), 343-345 (Jul-Aug, 1986)].<br>
It has been recognized that development of myocardial<br>
fibrosis is sensitive to circulating levels of both<br>
Angiotensin II and aldosterone, and that the aldosterone<br>
antagonist spironolactone prevents myocardial fibrosis<br>
in animal models, thereby linking aldosterone to<br>
excessive collagen deposition [D. Klug et al, Am. J.<br>
Cardiol. , 71(3), 46A-54A (1993)]. Spironolactone has<br>
been shown to prevent fibrosis in animal models<br>
irrespective of the development of left ventricular<br>
hypertrophy and the presence of hypertension [C.G.<br><br>
Brilla et al, J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol., 25(5), 563-575<br>
(1993)]. Spironolactone at a dosage ranging from 25 mg<br>
to 100 mg daily is used to treat diuretic-induced<br>
hypokalemia, when orally-administered potassium<br>
supplements or other potassium-sparing regimens are<br>
considered inappropriate {Physicians" Desk Reference,<br>
46th Edn., p. 2153, Medical Economics Company Inc.,<br>
Montvale, N.J. (1992)].<br>
Previous studies have shown that inhibiting ACE<br>
inhibits the renin-angiotensin system by substantially<br>
complete blockade of the formation of Angiotensin II.<br>
Many ACE inhibitors have been used clinically to control<br>
hypertension. While ACE inhibitors may effectively<br>
control hypertension, side effects are common including<br>
chronic cough, skin rash, loss of taste sense,<br>
proteinuria and neutropenia.<br>
Moreover, although ACE inhibitors effectively block<br>
the formation of Angiotensin II, aldosterone levels are<br>
not well controlled in certain patients having<br>
cardiovascular diseases. For example, despite continued<br>
ACE inhibition in hypertensive patients receiving<br>
captopril, there has been observed a gradual return of<br>
plasma aldosterone to baseline levels [J. Staessen et<br>
al, J. Endocrinol., 91, 457-465 (1981)]. A similar<br>
effect has been observed for patients with myocardial<br>
infarction receiving zofenopril [C. Borghi et al, J.<br>
Clin. Pharmacol., 33, 40-45 (1993)]. This phenomenon<br>
has been termed "aldosterone escape".<br>
Combinations of an aldosterone antagonist and an<br>
ACE inhibitor have been investigated for treatment of<br>
heart failure. It is known that mortality is higher in<br>
patients with elevated levels of plasma aldosterone and<br><br>
that aldosterone levels increase as CHF progresses from<br>
RAAS activation. Routine use of a diuretic may further<br>
elevate aldosterone levels. ACE inhibitors consistently<br>
inhibit angiotensin II production but exert only a mild<br>
and transient antialdosterone effect.<br>
Combining an ACE inhibitor and spironolactone has<br>
been suggested to provide substantial inhibition of the<br>
entire RAAS. For example, a combination of enalapril<br>
and a 25 mg daily dose of spironolactone has been<br>
administered to ambulatory patients with monitoring of<br>
blood pressure [P. Poncelet et al, Am. J. Cardiol.,<br>
65(2), 33K-35K (1990)]. In a 90-patient study, a<br>
combination of spironolactone at a dose in a range from<br>
50mg/day to 100 mg/day (average 73 mg/day) and captopril<br>
was administered and found effective to control<br>
refractory CHF without serious incidents of hyperkalemia<br>
[U. Dahlstrom et al, Am. J. Cardiol., 71, 29A-33A (21<br>
Jan 1993)]. Spironolactone dosage at 100 mg/day<br>
coadministered with an ACE inhibitor was reported to be<br>
highly effective in 13 of 16 patients afflicted with<br>
congestive heart failure, with a 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day<br>
spironolactone maintenance dosage given at trial<br>
completion to compensated patients being treated with an<br>
ACE inhibitor and loop diuretic [A.A. van Vliet et al.<br>
Am. J. Cardiol., 71, 21A-28A (21 Jan 1993)]. Clinical<br>
improvements have been reported for patients receiving a<br>
co-therapy of spironolactone and the ACE inhibitor<br>
enalapril, although this report mentions that controlled<br>
trials are needed to determine the lowest effective<br>
doses and to identify which patients would benefit most<br>
from combined therapy [F. Zannad, Am. J. Cardiol.,<br>
71(3) , 34A-39A (1993)].<br><br>
Spironolactone, in combination with ACE inhibitors<br>
and loop diuretic therapy, has been shown to be<br>
effective in reducing N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic<br>
factor, a marker of heart failure, in patients with that<br>
disease [The RALES Investigators, Am. J. Cardiol.,<br>
78(8), 902-907 (1996)].<br>
Low dosages of spironolactone (e.g., less than 25<br>
mg per day) for use in treating cardiovascular diseases<br>
such as hypertension and heart failure, are described in<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
Treatment or prevent ion of circulatory disorders,<br>
including cardiovascular disorders such as heart<br>
failure, hypertension and congestive heart failure, is<br>
provided by a combination therapy comprising a<br>
therapeutically-effective amount of an angiotensin<br>
converting enzyme ("ACE") inhibitor along with a<br>
therapeutically-effective amount of a spirolactone-type<br>
aldosterone antagoist. Preferably, the combination<br>
therapy comprises administering therapeutically<br>
effective amounts of an ACE inhibitor, an aldosterone<br>
antagonist, and a diuretic wherein the diuretic has no<br>
substantial aldosterone receptor antagonistic effect.<br>
The combination therapy of the invention would be<br>
useful, for example, to reduce the death rate or the<br>
number of non-fatal hospitalizations or to prevent or<br>
retard, in subjects, the development of congestive heart<br>
failure which typically arises from essential<br>
hypertension or from heart conditions following<br>
myocardial infarct. A diuretic agent may also be used<br>
in conjunction with an ACE inhibitor and an aldosterone<br>
antagonist.<br>
Alternatively, the combination therapy can comprise<br>
administering an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor,<br>
an aldosterone antagonist and a loop diuretic to the<br>
subject, wherein the angiotensin converting enzyme<br>
inhibitor, the aldosterone antagonist and the loop<br>
diuretic are administered at doses that in combination<br>
result in one or more of the following: (1) a<br>
statistically significant reduction in the death rate as<br>
compared to said combination therapy without the<br>
aldosterone antagonist; (2) a statistically significant<br>
reduction in the number of non-fatal hospitalizations as<br>
compared to said combination therapy without the<br>
aldosterone antagonist; (3) a statistically significant<br><br>
reduction in the death rate or the number of non-fatal<br>
hospitalizations as compared to said combination therapy<br>
without the aldosterone antagonist; (4) a statistically<br>
significant reduction in the rate of deaths resulting<br>
from sudden death in subjects afflicted with or<br>
susceptible to elevated heart rate variability as<br>
compared to said combination therapy without the<br>
aldosterone antagonist; (5) a statistically significant<br>
reduction in the death rate for deaths resulting from<br>
progression of heart failure as compared to said<br>
combination therapy without the aldosterone antagonist;<br>
(6) a statistically significant reduction in the death<br>
rate or the number of non-fatal hospitalizations in<br>
subjects having a left ventricular ejection fraction<br>
greater than about 26% as compared to said combination<br>
therapy without the aldosterone antagonist; (7) a<br>
statistically significant reduction in the death rate or<br>
the number of non-fatal hospitalizations in subjects<br>
having a left ventricular ejection fraction less than<br>
about 26% as compared to said combination therapy without<br>
the aldosterone antagonist; and/or (8) suppression of<br>
clinically significant cough due to elevated pulmonary<br>
arterial fibrosis or low levels of pulmonary blood<br>
pressure in the subject as compared to said combination<br>
therapy.<br>
Still alternatively, the combination therapy may<br>
comprise administering a therapeutically-effective amount<br>
of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a<br>
therapeutically-effective amount of an aldosterone<br>
antagonist, a therapeutically-effective amount of a loop<br><br>
diuretic and a therapeutically-effective amount of<br>
digoxin to the subject.<br>
Preferably, the subject receiving the combination<br>
therapy: (1) is susceptible to sudden death; (2) is<br>
classified in New York Heart Association class III or<br>
class IV prior to combination therapy; (3) has a left<br>
ventricular ejection fraction greater than about 26%;<br>
and/or (4) is susceptible to or suffering from<br>
clinically significant cough due to elevated pulmonary<br>
arterial fibrosis or low levels of pulmonary blood<br>
pressure. The phrase "angiotensin converting enzyme<br>
inhibitor" ("ACE inhibitor") is intended to embrace an<br>
agent or compound, or a combination of two or more<br>
agents or compounds, having the ability to block,<br>
partially or completely, the rapid enzymatic conversion<br>
of the physiologically inactive decapeptide form of<br>
angiotensin ("Angiotensin I") to the vasoconstrictive<br>
octapeptide form of angiotensin ("Angiotensin II").<br>
Blocking the formation of Angiotensin II can quickly<br>
affect the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance,<br>
blood pressure and blood volume, by removing the primary<br>
actions of Angiotensin II. Included in these primary<br>
actions of Angiotensin II are stimulation of the<br>
synthesis and secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal<br>
cortex and raising blood pressure by direct constriction<br>
of the smooth muscle of the arterioles.<br>
The phrase "aldosterone antagonist" embraces an<br>
agent or compound, or a combination of two or more of<br>
such agents or compounds, which counteract the effect of<br>
aldosterone. Such agents and compounds, such as<br>
mespirenone, may antagonize the action of aldosterone<br>
through pre-receptor mechanism. Other agents and<br><br>
compounds, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, fall<br>
generally within a class known as aldosterone receptor<br>
antagonists and bind to aldosterone receptors such as<br>
typically are found in renal tubules, and prevent<br>
natural ligand activation of post-receptor events.<br>
The term "spirolactone-type" is intended to<br>
characterize a steroidal structure comprising a lactone<br>
moiety attached to a steroid nucleus, typically at the<br>
steroid "D" ring, through a spiro bond configuration.<br>
A subclass of spirolactone-type aldosterone antagonist<br>
consists of epoxy-steroidal aldosterone antagonist<br>
compounds such as eplerenone. Another subclass of<br>
spirolactone-type antagonist consists of non-epoxy-<br>
steroidal aldosterone antagonist compounds such as<br>
spironolactone.<br>
The phrase "combination therapy" (or "co-therapy"),<br>
in defining use of an ACE inhibitor agent, an<br>
aldosterone antagonist agent, loop diuretic agent,<br>
and/or digoxin is intended to embrace administration of<br>
each agent in a sequential manner in a regimen that will<br>
provide beneficial effects of the drug combination, and<br>
is intended as well to embrace co-administration of<br>
these agents in a substantially simultaneous manner,<br>
such as by oral ingestion of a single capsule having a<br>
fixed ratio of these active agents or ingestion of<br>
multiple, separate capsules for each agent.<br>
"Combination therapy" will also include simultaneous or<br>
sequential administration by intravenous, intramuscular<br>
or other parenteral routes into the body, including<br>
direct absorption through mucuous membrane tissues, as<br>
found in the sinus passages. Sequential administration<br>
also includes drug combination where the individual<br>
elements may be administered at different times and/or<br><br>
by different routes but which act in combination to<br>
provide a beneficial effect.<br>
The phrase "therapeutically-effective" is intended<br>
to qualify the amount of each agent for use in the<br>
combination therapy which will achieve the goal of<br>
improvement in cardiac sufficiency by reducing or<br>
preventing, for example, the progression of congestive<br>
heart failure, while avoiding adverse side effects<br>
typically associated with each agent.<br>
A preferred combination therapy would consist<br>
essentially of two active agents, namely, an ACE<br>
inhibitor agent and aldosterone antagonist agent. The<br>
agents would be used in combination in a weight ratio<br>
range from about 0.5-to-one to about twenty-to-one of<br>
the angiotensin converting enzyme agent to the<br>
aldosterone antagonist agent. A preferred range of<br>
these two agents (ACE inhibitor-to-ALDO antagonist)<br>
would be from about one-to-one to about fifteen-to-one,<br>
while a more preferred range would be from about one-to-<br>
one to about five-to-one, depending ultimately on the<br>
selection of the ACE inhibitor and ALDO antagonist. A<br>
more preferred combination therapy would consist<br>
essentially of three active agents, namely, an ACE"<br>
inhibitor agent, an aldosterone antagonist agent, and a<br>
loop diuretic agent.<br>
Examples of ACE inhibitors which may be used in the<br>
combination therapy are shown in the following<br>
categories.<br>
A representative group of ACE inhibitors consists<br>

following moieties:<br><br><br><br>
The term "steroidal", as used in the phrase "epoxy-<br>
steroidal", denotes a nucleus provided by a<br>
cyclopenteno-phenanthrene moiety, having the<br>
conventional "A", "B", "C" and "D" rings. The epoxy-<br>
type moiety may be attached to the<br>
cyclopentenophenanthrene nucleus at any attachable or<br>
substitutable positions, that is, fused to one of the<br>
rings of the steroidal nucleus or the moiety may be<br>
substituted on a ring member of the ring system. The<br>
phrase "epoxy-steroidal" is intended to embrace a<br>
steroidal nucleus having one or a plurality of epoxy-<br>
type moieties attached thereto.<br>

Of particular interest is the compound eplerenone which<br>
is compound 1 as shown above. Eplerenone is an<br>
aldosterone receptor antagonist and has a higher<br>
specificity for aldosterone receptors than<br>
spironolactone. Selection of epleronone as the<br>
aldosterone antagonist in the present combination<br>
therapy likewise should be beneficial, yet diminish<br>
certain side effects such as gynecomastia.<br>
A diuretic agent may be used with the combination<br>
of ACE inhibitor and aldosterone antagonist. Such<br>
diuretic agent may be selected from several known<br>
classes, such as thiazides and related sulfonamides,<br>
potassium-sparing diuretics, loop diuretics and organic<br>
mercurial diuretics. The term diuretic is not intended<br>
to embrace spirolactone-type compounds.<br>
Examples of thiazides are bendroflumethiazide,<br>
benzthiazide, chlorothiazide, cyclothiazide,<br>
hydrochlorotthiazide, hydroflumethiazode,<br>
methyclothiazide, polythiazide and trichlormethiazide.<br>
Examples of related sulfonamides are<br>
chlorthalidone, quinethazone and metolazone.<br>
An example of a non-thiazide sulfonamide diuretic<br>
is metolazone.<br>
Examples of potassium-sparing diuretics are<br>
triameterene and amiloride.<br>
Examples of loop diuretics, i.e., diuretics acting<br>
in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle of the<br>
kidney, are furosemide and ethynacrylic acid.<br><br>
Examples of organic mercurial diuretics are<br>
mercaptomerin sodium, merethoxylline procaine and<br>
mersalyl with theophylline.<br>
Biological Evaluation<br>
Human Clinical Trials<br>
A combination therapies comprising two or more of<br>
the agents or compounds selected from the group<br>
consisting of ACE inhibitors, spironolactone, digoxin,<br>
and loop diuretics was evaluated in humans as described<br>
in the following clinical trials. The use of the term<br>
"placebo" is intended to embrace therapy which includes<br>
cardiovascular treatments described herein in the<br>
absence of spironolactone.<br>
Patients: One thousand six hundred and sixty-three<br>
(1,663) patients with severe heart failure were<br>
enrolled in the study. Patients were eligible for<br>
enrollment in the study if they had a history of New<br>
York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure<br>
within 6 months but no less than 6 weeks from<br>
randomization, and were NYHA Class III or IV at the time<br>
of enrollment. Eligible patients had a left ventricular<br>
ejection fraction of ?35 percent and were to be<br>
receiving treatment with an angiotensin-converting<br>
enzyme inhibitor, if tolerated, and a loop diuretic.<br>
Treatment with digitalis and vasodilators was allowed,<br>
but potassium-sparing diuretics were not permitted.<br>
Oral potassium supplements were not recommended unless<br>
hypokalemia (serum potassium 
developed. A low salt diet (100-200 mEg/day, sodium)<br>
was recommended to all patients. Patients were excluded<br>
from the trial if they had clinically significant<br><br>
operable valvular disease (other than mitral or<br>
tricuspid regurgitation) , congenital heart disease,<br>
unstable angina, primary hepatic failure, active<br>
malignancy, a heart transplant or were a candidate for<br>
heart transplantation, or any life threatening disease<br>
(other than heart failure). Other criteria for<br>
exclusion were a serum creatinine concentration &gt;2.5 mg<br>
per deciliter (&gt;220 µmol per liter) or a serum<br>
potassium concentration &gt;5.0 mmol per liter. The<br>
protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards<br>
or Ethics Committees of all participating institutions.<br>
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.<br>
Study Design: After the initial evaluation, patients<br>
were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to<br>
receive either oral spironolactone (Aldactone®, Searle)<br>
25 mg once daily or matching placebo, in addition to<br>
their usual medication(s) . After 8 weeks of treatment,<br>
at the discretion of the investigator, study drug could<br>
be increased to 50 mg once daily if there were signs<br>
and/or symptoms of progression of heart failure without<br>
evidence of hyperkalemia. If at any time the patient<br>
developed hyperkalemia, the dose could be decreased to<br>
25 mg every other day; however, the investigator was<br>
encouraged to first adjust concomitant medications.<br>
Follow-up evaluations were conducted every 4 weeks until<br>
Week 12, and then every 3 months thereafter until study<br>
completion. Clinical laboratory determinations,<br>
including serum potassium, creatinine, sodium and N-<br>
terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, were performed<br>
at baseline at Weeks 1, 4, 5, 8, 12 and then every 3<br>
months thereafter until study completion. For patients<br>
in whom the study drug was increased to 50 mg once<br>
daily, a serum potassium determination was also<br>
performed at Week 9. Study medication could be withheld<br><br>
for serious hyperkalemia (potassium ?6.0 mmol per<br>
liter), serum creatinine &gt;4.0 mg per deciliter (354 µmol<br>
per liter), intercurrent illness, or any conditions<br>
deemed medically necessary to protect the patient"s best<br>
interest. However, all parties remained in the study to<br>
track hospitalizations and deaths.<br>
A health-related quality of life questionnaire was<br>
also completed by patients at various intervals during<br>
the trial.<br>
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board met<br>
periodically to review the unblinded results and an events<br>
committee adjudicated the cause of death and<br>
hospitalizations in a blinded fashion.<br>
End Points: The primary end point of the study was<br>
total all-cause mortality. Secondary end points<br>
included cardiac mortality, incidence of cardiac<br>
hospitalization, the combined incidence of cardiac<br>
mortality plus hospitalization, and changes in NYHA<br>
class. The effect of spironolactone was also assessed<br>
in subgroups of patients defined on the basis of the<br>
following six pre-randomization variables: ejection<br>
fraction, etiology of heart failure, serum creatinine<br>
concentration, age, angiotensin-converting enzyme<br>
inhibitor type and dose, and digitalis use.<br>
Statistical Analysis: Analysis of all-cause mortality<br>
(the primary end point) included all patients<br>
randomized, according to the randomly assigned treatment<br>
group based on the intention-to-treat principle.<br>
Kaplan-Meier methods were used to construct cumulative<br>
survival curves for the two treatment groups. The<br>
primary comparison between the two groups was based on a<br><br>
log-rank test; Cox proportional-hazards regression<br>
models were developed to explore the effects of baseline<br>
variables on the estimated effect of spironolactone.<br>
Formal assessment of efficacy in this trial used a group<br>
sequential monitoring plan with a Lan-DeMets alpha-<br>
spending approach and an O"Brien-Fleming spending<br>
function.<br>
The sample size was calculated (using a method<br>
developed by Lakatos) on the basis of the following<br>
assumptions: annual mortality rate in the placebo group<br>
would be 38 percent; the risk of death by would be<br>
reduced by 17 percent in the spironolactone group; and<br>
approximately 5 percent of the participants in the<br>
spironolactone group would stop study medication each<br>
year. The power to detect a difference between<br>
treatment groups under these assumptions was set at 90<br>
percent (alpha-level of 0.05 by a two-tailed test) .<br>
The Data Safety Monitoring Board reviewed the<br>
accruing data from this trial for evidence of efficacy<br>
and safety, and at each meeting calculated the projected<br>
cumulative Type I error spent for efficacy. Since two<br>
large trials in heart failure had shown decidedly non-<br>
exponential distributions of time to death, the<br>
computations for group sequential monitoring of all-<br>
cause mortality were based on life-table calculations to<br>
project event rates. The critical z-value for declaring<br>
statistically significant efficacy of treatment planned<br>
at the end of the trial was 2.02, corresponding to a p-<br>
value of 0.043.<br>
Recruitment;. In total, 1,663 patients were enrolled<br>
from 195 centers in 15 countries.<br><br>
Patient Characteristics: Patient demographic, vital<br>
signs, and cardiac status at baseline are summarized in<br>
Table 1A and Table 1B. Data presented in Table 1B have<br>
been audited, updated, and revised relative to Table 1A.<br>
In total, 1,633 patients from 195 centers (15<br>
countries) were enrolled in the trial; 841 were<br>
randomized to placebo and 822 to spironolactone. As<br>
shown in Table 1A and 1B, the baseline characteristics<br>
were similar for patients randomized to placebo and<br>
spironolactone. There were 8 patients (3 placebo, 5<br>
spironolactone) that had history of NYHA Class IV, but<br>
were not Class III or IV at the time of randomization.<br>
Reasons for discontinuation of study medication are<br>
shown in Table 2A. During the trial, 17 patients were<br>
withdrawn from study medication due to cardiac<br>
transplantation, 7 in the spironolactone group -and 10 in<br>
the placebo group; one patient from the placebo group<br>
died 4 days after cardiac transplantation. Patients who<br>
discontinued study medication were followed by regularly<br>
scheduled follow-up telephone contact for determination<br>
of vital status. After a mean follow-up of 24 months,<br>
the average dose of study medication was 32.12 mg for<br>
placebo and 26.75 mg for spironolactone.<br><br><br><br>

Effect of Spironolactone on Survival (See Fig. 1A,<br>
Fig 1B, and Fig. 2);<br>
Among the 1,663 patients randomized, there were 351<br>
deaths (41.7 percent) in the placebo group and 269<br>
deaths (32.7 percent) in the spironolactone group; this<br>
difference represents an estimated 26 percent decrease<br>
in the risk of death by Cox proportional-hazards model<br>
(95 percent confidence interval, 13 to 37 percent; p<br>
1A and 1B). Data presented in Figure 1B have been<br>
audited, updated, and revised relative to Figure 1A.<br>
Preliminary analysis based upon investigator initiated<br>
(unadjudicated) case report forms suggests that the<br>
reduction in mortality observed with spironolactone was<br>
due to decreases in both progressive heart failure and<br>
sudden death.<br>
Data after careful audit and update were revised as<br>
shown in Fig. 1B, Table 2B, Fig. 4, and Table 2C. There<br>
were 386 deaths in the placebo group) (46 percent) and<br>
284 deaths in the spironolactone group (3 5 percent),<br>
representing a 30 percent reduction in the risk of death<br>
(relative risk of death among the patients in the<br>
spironolactone group, 0.70 by a Cox proportional-hazards<br>

risk of death among the patients in the spironolactone<br><br>

The reduction in the risk of death among patients<br>
in the spironolactone group was analyzed in each of six<br>
prespecified subgroups as well as in retrospective<br>
analyses performed according to sex, NYHA class, base-<br>

During the trial, 336 patients in the placebo group<br>
and 260 patients in the spironolactone group were<br>
hospitalized at least once for cardiac reasons (Table<br>

cardiac causes in the placebo group and 515 in the<br>
spironolactone group, representing a 30 percent<br>

The reduction in mortality in patients randomized<br>
to spironolactone was demonstrated regardless of age,<br>

Effect of Spironolactone on Non-Fatal Hospitalizations<br>
(See Fig. 3);<br>
During the trial, 510 (61 percent) placebo-treated<br>
and 445 (54 percent) spironolactone-treated patients had<br>
at least one non-fatal hospitalization, representing<br>
1,595 hospitalizations for the placebo group and 1,347<br>
hospitalizations for the spironolactone group. Using<br>
the Cox proportional-hazards model for the combined end<br>
point analysis of total non-fatal hospitalization and<br>
total all-cause mortality, we observed a 20 percent risk<br>
reduction in the spironolactone group compared to the<br>
placebo group (95 percent confidence interval of 10 to<br>
29 percent, p=0.00017) (Fig. 3).<br><br><br><br>

Effect of Spironolactone on Changes of NYHA Functional<br>
Class: (See Table 3)<br>
Three categories were used to assess changes in the<br>
symptoms of heart failure: improvement, no change, and<br>
worsening or death. The condition of patients who were<br>
in NYHA class III at base line was considered to have<br>
improved if they were in NYHA class I or II at the end<br>
of the study and considered to have worsened if they<br>
were in NYHA class IV (or had died). The condition of<br>
patients who were in NYHA class IV at base line was<br>
considered to have improved if they were in NYHA class<br>
I, II, or III at the end of the study; other patients in<br>
NYHA class IV at base line either had no change at the<br>
end of the study or died. Using the Cochran-Mantel-<br>
Haenszl test for association between drug therapy and<br>
NYHA class outcome (worse, same, improvement), there was<br>
a significant improvement from the baseline NYHA<br>
functional class in the spironolactone group compared to<br>
the placebo group (p=0.001). In the placebo group, the<br>
condition of 33 percent of the patients improved; it did<br>
not change in 18 percent, and it worsened in 48 percent.<br>
In the spironolactone group, the condition of 41 percent<br>
of the patients improved; it did not change in 21<br>
percent, and it worsened in 38 percent. The difference<br>
between groups was significant (P
test). As shown in Fig. 6, 7, and 9, spironolactone co-<br>
therapy resulted in a total reduction in mortality in<br>
patients who were classified as Class III and Class IV<br>
upon entry to this study.<br><br>

Changes in serum potassium, serum creatinine, blood<br>
pressure, and heart rate are shown in Table 4. There<br>
were no significant differences between the two groups<br>
in serum sodium concentration, blood pressure, or heart<br>
rate during the study. The median creatinine and<br>
potassium concentrations did not change in the placebo<br>
group during the first year of follow-up, the period for<br>
which the data were most complete. During the same<br>
period, however, the median creatinine concentration in<br>
the spironolactone group increased by approximately 0.05<br>
to 0.10 mg per deciliter (4 to 9 µmol per liter) and the<br>
median potassium concentration increased by 0.30 mmol<br>
per liter. The differences between the two groups were<br>

Effect of Spironolactone on PIIINP and Mortality<br>
A sample of 253 patients from within the study<br>
group participated in a substudy (CHF NYHA III and IV,<br>
mean age 69, left ventricular ejection fraction ("LVEF")<br>
=26%, ischemic heart disease=46%, all were on<br>
conventional therapy, 92% on ACE inhibitors). Patients<br>
were randomized to placebo or spironolactone 15.5 to 50<br>
mg/day. Serum PIIINP was measured at baseline and 6<br>
months after randomization. Mean survival was 24<br>
months.<br>
Baseline serum PIIINP level was 4.6 (s.d.=2.5) and<br>
was similar in the spironolactone and placebo group. At<br>
6 months, PIIINP decreased in the spironolactone from<br>
4.9 (s.d.=2.7) to 4.1 (s.d.=1.9) (p=0.005), but not in<br>
the placebo group (p=0.65). Baseline levels above the<br>
95% CL of controls (&gt;4.2 ng/1) were associated with an<br>
increased risk of death in the placebo group (RR=1.89<br>
[1.12-3.2](p=0.01)), but not in the spironolactone group<br>
(RR=0.69[0.45-1.36](p=0.39)). More marked survival<br>
benefit of spironolactone treatment was observed in<br>
patients with a baseline PIIINP &gt; 4.2 µg/1 as compared<br>
to patients with lower baseline levels of PIIINP<br>
(RR=0.54 [0.33-0.88](p
2.31](p=0.28) . The mortality relative risk reduction<br>
was 33% in the high risk group. These findings were<br><br>
unchanged after adjustment for other prognostic factors<br>
(NYHA class, serum creatinine and age).<br>
It is suggested by these studies that in patients<br>
with CHF, elevated serum PIIINP was significantly<br>
associated with excess mortality. Spironolactone<br>
decreased serum PIIINP and suggested that the beneficial<br>
effect of spironolactone on survival in patients with<br>
CHF may be explained, in part, by the lowering<br>
extracellular matrix production or turnover.<br>
Spironolactone Effect to Lower Brain Natriuretic Peptide<br>
Levels is Associated with Reduced Risk of Mortality<br>
A sample of 107 patients from within the study<br>
group group participated in a substudy (NYHA III-IV),<br>
mean LVEF 25%). Patients received standard CHF therapy<br>
and 25 mg/day spironolactone or placebo. Brain<br>
Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels were measured at<br>
baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. Results were<br>
expressed in pg/ml, geometric mean [95%CL] and data were<br>
compared using a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test.<br><br><br>
Thus, Spironolactone treatment, which results in a<br>
significant decrease in fatalities and non-fatal<br>
hospitalizations, also results in a decrease in BNP<br>
levels and may reflect the beneficial effect on the left<br>
ventricular remodeling though the reduction of<br>
myocardial stretching.<br>
Table 7: Relative Risk of Reduction in Mortality<br>
Analyzed by Baseline Characteristics<br><br>
Dosing based on Natriuretic peptides and PIIINP<br>
The natriuretic peptides are a group of<br>
structurally similar but genetically distinct peptides<br>
that have diverse actions in cardiovascular, renal, and<br>
endocrine homeostasis. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)<br>
and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are of myocardial<br><br>
cell origin and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is of<br>
endothelial origin. ANP and BNP bind to the natriuretic<br>
peptide-A receptor (NPR-A) . which, via 3",5"-cyclic<br>
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), mediates natriuresis,<br>
vasodilation, renin inhibition, antimitogenesis, and<br>
lusitropic properties.<br>
ANP is thought to play a role in renal regulation<br>
of salt balance by reducing tubular reabsorption of<br>
sodium and chloride. ANP can excite cardiac nerve<br>
endings and invoke a decrease in arterial blood pressure<br>
and a reduction in renal sympathetic nerve activity.<br>
Congestive heart failure represents a pathological state<br>
in which the activation of the natriuretic peptides<br>
exceeds those of all other states and is associated with<br>
poor long-term prognosis in heart failure.<br>
Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) production is<br>
induced in the ventricle under pathological<br>
circumstances and after exposure to hypertrophic agents<br>
including the a-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine.<br>
Release of ANF is significantly under conditions of<br>
hypertension and infarction. Even though ventricular<br>
natriuretic factor (ANF) has been considered to be a<br>
specific molecular marker of hypertrophy, its role in<br>
hypertrophy is unclear. Levin, E. R., Gardner, D. G. ,<br>
and Samson, W. K. (1998) N. Engl. J. Med. 339, 321-328<br>
Extracellular matrix turnover is one of the determinants<br>
of vascular constructive remodeling and may be monitored<br>
by measuring the blood level of procollagen type III<br>
aminoterminal propeptide ("PIIINP"). In congestive heart<br>
failure, extracellular matrix turnover is a major<br>
determinant of cardiac remodeling, diastolic function<br>
and pumping capacity.<br><br>
Accordingly, dosing of therapeutic agents for<br>
congestive heart disease may be determined and adjusted<br>
based on measurement of blood concentrations of PIIINP,<br>
ANF, ANP, or BNP. A decrease in blood PIIINP level<br>
relative to baseline PIIINP level prior to<br>
administration of the aldosterone antagonist and during<br>
administration indicate a decrease in extracellular<br>
matrix turnover and therefore provides a correlation<br>
with inhibition of congestive heart disease. Similarly,<br>
levels of ANF, ANP, and BNP and may be relative to<br>
baseline levels prior to administration of the<br>
aldosterone antagonist and during administration to<br>
indicate levels of efficacy.<br>
Administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme<br>
inhibitor and the aldosterone antagonist may take place<br>
sequentially in separate formulations, or may be<br>
accomplished by simultaneous administration in a single<br>
formulation or separate formulations. Administration<br>
may be accomplished by oral route, or by intravenous,<br>
intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. The<br>
formulation may be in the form of a bolus, or in the<br>
form of aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile<br>
injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions and<br>
suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders or<br>
granules having one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
carriers or diluents, or a binder such as gelatin or<br>
hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose, together with one or<br>
more of a lubricant, preservative, surface-active or<br>
dispersing agent.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition may be in the form of, for example, a<br>
tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharma-<br>
ceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a<br><br>
dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active<br>
ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are tablets or<br>
capsules. The ACE inhibitor may be present in an amount<br>
from about i to 200 mg, preferably from about 2 to 150<br>
mg, depending upon the specific ACE inhibitor selected.<br>
A suitable daily dose for a mammal may vary widely<br>
depending on the condition of the patient and other<br>
factors. The ALDO antagonist may be present in an amount<br>
of from about 1 to 400 mg, preferably from about 2 to<br>
150 mg, depending upon the specific ALDO antagonist<br>
compound selected and the specific disease state being<br>
targeted for the combination therapy.<br>
For disease states which require prevention,<br>
reduction or treatment of a cardiovascular disease state<br>
without incidence of hyperkalemia, for example, the ALDO<br>
antagonist component, typically spironolactone, will be<br>
present in the combination therapy in an amount in a<br>
range from about 1 mg to about 25 mg per dose per day.<br>
Examples of various fixed combinations of ACE<br>
inhibitor and ALDO antagonist representing a "double<br>
therapy" of the invention are as follows:<br><br><br>
1Dose given 2 times per day<br>
2Dose given once per day<br>
The present invention further comprises a<br>
composition comprising an angiotensin converting enzyme<br>
inhibitor, an aldosterone antagonist, a loop diuretic<br>
and digoxin, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
esters and prodrugs thereof. Preferably, the<br>
composition comprises a first amount of an angiotensin<br>
converting enzyme inhibitor, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof; a second<br>
amount of an aldosterone antagonist, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug<br>
thereof; a third amount of a loop diuretic, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug<br>
thereof; a fourth amount of digoxin, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug<br>
thereof; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br>
wherein the first, second, third and fourth amounts in<br><br>
combination comprise a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of said inhibitor, antagonist, loop diuretic and<br>
digoxin. More preferably, the aldosterone antagonist is<br>
selected from spironolactone and eplerenone.<br>
The active ingredients may also be administered by<br>
injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline,<br>
dextrose or water may be used as a suitable carrier.<br>
The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition<br>
with the combination therapy of this invention is<br>
selected in accordance with a variety of factors,<br>
including the type, age, weight, sex and medical<br>
condition of the patient, the severity of the disease,<br>
the route of administration, and the particular compound<br>
employed, and thus may vary widely.<br>
For therapeutic purposes, the active components of<br>
this combination therapy invention are ordinarily<br>
combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate to the<br>
indicated route of administration. If administered per<br>
os, the components may be admixed with lactose, sucrose,<br>
starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids,<br>
cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium<br>
stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of<br>
phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum,<br>
sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, and then tableted or encapsulated for con-<br>
venient administration. Such capsules or tablets may<br>
contain a controlled-release formulation as may be<br>
provided in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxy-<br>
propylmethyl cellulose. Formulations for parenteral<br>
administration may be in the form of aqueous or non-<br>
aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or<br>
suspensions. These solutions and suspensions may be<br><br>
prepared from sterile powders or granules having one or<br>
more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for use in<br>
the formulations for oral administration. The components<br>
may be dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil,<br>
peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride,<br>
and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of<br>
administration are well and widely known in the<br>
pharmaceutical art.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for use in the<br>
treatment methods of the invention may be administered<br>
in oral form or by intravenous administration. Oral<br>
administration of the combination therapy is preferred.<br>
Dosing for oral administration may be with a regimen<br>
calling for single daily dose, or for a single dose<br>
every other day, or for multiple, spaced doses<br>
throughout the day. The active agent"s which make up the<br>
combination therapy may be administered simultaneously,<br>
either in a combined dosage form or in separate dosage<br>
forms intended for substantially simultaneous oral<br>
administration. The active agents which make up the<br>
combination therapy may also be administered<br>
sequentially, with either active component being<br>
administered by a regimen calling for two-step<br>
ingestion. Thus, a regimen may call for sequential<br>
administration of the active agents with spaced-apart<br>
ingestion of the separate, active agents. The time<br>
period between the multiple ingestion steps may range<br>
from a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the<br>
properties of each active agent such a potency,<br>
solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and<br>
kinetic profile of the agent, as well as depending upon<br>
the age and condition of the patient. The active agents<br>
of the combined therapy whether administered<br><br>
simultaneously, substantially simultaneously, or<br>
sequentially, may involve a regimen calling for<br>
administration of one active agent by oral route and the<br>
other active agent by intravenous route. Whether the<br>
active agents of the combined therapy are administered<br>
by oral or intravenous route, separately or together,<br>
each such active agent will be contained in a suitable<br>
pharmaceutical formulation of pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable excipients, diluents or other formulations<br>
components. Examples of suitable pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable formulations containing the active components<br>
for oral administration are given below. Even though<br>
such formulations list both active agents together in<br>
the same recipe; it is appropriate for such recipe to be<br>
utilized for a formulation containing one of the active<br>
components,<br>
