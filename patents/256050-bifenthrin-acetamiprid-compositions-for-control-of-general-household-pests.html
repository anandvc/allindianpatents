				<td>BIFENTHRIN/ACETAMIPRID COMPOSITIONS FOR CONTROL OF GENERAL HOUSEHOLD PESTS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/535,373, filed January 9, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to insecticidal compositions.    In<br>
particular, it pertains to compositions of insecticides useful for control of general household pests.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
General household pests are insects that have the potential to cause nuisance or harm to person and property, such as the German cockroach. American cockroach, Smokey-Brown cockroach, Oriental cockroach, house fly, biting fly, filth fly, red imported fire ant (RIFA), odorous house ant, carpenter ant, pharaoh ant, Argentine ant, mosquito, tick, flea, sowbug, pillbug, centipede, spider, silverfish, scorpion and bed bug. The following are some examples of nuisance or harm to persons and property. Cockroaches and flies can appear in people's living environment at any place and at any time. They generally contaminate food and articles subjecting people to threats of bacteria and viruses. The continued proliferation of colonies of red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, are becoming a serious problem in the United States. Fire ants are attracted to electrical circuits and can cause failures in transformers, cables, connectors and related electrical hardware. Fire ants also can sting persons or animals and generally cause a localized allergic reaction on the area of the skin punctured by their stinging. Some individuals suffer a severe allergic reaction that can lead to anaphylactic shock, which can be fatal if not treated promptly. Many of the general household pests are potentially dangerous since their bites or stings can similarly lead to allergic reaction.<br>
Insecticidal compositions have commonly been used to control general household pests. Of primary concern in developing an insecticidal composition to<br><br>
control general household pests is the insecticide's 'knockdown' and 'mortality' characteristics. Knockdown refers to quick, short-term immobilization or death of the pest. Pests can recover from knockdown immobilization. Knockdown usually occurs within 10-30 minutes, but the timing is pest dependant. For example, knockdown for house flies can occur at up to 2 hours because of their tolerance for insecticides and recovery abilities. Mortality refers to death of the pest. An optimal insecticide composition would have knockdown and mortality rates at or near 100% for all general household pests. Current insecticidal compositions, for example, have red imported fire ant and German cockroach mortality rates approaching 100%, but their knockdown rates are only 80% or less for red imported fire ants and 40% or less for German cockroaches. Improved knockdown and mortality rates are desirable to ensure effective protection of persons and property from general household pests.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has now been found that a new insecticidal composition significantly improves knockdown and mortality rates to general household pests. Specifically, an insecticidal composition containing a mixture of bifenthrin and acetamiprid, results in a continuous chemical barrier that provides both high knockdown and mortality rates to general household pests. Other aspects of the present invention will also be apparent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been unexpectedly found that an insecticidal composition containing bifenthrin and acetamiprid, results in high knockdown and mortality rates when applied to general household pests. A preferred liquid insecticide composition of the present invention is comprised of from 0.001% by weight to 0.12% by weight of bifenthrin and from 0.001% by weight to 0.20% by weight of acetamiprid.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for controlling general household pests comprising applying an insecticidally effective amount of a composition comprised of bifenthrin and acetamiprid to a locus where general household pest control is needed or expected to be needed. Preferred general<br><br>
household pests are selected from German cockroach, American cockroach, Smokey-Brown cockroach, Oriental cockroach, house fly, biting fly, filth fly, red imported fire ant (RIFA), odorous house ant, caipenter ant, pharaoh ant, Argentine<br>
ant, mosquito, tick; flea, sowbug, pillbug, centipede, spider, silverfish, scorpion and<br>
&gt;.<br>
bed bug. Preferred locus or loci are selected from a general household pest-infested structure, a structure that is expected to be general household pest-infested, or a location adjacent to the structures.<br>
The amount of each insecticide in the composition can be varied over a wide range depending upon the target pest and the level of control desired. For controlling German cockroaches, a preferred liquid insecticide composition of the present invention is comprised of 0.001% by weight to 0.06% by weight of bifenthrin and 0.005% by weight to 0.10% by weight of acetamiprid. For controlling Red Imported Fire Ants, a preferred liquid insecticide composition of the present invention is comprised of 0.0575% by weight to 0.0625% by weight of bifenthrin and 0.025% by weight to 0.05% by weight of acetamiprid. For controlling house flies, a preferred liquid insecticide composition of the present invention is comprised of 0.001% by weight to 0.005% by weight of bifenthrin and 0.01% by weight to 0.02% by weight of acetamiprid. For controlling bed bugs, a preferred liquid insecticide composition of the present invention is comprised of 0.0575% by weight to 0.0625% by weight of bifenthrin and 0.025% by weight to 0.05% by weight of acetamiprid.<br>
A liquid insecticide is any formulation containing an insecticide where the formulation is dispensed in an aqueous medium prior to its application to a locus where general household pest control is needed. That is to say, a liquid insecticide is made up of 1) an insecticide, 2) an aqueous medium and 3) other additives conventionally employed in insecticidal formulations (e.g. surfactants, wetting agents, freeze/thaw agents). All formulations of insecticides that are or can be dispensed in an aqueous medium prior to application are, therefore, within the scope of the present invention (e.g. Micro-emulsions, Suspension concentrates, Emulsifiable concentrates, Wettable powders, Water dispersible granules, Capsule suspensions, Emulsifiable granules or combinations thereof).<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be derived from commercially available formulations of insecticides. For example, bifenthrin, sold<br><br>
by FMC Corporation under the names and trademarks of TALSTAR® GC FLOWABLE INSECTICIDEMITICEDE, or TALSTARONE® MULTI-INSECTICIDE, to name a few, find utility in the present invention. Formulations of acetamiprid that are particularly useful in the context of the present invention include, without limitation, acetamiprid (sold under the name and trademark of INTRUDER), sold as a 70% wettable powder. Using methods known to one skilled in the art, the above-mentioned formulations of insecticides can be dispersed in an aqueous medium to provide a composition containing an insecticidally effective amount of the insecticide.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the present invention, but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope. The examples set forth certain biological data illustrating the efficacy of the compositions of the present invention in controlling general household pests. Each example embodies a separate test wherein the pests were randomly selected from a population at a random age. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts, percentages, and the like are by weight. The spray chambers used in the examples were approximately 73-76 inches tall, 73-83 inches long and 31-33 inches deep with an adjustable shelf (approximately 22 inches deep) and a movable spray nozzle. The spray chambers were calibrated to deliver a volume of approximately 1 gallon of liquid per 1000 square feet of area at about 14-40 pounds per square inch of pressure. A DeVilbiss hand held sprayer (Atomizer model 152) manufactured by DeVilbiss located in Glendale Heights, Illinois was used in the testing with house flies. The DeVilbiss was used to apply approximately 3-5 milliliters of product at about 10 pounds per square inch.<br>
