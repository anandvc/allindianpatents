PHASED ARRAY PLANAR ANTENNA FOR TRACKING A MOVING TARGET AND TRACKING METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to phased array antennas and planar antennas and more specifically to phased array   antennas of the kind suitable to be mounted onto   moving  platforms   e.g.   aircrafts,   ships,   cars   etc.,   used   for   satellite<br>
 5     communication, or for tracking moving targets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Nowadays, many moving platforms (e.g. aircrafts, ships, cars, etc.) are required to have satellite communication capabilities. One exemplary requirement relates to an entertainment system for .offering passengers with e.g.<br>
10     internet access, live television broadcast and the like.<br>
During motion, the moving platform (e.g. the aircraft) is engaged in communication with a particular satellite, tracking it across the sky until it disappears over the horizon, and prior to its disappearance establishes communication with another satellite. Therefore, antennas on-board the moving<br>
15     platforms are typically equipped with suitable positioning and tracking systems.<br>
US Patent No. 5,796,370 discloses a dual polarization antenna for direct<br>
broadcast satellites. The antenna is orientable, directional and capable of use as a<br>
transmit and/or receive antenna. It includes at least one reflector, at least one<br>
source of electromagnetic radiation including means for exciting the source with<br>
20 	two orthogonal linear polarizations and a mechanical system for positioning and holding the source and the reflector. The orientation of the antenna is made up of depointing and rotation about a preferred direction of propagation of the radiation and the mechanical system enables such rotation while keeping the source fixed,<br><br>
WO 2006/057000	PCT/IL2005/001272<br>
3<br>
so conserving the orientation of the orthogonal linear polarization. A preferred embodiment of the antenna includes a parabolic main reflector and a hyperbolic auxiliary reflector in a Cassegrain geometry, and the mechanical system enables rotation of both reflectors about the preferred direction of radiation and holds the <br>
5 	source fixed to conserve the orthogonal linear polarization axes of the beam. Applications include radar, direct broadcast satellites and telecommunications employing frequency re-use by polarization diversity, especially advantageous in space and airborne applications.<br>
US Patent No. 6,034,634 discloses an inexpensive high gain antenna for<br>
10 	use on terminals communicating with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites which include an elevation table mounted for accurate movement about a transverse axis on an azimuth turntable mounted for rotational movement about a central axis. A plurality of antenna elements forming a phased array antenna is mounted on the top of the elevation table and have a scan plane which is parallel to and<br>
15 	extends through the transverse axis of the elevation table. The antenna may be both mechanically and electrically scanned and is used to perform handoffs from one LEO satellite to another by positioning the elevation table of the antenna with its bore sight in a direction intermediate the two satellites and with the scan plane of the antenna passing through both satellites. At the moment of handoff,<br>
20 	the antenna beam is electronically scanned from one satellite to another without any loss in data communication during the process.<br>
US Patent No. 6,034,643 discloses a directional beam antenna device that includes an antenna supporting member which is supported on a base in such a manner as to be rotatable about a first rotational axis; an antenna portion which is<br>
25 	supported on the antenna supporting member in such a manner as to be rotatable about a second rotational axis which is perpendicular to an antenna aperture and is inclined at a first angle with respect to the first rotational axis, the direction of an antenna beam being inclined at a second angle with respect to the second rotational axis; a first driving unit for rotating the antenna supporting member<br>
30     about the first rotational axis with respect to the base; and a second driving unit<br><br>
WO 2006/057000	PCT/IL2005/001272<br>
4<br>
for rotating the antenna portion about the second rotational axis with respect to the antenna supporting member. A directional beam controlling apparatus is provided with a controlling unit for controlling an elevation angle of the antenna beam to a target value by causing the second driving unit to rotate the antenna <br>
5	 portion with respect to the antenna supporting member, and for controlling an azimuth angle of the antenna beam to a target value by causing the first driving unit to rotate the antenna supporting member with respect to the base.<br>
PCT Application No. WO2004/075339 discloses a low profile receiving and/or transmitting antenna that includes an array of antenna elements that<br>
10 	collect and focuses millimeter wave or other radiation. The antenna elements are physically configured so that radiation at a tuning wavelength impinging on the antenna at a particular angle of incidence is collected by the elements and focused in-phase. Two or more mechanical rotators may be disposed to alter the angle of incidence of incoming or outgoing radiation to match the particular<br>
15     angle of incidence.<br>
Also relating to positioning of satellite communication antennas on-board moving platforms are US Patent Nos. 6,400,315, 6,218,999, 6,741,841, 6,356,239, and 6,751,801.<br>
As is known, polarization of a linear polarized radio wave may be rotated<br>
20 	as the signal passes through any anomalies (such as Faraday rotation) in the ionosphere. Furthermore, due to the position of the Earth with respect to the satellite, geometric differences may vary due to relative movements between the satellite and the communicating station (e.g. aircraft, fixed station, etc.). Therefore, most geostationary satellites operate with circular polarization, as<br>
25 	circular polarization will keep the signal constant regardless of the above-mentioned anomalies. However, some geostationary satellites use linear polarization. In linear polarization, a misalignment of polarization of 45 degrees will degrade the signal up to 3 dB and if misaligned 90 degrees, the attenuation can  be  20  dB  or  more.   Furthermore,  polarization  purity  is  required  by<br>
30     international regulation of satellite communication. Therefore, on-board antenna<br><br>
WO 2006/057000	PCT/IL2005/001272<br>
5<br>
systems for communication with a satellite using linear polarization need to provide polarization tracking.<br>
Furthermore, on-board antenna systems for moving platforms are required to be relatively small in size and low in profile (diameter and height) in order to<br>
5 	adapt to the overall design and specifically the aerodynamic design of the moving platform. However, polarization tracking typically requires a considerable antenna size, for compensating for losses of signal strength involved in polarization tracking.<br>
There is  a need in the art for an  improved antenna that provides<br>
10     positioning capabilities as well as polarization tracking capabilities. There is a<br>
further need in the art for an improved antenna suitable for use on board moving<br>
       platforms and specifically airborne platforms and aircrafts, which is relatively<br>
small and has low profile (e.g. diameter of about 90cm or less).<br>

DESCRIPTION OF A SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to certain embodiments, the present invention provides for a planar antenna and preferably a phased array antenna system to be disposed onto a platform, and preferably a moving platform (e.g. airborne platform) for <br>
5     transmitting and/or receiving RF signal having linear polarization to and from at least one target moving relatively to the platform (e.g. geostationary satellite). The antenna system provides positioning capabilities as well as polarization tracking capabilities, thereby improving communication of RF signal having linear polarization between the platform and a target.<br>
10	Fig. 1 is a general side view (in cross section) of an antenna system 10<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention. Antenna system 10 includes, inter -alia, an azimuth driving subsystem 12 defining a horizontal axis B and a ZB axis perpendicular thereto (constituting the central axis of the antenna system). Antenna system 10 further includes a tilt driving subsystem 14 defining an axis A<br>
15 	and a ZA axis perpendicular thereto. Also shown is axis D, perpendicular to both B and ZB. A substantially planar active subsystem 16 is coupled to the tilt driving subsystem 14, along axis A, and is operable to perform electronic scanning within cone C (preferably providing scanning angle of ±60°). Axis ZA represents the bore sight of the antenna. The active subsystem 16 is connected to a roll<br>
20     subsystem 18.<br>
	According to an embodiment of the present invention (shown in fig. 1),<br>
antenna system 10 has four degrees of freedom, allowing it to selectively perform<br>
electronic scanning, azimuth, and roll movements, as well as  tilt adjustment as<br>
required for positioning and polarization tracking, in the following manner:<br>
25	-    electronic scanning within scan cone C.<br>
-	the azimuth driving subsystem rotates the tilt driving subsystem 14 (and the active subsystem 16 accommodated thereon) around axis ZB.<br>
-	the tilt driving subsystem 14 rotates the active subsystem 16 around axis D, thereby tilting the active subsystem (axis A) with respect to<br>
30	axis B.<br><br>
WO 2006/057000	PCT/IL2005/001272<br>
11<br>
-	the roll subsystem rotates the active subsystem 16 around axis ZA.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, generally shown in<br>
Fig. 4, a fixed tilt is provided, e.g. an angle in the range of 20°-30° between axis B and axis A. According to this embodiment, positioning as well as polarization <br>
5     tracking are carried out based on movements in only three degrees of freedom, as follows:<br>
-	electronic scanning within scan cone C.<br>
-	the azimuth driving subsystem rotates the tilt driving subsystem 14<br>
(and the active subsystem 16 accommodated thereon) around axis ZB.<br>
10	-    the roll subsystem rotates the active subsystem 16 around axis ZA.<br>
As will be detailed further on, all degrees of freedom are controlled by a common control system (not shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 4) and operate in synchronization to provide positioning and polarization tracking. The selective nature of the dynamic operation of the various subsystems will be explained<br>
15     further on, with reference to Fig. 7.<br>
Turning back to the embodiment of the invention shown in Fig. 1: Fig. 2 is a more detailed side view (in cross section) of the antenna system 10 shown in Fig. 1. According to an embodiment of the invention, antenna system 10 incorporates an active subsystem 16 which comprises an electronically scanned,<br>
20 	substantially planar phased array antenna 15, e.g. as shown in Fig. 3. Antenna 15 is constructed from two interleaved arrays of radiating elements 73 and 75, orthogonal to each other, having linear polarization, designed to transmit and receive RF radiation in different frequency bends, respectively. According to an embodiment of the invention, the radiating elements are the known wide-band<br>
25 	Vivaldi antennas, which may be excited by a transmit module TX, receive module RX or a combination of TX and RX. (TX and RX modules are not shown in Fig. 3). As is known in the art, antenna 15 further comprises, inter alia, PCB 78, heat-sinks 80 and DC/DC converters 83. As is also known in the art, the two interleaved arrays 73 and 75, which have orthogonal linear polarization, are<br>
30     suitable for communication purposes since transmitted and received beams have<br><br>
WO 2006/057000	PCT/IL2005/001272<br>
-12 -<br>
different frequencies, thus do not interfere with each other. According to an<br>
embodiment of the invention, antenna 15 is designed for operating in the Ku-<br>
band, e.g.   transmission (from aircraft to satellite) in the 14-14.5 GHz band,<br>
receiving (satellite to aircraft) in the 10.95-11.7GHz band.<br>
5	Turning back to Fig. 2: the active subsystem 16 further accommodates roll<br>
driving subsystem 18, comprising roll plate 28 to which the antenna 15 is connected. Roll plate 28 has a hollow shaft mounted on roll bearings 30 and is movable by roll motor 35 and pinion 38. Roll subsystem 18 is thus designed to provide roll movement (i.e. rotate around axis ZA, as shown in Fig. 1), thereby<br>
10 	allowing antenna 15 to keep matching its linear polarization to that of the tracked satellite. According to an embodiment of the invention, the roll movement is limited to +180°. The Antenna 15 is fed via e.g. a rotary-joint slip-rings block (not shown), assembled in the hollow shaft, or by flexible cables (not shown).<br>
As known in the art with respect to electronically scanned phased array<br>
15 	antennas, better antenna performance is achieved by maintaining the elevation angle above the plane of the array above a certain value, typically about 30° or less. Therefore, according to one embodiment of the invention, a tilt angle of up to ±30°, is combined with an azimuth movement for yielding elevation coverage of ± 90°, as follows.<br>
20	Tilt subsystem 14 (shown in Figs. 1 and 2) comprises a tilt base 32, to<br>
which is connected the radiating subsystem 16, via the roll subsystem 18. Tilt base 32 is movable around tilt axis D, e.g. by a motor-gear unit (not shown), coupled with a gear, (not shown), attached to tilt shaft 42. Tilt subsystem 14 is connected to the azimuth subsystem 12 by side plates 45 via tilt bearings (not<br>
25     shown).<br>
Azimuth driving subsystem 12 (shown in both Figs. 1 and 2) comprises azimuth turntable 48, rotatable around axis ZB. According to an embodiment of the invention, azimuth turntable 48 has a hollow shaft, on which azimuth bearings 50 are installed. Azimuth bearings 50 are carried by pedestal base 52,<br>
30     which is used to install the antenna 10 onto the mounting base of the moving<br><br>

platform (e.g. an aircraft). Azimuth movement is achieved by azimuth motor 55<br>
and azimuth pinion 58 meshed with azimuth gear 65. A rotary joint-slip rings<br>
block 63 is attached to the hollow shaft of the azimuth table 48, to allow<br>
conveying RF radiation and electricity.<br>
5	The azimuth, tilt and roll driving subsystems (elements 12, 14 and 18) are<br>
coupled to and controlled by a control system (not shown in Figs. 1 and 2). The common control system and its operation will be discussed further on with reference to Figs. 5 to 7.<br>
As is clear to a person versed in the art, digital, mechanical, or other servo<br>
10 	components, as well as encoder components (not shown in Fig. 2) used for controlling the various movements, can readily be integrated in the system. It should be understood that the invention is not limited by the type and kind of drivers (motors, gears, etc.) used, and other driving components, such as pancake torque motors directly mounted onto the shafts, can be appropriately used<br>
15     without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
When used in aircrafts, the antenna system of the present invention can be implemented as a relatively small and low profile system (e.g. diameter of about 90cm or less, height of about 40cm or less). The system can be flatly mounted e.g. on the crown of the aircraft, thereby providing the aircraft with improved<br>
20 	communication capabilities without harming the aerodynamic design of the aircraft.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 5 there will follow a description of the common control system mentioned above. Fig. 5 is a block diagram of an antenna system 100 according to the embodiment of the invention shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned<br>
25 	before, antenna system 100 is mounted on-board a moving platform (e.g. an aircraft) and is used for communication with a moving target (e.g. a satellite). As shown the active subsystem 110, roll driving subsystem 120, tilt driving subsystem 130 and azimuth driving subsystem 140 are all coupled to a common control system 150. The control system 150 comprises, inter-alia, a central<br><br>
WO 2006/057000                                                                    14	PCT/IL2005/001272<br>
processing unit (CPU) 160 and a memory 170 coupled to the CPU. Note that the invention is not limited to the exemplary configuration of the control system.<br>
Control system 150 is connectable to external systems not shown in Fig. 5 (e.g. data systems accommodated onto the moving platform (e.g. global<br>
5 	positioning system (GPS), inertial navigation system (INS), localization system and the like) for receiving position data. Control system 150 accommodates a data input module 180 coupled to the CPU 160 and configured for providing position data relating to the relative position of the moving platform with respect to the moving target. Control system 150 further accommodates a positioning<br>
10 	and polarization tracking module 190 coupled to the CPU 160 and configured for providing control signals for driving the active, roll, tilt and azimuth subsystems 110-140.<br>
The principles of positioning and polarization tracking according to an embodiment of the invention will now be detailed with reference to an exemplary<br>
15 	scene and exemplary control parameters shown in Figs. 6a-6c. Fig. 6a shows the moving platform, aircraft 202 in this exemplary scene, and the aircraft's coordinate system 204 used for describing the movements of the antenna system according to an embodiment of the invention, in which X axis starches along the aircraft's wings;  Y axis starches along the aircraft's body; and Z axis is<br>
20 	perpendicular to X and Y. The antenna system is mounted on top of the aircraft 202 and therefore, with reference to Figs. 1 and 3, Z axis shown in Fig. 6a is axis ZB, the center axis of the antenna. The top of the scanning cone (element C shown in Fig. 1, not shown in Fig. 6a) located on the surface of the active subsystem (element 15 shown in Fig. 1) and along the center axis of the antenna<br>
25 	is the origin O of the coordinate system 206. Also shown in Fig. 6a is a moving target, satellite 206 in this exemplary scene. The position of the satellite 206 is defined by its position vector S, represented by 9S (the angle between S axis and Z axis), and the angular components ax, av and az.<br>
Fig. 6b illustrate the cone of broadside directions AC of the antenna<br>
30     system, resulting from a 360° rotation of   the active subsystem (element 16<br><br>
WO 2006/057000	PCT/IL2005/001272<br>
-15-<br>
shown in Fig. 1) by the azimuth subsystem (element 12 shown in Fig. 1). In other words, the cone of broadside directions AC is the result of a 360° rotation of axis ZA about axis ZB (both shown in Fig. 1). The solid angle T of the cone AC equals to the angular orientation (the so-called 'tilt') between plains A and B<br>
5 	(shown in Fig. 1), as detailed above with reference to Figs. 1 and 3. Note that by one embodiment, of the invention, T is changeable (e.g. as shown in Fig. 2). By another embodiment, T is fixed (e.g. as shown in Fig. 3).<br>
Fig. 6c illustrates an exemplary set of control parameters and a desired disposition of the antenna system mounted onboard the aircraft with respect to <br>
10     the satellite, in which the linear polarization direction of the antenna system is aligned with that of the satellite. There are shown:<br>
	qS: the angle between S and the central axis of the antenna (ZB);<br>
T: the tilt angle of the broadside (ZA) with respect to the central axis of<br>
            the antenna (ZB);<br>
15	qscan: the solid angle of scanning cone C shown in Fig. 1;<br>
S: the position vector of the satellite, represented by (ax, ay, az), (aq, ap); V: the broadside vector of the antenna (pointing along ZA, the central<br>
             axis of the antenna), represented by <br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, in the desired disposition,<br>
20     V lays at ZB-S plane. During the relative movement of the aircraft and the<br>
satellite, 9s may vary from zero to 90°. In order to keep the linear polarization<br>
direction of the antenna aligned with that of the satellite, qscan is required to<br>
follow the following relations:<br>
(1) qscan ³9S - T    if 9S &gt; T, or<br>
25	(2) qscan £ 9S - T    if 9S 
In other words, in the desired disposition, S passes through the scanning<br>
cone C while substantially intersecting the cone top. According to another<br>
embodiment of the invention, in the desired position S substantially coincides<br>
with the center axis of the scanning cone to yield minimal scanning angle, up to<br>
30     zero (no scanning is required).<br><br>

In order to achieve the desired disposition of the antenna system with<br>
respect to the satellite, the following sequence of operations 300 shown in Fig. 7<br>
is carried out by the common control unit in a cyclic manner (element 150 shown<br>
         in Fig. 5) according to an embodiment of the invention:<br>
5	In operation 310: receiving and storing the position and polarization of the<br>
satellite (e.g. using lookout tables), and the position and polarization of the antenna (e.g. using data received from the host aircraft's systems), constituting position and polarization data of the current cycle of operation. Note that the position and polarization data can be achieved from various sources, e.g.<br>
10 	localizer of the moving target, GPS (Global Positioning System) system, INS (Inertial Navigation System) system, altitude system measuring the altitude of the moving platform, encoders measuring the changes in position of the azimuth, roll and tilt subsystem, and more. Note that the invention is not bound by the type of information, and the manner used for detecting the position and polarization of<br>
15	the satellite and the antenna and evaluating their relative disposition in a timely manner. Also, note that the invention is not bound by the specific set of control parameters that are used. Using the coordinate systems shown in Figs. 6a-6c, at this stage the following control parameters are defined in a manner known per<br><br>
20	In operation 312: the current control parameters are checked e.g. if no<br>
previous data regarding this satellite is stored, or that current data differs from stored data, indicating that a certain adjustment of one of the degrees of freedom is required.<br>
In operations 314, 316 and 318: the specific control parameters per<br>
25 	subsystem are evaluated, e.g. as described further below. Note that the invention is not bound by the specified control parameters and relations, and others may be used.<br>
In operation 320: if needed (as evaluated in operations 314, 316 and 318), providing azimuth and roll rotation, and if possible and needed, providing tilt<br>
30     rotation. Note that the relative position and polarization of the satellite and the<br><br><br><br><br>
aircraft is dynamic, due to the relative movement of the satellite and the aircraft, and therefore at any instance in which new position and polarization data is received, the need for azimuth, roll and if possible - tilt adjustments is evaluated.<br>
		The azitnuth adjustment (carried out by e.g. the azimuth driving subsystem 12,<br>
5    shown in both Figs. 1 and 2) is performed in order to rotate the broadside (ZA) to the<br>
ZB-S plain. Therefore, the required asimuth adjustment equals the change, in the relative<br>
displacement of the aircraft and the satellite, when projected over the ZB-S plain.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the azim adjustm.c-.nt is<br>
provided            and follows relation (3):<br>
10	<br><br>
The roll adjustment (carried out by the roll driving subsystem 18 siown in Figs.<br>
                        1 and 2) is performed in order to adjust the direction of polarization of the antenna<br>
according to changes in the direction of the polarization of the satellite. According to an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the roll adjustment cVou is provided if (cte, a,,) £ (aW9,<br><br><br><br>
As described above with reference to Fig. 1, the angle T may be changed (by use<br>
of the driven subsystem 14 as shown in Fig. 1). In mis embodiment, tilt adjustment can<br>
be performed in order to provide minimum scanning angle (preferably achieved at 65 a<br>
20     T). Therefore, the required tilt adjustment Stat may provide a new tilt angle T such that<br>
minimum function min(0s - T) will follow the relation:<br><br><br>
According to another embodiment, the tilt adjustment is defined as the minimum that is required such that 65 - T is equal to or less than a predetermined value (e.g. in <br>
25 	the range of 60*- 70°), It should be appreciated that hit adjustment may be required only if qs extends a predetermined value (e.g. in the range of 60°- 70°). W should also be appreciated mat other considerations for defining the required tilt adjustment may be applied, e.g. limiting the tilt angle to fell between<br>

18<br>
20°-30°, and more. Furthermore, the invention can be applied with a fixed tilt angle, as shown in Fig. 2, and in such an implementation, no dynamic tilt adjustment is provided at all.<br>
In operation 330: if needed (checked in operation 326), perform electronic<br>
5     scanning. Note that no electronic scanning is required when the broadside of the antenna coincides with the satellite position vector S. in other words, electronic scanning is performed if 0S ^ T.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 7 in combination with Fig. 5: according to an embodiment of the invention illustrated above, operation 310 is performed by the<br>
10     data input module (element 180), and operations 312-330 are carried out by the position and polarization tracking module (element 190).<br>
It should be appreciated that the invention is not bound by the specific considerations exemplified herein with reference to Fig. 7 in order to illustrate one embodiment of the invention, and other considerations can apply, with the<br>
15     necessary modifications, without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
The present invention was described with relation to a transmit/receive antenna and RF radiation of a certain linear polarization. It should be appreciated that the present invention is equally concerned with transmit antenna or receive antenna,  and RF  radiation of non-linear polarization, with the appropriate<br>
20     modifications.<br>
The invention was described mainly with reference to communication between an aircraft and a geostationary satellite. It should be noted that the invention is not limited by the type of moving platform onto which the antenna system is mounted, e.g. ships, land vehicles and more. Furthermore, the present<br>
25	 invention was described in details with respect to communication of RF signal having linear polarization between a moving platform and a target. It should be appreciated that the concepts and principles of the invention can also be implemented for communication of RF signals having linear polarization between a fixed platform and a moving target or vice versa (moving platform and<br>
30     fixed target), or moving platform and moving target, with the appropriate<br><br>

modifications and alterations, without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
It   should   also   be   appreciated   that   the   present   invention   can   be implemented by using only three degrees of freedom as follows (the following <br>
5     reference numbers refer to Fig. 1):<br>
-	an azimuth driving subsystem (element 12 in Fig. 1) that rotates the tilt<br>
driving subsystem (element 14 in Fig. 1) and the active subsystem<br>
(element 16) accommodated thereon around axis ZB.<br>
-	a tilt driving subsystem 14 that rotates the active subsystem 16 around<br>
10	axis D, thereby tilting the active subsystem (axis A) with respect to<br>
axis B by a tilt angle T, wherein 0<t></t>
-	a roll subsystem that rotates the active subsystem 16 around axis ZA.<br>
As  described with reference to operation 320  shown in Fig.  7, by<br>
providing a tilt angle in the range of 0<t the electronic scanning angle></t>
15 	can be minimized, up to 9s=0. In other words, by using dynamic adjustment of the tilt angle T, according to an embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to maintain position and polarization tracking without the need to perform electronic scanning. Preferably, this embodiment is useful for an antenna system for tracking moving targets, mounted onto fixed platforms, land vehicles, <br>
20     ships and more.<br>
  It should be appreciated that the antenna system according to the invention<br>
may be used as a radar, an electronic counter measures (ECM) system or as a<br>
communication antenna, such as two-way broadband data communication via<br>
satellites having linear polarization mode.<br>
25	Those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains, can<br>
