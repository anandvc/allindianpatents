				<td>COMPOSITION FOR CONVERSION  OF PAINT  SLUDGE INTO  BITUMEN BLENDABLE MIXTURE, PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for the conversion of all types of paint sludge into a bitumen blendable mixture useful for road building, to a process for the preparation of said composition and to a process for the conversion of waste paint sludge to bitumen blendable mixture useful for road building. The sludge conversion process of the invention consumes the environmentally hazardous sludge collected from paint application systems by converting this paint sludge into a bitumen blendable mixture useful for road building. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Most original equipment manufacturers (OEM's) use spray technique for painting their components. In this process the paint is mixed/thinned with appropriate thinner to get required application viscosity. Then it is applied by spray method on respective components in a paint booth. During spray method some paint adheres on the component being spray painted. Over-sprayed paint goes to water stream as a waste. This over sprayed waste paint gets mixed with water stream and gets coagulated by flocculent booth additives present in water stream. From this water stream the sludge is collected in the form of a lumpy paste. Generally this sludge is either dumped or incinerated by industries, which is environmentally hazardous. Typically, the sludge obtained is either not biodegradable or degrades at a very slow rate. Therefore, dumping or earth filling of such sludge poses an environmental hazard. Burning of this sludge also produces toxic flames causing environment pollution. Therefore dumping, earth filling or burning of paint sludge is not an environmentally safe method for its disposal. It is therefore important to devise a method by which paint sludge can be converted at least in part into reusable product by separating the water component of such sludge. This will assist in reducing the environmental hazards associated with the painting process.<br>
To the best of the applicant's knowledge, no processes are known in the art for recycling or recovery of paint from paint sludge such that useful product can be derived out of it, and environmental concerns addressed at the same time. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

The generation and disposal of sludge is explained in Flow Chart-1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Paint generally comprises of the following materials:<br>
1.	Resin<br>
2.	Pigment and Extenders<br>
3.	Solvents<br>
4.	Additives<br>
All the ingredients are present in a homogeneous dispersed state. All have their specific roles in paint properties. Over-sprayed paint material consists of all the ingredients but very small percentage of solvents. When it is mixed in water and flocculates, solvent content is reduced further and the paint residuals become small droplets. The coagulation of small droplets results in mass formation i.e. sludge.<br>
The sludge available comprise either amino-alkyd based paint sludge, modified single pack epoxy base paint sludge, thermosetting acrylic (TSA) base sludge, polyester base sludge, 2K epoxy base sludge or 2K polyurethane based sludge. The last two are however difficult to recycle since after addition of catalyst hardener, curing takes place in a definite time frame. When used in the formulations of the invention, the2K epoxy base sludge or 2K polyurethane based sludge are used in an amount of 55-65%. A mixture of these with other paint sludges may also be used in the invention<br>
The process for conversion of the sludge into a bitumen based paint sludge bland Mixture, useful for road repair or construction according to the present invention comprises separation of contaminants and addition of solvents and resins in specific proportions. The collected sludge is a semisolid mass containing paint residuals, water, (optional) oil/greases along with flocculent Booth Additive. Water, Oil/grease and Flocculent Booth Additive has detrimental effect on paint properties and its reusability. These contaminants are either have to be eliminated or prevented from coming into the process. Flocculent having acidic/alkaline properties will deteriorate the paint and will be creating problems. To avoid this problem, the additive to be used should have alkaline nature instead of acidic. Oil/Grease contamination into the sludge should be avoided during the sludge formation and collection process. Water also to be removed from the sludge, which will be discussed in the process itself.<br>
The composition of the invention is a synergistic admixture with unknown and unexpected properties and not mere aggregation of properties of the individual ingredients. CONVERSION PROCESS:<br>
The sludge to be converted contains residual paints, acidic flocculent additive and water. The process of conversion to a bitumen blendable mixture comprises<br>
1.	De-watering and Solvent Removal.<br>
a)	Pressing: Sludge is pressed to remove water and solvent from the mass.<br>
b)	Heating: The Sludge mass is heated naturally or mechanically for maximum removal of water and solvents contents.<br><br>
2.	Soaking of dried sludge either in a mixture of resin and solvents or only solvents for few hours depending on the final properties of the required product and the duration of soaking depends on the condition or aging of the sludge.<br>
3.	Dispersion: The dispersion of the soaked sludge (viscous mass) can be achieved using high speed or low speed dispersers or stirrers etc.<br>
4.   Filtration, testing of final bitumen blended mix properties and packing for usage or<br>
dispatch. Example 1:<br>
Sludge from amino alkyd type paint mixed with epoxy based paint was first dried and homogenized as described in Flow Sheet n. Different samples were made with different amounts of sludge in the range of 1% to 85% by weight. To this sludge bitumen in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight was added in a melted form. The bitumen comprised of Grade 60 to Grade 100. The resin mixture employed comprised of petroleum resin in an amount of 1 to 30% by weight mixed optionally with maleic resin in an amount of up to 25% by weight, ketonic resin in an amount of 20% by weight, all dissolved in appropriate solvents. The final composition comprised of sludge in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, bitumen in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, and 10 to 60% by weight of a resin mixture comprising petroleum resin an amount of 1 to 30% by weight, maleic resin in an amount of up to 25% by weight of the resin mixture, ketonic resin in an amount of up to 20% by weight of the resin mixture. If desired any other suitable resin can also be used depending on the properties of the resin mixture. Example 2:<br>
Sludge from a thermosetting acrylic based paint mixed with polyester based paint was taken and the same procedure as discussed above was followed. The final bitumen blended mixture comprised of 5 to 80% by weight of sludge, 2 to 95% by weight of bitumen, and 10 to 70% by weight of a resin mixture comprising maleic resin, ketonic resin, petroleum resin and any other suitable resin. Example 3<br>
Different mixtures were formed of paint sludge and bitumen and a resin where the sludge was present in an amount of 10-85% of the formulation. The resins when used were selected from petrase resin (0-20%), maleic resin (0-15%), ketonic resin (0-10%), cashew nut shell resin (0-10%), BNSL resin (0-10%) or short or medium alkyd resin (0-10%). In some samples, 0-3% of stand oil or CNS oil was also mixed depending on the strength/flexibility required for the bitumen in final application. The formulations used had the following composition: 1.   TSA sludge and amino alkyd - 55-65%<br>
Bitumen - 25-35%<br>
Petrase resin - 2.0-3.5%<br>

All proportions being by weight<br>
The bitumen used was 60/70 grade bitumen. The sludge was blended with the<br>
bitumen following the methods described above. It was observed that a blend comprising<br>
2-8% sludge provided excellent strength and penetration resistance to the bitumen.<br>
