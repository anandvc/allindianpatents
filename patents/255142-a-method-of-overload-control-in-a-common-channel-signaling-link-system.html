TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION	<br>
The present invention relates to a method of overload control for signaling traffic in a common<br>
channel signaling link system during service processing in a communication system, and<br>
particularly to a method of overload control for service access processing and signaling traffic in the<br>
common channel signaling link system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
la a common channel signaling link system, such as signaling interface No. 7, V5 interface, all<br>
the signaling are transmitted via signaling links. If the signaling traffic is too large and exceeds the<br>
processing capability of the signaling links, a large number of signaling links in the system are<br>
interrupted or the links are failed to be established, which would cause the frequent link<br>
establishment, thereby influencing whole performance of the system greatly. Therefore, a reasonable<br>
solution of overload control for signaling links is needed to reasonably control the amount of<br>
service access of the system when the signaling links are overloaded, to ensure the loads of the<br>
signaling links to maintain in relative steady and controllable state so mat the system can be<br>
operated normally with large call traffic and has a self-retrieval function for the signaling links.<br>
In the common channel signaling link system, local signaling messages are generated by a service<br>
layer and transmitted by a link layer. At an opposite end, the signaling messages are first received by<br>
the link layer and then transmitted to the service layer for processing. A process of<br>
acknowledgement from the opposite end is included in this process, that is, after a number of local<br>
signaling messages are sent to the opposite end, other signaling messages cannot continue to be sent<br>
until an acknowledgement message is received from the opposite end. When the local traffic is very<br>
large, since speed of generating the signaling messages locally is always faster than that of<br>
acknowledging the signaling messages at the opposite end, the signaling messages will be<br>
accumulated locally. A system will fail when the accumulation of signaling messages reaches a<br>
certain degree.<br>
A method of overload detection and control for Service Control Point (SCP) is disclosed in US<br>
patent No. 6510214. In this method, an overload control system estimates an overload rating in<br>
response to a latency and a queue depth of a service logic interpreter in the service control point and<br>
a Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) controls the service access according to the<br>
overload rating. An absolute value is used in the detection method of US patent No. 6510214 and<br>
the load of the system has been large when the overload is generated, so the processing manner is to<br><br>
discard the newly arrived services when the system is in overload state.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of overload control in a common<br>
channel signaling link system, in which method a service processing process is informed of<br>
instantaneous overload information of signaling links by monitoring in real time a queue of<br>
signaling messages to be processed in a link layer, and traffic of signaling links is controlled by<br>
controlling an amount of new services accessed by a service layer, so that the problem that the<br>
signal links are frequently interrupted and the problem that the traffic of service processing<br>
fluctuates great and is unsteady can be solved to ensure reliability of the system's operation.<br>
For above purpose of the present invention, the technical solution is as follows.<br>
A method of overload control in a common channel signaling link system comprises the steps of:<br>
a link control process detecting an amount of unprocessed signaling messages in a queue of<br>
messages regularly;<br>
determining whether the amount of unprocessed signaling messages is more than an overload<br>
start threshold; and<br>
if the amount of unprocessed signaling messages is more than the overload start threshold, the<br>
link control process dynamically controlling an amount of new services accessed by a service<br>
processing process by sending a message to the service processing process.<br>
Preferably, the step of the link control process dynamically controlling an amount of new services<br>
accessed by a service processing process includes: performing the following steps of (i) ~ (ii)<br>
repeatedly at a predetermined time interval until an amount of signaling messages in the queue of<br>
messages is less than an overload retrieval threshold:<br>
(i) determining whether the amount of signaling messages in the queue of messages is less than<br>
the overload retrieval threshold, and if the amount of signaling messages in the queue of messages<br>
is less than the overload retrieval threshold, informing the service processing process that the system<br>
has retrieved normal state;<br>
(ii) if the amount of signaling messages in the queue of messages is more than the overload<br>
retrieval threshold, performing the following steps:<br>
determining whether a length of the current queue of messages is longer than that of a queue of<br>
messages previous to the predetermined time interval;<br>
if the length of the current queue of messages is longer than that of the queue of messages<br>
previous to the predetermined time interval, detennining whether an increment of the signaling<br>
messages in the queue of messages exceeds an overload increment threshold;<br>
if the increment of the signaling messages in the queue of messages exceeds the overload<br><br><br>
increment threshold, the link control process sending an overload controlling message to the service<br>
processing process;<br>
if the length of the current queue of messages is less than or equal to that of the queue of<br>
messages previous to the predetermined time interval, determining whether a decrement of the<br>
signaling messages in the queue of messages exceeds an overload decrement threshold; and<br>
if the decrement of the signaling messages in the queue of messages exceeds the overload<br>
decrement threshold, the link control process sending an overload relieving message to the service<br>
processing process.<br>
Preferably, the step of the link control process dynamically controlling an amount of new services<br>
accessed by a service processing process further includes: the service processing process receiving<br>
the message from the link control process, decreasing or increasing a predetermined amount in the<br>
amount of new accessed services and equally distributing calls allowed to be accessed to statistical<br>
windows for call access.<br>
Preferably, the step of informing the service processing process that the system has retrieved<br>
normal state further includes: the service processing process gradually increasing the amount of new<br>
accessed services at a predetermined time interval.<br>
Preferably, the step of the link control process dynamically controlling an amount of new services<br>
accessed by a service processing process further includes: the service processing process receiving<br>
the message from the link control process, and if the message is the overload controlling message,<br>
the service processing process decreasing the amount of new accessed services by m; if the message<br>
is the overload relieving message, the service processing process increasing the amount of new<br>
accessed services by n, wherein both m and n are natural numbers and m&gt;n.<br>
Preferably, the overload start threshold is set to 50% ~ 70%, representing ratio of an amount of<br>
the current signaling messages in the queue of messages and the size of storage area for the queue of<br>
messages. Preferably, the overload start threshold is set to 60%.<br>
Preferably, the overload retrieval threshold approximates to and is less than the overload start<br>
threshold.<br>
The method of overload control in a common channel signaling link system according to the<br>
present invention implements overload control as early as possible according to capabilities of<br>
signaling processing and link transmission of the system, and detects in real time the variation of the<br>
amount of signaling messages in the queue of signaling messages to dynamically control the amount<br>
of new accessed services, so that the problem that the V5 signaling links between the BSS base<br>
station sub-system and the switch are interrupted is substantively solved by rapid decreasing and<br>
slow increasing as well as equally and randomly rejecting access of new call services, which causes<br><br><br>
the call traffic in the system steady and the fluctuation of signaling traffic small, thereby effectively<br>
reducing the impact on the switch and V5 interface and ensuring the steadiness and reliability of the<br>
system. Also, the method provided by the present invention may be applied to a SS7 (signaling No.<br>
7) link system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown.<br>
Fig. 1 is a structural schematic diagram of a system in which a method of overload control in a<br>
common channel signaling link system according to an embodiment of the present invention can be<br>
implemented. As shown in Fig. 1, the common channel signaling link system in the embodiment<br>
includes a link control process 101 and a service processing process 103. Both processes transmit<br>
communication messages between each other through a communication platform 105. In the<br>
common signaling link system, service processing process 103 is in a service layer for controlling<br>
access of new services and generating corresponding signaling messages. The link control process<br>
101 is in a transmission layer for controlling the transmission of local signaling messages to a link<br>
layer of an opposite end system 109 over a singling link 107. The link layer of the opposite end<br>
system 109 performs an acknowledgement process for the received signaling messages and then<br><br><br>
transmits these messages to the service layer for processing. After a number of signaling messages<br>
are sent to the opposite end system by the transmission layer of the local system, other signaling<br>
messages cannot continue to be sent until an acknowledgement message is received from the<br>
opposite end system 109. When the service traffic of the local system is very large, the signaling<br>
messages tend to be accumulated at the transmission layer of the local system because the speed of<br>
generating the signaling messages by the local system is always faster than that of acknowledging<br>
the signaling messages at the opposite end. Therefore, the overload in the signaling link system is<br>
needed to be controlled to rationally control an amount of accessed services of the system in the<br>
case that the system is overloaded, so that the load of the signaling link is ensured to be in relative<br>
steady and controllable state and the system can operate normally with large call traffic.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a flow diagram of a method of overload control in a common channel signaling link<br>
system according to the present invention. As shown in Fig. 2, first at Step 201, the link control<br>
process monitors an amount of unprocessed signaling messages.<br>
Then, at Step 203, the link control process determines whether the amount of unprocessed<br>
signaling messages exceeds an overload start threshold. If so, an overload controlling message will<br>
be sent to the service processing process. Specifically, since a message buffer for storing the<br>
unprocessed signaling messages in the system usually has large size and extremely goes beyond the<br>
capabilities of signaling processing and link transmission of the system, the overload control should<br>
be performed as early as possible on the basis of the capabilities of signaling processing and link<br>
transmission of the system, such that the system is able to control the link state and service access<br>
sufficiently. If the overload control is enabled late and a great number of services have accessed to<br>
the system, the services would generate a great number of signaling messages, which leads the link<br>
control process to lose the control capability of signaling link and thus the signaling link would be<br>
blocked. In this embodiment, the overload start threshold is set to 60%, representing ratio of an<br>
amount of current signaling messages in the queue of messages and the size of storage area for the<br>
queue of messages. When the link control process detects that the amount of unprocessed signaling<br>
messages in the current queue of messages exceeds 60% of the size of storage area for the queue of<br>
messages, the overload controlling message is sent to the service processing process to start the<br>
overload control. After receiving the overload controlling message from the link control process, the<br>
service processing process decreases the amount of new accessed services. In this embodiment, the<br>
service processing process decreases 2 new accessed services each time receiving the overload<br>
controlling message. In this embodiment, the overload control is implemented in a manner of<br>
refusing certain new services to access randomly, rather than discarding the generated signaling<br>
messages or releasing the established services.<br><br><br>
At Step 205, the link control process dynamically controls the amount of new services accessed<br>
by the service processing process. Specifically, the process of the link control process dynamically<br>
controlling the amount of new services accessed by the service processing process is shown as Fig.<br>
3.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flow diagram of the process of dynamically controlling the amount of new<br>
accessed services in the method of overload control in a common channel signaling link system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention As shown in Fig. 3, the link control process<br>
dynamically controls the amount of new services accessed by the service processing process by<br>
performing all the steps in Fig. 3 repeatedly at a particular time interval, until the amount of<br>
signaling message in the queue of messages is lower than or equal to an overload retrieval threshold.<br>
At first, At Step 301, the link control process initiates an overload monitor timer to set the time<br>
interval for detecting the queue of messages regularly. When the singling link is overloaded, the<br>
signaling traffic is very large and more signaling messages would be generated in a short time, thus<br>
the time interval should be set as short as possible to prevent from generating more new signaling<br>
messages due to such a long time interval. Moreover, the time interval is depended on the time<br>
interval of a scheduling process of an operation system. Generally, the time interval is set to 20 ms.<br>
At Step 302, when the overload monitor timer is up, the link control process detects the amount<br>
of signaling messages in the queue of messages and determines whether the amount of signaling<br>
messages in the queue of messages is lower than or equal to the overload retrieval threshold. If the<br>
amount of signaling messages in the queue of messages is lower than or equal to the overload<br>
retrieval threshold, the process is advanced to Step 303; otherwise Step 305 will be performed. In<br>
this embodiment, in order to early and dynamically control the overload of the signaling link of the<br>
system to make the system still has great control capability under overload state, the overload<br>
retrieval threshold is set to approximate to and be lower than the overload start threshold so that the<br>
system can detect new overload state as soon as possible and control it if the traffic of signaling<br>
messages is large after the system is relieved of overload state.<br>
At Step 303, the link control process informs the service processing process of entering into the<br>
overload retrieval phase. The service processing process begins to retrieve the services and sets a<br>
service retrieval timer, by which the amount of the accessed services is gradually increased until the<br>
system retrieves normal state (Step 304). In this embodiment, the service retrieval timer can be used<br>
to control a time interval, such as 2 seconds, for the service processing process to retrieve the<br>
amount of new accessed services. Slight adjustment may be adopted to make the increment of the<br>
new accessed services each time not too big to prevent the system from fluctuating greatly, for<br>
example, the increment of the new accessed services each time is one. The service retrieval phase is<br><br><br>
not stopped until the system retrieves normal state or the service processing process receives the<br>
overload controlling message again.<br>
At Step 305, the link control process initiates the overload monitor timer again and then, at Step <br>
306, the link control process determines whether the amount of signaling messages in the queue of<br>
messages is more than the overload start threshold and determines whether the length of the current<br>
queue of messages is shorter than that of the queue of messages detected when the overload monitor<br>
timer is up last time. If yes, the process is advanced to Step 307; otherwise Step 309 will be<br>
performed.<br>
At Step 307, the link control process further determines whether the decrement of the signaling<br>
messages in the queue of messages is more than a predetermined overload decrement threshold<br>
during the period defined by the overload monitor timer. If yes, the process is advanced to Step 308<br>
in which the amount of the new accessed services is increased; otherwise Step 311 will be<br>
performed. The overload decrement threshold is determined based on the size of storage area for the<br>
queue of messages as well as capabilities of service access and link control of the system. The<br>
overload decrement threshold is set to 45 in this embodiment.<br>
At Step 308, the link control process sends an overload relieving message. After the service<br>
processing process receives the message, the amount of the new accessed service is increased and<br>
the overload retrieval timer is reset. In this embodiment, after the service processing process<br>
receives the overload relieving message, the amount of the new accessed service is increased by<br>
one. Then, the process is advanced to Step 311.<br>
At Step 309, the link control process further determines whether the increment of the signaling<br>
messages in the queue of messages is more than a predetermined overload increment threshold<br>
during the period defined by the overload monitor timer. If yes, the process is advanced to Step 310<br>
in which the amount of the new accessed services is further decreased and the overload retrieval<br>
timer is reset; otherwise Step 311 would be performed. The overload increment threshold is<br>
determined based on the size of storage area for the queue of messages as well as capabilities of<br>
service access and link control of the system. The overload increment threshold is set to 40 in this<br>
embodiment.<br>
At Step 310, the link control process sends the overload controlling message to the service<br>
processing process. After the service processing process receives the message, the amount of the<br>
new accessed services is further decreased. In this embodiment, after receiving the overload<br>
controlling message, the service processing process decreases 2 new accessed services. Then the<br>
process is advanced to Step 311. In this embodiment, in order to prevent the system from fluctuating<br>
greatly, slight adjustment for overload is used to ensure that the changed service traffic each time is<br><br><br>
not very large, thus the speed of decreasing the new accessed services of the system is faster than<br>
that of increasing the new accessed services.<br>
At Step 311, the process returns to Step 302 and repeats above steps to continue the regular<br>
detection of the amount of signaling messages in the queue of messages and dynamical control of<br>
the amount of the new services accessed by the service processing process, until the system retrieves<br>
normal state.<br>
In this embodiment, the service processing process limits the access of new calls equally<br>
according to the overload controlling message and overload relieving message sent from the link<br>
control process. The control of the access of new calls by the service processing process is as<br>
follows: the service processing process sets the number of statistical windows in accordance with<br>
the ratio of overload control service access. Generally, the number of statistical windows is set to<br>
32, i.e. the amount of accessed calls is counted with a cycle of every 32 calls. The amount of calls<br>
allowed by the current statistical window to be accessed is set and it is determined that whether the<br>
newly accessed call numbers are allowed to be accessed. The call numbers allowed to be accessed<br>
are equally distributed into the statistical windows. When a new service is accessed, if its call<br>
number is the one allowed to be accessed, the new service is allowed to be accessed; otherwise, if<br>
its call number is the one rejected to be accessed, the new service is rejected.<br>
Moreover, Fig. 4 shows a test result of overload in a common channel signaling link system to<br>
which the present invention is not applied. In the common channel signaling link system, a program<br>
for simulating large call traffic is used for call test. A front end controls continual calls and<br>
simulates initiation of calls in 240 lines (total 480 lines including lines for initiating calls and lines<br>
for receiving calls). The duration of a call is 6 seconds and the interval between calls is 4 seconds. It<br>
can be seen that the call traffic is fluctuated greatly in the common channel signaling link system<br>
when the embodiment of the present invention is not applied. The interface tends to be interrupted<br>
due to the overload of the system<br>
Fig. 5 is a diagram showing a test result of overload in a common channel signaling link system<br>
to which the present invention is applied. In this embodiment, the program for simulating large call<br>
traffic is used for call test. A front end controls continual calls and simulates initiation of calls in<br>
240 lines (total 480 lines including lines for initiating calls and lines for receiving calls). The<br>
duration of a call is 6 seconds and the interval between calls is 4 seconds. It can be seen that the call<br>
traffic is fluctuated slightly in the common channel signaling link system to which the embodiment<br>
of the present invention is applied. The traffic of the system is steady.<br>
While the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the preferred<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications and substitutions<br><br><br>
can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A METHOD OF OVERLOAD CONTROL IN A COMMON CHANNEL<br>
SIGNALING LINK SYSTEM<br>
The invention relates to a method of overload control in a common channel signaling link system,<br>
comprising the steps of: a link control process detecting an amount of unprocessed signaling<br>
messages in a queue of messages regularly (201) and determining whether the amount of<br>
unprocessed signaling messages is more than an overload start threshold (203), if the amount of<br>
unprocessed signaling messages is more than the overload start threshold, the link control process<br>
dynamically controlling an amount of new services accessed by a service processing process by<br>
sending a message to the service processing process (205).</td>
