				<td>A DEVICE FOR PRODUCING THE FLOW OF ELECTRONS DUE TO SOLAR<br>
ENERGY BEING INCIDENT THEREON AND A METHOD OF INCREASING THE<br>
EFFICIENCY OF A SOLAR CELL PHOTOVOLTAIC SUBSTRATE MATERIAL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for producing the flow of electrons due to solar energy<br>
being incident thereon and a method of increasing the efficiency of a solar cell photovoltaic substrate<br>
material. In particular, the present invention focuses primarily on matching or modifying particular<br>
incident light energies (e.g. a semiconductor material) required to excite, for example, electrons in at<br>
least a portion of the substrate material in a desirable manner (e.g. to cause desirable movement of<br>
electrons to result in output amperages previously unobtainable). In this regard, for example, energy<br>
levels of incident light, and thus, corresponding particular wavelengths or frequencies of incident light,<br>
can be at least partiallymatched with various desirable energy levels (e.g. electron band gap energy<br>
levels) in a substrate material by filtering out at least a portion of certain undesirable incident light that<br>
comes into contact with at least a portion of a surface of a solar cell photovoltaic substrate material;<br>
and/or modifying at least a portion of a solar cell photovoltaic substrate material such that such solar<br>
cell substrate material interacts favorably with particular desirable frequencies of incident light; and/or<br>
modifying particular undesirable light energies prior to them becoming incident on the photovoltaic<br>
substrate material to render such light energies more desirable for interactions with the photovoltaic<br>
substrate material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For many years, effort has been made to utilize the energy from the sun to produce electricity.<br>
It is well known that on a clear day the sun provides approximately one thousand watts of energy per<br>
square meter almost everywhere on the planet's surface. The historical intention has been to collect<br>
this energy by using, for example, an appropriate solar semiconductor device and utilizing the<br>
collected energy to produce power by the creation of a suitable voltage and to maximize amperage<br>
which is represented by the flow of electrons. However, to date, many photovoltaic cells typically have<br>
an overall efficiency as low as about 10-25%. In this regard, that means that when one thousand watts<br>
of energy are incident on a square meter of a typical photovoltaic cell, somewhere between about 100<br>
and 250 watts of output energy power typically results. This typical low efficiency in solar cells has<br>
been a significant reason for the solar cell industry not growing faster. For example, it is relatively<br><br>
expensive to manufacture those semiconductor materials currently utilized for solar cells<br>
(e.g., crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, cadmium sulfide, etc.) into solar panels (e.g.,<br>
typically, a plurality of combined solar cells electrically connected together) which includes<br>
the high costs of forming the solar cell substrate materials themselves, the cost of modifying<br>
the substrate materials so that they can become photovoltaic (e.g., doping the semiconductor<br>
substrate material to create substrate p/n junctions, etc.), the placement of electron collecting<br>
grids on surfaces of the solar cells, manufacturing the solar cells into solar panels, etc.<br>
For example, in regard to a first example of utilizing crystalline silicon, one<br>
traditional approach for manufacturing solar cells has included converting scrap silicon<br>
wafers from the semiconductor industry into solar cells by known techniques which include<br>
etching of the solar cells and subsequent processing of the silicon wafers so that 1hey can<br>
function as solar cells. A second technique includes creating relatively thin layers of<br>
crystalline and/or amorphous silicon upon an appropriate substrate and then utilizing<br>
somewhat similar subsequent processing steps to those discussed above to result in a solar<br>
cell/solar panel. In each of these two general approaches to obtaining a suitable photovoltaic<br>
substrate, the semiconducting nature of the silicon is utilized so that when incident light<br>
strikes a doped (e.g., a p-type and/or an n-type doped material) silicon solar cell substrate<br>
material, the incident light can be at least partially absorbed (e.g., a photon of light<br>
corresponding to a certain amount of energy can be absorbed) into the silicon semiconductor.<br>
The absorbed photon results in a transfer of energy to the semiconductor and the transferred<br>
energy can result in electron flow in a circuit (e.g., along with, for example, paired electron<br>
holes flowing in an opposite direction). A flow of electrons is typically referred to as a<br>
current. Solar cells of this type also usually will have a particular voltage associated with the<br>
produced current. By placing or positioning appropriate metal collecting electrodes on, for<br>
example, the top and bottom of the silicon semiconductor material, the electrons produced<br>
can be extracted from the cell as current which can be used, for example, to power an<br>
appropriate external device and/or charge a battery. However, this entire process has<br>
historically been relatively inefficient, making the solar cell industry less than ideal.<br>
Accordingly, there has been a long felt need to enhance the efficiency of solar cells so<br>
that the cost of electricity produced by the solar cell approach can be reduced and thus assist<br>
in making a meaningful impact on the world power supply by, for example, decreasing the<br>
world's dependency on fossil fuels and/or nuclear energy. The present invention satisfies this<br>
long felt need by a novel, simple and reliable approach.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been developed to overcome certain shortcomings of the<br>
prior art photovoltaic materials as well as those techniques used for the manufacture of<br>
numerous compositions of solar cells/solar panels.<br>
It is an object of the invention to produce solar cells out of various known<br>
photovoltaic substrate materials which, in some cases, can be caused to have higher<br>
efficiencies without significantly modifying, if at all modifying, such substrate materials,<br>
relative to known substrate materials used in solar cells.<br>
It is an object of the invention to apply the techniques and methodology of the<br>
invention to at least the photovoltaic substrate materials which include, but are not limited to,<br>
crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, single crystal silicon, cadmium sulfide, gallium<br>
arsenide, GaAs/Ge, GalnP2/GaAs/Ge, copper-indium diselinide, GalnNAs, GaSb, In GaAs,<br>
SiGe, TiO2, AlGaAs, CUInS2, Fullerene C60 and carbonaceous thin films.<br>
Another object of the invention is to limit or restrict certain undesirable incident<br>
wavelengths of light (and thus certain frequencies and energy levels) from becoming incident<br>
upon a solar cell photovoltaic substrate.<br>
It is another object of the invention to limit or restrict (i.e.. minimize) certain<br>
destructively interfering (or at least partially destrctively interfering) incident wavelengths<br>
of hight from becoming incident upon a solar cell photovoltaic substrate so as to maximize the<br>
incidence of constructively interfering (or at least partially constructively interfering) incident<br>
wavelengths which, for example, substantially match those wavelengths (e.g., amounts of<br>
energy) which cause desirable interactions to occur between the incident light and the solar<br>
cell substrate (e.g., excite electrons from a substrate into an appropriate energy collection<br>
system on the substrate (e.g., a conductive grid), to produce desirable electrical current).<br>
Moreover, the incident light energy can be converted to desirable atomic or molecular<br>
energies (e.g., electronic) and thus, for example, further energize the electrons to assist in the<br>
production of electrical power.<br>
It is an object of the invention to determine which particular energies (and thus which<br>
particular wavelengths or frequencies) of incident light are required for any desired solar cell<br>
photovoltaic substrate to permit desirable interactions to occur (e.g., for electrons to be<br>
excited from one energy level to another to result in current; to provide energy to the<br>
electrons which can assist in promoting the electrons to a conduction band to result in<br>
current; and after determining which energies (and thus which wavelengths or frequencies)<br>
are desirable, substantially restricting the wavelengths or frequencies of undesirable incident<br><br>
light upon said substrate by utilizing an appropriate filtering technique or light modifying<br>
(e.g., shifting, refracting, etc.) technique, thus maximizing those desirable energies of light<br>
which contact or are inciden! upon a solar cell substrate.<br>
It is another object of the invention to restrict and or modify the wavelengths of light<br>
which are incident upon an appropriate solar cell substrate by utilizing at least one external<br>
means for modifying incident sunlight (e.g., a filter or a combination of external filters, a<br>
light refracting means, and/or a light reflecting means, etc ), which mavimize(s) those desired<br>
wavelengths to be incident upon a solar cell photo\ oltaic substrate. Such external means<br>
which include filters, or combinations of external filters, can be incorporated into an original<br>
manufacturing process or can be later added (e.g.. as a coating) as, for example, a retrofitting<br>
step 10 existing solar cells or solar panels.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide at least one filter for filtering out<br>
certain wavelengths of undesirable incident light by providing a particular covering material<br>
in a solar cell which functions as a filter. In this regard, an appropriate covering material can"<br>
be, for example, suitable poloymer material(s) (including certain monomer(s) and/or<br>
oligomer(s);, or suitable glass(es), suitable coatings, and/or combinations of the same.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a glass cover material which is capable of<br>
filtering, refracting and/or reflecting out as many undesirable wavelengths of incident light as<br>
possible and thus maximizing the incidences of those wavelengths of light which desirably<br>
interact with a solar cell photovoltaic substrate material after passing through such a cover<br>
material.<br>
To achieve all of the foregoing objects and advantages, and to overcome the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art solar cell and solar panel designs, the present invention utilizes<br>
a number of novel approaches.<br>
Typical photovoltaic materials convert sunlight directly into electricity. Photovoltaic<br>
cells typically utilize materials known as semiconductors such as crystalline silicon,<br>
amorphous silicon, single crystal silicon, cadmium sulfide, gallium arsenide, etc., as a<br>
substrate or active material in the solar cell. Of these materials, crystalline silicon is currentl)<br>
one of the most commonly used. When sunlight strikes (i.e., is incident upon) a<br>
semiconductor material, it is known that certain energy units within sunlight, known as, and<br>
referred to as, photons, can be absorbed into the semiconductor material. This typically<br>
results in some portion of the energy of incident sunlight being transferred to the<br>
semiconductor material. This transfer of energy can cause. for example, electrons to be<br>
excited from their ground state into one or more excited states which permits such electrons,<br><br>
in certain cases, to flow somewhat freely within at least a portion of the semiconductor<br>
material (e.g., within a conductor or conduction band in the semiconductor material). These<br>
photovoltaic materials or cells also have at least one electric field which tends to force<br>
electrons to flow in a particular direction, such electrons having been created by the<br>
absorption of light energy (i.e.,. photons) into the semiconductor material. The flow of<br>
electrons is typically regarded and referred to as a current. By placing appropriate electrodes<br>
(e.g., one or more metal grids) on the front and back side of a photovoltaic cell, the flow of<br>
electrons can generate a current which can be used to drive electric motors, charge batteries.<br>
etc. It is the flow of electrons or current, combined with the voltage produced by the cell<br>
(e.g., which is a direct result of any built-in electric field or fields), which defines the total<br>
output or power that a solar cell, or group of solar cells in a panel or array, can produce.<br>
The following discussion places particular emphasis on crystalline silicon, however,<br>
such discussion applies in a parallel manner to other photovoltaic materials as well. An atom<br>
of silicon is known to have 14 electrons in three different shells. The first two of these shells<br>
closest to the nucleus are regarded as being completely filled with electrons. However, the<br>
outer shell is regarded as being only half full and contains only four electrons. This is what<br>
makes crystalline silicon, when appropriately doped, a good semiconductor material and thus<br>
useful as a solar cell substrate material. In this regard, an individual silicon atom is<br>
considered to be driven to attempt to fill its outermost shell with eight electrons. In order to<br>
fill its outermost shell, the silicon atom is thought to need to share electrons with, for<br>
example, four of its neighboring silicon atoms. This attempt to share electrons with<br>
neighboring silicon atoms is essentially what forms the crystalline structure of silicon and this<br>
structure is important to the formation of this type of photovoltaic cell.<br>
In most cases, silicon desirably includes dopants which are added to the crystalline<br>
structure to cause the silicon to work as a better semiconductor. Traditional dopants that have<br>
been historically used in the manufacture of crystalline silicon semiconductor materials<br>
include boron, phosphorous, indium, etc., the particular dopant(s) being chosen to result in<br>
desired p-type and/or n-type characteristics of at least a portion of a semiconductor. A more<br>
complete list of dopants than those listed above that have been used with a variety of different<br>
photovoltaic materials include, but are not limited to, germanium, beryllium, magnesium,<br>
selenium, cadmium, zinc, mercury, oxygen, chlorine, iodine and organometallic dyes (e.g.,<br>
Rv(SCN)2 C2). The purpose of these dopants is to cause, for example, the silicon to function<br>
as a better semiconductor material. By utilizing suitable dopants, me amount of energy<br>
required to be input into, for example, a silicon semiconductor to produce or promote<br><br>
electrons to flow is reduced significantly relative to an undoped silicon semiconductor<br>
material because in doped silicon, the electrons are not bound in a chemical bond in the same<br>
way that undoped silicon electrons are. It is desirable to have present in different portions of<br>
a silicon-based solar cell each of an n-type behavior and a p-type behavior. For example,<br>
phosphorous can be added as a dopant to result in an n-type semiconductor portion of a<br>
silicon material and boron can be added to another portion of a semiconductor material to<br>
result in a p-type portion in a silicon semiconductor material. N-type doped materials are<br>
typically associated with the letter "n" because such materials have the presence of free<br>
electrons (i.e., n = negative); whereas p-type materials are typically associated with the letter<br>
"p" because such materials have free holes (i.e., the opposite of electrons and p = positive).<br>
The concept of holes is viewed as being important in a solar cell semiconductor material<br>
because holes are thought to be the equivalent to the absence of electrons which carry a<br>
positive charge in an opposite direction from the electron flow and are thought to move<br>
around like electrons.<br>
According!}', when both p-type and n-type portions or materials are combined into a<br>
single material, at least one electric field will form due to the n-type and p-type portions of<br>
silicon being in contact with each other. In particular, free electrons on the n-side of the<br>
semiconductor recognize the presence of holes on the p-side of the semiconductor and<br>
attempt to fill in these holes by moving there. For example, in the junction between n-type<br>
and p-type portions or sections within a semiconductor material, there is a mixture of holes<br>
and electrons which reach equilibrium and thus create at least one electric field separating the<br>
two sides. This field actually functions as a diode which permits (e.g., in some cases even<br>
pushes) electrons to flow from the p-side to the n-side (e.g., but, typically, not the other way<br>
around).<br>
Accordingly, when photons of light become incident upon me semiconductor<br>
material, the photons of light contain a certain amount of energy "E". This amount of energy<br>
"E".is equal to Planck's constant "h" multiplied by the frequency of the light. In this regard,<br>
the well-known relationship is as follows:<br>
E = hv	Equation 1<br>
These photons of a particular energy, and thus of a particular wavelength and frequency, are<br>
capable of transferring energy to electrons in the semiconductor material (e.g., promoting<br>
electrons from lower energy states into, for example, the conduction band) as well as being<br>
capable of creating holes. If the electrons and/or holes are created close enough to the<br>
electric field, or if they can wander within a range of influence of such field, the field will<br><br>
typically send an electron to the n-side of the semiconductor and a hole to the p-side of the<br>
semiconductor. This movement of electrons and holes will result in further disruption of the<br>
electrical neutrality and if an external collection system (e.g., electrical grid) is provided,<br>
electrons will flow into and through this grid to their original side (i.e., the p-side) to unite<br>
with corresponding holes that the electric field has also sent mere. This flow of electrons<br>
provides the current as well as the electric field(s), resulting in a voltage. 'When, both current<br>
and voltage are present, power can be created in, for example, an external device.<br>
Traditional photovoltaic theory recognizes that incident sunlight is comprised of a<br>
number of different wavelengths of light (e.g., infrared, visible, ultraviolet, etc) and thus<br>
includes a virtual continuum of different energies, as well as a virtual continuum of different<br>
frequencies, most all of which energies/wavelengths/frequencies (e.g., especially in the range<br>
of about 200nm to about 1200nm wavelength) have been traditionally viewed as positively<br>
interacting with a semiconductor material, as well as some of which<br>
energies/wavelengths/frequencies being traditionally viewed as not really causing any<br>
positive (or negative) results. In this regard, it has been previously viewed by the prior art,<br>
for example, that some incident light does not have sufficient energies to form an electron-<br>
hole pair and in such cases these photons may simply pass through the solar cell without any<br>
positive or negative interactions with the solar cell. Additionally, it has also been<br>
traditionally believed that some photons have too much energy and simply can not interact<br>
completely with the solar cell material (e.g., there may be some interactions, but the<br>
interaction may be incomplete or that not all of the energy of the photon is, or can be, used by<br>
the solar cell).<br>
It is known, for example, that one band gap energy that can be made to exist in doped<br>
crystalline silicon is about 1.1 eV (1.1 electron Volts). This amount of energy is known as an<br>
amount of energy which is required to, for example, free a bound electron to become a freely<br>
flowing electron which can be involved in the flow of a current. It has been believed<br>
historically that photons having more energy than what is required to free an electron may<br>
simply not utilize all of the energy to free an electron and such excess energy is simply lost;<br>
whereas it has also been believed that photons that do not have enough energy to free an<br>
electron to become involved in the flow of a current simply do not interact at all with the<br>
semiconductor material. Thus, it has been believed historically that photons having less than<br>
required amounts of energy or more than required amounts of energy (as discussed above) do<br>
not interact in a positive or a negative way and such non-interaction has been traditionally<br>
blamed as being responsible for the loss of the effectiveness (e.g., in some cases about 70 -<br><br>
90%) of the radiation or sunlight energy which is incident on a solar cell. Some approaches to<br>
increase the efficiency of solar cells have suggested reducing the required band gap energy to<br>
a smaller number by utilizing an appropriate combination of dopants, but there is<br>
unfortunatery a negative impact associated with such approaches. Particularly, the amount of<br>
band gap energy that can be designed into a solar cell substrate material (e.g., crystalline<br>
silicon) is limited, because, even though a small band gap may result in the production of<br>
more electrons, the traditional view would be that because more photons could be utilized,<br>
the width of the band gap also determines the strength of the electric field. Accordingly, if<br>
the band gap is too small, even though extra current is provided by the ability of a material, in<br>
theory, to absorb more photons and thus promote more electrons to a conduction band, the<br>
power output of the cell is lowered because a much smaller voltage is produced. In mis<br>
regard, power is the multiplied effect of voltage times current (i.e., P=VI). In attempting to<br>
balance the two effects of current and voltage, one ideal band gap width for silicon has been<br>
determined to be about 1.4 eV (1.4 electron volts) for a cell made from a single material<br>
suitably doped.<br>
However, the prior art has not recognized some very important negative effects which<br>
impact adversely on the power output of a solar photovoltaic cell. As discussed above, the<br>
historical view has been that when incident photons are of too low an energy, the photons do<br>
not positively interact with the solar cell semiconductor material, and when photons are of<br>
too high an energy, some of the energy may be caused to interact with the solar cell<br>
semiconductor material and some of the energy of the photon is simply lost and does not take<br>
part in the interaction. However, what all prior art approaches fail to recognize is that there<br>
are negative power effects or negative consequences that can result when energies,<br>
specifically, incident frequencies or wavelengths, which do not specifically match, for<br>
example, the band gap energies present in the semiconductor material. In this regard, the<br>
most efficient or highest output from a solar cell would occur when those energies which<br>
impart desirable effects (e.g., the controlled excitation of an electron and/or electron hole<br>
pair) are applied to (e.g., light incident upon) a photovoltaic material. For example, since<br>
light waves are comprised of photons that have been traditionally represented by a wave,<br>
when waves or frequencies (i.e., energies according to Equation 1) do not match (e.g., do not<br>
match directly or indirectly or are not harmonics of and/or are not heterodynes of particular<br>
energies) with the particular energies required to, for example, generate an electron/hole pair<br>
(e.g., promote electrons to the conduction band) the particular component wave or frequency<br>
of light incident on the solar cell actually may detract or interfere with the production of<br><br>
power from a solar cell (e.g., desirable interactions with photons or waves of light may be at<br>
least partially, or substantially completely, offset by negative interactions).<br>
Moreover, it should also be clear that positive or desirable effects include, but are not<br>
limited to, those effects resulting from an interaction (e.g., hsterodyne, resonance, additive<br>
wave, subtractive wave, partial or complete constructive interference or partial or complete<br>
destructive interference) between a wavelength or frequency of incident light and a<br>
wavelength (e.g., atomic and/or molecular, etc.), frequency or property (e.g.. Stark effects,<br>
Zeeman effects, etc.) inherent to the substrate itself. Accordingly, by providing substantially<br>
only those energies (i.e., wavelengths and frequencies) of light required to cause desirable<br>
excitations in the solar cell photovoltaic materials (e.g., the formation of electron/hole pairs)<br>
the entire solar cell actually becomes more efficient. In some cases it may be difficult, if not<br>
impossible, to provide only those energies which provide desirable interactions, however, if<br>
as many undesirable energies as possible can be blocked, eliminated and/or modified prior to<br>
contacting the solar cell photovoltaic material, then the power output of the solar cell will be<br>
enhanced. This approach is contrary to the prior art approaches which have attempted to<br>
design semiconductor materials such that they may interact directly, or through, for example,<br>
various light trapping approaches, with an even broader spectrum of available light energies<br>
without regard to limiting particular "negative" light energies from being incident on the<br>
solar cell substrates (e.g., limiting incident energies to those partial energy levels (frequency<br>
and wavelength) that can result in desirable outputs from the solar cells without any<br>
substantial undesirable interactions occurring, due to, for example, utilizing energies of light<br>
which actually interfere with the production of power).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention satisfies the long felt need in the solar cell industry<br>
to render solar cells more efficient by recognizing that it is not desirable for all wavelengths<br>
of light within any particular spectrum of light (e.g., natural sunlight) to be incident upon a<br>
solar cell photovoltaic substrate (e.g., crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, single crystal<br>
silicon, cadmium sulfide, etc.) but rather to reduce or limit the incident light to as many of<br>
those wavelengths as possible which can result in predominantly desirable interactions<br>
between the incident light and the solar cell's photovoltaic substrate (i.e., in other words, to<br>
reduce as many negative or destructively interfering wavelengths of light as possible so as to<br>
reduce negative effects of, for example, destructive interference occurring in the photovoltaic<br>
substrate).<br>
In this regard, there will be a particular combination of specific frequencies of light<br>
(Note: light can be referred to by energy, wavelength and/or frequency, but for simplicity,<br><br>
will be referred to in these paragraphs immediately following primarily as "frequency" or<br>
"wavelength") that will desirably interact with a solar cell's photovoltaic substrate. The<br>
particular frequencies of light that should be caused to be incident upon a solar cell<br>
photovoltaic substrate should be as many of those frequencies as possible which can result in<br>
desirable effects (e.g., promoting electrons to a conduction band) within the substrate, while<br>
eliminating as many of those frequencies as possible which result in undesirable effects<br>
within the substrate. In this regard, certain frequencies will add energy to the photovoltaic<br>
material by, for example, causing atomic or molecular energies (e.g., electronic) to be<br>
provided ; certain frequencies of light will cause electrons to jump the band gap and/or form<br>
electron/hole pairs. It is important to note that virtually all of the desirable energies which<br>
can be applied to an appropriate photovoltaic substrate material can be calculated<br>
theoretically, or determined empirically. For example, if one knows the band gap width that<br>
is created within a semiconductor material due to, for example, the doping of the<br>
semiconductor with one or more suitable dopants, or the combination of band widths present<br>
in the material due to, for example, utilizing multiple suitable dopants, then those particular<br>
frequencies of light can be applied so that, for example, electron/hole pairs can be created<br>
and/or additional desirable energies can be imparted to, for example, electrons. For example,<br>
assuming arguendo that a band width created within a doped silicon semiconductor substrate<br>
required a wavelength of, for example, 600nm, to create an electron and/or electron/hole pair,<br>
then the application of a wavelength of light of about 600nm would be a very desirable and<br>
very effective wavelength to apply. However, all harmonics of a wavelength of 600nm<br>
would also be desirable (e.g., 1200,1800, 300,150, etc.). In addition, many heterodynes of<br>
600nm would be desirable (e.g.,If the material has wavelengths 600nm and lOOOnm, the<br>
substractive heterodyne is 400nm and the additive heterodyne is 1600nm In addition to the<br>
actual frequencies of the material, i.e. 600nm and lOOOnm, the heterodyned frequencies, i.e.<br>
400nm and 1600nm may also be beneficial.) Additionally, in this example, while the exact<br>
wavelength of 600nm would be the optimum wavelength to apply (as well as all those<br>
wavelengths corresponding to the exact harmonic and exact heterodyne wavelengths)<br>
wavelengths which are close to the 600 nm wavelength and thus that are close to the exact<br>
harmonic and/or close to the exact heterodyne wavelengths would also be desirable to apply.<br>
In this regard, Figure 4 shows atypical bell-shaped curve "B" which represents a distribution<br>
of frequencies around the desired frequency f0.<br>
Figure 4 thus represents additional desirable frequencies that can be applied which do<br>
not correspond exactly to fo, but are close enough to the frequency f0 to achieve a desired<br><br>
effect. In particular, for example, those frequencies between and including the frequencies<br>
within the range of f1 and f2 would be most desirable. Note that f1 and f2 correspond to those<br>
frequencies above and below the resonant frequency fO, wherein f1, and f2 correspond to about<br>
one half the maximum amplitude, amax, of the curve "B'. However, in practice, depending on<br>
the particular semiconductor material utilized, some frequencies slightly beyond those<br>
represented by the range of frequencies betweemf1, and f2 may also be desirable.<br>
In addition to the harmonic and heterodyne frequencies (wavelengths) discussed<br>
above, particular energies which provide, for example, atomic or molecular energies (e.g.,<br>
electronic) can also be permitted to interact with the photovoltaic substrate because providing<br>
such energies to the substrate material also is desirable in that energy is being transferred in a<br>
desirable manner to the photovoltaic substrate material.<br>
Still further, in some instances certain blocks or regions of incident light may be<br>
desirable to prevent from contacting a photovoltaic material. In this regard it may be<br>
desirable to block out complete portions of infrared wavelengths and/or complete portions of<br>
ultraviolet wavelengths to improve performance.<br>
The prerise combination of wavelengths or frequencies (and thus energies) that can be<br>
permitted to interact with solar cell photovoltaic substrates are important to determine,<br>
because essentially the desirable frequencies should be maximized, while the undesirable<br>
frequencies should be minimized.<br>
There exist numerous theoretical and empirical means for determining desirable and<br>
undesirable frequencies (and thus energies) of incident light which should be obvious to those<br>
of ordinary skill in this art. In addition, there are numerous means for limiting undesirable<br>
frequencies incident upon a substrate material. Some of these different means are discussed<br>
later herein.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a typical output response for a crystalline silicon solar cell. In this<br>
regard, the x-axis corresponds to wavelengths from about 300 nanometers to about 1400<br>
nanometers, which, is the typically desired response range that traditional solar cell<br>
manufacturers have sought for the photovoltaic material(s) comprising the solar cell. The y-<br>
axis corresponds to a particular output present at various measured wavelengths along the x-<br>
axis. The prior art is replete with attempts to describe means for utilizing more and more of<br>
the wavelengths contained in sunlight (e.g., light trapping techniques, etc.), however, the<br>
prior art misses the point that undesirable effects can also occur at the same time that certain<br>
desirable effects are occurring resulting in a canceling or blocking out of some of the<br>
desirable effects.<br>
In mis regard, for example, Figure 2 shows a first sine wave which corresponds to a<br>
particular wavelength " ", a certain amplitude "a" and a frequency of I cycle per second<br>
"υ". When the frequency of the sine wave matches perfectty, for example, the band gap<br>
energy in a semiconductor material, then substantially all of the energy in the sine wave is<br>
transferred into the creation of, for example, an electron/hole pair. However, when the<br>
frequency does not match exactly, the prior art believes mat some of the energy may or may<br>
not be involved in desirable effects in the photovoltaic substrate material, but the prior art<br>
does not recognize that those frequencies which do not match desirable energy levels in a<br>
photovoltaic material actually may provide deleterious effects. These deleterious effects can<br>
be shown in, for example, Figure 3.<br>
Figure 3 shows two different incident sine waves 1 and 2 which correspond to two<br>
different energies, wavelengths  and . (and thus different frequencies) of light (or photons)<br>
which could be made to be incident upon the surface of a photovoltaic solar cell substrate<br>
material. Each of the sine waves 1 and 2 has a different differential equation which describes<br>
its individual motion. However, when the sine waves are combined into the resultant additive<br>
wave 1+ 2, the resulting complex differential equation, which describes the resultant<br>
combined energies, actually results in certain of the input energies being high (i.e.,<br>
constructive interference) at certain points in time, as well as being low (i.e., destructive<br>
interference) at certain points in time.<br>
In particular, assuming that the sine wave 1 corresponds to desirable incident energy<br>
having a wavelength , which would result in positive or favorable effects if permitted to be<br><br>
incident on a solar cell substrate; and further assuming that the sine wave 2 corresponds to<br>
undesirable incident energy having a wavelength , which would not result in positive or<br>
favorable effects if permitted to be incident on a solar cell substrate, then fee resultant<br>
 additive wave 1+2 shows some interesting characteristics. For example, the portions "X"<br>
represent areas where the two waves 1 and 2 have at least partially constructively interfered,<br>
whereas the portions "Y" represent areas where the two waves 1 and 2 have at least partially<br>
destructively interfered. Depending upon whether the portions "X" corresponds to desirable<br>
or undesirable wavelengths (i.e., resulting in positive or negative interactions with the<br>
substrate, respectively) then the portions "X" could enhance a positive effect in a substrate or<br>
could enhance a negative effect in a substrate. Similarly, depending on whether the portions<br>
"Y" correspond to desirable or undesirable wavelengths, then the portions "Y" may<br>
correspond to the effective loss of either a positive or negative effect.<br>
It should be clear from this particular analysis that partial or complete constructive<br>
interferences (i.e., the points "X") could maximize both positive and negative effects and that<br>
partial or complete destructive interferences "Y" could minimize both positive and negative<br>
effects. Accordingly, in this simplified example, by permitting predominantly desirable<br>
wavelengths  to be incident upon a semiconductor surface, the possibilities of negative<br>
effects resulting from the combination of waves 1 and 2 would be minimized or eliminated.<br>
In this regard, it is noted that in practice many desirable incident wavelengths can be made to<br>
be incident on a surface of a photovoltaic substrate material. Moreover, it should also be<br>
clear that positive or desirable effects include, but are not limited to, those effects resulting<br>
from an interaction (e.g., heterodyne, resonance, additive wave, subtractive wave, partially or<br>
substantially complete constructive interference, or partially or substantially complete<br>
destructive interference) between a wavelength or frequency of incident light and a<br>
wavelength (e.g., atomic and/or molecular, etc.), frequency or property (e.g., Stark effects,<br>
Zeeman effects, etc.) inherent to the substrate itself. Thus, by maximizing the desirable<br>
wavelengtns (or minimizing undesirable wavelengths), solar cell efficiencies never before<br>
known can be achieved. Alternatively stated, certain destructive interference effects resulting<br>
from the combinations of different energies, frequencies and/or wavelengths can reduce the<br>
output in a solar cell photovoltaic substrate material. The present invention attempts to mask<br>
or screen as many of such undesirable energies (or wavelengths) as possible from becoming<br>
incident on the surface of a photovoltaic substrate and thus strive for, for example, the<br>
synergistic results that can occur due to, for example, desirable constructive interference<br>
effects between the incident wavelengths of light<br><br>
For example, it is known that glasses of various compositions can absorb, refract<br>
and/or reflect certain radiation which comes from the sun. Glasses can be manufactured so<br>
that they contain various elements in their structure that can absorb photons of particular<br>
energies (and thus wavelengths and frequencies) such that such absorbed energy does not<br>
find its way to a material (e.g., a photovoltaic substrate) located behind such glasses.<br>
One exemplary' empirical method to determine which wavelengths are the most<br>
desirable to be permitted to be incident upon a surface of a photovoltaic substrate utilize a<br>
concept related generally to that concept used in a tunable dye laser. Specifically, for<br>
example, a tunable die laser, generally, outputs multiple frequencies (or energies) of light<br>
from a laser source into a prism. The prism then separates or diffracts the multiple<br>
frequencies of light as an output The multiple frequency output from the prism can then be<br>
selectively gated by an optical slit (e.g. a micrometer driven grating) which can be precisely<br>
positioned to permit transmission of only limited or desired frequencies therethrough. This<br>
selective positioning of the optical slit is what causes the laser to be tunable. By utilizing a<br>
device which uses one or more blocking portions (e.g. preferably a plurality) of blocking<br>
portions rather than an optical slit, wavelengths which are deleterious undesirable for the<br>
performance of a solar cell can be determined. The blocking portions can be of any suitable<br>
height and width to achieve the desirable blocking of wavelength of light.<br>
Accordingly, once it is determined, either theoretically or empirically, which<br>
wavelengths are the most desirable to be permitted to be incident upon a surface of a<br>
photovoltaic substrate material, then glass can be designed to, for example, absorb as many<br>
wavelengths of light as possible except for those wavelengths which result in positive<br>
interactions. In this regard, it is well known in the glass industry how to incorporate certain<br>
"impurities" into glasses to cause them to absorb various frequencies of light Thus, the glass<br>
can be viewed simply as functioning as a filter (when added to an existing solar cell or panel<br>
(e.g., retrofitting) or inherently being part of the manufacture of a solar cell or solar panel<br>
when originally manufactured) which does not permit certain wavelengths of light to pass<br>
therethrough, or rather, permit as many desirable wavelengths of light as possible to pass<br>
therethrough. In addition, certain coatings can be placed directly upon an incident surface of<br>
a photovoltaic substrate material functioning as a solar cell to assist in blocking certain<br>
energies (or wavelengths or frequencies) of light to be incident thereon. In this regard, there<br>
may be a need to produce a sandwich or layered structure of materials, for example, on a<br>
front surface of a solar cell photovoltaic substrate material such mat the combination of<br>
materials actually serve to breakup or prevent certain light from being incident on a<br><br>
photovoltaic surface located behind the layered structure. Further, rather than merely<br>
capturing or absorbing undesirable light energies, it would be possible, through the use of, for<br>
example, certain physical structures, to cause certain wavelengths of light to be refracted,<br>
reflected or otherwise modified and minimize particular undesirable wavelengths, frequencies<br>
and/or energies to be incident on a surface of a solar cell photovoltaic substrate material.<br>
Furthermore, certain monomer, oligimer. polymer and/or organometallic materials<br>
could also be desirable surface materials that could be used alone or in combination with, for<br>
example, certain glass materials in an attempt to achieve the goals of the invention, namely,<br>
to maximize particular desirable wavelengths, frequencies and/or energies to be incident on a<br>
surface of a solar cell substrate material or, alternatively, to minimize particular undesirable<br>
wavelengths, frequencies and/or energies from being incident on a surface of a solar cell<br>
substrate.<br>
Moreover, in certain cases it may be desirable to utilize an iterative-type process,<br>
whereby certain solar cell materials are modified slightly in conjunction with the filtering or<br>
blocking and/or light refracting materials (e.g., at least one means for modifying incident<br>
sunlight prior to sunlight contacting the photovoltaic substrate) which are provided on at least<br>
one surface thereof In this regard, it is well known that different dopants can be utilized in<br>
different semiconductor materials and that different dopants (or combinations of dopants) can<br>
result in different, for example, band gaps or band gap energy widths within a photovoltaic<br>
material, as well as different atomic or molecular energies (e.g., electronic which can be<br>
excited). Thus, it may be more advantageous to manufacture a particular type of photovoltaic<br>
substrate material to be used in conjunction with, for example, certain coverings and/or<br>
filters. The combination of the photovoltaic material and the covering and/or filtering<br>
material(s) may be different for different applications where the solar cells may experience,<br>
for example, higher or lower water contents in the atmosphere, higher or lower energies,<br>
higher or lower operating temperatures, etc., all of which factors can influence, for example,<br>
band gaps or energy levels within a photovoltaic substrate. All of such factors can be taken<br>
into account when designing a system such that the resultant system can provide the<br>
maximum effectiveness for the particular solar cells and/or solar panels. Moreover, in a<br>
similar regard, certain solar cell applications may find themselves in high temperature<br>
environments such as deserts, near the Equator, etc., whereby the operating temperature of<br>
the solar cells could be much higher relative, for example, the Arctic or Antarctic, outer<br>
space, etc. These higher temperatures can also influence energy levels within a photovoltaic<br>
substrate material. In addition, for example, photovoltaic materials located in outer space<br><br>
will, typically, be exposed to frequencies which are different from those frequencies which<br>
are incident on similar photovoltaic materials, located, for example, in the earth's atmosphere<br>
at sea level. In this regard, the particular combination of solar cell photovoltaic material and<br>
at least one means for modifying incident sunlight (e.g., a covering or filter material) may be<br>
different in one application or environment versus another. However, it is the goal of the<br>
invention that once the particular environment in which the solar cell is going to be operating<br>
in is understood, that the most desirable combination of solar cell substrate and covering or<br>
filter can be utilized in combination with each other.<br>
While there has been illustrated and described what is at present considered to be the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes and modifications may be made, and equivalents may be substituted<br>
for elements thereof without departing from me true scope of the invention. In addition,<br>
many modifications may be made to adapt the teachings of the invention to a particular<br>
situation without departing from the central scope of the invention. Therefore, it is intended<br>
that mis invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed as the best mode<br>
contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all<br>

The present invention relates to improvements in solar cell and solar panel photovoltaic materials which cause the solar cells/panels to operate more efficiently. In particular, the present invention focuses primarily on matching or modifying particular incident light energies (e.g. from the sun) to predetermined energy levels in a solar photovoltaic substrate material required to excite, for example, electrons in at least a portion of the substrate material in a desirable manner. In this regard, for example, energy levels of incident light, and thus, corresponding particular wavelengths, such as desirable wavelength (λ1), or<br>
frequencies of incident light, can be at least partially matched with various desirable energy levels in a substrate material by filtering out at least a portion of certain undesirable incident light, such as that of wavelength (λ2), that comes into contact with at least a portion of a surface of solar cell photovoltaic substrate.</td>
