Cross-References to Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority to, and incorporates by reference herein in its entirety, pending United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No* 60/488,S8C (Attorney Docket No. 2003P91SSUS), filed 21 July 2003.<br>
Background<br>
Rotating equipment, such as the rotors of an electric motor, are inherently unbalanced due to variations in material and manufacturing tolerances. Unbalanced operation accordingly results in vibration, The magnitude of vibration'is related to the magnitude of unbalance, and increases as the rotating speed approaches the rotor's natural frequency (the rotor's critical speed). It will be appreciated that for flexible shaft rotors, critical speed is less than operating speed. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that vibration undermines the performance of rotating equipment such as an electric motor. Further, continued episodes of vibration will limit the life of the rotating equipment and will result in higher maintenance costs. Therefore, there is need to minimize vibration in rotating devices such as electric motors.<br>
For example, as a flexible shaft rotor transcends it critical speed, which occurs within its operating speed, the magnitude of vibration increases. The magnitude of vibration can be reduced by providing balancing of a third balancing plane, which i a rotating device such as an electric motor is located in close proximity to the rotor geometric center. By providing a third plane for balancing, the counter balance weight can be distributed such that the force due to unbalanced weight can be reduced to a negligible amount throughout the entire speed range of a rotating device.<br>
Conventional systems and methods for balancing a third plane of a rotating device require the removal of active material, such as electrical steel laminations at the center plane location. This in turn requires a longer rotor core to compensate for<br><br>
removal of active material. It will be appreciated that another disadvantage of conventional systems and methods for minimizing vibration of rotating devices is that the rotor must be entirely removed from the rotating device, such as a motor, foi eachbalancing attempt. Accordingly, there is an unmet need to effectively and efficiently minimize vibration of a rotating device by balancing a third plane.<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention achieves three plane balancing without removal of active material, (e.g., electrical steel laminations).<br>
Certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a rotating machine assembly comprising a rotor machine assembly including a shaft, a plurality of laminations shrink fix around the circumference of the shaft, and weights affixed therebetween the laminations,<br>
Certain exemplary embodiments provide a rotating machine assembly comprising a rotor, a spider shaft within the rotor, a plane affixed to the spider shaft, and weights affixed to the plane for balancing the rotor.<br>
Certain exemplary embodiments provide a rotating machine assembly comprising a<br>
rotor,<br>
a spider shaft positioned within the rotor, a longitudinal plurality of bars affixed and<br>
extending from the spider shaft at predetermined positions, a cross bar affixed<br>
between each pair of the longitudinal plurality of bars, and weights fastened to at least<br>
one of the cross bars to promote balancing of the rotating assembly.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Certain exemplary embodiments provide a rotating machine assembly comprising a rotor machine assembly including a shaft, a plurality of laminations shrink fit around the circumference of the shaft, and weights affixed therebetween the laminations. Certain exemplary embodiments provide a rotating machine assembly comprising a rotor, a spider shaft within the rotor, a plane affixed to the spider shaft, and weights affixed to the plane for balancing the rotor. Certain exemplary embodiments provide a rotating machine assembly comprising a rotor, a spider shaft positioned within the rotor, a longitudinal plurality of bats affixed and extending from the spider shaft at predetermined positions, a cross bar affixed between each pair of the longitudinal plurality of bars, and weights fastened to at least one of the cross bars to promote balancing of the rotating assembly.<br>
FIGS. 1A&gt; IB and 1C show an exemplary diagram of a prior art system for providing a third plane for three plane balancing. As shown, a rotor assembly 100 includes rotor laminations of electrical steel lamination material 101, a shaft 103, rotor bars 104 and end connectors 105 connected to copper bars 104-. Rotor assembly 100 includes axial 106 and radial air vents 107, A thick metal disc 102 is positioned and shrink fit around the circumference of shaft 103.<br><br>
"Thick metal disc 102 provides a center plane, which is also referred to as a third plane. Disc 102 is specially machined to receive balance weights 108. A balance weight 108 is fastened with fasteners 109 at each position, determined by a balancing procedure, to disc 102. Weights 108 are attached at positions as required by a previously performed balancing procedure that tests the rotor assembly and determines the angles, and thereby positions, in which each weight 108 is to be fastened to the exterior surface of disc 102.<br>
It will be appreciated that use of a thick metal disc 102 of approximately *5-L5 inches in thickness for use as a center plane to provide three plane balancing, requires removal of active electrical steel material from rotor laminations 101. Since the weights are fastened and extend from the surface of metal disc 102, it is necessary to remove active electrical steel material. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that by removing active electrical steel material the efficiency and power provided by rotor assembly 100 is diminished. Accordingly, there is a need for a system and method for providing balancing of a rotor assembly system without negatively impacting operation of the rotating electric device performance (e.g., motor).<br>
FIG. 2A is a side view of an exemplary embodiment of rotor assembly 200 of the present invention. It will be appreciated that rotor assembly 200 includes specially designed lamination 210 and lamination 220.

FIG. 2D is a diagram showing trapezoidal air vents 112 provided in lamination 220 in the near center packet laminations and in spaced relation to laminations 210. FIG. 2C shows a cross -sectional view of laminations 210 and 220.<br>
Balance weights 213 have the same trapezoidal shape as trapezoidal vents 212 and include a drilled aperture to receive fasteners 209 which arc secured between lamination 210 and 220 during a balancing procedure. It will be appreciated that in certain embodiments fasteners 209 are metal bolts. An aperture of balancing weight<br><br>
213 receives fastener 209 and fastener 209 is then passed through trapezoidal air vents 212. Fastener 209 passes through a circular aperture of lamination 210 and is secured by a fastening securement element 221, It will be appreciated that in certain embodiment the fastening securement element is a metal nut<br>
It will be appreciated that laminations are not removed in the present invention since laminations instead of a solid metal discs secure the balancing weights. As a result electrical steel material of the rotor assembly is not decreased, and therefore the present invention does not degrade the efficiency and power provided by the operation of the electric rotating device, such as a motor.<br>
FIG. 3 A is a diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention for providing balancing weights to rotoT assembly 300 that includes a spider shaft construction-of a rotor, As shown in FIG. 3C, solid circular shaft 203 is milled to a take the form of spider shaft 314. Spider shaft 314 is milled Co include a predetermined number of spiders 315 that project from its core. A disc shaped plane 316 is provided proximate to the geometrical center of spider shaft 314 and of a desired thickness. It will be appreciated that in certain embodiments the desired thickness (width) of the disc shaped plane is approximately .5-.7S inches.<br>
Plane 316 includes threaded apertures 317 to accept balance weights 318 provided during a balancing procedure. It will be appreciated that for each balancing weight 318, a fastener 309 is inserted through a drilled aperture of each weight and a threaded aperture 317 of plane 316. As shown in FIG 3C, fastener 309 is secured by a fastening securement element 321, such as a bolt.<br>
FIG, 4A is a diagram of another exemplary embodiment of the present invention as applied to a welded spider shaft 419. As shown in FIG. 4B, longitudinal rectangular bars 420 are welded at predetermined positions to circular shaft 423 to provide spider shaft 419. Approximate to the geometrical center of shaft 419 additional rectangular bars 421 are welded between longitudinal rectangular bars 420.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 4C, longitudinal rectangular bars 420 extending from circular shaft 423 include tapped apertures to accept balancing weights 418 as provided during the balancing procedure. It will be appreciated that for each balancing weight 418, a fastener 409 is inserted through an aperture of each weight and a tapped aperture of rectangular bars 42 L Fastener 409 is secured by a fastening securement element 422. such as a bolt.<br>
HG. 5 is an exemplary embodiment of the conventional process of generated output 500 that identifies the required weight and location for placement of weights for balancing a rotor assembly. HG. 5A shows that on plane 1 a 17.6 gram weight is to be positioned at 306 degrees, while on plane 2 a 22.7 gram weight is to be placed at 46 degrees.<br>
It should be appreciated that weights are only fastened to only a portion of the apertures of the laminations. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the closing of small apertures does not effect the operation of the rotor assembly,<br>
