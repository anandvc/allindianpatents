It has been found that compounds of formula I inhibit KDR (kinase insert domain-containing receptor) and FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) kinases. These compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have antiproUferative activity and are useful in the treatment or control of cancer, in particular solid tumors. In addition these compounds have advantageous bioavailability profiles. This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to methods of treating or controlling cancer, most particularly the treatment or control of breast, lung, colon and prostate tumors.<br>
Protein kinases are a class of proteins (enzymes) that regulate a variety of cellular functions. This is accomplished by the phosphorylation of specific amino acids on protein substrates resulting in conformational alteration of the substrate protein. The conformational change modulates the activity of the substrate or its ability to interact with other binding partners. The enzyme activity of the protein kinase refers to the rate at which the kinase adds phosphate groups to a substrate. It can be measured, for example, by determining the amount of a substrate that is converted to a product as a function of time. Phosphorylation of a substrate occurs at the active-site of a protein kinase.<br>
Tyrosine kinases are a subset of protein kinases that catalyze the transfer of the terminal phosphate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to tyrosine residues on protein substrates. These kinases play an important part in the propagation of growth factor signal transduction that leads to cellular proliferation, differentiation and migration.<br>
For example, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been recognized as important mediators of tumor promoted angiogenesis. VEGF activates endothelial cells by signaling through two high affinity receptors, one of which is the kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR). See, Hennequin L. F. et. ah, J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45(6), ppl300. FGF activates endothelial cells by signaling through the FGF receptor (FGFR). Solid tumors depend upon the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to grow. Accordingly&gt; inhibitors of the receptors FGFR and KDR that interfere with the growth signal transduction, and thus slow down or prevent<br><br>
angiogenesis&gt; are useful agents in the prevention and treatment of solid tumors. See, Klohs W.E. et al., Current Opinion in Biotechnology 1999, 10, p.544.<br>
There are several examples of small molecule inhibitors of protein kinase catalytic activity. In particular, small molecule inhibitors typically block the phosphorylation of substrates by tightly interacting with the protein kinase ATP binding site (or "active site"). See, WO 98/24432 and Hennequin L. F. et. al., J. Med. Chem. 2002,45(6), ppl300. Several of these compounds inhibit multiple targets. For example, WO 99/61444 (Warner-Lambert) discloses bicyclic pyrimidines and bicyclic 3,4-dihydropyrimidines of formula <br>
that are asserted to inhibit cyclin dependent kinases Cdkl, Cdk2 and Cdk4 as well as the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes PDGFR and FGFR. Some compounds are also asserted to inhibit Cdk6.<br>
WO 01/55148A1 discloses a method for treating neurodegenerative diseases in mammals comprising administering an effective amount of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, preferably using Cdk inhibitors of formula<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,150,373 discloses bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles of formula<br><br>
that are stated to inhibit the T-cell tyrosine kinase p56lck.<br>
WO 02/18380 Al discloses 7-oxo pyridopyrimidines of formula<br><br><br>
that are stated to inhibit p38 mediated cellular functions and are thus inhibitors of cellular proliferation.<br>
WO 96/34867 discloses 6-aryl pyrido [2,3-d] pyrimidine 7-imines, 7-ones, and 7-thiones of formula <br>
are inhibitors of protein kinases, and useful in treating cellular proliferation mediated diseases.<br>
WO 98/33798 discloses pyrido [2&gt;3-d] pyrimidines and 4-aminopyrimidines as inhibitors of cellular proliferation. Specifically, this publication discloses a group of 7,8-dihydro-2-(amino andthio)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines and 2&gt;4-diaminopyrimidines that are potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and growth mediated kinases.<br>
WO 01/64679 Al discloses l^-disubstituted-S^-dihydro-lH-pyrimidof^S-D]pyrimidin-2-one compounds of formula<br><br>
that are stated to be useful in treating CSBP/P38 kinase mediated diseases.<br>
WO 02/12237 A2 discloses a process for preparing 2-(4-priydyl)amino-6-dialkoxyphenyl-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-ones3 and WO 02/12238 A2 discloses 2-(4-pyridyl)amino-6-dialko:xyphe<br><br><br>
These compounds are asserted to be useful in treating diseases resulting from uncontrolled cell growth.<br>
There continues to be a need for easily synthesized, small-molecule compounds effective in inhibiting the catalytic activity of protein kinases, in particular FGFR and KDR kinases for treating one or more types of solid tumors. It is particularly desirable to provide small molecule inhibitors that are selective for FGFR and KDR. This is desirable because the potential concomitant inhibition of targets involved in angiogenesis could provide better efficacy. On the other hand, toxicity and other undesirable complications may follow from inhibiting multiple targets. It is preferable that such small molecule inhibitors also possess advantageous bioavailability profiles. It is therefore desirable to provide such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds.<br>
The present invention relates to novel dihydropyridinone compounds capable of selectively inhibiting the activity of KDR and FGFR. These compounds are useful for the treatment or control of cancer, in particular the treatment or control of solid tumors. In particular this invention relates to compounds of formulas I and II:<br><br><br>
with the proviso that Ar is not 2-pyridyl or substituted 2-pyridyl.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of formulas I and II, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for treating solid tumors, in particular breast, lung, prostate or colon tumors, by administering to a human patient in need of such therapy an effective amount of a compound of formulas I or II, and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The present invention is further directed to novel intermediate compounds useful in the preparation of compounds of formulas I and II.<br>

The cells were fixed and DNA denatured by adding 200 pL of fixation / denaturation solution to each well and incubating at room temperature for 45 minutes. The fixation / denaturation solution was drained onto paper towels and to each well was added 100 pL of anti-BrdU-POD and the wells were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The antibody solution was removed and the Avells were each washed 3-4 times with 300 pL PBS. 100 pL of the TMB substrate solution was added to each well.and the wells were incubated at room temperature for 5-8 minutes. The reaction was then stopped by adding 100 pL per well of 1 M phosphoric acid. The plates were read at 450 nm with reference wavelength of 650 nm. The percent inhibition for each test compound was calculated by subtracting the absorbency of the blank (no cells) wells from all wells,<br><br>
then subtracting the division of the average absorbency of each test duplicate by the average of the controls from 1. The final product was then multiplied by 100 (% of inhibition = (1-average absorbency of test duplicate/average of control) 100). The IC50 value is the concentration of test compound that inhibits by 50% BrdU labeling, and is a measure of inhibition of cell proliferation. The IC50 is determined from the linear regression of a plot of the logarithm of the concentration versus percent inhibition. The IC50 values are shown in Table 2 below.<br><br>
