				<td>The present invention relates to a machine for binding and perforation of resin coated loose paper leafs for manufacturing of wall hanging type Date Calendars.<br>
This machine is used for automatic binding of calendar pages. Besides sealing the edges of the calendar pages, this also creates punched holes at the required locations. The same machine can also be used for binding books, exercise books, writing pads and note books where bunch of papers need arresting at its edges.<br>
At present date calendar binding is done by using metallic strips at the top edge of the calendar pages or by using spirals through the holes at the top edges of the calendars.<br>
US patent(no.4859271) Lamination apparatus having multiple book platens deals with an Apparatus for laminating layers of book composed of printed circuit layers and adhesive layers and this comprises a vacuum chamber to house the items to be laminated. This type of machine, although uses adhesives and press for binding/ lamination of electronic wafer, like printed card but this apparatus cannot be used for Calendar sealing purpose. US patent (no. 4784712, process for sheet lamination) is related to the invention of a process to provide a laminated board lap desk. This process and apparatus also uses glue (adhesive), press and heat to create lamination on two dimensional object. But this process and the machine cannot be used for calendar sealing. Search in public domain does not indicate availability of suitable machine for calendar sealing. US patent (5102277) uses external application of adhesive for the manufacturing of booklets and the method is not suitable for the manufacturing of calendars. US patent (4904138) discloses a method of operation of a binding machine from the point of view of sensing the thickness of the bunch of papers. The method also uses external glue for binding and the machine is not appropriate for producing calendars. US patent (4678386) is similar to forming a note pad/ folder out of loose sheets but not a suitable machine for the manufacturing of a calendar from a bunch of art papers or resin coated loose leafs.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a machine for binding and perforation of resin coated loose paper leafs, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above and suitable for calendar sealing. Another object of the present invention is to create the punched holes on the calendar at some required locations simultaneously with the sealing.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a machine for binding and perforation of resin coated loose paper leafs which is a high speed automatic product unit for the purpose of calendar binding.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to create the automation of the machine through pneumatic actuation.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to coordinate the application of pneumatic high pressure, heat, bunch of two dimensional materials (like paper, art paper, plasticized paper, coated papers) to achieve bound end product.<br>
In the drawing accompanying this specification, figure. 1 represents the three dimensional view (not to the scale) of the complete machine. The part list from 1 to 9 are clarified as follows.<br>
1.	Pneumatic cylinder<br>
2.	Guide pin<br>
3.	Top Die.<br><br>
4.	Bottom Die<br>
5.	Working table<br>
6.	Start switch<br>
7.	Pneumatic gauge<br>
8.	Stop switch<br>
9.	Timer<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a machine for binding &amp; perforation of resin coated loose paper leafs which comprises a pair of hot press dies, the bottom die (4) having a plurality of female indentations being fixed on a horizontal platform(5), the top die (3) having corresponding male indentations being movably fixed above the said fixed bottom die, the said top die being characterized in that having been connected to at least one means such as plurality of pneumatic cylinder(l) with pneumatic gauge (7), electrical start/stop switch (6,8), timer(9) and the said means being capable of providing vertical movement with time delay and vertical pressure ranging 10-12 kg /sq.cm.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention each of the hot press dies may be provided with built in heating elements and temperature sensor(s).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the rear end of the bottom die may be provided with a stopper plate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the pair of hot press dies may be provided with all round insulation except on the contact face.<br>
The operating principle is based on the thermoplastic property of the synthetic resins. Normally the special printing ink used in printing a calendar may also contain the synthetic resin having binding tendency with adjacent surfaces. The coating containing resins due to combined effect of appropriate heat and pressure penetrate into the individual sheets so that the fibers in each sheet are bound together with the fibers in the sheets above. The machine (figure. 1) is pneumatically operated. Ref to figure 1 , there are two dies in the machine. The bottom die (no.4 )being fixed on the table (no.5) and the top die (no.3) is connected with plurality of pneumatic cylinders(no. 1). The top die can move vertically up and down along two guide pins (no.2 ) with the help of the pneumatic cylinders. Heaters are fitted inside the dies for heating and temperature sensors are provided with the dies for measuring and controlling the temperatures.<br>
The Calendar pages are fed on the front table such that the top edges of the pages are placed on the bottom die. There is a start switch(no.6 ) and a stop switch (no. 8 ). The set pressure is visible in the pressure gauge (no.7). As the start switch is pressed the pneumatic cylinders are actuated and the top die comes down on the bottom die. After a few seconds of time (as set in the timer (no.9)) the top die automatically goes up. The finished alendar is taken out from the table.<br>
Here all the parameters like pressure, temperature, type of<br>
thermoplastic coating or other adhesives, product thickness etc. can be easily<br>
changed as and when required according to the job to be performed.	<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1 No.of pages in a bunch = 5 Temperature of dies =118 degree centigrade. Pressure = 10 kf/sq.cm. Time of sealing = 3 seconds.<br>
EXAMPLE-2 No.of pages in a bunch = 6 Temperature of dies = 120 degree centigrade. Pressure = 1 lkf/sq.cm. Time of sealing = 3.5 seconds<br>
EXAMPLE-3 No.of pages in a bunch = 7 Temperature of dies = 122 degree centigrade. Pressure = 12 kf/sq.cm. Time of sealing = 4 seconds<br>
In all the above cases the team members achieved uniform sealing (along the entire edge of the job) of very good quality.<br>
Novelty lies in the fact that, one of the ingredient (that is the resin) already present in the coating domain of the calendar surface has also been thought, creating appropriate physical conditions of heat (115-125 deg. Centigrade) and pressure (10-12 kg/ sq.cm.) for the purpose of binding The inventive steps rest on the fact that such a binding facility has been designed by developing a complete machine as in figure 1 which is not a obvious solution to create such a physical condition, that too with suflQcient automation.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are<br>
1.	Extra material in the form of metallic strips or spirals are not required.<br>
2.	It is automatic machine and production rate is high.<br>
3.	The calendars manufactured in this method have better aesthetic value.<br>
4.	Two important features i.e. a central punch hole for hanging the calendar on the wall and a series of smaller holes for tearing off the Calendar pages by the end users are created in a single step along with the sealing . By this, extra machine or manpower is not required.<br><br><br>
We claim :<br>
1.	A machine for binding &amp; perforation of resin coated loose paper leafs which comprises a pair of hot press dies, the bottom die (4) having a plurality of female indentations being fixed on a horizontal platform(5), the top die (3) having corresponding male indentations being movably fixed above the said fixed bottom die , the said top die being characterized in that having been connected to at least one means such as plurality of pneumatic cylinder (1) with pneumatic gauge (7), electrical start /stop switch (6,8), timer (9) and the said means being capable of providing vertical movement with time delay and vertical pressure ranging 10-12kg/sq.cm.<br>
2.	A machine as claimed in claim 1, where in each of the hot press dies are provided with built in heating element &amp; temperature sensor.<br>
3.	A machine as claimed in claim 1-2, where in the rear end is provided with a stopper plate.<br>
