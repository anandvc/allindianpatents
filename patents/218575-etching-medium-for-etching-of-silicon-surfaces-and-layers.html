Etching pastes for silicon surfaces and layers<br>
	The present invention relates to novel etching media in the form of<br>
	etching pastes for full-area and selective etching of silicon surfaces and<br>
5	 layers, and to the use thereof.<br>
Prior art<br>
	In the photovoltaics, electronics and semiconductor industry, silicon<br>
10 	surfaces and layers are often etched by wet-chemical methods in dip<br>
	baths. This full-area etching can be carried out either in an acidic<br>
	medium (isotropic etching) or in an alkaline medium (anisotropic etch-<br>
	ing). In acidic etching, mixtures of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid are<br>
	frequently used, in alkaline etching, strong bases, such as sodium<br>
15 	hydroxide solution, potassium hydroxide soIution, tetramethyIammonium<br>
	hydroxide (TMAH), etc., are frequently used.<br>
	In order to produce defined, fine etching patterns/structures (for<br>
	example for buried structures) in addition to full-area etching (for<br>
20 	example polish etches, texture etches), material-intensive, time-<br>
	consuming and expensive process steps, such as, for example, the<br>
	photolithographic masking process known to the person skilled in the<br>
	art, are necessary before the actual etching step.<br>
25 	In a masking process of this type, the starting material is a silicon wafer.<br>
	A dense oxide layer is produced thereon by thermal oxidation and<br>
	structured as follows.<br>
	The oxide is uncovered at the desired points by coating with a photo-<br>
30 	resist, drying, exposing to UV light using a photomask, and subse-<br>
	quently developing, and then removed using hydrofluoric acid. The<br>
	photoresist which still remains is subsequently removed ("stripped"), for<br>
	example using a solvent. The Si wafer thus provided with an oxide mask<br>
	can then be etched selectively at the points not covered by the oxide in<br>
35	 a strong base, such as, for example, 30% KOH, The oxide mask is<br><br>
WO 2004/032218	PCT/EP2003/008805<br>
-2-<br>
	resistant to the base. After selective etching of the silicon, the oxide<br>
	mask is usually removed again using hydrofluoric acid.<br>
	Lithographic processes of this type are not used in the industrial pro-<br>
5 	duction of solar cells for cost reasons [1]. However, selective structur-<br>
	ing/opening of the silicon surface or layer is necessary by the following<br>
	procedure.<br>
	In the production process for a standard silicon solar ceil, the p-n transi-<br>
10 	tion necessary for the photoelectric effect is formed on a p-doped wafer<br>
	by, for example, gas diffusion in a POCI3 oven. In the process, an<br>
	n-doped silicon layer with a thickness of about 500 nm is formed around<br>
	the entire wafer and has to be partially opened/cut for the tater photo-<br>
	voltaic application.<br>
15<br>
	This opening can be carried out mechanically, by laser cutting or dry-<br>
	etching methods, such as plasma etching.<br>
	The disadvantages of mechanical cutting, for example grinding of the<br>
20 	cell edges in the final step of the production process (after metallisa-<br>
	tion), consist in considerable losses of silicon material (and metal<br>
	paste), the mechanical stress and the formation of crystal defects in the<br>
	solar cell.<br>
25 	Plasma etching is carried out with fluorinated hydrocarbons, for example<br>
	with CF4 or C2F6 gas, in expensive vacuum equipment. In this process,<br>
	the cells are stacked in advance and etched at the cell edges in the<br>
	plasma-etching unit. Considerable handling problems during stacking<br>
	and high wafer breakage rates occur in the process. These technologi-<br>
30 	cal problems will intensify even further in the future since the aim is,<br>
	owing to high material costs, to use ever thinner potycrystalline silicon<br>
	starting substrates (
	of 250-330 µm which are usual today.<br>
35 	Owing to the requisite linear (XY) movement of the punctiform laser<br>
	source, the isolation of the p-n transition by laser is a time-consuming,<br><br>
WO 2004/032218	PCT/EP2003/008805<br>
-3-<br>
	throughput-limiting process. The investment costs considerable. In<br>
	addition, local crystal defects are generated.<br>
	In expensive processes for the production of a selective emitter, which<br>
5 	have currently only been developed and used on a laboratory scale, the<br>
	lithographic oxide masking already described above is used. The oxide<br>
	masks the wafer in such a way that the areas on which the contacts will<br>
	later lie remain free. The masked wafer is subjected to phosphorus dif-<br>
	fusion and n++-doped in the non-masked areas. After removal of the<br>
10 	oxide mask, the entire wafer is n+-doped [2].<br>
	This gives a solar cell with a selective emitter, i.e. with highly doped n++<br>
	areas with a depth of 2-3 µm (areas without oxide mask and later lying<br>
	under the contacts) with a doping concentrations of about 1*1020 cm-3<br>
15 	and a flat (0.5-1 µm) n+-doped emitter over the entire solar cell with a<br>
	doping concentration of about 1*1019 cm-3.<br>
	The alternative to lithography is the use of screen-printed contact lines<br>
	as etching mask. Both wet-chemical and plasma-chemical etching is<br>
20 	described in the literature. Disadvantages of dipping the screen-printed<br>
	solar cell into a mixture of HF/HNO3 - besides the intended removal of<br>
	silicon between the contact lines - are attack of the silicon beneath the<br>
	contact lines and etching damage in the metal contact lines themselves.<br>
	This causes rapid impairment of the fill factor [3].<br>
25<br>
	Plasma-chemical etching (reactive ion etching, RIE) is carried out using<br>
	gases, such as, for example, SF6 or SF6/O2, in expensive vacuum<br>
	equipment and with considerable technological optimisation effort for<br>
	the process [4], [5], [6].<br>
30<br>
	Besides the formation of the selective emitter, the silicon surface here is<br>
	structured (roughened, "textured") on the emitter side in such a way that<br>
	the antireflection behaviour of the solar cell improves.<br>
35 	the object of the invention is to find a less expensive process with lower<br>
	material fosses for opening the p-n transition in solar cells.<br><br>
WO 2004/032218	PCT/EP2003/008805<br>
-4-<br>
	The object of the present invention is therefore also to provide a simple,<br>
	inexpensive process which can be carried out in the solar-cell industry<br>
	and by means of which silicon surfaces can be etched selectively for the<br>
	production of emitters and for improving the antireflection behaviour. At<br>
5 	the same time, it is an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
	inexpensive etchant for carrying out the etching process.<br>
	The object is achieved, in particular, by an etching medium for the<br>
	etching of silicon surfaces and layers in the form of a thickened, alkaline<br>
10 	liquid, where the etching process ts carried out in the alkaline, solvent-<br>
	containing liquid.<br>
	The present object is therefore achieved by me provision of an inexpen-<br>
	sive etching paste which can be applied rapidly and selectively, for<br>
15 	example using a screen printer or a dispenser, to the areas to be etched<br>
	and thus significantly minimises firstly the consumption of etching<br>
	chemicals and secondly the loss of material on the solar cell<br>
	Besides the described opening of the p-n transition of a solar cell,<br>
20 	selective etching of silicon using an etching paste enables the produc-<br>
	tion of a selective (also two-stage) emitter in mass production and an<br>
	improvement in the antireflection behaviour of the solar cell.<br>
	The.present invention is thus distinguished from processes in which an<br>
25 	alkaline viscous salt solution is applied, for example, to ceramic parts<br>
	and dried (solvent evaporates), and the actual etching process is carried<br>
	out in the alkaline melt at 300-400°C [7].<br>
	The present invention is a printable and dispensable etching<br>
30 	medium in the form of an etching paste which comprises<br>
	a. at least one solvent<br>
	b. thickeners and<br>
	c. optionally additives, such as antifoams, thixotropic agents, flow-<br>
	control agents, deaerators and adhesion promoters,<br>
35 	and is effective at temperatures of from 70 to 150ºC and/or can, if<br>
	desired, be activated by the input of energy.<br><br>

	This etching medium comprises, as etching component, an organic<br>
	or inorganic base in a concentration of from 2 to 50% by weight,<br>
	preferably from 5 to 48% by weight, based on the total amount.<br>
5 	The etching component which can be employed is at least one<br>
	component selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide,<br>
	potassium hydroxide, ammonia, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine,<br>
	tetraalkylammonium hydroxide or one of the ethylene-<br>
	diamine/pyrocatechol and ethanolamine/gallic acid mixtures.<br>

	The present invention thus relates to etching media which comprise<br>
	a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, isopropanol,<br>
	diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, 1,2-<br>
	propanediof, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, glycerol, 1,5<br>
15 	pentanediol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol or mixtures thereof, or selected from<br>
	the group consisting of acetophenone, methyl-2-hexanone,<br>
	2-octanone,4-hydroxy-4-methy 1-2 - pentanone, 1 -methyl-2-pyrroIId-<br>
	one, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl<br>
	ether, triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol mono-<br>
20 	butyI ether, dipropyIene gIycol monomethyl ether, carboxylic acid<br>
	esters, such as [2,2-butoxy(ethoxy)]ethyl acetate, propylene<br>
	carbonate as such or in a mixture in an amount of from 10 to 90%<br>
	by weight, preferably in an amount of from 15 to 85% by weight,<br>
	based on the total amount of the medium.<br>
25<br>
	Etching media according to the invention furthermore comprise a<br>
	thickener selected from the group consisting of hydroxyalkylguar.<br>
	xanthan gum, cellulose and/or ethyl-, hydroxypropyl- or hydroxy-<br>
	ethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyI-<br>
30 hydroxyethylcellulose, homopolymers or copofymers based on<br>
	functionalised vinyl units of acrylic acid, acrylates and alkyl meth-<br>
	acrylates (C10-C30), individually or in a mixture in an amount of from<br>
	0.5 to 25% by weight, preferably from 1 to 10% by weight, based on<br>
	the total amount of the etching medium.<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2004/032218	PCT/EP2003/008805<br>
-6-<br>
	Besides these components, additives selected from the group<br>
	consisting of antifoams, thixotroptc agents, flow-control agents,<br>
	deaerators and adhesion promoters may be present in an amount<br>
	of from 0 to 2% by weight, based on the total amount.<br>
	5<br>
	The present Invention also relates to a process for the etching of<br>
	silicon surfaces and layers in which an etching medium according to<br>
	the invention is applied over the entire area or in accordance with<br>
	the etch structure mask specifically only to the areas of the surface<br>
10 	where etching is desired and is removed again after an exposure<br>
	time of from 30 s to 5 min.<br>
	In accordance with the invention, the etching medium acts at a<br>
	temperature in the range from 70 to 150°C, If necessary, activation<br>
15 	is carried out by the input of energy, preferably by means of IR<br>
	radiation.<br>
	In the process according to the invention, the etching medium is<br>
	applied to the surface to be etched by a screen, template, pad,<br>
20 	stamp, ink-jet or manual printing process or by a dispensing tech-<br>
	nique. After the exposure time and when the etching is complete,<br>
	the etching medium is rinsed off using a solvent or solvent mixture.<br>
	The etching media according to the invention can be used in<br>
25 photovoltaics, semiconductor technology, high-performance elec-<br>
	tronics, in particular for the production of photodiodes, circuits,<br>
	electronic components or for the etching of silicon surfaces and<br>
	layers for isolation of the p-n transition in solar cells. They can also<br>
	be used for the etching of silicon surfaces and layers for the pro-<br>
30 	duction of a selective emitter for solar cells, for the etching of sili-<br>
	con surfaces and layers of solar cells for improving the antireflec-<br>
	tion behaviour, for the etching of silicon surfaces and layers in a<br>
	process for the production of semiconductor components and cir-<br>
	cuits thereof, or for the etching of silicon surfaces and layers in a<br>
35 	process for the production of components in high-performance<br>
	electronics.<br><br>
WO 2004/032218	PCT/EP2003/008805<br>
-7-<br>
Object of the invention<br>
	The object of the invention is for semiconductor surfaces and layers, in<br>
	particular silicon surfaces and layers, to be etched over the entire area<br>
5 	or structured selectively using etching pastes, A technique with a high<br>
	degree of automation and high throughput which is suitable for transfer<br>
	of the etching paste to the area to be etched is printing and dispensing.<br>
	In particular, screen, template, pad, stamp and ink-jet printing<br>
	processes and the dispensing process are known to the person skilled<br>
10 	in the art. Manual application, for example by means of a<br>
	brush/application roller, is likewise possible.<br>
	Depending on the screen, template, klischee or stamp design or car-<br>
	tridge or metering unit control, it is possible to apply the etching pastes<br>
15 	described in accordance with the invention over the entire area or<br>
	selectively in accordance with the etch structure mask only to the areas<br>
	where etching is desired. All masking and lithography steps are super-<br>
	fluous in this case.<br>
20 	It is thus possible for structuring processes with complex masking or<br>
	processes such as laser structuring to be significantly shortened and<br>
	carried out less expensively or for processes which are susceptible to<br>
	technological faults, such as plasma etching, to be replaced by printing<br>
	and dispensing techniques. In addition, the etching process can be sig-<br>
25 	nificantly reduced with respect to the consumption of etching chemicals<br>
	since the etching paste is only applied to the areas to be etched.<br>
	In particular during isolation of the p-n transition in the production of sili-<br>
	con solar cells, the following advantages can be achieved through the<br>
30 	useofetching pastes:<br>
	• no need for expensive plasma-etching units<br>
	• reduction in the high celf breakage rates which occur<br>
	• minimisation of the high loss of material during mechanical separation<br>
35 	• avoidance of surface defects<br><br>
WO 2004/032218	PCT/EP2003/008805<br>
-8-<br>
	In the production of the selective emitter using etching pastes, it is like-<br>
	wise possible to dispense with oxide masking and expensive plasma<br>
	etching, in addition, selective application of the etching paste avoids<br>
	underetching of the contact areas. Since masking is not required, even<br>
5 	by screen-printed metal contact lines, etching damage to the contacts is<br>
	excluded.<br>
	It should also be noted that, in contrast to the photolithographic,<br>
	plasma-chemical and laser processes used hitherto, the production of a<br>
10 	selective emitter and the improvement in the antireflection behaviour<br>
	can be made significantly shorter and simpler with the etching paste<br>
	according to the invention. The wafers are uniformly n++-doped over the<br>
	entire surface. The areas between the contacts are etched away by the<br>
	etching paste, thus n+-doped and improved in their antireflection<br>
15	 behaviour. A plurality of process steps are thus saved.<br>
	The etching operation is preferably carried out with the input of energy,<br>
	for example in the form of heat radiation (IR lamp) or by means of a<br>
	hotplate. When etching is complete, the etching pastes are rinsed off<br>
20	 the etched surface using a suitable solvent or solvent mixture.<br>
	The etching duration can be between a few seconds and several min-<br>
	utes depending on the application, desired etching depth and/or edge<br>
	sharpness of the etch structures and the etching temperature set.<br>
25<br>
The etching pastes have the following composition:<br>
	• etching components<br>
	• solvents<br>
30 	• thickeners<br>
	• if desired additives, such as, for example, antifoams, thixotropic<br>
	agents, flow-control agents, deaerators and adhesion promoters<br>
	In order to etch semiconductor elements from main group 4 of the Peri-<br>
35 	odic Table, such as silicon, strong caustic lyes are used [7]. The etching<br><br>
WO2004/032218	PCT/EP2003/008805<br>
-9-<br>
	action of the etching pastes described in accordance with the invention<br>
	is therefore based on the use of alkaline, silicon-etching solutions.<br>
	Acidic etching pastes based on HF or fluoride - as described for oxides<br>
5 	[8], [9] - d° not exhibit an etching action on silicon.<br>
	The alkaline etching components used in the etching pastes described<br>
	in accordance with the invention can be aqueous solutions of inorganic<br>
	lyes, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia or<br>
10 	organic-based, alkaline etching mixtures, such as ethyJenediamine/<br>
	pyrocatechol, ethanolamine/gallic acid, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide<br>
	or combinations of the two.<br>
	The proportion of etching components employed is in a concentration<br>
15 	range 2 - 50% by weight, preferably 5 - 48% by weight, based on the<br>
	totaL weight of the etching paste. Particular preference is given to etch-<br>
	ing media in which the etching components are present in an amount of<br>
	10 - 45% by weight. Particularly suitable are etching media in which the<br>
	etching component(s) is (are) present in an amount of 30 - 40% by<br>
20 	weight, based on the total weight of the etching paste, since etching<br>
	rates which facilitate complete opening of the p-n transition and a high<br>
	throughput and at the same time show high selectivity have been found<br>
	for etching media of this type.<br>
25 	The etching components are effective in the etching pastes at 70-<br>
	150 °C. On silicon surfaces and layers, etching depths of less than 1 µm<br>
	have been achieved at temperatures below 100°C and etching depths<br>
	of up to 2-3 µm have been achieved at temperatures above 100°C.<br>
30 	Suitable inorganic and/or organic solvents and/or mixtures thereof may<br>
	be the following:<br>
	• water<br>
	• simple or polyhydric alcohols (for example isopropanol, diethylene<br>
35 	glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, 1,2-propanediol, 1,4-<br><br>
WO2004/032218	PCT/EP2003/008805<br>
-10-<br>
	butanediol, 1,3 -butanediol, glycerol, 1,5 pentanedioI, 2-ethyl-1-hexa -<br>
	nol) or mixtures thereof<br>
	•ketones (for example aceiophenone, methyI-2-hexanone,<br>
	2-octanone, 4-hydroxy-4- methyl-2- pentanone, 1 -methyI-2-5 pyrrolidone)<br>
	•ethers (for example ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glyool<br>
	monomethyl ether, triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene<br>
	glycol monobutyl ether, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether)<br>
	•carboxylic acid esters (for example [2,2-butoxy(ethoxy)]ethyl acetate)<br>
10 • 	esters of carbonic acid (for example propylene carbonate)<br>
	Preference is given to the use of water and solvents from the group<br>
	consisting of the ethers and ketones.<br>
15 	Water has proven particularly suitable.<br>
	The proportion of the solvents is in the range 10 - 90% by weight, pref-<br>
	erably 15 - 85% by weight, based on the total weight of the etching<br>
	paste. Particularly suitable compositions have proven to be those in<br>
20	 which solvents are present in an amount of 55 - 75% by weight, based<br>
	on the total weight of the etching paste.<br>
	The viscosity of the etching pastes described in accordance with the<br>
	invention is set by means of network-forming thickeners which swell in<br>
25 	the liquid phase and can be varied depending on the desired area of<br>
	application.<br>
	Possible thickeners are crosslinked and uncrosslinked homopolymers<br>
	and copolymers based on monomer units such as funciionalised vinyl<br>
30 	units, for example acrylic acid, acrylates, alkyl methacrylates (C1o-C30)<br>
	and hydroxyalkylguar, xanthan gum and β-glucosidically linked glucose<br>
	units, i.e. cellulose and/or cellulose derivatives, such as cellulose<br>
	ethers, in particular ethyl-, hydroxypropyl- or hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
	carboxymethylcellulose and salts of the glycolic acid ether of cellulose,<br>
35 inparticular sodium carboxymethylcellulose.The thickeners can be<br>
	employed individually and/or in combination with other thickeners. Pref-<br><br>
WO 2004/032218	PCT/EP2003/008805<br>
-11 -<br>
	erenee is given to the use of salts of carboxymethylcellulose and cross-<br>
	linked acrylic acid polymers as thickener. The sodium salt of carboxy-<br>
	methylcellulose (Finnfix®) and crosslinked acrylic acid homopolymers<br>
	(Carbomers®) have proven very particularly suitable for this purpose.<br>
5<br>
	The proportion of thickeners necessary for the specific setting of the<br>
	viscosity range and for the formation of a printable or dispensable paste<br>
	is in the range 0.5 - 25% by weight, preferably 1 - 10% by weight,<br>
	based on the total weight of the etching paste. Particularly suitable<br>
10 	compositions have proven to be those in which thickeners are present in<br>
	an amount of 1.5 - 6% by weight.<br>
	Additives having properties which are advantageous for the desired<br>
	purpose are antifoams, for example TEGO® Foamex N (dimethylpoly-<br>
15 	siloxane), thixotropic agents, for example BYK® 410 (modified urea),<br>
	Borchigel® Thixo2, flow-control agents, for example TEGO® Glide ZG<br>
	400 (polyether-siloxane copolymer), deaerators, for example TEGO®<br>
	Airex 986 (polymer with silicone tip), and adhesion promoters, for<br>
	example Bayowet® FT 929 (fluorosurfactant). These can positively<br>
20 	influence the printability and dispensability of the etching paste. The<br>
	proportion of the additives is in the range 0 - 2% by weight, based on<br>
	the total weight of the etching paste.<br>
	It has been found through experiments that both the choice of the com-<br>
25 	ponents employed for the preparation of the etching media and the<br>
	mixing ratio of the components to one another in the etching media is of<br>
	considerable importance. Depending on the manner in which the<br>
	etching media are applied to the area to be etched, the percentage ratio<br>
	of the components to one another should be set differently, since, inter<br>
30 	alia, the viscosity and flowability or the thixotropy being set are consid-<br>
	erably influenced by the amounts of solvent and thickener present- The<br>
	amounts of solvent and thickener present in turn influence the etching<br>
	behaviour. Depending on the type of use in the process according to the<br>
	invention, it is therefore possible for the person skilled in the art to<br>
35	 select a correspondingly adapted composition of the etching medium.<br><br>

Areas of application<br>
	Areas of application of the etching pastes according to the invention are<br>
	in the;<br>
5<br>
• solar-cell Industry<br>
• semiconductor industry<br>
• high-performance electronics<br>
10 	The etching pastes according to the invention can be employed in all<br>
	areas where full-area and/or structured etching of silicon surfaces or<br>
	layers is desired. Thus, individual structures can be etched over the full<br>
	area or selectively to the depth desired in each case in a silicon surface<br>
	or layer.<br>
15<br>
	Areas of application are, for example:<br>
	• all etching steps (synonymous with structuring steps), including sur-<br>
	face cleaning/roughening of silicon surfaces and layers, which result<br>
	20 in the production of optoelectrical components, such as solar cells,<br>
	photodiodes and the like, in particular isolation of the p-n transition in<br>
	silicon solar ceils and the partial removal of doped layers (selective<br>
	emitters)<br>
	• all etching steps on silicon surfaces and layers which result in the<br>
	25 production of semiconductor components and circuits<br>
	• all etching steps on silicon surfaces and layers which result in the<br>
	production of components in high-performance electronics (IGBTs,<br>
	power thyristors, GTOs, etc.).<br>
30 	For better understanding and for illustration of the invention, examples<br>
	are given below which fall within the scope of protection of the present<br>
	invention, but are not suitable for restricting the invention to these<br>
	examples.<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
5 	40.0 g of KOH<br>
	59.0 g of deionised water<br>
	1.5 g of ethylene gfycol monobutyl ether<br>
	4.0 g of Carbomer (acrylic acid homopolymer)<br>
10 	The chemicals were weighed into a beaker, mixed and dissolved, and<br>
	the thickener was added with stirring.<br>
	The mixture is transferred into containers after a short standing time.<br>
	This mixture gives an etching paste with which, for example, silicon<br>
15 	surfaces and layers can be etched specifically over the entire area or in<br>
	structures down to a desired depth with and/or without input of energy.<br>
	The etching paste was applied to the silicon surface, for example by<br>
	screen printing or using a dispenser (for example pin diameter of<br>
20 	260 µm), and etched on a hotplate for 3 min at 100°C. On production of<br>
	etch structures with a fine width of about 1 mm on an n-doped (100) sili-<br>
	con wafer, the etching depth determined (depending on the printing and<br>
	dispensing parameters) is 0.3 - 1 µm. The etching depth can be<br>
	increased by increasing the KOH concentration and the line width. For<br>
25 	line widths of 4 mm and KOH concentrations of 20 - 50% by weight, the<br>
	etching depths are 2 - 3 µn.<br>
	The resultant etching paste is stable on storage, easy to handle and<br>
	printable- It can be removed from the printed surface or layer or from the<br>
30 	paste carrier (screen, doctor blade, template, stamp, klischee, cartridge,<br>
	etc.) using a solvent, for example using water<br>
