				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MOTION ESTIMATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for performing motion estimation, and more particularly relates to a method and apparatus for extremely detailed motion estimation which, for an estimation of motion vector(s) at scale of finer resolution, uses error values generated ar an estimation of motion for determining a motion vector, at a scale of lower resolution especially differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) method for coding a digital image signal,<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Generally, there are several coding methods for further efficiently compressing transmission data in an image signal processing apparatus using subsequent digital image signals, such as high definition television<br>
(HDTV),   Digital   VTR   (digital  video   tape  recorder),   and  multi-media,  etc.<br>
. The  DPCM  method  codes  the digital  image  signal  using  data  correlations<br>
which are present between adjacent frames of the image signal.<br>
In the case of coding a difference signal between adjacent frames representing different times using the DPCM method, it is disadvantageous that much more data needs to be coded for ah active image rather than a still image. However, by recognizing a movement location from a certain segment of an adjacent frame to a specific segment in the present frame, that is, the best similarity between a specific image of the present frame and a certain image of the adjacent frame, efficient data compression can be<br>
performed because signal difference values of similar segments between frames can be minimized after motion compensation. Accordingly, in the motion-compensated DPCM method, difference data between a predetermined image segment of the present frame and the corresponding image segment of the adjacent frame is coded, thereby permitting efficiency of the transmission to be enhanced. In the motion estimation method, a motion vector represents a moving direction and magnitude of the image segment obtained by comparing an image segment of the present frame with the corresponding image segment of an adjacent frame.<br>
There are several methods for generating motion estimates in terms of a pixel unit. Generally, since motion between two frames separated in time may be small with respect to an integer-pixel unit, errors may be introduced during motion compensation when using the motion vector of an integer-pixel unit. Therefore, a motion vector of a sub-pixel unit is used for reducing motion compensation errors. A half-pixel unit, as one estimation method of sub-pixel units, is commonly used for the motion estimation. A motion estimation method using a half-pixel unit in a accordance with a conventional method will be briefly described.<br>
The apparatus of FIG. 1 comprises image segment constructor 1 for receiving an image signal of the present frame and constructing an image segment composed of a plurality of pixels; search range constructor 2. for receiving the image signal of an adjacent frame and constructing the image segment composed of a plurality of pixels; a first search unit 3 for receiving the image signals output from the image segment constructor. 1 and the search range constructor 2 and detecting a first motion vector MV1<br>
of a pixel unit; a half-pixel interpolating unit 4 for receiving image signals output from the search range constructor 2 and the first search unit 3 and calculating image signal values in half-pixel locations around reference pixels, using the image segment, which will be referred to as a reference segment, within the adjacent frame which is determined by the first motion vector MV1 detected from the first search unit 3 and its surrounding pixels; a second search unit 5 for receiving the image signals output from the image segment constructor 1 and the half-pixel interpolating unit 4 and outputting a second motion vector MV2 of a half-pixel unit; and a summing unit 6 for receiving and summing the output signals MV1, MV2 from the first search unit 3 and the second search unit 5, respectively, and outputting" a motion vector MV.<br>
The image segment constructor 1 receives the image signal of the present frame and stores the input signal in segments. Simultaneous with inputting the image signal of the present frame, the search range constructor 2 receives the image signal from an adjacent frame and constructs a search range segment. The first search unit 3 searches for a segment within the search range segment which best matches the segment in the present from. By comparing data in a pixel unit between two segments the first motion vector MVI of an integer pixel unit generated from the first search unit 3 is output to the summing unit 6 and the half-pixel interpolating unit 4. The half-pixel interpolating unit 4 linearly, interpolates out the reference pixels of a designated segment within the adjacent frame using the first motion vector MV1 of an integer-pixel unit and the surrounding pixels, and then outputs the calculated values to' the<br>
second search unit 5.<br>
In the above conventional system, the image segment may be a N1x N2 block type composed of N1XN2 pixels. Additionally, the search range may be composed on M1XM2 pixels. Alternately, the image segments and the search range may be constructed in accordance with the shape and size of of the objects within the image. Furthermore, in the case of a uni-directional prediction which requires one adjacent frame for reference as in P-frame in MPEG or in B-frame that involves only backward prediction, the image segment of the present frame is compared with an image segment within the search range constructed either within the previous or future frame. However the motion estimation previously mentioned is also applicable to the bi-directional prediction which involves both previous, and future frames. In the case of a bi-directional predictions as in B-frame' 'in MPEG, the image segment of the present frame is compared with an image segments within the search ranges constructed within the previous frame and the future frame.<br>
Another conventional method for constructing the image segment and the search range is accomplished in accordance with the objects within the image. Thus, constructed image segment and the search range segment may be if any size and shape.<br>
In FIG. 2, "O" illustrates pixel unit intervals and "x" indicates half-pixel unit intervals. The second unit 5 moves the image segment of an adjacent frame corresponding to the first motion vector MV1 of an integer-pixel unit to every direction in half-pixel units, respectively, searches for a location having a minimum motion compensation error among<br>
.locations x for the obtained eight half-pixel motion vectors and the first motion vector MV1, and outputs one of vector components (-1/2, 0, 1/2), that is, a minutely controlled value in a half-pixel unit. The summing unit 6 sums the first motion vector MV1 in integer-pixel units output from the first search unit 3 and the second motion vector MV2 in half-pixel units from the second search unit 5, to thereby generate a complete motion vector MV for the motion estimation. For example, the summing unit 6 sums the horizontal component (-1/2) of the second motion vector MV2 of a half-pixel unit from the second search unit 5 with the motion vector (MVl = (x, y)) of a pixel unit from the first search unit 3, and the determines the motion vector (MV=(x-l/2, y)).<br>
In case of bi-directional motion-estimation, which involves previous and future adjacent frames, the same procedure is applied to both' of forward and backward predictions.<br>
The above-described conventional method determines the location of segment using the motion vector of a pixel interval unit, linearly interpolates out corresponding pixel values at half-pixel locations using the determined segment and surrounding pixels of the segment. The method uses the interpolated half-pixel values and the segment pixel values of the present frame determined by the motion vector in integer-pixel units, and selects the most similar segment among eight half-pixel motion positions, that is, "x" of FIG. 2. Accordingly, the conventional method has a drawback in that it takes too long in processing data for estimating the motion vector in half-pixel units. This drawback is not confined to the case of motion vector estimation at half-pixel unit, but a general problem<br>
for a motion vector estimation at a resolution finer than a pixel unit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Description is now made for a case in which a first motion vector selected at any scale and a second motion vector at. a finer scale are selected to he pixel unit resolution and half-pixel unit respectively. This example however, can be applied to any other selected scales.<br>
A motion vector of a predetermined segment in a present frame corresponding to a segment in an adjacent frame is represented as MV = (x, y). Here, the motion vector MV has a horizontal component of motion vector x and a vertical component of motion vector y.<br>
FIG. 3A is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for motion estimation in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The apparatus of FIG. 3A comprises image segment constructor 31 for receiving an image signal of the present frame and constructing image segments composed of a plurality of pixels; search range constructor 32 for receiving the image signal of an adjacent frame and constructing image segments composed of a plurality of pixels; search unit for receiving the image signals output from the image segment constructor 31 and the search range constructor 32, for detecting a first motion vector MV1 in pixel units by comparing image signals between image segments within the segment constructed by the search range constructor 32 and the image segment in the present frame, and outputting error values corresponding to an image segment pointed by the detected MV1, which will be called as a reference segment and in generated by moving the reference segment to horizontal<br>
and vertical directions by one pixel; half-pixel control means  34' for receiving the errors output from the search unit 33 and calculating a second motion vector MV2 in respective half-pixel interval vertically and horizontally; and summing unit 37 receiving the first motion vector MV1 from the search unit 33 and the second motion vector MV2 from the half-pixel control means 34, summing the respective vectors and outputting a resultant motion vector MV.<br>
The half-pixel control means 34 includes a horizontal half-pixel controller 35 for detecting a horizontal component of the second motion vector MV2 and vertical half-pixel controller 36 for detecting a vertical component of the second motion vector MV2.<br>
Of the image signals for two adjacent frames separated in time,, the image segment constructor 31 receives the image signal of the present frame and stores the input signal in a first segment. Simultaneously with inputting the image signal of the present frame, the search range constructor 32 receives the image signal of an adjacent frame and stores it in a second segment, which advantageously may be larger than the first segment. 'Hie search unit 33 receives respectively the image signals of the stored second segment and the first segment output from the search range constructor 32 and the image segment constructor 31, respectively. In the case of a P-frame, the comparison is made between the present frame and a previous frame; however, in the case of a B-frame the comparison is made between the present frame and a future frame in addition to the comparison between the present frame and a previous frame. Thus, in the case of a B-frame, the search range constructor 32 constructs a second<br>
segment of a previous frame and a third segment of a future frame. Accordingly, the comparison between the present frame and the previous frame and then between present frame and future frame or vice versa or the comparisons may occur simultaneously as shown in FIG. 3B.<br>
The following is a description in which the first segment and the second segment has the form Ni x N2 pixels and Mi x M2 respectively. Furthermore', for the simplicity of explanation, an integer-pixel unit' is selected as one scale of resolution and a half-pixel unit is selected as the finer scale of resolution. Note that the present invention can be applied to the cases with other selected scale resolutions as well.<br>
A motion estimation error obtained by estimating the motion vector of an integer-pixel unit is represented by Po, Motion estimation errors which are generated by moving in horizontal and vertical direction by one pixel, respectively, on the basis of the estimated motion vector, are respectively P 1', P-1, P-1, and P-1. Mean absolute error MAE, or mean squared error MSE advantageously can be used for calculating motion estimation errors. Equations which preferably can be used to calculate the horizontal motion estimation errors (Po, P-1, P-1) by the MAE are as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Where   Y   represents   the   image   signal   of   the   present   frame,    Y'<br>
represents that of the adjacent frame, and Ni=N-2=N represent segment1 size In the above equations, (k, /) represents position from the top lelt position of the frames. It will be appreciated that the vertical motion estimation errors (P1', P-D can be calculated by the same method as noted by the above listed equation.<br>
The search unit 33 compares, in pixel units, the data magnitude between the image segment of the present frame and a plurality of adjacent image segments, which are present within the search range of the adjacent frame and have similar sizes, and calculates motion estimation errors as a result of respective comparisons. The first motion vector MV1, in integer-pixel units is determined as a segment location where the motion estimation error is a minimum, and is output to the summing unit 37, The search unit 33 outputs to the half pixel control unit 34 the motion estimation errors (P1, P1, Po, P1', P1') corresponding to the reference image segment within an adjacent frame determined by the motion vector MVI in integer-pixel units and a number of image segments surrounding the reference image segment and shifted by one pixel. Advantageously, the present invention simultaneously and individually determines the horizontal and vertical components of motion vector in half-pixel units. However, since the horizontal half-pixel controller 311 find the vertical half-pixel controller 36 use the same methodology, description will be limited to a method for determining the horizontal component of a motion vector in half-pixel units.<br>
In the case of the uni-directional motion prediction, a single set of motion estimation errors (P1, P1 Po, P 1', P1') resulting from comparison of the present frame and adjacent frame is output from the search unit 33 to<br>
the half-pixel control means 84 as described above! however, the same argument can be made to the bi-directional motion prediction as in B-frame, two sets of motion errors, one set resulting from comparison of the frame and a previous frame and another set resulting from of the present frame and a future frame, are output from search unit 33 to the half-pixel control unit 34.<br>
FIG. 3B is similar to FIG. 3A except that two adjacent frames are, simultaneously input to the system. In the case of a B-frame, a future frame and a previous frame are simultaneously input to the system.<br>
FIG. 4 is a detailed block diagram illustrating the horizontal half-pixel controller of FIGs. 3A and 313.<br>
The device of FIG. 4 includes three input terminals 41,, 42, 4$ ,IoF receiving the motion estimation errors (P1, Po, P1); a first adder Al for adding and outputting the input signal Pi of a first input terminal 41 and the input signal Po of a second input terminal 42; a second adder A2 for adding and outputting the input signal Po of the second input terminal 42 and the input signal P-1 of a third input terminal 43; a first comparator CMP1, having a predetermined input terminal coupled to an output terminal of the first adder Al, for comparing respective input signals; a second comparator CMP2, having a predetermined input terminal coupled to an output terminal of the second adder A2, for comparing respective input signals; a second multiplier M2 for multiplying the output signal of the first adder Al by a predetermined coefficient and outputting a multiplied value to the second comparator CMP2; a first multiplier Ml for multiplying the output signal of the second adder A2 by a predetermined coefficient and<br>
outputting a multiplied value to the first comparator CMPl; and a NOR,  gate NOR for performing a logical NOT OR function or respective output signals from the comparators CMPl, CMP2. The device further comprises three output terminals 44, 45, 46 to distinguish each of the output signals from first comparator CMPl, NOR gate NOR and second comparator CMP2.<br>
The motion estimation errors (P1, Po, P 1,) output from the search unit 83 are input to the horizontal half-pixel controller 35 of the half-pixel control means 31. Then, the first adder Al subtracts the signal pD input through the second terminal 42 input from the input signal P1 through the input first terminal 41. The second adder A2 subtracts the signal Po input through the second input terminal 42 from the signal P1 input through the third input terminal 43. The first and second multipliers Ml, M2 multiply by respective predetermined coefficient each of the adder output signals and output the multiplied result to the comparators CMPl, CMP2, connected to the output of the multipliers, respectively, Advantageously, a difference value (a) between Po and P1 and (b) between Po and IV are respectively input to the second comparator CMP2 and the first comparator CMPl. Preferably, the first comparator CMPl compares and outputs the output signals from the first adder Al and the first multiplier Ml. The second comparator CIY1P2 compares and outputs the output signals from the second adder A2 and the second multiplier M2.<br>
FIGs. 5(a) and 5(b) are conceptual diagrams showing a method for determining motion vectors in half-pixel units in the horizontal half-pixel controller 35. FIG. 5(a) shows that the motion vector MV2 of a half-pixel<br><br>
unit is present at the left with respect to the motion vector MV1 of a pixel<br>
unit, and FIG. 5(b) shows that the motion vector MV of a half-pixel unit is present at the right with the motion vector MV1 of a pixel unit.<br>
In FIG. 5(a), when P1 is larger the P1 (that is, b is larger than a) indicates that the motion vector MV is located about 1/2 the distance from the first motion vector MVI in pixel units to the left. In FIG. 5(b), when Pi is larger than Pi on the basis of Po (that is, a is larger than b) indicates that the motion vector MV is located about 1/2 way from the first motion vector MVI, in pixel units to the right.<br>
In FIG. 5(a), for the case where P1 is larger than P1 on the basis of Po, only the output 44 of the first comparator CMPI is "high". Thus, the horizontal half-pixel controller 35 outputs "-1/2", as the horizontal component value of the second motion vector MV2. In FIG. 5(b), for the case where P i is larger than Pi on the basis of Po, only UK; output 46 of the second comparator CMP2 is "high". Thus, the horizontal half-pixel controller 35 outputs "1/2" as the horizontal component value of the second motion vector MV2. Where PI and PI, on the basis of Po, are equal to each other, the output signals of the two comparators CMPl, CMP2' are both "low". Therefore, the NOR gate NOR receives low values and its output signal becomes "high". Accordingly, the horizontal component of the second motion vector MV2 becomes "0".<br>
The summing unit 37 receives the second motion vector MV2 and adds it to the first motion vector MVI, in pixel units, obtained by the search unit 33, thereby estimating the second motion vector M.V2 in half pixel units.<br>
It will  be  appreciated that a  method  that  a method  and  an  apparatus<br>
for motion estimation in accordance with the present invention compares image signals of segments within an adjacent frame witli the selected segment in a present frame to detect a motion vector at a selected scale of resolution; generates error values calculated in the detection of the motion vectors according to the selected motion vector.<br>
By vertically comparing the generated error values, a vertical component of the motion vector in the finer scale of resolution is detected. By horizontally comparing the generated error values, a horizontal component of the motion vector in the finer scale of resolution is detected. Accordingly, the present invention leads to a greater efficiency in motion estimation by reducing the amount of data which must be processed for the detection of the motion vector in a finer scale of resolution.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with the image segment and the search range having a particular form, the image segment and the search range may be of any shape or size such as in the case for which the image segment and the search range is constructed in accordance with the shapes and sizes of the objects. Furthermore, the comparison of a segment from the present frame may be made with immediately previous frame or immediately future frame as well as previous or future frames separated from the present frame by more than one frame in time. Furthermore, the comparison may be made to any combination of above mentioned frames such as B-frame used in the MPEG systems in which more than one adjacent frame are compared.<br>
While only certain embodiments of the invention have been specifically described herein, it will apparent that numerous modifications may be made<br>
