NOVEL TIMED-RELEASE    MULTICAROTENOID COMPOSITION AND A PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION.<br>
OMNIACTIVES HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES PVT LTD., an Indian Company , registered under the Indian company'sActl957having its registered office located at   Rajan House . Appasaheb Marathe Marg, Prabhadevi, Maharashtra , India 400025<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention<br>
 <br>
 <br>
INTRODUCTION:<br>
The present invention relates to novel timed-release multicarotenoid composition and a process for its preparation . More particularly, the present invention relates to novel timed-release composition of multi carotenoids such as lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene and betacarotene and process for its preparation . The novel timed-release multicarotenoid composition of the present invention is useful for formulating compressed tablets, two-piece gelatin or vegetarian capsules. More particularly, the novel timed-release system for mixed carotenoids is useful as powerful antioxidant combination that promotes eye, prostrate, and skin health.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Carotenoids are yellow, red and orange pigments which are widely distributed in nature Although specific carotenoids have been identified in various fruits and vegetables, bird feathers, egg-yolk, poultry skin, crustaceans and macular eye region, they are especially abundant in marigold petals, corn and leafy vegetables. The correlation between dietary carotenoids and carotenoids found in human serum and plasma indicate that only selected groups of carotenoids make their way into the human blood stream to exert their effect.<br>
Carotenoids absorb light in the 400-500 nm region of the visible spectrum. This physical<br>
property imparts the characteristic yellow/red color to the pigments. Carotenoids contain<br>
a conjugated backbone composed of isoprene units, which are usually inverted at the<br>
center of the molecule, imparting symmetry. Changes in geometrical configuration about<br>
the double bonds result in the existence of many cis- and trans-isomers. Mammalian<br>
species do not synthesize carotenoids and therefore these have to be obtained from<br>
dietary sources such as fruits vegetables and egg yolks. In the recent years, carotenoids<br>
have been attributed several health benefits, which include prevention and or protection<br>
against serious health disorders.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Carotenoids are non-polar compounds classified into two sub-classes, namely more polar compounds called xanthophylls or oxy-carotenoids and non-polar hydrocarbon carotenes like .beta.-carotene, lycopene, etc. Both the sub-classes have at least nine conjugated double bonds responsible for the characteristic colors of the carotenoids. Xanthophylls have ring structures at the end of the conjugated double bond chain with polar functions like hydroxyl or keto group. The examples for xanthophylls include lutein, zeaxanthin, capsanthin, canthaxanthin, .beta.-cryptoxanthin, astaxanthin, etc. As natural colorants and also for their role in human health, xanthophylls containing lutein and zeaxanthin have attracted the renewed attention of scientists and researchers in the biomedical, chemical and nutritional field in recent years.<br>
Individually, each carotenoid has been shown to provide specific health benefit. For example, lutein and zeaxanthin promote eye health. Beta carotene, being a precursor of Vitamin A, corrects the deficiency of the vitamin A, lycopene promotes prostrate health. There have been attempts to combine these useful carotenoids to have synergistic effect on health benefits.<br>
US patent no. 7,090,879 provides a infant formula containing a mixture of lutein, lycopene, and beta carotene in blend of proteins, lipids and carbohydrate. The main drawback of this invention is that all the carotenoids are released together in the body, wherein the carotenoids interact with each other and affect their complete absorption.<br>
US patent nos. 7056525, 6509029, and 6261598 describe preparation of different formulations of lutein, lycopene and beta carotene, such as emulsion, solubilizate, dry powder and oil suspension. The main disadvantage of such compositions is that all the three carotenoids are released together in the gastrointestinal tract, where they interact with each other and affect their absorption.<br>
US Patent application no.20070082044 teaches us about the synergistic effect of combination of lutein with lycopene and beta carotene. However, the disadvantage of<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
such combination is that the interaction among the carotenoids that renders them less bioavailable.<br>
While technologies exist in the pharmaceutical and nutritional industries for providing combination of the carotenoid preparations, there are no techniques available for the prevention of interaction amongst the carotenoids such as lutein, lycopene and betacarotene that drastically affects the absorption of the carotenoids individually. No e prior art references deal with simple admixture of the carotenoids such as lutein, lycopene and beta carotene and delivering them either as emulsions or oil suspensions or powders. When such products are ingested, they compete with each other for micellization, a critical step prior to absorption. For example since beta carotene is absorbed faster, it reduces the absorption of lutein by 40%. Similarly, the absorption of lycopene is affected in the presence of beta carotene and lutein. Such is the position in other carotenoids<br>
Carotenoids are important natural products that are useful to the body in promoting eye health, prostrate health and prevention of free radicle damage. When administered individually, these carotenoids are absorbed adequately to provide the health benefits. However, when these carotenoids are administered together in combination, one of them such as beta carotene is absorbed well, whereas other two carotenoids such as lutein and lycopene as not absorbed completely. The carotenoids compete with each other during micellization with the limited quantity of bile salts available in the intestine.<br>
Carotenoids undergo a step of micellization before getting in to enterocytes during absorption. The critical step of micellization requires bile salts as an essential component. Since the concentration of bile salts is limited, those carotenoids which have higher affinity for micellization, will form micelles and get absorbed. Whereas the remaining carotenoids will be absorbed to the extent bile salts available in the intestine. The situation is similar when a high dose of any one of the carotenoid is administered. The absorption takes place to the extent of bile salts available in the intestine.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION :<br>
Therefore, the main objective of the present invention is to provide novel timed-release multi carotenoid composition in which the individual carotenoid is released at different time intervals, such that they do not compete with each other<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide novel timed-release multi carotenoid composition comprising lutein, lycopene and beta carotene , in which the individual carotenoid is released at different time intervals, such that they do not compete with each other<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide novel timed-release multi carotenoid composition in beadlet form which can be further formulated as compressed tablets or as capsules.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide novel timed-release carotenoid composition in beadlet form wherein the release of individual carotenoid is such that there is no interaction of the individual carotenoid in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel timed-release multi carotenoid composition in which the individual carotenoid is released at different time intervals, such that they do not compete with each other<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel timed-release multi carotenoid composition comprising lutein, lycopene and beta carotene , in which the individual carotenoid is released at different time intervals, such that they do not compete with each other<br>
The term " timed-release" used refers to a composition in which is the individual carotenoid is released at a specific time interval in the gastrointestinal tract. For example,<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
the multicarotenoid composition of the present invention releases its bioactives only after 2 hrs. Hence it is referred to as a timed release composition .<br>
