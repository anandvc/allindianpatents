FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an organic mineral complex of calcium and magnesium<br>
and process for its production and more particularly relates to a novel chelate complex<br>
of calcium magnesium lactate gluconate, process for its production and nutrient<br>
compositions comprising it.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Calcium and magnesium deficiency continues to be a common nutritional problem at<br>
the present time. Calcium deficiency is a major problem in all countries and almost all<br>
segments of population throughout life time. It is particularly prevalent in infants, child<br>
bearing women, and post-menopausal women. Majority of the body's calcium (99%) is<br>
found in the skeletal system and a small amount(l%) circulates in bloodstream where it<br>
is vital to biochemistry.<br>
Mild calcium deficiency causes nerve sensitivity, muscle twitching, irritability,<br>
palpitations and insomnia. Children can suffer from rickets, bone deformities and<br>
growth retardation. In adults, deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, muscle weakness,<br>
osteoporosis and delayed fractures. Osteoporosis, a degenerative bone disease, is<br>
recognized as a major public health problem, results in a significant burden to the<br>
population in terms of quality of life and medical expense. Dietary calcium deficiency<br>
has been determined by medical authorities to be an important risk factor for<br>
osteoporosis. The need for calcium in our daily diet has been extensively documented in<br>
medical and scientific journals. In addition, many government and public health<br>
agencies have recommended that individuals strive to include optimal amounts of<br>
calcium in their diet to reduce risk for osteoporosis.<br><br>
Several strategies have been proposed to reduce the prevalence of calcium deficiency.<br>
Although calcium supplements are effective, logistics and compliance are major problems. In<br>
addition, the prevalence of calcium deficiency is not usually high enough to justify the use of<br>
medicinal calcium. Current scientific research shows evidence that calcium plays a role in<br>
protecting against high blood pressure and colon cancer. If there are inadequate amounts of<br>
calcium from dietary sources, skeletal calcium will be sacrificed to satisfy the metabolic<br>
needs of the soft tissues. Thus, when dietary calcium intake is inadequate, skeletal<br>
metabolism is compromised. Under this circumstance, less bone is accumulated during<br>
growth and calcium is withdrawn from the adult skeleton with a concomitant reduction of<br>
bone strength. Both of these situations appear to predispose a person to osteoporosis and its<br>
consequent fractures. One of the major sources of available calcium for dietary purposes are<br>
dairy products. Since fluid milk provides about 300 milligrams calcium per 240 milliliter (8<br>
ounce) serving, the consumption of approximately of a liter of milk would be necessary to<br>
provide the present minimum recommended amounts of calcium (based on the USA<br>
recommended daily allowance (R.D.A)). Moreover calcium utilization is affected in absence<br>
of Magnesium. Adequate amounts of magnesium are required for the absorption and<br>
utilization of calcium, favoring the deposition of calcium in bones where it belongs and<br>
preventing deposition of calcium in the soft tissues and kidneys where it does not belong.<br>
Without magnesium, high doses of calcium will lead to calcification of soft tissues, kidney<br>
stone formation, and decreased bone strength. Further, magnesium is required in adequate<br>
amounts for the normal activity of 300 enzymes, including those involved in the transfer of<br>
energy from foods to physical and mental activities.<br>
Early signs of magnesium deficiency include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue,<br>
and weakness. As magnesium deficiency worsens, numbness, tingling, muscle<br>
contractions and cramps, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and<br>
coronary spasms can occur . Severe magnesium deficiency can result in low levels of<br><br><br>
calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). Magnesium deficiency is also associated with low<br>
levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) . Magnesium levels should be one half<br>
of calcium or calcium will not deposit properly and much will be lost. But taking more<br>
calcium is not the answer; it only amplifies the problem. In fact, excessive calcium<br>
intake and insufficient magnesium can contribute to both of the aforesaid diseases.<br>
Magnesium taken in proper dosages can solve the problem of calcium deficiency.<br>
When calcium level is elevated in the blood it stimulates the secretion of a hormone<br>
called calcitonin and suppresses the secretion of the parathyroid hormone (PTH). These<br>
hormones regulate the levels of calcium in our bones and soft tissues and are, therefore,<br>
directly related to both osteoporosis and arthritis. PTH draws calcium out of the bones<br>
and deposits it in the soft tissues, while calcitonin increases calcium in our bones and<br>
keeps it from being absorbed in our soft tissues. Sufficient amounts of magnesium<br>
determine this delicate and important balance.<br>
As magnesium suppresses PTH and stimulates calcitonin it helps put calcium into our<br>
bones, preventing osteoporosis, and helps remove it from our soft tissues eliminating<br>
some forms of arthritis. A magnesium deficiency will prevent this chemical action from<br>
taking place in our bodies, and no amount of calcium can correct it. While magnesium<br>
helps our body absorb and retain calcium, too much calcium prevents magnesium from<br>
being absorbed. So taking large amounts of calcium without adequate magnesium may<br>
either create malabsorption or a magnesium deficiency whichever occurs, only<br>
magnesium can break the cycle.<br>
Stomach acid is required to convert inorganic calcium (carbonate, phosphate, oyster shell,<br>
coral or bone meal) into a soluble, ionized state so it can be absorbed in the small intestine.<br><br><br>
Organic forms of calcium (gluconate, lactates) are already in a soluble, ionized state and dc<br>
not require stomach acid. Scientists are in agreement that bioavailability of inorganic<br>
minerals may be as low as 20%, but does not exceed to 30%.<br>
Supplement manufacturers increase the dosage of inorganic minerals hoping to offset<br>
this process and increase the mineral percentage uptake. However, the increase in<br>
inorganic mineral content only leads to an increase of gelatinous magma, which lines<br>
the mucous membrane of the small intestine. This lining blocks absorption of all<br>
minerals and vitamins, causing gastrointestinal (GI) distress such as diarrhoea and<br>
constipation. Active transport sites are located at the beginning of the small intestine.<br>
They require the presence of adequate amounts of vitamin D and are limited to between<br>
225 and 450 mg of calcium absorption at any one time. Therefore, when calcium<br>
consumption is low, this site can account for a substantial part of absorbed calcium,<br>
however, when calcium intake is high, this site plays only a minor role.<br>
Passive diffusion sites are located throughout the alkaline environment of the small<br>
intestine particularly at the end of the small intestine where the pH is highest. These<br>
sites allow much greater calcium absorption as the absorption rate stays the same<br>
regardless of dosage. They do not rely on stomach acid levels, vitamin D intake, age,<br>
gender or hormone status and are limited only by intestinal transit time. The absorption<br>
rate of calcium at these sites is 48%; however only soluble forms of calcium such as<br>
gluconate and lactate, can take advantage of passive diffusion sites as they are able to<br>
stay dissolved in this alkaline environment. Only those minerals that are dissolved can<br>
move through the passive diffusion sites.<br><br><br>
Though, a composition with magnesium and calcium is the best choice to maximize<br>
calcium utilization, calcium-fortification with insoluble calcium salts have resulted in<br>
products that have low calcium concentrations, suspension settlement issues, require<br>
exceptionally long processing times, have unacceptable off flavors that are described as<br>
bitter, metallic, chalky, and "minerally", poor textures or a combination of these<br>
drawbacks. For example, insoluble calcium salts need to be added to products as a<br>
suspension, but this often leads to negative changes in taste and texture as well as<br>
suspension settlement. In addition, insoluble calcium sources are generally less<br>
bioavailable than soluble forms. Although some inorganic salts of calcium, such as<br>
calcium salts of bicarbonate, chloride, sulfate and some phosphates, possess a solubility<br>
which allows relatively high levels of calcium to be added to beverages, they produce<br>
unacceptable off tastes. While attempts have been made to cover up the off flavors or<br>
poor textures of previous calcium fortified beverages, such efforts have required the<br>
addition of materials such as sugars, artificial sweeteners, and flavorings. This results in<br>
the addition of calories and/or other (off) flavors. Therefore supplements of calcium and<br>
magnesium presently known in the patent and non-patent literature are not very suitable<br>
in view of the drawbacks as mentioned above.<br>
The higher the elemental weight of calcium in a compound, the less soluble the calcium<br>
is. Calcium magnesium lactate gluconate with the low elemental weights have the high<br>
solubility, which allows for absorption at all three sites along the digestive tract.<br>
Any calcium from the undissolved portion of the supplement will be eliminated via the<br>
colon, possibly causing constipation, gas, and bloating. A liquid solution is highly<br>
soluble and does not need to be broken down, providing approximately 98% of its<br>
elemental calcium. Liquid solutions can use much lower doses then solid supplements<br>
while still providing as much or more utilizable calcium but without the waste. A<br>
solution means the minerals are dissolved in the liquid, which is what gives it its<br>
enhanced absorption.<br><br><br>
Many Salts and complexes of calcium and magnesium have been disclosed as mineral<br>
supplements and some of them are described below:<br>
Certain forms of calcium citrate-malate are disclosed for use as mineral supplements,<br>
including beverages; for example Japanese Application No. Sho 54-173172, date of<br>
application 28 Dec. 1979, laid-open No. Sho 56-97248, 5 Aug., 1981; and see also French<br>
Pat. No. 2,219,778 (Application No.73.08643).<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 2,325,360, to Ayres et al, issued July 27, 1943, discloses a method for<br>
replacing gases removed during deaeration of fruit juices, such as orange juice, with<br>
carbon dioxide. In this method, dry calcium carbonate, or a mixture of calcium<br>
carbonate and citric acid, is dropped into a can, which is then filled with deaerated<br>
orange juice. (Other organic acids such as malic and tartaric acid can be used in place of<br>
citric acid.)<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,657,424, to Akins et al, issued Apr. 18, 1972, discloses the fortification<br>
of citrus juices, including orange juice, with sodium, calcium and chloride ions in<br>
amounts beyond what is naturally present in the juice. Calcium salts which can be used<br>
in fortification include the chlorides, citrates or phosphates, although calcium chloride is<br>
preferred for providing the desired chloride ion.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,114,641, to Sperti et al, issued Dec. 17, 1963, discloses extended orange<br>
juice products obtained by diluting single-strength orange juice or concentrated orange<br>
juice. To maintain the flavor of the diluted orange juice product, materials such as<br>
calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium or potassium citrates, tartaric and malic<br>
acids (or their salts) are included.<br><br><br>
British patent specification No. 2,095,530, published Oct. 6, 1982, discloses a process<br>
for obtaining an acid beverage enriched in protein, particularly a fruit juice or fruit-<br>
flavored beverage. In this process, an aqueous suspension of soy protein is prepared<br>
using water and/or fruit juice. Calcium in a concentration of from 5 to 50 mM is added,<br>
after which the pH of the suspension is reduced and the insoluble material separated to<br>
yield a protein solution. A fruit juice or fruit flavoring can then be added to this protein<br>
solution . The calcium can be added in the form of the chloride, acetate, tartrate, malate<br>
or lactate salt.<br>
European patent application No. 75,114, published Mar. 30, 1983, discloses protein-<br>
containing fruit juice drinks enriched with vitamins and minerals. These drinks contain<br>
30-90% fruit juice (a mixture of 20-70% apple juice, 4-40% white grape juice, 1-10%<br>
passionfruit juice and 5-25% lemon juice), 2 to 20% whey protein concentrate, and a<br>
mineral salt mixture of potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and phosphate.<br>
Calcium is present in these drinks at 0.01 to 0.3%, preferably at 0.02 to 0.03%.<br>
US published patent application No. 2005/0158425A1 discloses use of a<br>
calcium(lactate) gluconate citrate as dietary calcium supplement in thin mouthfeel<br>
calcium-fortified beverages.<br>
US published patent application No. 2005/0153021A1 discloses use of a calcium<br>
(lactate) gluconate citrate in calcium-fortified protein based-beverage.<br>
US patent 6,261,610 to Sher et al. discloses a metastable calcium Lactate-Citrate or<br>
Calcium-MagnesiumLactate-Citrate complex , their preparation and use in fortified<br>
liquid food beverage product. But this describes only the in-situ preparation of the<br>
complex and the complex is not isolated, thus the application is restricted.<br><br><br>
The intestine prefers to absorb the most soluble form of calcium and magnesium. There<br>
was a long felt need to have a supplement which is organic, enriched with both<br>
calcium and magnesium having high solubility and where the organic magnesium<br>
helps in calcium deposition.<br>
Calcium lactate and magnesium gluconate are the most soluble organic forms of calcium<br>
and magnesium suitable for use and are highly soluble throughout the entire digestive<br>
tract<br>
Although physical admixture of calcium lactate and magnesium gluconate have been<br>
known to be used for sometime as mineral food supplements, the present invention for the<br>
first time provides for an organic mineral complex of calcium magnesium lactate<br>
gluconate that has a much superior solubility, absorption and taste profile compared to<br>
said physical admixture of calcium lactate and magnesium gluconate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a novel, metastable chelate complex of calcium magnesium<br>
lactate gluconate (herein referred to as "CMLG") of the formula I or II, as shown below.<br><br><br>
The process of manufacturing of said calcium magnesium lactate gluconate according<br>
to the invention involves the reaction of calcium lactate with magnesium gluconate OR<br>
calcium gluconate with magnesium lactate in aqueous medium at 60 to 80°C. Once the<br>
complex is formed the product is either isolated by crystallization OR the solution is<br>
instantly spray dried to get the dry solid product of CMLG.<br>
The aforesaid complex, formed after the reaction is complete, is thermodynamically an<br>
intermediate complex, which is a metastable chelate. As used herein the term "metastable"<br>
means that the material is not at equilibrium, and is a mixture of crystalline and<br>
amorphous forms in varied proportions. It is known in the literature that the metastable<br>
complexes of calcium and other mineral salts tend to loose their metastability, when<br>
allowed to crystallize from aqueous solutions over a long period of time, leading to the<br>
formation of fully hydrated crystalline forms that have low water solubility, limiting their<br>
use in industrial applications.<br>
In case of the product, being the aforementioned complex, if that is allowed to<br>
crystallize from water, it forms a more crystalline product, when isolated in dry form, and<br>
has very less water solubility ( 10% w/v); whereas, if the solution containing the<br>
metastable chelate complex is instantly spray dried to get dry powder, it retains the<br>
metastable form and hence the water solubility of spray dried product is very high ( 25 %<br>
w/v). The physical and chemical data of this product is consistent with the theory that<br>
there are non-crystalline regions within the powdered material which can hydrate to the<br>
point of behaving like a solution. It is important for the solubility characteristics of the<br>
calcium magnesium lactate gluconate, that the required metastable structure be achieved<br>
in powder form. Hence, the metastable form of calcium magnesium lactate gluconate of<br>
the present invention is instantly isolated by spray drying technology, so as to obtain the<br>
product in powder form, which has very high water solubility and is most suitable for all<br>
industrial applications.<br>
The said novel, metastable chelate complex in accordance with the invention has<br>
improved solubility, better taste and enhanced absorption profile.<br><br><br>
The following analytical characterization of the product according to the invention - by<br>
NMR, Mass, FTIR &amp; C, H &amp; N analysis, establishes the novelty of the metastable chelate<br>
complex of calcium magnesium lactate gluconate, represented by formula I or II<br>
The product of the invention of Formula-I<br><br>
is characterized by NMR, Mass spectra and C, H &amp; N analysis, whose details are given<br>
below.<br>
The mass spectra showed a M+1 peak at 633.4, that corresponds to the molecular weight of<br>
Formula -I, which has the molecular formula of C18H32O20 Ca Mg.<br><br>
The 13C NMR and 1H NMR spectra of the sample under study rightly corresponds to!<br>
the structure of the product, as represented by the aforesaid Formula-I. Also, the peak <br>
to peak comparison has revealed that there are no extra peaks in the sample under.<br>
study and hence the spectra is fully compliant with the claimed structure.	<br><br><br>
The elemental contents of the concerned sample match closely with that of the theoretical<br>
values. However a small variation, particularly in the hydrogen and oxygen content in the<br>
sample, with respect to that of theoretical values observed, may be due to traces of<br>
moisture present in the product and / or experimental errors.<br>
The absorption properties of of the said calcium magnesium lactate gluconate<br>
(hereinafter referred to as CMLG complex) was studied using "Franz diffusion cell" at<br>
36°C. The following table gives the details of the diffusion study. The membrane used is<br>
the non-Reinforced silicone membrane (SilasticR, poly dimethyl siloxane, type 500 -1,<br>
Laboratorie Perouse Implant, Bornel, France) of 0.125mm thickness was used for the<br>
experiment. The quantities of CMLG in solution were calculated based on the amount of<br>
calcium and magnesium present in the solution, which was measured by using Atomic<br>
Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS).<br><br>
Based on the diffusion experiments carried out, it is clear that about 90% of the CMLG was<br>
found to be diffused through the membrane, indicating better bioavailability index.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention involves the conjoint use of nutritionally-supplemental amounts<br>
of calcium and magnesium.<br>
By "nutritional" or "nutritionally-supplemental amount" herein is meant that the mineral<br>
sources used in the practice of this invention provide a nourishing amount of said<br>
minerals. In mineral supplements such as powders, this supplemental amount will<br>
comprise at least 35-50% of the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of the daily<br>
intake of said mineral, as defined in The United States of America (Recommended Daily<br>
Dietary Allowance-Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences-National<br>
Research Council). More generally, mineral supplements will contain at least 10% more<br>
typically 35% to 50%, of the RDA per unit dose of the supplement. Of course, it is<br>
recognized that the preferred daily intake of any mineral may vary with the user. For<br>
example, pregnant, lactating, or post-menopausal females may require an increased intake<br>
of calcium, over the usual RDA. In general, the RDA (calcium) will range from 360<br>
mg/6 Kg for infants to 1200 mg/54-58 Kg female, 1000 mg/70 kg adult male, depending<br>
somewhat on age. The RDA (magnesium) ranges from 10mg per Kg for infants to<br>
300mg/55 Kg female, and 350mg for adult male, depending somewhat on age.<br><br><br>
The present invention provides an organic mineral complex of calcium and magnesium,<br>
namely calcium magnesium lactate gluconate, which has higher solubility, better<br>
bioavailability and neutral taste, thus useful in various applications. The invention is<br>
also directed to a process during which calcium lactate and magnesium gluconate are<br>
dissolved in water, mixed in a reaction vessel, filtered, spray dried and sieved. The<br>
product is an organic mineral complex of calcium lactate and magnesium gluconate.<br>
The process produces a free flowing composition which can be commercially<br>
manufactured, having higher solubility, better bioavailability and neutral taste. Organic<br>
magnesium salt given with calcium results in better absorption.<br>
Fig. 1 is a manufacturing flowchart which describes the general pathway for producing<br>
the product of invention. A desired amount of a calcium salt, such as calcium lactate or<br>
gluconate is first added to purified water in a reaction vessel at around 70-80 deg.C.<br>
Also useful for this steps is to keep the mixture for 30 mins to complete dissolution.<br>
After a clear solution is obtained a magnesium salt is added preferably gluconate or<br>
lactate. The salts are preferably in powder form to speed dissolution. The solution is<br>
kept for around 1.5 hrs to ensure complete complex formation. Visible check is done by<br>
taking 150 ml solution in a 250ml beaker. The solution is clear with no undissolved<br>
matter. The pH of the solution at this stage is between 6.00 to 7.00.<br>
Next charcoal is added slowly and a wait for a period of 30 mins at a temperature of<br>
around 60 deg. C. Activated Charcoal treatment removes the colored impurities in the<br>
final complex solution. The temperature is kept at check at all stages during the process.<br>
The optimum quantity of charcoal powder that can be used to get good quality product, as<br>
described in examples 1 to 4 hereinafter, is between 2 to 20 gms, most preferably 5 to 10 grams,<br>
which is best suitable for complete removal of color and other impurities from the reaction solution.<br><br>
Now the complex of calcium and magnesium is ready for filtration. The complex<br>
solution is filtered for which a filter press, membrane filter and Nutsche filter may be<br>
used. The temperature at this stage shall be maintained at 70 deg.C. The insoluble residues<br>
are removed by filtration and the clear filtrate is transferred to a storage vessel.<br>
Different types of dryers may be utilized which require specific conditions. One such<br>
method used here is spray drying. Spray drying requires the solution to be maintained at a<br>
temperature that keeps solution in a liquid state. Adjustment of pumping rate, the inlet and-<br>
outlet air temperatures in the spray drier is done. Solution is forced through the inlet where<br>
it is converted to droplets and dries in presence of hot air. At the bottom of spray drier the<br>
dried composition has LOD 5-6%.Other methodsof drying are also used for producing this<br>
organic mineral complex.<br>
Different ratios of calcium and magnesium with various salts of organic acids can be<br>
produced by using the same manufacturing process as described above.<br>
Coloring agents used are selected from quinine yellow, Ponceau 4R, Allura Red, Carmoisine,<br>
 Chocolate brown HT, Erythrosine, etc...or any other food grade color permissible for such uses.<br><br>
Some Preparatory examples for production of organic mineral complex of the invention are<br>
given below:<br>
