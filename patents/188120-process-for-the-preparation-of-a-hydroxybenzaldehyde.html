The mixture was distilled for 3 hours and the carrier (toluene) was recycled to separate the theoretical quantity of water.<br>
Dilution with 75 g of toluene followed and 16 g of trioxymethylene suspended in 25 g of toluene was added. The mixture was held at 80°C until the reaction with the formaldehyde was complete (about 3 hours).<br>
The solution of saligenlne borate in toluene was hydrolysed at, room temperature with a caustic soda solution prepared by adding 200 g of water to 152 g of a 30 % by weight caustic soda solution. This was then decanted and the aqueous solution containing the sodium salts of saligenol and boric acid was separated out.<br>
This aqueous solution was oxidized directly using the procedure described in Example 4, except that it was not necessary to add boric acid.<br>
Oxygen at atmospheric pressure was passed into the solution, to which the following had been added:<br>
0.8 g of 2 % platinum black (16 mg of platinxim); 0-035 g of bismuth oxide (31 mg of bismuth).<br><br>
until the volume of oxygen absorbed corresponded to the theoretical quantity required to transform the sallgenol into salicylic aldehyde, namely about 1 hour.<br>
The catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture and the salicylic aldehyde formed was liberated from Its sodium salt by adding 200 ml of 5N sulphuric acid, then steam distilling or extracting using an appropriate solvent to Isolate the salicylic aldehyde.<br>
43 g of salicylic aldehyde was obtained, representing a field of 68 % with respect to the phenol used.<br>
EXAMPLE 6*<br>
Example 5 was repeated but without the addition of bismuth oxide to the aqueous solution containing the sodium salts of jsaligenol and boric acid (before oxidation).<br>
23 g of salicylic aldehyde was obtained, i.e., a yield of 37 % with respect to the phenol used.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 The following were loaded into a three necked flask provided with a thermometer, a distillation column, a retrograder, a coolant and a separator:<br>
salicylic aldehyde (600 mmol) prepared in accordance with<br>
Example 5;<br>
acetic anhydride (1.90 mmol) in solution in acetic acid<br>
»<br>
(3.47 g).<br>
This was refluxed and sodium acetate (2.1 mmol) was introduced in solution in acetic acid (3.47 g).<br>
The acetic acid was distilled by maintaining the reflux until the temperature at the column head was about 118*C.<br><br>
