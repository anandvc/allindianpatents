				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to stir-in pigment compositions in the form of microgranules, comprising 85 to 99.5 parts by weight of a pigment and 0.5 to 15 parts by weight of an additive comprising a vinylpyrrolidone polymer or copolymer, with the proviso that the copolymer is not a copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acid and N-vin|l-pyrrolidone.<br>
Organic stir-in pigments are known and are described for example in U.S. Patent No. 5,554,217. These known stir-in pigments and stir-in pigment compositions show excellent stir-in properties when applied in paint and ink systems, particularly solvent-based systems. They have the great advantage that they can be incorporated into an ink or paint system by simply stirring the pigment powder into the paint system without the time and energy consuming dispersion step in a bead mill.<br>
It is also known to use certain pigment preparations, also called master batches, ha ing a pigment concentration of 30 to 60 weight percent based on the preparation, as stir-in pigments. Such stir-in preparations show excellent properties in certain applications. However, they do have the disadvantage of employing an expensive preparation process, and occasionally they show incompatibility in some application media due to the hig   amount of carrier additives.<br>
Many patents describe processes for pigment surface modifications to enhance certain pigment properties like color strength or Theological properties, for example by the addition of pigment derivatives such as pigment sulfonic acids, sulfonamides or other pigment derivatives. However, such treated pigments need to be dispersed for many hours in a bead mill in order to incorporate the pigment into a paint vehicle.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,806,464 discloses the encapsulation of pigments with an acrylic interpolymer, and Japanese published patent application SHO 57-49664A describes a process for the preparation of pigment compositions containing thermoplastic resins which can be dissolved in water with a basic substance. Although these pigments contair polar polymers, they are different from the present inventive pigment compositions because they<br>
contain different kinds of additives. Furthermore, they show incompatibility in certain application media. Therefore, their use as pigment compositions has not been wide spread. Other patents, such as U.S. Patents 5,274,010 and 5,401,780, describe a process f r warp-free pigmenting of polyolefins by coating the pigment surface with a polyvinylalcoho or other polar polymers such as acrylic polymers, cellulose derivatives, maleic anhydride-sty ene copolymers and polyvinylpyrrolidone, alone or in combination with silane and zirconium acetylacetonate films. The coating of the pigment is achieved by (A) absorption of a preformed, soluble polymer onto the pigment or (B) by polymerization of a corresponding monomer in the presence of the pigment. In either case the resulting coated pigmet t is recovered by filtration from an aqueous suspension. Such suspensions are difficult to filter and can show strong bleed-through of very finely divided pigment particles. Therefore filter aids are often added to improve the filtration rates. However, the presence of these filter aids in the pigment composition can lead to incompatibilty of the resulting coated pigments when applied in substrates other than polyolefins. Additionally, such pigment suspensions contain a large quantity of unabsorbed polymer which is dissolved in the aqueous medium and thus remains in the filtrate after filtration. This highly colored filtrate then requires special treatment in order to recover or degrade the soluble polymer and to decreas  the filtrate's color to environmentally acceptable levels.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,145,524 discloses surface modification of pigments by treatment with polyvinylalkyl ethers to obtain pigments with enhanced properties for automotive finish systems. This surface treatment also improves the flow properties of the pigment in aqueous systems, leading to aqueous pigment dispersions with a higher solids content for direct application in waterborne paint systems. Such pigment dispersions can have the drawback of foaming and settling. Additionally, they require the addition of antifouling agents. Moreover, in most cases they still need to be dispersed in a bead mill for optimum dispersion.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,904,562 describes a process for encapsulating finely divided organic pigment particles with a polymeric outer layer by a precipitation process. This process is costly and environmentally unfriendly due to the use of a large quantity of an inorganic salt to induce precipitation of the polymer from the aqueous medium. Additionally, the particles encapsulated according to the teachings of this patent require a higher molecular weight polyvinyl pyrrolidone and a larger amount of polymer based on the pigment to ensure <br>
complete encapsulation, which can adversely affect the compatibility of the pigment when it is applied in various different substrates.<br>
Japanese laid open patent application SHO 58-208351 describes pigment compositions comprising a pigment and a water soluble copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acid compound and a N-vinylpyrrolidone compound. Said pigment compositions can be incorporated into aqueous vehicles by simple mechanical stirring without a disperion step. However, due to the presence of the polymeric sulfonic acids, these pigment compositions may not be suitable for many applications, for example, application in automotive paint systems, since it is well known that the strongly polar polysulfonic acids have a detrimental effect on the curing of the coating system. Additionally, the presence of the polysultonic acids can enhance water absorption, which can further damage the weather ability of the pigmented coating system.<br>
Due to environmental concerns and new environmental regulations the paint industry is moving extensively from solvent borne to aqueous borne coatings systems. Newly developed improved aqueous polymeric binder systems are helping to speed up their transformation, but they also force pigment manufacturers to continually modify their pigments to adapt the pigment properties to the latest customer needs.<br>
The present invention relates to new stir-in pigment compositions in the form of microgranules comprising 85 to 99.5 parts by weight of a pigment and 0.5 to 15 parts by weight of an additive which comprises a vinylpyrrolidone polymer or copolymer. These new microgranule stir-in pigment compositions are obtainable by spray drying a high solids content aqueous pigment dispersion containing the pigment and the additive. They manifest enhanced pigment properties when applied in aqueous ink and paint systems, particulary those used in industrial coatings, trade sales and the automotive industry.<br>
Unexpectedly, it was discovered that such stir-in pigment compositions can effortlessly be incorporated into aqueous ink and paint systems as a stir-in pigment without carrying out a dispersion step in a bead mill. Compared to conventionally dried and micropulvered pigments, the new pigment compositions are generally less dusty and can be more easily handled. They are also easily wetted and disperse rapidly to form homogeneous acqueous pigment dispersions which are practically free of larger pigment aggregates. Many small particle size pigments are known to aggregate during the drying process. However, even with pigments exhibiting this aggregation tendency, surprisingly, the inventive microgranular stir-in pigment compositions are easily dispersible in aqueous paint systems. Moreover such stir-in pigment compositions have the great advantage that they are compatible with a variety of aqueous paint and ink systems, including the most demanding automotive paint systems. Additionally, the new stir-in pigment compositions are obtainable by a very simple, economical and environmentally friendly method in conventional equipment.<br>
This invention relates to stir-in pigment compositions which are in the form of microgranules and comprise from 85 to 99.5 parts, preferably 90 to 99 parts and most preferably 94  to 99 parts by weight of a pigment and from 0.5 to 15 parts, preferably 1 to 10 parts and most preferably 1 to 6 parts by weight of an additive comprising a vinylpyrrolidone polymer or copolymer, with the proviso that the copolymer is not a copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acid and N-vinylpyrrolidone.<br>
These new microgranular stir-in pigment compositions are preferably obtainable by  spray drying an aqueous pigment dispersion, comprising 85 to 99.5 parts by weight of a pigment and from 0.5 to 15 parts by weight of an additive comprising a vinylpyrrolidone polyjmer or copolymer, with the proviso that the copolymer is not a copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acid and N-vinylpyrrolidone. Particularly preferred is a spray drying of a high solid content aqueous pigment dispersion. They are useful for coloring high molecular weight materials.<br>
A wide variety of vinylpyrrolidone homo- or copolymers are suitable as additives for preparing the inventive stir-in pigment compositions. In general, the vinylpyrrolidone homopolymer is a polyvinylpyrrolidone obtained by polymerization of 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (also known as vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylpyrrolidone and NVP) by processes known per se. Such polymers are well known and many are commercially available. Preferably the weight average molecular weight of the polyvinylpyrrolidone is no more than 300,000 g/mol most preferably it is between 5,000 and 200,000 g/mol.<br>
Suitable vinylpyrrolidone copolymers are, for example, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone with vinylether, vinylalcohol, or vinylacetate; acrylic or methacrylic acid or an ester or amide thereof, and particularly with vinylacetate.<br>
Especially suitable are water-soluble copolymers such as water-soluble polyvinylpyrrolidone vinylacetate copolymers having a vinylpyrrolidone to vinylacetate ratio of from 70 to 80 to 60 to 40.<br>
Depending on the pigment employed in the inventive stir-in pigment composition and its application medium, it can be advantageous to use the vinylpyrrolidone homo- or copolymer additive in admixture with other preferably water-soluble polymers, copolymers and/or polymer derivatives.<br>
Hence, another preferred embodiment of the present invention concerns the inventive pigment composition, wherein the additive comprises a mixture of the vinyl pyrrolidone or vinylpyrrolidone copolymer with one or more other neutral, anionic or cationic water soluble polymers, copolymers and/or polymer derivatives, and wherein the total amount of the mixture of additives is less than 20 parts by weight of the pigment composition.<br>
Such polymers are for example polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polymaleic anhydride polyurethane, polyvinylether, polyvinylalcohol, polyalkylene glycol, polyethylene oxide. cellulose derivatives, polyimine, polyvinylpyridine, or copolymers thereof, or copolymers such as copolymers of acrylic acid with styrene, acrylonitrile, vinylacetate, vinylphosphonate, vinylpropionate, vinylchloride, itaconic acid or maleic anhydride, or a mixture theref, Suitable polymeric derivatives are for example ethoxylated or propoxylated fatty amines such as ethoxylated cocoalkyl, oleyl or soyaalkyl amines; ethoxylated or propoxylated fatty quaternary salts such as ethoxylated cocoalkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride; ethoxylated fatty amides such as ethoxylated oleamides; alkyl-, cycloalkyl- or alkylaryl-oxypoly(ethylenoxy)ethanol, cycloalkyloxypoly(ethylenoxy)laurate or oleate, polyethylene glycol 400 laurate or oleate, alkyl-, cycloalkyl- or alkylaryl-poly(ethylenoxy)carboxylate or phosphonate. An especially preferred cycloalkyloxypoly(ethylenoxy) laurate or oleate is for example a poly(ethylenoxy)sorbitan laurate or oleate. These other preferably water soluble polymers, copolymers and/or polymer derivatives are known per se and are commercially available.<br>
The total amount of the vinylpyrrolidone homo- or copolymer additive and other preferably water-soluble polymers, copolymers and/or polymer derivatives in the inventive pigment composition is preferably no more than 20 parts by weight, most preferably from 5 to 15<br><br>
parts by weight. Preferably such a mixture comprises at least 20 %, most preferably 20 to 80 % by weight of the vinylpyrrolidone polymer or vinylpyrrolidone copolymer.<br>
If the other polymer, copolymer and/or polymer derivative is an anionic or cationic polymer, the polymer additive mixture is preferably dissolved as salts in an aqueous medium, preferably a basic or acidic aqueous medium.<br>
Another preferred embodiment relates to the inventive pigment composition, wheren said cationic polymer is polyvinylpyridine or polyimine.<br>
Advantageously an anionic polymer or polymer derivative or copolymer is dissolved in water as an alkylammonium, sodium, potassium or an ammonium salt.<br>
A further preferred embodiment relates to the inventive pigment composition, whereln said pigment is an organic or inorganic pigment or a mixture thereof.<br>

Generally, the pigment according to this invention has an average particle size in the range of from 0.001 to 30 µm, preferably within the range from 0.005 to 5 µm. Based on these average particle size ranges, it is clear that the pigment preferably is used in the form of a pigment crude or a conditioned pigment. Preferably the pigment is used in its aquec is presscake form as obtained for example by the isolation of the pigment after synthes is or conditioning. Additionally, the pigment can contain customary additives, such as inorganic fillers, light stabilizers and/or antiflocculating agents.<br>
Therefore, another preferred embodiment of the instant invention concerns the inventive pigment composition, wherein said pigment is a mixture of an organic pigment and an inorganic filler.<br>
The expression "inorganic filler" means a substantially transparent inorganic pigment. For example, mica, kaolin, talc, wollastonite and natural or synthetic silica, e.g. glass, are well-known inorganic fillers that are suitable for use in the pigment compositions of the pigjsent invention. Talc, muscovite mica and kaolin, or mixtures thereof, are highly suitable inorganic fillers.<br>
Transparent micas are especially suitable for use as an inorganic filler. Of the micas muscovite, phlogopite, brolite and synthetic micas are most suitable.<br>
The inorganic filler is preferably used in its natural form, but treated transparent or semi-transparent inorganic filler pigments, for example a mica treated with a metal oxide, or talc treated with an organic aliphatic compound, such as a long chain aliphatic acid, may also be employed. In general, the inorganic filler consists of primary filler particles having any geometric shape, but a flaked shape is preferred. Preferably the inorganic filler has an average particle size in the range of 0.5 to 10 µm and a maximum particle size of below 20 µm.<br>
Typically the inorganic filler is used in a concentration of 1 to 30 percent based on the weight of the pigment.<br>
Hence, another preferred embodiment relates to the inventive pigment composition wherein said pigment is a mixture of 70 to 99 parts by weight of an organic pigment and 1 to 30 parts by weight of an inorganic filler.<br>
Light stabilizers, such as U.V. absorbers and hindered amine light stabilizers, are known in the art. They may be used in any suitable, effective amount in the present pigment compositions as long as they do not impair the stir-in pigment properties of the composition.<br>
Antiflocculating agents, also described as rheology improving agents or particle growth inhibitors, are well known in the pigment industry and are suitable as additives for the present pigment compositions. Generally antiflocculating agents are for example, pigment derivatives such as the sulfonic acid, sulfonic acid salts or sulfonamide derivatives organic pigments. Typically rheology improving agents are used in a concentration of 0.5 to 8 percent based on the weight of the organic pigment.<br>
The inorganic filler, light stabilizer and/or antiflocculating agent is incorporated into the composition before, during or after the spray drying step. Preferably, these customary additives are added prior to the spray drying step. Depending on the customary additive, it is preferably added at the end of the synthesis or conditioning step, before the isolatio   of the pigment, or it is added into a reslurried high solids content aqueous pigment presscake dispersion.<br>
The inventive pigment compositions can be prepared preferably by a process, which omprises<br>
(A)	preparing an aqueous solution of the additive;<br>
(B)	slurrying a pigment in the solution to obtain a homogeneous liquid dispersion comprising<br>
85 to 99.5 parts by weight of the pigment and 0.5 to 15 parts by weight of the additive,<br>
(C)	spray drying the resulting liquid dispersion and<br>
(D)	collecting the dried microgranules of the pigment composition. <br>
A preferred embodiment thereof concerns the inventive process, wherein an aqueous presscake of the pigment is slurried in the solution.<br>
In a preferred method, a highly concentrated pigment presscake is slurried in any si table device at temperatures between 5 to 90° C, preferably 20 to 60° C, such as, for example,a Cowles® disperser, in the presence of the aqueous additive solution as illustrated in the examples below to obtain a homogeneous aqueous dispersion. Suitable conditions for spray drying the homogeneous aqueous dispersions can then easily be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Due to the known pronounced fluidizing effect of the additives employed according to this invention, low viscosity aqueous pigment dispersions with a solids content of above 20% or, depending on the pigment and polymeric additive or additive mixture, solids content of 25% and above can be easily generated. Despite the high pigment concentration, these pigment dispersions have the advantage that they are liquid, easily flowable and ideally suited for spray drying.<br>
Spray drying is a well known drying technology in the chemical industry. Any equipment which is conventional for spray drying can be used to spray dry the inventive pigment compositions. Suitable commercially available equipment includes the BOWEN BLS spray dryer from Bowen or the NIRO ATOMIZER from NIRO Company.<br>
Due to their high solids content, the inventive pigment dispersions are dried rapidly and economically by spray drying, yielding unique pigment composition powders composed of microgranules. The additives according to this invention are homogeneously distributed in the stir-in pigment compositions and also serve as the binder for the microgranules.<br>
Typically, the microgranules have a size in the range of from 1 to 1000 µm, preferably from 3 to 300 µm when suspended in a water-immiscible solvent such as xylene and observed under the light microscope. They can have any shape. The shape and size of the microgranules are influenced by several parameters such as the kind and particle site of the pigment, the kind and concentration of the additive or additive mixture respectively, as well as the spray drying conditions and the spray dryer equipment. Because of the larger particle size of the microgranules, they are generally less dusty and can be more easily handled than conventionally dried and micropulverized pigments.<br>
The inventive pigment compositions are easily wetted in aqueous ink or paint systems. Surprisingly they are dispersed quickly by simply stirring the pigment into an aqueous ink or paint system without a dispersion step in a bead mill or other high shear-inducing equipment. Thus the inventive pigment compositions are ideal for use as stir-in pigments in aqueous systems, where they eliminate the time and energy-consuming step of bead milling is well as the expense of cleaning the bead mills.<br>
In general, an effective pigmenting amount of the stir-in pigment composition is incorporated into the high molecular weight organic material to be pigmented. An effective pigmenting amount is any amount suitable to provide the desired color in the high molecular weight organic material. In particular, the stir-in pigments are used in an amount of 0.01 to 50% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the weight of the high molecular weight organic material to be pigmented.<br>
The pigmented, high molecular weight organic materials which are colored according   to the present process are useful in a variety of applications. For example, the high molecular weight organic material can be used for the pigmentation of lacquers, inks and enamel coating compositions. The pigmented high molecular weight organic materials prepared according to the present invention are particularly useful for preparing automotive coating paints.<br>
The high molecular weight organic materials which are colored according to the present process are, preferably if the high molecular weight organic material is a coating or an ink system, for example cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, polyurethanes, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyolefins, polystyrene, polysulfones, polyamides, polycycloamides. polyimides, polyethers, polyether ketones, polyvinyl halides, polytetrafluoroethylene, acrylic and methacrylic polymers, rubber, silicone polymers, phenol/formaldehyde resins, melamine, formaldehyde resins, urea/formaldehyde resins, epoxy resins and diene rubbers or copolymers thereof.<br>
High molecular weight organic materials which are useful for heat-curable or cross-linked coatings, for example chemically-reactive coatings, are also colored according to the present process. The pigmented, high molecular weight organic materials prepared according to the present process are especially useful in stoving finishes which contain customary binders and which are reactive at high temperature. Examples of the high molecular weight organic materials which are used in such coatings include acrylic, alkyd, epoxy, phenolic, melamine, urea, polyester, polyurethane, blocked isocyanate, benzoguanamine or cellulose ester resins, or combinations thereof. The pigmented, high molecular weight organic materials prepared according to the present process are also useful in air-drying or physically-drying coatings.<br>
The present stir-in pigment compositions are particularly suitable for preparing pigmented coatings of the types conventionally employed in industrial paints, particularly in the automobile industry, especially aqueous acrylic/melamine resin, alky/melamine resin, thermoplastic acrylic resin or polyurethane resin systems.<br>
Due to the excellent dispersibility of the stir-in pigment compositions of this invention, uniform distribution of pigment particles throughout the entire application media is readily achieved. Compositions containing the present stir-in pigments show excellent rheological behavior.<br>
The present stir-in pigment compositions are used alone or in the presence of other pigments or dyes. It is especially useful to color a high molecular weight organic material with the present stir-in pigment compositions in conjunction with an effect pigment.<br>
The color effect and shade are varied by varying the kind of the effect pigment and the concentrations of the effect pigment and the stir-in pigment composition of the present invention. Particularly striking effect shades are generated by using the stir-in pigments with known transparent titanium dioxide-coated mica or aluminum pigments.<br>
Due to their unique pigment properties, the new stir-in pigment compositions are also suitable for coloring high-molecular-weight organic materials which are plastics that the calendered, cast, molded or processed to fibers and the like. The pigment compositions impart excellent physical properties to colored plastic articles such as polypropylene or <br>
polyamide fibers, plastic films, bottle crates and so on. Thus, the present invention further embraces processes wherein the high molecular weight organic compound is a Plastic  that is calendered, cast, molded or processed to fibers and to plastic articles that are calendered, cast, molded or processed to fibers.<br>
The new stir-in pigment compositions are easily dispersible when incorporated into hight performance plastics such as for example polyethylene, polypropylene, ABS or polamide. Surprisingly, the resulting colored molded products show practically no flow lines, proving the pigment compositions are very homogenously distributed in the polymer. As one skilled in the art appreciates, the presence of flow lines is undesirable.<br><br><br>
The inventive pigment compositions are also suitable for the preparation of liquid colors since they can provide liquid colors with a high pigment solids content. Liquid colors are well known in the pigment industry and are mainly used to color plastic materials.<br>
Additionally, the inventive pigment compositions are suitable for use in ink jet formulations. The subject invention relates to a stir-in pigment composition in the form of microgranules, which comprises 85 to 99.5 parts by weight of a pigment and 0.5 to 15 parts by weight of an additive characterizedc in that the additive comprises a vinylpyrrolidone polymer or copolymer, with the proviso that the copolymer is not a copolymer of an ethylenically un saturated sulfonic acid and N-vinyl-pyrrolidone.<br>
The subject invention also relates to a stir-in-pigment composition, which is obtainable by spray drying an aqueous pigment dispersion which comprises 85 to 99.5 parts by weight of a pigment and 0.5 to 15 parts by weight of an additive comprising a vinylprrrolidone polymer or copolymer.<br>
The subject invention is not a product of chemical  reaction. Infact, what is <br>
being claimed is a synergistic compositions.<br>
The following examples illustrate various embodiments of the invention, but the scope f the invention is not limited thereto. In the examples, all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
