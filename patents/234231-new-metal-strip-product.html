				<td>The present invention relates to a new coated steel strip material with a<br>
very hard and dense coating, it also relates to a method of manufacturing<br>
such a coated steel strip in a continuous roll-to-roll process which results in a<br>
very good adhesion of a hard and dense coating on a metal strip substrate. In<br>
particular, it relates to coated steel strips, which have such a good adhesion of<br>
the hard coating that they are suitable for use in shaving equipment, medical<br>
instruments, utility and industrial knives as well as saw applications.<br>
Background to the invention and prior Art<br>
Coated steel products can be used in various applications. One<br>
example is in the manufacture of knives, such as as utility knives, e.g. slicers,<br>
carving knives, bread knives, butcher's knives, mixer blades, hunting and<br>
fishing knives, pocket knives, and industrial knives for cutting synthetic fibre,<br>
paper, plastic film, fabrics and carpets. Furthermore, these products can be<br>
used in saw applications and as medical instruments and surgical knives.<br>
Another example is in shaving applications, such as razor blades and cutters.<br>
Just to name a few.<br>
These are all applications where a hard and dense wear coating may<br>
be suitable, or even needed. Wear, which for example can result in that the<br>
coating is torn of or cracking. These are also applications which need to have<br>
hard and sharp edges and cutting surfaces. Furthermore, many of the<br>
applications listed above are used in corrosive environments and are<br>
therefore requiring a corrosion resistant surface.<br>
For cost reasons, a continuous roll-to-roll coating process, preferably<br>
integrated in the production of the stee strip, is required. Further, for quality<br>
reasons, a dense coating with very good adhesion to the substrate is of<br>
advantage. From a cost perspective, it is also a further advantage if there is<br>
such a good adhesion of the abrasion resistant coating that there is no need<br>
of any separate bond-coat.<br>
The good adhesion of a dense coating is needed for the functional<br>
quality of the finished product. A poor adhesion, or a porous or coarse<br>
coating, would cause problems during usage of for example an industrial knife<br>
or saw, e.g., that the coating starts to flake off, that grains or small pieces are<br>
torn off, or that fissure problems occur. All in all, this is not acceptable from a<br>
quality and cost perspective.<br>
There are several common methods of making a coating and also<br>
several different types of coatings that are being used. As examples can be<br>
mentioned:<br>
¦ Ceramic coatings, often consisting of AI2O3 with possible additions of T1O2<br>
and/or ZrO2. This type of coating is normally applied by using a thermal<br>
spray method. Thermal spray methods have normally some major<br>
drawbacks. The formed coating Is rough which means that polishing or<br>
other further processing must usually be done to the surface after the<br>
coating. A thermal spray coating also usually includes a high degree of<br>
porosity, implying that a thin dense coating normally can not be achieved.<br>
Furthermore, the thickness of thermal sprayed coatings is normally rather<br>
high. During usage, a thick and coarse coating has an increased risk of<br>
fissure formation or that grains tear off from the surface. In many cases<br>
expensive nickel or nickel alloys must also be used as a bond-coat in order<br>
to improve the adhesion of the ceramic coating.<br>
¦ Metallic coatings, often consisting of pure nickel or chromium, or in the<br>
form of a compound such as nickel-phosphorus. These types of metallic<br>
coatings are normally applied by using a plating method, and especially<br>
electrolytic plating. Electrolytic plating methods have some drawbacks, one<br>
major being the difficulty to obtain an even thickness and also that the<br>
adhesion of the coating can be poor. Also, plating processes are not<br>
environmentally friendly, on the contrary, these processes are often<br>
causing environmental problems.<br>
¦ Combinations of coatings, such as a nickel coating comprising abrasion<br>
resistant particles, e.g., SiC. This method also has some drawbacks, in<br>
principle the same drawbacks as for electrolytic plating as described<br>
above, but also that nickel is used to a large extent as a bond-coat,<br>
meaning that the coating is very expensive.<br>
Thus, the methods as described in the examples above are not suitable<br>
for the present invention.<br>
Therefore, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a hard<br>
and abrasion resistant coated metal strip with improved adhesion between a<br>
dense coating and the substrate.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to obtain a cost-efficient coating<br>
in a continuous roll-to-roll process integrated in the production of a steel strip.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to obtain a coating with a<br>
thickness as uniform as possible.<br>
These and other objects have been surprisingly attained by providing a<br>
coated steel product according to claim 1. Further preferred embodiments are<br>
defined in the dependent claims.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
A suitable coating for the use in shaving equipment, medical instruments,<br>
utility and industrial knives as well as saw applications is a dense and<br>
abrasion resistant coating with good adhesion. These are all applications in<br>
which wear often arise on the blades. For example in the case of shaving<br>
equipment, a razor blade should be able to withstand the wear during shaving,<br>
thereby keeping a sharp shaving edge, and at the same time withstand the<br>
corrosive environment. A suitable coating for use in the above mentioned<br>
applications has a dense layer of an abrasion resistant coating with good<br>
adhesion, which is hard but also tough enough to withstand the work-load and<br>
pressure during usage, without showing any tendency to brittleness or tearing<br>
off.<br>
To prevent the end product from wear, it is suitable to have the product<br>
coated with at least one layer of abrasion resistant coating. Both one-sided<br>
and two-sided coatings can be used. One-sided coatings are preferable from<br>
a cost perspective and should be used whenever possible. For blade<br>
applications used in more severe conditions, or during longer running times,<br>
two-sided coatings may be preferable. Otherwise, problems may occur with,<br>
e.g., plastic deformation along the edge on the uncoated side, or that there is<br>
a material build-up along the edge of the uncoated side, which occasionally<br>
may be ripped off from a spot, causing material to locally be torn away from<br>
the edge of the blade.<br>
The method described in the present invention is suitable for thin<br>
coatings of hard and dense abrasion resistant coatings in thicknesses on each<br>
side up to 25 µm in total, normally up to 20 µrn in total, preferably up to 15 µm<br>
in total, or at the best maximum 12 µm or even maximum 10 µm in total, is<br>
preferable from a cost perspective. If thicker coatings are to be coated, an<br>
optimum in cost versus properties may be achieved by using multi-layers with<br>
up to 10 layers, and where each layer is between 0,1 to 15 µm thick, suitably<br>
between 0,1 to 10 µm, or more suitably 0,1 to 7 µm, preferably 0,1 to 5 µm<br>
and even more preferably 0,1 to 3 µrn.<br>
The coating should be sufficiently wear-resistant in order to withstand the<br>
wear and shear exerted by the treated material, on the other hand it should<br>
not be too thick, due to economical reasons and fragility/brittleness.<br>
The coating is performed at a rate of minimum 2,5 meters per minute,<br>
preferably min 5 m/min, most preferably min 10 m/min.<br>
The abrasion resistance can be achieved by depositing at least one layer<br>
of dense oxide coating in the form of Al2O3, TiO2 or ZrO2, or mixtures of these<br>
oxides, preferably AI2O3-based. Depending on the requirements, an optimum<br>
of required hardness and toughness can be achieved by using mixed oxides<br>
in the coating. This can be achieved by co-evaporation of aluminum oxide and<br>
another selected oxide. Preferably it can be a co-evaporation of aluminum<br>
oxide and any other oxide, preferably TiO2 and/or ZrO2. Multi-layers may also<br>
be used in order to enable a combination of oxides so as to optimize hardness<br>
and toughness by having up to 10 layers with different oxides in the layers.<br>
As an alternative to the above-described abrasion resistant layer consisting<br>
of essentially oxides, also other dense and hard coatings such as metallic<br>
coatings can be used in the present invention. Hard metallic coatings such as<br>
essentially pure Cr may be used if a simple and cheap coating is to be<br>
preferred in order to reduce cost as much as possible.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is to use coatings of<br>
transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, such as e.g. TiN, TiC or CrN, also in<br>
some cases in combination with an oxide in the form of AI2O3, TiO2 or ZrO2, or<br>
mixtures of these oxides, preferably AI2O3 -based. By using the multi-layer<br>
system with up to 10 layers, a coating existing of a combination of several<br>
layers of different oxides and nitrides can even further enhance the optimum<br>
of desired hardness and toughness.<br>
In order to withstand the wear and shear forces, the hardness of the<br>
thin coating should be above 600 HV, more suitably above 700 HV, preferably<br>
above 800 HV and most preferably above 900 HV. Naturally, the hardness of<br>
the coating is suitably adjusted/matched to the requirements of the intended<br>
use of the final product.<br>
The tolerances of each layer is maximum + /-10% of the layer<br>
thickness at strip widths up to 400 mm. This means that very tight tolerances<br>
can be achieved, which is of benefit for the precision during usage and the<br>
quality of the product. In comparison to plating or thermal spray this<br>
represents much higher tolerances. For instance, in plating there is a so called<br>
dog-bone effect, which results in varying thicknesses of the layer. In that case,<br>
the layer usually varies more than +/- 50% of the layer thickness.<br>
There is no need of any separate bond-coat, but nickel may still be used in<br>
one of the layers if it is required from a technical perspective, e.g., to enhance<br>
toughness. Since nickel is expensive it is usually used in very thin layers only,<br>
suitably between 0 to 2 µm, preferably between 0-1 µm and most preferably<br>
between 0-0,5 µm. However, any possible nickel layer would not be the layer<br>
adjacent to the substrate.<br>
Description of the substrate material to be coated<br>
The material to be coated should have a good basic mechanical<br>
strength, suitable for the intended application. Preferably, it should be a<br>
hardenable steel in a hardened and tempered condition, or alternatively a<br>
precipitation hardenable steel, which in the end condition can achieve a<br>
tensile strength level above 1200 MPa, or preferably more than 1300 MPa, or<br>
at the best above 1400 MPa, or even 1500 MPa. If the final coated product is<br>
intended for use in a corrosive environment, then the steel alloy should also<br>
have a sufficient addition of chromium to enable a good basic corrosion<br>
resistance. The Cr content should in this case be above 10% by weight, or at<br>
least 11%, or preferably a minimum of 12%.<br>
The coating method may be applied on any kind of product made of<br>
said type of steel alloy and in the form of a strip that has good hot workability<br>
and also can be cold-rolled to thin dimensions. The alloy should also be<br>
capable of readily being manufactured to shaving equipment like razor blades<br>
and/or cutters, medical instruments, utility and industrial knives as well as<br>
various saws, in a manufacturing process including steps such as forming,<br>
grinding, shaving, cutting, polishing, stamping, or the like. The thickness of the<br>
strip substrate material is usually between 0,015 mm to 5,0 mm and suitably<br>
between 0,03 mm to 3 mm. Preferably, it is between 0,03 to 2 mm, and even<br>
more preferably between 0,03 to 1,5 mm. Naturally, the thickness of the<br>
substrate is adapted to the intended use of the final product. The width of the<br>
substrate material depends on if the coating is made before or after the slitting<br>
operation. Appropriate widths are 1 to 1500 mm, suitably 1 to 1000 mm, or<br>
preferably 1 to 500 mm, or even more preferably between 5 and 500 mm. The<br>
length of the substrate material is suitably between 10 and 20 000 m,<br>
preferably between 100 and 20 000 m.<br>
Description of the Coating Method<br>
A variety of physical or chemical vaporation deposition methods for the<br>
application of the coating media and the coating process may be used as long<br>
as they provide a continuous uniform and adherent coating. As exemplary of<br>
deposition methods can be mentioned chemical vapor deposition (CVD),<br>
metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), physical vapor deposition<br>
(PVD) such as sputtering and evaporation by resistive heating, by electron<br>
beam, by induction, by arc resistance or by laser deposition methods, but for<br>
the present invention especially electron beam evaporation (EB) is preferred<br>
for the deposition. Optionally, the EB evaporation can be plasma activated to<br>
even further ensure good quality coatings of hard and dense coatings.<br>
For the present invention, it is a pre-requisite that the coating method is<br>
integrated in a roll-to-roll strip production line. The hard coating is then<br>
deposited by means of electron beam evaporation (EB) in a roll-to-roll<br>
process. If multi layers are needed, the formation of them can be achieved by<br>
integrating several EB deposition chambers in-line. The deposition of metallic<br>
coatings should be made under reduced atmosphere at a maximum pressure<br>
of 1 x 10-2 mbar with no addition of any reactive gas to ensure essentially pure<br>
metal films. The deposition of metal oxides should be performed under<br>
reduced pressure with an addition of an oxygen source as reactive gas in the<br>
chamber. A partial pressure of oxygen should be in the range 1 -100 x 10-4<br>
mbar. If other types of coatings are to be achieved, e.g., transition metal<br>
carbides and/or nitrides such as TiN, TiC or CrN, or mixtures thereof with,<br>
e.g., metal oxides, the conditions during the coating should be adjusted with<br>
regard to the partial pressure of a reactive gas so as to enable the formation<br>
of the intended compound. In the case of oxygen a reactive gas such as H2O,<br>
O2 or O3, but preferably O2, may be used. In the case of nitrogen a reactive<br>
gas such as N2, NH3 or N2H4, but preferably N2, may be used. In the case of<br>
carbon, any carbon containing gas may be used as reactive gas, for an<br>
example CH4, C2H2 or C2H4. All these reactive EB evaporation processes may<br>
be plasma activated.<br>
To enable a good adhesion, different types of cleaning steps are used.<br>
First of all, the surface of the substrate material should be cleaned in a proper<br>
way to remove all oil residues, which otherwise may negatively affect the<br>
efficiency of the coating process and the adhesion and quality of the coating.<br>
Moreover, the very thin native oxide layer that normally always is present on a<br>
steel surface must be removed. This can preferably be done by including a<br>
pre-treatment of the surface before the deposition of the coating. In this roll-to-<br>
roll production line, the first production step is therefore preferably an ion<br>
assisted etching of the metallic strip surface to achieve good adhesion of the<br>
first coating [see Fig. 3].<br>
Description of embodiments of the invention<br>
Two examples of embodiments of the invention will now be described<br>
in more details. The first example (Figure 1) comprises a coating 1,2 for a<br>
substrate material 3 in full strip width. The substrate material can be made of<br>
different alloys, such as a hardenable carbon steel or a hardenable stainless<br>
chromium steel. The other example (Figure 2) comprises a coating 4 of a steel<br>
strip 5, which before the coating process, has been both slitted and edge<br>
treated. During coating, both the main sides 7,8 and the narrow lateral sides<br>
9,10 are coated, thereby obtaining a full covering coating around the scraping<br>
or cutting edges 11,12. Suitably, the lateral sides 9 and 10 are coated<br>
simulateneously with the somewhat narrower main side 7. The examples<br>
given are only intended as illustrative examples to the invention and may not<br>
serve as a limitation to the present innovation.<br>
The substrate material should have a composition suitable for<br>
hardening, which means:<br>
- Hardenable carbon steel of 0,1-1,5% C, 0,001-4% Cr, 0,01-1,5% Mn, 0,01-<br>
1,5% Si, up to 1% Ni, 0,001-0,5%N, rest essentially Fe; or<br>
- Hardenable chromium steels of 0,1-1,5% C, 10-16% Cr, 0,001-1% Ni, 0,01-<br>
1,5% Mn, 0,01-1,5% Si, up to 3% Mo, 0,001-0,5% N, rest essentially Fe; or<br>
- Precipitation hardenable steels of: 0,001-0,3% C, 10-16% Cr, 4-12% Ni, 0,1-<br>
1,5% Ti, 0,01-1,0% Al, 0,01-6% Mo, 0,001-4% Cu, 0,001-0,3% N, 0,01-1,5%<br>
Mn, 0,01-1,5% Si, rest essentially Fe.<br>
Example 1<br>
The chemical compositions of the substrate materials in the example<br>
are according to the internal Sandvik designation 20C2 and 13C26, with<br>
essentially the following nominal composition:<br>
Sandvik 20C2:1,0% C, 1,4% Cr, 0,3% Si and 0,3% Mn (by weight); and<br>
Sandvik 13C26: 0,7% C, 13% Cr, 0,4% Si and 0,7% Mn (by weight).<br>
Firstly, the substrate materials are produced by ordinary metallurgical<br>
steelmaking to a chemical composition as described above. After this, they<br>
are hot-rolled down to an intermediate size, and thereafter cold-rolled in<br>
several steps with a number of recrystallization steps between said rolling<br>
steps, until a final thickness of 0,2 mm and a width of maximally 400 mm.<br>
Thereafter the strip steels are hardened and tempered to the required<br>
mechanical strength level, which according to the present invention should be<br>
at least 1200 MPa. The surface of the substrate material is then cleaned in a<br>
proper way to remove oil residuals from the rolling and hardening operations.<br>
Thereafter, the coating process takes place in a continuous process line,<br>
starting with decoiling equipment. The first step in the roll-to-roll process line<br>
can be a vacuum chamber or an entrance vacuum lock followed by an etch<br>
chamber, in which ion assisted etching takes place in order to remove the thin<br>
oxide layer on the substrate material. The strip then enters into the EB<br>
evaporation chamber(s) in which deposition of an oxide takes place, in this<br>
example AI2O3 is selected as the material to be deposited. An oxide layer of<br>
normally 0,1 up to 25 µm is deposited; the preferred thickness depends on the<br>
application. In the examples described here, a thickness of 2 µm is deposited<br>
by using one EB evaporation chamber. After the EB evaporation, the coated<br>
strip material passes through the exit vacuum chamber or exit vacuum lock<br>
before it is being coiled on to a coiler. The coated strip material can now, if<br>
needed, be further processed by for an example slitting and edge treatment,<br>
to obtain the preferred final dimension and edge condition of the intended final<br>
application. It is an advantage if an additional coating along the edge of for<br>
example a knife blade application can be made in a continuous coating<br>
process using EB evaporation, but also other processes may be used.<br>
Preferably, an additional coating along the edge of a finished blade is of same<br>
type as the coating applied on the strip material according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The end product as described in this examples, i.e. a coated 20C2 and<br>
13C26-strip material respectively, in a strip thickness of 0,2 mm and with a<br>
thin coating of Al2O3 of 2 µm, has a very good adhesion of the coated layer<br>
and is thus suitable to use especially for the manufacturing of industrial<br>
knives.<br>
The roll-to-roll electron beam evaporation process referred to above is<br>
illustrated in Figure 3. The first part of such a production line is the uncoiler 13<br>
within a vacuum chamber 14, then the in-line ion assisted etching chamber<br>
15, followed by a series of EB evaporation chambers 16, the number of EB<br>
evaporation chambers needed can vary from 1 up to 10 chambers, this to<br>
achieve a multi-layered structure, if so desired. All the EB evaporation<br>
chambers 16 are equipped with EB guns 17 and water-cooled copper<br>
crucibles 18 for the evaporation. After these chambers comes the exit vacuum<br>
chamber 19 and the recoiler 20 for the coated strip material, the recoiler being<br>
located within vacuum chamber 19. The vacuum chambers 14 and 19 may<br>
also be replaced by an entrance vacuum lock system and an exit vacuum lock<br>
system, respectively. In the latter case, the uncoiler 13 and the coiler 20 are<br>
placed in the open air.<br>
Example 2<br>
The chemical composition of the substrate material in this example is<br>
according to the internal Sandvik designation 20C with essentially the<br>
following nominal composition:<br>
Sandvik 20C: 1,0% C, 0,2% Cr, 0,3% Si and 0,4% Mn (by weight).<br>
Firstly, the substrate material is produced by ordinary metallurgical<br>
steelmaking to a chemical composition as described above. The material is<br>
then hot-rolled down to an intermediate size, and thereafter cold-rolled in<br>
several steps with a number of recrystallization steps between said rolling<br>
steps, until a final thickness of 0,45 mm and a width of maximum 400 mm are<br>
attained. Thereafter, the steel strip is hardened and tempered to the required<br>
mechanical strength level, according to the present invention above 1200<br>
MPa. The strip is afterwards slitted to a width corresponding to substantially<br>
twice the width of the final blade application. The edges along the slitted strip<br>
are then edge-treated, for example shaved, ground and polished, to the<br>
conditions and geometry considered suitable for the intended blade<br>
application. After this, the strip is submitted to a coating treatment fully<br>
analogous to Example 1, cf. also Figure 3. The end product will be a coated<br>
strip according to Figure 2, the coating material and thickness being the same<br>
as in Example 1. Now, the coated strip material can be slitted in the middle<br>
along section 6 to obtain two coated strips, each with the dimension and edge<br>
geometry suitable for a finished blade. In principle, only cutting into required<br>
final length remains.<br>
The end product as described in this example, i.e. a slitted, edge treated<br>
and coated strip material, in a strip thickness of 0,45 mm and a final slitted<br>
width of 100 mm, has a thin covering aluminum oxide layer of 2 µrn with a<br>
very good adhesion of the coated layer. This product can be cut into required<br>
length, depending on the final application, without any further processing. It<br>
may also, if required, be further processed, e.g., with an additional edge<br>
treatment or with additional coatings along the edge, or polishing or the like, in<br>
order to meet a specific customer demand. An additional coating along the<br>
edge of the finished blade application, can preferably be made in a continuous<br>
coating process using EB evaporation, but also other processes may be used.<br>
The coated steel product can be used in applications where a hard<br>
dense wear resistant coating may be suitable, such as: scissors and pruning<br>
shears, kitchen and bakery tools, handtools for plastering, trowels, medical<br>
instruments and surgical knives, razor blades, cutters, flapper valves, die<br>
cutting tools, saws and various knives in general, such as utility knives, e.g.<br>
slicers, carving knives, bread knives, butcher's knives, mixer blades, hunting<br>
and fishing knives, pocket knives and industrial knives for cutting synthetic<br>
fibre, paper, plastic film, fabrics and carpets.<br>
Thus, a strip material according to the present invention is also suitable<br>
to use in shaving equipment such as razor blades and cutters, and medical<br>
instruments such as thin surgical knives. The thickness of the substrate<br>
material is rather thin in these types of applications, normally between 0,015<br>
to 0,75 mm and usually 0,015 to 0,6 mm and preferably 0,03 to 0,45 mm. The<br>
thickness of the coating can accordingly preferably be as thin as possible,<br>
normally in total between 0,1 to 5 µM and usually 0,1 to 3 µm and preferably<br>
0,1 to 2 µm or even more preferably 0,1 to 1 µm. In this case it is thus<br>
preferred to have a small ratio between the thickness of the coating and the<br>
thickness of the strip material. The ratio is normally between 0,01% to 7% and<br>
preferably between 0,01 to 5%.<br>
One further use of the invention in this case is that the coating may be<br>
applied before the hardening and tempering treatment of the substrate<br>
material. The hard and dense coating should in this case be able to withstand<br>
a hardening temperature of minimum 400°C and preferably more than 800°C,<br>
and more preferably above 950°C, for holding times at hardening<br>
temperatures normally used in a hardening of said substrate material so as to<br>
obtain a tensile strength in accordance with the present invention, i.e., a<br>
minimum tensile strength of 1200 MPa. After such a hardening procedure, the<br>
properties of the thin layer should be maintained in accordance with the<br>
description of the present invention, i.e., the coating should have a good<br>
adhesion and be hard, dense and abrasion resistant and have a hardness of<br>
at least 600 HV, usually 700 HV, preferably 800 HV and more preferably 900<br>
HV.<br>
For further illustration, typical dimensions in the case of a strip material<br>
for razor blades would be a substrate material with a thickness below 0,15<br>
mm, normally less than 0,10 mm, and a strip width of about 400 mm ,and a<br>
coating thickness of below 5 µm, usually 2 µm, normally less than around 1<br>
µm, or even thinner.<br>
A strip material according to the present invention is suitable to use<br>
also in various utility and industrial knife applications and also saw<br>
applications. The thickness of the substrate material is rather thick in this type<br>
of application, normally between 0,1 to 5 mm and usually between 0,2 to 3<br>
mm. The thickness of the coating is however kept as thin as possible,<br>
normally in total between 0,1 to 10 µrn and usually 0,1 to 5 µrn and preferably<br>
0,1 to 3 µm or even more preferably 0,1 to 2 µm. In this case it is thus<br>
preferred to have a small ratio between the thickness of the coating and the<br>
thickness of the strip material. The ratio is normally between 0,001% to 7%<br>
and preferably between 0,01 to 5%.<br>
One further use of the invention is that the coating may be applied<br>
before the hardening and tempering treatment of the substrate material. The<br>
hard and dense coating should in this case be able to withstand a hardening<br>
temperature of minimum 400°C and preferably more than 800°C, and more<br>
preferably above 950°C, for holding times at hardening temperature normally<br>
used in a hardening of said substrate material so as to obtain a tensile<br>
strength in accordance with the present invention, i.e. a minimum of 1200<br>
MPa. After such a hardening procedure, the properties of the thin coating<br>
should be maintained in accordance with the description in the present<br>
invention, i.e. the coating should have a good adhesion and be hard, dense<br>
and abrasion resistant and have a hardness of minimum 600 HV, usually 700<br>
HV, preferably 800 HV and more preferably 900 HV.<br>
Examples 1 and 2 above both show embodiments of the invention that<br>
in an analogous way apply for razor blades and/or thin surgical knives and/or<br>
utility and industrial knives and/or saw applications. Thus, these examples<br>
illustrate coating methods and substrate materials suitable for these<br>
applications. The only difference is the sequence order for hardening and<br>
tempering, which can be altered with the coating, as also decribed above.<br>
