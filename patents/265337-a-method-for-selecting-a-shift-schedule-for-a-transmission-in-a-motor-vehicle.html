METHOD OF SELECTING A TRANSMISSION SHIFT SCHEDULE<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to transmissions, and more<br>
particularly to a method for selecting a transmission shift schedule in a motor<br>
vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] A motor vehicle having an automatic transmission includes a<br>
control scheme of shift schedule for determining when the automatic<br>
transmission shifts from one gear ratio to another gear ratio based on a plurality<br>
of factors. These factors typically include, but are not limited to, engine torque,<br>
vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position. Any given shift schedule for a<br>
motor vehicle balances fuel economy versus performance, and so any given shift<br>
schedule may be categorized as an economy shift schedule or a performance<br>
shift schedule based on the balance that characterizes the shift schedule.<br>
[0004] For a given trip in a motor vehicle, there are times when fuel<br>
economy is preferred over high-performance and other times when high-<br>
performance is preferred over fuel economy. Accordingly, it is desirable to have<br>
the ability to transition between various shift schedules, such as between an<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
economy shift schedule and a performance shift schedule, based on given<br>
driving conditions. However, it can be difficult to automatically determine which<br>
shifting schedule is desired due to variability in driving conditions, such as road<br>
grade, and vehicles parameters, such vehicle mass. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention provides a method for selecting a shift schedule using estimated road<br>
grade and vehicle mass.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] The present invention provides a method for selecting a shift<br>
schedule for a transmission in a motor vehicle.<br>
[0006] In one aspect of the present invention, the method includes the<br>
steps of determining whether a signal-to-noise ratio exceeds a threshold and<br>
measuring a tractive effort of the motor vehicle. A vehicle mass and a road<br>
grade is then estimated from the tractive effort using a recursive least squares<br>
estimator with multiple forgetting when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds the<br>
threshold. A vehicle mass is selected and the road grade estimated from the<br>
vehicle mass and tractive effort when the signal-to-noise ratio does not exceed<br>
the threshold. A shift schedule is then selected based on the vehicle mass and<br>
the estimated road grade.<br>
[0007] In another aspect of the present invention the signal-to-noise<br>
ratio is an acceleration of the vehicle when an engine torque is not approximately<br>
zero.<br>
2<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
[0008] In yet another aspect of the present invention the tractive effort<br>
is calculated from measured vehicle speed, measured engine torque, and<br>
transmission control signals.<br>
[0009] In yet another aspect of the present invention the recursive least<br>
squares estimator includes forgetting factors that modify the vehicle mass and<br>
the road grade.<br>
[0010] In still another aspect of the present invention the step of<br>
estimating the vehicle mass and the road grade using the recursive least squares<br>
estimator includes varying the value of the forgetting factors based on the signal-<br>
to-noise ratio.<br>
[0011] In yet another aspect of the present invention the recursive least<br>
squares estimator holds the road grade near constant and calculates the vehicle<br>
mass from the tractive effort when the motor vehicle is in a startup condition.<br>
[0012] In yet another aspect of the present invention the startup<br>
condition begins when the vehicle is first started and ends when the engine and<br>
transmission temperatures increase to a pre-defined amount.<br>
[0013] In still another aspect of the present invention the recursive<br>
least squares estimator accumulates tractive effort calculations over time, holds<br>
the road grade near constant, and calculates the vehicle mass from the tractive<br>
effort when the startup condition has ended.<br>
[0014] In still another aspect of the present invention the recursive<br>
least squares estimator accumulates tractive effort calculations over time, allows<br>
the road grade value to change, and allows the vehicle mass to change when the<br>
3<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
signal-to-noise ratio exceeds the threshold and the calculated vehicle mass is<br>
within an allowable limit.<br>
[0015] In yet another aspect of the present invention the recursive least<br>
squares estimator accumulates tractive effort calculations over time, allows the<br>
road grade value to change, and holds the vehicle mass near constant when the<br>
signal-to-noise ratio exceeds the threshold, the calculated vehicle mass is within<br>
an allowable limit, and engine torque is above a calibrated value.<br>
[0016] In yet another aspect of the present invention the step of<br>
selecting a vehicle mass includes selecting a vehicle mass from the last vehicle<br>
mass calculated by the recursive least squares estimator when the signal-to-<br>
noise ratio exceeded the threshold.<br>
[0017] In yet another aspect of the present invention the step of<br>
selecting a shift schedule includes selecting between an economy shift schedule<br>
and a performance shift schedule.<br>
[0018] In yet another aspect of the present invention the method<br>
includes the step of calculating a road load mass factor from the vehicle mass,<br>
the road grade, and acceleration due to gravity prior to selecting a shift schedule.<br>
[0019] In yet another aspect of the present invention the method<br>
includes the step of normalizing the road load mass factor and selecting a shift<br>
schedule based on the normalized road load mass factor.<br>
[0020] In yet another aspect of the present invention a performance<br>
shift schedule is selected when the vehicle mass and road grade are unknown.<br>
4<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
[0021] In yet another aspect of the present invention the signal-to-noise<br>
ratio is less than the threshold when the motor vehicle is braking.<br>
[0022] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0027] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0028] With reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B, a method for selecting a<br>
shift schedule for an automatic transmission in a motor vehicle is generally<br>
indicated by reference number 10. The motor vehicle (not shown) generally<br>
5<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
includes a powertrain having an engine and an automatic transmission. As the<br>
motor vehicle travels, the grade of the road may vary from a flat grade to a steep<br>
grade, depending on the given route. Additionally, the mass of the motor vehicle<br>
may change due to fluctuations in the amount of passengers, luggage, stored<br>
items, or the presence of trailers or other towed objects. The method 10<br>
estimates the road grade and vehicle mass at any given instant in order to select<br>
a shift schedule that meets the needs of the operator of the motor vehicle.<br>
Accordingly, the method 10 runs continuously in real-time.<br>
[0029] The method 10 begins at step 11 where a controller determines<br>
whether a service brake has been applied or whether engine torque is near zero<br>
net torque. The controller may be an engine controller or transmission controller,<br>
or any other electronic device having a preprogrammed digital computer or<br>
processor, control logic, memory used to store data, and at least one I/O section.<br>
The control logic includes a plurality of logic routines for monitoring,<br>
manipulating, and generating data. If the service brake has been applied or if<br>
engine torque is near zero, the method 10 proceeds to step 12 where a vehicle<br>
mass and road grade slowly filtered to zero are selected. The vehicle mass is<br>
taken from the last estimated vehicle mass calculated in a prior iteration of the<br>
method 10 when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeded a threshold. As such, it is<br>
assumed to be a fairly accurate vehicle mass. The road grade is taken from the<br>
last estimated road grade calculated in a prior iteration of the method 10 when<br>
the signal-to-noise ratio exceeded the threshold and. To slowly filter the last<br>
6<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
estimated road grade to zero, the road grade is passed through a first-order lag<br>
filter with a slow time constant, such as, for example, 15 seconds.<br>
[0030] If the service brake has not been applied and/or the engine<br>
torque is not near zero, the method proceeds to step 13 where the controller<br>
determines whether a signal-to-noise ratio exceeds a threshold. The signal-to-<br>
noise ratio represents the quality of data measured from the motor vehicle. A<br>
good signal-to-noise ratio occurs when the acceleration is not equal to zero, the<br>
engine torque is not near zero, and/or there is no braking. The threshold is a<br>
pre-defined calibrated value.<br>
[0031] If the calculated signal-to-noise ratio is greater than the<br>
threshold, then the method 10 proceeds to step 14 where vehicle mass and road<br>
grade are estimated using a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) estimator with<br>
multiple forgetting. The RLS estimator is a process or program that uses<br>
accumulation of measured data and multiple forgetting to calculate an estimated<br>
vehicle mass and an estimated road grade. A RLS estimator is described in<br>
"Recursive Least Squares with Forgetting for Online Estimation of Vehicle Mass<br>
and Road Grade: Theory and Experiments", by Vahidi, Stefanopoulou, and Peng,<br>
published in Vehicle System Dynamics, Vol. 43, No. 1 (January 2005), hereby<br>
incorporated by reference as if fully disclosed herein. The RLS estimator uses a<br>
plurality of measured vehicle parameters and known vehicle constants to<br>
estimate in real-time the vehicle mass and the current road grade that the vehicle<br>
is traveling on. The basic relationship between vehicle mass and road grade<br>
may be represented by the following equation:<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
(1)	Ma = ((Te - Jew)/rg) - Ffe - Faero - Fgrade;<br>
[0032] wherein M is the mass of the vehicle, a is the acceleration of the<br>
vehicle calculated from the change in vehicle speed over time, Te is the engine<br>
torque, Jew is the portion of torque used to rotate the powertrain, rg is wheel<br>
radius divided by total gear ratio (constant for a given vehicle), Ffb is the force of<br>
braking, Faero is the force do to aerodynamic drag, and Fgrade is the force due to<br>
the road grade. The actual road grade may be calculated from the following<br>
equation:<br>
(2)	Fgrade = M * g * (u * cos p + sin (3);<br>
[0033] wherein u is the rolling resistance of the road and p is the road<br>
grade. Accordingly, p = 0 corresponds to no road inclination, p &gt; 0 corresponds<br>
to an uphill grade, and p 
be employed to increase the accuracy of the estimation include input and output<br>
PTO activation status, engine coolant temperature, and fan torque loss. The<br>
RLS Estimator uses least recursive squares analysis with multiple forgetting with<br>
equation (1) to calculate in real-time an estimated vehicle mass (M) and an<br>
estimated road grade (P), as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0034] If the calculated signal-to-noise ratio is less than the threshold,<br>
then the method 10 proceeds to step 16 where the controller selects a vehicle<br>
mass. The selected vehicle mass is taken from the last estimated vehicle mass<br>
calculated at step 14 when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeded the threshold. As<br>
such, it is assumed to be a fairly accurate vehicle mass.<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
[0035] Next, an estimated grade is calculated using a grade estimator<br>
at step 18. The grade estimator uses the selected vehicle mass determined in<br>
step 16 to calculate the road grade from equation (1).<br>
[0036] Once the vehicle mass and road grade have been estimated at<br>
either steps 11, 14, or step 18, a road load mass (RLM) factor is calculated at<br>
step 20. The RLM factor is calculated using the following equation:<br>
(3)	RLM factor = M * (1 + g * sin(B).<br>
[0037] The RLM factor is then normalized at step 22 to either a "0" or a<br>
"1". If the vehicle is in a start-up condition where vehicle mass and road grade<br>
cannot be accurately estimated, the RLM factor is normalized to a default setting<br>
that corresponds to a performance shift schedule.<br>
[0038] At step 24, a shift schedule is selected based on the normalized<br>
RLM factor calculated at step 22. In the particular example provided, a<br>
normalized RLM factor of "0" indicates that the transmission should use a<br>
performance shift schedule which optimizes shifting performance while a<br>
normalized RLM factor of "1" indicates that the transmission should use an<br>
economy shift schedule which optimizes fuel economy. Moreover, the present<br>
invention contemplates that any normalized RLM factor between "0" and "1" can<br>
be used to interpolate between the two shift schedules. Therefore, it should be<br>
appreciated that any normalized factor may correspond to a specific shift<br>
schedule. In addition, while in the particular example provided only two shift<br>
schedules have been employed, it should be appreciated that any number of shift<br>
schedules may be used so long as each shift schedule corresponds to a<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
normalized value. During startup conditions where the vehicle is first turned on,<br>
a performance schedule is automatically selected.<br>
[0039] Turning now to FIG. 2, a control signal diagram is indicated<br>
generally by reference number 100. The control signal diagram 100 is a<br>
algorithmic representation of the method 10 described in FIG. 1. The control<br>
signal diagram 100 includes a plurality of measured inputs 102 used to calculate<br>
the mass of the vehicle and the road grade. These inputs 102 include engine<br>
torque, vehicle speed, and internal transmission control module signals. An RLS<br>
estimator process 104 then uses the inputs 102 to estimate the vehicle mass and<br>
road grade using least recursive squares with multiple forgetting. As noted<br>
above, the RLS estimation process is described in the paper entitled "Recursive<br>
Least Squares with Forgetting for Online Estimation of Vehicle Mass and Road<br>
Grade: Theory and Experiments", by Vahidi, Stefanopoulou, and Peng. The<br>
multiple forgetting process includes assigning a scalar or weighted value to the<br>
vehicle mass and road grade in order to "forget" old data that may be less<br>
accurate. This scalar is referred to as a forgetting factor and is indicated by "A" in<br>
the above referenced paper and in FIG. 3.<br>
[0040] The RLS estimator 104 of the present invention changes these<br>
forgetting factors based on whether the vehicle has first started up and also on<br>
the quality of the signal-to-noise ratio. A table of these factors and conditions for<br>
transition from one level of convergence to another is shown in FIG. 3. For each<br>
level of convergence, two separate forgetting factors A are given. It should be<br>
appreciated that these forgetting factors A are exemplary and may be changed<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
for a given application. At the first level of convergence during startup of the<br>
motor vehicle (Row 1), the road grade is held constant while the tractive effort is<br>
calculated with no accumulation of data. Since the mass of the vehicle is<br>
unknown at startup and the road grade is also unknown at startup, the RLS<br>
estimator 104 assumes the road grade does not change and attempts to<br>
calculate the vehicle mass from the measured tractive effort. The tractive effort<br>
corresponds to the summation of the inputs 102 used in equation (1). An<br>
accurate tractive effort may be calculated even when a torque converter is<br>
operating. The RLS estimator 104 at the first level of convergence (Row 1)<br>
allows the value of the vehicle mass to vary greatly as the tractive effort changes<br>
during driving.<br>
[0041] Once the engine and transmission have warmed up (for<br>
example, to 25 to 30 degrees Celsius), the RLS estimator 104 transitions to the<br>
next level of convergence (Row 2). Here, road grade is held fairly constant,<br>
vehicle mass is allowed to vary, and accumulation of data over time is stored and<br>
used in subsequent calculations.<br>
[0042] The RLS estimator 104 transitions to the next level of<br>
convergence (Row 3) once the RLS estimator has had a specified number of<br>
calculations with data taken when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds the threshold<br>
value and the calculated vehicle mass falls within an allowable limit. This level of<br>
convergence reduces how widely the mass of the vehicle changes while allowing<br>
the road grade to have a larger change.<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
[0043] Finally, the RLS estimator 104 transitions to the fourth level of<br>
convergence (Row 4) when a specified number of similar vehicle mass estimates<br>
have been calculated using different data sets over time. This occurs when there<br>
is a good signal-to-noise ratio and when engine torque is above a calibrated<br>
value during the entire dataset. In this level of convergence, the mass of the<br>
vehicle is held fairly constant, reflecting a high level of confidence that the<br>
changing measured tractive effort is due to change in road grade conditions, not<br>
a change in vehicle mass. Accordingly, the road grade is allowed to vary greatly<br>
as the tractive effort changes and accumulation of data continues.<br>
[0044] Returning to FIG. 2, calculated vehicle mass estimates and road<br>
grade estimates are then processed through function 106 to calculate the road<br>
load mass factor. In the particular example provided, a minimum limiter is used<br>
to produce a positive grade estimate. However, this minimum limiter is optional<br>
and may be removed to allow a vehicle going downhill (negative grade slope) to<br>
select an economy shift schedule rather than a default performance shift<br>
schedule. An Eta or efficiency calculator 108 then normalizes the RLM factor to<br>
allow the transmission or powertrain controller to select the shift schedule, as<br>
previously described in FIG. 1.<br>
[0045] Where the signal-to-noise ratio does not exceed the threshold,<br>
the RLS estimator 104 is suspended and a grade estimator 110 calculates the<br>
road grade from the tractive effort using the selected mass estimate from the<br>
most recent RLS estimate when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeded the threshold.<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
The selected vehicle mass and calculated grade estimate are then processed by<br>
the function 106 and normalized by the Eta calculator 108.<br>
[0046] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

limit.<br>
10.	The method of claim 9 wherein the recursive least squares estimator<br>
accumulates tractive effort calculations over time, allows the road grade value to<br>
change, and holds the vehicle mass near constant when the signal-to-noise ratio<br>
exceeds the threshold, the calculated vehicle mass is within an allowable limit,<br>
and engine torque is above a calibrated value.<br>
11.	The method of claim 5 wherein the step of selecting a vehicle mass<br>
includes selecting a vehicle mass from the last vehicle mass calculated by the<br>
recursive least squares estimator when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeded the<br>
threshold.<br>
12.	The method of claim 11 wherein the step of selecting a shift schedule<br>
includes selecting between an economy shift schedule and a performance shift<br>
schedule.<br>
13.	The method of claim 12 further comprising the step of calculating a<br>
road load mass factor from the vehicle mass, the road grade, and acceleration<br>
due to gravity prior to selecting a shift schedule.<br>
16<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000775-PTA-DLT<br>
14.	The method of claim 13 further comprising the step of normalizing the<br>
road load mass factor and selecting a shift schedule based on the normalized<br>
road load mass factor.<br>
17<br>
15.	The method of claim 1 wherein a performance shift schedule is<br>
selected when the vehicle mass and road grade are unknown.<br>
16.	The method of claim 1 wherein the signal-to-noise ratio is less than<br>
the threshold when the motor vehicle is braking.<br><br>
A method for selecting a shift schedule for a transmission in a motor<br>
vehicle is provided. The method includes the steps of determining whether a<br>
signal-to-noise ratio exceeds a threshold and calculating a tractive effort of the<br>
motor vehicle. A vehicle mass and a road grade is then estimated from the<br>
tractive effort using a recursive least squares estimator with multiple forgetting<br>
when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds the threshold. A vehicle mass is selected<br>
and the road grade estimated from the vehicle mass and tractive effort when the<br>
signal-to-noise ratio does not exceed the threshold. A shift schedule is then<br>
selected based on the vehicle mass and the estimated road grade.<br></td>
