PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF PYRAZOLE-FUSED RING DERIVATIVES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing pyrazole-fused ring derivatives (such as<br>
pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives and the like) useful as synthesis intermediates of pyrazole-fused ring derivatives (such as 7-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives and the like) useful for prevention or treatment of depression, anxiety and the like as a corticotrophin-releasing-factor (CRF) receptor antagonist, and pyrazole-fused ring derivatives (such as 7-iodopyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives and the like) or salts thereof, or solvates thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
There are reports on (1) 7-phenylpyrazolo [1, 5-a]pyridine derivatives and a method for producing the same (see Patent Documents 1 and 2), (2) 7-phenylpyrazolopyrimidine derivatives and a method for producing the same (see Patent Document 3) and (3) 7-phenylpyrazolotriazine derivatives and a method for producing the same (see Patent Document 4), which have a CRF receptor antagonistic action and expected as a therapeutic agent for depression, anxiety and the like.<br>
Regarding a step of a halogenating reaction and a step of an amino group introducing reaction in the methods for producing pyrazole-fused ring derivatives (7-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives and the like)<br><br>
described in the documents, the following points are mentioned as problems in the case of use for industrial production.<br>
(1)	In the step of a halogenating reaction, purification by column chromatography is used after reaction.<br>
(2)	In the step of a halogenating reaction,<br>
1,2-diiodoethane which is not so suitable for industrial production is used as a halogenating reagent.<br>
(3)	Regarding the step of a halogenating reaction, there is a lot of examples showing a yield of 60 to 70% in an iodination reaction of a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivative using<br>
1,2-diiodoethane, revealing unsatisfactory yields. (see Patent Document 2)<br>
(4)	In the step of introducing an amino group into a pyrazole-fused ring derivative (pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine ring and the like), a reduction reaction-alkylation reaction after a nitration reaction is used or a Crutius reaction from a carboxylic acid derivative is used; however, these reactions show poor yields and reaction steps thereof are long. Further, a 3-aminopyrazopyridine compound which is an intermediate in these reactions is unstable, and is not suitable as an intermediate in an industrial synthesis method.<br>
Taking the above-described points into consideration, the production methods described in the documents are not satisfactory as an industrial production method.<br>
A compound represented by following formula, which is a 7-iodopyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivative or a salt thereof, or a solvate thereof, is a novel compound and is not known until<br><br>
now.<br><br>
[Regarding iodination reaction]<br>
Although pentafluoroiodobenzene is a known compound, there is no example using pentafluoroiodobenzene as a reagent in an iodination reaction. Regarding an iodination reaction step of a pyrazole-fused ring derivative<br>
(pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivative and the like), it is reported that n-butyllithium and 1,2-diiodoethane as described above (see Patent Documents 1 and 2) were used.<br>
[Regarding an amidation reaction by a coupling reaction to a bi-cyclic heteroaromatic compound]<br>
Regarding a reaction for amidating an aryl halide using a copper catalyst, Buchwald et al. made a report (see Non-Patent Document 1). However, there is known no amidation reaction by a coupling reaction to a bi-cyclic heteroaromatic compound such as pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine and the like.<br>
