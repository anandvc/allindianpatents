				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING OPERATIONAL<br>
STATES OF MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL LAYER IN A<br>
BROADBAND WIRELESS ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system, and more particularly to an apparatus and a method for<br>
controlling the operational states of a medium access control layer.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
A 4th generation ('4G') communication system, which is a next<br>
generation communication system, is being actively designed and studied in<br>
order to provide users with services having various Qualities of Service ('QoS')<br>
at a high transmission rate. Meanwhile, a wireless local area network ('LAN')<br>
system and a wireless metropolitan area network ('MAN') system generally<br>
provide transmission speeds of about 20 Mbps to 50 Mbps. Therefore, the<br>
current 4G communication system is developing into a system that assures<br>
mobility and a QoS in the wireless LAN and MAN systems which inturn assure a<br>
relatively-high transmission speed.<br>
In the following description, the broadband wireless access<br>
communication system will be explained with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 1 is a view showing a construction of a general broadband wireless<br>
access communication system.<br>
Prior to the explanation of FIG. 1, it is noted that a wireless MAN system<br>
is a type of broadband wireless access communication system capable of<br>
providing a wider service coverage area and a higher transmission speed than that<br>
of a wireless LAN system. An IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers) 802.16a communication system applies an orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme and an orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexing access (OFDMA) scheme to a physical channel of the wireless<br>
MAN system in order to support a broadband transmission network. Since the<br>
IEEE 802.16a communication system applies the OFDM/OFDMA scheme to the<br>
wireless MAM system, the IEEE 802.16a communication system transmits a<br>
physical channel signal by using a plurality of sub-carriers, so that it is possible<br>
to transmit high-speed data. Meanwhile, an IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system is achieved by supplementing the above-described IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system to enable the mobility of an access terminal (AT).<br>
However, currently, the IEEE 802.16e communication system has not been<br>
standardized in detail.<br>
Both IEEE 802.16a and IEEE 802.16e communication systems are<br>
broadband wireless access communication systems using the OFDM/OFDMA<br>
scheme. For the convenience of explanation, only the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system will be described below as an example. The IEEE<br>
802.16a and IEEE 802.16e communication systems can use either the<br>
OFDM/OFDMA scheme or a single carrier(SC) scheme, but the following<br>
description will be given in consideration of only the OFDM/OFDMA scheme.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the IEEE 802.16a communication system has a<br>
single cell structure and includes an access point (AP) 100 and a plurality of<br>
access terminals 110, 120, and 130 which are managed by the access point 100.<br>
The access point conducts signal communications with the access terminals 110,<br>
120, and 130 by using the OFDM/OFDMA scheme.<br>
The wireless MAN system is suitable for high-speed communication<br>
services because it has a wide service coverage area and provides a high<br>
transmission speed. However, since the wireless MAN system does not take<br>
into consideration the user's mobility, that is the mobility of an access terminal,<br>
handoff according to high-speed mobility of the access terminal is also not taken<br>
into consideration in the wireless MAN system. It is therefore necessary to<br>
develop a definite operation scheme of a medium access control ('MAC') layer<br>
which minimize power consumption of an access terminal moving at a high<br>
speed and" supports an operation for a high-speed packet data transmission<br>
between the access terminal and an access point.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of an apparatus and a method for<br>
controlling operational states of a medium access control (MAC) layer in a<br>
broadband wireless access communication system according to the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In<br>
the following description of the present invention, a detailed description of<br>
known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it<br>
may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
The present invention proposes a scheme for controlling the operational<br>
states of the MAC layer in the broadband wireless access communication system.<br>
Particularly, the control scheme for the operational states of the MAC layer,<br>
which is proposed in the present invention, supports the mobility of an access<br>
terminal (AT), and enables a fast access while minimizing the power<br>
consumption of the access terminal.<br>
First, in order to support the operational states of the MAC layer the<br>
present invention proposes new downlink channels and new uplink channels<br>
and the newly proposed downlink channels and uplink channels will be described<br>
with reference to Table 1.<br><br>
A description will be given for each of downlink channels shown in Table<br>
1.<br>
(1) Pilot Channel ('DL-PICH')<br>
The DL-PICH is a channel for cell identification and for the<br>
synchronization acquisition between an access point (AP) and an access terminal.<br>
The access point may manage either a plurality of cells or only one cell, but, in<br>
the following description, it is assumed for the convenience of explanation that<br>
one access point manages only one cell. Therefore, it should be noted that the<br>
term "cell" will be used as having the same meaning as that of the term "access<br>
point". The access terminal receives the DL-PICH signals transmitted from a<br>
plurality of access points after being powered on, and determines which access<br>
point transmits a DL-PICH signal of the greatest power level, for example a DL-<br>
PICH signal having the greatest carrier-to-interference-and-noise ratio ('CINR'),<br>
from among the received DL-PICH signals as the access point to which the<br>
access terminal belongs. In the following description about downlink channels,<br>
it should be noted that the acronym 'DL' is commonly used to represent<br>
'downlink channel'.<br>
(2) Broadcast Channel ('DL-BCCH')<br>
The DL-BCCH is a channel for transmitting the system configuration<br>
information related to the broadband wireless access communication system,<br>
neighbor cell information, the downlink and uplink channel configuration<br>
information, the downlink and uplink access information, the paging information<br>
representing that there is a call to a specific access terminal, the slot index<br>
information of a wake-up channel ('DL-WUCH'). An access terminal has to<br>
monitor the DL-WUCH so as to perform a mode shifting operation from a<br>
sleeping mode of a sleeping state to an awake mode, etc.<br>
The sleeping mode is a mode for minimizing the power consumption in<br>
such a manner that the access terminal monitors only the DL-WUCH and then<br>
monitors the DL-BCCH only when the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH<br>
allocated into the access terminal itself is turned on. The awake mode is a mode<br>
in which the access terminal monitors a DL-BCCH, which is transmitted from the<br>
access point, to determine whether or not the system information is updated or<br>
paging information is received. The detailed operations of the sleeping mode<br>
and the awake mode have no direct connection with the present invention, and<br>
the detailed description of them will be omitted herein. When the system<br>
configuration information, the downlink and uplink channel configuration<br>
information, the downlink and uplink access information, and the like are<br>
changed, the access point updates the changed information and periodically<br>
transmits the updated information to an access terminal through the DL-BCCH.<br>
In addition, a response to the uplink access is also transmitted through the DL-<br>
BCCH. The DL-BCCH is established as a super frame unit, and the information<br>
is periodically and repeatedly transmitted in a super frame unit. Herein the<br>
super frame includes a predetermined number of frames.<br>
When the access point determines that a slot index of a DL-WUCH,<br>
which an access terminal monitors to perform a mode shifting operation from a<br>
sleeping mode of a sleeping state to an awake mode, the access point allocates a<br>
particular slot index of the DL-WUCH to each of the access terminals managed<br>
by the access point, and maintains the allocated slot index of the DL-WUCH<br>
until the access terminal is handed off to a new access point. The number of<br>
slot indexes of the DL-WUCH to be allocated by the access point may change<br>
depending on the configuration of the DL-WUCH, and the present invention does<br>
not involve the configuration of the DL-WUCH, so the detailed description of<br>
that will be omitted herein.<br>
(3) Downlink-Uplink Scheduling Channel ('DL-USCCH')<br>
The DL-USCCH is a channel which transmits the scheduling information<br>
for the transmission of an uplink traffic channel ('UL-TCH') and control<br>
information related to an uplink, such as an adaptive-modulation-and-coding<br>
( 'AMC') scheme. Particularly, through the DL-USCCH, a bandwidth<br>
allocation response message is transmitted in response to a bandwidth allocation<br>
request message. When it is necessary for the access terminal to transmit traffic<br>
through an uplink, the access terminal transmits a bandwidth allocation request<br>
message for the uplink traffic transmission to the access point through an uplink<br>
access channel ('UL-ACH'), and monitors whether or not a bandwidth allocation<br>
response message, which is a response message to the bandwidth allocation<br>
request message, is received from the access point through the DL-USCCH.<br>
When receiving a bandwidth allocation response message through the DL-<br>
USCCH, the access terminal transmits the traffic through an uplink according to<br>
the control information included in the bandwidth allocation response message.<br>
When the access terminal performs a connection establishment operation<br>
for traffic transmission to an access point, if there is a predetermined convention,<br>
the access point may continuously allocate a predetermined bandwidth to the<br>
access terminal although the access terminal does not transmit an additional<br>
bandwidth allocation request message through an uplink. The access terminal<br>
may transmit traffic data through the allocated bandwidth, and may transmit a<br>
bandwidth allocation request message for data to be transmitted through the UL-<br>
TCH in a contention-free scheme method. Then, the access terminal determine<br>
the allocation information of an uplink by monitoring the DL-USCCH. In order<br>
to transmit traffic data to the access point through the UL-TCH, the access<br>
terminal must also continuously monitor the DL-USCCH to monitor for<br>
information about bandwidth allocation performed by the access point.<br>
(4) Traffic Channel ('DL-TCH')<br>
The DL-TCH is a channel for transmitting the actual packet data.<br>
According to the characteristics of packet data to be transmitted, three logical<br>
channels may be mapped in the DL-TCH as described below.<br>
a. Burst Traffic Channel<br>
The burst traffic channel is a logical channel for transmitting burst traffic,<br>
in which the burst traffic is transmitted in a time-shared scheme that provides a<br>
burst-based dynamic allocation scheme based on a dynamic scheduling scheme.<br>
A description will be given for service classes, that is the Qualities of Service<br>
('QoS'), of the broadband wireless access communication system with reference<br>
to Table 2.<br><br>
Through the burst traffic channel, the real-time service data are<br>
scheduled to be transmitted, the non-real-time service data are transmitted, or the<br>
best effect service data are transmitted.<br>
b. Dedicated Traffic Channel<br>
The dedicated traffic channel is a channel for allocating a fixed minimum<br>
bandwidth. Data, such the (UGS data, to which a minimum bandwidth is<br>
continuously allocated are transmitted through the dedicated traffic channel.<br>
c. Signaling Channel<br>
The signaling channel is a channel for transmitting a signaling message<br>
which is control information.<br>
(5) Traffic Control Channel ('DL-TCCH')<br>
The DL-TCCH is a channel for transmitting the control information for<br>
an access terminal to efficiently process the data transmitted through the DL-<br>
TCH, that is the control information related to the DL-TCH. The DL-TCCH is<br>
always transmitted in connection with the DL-TCH. The control information<br>
transmitted through the DL-TCH includes AMC scheme information applied to<br>
the data transmitted through the DL-TCH, information used in the data decoding<br>
such as encoded packet size ('EP') information, an MAC control message, etc.<br>
Also, the access point may feedback AMC scheme information related to the<br>
packet data, which is transmitted through an uplink, to the access terminal<br>
through the DL-TCCH.<br>
(6) Wake Up Channel ('DL-WUCH')<br>
The DL-WUCH, which is a channel for minimizing the power<br>
consumption of an access terminal, is monitored by the access terminal in a<br>
sleeping mode of a sleeping state. A wake-up indicator exists in a specific part<br>
of the DL-WUCH, the access terminal performs a mode shifting operation from<br>
the sleeping mode to an awake mode according to whether the wake-up indicator<br>
is turned on or off. That the wake-up indicator is turned on represents that the<br>
value of the wake-up indicator is set to a first value, for example, 'one', and in<br>
contrast, that the wake-up indicator is turned off represents that the value of<br>
wake-up indicator is set to a second value, for example, 'zero'. Also, the DL-<br>
WUCH is transmitted as a super frame unit like the DL-BCCH.<br>
The above description with reference to Table 2 has defined the downlink<br>
channels proposed in the present invention. The uplink channels proposed in<br>
the present invention will be described with reference to Table 3.<br><br>
Each uplink channel shown in Table 3 will now be described.<br>
(1) Access Channel ('UL-ACH')<br>
The UL-ACH is a channel used by an access terminal when the access<br>
terminal transmits a bandwidth allocation request signal to request a bandwidth<br>
allocation, for the purpose of data transmission through an uplink, that is, for the<br>
purpose of uplink access. According to the grade of the access terminal or the<br>
characteristics of data to be transmitted through the uplink, two logical channels<br>
as described below may be mapped to the UL-ACH.<br>
a. Access Channel<br>
The access channel is a channel for uplink access of a contention-based<br>
scheme, and is used when the access terminal enters a network or when the<br>
access terminal requests a bandwidth allocation. Through the access channel, a<br>
very small amount of data, such as a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)<br>
ACK/NACK signal, may be transmitted together with an uplink access request<br>
signal (access preamble + packet data).<br>
b. Fast Access Channel<br>
The fast access channel is a channel for the uplink access of a contention-<br>
free scheme. An orthogonal code, such as a pseudorandom noise (PN) code, or<br>
a time slot position, which is used for the uplink access, is allocated to an access<br>
terminal from an access point. Then, the access terminal performs the uplink<br>
access through the fast access channel using the orthogonal code or the time slot<br>
position allocated from the access point. In the following description, a PN<br>
code which is used for the uplink access through the UL-FACCH, that is, for fast<br>
access, is called a 'fast access PN code', and a time slot used for the fast access is<br>
called a 'fast access time slot'. The fast access PN code and the fast access time<br>
slot will be described later in detail.<br>
(2) Traffic Channel ('UL-TCH')<br>
The UL-TCH is a channel used when an access terminal transmits data to<br>
an access point. According to the characteristics of the data transmitted through<br>
the UL-TCH, three logical channels may be mapped in the UL-TCH as described<br>
above. Herein, the traffic channel is also included to the downlink channels as<br>
described above. For convenience of description, the traffic channel of an<br>
uplink is called an 'UL-TCH'.<br>
a. Burst Traffic Channel<br>
The burst traffic channel has the same function as that of the burst traffic<br>
channel mapped to the DL-TCH, and has only one difference in that the burst<br>
traffic channel is mapped not to the DL-TCH but to the UL-TCH, and so, a<br>
detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
b. Dedicated Traffic Channel<br>
The dedicated traffic channel has the same function as that of the<br>
dedicated traffic channel mapped to the DL-TCH, and has only one difference in<br>
that the dedicated traffic channel is mapped not to the DL-TCH but in the UL-<br>
TCH, and so, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
c. Signaling Channel<br>
The signaling channel has the same function as that of the signaling<br>
channel mapped to the DL-TCH, and has only one difference in that the signaling<br>
channel is mapped not to the DL-TCH but to the UL-TCH, and so, a detailed<br>
description thereof will be omitted.<br>
Hereinafter, a description will be given for the MAC operational states<br>
for performing the actual operations, with reference to FIG. 2, using the newly<br>
proposed downlink and uplink channels in the present invention as described in<br>
Tables 1 and 3.<br>
FIG. 2 is a state diagram showing the operational states supported by a<br>
MAC layer in a broadband wireless access communication system according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the MAC layer of the broadband wireless access<br>
communication system proposed in the present invention supports five types of<br>
operational states, that is, a null state 211, an initialization state 213, a sleeping<br>
state 215, an access state 217, and a traffic state 219. The operational states of<br>
the MAC layer proposed in the present invention supports the mobility of an<br>
access terminal (AT), and enables the fast access while minimizing the power<br>
consumption of the access terminal.<br>
Each of the operational states of the MAC layer will now be described.<br>
First, a description will be given for the null state 211. The null state<br>
211 is a state to perform an initial operation, when an access terminal is powered<br>
on, or when the access terminal is reset by an abnormal operation. It is possible<br>
that the state transition can be performed from each of the initialization state 213,<br>
the sleeping state 215, the access state 217, and the traffic state 219, into the null<br>
state 211. As described above, when the access terminal normally performs an<br>
initial operation following a reset or power-on of the access terminal, the access<br>
terminal performs a state transition from the null state 211 into the initialization<br>
state 213.<br>
Secondly, a description will be given for the initialization state 213. In<br>
the initialization state 213, when having normally completed an initial operation<br>
following a reset or power-on, the access terminal performs a synchronization<br>
acquisition operation with an access point. In order to perform a<br>
synchronization acquisition operation with the access point, the access terminal<br>
monitors all frequency bands, which are predetermined in the access terminal,<br>
and detects a DL-PICH signal having the greatest intensity, that is, having the<br>
greatest CINR. When the access terminal is handed off from a cell in which the<br>
access terminal itself exists, that is, from a prior access point, to a new cell, that is,<br>
to a target access point, the access terminal also performs a synchronization<br>
acquisition operation with the target access point in the initialization state 213.<br>
In an IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.16a<br>
communication system, which is a typical broadband wireless access<br>
communication system, since the mobility of the access terminal is not<br>
considered, it is enough to consider only the case in which the access terminal is<br>
powered on or is reset. In contrast, in a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system that considers the mobility of the access terminal, such as<br>
an IEEE 802.16e communication system, since the mobility of the access<br>
terminal is considered, not only the case in which the access terminal is powered<br>
on or is reset but also the case in which the access terminal is handed off has to<br>
be considered. Therefore, an apparatus and a method of the present invention is<br>
constructed taking into consideration not only the case in which the access<br>
terminal is powered on or is reset, but also the case in which the access terminal<br>
is handed off. That is, the access terminal has to continuously monitor whether<br>
or not there is a second access point which transmits a DL-PICH signal having a<br>
greater CINR than that of a DL-PICH signal transmitted from a first access point<br>
to which the access terminal currently belongs, by considering a hand-off state.<br>
Under a continuous monitoring operation, when there is a second access point<br>
which transmits a DL-PICH signal having a greater CINR than that of a DL-<br>
PICH signal transmitted from a first access point to which the access terminal<br>
currently belongs, the access terminal performs a cell reselection operation.<br>
The access terminal, which has acquired synchronization with the access<br>
point, receives a DL-BCCH signal transmitted from the access point to receive<br>
the system information (SI). Next, the access terminal performs a network entry<br>
operation for the registration and the authentication to the access point to perform<br>
an operation for transmitting/receiving normal packet data to/from the access<br>
point, and then performs a state transition into the sleeping state 215, the access<br>
state 217, or the traffic state 219. The system information includes system<br>
configuration information, neighbor access point information, downlink and<br>
uplink channel configuration information, and downlink and uplink access<br>
information.<br>
In the initialization state 213, when the access terminal loses its<br>
synchronization with the access point due to a problem, such as a system error,<br>
the access terminal performs a state transition from the initialization state 213<br>
into the null state 211, thereby performing an initial operation again. That is,<br>
when the access terminal is reset due to a problem, such as a system error, it is<br>
necessary that the access terminal starts its operation in the null state 211. The<br>
access terminal also performs a state transition from the initialization state 213<br>
into the traffic state 219 when the access terminal receives paging information to<br>
represent that there is data transmitted from the access terminal to the access<br>
point after performing a network entry operation for the registration and the<br>
authentication to the access point.<br>
The operation of an access terminal in the initialization state 213 will be<br>
simplified as follows.<br>
(1) DL-PICH monitoring and synchronization acquisition with the access<br>
point<br>
(2) DL-BCCH monitoring operation<br>
Receiving system configuration information, neighbor access point<br>
information, downlink and uplink channel configuration information, and<br>
downlink and uplink access information, paging information representing that<br>
there is a call to an access terminal, and slot index information of a DL-WUCH<br>
which an access terminal has to monitor to perform a mode shifting operation<br>
from a sleeping mode to an awake mode.<br>
(3) Network entry operation for the registration and the authentication to<br>
the access point<br>
In the network entry operation, the access terminal uses the UL-ACH<br>
when performing an uplink access to an access point. A response signal to the<br>
uplink access, which relates to a network entry operation and is performed<br>
through the UL-ACH, is received through the DL-BCCH.<br>
Thirdly, a description will be given for the sleeping state 215. The case<br>
in which the access terminal performs a state transition from the initialization<br>
state 213 into the sleeping state 215 occurs when the access terminal has no data<br>
to be transmitted/received to/from an access point after performing a network<br>
entry operation in the initialization state 213. That is, after the access terminal<br>
performs a network entry operation in the initialization state 213, if there is no<br>
data transmitted/received between the access terminal and the access point, the<br>
access terminal performs a state transition into the sleeping state 215 so as to<br>
minimize power consumption.<br>
In the sleeping state 215, the access terminal wakes up according to the<br>
control of the access point, and the access point notifies the access terminal to<br>
wake-up as instructed through the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH. That is,<br>
when the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH is turned on, the access terminal<br>
wakes up. The access terminal can recognizes a slot index of a position into<br>
which an indicator of the DL-WUCH is inserted, through the DL-BCCH in the<br>
initialization state 213. One access point allocates a particular slot index of a<br>
position, into which an indicator of the DL-WUCH is inserted, as described<br>
above, into each of the access terminals, and the allocated slot index of the DL-<br>
WUCH is maintained until the access terminal is handed off to a new access<br>
point. In the sleeping state 215, the access terminal does not continuously<br>
monitor the DL-BCCH so as to minimize the power consumption but monitors<br>
only the DL-WUCH. Then, the access terminal wakes up to monitor the DL-<br>
BCCH only when the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH is turned on, thereby<br>
minimizing the power consumption. Also, while the access terminal is<br>
monitoring the DL-BCCH, the access terminal does not monitor the DL-WUCH.<br>
Also, while monitoring the DL-BCCH in the sleeping state 215, if the<br>
access terminal receives information representing that there is a paging to be<br>
received by the access terminal, the access terminal performs a state transition<br>
from the sleeping state 215 into the traffic state 219, to receive the data from the<br>
access point. In the sleeping state 215, when the access terminal loses its<br>
synchronization with the access point due to a problem, such as a system error,<br>
the access terminal performs a state transition from the sleeping state 215 into the<br>
null state 211, thereby performing an initial operation again. That is, when the<br>
access terminal is reset due to a problem, such as a system error, it is necessary<br>
that the access terminal restart its operation in the null state 211.<br>
Fourthly, a description will be given for the access state 217. The case in<br>
which the access terminal performs a state transition from the initialization state<br>
213 into the access state 217 occurs when the access terminal has data to be<br>
transmitted/received to/from an access point after performing a network entry<br>
operation in the initialization state 213. After the access terminal performs a<br>
network entry operation in the initialization state 213, if there is data to be<br>
transmitted/received between the access terminal and the access point, the access<br>
terminal performs a state transition into the access state 217 so as to access the<br>
access point.<br>
In the access state 217, the access terminal performs an access operation<br>
to the access point. The access to the access point, which is performed in the<br>
access state 217, is basically carried out in a contention-based scheme. The<br>
access terminal requests bandwidth allocation to the access point so as to transmit<br>
data, that is, traffic, to the access point. The access to an access point, that is,<br>
uplink access, of a contention-based scheme is performed using the UL-ACH.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the access point allocates<br>
different numbers of PN codes to the uplink access depending on the QoS of the<br>
traffic in response to a bandwidth allocation request. Each of the PN codes has<br>
an orthogonal feature. In the broadband wireless access communication system,<br>
a PN code is created by segmenting a PN sequence having a predetermined<br>
length, for example, '2 -1' bits, in predetermined units. When it is assumed<br>
that P PN codes are generated by the above-mentioned scheme, from among the P<br>
PN codes, K PN codes are allocated to be used to a bandwidth allocation request<br>
for the UGS data transmission, L PN codes are allocated to be used to a<br>
bandwidth allocation request for the real time service data transmission, M PN<br>
codes are allocated to be used to a bandwidth allocation request for the non-real<br>
time service data transmission, N PN codes are allocated to be used to a<br>
bandwidth allocation request for the best effort data transmission, and S PN<br>
codes are allocated to be used for the fast access. Herein, the PN code allocated<br>
for the fast access is called a 'fast access PN code', and the relationship of P, K, L,<br>
M, N, and S may be defined as Equation 1.<br>
P = K + L + M + N+S(wherein,K&gt;L&gt;M&gt;N) ........(1)<br>
For example, it is assumed that the number of PN codes capable of being<br>
used for the bandwidth allocation request is 48 in the broadband wireless access<br>
communication system. Then, the access point allocates 17 PN codes from<br>
among the 48 PN codes to be used to a bandwidth allocation request for the UGS<br>
data transmission, allocates 13 PN codes from among the remaining PN codes to<br>
be used to a bandwidth allocation request for the real time service data<br>
transmission, allocates 7 PN codes from among the remaining PN codes to be<br>
used to a bandwidth allocation request for the non-real time service data<br>
transmission, allocates 4 PN codes from among the remaining PN codes to be<br>
used to a bandwidth allocation request for the best effort data transmission, and<br>
allocates the remaining PN codes to be used as the fast access PN codes.<br>
The access point allocates more PN codes to a bandwidth allocation<br>
request for uplink data having a high priority QoS class, as compared with a low<br>
priority QoS class, thereby enabling the data having the high priority QoS classto<br>
be processed prior to the data having a lower priority QoS class. The fast access<br>
can then be achieved, so that it is also possible to minimize the power<br>
consumption of an access terminal when the access terminal performs uplink<br>
access. While a description is given above for the case in which the access<br>
point allocates fast access PN codes for fast access, the access point may allocate<br>
separate fast access time slots for fast access. The fast access, the fast access<br>
PN code, and the fast access time slot will be described in detail later.<br>
The access terminal attempts an uplink access by transmitting the<br>
bandwidth allocation request message through the UL-ACH. When<br>
transmitting the bandwidth allocation request message, the access terminal uses<br>
only PN codes which are allocated according to the QoS of the data to be<br>
transmitted, thereby enabling an access priority to be provided according to the<br>
QoS. In this case, the access point can determine which of the QoS classes<br>
corresponds to a PN code employed for the bandwidth allocation request message.<br>
The access point allocates the fast access PN code only to a higher priority QoS<br>
class from among the QoS classes, for example, only to a UGS and a real time<br>
service. That is, when there is no uplink bandwidth to be allocated, data<br>
corresponding to a lower priority QoS class are denied the uplink access, and are<br>
required to undergo a normal uplink resumption process, that is, to undergo an<br>
uplink access resumption process of a contention-based scheme. In contrast,<br>
data corresponding to a higher priority QoS class , when there is no uplink<br>
bandwidth to be allocated, are processed to accomplish the uplink access by<br>
including the fast access PN code information, provided that the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition into the traffic state 219 and the actual data is<br>
transmitted later when there is an uplink bandwidth to be allocated. In this case,<br>
as described above, the fast access time slots may be used instead of the fast<br>
access PN codes.<br>
According to a bandwidth allocation request of the access terminal, the<br>
access point allocates a bandwidth to be used by the access terminal into the<br>
access terminal when there is a currently available bandwidth, and notifies the<br>
access terminal of the allocated bandwidth information. Of course, as described<br>
above, in a case in which the bandwidth allocation for the data corresponding to a<br>
higher priority QoS class is requested in a state in which there is no bandwidth to<br>
be allocated, the access point must notify the access terminal of fast access PN<br>
code information. The access point transmits the allocated bandwidth<br>
information or fast access PN code information to the access terminal through the<br>
DL-USCCH.<br>
The access terminal, which has determined that the bandwidth is<br>
allocated, performs a state transition from the access state 217 into the traffic<br>
state 219. In contrast, when the access terminal does not receive a bandwidth<br>
allocation from the access point in spite of the request of bandwidth, that is, when<br>
the access terminal fails to access the access point, the access terminal performs a<br>
state transition from the access state 217 to the sleeping state 215. When the<br>
allocation of bandwidth fails, the access terminal may again request a bandwidth<br>
allocation, and the access terminal performs a state transition from the access<br>
state 217 into the sleeping state 215 only when the bandwidth allocation is not<br>
accomplished during a predetermined period of time. Of course, when access<br>
terminal cancels the data transmission, as well as when the access terminal fails<br>
to access the access point, the access terminal performs a state transition from the<br>
access state 217 to the sleeping state 215.<br>
When the access terminal performs a state transition from the access state<br>
217 to the sleeping state 215, the access terminal monitors a DL-WUCH<br>
indicator in the same slot index as that of a DL-WUCH monitored before in the<br>
sleeping state 215. However, when the access terminal performs a state<br>
transition from the access state 217 to the sleeping state 215, it is possible that the<br>
access terminal does not monitor the DL-WUCH but monitors only the DL-<br>
BCCH.<br>
Meanwhile, while the access terminal is performing the uplink access in<br>
the access state 217, if the access terminal loses synchronization with the access<br>
point due to a problem, such as a system error, the access terminal performs a<br>
state transition from the access state 217 into the null state 211, thereby<br>
performing an initial operation again. That is, when the access terminal is<br>
reset due to a problem, such as a system error, it is necessary that the access<br>
terminal restart its operation in the null state 211.<br>
Fifthly, a description will be given for the traffic state 219. In the traffic<br>
state 219, the access terminal transmits/receives data to/from the access point.<br>
Also, in the traffic state 219, although the access terminal does not directly<br>
transmit/receive actual data to/from the access point, the access terminal is<br>
allocated resources for a later transmission/reception of data. That is, in the<br>
traffic state 219. since resources have been allocated for the<br>
transmission/reception of the data although there in no actual data to be<br>
transmitted/received between the access terminal and the access point, the access<br>
terminal can rapidly access the access point when data to be transmitted/received<br>
is generated, and the data can be normally transmitted/received. Uplink access<br>
using the fast access PN code or fast access time slot is performed in the traffic<br>
state 219.<br>
In the traffic state 219, when there is no data to be transmitted/received<br>
between the access terminal and the access point, or when it is needed to reduce<br>
the power consumption of the access terminal itself, the access terminal performs<br>
a state transition from the traffic state 219 to the sleeping state 215. Also, in the<br>
traffic state 219, when the access terminal loses synchronization with the access<br>
point due to a problem, such as a system error, the access terminal performs a<br>
state transition from the traffic state 219 into the null state 211, thereby<br>
performing an initial operation again. When the access terminal is reset due to a<br>
problem, such as a system error, it is necessary for the access terminal restart its<br>
operation in the null state 211.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 2 has shown MAC<br>
operational states proposed in the present invention. Hereinafter, the<br>
initialization state 213 will be described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram schematically illustrating operation modes of the<br>
initialization state 213 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Referring FIG. 3, the initialization state 213 includes two operation<br>
modes, that is, a system detecting mode 300 and a network entry mode 350. As<br>
described with reference to FIG. 2, when the access terminal normally performs<br>
an initial operation following a reset or power-on, the access terminal performs a<br>
state transition from the null state 211 into the initialization state 213 (step 311).<br>
Also, if the access terminal loses synchronization with the access point due to a<br>
problem, such as a system error, in the initialization state 213, the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition from the initialization state 213 into the null state 211,<br>
thereby again performing an initial operation (step 313). Meanwhile, when the<br>
access terminal performs a state transition from the null state 211 into the<br>
initialization state 213, the access terminal enters the system detecting mode 300<br>
of the initialization state 213. The system detecting mode 300 will be described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
In the system detecting mode 300, the access terminal receives DL-PICH<br>
signals transmitted from a plurality of access points, and detects a DL-PICH<br>
signal having the greatest intensity, that is, having the highest CINR. In this<br>
state, when the access terminal is handed off from a prior access point, to which<br>
the access terminal had belonged, to a target access point, the access terminal<br>
also performs a synchronization acquisition operation with the target access point.<br>
Because the access terminal has to consider a hand-off state, the access terminal<br>
has to continuously monitor whether or not there is a second access point which<br>
transmits a DL-PICH signal having a higher CINR than that of a DL-PICH signal<br>
transmitted from a first access point, to which the access terminal currently<br>
belongs. Under such a continuous monitoring operation, when there is a second<br>
access point which transmits a DL-PICH signal having a higher CINR than that<br>
of a DL-PICH signal transmitted from a first access point to which the access<br>
terminal currently belongs, the access terminal performs a cell reselection<br>
operation.<br>
When detecting a DL-PICH signal having the highest CINR as described<br>
above, the access terminal determines that an access point transmitting the<br>
detected DL-PICH signal is to be an access point to which the access terminal<br>
belongs, that is, to be a serving access point, and receives a DL-BCCH signal<br>
transmitted from the serving access point. The access terminal receives the DL-<br>
BCCH signal to detect the system configuration information, the neighbor access<br>
point information, the downlink and uplink channel configuration information,<br>
the downlink and uplink access information, etc. When the access terminal<br>
normally performs the operation required in the system detecting mode 300, that<br>
is the synchronization acquisition operation with the access point, the access<br>
terminal performs a mode change from the system detecting mode 300 into the<br>
network entry mode 350 so as to perform a network entry operation tor<br>
transmitting/receiving data to/from the access point (step 315).<br>
In the network entry mode 350, the access terminal performs an initial<br>
uplink access operation for network entry using the uplink access information<br>
received in the system detecting mode 300. Herein, the initial uplink access<br>
operation for the network entry is performed in a contention-based scheme, the<br>
access terminal performs the initial uplink access operation through an UL-ACH,<br>
and the access point transmits a response to the initial uplink access to the access<br>
terminal. The initial uplink access and the response thereto are<br>
transmitted/received through an MAC message. In the MAC message in which<br>
a response to the initial uplink access is included, also included is the slot index<br>
information of a DL-WUCH which the access terminal monitors in the sleeping<br>
state 215.<br>
After the access terminal performs a network entry operation in the<br>
network entry mode 350, the access terminal performs a state transition into the<br>
access state 217 if there is data to be transmitted to the access point (step 319).<br>
Also, after the access terminal performs a network entry operation in the network<br>
entry mode 350, the access terminal performs a state transition into the traffic<br>
state 219 if the access terminal receives paging information which represents that<br>
there is data to be transmitted to the access terminal through a DL-BCCH (step<br>
321). Also, when the access terminal has no data to be transmitted/received<br>
to/from the access point in the network entry mode 350, the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition into the sleeping state 215 (step 323). Finally, in the<br>
network entry mode 350, when the access terminal does not perform a normal<br>
operation due to a system error and the like, the access terminal performs a mode<br>
change into the system detecting mode 300 and again performs an initial<br>
operation following a reset.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 3 has shown the operation<br>
modes of the initialization state 213. Hereinafter, the sleeping state 215 will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram schematically illustrating operation modes of the<br>
sleeping state 215 shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 4, the sleeping state 215<br>
includes two operation modes, that is, a sleeping mode 400 and an awake mode<br>
450. As described with reference to FIG. 2, when the access terminal normally<br>
performs an network entry operation, the access terminal performs a state<br>
transition from the initialization state 213 into the sleeping state 215 (step 411).<br>
Also, if the access terminal loses synchronization with the access point due to a<br>
problem, such as a system error, in the sleeping state 215, the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition from the sleeping state 215 into the null state 211,<br>
thereby again performing an initial operation (step 413). Meanwhile, when the<br>
access terminal performs a state transition from the initialization state 213 into<br>
the sleeping state 215, the access terminal enters the sleeping mode 400 or the<br>
awake mode 450 in the sleeping state 215.<br>
First, the sleeping mode 400 will be described hereinafter.<br>
In the sleeping mode 400, the access terminal does not continuously<br>
monitor a DL-BCCH transmitted from the access point, but monitors only a DL-<br>
WUCH. Therefore, only the case in which the wake-up indicator of the DL-<br>
WUCH is turned on, the access terminal performs a mode change from the<br>
sleeping mode 400 into the awake mode 450 so as to monitor an DL-BCCH.<br>
The case in which the access point sets the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH<br>
to 'on' occurs when the system information is updated or when the access point<br>
contains paging information to notify the access terminal of data to be<br>
transmitted to the access terminal. The access terminal monitors only a DL-<br>
WUCH while in the sleeping mode 400. The access terminal monitors the DL-<br>
BCCH only when the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH allocated into the<br>
access terminal itself is turned on, thereby minimizing the power consumption.<br>
During the monitoring of only the DL-WUCH, when the wake-up indicator of the<br>
DL-WUCH is turned on, the access terminal performs a mode change from the<br>
sleeping mode 400 into the awake mode 450 (step 415).<br>
Secondly, the awake mode 450 will be described hereinafter. In the<br>
awake mode 450, the access terminal monitors a DL-BCCH transmitted from the<br>
access point. As described above, since the access point wakes up the access<br>
terminal to update the system information or to transmit paging information for<br>
notifying the access terminal of data to be transmitted to the access terminal, the<br>
access terminal monitors the DL-BCCH and may check whether or not the<br>
system information is undated and whether or not the paging information is<br>
received from the access point. As a result of the monitoring of the DL-BCCH,<br>
when the system information is updated, the access terminal confirms the updated<br>
system information and performs a mode change from the awake mode 450 into<br>
the sleeping mode 400 (step 417). Also, as a result of the monitoring of the DL-<br>
BCCH, when there is paging information that is targeted to access terminal, the<br>
access terminal performs a state transition from the awake mode 450 into the<br>
traffic state 219 (step 425).<br>
Meanwhile, when the access terminal has data to transmit to the access<br>
point, the access terminal performs a state transition from the awake mode 450<br>
into the access state 217, thereby performing an uplink access of a contention-<br>
based scheme (step 419). Also, when the access terminal fails in the uplink<br>
access in spite of performing the uplink access of a contention-based scheme<br>
during a predetermined period of time in the access state 217, the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition from the access state 217 into the sleeping state 215<br>
(step 421).<br>
In addition, also when the access terminal cancels the data transmission<br>
as well as when the access terminal fails in the uplink access, the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition from the access state 217 into the sleeping state 215.<br>
Also, in the traffic state 219, when the access terminal has no data to be<br>
transmitted to the access point, or when it is needed to reduce the power<br>
consumption of the access terminal itself, the access terminal performs a state<br>
transition from the traffic state 219 into the sleeping state 215 (step 423).<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 4 has illustrated the<br>
operating modes of the sleeping state 215. Hereinafter, the signal<br>
transmitting/receiving process performed between an access point and an access<br>
terminal in the initialization state 213 will be described with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a signal transmitting/receiving process<br>
performed between an access point and an access terminal in the initialization<br>
state 213 shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 5, first, when the access terminal is<br>
powered on (step 511), the access terminal performs an initial operation in the<br>
null state 211. When normally completing the initial operation, the access<br>
terminal performs a state transition into the system detecting mode 300 of the<br>
initialization state 213. In the system detecting mode 300, the access point<br>
transmits a pilot signal through a DL-PICH (step 513), and transmits the system<br>
configuration information, the neighbor access point information, the downlink<br>
and uplink channel configuration information, the downlink and uplink access<br>
information, etc. through a DL-BCCH (step 515). The access terminal acquires<br>
synchronization with the access point using a pilot signal received through the<br>
DL-PICH in the system detecting mode 300, and then performs a mode change<br>
into the network entry mode 350. Then, the access terminal transmits a network<br>
entry request message to the access point through a UL-ACH which corresponds<br>
to uplink access information received through the DL-BCCH in the network<br>
entry mode 350 (step 517). When sensing a network entry request of the access<br>
terminal, the access point transmits a network entry response message through a<br>
DL-BCCH in response to the network entry request message of the access<br>
terminal (step 519). Herein, the network entry response message, as described<br>
above, includes slot index information of a DL- WUCH which the access terminal<br>
monitors in the sleeping mode.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 5 has shown the signal<br>
transmitting/receiving process performed between an access point and an access<br>
terminal in the initialization state 213. Hereinafter, a signal<br>
transmitting/receiving process performed between an access point and an access<br>
terminal in the sleeping state 215 will be described with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a signal transmitting/receiving process<br>
performed between an access point and an access terminal in the sleeping state<br>
215 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, first, when the access terminal accomplishes a<br>
network entry in the initialization state 213 (step 611), the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition into the sleeping state 215. Herein, the case in which<br>
the access terminal performs a state transition from the initialization state 213<br>
into the sleeping state 215 occurs when there is no data to be transmitted/received<br>
between the access terminal and the access point. As described above, After<br>
accomplishing the network entry in the initialization state 213, if the access<br>
terminal has data to be transmitted to the access point, the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition into the access state 217, and if the access terminal has<br>
data to be received from the access point, the access terminal performs a state<br>
transition into the traffic state 219. The access point transmits a wake-up<br>
indicator to the access terminal through a DL-WUCH since the access terminal is<br>
in the sleeping mode 400 of the sleeping state 215 (step 613).<br>
When the wake-up indicator is in an 'on' state, the access terminal<br>
performs a mode change from the sleeping mode 400 into the awake mode 450,<br>
but when the wake-up indicator is in an 'off' state, the access terminal is<br>
maintained in the sleeping mode 400. In FIG. 6, it is assumed that the wake-up<br>
indicator of a DL-WUCH transmitted from the access point in step 613 is in an<br>
'off state. When the wake-up indicator of a DL-WUCH transmitted from the<br>
access point in step 613 is in an 'on' state, the following step 615 may be omitted.<br>
When the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH is in an 'off state, the access<br>
terminal is maintained in the sleeping mode 400 and receives a DL-WUCH signal<br>
transmitted from the access point (step 615).<br>
Meanwhile, in step 615, when the wake-up indicator of a DL-WUCH<br>
transmitted from the access point is in an 'on' state, the access terminal performs<br>
a mode change from the sleeping mode 400 into the awake mode 450. When<br>
the access terminal is in the awake mode 450, the access point transmits the<br>
updated system information or paging information through the DL-BCCH (step<br>
617). As described above, when the access point has updated system<br>
information to be transmitted through the DL-BCCH, or when the access point<br>
desires to transmit paging information to the access terminal, the access terminal<br>
first transmits the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH which is in an 'on' state,<br>
and then transmits the updated system information or paging information through<br>
the DL-BCCH.<br>
When there are performed in connection with the sleeping state 215,<br>
although the steps are not performed actually in the sleeping state 215.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 6 has shown the signal<br>
transmitting/receiving process performed between an access point and an access<br>
terminal in the sleeping state 215. Hereinafter, an operation process of the<br>
access point in the sleeping state 215 will be described with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the access point in the<br>
sleeping state 215 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, first, the access point determines whether or not data<br>
to be transmitted to the access terminal is generated in step 711. As a result,<br>
when data to be transmitted to the access terminal is not generated, the access<br>
point proceeds to step 713. In step 713, since no data is to be transmitted to the<br>
access terminal, the access point sets the wake-up indicator of a DL-WUCH to<br>
'off, transmits the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH, and returns to step 711.<br>
As a result, when there is data to be transmitted to the access terminal, the access<br>
point proceeds to step 715. In step 715, the access point determines an access<br>
terminal which the access point targets for the data to be transmitted, and then<br>
proceeds to step 717.<br>
In step 717, since there is data to be transmitted to the access terminal,<br>
the access point sets the wake-up indicator of a DL-WUCH to 'on', transmits the<br>
wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH, and then proceeds to step 719. In this time,<br>
the access terminal monitors only the DL-WUCH because it is in the sleeping<br>
mode 400 of the sleeping state 215, and the access terminal performs a mode<br>
change from the sleeping mode 400 into the awake mode 450 only when it<br>
receives the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH that is set to 'on'. In step 719,<br>
the access point transmits the paging information, which represents that there is<br>
data to be transmitted to the access terminal, to the access terminal through a DL-<br>
BCCH, and then proceeds to step 721. Then, the access terminal receives the<br>
paging information through the DL-BCCH, and performs a state transition from<br>
the awake mode 450 into the traffic state 219.<br>
In step 721, the access point transmits the control information for<br>
transmitting a DL-TCH, which is used to transmit data, to the access terminal<br>
through a DL-TCCH, transmits data to the access terminal through the DL-TCH,<br>
and then proceeds to step 723. Herein, the control information to be transmitted<br>
through the DL-TCCH includes the AMC scheme information, the information<br>
used in a data decoding, such as EP, the MAC control information, etc.<br>
In step 723, the access terminal determines whether or not the data<br>
transmission is complete. Whether or not the data transmission is completed<br>
may be determined according to whether or not there is any remaining data in a<br>
transmission buffer to be sent to the access point. That is, when there is data<br>
stored in the transmission buffer, the access point determines that the data is<br>
being transmitted, but when there is no data stored in the transmission buffer, the<br>
access point determines that the data transmission is complete. As a result of<br>
step 723, when the data transmission is not complete, the access point returns to<br>
step 721. As a result of step 723, when the data transmission is complete, the<br>
access point returns to step 711.<br>
In the description with reference to FIG. 7, an operation of the access<br>
point is explained with respect to the case in which the access point transmits<br>
data to the access terminal which is in the sleeping state 215. Although a<br>
separate description is not given in FIG. 7, that the access point transmits the<br>
updated system information can also be achieved in a similar operation to that<br>
described in FIG. 7. That is, when the access point determines that there is<br>
updated system information, the access point sets the wake-up indicator of a DL-<br>
WUCH to 'on', transmits the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH, and then<br>
transmits the updated system information through the DL-BCCH. The access<br>
terminal receives the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH which is set to 'on',<br>
and performs a mode change from the sleeping mode 400 into the awake mode<br>
450, thereby receiving the updated system information through the DL-BCCH.<br>
After this, the access terminal performs a mode change from the awake mode 450<br>
into the sleeping mode 400.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 7 has shown the operation<br>
process of the access point in the sleeping state 215. Hereinafter, an operation<br>
process of the access terminal in the sleeping state 215 will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating an operation process of the access<br>
terminal in the sleeping state 215 shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 8, first, the<br>
access terminal monitors only a DL-WUCH in the sleeping mode 400 of the<br>
sleeping state 215 in step 811, and then proceeds to step 813. In step 813, the<br>
access terminal determines whether or not the wake-up indicator of the DL-<br>
WUCH is set to 'on'. As a result, when the wake-up indicator of the DL-<br>
WUCH is not set to 'on', that is, when the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH<br>
is set to 'off, the access terminal returns to step 811. As a result of step 813,<br>
when the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH is set to 'on', the access terminal<br>
proceeds to step 815. In step 815, the access terminal performs a mode change<br>
from the sleeping mode 400 into the awake mode 450, monitors a DL-BCCH in<br>
the awake mode 450, and proceeds to step 817. Through the DL-BCCH,<br>
updated system information and paging information is transmitted. Herein, a<br>
description will be given with reference to FIG. 8 for the case in which paging<br>
information is transmitted through the DL-BCCH as an example, corresponding<br>
to the operation of the access point shown in FIG. 7. When the access terminal<br>
receives the paging information through the DL-BCCH, the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition from the awake mode 450 into the traffic state 219.<br>
In step 817, the access terminal receives a DL-TCH signal and a DL-<br>
TCCH signal transmitted from the access point, and then proceeds to step 819.<br>
In step 819, the access terminal determines whether or not the data reception is<br>
complete. As a result, when the data reception is complete, the access terminal<br>
returns to step 811. In contrast, as a result, when the data reception is not<br>
complete, the access terminal returns to step 817.<br>
In the description with reference to FIG. 8, an operation of the access<br>
terminal is explained with respect to the case in which the access point transmits<br>
data to the access terminal which is in the sleeping state 215. Although a<br>
separate description is not given in FIG. 8, the transmission of the updated system<br>
information by the access point can also be achieved in a similar operation to that<br>
shown in FIG. 8. That is, when the access point senses that there is updated<br>
system information, the access point sets the wake-up indicator of a DL-WUCH<br>
to 'on', transmits the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH, and then transmits the<br>
updated system information through the DL-BCCH. In this time, the access<br>
terminal receives the wake-up indicator of the DL-WUCH which is set to 'on',<br>
and performs a mode change from the sleeping mode 400 into the awake mode<br>
450, thereby receiving the updated system information through the DL-BCCH.<br>
After this, the access terminal performs a mode change from the awake mode 450<br>
into the sleeping mode 400.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 8 has shown the operation<br>
process of the access terminal in the sleeping state 215. Hereinafter, a<br>
construction of a DL-WUCH transmitter will be described with reference to FIG.<br>
9.<br>
FIG. 9 is a block diagram illustrating a construction of a DL-WUCH<br>
transmitter according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to<br>
FIG. 9, first, when a wake-up indicator to be transmitted through a DL-WUCH is<br>
input into the transmitter, the wake-up indicator is transferred to a symbol<br>
repeater 911. Not only the wake-up indicator but also a wake-up indicator rate<br>
and a marked rate are simultaneously input to the symbol repeater 911. The<br>
wake-up indicator rate represents the number of frames included in a super frame,<br>
and the marked rate represents a transmission period of a wake-up indicator to be<br>
transmitted to an access terminal. For example, in a case in which four frames<br>
make one super frame and the wake-up indicator is transmitted in one frame unit,<br>
the wake-up indicator rate is 'four' and the marked rate is 'one'. The symbol<br>
repeater 911 repeats a symbol of the input wake-up indicator, and then outputs<br>
the wake-up indicator to a DL-WUCH information mapper 913. According to<br>
the symbol repetition operation of the symbol repeater 911, the transmission rate<br>
of the DL-WUCH is determined.<br>
Meanwhile, when data has been generated, a controller 917 determines<br>
an access terminal targeted by the generated data, and transmits DL-WUCH slot<br>
index information of the access terminal to which the data is to be transmitted<br>
and the information representing that the wake-up indicator has to be set to 'on',<br>
to the DL-WUCH information mapper 913. The DL-WUCH information<br>
mapper 913 sets the wake-up indicator to 'on' in a slot, which corresponds to a<br>
DL-WUCH slot index information of the access terminal to which the data is to<br>
be transmitted, and then outputs the wake-up indicator to a channel gain<br>
multiplier 915. When there is no data, the controller 917 transmits DL-WUCH<br>
slot index information of a relevant access terminal and information representing<br>
that the wake-up indicator has to be set to 'off, to the DL-WUCH information<br>
mapper 913. The DL-WUCH information mapper 913 sets the wake-up<br>
indicator to 'off in a slot, which corresponds to a DL-WUCH slot index<br>
information of the relevant access terminal, and then outputs the wake-up<br>
indicator to the channel gain multiplier 915. The channel gain multiplier 915<br>
multiplies a signal output from the DL-WUCH information mapper 913 by a<br>
predetermined channel gain value, and then outputs the resultant. Accordingly,<br>
a signal output from the channel gain multiplier 915 is transmitted, to an access<br>
terminal.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 9 has shown the<br>
construction of a DL-WUCH transmitter according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Hereinafter, an operation of an access terminal in the access<br>
state 217, which is shown in FIG. 2, will be described with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating an operation process of an access<br>
terminal in the access state 217 shown in FIG. 2. Prior to the description of FIG.<br>
10, it should be noted that the access state 217 proposed in the present invention<br>
is a state for transmitting a bandwidth allocation request message from an access<br>
terminal to an access point when the access terminal desires to transmit traffic,<br>
and a state for receiving a bandwidth allocation response message which is a<br>
response message to the bandwidth allocation request message, thereby<br>
performing uplink access. Also, as described above, it should be noted that the<br>
access point has already allocated the PN codes, which are used when an access<br>
terminal transmits a bandwidth allocation request message, according to the QoS<br>
of the traffic, and the access terminal uses the PN codes differentially applied<br>
according to the QoS of the transmitted traffic when transmitting a bandwidth<br>
allocation request message.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, first, when traffic to be transmitted from the access<br>
terminal is generated, the access terminal detects the QoS of the traffic to be<br>
transmitted in step 1011, and then proceeds to step 1013. Herein, to detect the<br>
QoS of the traffic, as described above, means to detect a QoS class of the traffic.<br>
That is, to detect whether the traffic is UGS traffic, or real time service traffic, or<br>
non-real time service traffic, or best effort traffic. In step 1013, the access<br>
terminal selects a PN code, which is applied to a bandwidth allocation request<br>
message, according to the detected QoS and then proceeds to step 1015.<br>
Herein, to select a PN code corresponding to the detected QoS, as<br>
described above, means to select a certain PN code from among the PN codes<br>
allocated to be applied to UGS traffic in a case in which the QoS is UGS, to<br>
select a certain PN code from among PN codes allocated to be applied to real<br>
time service traffic in a case in which the QoS is real time service, to select a<br>
certain PN code from among PN codes allocated to be applied to non-real time<br>
service traffic in a case in which the QoS is non-real time service, and to select a<br>
certain PN code from among PN codes allocated to be applied to best effort<br>
traffic in a case in which the QoS is best effort. Accordingly, the PN code is<br>
used as a scrambling code. Meanwhile, the access terminal can receive<br>
information about the PN codes allocated according to the QoS of the traffic,<br>
through the DL-BCCH, in the initialization state 213 or the sleeping state 215,<br>
that is, in a state before a state transition is performed into the access state 217.<br>
In step 1015, the access terminal tries the uplink access, that is, the<br>
access terminal scrambles the bandwidth allocation request message using the<br>
selected PN code and transmits the scrambled bandwidth allocation request<br>
message to the access point through the UL-ACH, and then proceeds to step 1017.<br>
In step 1017, the access terminal determines whether or not the uplink access is<br>
accomplished, that is, whether or not the access terminal receives a bandwidth<br>
allocation response message in response to the bandwidth allocation request<br>
message by monitoring a DL-USCCH transmitted from the access point. Here,<br>
the access terminal may update the PN code information using the bandwidth<br>
allocation response message transmitted through the DL-USCCH. That is, the<br>
access terminal acquires PN code information transmitted from the access point<br>
through a DL-BCCH when performing the uplink access, since the access point<br>
notifies the access terminal of a PN code through the DL-USCCH so that the<br>
access terminal may perform the fast access when the access terminal is not<br>
allocated an uplink bandwidth as a result of the uplink access performance.<br>
As a result of step 1017, the access terminal does not receive a bandwidth<br>
allocation response message through the DL-USCCH, the access terminal<br>
proceeds to step 1025. In step 1025, the access terminal determines whether or<br>
not an Access_Try_Time, which is a waiting time for receiving the bandwidth<br>
allocation response message, lapses. As a result, when the Access_Try_Time<br>
does not lapse, the access terminal returns to step 1017 and continuously<br>
monitors whether or not the access terminal receives a bandwidth allocation<br>
response message through the DL-USCCH. In contrast, as a result of step 1025,<br>
when the Access_Try_Time lapses, the access terminal proceeds to step 1027.<br>
In step 1027, since the access terminal fails in the uplink access, the access<br>
terminal performs a state transition from the access state 217 into the sleeping<br>
state 215 and ends the uplink access process.<br>
As a result of step 1017, the access terminal receives a bandwidth<br>
allocation response message through the DL-USCCH, the access terminal<br>
proceeds to step 1019. In step 1019, since the access terminal receives the<br>
bandwidth allocation response message, the access terminal performs a state<br>
transition from the access state 217 into the traffic state 219 and ends the uplink<br>
access process. A state transition procedure from the access state 217 into the<br>
traffic state 219 will be described in detail hereinafter.<br>
The bandwidth allocation response message includes either the uplink<br>
bandwidth information which the access point allocates into the access terminal<br>
for uplink traffic transmission of the access terminal, or the PN code information,<br>
that is, the fast access PN code information, which the access point allocates to<br>
the access terminal to first allocate an uplink bandwidth into the access terminal<br>
when the access point has no currently available uplink bandwidth, that is, so as<br>
to permit a fast access of the access terminal. In the access state 217, although<br>
the access terminal is allocated only the fast access PN code through the<br>
bandwidth allocation response message, the access terminal determines that the<br>
uplink access has already been accomplished, thereby performing a state<br>
transition from the access state 217 into the traffic state 219. When performing<br>
a state transition from the access state 217 into the traffic state 219, the transition<br>
is performed into the different modes of the traffic state 219 depending on<br>
whether the access terminal is allocated the uplink bandwidth or the access<br>
terminal is allocated the fast access PN code, which will be described in detail<br>
later.<br>
Also, as described with reference to FIG. 2, although not shown in FIG. 3,<br>
when the access terminal cancels the traffic transmission as well as when the<br>
access terminal fails in the uplink access in the access state 217, the access<br>
terminal also performs a state transition from the access state 217 into the<br>
sleeping state 215. Meanwhile, while the access terminal is performing the<br>
uplink access in the access state 217, if the access terminal loses its<br>
synchronization with the access point due to a problem, such as a system error,<br>
the access terminal performs a state transition from the access state 217 into the<br>
null state 211, thereby performing an initial operation again. That is, when the<br>
access terminal is reset due to a problem, such as a system error, it is necessary<br>
that the access terminal newly starts its operation in the null state 211.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 10 has shown the operation<br>
process of an access terminal in the access state 217. Hereinafter, a signal<br>
transmitting/receiving process performed between an access point and an access<br>
terminal in the access state 217, which is shown in FIG. 2, will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 11.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating a signal transmitting/receiving process<br>
performed between an access point and an access terminal in the access state 217<br>
shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 11, first, while the access terminal is in the<br>
initialization state 213 or in the sleeping state 215 (step 1111), the access terminal<br>
receives the system configuration information, overhead information, etc., which<br>
are transmitted from the access point through a DL-BCCH (step 1113). Then,<br>
either in the sleeping state 215 or after the access terminal accomplishes the<br>
network entry in the initialization state 213, when the access terminal has traffic<br>
to be transmitted to the access point, the access terminal performs a state<br>
transition from the initialization state 213 or from the sleeping state 215 into the<br>
access state 217.<br>
In the access state 217, since the access terminal has traffic to be<br>
transmitted through an uplink, the access terminal detects the QoS of the traffic to<br>
be transmitted, and selects a PN code allocated according to the detected QoS.<br>
The access terminal scrambles a bandwidth allocation request message using the<br>
selected PN code and transmits the scrambled bandwidth allocation request<br>
message to the access point through a UL-ACH (step 1115). After transmitting<br>
the bandwidth allocation request message, the access terminal monitors a DL-<br>
USCCH and receives a bandwidth allocation response message which is a<br>
response message to the bandwidth allocation request message (step 1117).<br>
When receiving the bandwidth allocation response message, the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition from the access state 217 into the traffic state 219.<br>
Then, in the traffic state 219, the access terminal transmits traffic to the access<br>
point through a UL-TCH which corresponds to the uplink bandwidth allocation<br>
information included in the bandwidth allocation response message (step 1119).<br>
Of course, as described above, when the bandwidth allocation response message<br>
includes only fast access PN code information, the access terminal does not<br>
directly transmit the traffic in the traffic state 219, but can transmit the traffic<br>
when an available uplink bandwidth exists in the access point.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 11 has shown the signal<br>
transmitting/receiving process performed between an access point and an access<br>
terminal in the access state 217 shown in FIG. 2. Hereinafter, an operation<br>
process of an access point in the access state 217, which is shown in FIG. 2, will<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 12.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating an operation process of an access point<br>
in the access state 217 shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 12, first, the access<br>
point monitors a UL-ACH in step 1211, and then proceeds to step 1213. In step<br>
1213, the access point determines whether or not the access point receives a<br>
bandwidth allocation request message from the access terminal, as a result of the<br>
monitoring of the UL-ACH. As a result, when the access point does not receive<br>
a bandwidth allocation request message from the access terminal, the access point<br>
proceeds to step 1211 to continuously monitor the UL-ACH.<br>
In contrast, as a result of step 1213, the access point receives a bandwidth<br>
allocation request message from the access terminal, the access point proceeds to<br>
step 1215. In step 1215, the access point determines the QoS of the traffic,<br>
which the access terminal desires to transmit through an uplink, according to a<br>
PN code by which the bandwidth allocation request message is scrambled, and<br>
then allocates a resource for the traffic to the access terminal. After this, the<br>
access point proceeds to step 1217, Here, 'resource' means either an uplink<br>
bandwidth or a fast access PN code. When the access point can allocate an<br>
uplink bandwidth to an access terminal, the uplink bandwidth becomes the<br>
'resource'. In contrast, in the case where the access point cannot allocate an<br>
uplink bandwidth to an access terminal because there is no available uplink<br>
bandwidth, when the QoS of traffic to be transmitted from the access terminal<br>
through an uplink is high, the access terminal allocates a fast access PN code to<br>
the access terminal so that the access terminal may perform the fast access later<br>
and receive an uplink bandwidth. In this case, the fast access PN code becomes<br>
the 'resource'. In step 1217, the access point causes the information about the<br>
allocated resource to be included in a bandwidth allocation response message,<br>
and transmits the bandwidth allocation response message to the access terminal<br>
through a DL-USCCH.<br>
In FIG. 12, for the convenience of description, while a description is<br>
given for a case in which the access point allocates a resource to the uplink<br>
access of one access terminal, it will be understood that the access point may<br>
allocate the resource of the uplink access to a plurality of access terminals to<br>
which the access point provides service.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 12 has shown the operation<br>
process of an access point in the access state 217 shown in FIG. 2. Hereinafter,<br>
operation modes of the traffic state 219 will be described with reference to FIG.<br>
13.<br>
FIG. 13 is a view showing operation modes of the traffic state 219 shown<br>
in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 13, first, the traffic state 219 includes three<br>
operation modes, that is, an active mode 1300, a fast access mode 1330, and a<br>
hold mode 1360. As described with reference to FIG. 2, after the access<br>
terminal normally performs a network entry operation, the access terminal<br>
monitors a DL-USCCH transmitted from the access point. During the<br>
monitoring of the DL-USCCH, when the access terminal senses that there is data<br>
to be transmitted from the access point to the access terminal, the access terminal<br>
performs a state transition from the initialization state 213 into the traffic state<br>
219 (step 1311). Also, if the access terminal loses its synchronization with the<br>
access point due to a problem, such as a system error, in the traffic state 219, the<br>
access terminal performs a state transition from the traffic state 219 into the null<br>
state 211, thereby performing an initial operation (step 1321). Meanwhile,<br>
when the access terminal performs a state transition from the initialization state<br>
213 into the traffic state 219, the access terminal enters the active mode 1300 of<br>
the traffic state 219.<br>
Also, during monitoring of the channels, such as the DL-BCCH, DL-<br>
WUCH, DL-USCCH, etc., in the sleeping state 215, when the access terminal<br>
senses that there is data to be transmitted from the access point to the access<br>
terminal itself, the access terminal enters the active mode 1300 of the traffic state<br>
219 (step 1313). Unlike this, when data transmission/reception between the<br>
access point and the access terminal has been completed in the traffic state 219,<br>
the access terminal performs a state transition into the sleeping state 215 (step<br>
1315). Here, the access terminal, which has performed the state transition into<br>
the sleeping state 215, monitors the wake-up indicator of a DL-WUCH allocated<br>
from the access point, as described with reference to FIG. 2, thereby minimizing<br>
power consumption.<br>
Also, when the access terminal accomplishes the uplink access in the<br>
access state 217, the access terminal enters either the active mode 1300 or the fast<br>
access mode 1330 of the traffic state 219 (step 1317). Now, a detailed<br>
description will be given for cases in which the access terminal enters the active<br>
mode 1300 or the fast access mode 1330 of the traffic state 219 from the access<br>
state 217.<br>
First, a case in which the access terminal enters the active mode 1300 of<br>
the traffic state 219 from the access state 217 occurs when the access terminal is<br>
allocated an uplink bandwidth from the access point according to the uplink<br>
access in the access state 217. Secondly, a case in which the access terminal<br>
enters the fast access mode 1330 of the traffic state 219 from the access state 217<br>
occurs when the access terminal is not allocated an uplink bandwidth but is<br>
allocated either a fast access PN code or a fast access time slot as a result of<br>
uplink access performance in the access state 217.<br>
The active mode 1300 will now be described. First, the active mode<br>
1300 is a mode in which data of all QoS classes can be transmitted. During<br>
transmitting/receiving of the data between the access terminal and the access<br>
point in the active mode 1300, when the transmission/reception of the data is<br>
temporarily interrupted, the access terminal enters the hold mode 1360 (step<br>
1329). However, with respect to the UGS data and the real time service data,<br>
the hold mode 1360 is not supported. That is, the UGS data and the real time<br>
service data has a rigid limitation to a delay time due to inherent characteristics of<br>
the data when the data is transmitted/received. Therefore, although the<br>
transmission/reception of data is temporarily interrupted while the access<br>
terminal is transmitting/receiving the UGS data or the real time service data<br>
to/from the access point in the active mode 1300, the access terminal does not<br>
enter the hold mode 1360 but is maintained in the active mode 1300, thereby<br>
rapidly supporting the transmission/reception of data to be re-generated later. A<br>
mode change from the active mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360 is achieved<br>
when the access point or the access terminal transmits a mode change request<br>
message, which will be described in detail later.<br>
Next, a description will be given for the fast access mode 1330. The<br>
fast access mode 1330, as described above, is a mode in which the access<br>
terminal performs the fast access to the access point, when the access terminal is<br>
not allocated an actual uplink bandwidth in its uplink access attempt but is<br>
allocated a fast access PN code or a fast access time slot. When the access<br>
terminal performs the uplink access using the allocated fast access PN code, the<br>
probability of contention is minimized in performing the uplink access of a<br>
contention-based scheme, so that the access terminal can perform fast access.<br>
Also, the access terminal performs the uplink access using the allocated fast<br>
access time slot, the access terminal performs the fast access in a contention-free<br>
scheme. As a result, when the access point accomplishes the uplink access in<br>
the fast access mode 1330, the access terminal enters the active mode 1300 so as<br>
to transmit data to the access point (step 1323).<br>
Next, a description will be given for the hold mode 1360. The hold<br>
mode 1360, as described above, is a mode in which the transmission/reception<br>
between the access terminal and the access point is temporarily interrupted.<br>
When data to be transmitted to the access point is generated in the hold mode<br>
1360, the access terminal performs the uplink access to the access point. Also,<br>
since the hold mode 1360 is not a state in which the connection itself for<br>
transmission/reception of data is ended, a case in which the access terminal has to<br>
transmit a response message to the data transmitted from the access point, or a<br>
different message corresponding to the response message, may occur. In this<br>
case, since the access terminal has to perform faster uplink access than normal<br>
uplink access performed in the access state 217, the access terminal performs a<br>
mode change from the hold mode 1360 into the fast access mode 1330 (step<br>
1325).<br>
Meanwhile, in the hold mode 1360, the access terminal does not<br>
continuously monitor a DL-BCCH, but monitors a DL-WUCH, thereby<br>
minimizing the power consumption. During the monitoring of the DL-WUCH<br>
in the hold mode 1360 as described above, when a wake-up indicator is turned on,<br>
the access terminal enters the active mode 1300, thereby receiving data from the<br>
access point (step 1327).<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 13 has shown the operation<br>
modes of the traffic state 219. Hereinafter, a mode change process from the<br>
active mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360 in the traffic state 219, which is<br>
performed upon request from the access point, will be described with reference to<br>
FIG. 14.<br>
FIG. 14 is a signal flowchart illustrating a message transmitting/receiving<br>
process for a mode change from the active mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360,<br>
which is performed upon request from the access point and is shown in FIG. 13.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, first, when the access point determines that the access<br>
terminal has to perform a mode change from the active mode 1300 into the hold<br>
mode 1360, the access point transmits a mode change request message to the<br>
access terminal through a DL-TCH (step 1411). In this case, the access point<br>
may transmit the fast access PN code information or the fast access time slot<br>
information, which the access terminal uses in the fast access mode 1330,<br>
through the mode change request message. That is, when the access terminal<br>
being in the hold mode 1360 has to transmit data to the access point, it is<br>
reasonable that the access terminal does not perform the uplink access of a<br>
contention-based scheme but performs the uplink access of a contention-free<br>
scheme, so that the access point causes the fast access PN code information or the<br>
fast access time slot information, which the access terminal uses in the fast access<br>
mode 1330, to be included in the mode change request message. Here, the<br>
reason why the access point transmits the fast access PN code information or the<br>
fast access time slot information is that the access terminal does not monitor the<br>
DL-BCCH in the hold mode 1360.<br>
When the access terminal receives the mode change request message<br>
through the DL-TCH in the active mode 1300, the access terminal transmits a<br>
mode change response message, which is a response message to the mode change<br>
request message, to the access point through an UL-TCH. Also, after<br>
transmitting the mode change response message, the access terminal performs a<br>
mode change from the active mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360 (step 1413).<br>
In the hold mode 1360, the access terminal monitors a DL-WUCH, and<br>
periodically checks whether a wake-up indicator is turned on or off (step 1415).<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 14 has shown the mode<br>
change process from the active mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360 in the traffic<br>
state 219, which is performed upon the request from the access point.<br>
Hereinafter, a mode change process from the hold mode 1360 into the active<br>
mode 1300 in the traffic state 219, which is performed upon request from the<br>
access terminal, will be described with reference to FIG. 15.<br>
FIG. 15 is a signal flowchart illustrating a mode change process from the<br>
hold mode 1360 into the active mode 1300, which is performed upon request<br>
from the access terminal and is shown in FIG. 13. First, as described with<br>
reference to FIG. 14, the access terminal performs a mode change from the active<br>
mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360 according to a request generated from the<br>
access point (steps 1511 and 1513). Next, when the access terminal, which is in<br>
the hold mode 1360, senses that data to be transmitted to the access point is<br>
generated, the access terminal performs a mode change from the hold mode 1360<br>
into the fast access mode 1330. After this, in the fast access mode 1330, the<br>
access terminal transmits a mode change request message to the access point<br>
through a UL-FACCH, using a fast access PN code allocated from the access<br>
point in the active mode 1300 (step 1515). When the access point receives the<br>
mode change request message from the access terminal through the UL-FACCH,<br>
the access point allocates a resource to the access terminal, and transmits a mode<br>
change response message, which includes the allocated resource information, to<br>
the access terminal through a DL-USCCH (step 1517).<br>
Here, 'resource' means either an uplink bandwidth or a fast access PN<br>
code or a fast access time slot. When the access point can allocate an uplink<br>
bandwidth to an access terminal, the uplink bandwidth becomes the 'resource'.<br>
In contrast, as described above, when the access point cannot allocate an uplink<br>
bandwidth to an access terminal because having no currently available uplink<br>
bandwidth, the fast access PN code or the fast access time slot becomes the<br>
'resource'. Meanwhile, while the above description is given for the case in<br>
which the access terminal receives a mode change response message in response<br>
to a mode change request message, the access terminal may judges that the access<br>
terminal receives the mode change response message also in a case in which the<br>
access terminal receives not the mode change response message itself but only<br>
the DL-USCCH. When it is assumed that resource information included in the<br>
mode change response message is uplink bandwidth information in FIG. 15, the<br>
access terminal performs a mode change from the fast access mode 1330 into the<br>
active mode 1300, and transmits the data through a UL-TCH using the allocated<br>
uplink bandwidth (step 1519).<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 15 has shown the mode<br>
change process from the hold mode 1360 into the active mode 1300 in the traffic<br>
state 219, which is performed upon request from the access terminal.<br>
Hereinafter, a mode change process from the active mode 1300 into the hold<br>
mode 1360 in the traffic state 219, which is performed upon request from the<br>
access terminal, will be described with reference to FIG. 16.<br>
FIG. 16 is a signal flowchart illustrating a message transmitting/receiving<br>
process for a mode change from the active mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360,<br>
which is performed upon the request from the access terminal and is shown in<br>
FIG. 13. Referring to FIG. 16, first, when the access terminal determines to<br>
perform a mode change from the active mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360, the<br>
access terminal transmits a mode change request message to the access point<br>
through a UL-TCH (step 1611). When the access point receives the mode<br>
change request message through the UL-TCH from the access terminal, the<br>
access point causes the fast access PN code information or the fast access time<br>
slot information, which the access terminal uses in the fast access mode 1330, to<br>
be included in a mode change response message which is a response message to<br>
the mode change request message, thereby transmitting the fast access PN code<br>
information or the fast access time slot information to the access terminal through<br>
an DL-TCH (step 1613). The reason why the access point transmits the fast<br>
access PN code information or the fast access time slot information to the access<br>
terminal is that the access terminal does not perform normal uplink access of a<br>
contention-based scheme, but performs fast uplink access of a contention-free<br>
scheme when the access terminal in the hold mode 1360 has to transmit data to<br>
the access point. Therefore, the access point transmits the fast access PN code<br>
information or the fast access time slot information through the mode change<br>
response message. Also, the reason the access point transmits the fast access<br>
PN code information or the fast access time slot information is that the access<br>
terminal does not monitor the DL-BCCH in the hold mode 1360.<br>
When the access terminal receives the mode change response message<br>
through the DL-TCH in the active mode 1300, the access terminal performs a<br>
mode change from the active mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360. After this, in<br>
the hold mode 1360, the access terminal monitors a DL-WUCH, and periodically<br>
determines whether a wake-up indicator is turned on or off (step 1615).<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 16 has shown the mode<br>
change process from the active mode 1300 into the hold mode 1360 in the traffic<br>
state 219, which is performed upon request from the access terminal<br>
Hereinafter, a mode change process from the hold mode 1360 into the active<br>
mode 1300 m the traffic state 219, which is performed upon request from the<br>
access point, will be described with reference to FIG. 17<br>
FIG.17 is a signal flochart illustrating a mode change process from the hold<br>
mode 1360 into the active mode 1300, which is performed upon the request<br>
from the access point and is shown in FIG. 13. First, as described with reference<br>
to FIG.16 the access performs a mode change from the active mode<br><br>
1300 into the hold mode 1360 according to a request generated from the active mode<br>
 terminal (steps 1711 and 1713).Next,when the access point senses that data to<br>
be transmitted to the access terminal which is in the hold mode 1360 is<br>
generated,the access point sets a wake-up indicator corresponding to the access<br><br>
terminal to 'on', and transmits a DL-WUCH to the access terminal (step 1715).<br><br>
The access terminal receives the DL-WUCH including the croresponding wake-<br><br>
up indicator which is which is set to 'on' , and performs a mode change from the hold<br>
mode 1360 into the fast access mode 1330. After this, in the fast access mode<br>
1330, the access terminal transmits a mode change response message to the<br>
access point through a UL-FACCH, using a fast access PN code or a fast access<br>
time slot which is allocated from the access point in the active mode 1300 (step<br>
1717). When the access point receives the mode change response message<br>
from the access terminal through the UL-FACCH, the access point transmits the<br>
data to the access terminal through a DL-TCH (step 1719). While the above<br>
description is given for the case in which the access terminal performs a mode<br>
change from the hold mode 1360 into the fast access mode 1330 when receiving<br>
a DL-WUCH in which a corresponding wake-up indicator is set to 'on', and<br>
transmits a mode change response message, it will be understood that the access<br>
terminal may perform a mode change from the hold mode 1360 into the active<br>
mode 1300 when receiving a DL-WUCH in which a corresponding wake-up<br>
indicator is set to 'on', and transmit the data directly to the access point.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 17 has shown the mode<br>
change process from the hold mode 1360 into the active mode 1300, which is<br>
performed upon request from the access point and is shown in FIG. 13.<br>
Hereinafter, a message transmitting/receiving process for a mode change process<br>
from the hold mode 1360 into the active mode 1300, which is performed upon<br>
request from the access point, will be described with reference to FIG. 18.<br>
FIG. 18 is a signal flowchart illustrating a message transmitting/receiving<br>
process for a mode change process from the hold mode 1360 into the active mode<br>
1300, which is performed upon request from the access point and is shown in FIG.<br>
13. Referring to FIG. 18, first, as described with reference to FIG. 17, when the<br>
access point senses that data to be transmitted to the access terminal which is in<br>
the hold mode 1360 is generated, the access point sets a wake-up indicator<br>
corresponding to the access terminal to 'on', and transmits a DL-WUCH to the<br>
access terminal (step 1811). The access terminal receives the DL-WUCH<br>
including the corresponding wake-up indicator which is set to 'on', and performs<br>
a mode change from the hold mode 1360 into the fast access mode 1330. After<br>
this, in the fast access mode 1330, the access terminal transmits a mode change<br>
response message to the access point through a UL-FACCH, using a fast access<br>
PN code or a fast access time slot which is allocated from the access point in the<br>
active mode 1300. Next, the access terminal performs a mode change from the<br>
fast access mode 1330 into the active mode 1300 (step 1813). Then, the access<br>
point receives the mode change response message from the access terminal<br>
through the UL-FACCH, and transmits the data to the access terminal through a<br>
DL-TCH (step 1815). While the above description is given for the case in<br>
which the access terminal performs.a mode change from the hold mode 1360 into<br>
the fast access mode 1330 when receiving a DL-WUCH in which a<br>
corresponding wake-up indicator is set to 'on', and transmits a mode change<br>
response message, it will be understood that the access terminal may perform a<br>
mode change from the hold mode 1360 into the active mode 1300 when receiving<br>
a DL-WUCH in which a corresponding wake-up indicator is set to 'on', and<br>
transmit data directly to the access point.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 18 has shown the message<br>
transmitting/receiving process for a mode change process from the hold mode<br>
1360 into the active mode 1300, which is performed upon request from the access<br>
point and is shown in FIG. 13. Hereinafter, a message transmitting/receiving<br>
process for a mode change process from the hold mode 1360 into the active mode<br>
1300, which is performed upon request from the access terminal, will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 19.<br>
FIG. 19 is a signal flowchart illustrating a message transmitting/receiving<br>
process for a mode change process from the hold mode 1360 into the active mode<br>
1300, which is performed upon request from the access terminal and is shown in<br>
FIG. 13. Referring to FIG. 19, as described with reference to FIG. 13, when the<br>
access terminal, which is in the hold mode 1360, senses that data to be<br>
transmitted to the access point are generated, the access terminal performs a<br>
mode change from the hold mode 1360 into the fast access mode 1330. After<br>
this, in the fast access mode 1330, the access terminal transmits a mode change<br>
request message to the access point through a UL-FACCH, using a fast access PN<br>
code or a fast access time slot allocated from the access point in the active mode<br>
1300 (step 1911). When the access point receives the mode change request<br>
message from the access terminal through the UL-FACCH, the access point<br>
allocates a resource to the access terminal, and transmits a mode change response<br>
message, which includes the allocated resource information, to the access<br>
terminal through a DL-USCCH (step 1913).<br>
Here, 'resource' means either an uplink bandwidth or a fast access PN<br>
code or a fast access time slot. When the access point can allocate an uplink<br>
bandwidth to an access terminal, the uplink bandwidth becomes the 'resource'.<br>
In contrast, as described above, when the access point cannot allocate an uplink<br>
bandwidth to an access terminal because there is no currently available uplink<br>
bandwidth, the fast access PN code or the fast access time slot becomes the<br>
'resource'. Meanwhile, while the above description is given for the case in<br>
which the access terminal receives a mode change response message in response<br>
to a mode change request message, the access terminal may determines that the<br>
access terminal receives the mode change response message also in a case in<br>
which the access terminal receives not the mode change response message itself<br>
but only the DL-USCCH. When it is assumed that resource information<br>
included in the mode change response message is uplink bandwidth information<br>
in FIG. 19, the access terminal performs a mode change from the fast access<br>
mode 1330 into the active mode 1300, and transmits the data through a UL-TCH<br>
using the allocated uplink bandwidth (step 1915).<br>
As described above, an apparatus and a method according to the present<br>
invention provides new operational states of a MAC layer suitable to a broadband<br>
wireless access communication system, thereby having an advantage in that it is<br>
possible to support the fast data transmission and the mobility of an access<br>
terminal. In addition, an apparatus and a method according to the present<br>
invention, that provide new operational states of a MAC layer suitable to a<br>
broadband wireless access communication system, has an advantage in that an<br>
access terminal can achieve the fast access while minimizing the power<br>
consumption. In addition, an apparatus and a method according to the present<br>
invention, that provide new operational states of a MAC layer suitable to a<br>
broadband wireless access communication system, has an advantage in that it is<br>
possible to minimize the power consumption of an access terminal when the data<br>
transmission/reception is temporarily interrupted while it is possible maximize<br>
the data transmission efficiency by performing the fast access when the data<br>
transmission/reception is resumed.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
