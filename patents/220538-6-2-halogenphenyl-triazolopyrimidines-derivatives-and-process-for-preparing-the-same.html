Substituted 6- (2-halogenphenyl) -triazolopyrimidines<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to substituted 6-(2-halogenphenyl)-triazolopyrimidines of formula I<br>
  I<br>
in which Ri <br>
a 5- or 6-membered saturated, "unsaturated, or aromatic heterocycle, containing one to four nitrogen atoms or one to three nitrogen atoms and one sulfur or oxygen atom,<br>
wherein R1 and R2 radicals may be unsubstituted or partly or fully halogenated or may carry one to three groups Ra,<br><br>
C2_C6-alkynyl, Cs-Cg-alkynyloxy, or Ci-C4-alkylenedioxy;<br>
R2   denote hydrogen, or a group mentioned for R1; or<br>
R1 and R2 together with the interjacent nitrogen atom represent a saturated or partially unsaturated 5- or 6-membered heterocycle, containing one to four nitrogen atoms or one to three nitrogen atoms and one sulfur or oxygen atom, which ring may be substituted by one to three Ra radicals;<br>
Hal  is halogen;<br>
L1,L3 independently denote hydrogen, halogen, or C1-C4-alkyl;<br>
L2   is hydrogen, halogen, C1-C4-haloalkyl, or NH2, NHRb, or N(Rb)2,<br><br><br>
wherein at least one from L1, L2, and L3 is not hydrogen;<br>
X    is halogen, cyano, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-haloalkoxy or C3-C8-alkenyloxy.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to processes for their preparation, compositions containing them and to their use for combating phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
6-Phenyl-7-amino-triazolopyrimidines are generally known from US 4,567,262, and EP-A 550 113.<br>
Triazolopyrimidines with a trifluorophenyl group in 6-position are disclosed in WO 98/46607 and EP-A 945 453. From EP-A 834 513 diverse 6-pentafluorophenyl-triazolopyrimidines are known.<br>
The compounds disclosed in the documents discussed above are said to be active against various phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds having improved fungicidal activity.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the compounds defined at the outset. Furthermore, we have found processes for their preparation, compositions comprising them and methods for controlling phytopathogenic fungi using the compounds I.<br>
The compounds of formula I	differ from the compounds known from<br>
closest prior art EP-A 945	453 and EP-A 834 513 in the 6-(2-halo-<br>
genphenyl) group, which is	further substituted in 3-, 4- and/or<br>
5-position.<br>
Compounds of formula I can be prepared similar to the conditions known from EP-A 550 113. Preferably the preparation of compounds of formula I as defined above comprises reacting 5-amino-triazole 1 with 2-(2-halogenphenyl)-substituted malonic acid ester of formula II, in which<br><br><br>
R represents alkyl, preferably C1-C6-alkyl, in particular methyl or ethyl, under alkaline conditions, preferably using high boiling tertiary amines as for example tri-n-butylamine as disclosed for example by EP-A 770 615 to yield compounds of formula III.<br>
The resulting 5,7-dihydroxy-6-phenyl-triazolopyrimidine of formula III, wherein L1 to L3 are as defined for formula I, is subsequently treated with a halogenating agent, preferably with a bro-minating or chlorinating agent, such as phosphorus oxybromide or phosphorus oxychloride, neat or in the presence of a solvent to give IV, wherein Y is halogen, such as chlorine or bromine.<br><br>
The reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from 0°C to 150°C, the preferred reaction temperature being from 80°C to 125°C as disclosed for example by EP-A 770 615.<br>
Dihalotriazolopyrimidine IV is further reacted with an amine of formula V <br>
in which R1 and R2 are as defined in formula I to produce compounds of formula I in which X is halogen.<br>
The reaction between the 5,7-dihalo compound IV and the amine of formula V can be carried out under conditions known from WO 98/46608. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include ethers, such as dioxane, diethyl ether and, especially, tetrahydrofuran, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene.<br><br>
the reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from 0°C to 70°C, the preferred reaction temperature being from 10°C to 35°C.<br>
It is also preferred that the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include tertiary amines, such as tri ethyl amine, and inorganic bases, such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate. Alternatively, an excess of the compound of formula V may serve as a base.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which X denotes cyano, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-haloalkoxy or C3-C8-alkenyloxy can be prepared by reacting compounds I' in which Y is halogen, preferably chloro, with compounds of formula VI, which are, dependent from the value of X' to be introduced to yield formula I compounds, an anorganic cyano salt, an alkoxylate, haloalkoxylate or an alkenyloxylate, respectively, preferably in the presence of a solvent. The cation M in formula VI has minor influence; for practical and economical reasons usually ammonium-, tetraalkylammonium- or alkalimetal- and earth metal salts are preferred.<br><br>
The reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from 0 to 120°C, the preferred reaction temperature being from 10 to 40°C [cf. J. Heterocycl. Chem. Vol.12, p. 861-863 (1975)] .<br>
Suitable solvents include ethers, such as dioxane, diethyl ether and, especially, tetrahydrofuran, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene .<br>
Compounds of formula I in which X denotes C1-C6-alkyl can be prepared by reacting compounds I in which X is halogen, preferably chloro, with malonic acid esters of formula VII, wherein X" denotes H or C1-C5-alkyl and R denotes C1-C4~alkyl, to compounds of formula VIII and decarboxylation under conditions described in US 5,994,360.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to the novel intermediates of formulae II, III and IV..<br>
The compounds of formula II are preferably prepared by reaction of the corresponding substituted bromobenzenes with sodium dial-kylmalonates in the presence of a copper (I) salt [cf. Chemistry Letters, pp. 367-370, 1981; EP-A 10 02 788].<br>
The compounds of formula II may also be prepared by reaction of an alkyl 2-(2-halogenphenyl)-acetate with dialkylcarbonate in the presence of a strong base, preferably sodium ethoxide and sodium hydride (cf. Heterocycles, pp. 1031-1047, 1996).<br>
The substituted phenylacetates which are the starting compounds for compounds of formula II are known and commercially available, and/or they are obtainable by generally known methods.<br>
The reaction mixtures are worked up in a customary manner, for example by mixing with water, phase separation and, if required, chromatographic purification of the crude products. Some of the end products are obtained in the form of colorless or slightly brownish, viscous oils, which are purified or freed from volatile components under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperatures. If the end products are obtained as solids, purification can also be carried out by recrystallization or digestion.<br>
If individual compounds I are not obtainable by the routes described above, they can be prepared by derivatization of other<br>
compounds I.<br>

To this mixture 5-chloro-6- (2-chloro-4-f luorophenyl) -7- (4-methylpiperidin-l-yl) - [1,2,4]-triazolo-[1,5-a]-pyrimidine (4.71 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to 60°C and stirred for about 20 hours. Aqueous ammonium chloride (50 ml) was added and the mixture was acidified with diluted HC1. The reaction mixture was extracted with MTBE. The combined organic phases were dried and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography.<br>
The pure product obtained was diluted in concentrated HC1 and heated to 80°C for about 24 hours. This reaction mixture was cooled and adjusted to pH of 5 by addition of aqueous NaOH, and sub-<br><br>
sequently extracted with MTBE. The combined organic phases were dried, concentrated and purified by column chromatography to yield 0,78 g of the title compound of mp. 236°C.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples for the action against harmful fungi<br>
The fungicidal action of the compounds of formula I was demonstrated by the following experiments:<br>
The active ingredients, separately or jointly, were used to prepare a stock solution comprising 0.25 % by weight of active ingredient in acetone or DMSO. 1% by weight of the emulsifier Uni-perol EL (emulsifying and dispersing wetter based on ethoxylated alkylphenols) was added to this solution and the mixture was diluted with water to give the desired concentration.<br>
Use Example 1 - Fungicidal control of early blight on tomatoes (Alternaria solani)<br>
Leaves of pot grown tomato seedlings of the "Gro£e Fleischtomate St. Pierre" variety were sprayed with an aqueous suspension containing the active compound in the concentration mentioned below. The next day the leaves were infected with a zoospore suspension of Alternaria solani   (0.17xl06 spores per ml of a 2% strength bio-malt solution). The plants were then placed in a water vapour-saturated chamber at 20 to 22°C. After 5 days the disease had spread to such a great extent on the untreated plants that the fungicidal activity of the substances could be assessed.<br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with 250 ppm of compounds 1-2, 1-4, 1-8, 1-17, 1-20, 1-21, 1-25, 1-28, 1-90, 1-91, 1-94, 1-97, and 1-101, resp., showed an infection of not more than 7 %, whereas the untrated plants were infected to 90 %.<br>
Use Example 2 - Control of gray mould {Botrytis  cinerea)   on paprika leaves<br>
Paprika seedlings were sprayed to run-off at the four- to five leave stage with an aqueous suspension containing the concentration of active ingredient mentioned below.  The next day the plants were inoculated with a spore suspension of Botrytis cinerea containing 1.7xl06 spores per ml in 2 wt. % aqueous biomalt solution. The infected plants were then incubated in chambers with high humidity for five days at 22-24°C. The extent of fungus spread was assessed as %-attack of the whole leaf surface.<br><br>
In this test, the plants which had been	treated with 250 ppm of<br>
compounds 1-2, 1-4, 1-5, 1-8," 1-17, and	1-20, resp., showed an<br>
infection of not more than 5 %, whereas	the the unteated plants<br>
.were infected to 85 %.<br>
Use Example 3 - Fungicidal control of grape downy mildew (Plasmo-para viticola)<br>
Leaves of potted vines of the "Miiller Thurgau" variety were sprayed with aqueous liquors made from a stock solution containing the concentration of active ingredient mentioned below. The next day they were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Plasmopara viticola  by spraying it at the lower leaf-side. Then the trial plants were transferred for 48 h to a humid chamber with about 24°C and a relative humidity close to 100 %. For a period of 5 days, cultivation followed in a greenhouse at 20 to 30°C. To stimulate the outbreak of the disease symptoms, the plants were transferred to a humid chamber again for 16 hours. Then the extent of fungal attack on the lower leaf surface was visually assessed as % diseased leaf area.<br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with 250 ppm of compounds 1-2, 1-4, 1-8, 1-17, and 1-20, resp., showed an infection of not more than 15 %, whereas the unteated plants were infected to 95 %.<br>
Use Example 4 - Action on Pyricularia oryzae   (protective action)<br>
Leaves of pot grown rice seedlings of the "Tai-Nong 67" variety were sprayed to runoff with an aqueous suspension, containing the concentration of active ingredient mentioned below. The next day the plants were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Pyricularia oryzae.   The plants were then placed for 6 days in a humid chamber at 22 to 24°C and a relative humidity of 95 to 99 %. The extent of fungus spread was assessed as %-attack of the whole leaf surface.<br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with 250 ppm of compounds 1-2, 1-4, 1-5, and 1-20, resp., showed an infection of not more than 15%, whereas the unteated plants were infected to 80 %.<br><br>
Use Example 5 - Control of net blotch on barley caused by Pyrenophora  teres<br>
Leaves of pot grown barley seedlings of the variety "Igri" were sprayed to run-off with an aqueous suspension, containing the concentration of active ingredient mentioned below. The next day the treated plants were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Pyrenophora   [syn.   Drechslera]   teres.   Then the trial plants were immediately transferred to a humid chamber in the greenhouse. After 6 days of cultivation at 20-24°C and a relative humidity close to 100 %, the extent of fungal attack on the leaves was visually assessed as % diseased leaf area.<br>
In this test, which had been treated with 250 ppm of compounds 1-21, 1-25, 1-28, 1-43, 1-45, 1-91, 1-94, and 1-97, resp., showed an infection of not more than 10 %, whereas the untreated plants were infected to 90 %<br><br><br><br>
