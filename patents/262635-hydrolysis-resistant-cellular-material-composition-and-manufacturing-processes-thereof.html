HYDROLYSIS-RESISTANT CELLULAR MATERIAL, COMPOSITION AND<br>
MANUFACTURING PROCESSES THEREOF.<br>
The present invention relates to cellular<br>
materials, more particularly to soft and flexible<br>
materials made from expanded polyurethane polymer,<br>
especially those that can be used to make sealing,<br>
insulating or damping components.<br>
Such materials can be used, among others, in the<br>
automotive industry and in industries that manufacture<br>
various electrical devices. By way of example of their<br>
use in the automotive industry, mention may be made of<br>
foamed seals that are intended for fitting onto types<br>
of doors, door trims, headlights, air conditioning<br>
units, etc.<br>
The production of these foamed polyurethane seals<br>
is carried out by depositing, by extrusion onto the<br>
part that has to be equipped with the seal, a material<br>
of suitable viscosity that develops into a foam by<br>
crosslinking in the open air or in a controlled<br>
atmosphere. The application of the material may be able<br>
Lo be carried out in a groove, on a former or on a<br>
smooth surface.<br>
Foam layers can also be manufactured, the material<br>
of suitable viscosity being deposited by extrusion as a<br>
sheet onto a medium such as paper or a glass fabric<br>
impregnated with silicone or with a fluorinated<br>
product, etc., or a plastic film, then, after<br>
adjustment of the sheet thickness and foaming and<br>
crosslinking of the product, the layer is peeled off<br>
then cut to the desired dimensions of the seals.<br>
Alternatively, the foam is laid on a non-nonstick<br>
substrate, such as a polyester film, that forms an<br>
integral part of the finished cellular product.<br>
The material to be deposited may be prepared in<br>
advance and be of a stable form that can be stored in<br>
an inert atmosphere until it is used. Such a system is<br>
said to be a "one-component" system. Or else the<br>
material to be deposited is formed from components<br><br>
stored separately from one another and mixed together<br>
in appropriate quantities just before application,<br>
using metering and mixing devices. This system is said<br>
to be a "two-component" system.<br>
For a more detailed description of these<br>
techniques, the reader may refer to European patent<br>
0 930 323 Bl in the name of the applicant company.<br>
These foamed materials must pass many tests to<br>
verify that their mechanical properties, their<br>
temperature behavior and their aging resistance,<br>
especially in a humid environment, meet the standards<br>
established by automobile manufacturers. These<br>
standards are becoming increasingly stringent.<br>
There is a risk of hydrolysis of the foamed<br>
polyurethane seals when in prolonged contact with<br>
water. Automobile manufacturers have developed<br>
stringent aging tests in pressurized autoclaves that<br>
make it possible to evaluate the hydrolysis resistance.<br>
To the knowledge of the applicant company, the foamed<br>
polyurethane seals currently on the market do not give<br>
results that meet the latest requirements of automobile<br>
manufacturers.<br>
Seeking to improve such foamed materials, the<br>
applicant company has discovered that the use of a<br>
specific family of polyols for incorporating into the<br>
formulation of the polymer matrix makes it possible to<br>
achieve the desired results. It is this use which is<br>
the subject of the present invention.<br>
Therefore one subject of the invention is<br>
firstly the use of at least one polyol (P) chosen from<br>
polyester and polyether polyols grafted by chains of at<br>
least one of the following: polystyrene, polyacrylo-<br>
nitrile and styrene/polyacrylonitrile copolymers and<br>
from polyester and polyether polyols in which at least<br>
one of the following: polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile<br>
and styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers is dispersed, as<br>
an incorporation into the formulation of the polyol<br>
constituent or of the polyol-polyamine constituent of a<br>
polyurethane forming the polymer matrix of a<br><br>
hydrolysis-resistant soft cellular material, said<br>
po.iyol or polyols (P) representing at least one part of<br>
said polyol constituent or at least one part of the<br>
polyol fraction of said polyol-polyamine constituent.<br>
The term "styrene/acrylonitrile copolymer" is<br>
understood to mean random copolymers, block copolymers<br>
and also combinations thereof.<br>
The polyols (P) according to the invention are<br>
especially polyether and polyester polyols, onto the<br>
backbone of which are grafted segments derived from at<br>
least one of the following: styrene and acrylonitrile.<br>
The backbones of the polyether and polyester polyols<br>
arc for example a poly(ethylene oxide), a<br>
poly (propylene oxide) or a poly (propylene oxide-<br>
ethylene oxide).<br>
In a graft PO/PE polyether polyol, the backbone<br>
is: a copolymer incorporating ethylene oxide units and<br>
propylene oxide units, such copolymers possibly being<br>
block copolymers, in which an ethylene oxide oligomer<br>
is attached to a propylene oxide oligomer; random<br>
coploymers, where the ethylene oxide subunits and the<br>
propylene oxide subunits are randomly distributed; or<br>
polymers which are a combination of block polymers and<br>
random polymers.<br>
Examples of graft polyether polyols may be found<br>
in US patent US-A-4 670 477 in which they are described<br>
as modified polyether polyols. Poly (ethylene<br>
oxide/propylene oxide) ether polyols, in which at least<br>
one of either polystyrene or polyacrylonitrile is<br>
dispersed, are also described.<br>
Graft polyols can be obtained commercially from<br>
several companies. Mention may be made of the polyols<br>
called "Polymer Polyol" by Bayer, those called "Graft<br>
Polyol" by BASF and those called "Co-polymer Polyol" by<br>
Dow.<br>
The polyol or polyols (P) advantageously represent<br>
at least 5% by weight, especially 10% by weight, of the<br>
polyol constituent or of the polyol-polyamine<br>
constituent of the polyurethane prepolymer.<br><br>
The cellular material may be in strip, sheet,<br>
strand or tube form for a seal, or part of a seal, for<br>
sealing, insulating or damping.<br>
Another subject of the present invention is a<br>
composition intended for forming the polyurethane<br>
polymer matrix of a hydrolysis-resistant soft cellular<br>
material, characterized in that it comprises:<br>
(A)	a polyol constituent formed from at least one<br>
polyol of functionality at least equal to 2 or a<br>
polyol-polyamine constituent formed from at least one<br>
polyol of functionality at least equal to 2 and from at<br>
least one polyamine of functionality at least equal to<br>
2, at least one part of said polyol constituent or of<br>
the polyol fraction of said polyol-polyamine<br>
constituent being formed by at least one polyol (P)<br>
chosen from polyester and polyether polyols grafted by<br>
chains of at least one of the following: polystyrene,<br>
polyacrylonitrile and styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers<br>
and from polyester and polyether polyols in which at<br>
least one of the following: polystyrene, polyacrylo-<br>
nitrile and styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers is<br>
dispersed; and<br>
(B)	a polyisocyanate constituent,<br>
the quantities of constituents (A) and (B) being<br>
especially chosen in such as way that said constituents<br>
(A) and (B) are able to react in an NCO/(OH+NH2) molar<br>
ratio of at least 2, especially of about 2 to 5,<br>
preferentially 2 to 3.5.<br>
The polyol or polyols other than the polyols (P)<br>
and the polyamines capable of being incorporated into<br>
the formulation of constituent (A) may be chosen from<br>
the polyols and polyamines respectively having a<br>
backbone" of the type: polyester; polycaprolactone;<br>
polyether; polyolefin, especially hydroxylated EVA<br>
copolymer; saturated or unsaturated polybutadiene;<br>
polyisoprene; and polydimethylsiloxane, for example:<br>
either of aliphatic and/or aromatic polyester<br>
type, preferably mostly aliphatic, especially derived<br><br>
from aliphatic glycols, possibly diethylene glycol, and<br>
from aliphatic and/or aromatic acids; or<br>
of polyether type, especially polyethylene oxide<br>
and/or polypropylene oxide or polytetrahydrofuran.<br>
The polyol or polyol-polyamine constituent is<br>
advantageously an oligomer with a molecular weight of<br>
around 10 000 g/mol or less, preferably of about 500 to<br>
4 000 g/mol, and particularly from 1 500 to<br>
3 50 0 g/mol.<br>
Its functionality is preferably about 2 as an<br>
upper value, and particularly from 1 500 to<br>
3 50 0 g/mol.<br>
Constituent (B) may be chosen from simple<br>
molecules, in particular aromatic molecules, having at<br>
least two isocyanate functional groups, and also<br>
oligomers (of molecular weights which may especially be<br>
chosen from the abovementioned ranges), the above<br>
isocyanatcs modified in the form of prepolymers, and<br>
Isocyanate prepolymers, these oligomers and<br>
prepolymers, of functionality at least equal to 2,<br>
having isocyanate end groups.<br>
The isocyante or isocyanates forming constituent<br>
(B) may thus be chosen from para-phenyl ene<br>
diisocyanate, trans-1,4-cyclohexane diisocyanate,<br>
3-i socyanatomethyl-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexyl iso-<br>
cyanate, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, methylenebis-<br>
(4-phenyl isocyanate) (pure MDI), crude MDI, toluene<br>
2,4-diisocyanate (2,4-TDI), toluene 2,6-diisocyanate<br>
(2,6-TDI) and their mixtures, such as 80/20 TDI<br>
comprising 80% of the 2,4 isomer or 65/35 TDI, and also<br>
crude TDI (unpurified 80/20 TDI) .<br>
Among these compounds, crude or pure MDI or a<br>
mixture of the two is most particularly preferred.<br>
For the isocyanate compound, the functionality is<br>
preferably about 2 as an upper value, particularly<br>
about 2 to 2.8.<br>
The composition according to the invention may<br>
comprise, in addition, at least one conventional<br>
additive chosen from: particulate or pulverulent,<br><br>
organic or mineral fillers such as calcium carbonate<br>
and carbon black; plasticizers, colorants, stabilizers,<br>
surfactants, cell regulators and catalysts, said<br>
additive or additives usually being combined with<br>
constituent (A).<br>
The term "filler" is understood to mean here, in a<br>
general way, a product that is neither soluble in nor<br>
m.iscible with the polymer matrix, but is dispersible in<br>
the latter, making it possible to improve one or more<br>
properties or characteristics (mechanical properties,<br>
chemical properties, color, production cost) of the<br>
final compound.<br>
In compliance with a first embodiment of the<br>
composition according to the invention, the composition<br>
is in the form of a viscous paste (one-component<br>
product) consisting of the polyurethane prepolymer<br>
having isocyanate end groups resulting from the<br>
reaction between constituents (A) and (B) with possible<br>
incorporation of at least one additive.<br>
Such a reaction is well known to those skilled in<br>
the art, the reaction temperatures and times varying<br>
according to the constituents used.<br>
The polyurethane prepolymer having isocyanate end<br>
groups may, according to one variant, have undergone a<br>
trlalkoxysilylation reaction to yield a polyurethane<br>
prepolymer with trialkoxysilyl end groups. A<br>
trialkoxysilane capable of reacting with an NCO group<br>
may be a trialkoxyaminosilane, for example, an<br>
aminopropyltrialkoxysilane such as aminopropyl-<br>
trimethoxysilane or even a trialkoxymercaptosilane.<br>
In compliance with a second embodiment of the<br>
composition according to the invention, constituents<br>
(A) and (B) are intended to be mixed just before use<br>
(two-component system), in the presence of water- as<br>
foaming agent, said mixture then being extruded at the<br>
time of application onto the part or support to give<br>
the cellular material.<br>
Yet another subject of the invention is a process<br>
for manufacturing a cellular material by extrusion of a<br><br>
composition as is defined above, characterized in that<br>
it comprises steps consisting:<br>
' a) preparing a poiyurethane prepolymer by the<br>
reaction of constituents (A) and (B) such as those<br>
defined above (one-component product);<br>
b)	possibly storing said one-component product away<br>
from moisture;<br>
c)	mixing said product with a pressurized gas to form<br>
an extrudable material;<br>
d)	extruding a quantity of extrudable material in<br>
order to obtain an extruded material, the foaming of<br>
which has been activated; and<br>
e)	proceeding with the foaming, and crosslinking the<br>
extruded material in a humid atmosphere.<br>
The pressurized gas may be preferably nitrogen,<br>
but also any other gas known for this purpose, namely<br>
air, carbon dioxide, n-pentane, etc.<br>
The crosslinking treatment in a humid atmosphere<br>
may be carried out under conditions known to those<br>
skilled in the art, for example in a temperature range<br>
from room temperature to 80 °C and in an atmosphere<br>
having a relative humidity of about 4 0 to 100%.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process<br>
for manufacturing a cellular material by extrusion of a<br>
composition such as is defined above, characterized in<br>
that it comprises steps consisting:<br>
a)	mixing, in the presence of water, the two<br>
constituents (A) and (B) which, stored separately, form<br>
a two-component system, so as to obtain an extrudable<br>
material, the water having been added to constituent<br>
(A) from the start or being introduced only at the time<br>
of mixing;<br>
b)	extruding a quantity of extrudable material; and<br>
c)	letting the crosslinking proceed in the open air<br>
or in a controlled environment.<br>
At step d) of the first abovementioned process or<br>
at step b) of the second abovementioned process, the<br>
extrudable material may be deposited on a part that is<br>
intended to receive it, in particular, said material<br><br>
may be deposited as a band, or a strand or a ring in<br>
order to form a sealing, insulating or damping seal on<br>
said part.<br>
It could also be possible to envisage an extrusion<br>
into a mold that has a nonstick surface bearing the<br>
negative imprint of the surface of the part, followed<br>
by transfer onto this surface.<br>
At step d) of the first abovementioned process or<br>
at step b) of the second abovementioned process, the<br>
extrudable material may also be deposited as a band, a<br>
layer or a disk on a support such as paper or a glass<br>
fabric impregnated with silicone, a fluorinated<br>
product, etc., or a plastic film, the support/extruded<br>
material assembly may possibly be passed between two<br>
roils, to control the thickness of the extruded<br>
material, and then the foamed extruded material,<br>
possibly cut into the desired shapes and sizes for the<br>
sealing, insulating or dampening seal, may be detached.<br>
The term "extrusion" is understood to mean here,<br>
in the broad sense, a technique in which a material in<br>
the fluid or viscous state is transported to an<br>
application orifice or nozzle. This term does not limit<br>
the invention to a technique for conforming the<br>
material, the latter being free to adopt, on exiting<br>
the orifice, dimensions substantially different from<br>
those of the nozzle outlet.<br>
Finally, the present invention also relates to a<br>
hydrolysis-resistant cellular material, obtained by<br>
extrusion of a polyurethane prepolymer having<br>
isocyanate end groups, foaming having been carried out<br>
by injection of pressurized gas and/or by chemical<br>
reaction between water and said isocyanate end groups,<br>
at Least one polyol (P) is chosen from polyester and<br>
polyether polyols grafted by chains of at least one of<br>
the following: polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile and<br>
styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers and from polyester and<br>
polyether polyols in which at least one of the<br>
following: polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile and<br>
s tyrene/acr.ylonitrile copolymers is dispersed, being<br><br>
incorporated into the formulation of the polyol<br>
constituent or of the polyol-polyamine constituent of a<br>
po.l.yurethane forming the polymer matrix of said<br>
cellular material, said polyol or polyols (P)<br>
representing at least one part of said polyol<br>
constituent or at least one part of the polyol fraction<br>
of said polyol-polyamine constituent.<br>
The cellular material is advantageously in the<br>
form of a strip, a sheet, a strand or a tube for a<br>
sealing, insulating or damping seal.<br>
It may have been firmly attached to the part to<br>
which it is intended to be applied in order to ensure<br>
scaling, the reverse part then becoming fixed to the<br>
part/seal assembly by any mechanical means suitable for<br>
compressing the seal.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present<br>
invention without however limiting the scope thereof.<br>
In these examples, the percentages are given by weight,<br>
except where otherwise indicated.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of a polyurethane prepolymer<br>
A polyurethane prepolymer was prepared by reacting<br>
a polyether grafted by a styrene/acrylonitrile<br>
copolymer with methylenebis(4-phenyl isocyanate) (MDI).<br>
This graft polyether is the one sold in the LUPRANOL<br>
range by BASF; it is characterized by an OH number~~of"i'<br>
around 19.8 (expressed in mg of KOH per gram of<br>
product). The MDI used was a mixture of pure MDI having<br>
a functionality of 2 and a content of isocyanate NCO<br>
groups of 33.5% (in wt% of NCO equivalents per gram of<br>
product) and crude MDI having a functionality of 2.7<br>
and a content of isocyanate NCO groups of 31.5% (in wt%<br>
of NCO equivalents per gram of product). The crude MDI<br>
represented 24% by weight of the total weight of<br>
isocyanates. .<br>
50 kg of LUPRANOL were placed in a mixer with<br>
surface flushing by dry air and were heated to a<br>
temperature of about 95°C.<br><br>
5.8 kg of pure MDI and 1.8 kg of crude MDI were<br>
then added so that the initial NCO/OH molar ratio was<br>
3.4, and the mixture was homogenized with moderate<br>
st i.rring.<br>
When the theoretical NCO percentage content was<br>
reached, an aminc-type catalyst, in an amount of 0.275%<br>
of the product, 0.4% of carbon black and 0.25% of a<br>
silicone surfactant were added. After homogenizing, the<br>
product was rapidly packaged under a dry atmosphere.<br>
Manufacture of a cellular material<br>
The one-component product prepared above was<br>
extruded in the presence of pressurized nitrogen in a<br>
foaming machine of the type disclosed in<br>
EP-A-0 654 2 97, comprising:<br>
—	a stock of the product and means of heating said<br>
product to the extrusion temperature;<br>
—	a mixer devi.ee fitted with a delivery tube for the<br>
viscous product and a delivery tube for the pressurized<br>
nitrogen; and<br>
—	a delivery tube for the extrudable material<br>
equipped with a extrusion nozzle.<br>
Under the effect of the temperature and pressure<br>
in the chamber of the mixing device, the nitrogen<br>
dissolved in the one-component product. At the exit of<br>
the extrusion nozzle, the material was exposed to<br>
atmospheric pressure, the reduction in pressure<br>
bringing about the release of nitrogen with the<br>
formation of gas bubbles that expanded the polymer.<br>
The extrusion conditions were adapted in order to<br>
form an extruded strand of around 6 mm in diameter. The<br>
nozzle was heated to 35°C so as to keep the viscosity<br>
of the material at the desired value on exiting the<br>
extrusion channel.<br>
The extrusion operation was followed by a step of<br>
crosslinking the extruded strand in a humid atmosphere<br>
under two types of conditions: at room temperature and<br>
at a relative -humidity of about 50 to 60%, or else in a<br>
hot atmosphere, for example at a temperature of 55°C to<br><br>
60 °C, and at a relative humidity of 85% to 95% in a<br>
suitable chamber.<br>
Elongation measurements<br>
The elongation of the cellular material as<br>
obtained was measured and then measured after<br>
hydrolysis (15 h in an autoclave at 120°C in a<br>
moisture-saturated atmosphere under the conditions of<br>
the ISO 2440 standard).<br>
The elongation was measured on 6 mm diameter rods<br>
in accordance with the DIN 53571 standard, with a pull<br>
rate of 300 mm/minute and a 100 mm gap between the<br>
j aws .<br>
Examples 2 to 4 of the invention<br>
The method of example 1 was followed (same NCO/OII<br>
molar ratio) except that in place of the gra.ft polyol,<br>
this same graft polyol was used as a blend with a<br>
polyether based on an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide<br>
mixture. The polyether based on an ethylene oxide/<br>

trademark LUPRANOL by BASF; it is characterized by an<br>
Oil number of around 2 8 (expressed in mg of KOH per gram<br>
of product).<br>
Examples 2 to 4 were differentiated by the<br>
relative proportions of these two constituents. The<br>
quantities (in kg) of these constituents are given in<br>

Evaluation of the hydrolytic degradation of the<br>
cellular materials by the change in their elongation<br>
value.<br>
Hydrolysis of a cellular material destroys the<br>
chains of the polyurethane matrix, which leads to an<br>
.increase in the elongation of said material. In other<br>
words, the less a material is degraded, the smaller its<br>
variation in elongation.<br>
The table below shows, for each of the examples of<br>
the invention, the percentage variation in elongation<br>
normalized with respect to the variation in elongation<br>
obtained with the cellular material of the comparative<br>
example.<br>
This table also shows the height shrinkage or loss<br>
of height (in %) of the seal after the same aging.<br><br>
This table clearly shows that the presence of<br>
polyether grafted by a styrene/acrylonitrile copolymer<br>
greatly reduces the degradation of the polyether<br>
chains.<br><br>
