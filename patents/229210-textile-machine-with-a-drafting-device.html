				<td>TEXTILE MACHINE WITH A DRAFTING DEVICE<br>
The invention relates to a textile machine with a drafting arrangement with several bottom rollers and with several pressure cylinders allocated to the bottom rollers in each case, whereby at least one pressure cylinder is capable of being moved from a loading position, in which the pressure cylinder is in contact under pressure with the bottom roller allocated to it, into a released position, in which the pressure cylinder is no longer in contact with the bottom roller allocated to it, and with at least one pressure rod in a draft zone of the drafting an^angement.<br>
Such drafting arrangements are known in many contexts, such as on combing machines and drawing frames. Fibre material, in the form of a fibre non-woven fleece material or of one or more fibre slivers, is introduced into the drafting arrangement and drawn between pairs of rollers, usually three in succession, each consisting as a rule of a bottom roller and a pressure cylinder In this situation, the circumferential speeds of the individual roller pairs increase in the direction of run of the fibre slivers, in order to achieve the drawing effect The principle is likewise known of arranging a pressure rod or pressure bar between the middle bottom roller and the middle pressure cylinder on the one hand, and the delivery bottom roller and the delivery pressure cylinder on the other, which together fonn the main drafting zone. The pressure bar serves to guide what are referred to as floating fibres, i.e. fibres which are not nipped between the two pairs of rollers. Ideally, the fibres are nipped in the main drafting zone either by the middle pair of rollers or by the delivery pair of rollers. However, because this ideal situation is not realistic, most of the fibres move in the interim uncontrolled in the drafting zone. In order nevertheless to be able to guide tiie fibres in a manner which to some extent is controlled, the pressure bar referred to is used.<br>
In order to intiroduce the fibre material into the drafting an'angement at the start of operations or after a broken sliver, and in order to be able to carry out cleaning, the pressure cylinder are usually capable of being moved out of the loading position or operating position into a released position, and are usually capable of being pivoted. The fibre material can tiien be laid on the bottom rollers, in order then for tine pressure cylinder<br><br>
to be brought out of the released position into the loading position. The pressure bar remains in its original position during this operation, so that the fibre material is guided beneath the pressure bar, with the pressure bar pressing onto the fibre material from above, to the delivery roller pair. This process is relatively elaborate, and the pressure bar can only be cleaned if there is no fibre material in the drafting an-angement.<br>
The problem of the present invention is to further design a textile machine of the type refen^ed to in the preamble in such a way that it is easier to handle.<br>
This problem is resolved with the textile machine of the type referred to in the preamble, in that upon the movement of at least one pressure cylinder the pressure bar is capable of movement with the said pressure cylinder. This arrangement allows, to advantage, the movement of the pressure bar with the transfer of the at least of one pressure cylinder from the loading position into the released position, so that the said pressure in no longer located in the drafting zone. Accordingly, good accessibility of both the fibre contact zone of the pressure bar as well as of the drafting arrangement is guaranteed, which is of advantage in particular for cleaning. This also allows for adjustments to the drafting an-angement to be made more easily thanks to the larger free areas in the drafting zone. In addition to this, when laid in the drafting anangement the fibre material can be guided directly, i.e, without deflection by a pressure bar, from the middle pair of rollers to the delivery roller pair. These advantages also pertain if the pressure bar is arranged in a front drafting zone of the drafting an-angement. as an alternative or in addition to a pressure bar in the main drafting zone.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention^ the at least of one pressure cylinder and the at least of one pressure bar are arranged in a pivot frame, so that, when this pivot frame is pivoted, the at least of one pressure cylinder can be pivoted from the loading position into the released position together with the pressure bar. Accordingly, all that is required is one handle in order for the at least of one pressure cylinder and the pressure bar to be pivoted.<br><br>
To advantage, the pivot frame comprises two pivot arms on the face sides of both the at least of one pressure cylinder as well as of the pressure bar. The two pivot arms are connected to one another by means of a common pivot axle.<br>
To advantage, at least two pressure cylinders are arranged in the pivot frame. In this advantageous embodiment, these are an intake pressure cylinder of an intake pair of rollers and a middle pressure cylinder of a middle pair of rollers. With combing machines in particular, the possibility arises of providing for only these two pressure cylinders in the pivot frame, since the combed sliver feed into the drafting arrangement exhibit very low adhesion and can therefore be disturbed very easily, so that, to advantage, as few interventions as possible are to be made on the combed sliver in the event of a fault needing to be rectified. If, for example, a fault occurs in the preliminary drafting zone, it is not necessary for the delivery pressure cylinder to be pivoted as well. Instead, only the pivot frame with the two pressure cylinders of the preliminary drafting zone is pivoted upwards in order for the fault to be rectified.<br>
In accordance with the embodiment described heretofore, the opportunity arises of the delivery pressure cylinder being arranged in a second separate pivot frame, in order to be able to rectify faults in the area of tiie main drafting zone and in particular in the area of the discharge roller pair, and likewise in order to facilitate the feed of the fibre material into the drafting an^ngement<br>
In an advantageous alternative embodiment, the delivery pressure cylinder is mounted in a common pivot frame in addition to the two other pressure cylinders, which results in a solution which is particularly simple in design.<br>
If the delivery pressure cylinder is mounted in a second separate pivot frame, the (or a) pressure bar can to advantage be mounted in the second pivot frame. This embodiment exhibits the advantage that in the event of a fault in the preliminary drafting zone, only the first pivot frame with the pressure cylinders of the preliminary drafting zone needs to be<br><br>
pivoted out, while the pressure bar can remain in contact with the fibre material, so that this undergoes less interference.<br>
To particular advantage, ttie pressure bar can be adjusted In "rts penetration depth into the fibre material. An adjustment of this nature is carried out to advantage as a function of the fibre material which is to be processed, and in particular as a function of its staple length. If, because of a relatively short: staple length, a fibre guide with a relatively large guide surface is necessary, the pressure bar is to advantage pressed forwards deeper into the fibre material.<br>
In particular, better adjustability of the pressure bar is of advantage if it is mounted in at least one retaining element, which in turn, either directly or by means of one or more further intemiediate elements, is secured to the pivot frame. The at least of one retaining element is in this situation arranged to the purpose one of the two face sides of the pressure bar. To advantage, the pressure bar is also mounted in a retaining element of this type on its other face side.<br>
By means of the at least of one retaining element, the adjustment possibilfties for the pressure bar can be extended. On the one hand, the at least of one retaining element can to advantage be arranged so as to be adjustable in the pivot frame, so that, by adjusting the retaining element, the pressure bar can be positioned in the drafting zone concerned horizontally and/or vertically. On the other hand, the pressure bar is arranged for preference so as to be adjustable in the retaining element itself, so that by adjusting the pressure bar in the at least of one retaining element, as an alternative or in addition to the adjustment of the at least of one retaining element in the pivot frame, an exact positioning of the pressure bar in the drafting zone can be carried out. The two adjustment possibilities referred to can be carried out by linear movements and/or pivot movements.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment in this respect, the pressure bar is adjustably mounted in a longitudinal hole in the minimum of one retaining element, in order in this way to achieve the desired position in the drafting zone by linear displacement of the pressure bar.<br><br>
Advantageous further embodiments of the invention are characterised by the features of the sub-claims.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail hereinafter on the basis of the Figures. These show:<br>

pivot frames;<br>

Figure 5A	second embodiment of a drafting arrangement in a diagrammatic side<br>
view; and<br>
Figure 6A	third embodiment of a drafting an-angement in a diagrammatic side<br>
view.<br>
In Figures 1 and 2 a drafting arrangementi of a textile machine is shown in a diagrammatic side view or a plan view respectively, A drafting arrangement of this type can be used in particular with combing machines, draw frames, or carding machines, or combinations of these machines. The drafting an^angement 1 exhibits a preliminary drafting zone W and a main drafting zone HV, whereby the preliminary drafting zone W is fomned from a bottom intake roller 2 and a top intake pressure cylinder 5, as well as a bottom middle roller 3 and a top middle pressure cylinder 6. The main drafting zone HV is formed in turn from the middle roller 3 and the middle pressure cylinder 6, as well as a bottom delivery roller 4 and a top delivery pressure cylinder 7. The pressure cylinders 5,6,<br><br>
7	are capable of being pressed by loading means, not shown, such as pneumatic<br>
cylinders, onto the bottom rollers 2» 3,4 in each case, and are then located in a loading<br>
position (continuous lines). Between the bottom rollers 2, 3,4 and the pressure cylinders<br>
5, 6, 7, fibre material FM is introduced in the form of combed slivers, fibre slivers, or a non-<br>
woven fibre fleece, and is nipped between the individual bottom rollers 2, 3, 4 and the<br>
pressure cylinders 6, 7. In the conveying direction of the fibre material FM (see arrow at<br>
the left-hand edge of the figure), the circumferential speeds of the bottom rollers and<br>
pressure cylinders respectively increases, so that the fibre material FM is drawn in both<br>
the preliminary drafting zone W as well as in the main drafting zone HV.<br>
The intake pressure cylinder 5 and the middle pressure cylinder 6 in frie embodiment shown according to Figures 1 and 2 are arranged In a pivot frame 8, which exhibits two pivot arms 8a (see Figure 2), which are connected to one another by means of a common axle 9. When the pivot ami 8 is pivoted upwards, whereby the loading pressure of the pneumatic cylinders is first removed, the pressure cylinders 5,6, are accordingly pivoted out together from the loading position into a released position (broken lines in Figure 1), so that both the preliminary drafting zone W as well as the main drafting zone HV are easily accessible. The pivot movement of the pivot frame 8 is also indicated by the double arrow f1 in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
The delivery cylinder 7 is mounted in a separate pivot frame 18 wtth two pivot anns 18a, whereby the pivot frame 18 can be pivoted about a pivot axis 19 counter to the pivot frame<br>
8	(see double an^ow f2 in Figures 1 and 2).<br>
In the main drafting zone HV, a pressure bar 20 enters into the fibre material FM from above, in order to guide fibres which are not nipped and are refenred to as floating fibres, and therefore provide them with a controlled movement to the delivery roller pair 4,7. According to the invention, tine pressure bar 20 is mounted in the pivot frame 8 and is therefore pivoted with it, when the frame is pivoted fonwards out of Its loading position into fts released position and back again. With this design the advantage is obtained that the drafting an-angement 1 is easily accessible for cleaning, adjustment, etc. The introduction<br><br>
of fibre material FM can also be carried out easily with the pivot frame 8,18 pivoted out, Nwithouttlie fibre material FM needing to be guided beneath a fixed pressure bar, in accordance with the prior art In addition, with the fibre material FM feed into tiie drafting arrangement 1 the pressure bar 20 can cleaned easily, by the pivot frame 8 being pivoted upwards and the pressure bar 20 then being easily accessible for cleaning.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show a diagrammatic side view and a perspective view respectively of a preferred design for the arrangement of the pressure bar 20 in the pivot frame 8. The pivot arms 8a of the pivot frame 8 are designed In an L-shape, whereby the foot of the "L" impinges into the main drafting zone HV. At the free end of the pivot arms 8a in this respect two shoulder elements 10,12 are fonmed, whereby the shoulder element 10 exhibrts a passage aperture 11 with an internal thread, and the shoulder element 12 has a longitudinal notch insertion 13. From the outside a longftudinal inherently angled retaining element 14 is arranged in this section of the pivot arm 8a, which is secured to the pivot ami 8a by means of two screws 17a, 17b (see Figure 4). The retaining element 14 exhibits for this purpose a longitudinal notch insertion 15, through which the screw 17a is guided and is screwed into the passage aperture 11 of the shoulder element 10. The second screw 17b is in its turn introduced in a longftudinal hole 16 at the other end of the retaining element 14, and is further screwed through the notch 13 of the shoulder element 12 into an intemal thread on the face side of the pressure bar 20, By means of this design, the pressure bar 20 can be adjusted in a double manner in Its penetration depth into the fibre material FM, namely on the one hand by linear displacement of ttie retaining element 14 in its notch 15 (see double an-ow f3 in Figure 3) and/or by displacement of the pressure bar 20 in the longitudinal hole 16 (see double an-ow f4 in Figure 3).<br>
In a variant which is not described in greater detail, the pressure bar witii the retaining element 14 is to be pivoted about the axis fonned by the passage aperture 11, so that the pressure bar 20 can also be positioned in a changeable manner horizontally in the main drafting zone HV.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows an alternative embodiment of a pivot frame 108. Mounted in this pivot frame 108, in addition to the intake pressure cylinder 5 and the middle pressure cylinder 6, is also the delivery pressure cylinder 7, whereby the pressure bar 20 according to the invention is likewise an-anged in the pivot frame 108. As a result of the pivoting of the pivot frame 108 about a pivot axle 109 mounted in front of the drafting arrangement 1, all the bottom rollers 2. 3,4 are therefore exposed, with the result that the drafting an^ngement 1 becomes particularly easy to handle.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further embodiment of a pivot frame 218, in which the delivery pressure cylinder 7 is mounted, and which can be pivoted about a pivot axle 219. The pivot frames 208, 218 in this embodiment can both be pivoted upwards to the intake of the drafting arangement. According to the invention, in addition to the delivery pressure cylinder 7, the pressure bar 20 can also be arranged in the pivot frame 218 (not shown). For preference, however, the pressure bar 20 is arranged in the pivot frame 208. Depending on the fault situation arising, in order to rectify the fault only the pivot frame 218 or the two pivot frames 208 and 218 can be pivoted, so that optimum accessibility can be achieved to rectify the fault, without unnecessarily interfering with the fibre mass in the drafting arrangement.<br>
The invention is not restricted to tiie embodiments represented. Departures from tiiese within the framework of the claims are of course possible. Thus, for example, additionally or altematively, a pressure bar can be provided for in the preliminary drafting zone \A/, which according to the invention is mounted so as to be movable.<br><br><br><br><br>
