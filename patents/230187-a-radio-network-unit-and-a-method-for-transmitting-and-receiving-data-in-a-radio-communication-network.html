				<td>AN ARCHITECTURAL MODEL OF A RADIO BASE STATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an architectural model of a<br>
radio network unit, e.g. a Radio Base Station as applied in<br>
a CDMA-based radio communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Commonly, a Radio Base Station in a radio communication<br>
system is responsible for transmitting and receiving data<br>
to a certain range of user equipment. On the one hand, this<br>
unit takes care of the data handling related to the Radio<br>
Network functionality; on the other hand it is responsible<br>
for the airborne interface towards said user equipments.<br>
Each Radio Base Station covers a certain geographical area<br>
and provides various communication services to the user<br>
equipments within this area. A Radio Base Station is thus<br>
involved into tasks of two different techniques:<br>
Communication handling of the Radio Network functionality<br>
and handling • of airborne interfaces towards user<br>
equipments. Both techniques have different requirements and<br>
develop at different pace, which is progressed, e.g., due<br>
to standardisation activities or due to various customer<br>
requirements for the implementation of radio communication<br>
networks and imply thus a wide range of products. With<br>
regard to the radio related functions still further<br>
requirements become necessary due to the location of the<br>
Radio Base Station, e.g. in an urban or rural area, and the<br>
different demands with respect to radio propagation and<br>
traffic capacity that may result .from this.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Apparently, there is a need to take care of a range of<br>
different requirements with regard to the desired or<br>
requix-ed functionality of the Radio Base Station. This<br>
depends on the one hand on the intended use of the Radio<br>
Base Station and, on the other hand, on requirements of<br>
operators that use such a Radio Base Station and their<br>
definition of communication facilities, e.g., in terms of<br>
capacity and services or in terms of network design and cell<br>
planning. However, a Radio Base Station comprising a high<br>
degree of flexibility will most likely involve the problem<br>
that changes with respect to any aspect of the Radio Base<br>
Station usage will imply an at least potential influence on<br>
the entire functionality of the Radio Base Station.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
define a suitable architectural model of a Radio Base<br>
Station that separates functionality in such a way that it<br>
is possible to adapt the Radio Base Station to various<br>
requirements and conditions while, at the same time, the<br>
additional complexity of such a Radio Base Station can be<br>
kept as minimal as possible.<br>
The present invention bases on the understanding that the<br>
architectural flexibility of the Radio Base Station is<br>
mainly required due to a steady increase of the<br>
functionality that is implemented in modern communication<br>
systems and due to developments and frequent modifications<br>
in the field of radio transmission.<br>
The object of the present invention is achieved by means of<br>
a Radio Base Station comprising an internal RBS-interface<br>
that subdivides the functionality of the Radio Base Station<br>
into a first part, which solely relates to the RAN-part and<br>
thus the functionality of the radio network, and a second<br>
part, which solely relates to the radio part, i.e. the<br><br>
airborne part of the transmission. The internal interface<br>
comprises at least a link that handles the necessary-<br>
additional communication that arises due to the subdivision<br>
and a link that handles the user data that is to be<br>
processed, i.e. transmitted or received, by said Radio Base<br>
Station.<br>
It is a first advantage of the present invention to achieve<br>
a Radio Base Station that provides an increased flexibility<br>
to varying requirements on its functionality.<br>
It is thus also an advantage that the Radio Base Station<br>
according to the present invention can easily be upgraded in<br>
case of evolvements and specific customer requirements.<br>
It is a further advantage that the Radio- Base Station<br>
according to the present invention facilitates a modular<br>
construction.<br>
Other objects, advantages and novel features of the<br>
invention will become apparent from the following detailed<br>
description of the invention when considered in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 shows an architectural model of a Radio Base<br>
Station according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a part of the signal processing of user data<br><br>
that shall be transmitted by help of the Radio Base Station.<br>
DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br><br>
Figure 1 shows an architectural model of a Radio Base<br>
Station 10 according to the present invention. The Radio<br>
Base Station is equipped with a Pub-interface 14 towards a<br>
central controller unit of the network, e.g. a Radio Network<br>
Controller (RNC), and comprises an interface 15 of carriers<br>
containing a plurality of Uu-interfaces, one for each of<br>
user equipment that is served by this Radio Base Station.<br>
The present invention introduces a new interface 13 within<br>
the Radio Base Station 10 that allows a subdivision of the<br>
functionalities of the Radio Base Station into distinct<br>
parts 11,12 which provides- the benefit that any modification<br>
within one of the parts does not imply consequences to the<br>
respective other part. The architectural model according to<br>
the present invention intends thus to achieve a maximum<br>
integration of base station functionality that operates<br>
dependently on each other and to separate functionality that<br>
can operate independently on a certain range of definable<br>
input data. By this means, the Radio Base Station according<br>
to the present invention provides an increased flexibility<br>
for a scalable design, e.g. in terms of a scalable capacity<br>
or related to network upgrades, or with respect to<br>
conditions and requirements that are related to the airborne<br>
radio transmission.<br>
The preferred embodiment of a Radio Base Station 10<br>
according to the present invention, as presented in figure<br>
1, is a Radio Base Station consisting of a first part 11,<br>
which comprises the RAN-functionality and a second part 12<br>
comprising the radio-related functionality. The RAN-part 11<br>
comprises all functionality that is related to the operation<br>
of the Radio Base Station 10 as part of the Radio Access<br>
Network. This includes the handling of user data, e.g. user<br>
data coding and decoding, and the handling of various tasks<br>
for handling of radio links, e.g. radio link setup and<br>
release, radio link supervision, power control. In addition,<br>
this part also includes the overall configuration and fault<br><br>
handling of the Radio Base Station 10 and the handling of<br>
the Tub-interface 14. The radio part 12 includes those<br>
functions that are strictly limited to the airborne data<br>
transmission and thus related to the chosen radio solution,<br>
e.g. regarding up/down converters, power amplification and<br>
related functions* i.e. clipping, limitations, gain control,<br>
and linearization. Figure 1 insinuates that the radio part<br>
is strictly limited to functions that relate to one specific<br>
radio solution. However, within the scope of the present<br>
invention it is notwithstanding possible to design the<br>
architectural model in such a way that the Radio Base<br>
Station is subdivided into one RAN-part and a plurality of<br>
radio parts, whereof each radio part relates to a specific<br>
radio solution.<br>
As already mentioned above, the subdivision of the Radio<br>
Base Station 10 into two parts 11,12 is achieved by means of<br>
introducing an internal RBS-interface 13. This interface 13<br>
is defined in such a way that changes or evolvements of the<br>
RAN-part and/or the radio part do not affect each other. A<br>
stable internal RBS-interface must consist of at least two<br>
different kinds of links: One link, which is in the<br>
following referred to as the O&amp;M-link, is responsible for<br>
the additional traffic that is necessary due to the<br>
subdivision of the Radio Base Station. Another link, the<br>
user data link, is responsible for carrying the user data<br>
that is transmitted from or received by the Radio Base<br>
Station.<br>
The subdivision of the Radio Base Station functionality .<br>
involves a certain amount of additional signaling between<br>
the separated parts, which is the responsibility of the O&amp;M-<br>
link. Regarding a first aspect, both parts must agree on a<br>
number of radio related parameters. The radio part must<br>
inform the RAN-part on its capabilities such that the RAN-<br><br>
part is able to determine the radio-related transmission<br>
properties for the respective user data traffic. This means<br>
in particular that the radio part informs the RAN-part on<br>
its status of operability, i.e. whether there are any<br>
malfunctions in the radio part, and its capabilities at<br>
least with regard to the applied frequency and maximum<br>
permitted downlink power. This must be agreed on for each<br>
carrier, which in turn embraces a plurality of Uu-interfaces<br>
to user equipments, to which the Radio Base Station<br>
momentarily maintains an established connection. The<br>
downlink power that has been assigned to a carrier is then<br>
distributed amongst the plurality of Uu-interfaces. The RAN-<br>
part in its turn must specify at least the parameters<br>
transmission frequency and downlink power for each Uu-<br>
interface on which user data shall be transmitted. It is<br>
another responsibility of the O&amp;M-link to provide means for<br>
the radio part to communicate with the overall configuration<br>
and fault handling of the Radio Base Station which is<br>
located in the RAN-part. Finally, there must also be<br>
measures to achieve a secure transmission via the O&amp;M-link,<br>
which can be done by any suitable link layer fault handling,<br>
e.g. by help of parity bits or other kinds of added<br>
redundancy.<br>
The interface between RAN-part and radio part must also<br>
provide a user data link, which denotes a high speed<br>
interface for carrying the user data that is either<br>
transmitted from or received by the Radio Base Station. The<br>
number of links in uplink and downlink direction for a<br>
physical unit in the radio part is mainly a product depend<br>
parameter but the architectural model of the Radio Base<br>
Station supports an independence between radio part division<br>
into units and interfaces. For instance, a unit comprises an<br>
O&amp;M-link and a synchronization link and, for a single<br>
carrier unit, one user data link for uplink and downlink<br>
direction and, for a two-carrier unit two user data links in<br><br>
downlink direction and four user data link uplink direction.<br>
In the Radio Access Network the user data is represented by<br>
packet data that is transmitted in form of a bitstream and<br>
it is one of the responsibilities of the Radio Base Station<br>
to convert this bitstream into signals that are suitable for<br>
transmission on air. Therefore, the proposed subdivision of<br>
the functionality of the Radio Base Station according to the<br>
present invention makes it also necessary to determine where<br>
the user data is converted. In case of a subdivision into a<br>
RAN-part and a radio part, which are supposed to be<br>
independent of each other, it appears to be appropriate that<br>
the internal BBS-interface carries the user data in form of<br>
a symbol stream, which implies that RAN-part must include<br>
means for user data converting and de-converting as shown in<br>
figure 2. The RAN-part receives the packet data on the Iub-<br>
interface 21 in form of a bitstream and comprises the<br>
necessary means to perform the steps of channel coding 22,<br>
power control 23 and modulating 24. The user data is then<br>
transmitted over the interface 25 in form of said symbol<br>
stream, e.g. as an (I+Q) -component. The same applies mutas<br>
mutandis for user data that has been received by the user<br>
equipment.<br>
The user data link can be supervised by various means, e.g.<br>
by means of an added redundancy as described for the 0&amp;M-<br>
link, by means of addressing, or by means of power<br>
measurements. With regard to addressing, typically each<br>
symbol stream has an, identifier associated with it. This<br>
identifier associates, generally spoken, a certain<br>
geographical area to the symbol stream. The geographical<br>
area refers to, e.g., a cell, a certain cell sector, or even<br>
an antenna beam and specifies a distinct antenna in case<br>
there are several antennas and the applied frequency. This<br>
identifier is not connected to a physical unit in the radio<br>
part; however, it must be known to both the unit that is<br>
responsible for the overall configuration handling and the<br><br>
radio part. The identifier is inserted by the transmitting<br>
party and supervised by the receiving party, which<br>
facilitates fault locating in the routing of the symbol<br>
stream through the Radio Base Station. Another alternative<br>
to supervise the user data link is by means of power<br>
measurements during a given measurement period of the TX<br>
symbol power, which denotes the average symbol power in the<br>
downlink, and the RX symbol power, which denotes the average<br>
symbol power in the uplink. The measurement result is sent<br>
either embedded in the -user data link or the O&amp;M-link.<br>
Corresponding measurements are done on the receiving part of<br>
the interface. Faults on the radio path configuration can be<br>
located by means of an automatic gain calibration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the<br>
internal RBS-interface also comprises an optional<br>
synchronization link. This link is optional depending on the<br>
hardware implementation of the radio parts. In certain<br>
implementations it might be necessary to transfer both a<br>
frequency reference and a time reference, i.e. a frame<br>
structure, to the radio parts. This is especially helpful<br>
when RAN-part and radio part are physically distant from<br>
each other. A preferable implementation is to embed the time<br>
reference within the symbol stream, e.g. indicating the<br>
first symbol in the frame, and to embed the frequency<br>
reference as the interface bit clock. The supervision of the<br>
synchronization link is preferably integrated with an<br>
interface delay calibration, i.e. the time reference sent by<br>
the RAN-part is echoed back by the radio part and the round<br>
trip delay is measured. The knowledge of this delay can be<br>
used to trim the TX Diversity delays and RAKE usage.<br>
Alternatively, the echoing can be done the other way around,<br>
i.e. the radio part measures the delay. This might be<br>
advantageous in systems with many units in the radio part<br>
and only one RAN-part.<br><br>
