				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to tape feeders for chip mounters, and more particularly to a tape feeder for chip mounters which allows a carrier tape loaded with semiconductor chips to be fed by a rectilinear moving unit, thus allowing the carrier tape to be precisely fed, and preventing the chips from being turned over and removed from the carrier tape while a vinyl cover is discharged and thereby minimizing a malfunction when the chips are picked. Therefore operational reliability is maximized, in addition to reducing the number of elements and the volume of the tape feeder.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, an electronic part mounter, that is, a chip<br>
mounter  is  a  device  that  picks  up  electronic  parts<br>
(semiconductor chips) via a vacuum lifting method by a nozzle<br>
of a head which picks and places the electronic parts fed by a<br>
feeder, and then mounts the electronic parts on a board.<br>
There have been disclosed various kinds of feeders, including a tape feeder, a chip feeder, a tray feeder, etc. The present invention relates to the tape feeder which is<br>
2<br><br>
capable of feeding a large number of chips at a high rate.<br>
A carrier tape is applied to the tape feeder. Because the semiconductor chips received in the carrier tape have a very small size, it is difficult to pick up the semiconductor chips one by one. Further, it is difficult to treat the semiconductor chips received in the carrier tape, because the semiconductor chips are likely to contamination by foreign materials, such as dust, and a probability of loss is high.<br>
Thus, the carrier tape 10 which has been commonly used is constructed as shown in FIG. 1. That is, the semiconductor chips (S.C) are received in receiving spaces 30 which are provided on a paper tape 20 at regular pitches, and then are sealed by a vinyl cover 40 to cover the receiving spaces 30 having the semiconductor chips. A plurality of feeding holes 50 are bored in the paper tape 20 to be arranged at regular intervals along a side of the paper tape 20.<br>
The carrier tape 10 moves by a predetermined pitch while the feeding holes 50 of the carrier tape 10 being locked by the tape feeder mounted to the chip mounter. While the carrier tape 10 moves, the vinyl cover 40 is separated from the paper tape 20, so that the receiving spaces 30 are exposed. Thereafter, the semiconductor chips of the exposed receiving spaces 30 are picked up by the nozzle of the chip mounter.<br>
However, the conventional tape feeder is constructed so<br>
2 A<br><br>
that the carrier tape is fed by a predetermined pitch, by rotating a sprocket wheel and a ratchet in a certain direction while the feeding holes of the carrier tape are locked by a gear of the sprocket wheel.<br>
Since the tape feeder is fed along segments of a circle divided at regular intervals, rotating tolerances are cumulated when the carrier tape is fed to some extent by the rotation of the sprocket wheel. In this case, the semiconductor chips are not precisely fed to target positions and thereby the feeding operation must be set again, therefore deteriorating workability and causing the production of bad products due to a malfunction when the semiconductor chips are picked up.<br>
Further, the volume of the feeder is increased due to a complicated construction, so that it is impossible to realize a slim construction, thus having a low workability.<br>
3<br><br>

7<br><br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 through 15, a tape feeder for chip mounters includes a tape feeding unit 200, a gate unit 300, a vinyl cover discharging unit 4 00, and a drive unit 500. The tape feeding unit 200 is provided at a front portion of a body 100 which is mounted to a chip mounter, and feeds a carrier tape 10 by a predetermined pitch. The gate unit 300 functions to mount the carrier tape 10 and supports the carrier tape 10 when the carrier tape 10 is fed. The vinyl cover discharging unit 400 includes first and second discharging gears 410 and 420, so that a vinyl cover 40 peeled from the carrier tape 10 is discharged while passing through the first and second discharging gears 410 and 420. The drive unit 500 drives the tape feeding unit 200 and at least one of first and second discharging gears 410 and 420, simultaneously.<br>
The tape feeding unit 200 includes a cam slider 210 which has a restraint slot 119 and reciprocates horizontally. The restrain slot 119 has a concave cam section 220 and convex cam sections 230. Front and rear locators 240 and 250 move up and down while coming into contact with the concave cam section 220 and the convex cam sections 230 of the restraint slot 119 by the reciprocating motion of the cam slider 210. Pin holders 295a and 295b are provided at upper portions of the front and rear locators 240 and 250, respectively. Front lock pins 242a and 242b and rear lock pins 252a and 252b are fitted into the pin holders 295a and 295b, respectively, to move up<br>
8<br><br>
and down. A front seesaw link 290 includes base pins 292a and 292b to support the lower surfaces of the front lock pins 242a and 242b, and a rear seesaw link 291 includes base pins 293a and 293b to support the lower surfaces of the rear lock pins 252a and 252b. In this case, each of the front and rear seesaw links 2 90 and 291 is rotatably mounted by a shaft pin 296 which is projected from a rear surface of each of the front and rear locators 240 and 250. A fixed rail 260 is mounted to a predetermined portion of the body 100 to guide the vertical movement of the front locator 240. A movable rail 270 guides the vertical movement of the rear locator 250, and is coupled to the cam slider 210 to be moved in a horizontal rail section 262 of the fixed rail 260 by a feeding pitch of the carrier tape 10. A pitch adjusting unit 600 is mounted to a predetermined portion of the body 100 to limit a moving distance of the movable rail 270.<br>
The cam slider 210 includes a guide slot 211 and a feeding slot 212 under the restraint slot 119. In this case, the guide slot 211 and the feeding slot 212 are coupled to a support pin 110 fastened to the body 100 and the movable rail 270, respectively, to guide the reciprocating motion of the cam slider 210. A bracket 213 is projected from a lower surface of a front portion of the cam slider 210. A tension spring 561 is connected at a first end thereof to the body 100 and at a second end thereof to the bracket 213.  A pin insert<br>
9<br><br>
hole 214 is formed in a rear portion of the cam slider 210 to be coupled to an actuating rod 520 of an air cylinder 510 of the drive unit 500 via a coupling pin 215.<br>
At this time, the actuating rod 520 is biased backward by a tensile force of the tension spring 561 while a compressed air does not flow into the air cylinder 510.<br>
The front and rear locators 240 and 250 include roller bearings 241 and 251, respectively. The roller bearings 241 and 251 are mounted to shaft pins projected from the lower portions of the front and rear locators 240 and 250, respectively, to slide along the concave and convex cam sections 220 and 230 of the restraint slot 119 while being restrained by the restraint slot 119. The plurality of front lock pins 242a and 242b are arranged at regular intervals, that is, 6mm, to vertically move in a vertical rail section 251 of the fixed rail 260, and the plurality of rear lock pins 252a and 252b are arranged at regular intervals, that is, 6mm, to vertically move in a vertical rail section 271 of the movable rail 270.<br>
The pin holders 295a and 295b, mounted to the upper portions of the front and rear locators 240 and 250 in a screw-type fastening method, are made of a ceramic material, thus providing high abrasion resistance and lubrication to the front and rear lock pins 242a, 242b, 252a, and 252b, therefore ensuring smooth and precise vertical movement of the front and<br>
10<br><br>
rear lock pins 242a, 242b, 252a, and 252b.<br>
The movable rail 270 is mounted to move to a horizontal rail section along the horizontal rail section 2 62 of the fixed rail 260. A vertical arm 273 is downwardly projected from a predetermined portion of the movable rail 270, and is coupled to the feeding slot 212 of the cam slider 210 by a support roll 274 so that the vertical arm 273 slides along the feeding slot 212.<br>
A plurality rolling balls 280 are provided along each of guide grooves of the front locator 240 movably installed in the vertical rail section 261 of the fixed rail 260, guide grooves of the rear locator 250 movably installed in the vertical rail section 271 of the movable rail 270, and guide grooves of the movable rail 270 movably installed in the horizontal rail section 260, while the rolling balls 280 being enclosed in a ball cage 281 which is made of a resin material, thus minimizing friction due to the vertical movement of the front and rear locators 240 and 250 and the horizontal movement of the movable rail 270. Further, the ball cage 281 reduces friction between the rolling balls 280, thus reducing noise to a minimum.<br>
Further, a locking arm 273a is projected from a predetermined portion of the movable rail 270, and the horizontal movement of the movable rail 270 is limited by the pitch adjusting unit 600 which is mounted to a predetermined<br>
11<br><br>
portion of the body 100.<br>
The pitch adjusting unit 600 includes a stopper 610, a screw holder 640, an adjusting bolt 660, and a locking nut 670. The stopper 610 includes a protrusion to receive a magnet 620 which is seated in the locking arm 273a of the movable rail 270, and is mounted to the body 100 to horizontally move. The screw holder 640 is fastened to the body 100 using a bolt. The adjusting bolt 660 is screwed to a screw hole 650 of the screw holder 640 so that a head of the adjusting bolt 660 is seated in a fitting recess 630 which is provided in a rear portion of the stopper 610. The locking nut 670 locks the adjusting bolt 660.<br>
The pitch adjusting unit 600 is operated as follows. That is, as the adjusting bolt 660 is tightened, the stopper 610 moves forward and backward, thus limiting the moving distance of the movable rail 270. Thereby, an interval between the front and rear locators 240 and 250 is adjusted, so that an interval between the lock pin 242b of the front locator 240 and the lock pin 252a of the rear locator 250 is adjusted.<br>
In this case, a stop notch 273-1 is formed on a bottom of the locking arm 273a, and a slip preventing unit 681 is fastened to a predetermined portion of the body 100 under the stop notch 273-1 by inserting a bolt 683 into a longitudinal hole 687 of the slip preventing unit 681.  A ball plunger 691<br>
12<br><br>
having a spring and a ball is placed in the slip preventing unit 681 to elastically bias the ball to the stop notch 273-1, thus preventing the movable rail 270 from slipping when the movable rail 270 is moved backward.<br>
Further, the stopper 610 is coupled to the locking arm 273a of the movable rail 270 while the magnet 620 of the stopper 610 being received in the protrusion of the stopper 610 so that a distance Da between the magnet 620 and the locking arm 273a of the movable rail 270 is equal to a pitch Pa between feeding holes 50 of the carrier tape 10.<br>
The gate unit 300 includes a gate cover 310, a locking guide 320, and a guide support unit 329. The gate cover 310 is mounted to rotate and move forward and backward by a shaft pin 121 fitted into a guide hole 101 which is formed through an upper end of the body 100. The gate cover 310 is used to mount the paper tape 20 of the carrier tape 10 and to guide the vinyl cover 40. The locking guide 320 having a longitudinal slot 325 is mounted to a predetermined portion of the body 100 by a support pin 130 passing through the slot 325, thus moving along the slot 325, and keeps the gate cover 310 closed. The guide support unit 329 supports the locking guide 320, with a ball plunger 332 having a compression spring and a ball and being placed in the guide support unit 329 so as to lock the locking guide 320 in a vertical direction.<br>
The gate cover 310 is coupled to the movable rail 270 by<br>
13<br><br>
inserting the shaft pin 121 into both the guide hole 101 of the body 100 and a hole of a coupling projection 275 which is upwardly projected from the movable rail 270, so that the gate cover 310 moves forward and backward by the moving distance of the movable rail 270.<br>
The gate cover 310 includes a large locking hole 312 through which the front lock pins 242a and 242b pass, and small locking holes 313 through which the rear lock pins 252a and 252b pass. Further, two mount holes 314 are formed on both sides of the gate cover 310 at diagonally opposite positions. _ A picking hole 316 is formed along a part of the gate cover 310 to be placed near the large locking hole 312. Two support arms 317 are provided on both sides of a rear portion of the gate cover 310 to be upwardly inclined at a predetermined angle, and a guide roller 318 is provided between the support arms 317 to guide the discharge of the vinyl cover 20. Further, a dust cover 319 is assembled to cover the large locking hole 312 and the small locking holes 313.<br>
The gate cover 310 is operated as follows so as to mount the carrier tape 10 at first. That is, the locking guide 320 is moved backward so that the support arms 317 coupled to the guide roller 318 rotate downward. In such a state, the carrier tape 10 is mounted to the tape feeder.<br>
Two mount projections 319a are downwardly projected from<br>
14<br><br>
the dust cover 319 to correspond to the mount holes 314 of the gate cover 310. Thus, the dust cover 319 is detachably mounted to the gate cover 310 using the mount holes 314 and the mount projections 319a. Further, the dust cover 319 includes depressions to receive upper ends of the front lock pins 2 42a and 242b passing through the large locking hole 312 and upper ends of the rear lock pins 252a and 252b passing through the two small locking holes 313.<br>
The dust cover 319 is manufactured using a transparent resin material, such as an acrylic resin, thus allowing the front and rear lock pins 242a, 242b, 252a, and 252b to be confirmed by the naked eyes from an outside.<br>
The vinyl cover discharging unit 400 includes an index link 440, a first discharging gear 410, a tension spring 451, a rotary bracket 460, a second discharging gear 420, and a guide roller 481. The index link 440 is coupled at a center shaft 441 thereof to a pinion hinge 4 35 which is screwed to the body 100. The first discharging gear 410 is coupled to a one-way clutch bearing 430 which is assembled with the center shaft 441 of the index link 440. The tension spring 451 is supported at a first end thereof to a support pin 4 42 of the index link 4 40 and at a second end thereof to a hook piece 443 which is screwed to the body 100. In this case, the support pin 4 42 passes through a slot 551 of a slide link 550 of the drive unit 500 to transmit power.  The rotary bracket 4 60 is<br>
15<br><br>
mounted to the body 100 using a shaft pin 170. In this case, the shaft pin 170 is connected to another tension spring 471 which is connected at a first end thereof to a hook pin 171 mounted to a predetermined portion of the body 100, so that the rotary bracket 460 is upwardly biased. The second discharging gear 420 is coupled to an end of the rotary bracket 460 to engage with the first discharging gear 410. The guide roller 481 is mounted to a predetermined portion of the body 100 to guide the vinyl cover 40 between the first and second discharging gears 410 and 420.<br>
In this case, the index link 440 is rotated so that the support pin 442 elastically connected to the tension spring 451 comes into contact with an inner surface of a rear portion of the slot 551 of the slide link 550 by a tensile force of the tension spring 4 51.<br>
The drive unit 500 includes the double-acting air cylinder 510, a front joint 530, a rear joint 540, and the tension spring 561. The double-acting air cylinder 510 is mounted to a predetermined portion of the body 100. The front joint 530 is coupled to a front end of the actuating rod 520 to be coupled to the pin insert hole 214 of the cam slider 210 by the coupling pin 215. The rear joint 540 is coupled to a rear end of the actuating rod 520 of the air cylinder 510 to be coupled to the slide link 550 which transmits power from the air cylinder 510 to the index link 440.   The tension<br>
16<br><br>
spring 561 is connected at a first end thereof to the bracket 213 and at a second end thereof to a support pin 102 which is mounted to a predetermined portion of the body 110, to bias the actuating rod 520 backward.<br>
In this case, the air cylinder 510 has a slim construction to allow the body 100 to be installed in a space having a width of 10mm or less. Further, the air cylinder 510 comprises the slim double-acting cylinder of which an effective sectional area is not a circle but an ellipse, thus overcoming a drawback of the slim construction and thereby increasing a thrust.<br>
The air cylinder 510 may comprise a single-acting cylinder which executes only a backward motion by a tensile force of the tension spring 561.<br>
Further, the drive unit 500 includes a manual handle 570. The manual handle 570 is connected at an end thereof to a link pin 166 provided at a rear end of the slide link 550, and is rotated about a shaft pin 167 mounted to a predetermined portion of the body 100 so as to move the slide link 550 forward and backward. The manual handle 570 allows a feeding operation to be set when the carrier tape 10 is mounted at first, thus being convenience for a user.<br>
In the present invention, a cover plate 180 is screwed to each side of the front portion of the body 100 to cover the front portion of the body 100,  thus protecting the most<br>
17<br><br>
important element of this invention, that is, the tape feeding unit 200, and preventing foreign materials, such as dust, from accessing the body 100.<br>
FIGS. 16 and 17 show a clamping unit 800 which is provided at surface of the body 100 and used to mount the tape feeder to a feeder base (C.B) of the chip mounter. In this case, a construction of a toggle joint having four links is applied to the clamping unit 800, thus allowing the tape feeder to be easily and conveniently mounted to the feeder base (C.B).<br>
The clamping unit 800 includes a clamp lever 840, a connecting link 850, an interlocking link 860, a support link 870, and a clamping link 880. The clamp lever 840 is mounted to an intermediate portion of the body 100 by a shaft pin 103 to rotate about the shaft pin 103. The connecting link 850 is connected at a first end thereof to the clamp lever 840 by a shaft pin 104 to be horizontally placed along the body 100. The interlocking link 860 is connected at a first end thereof to a second end of the connecting link 850 by a shaft pin 105. The support link 870 is connected at a first end thereof to an intermediate portion of the interlocking link 860 by a shaft pin 106, and connected at a second end thereof to a predetermined portion of the body 100 by a shaft pin 107. The clamping link 880 is connected at an intermediate portion thereof to a second end of the interlocking link 860 by a<br>
18<br><br>
shaft  pin  108,  and  connected  at  an  end  thereof  to  a predetermined portion of the body 100, so that an end of the clamping link 880 clamps a projecting end of the feeder base (C.B).<br>
In this case, since the connecting link 850 has a length extending from a front end to a rear end of the body 100, a link guide piece 890 is screwed to a predetermined portion of the body 100 to surround an outer surface of a part of the connecting link 850, so as to prevent loosening or malfunction of the connecting link 850 when the connecting link 850 moves forward and backward.<br>
Further, a roller bearing 881 is mounted to the end of the clamping link 880 to prevent both the clamping link 880 and the feeder base (C.B) from being damaged when the projecting end of the feeder base (C.B) is clamped, thus ensuring a smooth clamping action.<br>
The clamping unit 800 is operated as follows. As shown in FIG. 17, a worker sets the position of the feeder base C.B by position setting pins 111 and 112 which are fixed to the bottom of the body 100. Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 18, the worker pushes the clamp lever 840 forward. At this time, the clamp lever 840 rotates about the shaft pin 103, so that the connecting link 850 connected to the end of the clamp lever 840 by the shaft pin 104 moves backward.<br>
Further, a side of the interlocking link 860 connected to<br>
19<br><br>
the end of the connecting link 850 moves backward while another side of the interlocking link 860 rotates forward. But, a side of the support link 870 which is connected at the first end thereof to the intermediate portion of the interlocking link 8 60 and connected at the second end thereof to the body 100 rotates forward. At this time, the clamping link 880 upwardly rotates about the shaft pin 109 mounted to the body 100, so that the roller bearing 881 mounted to the end of the clamping link 880 pushes the projecting end of the feeder base (C.B) upward while clamping the projecting end. The clamping unit 800 is released in reverse order.<br>
The reference numeral 181 denotes a tape winding wheel around which the carrier tape 10 is wound, the reference numeral 182 denotes a tape discharging guide to guide the discharge of the paper tape 20 of the carrier tape 10, and the reference numeral 183 denotes a guide groove to draw the carrier tape 10.<br>
The operation of the tape feeder according to the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 18 through 29.<br>
FIG. 18 shows an initial stage where the carrier tape 10 is manually mounted to the tape feeder so as to be fed by a predetermined pitch.<br>
First, the carrier tape 10 is unwound from the tape winding wheel 181 and drawn through the guide groove 183 of<br>
20<br><br>
the body 100. Thereafter, the locking guide 320 of the gate unit 300 is moved backward, and the support arms 317 are pressed so that the front portion of the gate cover 310 is raised while rotating about the shaft pin 121. Thus, the carrier tape 10 passes through a space between the upper portion of the body 100 and the bottom of the gate cover 310. In this way, the carrier tape 10 is manually mounted to the tape feeder.<br>
In such a mounting stage, the actuating rod 520 of the air cylinder 510 coupled to the cam slider 210 of the tape feeding unit 200 is completely biased backward by the tensile force of the tension spring 561 of the drive unit 500. At this time, the front locator 240 is placed in the vertical rail section 261 of the fixed rail 260 while the roller bearing 241 of the front locator 240 being restrained in the convex cam section 230 of the restraint slot 119, and the rear locator 250 is placed in the vertical rail section 271 of the movable rail 270 while the roller bearing 251 of the rear locator 250 being restrained in the concave cam section 220. The lock pin '242a of the front locator 240 passes through the feeding hole 50 of the carrier tape 10 to lock the carrier tape 10.<br>
In the initial mounting stage, as shown in FIG. 19, when the cam slider 210 moves forward by power transmitted from an external power source (the chip mounter) or the air cylinder<br>
21<br><br>
510 of the drive unit 500, the front locator 240 horizontally slides along the restraint slot 119 while the roller bearing 241 being restrained in the convex cam section 230 of the restraint slot 119. At this time, the lock pin 242a is positioned so that the feeding hole 50 is locked by the lock pin 242a. Meanwhile, the rear locator 250 moves upward in the vertical rail section 271 of the movable rail 270 while the roller bearing 251 sliding from the concave cam section 220 to the convex cam section 230 of the restraint slot 119, so that the lock pin 252a of the rear locator 250 passes through the feeding hole 50 to lock the feeding hole 50.<br>
As shown in FIG. 20, when the cam slider 210 further moves forward in such a state, the front locator 240 slides from the convex cam section 230 to the concave cam section 220 while moving downward along the fixed rail 260, so that the lock pin 242a is removed from the feeding hole 50 of the carrier tape 10. Simultaneously, the rear locator 250 remains in the convex cam section 230 while the feeding hole 50 being locked by the lock pin 252a of the rear locator 250.<br>
When the cam slider 210 further moves forward in such a state, as shown in FIG. 21, the tension spring 561 extends to the maximum and the movable rail 270 moves forward by the vertical arm 273 coupled to the feeding slot 212 of the cam slider 210 by the support roll 274. Simultaneously, the rear locator 250 moves along the horizontal rail section 2 62 of the<br>
22<br><br>
fixed rail 2 60 by a half of a pitch Pa between the feeding holes 50 of the carrier tape 10, that is, 2mm.<br>
In this case, the tension spring 561 of the drive unit 500 is extended to the maximum.<br>
In such a state, as shown in FIG. 22, when the external power source, that is, the chip mounter or the air cylinder 510 is controlled to stop the supply of the compressed air, the cam slider 210 moves backward by the restoring force of the tension spring 561. Thus, the front locator 240 moves upward along the fixed rail 260 while passing a junction between the concave cam section 220 and the convex cam section 230. Meanwhile, the rear locator 250 horizontally slides along the convex cam section 230 to reach a junction between the concave cam section 220 and the convex cam section 230.<br>
At this time, the lock pin 242a of the front locator 240 is not aligned with the feeding hole 50, so that an end of the lock pin 242a contacts the paper tape 20, and thereby the upward movement of the front locator 240 is prevented. In this case, the seesaw link 290 is rotated so that the lock pin 242b of the front locator 240 passes through the feeding hole 50 to lock the feeding hole 50. Meanwhile, the lock pin 252a of the rear locator 250 keeps passing through the feeding hole 50, as shown in FIG. 21.<br>
In such a state, when the cam slider 210 further moves backward by the tension spring 561, as shown in FIG. 23, the<br>
23<br><br>
lock pin 242b of the front locator 240 passes through the feeding hole 50 of the carrier tape 10 to lock the feeding hole 50. Simultaneously, the rear locator 250 downward moves along the movable rail 270 while reaching the concave cam section 220. At this time, the lock pin 252a of the rear locator 250 is removed from the feeding hole 50 of the carrier tape 10.<br>
When the cam slider 210 further moves backward in such a state, as shown in FIG. 24, the movable rail 270 moves backward along the horizontal rail section 262 of the fixed rail 260, together with the rear locator 250, by a half of a pitch Pa between the feeding holes 50 of the carrier tape 10, that is, 2mm, while the support roll 274 of the vertical arm 273 being in contact with the feeding slot 212.<br>
In such a state, as shown in FIG. 25, when the air cylinder 510 is controlled to move the cam slider 210 forward again, the front locator 240 slides from the convex cam section 230 to the junction between the convex cam section 230 and the concave cam section 220. Further, the rear locator 250 slides from the concave cam section 220 to the convex cam section 230 while keeping the feeding hole 50 of the carrier tape 10 locked.<br>
At this time, the lock pin 252a of the rear locator 250 contacts the lower surface of the carrier tape 10, so that the seesaw link 291 is rotated so that the lock pin 252b moves<br>
24<br><br>
upward and passes through the feeding hole 50 to lock the feeding hole 50.<br>
When the cam slider 210 further moves forward in such a state, as shown in FIG. 2 6, the front locator 240 moves downward to the concave cam section 220 and the lock pin 2 42b of the front locator 240 is removed from the feeding hole 50. Further, the lock pin 252b of the rear locator 250 keeps passing through the feeding hole 50 of the carrier tape 10 to lock the feeding hole 50, while the support roll 274 of the vertical arm 273 of the movable rail 270 contacts an inner edge of a rear portion of the feeding slot 212.<br>
In such a state, when both the cam slider 210 and the movable rail 270 move forward by 2mm as shown in FIG. 27, and then the cam slider 210 moves backward as shown in FIG. 28, the lock pin 242b of the front locator 240 contact the carrier tape 10. Thereby, the seesaw link 290 is rotated so that the lock pin 242a passes through the feeding hole 50 to lock the feeding hole 50.<br>
In such a state, when the cam slider 210 further moves backward as shown in FIG. 29, the lock pin 242a of the front locator 240 passes through the feeding hole 50 to lock the feeding hole 50, while the rear locator 250 moves to the concave cam section 220 so that the lock pin 252b is removed from the feeding hole 50.<br>
In such a state,  the cam slider 210 further moves<br>
25<br><br>
backward by 2mm to return to the original state shown in FIG. 19. By repeatedly executing the above operations, the carrier tape 10 is fed by the pitch of 2mm while the chips being fed to the chip mounter.<br>
In the tape feeding unit 200 of this invention, the moving distance of the movable rail 270 is controlled by the pitch adjusting unit 600.<br>
In a detailed description, the stopper 610 coupled to the locking arm 273a of the movable rail 270 is controlled by the adjusting bolt 660, so that an interval between the front and rear locators 240 and 250 is adjusted, thus offsetting a small deviation generated during a use of the tape feeder and preventing a feeding error.<br>
Further, the movable rail 27 0 is fixed at a desired position without a shake by a magnetic force of the magnet 620 received in the protrusion of the stopper 610, until the cam slider 210 moves backward and the support roll 274 of the vertical arm 273 comes into contact with the inner surface of the front portion of the feeding slot 212, thus absorbing any impact and vibration acting on an end of the feeding slot 212.<br>
In the present invention, the vinyl cover 40 taped on the carrier tape 10 is peeled off while the paper tape 20 is fed by a predetermined pitch by the tape feeding unit 200. Subsequently, the vinyl cover 40 is drawn upward through the picking hole 316 of the gate cover 310 of the gate unit 300<br>
26<br><br>
while being guided to the guide roller 318. Thereafter, the vinyl cover 4 0 is discharged by the vinyl cover discharging unit 400.<br>
The gate cover 310 of the gate unit 300 is coupled by the shaft pin 121 to the coupling projection 275 which is upwardly projected from the movable rail 270. Thus, the vinyl cover 40 is forcibly drawn and discharged by the vinyl cover discharging unit 400 while the gate cover 310 moving in the same direction as the movable rail 270.<br>
In a detailed description, since the gate cover 310 moves in a discharging direction of the vinyl cover 40 while the vinyl cover 40 being discharged, the carrier tape 10 moves to the picking hole 316 while tightly holding the chips, thus preventing the chips from being turned over or removed from the carrier tape 10, therefore preventing the malfunction of the chip mounter when the chips are picked.<br>
While the carrier tape 10 passing through the gate unit 300, the carrier tape 10 is divided into the paper tape 2 0 and the vinyl cover 40. When the first discharging gear 410 of the vinyl cover discharging unit 400 is intermittently driven by the drive unit 500 to engage with the second discharging gear 420, the vinyl cover 4 0 is discharged by the rotation of the first and second discharging gears 410 and 420.<br>
In a detailed description, when the drive unit 500 executes the forward operation, the slide link 550 coupled to<br>
27<br><br>
the actuating rod 520 of the air cylinder 510 moves forward.<br>
At this time, since the slide link 550 moves forward while pulling the support pin 442 contacting the rear end of the slot 551 of the slide link 550, the index link 440 executes an idle rotation. Meanwhile, when the slide link 550 moves backward by the drive unit 500, the index link 44 0 returns to an original position by a tensile force of the tension spring 451 supported to the predetermined portion of the body 100 by the hook piece 4 43. Therefore, the one-way clutch bearing 4 30 assembled with the center shaft 441 is operated to rotate the first discharging gear 410. As the first discharging gear 410 rotates, the first discharging gear 410 engages with the second discharging gear 420, thus feeding and discharging the vinyl cover 40 by the rotation of the first and second discharging gears 410 and 420.<br>
In the tape feeder of the present invention, the front and rear locators 240 and 250 vertically move in the fixed rail 260 and the movable rail 270, respectively, while the movable rail 270 horizontally moves, by the reciprocating motion of the cam slider 210, so that the feeding holes 50 of the carrier tape 10 are locked while the carrier tape 10 being precisely fed by a predetermined pitch. Therefore, since the tape feeder of the present invention does not rotate, different from a conventional index-type rotation dividing system where a carrier tape is fed along a circle by the<br>
28<br><br>
rotation of a sprocket wheel and a ratchet, any cumulative tolerance is not produced during the movement of the tape feeder of the present invention. Therefore, it is unnecessary to re-adjust the tape feeder of this invention while being in use, thus enhancing operational efficiency of the tape-feeder.<br>
Further, the tape feeder of this invention is constructed so that the front and rear locators 240 and 250 move vertically by the cam slider 210, while being restrained by the restraint slot 119 which is provided on the cam slider 210 and has the concave cam section 220 and the convex cam sections 230 to form a closed loop, thus reducing the number of elements and prolonging the life-span of the tape feeder.<br>
Furthermore, the rolling balls 280 enclosed in the ball cage 281 are provided on each of the guide grooves of the front locator 240, the guide grooves of the rear locator 250, and the guide grooves of the movable rail 270, thus minimizing noise and friction between the moving elements, therefore achieving a high-precision feeding operation.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a tape feeder for chip mounters which is constructed so that a carrier tape loaded with semiconductor chips is fed by a rectilinear feeding unit, thus achieving a high-precision feeding operation, and a locator moving vertically is in contact with a cam slider moving horizontally, thus reducing the number of elements, preventing a malfunction of the tape<br>
29<br><br>
feeder, and prolonging the life-span of the tape feeder. Further, the tape feeder of this invention prevents the chips from being turned over or removed from the carrier tape while a vinyl cover is discharged, thus minimizing a malfunction when the chips are picked and thereby maximizing operational reliability of the tape feeder. Further, since the tape feeder of this invention has a slim construction, it is possible to remarkably increase the number of tape feeders mounted to a chip mounter, thus increasing production efficiency.<br>
Although  the  preferred  embodiments  of  the  present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those<br><br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br>

-37-<br><br>
a tension spring connected at a first end thereof to a bracket of the vinyl cover discharging unit, and connected at a second end thereof to a support pin which is mounted to a predetermined portion of the body to bias the actuating rod of the air cylinder backward.<br>
18.	The tape feeder as claimed in claim 17, wherein the double-acting air cylinder comprises a slim construction having an elliptical sectional area to be housed within a width of the body.<br>
19.	The tape feeder as claimed in claim 16, wherein the drive unit comprises a manual handle, the manual handle being connected at an end thereof to a link pin provided at a rear end of the slide link, and rotating about a shaft pin which is mounted to a predetermined portion of the body, thus moving the slide link forward and backward.<br>
20.	The tape feeder as claimed in claim 1, comprising:<br>
a cover plate screwed to the front portion of the body<br>
so as to cover the front portion of the body, thus protecting the tape feeding unit.<br>
21.	The tape feeder as claimed in claim 1, comprising:<br>
a toggle joint-type clamping unit comprising a linkage<br>
having four links, the clamping unit provided at a predetermined portion of the body to be mounted to a feeder base of the chip mounter.<br>
-38-<br><br>
22.	The tape feeder as claimed in claim 21, wherein<br>
the clamping unit comprises:<br>
a clamp lever mounted at an intermediate portion thereof to the body by a first shaft pin to rotate about the shaft pin;<br>
a connecting link connected at a first end thereof to the clamp lever by a second shaft pin to be horizontally placed along the body;<br>
an interlocking link connected at a first end thereof to a second end of the connecting link by a third shaft pin;<br>
a support link connected at a first end thereof to an intermediate portion of the interlocking link by a fourth shaft pin, and connected at a second end thereof to a predetermined portion of the body by a fifth shaft pin; and<br>
a clamping link connected at an intermediate portion thereof to a second end of the interlocking link by a sixth shaft pin, and connected at a first end of the clamping link to a predetermined portion of the body by a seventh shaft pin, with a roller bearing being mounted to a second end of the clamping link.<br><br>
-39-<br>
23.	A tape feeder for chip mounters, substantially as<br>
herein described, particularly with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Disclosed herein is a tape feeder for chip mounters. The tape feeder is constructed so that front and rear locators are 5 restrained by a restraint slot of a cam slider moving horizontally, and bearings of the front and rear locators alternatively execute vertical and horizontal movements while sliding along the restraint slot by a reciprocating motion of a cam slider, thus repeatedly moving a carrier tape backward<br>
10 while locking the carrier tape and moving the carrier tape forward while releasing the carrier tape, therefore allowing the carrier tape to be fed precisely. The tape feeder allows the carrier tape to be fed precisely, and prevents chips from being turned over and removed from the carrier tape when a<br>
15 vinyl cover is discharged, thus minimizing a malfunction of the chip mounter during an operation of the chips and thereby maximizing operational reliability. Further, the tape feeder allows the number of elements to be reduced, in addition to achieving a slim construction. Thus, the number of tape 20  feeders mounted to the chip mounter can be increased.<br></td>
