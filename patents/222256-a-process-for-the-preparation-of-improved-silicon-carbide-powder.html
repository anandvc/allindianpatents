				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of improved silicon carbide powder.<br>
Silicon carbide powder finds wide usage in the manufacture of products suitable for refractory and engineering applications.<br>
The silicon carbide powder is useful for the preparation of products suitable for refractory and engineering applications.<br>
The present day method consists of firing an intimately mixed green mixture of fine silica (SiO2) with carbon (C) under flowing argon gas atmosphere by following the equation as follows:<br>
Si02 + 3C = SiC + 2CO      	(1)<br>
Earlier, rice husk was selected as the source of fine silica for which the reference may be made to Lee et al. in Am. Ceram. Bull., Vol. 54, No. 2, pp. 195-98, 1975 entitled "Formation of silicon carbide from rice hulls". Reference may also be made to Krishnarao et al. in Ceram. Inter., Vol. 18, No. 4, 1992, pp. 243-49, entitled "Distribution of silica in rice husks and its effects on the formation of silicon carbide" wherein the importance of distribution of silica in the starting material and the roll of catalyst has been studied. A maximum yield of 60% SiC is the theoretical amount that is producible when rice husk is used as starting material.<br>
Further reference may be made to Guterl et al. in J. Eur. Ceram Soc., vol. 19, No. 4, 1999, pp. 427-32, entitled "SiC material produced by carbothermal reduction of a freeze gel silica- carbon artefact" wherein the fineness of both silica and carbon initial particle size have been stated. It was recommended that monodisperse, extremely fine- sized silica powder with mean particle size -25 nm was effective for silicon carbide preparation. In this study, a sol-gel route was used to prepare the extreme fine starting silica powder.<br>
Still another reference may be made to Cervic et al. in Ceram. Inter., Vol. 21, No. 4, 1995, entitled "A comparison of sol-gel derived SiC powders from Saccharose and activated carbon" wherein the importance of an extreme fine sized starting carbon with specific surface area of &gt; 950 m2g"1 was stated. In both above cases, a firing temperature of 1550°C was required.<br>
The requirement of further high firing temperature of 1550° to 1800°C was reported in another study for which reference may be sought to Martin et al. in J. Eur. Ceram Soc., vol. 18, No. 12, 1998, pp. 1737-42, entitled "Synthesis of nanocrystaliine SiC powder by carbothermal reduction".<br>
In a further attempt for which reference may be made to Hanna et al. in Brit. Ceram. Trans. J., Vol. 84, No. 1, 1985, pp. 18-21, entitled "Silicon carbide and nitride from rice hulls-Ill: Formation of silicon nitride" wherein a source of iron was used in the starting composition under a flow of ammonia gas in place of argon/ nitrogen gas and above 1350°C silicon carbide started producing. A maximum of 90% of the starting silica could be reduced upto 1500°C resulting in a mixture of silicon carbide and silicon nitride where an amount &gt;6 wt.% iron was used in the starting mixture.<br>
The drawbacks of the above processes were many-fold. Firstly, an extremely fine grain sized silica was required which had to be prepared in a process by following the sol-gel technique and was evidently a very costly process. Secondly, the use of large excess of carbon in the starting mixture involves an additional firing at above 500°C in air of the post reacted product where the unreacted carbon has to be burnt off. Additionally, the failure of achieving carbidation upto the theoretical value signifies some residual silica in the product where there is no other phase appeared in the reaction product. The residual silica may be harmful in the ultimate use of the material. The use of iron produces silicon carbide along with silicon nitride where an addition of-7 wt.% iron is required in case ammonia is the reacting gas.The major drawbacks of the above noted hitherto known prior art processes are:<br>
1.	The starting silica particle size should be extremely small with surface area of the<br>
powder at least greater than 150 m2/g which is produced following a very expensive<br>
sol-gel process.<br>
2.	The starting carbon particle size should also be extremely fine with surface area of<br>
the powder preferably greater than 150 m2/g.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of improved silicon carbide powder which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art, as given above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of improved silicon carbide powder containing at least 90 wt.% of the phase which obviates the above disadvantages.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of improved silicon carbide powder wherein pure silica, a source of carbon such as activated charcoal, p-silicon carbide, a source of iron such as ferric nitrate and pure nitrogen gas are used as starting materials.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of improved silicon carbide powder from a synergistic composition wherein iron is used as a catalyst and p-silicon carbide as seeding material in the starting materials.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein a lower temperature of firing is required thus making the process cost effective.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of improved silicon carbide powder by carbothermal reduction of silica by inventive steps of introducing P-SiC powder simultaneously with iron in the starting composition resulting into a precursor powder which after complete reduction contains at least 90% SiC preferably rich in the .beta.-phase. The main advantage, among others, is cost effectiveness. Silicon carbide powder finds wide usage in the manufacture of products suitable for refractory and engineering applications. The process for the preparation of improved silicon carbide powder of the present invention, uses as starting material the synergistic composition as described and claimed in our co-pending patent US application Ser. No. 10/974,014.<br>
The synergistic composition of our co-pending patent US application Ser. No. 10/974,014 consists of a mixture of a source of pure silica such as silicon dioxide, a source of carbon such as activated charcoal, B-silicon carbide and a source of iron such as ferric nitrate. The cost effective synergistic composition is useful for the preparation of improved silicon carbide powder containing at least 90% SiC preferably rich in the ß-phase.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of improved silicon carbide powder, said process comprising: (a) homogenizing and powdering a composition consisting essentially of: 41 to 53 weight % Si02, 26 to 35 weight % C, 3.5 to 14 weight % .ß-SiC and 12 to 26 weight % Fe(N03)3.9H20, (b) drying and passing a powder resulting from step (a) through 100 mesh, (c) pressing the powder so obtained from step (b) to form green compacts, (d) sintering the green compacts at a temperature in the range of 1475 to 1550°C in argon atmosphere, and (e) grinding the above said sintered compacts to obtain the desired silicon carbide power having the characteristics of blackish grey in color and crystalline in nature and contains less than 30% ß-phase. In an embodiment of the present invention, the starting materials Si02, C and ß-SiC are pure and powdered.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the Fe(N03)3 was made into a solution of acetone and was mixed with the above mixture.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the homogenising and powdering is effected for a time period ranging between 2 to 8 hours in a ball mill along with alumina balls of size in the range of 5 to 15 mm, the ball to powder ratio is in the range of 6 :1 to 15 :1, and wherein the milling is done in a liquid medium of acetone for which the water content is 0.2%.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, in the milling the ball to powder ratio is preferably around 9:1.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, the pressing is done uniaxially at a pressure ranging from 1 to 50 Kg/cm2.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the SiC contains less than 30% p-phase.<br>
In a still further embodiment of the present invention, the argon gas contains less than 4 ppm. of oxygen and water vapour each.<br>
In general, the carbothermic reduction of silica is sensitively guided by the initial particle size of the reactants. Under extreme reducing condition, a solid- solid reaction is taking place where S\Q2 is reduced by solid Carbon to form a mixture of vapour phase of SiO and CO. In a second set of reaction, SiO vapour reacts to form solid SiC. The formation of SiC is started from a heterogeneous nucleation on C and Si02 surface followed by growth from the gas phase reaction. Both the first phase of reactions as well as the nucleation's are favoured by the decrease in particle size of the starting solid reactants. When a small amount of finely divided a-SiC is used, these act as seeding material. These like phase itself act as the heterogeneously nucleated sites and favours strongly the SiC formation. On the other hand, the carbide formation is presumed to be related to the existence of a Fe-Si liquid phase when iron is used in the starting mixture. The appearance of Fe and Si in the reaction site are due to the reduction of their respective oxides during firing. When the reaction proceeds, the liquid becomes saturated with carbon causing the precipitation of SiC. A continuous growth of the carbide occurs with simultaneous dissolution of silicon and carbon into the liquid to make it saturated. Except for solubility, the growth is assumed to be controlled by the diffusivity of the constituent elements in the liquid after their dissolution. A larger amount of iron favours therefore the formation of a larger amount of liquid which can make the S\O2 and C particles wet enough to serve as centres where the nucleation can take place. In the present case, it may be believed that the added p- SiC particles in the starting mixture itself serve as the "like"- nucleation sites where from growth can occur. Therefore, the reaction does not require large amount of iron and produces similar yield at lower temperature of around 1500°C which otherwise results from a reaction temperature of &gt;1540°C.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is that the product obtained contain atleast 90% of SiC from a reaction which commences at lower temperature than the existing processes by using a lower amount of the catalyst. The novelty of the reaction is that it does not require large amount of iron and produces similar yield at lower temperature of around 1500°C which otherwise results from a reaction temperature of &gt;1540°C.<br>
The inventive step lies in the selection of a range of new synergistic compositions different from other processes that give the desired product after specified processing. Further inventive step lies in introducing p- SiC powder as nucleating seeding agent simultaneously with iron.<br>
Thus the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of silicon carbide powder which involves carbothermal reduction of silica powder by inventive steps of introducing p-SiC powder simultaneously with some iron in the starting composition resulting into a precursor powder which after complete reduction contain at least 90% SiC preferably rich in the p- phase with advantages such as cost effectiveness. The process of the present invention for the preparation of silicon carbide powder is described below in detail:<br>
1. Pure and powdered SiOa, C and p-SiC and were taken as starting materials.<br>
2.The accurately weighed Fe(N03)s was made into a solution of acetone and was mixed with the above mixture.<br>
3.	Accurately weighed appropriate proportions of starting materials of compositions of<br>
the present investigation were taken in an alumina pot of a ball mill along with alumina<br>
balls (size around 5 to 15 mm) for ball milling wherein the ball: powder ratio were kept<br>
in the range of 6:1 to 15:1, preferably around 9:1 and wherein the milling was done in<br>
a liquid medium of acetone for which the water content was 0.2%. The milling time<br>
was ranging between 2 tO 8 hours.<br>
4.	After milling the powder was separated from the balls, sieved and was dried.<br>
5.	The milled powder was taken in a steel mould and was uniaxially pressed with<br>
pressure ranging from 1 to 50 Kg/cm2.<br>
6.	The pressed green billets were taken in a graphite resistance heating furnace and<br>
were fired in argon gas atmosphere at a temperature in the range of 1475° to 1550°C.<br>
