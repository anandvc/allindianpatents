				<td>ß-L-2'-D	eoxy-Nucleosides for the Treatment of Hepatitis B Background of the Invention<br>
This invention is in the area of methods for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (also referred to as "HBV") that includes administering to a host in need thereof, either alone or in combination, an effective amount of one or more of the active compounds disclosed herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or salt of one of these compounds.<br>
HBV is second only to tobacco as a cause of human cancer. The mechanism by which HBV induces cancer is unknown, although it is postulated that it may directly trigger tumor development, or indirectly trigger tumor development through chronic inflammation, cirrhosis, and cell regeneration associated with the infection.<br>
Hepatitis B virus has reached epidemic levels worldwide. After a two to six month incubation period in which the host is unaware of the infection, HBV infection can lead to acute hepatitis and liver damage, that causes abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated blood   -levels of certain enzymes. HBV can cause fulminant hepatitis, a rapidly progressive, often fatal form of the disease hi which massive sections of the liver are destroyed.<br>
Patients typically recover from acute hepatitis. In some patients, however, high levels of viral antigen persist in the blood for an extended, or indefinite, period, causing a chronic infection. Chronic infections can lead to chronic persistent hepatitis. Patients infected with chronic persistent HBV are most common hi developing countries. By mid-1991, there were approximately 225 million chronic carriers of HBV in Asia alone, and worldwide, almost 300 million carriers. Chronic persistent hepatitis can cause fatigue, cirrhosis of the liver, and hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer.<br>
In western industrialized countries, high risk groups for HBV infection include those hi contact with HBV carriers or their blood samples. The epidemiology of HBV is very similar to that of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which accounts for why HBV infection is common among patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. However, HBV is more contagious than HIV.<br>
However, more recently, vaccines have also been produced through genetic engineering and are currently used widely. Unfortunately, vaccines cannot help those already infected with HBV. Daily treatments with a-interferon, a genetically engineered protein, has<br>
also shown promise, but this therapy is only successful in about one third of treated patients. Further, interferon cannot be given orally.<br>
A number of synthetic nucleosides have been identified which exhibit activity against HBV. The (-)-enantiomer of BCH-189, known as 3TC, claimed in U. S. Patent 5,539,116 to Liotta, et al., has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hepatitis B. See also EPA 0 494 119 Al filed by BioChem Pharma, Inc.<br>
Cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-l -yl)-l ,3-oxathiolane ("FTC") exhibits activity against HBV. See WO 92/15308; Furman, et al., "The Anti-Hepatitis B Virus Activities, Cytotoxicities, and Anabolic Profiles of the (-) and (+) Enantiomers of cis-5-Fluoro-l-[2-(Hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolane-5-yl]-Cytosine" Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, December 1992, page 2686-2692; and Cheng, et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, Volume 267(20), 13938-13942 (1992).<br>
von Janta-Lipinski et al. disclose the use of the L-enantiomers of 3'-fluoro-modified p-2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates for the inhibition of hepatitis B polymerases (J. Med. Chem., 1998,41,2040-2046). Specifically, the 5'-triphosphates of 3'-deoxy-3'-fluoro-. ß-L-thymidine (ß-L-FTTP), 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-fluoro-(ß-L-cytidine (ß-L-FdCTP), and 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-fluoro-ß-L-5-methylcytidine (ß-L-FMethCTP) were disclosed as effective inhibitors of HBV DNA polymerases.<br>
WO 96/13512 to Genencor International, Inc. and Lipitek, Inc. discloses that certain L-ribofuranosyl nucleosides can be useful for the treatment of cancer and viruses. Specifically disclosed is the use of this class of compounds for the treatment of cancer and HIV.<br>

The synthetic nucleosidesß-L-2'-deoxycytidine (ß-L-2'-dC),ß-L-2'-deoxythymidine (ß-L-dT) andß-L-2'-deoxyadenosine (ß-L-2'-dA), are known in the art. Antonin Holy first disclosed ▬5-L-dC and ▬5-L-dT in 1972, "Nucleic Acid Components and Their Analogs. CLIII. Preparation of 2'-deoxy-L-Ribonucleosides of the Pyrimidine Series," Collect. Czech. Chem.<br>

Certain 2'-deoxy-p-L-erythro-pentofuranonucleosides are known to have antineoplastic and selected antiviral activities. Verri et al. disclose the use of 2'-deoxy-p-L-erythro-pentofuranonucleosides as antineoplastic agents and as anti-herpetic agents (Mol. Pharmacol. (1997), 51(1), 132-138 and Biochem. J. (1997), 328(1), 317-20). Saneyoshi et al. demonstrate the use of 2'-deoxy-L-ribonucleosides as reverse transcriptase (I) inhibitors for the control of retroviruses and for the treatment of AIDS, Jpn.

Chemotherapeutic uses of 2'-deoxy-ß-L-erythro-pentofuranonucleosides were studied by Tyrsted et al. (Biochim. Biophys. Ada (1968), 155(2), 619-22) and Bloch, et al. (J. Med. Chem. (1967), 10(5), 908-12).<br>
p-L-2'-deoxythymidine (ß-L-dT) is known in the art to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase (TK). Idtti et al., WO 92/08727, teaches that p-L-dT selectively inhibits the phosphorylation of D-thymidine by HSV-1 TK, but not by human TK. Spaldari et al. reported that L-thymidine is phosphorylated by herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase and inhibits viral growth, J. Med. Chem. (1992), 35(22), 4214-20.<br>
In light of the fact that hepatitis B virus has reached epidemic levels worldwide, and has severe and often tragic effects on the infected patient, there remains a strong need to provide new effective pharmaceutical agents to treat humans infected with the virus that have low toxicity to the host<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide new methods and compositions for the treatment of human patients or other hosts infected with hepatitis B virus.<br>

The 2'-deoxy-ß-L-erythro-pentofuranonucleoside can be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable ester by reaction with an appropriate esterifying agent, for example, an acid halide or anhydride. The nucleoside or its pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug can be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in a conventional manner, for example, by treatment with an appropriate base or acid. The ester or salt can be converted into the parent nucleoside, for example, by hydrolysis.<br>
As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts or complexes refers to salts or complexes of the 2'-deoxy-ß-L-erythro-pentofuranonucleosides that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and exhibit minimal, if any, undesired toxicological effects. Nonlimiting examples of such salts are (a) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids (for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and the like), and salts formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, palmoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acids, naphthalenedisulfonic acids, and polygalacturonic acid; (b) base addition salts formed with cations such as sodium, potassium, zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, sodium, potassium, and the like, or with an organic cation formed from N,N-dibenzylethylene-diamine, ammonium, or ethylenediamine; or (c) combinations of (a) and (b); e.g., a zinc tannate salt or the like.<br>
The term prodrug, as used herein, refers to a compound that is converted into the nucleoside on administration in vivo. Nonlimiting examples are pharmaceutically acceptable salts (alternatively referred to as "physiologically acceptable salts"), the 5' and N4 or N6 acylated or alkylated derivatives of the active compound, and the 5'-phospholipid and 5'-ether lipid derivatives of the active compound.<br>
Modifications of the active compounds, specifically at the N4, N6 and 5'-0 positions, can affect the bioavailability and rate of metabolism of the active species, thus providing control over the delivery of the active species.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a method for the treatment of HBV infections in humans or other host animals, that includes administering an effective amount of one or more of a 2'-deoxy-13-L-erythro-pentofuranonucleoside derivative selected<br>

The compounds of this invention either possess anti-HBV activity, or are metabolized to a compound or compounds that exhibit anti-HBV activity. In a preferred embodiment, the 2'-deoxy-ß-L-erythro-pentofuranonucleoside is administered substantially in the form of a single isomer, i.e., at least approximately 95% in the designated stereoconfiguration.<br>
Nucleotide Prodrugs<br>
Any of the nucleosides described herein can be administered as a stabilized nucleotide prodrug to increase the activity, bioavailability, stability or otherwise alter the properties of the nucleoside. A number of nucleotide prodrug ligands are known. In general, alkylation, acylation or other lipophilic modification of the mono, di or triphosphate of the nucleoside will increase the stability of the nucleotide. Examples of substituent groups that can replace one or more hydrogens on the phosphate moiety are alkyl, aryl, steroids, carbohydrates, including sugars, 1,2-diacylglycerol and alcohols. Many are described in R. Jones and N. Bischofberger, Antiviral Research, 27 (1995) 1-17.  Any of these can be used in combination with the disclosed nucleosides to achieve a desired effect.<br>

Combination or Alternation Therapy<br>
It has been recognized that drug-resistant variants of HBV can emerge after prolonged, treatment with an antiviral agent. Drug resistance most typically occurs by mutation of a gene that encodes for an enzyme used in the viral life cycle, and most typically in the case of HBV, DNA polymerase. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the efficacy of a drug against HBV infection can be prolonged, augmented, or restored by administering the compound in combination or alternation with a second, and perhaps third, antiviral compound that induces a different mutation from that caused by the principle drug. Alternatively, the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, or other parameter of the drug can be altered by such combination or alternation therapy. In general, combination therapy is typically preferred over alternation therapy because it induces multiple simultaneous stresses on the virus.<br>
The anti-hepatitis B viral activity of ß-L-2'-dA, ß-L-2'-dC, ß-L-2'-dU,ß-L-2'-dG, P-L-2'-dT,ß-L-dl, or otherß-L-2'-nucleosides provided herein, or the prodrugs, phosphates, or salts of these compounds, can be enhanced by administering two or more of these nucleosides in combination or alternation. Alternatively, for example, one or more of ß-L-2'-dA,ß-L-2'-dC,ß-L-2'-dU,ß-L-2'-dG,ß-L-2'-dT, p-L-dl, or otherß-L-2'-nucleosides provided herein can be administered in combination or alternation with 3TC, FTC, L-FMAU, DAPD, famciclovir, penciclovir, BMS-200475, bis pom PMEA (adefovir, dipivoxil); lobucavir, ganciclovir, or ribavarin.<br>
In any of the embodiments described herein, if theß-L-2'-nucleoside of the present invention is administered in combination or alternation with a second nucleoside or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is phosphorylated to an active form, it is preferred that a second compound be phosphorylated by an enzyme that is different from that which phosphorylates the selected ß-L-2' -nucleoside of the present invention in vivo. Examples of kinase enzymes are thymidine kinase, cytosine kinase, guanosine kinase, adenosine kinase, deoxycytidine kinase, S'-nucleotidase, and deoxyguanosine kinase.<br>
Preparation of the Active Compounds<br>
The 2'-deoxy-ß-L-erythro-pentofurarionucleoside derivatives of the present invention are known in the art and can be prepared according to the method disclosed by Holy, Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. (1972), 37(12), 4072-87 and Mol Phys. (1967), 3(4), 386-95.<br>

A solution of L-ribose 140 (150 g, 1 mol) in methanol (2 liters) was treated with sulphuric acid (12 ml) and left at +4°C for 12hrs, and then neutralised with pyridine (180 ml). Evaporation gave an o,p mixture of methyl ribofuranosides 141 as a syrup. A solution of this anomeric mixture in pyridine (1.3 liters) was treated with benzoyl chloride (580 ml, 5 mol) with cooling and mechanical stirring. The solution was left at room temperature for 12 hrs and then poured on ice (about 10 liters) with continued stirring. The mixture (an oil in water) was filtered on a Cellite bed. The resulting oil on the cellite bed was washed with water (3x3 liters) and then dissolved with ethyl acetate (3 liters). The organic phase was washed with a 5% NaHCO3 solution (2 liters) and water (2 liters), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to give l-O-methyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-α/ß-L-ribofuranose 142 as a thick syrup. The oil was dissolved in acetic anhydride (560 ml) and acetic acid (240 ml). The solution was, after the dropwise addition of concentrated sulphuric acid (80 ml), kept in the cold (+4°C) under mechanical stirring for 10 hrs. The solution was then poured on ice (about 10 liters) under continued stirring. The mixture (oily compound in water) was filtered on a Cellite bed. The resulting gummy solid on the cellite bed was washed with water (3x3 liters) and then dissolved in dichloromethane (2,5 liters). The organic phase was washed with 5% NaHCOa (1 liter) and water (2x2 liters), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to<br>

Anti-HBV Activity of the Active Compounds<br>
The ability of the active compounds to inhibit the growth of virus in 2.2.15 cell cultures (HepG2 cells transformed with hepatitis virion) can be evaluated as described in detail below.<br>
A summary and description of the assay for antiviral effects in this culture system and the analysis of HBV DNA has been described (Korba and Milman, 1991, Antiviral Res., 15:217). The antiviral evaluations are performed on two separate passages of cells. All wells, in all plates, are seeded at the same density and at the same time.<br>
Due to the inherent variations in the levels of both intracellular and extracellular HBV DNA, only depressions greater than 3.5-fold (for HBV virion DNA) or 3.0-fold (for HBV DNA replication intermediates) from the average levels for these HBV DNA forms in untreated cells are considered to be statistically significant (PO.05). The levels of integrated HBV DNA in each cellular DNA preparation (which remain constant on a per cell basis in these experiments) are used to calculate the levels of intracellular HBV DNA forms, thereby ensuring that equal amounts of cellular DNA are compared between separate samples.<br>
Typical values for extracellular HBV virion DNA in untreated cells range from 50 to 150 pg/ml culture medium (average of approximately 76 pg/ml). Intracellular HBV DNA replication intermediates in untreated cells range from 50 to 100 µg/pg cell DNA (average approximately 74 pg/ug cell DNA). In general, depressions hi the levels of intracellular HBV DNA due to treatment with antiviral compounds are less pronounced, and occur more slowly, than depressions in the levels of HBV virion DNA (Korba and Milman, 1991, Antiviral Res., 15:217).<br>
The manner in which the hybridization analyses are performed for these experiments result in an equivalence of approximately 1.0 pg of intracellular HBV DNA to 2-3 genomic copies per cell and 1.0 pg/ml of extracellular HBV DNA to 3 x 105 viral particles/ml.<br>

The efficacy of L-dA, L-dT and L-dC against hepadnavirus infection in woodchucks (Marmota monax) chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHY) was determined. This animal model of HBV infection is widely accepted and has proven to be useful for the evaluation of antiviral agents directed against HBV. Protocol:<br>
Experimental groups (n=3 animals/drug group, n=4 animals/control)<br>
Group 1	vehicle control<br>
Group 2	lamivudine (3TC) (10 mg/kg/day)<br>
Groups 3-6	L-dA (0.01,0.1,1.0,10 mg/kg/day)<br>
Groups 7-10	L-dT (0.01,0.1,1.0,10 mg/kg/day)<br>
Groups 11-14	L-dC (0.01,0.1,1.0, 10 mg/kg/day)<br>
Drugs were administered by oral gavage once daily, and blood samples taken on days 0,1,3, 7,14,21,28, and on post-treatment days +1, +3, +7, +14, +28 and +56. Assessment<br>
of the activity and toxicity was based on the reduction of WHY DNA in serum: dot-blot, qualitative PCR.<br>
The results are illustrated in Figure 3 and Table 5.<br>

NLdA, LdT, LdC administered orally once a day at lOmg/kg 2 limit of detection is 1 ng/ml WHV-DNA per ml serum<br>
The data show that L-dA, L-dT and L-dC are highly active in this in vivo model. First, viral load is reduced to undetectable (L-dT) or nearly undetectable (L-dA, L-dC) levels. Second, L-dA, L-dT and L-dC are shown to be more active than 3TC (lamivudine) in this -model. Third, viral rebound is not detected for at least two weeks after withdrawal of L-dT. Fourth, dose response curves suggest that a modes increase in the dose of L-dA and L-dC would show antiviral activity similar to L-dT. Fifth, all animals receiving the drugs gained weight and no drug-related toxicity was detected.<br>
Toxicity of Compounds<br>
Toxicity analyses were performed to assess whether any observed antiviral effects are due to a general effect on cell viability. The method used is the measurement of the effect of ß-L-dA, ß-L-dC and (ß-L-dT on cell growth in human bone marrow clorogenic assays, as compared to Lamuvidine. The results are provided in Table 6.Table 6<br>
