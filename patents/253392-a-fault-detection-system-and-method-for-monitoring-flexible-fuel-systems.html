FLEXIBLE FUEL PREDICTION AND DRIVER MESSAGE DISPLAY<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
flexible fuel systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Ethanol, also know as ethyl alcohol, is a flammable, colorless<br>
chemical compound that can be mixed with gasoline to fuel an internal<br>
combustion engine. Flexible fuel vehicles include adaptations that allow the<br>
vehicle to run on various blends of gasoline and ethanol. For example, E85<br>
fuel contains a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. A virtual flex fuel<br>
sensor along with a fuel estimation method determines a concentration of<br>
ethanol in the fuel. Based on the concentration level, the air/fuel ratio is<br>
adjusted and the engine operation is controlled accordingly.<br>
[0004] If a fault were to occur on any one of the inputs to the fuel<br>
estimation system, the estimation method typically is disabled. Therefore, the<br>
estimate of the concentration level is not updated. If a refuel event were to<br>
occur after disabling the estimation method, the actual ethanol concentration<br>
level could diverge from the estimated concentration level. For example, if the<br>
vehicle contained E85 fuel prior to the fault and the driver added gasoline<br>
after the fault, the estimate will be very different from the actual concentration<br>
level. An incorrect estimation can impact vehicle startability and vehicle<br>
drivability.<br><br>
GP-308584-PTE-CD<br>

SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Accordingly, a fault system for flexible fuel systems is<br>
provided. The system includes: a fault monitor module that monitors fuel<br>
estimation inputs and detects fuel estimation faults; and a fuel estimation<br>
module that selectively estimates a concentration level based on whether a<br>
fuel estimation fault is detected.<br>
[0006] In other features, a flexible fuel fault warning system for a<br>
vehicle is provided. The system includes: a warning lamp that illuminates<br>
based on a flexible fuel fault indicator signal. The warning lamp includes a<br>
flexible fuel fault warning message.<br>
[0007] Still in other features, a monitoring method for a flexible fuel<br>
system is provided. The method includes: monitoring the flexible fuel system<br>
for faults; generating a fault indicator signal when a fault is detected; and<br>
selectively estimating a concentration level of the fuel system based on<br>
whether a fault is detected.<br>
[0008] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should<br>
be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference<br>
numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein,<br>
the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described<br>
functionality.<br>
[0014] Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle 10 includes an engine<br>
12, an exhaust system 14, and a control module 16. The engine 12 includes<br>
an intake manifold 17, a throttle position sensor (TPS) 18, and a mass air flow<br>
(MAF) sensor 20. The throttle position sensor 18 and the MAF sensor 20<br>
communicate with the control module 16. The exhaust system 14 includes a<br>
catalytic converter 22, a pre-catalyst or inlet oxygen sensor 24, and a post-<br>
catalyst or outlet oxygen sensor 26. The inlet and outlet oxygen sensors 24,<br>
26 communicate with the control module 16 to provide inlet and outlet F/A<br>
ratio signals, respectfully. The control module 16 communicates with a fuel<br>
system 28 to regulate fuel flow to the engine 12.<br>
[0015] The control module 16 includes a fuel estimation system that<br>
estimates a composition of fuel in the fuel system 28. In various<br>
embodiments, the fuel system 28 may include a flex fuel sensor 29. The flex<br>
fuel sensor 29 generates a fuel signal to the control module 16. The fuel<br>
estimation system interprets a composition of the fuel based on the fuel<br>
signal. In various other embodiments, the fuel estimation system estimates a<br>
composition of the fuel in the fuel system based on engine operating<br>
parameters. For example, the fuel estimation system may estimate a<br>
concentration of ethanol in the fuel system based on fuel trim values. This<br>
method is described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. , and<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
GP-308584-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
[0016] Based on the fuel composition, the control module 16<br>
regulates the F/A ratio of the engine 12. In addition, the control module 16<br>
monitors the engine 12 and fuel system 28 for faults. Faulty sensor readings<br>
may occur that affect the estimate of the composition. When related faults are<br>
detected, the control module 16 controls the engine 12 and fuel system 28<br>
and communicates with a warning system based on the flexible fuel fault<br>
method of the present disclosure. The warning system may include at least<br>
one of a warning lamp 30, an audio system 32, and a telematics system 34<br>
(i.e., Onstar ®). The warning system notifies one or more persons of the fault.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figure 2, a dataflow diagram illustrates<br>
various embodiments of a flexible fuel fault system that may be embedded<br>
within the control module 16. Various embodiments of flexible fuel fault<br>
systems according to the present disclosure may include any number of sub-<br>
modules embedded within the control module 16. The sub-modules shown<br>
may be combined and/or further partitioned to similarly provide control when a<br>
fault occurs. Inputs to the system may be received from sensors within the<br>
vehicle 10, received from other control modules (not shown) within the vehicle<br>
10, and/or determined by other sub-modules (not shown) within the control<br>
module 16. In various embodiments, the control module 16 of Figure 2<br>
includes a fault monitor module 40, a fuel estimation module 42, and a<br>
message module 44.<br>
[0018] The fault monitor module 40 receives as input fault data 48<br>
corresponding to faults relating to fuel estimation (e.g. flex fuel sensor faults,<br>
vehicle speed faults, MAF faults, purge solenoid faults, fuel trim faults, and<br>
oxygen sensor faults). If the fault data 48 indicates that one or more of the<br>
inputs to the fuel estimation system are faulty, a fault flag 50 is set<br>
accordingly. The message module 44 receives the fault flag 50 and issues a<br>
fault indicator signal 52 accordingly. In various embodiments, the fault<br>
indicator signal 52 illuminates the warning lamp 30 of Figure 1. Wherein the<br>
warning lamp 30 may illuminate a message including, but not limited to,<br>
"Service Engine Soon" or "Use Unleaded Gasoline Only." In various<br><br>
GP-308584-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
embodiments, the fault indicator signal 52 initiates an audible warning signal<br>
to the audio system 32 located within the vehicle 10 of Figure 1. In various<br>
embodiments, the fault indicator signal 52 contains a diagnostic code.<br>
Wherein the diagnostic code can be transmitted via the telematics system 34<br>
of Figure 1 to a remote location or retrieved via a service tool (not shown) in<br>
communication with the vehicle 10.<br>
[0019] The fuel estimation module 42 receives as input the fault flag<br>
50, fuel event data 56, and fuel estimation data 58 and/or the flex fuel sensor<br>
signal 60. The fuel estimation module 42 generates an estimate 62 of a<br>
concentration level of ethanol in the fuel system 28 of Figure 1 after each<br>
refuel event according to one of at least two estimation methods. If the fault<br>
flag 50 indicates no faults were detected, the estimate 62 level is determined<br>
according to conventional estimation methods such as according to fuel trim<br>
values as described above.<br>
[0020] If the fault flag 50 indicates a fault was detected, the fuel<br>
estimation module 42 computes estimate 62 based on a weighted volume<br>
average method. The weighted volume average method computes the<br>
estimate 62 of the ethanol concentration level based on a current and a<br>
previous fuel volume, a previous ethanol percent, and assuming that gasoline<br>
was added during the refuel event. After a number of refuel events, by using<br>
the weighted volume average method, the estimated concentration level will<br>
converge with the actual concentration level and hence improve startability<br>
and drivability.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 3, a flowchart illustrates a flexible<br>
fuel fault method as performed by the control module 16. The method may<br>
be run periodically during engine operation. Control monitors fault conditions<br>
at 100. If fault data indicates that one or more inputs to the fuel estimation<br>
system are faulty at 102, a fault indicator signal is initiated at 102. Otherwise<br>
control proceeds to monitor for a refuel event at 104. If a refuel event occurs<br>
at 104 and a fault is detected at 106, a concentration level is estimated based<br>
on the weighted volume average method as discussed above at 108.<br><br>
GP-308584-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
Otherwise, if a refuel event occurs at 104 and no faults have been detected at<br>
106, a concentration level is estimated based on a conventional method such<br>
as according to a flex fuel sensor signal at 110 as discussed above.<br>
Otherwise, if a refuel event has not been detected, control loops back and<br>
continues to monitor for a refuel event at 104.<br>
[0022] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can<br>
be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has<br>
been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope<br>
of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will<br>
become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings,<br>
specification, and the following claims.<br><br>
