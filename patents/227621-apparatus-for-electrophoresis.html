				<td>APPARATUS FOR ELECTROPHORESIS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for electrophoresis , in particular to<br>
such devices or apparatus adapted for the safe handling and disposal of agarose-type<br>
gels containing dyeing compounds used therewith.<br>
Background<br>
Gel electrophoresis, a commonly used method on, molecular biology research, is<br>
a technique designed to separate, identify and purify DNA, RNA and protein<br>
molecules based on their weight, size and shape. This technique, which is<br>
simple and rapid to perform, is carried out by first preparing a gel. When the<br>
gel is ready it is placed in a gel box, immersed in a buffer solution, and<br>
connected to a power source. Once stimulated by the electric field that is set up<br>
in the gel, the molecules move through the gel matrix at different rates. The<br>
migration rate for each species of molecule is dependent upon the electrical<br>
charge, the size and shape of the molecules, as well as on the composition of<br>
the gel. Most commonly, the smaller molecules will move through the matrix<br>
at a quicker pace than those of a larger size. Sufficient quantity of buffer<br>
(typically TAE, TBE or protein running buffer) is generally used to ensure that<br>
the electric field is set up in the gel, and that the gel is covered with it and<br>
thus prevent the gel from drying out during electrophoresis. When loading a<br>
sample containing the molecule species of interest into the gel, a loading dye is<br>
typically used. The loading dye normally allows easy visualization of the<br>
solution during the loading process, as well as enabling the density of the<br>
sample to be increased to ensure that the sample is fully and evenly<br>
accommodated in a corresponding well in the gel, and further allows<br>
visualisation of the migration during electrophoresis.<br><br>
The most commonly used gels are prepared with either agarose or acrylarnide,<br>
either one of which can be provided in varying shapes, sizes and thicknesses.<br>
The deciding factor as to which particular gel and its physical attributes is<br>
generally related to the size of molecule being separated and the desired<br>
experiment to be performed by the user.<br>
Acrylarnide is usually chosen for relatively small molecules such as proteins,<br>
while agarose is used for larger molecules such as DNA or RNA. and agarose is<br>
the preferred choice for horizontal gel electrophoresis, typically cast in open<br>
trays by users.<br>
Typically, it is desirable to visualize and to document the results of the<br>
electrophoresis separation test. In electrophoresis separation of DNA or RNA<br>
molecules, this may be accomplished by immersing the gel slab after the<br>
electrophoretic separation has been completed in a solution of a fluorescent<br>
compound which emits visible light when exposed to a ultraviolet (UV) light.<br>
Other methods of staining the gel are also known, for example by adding a<br>
suitable dye to the gel while casting the same. A widely used fluorescent<br>
compound is ethidmm bromide. However, many types of such fiuorescervt<br>
compounds, including ethidium bromide, Acrydine Orange, SYBR Green I, and<br>
SYBR Green II, as well as acrlyamide and also some components used together<br>
with some agarose gels, are toxic and/or carcinogenic, and contact with users<br>
must be strictly avoided, particularly when disposing of the gels after use.<br>
It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide a device and method<br>
which overcomes the limitations of prior art electrophoresis devices and<br>
methods.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide a device for enabling safe<br>
handling and disposal of gels which may contain harmful substances.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide such a device that is<br>
simple to use.<br><br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide such a device that is<br>
relatively simple mechanically and thus economic to produce.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide such a device that is<br>
adapted for use with regular horizontal electrophoresis equipment.<br>
These and other aims are accomplished in the present invention by providing a<br>
precast cassette for horizontal electrophoresis, in particular a disposable and<br>
closed cassette for horizontal electrophoresis. In particular, the cassette<br>
comprises preferably a pair of traps, one at each longitudinal end of the<br>
cassette, each trap comprising an absorption material for preventing toxic<br>
material from migrating out of the cassette. This is an important safety<br>
feature, particularly in view of the handling of the horizontal electrophoresis<br>
apparatus and of the cassette during use thereof, and more so in view-ofthe<br>
disposability of the cassette, which thus minimises the risk of human contact<br>
with toxic substances comprised in the cassette.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the cassette comprises a box-like construction,<br>
having a bottom flat base and four vertical walls joined thereto about its<br>
periphe^, and an upper cover mountable onto the vertical walls to define a gel<br>
chamber into which gel may be precast. The cassette also comprises openings<br>
at two opposite ends of the bottom base to enable ionic communication between<br>
the gel and an electrolytic solution in which the cassette may be partially<br>
immersed. The openings ai'e preferably comprised in downwardly extending<br>
hollow leg members running the transverse length of the cassette at two<br>
longitudinal ends thereof, the leg members comprising gel in ionic<br>
communication with the main body of gel within the cassette. This design is<br>
particularly adapted for using the cassette with standard ion exchange<br>
chambers. Activated carbon or the like is provided in the legs and also in a<br>
second trapping chamber to absorb dangerous materials such as the dyeing<br>
compounds.<br><br>
US 3,888,759 discloses a gel cassette having a substantially box-like<br>
construction, having a downwardly depending transversely extending hollow<br>
leg at each longitudinal end of the cassette. The device appears to be reusable,<br>
providing the user with different options, and it appears intended for the user<br>
to cast the gel each time, rather than providing a precast package. There is no<br>
disclosure or suggestion of a trap for toxic materials, and in fact teaches away<br>
from this concept.<br>
US 5,443,704 discloses a substantially box-like container assembly for<br>
packaging prefabricated gels, containing more than one precast gel in a<br>
stacked arrangement. No trap for harmful substances is disclosed therein.<br>
US 5,064,769 discloses a gel for immunoassay of a single protein species in<br>
which the horizontal gel comprises a first part made from acrylamide gel<br>
having a proportion of agarpse (0.7%) and a second part made from agarose<br>
gel. No trap for harmful substances is disclosed therein.<br>
In US 3,930,983 an arrangement and process are disclosed for determining<br>
antigens, in which a support plate is coated with an agar or agarose as a<br>
matrix in successive gel strips. No trap for harmful substances is disclosed<br>
therein.<br>
US 5,582,702 is directed to a self-contained electrophoresis apparatus<br>
comprising a housing having a gel body accommodated therein together with<br>
ion exchange matrices and electrodes, which are electrically connectable to an<br>
external power source. The apparatus is thus not generally compatible with<br>
existing ion exchange chambers currently used for horizontal electrophoresis.<br>
While it is presented as optionally "disposable", the apparatus is nonetheless<br>
complex, and does not appear inexpensive in comparison with simple precast<br>
gels, such as those described in US 5,443,704, for example. Moreover, the<br>
apparatus contains elements which are not normally considered disposable,<br>
notably the electrodes and ion exchange matrices. In fact by being fully closed,<br>
in particular regarding the lower side thereof, the apparatus cannot be used<br>
with standard ion exchange apparatuses, and thus needs a dedicated stand<br>
having electrical connection points for the electrodes. Optionany, ethidium<br><br>
cations may be released into the gel by one of the ion exchange matrices within<br>
the housing, which may be simply disposed after use. However, and as stated<br>
earlier, the complexity of the apparatus renders this a rather expensive<br>
solution for the disposal of the contaminated gel. Furthermore, no traps are<br>
actually provided for retaining the contaminants therein - therefore, if any<br>
openings were to be made, for example, at the lower part of the cassette, for<br>
example as in the present invention, the contaminants could flow out, in<br>
contrast thereto.<br>
EP 471949 discloses a capillary tube for performing capillary zone<br>
electrophoresis.' The tube is modified by including a polystyrene frit that<br>
divides the tube into a downstream free zone, and an upstream zone which can<br>
comprise a polyacrylamide stacking gel. The gel plug functions as a filter to<br>
pre-treat the samples that are to be analysed in the free zone of the tube. This<br>
is in contrast to the present invention, wherein the traps are placed<br>
downstream to treat the contaminants in the gel during and at the end of the<br>
electrophoretic process, and not prior to the beginning thereof. In fact, the<br>
samples in the present invention do not generally require pretreatment as<br>
described in this patent. Furthermore, the present invention uses agarose gel<br>
with an absorption material for retaining therein a target substance. On the<br>
other hand, in EP 471949 uses polyacrylamide, which is also toxic and use<br>
thereof would be detrimental in the present invention as a trapping gel, and in<br>
fact counterproductive for this purpose. Thus, this publication teaches away<br>
from the present invention.<br>
W092/17259 describes a method for identifying a solute of interest in an<br>
effluent stream. A sample containing the mixture to be separated is passed<br>
through a first system capable of partitioning the components of the mixture,<br>
and a detector provides a first output that describes the temporal and/or<br>
spatial sequence of components exiting the first system. The effluent stream is<br>
then passed through a second system capable of extracting a solute of interest<br>
from the effluent, and a detector provides a second output that describes the<br>
temporal and/or spatial sequence of components exiting the second system,<br><br>
which, no longer includes the solute of interest. The solute of interest can then<br>
be identified in the first output by comparing this to the second output. This<br>
method is thus directed at identifying a substance in a first separating system<br>
by employing a parallel second separating system, and is thus very different to<br>
the present invention, in which only a single electrophoresis process is<br>
employed, the target substance being removed during that process. WO<br>
92/17259 does not address the problem of, nor does it provide a solution for,<br>
the trapping of toxic substances in an electrophoresis process, less so in the<br>
manner of the present invention.<br>
WO 95/20155 relates to a sample holder in the form of a well, into which a<br>
sample and a first molten gel is introduced. When the first gel/sample mixture<br>
has solidified, the sample holder is applied against one end of a second gel<br>
slab, such as to bring the first gel/sample solidified mixture in ionic contact<br>
with the second gel. At no time is the first gel in solidified form brought into<br>
contact with the second gel prior to introducing the sample. WO 99/30145<br>
relates to a slotted electrophoresis gel composition and methods for use, for<br>
providing a multilayered gel for vertical gel electrophoresis. It does not<br>
address, nor provide a solution for, the problem of forming stable sample wells<br>
for horizontal electrophoresis in an acrylamide gel. These publications do not<br>
address the problem of, nor do they provide a solution for, the trapping of toxic<br>
substances in an electrophoresis process, less so in the manner of the present<br>
invention<br>
Other publications of background relevance to the present invention include<br>
WO 98/10277, US 5228971, US 5827418, US 3873433, EP 971229,<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention is defined by the claims, the contents of which are to be<br>
read as included within the disclosure of the specification, and will now be<br>
described by way of example with reference to the accompanying Figures.<br>
The present invention relates to a device for horizontal electrophoresis which<br>
may be provided with any required macromolecule-separating compounds and<br>
any buffer compositions that are used for running macrouaolecules, as well as<br>
any required labelling compounds, characterised in comprising at least one<br>
suitable trap for trapping and retaining at least one of any such compounds<br>
therein, thereby minimising contamination hazard to the external<br>
environment including users of the device.<br>
Such an apparatus or device is preferably disposable, but may also be re-<br>
usable for a host of applications. The term "disposable" in the present<br>
application means that the devices are designed (in corresponding<br>
embodiments) to be thrown away or otherwise disposed off after one use with<br>
only negligible economic loss. Such negligible economic loss may be<br>
comparable, for example, to the economic loss incurred in disposing of plastic<br>
pipettes for handling liquids or eppendorf tubes. While these items may be<br>
used more than once, they are nonetheless typically thrown away after a<br><br>
single use, this being more cost effective than cleaning and/or sterilising the<br>
same for subsequent use.<br>
Referring to the Figures, Figures 1 to 4 illustrate a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The apparatus or cassette, designated by the numeral<br>
(1), comprises a housing (100) of a box-like construction, a suitable gel (38) for<br>
electrophoresis, accommodated in a first chamber (30), and a second suitable<br>
gel for trapping dangerous substances therein, accommodated in a second<br>
chamber (40).<br>
The cassette (1) comprises a stepped bottom base (10) having a flat upper part<br>
(11) and a flat but shorter lower part (13) joined longitudinally one to the other<br>
by a first intermediate vertical wall (15). Two side walls (12), (14) run the<br>
longitudinal length of the cassette (1) and are preferably integrally joined to<br>
the base (10). and to end walls (16) and (18) at opposite longitudinalends of the<br>
cassette (1). A second intermediate wall (19) is joined to side walls (12) and<br>
(14) at a longitudinal location between first intermediate wall (15) at the end<br>
wall (IS) closest thereto. The second intermediate wall (19) substantially<br>
divides each side wall (12) and (14) longitudinally into longer portions (12')<br>
and (14'), respectively, extending between the end wall (16) and intermediate<br>
wall (19), and shorter portions (12") and (14"), respectively, extending between<br>
the intermediate wall (19) and the other end wall (18). The upper edge of the<br>
second intermediate wall (19) is substantially coplanar with the upper edge of<br>
end wall (16) and with the upper edges of at least the longer side wall portions<br>
(12') and (14').. and thus enable an upper cover (50) to be releasably and<br>
sealingly mounted thereonto. Upper cover (50) may comprise optionally<br>
closable apertures (51) and (53) longitudinally spaced one from the other along<br>
the mid-line of the cover (50). These apertures (51), (53) facilitate pouring of<br>
gel into the cassette (1) when the cover (50) is in place, described in greater<br>
detail hereinbelow. Thus, the second intermediate wall (19), end wall (16) and<br>
the longer side wall portions (12') and (14'), together with upper cover (50) and<br>
the upper part (11) of the base (10) define the first chamber (30) of the cassette<br>
(1). The second chamber (40) of the cassette is correspondingly defined by the<br><br>
second intermediate wall (19), end wall (18) and the shorter side wall portions<br>
(12") and (14"), together with upper wall (55) and the lower part (13) of the<br>
base (10). Upper wall (55) may optionally be joined typically integrally with<br>
the second intermediate wall (19), end wall (18) and the shorter side wall<br>
portions (12") and (14"). Preferably, though, and as illustrated in Figures 1 and<br>
4, upper wall (55) is integrally joined to the upper cover (50) and is releasably<br>
and sealingly mountable onto the upper edges of the second intermediate wall<br>
(19), end wall (18) and the shorter side wall portions (12") and (14"). The lower<br>
edge of the second intermediate wall (19), however, does not extend as far as<br>
the lower part (13) of the base (10), and thus communication between the first<br>
chamber (30) and second chamber (40) is provided by virtue of the longitudinal<br>
gap between the first and second intermediate walls, (15) and (19),<br>
respectively.<br>
Thus, in the preferred embodiment, the first chamber (30) is partially<br>
superposed over the second chamber (40), defining an area (31) where the two<br>
chambers overlap horizontally. At least a portion of this area (31) has an<br>
opening, or preferably is open, providing communication between the first<br>
chamber (30) and the second chamber (40).<br>
Preferably, the cassette (1) or other embodiments thereof is provided with a<br>
suitable first gel matrix (38) accommodated in the first chamber (30) and a<br>
suitable second gel portion (48) is accommodated in the second chamber (40).<br>
Alternatively, the cassette (1) or other embodiments thereof may be provided<br>
without one or both these gels, which can be cast as and when needed. In any<br>
case, the first gel matrix (38) is adapted for performing electrophoresis therein,<br>
and typically comprises at least one dyeing compound. The term dyeing<br>
compound is taken herein to include any type of labelling substance that may<br>
be used to identify the molecules of interest in the sample being<br>
electrophoresed in the first gel matrix (38). The second gel matrix (48) is<br>
adapted for trapping and retaining therein at least one target substance<br>
capable of migrating thereto at least from the first gel (38) during<br>
electrophoresis, and dyeing compounds are typically such target substances.<br><br>
The second gel matrix is typically adapted for trapping by comprising an<br>
absorbent material mixed therewith and which prevents the target substance<br>
from exiting the second gel (48).<br>
Top cover (50), and preferably the rest of housing (100) is made from any-<br>
suitable ultraviolet-transparent material. Preferably, the whole of the cassette<br>
(1), in particular the housing (100), is made from an economically disposable<br>
material.<br>
Optionally, a tab (57) is provided at one end of the cover (50), and a<br>
corresponding platform (58) is provided at end (16), preferably integrally<br>
joined thereto, such that the tab (57) is in registry with platform (58) and<br>
mutually spaced by space (59) when the cover (50) is in place over chamber<br>
(30), By placing a suitable flattened tool such as a screwdriver or key (not<br>
shown), for example, within space (59) and rotating it by 90°, say, the cover<br>
(50) may be snapped open and thus removed from the chamber (30).<br>
Having an openable cover (50) is important in applications, for example, where<br>
it is required to remove some of the first gel portion (38) for further processing<br>
such as electroelution or transfer of molecules from the first gel portion (38) to<br>
a membrane (western blot or northern blot).<br>
The cassette (1) also comprises openings at two opposite ends of the bottom<br>
base (10) to enable ionic communication between the gel that is accommodated<br>
in the cassette (1) and an electrolytic solution in which the cassette (1) may be<br>
partially immersed. Thus, transverse opening (32) at longitudinal end of the<br>
upper part (11) of the base (10) near end wall (16) provides communication<br>
between the first chamber (30) and the outside of the cassette (1). Similarly,<br>
transverse opening (42) at longitudinal end of the lower part (11) of the base<br>
(10) near end wall (18) provides communication between the second chamber<br>
(40) and the outside of the cassette (1).<br>
Openings (32) and (42) serve to provide ionic communication between the gels<br>
accommodated within the cassette (1) and external ionic solutions, and thus<br><br>
enable electrophoresis to be conducted within the cassette (1) with the<br>
provision of a suitable electric field. Preferably, though, the openings at the<br>
bottom base (10) are in the form of substantially hollow leg members running<br>
the transverse length of the cassette (1) at two longitudinal ends thereof, the<br>
leg members also being capable of accommodating gel in ionic communication<br>
with the main body of gel accommodated within the cassette (1). This inverted-<br>
U design is particularly adapted for using the cassette (1) with standard ion<br>
exchange chambers, which are generally in the form of two juxtaposed buffer-<br>
containing troughs separated by an elevated platform which is ideal for<br>
supporting the base (10) of cassette (1). One leg member is extends into one<br>
trough, and the other leg member into the second trough to provide ionic<br>
communication at least between the gel contained in the legs and the<br>
corresponding buffer solutions in the troughs. One trough has a cathode and<br>
the other trough has an anode.<br>
Thus, the cassette (1) optionally, and preferably, comprises hollow legs (60)<br>
and (70) provided at opposite longitudinal ends thereof. At one end of the<br>
cassette (1), leg (60) is denned by a downwards extension of end wall (16),<br>
together with downwardly extending tab-like projections (62) at the end of<br>
longer side wall portions (12") and (14"), respectively, and a fourth wall (65)<br>
projecting downwards from the upper part (11) of base (10). Similarly, leg (70)<br>
at the other longitudinal end of the cassette (1) is defined by a downwards<br>
extension of end wall (18), together with downwardly extending tab-like<br>
projections (72) at the end of shorter side wall portions (12') and (14'),<br>
respectively, and a corresponding fourth wall (75) projecting downwards from<br>
the lower part (13) of base (10). Each leg (60), (70) are open at the<br>
corresponding bottom ends (66), (76) thereof, which may be temporarily closed<br>
(at least prior to use of the cassette (1)) by means of suitable removable<br>
adhesive strips (not shown) adhered thereto. The bottom ends (66), (76) are in<br>
communication with the first chamber (30) and second chamber (40),<br>
respectively, via the transverse openings (32) and (42), respectively.<br><br>
The first chamber (30) is thus adapted to accommodate a suitable gel matrix<br>
(38) adapted for electrophoresis, preferably comprising a plurality of wells (39)<br>
for accepting samples that are to undergo an electrophoretic process. The gel<br>
matrix (38) typically comprises an agarose gel, though alternatively it may<br>
comprise other types of gels, included multilayered gels, which comprise strips<br>
of different gels or gel compositions juxtaposed one with another sequentially.<br>
Alternatively, the gel matrix (38) may comprise a hybrid gel matrix having a<br>
substantially solidified first gel portion juxtaposed with at least a<br>
substantially solidified second gel portion, wherein the first gel portion is<br>
capable of accommodating therein at least one sample for electrophoresis after<br>
said first gel portion is in solidified form, and is generally made from or<br>
contains sufficient agarsose to provide a stable well structure for<br>
accommodating samples, and the second gel portion is adapted for enabling an<br>
electrophoresis processto be applied to such a sample that may be<br>
accommodated in said first gel portion, the second gel portion comprising an<br>
acrylamide gel. Such hybrid gels are disclosed in co-pending Israel Patent<br>
Application No. 139446, filed by Applicants.<br>
The wells (39) may be formed by a comb (80), for example, having teeth (84)<br>
that are typically inserted into the first gel portion (37) via corresponding<br>
apertures (52) comprised in the cover (50). Alternatively, a common slit may be<br>
provided in. the cover (50) in place of the individual apertures (52). Typically,<br>
the comb (SO) is kept in place engaged with respect to the cover (50) until the<br>
cassette (1) is used, whereupon samples may be introduced into one or more<br>
wells (39) via corresponding apertures (52). After use, and before disposing of<br>
the cassette (1), the apertures (52) are preferably again closed by means of the<br>
comb (BO),<br>
The agarose gel (38) is preferably provided precast in the first chamber (30),<br>
though may be alternatively cast by users in some applications. In any case,<br>
the gel may be poured into the first chamber (30) having first removed the<br>
cover (50). Another method of casting the gel is by turning the cassette (1)<br>
vertically such that the end wall (18) is uppermost Gel is then poured into tie<br><br>
chamber (30) up to the required height (which corresponds to the end wall (16)<br>
when the cassette (1) is returned to its horizontal position). With this method,<br>
the gel may be poured into the chamber (30) via aperture (53). Other ways of<br>
casting the gel are also possible. Wells (39) may be formed in the normal<br>
manner using, for example, a comb (80). However, the step of casting the first<br>
gel matrix (38) is usually performed after the second gel matrix (48) is cast, as<br>
described hereinbelow.<br>
According to the present invention, at least one trap, and preferably two traps<br>
are provided for preventing release of dangerous substances from the cassette<br>
(1) to the external environment. Many labelling. compounds, as well as<br>
acrylamide gels, may be toxic and/or carcinogenic and therefore potentially<br>
harmful, to the cassette operator and to the environment. Thus, a first trap (90)<br>
is provided in the form of the second chamber (40) for trapping and thus<br>
retaining' labelling compounds and the like, and thus preventing the same<br>
from exiting the cassette (1). Second chamber (40) -which is in open<br>
communication with first chamber (30), and at least in ionic communication<br>
therewith when both chambers are accommodating gels - is provided with a<br>
suitable second gel matrix (48), typically agarose gel having active carbon,<br>
silica gel (at a special pH condition), for example, or any other suitable<br>
absorption material, mixed therewith. The term absorption material is taken<br>
herein to include any type of material capable of retaining therein at least one<br>
target substance, such a target substance being typically capable of migrating<br>
in an electrophoretic process. Particularly when the cassette (1) is used with<br>
precast agarose gels, the dye compounds which are used originally for<br>
visualising the molecules being separated, are provided mixed with the<br>
agarose gel in the first chamber (30), thereby removing the hazard associated<br>
with handling of these compounds prior to use of the cassette (1). Under<br>
electrophoresis, molecules of interest contained in samples provided at the<br>
wells (39) migrate from the wells (39) towards the end wall (16). At the same<br>
time, dyeing compounds such as ethidium bromide comprised in the gel<br><br>
migrate in the opposite direction, i.e., towards end wall (18), thereby arriving<br>
at the second chamber (40), and are prevented from leaving the second<br>
chamber (40) as well as leg (70) by virtue of the activated carbon particles or<br>
other suitable absorbent material comprised therein. Typically, electrostatic<br>
interactions build up between activated carbon particles and ethidium bromide<br>
leading to absorption of the latter within the appropriate gel matrix. A second<br>
trap (95) is provided at the other longitudinal end of the cassette (1) to absorb<br>
the dye compounds as the dye, when the user mistakenly runs the gel in an<br>
inverted configuration. In the latter situation, migration occurs from end (16)<br>
towards end (18), rather than the vice versa, and dye compounds are absorbed<br>
by the trap (95). The second trap (95) also prevents unwanted migration of dye<br>
compounds by diffusion forces when the cassette is not being used. This<br>
enables the cassette to have a relatively long shelf life, perhaps a year or more,<br>
for "example." The second "trap(95) is" economically provided by The hollow leg<br>
(60), which comprises an third gel matrix (69) comprising an agarose gel<br>
having a quantity of activated carbon, silica gel (at a special pH condition), for<br>
example; and/or any other suitable absorption material mixed therein. Thus,<br>
even if openings (76) and (66) in legs (70) and (60), respectively, remain<br>
unsealed, the dyeing compounds will not run out due to their adherence to the<br>
absorption materials.<br>
The traps (90), (95) are generally prepared before casting the gel in the first,<br>
electrophoresis, chamber (30). With the cover (50), including portion (55) off,<br>
and with the bottom ends of the legs (60) and (70) sealed with suitable<br>
adhesive peel-off tape, agarose gel (79), containing mixed therein a suitable<br>
proportion of activated carbon is poured into leg (70) and chamber (40), up to<br>
the level of the upper part (11) of base (10). Then, agarose gel (69), also<br>
containing mixed therein a suitable proportion of activated carbon or other<br>
suitable absorption material is poured into leg (60) and preferably also the<br>
second chamber (40), i.e. up to the level of the upper part (11) of base (10).<br>
When the gels (79) and (69) are set the first gel matrix (38) may be poured<br>
arid set in the first chamber (30) as hereinbefore described.<br><br>
While trap (90) has been described as being in the form of a second chamber<br>
(40) at a level below the first chamber (30), this need not generally be so.<br>
Minimally, the trap (90) needs only to be adapted to provide ionic<br>
communication between the absorbent material comprised therein and the gel<br>
comprised in the first chamber (30), and situated with respect to the first<br>
chamber such as to be substantially downstream of the migration path of the<br>
dye compounds. Any configuration of trap (90) meeting these criteria are<br>
generally suitable. Thus, in a more simplified cassette, for example, a single<br>
chamber is provided, in which one end is provided with agarose gel containing<br>
absorption material, and this is juxtaposed with and in communication with a<br>
second body of gel within the chamber for electrophoresis.<br>
While the cassette (1) preferably comprises both the traps (90), (95), the second<br>
trap (95) is generally not required. Thus, optionally, a simpler cassette (1) may<br>
be provided without the he second trap (95), if it is so desired<br>
Further optionally, the cassette (1) may be provided without the said hollow<br>
legs (60) and (70), leading to a simplified structure. Thus communication<br>
between said first chamber (30) and external ionic solutions is via opening (32)<br>
in the base (10), and communication between said second chamber (40) and<br>
external ionic solutions is via opening (42) in the base (10).<br>
Thus, referring to Figure 5, a second embodiment of the present invention<br>
comprises a housing (200) having a base (210) and peripheral walls joined<br>
thereto at a lower end thereof, to define a chamber (234). A first gel matrix<br>
(238), similar to the first gel matrix (38) of the first embodiment, mutatis<br>
mutandis, and a second gel matrix (248) similar to the second gel matrix (48)<br>
of the first embodiment, mutatis mutandis, juxtaposed and in ionic contact<br>
with one another, are accommodated in the chamber (234). Thus, the first gel<br>
matrix (238) is adapted for performing electrophoresis, and may thus comprise<br>
dyeing substances and the like, while the second gel matrix (248) is adapted<br><br>
for trapping therein dangerous target substances such as these dyeing<br>
compounds, for example. The chamber (234) comprises openings (232) and<br>
(242) at longitudinal ends of the base (210) for providing ionic communication<br>
between the first gel matrix (238) and an external buffer solution, and between<br>
the second gel matrix (248) and an external buffer solution. Wells (239) are<br>
provided in the first gel matrix (238) for introducing samples to be<br>
electrophoresed. Optionally, a cover plate (250) may be provided, having<br>
suitable openings (252) for a comb (280) to be inserted therein to form wells<br>
(239).<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention comprises all the components of<br>
the second embodiment as described above, mutatis mutandis, and is<br>
illustrated in Figure 6. In addition, though, the chamber- (234) further<br>
comprises a third gel matrix (269) juxtaposed and in ionic communication with<br>
the first gel matrix (238), but located at the opposed longitudinal end of the<br>
housing (200) with relation to the second gel matrix (248). The third gel matrix<br>
(269) serves as a precautionary second trap, and is thus similar to the third gel<br>
matrix (69) of the first embodiment, mutatis mutandis.<br>
While in the foregoing description describes in detail only a few specific<br>
embodiments of the invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that the invention is not limited thereto and that other variations in form and<br>
details may be possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the<br>
invention herein disclosed.<br><br>
