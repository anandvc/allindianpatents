Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of N- [4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-{2H)-naphthalenylidene] methanamine by reacting 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)- 3,4 - dihydro- 1 - (2H)-naphthalenone with aq.monomethylainine in water miscible solvent (s).<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-{2H)-naphthalenylidene]-methanamine  is a useful intermediate for the preparation of sertraline hydrochloride namely (+)-cis-(IS,4S)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-naphthalenamine,which has the structure as given below<br><br>
Sertraline hydrochloride is used for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder. Sertraline was first disclosed in the European Patent EP 30081.<br>
Various routes of synthesis have been used or suggested for the preparation of N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-{2H)-naphthalenylidene] methanamine.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,536,518 equivalent to EP 30081 discloses a process for the preparation of sertraline hydrochloride, involving condensation of 4- (3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalenone with mono methylamine and catalyzed by titanium tetrachloride yielding N -[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)- 3,4-dihydro-1-(2H)-naphthalenylidene] methanamine under anhydrous conditions.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,855,500 discloses a process for the preparation of N-4- (3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalenylidene]-methanamine   in   which<br><br>
molecular sieves are employed to achieve the anhydrous condition for the reaction to promote the condensation reaction between 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l- (2H)-naphthalenone and monomethylamine.<br>
PCT Publication No, WO 99/36394 discloses a process in which the condensation reaction of 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l- (2H)-naphthalenone with mono methylamine is performed in sub surface manner in an alcohol solvent under pressure up to 60 psi. This reaction is also carried out under anhydrous conditions.<br>
U.S. Patent application 2003/013,768 discloses a process in which an amide solvent is employed and the imination reaction is carried out under anhydrous condition with positive pressure of inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon in presence of acid catalyst such as formic acid. This process requires an additional step involving the washing of the product with other solvent for removal of amide solvent, which also results in lowering of yield.<br>
The prior art emphasizes the need for anhydrous conditions for the reaction of 4- (3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalenone with monomethyl amine. Moreover the final product obtained is contaminated with catalyst / by-product of catalyst employed in the reaction. An additional step becomes is imperative in the prior art to separate the final product from the catalyst / by-product of the catalyst.<br>
It is a longstanding need to provide an industrially viable cost-effective process for the preparation of N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4~dihydro -1- {2H) -naphthalenylidene]-methanamine without the use of anhydrous conditions, molecular sieves, catalyst etc or need of additional purification step as taught in the prior art.<br>
Sximmary of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a commercially feasible, eco-friendly process for the preparation of N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-1-(2H)-naphthalenylidene]-methanamine obviating the need for anhydrous conditions, molecular sieves, catalyst etc or additional purification steps.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the process for the preparation of N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalenylidene] -. methanamine in water, water miscible solvent(s)<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the process for the preparation of N -[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalenylidene] -methanamine without any catalyst.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that it is possible to react 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalenone with excess of aqueous monomethylamine to yield N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalenylidene]-methanamine without the requirement of anhydrous conditions and / or catalysts as depicted in the scheme-I.<br><br>
4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro    N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-<br>
-1- (2H) -naphthalenone	(2H) -naphthalenylidene] -methanamine<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The process of the present invention comprises:<br>
Reaction  of  4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)  -3,4-dihydro-l-  (2H)-naphthalenone<br>
with  aqueous  monomethylamine  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  ambient<br>
temperature in presence of water, water miscible organic solvent(s)<br>
Separation of product<br>
Washing of wet cake with water /water miscible solvent(s) mixture and<br>
water<br>
-  Drying of the product at 50-75 Â°C. The reaction of 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)- naphthalenone /its chiral isomers with excess of aqueous monomethylamine as represented in the above scheme is carried out at atmospheric pressure in any water miscible<br><br>
solvent(s) such as: alcohols containing carbon atom Ci-Cg, acetone, 1,4-dioxane, tertrahydrofuran, ethylene glycocol dimethylether, digol,glycerol, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.<br>
The preferred solvents are 1,4-dioxane, tertrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol the most preferred solvent being 1,4-dioxane.<br>
The water miscible solvent used in the reaction is in ratio of 1:1 to 1:10 (w/v) , preferably in the ratio 1:2 to 1:3 (w/v) with respect to 4 - (3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l- (2H)-naphthalenone employed in the reaction. The concentration of aqueous monomethylamine solution used in the reaction is -5-50 % (w/v), preferably 35-45 %( w/v).<br>
The molar quantities of aqueous monomethylamine employed in the reaction is about 1-50 moles with respect to 4-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)-3, 4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalenone, preferably about  20 moles and most preferably about 10 moles.<br>
The reaction is carried out in the temperature range of about 0Â°C tol50Â°C,<br>
preferably at about 10Â°C to 60Â°C, and most preferably at about 25Â°C to 48Â°C. The reaction is continued under the conditions described above until such time as it is substantially complete. The reaction can reach to completion in 4 hours to 15 days, however it is completed preferably in 12-60 hours, most preferably 16-30 hours. After completion of reaction the resulting mass is<br>
cooled to about 5Â°C to 20Â°C, and the product N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-1-(2H)-naphthalenylidene]methanamine / its chiral isomers is separated by filtration / centrifugation, washed with water / water-solvent mixture prior to drying.<br>
As is evident from the above description, the reaction of 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) -3,4-dihydro-l- (2H)-naphthalenone with aq. monomethylamine is carried out without creating anhydrous conditions or use of catalysts as emphasized in the prior art. Further, as the reaction is carried out without any catalyst, product obtained is free from contamination of catalyst / by product of catalyst. Furthermore the removal of solvent and monomethylamine from the product is achieved by washing the wet cake with water / water-miscible solvent.<br><br>
The resulting imine compound i.e.,  N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-(2H)-naphthalenylidene] methanamine is used for the preparation of sertraline hydrochloride  or  (+)-cis-(IS,4S)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-1-naphthalenamine hydrochloride.<br>
