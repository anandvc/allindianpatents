				<td>INHIBITORS OF CYTOSOLIC PHOSPHOLIPASE A2<br>
The present invention relates to chemical inhibitors of the activity of various<br>
phospholipase enzymes, particularly cytosolic phospholipase A2 enzymes (cPLA2),<br>
more particularly including inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha enzymes<br>
(cPLA2a) and to novel N-benzhydryl indole intermediates therefor. The invention<br>
also relates to methods for treating or alleviating asthma and the symptoms of<br>
asthma and/or the symptoms of arthritic and rheumatic disorders in mammals,<br>
including humans utilizing these chemical inhibitors.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Leukotrienes and prostagtandins are important mediators of inflammation,<br>
each of which contributes to the development of an inflammatory response in a<br>
different way. Leukotrienes recruit inflammatory cells such as neutrophils to an<br>
inflamed site, promote the extravasation of these cells and stimulate release of<br>
superoxide and proteases which damage the tissue. Leukotrienes also play a<br>
pathophysiological role in the hypersensitivity experienced by asthmatics [See, e.g.<br>
B. Samuelson et at., Science. 237:1171-76 (1987)]. Prostaglandins enhance<br>
inflammation by increasing blood flow and therefore infiltration of leukocytes to<br>
inflamed sites. Prostaglandins also potentiate the pain response induced by stimuli.<br>
Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are unstable and are not stored in cells, but<br>
are instead synthesized [W. L Smith, Biochem. J.. 259315-324 (1989)1 from<br>
arachidonic add in response to stimuli. Prostaglandins are produced from<br>
arachidonic acid by the action of COX-1 and COX- 2 enzymes. Arachidonic acid is<br>
also the substrate for the distinct enzyme pathway leading to the production of<br>
leukotrienes.<br>
Arachidonic acid which is fed into these two distinct inflammatory pathways is<br>
released from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2<br>
enzymes (hereinafter PLA2). The reaction catalyzed by PLA2 is believed to represent<br>
the rate-limiting step in the process of lipid mediated biosynthesis and the production<br>
of ammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes. When the phospholipid substrate of<br>
PLA2 is of the phosphotidyl choline class with an ether linkage in the sn~1 position,<br>
the lysophospholipid produced is the immediate precursor of platelet activating factor<br>
(hereafter called PAF), another potent mediator of inflammation [S.I. Wasserman,<br>
Hospital Practice, 15:49-58 (1988)].<br>
Most anti-inflammatory therapies have focused on preventing production of<br>
either prostglandins or leukotrienes from these distinct pathways, but not on alt of<br>
them. For example, ibuprofen, aspirin, and indomethacin are all NSAIDs which<br>
inhibit the production of prostaglandins by COX-1/COX-2 inhibition, but have no<br>
effect on the inflammatory production of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid in the<br>
other pathway. Conversely, zileuton inhibits only the pathway of conversion of<br>
arachidonicdonic acid to leukotrienes, without affecting the production of prostaglandins.<br>
None of these widely-used anti-inflammatory agents affects the production of PAF.<br>
Consequently the direct inhibition of the activity of PLA2 has been suggested<br>
as a useful mechanism for a therapeutic agent, i.e., to interfere with the inflammatory<br>
response. [See. e.g., J. Chang et al, Biochem. Pharmacol.. 2ยง:2429-2436 (1987)].<br>
A family of PLA2 enzymes characterized<br>
sequenced and ultimately secreted from the cell have been sequenced and<br>
structurally defined. These secreted PLA2S have an approximateiy 14 kD molucular<br>
weight and contain seven disulfide bonds which are necessary for activity.these<br>
PLA2S are found in large quantities in mammalian pancreas, bee venom, and various<br>
snake venom. [See, e.g., references 13-15 in Chang et al, cited above; and E. A.<br>
Dennis, Druo Devel. Res.. 10:205-220 (1987).] However, the pancreatic enzyme is<br>
believed to serve a digestive function and, as such, should not be important in the<br>
production of the inflammatory mediators whose production must be tightly regulated.<br>
The primary structure of the first human non-pancreatic PLA2 has been<br>
determined. This non-pancreatic PLA2 is found in platelets, synovial fluid, and spleen<br>
and is also a secreted enzyme. This enzyme is a member of the aforementioned<br>
family. [See, J. J. Seilhamer et al, J. Biol. Chem.. 264:5335-5338 (1989); R. M.<br>
Kramer et al, J. Biol. Chem.. 264:5768-5775 (1989); and A. Kando et al, Biochem.<br>
Biophys. Res. Comm.. 163:42-48 (1989)]. However, it is doubtful that this enzyme is<br>
important in the synthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and PAF, since the non-<br>
pancreatic PLA2 is an extracellular protein which would be difficult to regulate, and<br>
the next enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways for these compounds are intracellular<br>
proteins. Moreover, there is evidence that PLA2 is regulated by protein kinase C and<br>
G proteins [R. Burch and J. Axelrod, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.. 84:6374-6378<br>
(1989)] which are cytosolic proteins which must act on intracellular proteins. It would<br>
be impossible for the non-pancreatic PLA2 to function in the cytosol, since the high<br>
reduction potential would reduce the disulfide bonds and inactivate the enzyme.<br>
A murine PLA2 has been identified in the murine macrophage cell line,<br>
designated RAW 264.7. A specific activity of 2 mois/min/mg, resistant to reducing<br>
conditions, was reported to be associated with the approximately 60 kD molecule.<br>
However, this protein was not purified to homogeneity. [See, C. C. Leslie et al,<br>
Biochem. Biophvs. Acta.. 963:476-492 (1988)]. The references cited above are<br>
incorporated by reference herein for information pertaining to the function of the<br>
phospholipase enzymes, particularly PLA2<br>
A cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (hereinafter "cPLA2a) has also been<br>
identified and cloned. See, U.S. Patent Nos. 5.322.776 and 5.354,677, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth. The enzyme of these patents is<br>
an intraceliular PLA2 enzyme, purified from its natural source or otherwise produced<br>
in purified form, which functions intracellulariy to produce arachidonic acid in<br>
response to inflammatory stimuli.<br>
Now that several phospholipase enzymes have been identified, it would be<br>
desirable to identify chemical inhibitors of the action of specific phospholipase<br>
enzymes, which inhibitors could be used to treat inflammatory conditions, particularly<br>
where inhibition of production of prostaglandins, Ieukotrienes and PAF are all desired<br>
results. There remains a need in the art for an identification of such anti-<br>
inflammatory agents for therapeutic use in a variety of disease states and<br>
intermediates for their preparation.<br>

Synthesis of Intermediate No. 1 is also described below in Example 135,<br>
Steps 1-8. This intermediate could also be synthesized by method K or method M,<br>
which are set forth below.<br>
Intermediate No. 2<br>
4-{2-[2-(2-Amino-ethyl)-benzyhydryl-5-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl]-ethoxy}-<br>
bonzoic acid methyl ester.<br><br>
Step 1: To 4-hydroxy-benzoic add methyl ester (1.0 eq) in DMF (0.83 M)<br>
was added K2CO3 (2.0 eq) followed by 2-bromo-1,1-diethoxy-ethane and the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred at 110 "C for 2 days. TLC showed a new spot. The reaction<br>
mixture was dHuted with ethyl acetate, washed with 1N NaOH, water, and brine, dried<br>
over sodium sulfate, and solvent was removed to afford desired product in 84 %<br>
yield. This material was used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Step 2: To the above product (1.0 eq) and 5-chloro-2-methyl indote (1.0 eq)<br>
in CH2CI2 (0.12 M) was added triethylsilane (3.0 eq) followed by trifluoroacetic add<br>
(3.0 eq). After being stirred overnight at room temperature, added water and<br>
trifluroacetic acid (1.0 eq) to the reaction mixture, stirred at room temperature for two<br>
days, diluted with CH2Cl2, washed with 1N NaOH, water, brine, dried over sodium<br>
sulfate. Trituration of the material with CH2Cl2 and hexanes afforded the C3 alkylated<br>
indote in 92% yield<br>
Step 3: To the indote from above (1.0 eq) in DMF (0.36 M) at 25 'C was<br>
added NaH (1.2 eq, 60 % dispersion in oil), and the brown solution was stirred at 0 to<br>
โข5 'C for 1 h and then compound bromodiphenylmethane was added (1.1 eq), and<br>
then the reaction mixture was stirred overnight. It was then quenched with water,<br>
diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with water and brine, dried over sodium sulfate<br>
and purified by column chromatography to yield 72 % of the desired product.<br>
Step 4: To the N-alkylated indoie from above (1.0 eq) in CCI4 (0.2 M) was<br>
added N-bromosucrinimide (2.0 eq) and a catalytic amount of benzoyl peroxide. The<br>
solution was heated to reflux for 3h, cooled to 25 *C, filtered, and the solid was<br>
washed with CCI4. The filtrate was concentrated to a foam, which was dried. The<br>
foam was dissolved in acetone, and Ag2CO, (1.1 eq.) was added followed by water<br>
and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. It was filtered<br>
and washed with acetone. The filtrate was concentrated to a residue, to which was<br>
added water. This mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, washed with brine, dried<br>
over sodium sulfate and then chromatographic purification on the residue gave the<br>
desired product in 85 % yield. Alternatively the dibromide from the reaction with NBS<br>
could be poured into DMSO (10-20% concentration by weight) stirred for 30 minutes<br>
at room temperature. When the reaction was deemed complete it was poured into<br>
water and the resulting precipitate was isolated by filtration, the cake was washed<br>
with water and dried to yield an essentially quantitative yield.<br>
Step 5: To the above aldehyde (1.0 equiv) in CH3NO2 (0.2 M) was added<br>
ammonium acetate (4 equiv) and the resulting mixture was heated to reflux for 4 h.<br>
The reaction mixture was then diluted with EtOAc and washed with brine. The<br>
aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were<br>
washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated until an orange<br>
crystalline sofid precipitated. The mixture was refrigerated overnight and the<br>
nitroolefin (76% yield) was collected by filtration. Evaporation of the solution phase<br>
and purification of the residue by column chromatography (gradient elation 100%<br>
toluene ?1% EtOAc-toluene) afforded an additional amount of the nitroolefin (23%<br>
yield).<br>
Step 6: Zinc dust (20 equiv) was suspended in 5% aqueous HCI solution (8 M<br>
Zn/5% HCI). To this mixture was added HgCI2 (0.28 equiv). The mixture was shaken<br>
for 10 min, the aqueous phase was decanted and replaced with fresh 5% HCI, and<br>
again the mixture was shaken for 5 min and the aqueous phase was removed. The<br>
zinc-mercury amalgam thus generated was then added to a mixture of the nitroolefin<br>
(1.0 equiv) and cone. HCI (80 equiv) in THF (0.04 M nitroolefin/THF). The mixture<br>
was Maintained at a gentle reflux for 1 h. The formation of product was followed by<br>
TLC analysis. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and the solids were<br>
removed by filtration through Celite. Cone. NH4OH was added to the solution phase<br>
and the mixture was concentrated on the rotary evaporator. The residue was<br>
dissolved in CH2CI2 and cone. NH4OH. The aqueous phase was extracted with<br>
CH2CI2, and the organic phase was washed with brine, dried over sodium surfate,<br>
and concentrated. Purification by column chromatography afforded the desired<br>
product (65% yield).<br>

Step 4: The product from above (1.46g, 2.87mmol) was dissolved in CCU<br>
(14.5mL), followed by the addition of NBS (1.02g, 5.73mmol) and benzoyl peroxide<br>
(2mg). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 1h (until afl the starting material<br>
disappeared). This mixture was cooled to room temperature, filtered and the solid<br>
was washed with CCU- The filtrate was evaporated to a brown residue, which was<br>
dissolved in acetone (40mL) and water (4mL), AgfiCh (1.75g, 3.16mmol) was then<br>
added to this solution and after being stirred overnight at room temperature, it was<br>
filtered through celrte, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and<br>
water was added to the residue. It was extracted with EtOAc, washed with brine,<br>
dried (Na2SO4), and evaporated to a syrup, which was purified by 10%<br>
EtOAc/hexanes to isolate the 2-formyl indote (1.13g) in 75% yield. Alternatively the<br>
dibromide from the reaction with NBS could be poured into DMSO (10-20%<br>
concentration by weight) and stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. When the<br>
reaction was deemed complete it was poured into water and the resulting precipitate<br>
was" isolated by filtration, the cake was washed with water and dried to yield an<br>
essentially quantitative yield.<br>
Step 5: To a solution of the 2 formyl indote from above (0.52g, 1mmol) in<br>
CH3NO2 (6.2mL) was added NH4OAC (0.077g, 1mmoO, the mixture was heated to<br>
reflux for 1h, NH4OAc (0.077g, 1mmol) was then added, heating at reflux was<br>
continued for an additional 1h, NH4Oac (0.077g, 1mmol) was added again and the<br>
heating continued for further 1h. The reaction mixture was allowed to attain room<br>
temperature, EtOAc (50mL) was added, followed by the addition of 100mL water.<br>
The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc, and the combined organic layers were<br>
washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), and evaporated to a yellow foam, which was<br>
subjected to chromatographic purification using 10% EtOAc/hexanes as an eluent to<br>
yield 6 as a yellow foam in 68% yield (0.38g).<br>
Stop 6: Zn(Hg) was made by adding HgCl2 (3.4g, 7.2 mmol) to a mixture of<br>
Zn-dust (34.68g, 530.35mmol) and 5% HCI (38mL) in a 100mL beaker, this mixture<br>
was stirred vigorously for 10 min. Aqueous phase was decanted and added 38mL of<br>
5% HCI again and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. Aqueous phase was decanted.<br>
This solid was added to the vinyl nitro compound 6 (15g, 26.57mmol) in THF<br>
(660mL) and cone. HCI (64.5mL). This mixture was stirred at room temperature for<br>
1h, then at reflux for 15 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature<br>
and filtered through celite. Aq. NH4OH solution (200mL) was added to the filtrate,<br>
stirred for 15 min and THF was removed under reduced pressure. The aqueous<br>
layer was extracted with CH2CI2, combined organic layer was washed with brine,<br>
dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to a brown foam, which was purified by column<br>
chromatography by editing the column with CHCI9 in the beginning to remove non-<br>
polar impurities then with 2% MeOH/CHCI3 to isolate the desired amine in 46% yield<br>

This invention can be further understood by the following non-limiting specific<br>
examples illustrating the preparation of compounds of the invention.<br>
Method A<br>
The initial indole of Method A may be alkylated at the C3 position (the carbon<br>
atom at the 3-position of the indole moiety) with aldehydes or the corresponding<br>
acetals in the presence of a Lewis or Bronsted add, such as boron trifiouride<br>
etherate or trifluoroacetic acid. The indole nitrogen may then be alkylated by<br>
treatment with a strong base such as sodium bts(trimethylsilyl) amide, n-BuLJ, sodium<br>
hydride or potassium hydride in a solvent such as DMF, DMSO or THF followed by<br>
exposure to the appropriate alkyl halide. The resulting product can be treated with<br>
carbon tetrabromide in carbon tetrachloride and a catalytic amount of benzoyl<br>
peroxide to effect dibromination of the C2 methyl group. The dibromide can then<br>
either be stirred with silver carbonate in acetone water or poured into DMSO and<br>
stirred. Both of these procedures generate the aldehyde which is then subjected to<br>
the nitro aldol reaction with nitromethane and a catalytic amount of ammonium<br>
acetate at reflux. The resulting vinyl nitro intermediate is reduced to the amine upon<br>
treatment with zinc mercury amalgam in a mixture of THF and cone. HCL at reflux.<br>
This amine can then be treated with the requisite sulfonyl chloride under Diphasic<br>
conditions, aqueous sodium bicarbonate/ dichloromethane, or in organic solvent with<br>
the addition of a hindered organic amine base. The final hydrolysis was<br>
accomplished under basic conditions with sodium hydroxide in water and methanol<br>
and THF at room temperature or at elevated temperature. Alternatively it may be<br>
cleaved by treatment with sodium thiomethoxkte in a solvent such as THF or DMF at<br>
elevated temperatures (50'C - 100'C). This method was used in the synthesis of<br>
Examples 1-88,108-112, and 126-128.<br>
Method B<br><br>
Method B<br>
The initial halide of Method B is refluxed in aqueous sodium sulfite and a<br>
suitable cosolvent if necessary, such as alcohol, dioxane etc, for the required amount<br>
of time to form the desired sodium sulfonate. This intermediate was treated with<br>
thionyl chloride, phosphorous pentachloride or oxalyl chloride, in dichtoromethane<br>
with a small amount of OMF and stirred for several hours at room temperature until<br>
the sulfonyl chloride is formed. The thus formed sulfonyl chloride is then used crude<br>
in Method A. This method was used in the synthesis of Examples 1-88,108-112 and<br>
126-128 when the sulfonyl chloride was not commercially available.<br>
chlofo-IH-indoi--vttethoxvibenzoic acid<br>
This synthesis is depicted in Method A.<br>
Step 1: To 4-hydroxy-benzoic acid methyl ester (1.0 eq) in DMF (0.83 M) was<br>
added K2CO3 (2.0 eq) followed by 2-bromo-1,1-diethoxy-ethane and the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred at 110ยฐC for 2 days. TLC showed a new spot. The reaction<br>
mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with 1N NaOH, water, and brine, dried<br>
over sodium sulfate, and solvent was removed to afford desired product in 84%<br>
yield. This material was used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Step 2: To the above product (1.0 eq) and 5-chloro-2-methyl indole (1.0 eq)<br>
in CH2Cl2- (0.12 M) was added triethylsilane (3.0 eq) followed by trifluoroacetic acid<br>
(3.0 eq). After being stirred overnight at room temperature, added water and<br>
trifluroacetic acid (1.0 eq) to the reaction mixture, stirred at room temperature for two<br>
days, diluted with Cn2CI2, washed with 1N NaOH, water, brine, dried over sodium<br>
sulfate. Trituration of the material with CH2Cl2, and hexanes afforded the C3 alkylated<br>
indole in 92% yield<br>
Step 3: To the indole from above (1.0 eq) in DMF (0.36 M) at 25 *C was<br>
added NaH (1.2 eq, 60 % dispersion in oB), and the brown solution was stirred at 0 to<br>
-5 *C for 1 h and then compound bromodiphenylrnethane was added (1.1 eq), and<br>
then the reaction mixture was stirred overnight It was then quenched with water,<br>
diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with water and brine, dried over sodium sulfate<br>
and purified by column chromatography to yield 72 % of the desired product.<br>
Step 4: To the N-alkytated indole from above (1.0 eq) in CCI4 (0.2 M) was<br>
added N-bromosuccinimkte (2.0 eq) and a catalytic amount of benzoyl peroxide. The<br>
solution was heated to reflux for 3h, cooled to 25 ยฐC, filtered, and the solid was<br>
washed with CCI4. The filtrate was concentrated to a foam, which was dried. The<br>
foam was dissolved in acetone, and Ag2CO, (1.1 eq.) was added followed by water<br>
and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. It was filtered<br>
and washed with acetone. The filtrate was concentrated to a residue, to which was<br>
added water. This mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, washed with brine, dried<br>
over sodium suKate and then chromatographic purification on the residue gave the<br>

for 10 min, the aqueous phase was decanted and replaced with fresh 5% HCI, and<br>
again the mixture was shaken for 5 min and the aqueous phase was removed. The<br>
zinc-mercury amalgam thus generated was then added to a mixture of the nitroolefin<br>
(1.0 equiv) and cone. HCI (80 equiv) in THF (0.04 M nitroolefin/THF). The mixture<br>
was maintained at a gentle reflux for 1 h. The formation of product was followed by<br>
TLC analysis. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and the solids were<br>
removed by filtration through Cellte. Cone. NH4OH was added to the solution phase<br>
and the mixture was concentrated on the rotary evaporator. The residue was<br>
dissolved in CH2Cl2 and cone. NH4OH. The aqueous phase was extracted with<br>
CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate,<br>
and concentrated. Purification by column chromatography afforded the desired<br>

added a-toluenesulfonyl chloride (10 equiv). After 1 h the mixture was poured into<br>
saturated sodium bicarbonate and extracted with CH2CI2. The combined organic<br>
phase was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and purified by column<br>
chromatography (gradient elution using 20% EtOAc-hexanes ? 50% BOAc-<br>
hexanes) to afford 86% of the desired product<br>
Step 8: The resulting ester was hydrolyzed by stirring with 1N NaOH (5 equiv)<br>
in THF (0.07 M) and enough MeOH to produce a clear solution. The reaction was<br>
monitored by TLC (10% MeOH-CH2Cl2) for the disappearance of starting material.<br>
The mixture was heated in a 60 degrees C oil bath for 2 hour. The mixture was<br>
concentrated, diluted with H2O, and acidified to pH 2-4 using 1 M HCI. The aqueous<br>
phase was extracted with EtOAc and the organic phase was washed with brine, dried<br>

Step 1: A mixture of methyM-iodobenzoate (5.3g, 20.2 mmol), allyt alcohol<br>
(1.78g, 30.3 mmol), NaHCOj (4.24g, 50.5mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (0.14g, O.GOmmol), (n-<br>
Bu)4NBr (6.55g, 20.2 mmol) and 4-A molecular Sieves (4.1g) in anhydrous DMF<br>
(69mL) was stirred at room temperature for 4 days. The reaction mixture was filtered<br>
through celite and the filtrate poured onto water and extracted with EtOAc. Organic<br>
layer was washed with brine, dried (Na2O-, and concentrated under vaccum. Rash<br>
chromatography (silica gel, 10-20 % EtOAc-hexanes) gave 2.11g (85% based on the<br>
recovered starting material) of the desired 4-(3-Oxo-propyl)-benzDic acid methyl ester<br>
as a clear oil.<br>
Step 2: To a solution of 5-chJoro-2-methylindole (0.86g, 5.2mmol) and 4-(3-<br>
Oxo-propyl)-benzoic acid methyl ester (1.0g, 5.2mmol) in methylene chloride (50mL),<br>
was added TFA (1.78g, 15.6mmol), followed by triethylsilane (1.81g, 15.6mmoJ). The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred overnight quenched with sat. NaHCO3 solution (50mL),<br>
and the organic layer was washed with sat NaHCOs solution, water, brine, and dried<br>
(Na2SO4). Solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was<br>
purified by flash column chromatography with 10-20% EtOAc/hexanes to yield the<br>
desired product in 94% (1.67g) yield.<br>
Stop 3: To a solution of the product from step 2 (1.66g, 4.86mmol) in DMF<br>
(20mL) was added NaH (60% in mineral oil, 0.24g, 5.83mmol) under N2 atmosphere.<br>
The mixture was stirred for 1h at room temperature, followed by the dropwise<br>
addition of benzhydryl bromide (1.8g, 7.29mmoO in DMF (5mL). This reaction mixture<br>
was stirred overnight at room temperature. Water (500mL) was added to reaction<br>
mixture, it was extracted with EtOAc, washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure to a brown syrup, which was purified by silica-<br>
gel chromatography using 10% EtOAc/hexanes as eluent to isolate 4 as a white solid<br>
in59%(1.47g)yield.<br>
Step 4: The product from above (1.46g, 2.87mmol) was dissolved in CCU<br>
(14.5mL), followed by the addition of NBS (1.02g, 5.73mmol) and benzoy) peroxide<br>
(2mg). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 1 h (until all the starting material<br>
disappeared). This mixture was cooled to room temperature, filtered and the solid<br>
was washed with CO*. The filtrate was evaporated to a brown residue, which was<br>
dissolved in acetone (40mL) and water (4mL), Ag-Oa (1.75g, 3.16mmo!) was then<br>
added to this solution and after being stirred overnight at room temperature, it was<br>
filtered through celite, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and<br>
water was added to the residue. It was extracted with EtOAc, washed with brine,<br>
dried (Na2SO4), and evaporated to a syrup, which was purified by 10%<br>
EtOAc/hexanes to isolate the 2-formyl indote (1.13g) in 75% yield. Alternatively the<br>
dibirmide from the reaction with NBS could be poured into DMSO (10-20%<br>
concentration by weight) and stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. When the<br>
reaction was deemed complete it was poured into water and the resulting precipitate<br>
was isolated by filtration, the cake was washed with water and dried to yield an<br>
essentially quantitative yield.<br>
Step 5: To a solution of the 2 formyl indote from above (0.52g, 1mmol) in<br>
CH3NO2 (6.2ml_) was added NR.OAC (0.077g, 1mmoQ, the mixture was heated to<br>
reflux for 1h, NI-UOAc (0.077g, 1mmoO was then added, heating at reflux was<br>
continued for an additional 1h, NH,Oac (0.077g, 1mmol) was added again and the<br>
heating continued for further 1h. The reaction mixture was allowed to attain room<br>
temperature, EtOAc (50mL) was added, followed by the addition of 10OmL water.<br>
The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc, and the combined organic layers were<br>
washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), and evaporated to a yellow foam, which was<br>
subjected to chromatographic purification using 10% EtOAc/hexanes as an eluent to<br>
yield 6 as a yellow foam in 68% yield (0.38g).<br>
Step 6: Zn(Hg) was made by adding HgCl2 (3.4g, 7.2 mmoO to a mixture of<br>
Zn-dust (34.68g, 530.35mmol) and 5% Hcl (38mL) in a 100mL beaker, this mixture<br>
was stirred vigorously for 10 min. Aqueous pHClse was decanted and added 38mL of<br>
5% HO again and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. Aqueous pHClse was decanted.<br>
This solid was added to the vinyl nitro compound 6 (15g, 26.57mmol) in THF<br>
(660mL) and cone. HCl (64.5mL). This mixture was stirred at room temperature for<br>
1h, then at reflux for 15 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature<br>
and filtered through cefite. Aq. NK.OH solution (200mL) was added to the filtrate,<br>
stirred for 15 min and THF was removed under reduced pressure. The aqueous<br>
layer was extracted with CH2Cl2, combined organic layer was washed with brine,<br>
dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to a brown foam, which was purified by column<br>
chromatography by eluting the column with CHCIs in the beginning to remove non-<br>
polar impurities then with 2% MeOH/CHCI3 to isolate the desired amine in 46% yield<br>
(6.1g)<br>
Step 7: To the amine(1.0 equiv.) and sat. NaHCO3 (0.14 M) in CHClO2 (0.07<br>
M) was added a-toluenesulfonyf chloride (1.0 equiv.). After 1 h the mixture was<br>
poured into saturated sodium bicarbonate and extracted with CH2CI2. The combined<br>
organic pHClse was washed with brine, dried over sodium suffate and purified by<br>
column chromatography to afford 84% of the desired product<br>
Step 8: The resulting ester was hydrolyzed by stirring with 1N NaOH (5<br>
equiv.) in THF (0.07 M) and enough MeOH to produce a clear solution. The reaction<br>
was monitored by TLC (10% MeOH-CH2Cl2 for the disappearance of starting<br>
material. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and then,<br>
concentrated, diluted with HCl and acidified to pH 2-4 using 1 M HCI. The aqueous<br>
pHClse was extracted with EtOAc and the organic pHClse was washed with brine, dried<br>
over sodium sulfate, and concentrated to afford the desired product in 100 % yield.<br>

The substituted nitro aromatic was treated with ethyl oxalate in the presence<br>
of potassium or sodium in an alcoholic solvent The resulting oxalate ester was<br>
treated with a suitable reducing agent, such as iron powder, and the resulting amine<br>
cyclized to the indole under the reaction conditions. The carboxytate was next<br>
reduced with any of a variety of reducing agents, lithium aluminum hydride, dibal etc<br>
and the resulting alcohol was oxidized using reagents such as manganese dioxide,<br>
Swem condition NMO/TPAP etc. This 2 formyl indote was next alkylated by treatment<br>
with a strong base such as Na/KHMDS, NaH, etc and then alkylated with a suitable<br>
Halide. The aldehyde was next treated with nitrometHane and a base such as<br>
ammonium acetate to yield a vinyl nitro intermednte tHat could be reduced by a<br>
variety of agents such as Lithium Aluminum Hydride or Zn(Hg) amalgam in HCI. The<br>
resulting amine was sulfonylated using a sutfonyl chloride either under bipHasic<br>
Schott and Baummen conditions or anhydrous conditions with an organic base. This<br>
intermediate could be reductively alkylated at C3 using an aldehyde or an acetal<br>
under the action of a Bronsted or Lewis acid such as trifluoroacetic acid and a<br>
reducing agent such as triethylsilane. The resulting intermediate was hydroJyzed<br>
using a base, NaOH, KOH, LiOH and a mixture of solvents including an alcoholic<br>
solvent, water and tetrahydrofuran. The following Examples 105-107 were<br>
synthesized using Method E.<br>
Example 105:4-2-{1-Benzhydryl-6-chloro-2-(2-<br>
phenytmetHanesulfbnylainino-ethyl) -1H-indol-3-yl]-ethoxy}-benzolc acid<br>
Step 1: To potassium (6.24 g) in ether at rt were added etHanoJ (40mL. in 100<br>
mL ether), diethyl oxalate (27.85g, in 60 mL ether), and 4-chloro-2-nitrotoluene On 40<br>
mL ether). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 15h and followed by sonication<br>
for 7h before pouring onto cold 1N HCI. After neutralization, the aqueous layer was<br>
extracted with EtOAc and the combined organic layers were washed with brine and<br>
dried. After evaporation, the crude 3-(4-Chlofc)-2-nitro-pnenyI)-2-oxo-propionic acid<br>
ethyl ester was used directly in the next step without further purification.<br>
Step 2: To crude 3-4-loro-2-riitrD-phenyl)-2-xo-propionic acid ethyl ester<br>
(151 mmol) in etHanol:glacial HOAc (1:1, v/v, 560 mL) at rt was added iron powder<br>
(74.4g) and the reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 4h. The mixture was filtered<br>
and evaporated to give a residue which was redistributed in dichlorometHane/1N HCI.<br>
The organic layer was washed with 1N HCI, NaHCOj, and brine and dried.<br>
Evaporation followed by crystallization (DCM) gave 6-Chlon)1H-indole-2-carboxylic<br>
acid ethyl ester as a pale yellow solid (16.8 g, 50 % over 2 steps).<br>
Step 3: To 6-chloro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (8.57g) in THF at 0<br>
*C was added lithium aluminum hydride solution (1M, in THF) dropwise and the<br>
reaction mixture was stirred for 3.5h. The mixture was quenched with H20,15%<br>
NaOH, and H2O before it was filtered and rinsed with THF. Evaporation of the<br>
solvent gave 7.77 g of the crude (6-(-loro-1H-incloK2-yl)-metHanol which was used<br>
directly in the next step.<br>
Step 4: To (6-chloro-1H-indol-2-yl)-metHanol (37.7 mmol) in THF at 0ยฐC was<br>
added manganese (IV) oxide and the mixture was stirred at rt for 16h. The mixture<br>
was tittered over ceite and rinsed with THF and EtOAc and evaporated to near<br>
dryness. The solid was filtered and washed with cold EtOAc/hex to give 6-Chloro-<br>
1H-indole-2-carbaldehyde (62%, 2 steps).<br>
Step 5: To 6-chloro-1H-indote-2-carbaldehyde (1 equiv.) in DMF at 0ยฐC was<br>
added NaH (1.25 equiv.) portionwise followed by benzhydryl bromide (1.46 equiv.)<br>
and B114NI (0.05equiv.). The mixture was stirred at rt for 42h before quenching with<br>
cold 0.4N HCL at 0 *C. After neutralization, the aqueous layer was extracted with<br>
ether and the organic layer was washed with cold H2O and dried. Flash<br>
chromatography on silica gel gave 14-benzhydryl-6-(chloro-1H-indole-2-carbaldehyde<br>
in 40% yield.<br>
Step 6: A solution of 1-benzhydryl-6-chloro-1H-indole-2-carbaldehyde (0.5M,<br>
1 equiv.) and NH4OAC (1 equiv.) in nitrometHane was heated at 95 .C for 70 min. The<br>
mixture was diluted with EtOAc, washed with water, and dried. Evaporation of the<br>
volatiles, followed by trituration with ether/hexane produced 1-Benzhydryl-6-chloro-2-<br>
(2-nitro-vinyl)-1 H-indote in 48% yield.<br>
Step 7: To lithium aluminum hydride (1M in THF, 4 equiv.) in THF at O'C was<br>
added 1-ben2ydryl-6-chloro-2-(2-nitro-viny1)-1H-indole (0.1M, 1 equiv.) dropwise and<br>
the reaction mixture was stirred for 2h. The mixture was quenched with H20,15 %<br>
NaOH, and H2O, filtered through celtte and rinsed with EtOAc. After evaporation, the<br>
residue was purified by column chromatography to generate 2-(1-Benzhydryl-6-<br>
chloro-1H-indol-2-yl)-ethylamine in 40 % yield.<br>
Step 8: To 2-1-Benzhydryl-6-(-kxo-1H-indo(-2-yl)-ethyiamine was added<br>
phenylmetHanesulfonyl chloride according to the procedure in Example 1 Step 7 to<br>
generate -N-[2-1-Benzhydryl-6-chloro-1H-indol)-1H-indol-2-yl-)-ethyl]-C-phenyl-<br>

Method J provides an alternative reaction scheme to a subset of the<br>
compounds contained in this document A suitably substituted aniline is Halogenated<br>
using ICI. l2, or Br2 and then the amine is protected as a carbamate, using for<br>
example triethylamine and a chtorofbrmate. This aryt Halide is coupled to a suitably<br>
functionalized alkyne under the reaction of Pd and copper catalysis in the presence<br>
of a base such as triethylamine. This resulting product could be cyclized using Pd<br>
catalysis in the presence of allyl chloride and a substituted oxirane. The indde<br>
nitrogen may then be alkylated by treatment with a strong base such as sodium<br>
bis(trimethyteilyl)amidep n-BuU, sodium hydride or potassium hydride in a solvent<br>
such as DMF, DMSO or THF followed by exposure to the appropriate Halide. The<br>
allyl indote could then be treated with 9-BBN and then a palladium catalyst followed<br>
by an aryl or vinyl iodide to effect a Suzuki coupling reaction. The resulting<br>
intermediate could be deprotected usiong a hydrazine or an alkyl amine to yield the<br>
primary amine. This amine could then be treated with the requisite sulfonyl chloride<br>
under bipHasic conditions, aqueous sodium bicarbonate/dichlorometHane, or in<br>
organic solvent with the addition of a hindered organic amine base. The final<br>
hydrolysis was accomplished under basic conditions with sodium hydroxide in water<br>
and metHanol and THF at room temperature or at elevated temperature. Alternatively<br>
it may be cleaved by treatment with sodium thiomethoxkJe in a solvent such as THF<br>
or DMF at elevated temperatures (50 'C -100 'C).<br>
Method K provides an alternative method to prepare compounds of this<br>
invention. A suitably substituted aniline is Halogenated using ICI. l2. or Br2 and then<br>
the amine is protected as a carbamate or amide .using for example trifluoroacetic<br>
anhydride triethyamine and dimethylamino pyridine. This intermediate is then reacted<br>
with a suitably functionalized alkyne under palladium and copper catalysis in the<br>
presence of a base. The resulting aryl alkyne is cyclized to the indole by heating with<br>
an amine such as piperidine. Standard Mitsunobu reaction conditions, a phosphine,<br>
an azodicarboxylate and phtHalamide are used to generate the protected amine. The<br>
indote may be alkylated at the C3 position (the indote 3-position carbon atom) with<br>
aldehydes or the corresponding acetate in the presence of a Lewis or Bronsted acid,<br>
such as boron triflouride etherate or trifluoroacetic add. The indole nitrogen may then<br>
be alkyiated by treatment with a strong base such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide,<br>
n-BuLi, sodium hydride or potassium hydride in a solvent such as DMF, DMSO or<br>
THF followed by exposure to the appropriate Halide. The resulting intermediate could<br>
be deprotected usiong a hydrazine or an alkyl amine to yield the primary amine. This<br>
amine could then be treated with the requisite sutfonyl chloride under DipHasic<br>
conditions, aqueous sodium bicarbonate/dichlorometHane, or in organic solvent with<br>
the addition of a hindered organic amine base. The final hydrolysis was<br>
accomplished under basic conditions with sodium hydroxide in water and metHanol<br>
and THF at room temperature or at elevated temperature. Alternatively it may be<br>
cleaved by treatment with sodium thiomethoxide in a solvent such as THF or DMF at<br>
elevated temperatures (50'C -100 *C).<br>
Method L provides another alternative method to prepare compounds of this<br>
invention. A suitably substituted Halo aniline, see methods J and K, and a symmetric<br>
alkynol or a monoprotected alkynol, for example THP protection, are reacted in the<br>
presence of a base, copper and palladium catalysis, followed by deprotection under<br>
acidic conditions if a monoprotected substrate is used yielded the symmetrical indole<br>
did. The diol is desymmetrized by treatment with carbonyl diimidazoJe in a suitable<br>
solvent and then the primary alcohol was substituted under standard Mitsunobu<br>
conditions, a phosphine, an azodicarboxylate and an alcohol were used to generated<br>
the desired ether. The carbamate could be opened up by reaction with sodium azide<br>
to yield the alkyl azide. The indole nitrogen may then be alkylated by treatment with a<br>
strong base such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, n-BuLi, sodium hydride or<br>
potassium hydride in a solvent such as DMF. DMSO or THF followed by exposure to<br>
the appropriate Halide. Treatment with triphenyl phosphine in wet THf delivered the<br>
desired alkyl amine. This amine could then be treated with the requisite sulfonyl<br>
chloride under bipHasic conditions, aqueous sodium bicarbonate/dichlorometHane, or<br>
in organic solvent with the addition of a hindered organic amine base. The final<br>
hydrolysis was accomplished under basic conditions with sodium hydroxide in water<br>
and metHanoi and THF at room temperature or at elevated temperature. Alternatively<br>
it may be cleaved by treatment with sodium thiomethoxide in a solvent such as THF<br>
or DMF at elevated temperatures (50 'C -100 *C).<br>
Method M provides a further strategy to furnish compounds of this invention.<br>
A suitably substituted aniline is Halogenated using ICI, l2, or Br2 and then the amine<br>
can be alkylated using an organic base and a Halide. The thus formed alkyl amine is<br>
 then reacted under palladium catalyzed conditions in the presence of a chloride<br>
source a base and with or without a phsophine and the requisite alkyne to yield the<br>
indole. When the Z in the alkyne is NHSO2CH2)n2X1R1 the synthesis is finished by<br>
hydrolysis under basic conditions with sodium hydroxide in water and methanol and<br>
THF at room temperature or at elevated temperature. Alternatively ft may be cleaved<br>
 by treatment with sodium thiomethoxide in a solvent such as THF or DMF at elevated<br>
temperatures (50 *C -100 *C).<br>
When Z=NH2<br>
The resulting indole can then be treated with the requisite suffonyf chloride<br>
 under DipHasic conditions, aqueous sodium bicarbonate/dichlorometHane, or in<br>
organic solvent with the addition of a hindered organic amine base. The final<br>
hydrolysis was accomplished under basic conditions with sodium hydroxide in water<br>
and metHanol and THF at room temperature or at elevated temperature. Alternatively<br>
it may be cleaved by treatment with sodium thiomethoxide in a solvent such as THF<br>
 or DMF at elevated temperatures (50'C-100 *C).<br>
When Z=OH<br>
The resulting alcohol could be converted to a Halide or mesylate, for example<br>
using metHane sulfonyi chloride and an organic base, which could then be displaced<br>
 by sodium azide in OMF.The resulting alkyl azide could be reduced under the action<br>
of triphenyl phosphine and wet THF. The amine could be sulfonylated by the action<br>
of a sulfonyi chloride under either bipHasic Sncott and Baumman conditions, Aq.<br>
Bicarbonate and dichlorometHane, or under anhydrous conditions consisting of<br>
dichlorometHane and an organic base such as Hunigs base. The resulting<br>
intermediate was hydrolyzed using a base, NaOH, KOH, LiOH and a mixture of<br>
solvents including an alcoholic solvent, water and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Method N provides a further strategy to furnish a subset of the compounds of<br>
this invention. The C3 functionalized-2-formyl indole (See method A) was reacted<br>
under Wittig, or other organometalfic conditions, to generate an alkeneoate ester.<br>
This ester could be converted to the acid by treatment with Pd and the resulting<br>
unsaturated acid was reduced via hydrogenation. The alkyl add was activated by<br>
conversion to the acid chloride, under the action of oxalyf chloride, or the acid<br>
flouride, via cyanuric flouride, and then treated with a suitable borohydride reducing<br>
agent to generate the alcohol. The alcohol was converted to the bromide using<br>
triphenyl phosphine and carbontetrabromide and then displaced by the anion of the<br>
sulfonmide, generated by treating the primary sulfonamide with a strong base, such<br>
as NaH, n-BuLi etc, to yield the desired secondary sulfonamide. The resulting ester<br>
intermediate was hydroryzed using a base, NaOH, KOH, UOH and a mixture of<br>
solvents including an alcoholic solvent, water and tetrahydrofuran.<br>

acid methyl ester, Step 4,Example 1, (.0092M, 1.0eq.) and 5.0g of<br>
allyl(triphenylphosphoranylidene) acetate (.0139M, 1.5eq.) were dissolved in 250mL<br>
of tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. The pale yellow solution was stirred for one<br>
hour. TLC indicated a new spot at DRf of +0.5 in 1:1 hexanes/ ethyl acetate and no<br>
remaining starting indole. The reaction was poured into 500mL of ethyl acetate and<br>
washed with water (2X125mL) and brine (2X125mL). The organic layer was dried<br>
over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to a yellow oil which<br>
was dissolved in 50ml 1:1 hexanes/ ethyl acetate and filtered through a plug of silica<br>
gel to remove baseline material. This left 5.23g of 4-{2-{2-(2-Allyloxycarbonyl-vinyl)-1-<br>
benzhydryl-5-chiorc)-1H-indol-3-yl]-ethoxy}-benzoic acid methyl ester as a yellow oil<br>

tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) (.001M, 0.1eq.) were added to 75mL of<br>
THF. To the reaction 8.60ml of morpholine (0.098M, 1eq.) was added drop-wise over<br>
20 min. After addition was complete the reaction was stirred at room temperature for<br>
4 hours. The reaction was poured into 250mL of ethyl acetate and the organic<br>
solution was extracted with 1N NaOH (2X75mL). The aqueous layers were combined<br>
and acidified with 1N HCI, the acidic solution was extracted with ethyl acetate<br>
(3X75mL). The organic layers were combined and washed with brine (1X50mL),<br>
dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to yield 4-{2-{1-Benzhydryl-2-<br>
(2(arboxy-myl)-5(hloro-1H-indol-3-yl]-ethoxyH)enzoic add methyl ester as a<br>
yellow oil (5.40g, 97% yield).<br>

yl]-ethoxy}-benzoic acid methyl ester ( .0007M, 1eq.) was dissolved in 15mL of<br>
metHanol. To the solution, 80mg of 5% platinum on activated carbon was added as a<br>
slurry in 5mL of metHanol. The black suspension was placed under a hydrogen<br>
atmosphere via a balloon and stirred for 24 hrs. at room temperature. The hydrogen<br>
was evacuated and another 80mg of 5% platinum on activated carbon in 5mL of<br>
metHanol was added and the reaction was again placed under a hydrogen<br>
atmosphere via a balloon and stirred for another 24 hrs. at room temperature. The<br>
reaction was monitored via NMR and at this point complete conversion was<br>
indicated. The reaction was filtered through CeIHe and the filtrate was evaporated to<br>
give 4-{2-[1-Benzhydryl-2-2-carboxy-ethyl-5-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl]-ethoxy}-benzaoic<br>
add methyl ester as a yetow-green solid (320mg, 79% yield).<br>
Step 4: 100mg of 4-2H1-Bennzhydryl-2-[2-carboxy-ethyl)-5-chloro-1H-indol-3-<br>
yl]-ethoxy}-benzoic add methyl ester (.0002M, 1eq.) was dissolved in 1.0ml of<br>
anhydrous methylene chloride. To the solution 33.5mg of oxalyl chloride (.0003M,<br>
1.5eq.) was added and the reaction stirred for one hour at room temperature. The<br>
reaction was then evaporated to dryness and the residue dissolved in LOrnL of<br>
anhydrous ethyl ether to which .027mL of TMEDA was added. To this solution 0.35<br>
mL of zinc borohydride solution in ether prepared by the literature method( Tet Lett.<br>
Vol. 22, pg.4723, 1981) was added. The reaction was stirred for 15 min. at room<br>
temperature and quenched with 1.0mL of water. The reaction was diluted with 10mL<br>
of ethyl ether and the water layer separated, the organic layer was dried over<br>
magnesium sutfate, filtered and evaporated to a clear oil. The oil was<br>
chromatographed with ethyl acetate/ hexanes (1:9) to result in isolation of 4-{2-{1-<br>
Bennzhydry-5-chloro-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-ethoxy}-benzoic acid methyl<br>
ester as a white foam (81 mg, 83% yield).<br>
Step 6: 104.0mg of 4-241-Ben2hydryl-5-chloro-2-{3-hydroxy-pfopyl)-1H-<br>
indol-3-yl}-ethoxy}-benzoic acid methyl ester (.0002M, 1.0eq.) was dissolved in<br>
2.0mL of anhydrous methytene chloride. To the solution 116.0mg of polystyrene<br>
bound triphenylphosphine was added ( 1.61mmol/g, .0002M, 1.0eq.) followed by<br>
125.0mg of carbon tetrabromide (.0004M, 2eq.). The suspension was stirred for 2hrs<br>
at room temperature at which point the reaction was filtered and the filtrate<br>
evaporated to an orange oil. The oil was purified via column chromatography with<br>
ethyl acetate/ hexanes (2:98) to give 100mg (88%) of 4-(2-{1-benzhydryl-2-(3-bromo-<br>
propyf)5H-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl]-ethoxy}-benzoic acid methyl ester title as a yelow<br>
foam.<br>
Step 6: 33.3mg of a-toluene sulfonamide (.0002M, 1.2eq.) was dissolved in<br>
0.5mL of DMF and added to a slurry of 8.0mg of 60% sodium hydride ( .0002M,<br>
1.2eq.) in 0.5mL of DMF. The reaction was stirred for 30 min. at which point 100 mg<br>
of 4K2-[1-Benzhydrye-3-Drorno-propyl)-5-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl]ethoxy}-benzoic acid<br>
methyl ester (.0002M, 1.0eq.) in 0.6mL of DMF was added and the solution was<br>
stirred for an additional 1 hour. The reaction was quenched with water and diluted<br>
with 10mL of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water(2X5mL) and<br>
brine (2X5mL), dried over magnesium sutfate and evaporated to a yellow oil. The<br>
residue was purified via column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexanes 5:95) to give<br>
20mg (17%) of 4--1-Benzhydryl-5(hloro-2-3-phenylmetHanesulfonylamino-<br>
propyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-ethoxy}-benzoicacid methyl ester as a clear oil.<br>
Step 7: 20.0mg of indole from Example 6 (.00002M, 1eq.) was hydrolyzed as<br>
in Example 1 Step 8 to yield the title compound (13.0mg, 88 % yield) m/z (M-1) 691.<br>
The appropriately substituted Halo amine is reacted with a suitable Halide and<br>
a tertiary amine base to yield an N-alkylated substrate for a Shonigishiru coupling<br>
(with an alkynoJ in the presence of Pd" and a suitable base). This arylalkynol is<br>
cyclized to the indole under the action of a copper Haiide and heat The free alcohol<br>
was protected with a silyl protecting group by reaction with a silyl chloride in the<br>
presence of a base such as imidazole. This indole was next C3 acylated by reaction<br>
with a suitable acid chloride and the resulting compound reduced with most reducing<br>
agents but preferably borane or a borane complex The primary alcohol was then<br>
oxidized to an aldehyde by any number of oxlidizing agents, including oxalyl<br>
chloride/DMSO (swem conditions) or TPAP/NMO. This aldehyde was subjected to<br>
reductive amination conditions, which include a borohydride reducing agent and in<br>
some cases a protice acid, and a primary or secondary amine. The silyl ether was<br>
then deprotected with a flouride source including CsF, TBAF, HF etc. This free<br>
alcohol was converted into a leaving group, Halide with CBr4 and a phosphine, or a<br>
sulfbnate ester with metHane sulfbnyi chloride and a tertiary amine. The activated<br>
alcohol is reacted with sodium azide in either DMF or DMSO to yield the desired<br>
azide which in turn was reduced under Staudinger conditions, phosphine and<br>
THF/H2O, or via hydrogenation using hydrogen and a suitable catalyst The amine<br>
could be sutfonylated by the action of a sulfonyl chloride under either DipHasic Shcott<br>
and Baumman conditions, Aq. Bicarbonate and dichlorometHane, or under<br>
anhydrous conditions consisting of dichlorometHane and an organic base such as<br>
Hunigs base. The resulting intermediate was hydroryzed using a base, NaOH, KOH,<br>
LiOH and a mixture of solvents including an alcoholic solvent, water and<br>
tetrahydrofuran.<br>

the volatile was removed under reduced pressure, the residue was dissolved in<br>
EtOAc, washed with water (3x) and brine and dried over MgSO4. Purification on SiO2<br>
column chromoatography (hexanes to 5% EtOAc/hexanes) gave the desired<br>
Benzhydryl-(4(hloro-2-kxlo-phenyl)-amine (26.1 g, 97% yield) as a yellowish solid.<br>

Et3N (120 mL) was stirred at 45 *C for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered<br>
through cefite and rinsed with EtOAc. The filtrate was concentrated, redissolved in<br>
EtQAc, washed with water (3x) and brine, and dried over MgSO4. The crude 4-{2-<br>

for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite and rinsed with EtOAc.<br>
The filtrate was concentrated, redissolved in EtOAc, washed with water (3x) and<br>
brine, and dried over MgSO4. Silica gel column chromatography (30%<br>
EtOAc/hexanes) yielded the desired 2-(1-Benzhydryl-5-chlon)1HHndol-2-yl)etHanol<br>

and TBDPSCI (13.2 mL, 50.8 mmot). After stirring at the same temperature for 1.5<br>
hours, the reaction mixture was washed with cold water (3x) and brine, and dried<br>
over MgSO4. The crude silyl ether was used in the next step directly without further<br>
purification.<br>
Step 5: To a solution of the crude silyl ether in EfeO (200 mL) at 0 ยฐC was<br>
added oxalyl chloride (4.84 mL, 55.5 mmol) dropwise. The reaction mixture was<br>
allowed to warm to rt and stirring continued for 4 hours before Et3N (35 mL) and<br>
MeOH (10 mL) were added. The mixture was washed with water, brine, and dried<br>
over MgSO4. The crude keto ester was used directly in the next step.<br>
Step 6: To the keto ester in THF (300 mL) was added BH8.MeaS (10 M, 36<br>
mL) dropwise at rt and the reaction mixture was refluxed overnight. The mixture was<br>
cooled at 0 *C before NaOH (30%, 150 mL) was added and stirring continued for 30<br>
min. THF was removed under reduced pressure and the reaction mixture was<br>
extracted with EtOAc, washed with water, brine, and dried over MgSO(. Purification<br>
on column chromatography (15 to 20% EtOAc/hexanes) yielded the desired product<br>
as a white solid (15.9 g, 24.7 mmol, 58% over 3 steps).<br>
Step 7: To a solution of oxalyl chloride (0.372 mL, 4.27 mmol) in<br>
CH2CI2 (10 mL) at -78 ยฐC was added DMSO (0.661 mL, 9.31 mmol) dropwise. The<br>

Activity Assay<br>
Coumarine Assay<br>
7-hydroxycoumarinyl 6-heptenoate was used as a monomeric substrate for<br>
CPLA2 as reported previously (Huang, Z. et al., 1994, Natytical Biochemistry 222,<br>
110-115). Inhibitors were mixed with 200 uL assay buffer (80 mM Heped, pH 7.5.1<br>
mM EDTA) containing 60 uM 7-hydroxycoumarinyl 6-heptenoate. The reaction was<br>
initiated by aciding 4 ug cPLA2 in 50 uL assay buffer. Hydrolysis of the 7-<br>
hydroxycounarimyl 6-heptenoate ester was monitored in a fluorometer by exciting at<br>
360 nm and monitoring emission at 460 nm. Enzyme activity is proportional to the<br>
increase in emission at 460 nm per minute. In the presence of a cPLA2 inhibitor, the<br>
rate of increase is less.<br>
The compounds of the Invention Inhibit cPLA2 activity tHat is required for<br>
supplying arachidonic acid substrate to cyclooxygenase -1 or 2 and 5-iipoxygenase,<br>
which in turn initiate the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes respectively.<br>
In acidition, cPLA2 activity is essential for producing the lyso-phospholipid tHat is the<br>
precursor to PAF. Thus these compounds are useful in the treatment and<br>
prevention of disease states in which leukotrienes, prostaglandins or PAF are<br>
involved. Moreover, in diseases where more tHan one of these agents plays a role, a<br>
cPLA2 inhibitor would be expected to be more efficacious tHan leukotriene,<br>
prostagiandin or PAF receptor antagonists and also more effective tHan<br>
cyclooxygenase or 5-iipoxygenase inhibitors.<br>
Therefore, the compounds, pHarmaceutical compositions and regimens of the<br>
present invention are useful in treating and preventing the disorders treated by<br>
cydooxygenase-2, cydoxygenase-1, and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and also<br>
antagonists of the receptors for PAF, leukotrienes or prostaglandins. Diseases<br>
treatable by compounds of this invention include but are not limited to: pulmonary<br>
disorders including diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and related<br>
obstructive airway diseases; allergies and allergic reactions such as allergic rhinitis,<br>
contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and the like; inflammation such as arthritis<br>
or inflammatory bowel diseases, skin disorders such as psoriasis, atopic eczema,<br>
acne, UV damage, bums and dermatittis; cardiovascular disorders such as<br>
atherosclerosis, angina, myl]cardial iscHaemia, hypertension, platelet aggregation,<br>
and the like; and renal insufficiency induced by immunological or chemical. The<br>
drugs may also be cytoprotective, preventing damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa<br>
by noxious agents. The compounds will also be useful in the treatment of adult<br>
respiratory distress syl]drome, endotoxin shock and ischeamia induced injury<br>
including myl]cardial or brain injury.<br>
The methods of treatment, inhibition, alleviation or relief of asthma of this<br>
invention include those for Extrinsic Asthma (also known as Allergic Asthma or Atopic<br>
Asthma), Intrinsic Asthma (also known as Nonallergic Asthma or Nonatopic Asthma)<br>
or combinations of both, which Has been referred to as Mixed Asthma. The methods<br>
for those experiencing or subject to Extrinsic or Allergic Asthma include incidents<br>
caused by or associated with many allergens, such as pollens, spores, grasses or<br>
weeds, pet danders, dust, mites, etc. As allergens and other irritants present<br>
themselves at varying points over the year, these types of incidents are also referred<br>
to as Seasonal Asthma. Also included in the group of Extrinsic Asthmas is bronchial<br>
asthmas and allergic bronchopufminary aspergillosis.<br>
Intrinsic Asthmas tHat may be treated or alleviated by the present methods<br>
include those caused by infectious agents, such as cold and flu viruses in adults and<br>
respiratory syl]cytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus and influenza viruses common in<br>
children. Also included are the asthma conditions which may be brought about in<br>
some asthmatics by exercise and/or cold air. The methods are useful for Intrinsic<br>
Asthmas associated with industrial and occupational exposures, such as smoke,<br>
