				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of nitroarenes with high para-selectivity from monosubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons using aluminosilicates as catalysts.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a process for nitration of monosubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons using aluminosilicate catalysts as solid acids dispensing the use of H2SO4 which totally eliminates disposal of salts formed consequent to the neutralisation of sulfuric acid. The production of p-nitroaromatics with enhanced selectivity over the o-nitroproducts which is described here is prompted by market driven research, since the p-isomers are in greater demand.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an improved selectivity of p-isomers over o-isomers offers simplification of the process for the separation of isomers.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an improved ecofriendly process, which minimises effluents, and requires very small amount of water for washings, is non-corrosive in nature, in contrast to the process practised currently in industry with sulfuric acid.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an improved and cost effective process with enhanced selectivity of p- isomers over conventional sulfuric acid process currently under practice in industry, employing small amount of catalyst with reusability demonstrated for number of cycles.<br>
Nitration process is used for the production of many large-volume chemicals such as nitrotoluenes, nitrochlorobenzenes and other nitroarenes which are vital intermediates for dyes, Pharmaceuticals, perfumes and pesticides. Nitration of arenes is performed<br>
classically with a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids. One of the major disadvantages of this method is formation of by-products of polynitration and also causing environmental pollution during disposal of spent acid.<br>
Reference may be made to a US patent (U.S. patent 4, 418,230 November 1983) wherein a method for nitration of toluene with HNOs and H2S04 at 0 - 50 °C is described (o:m:p 55 : 2.3 : 38.9). The drawbacks are the use of sulfuric acid and also the formation of more of o-isomer.<br>
Reference may be made to another US patent (U.S. 1, 12, 006 September 5) wherein a process for nitration of toluene with HNO3 and 10% H2S04 impregnated A12O3 and 1% Mo at 135-145°C/20 Torr is described (o:m:p 34.0 : 3.5: 62.5). The drawbacks are using of sulfuric acid in the preparation of the catalyst and the catalyst gets deactivated on each cycle.<br>
Although it has been known for some time that benzene and its homologs can be nitrated with HNO3 alone without using sulfuric acid, little or no progress has been made in this direction on commercial scale. The disadvantage in this method is the low productivity and the use of large excess of nitric acid (molar ratio of nitric acid to benzene is 2:1 to 4:1) which increase the possibility of poly-nitro compounds formation and affect the economics of the project. Recently attention has been focused on the development of environmentally friendly solid acid catalysts such as Nafion especially in Friedel-Crafts reactions to replace environmentally hazardous chemical, sulfuric acid in nitration reactions.<br>
Reference may be made to a US patent (U.S., 4,234,470; 18 November, 1980) wherein a method for nitration of benzene, chlorobenzene and toluene with HNO3 in presence of Nafion catalyst is described. The drawbacks are the use of expensive Nafion resin whose activity is decreasing on each cycle and offers nearly identical isomeric selectivity (o:m:p 56 : 4 : 40) as that of mixed acid.<br>
Reference may also be made to a Japanese patent (Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 63, 303, 957, June, 1987) wherein a process for vapour phase nitration of halobenzenes with HNO3 and aluminosilicates at 175 °C and space velocity 2.2 h-1 (nitration of chlorobenzene isomeric ratio: o:m:p 14.5 : 1.7 : 83.8) is described. The draw backs are that the reactions are carried in vapour phase conditions. Reference may also be made to an Indian patent (Appl., NS90/97 2937 Del 97 October 1997) and an European patent (Appl., 98302258. 3-1521, 25th March 1998) wherein a process for the production of nitroarenes from arenes with fuming HNO3 in presence of exchanged clays as catalysts is described. The draw backs are that this invention does not significantly alter isomeric composition of disubstituted benzenes.<br>
Reference may also be made to a publication (Chem.Commun, 469, 1996) wherein benzene, alkylbenzenes and halobenzenes are nitrated in quantitative yields and with high  para-selectivity in a solvent free process by use of a stoichiometric quantity of nitric acid and acetic anhydride at 0-20°C in the presence of zeolite beta as a recyclable catalyst. Reference may be also made to a publication (Catal.Lett, 255, 1997) wherein halobenzenes are nitrated in quantitative yields and with high /wa-selectivity in CCU solvent by using stoichiometric quantities of nitric acid and acetic anhydride at room<br>
temperature and 70°C in the presence of sulphated zirconica (SO42-/ZrO2) as catalyst. Reference may also be made to publication (J. Mol. Catal., 87, 33, 1994) wherein halobenzenes are nitrated in good yields and with high para-selectivity in CC14 solvent by use of a stoichiometric quantity of nitric acid and acetic anhydride at room temperature to 80°C in the presence of Fe3+-montmorillonite catalyst. The draw backs are the use of expensive acetic anhydride in all the above processes which is uneconomical and also exothermic and explosive nature of the reaction of acetic anhydride and nitric acid.<br>
Reference may also be made to a publication (Chem. Commun., 613, 1997) wherein aromatics are nitrated in good yields in dichloroethane solvent by using stoichiometric quantities of 69% nitric acid at reflux temperature of solvent in the presence of lanthanide(III) triflates as recyclable catalysts. The draw backs are the reaction is slow and takes more time for completion of the reaction, the use of expensive catalyst and the process will be of low productivity. The isomeric ratio is also identical with that of mixed acids.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of nitroarenes with high para-selectivity from monosubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons using aluminosilicates as catalysts which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is the use of ecofriendly modified aluminosilicates as solid acid catalysts in the nitration of monosubstituted arenes dispensing the use of sulruric acid which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to dispense the use of acetic anhydride which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of nitroarenes with high para selectivity from monosubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons using aluminosilicate as catalysts, which comprises nitration of monosubstiututed aromatic hydrocarbons using beta zeolite of different si/al ratio ranging between 5 to 1000 as catalyst with nitric acid in the molar ratio of 0.25 to 2.5 at a temperature ranging between 30-1600c for a period ranging between 0.25 to 3.0 h and followed by continuous removal of water formed from the reaction mixture with a dean-stark apparatus and recovery of the product mixture by concentration of the reaction mixture after separation of the catalyst by filtration.<br>
In   an   embodiment   of  the   present   invention,   the   catalysts   used   are<br>
aluminosilicates.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention   Si /Al ratio varies from 5 to<br>
1000 in the synthesis of various aluminosilicates . The type of zeolite and Si /Al ratio is<br>
critical in achieving high para-selectivity.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention nitric acid was used as the<br>
nitrating agent and the molar ratio of nitric acid to aromatics should normally be in the<br>
range from 0.5 to 2.5.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, nitric acid was used as<br>
the nitrating agent and the scale of the reaction conducted ranges from 4000 mmol to 10<br>
mmol per batch.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, nitric acid was used as the nitrating agent should normally be in the concentration range from 50 to 90%(w/v) desirably 60 to 70%.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention monosubstituted benzenes used are selected from toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, anisole, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the catalysts used are aluminosilicates selected from zeolite beta, K-10 montmorillonite, ZSM-5, Mordenite, TS-1 and HY zeolite.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, zeolite Beta is preferred as the catalyst used with Si/Al ratio ranging between 15-22 to obtain high para selectivity.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, nitration is effected at a temperature in the range of 30 to 160° C.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention reaction time of nitration is effected in between 0.25 to 3.0 h.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the product ratio for ortho : meta : para ranges from 29.4 : 2.3 : 65.7 to 5.4 : 6.5 : 36.4 depending upon the catalyst used.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the product ratio for ortho : meta : para ranges from 13 : 0 : 87 to 25 : 0 : 73 depending upon the substrate used.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the selectivity of the para-isomer increases with the increase of catalyst amount (for example p-nitrotoluene increases to 72-75%).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, selectivity of p-isomer increases to the extent of 5-10% with the increase of catalyst amount.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the use of aluminosilicates as solid catalysts dispenses the use of hazardous sulfuric acid.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the catalyst not only imparts high activity by the presence of acidic sites and high para-selectivity due to the restricted dimensional configuration of the catalysts.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the solid acid catalysts used here act as bifunctional catalysts, generating electrophile, nitronium ion as well as instant adsorbent for water formed during the reaction to facilitate electrophilic substitution on arenes.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention nitration is effected by continuous azeotropical removal of water present in the nitric acid and formed during the reaction with a Dean-Stark apparatus using the substrate as self solvent or chlorohydrocarbons as solvent to regenerate active sites of the catalyst generating nitronium ions.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention recovery of nitroarenes is carried out by separating the catalyst by filtration and removing the excess of unreacted arenes by distillation or by concentration in rotavapor<br>
Monosubstituted benzenes and the catalyst were taken in a two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with Dean-Stark apparatus. After the flask was heated to the required temperature, nitric acid was added dropwise into the reaction mixture over the required period. Simultaneously, the water collected in the the Dean-Stark apparatus formed from the reaction was removed continuously. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered and the reaction mixture was concentrated to obtain the mixture of nitrotoluenes. The monosubstituted benzenes used are selected from monosubstituted aromatics, preferably from toluene, anisole, ethylbenzene, cumene, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and iodobenzene and the amount used ranges from 4000 to 10 mmol. The molar ratio of nitric acid and aromatic should normally be in the range from 0.25 to 2.5, desirably 0.5 to 2.0. Nitration reaction temperature should normally be in the range from 30 to 190°C, desirably from 80 to 160°C. Nitration process was accomplished in a period of 0.25 to 5.0 h, preferably about 0.5 to 3.0 h.<br>
The principal object of the present invention by processing under the above conditions, therefore, was to produce cost effective predominantly para-selective product over the previously reported works. It was achieved because of the possible restricted pore sizes of the aluminosilicates used as solid acid catalysts and also the methodology<br>
used in this process. The other object of the present invention was achieved by using the aluminosilicates as solid acid catalysts replacing the hazardous sulfuric acid.<br>
The novelty of the present invention with respect to the prior art is to produce predominantly p-isomer in the nitration of aromatic hydrocarbons using solid acids as catalysts replacing liquid sulfuric acid employed in more than stoichiometric quantities. The selectivity is possible by the use of solid acids of compatible pore dimensions designed and modified to direct the electrophile, nitronium ion to substitute at the para-position in preference to ortho-position. Apart from generating nitronium ion by the alumino silicate catalyst, the process is engineered to drive away water formed in the reaction as well as present in the nitric acid by azeotropic distillation enables the easy access of acidic sites of solid catalysts for recycle and available in constant number resulting in high productivity with good p-selectivity.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
