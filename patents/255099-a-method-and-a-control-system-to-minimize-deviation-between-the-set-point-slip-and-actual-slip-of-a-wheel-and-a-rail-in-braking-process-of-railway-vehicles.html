ADAPTIVE ANTISKID MEANS FOR RAIT, VEHICLES WITH A SUP<br>
CONTROLLER<br>
The invention relates to a method for adapting the brake<br>
cylinder pressure of a pneumaic brake of a rail vehicle.<br>
The invention further relates to a slip controller for a rail<br>
vehicle for adapting the current slip to a predefined setpoint<br>
slip.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also relates to a control system<br>
comprising such a slip controller.<br>
The need for antiskid means in rail vehicles results from the<br>
risk of an axle suddenly and undesirably coming to a stop when<br>
a rail vehicle is being braked. In order to initiate the<br>
braking process, in pneumatic brake systems, a brake control<br>
pressure is applied to the pneumatic brake cylinders on each<br>
wheel axle. The braking torque TB which is applied in this way<br>
brings about a negative angular acceleration of the wheels.<br>
This produces on the wheel contact faces a relative speed Av<br>
between the wheei and rail and thus a frictional force which is<br>
dependent on the relative speed ∆v and which docoierates the<br>
vehicle. The force and torque conditions in a braking process<br>
are illustrated schematically in figure 3. Here, the<br>
relationships with the relative speed which is standardized to<br>
the velocity v, what is referred to as the slip s Av/v, are<br>
illustrated.<br>
The frictional force is the product of the adhesion loading fx,<br>
which is nonlinearly dependent on the slip, and the wheel<br>
contact force, as illustrated in figure 4. As the slip<br>
increases, the adhesion loading fx rises quickly, and drops<br>
away slowly after its maximum value has been reached. The<br>
maximum value μ of the adhesion loading is greatest in. the case<br>
of a dry rail and decreases significantly when the weather<br><br>
3<br>
PCT/AT2006/000155<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
conditions become poor. If the braking process takes place on<br>
the ri.sinq branch of an fx slip curve, it is stable.If an<br>
excessively high slip value exceeds the maximum value, the<br>
controlled system becomes unstable and the wheel decoierates<br>
very quickly and becomes stationary. In this context, a<br>
prolonged braking distance and an undesired flat point on the<br>
wheel occur.<br>
The region to the left of the maximum value in figure 2 is also<br>
referred to as "microslip", and the region to the right of the<br>
maximum value is also referred to as "macroslip".<br><br>

PCT/AT2006/000155<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
Modern antiskid systems are intended, on the one hand, to<br>
prevent the axle coming to a standstill and, on the other hand,<br>
to bring about a high level of utilization of adhesion in the<br>
contact between the wheel and the rail (and thus a braking<br>
distance which is as short as possible) under various weather<br>
conditions.<br>
Commercially available antiskid systems according to the prior<br>
art use knowledge-based controllers which assess the current<br>
state by means of a suitable evaluation of measurement<br>
variables, obtain the suitable reaction from a decision table<br>
and implement it as a series of pulses to the antiskid valves.<br>
For each rail vehicle series, individual adaptation of the<br>
large number of controller parameters is necessary, and said<br>
adaptation can be carried out only by antiskid experts with<br>
specialist knowledge and experience. The necessary test runs<br>
are very time consuming and expensive.<br>
An object of the invention is to develop an antiskid means in<br>
pneumatic brakes for rail vehicles which is significantly<br>
easier to construct and to set than the antiskid means known<br>
from the prior art, which makes it possible to reduce the costs<br>
and time involved in the setting. The braking distances which<br>
are achieved are intended here to bo at least as short as the<br>
braking distances achieved with "conventional" systems. At.<br>
least the braking distance values which are predefined by<br>
regulations are to be complied with.<br>
This object is achieved with a method mentioned at the<br>
beginning in that according to the invention during a braking<br>
process the instantaneous actual slip between at least one<br>
wheel of the rail vehicle and a rail is determined, and<br>
furthermore a setpoint slip between the at least one wheel and<br>
the rail is predefined, and the brake cylinder pressure is<br>
varied in accordance with the deviation of the actual slip from<br>
the predefined setpoint slip in such a way that the deviation.<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	-5-<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
between the setpoint slip and the actual slip approaches zero<br>
or is minimized.<br>
In this way it is significantly easier to chanqe the brake<br>
cylinder pressure for a braking process than is known from the<br>
prior art, and no further settings, or only small additional<br>
settings, are necessary on the control system.<br>
In principle, the method according to the invention functions<br>
satisfactorily if a permanently set value is predefined (or the<br>
setpoint slip. The method can, however, also bo improved<br>
significantly if the value for the setpoint slip can bo<br>
predefined in a variable fashion, and continuous adaptation of<br>
the setpoint slip to the current conditions is thus possible.<br>
The method functions in an optimum way if the sctpoint slip is<br>
determined within the scope of an optimum slip search.<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 6-<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
The setpoint slip can be selected in the region of the<br>
microslip but also in the region of the macroslip, as will be<br>
explained in more detail later.<br>
It is expedient if the actual slip is measured continuously<br>
during the entire braking process. However, as a rule the slip<br>
control requires continuous measurement of the actual slip<br>
during the entire braking process.<br>
As is also explained in more detail below, in one specific<br>
embodiment of the invention it is favorable if the actual brake<br>
cylinder pressure is additionally measured, a setpoint brake<br>
cylinder pressure is also determined with reference to the<br>
deviation of the actual slip from the predefined setpoint slip,<br>
and the actual brake cylinder pressure is varied in such a way<br>
that the deviation between the setpoint slip and the actual<br>
slip approaches zero or is minimized.<br>
In order easily to permit adaptation of the inventive control<br>
of the brake cylinder pressure to different types of vehicle<br>
and models of vehicle, the invention also relates to a method<br>
for adapting the transmission factor KR of a slip controllor as<br>
a function of at least one vehicle-specific parameter. For this<br>
purpose, during a stable braking process on an essentially<br>
level and straight rail, the axle speed  and the brake<br>
cylinder pressure pc of a wheel set with the rolling radius R<br>
are continuously measured, and the vehicle-specific parameter,<br>
referred to as the brake state factor ζ, is determined<br>
therefrom in accordance with the following relationsnip:<br><br>
The adaptation of the controller transmission factor can be<br>
carried out very easily with a further method, described below<br>
within the scope of this invention, for adapting the<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 7 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
transmission factor KR of an antiskid controller. A stablt: test<br>
braking process is sufficient to determine the brake state<br>
factor. This constitutes a significant advantage over the<br>
adaptation of knowledge-based controllers in which a large<br>
number of different entries from a large table have to be newly<br>
determined by means of a plurality of test runs.<br>
In order to achieve optimum adaptation, there is provision for<br>
the measured values of a stable braking process to be used<br>
exclusively.<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 8-<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
Furthermore, it is favorable if the axle speeds are measured at<br>
q axles and the brake cylinder pressures are measured at <br>
axles, whereby the following relationship can be used to<br>
determine the brake state factor (ξ) :<br><br>
In this way it is possible to minimize falsifications of the<br>
conversion from the wheel rotation to the velocity by virtue of<br>
the fact that the mean value over all the axles of the rail<br>
vehicle is used in the implemented identification equation.<br>
In a specific embodiment, at m different times, measured values<br>
are recorded, the brake state factors ξ,(k) associated with the<br>
times are determined, and mean values are formed for the brake<br>
state factors ξ(k) :<br><br>
Adaptation of the transmission factor (KR,L) of a slip<br>
controller (SRE) from a reference vehicle to another vehicle is<br>
calculated using the brake state factor in accordance with the<br>
relationship<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 9 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br><br>
where K'R,i is the known controller transmission factor of a<br>
reference vehicle, and ξ' is the brake state factor of the<br>
reference vehicle.<br>
The adaptation of the brake state factor can also be refined if<br>
the following relationship is used when a current measured<br>
value for the total vehicle mass is present:<br><br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 10-<br>

where M is the current rail vehicle mass and Mo is the mass<br>
which the rail vehicle has during the determination of the<br>
brake state factor ξ.<br>

Figure 1 is a schematic view of a control system SYS according<br>
to the invention for the inventive control of the brake<br><br>

cylinder pressure Pc,act of a pneumatic brake PNE (see also<br>
figure 8 with the brake cylinder pressures pC,1, pc,2, Pc,3, PC,4)<br>
During a braking process, the instantaneous actual slip sact<br>
between at least one wheel ?. of the rail vehicle and a rail 3<br>
is determined at the rail vehicle FZG (see also figure 3) and<br>
is available as a signal which is continuous over time.<br>
Furthermore, a setpoint slip ssetp is predefined between the<br>
wheel 2 and the rail 3.<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 14-<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
Depending on the deviation of the actual slip sact from the<br>
predefined setpoint slip ssetp, the brake cylinder pressure<br>
Pc,act, and thus the braking torque, are varied in such a way<br>
that the deviation between the setpoint slip and actual slip<br>
approaches zero or is minimized taking into account the faults<br>
in the real system.<br>
A continuous cascade controller forms the core of the control<br>
system SYS according to the invention. The slip control SRE<br>
which is described above and which operates according to a PIDT<br>
method (linear controller) is central and it determines a brake<br>
cylinder setpoint pressure psetp in accordance with the<br>
predefined setpoint slip ssetp and the current actual slip sdct.<br>
In the subordinate pressure controller PRE of the control<br>
system SYS, the brake control pressure signal pst, which<br>
corresponds, for example, to the necessary change in the<br>
cylinder pressure, is determined from the difference between<br>
this brake cylinder setpoint pressure psetP and the measured<br>
cylinder pressure pc,act. If necessary, a downstream switching<br>
sequence generator module PWM converts the continuous pressure)<br>
control signal pst into a pulse width-modulated discrete siqnal<br>
for actuating the antiskid valves. The pulsed signal can only<br>
assume the values "0" or "1", which is interpreted by the<br>
pneumatic valves as "open" or "closed".<br>
The setpoint slip ssetp can be predefined in a fixed fashion,<br>
but preferably different values for the setpoint. slip ssetp are<br>
set during the braking process, in particular, it is favorable<br>
if the setpoint slip ssetp is determined by a corresponding<br>
optimum slip searcher OPS, which is superimposed on the actual<br>
slip controller, and also has the rotational, speed ωi of the<br>
wheel set i as an input, see figure 1 . A procedure for<br>
determining the optimum slip is known, for example, from:<br>
U. Kiencke, Realtime Estimation of Adhesion Characteristic<br>
between Tyres and Road, Proceedings of the IFAC World Congress,<br>
vol. 1, pp. 15-18, Sydney, July 1993.<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 15 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
The control system SYS according to the invention is therefore<br>
composed essentially of a continuous cascade controller with<br>
the central linear slip controller SRF, a pressure control<br>
circuit PRE, which can be optionally connected into the circuit,<br>
and a superimposed setpoint value predefining means and an<br>
optionally superimposed optimum slip searcher OPS (optimum slip<br>
is that slip at which the best possible utilization of adhesion<br>
occurs) and a downstream switching sequence generator. Input<br>
variables of this control system SYS are the current rotational<br>
speed of the axle ω and the velocity ν for determining the slip<br>
sact. The output variable is the brake control pressure signal<br>
pst. In general, the brake control pressure signal pst is<br>
generated as a pulsed pattern, due to pneumatic valves which<br>
are already present.<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	-16-<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
As is also apparent from figure 8, such a conLro.l system is<br>
usually provided for the brake or brakes on each axle of a rail<br>
vehicle. In principle, it would, however, also be conceivable<br>
for a control system to be provided for a plurality of axles or<br>
the brake or brakes of a plurality of axles.<br>
The subordinate pressure control allows the brake cylinder<br>
pressure to be kept more precisely at the setpoint pressure,<br>
which minimizes the number of wheel debraking operations and<br>
thus leads to a low consumption of air and to short braking<br>
distances, but pneumatic valves with cylinder pressure sensors<br>
are required.<br>
Figure 2 shows by way of example a braking process of a rail<br>
vehicle using an inventive slip controller SRE or control<br>
system SYS. The velocity ν of the vehicle, the circumferential<br>
speed ωR of the wheel and the braking distance BWE are<br>
represented. As is clearly apparent, the circumferential speed<br>
ωR of the wheel decreases to a greater extent than the velocity<br>
of the vehicle ν at the beginning. In order to prevent, the<br>
wheel being braked to a speed of zero (undesired skidding), the<br>
brake pressure is correspondingly reduced so that the<br>
circumferential speed of the wheel can increase again. The<br>
brake pressure can then be increased again etc.<br>
As is clearly apparent, it is particularly important, in<br>
particular at low speeds, that is to say near to the stationary<br>
state of the vehicle, for the brake pressure to be controlled<br>
very precisely in order to prevent the wheels from skidding.<br>
Correspondingly, in this range the circumferential speed of the<br>
wheels is kept close to the velocity of the vehicle.<br>
Figure 4 shows the nonlinear profile of the adhesion loading<br>
slip curve. The frictional force is the product of the adhesion<br>
loading fx which is dependent in a nonlinear fashion on the<br>
slip, as illustrated in figure 4, and the wheel<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 17 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
contact force. As the slip s increases, the adhesion ioadino fx<br>
rises quickly and drops slowly after reachinq its maximum<br>
value. The maximum value , of the adhesion loadinq is qreatest<br>
in the case of a dry rail and decreases significantly if the<br>
weather conditions become poor. If the braking process takes<br>
place on the rising branch of an fx slip curve, it is stable.<br>
When the maximum value is exceeded by an excessively high slip<br>
value, the controlled system becomes unstable and the wheel<br>
decelerates very quickly and becomes stationary.<br>
If the braking process takes place to the left of the maximum<br>
value ("microslip", s 
case of braking processes to the right of the maximum value<br>
("macroslip", s &gt; smax) , the wheel becomes basically unstable,<br>
i.e. it decelerates very quickly and finally becomes stationary<br>
while<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 18 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
at the same time the inert mass of the rail vehicle continues<br>
moving with a velocity greater than zero. This results in the<br>
formation of a flat point.<br>
During a braking process, a change in the behavior of the<br>
material occurs as a result of the relative velocity Av and the<br>
frictional forces or heat caused thereby. Furthermore, the<br>
leading wheels clean the rail for the frailing axles. This<br>
behavior is referred to as a conditioning effect and results in<br>
the level of the adhesion curve rising during a braking<br>
process, as illustrated in figure 4 (unbroken line at a time t1<br>
"before" the occurrence, and dot-dashed Line for fx at a time<br>
t2 "after" the occurrence of conditioning effects) .<br>
The control system SYS according to the invention operates in a<br>
stable fashion in the macro- and microslip regions without the<br>
braking process becoming unstable and without the wheel<br>
becoming stationary.<br>
Operation in the microslip region provides a number<br>
advantages, such as a very low-wear braking process which is<br>
associated with a high level of comfort (few activations of<br>
valves) . However, extremely precise measurements of the input,<br>
variables are necessary as a result of the steeply rising curve<br>
in this region.<br>
Such precise measurement of the input variables is not<br>
necessary for the macroslip control, in particular in the flat<br>
part of the characteristic curves. Furthermore, as a result of<br>
the high slip values the abovementioned conditioning effects<br>
are activated and they significantly increase the values for<br>
the adhesion loading fx during braking. Significantly higher<br>
braking forces can thus be transmitted, and the braking<br>
distances are therefore shortened.<br>

air consumption of the pneumatic brake and siqnificantly better<br>
braking performance with the control according to the invention<br>
compared to a conventional antiskid system.<br>
In the text which follows, more details will be given on the<br>
basic principles on which the invention is based, and further<br>
advantageous aspects of the invention will be examined in more<br>
detail.<br>
As already mentioned, instead of a characteristic diagram<br>
controller, as known from the prior art, a conventional<br>
controller SRE is advantageously used with the slip s or the<br>
relative velocity Av (difference between the absolute speeds of<br>
the vehicle and of the wheel) as a controlled variable.<br><br>

The object of keeping the expenditure on adjustment for various<br>
vehicle types low is achieved by means of two strategies. On<br>
the one hand, the time constants of the control device and of<br>
the signal filtering are determined by moans of a robust<br>
controller design in such a way that the antiskid means<br>
operates in a stable fashion for a wide range of vehicle types<br>
extending from a locomotive to the Metro. A lew parameters such<br>
as the vehicle mass, the time constant of the pneumatics and<br>
the transmission factor KR of the controller are adaptive,<br>
i.e. vehicle-specific parameters of the control algorithm.<br>
These parameters are determined during commissioning or from<br>
measured variables of selective test braking maneuvers.<br>
The test braking maneuver is carried out with the rai1 vehicle<br>
on a level and straight section of track, and if is imperative<br>
that none of the axles becomes unstable during the braking<br>
process owing to the prevailing weather conditions. For the<br>
duration of the braking process, the axle decelerations (&amp;) and<br>
the brake cylinder pressures (C pressures) pC,1 are measured<br>
continuously. The static transmission factor  between the<br>
brake cylinder pressure and vehicle deceleration can be<br>
determined from the measured values when the wheel radius R is<br>
known. The transmission factor  which is referred to below as<br>
the brake state factor, is composed of all. the relevant<br>
parameters of the brake system and of the vehicle. If there is<br>
a conventional controller with the transmission factor KR for<br>
a rail vehicle with the brake state factor ' , the transmission<br>
factor of the same controller can be adapted for another rai1<br>
vehicle with the brake state factor , by means of the<br>
relationship<br><br><br>

With a further method which is described as follows within the<br>
scope of this invention, for adapting the transmission factor<br>
of an antiskid controller, the adaptation of the controller<br>
transmission factor can be carried out very easly because a<br>
stable braking process is sufficient to determine the brake<br>
state factor. This constitutes a significant advantage over the<br>
adaptation of knowledge-based controllers, in which a large<br>
number of different entries from a large table have to be newly<br>
determined by means of a plurality of trial runs.<br>
Figure 3 shows the force and torque conditions in an n-th<br>
vehicle model. The n-th part of the rail vehicle body 1 is<br>
connected to the braked wheel 2 of the axle i, which wheel 2<br>
moves on the rail 3. If the law of the conservation of momentum<br>
and angular momentum is applied<br><br>

equation (6) becomes<br><br>
The variable Ui which is newly introduced into equation (8)  is<br>
the input variable of a system described by the equations (2)<br>
and  (8)  and which represents  the wheel/rai1  dynamics.  From<br>
comparison of equation (8) with (6) the following is obtained<br><br>
In a pneumatic brake system,  the braking torque of the i-th<br>
axle with respect to the operating point is typically<br><br>
Inserting  equation   (10)   into  equation   (9)   provides  a<br>
relationship between Ui and the brake cylinder pressure pc,,<br><br>
The vehicle-specific parameters which occur in equation  (11)<br>
are combined to form the so-called brake state factor :<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 25 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br><br>
It is shown below that: the brake slate factor , can be<br>
determined from measured values of the wheel speeds and brake<br>
cylinder pressures during a braking process.<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 26 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
The system is intended to be controlled by means of a slip<br>
controller. Since the manipulated variable yi, of the controtter<br>
exerts influence on the brake system of the rail vehicle, the<br>
brake cylinder pressure Pc,i is a function t (yi) of the<br>
controller manipulated variable yi:<br><br>
It is assumed that the brake system with the antiskid device<br>
has a transmission factor of 1 between the manipulated variable<br>
Yi and the brake cylinder pressure Pc,i.<br>
For a selected brake state factor ,', i.e. for a specific rail.<br>
vehicle type or general  reference controller is to<br>
be designed preferably using methods of the robust controtter<br>
design in order, for example, to obtain robustness of the<br>
control, with respect to changing adhesion condi lions in the<br>
wheel/rail contact and with respect to changes in the behavior<br>
in the pressure build-up in the brake cylinders over time. The<br>
control algorithm which is acquired in this way wi11 have, with<br>
respect to its operating point, the following form<br><br>
Here, K'R,1 is the transmission factor of the controtter of the<br>
i-th axle and pi is a function which is suitably selected in<br>
terms of the control objective and is dependent on the control<br>
deviation ssetP, l- Si.<br>
The adaptation of the controller transmission factor for<br>
another series of rail vehicles with a brake state factor <br>
which is different from ,' but has the same or relatively high<br>
natural frequencies of the vehicle<br><br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	-27- <br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
dynamics is carried out as per equation (1) by multiplying the<br>
controller transmission  factor K'K,1 by the quotient, of the<br>
brake  state  factors    .  The  adapted  control  algorithm  is<br>
therefore as follows<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 28 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br><br>
If,  instead of	a slip control,  a skidding speed control	is<br>
considered, the	same relationship applies to the adaptation	of<br>
the controller	transmission factor. The skidding speed	is<br>
defined as<br><br>
If this relationship is used instead of equation (4) , the<br>
following is obtained for the dynamics of the skidding speed:<br><br>
and the control algorithm which is to be used as a reference<br>
has the following form in terms of its operating point:<br><br>
The control algorithm which is adapted to the vehicle series is<br>
correspondingly<br><br>
In the text which follows an explanation is given of how the<br>
brake state factor , can be determined by means of a braking<br>
process. It necessary to ensure that the braking process Lakes<br>
place on a track which is as level and straight as possible and<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	-29-<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
that none of the n axles becomes unstable durinq the brakinq<br>
process. If these requirements are met, it is assumed below<br>
that approximately the same adhesion fx is present at al1 n,<br>
axles, and approximately the same brakinq torque TB,I is appllied<br>
(identical or very similar pneumatic brake equipment, at all n<br>
axles) . The movement equations (2) and (3) of the n th vehicle<br>
model are simplified to produce.<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 30 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br><br>
Equation (20) can be reordered according to fx and the<br>
following is obtained with the approximation v = R1 with slow<br>
deceleration or low slip:<br><br>
Inserting equation (22) into equation (21) provides<br><br>
Using the rotation factor X from equation  (7), equation  (23)<br>
becomes:<br><br>
Resolving equation (25) according to the brake state factor <br>
yields:<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 31 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br><br>
In this way, a computation rule for determining the brake state<br>
factor , is obtained. If axle speeds are measured at, q axles<br>
and brake cylinder pressures are sensed at 1 axles, the<br>
measured values should preferably be averaged over the axles.<br>
In this way an extended computational, rule for determining the<br>
brake state factor  is obtained as follows:<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 32 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br><br>
If the brake state factor is calculated as per equation (27) at<br>
various times k where k =l,...,m in the steady state phase of the<br>
braking process, it is recommended to finally average these<br>
values (k)<br><br>
According to equation (12), the brake state factor  is<br>
composed of a plurality of vehicle-specific parameters. These<br>
parameters can change over the operating period of a rall<br>
vehicle. For example, brake linings become worn etc. It is<br>
therefore recommended to adapt the controller transmission<br>
factor according to equation (1) from time} to time for one and<br>
the same rail vehicle.<br>
In some types of rail vehicle, the mass of the vehicle is<br>
determined during operation. Since the brake state factor <br>
according to equation (12) depends on the rail vehicle mass,<br>
the information relating to the instantaneous mass can be<br>
utilized to refine the adaptation rule (1) by including the<br>
mass :<br><br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 33 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
Here, M is the instantaneous mass of the rail vehicle and Mi is<br>
the mass which the ral1 vehicle had at the time of the breaking<br>
process for determining .<br>
Figure 5a then shows the functional diagram of the "wheel set<br>
i" controlled system. The controlled system, which is<br>
illustrated as a transmission element between the braking<br>
torque TB,i (input variable) and the slip si (output variable),<br>
can be regarded as a series connection of a "wheel/rail<br>
dynamies" transmission element 4 and a proportional element b.<br>
The "wheel/rail dynamics" transmission element 4 describes the<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 34 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
transmission behavior between the input variable ui , and the<br>
slip Si and is described in the n-th vehicle model by the two<br>
differential equations (2) and (8). The proportional element, b<br>
is represented by equation (9).<br>
Figure 5b shows the functional diagram of the "wheel set i with<br>
brake system" controlled system. The input variable of the<br>
controlled system is the brake cylinder pressure Pc,i. The<br>
proportional element connected upstream of the "wheel/rail<br>
dynamics" transmission element 4 thus has the transmission<br>
factor , as per equations (11) and (12) . The transmission<br>
factor , is also referred to as the brake state factor.<br>
Figure 6a shows the "wheel set i with brake system" controlled<br>
system of a reference rail vehicle 7, now embedded in a closed<br>
control circuit for controlling the slip si with respect to the<br>
guide variable &amp;setP,i. A reference controller 10 with the<br>
transmission factor K'R,I has been configured for the wheel/rail<br>
dynamies 7 of the reference rail vehicle with the brake state<br>
factor ' (reference number 8). The relationship between the<br>
manipulated variable yi and the brake cylinder pressure pc,i,  is<br>
represented by the transmission block 9 (brake cylinder with<br>
antiskid valves of the reference vehicle).<br>
Figure 6b shows the control circuit with the "wheel set i with<br>
brake system" controlled system of a rail vehicle with the<br>
brake state factor , (reference number 6) for which the<br>
controller is to be adapted. The adapted controller 12 has the<br>
transmission factor as per equation (15) . The brake cylinder<br>
with antiskid valves is provided with the reference number 11,<br>
A denotes the wheel/rail dynamics of the vehicle.<br>
Figure 7 is a diagram with measured values of the four wheel<br>
circumferential speeds R, R, R and R as well as the two<br>
brake cylinder pressures per bogie Pc,1&amp;2 and pc,3&amp;4. The values<br>
have been measured on a real rail vehicle. The lower plot shows<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 35 -<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
the value of the brake state factor , calculated from the<br>
measured values in the Lime range of the steady stale braking<br>
process  as  per  equations  (27)  and  (28).  The  foi lowing  is<br>
obtained for the mean value:   Figure 8 shows, by<br>
means of an exemplary embodiment, how the method according to<br>
the invention can be applied in a four-axle ra.i 1 vehicle. The<br>
brake cylinder 15 generates braking force which acts on the<br>
brake disk 14 via the brake linkage with brake linings 16. As a<br>
result a braking torque which acts on the wheel set 13 is<br>
produced. The brake cylinder pressure results from the brake<br>
control pressure, which is applied<br><br>
PCT/AT2006/000155	- 36-<br>
2005P05209WOUS<br>
to the brake cylinder 1b via the brake line 17 and the antiskid<br>
valves 18. A pressure sensor 19 makes measured values of the<br>
brake cylinder pressure available to the antiskid controller 21<br>
(corresponds to the control system SYS in fiqure 1) .<br>
Furthermore, the antiskid controller 21 receives measured<br>
values for the axle speed via the pulse generator 20. The<br>
antiskid controller 21 sets the antiskid valves 18. The<br>
antiskid controller 21 is a conventional controller with the<br>
transmission factor 22. By means of the unit for calculating<br>
the brake state factor 23, the value , is determined as per<br>
equation (28) and is used for updating the controller<br>
transmission factor 22 with respect to the given types of rail<br>
vehicle. The unit 23 for calculating the brake state factor-<br>
requires measured values of the axle speeds and brake cylinder-<br>
pressures of aff four axles which have been assumed during the<br>
steady state phase of a stable braking process.<br><br>
