RETAINED TENSION METAL LOCKING TIE WITH 360 DEGREE SEAL Cross-Reference To Related Applications<br>
{0001] This application claims priority to Provisional Patent Application No. 60/786,796, filed March 28, 2006. Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a cable tie, and more particularly, to a metal locking tie thai provides a 360-degree seal around a bundle of objects. Baclcground of the Invention<br>
[0003] Metallic bundling devices incorporating locking balls and roller pins have been used for bundling bales of cotton or the like since the Nineteenth Century. None of the prior art devices were positive locking, i.e. depending on the orientation of the locking head, gravity could hold the ball out oflocking engagement with the strap resulting in release. U.S. Patent No. 4,399,592 addressed this problem by teaching the addition of a raised portion or protuberance for deflecting the threaded strap away from the floor as the chreaded strap exits the locking head. This deflection ensures that the locking ball is in continuous engagement with the threaded strap regardless of the position of the ball or the orientation of the locking head. Although the threaded strap is secured in the locking head, there are gaps between the strap and the bundle of objects.<br>
[0004] Thus, it would be desirable to provide a cable tie that is capable of providing an improved 360-degree seal around a bundle of objects. Summary<br>
[0005] A metal locking tie is disclosed. The cable tie includes an elongate metallic su^p or body with an extended tab and a metallic locking head secured to the strap. The locking head includes<br><br>
a top and a boltom. The bottom of the locking head has a plurality of relief slots. The relief slots<br>
enable the locking head to deform when the cable tie is installed around a bundle of objects. The<br>
locking head also includes at least one tab extending from the bottom of the locking head. The<br>
extended tab of the strap, (he at least one front tab of the locking head and the relief slots in the<br>
bottom of the locking head enable the metal locking tie to provide a 360 degree seal around a<br>
bundle of objects.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0019} FIG. 1 illustrates the metal locking tic 20 of the present invention. The metal locking tie<br>
20 includes a metal locking tie strap or body 40 and a metal locking tic head 60. As illustrated in<br>
RGS. 1-6, the metal locking tic body 40 includes a top 42, a bottom 44 and an extra long or<br>
extended body tab 46. When the tie body 40 is installed in the tie head 60, the extra long body<br>
tab 46 extends along the bottom 64 of the tie head 60 covering the bottom 64 of the tie head 60.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 1-3, the extra long body tab 46 also extends beyond the tic head 60 such<br>
that the extra long body tab 46 is positioned beneath a portion of the tie body 40. As discussed<br>
below with respect to FIG. 9, when the metal locking lie 20 is installed around a bundle of<br>
objects 100, the extra long body tab 46 contacts a portion of the outer surface 102 of the bundle<br>
of objects 100.<br>
[0020] As shown in FIGS. 4 and S, the tie body 40 includes a displacement aperture 47 and an<br>
engagement slot 48. The displacement aperture 47 is located in the center of the top 42 of the tie<br>
body 40 as illustrated and described in commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 6,647,596, herein<br>
incorporated by reference. The engagement slot 48 is located in front of the displacement<br>
aperture 47. The engagement slot 48 wraps around the front of the tie body 40 toward the extra<br>
long body tab 46.<br><br>
[0021] Alternatively, the tie body 40 may include a displacement slot 49 (see FIG. 6). The displacement slot 49 is located in the center of the top 42 of the tie body 40. The displacement slot 49 can be used as a displacement lock feature for securing the tie body 40 to the tic head 60. [0022] The tie body 40 also includes ramps 43 located on the top 42 of the tie body 40 as illu-sirated and described in commonly owned U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/886,532, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0023] As illustrated in FIGS. 1-3,7, and S, the metal locking tie head 60 includes a top 62, a bottom 64, a strap entrance end or front portion 66. a strap exit end or a back portion 68, and a strap receiving aperture 67 extending therebetween. The metal locking tie head 60 also includes a typical locking ball 80 that enables the tie body 40 to be locked with respect to the tie head 60. FIGS. 1-3.7. and 8 further illu.<itrate the metal locking tie head with a pair of long front ubs tabs extend outwards from bottom through engagement slot when body is installed in altemaiiveiy if includes displacement would></itrate>
[0024] The tie head 60 also includes a plurality of relief slots 72. The relief slots 72 are located at each comer 74 of the bottom 64 of the tie head 60. The relief slots 72 extend from the from portion 66 and the back portion 68 of the lie head 60 toward the center of the tic head 60. The relief slots 72 enable the front portion 66 and back ponion 68 of the tic head 60 to deform when the metal locking tic 20 is installed around a bundle of objects 100. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 9. the tie head 60 is able to conform to the outer surface 102 of the bundle of objects 100 when the metal locking tic 20 is under a tensile load.<br><br>
(0025] FIG. 10 illustnites a cross section of the extra long body tab 46 of the tie body 40 when the metal locking tie 20 is installed around a bundle of objects 100. The extra long body tab 46 reduces the gap 110 between the metal locking tie 20 and the outer surface 102 of the bundle of objects 100. Thus, the extra long body tab 46, the long front tabs 70 and the relief slots 72 in the bottom 64 of the tie head 60 enable the metal locking tic 20 to provide a 360 degree seal around a bundle of objects.<br>
[0026] FIGS. 11-13 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the metal locking tic 120. The metal locking tie 120 includes a tie .strap or body 140 and a metal locking tie head 160. The tie body 140 includes an extra long or extended body tab 146 identical to the extra long body tab 46 of tie body 40 described above with respect to FIGS. 1-10. Additionally, similar to the tie body 40 illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, the tie body 140 also includes a displacement aperture and an engagement slot or a displacement slot (not illustrated).<br>
[0027] The metal locking tie head 160 includes a top 162, a bottom 164, a strap entrance end or a front portion 166, a strap exit end or a back portion 168, and a strap receiving aperture 167 extending therebetween. The metal locking tie head 160 also includes a single long front tab 170. The single long front tab 170 extends outward from the bottom 164 of the tie head 160. As illustrated in FIG. 13, the bottom 164 of the metal locking tie head 164 includes a stepped seam 165 for accommodating the single long front tab 170. Thus, when the metal locking tie 120 is assembled, the long front tab 170 extends through the engagement slot or the displacement slot when the tic body 140 j.s installed in the tic head 160.<br>
[0028] Similar to the tie head 60 discussed above, the tie head 160 also includes a plurality of relief slot.s 172. The relief slots 172 are located at each comer 174 of the bottom 164 of the de head 160. The relief slots 172 extend from the front portion 166 and the back portion 168 of the<br><br>
lie head 160 toward the center of the tie head 160. The relief slots 172 enable the front portion 166 and back portion 168 of the tie head 160 to deform when the metal locking tie 120 is installed around a bundle of objects LOO.<br>
{0029] As a result, the long body tab 146. the long front tab 170 and the relief slots 172 in the bottom 164 of the tie head 160 enable the metal locking tie 120 to provide a 360 degree seal when the metal locking tie 120 is installed around a bundle of objects 100. [0030] Furthermore, while the particular preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the teaching of the invention. The matter set forth in the foregoing description and accompanying drawings is offered by way of illustration only and not as limitation. The actual scope of the invention is intended to be defined in the following claims when viewed in their proper perspective based on the prior art.<br><br><br><br>
