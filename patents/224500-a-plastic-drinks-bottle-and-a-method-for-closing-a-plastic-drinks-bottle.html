				<td>A plastic drinks bottle with a capsule<br>
The present invention relates to a plastics drinks bottle with a neck and with a closure attached thereon and with an aluminium capsule with an active ingredient in solid, powder or liquid form which is enclosed therein and which is to be dispensed into the bottle contents, with the features of the preamble of patent claim 1.<br>
Aluminium capsules in which active ingredients are kept in a manner capable of being siorsd before they are added to the base substance, have been known for some years now. One of the known examples is coffee in capsules, through which freshly boiled water is poured.<br>
Drinks with a high vitamin content may only be stored in a very limited manner, since the vitamins break down under the influence of heat or light. Accordingly, such drinks need to be stored and transported in a cooled manner, which leads to a higher sales price. Moreover, a filling in non-transparent or opaque bottles likewise leads to higher costs and reduces their aesthetic appearance. To compensate this, one requires a completely printed covering.<br>
A solution with the features of the preamble of patent claim 1 is known from WO 00/27717. Here, a capsule with the raised part to the top is placed onto the bottle neck and with a closure is held thereon in a clamped manner. The closure is designed such that the capsule is destroyed by way of pressure on its flexible cover surface, and the content may be dispensed into the container.<br>
A similarly designed solution is already known from WP 98/40289. However, here the capsule is accommodated in the closure itself. The closure has a mechanism which permits the capsule to be pierced open. Logically, this demands the capsules to be filled in die closure and held therein, before they are supplied to the filling works. This may hardly be accomplished in practice for hygienic and logistical reasons.<br>
Whilst in WO/40289 it was assumed that the closure is removed after emptying the capsule and that the capsule is to be removed, in a solution according to WO 01/36289, it is suggested to provide the container with a closure which comprises a piercing means which is displaceable in a spout and thus is to act simultaneously as a piercing means as well as a valve.<br>
Finally, a closure with a capsule is known from GB-A-2'364'699 which is to be held in the closure and on the container neck in a sealed manner amid the intermediate inlay of a viewing disk.<br><br>
Very high speeds are vital in all filling works known today. As a result, it is inconceivable for a capsule to be placed onto the bottle neck after filling, and for a closure to be screwed on after this. It is indeed in this time period that the transport on a transport path also takes place, and as a result of this, the loosely applied capsules would fall off before a closure could be pushed thereover and screwed on. A post-foaming occurs with many drinks on filling, which may likewise lead to the capsule falling from the bottle neck.<br>
The manufacture of capsules is effected with a very high dimensional accuracy. This is also the case with the design of the necks of the bottles. This however is more problematic with regard to closures. Accordingly, the assembly of capsules in closures is problematic and necessitates additional sealing measures, for example the inlay of soft rubber seals and likewise. This causes an increased material expense and an additional assembly step with the corresponding higher costs.<br>
A successful introduction into the market cannot be reckoned with, without solving the pre\*iously mentioned problems. Accordingly, the inventor has set the task of designing a bottle and an aluminium capsule such that amid the application of a method likewise according to the invention, one may implement a filling in today's filling installations without losses in quality or quantity.<br>
These and other task are achieved by the plastics drinks bottle defined in claim 1.<br>
The direct welding of the capsules onto the container neck entails several additional advantages. Sealing problems which occur otherwise are solved by way of the welding. The welding which is otherwise only usual with products which are at risk of oxidation, such as ketchup and oily substances, here leads to a improved sealing, which not only increases the storage capability of the product, but also renders superfluous the sealing between the capsule and closure as well as between the capsule and bottle, which is otherwise required.<br>
The exactly fitting design of the capsule may be attached to the bottle neck, such that a spilling due to subsequently foaming drinks may not be effected.<br>
The fitting accuracy may also be used for a clamped mounting in the receiver of the welding head, by which means an intimate connection to the welding stamp is ensured. After the welding is effected, the capsule is pulled from the mounting. If exceptionally, the welding is inadequate, then the capsule remains in the mounting and the unwelded bottle is sorted out.<br><br>
Two variants of the invention which at present are the most significant, are represented in the accompanying drawings, and are explained by way of the subsequent description. There are shown in;<br>
Figure 1A-D a bottle neck and a capsule in four different assembly steps, wherein tire raised part of the capsule projects upwards from the bottle neck.<br>
Figure 2A-D a bottle neck and a capsule in four assembly steps, wherein the capsule with its raised part projects upwards from the bottle neck.<br>
Figure 3A-B shows the capsule alone in an enlarged scale, wherein this is represented once partly sectioned in a lateral view and once in a plan view of the raised surface, whilst<br>
Figure 4	shows an alternative form of a capsule in the diagonal section.<br>
A bottle neck is indicated at 1 in Figures 1A-D and 2A-D. More generally this is also called container neck 1. The entirety of the container or bottle is not shown, since the bottle- or container body is not essential to the invention and may be designed in any manner.<br>
The design of the closure is also not relevant and is accordingly not shown here. With regard to the closure therefore, it may be the case of a screw closure or of a hinge closure, and the connection between the bottle or container neck 1 and the closure may practically include all known forms of connection, such as a thread, knock-on bead or spike closure. In principle, the cross section of the container neck 1 may have any shape, if one does not restrict oneself to a threaded connection.<br>
What is important is an exact adaptation of the capsule to the container neck with regard to the shape. Since in any case one desires as little as possible variants on manufacture of the capsule, one would preferably stick to the usual few standards of drinks bottles, wherein here the known wide-neck bottles with a container neck diameter over 20 mm are preferred. Such a standard bottle neck is represented in the figures, with an outer thread 2 and a lower retaining collar 3 which on manufacture of the preform of the bottle, is required for mounting in the blowing machine. The bottle necks which are manufactured in injection moulds, are extremely accurate with regard to shape, and do not change during the blowing procedure. The dimensions of such a bottle neck are within very tight tolerances as a result of this.<br><br>
The variables of interest here are the outer diameter of the bottle neck da, the inner diameter of the bottle neck di and the bottle neck wall thickness w, which results from this as l'2(da-di).<br>
The end-face 4 of the bottle neck must also be formed in an exact manner. Here the evenness of the bottle neck end-face 4 is important. Any uneveness leads to a worsening of the welding, which is yet to be described.<br>
Referring to Figures 3 A and B, the design of the capsule is now dealt with. The capsule itself is indicaied in its entirety at 100. It consists of two films, wherein the one film forms a plane surface 10 and the other film a surface with a central raised part 11. These two surfaces 10 and 11 are connected to one another in the region of the peripheral edge 12. The two films 10, 11 are welded or bonded in the region of the edges 12. With regard to these films, it is often the case of coated aluminium films, wherein the welding actually represents a weld connection of the coatings, which is possible at significantly lower temperatures that an aluminium to aluminium welding.<br>
The outer diameter of the capsule corresponds to the diameter of the edge and is 2rr. The diameter of the upper parallel surface, the so-called central, raised part 13, just as the height of this raised part 13, plays less of a role. A conically inclined wall 12 runs down from the raised part to the edge 12. The inclination should be relatively steep and preferably should run inclined upwards from the horizontal of the edge 12 at an angle of approx. 85° to 60°. This inclination simplifies an automatic placing of the capsules onto a container neck without jamming.<br>
The width b of the edge 12 corresponds relatively accurately to the dimension w of the end-wall surface of the container neck 1. As a result, the inner diameter re of the edge 12 corresponds to the inner diameter d, of the container neck. These two dimensions are matched to one another such that the capsule 100 is accommodated in the container neck 1 in an exactly fitting manner. This means that with the placing-on of the capsule 100 with the raised part towards the inner side of the container neck, this falls in under the intrinsic weight in a centring manner, as this is represented in Figure IB. Only under pressure D does the capsule come into the end position, with which it is held in the container neck 1 in a clamped manner and the edge 12 of the capsule lies on the container neck end-face 4, as is shown in Fig. lc. hi this position, a post-foaming of a filled drink is prevented and a floating-off of the capsule is not possible. This also permits the receptacle to be transported further from the filling station, and in the remote position for the welding to take place which is symbolically represented in Fig. ID.<br>
This arrangement does not correspond to the conventional arrangement of capsules on bottles. In particular, if the capsules are designed as blisters, then this arrangement is impossible<br><br>
since only the plane surface 10 may be pierced here. Accordingly, with the aluminium capsule 100 selected here, it is suggested to provide the surfaces 10 and 11 with breakage lines 15 and 16 respectively (cf. Figure 3). These are thin locations which are pressed in the film on shaping, in the form of channels, which simplify a corresponding breaking-through. The breakage lines 15,<br>
16	are designed as circular lines which are peripheral at least to three quarters, so a bend-up zone<br>
17	which is not weakened, remains.<br>
Since the capsule 100 remains on the container neck 1, it is useful to incorporate circular breakage lines 15 and 16 on the flat side 10 as well as on the side with a central raised part 13. Thereby, one would select the diameter of both breakage lines such that the larger diameter lies closer to the container interior.<br>
The previously described solution is definitely the most preferred one. Certain conditions, in particular relatively small container diameters may however lead to the fact that the variant as is represented in the Figures 2A to 2D must be selected.<br>
With respect to the previously made explanations regarding the container neck, with the embodiment according to Figures 2A to 2D, the same applies as with the solution according to Figures 1A to ID. The reference numerals have been retained. The central, raised part 13 of the capsule now projects upwards away from the container neck 1. The method is accordingly different compared to the previously described solution. The fitting accuracy is now no longer required between the capsule 100 and the container neck 1, but between a welding head 20 and the capsule 100. The welding head has a receiver space 21 in which the capsule 100 as previously, is accommodated in the container neck 1 in an exactly fitting manner. If the capsule does not hold in the receiver space 21, then it is not dimensionally accurate and falls out. This forms an automatic dimensional control. This situation is represented in Figure 2B.<br>
An electrically heated annular wall 2 as a heating stamp 22 is shown peripherally around the receiver space 21. This heating stamp is preferably mounted in a resilient manner, wherein firstly an electrical contact is formed in the pressed condition. This is effected by way of pressing the welding head 20 over the container neck, until the collar presses on the container neck end-face 4, and the heating stamp 22 presses on the edge 12 of the capsule and the welding is effected.<br>
On lifting up the welding head 20, the capsule 100 is pulled from the receiver space 21 in which the capsule is held in a clamped manner. Here, a tension is exerted on the weld connection between the bottle neck and the capsule. With a correct welding, the capsule remains on the bottle neck (Figure D) whilst an incorrect welding is not capable of accommodating this force, and the capsule is torn away. This forms a further control.<br><br>
The first-described solution necessitates a lower effort with regard to machine apparatus. Despite this, filling installations may exist with which the second variant may be realized with a lower effort. The second variant however is hardly suitable for "after-foaming" drinks.<br>
Since the dispensing quantity of the substrate, of the active ingredient or another addition which are to be supplied may be very different, here a solution is also suggested with which the two surfaces 10' and 1V are both provided with a suitable raised part 13' and 13" respectively. In principle, these two raised parts 13' and 13" may be equally high. However it is more preferable 10 design these differently. The remaining space below the closure permits a larger or smaller r2ised pari depending on the design of the closure which is to be placed on. With the use of these capsules, one would always press and weld the capsule on the bottle neck in a centred manner, as already previously described. Here too, one must observe the previously described dimensioning conditions.<br><br>
