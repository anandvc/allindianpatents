				<td>The present invention relates to a connector.<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H05-182712discloses a connector comprised of a male housing having a receptacle for surrounding tabs of male terminal fittings and a female housing provided with female terminal fittings, wherein the female terminal fittings and the tabs are connected by fitting the female housing into the receptacle.<br>
Since a clearance is defined between the outer circumferential surface of the female housing and the inner circumferential surface of the receptacle in view of a dimensional tolerance and an assembling tolerance in the connector of this type, the two housings unavoidably shake, although only to a slight degree, in their connected state. There has been a demand for a countermeasure because this shaking leads to an abrasion caused by fine sliding movements between the terminal fittings,<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above problem and an object thereof is to prevent an abrasion caused by fine sliding movements between terminal fittings.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by a connector according to claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector, comprising:<br>
a first housing at least partly accommodating one or more first terminal<br>
fittings and including a receptacle for surrounding parts of the first terminal fittings, and<br>
	a second housing at least partly accommodating one or more second<br>
terminal fittings,<br>
	the first and second terminal fittings being connectable by at least partly<br>
fitting the second housing into the receptacle,<br>
	wherein:<br>
	the second housing includes a substantially tubular fitting portion onto or<br>
into which the receptacle is at least partly fittable, and<br>
one or more preventing projections for preventing a relative displacement of the receptacle and the tubular fitting portion by coming into contact with a mating side are provided at at least either one of the receptacle and the tubular fitting portion in such a position so as to come into contact the mating side at a timing towards the end of the connection of the first and second housings.<br>
	Since the preventing projections for preventing the relative displacement<br>
of the receptacle and the tubular fitting portion by coming into contact with the mating side are provided at at least either one of the leading end of the receptacle and the back end of the tubular fitting portion, an abrasion between the terminal fittings due to fine sliding movements resulting from the relative displacement of the two housings can be prevented.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the one or more preventing projections for preventing a relative displacement of the receptacle<br>
and the tubular fitting portion by coming into contact with the circumferential surface of the mating side are provided at at least either one of the leading end of the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle and the back end of the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a connector, comprising:<br>
a male housing accommodating male terminal fittings and including a receptacle for surrounding tabs of the male terminal fittings, and<br>
a female housing accommodating female terminal fittings,<br>
the female terminal fittings and the tabs being connected by fitting the female housing into the receptacle,<br>
wherein:<br>
the female housing includes a tubular fitting portion onto which the receptacle is fittable, and<br>
preventing projections for preventing a relative displacement of the receptacle and the tubular fitting portion by coming into contact with the circumferential surface of a mating side are provided at at least either one of the leading end of the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle and the back end of the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion.<br>
	Since the preventing projections for preventing the relative displacement<br>
of the receptacle and the tubular fitting portion by coming into contact with the circumferential surface of the mating side are provided at at least either one of the leading end of the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle and the back end of the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion, an<br>
abrasion between the terminal fittings due to fine sliding movements resulting<br>
from the relative displacement of the two housings can be prevented.<br>
	Preferably, the one or more preventing projections are provided only at<br>
the tubular fitting portion.<br>
	Since   substantially   no   connection   resistance   resulting   from   the<br>
interference of the preventing projections and the receptacle is created up to a stage immediately before the proper connection of the two housings in the process of connecting the two housings, connection operability is good.<br>
	Further preferably, a lock arm is provided at a surface of the tubular<br>
fitting portion,<br>
	a   lock  portion   engageable  with   the   lock  arm   is   provided   on   a<br>
corresponding side of the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle.<br>
	Still further preferably, one or more guiding ribs extending substantially<br>
along a connecting direction of the two housings are provided on one or more sides, preferably on opposite lateral sides, of the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle,<br>
	one or more guiding grooves extending substantially in the connecting<br>
direction of the two housings and engageable with the corresponding guiding ribs are formed in the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion.<br>
	Further preferably, wherein at least part of the preventing projections are<br>
provided at at least either ones of surfaces of the leading ends of the guiding ribs and surfaces of the back ends of the guiding grooves.<br>
	Still further preferably, at least part of the preventing projections are<br>
provided at at least either one of the leading end of a side of the outer<br>
circumferential surface of the receptacle and the back end of a corresponding side of the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion.<br>
Most preferably, a lock arm is provided at a surface, preferably the upper surface of the tubular fitting portion,<br>
a lock portion engageable with the lock arm is provided on a corresponding side, preferably an upper side of the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle,<br>
guiding ribs extending along a connecting direction of the two housings are provided on the opposite left and right sides of the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle,<br>
guiding grooves extending in the connecting direction of the two housings and engageable with the corresponding guiding ribs are formed in the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion,<br>
the preventing projections are provided at at least either ones of the upper surfaces of the leading ends of the guiding ribs and the upper surfaces of the back ends of the guiding grooves, and<br>
the preventing projections are also provided at at least either one of the leading end of the bottom side of the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle and the back end of the bottom side of the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion.<br>
	Since the lock arm and the lock portion are present at the upper walls of<br>
tubular fitting portion and the receptacle, it may be spatially difficult to provide the preventing projections on these upper walls. However, according to the present invention, a vertical relative displacement of the two housings can be<br>
prevented by a pair of left and right preventing projections provided on or in the<br>
guiding ribs or the guiding grooves and the preventing projections provided on<br>
the bottom walls of the receptacle or the tubular fitting portion.<br>
,	Recording to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, at least <br>
one preventing projection is provided at the back end of the tubular fitting portion, and one or more, preferably a pair of notches for weakening a portion of the tubular fitting portion, preferably for letting the inside and the outside of the tubular fitting portion communicate with each other are so formed as to be located at the opposite sides of the corresponding preventing projection.<br>
	A part of the tubular fitting portion where the preventing projection is<br>
provided is made resilienty displaceable by forming the one or more notches. Thus, the preventing projection comes into contact with the receptacle in the process of connecting the two housings, and the preventing projection is   resiliently displaced in a direction away from the receptacle, whereby the   <br><br>
connection   resistance   resulting  from   the   interference   of  the   preventing <br>
projection and the receptacle can be reduced.	<br>
preferably, an area of the outer circumferential surface of the tubular <br>
fitting portion between the pair of notches is recessed to form a thinned portion. By forming the thinned[portion, the area of the tubular fitting portion where the preventing projection is formed is thinned to be more easily resiliently displaceable, and the female housing is made lighter.<br>
	Most preferably, one or more guiding surfaces inclined with respect to a<br>
connecting direction of the two housings are formed at the front ends of the respective preventing projections.<br>
	These and  other objects,  features and  advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments and accompanying drawings. It should be understood that even though embodiments are separately described, single features thereof may be combined to additional embodiments.<br>

Hereinafter, a first preferred embodiment of the prevent invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 12. A connector of this embodiment is comprised of a male housing 10 at least partly accommodating one or more, preferably a plurality of male terminal fittings 11 and a female housing 20 at least partly accommodating one or more, preferably a plurality of female terminal fittings 21. In the following description, connecting sides of one housing with the mating housing are referred to as front or front side.<br>
The male housing 10 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin and has a receptacle 12 projecting forward (substantially same direction as a connecting direction CD with the female housing 20). Narrow and long and forward-projecting tabs 11a of the respective male terminal fittings 11 are or are to be at least partly accommodated in the receptacle 12 and protected from the interference of external matters and the like by being at least partly surrounded by the receptacle 12. On the outer surface of the lateral (upper) wall of the receptacle 12, a lock portion 13 projects upward (outward) at an intermediate position (preferably at a substantially middle position} with respect to widthwise direction WD and/or forward and backward directions FBD (connection direction CD) of the receptacle 12. One or more /ib-shaped projections 14 extending ,,--' substantially in forward and backward directions FBD (substantially parallel with the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20),. preferably over the substantially entire length of the receptacle 12 from the front end to the rear end are formed at one or more positions preferably at the substantially<br>
opposite lateral (left and right} sides of the lock portion 13 on the outer surface of the outer (upper) wall of the receptacle 12. One or more guiding ribs 15 . extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD (substantially parallel with the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20) preferably over the substantially entire length of the receptacle 12 from the front end to the rear end and preferably having a substantially rectangular cross section are formed at least on one outer surface different from the outer (upper) surface where the rib-shaped portion(s) is/are formed, preferably substantially transversely symmetrically formed on the outer surfaces of the lateral (left and right) walls of the receptacle 12.<br>
One or more, preferably a, plurality of (e.g. five auxiliary projections 16A, 16B, 16C for preventing the shaking between the housings 10, 20 in radial directions (directions intersecting with the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20) are formed on the outer circumferential surface(s) of the receptacle 12 similar to preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C of the female housing 20 to be described later. These five auxiliary projections 16A, 16B, 16C are arranged at or near or towards the rear end of the receptacle 12 (position preferably corresponding to the front end of a tubular fitting portion 29 of the female housing 20 immediate before the two housings 10, 20 are properly connected in the connecting process of the two housings 10,20).<br>
One auxiliary projection 16A preferably substantially narrow and long in<br>
forward and backward directions FBD is formed at an intermediate position (preferably substantially at a widthwise middle position) of a substantially flat<br>
area of the outer (bottom) wall of the receptacle 12. On the opposite lateral (left and right) walls of the receptacle 12, a pair of auxiliary projections 16B preferably substantially rectangular in side view are substantially transversely symmetrically formed at positions below or adjacent to the guiding ribs 15 and in an intermediate position (preferably substantially in the middle) with respect to the height direction HP (i.e. a direction at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the connecting direction CD and/or the widthwise direction WD) of the receptacle 12. The auxiliary projections 16C preferably substantially narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD preferably are substantially transversely symmetrically formed on the substantially horizontal and flat (substantially parallel with the bottom wall of the receptacle 12 and/or substantially parallel with the connecting direction CD) outer (upper) surfaces of the lateral (left and right) guiding ribs 15. In other words, the auxiliary projections 16C project substantially in the height direction HP from (or at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to) the respective lateral surface of the guiding rib 15. A projecting distance of these auxiliary projections 16A, 16B, 16C from the outer surfaces of the receptacle 12 is slightly larger than a clearance defined between the receptacle 12 and the tubular fitting portion 29 in view of a dimensional tolerance and/or an assembling tolerance. Further, the projecting end surfaces (outer surfaces) of the respective auxiliary projections 16A, 16B, 16C are all substantially flat surfaces. One or more juiding surfaces 17A, 17B,17C inclined with respect to the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20<br>
are formed at the front ends of the respective auxiliary projections 16A, 16B, 16C.<br>
Next, the female housing 20 is described. The female housing 20 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin and preferably substantially in the form of a block as a whole and a front portion (preferably a substantially front half) of the female housing 20 is fittable or insertable into the receptacle 12. One or more, preferably a plurality of cavities 22 which are substantially narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD and into which the respective female terminal fittings 21 are at least partly insertable from an insertion side, preferably substantially from behind., are formed inside the female housing 20. A resiliency deformable and preferably cantilever-shaped locking portion 23 extends substantially forward (substantially same direction as the connecting direction CD with the male housing 10) is formed at the lateral (preferably bottom) wall of each cavity 22. A resilient (preferably rubber-made) seal ring 24 is mounted in an area of the outer circumferential surface of the female housing 20 corresponding to the locking portions 23. A retainer 25 preferably is at least partly mounted or mountable onto or into or to the female housing 20 preferably from front. The retainer 25 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin and includes a stopper 25a for preventing the seal ring 24 from coming off preferably forward, a cavity forming portion 25b forming front end portions of the inner walls of the cavities 22, and a displacement preventing portion 25c for preventing displacements of the locking portions 23 in a direction away from the female terminal fittings 21.<br>
	The female housing 20 is formed with at least one lock arm 26 extending<br>
substantially in forward and backward directions FBD along the lateral (upper) surface of the female housing 20. The lock arm 26 is supported on the lateral {upper} surface of the female housing 20 via a leg portion 27 in an intermediate portion (preferably substantially in the longitudinal middle) thereof, and is resiliency deformable to incline forward and backward with the Jeg portion 27 as a supporting or pivot point. A locking hole 28 engageable with the lock portion 13 of the receptacle 12 when the two housings 10, 20 are properly connected is formed at or near the front end of the lock arm 26.<br>
The female housing 20 is integrally or unjtarily _formed with the tubular fitting portion 29 at least partly surrounding a front portion (preferably a substantially front half) of the female housing 20. The tubular fitting portion 29 has the rear end thereof coupled to the outer circumferential surface of the female housing 20 and is open forward (substantially same direction as the connecting direction CD with the male housing 10). With the two housings 10, 20 properly connected with each other, the receptacle 12 is at least partly fittable or insertable into a clearance between the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion 29 and the outer circumferential surface of the female housing 20. In other words, the tubular fitting portion 29 at least partly surrounds the receptacle 12. One or more, preferably a, pair of lateral (left and/or right) guiding grooves 30 corresponding to the guiding ribs 15 of the receptacle 12 are formed in the inner surfaces of the lateral (left and/or right) wall{s) of the tubular fitting portion 29. It should be noted that a notch 31 is formed in an area of the lateral (upper) wall of the tubular fitting portion 29<br>
substantially corresponding to the formation area of the lock arm 26 in order to avoid the interference with the lock arm 26.<br>
Each female terminal fitting 21 includes a connecting portion 21 a <br>
preferably in the form of a substantially rectangular tube at the front side<br>
thereof, and the tab 11a is at least partly insertable into this connecting portion<br>
21a from front. An engaging portion 21b engageable with the locking portion 23<br>
with the female terminal fitting 21 inserted up to a substantially proper position<br>
in the cavity 22 to retain the female terminal fitting 21 in the cavity 22 is formed<br>
at the rear end of the connecting portion 21a. A wire connection portion<br>
(preferably comprising a wire crimping portion 21c] at the rear end portion of<br>
the female terminal fitting 21 is connected (preferably crimped or bent or folded<br>
into connection) with a wire 35. With the female terminal fitting 21 properly<br>
inserted, a resilient contact piece (not shown) provided in the connecting<br>
portion 21a and the tab 11a resiliently touch each other. This touching portions<br>
are located before the seal ring 24 and the locking portions 23.<br>
	One or more preferably a, plurality of (e.g. six jn this embodiment)<br>
preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C for preventing the shaking of the two housings 10, 20 in radial directions (directions intersecting with the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20) with the two housings 10, 20 properly connected are formed on or at the inner surface of the tubular fitting portion 29. These six preventing projections 32A, 32B , 32C preferably are all arranged at or near the back end or back end portion 29BE, i.e. rear end (position substantially corresponding to the front end of the receptacle 12 of the male housing 10 immediately before the two housings 10, 20 are properly connected<br>
in the connecting process of the two housings 10, 20) of the tubular fitting portion 29.<br>
One or more (preferably a pair of transversely symmetrical) preventing projections 32A narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD project upward or inward in a substantially flat area of the lateral (bottom) wall of the tubular fitting portion 29. One or more (preferably a, pair of transversely symmetrical] preventing projections 32B narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD project inwardly from the lateral (left and right) wall{s) of the tubular fitting portion 29. One or more, preferably a pair of preventing projections 32C narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD are preferably substantially transversely symmetrically formed to project downward or inward on the lateral (upper) surfaces of the lateral (left and right) guiding grooves 30. A projecting distance of these preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C from the inner surfaces of the tubular fitting portion 29 is slightly larger than the clearance defined between the receptacle 12 and the tubular fitting portion 29 in view of the dimensional tolerance and/or the assembling tolerance. Further, the projecting end surfaces (outer surfaces) of the respective preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C are substantially flat surfaces. One or more guiding surfaces 33A, 33B, 33C inclined with respect to the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20 are formed at the front ends of the respective preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C.<br>
The preventing projections 32B formed on the lateral (left and right) walls of the tubular fitting portion 29 substantially correspond to the auxiliary projections  16B on the corresponding  lateral  (left and  right) walls of the<br>
receptacle 12 with respect to transverse direction or widthwise direction WD. The preventing projections 32C formed on the outer (upper) surfaces of the lateral (left and right) guiding grooves 30 substantially correspond to the auxiliary projections 16C of the guiding ribs 15 of the receptacle 12 with respect to vertical direction VD. The preventing projections 32A formed on the outer (bottom) wall of the tubular fitting portion 29 substantially correspond to the outer (bottom) wall of the receptacle 12 with respect to vertical direction VD. A loose movement preventing portion 34 substantially corresponding to the auxiliary projection 16A of the outer (bottom) wall of the receptacle 12 with respect to vertical direction VD by being located preferably substantially in the widthwise middle is so formed on the outer (bottom) wall of the tubular fitting portion 29 as to be narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD preferably over the substantially entire length from the front end to the rear end (back end 29BE) of the tubular fitting portion 29.<br>
Next, functions of this embodiment are escribed.<br>
In the process of connecting the two housings 10, 20, the receptacle 12 is at least partly fitted into the clearance between the female housing 20 and the tubular fitting portion 29, but the preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C at the rear end 29BE of the tubular fitting portion 29 and the receptacle 12 do not touch each other up to a stage immediately before the two housings 10, 20 are substantially properly connected. Thus, the sufficient clearance is ensured between the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle 12 and the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion 29, whereby the receptacle 12 (male housing 10) and the tubular fitting portion 29 (female housing 20) are<br>
relatively    displaceable    in    directions    (vertical    direction    VD    and/or transverse/widthwise direction WD) intersecting with the connecting direction ,.-CD. Therefore, no or very low connection resistance is created between the two housings 10, 20 due to the presence of the preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C and the auxiliary projections 16A, 16B, 16C.<br>
The two housings 10 20 may ..largely shakei because of the clearance<br>
.between the receptacle 12 and the tubular fitting portion 29 as described <br>
above. However, in this embodiment, the loose movement preventing portion<br>
34 projecting toward the receptacle 12 is formed on the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the tubular fitting portion 29 to substantially reduce the clearance<br>
Thus, the shaking between the two housings 10, 20 is suppressed without<br>
creating substantial connection resistanee	<br>
As the connection of the twohousings10, 20'proceeds up to a stage immediately before they are properly connected, the front end of the receptacle 12 comes substantially into contact with the seal ring 24 to resiliency deform the seal ring 24 preferably in radial and/or longitudinal directions, wherefore a connection resistance resulting from a resilient restoring force of the seal ring 24 is created. Thereafter, as the two housings 10, 20 are further connected, the front end of the receptacle 12 comes substantially into contact with the guiding surfaces 33A, 33B, 33C of the respective preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C and, substantially simultaneously, the guiding surfaces 17A, 17B, 17C of the auxiliary projections 16A, 16B, 16C come into contact with the tubular fitting portion 29. A slight connection resistance is created by this contact. In the process of further proceeding the connection of the two housings 10, 20 from<br>
this state, the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle 12 comes substantially into sliding contact with the outer surfaces of the ..preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C and/or the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion 29 comes substantially into sliding contact with the outer surfaces of the auxiliary projections 16A, 16B, 16C. A slight connection resistance (sliding resistance) is created by this sliding contact. Relative displacements (shaking) of the two housings 10, 20 in the directions intersecting with the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20 are prevented while the connection resistance resulting from this sliding movements is created.<br>
Even in a connection completed state where the two housings 10, 20 are properly connected, the shaking (relative displacements) between the housings 10, 20 in radial directions (directions intersecting with the connecting direction CD) is prevented by the contact of the preventing projection(s) 32A, 32B, 32C with the receptacle 12 and/or the auxiliary projection(s) 16A, 16B, 16C with the tubular fitting portion 29. The contact positions of the preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C with the receptacle 12 are located substantially in the substantially same area (or at the substantially same connection stroke of the housings 10, 20) as the contact area of the receptacle 12 with the seal ring 24, specifically located slightly more backward than the contact position of the receptacle 12 with the seal ring 24 toward the back end 29BE of the tubular fitting portion 29. These contact positions of the preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C with the receptacle 12 are also located more backward than the contact portions of the female terminal fittings 21 with the tabs 11a toward the<br>
back end 29BE of the tubular fitting portion 29 (more forward than the front ends of the tabs 11a), and/or located more backward than the engaged portions of the locking portions 23 and the female terminal fittings 21 (more forward than the front ends of the tabs 11a). These contact positions are displaced forward of the tabs 11a from the position where the front end 26F of the lock arm 26 presses the upper wall of the receptacle 12 in radially inward direction at a position behind the lock portion 13.<br>
	When the two housings10, 20are ...properly connected, the tabs 11a of<br>
the male terminal fittings 11 enter the female terminal fittings 21 and come substantially into contact with the resilient contact pieces (not shown) in the connecting portions 21a, with the result that the mating terminals 11, 21 are connected. Further, the clearance between the inner circumferential surface of the front end of the receptacle 12 and the outer circumferential surface of the female housing 20 preferably is hermetically sealed by the seal ring 24.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, the preventing projection(s) 32A, 32B, 32C for preventing the relative displacements of the receptacle 12 and the tubular fitting portion 29 by coming substantially into contact with the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle 12 are provided at the back end 29BE of the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion 29. Thus, an abrasion between the terminal fittings 11, 21 due to fine sliding movements resulting from the relative displacements of the two housings 10, 20 can be prevented.<br>
Further, since the prevention projections 32A, 32B,32C are provided only on the tubular fitting portion 29 so that no connection resistance resulting<br>
from the interference of the preventing projections 32a, 32B, 32C with the receptacle 12 is created up to the stage immediately before the substantially proper connection in the process of connecting the two housings 10, 20, connection operability is better.<br>
Furthermore, since the lock arm 26 is proyided at the lateral (upper) surface of the tubular fitting portion 29 and the lock portion 13 engageable with the lock arm 26 is provided on the corresponding lateral (upper) outer surface of the receptacle 12, it is spatially difficult to provide preventing portions on the respective lateral (upper) wall of the tubular fitting portion 29 and/or the receptacle 12. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the guiding rib(s) 15 extending substantially along the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20 is/are provided on the lateral (left and right) outer surfaces of the receptacle 12; the guiding groove(s) 30 extending substantially along the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20 and engageable with the respective guiding rib{s) 15 are formed in the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion 29; the preventing projection(s) 32C is/are provided on the lateral (upper) surface(s) of the back end(s) of the guiding groove(s) 30; and the preventing projection(s) 32A is/are provided at the back end 29BE of the inner lateral (bottom) surface of the tubular fitting portion 29. Thus, relative vertical displacements of the two housings 10, 20 can be prevented by the one or more, preferably pair of lateral (left and right) downward-projecting preventing projections 32C provided on the guiding grooves 30 and the upward-projecting preventing projections 32A provided on the corresponding (bottom) wall of the tubular fitting portion 29.<br>
	Further, relative transverse displacements of the<br>
prevented by the one or more, preferably pair of inward-projecting preventing projections 32B provided on the lateral (left and right} walls of the tubular fitting portion 29.<br>
Accordingly, to prevent an abrasion between terminal fittings due to fine sliding movements, a male housing 10 includes one or more male terminal fittings 11, and a receptacle 12 for at least partly surrounding corresponding one or more tabs 11a of the male terminal fittings 11. A female housing 20 includes one or more female terminal fittings 21 and a tubular fitting portion 29 at least partly fittable on or into or to the receptacle 12. Since one or more preventing projections 32A, 32B, 32C for preventing relative displacements of the receptacle 12 and the tubular fitting portion 29 by coming into contact with the outer circumferential surface of the receptacle 12 are provided at or near the back end or back end portion 29BE of the inner circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion 29, an abrasion between the terminal fittings 11. 21 due to fine sliding movements resulting from the relative displacements of the two housings 10, 20 can be prevented. <second embodiment><br>
Next, a second preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 13 to 16. In the second embodiment, there is provided a means for reducing a connection resistance when the two housings 10, 20 are connected. Since the other construction is similar or same as in the first embodiment, the structure, functions and effects thereof are not described by identifying it by the same reference numerals.<br>
-The back end (rear end) 29BE of the bottom wall of the tubular fitting portion 29 where one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and right} preventing projections 32A are formed is cut away in its transverse region except areas where the preventing projections 32A are formed, whereby three notches 40 are formed. These notches 40 are located at the opposite lateral {left and right) sides of the respective preventing projections 32A and penetrate the bottom wall of the tubular fitting portion 29 preferably to let the inside and the outside of the tubular fitting portion 29 communicate with each other. A formation area of the notches 40 with respect to forward and backward directions FBD extends from a position before the front ends of the preventing projections 32A to a position behind or close to the rear ends of the preventing projections 32A (i.e. rear end position of the tubular fitting portion 29). By forming these notches 40, the areas of the bottom wall of the tubular fitting portion 29 where the preventing projections 32A are formed (i.e. area located between each pair of adjacent notches 40) serve as resilient supporting portions 41 resiliency deformable in radial directions (directions intersecting with the connecting direction CD of the two housings 10, 20) of the tubular fitting portion 29. Further, one or more thinned portions 42 are formed in the outer circumferential surface of the rear end of the bottom wall of the tubular fitting portion 29 by recessing the areas substantially corresponding to the preventing projections 32A (resilient supporting portions 41). Thus, the resilient supporting portions 41 are thinner than areas before the resilient supporting portions 41. In this embodiment, a pair of notches 40 are formed at the substantially opposite sides of each preventing projection 32A at the back end 29BE of the<br>
tubular fitting portion 29 where the preventing projections 32A are formed and penetrate the bottom wall of the tubular fitting portion 29 preferably to let the inside and the outside of the tubular fitting portion 29 communicate with each other, and the resilient supporting portions 41 of the tubular fitting portion 29 where the preventing projections 32A are provided are made resiliently displaceable. Thus, when the preventing projections 32A come substantially into contact with the receptacle 12 in the process of connecting the two housings 10, 20, the preventing projections 32A are resiliently deformed in a direction away from the receptacle 12, thereby reducing a connection resistance resulting from the interference of the preventing projections 32A with the receptacle 12.<br>
Further, since the thinned portions 42 are formed in the outer circumferential surface of the tubular fitting portion 29 by recessing the area between each pair of adjacent notches, i.e. the resilient supporting portions 41 where the preventing projections 32A are formed, the areas of the tubular fitting portion 29 where the preventing projections 32A are formed are made thinner to be more easily resiliently displaceable and to make the female housing 20 lighter. <other embodiments><br>
