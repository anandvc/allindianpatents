				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COUPLING COMPONENTS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001 ] In order to accommodate torque transfer and potentially misalignment<br>
between rotatable members such as shafts, flexible couplings have been employed. Such<br>
couplings are connected by flanges or spline connections and are specifically designed to<br>
transmit torque from one component to the other component while absorbing and dissipating<br>
the effects of misalignment.<br>
[0002] While many such couplings exist, all suffer from limited degree of flexibility.<br>
One common way of increasing misalignment tolerance is to incorporate additional flexible<br>
elements. This however results in a heavier and more expensive construction as well as<br>
commonly the introduction of additional stress risers occasioned by the manufacturing<br>
process. Some increased flexibility can be obtained but with dimhiishing returns.<br>
[0003] A common causative factor related to prior art couplings failing is the<br>
development of fatigue fractures. These can develop both from a lack of flexibility (rigidity)<br>
overall in the coupling and from individual stress risers within the coupling. Some of the<br>
structural rigidity (material and stress risers) of currently available commercial designs comes<br>
from the means of manufacture of the coupling. One example of a process commonly<br>
associated with stress risers being introduced to a coupling is a welding process to join<br>
adjacent diaphragms. Welding causes localized phase change in the metal of the disks often<br>
resulting in a change in hardness and heat-treating properties of the coupling in the local<br>
region. Another weakness of prior art couplings is that they can have very low axial stiffness<br>
due to inherent design factors and method of construction. This low stiffness can lead to<br>
vibration problems that can produce failures of flexing elements.<br>
[0004] The foregoing and other drawbacks inherent in the prior art have been<br>
tolerated for an extended period of time because there was no viable alternative. This fact<br>
notwithstanding, the art would be very much benefited by the availability of a more durable<br>
flexible coupling.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Disclosed herein is a single piece unitary metal coupling having a first end and<br>
a second end and a convolution between the first and second ends.<br>
[0006] Further disclosed herein is a method for making a single piece unitary<br>
construction flexible coupling including machining from a starting material, one or more<br>
single piece unitary construction flexible couplings having a first coupling end and a second<br>
coupling end and one or more convolutions at the first and second ends.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0018] Initially in this disclosure, embodiments of the coupling itself are discussed<br>
followed by a method of manufacturing the couplings.<br>
[0019] Referring to Figure 1, a perspective view of one embodiment of the disclosed<br>
flexible coupling 10 is illustrated. The flexible coupling 10 may be (and as illustrated is) a<br>
disk type coupling. The particularly illustrated embodiment includes three convolutions 14,<br>
18, and 22. More or fewer convolutions may be used. The coupling 10 includes a first end 26<br>
and a second end 30 intended to be attached to first and second shafts (not shown).<br>
Configurations for ends 26 and 30 include flanges, splined connections, threaded<br>
connections, geometric drive shapes, etc. In the Figure 1 embodiment, the first end 26 is a<br>
first flange, and the second end 30 is a second flange. Flanges 26 and 30 are illustrated<br>
without openings but may include openings for through passage of fasteners. Also noted is<br>
that the convolutions are illustrated without openings therethrough in figure 1. hi some<br>
embodiments of the coupling disclosed herein, openings 32 are provided (as illustrated in<br>
Figure 2). These openings assist in nitriding processes if employed and also function to allow<br>
escape of moisture from within the coupling during use.<br>
[0020] Referring to Figure 3, a cut-away view of the flexible coupling 10 is<br>
illustrated. This view provides visual access to both the interior of the coupling and to the<br>
thickness of the material of the coupling. The coupling 10 comprises an inner surface 34 and<br>
outer surface 38. Between the surfaces, the thickness of material is not fixed but rather is<br>
gradually reduced with increasing radial distance from the axis of the coupling according to<br>
particular parameters mat are discussed hereinbelow. Also important to note is that an<br>
outside surface beginning at the root of each convolution is radiused. hi the illustrated<br>
coupling the surface is a compound radius surface. At the inside surface near the root of the<br>
convolution in an angle is formed for stress reduction reasons. The outside surface 40 and<br>
inside surface 42 are labeled in Figure 4. Figure 4 illustrates a representative cross section 44<br>
of one of the convolutions of a coupling of the invention (disk 1), and superimposed thereon<br>
in broken lines (where visible), a representation of a cross section 46 of a fixed thickness<br>
coupling (disk 2). The purpose of the illustration is to show thickness variation in the<br>
coupling disclosed herein and where stress points are measured (numerals 1-23) for a Finite<br>
Element Analysis, the results of which are graphically depicted in Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5<br>
depicts stress associated with applied torque while Figure 6 depicts stress associated with<br>
misalignment of the shafts engaging the coupling. A reader is easily able to appreciate the<br>
reduction in stress of the coupling according to this disclosure. The coupling herein (disk 1)<br>
-huses<br>
a radiused and tapered outer surface 40 and an inner angled surface 42 near the inner<br>
diameter of the flexible coupling to form a tailored thickness distribution to achieve lower<br>
stresses and an optimized stress distribution for the coupling. Specifically, the tailored wall<br>
thickness allows for a reduction in total stress, and it reduces the stress concentration and<br>
localized stress magnification that is present with uniform wall thickness designs. Figure 5<br>
shows that the maximum calculated stress is reduced by approximately 33% through the use<br>
of the tapered thickness distribution illustrated for the applied torque load case. In addition,<br>
the peak stress due to angular misalignment for this coupling is reduced by approximately<br>
18% and the stress magnification effect has also been significantly reduced with a less<br>
pronounced stress peak and a more uniform stress distribution (Figure 6).<br>
[0021] The decreasing thickness cross section (with radial distance from the coupling<br>
axis) for the convolutions according hereto allow for tailoring of axial and bending stiffness<br>
of the coupling for natural frequency placement and resonance detuning. This is beneficial<br>
over other types of couplings with a constant thickness type configuration because such are<br>
limited in terms of stiffness control. This limitation has resulted in couplings that have had<br>
vibration problems in a drive train leading to wear at attachment points such as bolted flanges<br>
and splines. Moreover, such vibration in arrangement in which such couplings might be<br>
incorporated has even led to failure of the flexing elements in such prior art systems.<br>
[0022] The flexible coupling 10 may be manufactured from a number of materials<br>
such as titanium, corrosion resistant steels, carbon steel, high strength steels (including<br>
Maraging steel), and nickel materials (such as rnconel) and combinations including at least<br>
one of the foregoing. A common nitriding process may optionally be utilized to create a hard<br>
shell nitride thickness and enhance durability of the coupling. Gas nitriding is preferred due<br>
to the depth of convolutions in the coupling.<br>
[0023] Regardless of material selection, an overriding requirement is to achieve<br>
superior material and fatigue characteristics by ensuring that the coupling material has about<br>
consistent material and fatigue properties throughout. That is to say that the coupling as<br>
disclosed herein avoids localized stress risers associated with inconsistent material and<br>
fatigue properties in its constitution and construction. Achieving both of these has been<br>
elusive to the art and yields exceptional strength and durability in the coupling described<br>
herein. The disclosed coupling does not have any welds or bonds that might otherwise alter<br>
- S" -<br>
material and/or fatigue properties of the coupling material. Moreover, because the coupling<br>
does not include bonds or welds (which are for obvious reasons located at the outermost<br>
region of each disk in couplings of the prior art), and because material thickness in the<br>
coupling decreases with increasing distance from the coupling axis the center of gravity of<br>
the coupling disclosed herein is positioned more radially inward than prior art couplings have<br>
been able to achieve thereby rendering the coupling disclosed herein superior to the prior art<br>
couplings. One of the benefits of a reduced radial positioned center of gravity is that the<br>
centrifugal force acting on the coupling is much smaller than in a similarly dimensioned<br>
coupling having a center of gravity positioned more radially outwardly of the coupling axis<br>
(further from the axis of rotation of the coupling).<br>
[0024] In another embodiment hereof, and referring to Figures 7 and 8, the concept of<br>
the coupling illustrated above is retained but the coupling is essentially inverted (outside to<br>
inside). This embodiment is configured for smaller diameter axial opening 100 applications<br>
that would not permit machining of the deeper internal cavities due to limited size of the<br>
coupling. The coupling 110 has ends 126 and 130 which are located near the outside of the<br>
diameter of the coupling 110. One will appreciate that the larger reach machining is done<br>
from the outside of the coupling rather than the inside thereof and inside machining depth is<br>
kept to a minimum. The depth of any inside machining to be done is limited to the cutter<br>
blade length minus the blade support width in line with the blade. Therefore if a small<br>
diameter opening is required in the coupling to be produced, the depth of inside machining is<br>
limited as well. The embodiment of Figures 7 and 8, address this issue while still retaining<br>
much of the strength and durability of the previously described embodiments. In the<br>
illustration, a two convolution coupling is shown with the deepest machining surface at 150.<br>
It is apparent that there are two other depth machining surfaces and these are identified as 152<br>
and 154, but these are much less deep and therefore may be machined with a smaller cutter<br>
that can be fit through the inside diameter of the coupling. Ends 126 and 130 are illustrated<br>
without any particular drive or connection arrangement but it will be understood that any of<br>
the arrangements set forth hereinbefore could be utilized.<br>
[0025] The foregoing coupling embodiments are, as noted, constructed from a single<br>
piece of material and machined. Such a machining process was not heretofore available to<br>
the art because it is common knowledge that deep inside machining requires supported<br>
cutting tools. Such a supported cutting tool could not be employed for the couplings hereof<br>
due to end diameter versus inside machining diameters of the proposed couplings. More<br>
specifically, the cutting tool utilized must be able to fit through at least one end inside<br>
diameter and be sufficiently long to machine the deep structure of the convolution. Utilizing<br>
an unsupported tool is known to be insufficient for such use due to chatter that invariably<br>
exists at an end cutting surface of any long cutting blade. Chatter would be wholly<br>
unacceptable for a coupling such as that disclosed herein because of the inherent stress riser<br>
effect of surface irregularity of a coupling made with a chattering cutter.<br>
[0026] One of ordinary skill in the art, in view of the foregoing will immediately<br>
conclude that a coupling such as those described herein could not be machined. The<br>
inventors hereof however, have developed a cutting tool that enables the machining of the<br>
coupling as described while avoiding chatter and the deleterious effects that accompany<br>
chatter. Referring to figure 9, the turning milling tool 200 is illustrated. The tool comprises a<br>
mounting shaft which is clearanced at 202. At an end of clearanced section 202 is a blade<br>
204 having a cutter 206 thereon. The blade 204 has a usable cutting length of/ and is<br>
unsupported. As the blade geometry and composition (cobalt or other having equivalent<br>
material properties) have sufficient strength and do not produce chatter, the full cut length of<br>
the blade is available for machining inside portions of the coupling 10. The turning tool 200<br>
is to be kept stationary while the coupling 10 is rotated to remove material therefrom, hi<br>
operation the entire blade lengthy must be less than an inside dimension of at least one end<br>
26 or 30 of the coupling 10, so that it can fit into the inside dimension of the coupling to<br>
machine the convolution(s). In a multiple convolution configuration, blade length y must<br>
also be less than inside dimensions at the root of each convolution so that the blade 204 may<br>
be passed through the coupling to reach and machine each convolution inside surface.<br>
[0027] In the making of inside surface of each convolution, the inside walls 60 and <br>
(see Figure 10) of each deep convolution are kept substantially parallel to one another and in<br>
a plane substantially perpendicular to an axis of the coupling 10 for ease of machining. At a<br>
tip end of deep convolutions however, the walls are radiused at 64 and 66. Also important to<br>
the method is that the cutter is narrower than the width of the convolution to facilitate the<br>
radiused comers 64 and 66 as shown by adjusting depth and linear movement of the cutter<br>
simultaneously. The angled surface or chamfer 42 illustrated in fig 4 is still relatively easy<br>
to machine and together with the compound radius outer surface 40, reduces stress and helps<br>
to optimize stress distribution.<br>
[0028] The tool discussed above is utilized in combination with a computer<br>
numerically controlled turning machine (not shown). The coupling in accordance with this<br>
disclosure will be turned from a single piece of coupling material, thus making the flexible<br>
coupling of a single piece unitary construction. Since the coupling 10 is a single piece<br>
unitary construction, it will have consistent material and fatigue properties throughout the<br>
material, the coupling 10 does not have welded parts, thus the coupling 10 does not have<br>
areas with inconsistent material and/or fatigue properties which are subject to failure. Gas<br>
nitriding further enhances the material properties and fatigue strength, while welding<br>
decreases the material properties and fatigue strength relative to the nominal heat treated<br>
properties. The operating life span of the coupling 10 is longer and more accurately<br>
predictable than the operating life span of those couplings that use welding, bonding or other<br>
attaching methods which affect the material and fatigue properties of the material. In<br>
addition, welded or bonded assemblies of prior art have been shown to have inconsistent<br>
levels of quality due to lack of repeatability of said joining processes. Moreover, due to the<br>
avoidance of heat generating attachment methods, the coupling hereof may be pre-heat<br>
treated (i.e., before machining) without risk of the benefit of that process being deleteriously<br>
affected by the later steps of construction of the coupling.<br>
[0029] Although the disclosed flexible coupling 10 has been described with respect to<br>
computer controlled turning, other methods of machining may be used so long as welding or<br>
other bonding methods that create stress risers are not used in the convolutions. These other<br>
methods of machining include, but are not limited to electro-discharge machining (EDM)<br>
and electrochemical machining (ECM).<br>
[0030] The use of the terms first, second, etc. do not denote any order or importance,<br>
but rather the terms first, second, etc. are used to distinguish one element from another.<br>
[0031] The couplings disclosed herein can also utilize an anti-flail bearing known to<br>
the art. The anti-flail bearing provides a back up centering device to preserve the centerline<br>
and allow for continued rotation in the unlikely event of a failure of one of the convolutions.<br>
The anti-flail bearing combines a high speed ball bearing that is made from carbon steels,<br>
corrosion resistant materials such as Cronidur 30, XD-15, XD-15NW, ceramics, corrosion<br>
resistant steel, and plastics and a special self lubricating liner system, incorporating<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE and other special fillers in a composite matrix, on the inner or<br>
outer diameter of the high speed bearing to allow for axial misalignment of the coupling<br>
during anti-flail operation. Anti-flail bearings in general are known to the art, the changes<br>
relative to known systems that are used in this disclosure are related to materials which have<br>
been found to perform in a superior manner.<br>
[0032] While the disclosed apparatus and method has been described with reference<br>
to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without<br>
departing from the scope of the disclosed apparatus and method. In addition, many<br>
modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the<br>
disclosed apparatus and method without departing from the essential scope thereof.<br>
Therefore, it is intended that the disclosed apparatus and method not be limited to the<br>
particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this<br>
disclosed apparatus and method, but that the disclosed apparatus and method will include all<br>
