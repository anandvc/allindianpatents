CATALYSTS AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pi Rid of thft Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel catalyst and a process for preparing it.  More particularly, it relates to a catalyst suitable for use in the production of acrylic acid by catalytic oxidation of acrolein in gas phase with molecular oxygen, and to a process for preparing the catalyst. Prioc Art:<br>
Catalysts for producing acrylic acid by catalytic oxidation of acrolein in gas phase are described in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 41-1775 (1965) and 44-12129 (1969).<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laying Open No. 47-8360 (1972) describes a catalyst comprising antimony, molybdenum, vanadium and tungsten as essential components and a trace amount of copper. Further, Japanese Patent Application Laying Open NO". 48-96514 (1973) discloses a catalyst comprising molybdenum, vanadium, tungsten and tin as essential components and optionally antimony and/or copper.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laying Open Nos. 51-11709 (1976), 52-23589 (1977), 52-153889 (1977), 58-166939 (1983) and 3-218334 (1991) disclose a catalyst comprising copper, tin, antimony and chromium as   optional components; a catalyst containing an antimony-nickel compound; a coated catalyst containing copper and antimony as optional components; a ring catalyst containing copper and antimony as optional components; and a high-yield, high-productivity catalyst, respectively.  Although some of these catalysts have been manufactured on a commercial scale and used in<br><br>
the production of acrylic acid, the productivity thereof is not always satisfactory.  There has recently been an increasing need for a catalyst with a higher productivity as the demand for acrylic acid is increased.<br>
In recent years, an increased amount of acrolein supplied per unit volume of a catalyst ("high load condition") has been used to improve the productivity in the production of acrylic acid by catalytic oxidation of acrolein in gas phase.  Since the oxidizing reaction of acrolein is exothermic, hot spots are created due to increased heat accompanied with the increased amount of acrolein. These hot spots tend to cause entrainment of, for example, molybdenum which is most frequently used as the element constituting a catalytically active component.<br>
If a catalyst used in this reaction is prepared by compression, extrusion or coating, and if the mechanical strength of the catalyst is low, powders of broken or peeled catalytically active component may clog a reaction vessel upon being filled with the catalyst, resulting in abnormal pressure rise of the reaction vessel.  Therefore, it is desirable for a compressed, extruded or coated catalyst to have excellent mechanical strength such as attrition resistance.<br>
SUI&gt;^MARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the cat --ilyst of the present invention, the atomic ratios of respective riements in the catalytically active component represented by '-he formula (1) are as aforementioned and are preferably 2<as and></as>
0<g .></g>
The cataly-t of the present invention may be prepared by drying an aqueous solution or dispersion containing the metallic elements consti'-uting the catalytically active component or their compounds, calc-ni^^g the resulting dried powder, and optionally shaping the cal'-ined powder.<br>
The compou--ds of the catalytically active elements used in the present inv-ntion are not particularly lirrflted provided that<br><br>
they can be converted into oxides upon calcination, and may include chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, ammonium salts and oxides of the catalytically active elements.  Illustrative examples of the compounds which may be used include molybdenum trioxide and molybdic acid or salts thereof as molybdenum compounds; vanadium pentaoxide, vanadyl sulfate and vanadic acid or salts thereof as vanadium compounds; tungstic acid or salts thereof as tungsten compounds; and copper oxide, copper sulfate, copper nitrate and copper molybdate as copper compounds.  Illustrative examples of antimony compounds which may be used include antimony trioxide, antimony pentaoxide, antimony acetate and antimony trichloride. Among these antimony compounds, antimony trioxide is preferred and this is preferably used as it is without chemical treatment.  This means that there is not used any chemical treatment for facilitating dissolution or dispersion of antimony trioxide in water, for example, by contacting it with an acid such as nitric or sulfuric acid, an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, or an alkali.  Antimony trioxide is preferably used in the form of fine powder.<br>
The compounds of catalytically active elements may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more compounds.<br>
In the preparation of the catalyst of the present invention, an aqueous solution or dispersion containing the catalytically active elements or their compounds is first prepared.  This aqueous solution or dispersion is hereinafter referred simply as "slurry solution" unless otherwise specified.  According to the present invention, the slurry solution is preferably an aqueous solution.  The content of each catalytically active element or compound thereof in the slurry solution is not particularly<br><br>
limited so long as the atomic ratios of the respective catalytically active elements fall within the above specified ranges.  The amount of water used is not particularly limited provided that all the elements and/or compounds can be completely dissolved or uniformly mixed.  The amount of water may be suitably determined in view of the below mentioned drying step and temperature and usually is in the range of 200 to 2,000 parts by weight based on 100 parts of the total weight of the compounds. If the amount of water is too low, all the compounds can not be completely dissolved or uniformly mixed.  Too much water may lead to problems of energy cost of the drying step or incomplete drying.<br>
The uniformly mixed slurry solution is then dried.  Methods for drying are not particularly limited so long as the slurry solution can be dried and a powdery product can be obtained, and may include for example drum," freeze and spray drying.  Among these methods spray drying is preferred in the present invention since the slurry solution is dried to a powdery state in a short period of time.  The drying temperature may depend upon the concentration and feed rate of the slurry solution and the temperature at the outlet of a dryer is generally 85 to 130°C. Preferably, the drying is carried out such that the resulting dried powder has an average particle size of 20 to 60 [im.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention can be obtained by calcining the dried powder at 200 to 600°C for 1 to 15 hours and optionally grinding the calcined powder, which is preferably shaped in a below mentioned manner.  When the shaping step is carried out, the calcination may be preferably carried out in two steps, i.e., pre-calcination prior to the shaping step and post"-<br><br>
calcination after the shaping step.  The metnoa tor calcination may be any of known methods and is not particularly limited.<br>
The process for preparing the catalyst employing the shaping step is carried out, for example, as mentioned below.  The pre-calcination is generally carried out at a temperature of 250 to 500°C, preferably 300 to 450°C, for 1 to 15 hours, preferably 3 to 6 hours.  The pre-calcination step prevents degradation and peeling of the catalytically active component when the finished shaped catalyst is filled in a reaction vessel; that is, a shaped catalyst with less attrition can be obtained.<br>
The thus preliminarily calcined granule, hereinafter referred to as "pre-calcined granule" unless otherwise specified, is then shaped directly or optionally after grinding.  If those pre-calcined granules or optionally ground powders which show an electric conductivity of 100 to 2,000 ^iS/cm, preferably 500 to 1,500 |lS/cm, as measured in a mixture of 5 g of the granule or powder and 75 y  of pure water after stirred at 0 to 15°C for 5 minutes, are used, there is obtained a high performance catalyst with a very high activity and less attrition.<br>
The catalyst which has high catalysis activity is obtained by<br>
the pre-calcination as mentioned before.  Preferably, however, the<br>
pre-calcined granule is used after shaping.  Upon shaping, the<br>
pre-calcined granule, optionally mixed with a binder, may be (A)<br>
compressed, (B) mixed with a shaping aid, such as silica gel,<br>
diatomaceous earth or alumina powder, and extruded into a<br>
spherical or ring shape, or (C) coated on a spherical carrier,<br>
such as silicon carbide, alumina, mullite or alundum, having a<br>
-jj	*.„„ ^^ o i; +. ^ TH n,m K\7 -t-nmhlfa nr;i nil 1 at 1 OH and SO on .<br><br>
The binder used may include water, ethanol, a high molecular weight binder such as polyvinyl alcohol, and an inorganic binder such as aqueous silica sol solution.  Alcohols including diols, such as ethylene glycol, and triols, such as glycerin, are preferably used with glycerin being particularly preferred.  The alcohols may be directly used but aqueous alcohol solutions having a concentration of 10% by weight or higher are effective to provide a high performance catalyst.<br>
The amount of binder used is generally 10 to 50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the pre-calcined granule.<br>
Optionally, a shaping aid, such as silica gel, diatomaceous earth or alumina powder, may also be used.  The amount of shaping aid used is generally 5 to 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the pre-calcined powder.  Further, use of a reinforcing material, such as ceramic fiber or whisker, is useful to improve the mechanical strength of the catalyst.  However, fibers such as potassium titanate whisker and basic magnesium carbonate whisker are not preferable since they are reactive with the catalytic component(s).  The amount of fibers used is generally 1 to 30 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the pre-calcined granule.<br>
When used, the shaping aid and reinforcing material are generally mixed with the pre-calcined granule.  The binder may be mixed with the pre-calcined granule, or may be added to a shaping machine prior to, simultaneously with or after the addition of the pre-calcined granule.<br>
Among the shaping methods, the tumble granulation (C) is preferred as previously mentioned.  Illustratively, into an apparatus having a stationary vessel and a planar or uneven dis"k<br><br>
provided in the bottom of the vessel, a carrier is added.  The carrier is vigorously stirred due to repeated rotation and revolution when the disk is rotated at a high speed.  A mixture of the binder, the pre-calcined granule, and the optional shaping aid and reinforcing material is added to coat the carrier with the mixture.  The binder may be (1) preliminarily mixed with the mixture, (2) added into the stationary vessel simultaneously with the addition of the mixture, (3) added after the addition of the mixture, or (4)   added prior to the addition of the mixture; or (5) both the binder and the mixture may be divided into two or more portions and the portions are added in any combined manner of (2) to (4) above.  In the manner (5), it is preferred to use for example an autofeeder to adjust the addition rate so that, for example, any mixture does not adhere to the vessel wall or any mass composed of only the mixture is not formed.<br>
Illustrative examples of the carriers which may be used in the method (C) include spherical carriers, such as silicon carbide, alumina, mullite and alundum, having a diameter of 2.5 to 10 mm.  Among these carriers, those having a porosity of 30 to 50% and a water absorption of 10 to 30% are preferably used.  The carrier is generally used in an amount such that the ratio of the pre-calcined granule to the total weight of the pre-calcined granule plus the carrier is 10 to 75% by weight, preferably 15 to 50% by weight.<br>
The shaped product of the pre-calcined granule obtained by the the aforementioned method (A) to (C) may preferably have a diameter of 2 to 10 mm and a height of 3 to 20 mm in the case of a cylindrical shape or a diameter of 3 to 15 mm in the case of a spherical shape.<br><br>
The catalyst may be obtained by post-calcining the shaped product of the pre-calcined granule.  The post-calcination is generally carried out at a temperature of 250 to 500°C, preferably 300 to 450°C, for 1 to 50 hours.  According to the present invention, the shaped product obtained by post-calcination (hereinafter referred to as "shaped catalyst") shows the strongest peak at 22.2±0.3° (29) in X-ray diffractometry with Cu-Ka line of<br>
the catalytically active component, and the intensity of this strongest peak is at least identical with, preferably at least 1.6 times, more preferably at least 2 times, most preferably at least 4 times, the intensity of any other peak.  The symbol 26 herein means a double value of an angle of diffraction (G) in the X-ray diffractometry.  The other peaks appear at values of 20 other than 22.2±0.3° and may include peaks originating from molybdenum oxide as described in for example ASTM (American Society for Testing Material) cards 5-508, 21-569, 35-609 and 37-1445, as well as peaks originating from compounds in which molybdenum oxide is partially substituted with at least one of the catalytically active elements of the present invention, such as vanadium, tungsten and antimony, and compounds of the catalytically active elements used as starting materials.  In the X-ray diffractometry of a shaped catalyst, the strongest peak may sometimes originate from alumina used as a carrier or an optional reinforcing material.  These peaks are not taken into consideration in the present invention.  In order to obtain a shaped catalyst having such a specific X-ray diffraction pattern as above mentioned, it is preferable to use a pre-calcined granule which shows same characteristics with those obtained after post-calcination in the X-ray diffractometry in the same manner.<br><br>
In the shaped catalyst according to the present invention, it is preferred that the total volume of pores having a diameter of 0.01 to 200 ^im is 0.01 to 1.0 ml/g, preferably 0.01 to 0.4 ml/g,<br>
and the specific surface area is 0.5 to 10 m^/g, preferably 1.0 to 5.0 m^/g.  The pore distribution is preferably such that the volumes of pores having a diameter in the range of from 0.01 to 0.1 |lm, from 0.1 to 1 |J,m, from 1 to 10 ^Im, and from 10 to 200 ^Im<br>
are at most 20%, at most 30%, at least 40%, and at most 50%, respectively, based on the total volume of said pores having a diameter in the range of from 0.01 to 200 ^m in the catalyst.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention has a higher activity at lower temperatures and a higher selectivity of acrylic acid as compared with conventional ones and, therefore, can be used in the reaction under high load conditions.  Further, the catalyst has excellent attrition resistance and a very great commercial value.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail by way of the following examples and comparative examples.  However, the present invention is not limited to the following examples unless departing from the scope thereof as defined in the attached claims.<br>
In the following examples and comparative examples, all parts are by weight and the acrolein conversion (% by mole), acrylic acid selectivity {% by mole) and acrylic acid yield (%) are defined by the following equations (2) to (4), respectively:<br>
(2)	Acrolein conversion (mole %) =<br>
100 x (acrolein reacted in mole)/(acrolein supplied in mole)<br>
(3)	Acrylic acid selectivity (mole %) =<br>
100 X (acrylic acid produced in mole)/(acrolein converted in mole)<br><br>
(4)	Acrylic acid yield (%) =<br>
100 X (acrylic acid produced in mole)/(acrolein supplied in mole)<br>
The X-ray diffraction was measured by using JDX-7F from JEOL LTD. or INT-llOOV from RIGAKU.<br>
The pore distribution was measured by using a mercury porosimeter Poresizer 9320 from MICROMERITICS.<br>
The attrition resistance was measured by an attrition resistance tester from KAYAGAKI IRIKA KOGYO.  A catalyst sample was rotated at 25 rpm for 10 minutes and passed through a 2.36 mm standard sieve.  The weight of catalyst remaining on the sieve was measured and the attrition resistance (% by weight) was determined by the following equation (5) :<br>
(5)	Attrition resistance (wt %) =<br>
100 X (sample weight - weight of residual catalyst on 2.36 mm sieve)/(sample weight)<br>
The electric conductivity was determined by dispersing 5 g of a sample in 75 g of pure water, stirring for 5 minytes, and measuring the conductivity by CM-20S from TOA Electronics Ltd. Example I:<br>
To a formulating tank (A) equipped with a stirring motor, 600 parts of deionized water at 95°C and 16.26 parts of ammonium tungstate were added and stirred.  Then, 18.22 parts of ammonium metavanadate and 110 parts of ammonium molybdate were dissolved. Further, 3.78 parts of antimony trioxide powder were added.  Into a formulating tank (B) containing 96 parts of deionized water, 15.56 parts of copper sulfate were dissolved and the resulting solution was added to the formulating tank (A) to form a slurry solution.  The slurry solution was dried in a spray drier while adjusting the feed rate such that the temperature at the outlet of the drier was about 100°C.  The resulting granule was placed in a<br><br>
furnace at room temperature and the temperature of the furnace was raised at a rate of about 60°C per hour.  Then, the granule was pre-calcined at 390°C for about 5 hours.  The 26 values in the X-<br>
ray diffractometry of the pre-calcined granule were measured and a main peak at 22.2° and a second largest peak at 27.0° were observed where the intensity ratio was 100:23.  The results of measurement of the 20 values in the X-ray diffractometry are shown<br>
