				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to emulsified fuels which are temperature stable up to above 70°C and down to less than -10°C, in particular automobile fuels intended for use in internal combustion engines. More precisely, the fuels envisaged here contain a major part of a liquid hydrocarbon, and notably:<br>
those of inorganic origin such as petroleum derivatives of the gasoline, gas-oil, kerosene, fuel-oil type and/or such as derivatives of coal or gas (synthetic fuels).<br>
-	those of vegetable origin such as vegetable oils<br>
and esters thereof,<br>
-	and their mixtures, to which optionally oxygenated<br>
compounds such as the mono-and poly-alcohols have been<br>
added.<br>
The present invention more specifically covers the composition of the fuels constituted by water/liquid hydrocarbon emulsions, preferably water/Diesel fuel emulsions, that are economically valuable and which limit problems of environmental pollution. Below, we shall discuss stabilised water/hydrocarbon emulsions, comprising surfactants suitable for favoring and maintaining the emulsions stable for temperature variations between -10°C and greater than 70°C.<br>
Water very quickly appeared to be a valuable additive or partial substitutuent for gasoline or Diesel fuel, as it is inexpensive and non-toxic, allowing reduction of specific fuel consumption and emission of poluants whether visible or not.<br><br>
Despite all these presumed advantages, very few water/hydrocarbon fuels have been produced industrially and distributed on a wide scale to fuel consumers.<br>
Among all the tests carried out, it has been envisaged to provide for separate storage of water and automobile fuel on the vehicle, for mixing prior to injection into the running engine. This approach required a complex and sophisticated device for mixing and metering out each component of the mixture to be implemented on board the vehicle. It became clear that the cost, bulk and fragility of such devices made development of this approach completely dissuasive.<br>
A second approach consisted in storing the pre-metered mixture of water and fuel, but the distributor soon encountered problems of stability during storage of such mixtures in the temperature ranges varying from -20°C to 70°C, and the automobile owner met with the problems of stability of this mixture in the gasoline tank.<br>
Consequently, numerous fruitless technical propositions exist which in vain set out to provide emulsified fuels comprising water and, more generally, new and non-polluting fuels, leading to a low specific consumption.<br>
As illustration of this state-of-the-art, we can cite French Patent application 2,470,153 which discloses an emulsified fuel, comprising hydrocarbons, and water, and alcohol (methanol, ethanol) and an emulsifying system formed  by  sorbitan  mono-oleate  and  by  ethoxylated nonylphenol. The concentration of the emulsifying system in the emulsion is comprised between 3 and 10% by volume. The indispensable presence of alcohol in this emulsion, constitutes an extremely penalizing element, notably in<br><br>
view of the economies and engine performance obtainable with this emulsion. Additionally, it should be noted that the stability of this water-alcohol/hydrocarbon emulsion has not demonstrated its effectiveness. Indeed, after 72 hours storage of the emulsion, corresponding to a realistic period of non-use of a vehicle operating with this fuel, signs of phase separation (dephasing/de-mixing) can be seen between the hydrocarbons and the hydro-alcoholic mixture. The de-phased (separated) hydrocarbons at the end of this period can make up up to 3 percent by volume of the emulsion. One can readily imagine that after a few days storage, phase separation of the emulsions in French patent application 2,470,153 will be sufficiently great to make them unsuitable for use, under normal conditions of application.<br>
Additionally, from United States Patent 4,877,414, an emulsified fuel is known that includes a certain number of additives,  including an emulsifying system formed by a sorbitan sesquioleate, sorbitan mono-oleate, and polyoxyethylene  (6  EO)  ether of  dodecylalcohol. Preferably, according to that patent, total concentration of all additives is around 2.1 per cent. Apart from the emulsifying  system,  the  other additives  able  to be<br>
employed can be: a mono-α-olefin (decene-1), methoxymethanol, toluene, and alkyl benzene and calcium hydroxides. This formula is extremely complex, if only in view of the number of additives employed. It is additionally relatively expensive. Finally, the emulsified fuel according to that patent also itself suffers from a lack of stability, particularly at low temperatures. Applicant has further clearly brought this to light by reproducing the preferred example of implementation of the emulsified fuel according to this<br><br>
US patent. It was found that the emulsion separated (suffered phase separation) in one hour. The phenomenon is further accentuated at low temperature, below 5°C. One could hardly dare imagine what could happen in an automobile gasoline tank containing this emulsion under strong winter conditions.<br>
The abstract of Japanese Patent 77 - 69909 given in Chemical Abstracts 87: 138513 x, relates to an emulsified fuel (kerosene: water) comprising sorbitan sesquiolate and polyethylene glycol ether of nonylphenol as emulsifiers. The size of the dispersed aqueous phase is 
A further Chemical Abstract No. 101: 57568 z, summarizing Brazilian Patent 82 4 947 covers an emulsified fuel comprising hydrocarbons constituted by extremely viscose and heavy petroleum derivatives, water, ethanol and an emulsifier constituted by ethoxylated nonylphenol. This emulsified fuel is intended for use in ovens, conventional fuel oil burners. This fuel could not meet the expected performance specifications for combustion, pollution limitation and low consumption in light or heavy vehicle internal combustion engines. Additionally, this emulsion has poor physico-chemical stability.<br>
International application WO 97/34969, in the name of the applicant, discloses emulsified fuels which the present invention sets out to improve.<br><br>
These  emulsified  fuels,  which can be  automobile fuels,  comprise specific amounts of hydrocarbon and a minor amount of a set of additives including, notably, an emulsifying  system  comprising  at  least  one  sorbitol ester, at least one polyalcoxylated fatty acid ester of HLB greater  than or equal  to  9,  and at  least  one polyalcoxylated alkylphenol of HLB comprised between 10 and 15,  the respective concentration ratios of these components varying from 2.5 - 3.5; 1.5 - 2.5; 0.5 - 1.9. The  dispersed  phase  of  these  emulsified  fuels  is constituted by water present in an amount of 5 - 35% by weight while the additives are present in amount of 0.1 to 2% by weight. These fuels are particularly stable over storage times of at least three months. Nevertheless, it has been noted that when used in vehicles in which the fuel gets heated up prior or during the injection phase, before introduction into the carburettor,  and when a portion is sent back to the gasoline tank after passage through a filter reaching temperatures close to 75°C, the emulsified  fuel  separated  out  into  two  water  and hydrocarbon phases. Thus, a bus which had been stopped over the weekend could not start again on the Monday morning,  all  of  the  fuel  having  decanted.  This decantation  phenomenon  of  the  emulsified  fuels  is accentuated when a high-pressure supply system is used, favoring temperature increase. In particular, in all the new direct injection diesel engine technologies equipping all new heavy goods vehicles and an increasingly large percentage of new light vehicles, fuels are heated to a temperature greater than 70°C.<br>
The performance of these known emulsified fuels, in terms of temperature stability towards temperatures greater than 75°C and also at -20°C can most certainly be<br><br><br>
improved to provide answers to the problems associated with their use under real conditions in a vehicle.<br>
The present invention provides an emulsified fuel that is stable for at least four days at more than 70°C, fuel stability when cold, in other words at -10°C or, yet again, during storage at up to 40°C being maintained over at least three months without untimely decantation. Additionally, the invention sets out to obtain an emulsified fuel which meets all government requirements as regards the environment. Thus, this involves, in particular, replacing the polyalcoxylated alkylphenols used in numerous emulsified fuels but which are not accepted by all administrations, by a compound or mixture of compounds which allow not only the same stability during storage for the emulsion to be obtained but which also provides improved stability at a temperature greater than 70°C, and also good stability in use over a simulated cycle between -10 and +20°C.<br>
The present invention consequently provides an emulsified fuel containing a major portion of hydrocarbon liquid and a minor portion of from 5 to 35% by weight water, containing a set of additives including an emulsifying system comprising:<br>
i) from 2.5 to 3.5 parts by weight of at least one sorbitol ester of formula (I) below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which the radicals X are identical or different and each correspond to a group selected from ORi groups,<br><br>
R1 being hydrogen or an aliphatic radical having 1-6 carbon atoms, and a R2-COO- group where R2 is hydrogen or a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, optionally substituted by at least one hydroxylated group and having 6-22 carbon atoms, at least one X radical corresponding to R2-COO-,<br>
ii) from 1.5 to 2.5 parts by weight of at least one polyalkoxylated fatty acid ester of formula (II) below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R3 is a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated  aliphatic  hydrocarbon  radical,  optionally substituted by at least one hydroxylated group and having from 6 to 22 carbon atoms, R4 is a linear or branched alkylene  group  having  from  1  to  10  carbon  atoms, preferably 2 to 3 carbon atoms, n is an integer greater than or equal to 6, preferably varying between 6 and 30, and R5 is hydrogen,  a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or is:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 R6 being identical to or different from R3,<br>
iii) from 0.5 to 2.0 parts by weight of at least one polyalkoxylated compound of general formula (III) below;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R9 and R10 are identical or different, linear or branched alkylene groups having 1-20 carbon atoms, R7 is linear or branched alkylene having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R8 is<br><br>
selected in the group consisting of hydrogen, linear or branched alkylene groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 R11 being a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic radical, optionally substituted by<br>
hydroxylated functions and having 6-22 carbon atoms, m<br><br>
 and p are integers varying respectively from 0-20 and<br>
from 3-10,<br>
the HLB of the emulsifying system varying from 6 to 8 .<br>
It has been noticed that, unexpectedly, introducing the compound of formula (III) in combination with the mixture of compounds of formula (I) and formula (II) considerably increased stability of emulsified fuel when the latter was maintained for more than three days, or sporadically, at temperatures greater than 50°C and even greater than 75°C, compared to the closest prior art constituted by International application WO 97/34969. In effect, the emulsion as implemented previously does separate into two phases as soon as the emulsion is brought to more than 50°C for more than 24 hours.<br>
In parallel, stability in use and stability during storage of the emulsions according to the invention are maintained, compared to the state-of-the-art.<br>
Such temperature stability greater than three days is obtained by introducing the emulsifying system at a concentration of at the most 2% by weight into the emulsified fuels. Obviously, it is always possible to introduce more emulsifying system into the fuel, but this is not necessary.<br>
Among the compounds of formula (I) , the preferred sorbitol esters are chosen from sorbitol oleates alone or in a mixture, sorbitol sesquioleate being preferred.<br>
The fatty acid esters of formula (II) are selected from oleates, stearates and ricinoleates of polyethylene glycol. The preferred esters are those in which the polyethylene glycol fraction has a molecular weight less than or equal to 600, and preferably less than 450.<br>
The polyalkoxylated compounds of formula (III) which ensure, in combination with the two other components of the emulsifying system, hot fuel stability, are chosen from di- and tri-alkylated iso alcohols, each alkyl radical having 1-15 carbon atoms, preferably from alcohols the alkyl radicals of which comprise from 5 to 12 carbon atoms. Preferably, they are chosen among iso tridecylic alcohols comprising from 3-10 ethoxylated groups.<br>
In the present invention, the hydrocarbonated liquid constituting the major proportion of the fuel is chosen from  the  group  consisting  of  gasolines,   medium distillates, synthetic fuels, animal or vegetable oils, whether or not esterified, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The emulsified fuel according to the invention additionally comprises, apart from the hydrocarbon phase, water and the emulsifying system, further additives such as cetane-improvers preferably chosen from peroxides and/or nitrates and mixtures thereof, , optionally, a metallic catalyst for soot post-combustion, said metal<br>
being one of those of the group constituted by magnesium,<br>
calcium, cerium, copper, iron or mixtures thereof and an and-freeze<br>

The examples below are given by way of illustration of the invention without limiting the scope thereof.<br>
Example 1<br>
This present example sets out to give the results for stability of the emulsified fuels of the invention, compared to results for the known art.<br>
There was consequently prepared, using methods described in International application WO 97/34969, several emulsions the compositions of which differed by the composition of their emulsifying system.<br>
For  the  purposes  of  comparison,  a  standard formulation was used for all the emulsions examined, obtained with a type EN 590 reference diesel fuel:<br>
13% by weight water containing biocide (2% by volume of the diesel fuel) and, optionally, 10% by weight monoethyleneglycol in winter formulations<br>
1% by volume of diesel fuel of an organic biocide 1.86% by weight of an emulsifying system and 1% by weight of a cetane-improver additive the remaining percentage by weight being the diesel fuel.<br>
Emulsifying system compositions are given in Table 1 below:<br><br>
TABLE   1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In this table, compositions A, C and F are compositions according to the invention, compositions B, D, E and N are comparative examples.<br>
Emulsion quality was evaluated on the basis of granulometry, storage stability regardless of ambient temperature, stability in use, stability in storage and temperature stability.<br>
By image analysis from micrographs, the homogeneous appearance of the water droplets dispersed in the continuous diesel fuel phase was characterised per their mean particle size and their distribution.<br>
Emulsions stability in use was characterised by an absence of demixing/decantation or other breakage of emulsion in a 1 litre beaker, that had undergone a stimulation cycle corresponding to the presumed recirculation cycle of a diesel fuel in an automobile fuel tank.<br>
By the term stimulating cycle, we mean a temperature cycle consisting in:<br>
-	bringing a sample down to a temperature of -10°C<br>
over one hour<br>
-	increasing sample temperature from -10°C to +40°C<br>
over 1 hour,<br>
-	and then dropping this temperature to +10°C over<br>
three hours,<br>
-	finally, bringing the temperature down to -10°C<br>
over 7 hours and keeping the sample at this temperature<br>
for one hour.<br>
We consider that demixing occurs during this stimulating cycle when, at the end of the cycle, the volume of supernatant liquid, the decanted diesel fuel, is greater than 5% by volume of the total sample volume<br>
or, yet again, when water appears at the bottom of the beaker.<br>
Storage stability is determined by absence of demixing/decantation after three months static storage in conical flasks, of three samples kept at, respectively, 0°C, 20°C and 40°C.<br>
In this case, demixing is characterised by separation into two separate phases which are not necessarily transparent.<br>
Hot stability is characterised by a complete absence of demixing/decantation after four days static storage at 75°C.<br>
For this latter stability, demixing is characterised by separation into two transparent phases.<br>
Stabilities were evaluated by the extent of time separating preparation of the emulsion and the time demixing/decantation occurred.  Depending on stability, this time is measured in hours (h) , days (d) , weeks (w) and months (m).<br>
The complete results are given in Table II below.<br><br>
TABLE   II<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It is seen from this table that stability in use and stability in storage of emulsifying systems A, C, F, and F' according to the invention are preserved when compared to emulsifying systems B, D, E and N according to International application WO 97/34969. Temperature stability is however greatly improved. It is also seen that the two formulations of the emulsifying systems according to this present application and to International application WO 97/34969 are much better than formulations G to M.<br><br><br><br><br>
