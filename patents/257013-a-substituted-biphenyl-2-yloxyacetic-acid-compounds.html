Certain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms. It<br>
will be understood that the invention encompasses all geometric and optical isomers of the<br>
compounds of formula (I) and mixtures thereof including racemates. Tautomers and mixtures<br>
thereof also form an aspect of the present invention.<br>
The compound of formula (I) above may be converted to a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt or solvate thereof, preferably a basic addition salt such as sodium, potassium,<br>
calcium, aluminium, lithium, magnesium, zinc, benzathine, chloroprocaine, choline,<br>
diethanolamine, ethanolamine, ethyldiamine, meglumine, tromethamine or procaine, or an<br>
acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, acetate, fumarate,<br>
maleate, tartrate, citrate, oxalate, methanesulphonate orp-toluenesulphonate.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes of the present<br>
invention certain functional groups in the starting reagents or intermediate compound may<br>
need to be protected by protecting groups. Thus, the preparation of the compound of formula<br>
(I) may involve, at an appropriate stage, the removal of one or more protecting groups. The<br>
protection and deprotection of functional groups is fully described in 'Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Chemistry', edited by J. W. F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and 'Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis', 3rd edition, T. W. Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wuts, Wiley-<br>
Interscience (1999).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula <br>
in which X, A, D and E are as defined in fixmula (I) or are protected derivatives <br>
Where R1 and R2 are as defined in formula (I) or are protected derivatives thereof, R9<br>
is H or Ci-Cio alkyl group and L is a leaving group, and optionally thereafter in any <br>
removing any protecting group<br>
• hydrolysing the ester group R9 to the corresponding acid<br>
• oxidation of sulphides to sulphoxides or sulphones<br>
• forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF using<br>
a base such as potassium carbonate or the like. Suitable groups R9 include Ci-e alkyl groups<br>
such as methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl. Suitable L is a leaving group such as tosylate or halo, in<br>
particular chlorine or bromine. L may also be hydroxy so that a Mitsunobw reaction may be<br>
performed with compound (EC) using for example triphenylphosphine and diethyl<br>
azodicarboxylate.<br>
Hydrolysis of the ester group R9 can be carried out using routine procedures, for<br>
example treatment of methyl and ethyl esters with aqueous sodium hydroxide, and treatment<br>
of tert-butyl esters with acids such as trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula<br>
(IV) with a compound of formula (V) via a Suzuki coupling reaction followed by deprotection<br>
ofR10:<br>
OR10 OR11<br>
in which X, A, D and E are as defined in fonnula (I) or are protected derivatives thereof, R10<br>
Ll is iodide, bromide,<br>
chloride or Inflate and R11 and R12 are H or alkyl groups or Rn and R12 together can<br>
form a 5 or 6 membered ring optionally substituted by one or more alkyl.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in a suitable solvent such as dioxane using a palladium<br>
catalyst such as [l,l-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium and abase such as<br>
cesium fluoride, preferably at elevated temperatures.<br>
When R10 is a protecting group such as benzyl it can be removed usin hydrogen with a<br>
suitable catalyst for example platinum or palladium on charcoal. If the group R10 is alkyl for<br>
eample methyl, then it can be cleaved using borontribromide in a suitable solvent such as<br>
dichloromethane.<br>
Some compounds of formula (IV) are commercially available. Certain compounds of<br>
formula (TV) can be prepared from a compound of formula (VI) by formation of an<br>
organometallic (YE) followed by reaction with a borate ester, as outlined in Scheme I.<br>
* (IV)<br>
Scheme I<br>
in which X, is as defined in formula (T) or are protected derivatives thereof, R10 is as defined<br>
in formula (IV), W is hydrogen or halogen and M is a metal such as Na or Li. For example<br>
when R10 is benzyl and E is bromine, butyl lithium can be used to form the intermediate C VH)<br>
where M = Li. The reaction is performed at -78°C hi diethylether, then quenched with a<br>
borate ester such as trimetiiyibonte.<br>
Compounds of formula (D) may also be prepared by reaction of a compound of<br>
formula (XI) with a compound of formula (XII) using Suznlti coupling methodology.<br>
in which X, A, D, E, R10, L1, R11 and R12 are as defined above and compounds of formula<br>
(XI) and (XII) can be made using the same methodology as above.<br>
The sequence of the steps above may be changed, for example a compound of formula<br>
(I) may be formed by the reaction of a compound of formula (XVT) with a compound of<br>
formula (Xn) using a Suzuki coupling.<br>
.<br>
Or, compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula<br>
(XVII) with a compound of    (Figure Removed)<br><br>
Where the groups A, D, E, L1, X, R1 and R2are as defined above or proteced drivates<br>
thereof. R13 is hydrogen or Ci-C6 alkyl for example methyl ethyl or tertiary butyl. If R13 is<br>
an ester group it is subsequently hydrolysed using either acidic or basic conditions, such as<br>
TFA or NaOH. Compounds of formula (XVD) can be prepared as outlined in<br>
WO2004089885 or by reacting a compound of formula (XVII) with bis(pinocolato)diboron<br>
Compounds of formula (XB) where the group E is SR can be synthesised by<br>
dispalcing the Fluorine with R5SNa in a suitable solvent such as DMF at 50°C. Compounds<br>
of formula (XIX) can be converted to the boronic acid using BuLi, then reacting with a<br>
borate ester as outlined previously. Alternatively the compounds of formula (XVH) can be<br>
prepared by a palladium catalysed coupling of compounds of formula (XIX) with a suitable<br>
boronic ester, for example bis(pinocolato)diboron.<br>
Compounds of formula (XDQ can also be prepared from compounds of formula (XX)<br>
where the chlorosulphonic acid is reduced to the thiol using triphenylphosphine, subsequently<br>
alkylated using an alkyl halide such as alkyl iodide or bromide.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) where the group E is amide can be prepared by method C:<br>
in which a compound of fixmnla. (Va) is coiivcarted to the ackl chloride using reageM such as<br>
oxalyl chloride and subsequently reacted with an amire in a suitable solvent soch as<br>
dkhkromethane. The group A, D and L1 arc as ddfaed for compounds of fbnmua(V) or<br>
ptotDced derivates thereof<br>
Compounds of fonrmla (Va) are commercially arailabk or m be readily svnttiesised using<br>
literature procedures by those skilled in the art<br>
Novel intermediates of the general formulae given above form a further aspect of the<br>
invention.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula<br>
(I), a prodrug, phannaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for use in therapy.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have activity as Pharmaceuticals, in particular as<br>
modulators of CRTh2 receptor activity, and may be used in the treatment (therapeutic or<br>
prophylactic) of conditions/diseases in human and non-human animals which are exacerbated<br>

 [3H]PGD2 was purchased from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences with a specific activity of<br>
100-210Ci/mmol. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.<br>
HEK cells expressing rhCRTh2 / Gal 6 were routinely maintained in DMEM<br>
containing 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (HyClone), Img/ml geneticin, 2mM L-glutamine aad<br>
1% non-essential amino acids. For the preparation of membranes, the adherent transfected<br>
HBKcells were grown to confluence in two layer tissue culture factories (Fisher, catalogue<br>
number TKT-170-070E). Maximal levels of receptor expression were induced by addition of<br>
SOOmM sodium butyrate for the last 18 hours of culture. The adherent cells were washed once<br>
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 50ml per cell factory) and detached by the addition of<br>
bacitracin]. Cefls were pdktedbycentnmgatkMi at 220kg fcr 10 minutes at 4°C, resuspended<br>
disrupted wing a Poiytron horaogeaicar far 2 x 20 second taste keeping me tube in ice at afl.<br>
times. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 220xg for 10 minutes at 4°C and<br>
the membrane fraction pelleted by centrifugation at 90000xg for 30 minutes at 4°C. The final<br>
pellet was re-suspended in 4 ml of membrane homogenisation buffer per cell factory used and<br>
the protein content determined. Membranes were stored at -80°C hi suitable aliquots.<br>
All assays were performed in Corning clear bottomed, white 96-well NBS plates<br>
(Fisher). Prior to assay, the HEK cells membranes containing CRTh2 were coated onto SPA<br>
PVT WGA beads (Amersham). For coating membranes were incubated with beads at<br>
typically 25 fig membrane protein per mg beads at 4°C with constant agitation overnight. (The<br>
optimum coating concentrations were determined for each batch of membranes) The beads<br>
were polluted by centrifugation (Sox for Minutes at 4°C), washed once with assay buffer<br>
(50mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing 5mM magnesium chloride) and finally re-suspended in<br>
assay buffer at a bead concentration of long/ml.<br>
Each assay contained 20yl of 6.25nM (HfJPGDz, 20} d membrane saturated SPA beads<br>
bom in assay buffer and loftily of compound solution or 13,14-dihydro-l 5-keto prostaglandin<br>
I2 (DK-PGE2, for determination of non-specific binding, Cayman chemical company).<br>
Compounds and DK-Pig were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in me same solvent<br>
to lox the required final concentration. Assay buffer was added to give a final concentration<br>
of 10% DMSO (compounds were now at lox the required final concentration) and miss was<br>
the solution added to the assay plate. The assay plate was incubated at room temperature For<br>
2 hours and counted on a Wallace Micro beta liquid scintillation counter (1 minute per well).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) have an Ices value of less than 10|iM.<br>
Specifically example 5 has a picot value of 8.75; example 11 has a picot value of <br>

Shape Change Assay<br>
DK-PGD2 [13,14-dihydro-15-keto Prostaglandin Eh] was obtained from Cayman<br>
Chemical (Michigan,USA). OptilyseB was from Immunities (Marseille, France). All other<br>
chemical reagents were of analytical grade from Fisher Scientific (Southborough, UK) or<br>
Sigma (Poole, UK).<br>
followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. Next, red blood cells were lysed by<br>
the addition of 1 mL of water and further incubation at room temperature for 45 min. The<br>
plate was centrifuged for 5 min at 375 x g, the supernatant was discarded and cells were<br>
resuspended in 400 ^L of assay buffer (Dulbecco's PBS without Ca2"1" and Mg2"1" supplemented<br>
with 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose and 0.1% BSA; pH 7.4). The fixed cells were<br>
transferred to tubes suitable for use with the flow cytometer.<br>
Shape change was determined using a Coulter FC500 flow cytometer, by measuring<br>
the ability of these cells to scatter light when illuminated. By gating the granulocyte region<br>
on the basis of their FS/SS profile, FL-2 was plotted against FL-1 identifying two populations<br>
of cells: neutrophils with low auto-fluorescence and eosinophils that showed higher natural<br>
autofluorescence. The eosinophil population is gated and changes in the median value in FS<br>
are recorded.<br>
Compounds were tested at final concentrations of 1 and 10 pM. These were dissolved<br>
in DMSO to give a 10 mM solution. Further dilutions were performed in 96-well<br>
polypropylene plates in assay buffer to give a 100 uM solution containing !%DMSO. An<br>
additional 1 in 10 dilution was made in assay buffer containing 1% DMSO. Both these<br>
solutions were diluted 1 in 10 into the assay mixture to give a final DMSO concentration of<br>
0.1% (v/v). Concentration response curves for DK-PGDa were constructed as a control ir<br>
each experiment. The efficacy of tested compounds was expressed as a fraction of the<br>
maximum response to PGDj.<br>
These compounds were considered antagonists when their efficacy ratio was lower<br>
than 0.25.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
