METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR MANAGING SHARED TASKS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
Embodiments of the present invention pertain to computer systems, and<br>
in particular to functions performed by computer systems that are<br>
communicatively linked.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There are many instances in which a group of people are each assigned a<br>
set of tasks, some of which are shared tasks that can be performed by one<br>
person on behalf of the whole group. For example, a group of people may all be<br>
traveling between the same two places to attend an out-of-town event. Typically,<br>
each person will need to make their own airline reservation and hotel<br>
reservation. However, each person does not need to make their own car<br>
reservation; instead, one person can reserve a car that can be used by other<br>
members of the group.<br>
As plans are made and tasks are completed, entering information about<br>
those plans into each person's calendar is both a time-consuming and duplicated<br>
effort. Conventional software applications such as personal information<br>
managers (PIMs) may facilitate managing a calendar, but they do not address<br>
these problems.<br>
In summary, there can be much duplication of effort in coordinating the<br>
efforts.of a group of people such as the group in the example above. As such,<br>
an improved method and/or system for managing shared tasks would be<br>
advantageous.<br>

WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set<br>
forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention.<br>
However, it will be recognized by one skilled in the art that the present invention<br>
may be practiced without these specific details or with equivalents thereof. In<br>
other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits<br>
have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Some portions of the detailed descriptions, which follow, are presented in<br>
terms of procedures, steps, iogic blocks, processing, and other symbolic<br>
representations of operations on data bits that can be performed on computer<br>
memory. These descriptions and representations are the means used by those<br>
skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of<br>
their work to others skilled in the art. A procedure, computer-executed step,<br>
logic block, process, etc., is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-<br>
consistent sequence of steps or instructions leading to a desired result. The<br>
steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually,<br>
though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of eiectricai or magnetic<br>
signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and<br>
otherwise manipulated in a computer system. It has proven convenient at times,<br>
principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values,<br>
elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.<br>
It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are<br>
to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely<br>
convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated<br>
4<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
oftherwise as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that<br>
throughout the present invention, discussions utilizing terms such as "receiving,"<br>
"updating," "placing," "verifying," "providing," "displaying," "reading," "writing,"<br>
"prompting," "causing" or the like, refer to the action and processes of a<br>
computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and<br>
transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the<br>
computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented<br>
as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other<br>
such information storage, transmission or display devices.<br>
Referring first to Figure 1, a block diagram of an exemplary computer<br>
system 112 is shown. It is appreciated that computer system 112 described<br>
herein illustrates an exemplary configuration of an operational platform upon<br>
which embodiments of the present invention can be implemented. Nevertheless,<br>
other computer systems with differing configurations can also be used in place of<br>
computer system 112 within the scope of the present invention. That is,<br>
computer system 112 can include elements other than those described in<br>
conjunction with Figure 1. Computer system 112 can be, but is not limited to, a<br>
desktop, laptop or handheld computer system, a personai digital assistant (PDA),<br>
a cell phone, or a pager device.<br>
Computer system 112 includes an address/data bus 100 for<br>
communicating information, a central processor 101 coupled with bus 100 for<br>
processing information and instructions; a volatile memory unit 102 (e.g., random<br>
access memory [RAM], static RAM, dynamic RAM, etc.) coupled with bus 100 for<br>
storing information and instructions for central processor 101; and a non-volatile<br>
memory unit 103 (e.g., read oniy memory [ROM], programmable ROM, flash<br>
5<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
memory, etc.) coupled with bus 100 for storing static information and instructions<br>
for processor 101. Computer system 112 may also contain an optional display<br>
device 105 coupled to bus 100 for displaying information to the computer user.<br>
Moreover, computer system 112 also includes a data storage device 104 (e.g.,<br>
disk drive) for storing information and instructions.<br>
Also included in computer system 112 is an optional alphanumeric input<br>
device 106. Device 106 can communicate information and command selections<br>
to central processor 101. Computer system 112 also includes an optional cursor<br>
control or directing device 107 coupled to bus 100 for communicating user input<br>
information and command selections to central processor 101. Computer<br>
system 112 also includes signal communication interface (input/output device)<br>
108, which is also coupled to bus 100, and can be a serial port. Communication<br>
interface 108 may also include wireless communication mechanisms. Using<br>
communication interface 108, computer system 112 can be communicatively<br>
coupled to other computer systems over a communication network such as the<br>
Internet or an intranet (e.g., a local area network).<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram snowing a number of different types of<br>
devices in communication with each other and upon which embodiments of the<br>
present invention may be implemented. The example of Figure 2 includes client<br>
devices 200 and 210, servers 230 and 240, and a server referred to herein as an<br>
intelligent scheduling server (ISS) 250. There may be more of such devices, and<br>
there may be types of devices different from those shown. The functionality<br>
provided by ISS 250 may be incorporated within the server 230 and/or the server<br>
240. Each of the devices in Figure 2 can be exemplified as computer system<br>
6<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
112 of Figure 1. Each of the client devices 200 and 210 can be uniquely<br>
associated with a respective user.<br>
The devices of Figure 2 communicate with each other via communication<br>
network 220. Communication network 220 represents a collection of wireless<br>
and/or wired elements that can include, but are not limited to, a local area<br>
network, a wide area network, the Internet, and an intranet.<br>
In one embodiment, the client devices 200 and 210 include intelligent<br>
scheduling clients (ISCs) 203 and 213, respectively. In one such embodiment,<br>
the client devices 200 and 210 also include personal information managers<br>
(PIMs) 204 and 214, respectively. The functionality and features of ISCs 203<br>
and 213 are described further below by way of example. The functionality and<br>
features of PIMs are known in the art. In general, PIMs 204 and 214 are<br>
software applications that help users organize information. For example, various<br>
kinds of text-based notes (e.g., reminders, lists, dates) can be entered and linked<br>
using a PIM such as PIMs 204 and 214. PIMs 204 and 214 can also include<br>
calendar, scheduling, and calculator programs, for example.<br>
In one embodiment, ISS 250 includes a voice system (e.g., an interactive<br>
voice response system) 252. Voice system 252 allows exchanges of information<br>
to occur using, for example, a telephone, but without human interaction.<br>
In one embodiment, the templates 205 and 215 include a group of related<br>
tasks. For simplicity of discussion, the group of related tasks may be collectively<br>
referred to herein as an event. More precisely, there may be an event, with one<br>
or more tasks related to the event. The templates of the present invention may<br>
7<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
be pre-built templates that can be modified (customized) according to the<br>
particular event, or new templates-can be generated when necessary or<br>
desirable.<br>
For each task in a template, there can be one or more common fields that<br>
are shared across the templates 205 and 215 and hence shared across users,<br>
and there can be one or more individual fields that are specific to a user. The<br>
fields specific to a user can be automatically filled in using information retrieved<br>
from memory, by a respective PIM or by a respective ISC.<br>
Within the templates 205 and 215, a task can be identified as being a<br>
shared task or an individual task. As used herein, a shared task refers to a task<br>
that can be performed by one user on behalf of one or more other users, and an<br>
individual task refers to a task that is performed individually by each user. Note<br>
that multiple users may be assigned the same individual task; for example, each<br>
user may have to make an airline reservation. Thus, while it may be said that<br>
the users have a common task to perform, that in-common task may not be a<br>
shared task.<br>
According to embodiments of the present invention, templates 205 and<br>
215 are used to facilitate the management of related events or tasks, including<br>
tasks that are shared by a group of people, in particular shared tasks that can be<br>
performed by one person in the group on behalf of some or all of the people in<br>
the group. In one embodiment, the ISCs 203 and 213 each send tasks to ISS<br>
250 in the form of the templates 205 and 215, respectively, and ISS 250<br>
communicates the results of performing the task to the requesting ISC 203 and<br>
8<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
213. In one embodiment, ISC 203 can also communicate with ISC 213, and vice<br>
versa.<br>
The use of templates 205 and 215 to facilitate the management of shared<br>
tasks is described further by way of the following examples. In one example, a<br>
group of people may all be traveling between the same two places to attend an<br>
out-of-town event. Typically, each person will need to make their own airline<br>
reservation and hotel reservation. However, each person does not need to make<br>
their own car reservation; instead, one person can reserve a car that can be<br>
used by the entire group.<br>
According to embodiments of the present invention, either a member of<br>
the group or someone else (e.g., an administrative assistant) generates a<br>
template for the event, either creating a new template or modifying an existing<br>
template. The template will list the various tasks that need to be performed, and<br>
will indicate which tasks are shared tasks and which tasks are individual tasks.<br>
The template can also identify, for each shared task, a lead individual who has<br>
responsibility for performing or completing the shared task.<br>
A template is distributed to each member of the group. More precisely, a<br>
template is sent to a respective device (e.g., client device 200 or 210) associated<br>
with a member of the group, so that each member has access to the template.<br>
In one embodiment, the template includes fields that are specific to each<br>
user, such as, but not limited to, name, phone number and credit card number.<br>
As mentioned above, some or all of the fields in the template can then be filled<br>
with information extracted from device memory by either a PIM or an ICS.<br>
9<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
Also, the ISC can use the information in the template to update each<br>
user's PIM. For example, the template may specify the dates over which an out-<br>
of-town trip will occur, and those dates can be added to the calendar maintained<br>
by the user's PIM.<br>
In addition, the ISC can schedule each task in the user's PIM. That is, for<br>
example, the template may include a list of tasks with associated due dates, and<br>
these tasks and due dates can be added to the calendar maintained by the<br>
user's PIM.<br>
As a template is updated (e.g., with user information, or with task updates<br>
as described below), it can be updated at the devices of other users as well.<br>
That is, for example, as information is entered into template 205 on client device<br>
200, template 215 can be updated on client device 210. Of course, confidential<br>
information, or information that is designated as not to be shared, can be<br>
prevented from being included in a template at another device. That is, for<br>
example, if a credit card number is entered into template 205, that credit card<br>
number can remain private to client device 205, and is not shared with the other<br>
client devices. If, however, non-private information is entered into template 205,<br>
that information can be updated in the templates residing on the devices<br>
belonging to the other group members.<br>
As mentioned above, the list of tasks contained in the template may<br>
include a shared task, such as renting a car. Once the shared task has been<br>
completed, the template is updated on all of the group's devices to show that this<br>
task has been performed. The template can also be updated to show additional<br>
10<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
information related to the completed task. For example, for a car rental task, the<br>
template can be updated to show details associated with the rental.<br>
Also, once an individual task is completed, the template can be updated<br>
on all of the group's devices. In an environment where multiple people are<br>
performing tasks, information showing each person's progress on the tasks can<br>
be valuable. Also, as mentioned above, the template can be updated to provide<br>
details associated with the completed task. If, for example, one person has<br>
already sought out and booked an acceptable airline reservation, the particulars<br>
of the reservation can be shared with the other members of the group.<br>
In some instances, the updating of templates can be driven by the ISC of<br>
the user that completed the shared task. In other instances, the updating of<br>
templates can be driven by ISS 250. If, for example, a user completes a<br>
particular task and indicates such in the template, then the ISC associated with<br>
that user can drive the update. If, one the other hand, the task is.completed by<br>
or through ISS 250 (as described in the examples below), then ISS 250 can drive<br>
the update.<br>
When a task - either a shared task or an individual task - is shown in a<br>
template as being completed, the user's PIM can be updated as well. For<br>
example, an individual task that is listed in the template may have also been<br>
scheduled into a user's PIM (e.g., call person A at 4:00). Once the user has<br>
completed that task and updated the template to reflect that, the user's PIM can<br>
also be updated, removing that task from the PIM. In a similar manner, the user<br>
can instead update the PIM to show that the task is completed, and the PIM in<br>
11<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
turn can update the template, which in turn causes the templates at other<br>
devices to be updated.<br>
In one embodiment, the ICS of the present invention is integrated with a<br>
voice-capable system such as voice system 252 of ISS 250. Alternatively, the<br>
voice-capable system may reside on the client device. Also, the voice-capable<br>
system may have text-to-speech (TTS) capability. Using a voice-capable<br>
system, some tasks listed in the template can be performed using some<br>
combination of pre-recorded speech and TTS. For example, ICS 203 on client<br>
device 200 can initiate a phone call to a hotel to make a reservation. An<br>
introductory portion of a message to the hotei can be pre-recorded (e.g., "I would<br>
like to make a reservation and my name is ..."); TTS can then be used to read<br>
the user's name from the appropriate field in the template and to convert the<br>
name into speech. If a need arises for human intervention, then ICS 203 can<br>
prompt the client device 200 to alert the user.<br>
The example of the preceding paragraph can be extended to Web-based<br>
applications as well. For example, ICS 203 can contact a hotel Web site on<br>
server 230 to make a reservation, information in template 205 can be<br>
transferred to the appropriate fields in the hotel's Web page in order to place the<br>
reservation. The template may even contain fields indicating user preferences<br>
(e.g., for a non-smoking room) that can be transferred from the template to the<br>
Web page.<br>
Some tasks may have external dependencies. For example, a task to<br>
make a dinner reservation may be set up in template 205. Completing such a<br>
task typically will require that the restaurant be contacted during its business<br>
12<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
hours (that is, while it is open). !n one embodiment, an ICS (e.g., ICS 203) can<br>
prompt a search of available information sources to identify the restaurant's<br>
business hours. For example, by browsing the Internet, a Web page for the<br>
restaurant may be located, the Web page can be crawled to determine when the<br>
restaurant is open, and this information can be loaded into the template 205 or<br>
otherwise provided to the user.<br>
Information accessed and retrieved as described in the example above<br>
can also be used to verify the feasibility of a scheduled task. For example, a<br>
task to make a dinner reservation may be set up in template 205 to occur at a<br>
particular time. Using information about the restaurant's business hours<br>
obtained in the manner described above, a user can be warned that the<br>
restaurant is not open at that time.<br>
In yet another example, real time information can be used to set up a<br>
conditional task. For example, a task to call an airline reservation center may be<br>
set up in template 205. An ICS initiates the call without human intervention and<br>
monitors the call until an agent or operator at the reservation center is on the<br>
line. At that point, the user can be alerted to participate in the caii.<br>
The above example can be extended to a situation in which an automatic<br>
call distribution (ACD) system is monitored before a call is initiated. By<br>
monitoring the status of the ACD system, information such as the average wait<br>
time for connection to an agent can be obtained and provided to the user.<br>
Based on such information, the user may decide to initiate the call right away or<br>
wait until a later time. In one embodiment, the user can establish in a template a<br>
threshold or condition that, if satisfied, causes the user to be alerted. For<br>
13<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
example, the user can specify an acceptable wait time; if the monitored ACD<br>
system information falls to less than that time, the user can be alerted. Further<br>
information about ACD monitoring is provided by U.S. Patent No. 6,850,615,<br>
assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
In the examples above, an event is described as having a number of tasks<br>
that are coordinated among different users. Embodiments in accordance with<br>
the present invention can also be used to coordinate between events. For<br>
example, a task associated with one event can be coordinated with a task<br>
associated with another event.<br>
Furthermore, tasks or events for an individual user can be coordinated.<br>
For example, a number of people may apply for admission to a college. Each<br>
applicant will typically have to complete a number of tasks as part of the<br>
admission process. According to embodiments of the present invention, each<br>
applicant can be issued a template that lists those tasks and is integrated with an<br>
applicant's PIM, in a manner similar to that described above.<br>
Figure 3 is a flowchart 300 of a method for managing shared tasks<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. Although specific steps<br>
are disclosed in flowchart 300, such steps are exemplary. That is, embodiments<br>

WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
stored in a memory unit of computer system 112 and executed by processor 101<br>
(Figure 1).<br>
In block 302 of Figure 3, with reference also to Figure 2, a first device<br>
(e.g., client device 200) receives a template (e.g., template 205) that includes a<br>
listing of one or more tasks. The tasks are common to a group of individuals.<br>
The listing can include one or more shared tasks. A shared task includes an<br>
action that, when completed by one of the individuals in the group, is completed<br>
for all of the individuals in the group. The listing can also include one or more<br>
tasks that are performed by each of the individuals. The template is distributed<br>
in parallel to a group of devices associated with the individuals in the group.<br>
In block 304 of Figure 3, information that is read from a memory of the<br>
first device is placed into fields of the template.<br>
In block 306, information identifying that the action (e.g., the shared task)<br>
has been performed is received at the first device.<br>
in block 307, in one embodiment, the action is performed using an<br>
automated system.<br>
In block 308, in one embodiment, the action is subject to a condition. In<br>
one such embodiment, the condition is verified as to whether or not it is feasible.<br>
In another embodiment, information that identifies a constraint associated with<br>
the condition is retrieved and added to the template. In another such<br>
embodiment, an alert is provided when a condition applied to an external agent<br>
associated with performing the action is satisfied.<br>
15<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/008613	PCT/US2006/026400<br>
In block 310, the template is updated at the first device and also at the<br>
group of devices to indicate the action has been performed.<br>
In summary, embodiments in accordance with the present invention<br>
provide methods and systems for coordinating a set of related tasks and/or<br>
events using a template that can be understood by and integrated with, for<br>
example, a PIM. In various embodiments, schedules can be arranged according<br>
to external dependencies, fields in the template can be filled in using information-<br>
read from memory, and tasks can be performed by voice-capable systems. As<br>
tasks are completed, templates and PIMs can be automatically updated, so that<br>
completed tasks (in particular, completed shared tasks) are visible to all group<br>
members. Consequently, the amount of duplicated effort is reduced.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are thus described. While the<br>
present invention has been described in particular embodiments, it should be<br>
appreciated that the present invention should not be construed as limited by<br>
such embodiments, but rather construed according to the below claims.<br>
