The present invention provides novel processes for preparation of 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinones, key intermediates for oxazolidinone antibacterials.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
US Pat. No. 5,688,792 (US 5,688,792) disclosed oxazine and thiazine oxazolidinone derivatives. The compounds are antimicrobial agents. Among them linezolid, chemically N-[[(5S)-3-[3-fluorO'4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methy!]acetamide is the most important antibacterial agent. Linezolid is represented by the following structure:<br><br>
Processes for preparation of linezolid were described in US 5,837,870, WO 99/24393, WO 95/07271. J,Med.Chem. 39(3), 673-679, 1996 and Tetrahedron Lett, 40(26), 4855,1999.<br>
According to prior art processes, the 5-hydroxymethyl substituted oxazolidinones are converted to the corresponding 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinones, key intermediates in the production of oxazolidinone antibacterial pharmaceuticals.<br>
The prior art processes for preparing 5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinones are associated with many drawbacks. For instant in the preparation of linezolid, WO 95/07271 uses butyl lithium at very low temperature (-78째C). It is known that the handling of butyl lithium is difficult and the person skilled in the art appreciate a process that produces the product in good yield avoiding the 'difficult to handle' reagents.<br>
We have discovered novel intermediates useful for preparing oxazolidinone antibacterials. The novel intermediates can be prepared in high<br><br>
yields using easy to handle reagents. The novel internnediates can be converted to oxazolidinone antibacterials using common reagents, also in good yields.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION The   present   invention   provides   a   novel   process   to   prepare   5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinones of formula I:<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1, R3, X, R2 and n are as defined in formula I;<br>
(or) (ii) reacting the compound of formula V:<br><br>
and<br>
c)        converting the product of step (b)   to aminomethyl oxazolidinone of<br>
formula I.<br><br>
The compounds of formula IV are novel and provides another aspect of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  provides  a  novel  process  for  preparing   5-aminomethyl substituted oxazolidinones of formula I:<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1, R3, X, R2 and n are as defined in formula 1.<br>
The reaction is carried out by contacting the chlorohydrin compounds with potassium phthalimide in a solvent or mixture of solvents. Selection of solvent is not critical, but preferable solvents are those that dissolve both the chlorohydrin compounds and potassium phthalimide to ensure maximum contact between the reactants resulting in faster reaction. However, the process is also operable with solvents that only partially dissolve the chlorohydrin compounds or potassium phthalimide. The preferable solvent is dimethylformamide or acetonitrile.<br>
The reaction is performed preferably between about 10째C and the boiling temperature of the solvent used, more preferably between 40째C and the boiling temperature of the solvent and most preferably at the boiling temperature of the solvent used.<br>
Time required for completion of the reaction depends on factors such as solvent used and temperature at which the reaction is carried out. For example, if the reaction is carried out by contacting the chlorohydrin compounds with potassium phthalimide in dimethylformamide under reflux conditions, about 2 to 10 hours is required for the reaction completion.<br>
Alternatively the compound of formula IV is prepared by reacting the compound of formula V:<br><br><br><br>
The quantity of phthalimido oxiranyl compound is not critical, but for better yield at least one molar equivalent is required per equivalent of phenyl amine of formula V.<br>
The reaction between the compounds of formula V and formula VI is carried out in a solvent. Any solvent, which is neutral towards the reactants, may be used. Operable solvents include cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran; amides such as N, N-dimethylformamide and N, N-dimethylacetamide; acetonitrile; and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, t-amyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol and Isopropyl alcohol; and a mixture thereof. Preferable solvent is selected from methanol, isopropyl alcohol and N, N-dimethylformamide.<br>
The reaction is performed at or below boiling temperature of the solvent used, more preferably between 10째C and boiling temperature of the solvent used and even more preferably at boiling temperature of the solvent used.<br>
Time required for completion of the reaction depends on factors such as solvent used and temperature at which the reaction is carried.<br>
The product obtained may be used directly in the next step, or it can be<br>
isolated from the reaction mixture and used in the next step.<br>
Step (b)	The phthalimido compound of formula IV produced as above is<br>
subjected to cabonylation to provide phthalimido oxazolidinone compound of formula VII.<br><br><br>
The carbonylation is performed using any carbonylating reagent commonly known for such purpose. Among them carbonyldiimidazole, phosgene, diethyl carbonate, triphosgene, alky! chloroformates such as ethyl chloroformate, aryl chloroformates such as phenyl chloroformate and aralkyi chloroformates such as benzyl chloroformate are preferred; carbonyldiimidazole, diethyl carbonate and triphosgene are being more preferred.<br>
The carbonylation reaction is preferably performed by contacting the phthalimido compound of formula IV with carbonylating agent in the presence of an aprotic solvent or a mixture thereof. More preferably the phthalimido compound of formula IV is reacted with at least one molar equivalent of the carbonylating agent in the presence of an aprotic solvent such as methylene dichloride, ethylenedichloride or chloroform.<br>
The phthalimido compounds of formula VII are known and can be converted to the aminomethyl oxazolidinone compounds by using for example Hydrazine hydrate or aqueous methylamine. These methods are known and are described in US 5,688,792.<br>
The aminomethyl oxazolidinone compounds of formula I are acylated by known methods using acylating agents such as acyl halides or acyl anhydrides to form the corresponding 5-acylaminomethyloxazolidinone compounds of formula VIII;<br><br>
wherein R1, R3, X, R2 and n are as defined in formula I; R represents Ci to C8 straight or branched alkyl groups. The preferred alkyl group is CH3.<br>
The acylation can be carried out by known methods such as those described in US 5.688,792.<br>
One compound of formula VIII can be converted to another compound of formula VIII. Thus for example compounds of formula VIII, wherein X is 8 can be<br><br>
converted to the compounds of formula VIM, wherein X is SO or SO2 by the methods such as those disclosed in US 5,688, 792.<br>
The 5-acyl amino methyl substituted oxazolidinone of formula VIII are known to be antibactehal pharmaceutical agents.<br>
The compounds of formula II and VI have the right configuration to obtain the compounds of formula I and VIII. The configurations of formula II and VI are retained through out the sequence of reactions of the invention. However, it is readily apparent to one skilled in the art that one could easily perform the identical process steps with the opposite enantiomeric form or racemic form to obtain the corresponding stereo isomers.<br>
Therefore, using the chemistry of the claimed process with any of the enantiomeric forms is considered equivalent to the claimed processes.<br>
The compounds of formula II used as starting materials can be obtained by the process described in our co-pending international application No. PCT/IN04/00105. Thus, the compound of formula II is prepared by reacting a compound of formula V:<br><br><br>
a) N-[3-Chloro-2-(R)-hydroxypropyl]-3-fluoro-4-morpholinyl aniline is reacted with potassium phthalimide to provide N-[3-pthalimido-2-(R)-hydroxypropyl]-3-fluoro-4-(morpholinyl)aniline (Formula IV, R1 = R3 is H; X is O; one R2 is H and the other R2 is F; and n is 1).<br>
The reaction is carried out by contacting the N-[3-Chloro-2-(R)-hydroxypropyl]-3-fluoro-4-morpholinylaniline, with potassium phthalimide in a solvent or a mixture of solvents. Selection of solvent is not critical, but preferable solvents are those that dissolve both the chlorohydrin compounds and potassium phthalimide to ensure maximum contact between the reactants resulting in faster reaction. However, the process is also operable with solvents that only partially dissolve the chiorohydrin compounds or potassium phthalimide. The preferable solvent is dimethylformamide or acetonitrile.<br>
The reaction is performed preferably between about 10째C and the boiling temperature of the solvent used, more preferably between 40째C and the boiling temperature of the solvent, and most preferably at the boiling temperature of the solvent used.<br>
Time required for completion of the reaction depends on factors such as solvent used and temperature at which the reaction is carried out. For example, if the reaction is carried out by contacting the chiorohydrin compounds with potassium phthalimide in dimethylformamide under reflux conditions, about 3 to 7 hours is required for the reaction completion.<br>
Alternatively 3-fluoro-4-morpholinyl aniline (formula V, R1 = R3 is H; X is O; one R2 is H and the other R2 is F; and n is 1) is reacted with phthalimide oxiranyl compound of formula VI to provide N-[3-pthalimido-2-(R)-hydroxypropyl]-3-fluoro-4-(morpholinyl)aniline (Formula IV, R1 = R3 is H; X is O; one R2 is H and the other R2 is F; and n is 1).<br>
The quantity of phthalimide oxiranyl compound is not critical, but for better yield at least one molar equivalent is required per equivalent of 3-fluoro-4-morpholinyl aniline.<br>
Any solvent, which is neutral towards the reactants, may be used. Operable solvents include cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran; amides such as N, N-dimethylformamide and N, N-dimethylacetamide; acetonitrile; and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, t-amyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol and Isopropyl alcohol.<br><br>
Preferable solvent is selected from methanol, isopropyl alcohol and N, N-dimethylformamide.<br>
The reaction is performed at or below boiling temperature of the solvent used, more preferably between 10째C and boiling temperature of the solvent used and even more preferably at boiling temperature of the solvent used.<br>
The product obtained can be used directly in the next step, or it can be isolated from the reaction mixture and used in the next step.<br>
b) N-[3-pthalimido-2-(R)-hydroxypropyl]-3-fluoro-4-(morpholinyl)aniline produced as above is subjected to carbonylation to provide (S)-N-[3-[3-Fluoro-4-[4-morpholinyl]phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl] phthalimide (Formula VII, Ri = R3 is H; X is O; one R2 is H and the other R2 is F; and n is 1),<br>
The carbonylation is performed using any carbonylating reagent commonly known for such purpose. Among them carbonyldiimidazole, phosgene, methyl chloroformate, benzyl chloroformate, diethyl carbonate, triphosgene and phenylchloroformate are preferred; carbonyldiimidazole, diethyl carbonate and triphosgene are being more preferred.<br>
The carbonylation reaction is preferably performed by contacting the N-[3-phthalimido-2-(R)-hydroxypropyl]-3-fluoro-4-morpholinylanilinewith carbonylating agent in the presence of an aprotic solvent or a mixture of aprotic solvents. More preferably the N-[3-phthalimido-2-(R)-hydroxypropyl]-3-fluoro-4-morpholinylaniline is reacted with at least one molar equivalent of the carbonylating agent in the presence of an aprotic solvent such as methylene dichloride, ethylenedichloride or chloroform.<br>
c)	(S)-N-[[3-[3-Fluoro-4-[4-morpholinyl]phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl] phthalimide produced as above is reacted with hydrazine hydrate or aqueous methyl amine to produce S-N'[[3-[3-Fluoro-4-[4-morpholinyl]phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]amine (Formula I, R1 = R3 is H; X is O; one R2 is H and the other R2 is F; and n is 1). These methods of deprotection are known and described for example in US 5,688,792.<br>
