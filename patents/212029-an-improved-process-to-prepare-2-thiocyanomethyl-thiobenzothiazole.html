ORIGINAL<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-thiocyahome;thylthid-be:rizothiazole(TCMTB).<br>
More particularly it relates to a process to prepare 2-thiocyahOmethylthiobehzothiazole (TCMTB) by reacting •Chlordbfohlbmethahe with alkali metal salt of thiocyahate of ammonium thoicyanate to forth Chloromethylthiocyanate, which is theh reacted ih-situ with alkali metal salt of 2-rhefcaptdbehzbthiazole; in a suitable sblveht to give TCMTB of rhiriimuni 98% purity.<br>
2- Thibcyanomethylthiobehzothiazble (TCMTB) represented as under vide formula 1 is a useful fungicide, which is used as preservative for tanned leather; It is very useful for pfeveritibh of mould growth oh litmbbf and other suffices. It is also used as fhicfbbibcide ifi pulp and paper industries and water treatment industries.<br><br>
Prior art<br>
111 prior art theife are viarious processes to prepare TCMTB. which are granted patent by the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office and Japanese Patent Office as described belb\v;<br>
US 3.463,785<br>
In fliis process, chlbfbniethyl fhibcyariate was reacted with sbdiuhi 2-ihefc;aL{Jto behzbthiazble to fbffh TCMTB.Prbebss accbrdihg to this patent fequifes vefy Ibng reactibh tirttb ( 15 days) with less yield.<br><br>
US3.520,976<br>
US3,520,976 describes preparation of 2-chloromethylthiobenzothiazole from alkali metal salt of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole and large excess of bromochloromethane (10 mole per mole of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole). 2-chloromethylthiobenzothiazole was then reacted with ammonium thiocyanate to form 81.5% pure TCMTB using acetone as solvent. However, side products were 18-20% by this process. Therefore, the disadvantage was that the yield was not good and adequate.<br>
US Patent No.4J55,609<br>
This patent describes a process in which 2-chloromethylthiobenzothiazole was reacted with alkali metal thiocyanate or ammonium thiocyanate using water as solvent in presence of phase transfer catalyst. Reaction was carried out at a relatively high temperature and for a longer time in order to obtain good yield. Major disadvantage of this process is the decomposition of TCMTB in presence of water at high temperature.<br>
US Patent No.5,073.638<br>
This patent describes the preparation of TCMTB by reacting 2-chloromethylthiobenzothiazole in presence of at least one glycol ether as solvent for reaction with either an alkali metal thiocyanate or ammonivim thiocyanate at temperature in the range of 60-80°C. 90% yield was reported by this process. However, this process has disadvantage of decomposition of TCMTB due to higher temperature and longer reaction time.<br>
Japanese Patent Application No.60-132971<br>
This patent discloses the synthesis of TCMTB by reacting chloromethylthiocyanate with a water soluble salt of mercaptobenzothiazole in presence of water and a phase transfer catalyst.<br><br>
The major disadvantage of this: process is that chloromethyl thiocyanate is a moisture sensitive molecule, which decomposes in water.<br>
It is, therefore, a principal object of the pressent invention to obviate the disadvantages of the prior art processes and provide an improved process for the preparation of TCMTB.<br>
It is another object of the present invehtion to provide an ecpnomical arid clean process for preparation of TCMTB.<br>
Detailed description of the dreferred embodiments<br>
The preserit invention relates to the preparation of TCMTB in high yield and high purity, by reactirtg Chldrobromomethane with alkali metal thidcyanate dr ammonium thiocyanate folldwed by alkali metal salts, more preferably the sodium salt of 2-niiercapto berizdthiazole in Single pot in presence of organic solvents preferably carbon tetra chldride, methylienedichlonde, chloroform, toIuene xylene isopropyl alcohol acetoiie and rnetliandl.<br>
The reactions are carried out at much lower teniperatiire iti the range df 30-50°C than that in US Patent  no. 5073638 to avoid decoimposition df TCMTB due to heating.<br>
Siiide chloromethylthiocyanate is a high lachrymator add fighly toxic at a very low concentrations, the present invention aims at one pot synthesis of TCMTB starting<br>
from bromocholromethane without  isolating chloromethylthiocyanate.<br>
Thus it is also the object of the presenit invention not to islate chloromethlylthiocyanate so that its ill effects can be avdided.<br>
The preserit invention requires at least  1.0-1.2 mole of chlorobromomethane per mole of alkalii matel thoicyanate or ammonium thoicyanate as against 10 riidle reported<br><br>
in earlier patents.   Thus, the quantity of the effluent required is reduced considerably and thereby the entire process to prepare TCMTB is reduced significantly.<br>
Organic solvents preferably carbontetrachloride, methylenedicWoride, chloroform, toluene, xylene, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, methanol is required as solvent in the reaction.<br>
The present invention requires 1.0-1.02 mole of alkali metal salt of mercaptobenzothiazole per mole of alkali metal thiocyanate or ammonium thiocyanate. Chloromethylthiocyanate is not isolated in present invention hence safer and environment friendly process. Yield has also been improved by this process.<br>
Since the present invention does not require water as solvent, purity of TCMTB is significantly improved as against the process mentioned in Japanese patent application no.60-132971 because chloromethylthicyanate and TCMTB are highly reactive towards water.<br>
