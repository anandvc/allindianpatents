				<td>DRAFT DEVICE IN SPINNING MACHINE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a draft device in a spinning machine, and in particular, to a draft device in a spinning machine that supplies a silver to the draft device while regulating the sliver so that it remains flat, in order to stabilize drafting in the draft device.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In conventional spinning machines, a sliver L supplied to a draft device D is fed to back rollers Rb2, Rb3 located at the most upstream position in the draft device D, by a trumpet T in the form of a bundle with a substantially circular cross section, as shown in Figure 1B1. When the sliver is supplied to between the back rollers Rb2, Rb3 in the form of the bundle with the substantially circular cross section, if the silver is twisted or the sliver thickness is uneven, the twist or the uneven thickness is transmitted to the back rollers as it is. This conventionally leads to unstable drafting.<br>
The conventional draft devices in s spinning machine are, for example, disclosed in the Japanese Patent No. 3183607, the Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication (Tokkai-Hei) No. 7-6274, and so on.<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a draft device in a spinning machine which is intended to stabilize a sliver supplied to the draft<br><br>
device, during drafting.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
To accomplish the above object, the present invention specifically provides a draft device in a spinning machine characterized by comprising sliver regulation guide means provided on an upstream side of draft rollers located at the most upstream position in the draft device, the sliver regulation guide means pressing a sliver supplied to the draft device, in a vertical direction to regulate the sliver so that the sliver remains flat.<br>
An invention set forth in Clam 2 is the draft device in the spinning machine set forth in Claim 1, characterized in that the sliver regulation guide means comprises a pair of bar-like guide members arranged parallel to each other with a predetermined spacing (d) between the guide members.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
A draft device in a spinning machine in accordance with the present invention will be described below on the basis of a specific embodiment shown in the drawings. First, a description will be given of the spinning machine to which the present invention is applied. As shown in Figures 5 and 6, this spinning machine is composed of a large number of spinning units U. A sliver L is fed to the draft device D via a cylindrical guide (trumpet) T and then formed into a spun yarn Y by a pneumatic spinning device Sp, and then, the spun yarn Y passes through nip rollers Rn and a slab catcher Z, and is then wound at a winding portion W. Reference numeral P is a piecing device which splices a yarn and which runs in an internally lower part of the spinning device along its longitudinal direction.<br>
With reference to Figures 5 and 6, a description will be given of a process executed until the spun yarn Y into which the sliver L is formed is wound into a package. The spinning device to which the present invention is applied includes the draft device D and the pneumatic spinning device Sp, provided downstream side of a pair of front rollers Rf2, Rf3 in the draft device D.<br>
The draft device D in the spinning machine is composed of plural pairs of<br><br>
draft rollers constituting fiber feeding means. The draft roller drafts the sliver L and is composed of, for example, the front rollers Rf, second rollers Rs having aprons (e), third rollers Rt, and back rollers Rb. Each pair of rollers is composed of a combination of a top roller (Rf2, Rs2, Rt2, Rb2) and a bottom roller (Rf3, Rs3, Rt3, Rb3).<br>
The top roller (Rf2, Rs2, Rt2, Rb2) and the bottom roller (Rf3, Rs3, Rt3, Rb3) are in contact with each other and rotate in the opposite directions. Accordingly, the sliver L can be guided to between the top roller (Rf2, Rs2, Rt2, Rb2) and the bottom roller (Rf3, Rs3, Rt3, Rb3), and drafted by the top roller (Rf2, Rs2, Rt2, Rb2) and the bottom roller (Rf3, Rs3, Rt3, Rb3). The drafted fiber bundle is supplied to the pneumatic spinning device Sp via the pair of front rollers Rf2, Rf3 in the draft device D.<br>
The draft device D drafts the sliver L supplied via the cylindrical guide (trumpet) T, to a predetermined thickness. Drafting is carried out by gradually increasing the rotation speed of each roller pair. The sliver L drafted to the predetermined thickness is supplied to the pneumatic spinning device Sp, described later, and formed into a spun yarn Y by the pneumatic spinning device Sp.<br>
The pneumatic spinning device Sp is located on a downstream side of the draft device D. The pneumatic spinning device Sp has a built-in nozzle that enables a whirling air current to be internally generated when the fiber bundle fed by the draft device D passes through the pneumatic spinning device Sp.<br>
According to the present invention, the draft device D configured as<br><br>
described above has sliver regulation guide means 1 provided on an upstream side of the draft rollers Rb, located at the most upstream position in the draft device D; the sliver regulation guide means 1 presses the sliver L supplied by the draft device D, in a vertical direction to regulate the sliver L so that it remains flat.<br>
The sliver regulation guide means 1 is composed of a pair of bar-like guide members 2a, 2b or pi ate-like guide members 3a, 3b arranged parallel to each other with a desired spacing (d) between the guide members 2a, 2b, or between the guide members 3a, 3b.<br>
As shown in Figure 1A or Figure 1C1, the pair of bar-like guide members 2a, 2b is composed of shafts each with a circular cross section of a desired diameter and is not rotatable. The paired bar-like guide members 2a, 2b are arranged parallel to each other with the passage spacing (d) between them. The passage spacing (d) is about 1.5 mm and is varied depending on the type of the sliver L<br>
As shown in Figure 1C2, the pair of plate-like guide members 3a, 3b is composed of plates comprising sliver receiving portions 4a, 4b that are bent outward toward the upstream side of the sliver L, and a pair of plate-like guide members 3a, 3b are arranged parallel to each other with the passage spacing (d) between them. The passage spacing (d) is about 1.5 mm and is varied depending on the type of the sliver L.<br>
The sliver regulation guide means 1 may be configured not only as described above but also as shown in Figure 4. The sliver regulation guide means 1 shown in Figure 4 has two guide members one 5a of which comprises a convex portion 6a<br><br>
in an area through which the silver L passes. The convex portion 6a has a diameter which gradually increases toward its axial center and which is largest in the axial center. The other guide member 5b also comprises a concave portion 6b in the area through which the sliver L passes. The concave portion 6b has a diameter which gradually decreases toward its axial center and which is smallest in the axial center. The guide members 5a, 5b are not rotatable.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, the sliver regulation guide means 1 is composed of a first guide member 11 and a second guide member 12. The first guide member 11 is movable parallel to the second guide member 12 between a first position PI and a second position P2. At the first position PI, the first guide member 11 can be positioned parallel to the second guide member 12 with the spacing (d) between them.<br>
With reference to Figure 2 and Figure 3, a description will be given of the configuration and operation of the sliver regulation guide means 1 with a pressure bar based on a toggle type link mechanism that embodies the above arrangements. In this embodiment, of the draft rollers, the bottom rollers Rt3, Rb3 are supported on a machine body 10, and the top rollers Rt2, Rb2, paired with the bottom rollers Rt3, Rb3, respectively, are installed on a cradle arm 30 so as to be movable along an arrow Ya.<br>
The second guide member 12 is supported on the machine body 10 via a bracket 13. On the other hand, the first guide member 11 is supported by a lateral pair<br><br>
of arms 14, 14 in a toggle type link mechanism TR. The arms 14, 14 are pivotally connected to the bracket 13.<br>
The toggle type link mechanism TR is composed of an operation lever 17 comprising an operation portion 16 at one end of the operation lever 17 with respect to a pivotal point 15, a connection link 19 pivotally connected to the other end of the operation lever 17 via a connection portion 18, and the arm 14 pivotally connected to the other end of the connection link 19 at an intermediate connection portion 20 of the arm 14 and having a pivotal point 21 at one end of the arm 14. The first guide member 11 is provided at an intermediate portion of the arm 14, and a pressure bar 22 is provided at the other end of the arm 14.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, with the toggle-type link mechanism TR, operating and setting the operation lever 17 in the position shown in Figure 3A enables the first guide member 11 to be located at the position PI via the connection link 19 and arm 14. As shown in Figure 3B, moving the operation lever 17 in the direction of an arrow Yb enables the first guide member 11 to move away to the second position P2.<br>
In the second embodiment, the pressure bar 22 is means for increasing the resistance between the fibers in the sliver L in the draft device D. The pressure bar 22 is placed between the back roller pair Rb2, Rb3 and the third roller pair Rt2, Rt3. As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, the pressure bar 22 is a bar-like member with a circular cross section and has an axial length designed to be larger than the maximum width of the sliver L<br><br>
The pressure bar 22 comes into contact with the sliver L from above (or below) a conveying path along which the sliver L runs between the back roller pair Rb2, Rb3 and the third roller pair Rt2, Rt3. The pressure bar 22 thus presses the sliver L. Thus, the sliver L pressed by the pressure bar 22 from above the conveying path runs along a curved path formed by distortion caused by the pressure of the pressure bar 22 instead of a straight path corresponding to the shortest distance between the back roller pair Rb2, Rb3 and the third roller pair Rt2, Rt3.<br>
Thus, the conveying path for the sliver L between the drat roller pairs is thus curved to increase the resistance between the fibers in the sliver L pulled between the draft roller pairs. This increases a draft force (force pulling the group of fibers) and thus the rate of drafting (draw ratio) between the adjacent draft roller pairs. This in turn avoids a decrease in draft force even with an increase in the difference in peripheral speed between the adjacent draft rollers.<br>
To increase the draft force, gauge adjustment can be carried out so as to reduce the pitch between the adjacent draft roller pairs (for example, the axial distance between the back roller pair Rb2, Rb3 and the third roller pair Rt2, Rt3). However, if the draw ratio cannot be dealt with only by the gauge adjustment, the pressure bar 22 can be used to increase the resistance between the fibers in the sliver L<br>
The present invention combines the pressure bar 22 with the toggle type link mechanism TR, which moves the first guide member 11 of the slide regulation guide member 1 parallel to the first position P1 and the second position P2. This<br><br>
improves operability when the supply of a sliver L is started.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
