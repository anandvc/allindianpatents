				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This  invention  relates to an apparatus  for  the treatment  of waste petroleum oil   for  obtaining ef ined petroleum oil theref rom.<br>
aste petroleum oil, such as, waste lubricating til and other contaminated or degraded petroleum til waste is classified as hazardous waste all iver  the world and has the potential  to  pollute<br>
ater  supply  and  soil,  causing  pollution   to<br>
rinking  water as well as threat to  marine  life<br>
nd land vegetation*<br>
aste oil comprises hydrocarbons having a ommercial use if it can be treated to restore its ommercial qualities.<br>
resent 1y, in Indiav waste oil treatment is done y  a process called acid clay treatment.<br>
his process involves the dehydration of the waste il by distilling the water therefrom in a ehydrator; the dehydrated oil is heated and hen cooled to ambient temperature (this step is ailed thermal cracking); the waste oil from the hermal cracker is then mixed with  sulphuric acid<br><br>
and left for settling. The acid sludge is decanted and disposed of. The clear oil is transferred to the clay treatment section.<br>
In the clay treatment section, the oil is mixed with activated alumina clay and the mixture is heated and subjected to distillation under vacuum. The oil clay mixture is filtered in a press and the clear oil is now sent for commercial use.<br>
The  effluent  in the above known  process*  apart<br>
from  water,  are the acid sludge (around  20%  to<br>
50 %   of  the waste oils processed) and  spent  clay,<br>
the  quantity of which is also  substantial.   The<br>
life of the pi ant used in this process is 1ow  due<br>
to   heavy   corrosion  by  the   use   of   acid.<br>
Additionally,  the plant emi ts flue gas and  other<br>
gases including SO<br>
2<br>
Another known process does not use sulphuric acid.<br>
The  waste  oil  is  treated  with  chemicals   to<br>
coagulate  the degraded additives: carbon,  sludge<br>
and other impurities. These are filtered out   and<br>
the  remaining oil is then subjected to  activated<br>
alumina  clay treatment, and  vacuum  disti1 lation.<br><br>
In this process, the use of chemicals will essentially generate solid waste which will be difficult to dispose of. The actual separation of undes irable, degraded or other foreign matters is done by the use of chemicals, absorbent or adsorbent. The eff1uent from the process are water, coagulant along with carbon, spent additives, sludge and other impurities, and spent clay in addition to emissions of flue and process gases. A major drawback w i th this process is the high cost of operation of the plant.<br>
The equipment used in the above two processes are distillation columns with standard types of trays such as bubbl©-cap trays, sieve trays, valve trays etc. or packed column. The use of these types of trays is possible because the oil has been freed from degraded additives, carbon and many other impuri ties which might otherwise clog the trays. In other words, the waste oil has to be subjected to chemical processes and phys ical separation before fractionation. As already stated, these types of processes will generate effluents that are d ifficult to dispose of in an  environmentally<br><br>
safe manner.<br>
This invention therefore proposes an apparatus for the treatment of waste petroleum oil for obtaining refined petroleum oil therefrom eliminating or, at 1 east, greatly minimising the abovementioned drawbacks associated with the known processes of treating waste petroleum oil.<br>
The apparatus, according to this invention, for the treatment of waste petroleum oil for obtaining refined petroleum oil therefrom, comprises a distil lati on column having^ '^yln 1 et near its base for the entry of dehydrated waste petroleum oil into the upper portion of the bottom section of the co1umn; an opening at the bottom of the column for allowing the recirculation of the said oil in the lower portion of the bottom section of the coIumn, through the/inlet, to the said upper portion; means for separati ng and remov ing, as vapour, the var ious f Tactions from the reci rculating oil; means for maintain ing the interior of the column under 700 mm Hg. to 760 mm.Hg. vacuum; a heater provided for the column for  heating  the  recirculating  oil  so  as   to<br><br>
maintain the temperature thereof within the bottom section of the column between 300 deg. C 360 deg, C; a plurality of chambers, disposed over the bottom section of the column, one above the other, for receiving the vapours of the hot oi1 from the said upper portion, such chambers being separated from each other by trays, each tray having a free passage surmounted by a hood, the passages in the said trays, allowing vapours, rising f rom the hot oil in the said upper portion, to pass therethrough, and the hoods constraining such vapours to condense around the trays in the respective chambers; outlets provided for such chambers for tappi ng and removing the condensed oil of various grades therefrom? and means provided for at least one chamber, for spraying cold oil therein; and an opening at the top of the topmost chamber for the exit, and collection, of the remnant vapours therefrom*<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example one of the possible embod iments of this invention', wherein<br><br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the distillation column of  the<br>
said embodiment<br>
and<br>
Fig.2 illustrates a separate view of the tray used<br>
there!n.<br>
The distil lation column D has an inletll	near  i ts<br>
base  for the entry of dehydrated waste	petroleum<br>
oil into the upper portion of the bottom	sect ion R<br>
of the column D.<br>
The dehydrated oil is obtained f rorn a dehydrator after removal of final traces of water and any 1ighter fractions of hydrocarbons present in the waste oil.<br>
The column D has an opening A at its bottom for allowing the recirculation of the oil in the 1ower portion of the bottom section R of the column D, through the inlet Jl, to the said upper portion.<br>
Mean5,      such as, a pump and heater,  are	provided<br>
for  recirculating  and heating the  oil	and  for<br>
separating and vapour ising the various	f racti ons<br>
of oil in the recirculating oil.<br><br>
Means, such as» a vacuum pump, steam ejectors	and<br>
the  like   are  provided for  the  column  D	for<br>
maintaining  the interior of the column under	700<br>
mm Hg to 760 mm Hg vacuum pressure.<br>
Means   are   also  provided,  for   the   column, for maintaining the temperature of the oil in  the bottom section R of the column D  between 300 deg. C -  360 deg. C.<br>
The column houses a plurality of chambers (in the embod iment illustrated, five chambers) CI to C5, d isposed one above the other, over the bottom section R of the column D, for receiving the vapours of the hot oi1 from within the bottom section R of the column D, such chambers being separated from each other by trays T. The chambers may be structured as one unit (as illustrated) or as separate modules intercommunicating wi th each other, as convenience may d ictate.<br>
Each  tray  has a free passage P surmounted  by  a<br><br>
hood H. The passages P in the trays T allow vapours (see arrows B), rising from the hot oil in the bottom section R of the column D to pass freely therethrough, wi thout clogging, while the hoods H constrain portions of such vapours (see arrows E) to condense around the trays in the respecti ve chambers. The condensate is ind icated by Fl to F5. Each condensate is a grade of hydrocarbon oil, the higher the chamber, the 1ighter the fraction.<br>
The chambers have outlets Gl to G5 for tapping and remov ing  the condensed oil of  various  grades theref rom-<br>
To assist or control the condensation of the oil in the chambers means are provided in at least one of the chambers for spraying cold oil e.g. through a pip© line J provided with perforations or nozzles. This oil is tapped from the condensate in any one of the chambers CI to C5.<br>
The  column D  has an  opening K at the top  of  the topmost  chamber C5 for the exit, and  collect i on, of  the remnant vapours theref ram.  These  vapours<br><br>
are taken to a separate chamber for condensation and collection. This will correspond to the lightest grade of oil. The non-condensible vapour and gas are sucked out by steam ejectors/vacuum pumps and sent for incineration. The column vacuum is maintained by this system.<br>
The terms and expressions in this spec ification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated ' and described, but i t is understood that various other embodiments of the apparatus proposed herein are possible without departi ng from the scope and ambi t of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
