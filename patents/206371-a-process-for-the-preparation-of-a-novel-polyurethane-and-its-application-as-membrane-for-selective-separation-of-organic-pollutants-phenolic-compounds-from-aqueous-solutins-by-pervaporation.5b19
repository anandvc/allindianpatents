				<td>Field of the Invention	<br>
The present invention relates to a novel and its process of manufacture. In particular, the invention reiates to a novel polyurethaneurea, which is a hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) based polyurethaneurea and to a pervaporation membrane obtained of said HTPB based polyurethaneurea for efficient removal of organic pollutants by membrane pervaporation. The invention also relates to a method of selective separation of organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds from aqueous solution by pervaporation with high efficiency using the said HTPB polyurethaneurea based membrane.<br>
Background Art<br>
The problem of environmental pollution arising out of industrial effluents is a global concern. Most industrial effluents contain a range of toxic organic compounds and elements, which pose a great threat to the living system in the environment.<br>
The process of selective removal of organic pollutants by membrane pervaporation is a known technique. Polymeric membranes have been tested for separation of pollutants or organic compounds from aqueous solutions of low concentration by this technique.<br>
Membranes used so far for aqueous/organic separations by pervaporation include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polystyrene (PS), polysulfone (PSF), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), cellulose acetate (CA), polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), polyurethane (PU), polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS).<br>
In particular, membranes used so far for phenol separation are Crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/ Polyacrylic acid (PAA) which is used for selective removal of water from aqueous phenol solution (Rhim et al. Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 52 (1994), 1217-1222.<br>
Also possible use of organofunctionalised PDMS membrane for the pervaporation recovery of phenolic compounds from aqueous streams is published (Wu et al, Journal of Membrane Science 190 (2001) 147-357).<br><br>
2<br>
Moreover, it is also known to use polyurethane membranes for selective removal of phenol from aqueous phase. Maximum 65% phenol concentration in the permeate is also reported where PU membrane is of different chemical composition viz. polytetramethylene glycol + H12PI (Hosbi et al., J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 65 (1997), 469-479)<br>
While several polymeric membrane are thus presently available for use in pervaporation it is found that such presently available membranes suffer from certain limitations in their efficiency in terms of total flux and separation factor. There is thus need to improve upon the membrane quality and characteristics to favour achieving higher efficiency in terms of flux and separation by pervaporation technique.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to develop novel polyurethaneurea, which could provide for preparation of pervaporation membranes of higher efficiency in terms of desired total flux and separation factor.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to the development of polyurethaneurea based pervaporation membrane which would have excellent pervaporation performance in terms of separation factor or selectively for separation of organic pollutants by membrane pervaporation.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to development of polyurethaneurea membrane with excellent pervaporation performance in terms of separation factor or selectively of phenol from phenol-water mixture.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to the development of HTPB based polyurethaneurea membrane for selective separation of organic pollutants especially phenolic compounds from aqueous solutions by pervaporation with high efficiency.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention basically deals with the development of a polyurethaneurea of formula (!) followed by casting of membrane from this polymer in solution in a solvent having a critical concentration, The membrane thus developed is found to have excellent pervaporation performance in terms of separation factor or selectivity for separation of phenol from phenol-water mixture. The polymer membrane used in the process is based on a selective composition and process of preparation. It is basically hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) based polyurethaneurea made from various diisocyanates under the influence of various catalysts and specific conditions by solution polymerization technique as shown in the reaction scheme below.<br><br>
7<br><br>
The polyurethaneurea based membrane of the invention has been found to be highly effective in selective isolation of organic pollutants such as phenols from aqueous streams. For the purpose, such membrane can be used in a system for carrying out such separation as illustrated in accompanying Figure 1. As shown in said figure 1 the system ' basically comprise of feed inlet (1), stirrer (2), thermometer pocket (3), feed chamber (4), permeate chamber (5), sintered SS disk (6), condenser-cum-coollector(7), cryostat (8), manometer (9) and a vacuum pump (10)<br>
As discussed above, the invention deals with Polybutadiene based Polyurethaneurea developed from the following materials:<br>
Diols selected from Hydroxyterrninated Polybutadiene Neopentyl glycol Ethylene glycol<br>
Diisocyanates selected from 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI) 4;4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) Hexamethylene diisocyanate (H12DI)l isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane(IPDI)<br>
Diamines selected from 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DADPS) 4,4,-diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA) 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl disulfide (DADS)<br><br>

Catalysts selected from Triethylamine (TEA) and Dibutyltindilaurate (DBTDL)<br>
Solvents selected from N,N-dimethyl fomamide (DMF), 1,4-dioxane; Tetrahydrofuran (THF); Benzene, Toluene, Phenol.<br>
The polymer membrane was made from its solution by casting technique on a smooth substrate surface followed by curing at elevated temperature. For obtaining efficient pervaporation characteristics, the membrane was properly conditioned through solvent and heat treatment. The pervaporation characteristics of the said membrane have been found to depend on its chemical nature, composition and morphology.<br>
Waste streams from several industries like chemical, petrochemical, polymer, etc. contain phenolic compounds as toxic components. Using the selective polyurethane-urea based membranes of the invention, it is now possible to achieve selective removal of such compounds from the waste streams.<br>
In particular, the aforesaid membrane of the invention can be used for the separation of phenol from phenol-water mixture by pervaporation technique.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention is explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to the non-limiting exemplary illustrations.<br>
Example 1<br>
Membrane Preparation<br>
Polyurethane-urea membranes were prepared by reacting HTPB with diisocyanates at various mole ratios to prepolyurethane at -10 °C to 60 °C followed by chain extension with diamines [0 (PPUD) to 100 (PUUSD100) mole %] at the same temperature for one hour. The viscous polymer solution was cast on a smooth substrate ( Teflon) surface with the help of an applicator at room temperature and relative humidity of 60 to 90%. The cast polyurethane was allowed for 15 to 72 hours moisture curing. The membrane thus obtained was having a thickness of 0.1 to 0.15 cm and was exposed to 60 to 100 0C for 3 to 5 hours for residual curing. Membranes were conditioned with some solvent and heat treatment for getting suitable membrane technology for optimum permeation during pervaporation.<br><br>

chamber was kept at atmospheric pressure while a pressure of 5 mm Hg was maintained on the permeate side for all experiments. The feed temperature was varied in the range of 30- 75 °C. Permeate containing more than 70 wt % of phenol was obtained from a feed containing only 1 wt % phenol at a temperature of 75 °C. The phenol concentration in permeate was found to increase with increased feed phenol concentration in the range studied and the maximum of S3 wt % phenol was obtained with feed containing 7 wt % phenol at a temperature of 75 °C. A maximum total flux of 41 g m-2h-1 was obtained at 75 °C with feed containing 7 wt % phenol.<br>

Figure 7 to 11 describe the results of pervaporation study for separation of phenol from aqueous solution using 3% phenol as feed with membranes prepared by different diamine concentrations. The invention thus provides a novel HTPB based polyurethane-urea suitable for preparation of membrane for efficient pervaporation separation of organic pollutants. By use of the membrane it is now possible to selectively separate organic pollutants (phenolic compounds) from aqueous solutions by pervaporation with high efficiency. The invention thus provides for highly selective removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous solutions.<br><br>
