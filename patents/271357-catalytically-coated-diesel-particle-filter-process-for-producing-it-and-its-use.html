				<td>Catalytically coated diesel particle filter, process for producing it and its use<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a catalytically coated diesel particulate filter for cleaning the<br>
exhaust gases of diesel engines, to a process for coating the filter and to the use thereof.<br>
Particulate filters are capable of filtering particulate exhaust gas constituents,<br>
particularly soot particles, out of the exhaust gas of internal combustion engines, thus<br>
preventing their emission into the atmosphere. In principle, it is possible for this<br>
purpose to use either surface filters or depth filters. Surface filters consist typically of<br>
ceramic materials, for example silicon carbide, cordierite, aluminum titanate or mullite.<br>
These filters achieve filtration levels of more than 95%. Alternatively to the surface<br>
filters, it is also possible to use open structures for deposition of soot particles. These<br>
open structures are primarily ceramic foams or filters composed of metallic wire braids.<br>
The filtration efficiency of these open filter systems is much lower than that of typical<br>
surface filters (
The actual challenge in the operation of a particulate filter in the exhaust gas of an<br>
internal combustion engine is, however, not the filtration of the soot particles but the<br>
periodic regeneration of the filters used. Since the temperatures of more than 550°C<br>
required to ignite and combust the soot with oxygen in modern passenger vehicle diesel<br>
engines can typically only be achieved in full-load operation, additional measures are<br>
absolutely necessary for oxidation of the filtered soot particles, in order to prevent<br>
blockage of the filter. In general, a distinction is drawn here between passive and active<br>
heating measures. In the case of active measures, the temperature of the particulate filter<br>
is raised, for example, by using an electrical heater (for example glow plugs or else<br>
microwave heaters) or a burner operated with fuel. Such active measures are always<br>
associated with an increased fuel demand. For this reason, in many systems available on<br>
the market, the use of passive measures is preferred. In the case of passive systems, the<br>
use of catalysts lowers the ignition temperature required to combust the soot particles.<br>
Th is can be achieved through two different concepts. One concept is the use of<br>
organometallic fuel additives, for example cerium compounds and iron compounds,<br><br>
which are combusted with the fuel and become intercalated in the soot layer, finely<br>
distributed in the form of metal clusters, as a homogeneous catalyst. One alternative to<br>
the additive-based systems is the coating of the particulate filters with a catalytically<br>
active material.<br>
Since the lowering of the soot ignition temperature by catalytic measures is generally<br>
insufficient to ensure full regeneration of the filter in all states of operation of the<br>
engine, the current practice is typically to employ a combination of passive and active<br>
measures. The combination of the particulate filter with an oxidation catalyst arranged<br>
upstream has been found to be particularly useful. As a result of injection of additional<br>
fuel in combination with other engine-related measures (for example partial throttling),<br>
unburnt fuel and carbon monoxide reach the diesel oxidation catalyst and are converted<br>
there catalytically to carbon dioxide and water. The heat of reaction released heats up<br>
the exhaust gas and hence also the downstream particulate filter. In combination with a<br>
lowering of the soot ignition temperature by means of a catalytic coating of the filter or<br>
else through the use of fuel additives, the injection required can be reduced and the filter<br>
can be regenerated virtually at any operating point within the characteristic map of the<br>
engine.<br>
In the first generation of exhaust gas aftertreatment systems comprising catalytically<br>
coated particulate filters, the filters were usually arranged after one or two upstream<br>
oxidation catalysts in the underbody of the motor vehicle. In new exhaust gas<br>
aftertreatment systems, the filters, in contrast, are installed as close as possible<br>
downstream of the engine. Owing to the restricted construction space and to reduce<br>
costs, the oxidation catalyst in these cases is applied partially or completely to the filter.<br>
Such a filter arranged close to the engine must, to comply with the legal limits for<br>
carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) over the required distance traveled,<br>
possess a correspondingly high oxidation potential. In addition, it must also be capable<br>
over the entire run time of converting the hydrocarbons injected during an active filter<br>
regeneration, in order thus to generate the exothermicity required to achieve the soot<br>
ignition temperature. Furthermore, the catalytically active coating for use of such a filter<br>
close to the engine must have a high thermal stability.<br><br>
To date, virtually exclusively filter coatings comprising platinum have been used for<br>
diesel passenger vehicles. Coatings comprising platinum and palladium have likewise<br>
become known (DE 102004040549 Al). Coatings comprising platinum and palladium<br>
are notable for a very good thermal stability, but possess a lower fresh activity than<br>
catalytic coatings comprising platinum alone. The principle of platinum- and palladium-<br>
containing coatings was first described some time ago. Owing to the significantly lower<br>
tolerance of Pt/Pd coatings toward poisoning by sulfur and the associated decrease in<br>
the catalytic activity, the use of palladium in exhaust gas catalytic converters for diesel<br>
passenger vehicles was prevented for a long time. Since, however, sulfurization is a<br>
poisoning which is reversible at high temperatures, the noble metal sites of the catalytic<br>
coating are simultaneously desulfated during the regenerations in the case of<br>
periodically actively regenerating systems, for example in the case of diesel particulate<br>
filters. This re-establishes the original oxidation activity.<br>
WO 02/26379 Al describes, among other things, a soot filter which comprises two<br>
catalyst layers one on top of another. The first layer is present on the inlet channels of<br>
the filter and comprises components for oxidizing carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.<br>
These components consist of support materials with platinum group metals deposited<br>
thereon, the support materials being selected from the group consisting of aluminum<br>
oxide, silicon oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide and zeolite, and the platinum<br>
group metals being selected from platinum, palladium and rhodium. The second layer is<br>
applied to the first layer and comprises components for lowering the ignition<br>
temperature of soot, more particularly at least one oxygen-storing compound and at<br>
least one platinum group metal.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a catalytically coated diesel particulate filter<br>
with an improved conversion for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, which<br>
additionally has a high aging stability even in the case of frequently repeated<br>
regenerations of the filter.<br>
This object is achieved by a catalytically coated particulate filter according to the main<br>
claim. Preferred embodiments of the filter and a process for coating the filter and the<br>
use thereof are specified in the subclaims.<br><br>
The particulate filter has an entry side and an exit side for the exhaust gases and an axial<br>
length. The filter is coated over its entire length with a first catalyst which comprises<br>
platinum group metals as catalytically active components on support materials. The<br>
filter is characterized in that the support materials for the platinum group metals are<br>
selected from the group consisting of aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide,<br>
zirconium oxide, cerium oxide and mixtures or mixed oxides thereof, and in that the<br>
first catalyst additionally comprises at least one zeolite for storage of hydrocarbons. In<br>
addition, the particulate filter is coated with a second catalyst which does not comprise a<br>
zeolite over a fraction of the length proceeding from the entry side.<br>
The zeolites used for the first catalyst preferably have a modulus (molar SiO2 to Al2O3<br>
ratio) of more than 10 in order to be sufficiently stable toward the acidic components of<br>
the exhaust gas and the maximum exhaust gas temperatures. Suitable zeolites are, for<br>
example, mordenite, silicalite, Y zeolite, ZSM-5 zeolite and beta zeolite or mixtures<br>
thereof, said zeolites having a molar ratio of silicon dioxide to aluminum oxide between<br>
10 and 400. In addition to the zeolites, it is also possible to use other materials, for<br>
example activated carbon.<br>
During operating phases of the engine with low exhaust gas temperature below approx.<br>
200°C, the zeolites store the hydrocarbons present in the exhaust gas. This is important<br>
since oxidation of the hydrocarbons at the active noble metal sites of the catalyst is<br>
impossible at these low exhaust gas temperatures. In modern passenger vehicle diesel<br>
engines, such operating phases occur both during a cold start and during idling phases,<br>
and also in urban traffic. At temperatures above about 200°C, in contrast, the desorption<br>
of the hydrocarbons predominates. At these higher catalyst temperatures, however, the<br>
hydrocarbons released from the storage components can be converted over the active<br>
sites of the catalyst to carbon dioxide and water.<br>
To increase the catalytic activity, the zeolites may additionally be catalytically activated<br>
with platinum group metals (platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium) or with transition<br>
metals (for example, iron, copper, cerium). For activation with platinum group metals,<br>
the zeolites can be impregnated, for example, with aqueous solutions of soluble<br>
precursor compounds. After the impregnation, the zeolites are dried, calcined and<br><br>
optionally reduced. The noble metal loading on the zeolite is preferably between 0.1 and<br>
10% by weight, based on the total weight of zeolites and platinum group metals.<br>
In the case of use of zeolites exchanged with transition metals (iron, copper and<br>
cerium), the zeolites in the ammonium or sodium form are doped by ion exchange with<br>
the transition metals. The ion exchange can be carried out either in solution or as a so-<br>
called solid state ion exchange. The loading with transition metals is preferably approx.<br>
1 to 15% by weight based on the total weight.<br>
The first catalyst comprises at least one platinum group metal or a plurality thereof,<br>
preferably a combination of platinum and palladium with a weight ratio of platinum to<br>
palladium of 1:10 to 20:1, preferably of 1:1 to 10:1, especially 2:1. Suitable support<br>
materials for the platinum group metals are aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, titanium<br>
dioxide, zirconium dioxide, cerium oxide and mixtures or mixed oxides thereof. The<br>
support materials can be thermally stabilized by doping with rare earth oxides, alkaline<br>
earth metal oxides or silicon dioxide. For example, in the case of aluminum oxide,<br>
doping with barium oxide, lanthanum oxide or silicon dioxide can increase the<br>
conversion temperature of γ- to α-aluminum oxide from approx. 950 up to 1100°C. The<br>
concentration of the doping elements, calculated as the oxide and based on the total<br>
weight of the stabilized aluminum oxide, is typically 1 to 40% by weight. In the case of<br>
use of cerium oxide as the support material, it is advantageous to use cerium/zirconium<br>
mixed oxides, since these generally possess a higher thermal stability than the pure<br>
cerium oxide. The stability of the cerium/zirconium mixed oxides can be improved<br>
further by doping with praseodymium oxide or neodymium oxide. In addition,<br>
cerium/zirconium mixed oxides also possess advantageous oxygen storage properties,<br>
with regard both to the maximum oxygen storage capacity and to the kinetics of oxygen<br>
storage and release.<br>
The particulate filter is coated with the second catalyst over a fraction of its length<br>
proceeding from the entry side. This second catalyst may be identical to or else different<br>
from the first catalyst, both with regard to the catalytically active noble metals and with<br>
regard to the support materials used. Preference is given to using, for the additional<br>
coating, a catalyst with the same composition as the first catalyst. However, the second<br><br>
catalyst does not comprise any zeolites. The length of the second catalyst may be 5 to<br>
80% of the total length of the filter substrate, preferably 10 to 50%.<br>
The application of the second catalyst from the entry side of the filter leads to a<br>
graduated concentration of the catalytically active components. More catalytically<br>
active components are present in the front part of the filter. This is particularly<br>
advantageous in the case of diesel particulate filters with integrated oxidation catalyst<br>
arranged close to the engine. This is because the frequently used silicon carbide filter<br>
substrates possess a large thermal mass and have a strong axial temperature gradient in<br>
the test cycles prescribed for certification, for example the NEDC (= New European<br>
Driving Cycle). For instance, especially in the case of use of relatively long diesel<br>
particulate filters (&gt; 150 mm), the temperatures required for the conversion of carbon<br>
monoxide and hydrocarbons are generally not attained over the entire tesl cycle in the<br>
back part of the filter arranged downstream. Accordingly, in the case of a<br>
homogeneously coated filter, a portion of the noble metal would contribute only to a<br>
small degree or even not at all to the conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.<br>
For this reason, it is advantageous, particularly in the case of filters arranged close to the<br>
engine, to distribute the noble metals graduated over the length of the particulate filter,<br>
such that a zone with relatively high noble metal loading is present on the inflow side<br>
and a region with relatively low noble metal loading on the outflow side. However, the<br>
noble metal concentration should not be below a minimum of approx. 0.1 g/l on the<br>
filter outlet side, since there is otherwise the risk of so-called secondary emissions, i.e.<br>
breakthroughs of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, in the case of active filter<br>
regenerations.<br>
In the coating of diesel particulate filters, particular attention has to be paid to a<br>
minimum increase in the backpressure through the coating. It has been found that the<br>
increase in the backpressure through the coating can be kept low when the catalyst<br>
materials are essentially deposited within the porous walls of the filter substrate. For<br>
this purpose, various methods can be utilized:<br>
■ introduction in the form of solid powder materials suspended in aqueous solution, in<br>
which case the mean particle diameter of the powder materials must be significantly<br>
smaller than the mean pore diameter of the filter substrates;<br><br>
■	introduction in the form of sols;<br>
■	introduction in the form of solutions of precursors of the later support materials,<br>
which are only converted to their final form by a final calcination.<br>
The introduction of the catalyst materials in the form of solid powder materials leads to<br>
catalytic activities and thermal stabilities which are distinctly superior to the other two<br>
coating processes. Introduction in the form of solutions of precursors of the later<br>
support materials, in contrast, possesses distinct advantages with regard to the<br>
backpressure behavior of coated particulate filters, and is therefore a suitable coating<br>
process especially in the case of use of critical substrates (low porosity, low mean pore<br>
diameter).<br>
In the case of use of solid powder materials, these are suspended, for example, in water<br>
and ground for the purpose of homogenization and establishment of a defined particle<br>
size distribution. The grinding is performed such that the maximum particle size in the<br>
suspension is less than 10 µm. This is generally the case when the d50 diameter is less<br>
than 2 µm. Only this small particle size allows the catalyst to be deposited virtually<br>
exclusively in the pores of the substrate. The support materials used in the suspension<br>
are typically already activated with platinum group elements before they are introduced<br>
into the suspension. However, it is also possible only to add dissolved precursor<br>
compounds of the catalytically active platinum group metals to the suspension of the<br>
support materials. In addition, it is also possible, after application of the support<br>
materials to the filter substrate, to subsequently impregnate the filter with soluble<br>
precursors of the platinum group metals.<br>
It has been found that the particle diameters should preferably be established separately<br>
by grinding for catalyst materials and zeolites. Catalyst materials and zeolites have<br>
different hardnesses. Only by separate grinding for both materials can a comparable<br>
particle size distribution be guaranteed. Therefore, for the coating of the filter, two<br>
separate suspensions are first made up. The first suspension comprises the support<br>
materials which are activated with noble metals (for example platinum, palladium). The<br>
second suspension comprises the zeolites. The zeolites are preferably doped in a<br>
preceding process step by impregnation or ion exchange with noble metal. However, it<br><br>
is also possible to add noble metal to the zeolite suspension with the aid of suitable<br>
precursor compounds. In the case of both suspensions, a mean particle diameter d50 less<br>
than 2 urn is then established separately by grinding; the d90 value should be not more<br>
than 5-6 µm. Directly before the actual coating process, the two suspensions are mixed<br>
and homogenized.<br>
Both the first and the second catalyst may comprise zeolites. However, it has been<br>
found to be advantageous for diesel particulate filters arranged close to the engine when<br>
the zeolites are distributed homogeneously over the entire length of the filter. In this<br>
case, only the first catalyst comprises zeolites. The second catalyst then serves only to<br>
increase the concentration of the catalytically active noble metals in the front part of the<br>
particulate filter. In the case of such an arrangement, especially under transient<br>
conditions, as, for example, in the NEDC, the axial temperature profile in the filter,<br>
which is highly pronounced in the case of filter substrates composed of silicon carbide,<br>
can be exploited optimally.<br>
The distribution of the zeolites between the first and second catalysts influences the<br>
development of the exhaust gas backpressure of the coated filters. When the zeolites are<br>
introduced only into the second catalyst, the backpressure is significantly higher than<br>
when the zeolites are coated homogeneously with the first catalyst over the entire length<br>
of the filter. The use of zeolites in the first and second catalysts, in contrast, showed no<br>
significant difference in backpressure behavior with equal overall loading of zeolites<br>
compared to the exclusive arrangement of the zeolites in the first catalyst.<br>
In principle, the storage capacity for hydrocarbons increases with rising amount of<br>
zeolites. However, the maximum usable amount of zeolites depends significantly on the<br>
porosity and the mean pore diameter of the filter substrate used. Typical zeolite loadings<br>
range from 5 g/l (filter volume) in the case of low-porosity substrates (
approx. 50 g/l in the case of substrates with relatively high porosity (&gt; 50%). The ratio<br>
of zeolites to the support materials doped with noble metal in the inventive particulate<br>
filters is preferably 0.1 to 10.<br>
The known filter substrates are suitable for the diesel particulate filters. Preference is<br>
given to using so-called wall flow filters composed of silicon carbide, cordierite,<br><br>
aluminum titanate or mullite. In order to enable optimal intercalation of the catalyst<br>
materials and of the zeolites into the pores of the filter substrates, the material of the<br>
filters should possess an open-pore structure with a porosity between 40 and 80% and a<br>
mean pore diameter between 9 and 30 µm.<br>
The invention is now illustrated with reference to the examples and figures which<br>
follow. Several diesel particulate filters with different coatings were produced and<br>
tested for their cleaning performance on an engine test bench and in a test vehicle in the<br>
NEDC European test cycle. The filters were analyzed in the fresh state and after<br>
hydrothermal aging (atmosphere composed of 10% H2O, 10% O2, remainder N2; 16 h at<br>
750°C in a chamber furnace).<br>
The substrates used were in each case a filter composed of silicon carbide with a cell<br>
density of 46.5 cm-1 (300 cpsi) and a thickness of the channel walls of 0.3 mm (12 mil).<br>
The porosity of the filter material used was 60%; the mean pore diameter was 20 urn.<br>
The filter bodies had a length of 152.4 mm.<br>
Backpressure measurements<br>
To assess the influence of the loading of particulate filters with zeolites, the<br>
backpressure of three particulate filters laden differently with support oxides and<br>
zeolites was measured in a backpressure apparatus at flow rates between 150 and<br>
300 m3/h.<br>
Filter 1 was unladen. Filter 2 received a coating with an aluminum oxide suspension<br>
which, after drying and calcination, had a loading concentration of about 30 g/l. Filter 3<br>
was coated with aluminum oxide and with a zeolite mixture of a Y zeolite and a beta<br>
zeolite (mixing ratio 1:1). Aluminum oxide and zeolites were, in accordance with the<br>
invention, ground separately until the mean particle size of aluminum oxide and of the<br>
zeolites was less than 2 µm. The loading of filter 3 was 30 g/l of aluminum oxide and<br>
10 g/l of the zeolite mixture.<br>
The measurements on the backpressure apparatus showed that the coating of filter 2<br>
with a pure aluminum oxide suspension increased the backpressure by from approx. 15<br>
to 20% compared to the uncoated filter 1. The addition of only 10 g/l of zeolite led, in<br><br>
contrast, in the case of filter 3, to a backpressure increased by approx. 50% compared to<br>
the uncoated substrate.<br>
Comparative example (filter C):<br>
A filter substrate was first coated homogeneously over the entire filter length with a<br>
Pt/Pd catalyst supported on a stabilized γ-aluminum oxide. The coating suspension was<br>
ground until a mean particle diameter of less than 2 urn had been attained. As a result,<br>
the coating step deposited the catalyst material almost completely into the pores of the<br>
filter substrate. The Pt/Pd ratio of this first catalyst layer was 2:1 and the noble metal<br>
loading was 2.12 g/l (60 g/ft3). In a second coating step, a second catalyst layer with a<br>
noble metal content of likewise 2.12 g/l (60 g/ft3) and identical Pt/Pd ratio was applied<br>
over half of the filter length. The resulting total noble metal loading of the comparative<br>
filter C was thus approx. 90 g/ft3, or 3.18 g/l. The second catalyst layer was also<br>
intercalated predominantly into the pores of the filter substrate.<br>
Example 1 (Filter F1):<br>
A second filter substrate was coated with the inventive catalyst. The filter was first<br>
coated homogeneously over the entire filter length with a noble metal loading of<br>
60 g/ft . In contrast to the comparative example, the inventive coating, however,<br>
contained, in addition to the y-aluminum oxide stabilized with Pt/Pd in a ratio of 2:1,<br>
also a zeolite mixture composed of a Y zeolite and a beta zeolite (mixing ratio 1:1).<br>
Before being added to the coating suspension, both zeolites were doped with small<br>
amounts of Pt (0.5% by weight) by means of impregnation. The ratio of y-aluminum<br>
oxide to zeolite mixture was approx. 1:1. Thereafter, in a further coating step, the entry<br>
side of the filter, over a length of 76.2 mm, was coated with an additional 2.12 g/l of<br>
noble metal using the identical coating suspension. The total concentration of the noble<br>
metals Pt and Pd on the filter F1 was thus 3.18 g/l (90 g/ft3) at a Pt/Pd ratio of 2:1.<br>
The testing of the catalytic activity of the two filters was carried out in the fresh state<br>
and after a hydrothermal furnace aging on a EURO IV certified passenger vehicle with<br>
a 103 kW 2.01 diesel engine with pump-nozzle injection system. The filters were<br>
arranged close to the engine and were analyzed without an upstream diesel oxidation<br><br>
catalyst in the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) test cycle. The results including<br>
the untreated emissions of the vehicle are compiled in table 1.<br>
The emissions in the NEDC show clearly that the use of the zeolites as an HC storage<br>
component in filters Fl significantly reduced HC emission both in the fresh state and<br>
after hard thermal aging (16 hours, 790°C). What is remarkable is that the same is also<br>
true for CO emissions. After aging, a reduction in CO emissions by more than 30% is<br>
observed.<br>
Example 2 (Filter F2 and F3):<br>
Analogously to example 1 (filter Fl), two further filter substrates were coated with a<br>
noble metal loading of 3.18 g/l. In the filter F2, in contrast to the filter F1, the amount of<br>
zeolite of 20 g/l was applied over the entire filter length exclusively in the first catalyst<br>
layer. In filter F3, the zeolites were applied exclusively with the second catalyst layer.<br>
The zeolites used were, as in example 1. a mixture of a Y zeolite and a beta zeolite<br>
(mixing ratio 1:1). The two zeolites used had each been doped with 0.5% by weight of<br>
Pt.<br>
The catalytic activity of the filters F2 and F3 was likewise carried out both fresh and<br>
after hydrothermal oven aging on a EURO IV certified passenger vehicle with a<br>
103 kW 2.0 1 diesel engine with pump-nozzle injection system. The results are likewise<br>
reproduced in table 1.<br>
Especially after hydrothermal aging at 790°C, an improved emission performance both<br>
in relation to the hydrocarbons emitted in the NEDC and to the CO emissions was also<br>
found for filters F2 and F3. It is found to be advantageous to use the HC storage<br>
components over the entire filter length. A division of the amount of zeolite between the<br>
first and second catalyst shows no advantage compared to the exclusive use of the<br>
zeolites in the first catalyst. The exclusive use of the zeolites in the second catalyst is<br>
less favorable with regard to the emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the<br>
NEDC. Compared to Fl, HC emission increases by approx. 60%; CO emissions rise by<br>
approx. 18%. In spite of this, the use of the zeolites in the "high-loading" zone at the<br><br>
filter inlet also brings about a significant reduction in pollutant emissions in the NEDC<br>
compared to the filter V of the comparative example.<br><br>
Example 3 (Filter F4, F5, F6, F7):<br>
In a further test program, four catalytically coated particulate filters were coated with<br>
different amounts of zeolites. The four filters F4 to F7 were produced analogously to<br>
filter Fl. The filters were first coated homogeneously over the entire filter length with a<br>
noble metal loading of 2.12 g/l (corresponds to 60 g/ft3). In a second coating step, the<br>
filters were coated with a zone over a length of 76.2 mm with an additional 2.12 g/l of<br>
noble metal, so as to give rise to a total noble metal loading of 90 g/ft3 (Pt/Pd = 2:1).<br>
While the amount of support oxides (stabilized γ-aluminum oxide) was kept constant,<br>
the four filters were coated with different amounts of zeolite (from 10 to 40 g/l), the<br>
same zeolite mixture composed of 50% Y zeolite and 50% beta zeolite as for filter F1<br>
having been used both for the first and for the second catalyst. The Pt concentration on<br>
the zeolites was 0.5% by weight. Table 2 shows the compositions of the four inventive<br>
filters F4-F7.<br><br>
To test the HC storage capacity of the inventive filters as a function of the zeolite<br>
content, storage tests were carried out on a 4 cylinder diesel engine with a common rail<br>
injection system (2.21, 100 kW). The storage tests were carried out at a constant engine<br>
operating point with a filter inlet temperature of approx. 110°C. The HC emissions<br>
upstream and downstream of the catalyst were recorded with the aid of an FID analyzer<br>
(AMA 2000, Pierburg). The storage tests were each conducted until the HC<br>
concentration downstream of the catalyst had reached a steady-state value for the<br>
duration of approx. 10 minutes. The amount of HC stored was determined from the HC<br>
concentrations upstream and downstream of the catalyst:<br>
The results shown in table 2 show clearly that the amount of HC stored increases<br>
sharply as a result of the use of zeolites. Even the use of 10 g/1 of zeolite leads to a 2.5-<br>
fold increase in the amount of hydrocarbons stored in the storage test. With a further<br>
increase in zeolite content in the individual catalyst, the HC storage capacity increases<br>
continuously. Only at zeolite contents above 25 g/1 does a kind of saturation behavior<br>
appear to occur.<br>
Table 2: Noble metal content and zeolite loading for the filters F4 to F7 and the<br>
amount of HC stored during the HC storage test on the engine test bench<br><br>
The storage of hydrocarbons by the HC storage components reduces the adsorption of<br>
hydrocarbon species at the active oxidation sites of the catalyst. This also positively<br>
influences the conversion of carbon monoxide.<br><br>
The intercalation of the zeolites into the pores of the filter substrate substantially<br>
suppresses their adverse effect on the backpressure of the filter.<br><br>
