				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to container lid with tear-off strip for plastic containers,<br>
where the lids have tear-off strips to facilitate the removal of the lids.<br>
Background Art<br>
In larger plastic containers, such as paint containers capable of holding many<br>
litres of paint, it is necessary to provide a strong attachment and good seal between the<br>
container and the lid, especially for shipping purposes. Usually, interlocking or<br>
inter-engaging flanges are provided on the lid and the upper peripheral edge portion of<br>
the container to retain the lid on the container. The difficulty is that the stronger is the<br>
engagement between these interlocking flanges, and thus the stronger the attachment of<br>
the- lid to the container, the more difficult it is to remove the lid when it is desired to do<br>
so. Ideally, one would like to have good engagement between the lid and the container<br>
for shipping purposes, and some means for relieving or reducing the force of<br>
engagement between the lid and the container when it is desirable to remove the lid.<br>
One method of accomplishing the above objectives is to provide the lid with a<br>
tear-off strip that contains the lid locking flange that engages the container locking<br>
flange. When the lid is on the container, the engaged locking flanges hold the lid<br>
securely onto the container. When it is desired to remove the lid, the lid tear-off strip is<br>
removed, so there is no longer any locking engagement between the lid and the<br>
container. The lid is then easy to remove.<br>
Sometimes, however, after the lid is removed, it is desirable to put the<br>
lid back on the container and still have a good seal between the lid and the<br>
container. One way of achieving this result is shown in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,735,337 issued to John W. Von Holdt. In this patent, the lid outer skirt that<br>
contains the locking flange is provided with a zigzag tear line that defines a<br>
tear-off strip. The tear line passes repeatedly through the locking flange, so<br>
that upon removal of the tear-off strip, portions of the locking flange as<br>
removed and only spaced-apart portions of the lid skirt locking flange<br>
remain. These remaining portions then provide a lid lock with reduced<br>
holding power, so that the lid can be removed and replaced.<br>
Another example of such a lid is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,930,656<br>
issued to Henry J. Blanchette. In this Blanchette patent, an intennittent<br>
locking flange is provided on the lid peripheral skirt and an undulating<br>
annular groove is provided to form a tear-off strip. When the tear-strip is<br>
removed, the lid ends up with bendable flaps containing the locking flanges,<br>
and these flaps yield to permit easier removal and replacement of the lid.<br>
One difficulty with the prior art Von Holdt and Blanchette patents is<br>
that the zig zag or undulating tear-off strips are difficult to remove. The<br>
tooling to make the lids shown in these patents is also expensive because of<br>
the complex nature of the tear lines. The lid shown in the Blanchette patent is<br>
also not as strongly retained on the container as would be desired, because<br>
only partial locking flanges are provided on the lid skirt.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In the present invention, a double locking flange is provided to<br>
securely hold the lid on the container. One of the locking flanges is totally<br>
removed along with the tear-off strip leaving a second, intennittent yieldable<br>
locking flange for retention and reseating of the lid on the container.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a lid for a container having upper<br>
and lower peripheral, annular, outwardly disposed locking flanges, the flanges having<br>
undersides for locking engagement with the container lid. The lid comprises a central<br>
portion and a peripheral annular skirt adapted to overlie the container locking flanges.<br>
The annular skirt defines an annular groove dividing the skirt into a skirt upper portion<br>
located adjacent to the container upper locking flange, and a lower tear-off strip portion<br>
located adjacent to the container lower locking flange. The skirt upper portion has<br>
inwardly disposed intermittent locking flange segments adapted to engage the underside<br>
of the container upper locking flange. Also, the tear-off strip portion defines an<br>
inwardly disposed locking flange adapted to engage the underside of the container<br>
lower locking flange.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment of a lid according to the<br>
present invention shown mounted on a container;<br>
Figure 2 is an enlarged perspective view, partly broken away, showing the<br>
interlocking flanges between the lid and container shown in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a further enlarged perspective view of the portion of Figure 2<br>
indicated by chain-dotted circle 3;<br>
Figure 4 is an enlarged view of the portion of Figure 1 indicated in<br>
bychain-dotted circle 4;<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view of the upper portion of Figure 1 showing one<br>
preferred embodiment of the locking flanges on the lid of the present invention; and<br>
Figure 6 is a perspective view similar to Figure 5 but showing another preferred<br>
embodiment of the locking flanges on the lid of the present invention.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Referring firstly to Figure 1, a preferred embodiment of a container lid<br>
according to the present invention is generally located by reference numeral<br>
10. Lid 10 is shown mounted on a container 12, but container 12 is not<br>
considered to be part of the present invention per se. Lid 10 includes a<br>
planar central portion 14 and a peripheral annular skirt 16. The size of<br>
container 12 is such that it holds typically from about 4 to 20 litres, and<br>
container 12 and lid 14 are most commonly made from plastic, such as<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene. However, any plastic or other material can<br>
be used for lid 10 that has some resiliency, as will be described further<br>
below.<br>
Referring next to Figures 2 and 3, container 12 is shown having an<br>
upper, peripheral, annular, outwardly disposed locking flange 18 and a lower,<br>
annular, outwardly disposed locking flange 20 spaced from or below locking<br>
flange 18. Locking flanges 18, 20 have respective undersides 22, 24 for<br>
locking engagement with lid 10, as described further below. Container 12<br>
also has a further peripheral annular flange 26 which forms the rim or brim<br>
of container 12. and which is located in an annular sealing groove 28 in lid<br>
10 located between the lid central portion 14 and the peripheral annular skin<br>
16. When lid 10 is located on container 12, the container annular flange 26 is<br>
wedged into lid sealing groove 28 to provide a good seal between the<br>
container and the lid. In other words, sealing groove 28 sealingly engages<br>
the rim 26 of the container.<br>
As seen best in Figure 3, the lid annular skirt 16 overlies the container<br>
locking flanges 18, 20. Annular skirt 16 defines or has an annular groove 30<br>
which divides skirt 16 into a skirt upper portion 32 located adjacent to the<br>
container upper locking flange 18, and a lower tear-off strip portion 34<br>
located adjacent to the container lower locking flange 20. Annular groove 30<br>
can be on the inside surface of annular skirt 16 or the outside surface of this<br>
skirt, or partially in both.<br>
As seen best in Figures 3 and 4 to 6, the skirt upper portion 32 is<br>
formed with inwardly disposed intermittent locking flange segments 36<br>
which are adapted to engage the underside 22 of the container upper locking<br>
flange 18. Similarly, the tear-off strip portion 34 defines or has an inwardly<br>
disposed locking flange 38 which is adapted to engage the underside 24 of<br>
the container lower locking flange 20.<br>
As seen best in Figure 4, skirt upper portion 32 is formed with<br>
triangularly shaped openings or windows 40 therein on either side of the<br>
locking flange segments 36. Windows 40 border on the annular groove 30,<br>
so that upon removal of tear-off strip portion 34, as will be described below,<br>
windows 40 turn into downwardly disposed recesses or notches on either side<br>
of the locking flange segments 36. The part of skirt or upper portion 32<br>
located between windows 40 that contains locking flange segments 36 thus<br>
becomes a flap 42 that can be pried outwardly and upwardly to release the<br>
locking flange segments 36 from container upper locking flange 18 and thus<br>
allow for the easy removal of lid 10 from container 12.<br>
If desired, skirt upper portion 32 can be formed with a thin wall or<br>
membrane (not shown) as part of windows 40. Such membranes, which<br>
typically would be about .2 to .5 mm (0.008 to 0.020 inches) thick, would<br>
prevent dirt or other foreign matter from entering windows 40 and collecting<br>
on flange 20. Such membranes would be easily broken upon flaps 42 being<br>
pried upwardly to remove lid 10 from container 12.<br>
As seen best in Figure 4, tear-off strip portion 34 is formed with a<br>
window 44 located adjacent to annular groove 30. Again, window 44 could<br>
have a thin wall or membrane covering to keep dirt out, or it could be an<br>
actual opening formed in tear-off strip portion 34. Tear-off strip portion 34<br>
has a lower peripheral edge 46, and tear-off strip portion 34 is formed with a<br>
reduced thickness portion 48 located between window 44 and lower<br>
peripheral edge 46. To remove tear-off strip portion 34, one can insert a tool,<br>
such a screwdriver into window 44 and pry the tear-off strip portion 34<br>
outwardly to break reduced thickness portion 48. This provides a flap or tab<br>
50 that can be grasped and pulled outwardly to tear the tear-off strip portion<br>
34 along groove 30 to remove tear-off strip portion 34. It will be appreciated<br>
that removal of tear-off strip 34 also removes the locking flange or flanges<br>
38, leaving only the intermittent locking flange segments 36 to engage the<br>
container. This permits lid 10 to be removed easily by prying up flaps 42, yet<br>
the intermittent locking flange segment 36 permit lid 10 to be placed again<br>
on container 12 with good sealing engagement between the container rim or<br>
annular flange 26 and lid sealing groove 28. It will also be appreciated that<br>
breaking reduced thickness portion 48, and perhaps window 44. is a tamper<br>
evidence feature for lid 10.<br>
Referring again to Figure 5, it will be seen that in this embodiment, lid<br>
10 is provided with 4 equi-spaced intermittent locking flange segments 36 on<br>
the skirt upper portion 32. Also, tear-off strip portion 34 has an inwardly<br>
disposed locking flange 38 that is a continuous annular flange located around<br>
the inside of tear-off strip portion 34. Locking flange 38 passes over the<br>
reduced thickness portion 48, and depending on me thickness of locking<br>
flange 38, it may be necessary to insert a knife into window 44 and cut<br>
downwardly through locking flange 38 and reduced thickness portion 48 in<br>
order to break out tab 50 in this embodiment.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 6, there are only two<br>
diametrically opposed locking flange segments 36 on the inside of skirt upper<br>
portion 32. Also, tear-off strip portion 34 has a pair of semi-circular and<br>
inwardly disposed locking flanges or flange segments 38 rattier than a<br>
continuous locking flange 38. The Figure 6 embodiment is useful for smaller<br>
containers where the lids need not be held so securely on containers 12. The<br>
Figure 5 embodiment is useful for larger containers where stronger retention<br>
between the lid and the container is desired. In feet, locking flange segments<br>
36 could be located between ail of the pairs of openings 40 to make an even<br>
stronger connection between the lid and the container. It will be appreciated<br>
that the size and the length and the number of locking flanges 36 and 38 can<br>
be configured as desired to give the necessary shipping strength to the<br>
container and lid combination of the present invention, or to provide for<br>
easier or more difficult removal and reinstallation of lid 10 for the re-use of<br>
container 12.<br>
As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the<br>
foregoing disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the<br>
practice of this invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof.<br>
