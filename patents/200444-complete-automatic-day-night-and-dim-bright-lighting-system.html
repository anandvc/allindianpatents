Application NO.811/MAS/2002-528/RQ/C1 {E/2003 Abdul Razak. T.P<br>
This invention relates to automatic day night and dim bright lighting system for motor vehicles. At present no automatic system for day-night and dim-bright operation of headlights is used in motor vehicles. This invention offers a complete solution for all problems relating to dim bright operation of the vehicle. Nowadays public roads are witnessing rising num her of road accidents. Lack of adequate dim bright operation of headlights is the main reason for all motor accidents the objectives of present invention is to provide a complete and perfect solution for problems relating driving of motor vehicles<br>
At present one kind of automatic dim bright system is used in motor vehicles. This system using L.D.R mechanism. The main drawback of this L.D.R mechanism is that it is affected by all kinds of lights. Even by a mere tube light it will be operated. Where as the present system will be operated by the lights coming from headlight of opposite vehicle.<br>
The Present invention introduces a complete automatic system which operates head lights and its dim bright function automatically. No remote controller or switches is required for operating this system. This system controlled by infrared rays which are included iii the headlights of the motor vehicle. Other forms of lights; tube light, mercury light, neon bulbs etc... will not affect the operation of the system as these forms of lights contain no infra red rays. This system provides day night operating function of headlights. If this system is installed in motor vehicles headlights will be operated automatically. This system is having a range of 100 meters to 500 meters (receives lights from 100 to 500 meters). When two vehicles come face to face during night the headlights of the vehicle will automatically dim and after passing the vehicle it will be automatically bright. Moreover, whenever light is required the headlight is lighted. Some time due to some climatical reasons shortage of s light may occur. To such situation also the system is very much helpful.<br>
In addition to that usually a driver is bound to send light signals to other vehicle which are trying to overtake him. The driver may or may not be bothered about send in light signals to other vehicles behind him. Or if he is inadvertently omitted to give light signal, this system will automatically give light signals to other accompanying vehicles with the hell) of an indicator fitted on the hack of the vehicle. This light signal will be very useful to overtaking vehicle to overcome accidents during night. As it requires no manual operation of head lights.<br>
In short once this system is installed no care or attention is required for the operation of the headlights. Thus, the present invention is having much relevance and potential in commercial application. The present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A complete automatic day night and dim bright lighting system comprising auto day night control circuit and auto dim bright control circuit where in auto day night control circuit comprises a photo diode PI and two transistors (PNP &amp; NPN) (Tl &amp;. T2) relay RLYl in which collector(C) of the transistor Tl is connected to the base (B) of transistor T2 and base (b) of the transistor Tl is connected to the Photo diode PI Through a<br><br>
resistance Rl and special indicating lamp the said auto dim bright control circuit comprising photo diode P2 transistors T3, T4, T5 relay, RLY2, filament Fl F2.<br>
According to the present invention there are two circuits<br>
1.	Auto day night control system (Circuit No.!) Fig.No.2<br>
2.	Auto dim bright system (Circuit No.l!) Fig.3, 4, 5<br>
3.	Fig. a drawing of a vehicle seen a position of (photo diode) PI and P2 and STP (adjustable steal pipe) included the photo diode and F3 (special Indicator)<br>
The theory on which this invention is based is that when a .005 bias volt is given to the base of the transistor the emitter and collector oil the transistor will be worked as semi¬conductor or conductor. (Functioned circuit).<br>
On receipt of the headlights containing infra-red rays 10 to 500 ohms resistance is created in the photo diode according to the availability of headlights this bias resistance is given the base of the above said transistor.<br><br>
811 MAS 2002(528 RO/CHi: WO^i<br>
l.Auto day night control system (Circuit No 1J<br>
This circuit make headlight on night time and make off day time. This system comprises one photo diode v^hich is refered as PI and two transistors (PNP and NPN) and relay. PI diode is to be instated on the inner roof of the vehicle as seen in the drawing No.l*so as to receive indirect sun light during day time. During day time PI diode receive sunlight and there will be a resistence of 10 to 500 ohms.Then negative supply reaches the base of the transistor Tl (sklOO driver transistor) through the re¬sistance Rl.Emiter and collector become semiconductor (from emitter to collector) and positive supplyof 005 to 3 volt reach the base of the transistor T2 (A13005 power tran¬sistor). Power transistor T2 amplify the supply and its emitter and collector come in conduction. As the emitter connected to the earth collector receive negative volt (12volt).<br>
One pole of the relay connected to positive line and second pole is connected to collector. Thus,12 volt supply comes in relay coil as negative and positive. Relay coil starts working. Armecher (general pole) attracted from switch pole SI to S2 as seen in the drawing No 2 Armeture is connected to positive line . In the result no supply is going to second circuit. Hence, headlight will not be operated during day time. (Draw¬ing in sheet no 2 shows the working of the system in day time)<br>
Auto dim bright - light system (Circuit No 11,)<br>
This circuit comprises one photo diode (referred as P2 in drawing), two PNP transistors (referred as T3 and T4), one NPN transistor which is referred as T5, and one relay. P2 diode is to be fitted in front of the vehicle so as to receive light from the headlights of the vehicle coming from opposite side. During night time PI will be non conductor as it receive no sun light. . During night supply goes to circuit no2 through switch pole S3 and head light is lighted. (Drawing in sheet no3)<br>
When a vehicle come in opposite direction, face to face the head light including infrared rays fall on the P2diode and a resistance will be generated according to the availability of the light. That resistance, produce a negative volt in the circuit. A negative 3 voltage reaches the base of the PNP transistor T3 (SKI 00) through filter resistance R4 (220K). Collector of the transistor T3 is connected with negative earth and emiter is connected to the base of transistor T4. T4 transistor starts working and its collector and emitter are come in conduction. So a negative supply is received by the base of transistor T4 through filter resistance R5. The emitter of T4 transistor is con¬nected to positive line. T4 transistor starts working and emitter and collector are come conduction. In the result a positive volt is received by the base of NPN transistor TS (A13005). NPN transistor requires positive signal volt for amplification. So emitter and collector of the T5 transistor are in conduction and collector gets 12 volt negative voltCoil pole No.3 is connected to positive line. So relay coil receives 12 volt as positive and negative. Relay coil starts working. Armeture attracted from S3 to S4.(as seen in draw¬ing No 4) dim filament is lighted as S4 is connected to dim filament. A Special indica¬tion light is fitted on the back of the vehicle.<br><br>
applicationNo.811/MAS/2002-528/RQ/CHE/2003<br>
As this indicator is connected with S4 ( a special signal is given).  Then the signal fila¬ment is lighted.  After passing the vehicle coming from oposit direction P2 gets no lights and it will be non conductor and transistor also recieve no suply.  Amature of the relay goes to the former position ( From Switch pole S4 to S3) and bright filament be-come on position as bright filament is connected with S3. A variable resister 2 Meg ohms (Seen Circuit No.2 R3) provide to controll the negative signal wich is proceed out of the reciept of the light from die oflier vehicle, rtie headlight recieving capacity of P2 can be incresed from 100 m to 500 m by using neccessary.<br>
IN 4007 diod reffered as Dl in the drawing and C1-220MFD 250 volt condenser is provided as rectifiers to convert AC to DC Hence the system will be working in AC and DC<br><br><br><br>
