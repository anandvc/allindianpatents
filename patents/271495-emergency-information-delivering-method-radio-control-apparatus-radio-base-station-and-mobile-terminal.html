				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
EMERGENCY INFORMATION DELIVERING METHOD, RADIO CONTROL<br>
APPARATUS, RADIO BASE STATION AND MOBILE TERMINAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an emergency information<br>
delivering method for delivering emergency information to a<br>
mobile terminal with use of broadcast communication, and also<br>
relates to a radio control apparatus, a radio base station, and<br>
a mobile terminal.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
The Japan Meteorological Agency is planning to start<br>
delivering the Earthquake Early Warning (emergency information)<br>
to the public (television, radio, administrative radio<br>
communication for disaster prevention, announcement in an<br>
amusement facility, and the like) on October 1, 2007. The<br>
Earthquake Early Warning (emergency information) is also<br>
expected to be delivered to mobile terminals.<br>
[0003]<br>
In addition, there is a request from local governments to<br>
deliver emergency information to a ma j ority of users in the event<br>
of emergency such as a disaster. Accordingly, there is a need<br>
to instantly deliver emergency information of a terror, a warning,<br>
a large-scale accident, or the like to a majority of users.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, a current mobile communication system (a mail<br>
delivery system and the like) is not capable of instantly<br>
delivering emergency information to a majority of mobile<br>
terminals in view of radio communication resources.<br>
Accordingly, a broadcasting system is needed to meet the<br>
requirements for such instant, large-scale delivery.<br>
[0005]<br>
The CBS (Cell Broadcast Service) and the MBMS (Multimedia<br>
Broadcast Multicast Service) are known as schemes standardized<br>
in the 3GPP to build the broadcast system.<br>
However, it takes approximately 10 seconds for such an<br>
existing broadcast system to deliver emergency information to<br>
a majority of mobile terminals.<br>
[0006]<br>
This is because a network has to activate a broadcast<br>
communication function (for example, a CBS receiving function)<br>
of each mobile terminal, before delivering emergency information<br>
as a broadcast communication message. Keeping the broadcast<br>
communication function of the mobile terminal active all the<br>
time significantly influences the running time of the battery.<br>
[0007]<br>
It is strongly demanded socially to shorten as much as<br>
possible the time needed to deliver emergency information, such<br>
as Earthquake Early Warning, that may affect human lives, because<br>
the shortening of the time may lead to saving the human lives.<br>
The time needed to deliver emergency information should be<br>
reduced to several seconds<br>
[0008]<br>
There is also a demand for emergency information to be<br>
delivered to a user roaming in a country other than the user's<br>
own country.<br>
[0009]<br>
Each mobile terminal is configured to receive only the<br>
broadcast communication message having a message identifier<br>
included in a "reception ID list (a list of message identifiers<br>
each identifying a broadcast communication message to be<br>
received)" that the mobile terminal itself holds. For this<br>
reason, in order for the mobile terminal to receive a broadcast<br>
communication message notifying of emergency information in a<br>
country other than the user's own country, there is a need to<br>
define an internationally-common message identifier (emergency<br>
information message identifier) identifying a broadcast<br>
communication message notifying of emergency information.<br>
[0010]<br>
However, in Japan and other countries, each<br>
telecommunication carrier has already defined its own emergency<br>
informationmessage identifier, and a mobile terminal inamemory<br>
of which an emergency information message identifier defined<br>
by its own telecommunication carrier is written is already in<br>
widespread use. This results in the coexistence of a mobile<br>
terminal having a "reception ID list" in which an emergency<br>
communication message identifier common across the world is set<br>
and a mobile terminal having a "reception ID list" in which an<br>
emergency information message identifier unique to its own<br>
telecommunication carrier is set.<br>
[0011]<br>
In such a circumstance, the network for delivering emergency<br>
information as a broadcast communication message needs to<br>
transmit both of a broadcast communication message including<br>
an emergency informationmessage identifier that is common across<br>
the world and a broadcast communication message including an<br>
emergency information message identifier uniquely given by a<br>
telecommunication carrier. This causes the problem that<br>
reception delay occurs among the mobile terminals that receive<br>
the broadcast communication messages respectively including<br>
different emergency information message identifiers.<br>
[0012]<br>
To solve this problem, there should be a migration method<br>
taking account of a circumstance where there coexist a mobile<br>
terminal using an emergency information message identifier<br>
unique to its own carrier and a mobile terminal using an emergency<br>
information message identifier common across the world, the<br>
emergency information message identifiers being used to<br>
determine whether or not to receive an emergency information<br>
message. Specifically, the migration method is to conduct<br>
gradual unification to an emergency information message<br>
identifier common across the world, while delivering, as a<br>
broadcast communication message, emergency information also to<br>
a mobile terminal having an emergency information message<br>
identifier unique to its own telecommunication carrier, without<br>
reception delay among mobile terminals respectively using<br>
different emergency information message identifiers.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]<br>

aforementioned problem and aims to provide an emergency<br>
information deliveringmethod, a radio control apparatus, a radio<br>
base station, and a mobile terminal which can notify, to each<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0028]<br>
(Configuration of Emergency Information Delivering System<br>
according to First Embodiment of Present Invention)<br>
A configuration of an emergency information delivering<br>
system according to a first embodiment of the present invention<br>
will be described with reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.<br>
[0029]<br>
First, with reference to Fig. 1, description will be given<br>
of differences between a conventional emergency information<br>
delivery scheme and an emergency information delivery scheme<br>
using the emergency information delivering system according to<br>
this embodiment.<br>
[0030]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1(a), in the conventional emergency<br>
information delivery scheme, a mobile terminal cannot notify,<br>
to a user, an occurrence of an emergency situation, before<br>
receiving emergency information (detailed information)<br>
transmitted as a broadcast communication message.<br>
[0031]<br>
In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1(b), in the emergency<br>
information delivery scheme according to this embodiment, when<br>
receiving a paging signal including a "type of emergency<br>
information" and an "overview of emergency information", amobile<br>
terminal can first notify, to a user, an occurrence of an emergency<br>
situation, the type of the emergency situation, and the overview<br>
of the emergency situation. Thereafter, the mobile terminal<br>
can notify, to the user, the details of the emergency situation,<br>
when receiving the detailed information of the emergency<br>
information.<br>
[0032]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the emergency information delivering<br>
system according to this embodiment includes an emergency<br>
information delivery apparatus 1, a core network apparatus 2,<br>
a radio control apparatus (or a radio base station) 3, and a<br>
mobile terminal 4.<br>
[0033]<br>
The emergency information delivery apparatus 1 includes<br>
a generator unit 11 and a delivering unit 12.<br>
[0034]<br>
The generator unit 11 is configured to generate emergency<br>
information when an emergency situation occurs. The delivering<br>
unit 12 is configured to deliver the emergency information<br>
generated by the generator unit 11, to the core network apparatus<br>
2.<br>
[0035]<br>
The core network apparatus 2 includes a receiver unit 21,<br>
a generator unit 22, and a delivering unit 23.<br>
[0036]<br>
The receiver unit 21 is configured to receive the emergency<br>
information transmitted from the emergency information delivery<br>
apparatus 1.<br>
[0037]<br>
The generator unit 22 is configured to generate a "type<br>
of emergency information", an "overview of emergency<br>
information", "detailed information of emergency information",<br>
and a "terminal operation identifier" that specifies the<br>
operation of the mobile terminal 4, on the basis of the emergency<br>
information received by the receiver unit 21.<br>
[0038]<br>
The delivering unit 23 is configured to deliver the "type<br>
of emergency information", the "overview of emergency<br>
information", the "detailed information of emergency<br>
information", and the "terminal operation identifier" generated<br>
by the generator unit 22, to the radio control apparatus (or<br>
the radio base station) 3.<br>
[0039]<br>
In addition, the delivering unit 23 may be configured to<br>
specify a delivery area of the emergency information (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as an emergency-information delivery area) to the<br>
radio control apparatus (or the radio base station) 3.<br>
[0040]<br>
The radio control apparatus (or the radio base station)<br>
3 includes a receiver unit 31 and a delivering unit 32.<br>
[0041]<br>
The receiver unit 31 is configured to receive the "type<br>
of emergency information", the "overview of emergency<br>
information", the "detailed information of emergency<br>
information", and the "terminal operation identifier"<br>
transmitted from the core network apparatus 2.<br>
[0042]<br>
The delivering unit 32 is configured to notify, to the mobile<br>
terminal 4, the generation of emergency information to be<br>
received (that is, the occurrence of the emergency situation) ,<br>
by using a paging signal to activate a broadcast communication<br>
system of the mobile terminal 4.<br>
[0043]<br>
Specifically, the delivering unit 32 is configured to<br>
transmit the paging signal including the "type of emergency<br>
information", the "overview of emergency information", the<br>
"terminal operation identifier", and the like described above,<br>
to the mobile station 4 that belongs to the aforementioned<br>
"emergency-information delivery area".<br>
[0044]<br>
In addition, the delivering unit 32 is configured to<br>
incorporate an "emergency information identifier" that<br>
identifies the detailed information of the emergency information<br>
in the aforementioned paging signal.<br>
[0045]<br>
Moreover, the delivering unit 32 is configured to transmit<br>
the "detailed information of emergency information" as a<br>
broadcast communication message to the mobile terminal 4, after<br>
transmitting the paging signal (after the broadcast<br>
communication function of the mobile terminal 4 is activated) .<br>
[0046]<br>
The mobile terminal 4 includes a receiver unit 41, an<br>
emergency information notifying unit 42, and a detailed<br>
information display unit 43.<br>
[0047]<br>
The receiver unit 41 is configured to receive the paging<br>
signal transmitted from the radio control apparatus (or the radio<br>
base station) 3, and to activate the broadcast communication<br>
function upon reception of the paging signal.<br>
[0048]<br>
In addition, the receiver unit 41 is configured to receive<br>
the detailed information of emergency information transmitted<br>
from the radio control apparatus (or the radio base station)<br>
3 as a broadcast communication message, after activating the<br>
broadcast communication function.<br>
[0049]<br>
Moreover, the receiver unit 41 is configured to manage a<br>
broadcast communication message to be received.<br>
[0050]<br>
Specifically, the receiver unit 41 is configured to manage<br>
a message identifier for identifying the broadcast communication<br>
message to be received, using a reception ID list.<br>
[0051]<br>
In addition, the receiver unit 41 is basically configured<br>
to receive only the broadcast communication message managed as<br>
a broadcast communication message to be received, namely, the<br>
broadcast communication message including the message<br>
identifier managed in the reception ID list.<br>
[0052]<br>
However, the receiver unit 41 is configured to receive a<br>
broadcast communication message including the "emergency<br>
information identifier", even when the broadcast communication<br>
message is not managed as a broadcast communication message to<br>
be received, or in other words, even when the broadcast<br>
communication message does not include the message identifier<br>
managed in the reception ID list.<br>
[0053]<br>
In addition, the receiver unit 41 is similarly configured<br>
to receive the paging signal including the "emergency information<br>
identifier" without fail.<br>
[0054]<br>
The emergency information notifying unit 42 is configured<br>
to notify, to the user, the "generation of the emergency<br>
information to be received (the occurrence of the emergency<br>
situation), when the "generation of the emergency information<br>
to be received (the occurrence of the emergency situation)" is<br>
notified by using the paging signal received by the receiver<br>
unit 41.<br>
[0055]<br>
Specifically, the emergency information notifying unit 42<br>
may be configured to perform the aforementioned notification<br>
to the user, by performing a display corresponding to the "type<br>
of emergency information" included in the paging signal received<br>
by the receiver unit 41 (a display of predetermined characters,<br>
images, or video images).<br>
[0056]<br>
For example, when the mobile terminal 4 is roaming, the<br>
emergency information notifying unit 42 may perform the display<br>
corresponding to the "type of emergency information" in a<br>
language of a roaming destination country.<br>
[0057]<br>
In addition, the emergency information notifying unit 42<br>
may be configured to perform the aforementioned notification<br>
to the user, by displaying the "overview of emergency<br>
information" included in the paging signal received by the<br>
receiver unit 41.<br>
[0058]<br>
Moreover, the emergency information notifying unit 42 may<br>
be configured to perform the aforementioned notification to the<br>
user, by performing an operation specified by the "terminal<br>
operation identifier" included in the paging signal received<br>
by the receiver unit 41.<br>
[0059]<br>
For example, what is assumed as the operation specified<br>
by the "terminal operation identifier" is any selected operation<br>
such as a predetermined buzzer sound and a popup display. The<br>
detailed information display unit 43 is configured to display<br>
the "detailed information of emergency information" received<br>
as a broadcast communication message, after the broadcast<br>
communication function is activatedby thepaging signal received<br>
by the receiver unit 41.<br>
[0060]<br>
(Operation of Mobile Communication System according to First<br>
Embodiment of Present Invention)<br>
An operation of the emergency information delivering system<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present invention will<br>
be described with reference to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.<br>
[0061]<br>
First, with reference to Fig. 3, description will be given<br>
of the operation of delivering emergency information (Earthquake<br>
Early Warning) using the CBS system<br>
[0062]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, in step S1001, an emergency information<br>
delivery apparatus CBE (Cell Broadcast Entity) delivers<br>
information required to deliver emergency information to a core<br>
network apparatus CBC (Cell Broadcast Center) . The information<br>
includes the "emergency-information delivery area", the "type<br>
of emergency information (for example, the kind of a disaster) ",<br>
the "overview of emergency information", and the "terminal<br>
operation identifier".<br>
[0063]<br>
Here, if there is only an "Earthquake Early Warning", as<br>
the "type of emergency information", the core network apparatus<br>
CBC understands the "type of emergency information", and hence<br>
the deliver of the "type of emergency information" can be omitted.<br>
[0064]<br>
In addition, if the "overview of emergency information"<br>
is generated in the core network apparatus CBC, the deliver of<br>
the "overview of emergency information" can be omitted.<br>
[0065]<br>
In step S1002, based on the information received from the<br>
emergency information delivery apparatus CBE, the core network<br>
apparatus CBC transmits the following in addition to a normal<br>
parameter for the CBS, to a radio control apparatus RNC (or a<br>
radio base station) covering the "emergency-information<br>
delivery area". Specifically, transmitted are the "emergency<br>
information identifier", the "type of emergency information",<br>
the "overview of emergency information", the "detailed<br>
information of emergency information", the "terminal operation<br>
identifier", and the "emergency-information delivery area".<br>
[0066]<br>
Specifically, the core network apparatus CBC adds the<br>
following information elements to a parameter "Write-Replace"<br>
defined in TS25.419(SABP), and transmits the information<br>
elements. Specifically, the information elements added are the<br>
"emergency information identifier", the "type of emergency<br>
information", the "overview of emergency information", the<br>
"detailed information of emergency information", the "terminal<br>
operation identifier", and the "emergency-information delivery<br>
area".<br>
[0067]<br>
In step S1003, when the "emergency information identifier"<br>
is set for the parameter "Write-Replace" that the radio control<br>
apparatus RNC (or the radio base station) has received from the<br>
core network apparatus CBC, the radio control apparatus RNC (or<br>
the radio base station) incorporates the "type of emergency<br>
information", the "overview of emergency information", and the<br>
"terminal operation identifier" in a CBS paging signal (defined<br>
in RRC:3GPP TS25.331), so as to notify to a mobile terminal UE<br>
that belongs to the "emergency-information delivery area".<br>
[0068]<br>
In step S1004, the mobile terminal UE that has received<br>
the CBS paging signal makes simplified notification to a user<br>
of the occurrence of an earthquake and an overview of the<br>
earthquake, while linking the "type of emergency information<br>
(Earthquake Early Warning)" and the "overview of emergency<br>
information".<br>
[0069]<br>
Further, the mobile terminal UE performs an operation<br>
specified by the "terminal operation identifier" (for example,<br>
a buzzer sound) when the mobile terminal UE performs the<br>
aforementioned notification.<br>
[0070]<br>
Here, the amount of information to be transmitted can be<br>
minimized by causing the mobile terminal UE to preliminarily<br>
determine a parameter for the "overview of emergency information"<br>
and where to insert the parameter for the "overview of emergency<br>
information" notified by the "overview of emergency information"<br>
in a defined format created by the mobile terminal UE.<br>
[0071]<br>
In step S1005, the radio control apparatus RNC (or the radio<br>
base station) delivers the detailed information of the emergency<br>
information to the mobile terminal UE as a broadcast<br>
communication message (a BMC CBS message).<br>
[0072]<br>
In step S1006, the mobile terminal UE that has received<br>
the detailed information of the emergency information displays<br>
the detailed information of the emergency information<br>
accompanied with a buzzer sound, a popup, and the like, on the<br>
basis of the way specified by a serial number and the like.<br>
[0073]<br>
In step S1007, the radio control apparatus RNC (or the radio<br>
base station) transmits a "Report-Success" to the core network<br>
apparatus CBC. In step S1008, the core network apparatus CBC<br>
transmits the "Report-Success" to the emergency information<br>
delivery apparatus CBE.<br>
[0074]<br>
Second, with reference to Fig. 4, description will be given<br>
of the operation of delivering emergency information (Earthquake<br>
Early Warning) using the MBMS system.<br>
[0075]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, in step S2001, an emergency information<br>
delivery apparatus delivers information required to deliver<br>
emergency information to a core network apparatus BM-SC<br>
(Broadcast Multicast Service Center). The information includes<br>
the "emergency-information delivery area", the "type of<br>
emergency information (for example, the kind of a disaster)",<br>
the "overview of emergency information", and the "terminal<br>
operation identifier".<br>
[0076]<br>
Here, if there is only an "Earthquake Early Warning", as<br>
the "type of emergency information", the core network apparatus<br>
BM-SC understands the "type of emergency information", and hence<br>
the deliver of the "type of emergency information" can be omitted.<br>
[0077]<br>
In addition, if the "overview of emergency information"<br>
is generated in the core network apparatus BM-SC, the deliver<br>
of the "overview of emergency information" can be omitted.<br>
[0078]<br>
In step S2002, based on the information received from the<br>
emergency information delivery apparatus, the core network<br>
apparatus BM-SC transmits the following in addition to a normal<br>
parameter for the MBMS, to a radio control apparatus RNC (or<br>
a radio base station) covering the "emergency-information<br>
delivery area" through a switching system GGSN (Gateway GPRS<br>
Support Node) /SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) . Specifically,<br>
transmitted are the "emergency information identifier", the<br>
"type of emergency information", the "overview of emergency<br>
information", the "detailed information of emergency<br>
information", the "terminal operation identifier", and the<br>
"emergency-information delivery area".<br>
[0079]<br>
Specifically, the core network apparatus BM-SC adds the<br>
following information elements to a parameter "Session Start<br>
Request (RAR(START))" defined in TS29.061(PDN), and transmits<br>
the information elements. Specifically, the information<br>
elements added are the "emergency information identifier", the<br>
"type of emergency information", the "overview of emergency<br>
information", the "detailed information of emergency<br>
information", the "terminal operation identifier", and the<br>
"emergency-information delivery area" (PDN/GTP/RANAP).<br>
[0080]<br>
In step S2003, the radio control apparatus RNC (or the radio<br>
base station) transmits a "Session Start Response" to the core<br>
network apparatus BM-SC through the switching system GGSN/SGSN.<br>
[0081]<br>
In step S2004, when the "emergency information identifier"<br>
is set for the parameter "Session Start Request (RAR(START))"<br>
that the radio control apparatus RNC (or the radio base station)<br>
has received from the core network apparatus BM-SC, the radio<br>
control apparatus RNC (or the radio base station) incorporates<br>
the "type of emergency information", the "overview of emergency<br>
information", and the "terminal operation identifier" in a MBMS<br>
paging signal (RRC), so as to notify to a mobile terminal UE<br>
that belongs to the "emergency-information delivery area."<br>
[0082]<br>
In step S2005, the mobile terminal UE that has received<br>
the MBMS paging signal makes simplified notification to a user<br>
of the occurrence of an earthquake and an overview of the<br>
earthquake, while linking the "type of emergency information<br>
(Earthquake Early Warning)" and the "overview of emergency<br>
information".<br>
[0083]<br>
In step S2006, after establishing a MBMS session with the<br>
mobile station UE, the core network apparatus BM-SC delivers<br>
the detailed information of the emergency information to the<br>
mobile station UE through the switching system GGSN/SGSN, as<br>
a broadcast communication message (an MBMS message).<br>
[0084]<br>
In step S2007, the mobile terminal UE that has received<br>
the detailed information of the emergency information displays<br>
the detailed information of the emergency information<br>
accompanied with a buzzer sound, a popup, and the like, on the<br>
basis of the way specified by a serial number and the like.<br>
[0085]<br>
(Advantageous Effects of Emergency Information Delivering<br>
System according to First Embodiment of Present Invention)<br>
The emergency information delivering system according to<br>
the first embodiment allows a broadcasting system using a<br>
conventional infrastructure (CBS or MBMS) to notify a mobile<br>
terminal of the overview of emergency information by a paging<br>
signal, before a broadcast communication message (the detailed<br>
information of the emergency information) is delivered.<br>
Thereby, the emergency information delivering system is capable<br>
of helping a user to take a first action quickly, and reducing<br>
an influence on human lives caused by an emergency situation<br>
such as a disaster.<br>
[0086]<br>
In addition, the emergency information delivering system<br>
according to this embodiment incorporates a terminal operation<br>
identifier in the paging signal, and thereby allows specification<br>
of the operation that the mobile terminal performs when receiving<br>
the overview of the emergency information.<br>
[0087]<br>
In future, if efforts for emergency information delivery<br>
are made across the world and thus the emergency information<br>
message identifier is defined internationally, there coexist<br>
a mobile terminal that is set to receive a message having an<br>
emergency information message identifier uniquely used by a<br>
telecommunication carrier and a mobile terminal that is set to<br>
receive a message having an emergency information message<br>
identifier commonly used across the world. Even in this case,<br>
according to the emergency information delivering system<br>
according to this embodiment, emergency information transmitted<br>
only once can reach both of the mobile terminals even by using<br>
the existing emergency information message identifier uniquely<br>
used by a telecommunication carrier. Thereby the emergency<br>
information message identifier can be smoothly shifted from the<br>
one unique to a telecommunication carrier to the one common across<br>
the world.<br>
[0088]<br>
Note that operations of the aforementioned mobile terminal,<br>
radio base station, and radio control apparatus may be performed<br>
by hardware, a software module executed by a processor, or a<br>
combination of the two.<br>
[0089]<br>
The software module may be provided in a storage medium<br>
of any form including a RAM (RandomAccess Memory), a flashmemory,<br>
a ROM (Read Only Memory) , an EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) ,<br>
an EEPROM (Electronically Erasable and Programmable ROM), a<br>
register, a hard disk, a removable disk, and a CD-ROM.<br>
[0090]<br>
The storage medium is connected to the processor so that<br>
the processor can read and write information from and onto the<br>
storage medium. The storage medium may be integrated with the<br>
processor. In addition, the storage medium and the processor<br>
may be provided in an ASIC. The ASIC may be provided in the<br>
mobile station UE and the radio base station eNB. Further, the<br>
storage medium and the processor may be provided in the mobile<br>
station UE and the radio base station eNB as a discrete component.<br>
[0091]<br>
The present invention has been described above in detail<br>
by using the above embodiment. However, it is apparent for those<br>
skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited<br>
to the embodiment described in this specification. The present<br>
invention can be implemented as amended or modified forms without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention,<br>
which is defined by the description of the scope of claims. The<br>
description of this specification has been given to illustrate<br>
the present invention, and therefore is not intended to limit<br>
the present invention.<br>
