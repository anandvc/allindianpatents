Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a wastewater treatment method, in particular, a biological<br>
process to remove contaminant of carbon and nitrogen from wastewater.<br>
Background<br>
Oxygen-consumption contaminants and nutritious substances present in the water, such as<br>
various organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). are the main pollutants causing<br>
deterioration of natural water quality. The most widely used method for organic carbon (COD<br>
or BOD) removal is the activated sludge process, i.e., secondary biological wastewater<br>
treatment process, which was invented between 1898 and 1914. The removal efficiency of<br>
organic carbon reaches 90-95%. In this biological treatment process, organic substances are<br>
oxidized and decomposed by heterotrophs. Part of the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur<br>
are assimilated to bacterial cells and are discharged in the form of excess sludge; the<br>
remaining organic carbon is oxidized to CO2 by dissimilation and then removed. The energy<br>
produced in the process is required by the growth and metabolism of the heterotrophs. The<br>
rest of the inorganic substances such as nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur are discharged along<br>
with the water in the form of NH3, NO2-, NO3-, PO43-, SO42- etc.<br>
Conventional biological methods aiming at removing organic carbon (COD) are insufficient<br>
for ammonia removal. The ratio of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the effluent of<br>
traditional secondary treatment process is approximately C (BOD): N : P=10:20:l. Therefore<br>
the process is able to remove 90% of BOD, but only about 20%-30% of nitrogen. The 70% -<br>
80% soluble nitrogen remained in wastewater is one of the causative factors of eutrophication.<br>
It has been commonly recognized that the threats of ammonia to the water ecosystem are just<br>
second to organic carbon. And even though large municipal wastewater treatment facilities<br>
have been constructed and operated to remove organic carbon, the contamination of ammonia<br>
still causes a problem.<br>
The biological method has already been proved to be effective for organic carbon removal,<br>
but how to remove nitrogen efficiently and economically in large scale still need to be<br>
investigated.<br><br>
Conventional wastewater treatment technologies for removing organic carbon and nitrogen<br>
arc based on the microbiological theory and technological principles that combine three<br>
processes: degradation of organic carbon and "ammonification" of organic nitrogen by<br>
heterotrophs. "nitrification" of ammonia and nitrite carried out by autotrophs, and<br>
"denitrification'* by anaerobic (facultative) heterotrophs. The three processes above can be<br>
demonstrated as follows:<br><br>
Some main features of the three steps are listed as follow:<br>
(1)	Ammonification is facilitated by the growth of heterotrophs of various genera in which<br>
organic nitrogen is converted to inorganic nitrogen, i.e. ammonia;<br>
(2)	Nitrification is facilitated by the growth of obligate aerobic autotrophs of various genera in<br>
which ammonia is oxidized to nitrite and nitrite is further oxidized to nitrate; Nitrosomonas<br>
and Nitrobacter are typical of these chemolithotrophic species that carry out the two oxidation<br>
processes, respectively.<br>
(3)	Denitrification is facilitated by the growth of heterotrophs of various genera in which<br>
nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas.<br>
Therefore, from the microbiological point, the mechanism of nitrogen and carbon removal<br>
follows a model as heterotrophic bacterial utilization -&gt; autotrophic bacterial utilization -&gt;<br>
heterotrophic bacterial utilization.<br><br>
From a nitrogen removal perspective, the conventional activated sludge system in which<br>
organic substances removal and ammonification take place in the same reactor, can be<br>
considered as a single-stage nitrification process. According to the above model, nitrification<br>
is facilitated by the growth of autotrophs, and denitrification is facilitated by the growth of<br>
heterotrophs. In this single-stage nitrification process, the growth rate and the oxygen and<br>
nutrient utilization rate of the heterotrophs involved in oxidizing organic carbon are greater<br>
than the nitrifying autotrophs, therefore the heterotrophs predominate over the autotrophs,<br>
which ultimately leads to low efficient nitrification.<br>
The phenomenon of low efficient nitrification is often observed in the secondary treatment<br>
process, which seemingly strengthens the fact that nitrifying bacteria is indeed autotrophic in<br>
nature. Researchers undoubtedly believe that organic substances inhibit the growth and<br>
physiological activity of autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria in the waste water treatment<br>
system aiming at the removal of C and N pollutants.<br>
Owing to this theory, two-stage and multistage activated sludge treatment processes are<br>
brought forth in order to eliminate the adverse effects of organic substances on nitrification by<br>
separating organic removal process and nitrification (and denitrification) in two (or three)<br>
separated reactors. However, the multistage activated sludge treatment processes have failed<br>
to achieve wide application due to its high investment and operation cost.<br>
It is therefore understandable that before the breakthrough of theory, engineers and designers<br>
have conceived of a range of improved single-stage activated sludge technologies to remove<br>
nitrogen. These processes combine the aerobic nitrification zone and the anoxic denitrification<br>
zone into a single system such as PHOREDOX (A/O), A2/O. UCT (or MUCT) and VIP etc.<br>
I Iowever. the operations of these systems are still complicated although they have improved<br>
carbon and nitrogen removal.<br>
Organic carbon and nitrogen removal efficiency is to the root constrained by the biological<br>
features of bacteria during nitrification. Since the operation of the wastewater treatment plants<br>
is under the guidance of metabolism theory of autotrophic nitrification, major drawbacks exit<br>
in the application of these conventional methods: (1) Slow cell growth rate, low sludge<br>
production and poor sludge settleability of nitrifying bacteria make it difficult to maintain a<br><br>
high biomass concentration of nitrifying bacteria; (2) Many activated sludge systems lack<br>
effective nitrification, especially during the winter when temperature drops below 15Â°C.<br>
which results in long hydraulic retention time (HRT) and low organic burden on the system:<br>
(3) Part of the effluent and sludge have to be returned to the tank to achieve higher biomass<br>
concentration and more effective nitrogen removal; (4) The addition of alkaline to maintain<br>
pH level leads to higher operation costs; (5) Conventional nitrification processes tend to have<br>
extreme results: either no ammonia oxidation at all or complete oxidation into nitrate;<br>
Conventional methods are often inadequate for nitrogen-enriched waters with nitrogen<br>
content exceeding 200 mg/1.<br>
In all, traditional nitrification-denitrification method is inadequate to prevent nitrogen<br>
pollution to the environment.<br>
However, extensive and intensive studies on biological N-removal have been carried out in<br>
many developed countries, and lead to the breakthrough in both theory and technology which<br>
leads to the invention of a range of innovative nitrogen removal techniques with SHARONÂ®<br>
as a representative, and has to some extent improved nitrogen removal efficiency and reduced<br>
operation costs in wastewater treatment.<br>
Take the SHARON" (Single Reactor High Activity Ammonia Removal Over Nitrite) which is<br>
also considered a short-cut nitrification and denitrification technique (European patent EP 0<br>
826 639 A1, Chinese patent application publication No. CN1310692A) as an example:<br>
Conventional nitrification methods completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate instead of nitrite<br>
(NH4+âNO2-âNO3-, termed as "complete nitrification") in order to both eliminate the<br>
oxygen consumption potential of nitrogen and prevent nitrite from inhibiting bacterial growth.<br>
However, the complete nitrification process is not necessary in nitrogen removal from<br>
wastewater, and the process of oxidizing ammonia to nitrite (NH4âNO2-) can achieve<br>
equally promising results. It is possible to eliminate the conversion of NO2- to NO3- during<br>
nitrification and NO3- to NO2- during denitrification in biological nitrogen removal. The<br>
process of controlling ammonia oxidation at the nitrite stage is called as the Short-cut<br>
Nitrification. In 1997 Delft University of Technology developed the Short-cut Nitrification<br><br>
and Denitrification which resolved the difficulties of treating sludge digester effluents which<br>
contain high ammonia concentration to some extent.<br>
The key in the SHARONÂ® technique is to optimize operational conditions in order to facilitate<br>
the growth of autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp), especially<br>
Nitrosomonas curoph. and to allow them to become dominant in the reactor. The conditions<br>
proposed by SHARONÂ® enable the growth rate of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria to compensate<br>
for the sludge loss in the CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor), whereas the growths of<br>
nitrite-oxidizing bacteria including Nitrobacteria are constrained and then washed out. Under<br>
these conditions, ammonia oxidation is controlled and restrained to the nitrite stage and nitrite<br>
acts as the electron acceptor in denitrification. Some main features of SHARONÂ® are that: (1)<br>
It is a shorter process with short-cut nitrification and denitrification being combined in one<br>
single reactor; (2) There is no retention of biomass in the reactor, therefore only a simple<br>
reactor is required; (3) It demands high operation temperature (30~40Â°C) to achieves effective<br>
treatment results; (4) Alkalinity can be adjusted by denitrification and pH is maintained<br>
between 7 and 8 without external alkaline addition.<br>
Compared with conventional nitrogen removal technologies, SHARONÂ® has the following<br>
advantages: lower investment and operation costs; easier start-up and operation; simpler<br>
maintenance; no production of chemical by-products. However. SHARONÂ® has drawbacks,<br>
because it is still based on the traditional autotrophic nitrification theory. From the operational<br>
perspective, organic carbon removal, nitrogen removal and sludge disposal remain highly<br>
disintegrated. The high processing temperature (35Â°C) places stringent requirements on<br>
reactors and is unable to treat large volume of wastewater with low ammonia concentration. It<br>
is difficult to be realized in traditional sequencing batch reactors (SBR). It still requires excess<br>
sludge discharge and relatively long hydraulic retention time (HRT) during denitrification<br>
compared with nitrification rate.<br>
Wastewater treatment technology mainly utilizes the variety of bacteria metabolism to<br>
decompose and remove pollutants. Current carbon and nitrogen removal methods, including<br>
new biological nitrogen removal techniques with SHARONÂ® as representative, are all based<br>
on the theory developed by Monod. The Monod theory (or cell growth theory) concerns the<br>
relationship between cell growth and organic carbon and nitrogen removal. Monod states that<br><br>
cell growth is associated simultaneously with the assimilation of organic carbon and nitrogen<br>
and the decomposition of excess substrate to fuel physiological behaviors. This theory has<br>
become the mainstream in microbiology and has guided a range of industrial applications,<br>
including organic carbon and nitrogen removal. In particular, it has exerted considerable<br>
influence in areas of reactor design, process design and operational management etc.<br>
According to Monod theory, in regard with the kinetics of substrate conversion, bacterial<br>
growth and substrate utilization rate exhibit the following relationship:<br><br>
Where: ds/dt is the substrate utilization rate; Y is the biomass yield coefficient (biomass<br>
produced per mass of substrate utilized); X is the biomass concentration. It can be concluded<br>
from the equation that bacterial growth is directly related to substrate utilization, and that by<br>
improving bacterial growth rate, substrate utilization can be enhanced.<br>
During inorganic NH4+ conversion in the traditional "heterotrophic-autotrophic-heterotrophic<br>
bacterial utilization" model, and according to Monod kinetics, bacterial growth rate or<br>
substrate utilization rate is extremely low. In theory, bacterial growth rate is 0.29 g/g<br>
(VSS/NH4+-N) and 0.084g/g(VSS/NO2--N )(McCarty pL. 1964) while experimental results<br>
are only 0.04-0.13g/g(VSS/NH4+-N)and 0.02-0.07 g/g(VSS/NO2--N ). The biomass yield<br>
coefficient and substrate utilization coefficient of nitrifying autotrophs are 1-2 orders of<br>
magnitude slower than heterotrophs which has become the main limiting factors of nitrogen<br>
removal efficiency.<br>
When the Monod theory is implemented in the batch reactor, substrate consumption and the<br>
accumulation of toxic substances often result in the deterioration of nutrient environment and<br>
other environmental conditions, such as extreme acidic or basic conditions, which in turn<br>
hinder cell growth or even lead to cell death. To eliminate these influences, industrial<br>
applications often adopt the "chemostat" in which fresh medium is continuously added to<br>
supplement nutrients and equal amount of culture liquid (biomass and toxic substances) is<br>
continuously discharged to reduce the accumulated biomass and toxic substances, and to<br>
sustain stable biomass growth and substrate removal.<br><br>
The principles mentioned above have served as guidance in main technologies of organic<br>
carbon and nitrogen removal from wastewater. These principles have determined the<br>
configuration of almost all reactors (mostly continuous stirred tank reactor and continuous<br>
flow operation), and most importantly, they have led to the inevitable process of sludge<br>
accumulation and discharge during organic carbon and nitrogen removal.<br>
Thus the need for the treatment and disposal of sludge is one of the most crucial problems to<br>
be solved of conventional biological wastewater treatment technologies.<br>
Due to the autotrophic nature acknowledged in the prior art, the presence of organic<br>
substances is deleterious to the growth and physiological behavior of nitrifying bacteria,<br>
therefore any attempt to optimize the biological processes involved in organic carbon and<br>
nitrogen removal cannot overcome the inherent limitations.<br>
The present inventor realized that the oxidation of NH4+ into NO2- was largely related to the<br>
physiological behavior of heterotrophs, and thus adopted a method abandoned by the<br>
autotrophic theory and successfully isolated different heterotrophs with various ammonia<br>
oxidation activities. Certain strains exhibited high NO2- accumulation properties under pure-<br>
culture conditions (Chinese Patent No. 03118598.3, "Methods for Separating and Identifying<br>
Heterotrophic Nitrifying Bacteria"). He further proposed a method to cultivate highly active<br>
nitrifying heterotrophs and applied them to nitrogen removal from water (Chinese Patent No.<br>
03118597.5, "Cultivation and Application of Nitrifying Heterotrophs"), and proposed two<br>
different methods to remove ammonia (Chinese Patent No. 03118599.1. "Combination of<br>
nitrogen-removing bacteria and their Application", and Chinese Patent No. 200410005158.4.<br>
"Biological Ammonia Removal Methods from Wastewater and Relative Microorganisms ").<br>
However, the research mentioned above was mainly carried out with pure culture as inoculum,<br>
especially in single batch test based on the Monod theory. Therefore ammonia oxidation and<br>
nitrogen removal was not significantly more effective compared with classical autotrophic<br>
ammonia oxidation and denitrification. Another problem was that the growth of highly active<br>
heterotrophs was restrained at temperatures under 15Â°C and thus ammonia oxidation activity<br><br>
was hard to exhibit. The technologies were unable to resolve the problems of nitrogen<br>
removal at low temperatures.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
This invention proposes a method using heterotrophs to realize organic carbon and nitrogen<br>
removal. It is hoped that, by abandoning the autotrophic metabolism principle regarding the<br>
nitrifying bacteria, this method would overcome many of the problems characterizing<br>
classical processes, such as low efficiency in ammonia removal, disposal of excess sludge,<br>
and high energy consumption.<br>
This invention is able to simultaneously remove organic carbon and nitrogen while no<br>
biomass accumulation occurs according to the physiological characteristics of "heterotrophic<br>
ammonia oxidizing bacteria'" (HAOB) and carbon and nitrogen metabolism principles, which<br>
differs from the conventional methods which deem organic matter as inhibitor to the nitrogen-<br>
removing microorganisms.<br>
This invention has consequently no sludge generated throughout the wastewater treatment<br>
process which eliminates the problems associated with sludge disposal in regard to traditional<br>
methods.<br>
This invention can achieve organic carbon and nitrogen removal in one single reactor, and the<br>
conventional secondary treatment system can be still utilized without requiring any new<br>
apparatuses.<br>
This invention has overcome the limitations of temperature: effective short-course<br>
nitrification and denitrification processes can be achieved at a temperature range of 6-40Â°C.<br>
Thus, there is no need to comply to the stringent requirements of the SHARONÂ® method<br>
which demands for a relatively short-course nitrification process, operated at temperatures<br>
between 30Â°C and 40Â°C.<br>
This invention proposes a method which can control short-cut nitrification and denitrification<br>
in both aerobic and anoxic conditions by controlling carbon source addition.<br><br>
This invention provides a method for removing contaminant of carbon and nitrogen from<br>
wastewater by using the HAOB, comprising the following steps:<br>
(A)	Cultivation of HAOB activated sludge: seeding natural soils containing HAOB into<br>
substrates containing organic carbon and nitrogen and/or inorganic ammonia nitrogen, and<br>
aerating in a reactor while keeping pH within the range from 6.5 to 8.5, wherein if the<br>
substrate contains ammonia nitrogen, organic carbon source is supplied in batches;<br>
stopping aeration when ammonia nitrogen concentration falls below 3mg/L and NO2--N<br>
accumulation reaches maximum amount, maintaining an anoxic environment, and adding<br>
organic carbon source to allow denitrification to take place until the total of NO2--N and<br>
NO3--T-N concentrations are less than 1 mg/L; and<br>
(B)	Removal of carbon and nitrogen from wastewater: seeding the activated sludge produced<br>
from step (A) into a biological treatment reactor containing wastewater comprising organic<br>
carbon and nitrogen and/or inorganic ammonia nitrogen, and aerating to allow the ammonia<br>
oxidation to take place, wherein if the wastewater does not contain organic carbon,<br>
additional organic carbon source is added into the reactor; and stopping aeration when<br>
nitrite has accumulated, maintaining an anoxic condition, and adding organic carbon source<br>
to allow denitrification to take place until no nitrite is present.<br>
The HAOB mentioned above covers a range of microorganisms that are capable of carrying<br>
out the processes of ammonification, ammonia oxidation, and denitrification (reduction of<br>
nitrite and nitrate). Some main features of these bacteria include: ability to grow on PM plate<br>
and score positive when Griess-Ilosvay reagent is directly applied; ability to directly oxidize<br>
ammonia to N2, NO2-, NO3- under aerobic conditions; ability to remove nitrogen through<br>
denitrification with NO2- and NO3- as electron receptors and BOD as electron donor under<br>
aerobic and anoxic conditions.<br>
The key concept of this invention is that the bacteria involved in ammonia oxidation are<br>
heterotrophic rather than autotrophic. Based on this breakthrough of knowledge, the bacteria<br>
are cultivated and utilized using heterotrophic method. Based on this new understanding of<br><br>
the nature and metabolism of ammonia oxidizing bacteria, the method abandons the classical<br>
autotrophic theory of nitrifying bacteria and proposes the concept of HAOB.<br>
The classical understanding of the autotrophs involved in ammonia and nitrite oxidation<br>
during nitrification originated from the observation made by Winogradsky in 1890 of a<br>
specific type of autotrophic bacteria. The bacteria possess the following features: (1)<br>
Obtaining energy solely from the oxidation of NH4+ and NO2- ; (2) Using CO2 as the only<br>
carbon source in assimilation; (3) Organic substances is deleterious to their growth therefore<br>
they are unable to grow on the classical nutrient agar plates.<br>
Despite the autotrophic theory is often unable to explain many contradicting phenomenon, it<br>
is still the mainstream theory due to the fact that before this patent, highly active heterotrophic<br>
bacteria that oxidize ammonia to nitrite had not been found.<br>
On the other hand, researchers constrained by the autotrophic theory often neglect the<br>
diversity of nitrogen oxidation products, and presume that NO2- and NO3- are the only<br>
metabolites. In fact, during the metabolism of these functional microbes, not only<br>
ammonification (decomposition of organic nitrogen into NII3) but also NO2- and NO3-<br>
accumulation or N2 release are found under different conditions. These heterotrophs exist in a<br>
wide range, and are classified in Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology with their<br>
properties described.<br>
Table 1 describes the experimental results revealing the features of nitrogen metabolism of<br>
these bacteria.<br><br><br><br>
 means heterotrophic growth and ability to carry out ammonification and ammonia oxidation<br>
to nitrite;<br>
- means activity of ammonia oxidation to nitrite, i.e. accumulated NO2--N concentration<br>
(mg/L);<br>
+ is equivalent to 0.5mg/L; ++ is equivalent to 1.0-2.5 mg/L; +++ is equivalent to 2.5-5.0<br>
mg/L: ++++ is equivalent to 5.0-10.0 mg/L.<br>
(2) means pathway of nitrogen removal ( NH3 + O2 â N2)<br>
(3) means short nitrification (NH3+O2â NO2-) in a single stage batch test in a shaking reactor<br>
with the addition of carbon source (Pyruvate for example)<br>
(4) means nitrite oxidation to nitrate (NO2-+O2â NO3-)<br>
(5) means aerobic or anoxic denitrification with NO2- or NO3- as electron acceptor and organic<br>
carbon as electron donor (NO2-+CODâN2â+CO2â).<br><br>
As shown in Table 1, the bacteria share the following common features: able to grow on PM<br>
plate and score positive when Griess-Ilosvay reagent is directly applied; able to directly<br>
oxidize ammonia to N2, NO2- and NO3- under aerobic conditions; able to remove nitrogen<br>
through denitrification with NO2- and NO3- as electron receptors and organic carbon as<br>
electron donor under aerobic or anoxic conditions. However, these heterotrophs are different<br>
in their activities. A limited number of bacteria exhibit very high ammonia-to-nitrite oxidation<br>
activity, e.g. Bacillus pseudofirmus NH-2 and Arthrobacter globiformis WR-2, with the<br>
former one also exhibiting high nitrite-to-nitrate oxidation activity. This discovery shows that<br>
nitrification isn't a process carried out by two different groups of autotrophs consecutively<br>
with one group oxidizing ammonia to nitrite and another group from nitrite to nitrate.<br>
Therefore, the oxidation of trivalent negative nitrogen to various forms of nitrogen oxides by<br>
heterotrophs is distinctly different from the concept of autotrophic ammonia oxidation. These<br>
bacteria capable of ammonification, ammonia oxidation and denitrifieation of nitrite or nitrate<br>
are termed collectively as "Heterotrophic Ammonia. Oxidation Bacteria (HAOB)". It should<br>
be noted that these bacteria are not named according to taxonomy. They are a group of<br>
microorganisms capable of carrying out coupled energy generation through continuous<br>
combined oxidation-reduction of carbon and nitrogen.<br>
Based on the concept of HAOB, a carbon and nitrogen combined heterotrophic oxidation<br>
model is configured to describe the energy coupling and electron transfer process. "NAD acts<br>
as the electron carrier for both combined oxidation and electron transfer. Thermodynamic<br>
calculation is applied to each step.<br>
The electron transfer process in Krebs cycle, and the combined oxidation of carbon and<br>
nitrogen are illustrated in Figure 4.<br>
Thermodynamic data for ammonia conversion are presented in Table 2.<br><br><br>
According to the electron transfer model and relevant calculations of standard free energy<br>
changes, it may be deduced that during ammonia oxidation process in which ammonia is<br><br>
dehydrogenated and electrons are transferred to reduce NAD+ to NADU with energy being<br>
stored, only the step NH4++NAD-âN2+NADH is likely to be carried out spontaneously<br>

spontaneous (âG0 &gt;0). In other words, autotrophic are incapable of producing the NADH<br>
needed for assimilation through nitrification. Furthermore, the Calvin Cycle which produces<br>
energy through oxidizing NADH. and carries out the assimilation of CO2 to form cell<br>
component is dependent on large consumption of energy (solar energy, ATP etc.).<br>
When we take into account the second law of thermodynamics and that energy can only be<br>
transferred from high energy units to low energy units without assistance, we realize that<br>
nitrification autotrophic which utilize CO2 as single carbon source and generate energy solely<br>
from ammonia oxidation are in fact non-existent.<br>
It is generally acknowledged that free energy changes under constant temperature and<br>
pressure arc indicators of maximum net useful work generated from reactions. In biological<br>
systems, net useful work is utilized in biosynthesis for cell growth and in cell movement as<br>
mechanical force, or utilized to maintain certain physiological features, such as cell osmotic<br>
pressure produced by the difference in Na+ and K+ concentrations between the inside and<br>
outside of cells, or utilized to produce osmotic work by proton motive force due to proton<br>
gradient<br>
The work for biosynthesis, taken for instance, is the main work to reduce the free energy of<br>
the reactions during cell growth. The biological system utilizes this energy coupling<br>
mechanism to produce maximum useful work to sustain growth and other physiological<br>
activities.<br>
In fact, the coupling between energy-producing metabolism and energy-consuming reactions<br>
is not necessarily hard to occur. It is recognized that only when the two reactions have a<br>
common reactant or product can they be coupled.<br>
According to the principles mentioned above and the combined carbon and nitrogen oxidation<br>
theory model, two traditionally seemingly unrelated processes - organic carbon oxidation and<br>
ammonia oxidation - are connected by the present inventor. In the combined processes.<br><br>
energy is coupled by the participation of electron carrier NAD+, which acts as the product or<br>
the reactant in the carbon oxidation (through Kreb cycle) and ammonia oxidation. This<br>
indicates that the microorganisms involved in these processes are heterotrophic.<br>
From analysis of the above theory, we can reveal the principle of the carbon-source regulated<br>
heterotrophic ammonia oxidation process and product composition.<br>
1. Calculation of maximum net work in the aerobic ammonia oxidation<br>
According to the electron transport model and related thermodynamic calculations, if the loss<br>
of gaseous intermediates such as N2O, NO and NO2 are neglected, and N2-, NO2- and NO3- are<br>
regarded as the only final products of ammonia oxidation, in which N2 is considered as the<br>
inevitable product, we can simplify the process according to the law of conservation of matter<br>
and the law of conservation of energy:<br><br>
Where a. b. c. d. e are the amount of substance for original reactant, intermediate and final<br>
product during ammonia oxidation, respectively. According to the law of conservation of<br>
matter, we can deduce the following relationship:<br><br>
where âG0N1 , âG0N2, . âG0N3, and âG0N4 refer to the standard free energy change during each<br>
corresponding step in the process mentioned above wherein<br><br>
Thus, the total free energy change of oxidizing ammonia to intermediate NH2OH and final<br>
products N2. NO2- and NO3- can be represented by <br><br><br>
NH2OH is proved to be an inevitable intermediate of ammonia oxidation by experiments in<br>
biological oxidation and chemical oxidation as well. Due to the fact that oxidation of<br>
ammonia to NH2OH is an endothermic reaction, oxidation of certain other substance is<br>
required to provide energy and allow the reaction to proceed to the further oxidation of<br>
NH2OH.<br>
When some organic carbon participates in the ammonia oxidation process, the net work<br>
  by heterotrophs through ammonia oxidation process, i.e. a process with the<br>
combination of carbon and nitrogen oxidation, can be expressed as<br><br>
where is the energy required to initiate ammonia oxidation in the presence of organic<br>
carbon. âG0N1 is the energy required for ammonia oxidation.<br><br>
Therefore, the equation can be further expressed as<br><br>
where n refers to the amount of substance of organic carbon or energy-producing matters<br>
involved in ammonia oxidation.<br>
When that is to say the energy generated form oxidizing organic-<br>
carbon is sufficient to oxidize ammonia into NH2OH, we get:<br><br>
Therefore, the maximum net work of combined carbon and nitrogen oxidation âG0max can be<br>
described by<br><br><br>
Obviously âG0max is related to the dominating HAOB, described in this invention, in the<br>
activated sludge.<br>
2. Regulation of HAOB-related ammonia oxidation and corresponding product composition<br>
by carbon control<br>
A) Under the circumstance that the dominating bacteria in the activated sludge arc HAOB<br>
which arc able to oxidize ammonia into NO3- or N2, such as species of the Bacillus<br>
pscudofirmus.<br>
1)	If the dominating HAOB in the activated sludge are those that oxidize ammonia completely<br>
to NO3- or N2 (e.g. Bacillus pseudofirmus),<br><br>
Let the energy required for producing NO3- and N2 in the two parallel reactions in ammonia<br>
oxidation equal,<br><br>
Then maximum net work âG0max can be calculated as -239KJ during combined carbon and<br>
nitrogen oxidation. Ammonia oxidation products, NO3--N and N2, are 0.36mol and 0.32 mol.<br>
respectively.<br>
2)	If the dominating HAOB oxidize ammonia completely to N2 and NO2-, and no<br>
accumulation of NO3" occurs,<br><br><br>
The results indicate that when energy produced from carbon oxidation exceeds +43.4KJ.<br>
ammonia oxidation can be controlled at the short-cut nitrification stage at which no NO3-<br>
accumulates.<br>
3) If the dominating HAOB oxidize ammonia completely to mere N2, and no NO2- or NO3- is<br>
produced.<br><br>
In other words, when energy produced from carbon oxidation exceeds +71KJ. ammonia is<br>
exclusively oxidized into N2.<br>
B) Under the circumstance that the dominating HAOB are highly active nitrite-forming<br>
bacteria that oxidize ammonia to nitrite (hereinafter referred to as nitrite-forming<br>
heterotrophs). such as the Bacillus circulans, then according to the principles mentioned<br>
above, we can calculate the maximum net work and the ratio between the two oxidation<br>
productsâNO2- and N2-- during the combined carbon and nitrogen oxidation. Also, for 1<br>
mole of ammonia oxidized,<br><br>
4) - 0 KJ, all the processes mentioned above during ammonia oxidation are<br>
unable to take place.<br>
The organic carbon sources required in ammonia oxidation can be supplied by a range of<br>
sewage water or external carbon sources. By dosing organic substances during the aerobic<br>
stage, we are able to control the ratio of different ammonia oxidation products. This is of<br>
particular significance to the denitrification of sewage rich in inorganic ammonia but poor in<br>
BOD. i.e. low C/N ratio. Preferably, the present invention aims to limit the ammonia<br><br>
oxidation process to the stage of "short-cut nitrification" at which NO2--N concentration<br>
exceeds that of N2.<br>
It is necessary to emphasize that the principles and control techniques described in this<br>
invention are distinctly different from what has been called "simultaneous nitrification-<br>
denitrification" (SND) in wastewater treatment technology in recent ten years. In this<br>
invention. N2 is the inevitable or direct product of ammonia oxidation by IIOAB in aerobic<br>
conditions in the presence of organic substances, not the indirect product of.denitrification<br>
with NO2- or NO3- as electron receptor.<br>
3. Calculations of carbon source requirement for ammonia oxidation by HAOB<br>
Since <br>
where Wc. Mc refer to the mass and molar mass of a certain organic carbon source involved in<br>
ammonia oxidation, respectively,<br><br>
According to the equations above, we can obtain the amount of organic carbon source needed<br>
by HAOB to produce different ammonia oxidation products and achieve certain products ratio.<br>
For example, if we add pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH) or anhydrous sodium acetate<br>
(hereinafter referred to as sodium acetate or NaAc) to wastewater rich in inorganic ammonia<br>
and devoid of BOD. we can obtain the following results:<br><br><br>
âG0 is calculated according to the half reactions in which CH3COCOOH and NaAc are<br>
completely oxidized into CO2.<br><br>
Willi this energy value produced in carbon oxidation, we can deduce the corresponding COD<br>
or BOD value, or calculate the amount of substance of a certain organic carbon source.<br>
The HAOB mentioned above and their metabolism mechanism will lead to technological<br>
breakthrough for carbon and nitrogen removal from wastewater if applied to industry.<br>
The invention describes the following procedures:<br>
A) Cultivation of HAOB activated sludge<br>
Natural soils are seeded into substrates containing organic carbon and organic nitrogen and/or<br>
ammonia. Aeration and non-aeration are applied. Different from the autotrophic nitrification<br>
theory, the method of this invention uses heterotrophic bacterial culture and organic carbon<br>
sources such as organic acid or their corresponding salts including, but not limited to.<br>
anhydrous acetic acid, sodium acetate, pyruvic acid or their mixtures. The external organic<br>
carbon source is requisite for the metabolism of HAOB, especially highly active nitrite-<br>
forming heterotrophs that oxidize ammonia to nitrite.<br>
During aeration stage, bacteria grow and carry out ammonia oxidation and produce NO2-;<br>
during anoxic stage when aeration is ceased, denitrification starts which results in the<br>
disappearance of NO2- from the culture, and sludge up-flow caused by the production of large<br>
quantities of bubbles.<br>
pH increases as organic nitrogen substrate is ammonified and proteins are decomposed during<br>
HAOB cultivation. But as ammonia oxidation subsequently takes place, which generates NO2-,<br>
pH gradually decreases. Therefore, to stabilize pH in the reactor to promote bacteria growth,<br>
organic acid and other organic carbon source may be added at different intervals according to<br><br>
pH variation. During the growth of the activated sludge, ammonia concentration decreases<br>
gradually and NCV-N accumulates as aeration continues. Under aerobic conditions, organic<br>
carbon source will initiate aerobic denitrification, causing the transient disappearance of NO2-<br>
-N which later re-accumulates to a higher concentration. This process is repeated with each<br>
supplement of organic carbon until ammonia oxidation almost disappears and NO2--N<br>
accumulation reaches maximum amount. This indicates that HAOB has reached maximum<br>
quantity with their activity fully expressed, and becomes dominant in the sludge.<br>
The procedures mentioned above are able to fully exploit the activity of HAOB and enable<br>
highly active nitrite-forming heterotrophs such as Bacillus pseudofirmus NH-2 and<br>
Arthrobacter globiformis to be dominant in the activated sludge. This can be proved by using<br>
the methods described in the Chinese Patent 03118598.3. The method provides ways to<br>
identify, separate and count HAOB. It can also be reflected by the accumulation of NOi'-N<br>
per unit volume per unit time (mg/L/min).<br>
Since the growth and ammonia oxidation activity of HAOB (with NO2- production as<br>
indicator) are specifically regulated by the energy metabolism of the combined carbon and<br>
nitrogen oxidation. HAOB are capable of removing ammonia or accumulating NO2--N in both<br>
cell growth and non-cell-growth periods, depending on the type and amount of carbon source<br>
applied. Certain details of the cultivation process with NO2--N accumulation as an indicator<br>
should be adjusted according to the specific dominating HAOB species in the sludge to<br>
eliminate the impact of dramatic pH fluctuation caused by the difference in carbon and<br>
nitrogen utilization during cultivation.<br>
Thus, the aeration (or ammonia oxidation) and non-aeration (denitrification) can be controlled<br>
according to the principles shown below.<br>
The present invention is widely applicable under different conditions and different sludge<br>
concentrations and sludge sources, and it is possible to exert control by regulating pH or<br>
accumulated NO2--N concentration during aeration. The general principle is that during the<br>
aerobic stage, pH should be controlled in the range of 6.5-8.5. The reason is that when<br>
pHâ¤6.5, ammonia-to-nitrite oxidation rate significantly decreases which is disadvantageous to<br>
total nitrogen removal. On the other hand, the presence of high HNO2 concentration will<br><br>
inhibit the growth of other bacteria, in particular, filamentous bacteria, which will prevent<br>
sludge bulking and ensure that highly active dominant HAOB species exist in the system. pH<br>
may also rise due to the alkalinity produced from denitrification. When pH exceeds 9. bacteria<br>
are susceptible to death and thus pH should be held in the range of 6.5-8.5. pH can be<br>
controlled by means of adding organic carbon source, or acid or alkali. When ammonia<br>
nitrogen â¤3mg/L and NO2--N accumulation reaches maximum amount, aeration is ceased to<br>
maintain an anoxic environment, and then with the addition of carbon source, denitrification<br>
takes place. Ammonia refers to NH3 and NH4+ in total. The use of pH and HNO2 as indicators<br>
may facilitate the intelligent control of aeration and non-aeration.<br>
During cultivation of HAOB activated sludge, temperature is held in the ambient temperature<br>
range, for example, 20~40Â°C. In case of continuous culture at temperatures below 15Â°C.<br>
sludge growth and ammonia concentration decrease are slow, and no accumulations of NO2--<br>
N and NO3--N are observed, indicating that cells experience slow growth at low temperatures<br>
according to the Monod theory. However, one of the significant features of the invention is<br>
that we can cultivate HAOB under ambient temperatures and use them at low temperatures.<br>
This feature stems from the principle of carbon and nitrogen removal under non-cell-growth,<br>
which is to be described below.<br>
After cultivation, the HAOB activated sludge produced from step A) are seeded into a<br>
bioreactor (i.e., the biological treatment reactor as mentioned above) containing wastewater<br>
with organic carbon and organic nitrogen and/or ammonia. The mixture is aerated and. if no<br>
organic carbon is present, organic carbon source may be added into the water to allow<br>
ammonia oxidation to proceed. Once NO2--N begins to accumulate, aeration is stopped to<br>
maintain an anoxic environment, and then organic carbon source is added to initiate<br>
denitrification. Denitrification is continued until no nitrite is present.<br>
In step B), the removal of carbon and nitrogen is achieved through aerobic and anoxic<br>
processes or. through aeration and non-aeration control. Aerobic process carries out COD<br>
removal, and ammonia oxidationâ a process similar to what called nitrification in current<br>
technologies except that the aerobic process is carried out by HAOB with N2 and NO2- as<br>
products. On the other hand, the anoxic process is similar to present denitrification technology,<br>
in which organic carbon is added when NO2--N accumulate to some extent, and anoxic<br><br>
conditions are maintained until no NO2--N is present. However, the difference between this<br>
invention and present technologies is that carbon and nitrogen removal is achieved by<br>
heterotrophs.<br>
The present invention is applicable to a wide range of nitrogen-containing wastewaters, for<br>
example, municipal sewage with TKN (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen) ranging between 20 and 80<br>
mg/L. high concentration organic wastewaters (TKN: 400-500 mg/L) such as coking<br>
wastewater, or industrial wastewaters (TKN: 1000~2000mg/L) such as wastewater from<br>
fertilizer and monosodium glutamate factories. In step B), NCV-N accumulation can be held<br>
at the level of 0.5-125mg/L during ammonia oxidation. Once the desired level reached,<br>
anoxic denitrification is allowed to occur. According to step B), different levels of nitrogen<br>
may require repeated ammonia oxidation and denitrification to remove carbon and nitrogen<br>
and to achieve the desired concentration, such as ammonia concentration less than 3mg/L.<br>
Non-cell-growth based biological technology for carbon and nitrogen removal is developed in<br>
this invention to overcome the defects of conventional biological treatment methods, and the<br>
limitations of denitrification caused by the low growth rate and substrate conversion<br>
efficiency of ammonia oxidizing bacteria.<br>
As already mentioned above, current wastewater treatment is mainly based on the Monod<br>
theory which relates bacterial growth to substrate removal. According to the theory, large<br>
quantities of sludge need to be discharged, and low temperatures will lead to slow cell growth<br>
rate and ineffective assimilation of ammonia and, consequently low accumulation of ammonia<br>
oxidation product NCV-N even for HOAB.<br>
It is generally recognized that the principles underlying carbon and nitrogen removal from<br>
wastewater are the theories from thermodynamic and enzyme kinetics, in other words, the<br>
principles of enzyme-promoting biochemical reactions under cell growth. The principles upon<br>
which this invention is based do not contradict with the classical enzyme-promoting theories,<br>
synthesis and expression of enzymes have already been fully achieved when growth of<br>
ammonia oxidizing bacteria reaches maximum. Consequently, carbon and nitrogen removal is<br>
irrelevant to bacterial growth and only related to enzyme activity and enzyme quantity. The<br>
ammonia oxidation activity of HAOB activated sludge cultivated from step A) has already<br><br>
been fully expressed and can therefore be utilized at different temperatures to achieve<br>
microorganism function. Furthermore, according to the enzyme-promoted non-cell-growth<br>
principle. HAOB activated sludge can be retained inside the reactor without constant<br>
discharge of sludge or bacteria cells which is required for conventional method according to<br>
the cell-growth principle.<br>
Therefore, some concepts in this invention are different from classical concepts traditionally<br>
applied in conventional activated sludge system. For example, sludge age (sludge retention<br>
time. SRT) is traditionally defined as the ratio between total amount of sludge in the reactor<br>
and sludge discharged per unit time. In other words, it is the ratio between the amount of<br>
sludge contained in the activated sludge system (Mx) and sludge production (Fsp, the amount<br>
of sludge discharged per unit time), SRT=Mx/FSp. However, throughout the process of the<br>
present method, no sludge is discharged, Fsp=0, SRTâoo, therefore, SRT&gt;&gt;HRT. which<br>
further reflects that the enzyme theory involved in carbon and nitrogen removal in this<br>
invention is distinctly indifferent from classical growth theory. Therefore, the present<br>
invention solves the problems occurred in the conventional wastewater treatment process that<br>
a large quantity of sludge has to be discharged, and then treated.<br>
According to the principles of carbon and nitrogen removal under non-cell:growth conditions,<br>
the HAOB activated sludge cultivated from step A) are able to function at temperatures lower<br>
than ambient temperature. In other words, the technique is characterized by ambient-<br>
temperature cultivation and low-temperature utilization and, as mentioned in Step B). it is<br>
able to achieve effective ammonia oxidation and denitrification when operated at the<br>
temperature of 6~40Â°C.<br>
In addition, the invention has significantly improved ammonia oxidation efficiency through<br>
the increase of sludge concentration and improvement of oxygen mass transfer efficiency,<br>
which again reflects the non-cell-growth theory during carbon and nitrogen removal.<br>
The sludge concentration and aeration conditions of step B) can be determined according to<br>
conventional technologies. The increase of activated sludge can greatly increase wastewater<br>
treatment efficiency, and significantly decrease hydraulic retention time (HRT), aeration time<br><br>
and non-aeration time. Correspondingly, the enhancement of aeration can upgrade treatment<br>
ability and reduce HRT. aeration time and non-aeration time.<br>
Step B) can be generally applied in various kinds of existing biological reactors, for example,<br>
suspended activated sludge reactors, biofilm reactors, sequencing batch reactors (SBR), or<br>
continuous flow reactors, or their combinations.<br>
The utilization of HAOB activated sludge to remove carbon and nitrogen can be achieved in<br>
the traditional two-stage biological treatment system, which eliminates the need for<br>
constructing new reactors. The biological features of HAOB enable carbon and nitrogen<br>
removal from wastewater to be achieved in a single SBR. or in a continuous stirred tank<br>
reactor (CSTR). The process can be easily realized by the control of aeration to create aerobic<br>
and anoxic conditions. This greatly reduces the number of reactors, simplifies operation<br>
process and avoids many difficulties involved in complicated reactor set-up which<br>
characterizes conventional methods.<br>
The technological process of carbon and nitrogen removal in a single SBR is shown in Figure<br>
1. Activated sludge containing HAOB is seeded into wastewater containing COD and NH3-<br>
Then, aeration and non-aeration initiate aerobic phase (phase 1) and anoxic phase (phase II)<br>
subsequently in the same SBR at temperature between 6-40Â°C (Figure 1). Phase I involves<br>
COD removal and ammonia oxidation of nitrogen in aerobic conditions by heterotrophs, and<br>
consequently results in N2 release or NO2--N accumulation. Once NO2--N reaches a certain<br>
level, aeration is stopped to create an anoxic condition, i.e. the phase II, wherein organic<br>
carbon source is added to perform denitrification until NO2--N disappears. The loop from<br>
phase I to phase II can be repeated several times until carbon and nitrogen contaminants are<br>
generally removed and reaches a certain standard, for example, ammonia less than 3mg/L.<br>
A settling tank is unnecessary in the process as phase I and phase II don't require sludge<br>
separation. In addition, sludge floatation caused by N2 release during denitrification in the<br>
anoxic phase can be readily utilized to achieve spontaneous sludge separation. Effluent (i.e..<br>
the treated wastewater) can be discharged from the lower part of the reactor by gravity which<br>
reduces unnecessary power consumption and avoids the need of a settling tank or sludge<br>
recycling process.<br><br>
From the previous discussion about the regulation of HAOB-related ammonia oxidation and<br>
corresponding products composition by carbon control, it can be seen that it is therefore<br>
possible in step B) to control the ammonia oxidation products composition by controlling<br>
organic carbon source addition into the biological reactors under aerobic conditions. The<br>
organic carbon source in a biological reactor includes organic carbon from wastewater (COD<br>
or BOD) and external organic carbon source when needed. Therefore, ammonia oxidation<br>
products can be regulated at different levels by changing the amount and types of external<br>
organic carbon and oxygen supply. Appropriate carbon control and oxygen supply not only<br>
enable simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal under aerobic conditions, but also are able<br>
to optimize the process at the most advantageous level.<br>
Consequently, step B) preferably limits the reaction at the short-cut nitrification stage.<br>
Ammonifications into N2 and NO2- coexist in the presence of a certain organic substance.<br>
NOi'-N accumulation predominates over N2 production and the reaction can be controlled at<br>
the short-cut nitrification stage wherein NO2--N accumulates without NO3--N produced. This<br>
process is facilitated by highly active HAOB, such as Bacillus pseudofirmus NH-2 and<br>
Arthrobacter globiformis WR-2 as mentioned in this invention.<br>
Because of the existence of COD, part of the ammonia can be oxidized to N2 such that oxygen<br>
supply and energy consumption can be reduced. Alkalinity regenerated from denitrification<br>
neautralizes acid produced from ammonia oxidation, which significantly cuts down alkalinity-<br>
requirementâthis is similar to what has been described in SHARONÂ®.<br>
Different from what has been described in the autotrophic growth theory underpinning<br>
common ammonia removal methods, fully cultivated heterotrophs are active at various<br>
temperatures. They can carry out ammonia oxidation process steadily at the NO2- stage, and<br>
thus overcome the complexities involved in pH control, DO control, temperature control and<br>
free ammonia control. In particular, it solves the problems associated with high operation<br>
temperature, such as high energy consumption in the winter and ineffective ammonia removal<br>
for high-concentrated wastewater, which is characteristic of the SHARONÂ® technique. The<br>
invention can remove high carbon and nitrogen from various wastewaters effectively.<br><br>
In all. compared with traditional technologies and the SHARONÂ® Technique, the method<br>
according to the present invention possesses some obvious advantages as follows:<br>
1)	According to the physiological characters of HAOB and its carbon and nitrogen<br>
catabolism features, the method is able to remove carbon and nitrogen simultaneously<br>
under non-cell-growth condition.<br>
2)	No sludge discharge is required throughout the wastewater treatment process, which<br>
eliminates difficulties associated with sludge disposal in traditional activated sludge<br>
technologies.<br>
1) The activated sludge according to the present invention is able to achieve carbon and<br>
nitrogen removal in a conventional activated sludge system without constructing new<br>
reactors, and thus the construction costs can be greatly reduced. The purpose of this<br>
invention can be fulfilled in a single biological reactor, and therefore the activated sludge<br>
can be applied in a variety of already existing biological treatment reactors.<br>
4)	The method has overcome the limitations of temperature: effective short-cut nitrification<br>
and denitrification can be achieved in the temperature range of 6-40Â°C, while in<br>
SHARONÂ® process stringent conditions of 30-40Â°C are required to achieve short-cut<br>
nitrification.<br>
5)	Short-cut nitrification and denitrification can be achieved in both aerobic and anoxic<br>
conditions through the control of carbon source.<br>
6)	Compared with SHARONÂ® process, the invention has high short-cut denitrification rate.<br>
It has also overcome a problem characterizing conventional denitrification techniques: the<br>
denitrification is inhibited once NO2--N exceeds 30mg/L.<br>
7)	The invention can greatly reduce oxygen demand and organic source for denitrification.<br>
8)	The activated sludge can be easily cultivated in large quantities due to short start-up time,<br>
flexible operation and simple control.<br><br>
9) Sludge bulking does not occur, and sludge can be separated without requiring any sludge<br>
settling tank.<br>

nitrite in every liter of solution and 0.18 mg N/L of nitrate would represent 0.18 mg nitrate in<br>
every liter of solution.<br>
If the experiment conditions and methods were not specifically described in the experiments<br>
below, it was understood that they were carried out under conventional conditions and<br>
methods. For example, methods described in "Experimental Methods for Soil<br>
Microorganism" (Compiled by the Research Center for Soil Microorganism [JapanJ.<br>
translated by Ye Weiqing etc. Science Press, 1983); "Manual for Research Methods of Soil<br>
Microorganism" (Xu Guanghui, Beijing Agricultural Press, 1986); "Research Methods for Soil<br>
Microorganism " (Compiled by the Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences,<br><br>
Science Press. 1985); and "Research Methods for Water Quality" (Compiled by the Japanese<br>
Industrial Water Usage Association, translated by Chen lv-an, Chinese Environmental Science<br>
Press. 1990) etc. Certain methods and conditions were determined according to the<br>
suggestions of manufacturers.<br>
Example 1<br>
This example used Wushantu as seed in the sludge cultivation process.<br>
The composition of the organic pre-culture medium used for HAOB cultivation was listed<br>
below:<br><br>
The culture substrate was prepared by dissolving the organic pre-culture medium with tap<br>
water and heating, and then diluted to 2500ml; pH was adjusted to the range of 7.0-7.2:<br>
CODcr=1.99x 103mg/L, TKN=TN=424 mg/L; organic N: inorganic N= 1:1.<br>
5g dry Wushantu was seeded into the above 2500ml culture substrate (TKN=424mg/L).<br>
Continues aeration was carried out at 28Â°C for 2 days until NO2--N reached 0.5~1.0mg/L.<br>
Acetic acid (HAc) or sodium acetate (NaAc) as carbon source was added into the solution<br>
twice every day (every 12 hours). The carbon source amount each time was 0.28ml anhydrous<br>
HAc per liter solution or 0.40g anhydrous NaAc per liter solution, corresponding to an<br>
equivalent COD concentration of 316mg/L. According to pH variation. HAc or NaAc was<br>
added alternatively to maintain the pH between 6.5 and 8.5.<br>
NO2--N was observed to accumulate (â¥5mg/L) after the 12th addition of carbon source under<br>
aeration conditions. Carbon addition was carried out in a total of 18 times or 9 days. On the<br>
ninth day. 12 hours after the second addition of carbon source, NO2--N accumulation reached<br>
75 mg/L or even higher. Up till then, total COD (including all the carbon source added, and<br>
those in the medium) had reached 7688 mg/L and aeration time had amounted to 11 days.<br>
Then anoxic denitrification was started. Aeration was stopped, and methanol and anhydrous<br>
NaAc were added according to the NO2--N concentration with chemical stoicheiomctry COD:<br>
NO2--N = 2.4:1. which was an experimental data and was different from the 1.71: 1 ratio in<br>
theory. Methanol was added according to mass ratio CH3OH: NO2--N=2.4: 1 (experimental<br><br>
data) or anhydrous NaAc was added according to mass ratio NaAc: NO2--N=4.57:l<br>
(experimental data). The mixture was then stirred to perform denitrification. A large amount<br>
of small bubbles were observed followed by sludge flotation. Once NO2--N fell below<br>
0.5mg/L. denitrification was stopped.<br>
Aeration could be continued to completely oxidize NH4+ into NO2- if there was still NH4-<br>
remaining. No carbon addition was required in the process and the denitrification process<br>
mentioned above could be repeated for several times once NO2- accumulation had reached a<br>
certain level. The end of the cultivation was marked by the fall of NH4+-N, NO2--N and NO3-<br>
N concentrations, each to below 1 mg/L. The sludge obtained could be used to treat all kinds<br>
of wastewater.<br>
The cultivation process mentioned above could be successfully carried out in the bucket<br>
reactor (150 Liter) as well as the previous beaker reactor. The sludge forms floes and had<br>
good settleability.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
The comparative examples compared the activity of nitrogen conversion by ammonia<br>
oxidizing bacteria at different temperatures in a single sequencing batch cultivation process<br>
when heterotrophic and autotrophic culture mediums were applied.<br>
Two kinds of soil samples were separately seeded into the culture substrate mentioned in<br>
Example 1 (heterotrophic culture substrate, represented by H in Tables 9 and 10) and<br>
modified inorganic Stephen culture medium (autotrophic culture substrate, represented by A<br>
in Tables 9 and 10). The amounts were 2.0 gram dried soil per liter solution. Both examples<br>
were carried out using single sequencing batch cultivation at 28Â°C in the same reactor'and<br>
under the same conditions. Apart from applying NaOH to adjust acidity,.no organic carbon<br>
source was added.<br>
The modified Stephenson cultivation medium was as follows with TN=NH4+-N =400mg/L<br>
and without sterilization:<br><br><br>
Table 9 compared the nitrogen conversions in two different culture substrates.<br>
fable 9 Nitrogen conversion rates for Yutu and Wushantu at 28Â°C in different culture<br>
substrates<br><br>
Griess-llosvay reagent test began to show positive and NO2--N
(2)Ammonia oxidation timeâTime needed until the Nessler's reagent test was negative and<br>
the Griess-llosvay reagent test was positive, indicating the disappearance of ammonia.<br>
(3)Nitrite oxidation timeâTime needed until both the Nessler's reagent test and the Griess-<br>
llosvay reagent test were negative and the diphenylamine reagent test was positive, indicating<br>
both NH4+-N and NO2--N less than 0.2mg/L.<br>
(4)Denitrification timeâTime needed until the diphenylamine reagent test and Griess-llosvay<br>
reagent test were both negative.<br>
The results shown in the tables above indicated that the rate of nitrification and denitrification<br>
in the heterotrophic culture substrate exceeded that in the autotrophic culture substrate. The<br>
sludge in the heterotrophic culture substrate formed floes but the sludge in the autotrophic<br>
culture substrate was small and had poor settleability which was in accordance with reported<br>
results.<br>
Similar operations were carried out at 15Â°C , and cultivated for 35 days (Table 10)<br>
fable 10 Nitrification for Yutu and Wushantu at 15Â°C in different culture substrates<br><br><br>
The results show that at low temperatures, cell growth was very poor with loosely organized<br>
particle formation in both heterotrophic and autotrophic culture substrates. No nitrification, in<br>
other words no accumulation of NO2--N and NO3--N, occurred.<br>
It was indicated that when single sequencing batch cultivation was applied, nitrification rate<br>
in either inorganic or organic culture substrates was extremely slow and the activated sludge<br>
was hard to obtain, which is in accordance with previous reports.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 2 describes the application of the activated sludge seeded from Wushantu in example<br>
1 to treat modeled wastewater of high organic carbon and nitrogen concentration.<br>
The activated sludge seeded from Wushantu in example 1 was taken as inoculums. The<br>
process was performed according to the flow chart shown in Figure 1: Reaction was stopped<br>
when ammonia fell below 3mg/L (no NO2--N or NO3--N accumulation); water was discharged<br>
and the sludge was left. The process was repeated continuously for 12 months, during which<br>
no sludge was discharged. Related technical parameters and treatment results were shown in<br>
Table 11.<br>
Table 11 Technical parameters for consecutive treatment of modeled wastewater with high<br>
organic carbon and nitrogen wastewater (TKN=424) using activated sludge seeded from<br>
Wushantu<br><br><br>
It could be concluded from Table 11 that during the consecutive treatment of modeled<br>
wastewater of high organic carbon and nitrogen concentration at 28Â°C with 2000mg/L seeded<br>
activated sludge and a single air diffuser, the total HRT, aeration time and non-aeration time<br>
significantly decreased with the increase of consecutive treatment times. Sludge volume,<br>
however, underwent slight increase until it was stabilized after the fourth continuous<br>
treatment cycle. About 22.2% of ammonia was oxidized to N2 and dissipated while the rest of<br>
the ammonia was removed through denitrification. .<br>
Table 12 Comparison of Concentrations between Influent (i.e., the wastewater before the<br>
treatment) and Effluent (i.e., the wastewater after the treatment)<br><br><br>
Effluent indexes substantially decreased (Table 12), thus the method proposed by the<br>
invention had effectively removed carbon and nitrogen from the wastewater.<br>
Examples 3~5<br>
Examples 3-5 described the application of the activated sludge seeded from Wushantu to treat<br>
monosodium glutamate wastewater, modeled fertilizer wastewater and modeled municipal<br>
wastewater in the same manner as example 2.<br>
Table 13 Technical Parameters for the consecutive treatment of wastewater with the activated<br>
sludge seeded from Wushantu at different temperatures<br><br>
It could be concluded that ammonia oxidation with NCV-N accumulation as an indicator, was<br>
able to take place rapidly. When temperature fell from 28Â°C to 15Â°C, oxidation was still able<br><br>
to occur but the oxidation rate decreased significantly. But as treatment times increased.<br>
HAOB were able to quickly adapt to the low temperature, and total biological reaction rate<br>
were increased and finally stabilized.<br>
Examples 6-10<br>
Examples 6-10 discussed the optimal temperature range and amount of seeded activated<br>
sludge most advantageous for the process. All the conditions in examples 6-10 were similar<br>
to examples 2-5. except that initial sludge concentration was 6000mg/L whereas in examples<br>
2-5 2000mg/I. was applied.<br>
Table 14 showed the water treatment results at different temperatures using a single air<br>
diffuser when activated sludge amount was increased.<br><br>
From comparison of Tables 14, 11 and 13, we could see that the increase of activated sludge<br>
could significantly improve treatment efficiency, and shorten total HRT. aeration time and<br><br>
non-aeration time. For continuous treatment of modeled municipal wastewater at low<br>
temperatures, the treatment efficiency was comparable to that of 28Â°C after a short period of<br>
adaptation. This reflected one of the core principals mentioned in this invention: removal of<br>
carbon and nitrogen under no-cell growth conditions.<br>
Tables 15 and 16 show the results of treating modeled wastewater of high organic carbon and<br>
nitrogen concentration and modeled fertilizer wastewater with different sludge concentrations<br>
using a single air diffuser at 28Â°C.<br>
Table 15 Technical parameters for treating modeled wastewater of high organic carbon and<br>
nitrogen concentration with different activated sludge concentrations<br>
28Â°C, activated sludge seeded from Wushantu, single air diffuser<br><br>
TN removal rate = Total nitrogen amount in the influent (mg)/Total HRT (hrs);<br>
Specific TN removal activity = TN removal rate (mgN.h-1)/ Total amount of sludge or MLSS<br>
(g):<br>
Specific ammonia oxidation activity = Total nitrogen amount in the influent (mg)/( Time for<br>
ammonia oxidation to nitrite (hrs) xtotal amount of sludge (g)).<br>
Table 16 Technical parameters for treating modeled fertilizer wastewater with different<br>
activated sludge concentrations<br>
28Â°C, activated sludge seeded from Wushantu, single air diffuser<br><br><br>
Tables 15 and 16 showed that in the treatment of modeled wastewater of high organic carbon<br>
and nitrogen concentration and modeled fertilizer wastewater, HRT. TN removal rate and time<br>
for ammonia oxidation to nitrite were substantially improved when sludge concentration was<br>
increased. Nevertheless, the specific TN removal activity and ammonia oxidation activity<br>
decreased significantly.<br>
Similarly, the operations of modeled municipal wastewater with different activated sludge<br>
concentrations at 15Â°C were shown in table 17.<br>
fable 17 Technical parameters for treating modeled municipal wastewater with different<br>
activated sludge concentrations at 15Â°C<br>
15Â°C, activated sludge seeded from Wushantu, single air<br>
diffuser<br><br>
Total HRT, TN removal rate and Time for ammonia oxidation to nitrite were significantly<br>
improved in proportion to the increase of seeded sludge. However, specific ammonia<br>
oxidation activity and specific total nitrogen removal activity slightly decreased.<br>
Examples 11â12<br>
Oxygen solubility in water at different temperatures was shown in Table 18.<br>
Table 18 Values of saturated dissolved oxygen (DO) as a function of temperature under<br>
standard atmospheric pressure<br><br><br>
Saturated DO significantly increased with the decrease of temperature which resulted in the<br>
insignificant difference of specific TN removal activity and specific ammonia oxidation<br>
activity under different sludge concentrations as shown in Examples 6-10.<br>
Therefore, we could deduce that the fundamental reason of the decreases of TN removal<br>
activity and ammonia oxidation activity was the low oxygen transfer efficiency in high<br>
concentrations of sludge. Increase in oxygen supply or the adoption of high efficient air<br>
diffusers might increase DO and improve oxygen transfer efficiency to achieve effective<br>
removal of carbon and nitrogen.<br>
Example 11 compared the results of treating modeled wastewater of high organic carbon and<br>
nitrogen concentration with different aeration and different sludge concentrations.<br>
Table 19 Technical parameters for the treatment of modeled wastewater of high organic<br>
carbon and nitrogen concentration with different aeration and different sludge concentrations<br><br><br>
Example 12 compared the results of treating modeled fertilizer wastewater with different<br>
aeration and different sludge concentrations (Table 20).<br>
Table 20 Technical parameters for the treatment of modeled fertilizer wastewater with<br>
different aeration and different sludge concentrations<br><br>
fables 19 and 20 demonstrated the operation results of treating modeled wastewater of high<br>
organic carbon and nitrogen concentration and modeled fertilizer wastewater with different<br>
aeration conditions. The improvement of aeration condition could substantially enhance<br>
treatment efficiency, reduce total HRT, aeration and non-aeration time, and steadily maintain<br>
the ammonia oxidation at the NO2--N accumulation stage.<br>
Tables 21 and 22 analyzed the various parameters (TN removal rate, specific TN removal<br>
activity and specific ammonia oxidation activity) for treating modeled wastewater of high<br>
organic carbon and nitrogen concentration and modeled fertilizer wastewater under different<br>
aeration conditions and using different sludge concentrations.<br><br>
Table 21 Technical parameters for the treatment of modeled wastewater of high organic<br>
carbon and nitrogen concentration with different aeration conditions<br><br>
When aeration conditions were improved and specific TN removal activity and specific<br>
ammonia oxidation activity remained constant, high sludge concentration resulted in the<br>
significant reduction of total HRT and time for ammonia oxidation to nitrite, and improved<br>
TN removal rate.<br>
Example 13<br>
1. Activated sludge cultivation using Yutu soil as inoculum<br>
The activated sludge cultivation using Yutu soil as inoculum was carried out by the same<br>
procedures as that described in Example 1. The cultivation time and amount of carbon source<br>
might differ slightly because of the difference in physicochemical properties of the soils, the<br><br>
composition of microorganisms, especially the HAOB species exhibiting high ammonia-to-<br>
nitrite oxidation activity. Bacillus pseudofirmus NH-2 dominated in Yutu soil while<br>
Arthrobacter globiformis WR-2 dominated in Wushantu soil.<br>
2. The consecutive treatment of modeled wastewater of high organic carbon and nitrogen<br>
wastewater concentration using activated sludge<br>
Following the above cultivation approach but at 15Â°C in the 150 Litre bucket reactor, Yutu<br>
soil was cultivated for 23 days, and then the sludge was filtered and served as inoculum, fable<br>
23 showed the treatment results of modeled wastewater of organic carbon and nitrogen<br>
concentration.<br>
fable 23 Technical parameters for treating modeled wastewater of high organic carbon and<br>
nitrogen concentration<br><br>
Due to the poor bacterial growth at 15Â°C, the sludge was further cultivated at 28Â°C. During<br>
the first cultivation, NO2--N accumulation was small and bacterial grew (Table 23). This was<br>
largely due to the fact that HABO growth is weak at 15Â°C. The process was carried out in<br>
parallel for 6 times.<br><br>
Examples 14~18<br>
With the same approach, the sludge produced from example 13 was filtered out, The results of<br>
consecutive treatment of various kinds of wastewater using 4000mg/L activated sludge were<br>
shown below:<br>
Table 24 Technical parameters for various wastewater treatments using activated sludge<br>
seeded from Yutu soil<br><br>
(l) Dilute the original monosodium glutamate wastewater with tap water in fold of 6.67.<br>
TKN=1500mg/L, COD=6746.6mg/L, BOD=1799.1mg/L;<br>
(2) Dilute the original monosodium glutamate wastewater with tap water in fold of 20.<br>
TKN=500mg/L. COD=2250mg/L, BOD=600mg/L.<br>
It should be noted that Yutu soil activated sludge was able to treat wastewater with high<br>
ammonia concentration, such as monosodium glutamate wastewater (NH3-N concentration<br>
ranging between 500-600 and 1500-1800ml/L) and modeled fertilizer wastewater. The high<br><br>
concentrations of NH3-N did not inhibit ammonia oxidation as described by conventional<br>
methods.<br>
Examples 19~20<br>
The final filtered sludge produced in Examples 14~18 was used as inoculum to treat modeled<br>
municipal wastewater and modeled wastewater of high organic carbon and nitrogen<br>
concentration.<br><br><br>
The treatment results were comparable or even better than that using activated sludge seeded<br>
from Wushantu. The decrease of oxygen transfer due to higher concentrations of sludge could<br>
also be avoided by improving aeration conditions to achieve highly effective carbon and<br>
nitrogen removal.<br>
Example 21<br>
The example related to the biological nitrogen removal of coking wastewater using the<br>
methods described in this invention.<br>
Coking wastewater, characterized by high COD and high NH3-N, was a special kind of<br>
industrial wastewater that defies other wastewater treatment methods mentioned above and<br>
therefore was hard to achieve NH3-N removal.<br>
A steel group in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province used the conventional activated sludge method to<br>
treat the dephcnolized and ammonia distillated coking wastewater with HRT â¥ 12 hrs. The<br>
water quality of the effluent after the aeration was shown in Table 27.<br><br>
The results were similar to other companies' reports: phenol and cyanide concentrations could<br>
basically reach the controlled standards while COD and NH3-N exceeded their corresponding<br>
limits. Short-cut (or complete) nitrification-denitrification processes were unable to be applied<br>
to this kind of wastewater because no nitrification took place in the reactors, therefore<br>
ammonia was unable to be removed.<br>
The main reasons are:<br>
(1) The activated-sludge method is a biological technique intended for the removal of BOD,<br>
therefore it is effective in treating biodegradable phenol, cyanide and thiocyanate. It is thus<br>
understandable that treatment of refractory complex organic compounds is unsatisfying.<br><br>
(2) The 24.4% of NH3-N removal efficiency by activated sludge is actually partially<br>
contributed by the release of N2 produced from heterotrophic ammonia oxidation during the<br>
non-cell-growth process of HAOB (no sludge was discharged in this treatment process). It is<br>
not resulted from air stripping as previously thought.<br>
Dephenolized and ammonia distillated coking wastewater was continuously aerated at 28Â°C<br>
before being discharged into the biological tank. The activated sludge proposed by the present<br>
inention was seeded into the tank. The pH value in the tank experienced continuous<br>
declined but the NH4+-N didn't reduce when volatile phenol reached corresponding standards<br>
(the point when NH4+-N removal reaches about 24%). Then sodium phenolate solution<br>
(containing of phenol (analytical grade) and sodium hydroxide), having pH adjusted between<br>
7.0 and 7.5, was added into the reactor every 12 hours. The solution was continuously aerated<br>
for 13 days before NH4+-N was completely removed. No NO2--N and NO3--N accumulations<br>
were detected. This practically confirmed that heterotrophs were able to oxidize NH4+-N into<br>
N2. On the other hand, ammonia removal efficiency was ineffective using this model. The<br>
process, besides requiring for COD input, was also time-consuming and consumed a vast<br>
amount of oxygen and energy. In all, the process was not applicable to ammonia removal<br>
from coking wastewater.<br>
In the activated sludge system, nitrification usually does not occur. This has largely been<br>
attributed to the inhibition of ammonia oxidation, especially the organic substances like CN-<br>
and SCN" inhibit nitrification or the more traditionally called ammonia oxidation process.<br>
Further investigations were carried out to see whether nitrification, with NO2--N or NO3--N<br>
accumulation as indicator would took place after inhibitory substances such as CN- and SCN-<br>
were removed.<br>
The inventor held that the basic cause for the difficulty in NH4+-N removal was the lack of<br>
carbon source needed by HAOB, especially highly active heterotrophs for ammonia oxidation<br>
to nitrite, which would prevent the ammonia oxidation. Due to this concern, the inventor<br>
designed a process combining continues flow reactor with SBR (Figure 3).<br><br>
In the process as shown in Figure 3, cyanide and cyanate etc was removed from dephenolized<br>
and ammonia distillated coking wastewater 1. The effluent 2 after sludge separation contained<br>
ammonia and entered the SBR where different concentrations of activated HAOB sludge were<br>
seeded. One of the specialties of the process was that organic carbon source 3. no less than<br>
20()mg/L. should be added during aeration. Ammonia oxidation was then carried out and held<br>
at the short-cut nitrification stage (NO2--N was end product) followed by denitrification after<br>
aeration was ceased.<br>
Treatment efficiency was shown in the following table.<br><br>
The COD of the coking wastewater after nitrogen removal was around 300mg/L. which was<br>
above the national standard (150mg/L). The remaining COD could be treated with Fenton<br>
reagent with Fe2+ and H2O2 (30%). When H2O2 reached 600mg/L or 900mg/L, COD fell to<br>
the level of 175.7mg/L and 130.5mg/L, respectively, which accorded with national standards.<br><br>
The carbon and nitrogen removal results of various wastewater treated by the method<br>
according to the invention was summarized in the Table 29.<br><br>
activated-sludge method.<br>
To further emphasize the advantages of this invention, we compared the anoxic short-cut<br>
denitrification methods in this invention and the aerobic simultaneous nitrification (SND)<br>
methods.<br>
SND was carried out under aeration and continuous mixing. When NH3-N was oxidized to<br>
NO2--N and further accumulated to a certain amount (30~50mg/L). carbon source (anhydrous<br>
NaAc) started to be added until the Griess-Ilosvay reagent test was negative (NO2-<br>
N
source consumption was calculated when the Griess-Ilosvay reagent test was positive (NO2--<br>
N&gt;0.5mg/L) about 5~10minutes later after the disappearance of nitrite. The time needed for<br><br>
aerobic denitrification was written down. The procedure was repeated until NH3-N and NO2--<br>
N fell below 3mg/L and 0.5mg/L. respectively. The reaction was stopped and total NaAc<br>
consumption and denitrification time was calculated.<br>
The results of treating monosodium glutamate wastewater using two kinds of activated sludge<br>
with two kinds of methods were listed below.<br>
Comparison of short-cut nitrification and denitrification in this invention and SND to treat<br>
monosodium glutamate wastewater (NH4+-N=500mg/L) using activated sludge seeded from<br>
Wushantu (4000mg/L) with single air diffuser was shown in Table 30.<br>

Tables 30 and 31 indicated that when activated sludge seeded from Wushantu soil was used,<br>
the carbon source needed for denitrifying every unit of NNO2--N using SND aerobic<br>
denitrification method was 3.74 times that of the method according to the present invention<br>
and the denitrification rate of SND was 25.7% of that of the method according to the present<br>
invention. Whereas when activated sludge seeded from Yutu was used, carbon source used in<br>
SND was 2.88 times of that in the method according to the present invention and<br>
denitrification rate was comparable in both methods, and denitrification rate for both methods<br>
were significantly higher than that using the activated sludge seeded from Wushantu. The<br>
cause underlying the differences related to the microorganism species.<br>
In general, compared with the method according to the present invention, SND required more<br>
carbon source, aeration and energy supply, and has slower reaction rate.<br><br>

This invention relates to a method that uses heterothrophic ammonia oxidation bacteria<br>
(HAOB) to remove carbon and nitrogen pollutants in wastewater. The method includes the<br>
cultivation of the heterotropic bacteria in an activated sludge environment and the removal of<br>
carbon and nitrogen from the wastewater. According to the physiological characteristics of<br>
HAOB and the principles of combined oxidation of carbon and nitrogen, the method is able to<br>
achieve simultaneous removal of carbon and nitrogen under the condition that the cells do not<br>
grow. The process is able to be carried out in the temperature range of 6-40Â°C. No excess<br>
sludge is produced in the process. The invention is able to control the process and product<br>
composition of anaerobic ammonia oxidation through the control of organic carbon source,<br>
and is able to realize zero-accumulation of NO3--N in the nitrification process. The invention<br>
can fully utilize existing activated sludge systems to remove carbon and nitrogen. Therefore<br>
there is no need to build new facilities, and all carbon and nitrogen removal processes can be<br>
finished in a single reactor.<br></td>
