The present invention relates to a cuxnmunications network for allocating guard bands and a method thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for scheduling time slots in a shared medium, or point-to-multipoint, communications network and a system incorporatinq the<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
In a Passive Optical Network (PON) which relies on including a guard band between upstream transmissions from each outstation, the size of the   guard   band   is   related  to   the   differential   distance   between   the outstations.   Assurning   no   measurement   of   the   relative   geopgaphic distances from the head end to each of the outstations is made, the guard band   increases   according  to   the   differential   distance   at  around   10 microseconds per kilometre distance. For example, on a PON covering a 10 Km distance with 32 outstalions 3200 microsecondG must be allowed tor   guard   band   when  interroguting   all   uutstations.   To   maintain   an upstream  efficiency of 80%, the total  active transmission  time  for   all outstations then amounts to 12800 (4 x 3200) microseconds and the total time to interrogate al outstations is 16 milliseconds.<br>
One problem arising from this is that many telecommunications services require a bounded transmission delay, typically no more than a few milliseconds for any given network element. A delay contribution of 16 milliseconds is therefore unacceptable. In many cases efficiency falls significantly as the total interrogation time is reduced.<br>
The simplest known form of Gigabit Ethernet PON (GEPQN) dispenses with ranging or marshalling of outstations and can nevertheless achieve useful performance within a limited set of parameters. One technique is to limit the differential distance from the splitter to each outstation. For example, the splitter may be placed 9 km from the headend, and the outstations all clustered within 1 km of this splitter. In such an arrangement, a GEPON with 80 % upstream bandwidth efficiency for a<br><br>
16-way split, a 1 km differential distance between outstations and a 4 ms<br>
latency can be achieved.<br>
A problem with such an arrangement is that increasing the differential distance or split ratio leads to a reduction in bandwidth efficiency or an unacceptable latency, meaning that such a simple GEPON has limited applicability.<br>
An alternative technique is to use a complex marshalling system, whereby a special messaging protocol is used between the headend and each outstation to measure the timing, and to marshal, or build out, the exact outstation transmit timing in order to reduce the inter-burst guard bands to an acceptable level. Problematically, this marshalling technique requires specialised silicon at both ends of the system. Such a system tends to be proprietary and difficult to standardise because it requires radical changes to long-established Ethemet-MAC designs.<br>
The present invention achieves efficiency close to that of a fully ranged system, but without the need for outstation delay build out.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention seeks to provide an improved method and apparatus for scheduling, time slots in a shared medium communications network which mitigates one or more problems associated with the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Gigabit Ethernet PONS have been proposed as a means of cost effectively providing fibre access to homes and businesses. Current techniques include a GEPON based on very simple protocols which trade off bandwidth for latency and limited fibre deployment rules, and significantly complex Ethernet PONs with complex marshalling systems for outstation management.<br>
The present invention provides a simple PON ranging protocol which eliminates these trade-offs and allows GEPONs with large numbers of outstations (e.g. 256 vs currently 16) to be achieved, while simultaneously eliminating differential distance limitations, all at high bandwidth efficiencies.<br>
This ranging technique will be of particular value for PONs above 1 Gbps and/or 32 way splits.<br>
This optical aggregation of traffic from smaller businesses will be of<br>
increasing    importance    as    optical    switching    and    multiplexing    of wavelengths becomes more, widespread.<br>
The  invention  relates in  particular to the implementation of point-to-muitipoint communications systems.  An important example of these is a passive optical network (PON).    A particular system in conjunction with which the present invention could be applied is disclosed in co-pending patent application entitled "Multiple Access System for Communications Network" filed  March  12,  2001   (as  a  Continuation-in-Part  of earlier application US 09/584,331 "Multiple Access System for Communications Network" filed May 30, 2000), and the contents of which is included herewith as Annex 1.     That application discloses how timeslots may be notified to outstations under headend control by sending messages firstly to silence a first transmitting outstation and then to permit a further outstation to begin transmission.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a typical access network configuration in accordance with the present invention: a single headend (in this case an Optical Line Termination Unit (OLT), but more generally a Line Termination Unit (LTU)) connected via a shared medium to a plurality of outstations 01-O6 ..In the. example. shown the shared medium is provided by optical fibres connecting the OLT to a first splitter S1 (ideally a passive splitter) from which multiple fibre lengths connect to the outstations O1-O4). One fibre length connects to a further splitter S2 which provides connection via further fibre lengths to outstations O5-O6.<br>
Communication in the downstream direction is physically multicast in nature - signals sent from the headend are received by all connected outstations - though individual frames may be addressed to specific outstations or themselves be directed to multicast addresses.<br>
Communication in the upstream direction shares the medium between the various outstations on a timesiot basis. Outstations are allocated timeslots in order to avoid collision in the upstream path, resulting in frame data loss and retransmission delay.<br>
Fibre based access networks intended for delivery of high bandwidth services to end customers can be based on so-called Passive Optical Networks (PONs). In a PON a head end OLT, which is typically located at<br>
the network operator's local point of presence, is connected to a number<br>
of ouistations O5-O6 via a fibre network. A single fibre connection links the head end to a passive optical splitter 31 which divides the optical power (typically, but not necessarily) equally between a number of fibres, each of which terminates at an outstaticn. Signals sent downstream from the head end arrive at a reduced power level at all outstations unless the signals are amplified in transit. Each outstation converts the optical signal to an  electrical signal and  decodes the information.  The information includes addressing information which identifies which components of the information flow are intended for a particular, outstation. In the upstream direction, each outstation is allocated a time interval during which it is permitted to impress an optical signal on the upstream fibre. The fibres from all outstations are combined at the optical splitter and pass over the common fibre link to the head end. Signals sourced from any outstation propagate only to the head end. The upstream network may use separate fibre links and splitter, or may use the same network as the downstream direction but using a different optical wavelength.    For Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) PONS, protocol for organising traffic to and from each outstation, known as the Full Services Access Network (FSAN) protocol, has been standardised.<br>
Typically, the propagation delay associated with the optical paths between, the head end and each outstation will differ. To prevent, collisions on the upstream path, the protocol must allow for this. Known protocols have achieved this either by creating a guard band between transmission opportunities for different outstations, or by causing each outstation to build out the optical path delay to a common value by adding delay in the electrical domain. The latter approach, often referred to as 'ranging' is more efficient, especially where the unit of transmission time for each outstaiion is small; this is the approach adopted by FSAN.<br>
FSAN is a relatively complex protocol, requiring large scale integrated circuit technology in a practical system. Such circuits are specialised for the PON application and are therefore relatively costly because of the relatively small volumes used. The present invention provides an alternative system for improving the efficiency of upstream transmission without introducing the complexity of a full ranging protocol, in particular by eliminating the need for logic at the outstations to build out the optical path delay to a common value.<br>
Though described here in terms of optical networks, the invention can<br>
clearly also be applied to other point to multipoint networks, including wireless networks.<br>
The operation of the ranging subsystem is described below by following an example where a new outstation is to be included in a polling cycle which already contains a number of existing outstations.<br>
First, the distance of the new outstation from the head end must be established. This can be done, for example, by physical measurement (from the field installation or from a map of the installation), or using electronic means, such as the method described in the following paragraph. The units of measurement are arbitrary.<br>
Electronic measurement of the outstation distance is already used in other PON protocols, such as FSAN. The description here covers one possible, and particularly simple, way of achieving this. During the polling cycle, a ranging window is introduced. During this window, only the outstation whose distance is to be measured is allowed to transmit in the upstream direction. Transmission from this outstation is initiated by sending a polling frame from the head end. When a polling frame is transmitted during the ranging window a signal generated in the MAC logic is used to start a counter. The counter counts clock pulses generated by a clock source. The exact speed of the clock source is unimportant save that the clock frequency should be high enough to measure the time delay to a sufficient level of accuracy, but not so high as to cause the counter to overflow during  the  counting  interval.     The  polling  frame  propagates to  the outstation whose address is contained in the address field of the polling frame.   During this time the counter continues to count clock pulses.  On receipt of the polling frame the selected outstation transmits onto the upstream medium any frame it has queued in its internal buffers. This frame propagates back to the head end. On receipt of a frame, the head end MAC logic generates a second signal to stop the counter. The value in the counter then represents the distance for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) PONS, from the head end to the outstation in some arbitrary unit  of  measurement.   This  value   is  transferred  to   a   memory  and associated with its corresponding outstation. Clearly, the ranging window must be long enough to allow the downstream signal and the reply to propagate to the furthest possible outstation distance and back. In this<br>
case, then, "distance" is measured as the round trip time delay, and one outstation is closer to the head end then another if its round-trip delay is shorter.<br>
To allow for the possibility of transient delay in any specific measurement, multiple measurements may be made, either within one time slot or over a number of cycles. The minimum distance measured may be used as the best estimate.<br>
Once an association is made between an outstation and its distance from the head end, the new outstation can be included in the normal polling cycle.<br>
Other outstations, which are already included in the polling cycle, will already have an associated distance measurement.<br>
!n the most preferred embodiment, the protocol compares the distance measurement obtained for the new outstation with measurements for existing outstations and inserts the. new outstation in the polling sequence such that the distance measurements increase numerically with the position of the outstation in the list. Thus, the outstation which is closest to the head end is polled first and the outstation which is furthest iway is polled last in the sequence, with other outstations inserted in increasing order of distance in between.<br>
During the polling cycle, it is now guaranteed that the next outstation in the sequence can be no closer to the head end than the currently active outstation. Thus, when transferring control from one outstation to the next, no guard band component need be inserted to allow for differential distance between outstations. Note, though, that other considerations in the protocol (such as the time taken for head end components to adapt to the new optical operating parameters of the new outstation) may require separate components in the guard band. Optionally, a small component may be inserted in the guard band to allow for errors and drift in distance measurements.<br>
When the last outstation has been polled, a longer guard band must be included since the next outstation to be polled will be closer to the head end. Note, though, that this guard band is included only once during the<br>
polling sequence, rather than between each outstation as required on a<br>
non-ranged system.<br>
By way of example, we consider a system containing 64 outstations with a 20 km reach. Further, we assume that a minimum guard band of 20 microseconds must be included between outstations to allow for non-distance-related considerations.<br>
In a non-ranged PON an additional 200 microseconds must be included in the guard band between consecutive outstations to allow for a possible 20 km offset. Total guard time is then 64 x (200 + 20)' =14 milliseconds. For an overall efficiency of 80%, total polling cycle time is 70 milliseconds.<br>
In a PON based on the present invention, a ranging window of 200 microseconds is required in addition to a single 20 km window to account for the 20 km reach (i.e. a further 200 microseconds) (that is, the single guard band between last and first slot in the cycle). Total guard time is then 400 + 64 x 20 = 1.7 milliseconds. Now, for a 80% efficiency, total polling cycle time falls to 8.4 milliseconds.<br>
In other embodiments, in which outstations are not placed in the polling cycle in strictly ascending order of distance from the headend, advantage may stiil be gained by observing that where an outstation to be allocated a. timeslot is no closer than the outstation allocated the immediately preceding timeslot , no guard band is necessary. This allows polling to take place in arbitrary order, whilst still minimising use of guard bands.<br>
According to the methods described in Annex 1, notification to each outstation  of permission to transmit  is  effected  by firstly sending a message to the currently transmitting outstation to cease transmission, followed by a message to the next outstation that it may now transmit. By combining that method with the present methods, which reduces guard band requirements, it is also possible in some arrangements that the order of the cease transmission and begin transmission messages may be reversed,   in particular this may be effected where the next outstation to be allocated a timesbt is sufficiently further away from the currently transmitting outstation that, even though it were to begin transmission before the currently transmitting outstation has ceased, nevertheless the currently transmitting outstaiion will have ceased sending data upstream over that part of the medium  shared  by the two outstations before<br>
transmission from the next outstation reaches the shared portion of the<br>
medium.<br>
Referring now to Figures 2 and 3, other methods are shown in accordance with the present invention, in particular Figure 2 illustrates a method of scheduling timesiots in which the distance of each outstation from the head end is established 20.<br>
A timeslot is then allocated 22 to one of the outstations.    The next outstation to be allocated a time slot may now be selected 24.  This may be any outstation, though in any specific implementation specific local selection criteria may be applied. If the selected outstation is closer to the head end then the outstation previously allocated a timesiot 26 then a guard band is allocated 27 (otherwise there is no need to allocate a guard band).     The next timeslot is then  allocated 28 to the  chosen  next outstation.    In this way guard bands are allocated only where the next outstation is closer to the head end then the outstation allocated the preceding time slot.   Which reduces the potential upstream band width required for guard bands.<br>
Figure 3 shows a particularly preferred embodiment of the method of Figure 2 in which, successive outstations are selected to minimise the number of guard bands required. Outstations are selected 34 in cyclic ascending order of distance from the head end, with the closest outstation following the furthest to complete the cycle. In this arrangement, a guard band is required 27 only between the timesiots allocated to the furthest and the closest outstations.<br>
Note that in practice it is the decision as to whether a guard band is required depends on the relative distances between each outstations and the head end rather then absolute distance: i.e. whether the next outstation is merely closer or further away then the previously selected outstation.<br>
Referring now to Figures 4(a) and 4(b) these are shown two particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention in which the point-to-multipoint network is arranged as a loop. From OLT 41 a transmitter 41 Oa, 41 Ob to OLT receiver 411 a. 411 b.<br>
In   Figure   4{a)   separate  paths   are   provided  downstream   for  OLT<br>
transmitter 41Oa to the outstations 411a - 413a and upstream from the outstation to the OLT receiver 411 a. Downstream traffic is distributed to the Outstations and upstream traffic combined by means of one or more taps 414a.<br>
The arrangement has the specific benefit that the round-trip delay for OLT transmitter to OLT receiver is substantially the same for all Outstations on the network. Consequently, so far as ranging is concerned, each outstation is at least as far from the OLT as each other. Therefore in whichever order upstream timeslots are allocated to outstations, no guard band need be allocated to allow for differential distance between outstations.<br>
In Figure 4(b) a logically similar arrangement is shown, but in this embodiment a single optical path is shared for both upstream and downstream traffic. In such a physical arrangement, downstream and upstream traffic would employ distinct wavelengths, whilst in the arrangement of Figure 4(a), the same wavelength could be used for both upstream and downstream traffic.<br>
Specifically, in the example illustrated, downstream traffic from the OLT 41 b transmitter 41 Ob is distributed to the outstations 411b - 413b via one or more taps 414b. Upstream traffic to the OLT receiver 411b similarly is combined onto the shared fibre by the same, or a similar, tap arrangement.<br>
Where the round-trip delay for all outstations is essentially the same, no ranging procedure need be performed, nor any "range" checks on which outstation may be allocated the next timeslot without first inserting a guard band.<br>
In situations in which a network operator might not be assured that the round trip delays are sufficiently equal, it may still be desirable to perform the ranging checks and, if needed, allocate timesiots according to round-trip distance form the OLT as in the basic method described above.<br>
This invention in conjunction with, for example, the time slot allocated<br>
protocols of co-pending application US 09/804,316 "Multiple Access System for Communications Networks" the content of which is included in<br>
Annex 1 can be used over rings of arbitrary length, where upstream and<br>
downstream traffic travel in the same direction around the ring.   !n the prior art, the guard band required is related to the differential distance to the head end, and hence the efficiency is radically reduced for distances in excess of 5 - 10 km, which is less than many metro rings. By using the same direction for both its downstream slot-allocation controi messages and the resulting  upstream traffic,  the length  of the rings does not contribute to the length of the guard band.   Calculations show that a ring PON with six outstations and a length of greater than 20 km is achievable without amplification.  Addition of amplification would extend both the ring length and the number of nodes which can be served.    In such an arrangement wave division multipfexing (WDM) could be used to separate downstream traffic from upstream traffic. For example downstream traffic could be transmitted at 1300nm whilst upstream traffic could use 1550nm, though cleariy other combinations are possible.    Nor is the invention limited to  use of a single wavelength for each  of downstream and upstream traffic.<br>
Any range or device value given herein may be extended or altered without losing the effect sought, as will be apparent to the skilled person for an understanding of the teachings herein.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A communication network for allocating guard bands<br>
comprising a headend (OLT), a plurality of outstations (01-06) and a<br>
shared medium connecting each outstation to the headend (OLT),<br>
characterised by:<br>
a guard band allocator arranged to allocate guard bands between successive first and second timeslots allocated to the outstations (01-06) only where the outstation allocated the second timeslot is closer to the head end (OLT) then the outstation allocated the first timeslot.<br>
2.	A communications network as claimed in claim 1, wherein a timeslot scheduler arranged to schedule timeslots for each outstation (01-06) responsive to measures of distance of each outstation from the headend.<br>
