Administration of the medicament or pharmaceutical composition as hereinbefore described, i.e. with (A) and (B) in admixture or separate, is preferably by inhalation, i.e. (A) and (B) are in inhalable form. The inhalable form of the medicament may be, for example, an atomizable composition such as an aerosol comprising the active ingredient, i.e. (A) and (B) separately or in admixture, in solution or dispersion in a propellant, or a nebulizable composition comprising a solution or dispersion of the active ingredient in an aqueous, organic or aqueous/organic medium. For example, the inhalable form of the medicament may be an aerosol comprising a mixture of (A) and (B) in solution or dispersion in a propellant, or a combination of an aerosol containing (A) in solution or dispersion in a propellant with an aerosol containing (B) in solution or dispersion in a propellant.  In another example, the inhalable form is a nebulizable composition comprising a dispersion of (A) and (B) in an aqueous, organic or aqueous/organic medium, or a combination of a dispersion of (A) in such a medium with a dispersion of (B) in such a medium.<br><br>
An aerosol composition suitable for use as the inhalable form of the medicament may comprise the active ingredient in solution or dispersion in a propellant, which may be chosen from any of the propellants known in the art. Suitable such propellants include hydrocarbons such as n-propane, n-butane or isobutane or mixtures of two or more such hydrocarbons, and halogen-substituted hydrocarbons, for example chlorine and/or fluorine-substituted methanes, ethanes, propanes, butanes, cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes, such as dichlorodifluorornethane (CFC 12), trichlorofluoromethane (CFC11), 1,2-dichloro-l,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (CFC114) or, particularly, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA134a) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA227), or mixtures of two or more such halogen-substituted hydrocarbons. Where the active ingredient is present in suspension in the propellant, i.e. where it is present in particulate form dispersed in the propellant, the aerosol composition may also contain a lubricant and a surfactant, which may be chosen from those lubricants and surfactants known in the art. Other suitable aerosol compositions include surfactant-free or substantially surfactant-free aerosol compositions. The aerosol composition may contain up to about 5% by weight, for example 0.0001 to 5%, 0.001 to 5%, 0.001 to 3%, 0.001 to 2%, 0.001 to 1%, 0.001 to 0.1%, or 0.001 to 0.01% by weight of the active ingredient, based on the weight of the propellant. Where present, the lubricant and surfactant may be in an amount up to 5% and 0.5% respectively by weight of the aerosol composition. The aerosol composition may also contain a co-solvent such as ethanol in an amount up to 30% by weight of the composition, particularly for administration from a pressurised metered dose inhalation device. The aerosol composition may further contain a bulking agent, for example a sugar such as lactose, sucrose, dextrose, mannitol or sorbitol, in an amount, for example, of up to 20%, usually 0.001 to 1%, by weight of the composition.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the inhalable form is a dry powder, i.e. (A) and (B) are present in a dry powder comprising finely divided (A) and (B) optionally together with at least one particulate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may be one or more materials known as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, preferably chosen from materials known as carriers in dry powder inhalation compositions, for example saccharides, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides and sugar alcohols such as arabinose, glucose, fructose^ ribose, mannose, sucrose, trehalose, lactose, maltose, starches, dextran, mannitol or sorbitol. An especially preferred carrier is lactose. The dry powder may be contained as unit doses in capsules of, for example, gelatin or plastic, or in blisters (e.g. of aluminium or plastic), for use in a dry powder inhalation device, which may be a single dose or multiple dose device, preferably in dosage units of (A) and (B) together with the carrier in amounts to bring the total<br><br>
weight of powder per capsule to from 5 mg to 50 mg. Alternatively, the dry powder may be contained in a reservoir in a multi-dose dry powder inhalation device adapted to deliver, for example, 3-25mg of dry powder per actuation.<br>
In the finely divided particulate form of the medicament, and in the aerosol composition where the active ingredient is present in particulate form, the active ingredient may have an average particle diameter of up to about 10 urn, for example 0.1 to 5 urn, preferably 1 to 5 jam. The particulate carrier, where present, generally has a maximum particle diameter up to 300 urn, preferably up to 212 u,m, and conveniently has a mean particle diameter of 40 to 100 jam, e.g. 50 to 75 Jim. The particle size of the active ingredient, and that of a particulate carrier where present in dry powder compositions, can be reduced to the desired level by conventional methods, for example by grinding in an air-jet mill, ball mill or vibrator mill, sieving, microprecipitation, spray-drying, lyophilisation or controlled crystallisation from conventional solvents or from supercritical media.<br>
The medicament may be a controlled release formulation comprising finely divided particles of (A) and (B) within a hydrophobic matrix material, e.g. comprising magnesium stearate, for example as described in international patent application WO 01/76575, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The inhalable medicament may be administered using an inhalation device suitable for the inhalable form, such devices being well known in the art. Accordingly, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical product comprising a medicament or pharmaceutical composition as hereinbefore described in inhalable form as hereinbefore described in association with one or more inhalation devices. In a further aspect, the invention provides an inhalation device, or a pack of two or more inhalation devices, containing a medicament or pharmaceutical composition as hereinbefore described in inhalable form as hereinbefore described.<br>
Where the inhalable form of the active ingredient is an aerosol composition, the inhalation device may be an aerosol vial provided with a valve adapted to deliver a metered dose, such as 10 to 100 u.1, e.g. 25 to 50 ui, of the composition, i.e. a device known as a metered dose inhaler. Suitable such aerosol vials and procedures for containing within them aerosol compositions under pressure are well known to those skilled in the art of inhalation therapy. For example, an aerosol composition may be administered from a coated can, for example as described in EP 0642992 A.<br><br>
Where the inhalable form of the active ingredient is a nebulizable aqueous, organic or aqueous/organic dispersion, the inhalation device may be a known nebulizer, for example a conventional pneumatic nebulizer such as an airjet nebulizer, or an ultrasonic nebulizer, which may contain, for example, from 1 to 50 ml, commonly 1 to 10 ml, of the dispersion; or a hand-held nebulizer, sometimes referred to as a soft mist or soft spray inhaler, for example an electronically controlled device such as an AERx (Aradigm, US) or Aerodose (Aerogen), or a mechanical device such as a RESPIMAT (Boehringer Ingelheim) nebulizer which allows much smaller nebulized volumes, e.g. 10 to 100 pi, than conventional nebulizers.<br>
Where the inhalable form of the active ingredient is the finely divided particulate form, the inhalation device may be, for example, a dry powder inhalation device adapted to deliver dry powder from a capsule or blister containing a dry powder comprising a dosage unit of (A) and (B) or a multidose dry powder inhalation (MDPI) device adapted to deliver, for example, 3-25 mg of dry powder comprising a dosage unit of (A) and (B) per actuation. The dry powder formulation preferably contains the active ingredients optionally together with a diluent or carrier, such as lactose, of the desired particle size distribution and a compound that helps to protect against product performance deterioration due to moisture e.g. magnesium stearate. Suitable such dry powder inhalation devices are well known. For example, a suitable device for delivery of dry powder in encapsulated form is that described in US 3991761, while a suitable MDPI device is that described in WO 97/20589.<br>
The medicament of the invention is preferably a pharmaceutical composition comprising a mixture of (A) as hereinbefore defined and (B) as hereinbefore defined, preferably together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as hereinbefore described. The molar ratio of (A) to (B) may be, in general, from 100:1 to 1:300, for example from 50:1 to 1:100 or from 20:1 to 1:50, preferably from 10:1 to 1:20, more preferably from 5:1 to 1:10, from 3:1 to 1:7 or from 2:1 to 1:2. The compound (A) and the compound (B) may be administered separately in the same ratio.<br>
A suitable daily dose of the compound (A), particularly as the bromide salt, for inhalation may be from 10 u,g to 2000 u.g, preferably from 60 to 1000 jag, and especially from 80 to 800 jig, e.g. from 20 to 500 u.g.<br><br>
A suitable daily dose of compound (B) for inhalation may be from 10 ug to 2000 jag, for example from 10 to 1500 ug, from 10 to 1000 ug, preferably from 20 to 800 ug, e.g. from 20 to 600 ug or from 20 to 500 ug.<br>
A suitable unit dose of compound (A), particularly as the bromide salt, may be from 10 ug to 2000 ug, preferably from 60 to 1000 ug, especially from 80 to 800 ug, e.g. from 20 to 500 ug.<br>
A suitable unit dose of compound (B) may be from 10 ug to 2000 ug, for example from 10 to 1500 ug, from 10 to 1000 ug, preferably from 20 to 800 ug, e.g. from 20 to 600 ^g or from 20 to 500 jig.<br>
These unit doses may be administered once or twice daily in accordance with the daily doses mentioned hereinbefore. A single dose is preferred. The precise unit and daily dose used will of course depend on the condition to be treated, the patient and the efficiency of the inhalation device.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the medicament of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition which is a dry powder in a capsule containing a unit dose of (A) and (B), for example for inhalation from a single capsule inhaler, the capsule suitably containing a unit dose of (A) e.g. as hereinbefore described, and a unit dose of (B), e.g. as hereinbefore described, together with a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier as hereinbefore described in an amount to bring the total weight of dry powder per capsule to between 5 mg and 50 mg, for example 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg, 40 mg, 45 mg or 50 mg.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the medicament of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition which is a dry powder for administration from a reservoir of a multi-dose dry powder inhaler adapted to deliver, for example, 3 mg to 25 mg of powder containing a unit dose of (A) and (B) per actuation, for example, where (A) is in the form of the maleate salt, a powder comprising, by weight, 20 to 2000 parts, for example 60 to 1000 parts, 100 to 500 parts, or 100 to 300 parts of (A); 25 to 800 parts, e.g. 25 to 500 parts, 50 to 400 parts, or 100 to 400 parts of (B); 0.2 to 1 part magnesium stearate, and 2000 to 25000 parts, e.g. 4000 to 15000 parts or 4000 to 10000 parts of a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier as hereinbefore described.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the medicament of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition which is an aerosol comprising (A) and (B) e.g. in a ratio as hereinbefore described, in a propellant as hereinbefore described, optionally together with a surfactant and/or a bulking agent and/or a co-solvent such as ethanol as hereinbefore described, for administration from a metered dose inhaler adapted to deliver an amount of aerosol containing a unit dose of (A) and a unit dose of (B), or a known fraction of a unit dose of (A) and a known fraction of a unit dose of (B), per actuation. Thus if, for example, the inhaler delivers half of the unit doses of (A) and (B) per actuation, the unit doses can be administered by two actuations of the inhaler.<br>

Such a kit suitably further comprises one or more inhalation devices for administration of (A) and (B). For example, the kit may comprise one or more dry powder inhalation devices adapted to deliver dry powder from a capsule, together with capsules containing a dry powder comprising a dosage unit of (A) and capsules containing a dry powder comprising a dosage unit of (B). In another example, the kit may comprise a multidose dry powder inhalation device containing in the reservoir thereof a dry powder comprising (A) and a multidose dry powder inhalation device containing in the reservoir thereof a dry powder comprising (B). In a further example, the kit may comprise a metered dose inhaler containing an aerosol comprising (A) in a propellant and a metered dose inhaler containing an aerosol comprising (B) in a propellant.<br>
The medicaments of the invention are advantageous in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways disease, exhibiting highly effective bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties. For instance, it is possible using the combination therapy of the invention to reduce the dosages of (A) or (B) required for a given therapeutic effect compared with those required using treatment with either (A) or (B) alone, thereby minimising possibly undesirable side effects. Furthermore, using the combinations of the invention, particularly using compositions containing (A) and (B), medicaments which have a rapid onset of action and a long duration of action may be prepared. Moreover* using such combination therapy, medicaments which result in a significant improvement in lung function may be prepared. In another aspect, using the combination therapy of the invention, medicaments which provide effective control of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases, or a reduction in exacerbations of such diseases, may be prepared. In a further aspect, using compositions of the invention containing (A) and<br><br>
(B), medicaments which reduce or eliminate the need for treatment with short-acting rescue medicaments such as salbutamol or terbutaline, may be prepared; thus compositions of the invention containing (A) and (B) facilitate the treatment of an obstructive or inflammatory airways disease with a single medicament.<br>
Treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic treatment. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma, mild asthma, moderate asthma, severe asthma, bronchitic asthma, exercise-induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma induced following bacterial infection. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include acute/adult lung injury (ALI), adult/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary, airways or lung disease (COPD, COAD or COLD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, bronchiectasis and exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly<br><br>
(<br>
occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tobacosis and byssinosis.<br>
