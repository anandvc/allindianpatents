SUBSTITUTED UREA NEUROPEPTIDE Y Y5 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/308,433 filed on July 26, 2001.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to neuropeptide Y Y5 receptor antagonists useful in the treatment of obesity and eating disorders, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36 amino acid neuropeptide that is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems. NPY is a member of the pancreatic polypeptide family that also includes peptide YY and pancreatic polypeptide (Wahlestedt, C.f and Reis, D., Ann. Rev. Toxicol., 32, 309, 1993). NPY elicits its physiological effects by activation of at least six receptor subtypes designated Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5 and Y6 (Gehlert, D., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 218, 7, 1998; Michel, M. et al., Pharmacol. Rev., 50, 143, 1998). Central administration of NPY to animals causes dramatically increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure (Stanley, B. and Leibowitz, S„ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 3940, 1985; Billingtonetal., Am J. Physiol., 260, R321, 1991). These effects are believed to be mediated at least in part by activation of the NPY Y5 receptor subtype. The isolation and characterization of the NPY Y5 receptor subtype has been reported (Gerald, C. et al., Nature, 1996, 382, 168; Gerald, C. et al. WO 96/16542). Additionally, it has been reported that activation of the NPY Y5 receptor by administration of the Y5 - selective agonist [D-Trp32]NPY to rats stimulates feeding and decreases energy expenditure (Gerald, C. et al., Nature, 1996, 382, 168; Hwa, J. et al., Am. J. Physiol., 277 (46), R1428, 1999). Hence, compounds that block binding of NPY to the NPY Y5 receptor subtype should have utility in the treatment of obesity, disorders such as, bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, and in the treatment of<br><br>
disorders associated with obesity such as type II diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.<br>
PCT patent application WO 00/27845 describes a class of compounds, characterized therein as spiro-indolines, said to be selective neuropeptide Y Y5 receptor antagonists and useful for the treatment of obesity and the complications associated therewith. Urea derivatives indicated as possessing therapeutic activity are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,623,662 (antiatherosclerotic agents) and 4,405,644 (treatment of lipometabolism).<br>
Provisional application, U.S. Serial No. 60/232,255 describes a class of substituted urea neuropeptide Y Y5 receptor antagonists.<br>

Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by S. Berge et a/, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66(1) 1-19;<br><br>
Orange Book (Food &amp; Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as benzathines, dicyclohexylamines, hydrabamines (formed with N,N-bis(dehydroabietyl)ethylenediamine), N-methyl-D-glucamines, N-methyl-D-glucamides, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyi, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.<br>
All such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.<br>
Compounds of formula I or formula III, and salts and solvates thereof, may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether). All such tautomeric forms are contemplated herein as part of the present invention.<br>
All stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds (including those of the salts and solvates of the compounds), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms "salt", "solvate" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt and solvate of<br><br>
When any variable (e.g., aryl, heterocycle, R1, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in formula I or formula III, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
For compounds of the invention having at least one asymmetrical carbon atom, all isomers, including djastereomers, enantiomers and rotational isomers are contemplated as being part of this invention. The invention includes d and I isomers in both pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures.

Compounds of formula I or formula III can exist in unsolvated and solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms, with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like, are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for purposes of this invention.<br>
A compound of formula I or formula III may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with organic and inorganic acids. For example, pyrido-nitrogen atoms may form salts with strong acids, while tertiary amino groups may form salts with weaker acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those skilled in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base forms with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution, such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia or sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salts are otherwise equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.<br>

HEK-293 cells expressing the Y5 receptor subtype were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles1 media (Gico-BRL) supplemented with 10% FCS (ICN), 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 200 g/ml Geneticin®(GibcoBRL #11811-031) under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Two days prior to assay, cells were released from T-175 tissue culture flasks using cell dissociation solution (1X; non-enzymatic [Sigma #C-5914]) and seeded into 96-well, flat-bottom tissue culture plates at a density of<br><br>
15,000 to 20,000 cells per well. After approximately 48 hours, the cell monolayers were rinsed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) then pre-incubated with approximately 150 pl/well of assay buffer (HBSS supplemented with 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2% BSA [HH]) containing 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine ([IBMX] Sigma #1-587) with or without the antagonist compound of interest at 37°C. After 20 minutes the 1 mM IBMX-HH assay buffer (± antagonist compound) was removed and replaced with assay buffer containing 1.5 pM (CHO cells) or 5 pM (HEK-293 cells) forskolin (Sigma #F-6886) and various concentrations of NPY in the presence or absence of one concentration of the antagonist compound of interest. At the end of 10 minutes, the media were removed and the cell monolayers treated with 75 pi ethanol. The tissue culture plates were agitated on a platform shaker for 15 minutes, after which the plates were transferred to a warm bath in order to evaporate the ethanol. Upon bringing all wells to dryness, the cell residues were re-solubilized with 250 pi FlashPlate® assay buffer. The amount of cAMP in each well was quantified using the [125l]-cAMP FlashPlate® kit (NEN #SMP-001) and according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Data were expressed as either pmol cAMP/ml or as percent of control. All data points were determined in triplicate and ECso's (nM) were calculated using a nonlinear (sigmoidal) regression equation (GraphPad Prism™). The KB of the antagonist compound was estimated using the following formula:<br><br>
where<br>
[A]	is the EC50 of the agonist (NPY) in the absence of antagonist,<br>

Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 pM NPY. The<br><br>
reaction mixtures were incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature then filtered through Millipore MAFC glass fiber filter plates which had been pre-soaked in 0.5% polyethleneimine. The filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and radioactivity was measured in a Packard TopCount scintillation counter.<br>
