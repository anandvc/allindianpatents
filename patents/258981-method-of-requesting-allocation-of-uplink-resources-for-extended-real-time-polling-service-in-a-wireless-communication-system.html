METHOD OF REQUESTING ALLOCATION OF UPLINK RESOURCES<br>
FOR EXTENDED REAL-TIME POLLING SERVICE IN A WIRELESS<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an uplink scheduling method in<br>
a wireless communication system, and in particular, to a method of scheduling<br>
uplink resources for Extended Real-Time Polling Service (ertPS) supporting<br>
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
A scheduling scheme is needed to efficiently use resources in a wireless<br>
communication system which provides a variety of services with limited<br>
resources. It is ideal that unnecessarily allocated resources are rapidly returned<br>
and re-allocated to necessary services. Also, it is necessary to reduce the amount<br>
of information sent with wireless resources and use the extra resources for other<br>
purposes.<br>
Many uplink scheduling schemes have been proposed for VoIP. They<br>
include Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS), Real-Time Polling Service (rtPS), and<br>
ertPS.<br>
In UGS, a fixed amount of uplink resources are allocated upon user<br>
request. Hence, a user transmits data with the allocated uplink resources. rtPS<br>
allocates required resources in response to a periodic uplink resource allocation<br>
request from the user. The user transmits data with resources appropriately<br>
allocated according to the amount of the data.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional uplink resource scheduling for UGS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the status of a Mobile Station (MS) is divided into a<br>
talk-spurt period and a silence period on the time axis. The talk-spurt period is an<br>
on-period with transmission of data packets from the MS, while the silence period<br>
is an off-period without any transmission of data packet. The same resources are<br>
allocated to the MS during both periods. In the illustrated case of FIG. 1,<br>
resources supporting a full rate, Rate 1 are constantly allocated.<br><br>
-2-<br>
However, the MS does not use all the allocated resources in transmitting<br>
data. During silence periods 110 and 118, the MS uses only minimum resources<br>
required to maintain the service (e.g. Rate 1/8).<br>
It occurs that only a fraction of the allocated resources are used during the<br>
talk-spurt period. In other words, the MS transmits data packets using the whole<br>
or part of the resources during the talk-spurt period. For instance, the MS<br>
transmits data packets at Rate 1, that is, using the entire allocated resources<br>
during a talk-spurt period 112. Yet, it uses Rate 1/2 (i.e. half of the resources)<br>
during a talk-spurt period 114. As the amount of transmission data is further<br>
reduced, the MS transmits the data packets at Rate 1/4 (i.e. 1/4 of the resources)<br>
during a talk-spurt period 116. During a silence period 118, the MS uses the<br>
minimum resources supporting the minimum rate, Rate 1/8.<br>
As described above, the constantly allocated resources are not fully<br>
utilized during the periods 114, 116 and 118. The existence of the resulting extra<br>
resources implies inefficient uplink scheduling. Therefore, uplink resources are<br>
wasted during the talk-spurt periods as well as during the silence periods.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a conventional uplink resource scheduling for rtPS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the status of an MS is divided into a talk-spurt period<br>
and a silence period on the time axis. The talk-spurt period is an on-period with<br>
transmission of data packets to be sent from the MS, while the silence period is an<br>
off-period without any transmission of data packet.<br>
In rtPS, the MS requests uplink resource allocation to a base station<br>
(BS) in steps 212 to 236. The requested resources are decided based on the<br>
amount of packet data to be transmitted from the MS. The BS allocates the<br>
requested uplink resources to the MS. The MS then transmits the data packets<br>
using the allocated resources during periods 210, 220 and 230.<br>
In the illustrated case of FIG. 2, there are three talk-spurt periods 210, 220<br>
and 230 according to data rates. The MS transmits data at Rate 1 during the first<br>
talk-spurt period 210, at Rate 1/2 during the second talk-spurt period 220, and at<br>
Rate 1/4 during the third talk-spurt period 230. Therefore, the MS uses different<br>
amounts of resources during the periods. The talk-spurt periods change from 210<br>
to 230 due to the decrease of data rate.<br><br>
-3-<br>
More specifically, upon generation of data packets to be transmitted, the<br>
MS requests resource allocation in step 212. The BS then allocates maximum<br>
resources to support a maximum rate (e.g. Rate 1). The MS transmits the data<br>
packets at Rate 1 using the allocated resources. The transmission of data packets<br>
at Rate 1 is repeated during the talk-spurt period 210.<br>
As the amount of transmission data is reduced, and thus the data rate<br>
needs to be changed, the MS requests resource allocation supporting the<br>
decreased data rate (e.g. Rate 1/2) in step 222. The MS then transmits the data<br>
packets using allocated resources. The transmission of data packets at Rate 1/2 is<br>
repeated during the talk-spurt period 220.<br>
When the data rate is further decreased during the talk-spurt period 230,<br>
the MS requests allocation of resources supporting the further decreased data rate<br>
(e.g. Rate 1/4) in step 232. The MS then transmits data packets at Rate 1/4. The<br>
transmission of data packets at Rate 1/4 is repeated during the talk-spurt period<br>
230.<br>
After completing the data packet transmission, the MS operates using the<br>
minimum resources (e.g. Rate 1/8) during a silence period 240.<br>
As noted from the above description, rtPS requires periodic polling (i.e.<br>
uplink resource request, steps 212 to 218, steps 222 to 226, and steps 232 to 236).<br>
Even within a period requiring the same amount of resources 210, 220 or 230,<br>
periodic polling takes place (in steps 214 to 218, steps 224 and 226, or steps 234<br>
and 236). The unnecessary polling leads to a waste of uplink resources.<br>
Since both UGS and rtPS allocate uplink resources periodically according<br>
to scheduling type irrespective of the real-time status of the MS, uplink<br>
scheduling cannot be performed efficiently, reflecting the time-variant status of<br>
the MS.<br>
Compared to UGS and real time Polling Service(rtPS), Extended-real<br>
time Polling Service(ertPS) allocates resources upon a MS request and enables<br>
transmission of data packets using the allocated resources without polling until<br>
the resources are changed. The MS expects to receive the same resources from the<br>
BS without any further polling in ertPS.<br>
When a data rate decrease is required, the MS transmits data packets at<br><br>
-4-<br>
the decreased data rate. Simultaneously, the MS notifies the BS of the change of<br>
resources due to the decrease of the data rate. Therefore, the BS can use the extra<br>
resources saved from the MS for other purposes.<br>
The MS uses the Extended PiggyBack Request (PBR) field of a Grant<br>
Management subheader to notify the BS of the change of the data rate. The Grant<br>
Management subheader has the following configuration.<br><br>
Table 1<br>
Syntax	Size	Notes<br>
	(bits)	<br>
Grant Management Subheader {	-	-<br>
if (scheduling service type==UGS) {	-	-<br>
SI	1	-<br>
PMFT T	11	-<br><br>

FLI	1	-<br>
FL	4	-<br>
} else {	-	-<br>
Piggyback Request	16	-<br>
     }	-	-<br>
  }	-	-<br>
In Table 1, one Most Significant Bit (MSB) of Extended PBR is used as<br>
an indicator indicating the change of data rate. If the MSB is set to 1, it implies<br>
that the data rate is changed. The remaining 10 Least Significant Bits (LSBs) of<br>
Extended PBR indicate the changed data rate. If the MSB is set to 0, it implies<br>
that the data rate is unchanged.<br>
Alternatively, the MS can request allocation of a bandwidth<br>
corresponding to a requested data rate by the Bandwidth Request (BR) field of a<br>
BR and Uplink (UL) transmit power report header which is formatted as follows.<br><br>
	Table 2			<br>
HT=1(1)	EC=0(1)	Type(3)=0b011	BR(ll)<br>
UL TX Power (8)	CID MSB (8)<br>
CID LSB (8)	HCS (8)<br>
Referring to Table 2, one MSB of BR is used as an indicator indicating<br>
the change of data rate. If the MSB is set to 1, it implies that the data rate is<br>
changed. The 10 LSBs of BR indicate the changed data rate. If the MSB is set to<br>
0, it implies that BR and UL transmit power report header is a typical header<br>
requesting a bandwidth for resource allocation.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a conventional uplink scheduling for ertPS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the status of an MS is divided into a talk-spurt period<br>
and a silence period on the time axis. The talk-spurt period is an on-period with<br>
transmission of data packets to be sent from the MS, while the silence period is an<br>
off-period without any transmission of data packet.<br>
When transitioning from the silence period to the talk-spurt period, the<br>
MS requests resource allocation to the BS by a BR header in step 310. Table 2<br>
above showing the bandwidth request and uplink transmit power report header is<br>
an example of the BR header. The BR header carries bandwidth request<br>
information requesting allocation of the same resources without any further<br>
polling.<br>
Upon receipt of the BR header, the BS allocates resources corresponding<br>
to a maximum data rate periodically to the MS during the talk-spurt period 312.<br>
The MS transmits data at the maximum data rate.<br>
When the data rate is to be changed, the MS transmits data at the changed<br>
data rate during the next talk-spurt period. The changed data rate is lower than the<br>
previous data rate. In the illustrated case Rate 1 decreases to Rate 1/2. Meanwhile,<br>
the MS notifies the BS of the change of data rate by a Grant Management<br>
subheader. Then the MS transmits data at the changed data rate periodically<br>
5<br><br>
during the talk-spurt period 314.<br>
Upon receipt of the Grant Management subheader, the BS allocates as<br>
minimum resources as supporting Rate 1/2. The BS then allocates the extra<br>
resources saved from the MS for other purposes.<br>
If the data rate is further to be decreased during data transmission at Rate<br>
1/2, the MS transmits data at Rate 1/4 during the next talk-spurt period 316.<br>
Meanwhile, the MS notifies the BS of the change of data rate by a Grant<br>
Management subheader. Then the MS transmits data at the changed data rate<br>
periodically during the talk-spurt period 316. The BS allocates as minimum<br>
resources as supporting Rate 1/4.<br>
6<br>
If the data rate is further to be decreased during data transmission at Rate<br>
1/4, the MS changes the data rate to Rate 1/8 for the next talk-spurt period.<br>
Meanwhile, the MS notifies the BS of the change of data rate by a Grant<br>
Management subheader. The BS then allocates as minimum resources as<br>
supporting Rate 1/8.<br>
As described above, when the data rate decreases, the MS transmits<br>
information about the changed data rate to the BS by the Grant Management<br>
subheader, and the BS allocates resources to the MS according to the changed<br>
data rate.<br>
However, it may occur that the MS wants to increase the decreased data<br>
rate during the talk-spurt period. In order to transmit uplink data at the increased<br>
data rate, the MS needs as much as possible uplink resources . However, there is<br>
no specified method for notifying the BS of the intention of the MS regarding the<br>
increase of the data rate. Accordingly, there exists a need for a method of<br>
increasing a decreased data rate in an MS during a talk-spurt period.<br>
Conventionally, the BS periodically allocates resources supporting the<br>
minimum data rate to the MS during the silence period, and the MS, when<br>
transitioning from the silence period to the talk-spurt period, requests a bandwidth<br>
using the minimum resources. During the silence period, hence, the BS<br>
periodically allocates the MS uplink resources supporting transmission of a 6-<br>
byte BR header or uplink resources supporting transmission of a BR subheader in<br>
the form of a piggy back request as illustrated in Table 1, that is, a 6-byte Generic<br>
Medium Access Control (MAC) header and a 2-byte Grant Management<br>
subheader. While these minimum resources are needed for the MS to request a<br><br>
-7-<br>
bandwidth for transitioning from the silence period to the talk-spurt period, the<br>
periodic resource allocation may not be needed because the MS does not know<br>
when to transition to the talk-spurt period.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description,<br>
well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they<br>
would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention provides a method of increasing the data rate of an<br>
Mobile Station (MS) in Extended-real time Polling Service (ertPS) uplink<br>
scheduling. It is assumed that the MS is transmitting data packets at a lower rate<br>
than a maximum rate. For this purpose, a method of transmitting rate increase<br>
information requesting a rate increase to a BS (Base Station) by the MS is<br>
provided.<br>
Conventionally, when the data rate is equivalent to no data transmission,<br>
minimum resources supporting a minimum rate are periodically allocated. In<br>
contrast, resources are allocated only upon request of the MS in the present<br>
invention.<br>
Regarding uplink scheduling according to the present invention, the<br>
operations of the MS and the BS will be separately described below.<br>
A. MS Operation<br>
FIGs. 4 and 5 are flowchart diagrams illustrating an operation for uplink<br>
scheduling for ertPS in the MS according to the present invention. Specifically,<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart diagram illustrating an MS operation when the MS is not<br>
transmitting data and FIG. 5 is a flowchart diagram illustrating an MS operation<br>
when the MS is transmitting data.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the MS monitors the presence or absence of<br>
transmission data in step 410. In the absence of transmission data, the MS is kept<br>
in an off state. In the presence of transmission data, the MS requests bandwidth<br>
allocation in step 412. The present invention is based on the premise that<br>
resources are not allocated to the MS in an initial state, i.e. in an off state.<br><br>
-10-<br>
Therefore, a novel technique must be developed for the MS in the off state to<br>
request bandwidth allocation, which will be described later in detail.<br>
In step 414, the MS is allocated a bandwidth from the BS. The bandwidth<br>
is one requested by the MS or a bandwidth supporting a predetermined maximum<br>
rate. In the present invention, the latter case is assumed. The MS starts data<br>
transmission at a data rate corresponding to the bandwidth in step 416.<br>
The MS, which has initiated the data transmission in the procedure of FIG.<br>
4, continues its operation in an on state according to the procedure of FIG. 5.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the MS transmits data at the data rate corresponding<br>
to the bandwidth in step 510. During the data transmission, the MS determines<br>
whether the data rate needs to be changed (i.e. increase or decrease in steps 512<br>
and 520). If neither a rate increase nor a rate decrease is required, the MS<br>
continues data transmission at the current data rate in step 510.<br>
However, if a rate decrease is required, the MS requests a rate decrease in<br>
step 514. The MS determines whether the requested data rate is a minimum rate<br>
in step 516.<br>
In case of the minimum rate, the MS transitions to the off state,<br>
considering that the allocated bandwidth has been released in step 518 because<br>
resources are not allocated to the MS in an off-state in the present invention. The<br>
MS then operates in the procedure of FIG. 4.<br>
The minimum rate is a data rate that does not affect the quality of<br>
communication even though the MS transmits no data. In general, the minimum<br>
rate is Rate 1/8 or lower. In this case, the MS sets the MSB of the Extended<br>
PiggyBack Request (PBR) field of the Grant Management subheader to 1 and sets<br>
the 10 LSBs to Rate 1/8 or lower in order to request a rate decrease. Consequently,<br>
the BS does not need to allocate a bandwidth to the following frames any more.<br>
If the requested rate is not the minimum rate, the MS is allocated a<br>
reduced bandwidth in step 524. The MS then continues data transmission at a data<br>
rate corresponding to the allocated bandwidth in step 510.<br>
On the other hand, if a rate increase is required, the MS requests a rate<br>
increase in step 522. For the rate increase, an extra bandwidth must be available.<br><br>
-11-<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a method of allocating an additional<br>
bandwidth for a rate increase request, which will be described later in detail.<br>
In step 524, the MS is allocated an increased bandwidth. The MS then<br>
returns to step 510 in which it continues data transmission at a data rate<br>
corresponding to the allocated bandwidth.<br>
The bandwidth allocation request step 412 and the rate increase request<br>
step 522 will be described in detail below.<br>
Requesting a bandwidth allocation and a rate increase can be considered<br>
in two ways: by a general bandwidth request (BR) header or by a codeword over<br>
a Channel Quality Information CHannel (CQICH) (i.e. CQICH codeword). The<br>
rate increase request is applied when a lower rate than a maximum rate negotiated<br>
during an initial service setup is used.<br>
Regarding the use of the bandwidth request header, for example, the MS<br>
can use the BR field and UL transmit power report header as the bandwidth<br>
request header. Besides, the MS can use any header that can carry a bandwidth<br>
request, such as a PBR. Meanwhile, when increasing a data rate, the MS transmits<br>
a bandwidth request header containing a requested bandwidth. The BS then<br>
allocates uplink resources corresponding to the requested bandwidth to the MS.<br>
For example, the BS allocates a predetermined maximum bandwidth in case of a<br>
bandwidth allocation request or the requested bandwidth in case of a rate increase<br>
request.<br>
To transmit the bandwidth request header, the MS needs to be allocated<br>
uplink resources. Thus, the MS transmits a bandwidth request code to request<br>
allocation of uplink resources for transmission of the bandwidth request header.<br>
The MS can transmit the bandwidth request code in an uplink slot<br>
allocated for use in requesting a bandwidth (bandwidth request slot). The uplink<br>
bandwidth request slot is a slot used for ranging in an existing wireless network.<br>
Hence, the uplink bandwidth request slot is available without allocation of<br>
additional resources. L of 255 codes are pre-defined as bandwidth request codes<br>
for allocation of uplink resources. L is the positive integer.<br>
The MS selects one of the L bandwidth request codes and transmits the<br>
selected bandwidth request code in the bandwidth request slot. The bandwidth<br><br>
-12-<br>
request then allocates uplink resources required for transmission of the bandwidth<br>
request header.<br>
As described above, the MS requests uplink resources for transmission of<br>
a bandwidth request header by transmitting a bandwidth request code. The MS<br>
can transmit the bandwidth request header using resources allocated by the BS.<br>
The bandwidth request field of the bandwidth request header contains information<br>
about uplink resources supporting a requested data rate.<br>
Regarding transmission of a CQICH codeword, the MS generally delivers<br>
feedback information or anchor BS switching information in a Fast Base Station<br>
Switching (FBSS) operation on the CQICH. For each operation, a CQICH<br>
codeword is predetermined. Hence, the MS transmits a CQICH codeword<br>
corresponding to an intended operation on the CQICH channel. In accordance<br>
with the present invention, one of predetermined CQICH codewords is used to<br>
increase a decreased data rate or request bandwidth allocation in an off state, for<br>
ertPS. The MS, which supports ertPS, transmits a CQICH codeword<br>
predetermined for using a high data rate or a CQICH codeword predetermined for<br>
bandwidth allocation on the CQICH. The transmitted CQICH codeword is pre-<br>
defined to request uplink resources to the BS.<br>
Upon receipt of the CQICH codeword, the BS recognizes that the MS<br>
requests a rate increase or bandwidth allocation. The BS then allocates uplink<br>
resources supporting the maximum rate or uplink resources supporting a<br>
requested rate increase to the MS. The maximum rate is determined by an initial<br>
service negotiation procedure between the MS and the BS.<br>
B. BS Operation<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart diagram illustrating an operation for uplink<br>
scheduling for ertPS in the BS according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the BS monitors reception of a bandwidth allocation<br>
request from the MS in an off state in step 610. The bandwidth allocation is<br>
requested by a bandwidth request header, a bandwidth request code or a CQICH<br>
codeword from the MS.<br>
Upon receipt of the bandwidth allocation request, the BS allocates a<br>
requested bandwidth by the MS or a bandwidth supporting a maximum rate<br>
decided during an initial service negotiation with the MS in step 612 and receives<br><br>
-13-<br>
data from the MS at a rate corresponding to the allocated bandwidth.<br>
In step 616, the BS determines whether a Grant Management subheader<br>
requesting a decrease of the current bandwidth is piggybacked in the received<br>
data. In the absence of the bandwidth decrease request, the BS monitors reception<br>
of a rate increase request in step 622.<br>
In the absence of the rate increase request, the BS receives data by re-<br>
allocating the current bandwidth in step 614, considering that there is no change<br>
in the data rate of the MS.<br>
On the contrary, upon receipt of the rate increase request, the BS allocates<br>
the requested bandwidth in step 620. If the rate increase request does not provide<br>
information about the requested data rate, the BS can allocate the bandwidth<br>
supporting the maximum rate. The rate increase request is also made by one of a<br>
bandwidth request header, a bandwidth request code and a CQICH codeword.<br>
If receiving the Grant Management subheader including rate change<br>
information (i.e. the rate decrease request) in step 616, the BS determines whether<br>
the requested rate is a minimum rate in step 618. The minimum rate is a non-zero<br>
data rate that does not affect communication quality even though the MS<br>
transmits no data.<br>
If the requested rate is not the minimum rate, the BS allocates a<br>
bandwidth based on the data rate set in the Grant Management subheader in step<br>
620. In step 614, the BS receives data using the newly allocated bandwidth.<br>
In case of the minimum rate, the BS determines that the MS will not<br>
transmit any more data. Thus, the BS determines whether the MS requests<br>
bandwidth allocation, without allocating any further bandwidth, in step 610. Also,<br>
when the 10 LSBs of the Extended PBR of the Grant Management subheader are<br>
0, the BS does not allocate a bandwidth from the next frame on.<br>
C. Signaling<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow between the MS and the BS<br>
for uplink scheduling in ertPS according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, an MS 740 has no data to transmit to a BS 750 and<br>
thus stays in an off period in step 701. Upon generation of transmission data in<br><br>
-14-<br>
step 703, the MS 740 transmits to the BS 750 a codeword requesting bandwidth<br>
allocation for data transmission on a CQICH in step 705. In step 707, the BS 750<br>
determines that the MS 740 needs uplink resources supporting a maximum rate.<br>
The BS then allocates the uplink resources corresponding to the maximum rate to<br>
the MS 740 in step 709. In step 711, the MS transmits data to the BS 750 using<br>
the allocated uplink resources. The BS 750 periodically allocates the uplink<br>
resources in step 713. The MS 740 and the BS 750 repeat steps 711 and 713 until<br>
the data rate of the MS 740 is changed. The periodic uplink resources allocated by<br>
the BS have been decided in step 707.<br>
When the MS 740 is to decrease the data rate in step 715, it transmits data<br>
piggybacked with a Grant Management subheader to the BS 750 in step 717. The<br>
Grant Management subheader contains information indicating a decreased<br>
requested rate. The BS 750 recognizes from the Grant Management subheader<br>
that the MS 740 is to decrease the data rate in step 719 and allocates uplink<br>
resources corresponding to the requested data rate to the MS 740 in step 721. In<br>
step 723, the MS 740 transmits data using the allocated uplink resources. In step<br>
725, the BS 750 allocates the same uplink resources for the next data. If the data<br>
rate is maintained, the MS 740 and the BS 750 repeat steps 723 and 725. The<br>
uplink resources allocated to the MS 740 during these steps have been decided in<br>
step 719.<br>
When the MS 740 is to increase the data rate in step 727, it transmits a<br>
codeword requesting a bandwidth increase data to the BS 750 on the CQICH in<br>
step 729. The BS 750 increases uplink resources so as to support the maximum<br>
rate in step 731 and allocates them to the MS 740 in step 733. In step 735, the MS<br>
740 transmits data using the allocated uplink resources.<br>
As described above, the present invention is directed to a method of<br>
requesting allocation of requested uplink resources to a BS according to a change<br>
in data rate by an MS in uplink resource scheduling for ertPS in a wireless<br>
communication system. For this purpose, the MS, when increasing its data rate,<br>
notifies the BS of the rate increase.<br>
If the MS has no data to transmit and thus transitions to an off period in<br>
ertPS for which the BS periodically allocates resources to the MS, the BS does<br>
not allocate uplink resources to the MS, thereby reducing overhead from resource<br>
allocation. Therefore, the extra uplink resources which might otherwise be<br>
allocated to the MS in the off period can be efficiently used for other purposes.<br><br>
