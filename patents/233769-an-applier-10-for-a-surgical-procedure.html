Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to appliers for surgical devices and<br>
to methods for surgically modifying organs and vessels. More particularly, it relates<br>
to appliers for anastomosis devices for joining two organs such as, for example, two<br>
separate lengths of small bowel to each other, a section of small bowel to the<br>
stomach, or the common bile duct to tne auoueneum in a procedure cancer a<br>
choledochoduodcnostomy.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Creating an anastomosis, or the surgical formation of a passage between two<br>
normally distinct vessels, is a critical step of many surgical procedures. This is<br>
particularly true of gastric bypass procedures in which two portions of small<br>
intestine are joined together and another portion of small intestine is joined to the<br>
stomach of the patient. This is also true of surgery to alleviate blockage in the<br>
common bile duct by draining bile from the duct to the small intestine during surgery<br>
for pancreatic cancer.<br>
For many anastomosis, surgeons use circular staplers, linear staplers, or<br>
manual sutures. However, to reduce incision size and to make the surgical process<br>
less technically demanding and time consuming, an expandable medical device that<br>
deforms to hold tissue portions together when the device is ejected from a<br>
constraining enclosure has been described. United States. Application 2003/0120292<br><br>
to Adrian Park et al, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, describes<br>
such a device.<br>
The expandable medical device disclosed in 2003/0120292 is constrained by<br>
a sheath to an advantageous small-diameter tubular shape. A surgeon applies the<br>
expandable medical device by maneuvering the sheath through the tissue portions<br>
requiring anastomosis, moving a nose piece distally away from the sheath, and<br>
ejecting the device from the applier. Ejecting the device removes the constraint on<br>
the device, allowing the device to assume a ring shape. The larger ends of the ring<br>
shape hold the two tissue portions together in an effective anastomosis.<br>
A device such as that disclosed in 2003/0120292 may be made from a<br>
material such as superelastic nitinol. Devices made of superelastic nitinol can<br>
deform a great extent without yielding. When external forces tending to deform<br>
such devices arc released, the devices return to their original geometry.<br>
Applying an expandable medical device with the applier of 2003/0120292<br>
requires two actions: separating the nosepiecc and the sheath; and urging the<br>
expandable medical device distally relative to the sheath. Applicants have<br>
recognized the need for an applier that can operate with one control by the surgeon<br>
so that the surgeon controls one action while the applier performs the other action<br>
automatically at the proper time. Applicants have further recognized the need for an<br>
applier with a means to urge the device distally when the sheath is retracted, and a<br>
method for using the applier, so that the user needs only to use one control to<br>
activate the applier. More particularly, applicants have recognized the need for an<br>
instrument with a force element to urge the device distally when the sheath is<br>
retracted. This invention provides such an applier and a method for using it.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided an applier for a<br>
surgical device and method that provides automated ejection of the device and gives<br>
the surgeon use of the applier with one operative control. The applier includes a<br>
handle, a tube movable relative to the handle, and an ejector shaft driven by a force<br>
element for ejecting the device. It may include a cap called a bullet nose or probe<br>
tip. The cap may have a tapered distal surface to ease entry into small otomies in<br><br>
tissue. Using a button or knob to move the tube automatically triggers the ejector<br>
shaft to eject the device when the tube is in the correct position.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of an applier 10 used to eject an expandable<br>
medical device 44 (Figure 2). Components of applier 10 visible in Figure 1 from the<br>
exterior include a frame, or handle 12, an actuator button 14, a device retainer, or<br>
tube 16, and a cap, called probe tip 18, at the distal end of tube 16.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 1, handle 12 comprises two handle halves.<br>
Handle 12 may be molded from engineering plastic and may be split into two halves<br>
to ease the assembly process of applier 10. The handle halves may be held together<br>
by a snap fit or by, for example, fasteners such as screws.<br>
Tube 16 has a proximal portion located within handle 12, a distal portion<br>
extending from handle 12, and a longitudinal axis 13. Tube 16 can translate relative<br>
to handle 12 and rotate relative to handle 12 about longitudinal axis 13 of tube 16.<br>
Tube 16 may be made from metal or engineering plastic. At least a portion of tube<br>
16 may be transparent or translucent to allow passage of light, either to utilize a light<br>
source internal to tube 16 to illuminate a surgical site, or to allow better visualization<br>
of internal components.<br>
Actuator button 14 attaches to tube 16 by a press fit within a slot on tube 16,<br>
fasteners, or other commonly used attachment means. A surgeon uses actuator<br>
button 14 to translate tube 16 proximally towards handle 12 and to rotate tube 16<br>
iabout longitudinal axis 13 of tube 16 as will be seen. Actuator button 14 can be<br>
made from engineering plastic and designed to deflect or flex. The deflection<br>
enables actuator button 14 to rock slightly proximally to distally about an axis<br>
perpendicular to longitudinal axis 13 of tube 16.<br>
Probe tip 18 is fixed relative to handle 12. The distal end of probe tip 18<br>
may be tapered as shown in Figure 1, or rounded, or have several shapes to facilitate<br>
entry through an opening in tissue or to assist in dilating tissue. The proximal end of<br>
probe tip 18 may also be chamfered, tapered, or rounded to help in operation of<br>
applier 10 as will be seen.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows applier 10 of Figure 1 with portions removed for better<br>
visualization of components. Actuator button 14 is shown exploded away from<br>
applier 10 to reveal a roughly "Z"-shaped slot 20 in handle 12. Slot 20 contains a<br>
flaring portion 24 of slot 20. Slot 20 also contains an actuation portion 26, reachable<br>
by actuator button 14 by rotation about longitudinal axis 13 of tube 16. Handle 12<br>
also possesses, revealed under exploded actuator button 14, a lock stop 22 and a<br>
rotation stop 23 at a distal end. Lock stop 22 and rotation stop 23 abut a boss raised<br>
on actuator button 14 when actuator button 14 is in a locked position.<br>
Figure 2 further shows a probe tip shaft 28. Probe tip shaft 28 extends from<br>
supports within handle 12 distaily to fix to probe tip 18, locating probe tip 18<br>
relative to handle 12. Probe tip shaft 28 may attach to probe tip 18 by a threaded<br>
assembly. Handle 12 also contains the proximal portion of a pusher rod to eject<br>
expandable medical device 44, called ejector shaft 30. Ejector shaft 30 locates<br>
concentrically within tube 16. and extends distaily from handle 12 to a point<br>
proximal of probe tip 18. Probe tip shaft 28 locates within the inner diameter of<br>
ejector shaft 30. At the proximal end of ejector shaft 30, ejector flange 32 flairs<br>
radially to a diameter larger than that of ejector shaft 30. Ejector flange 32 may<br>
consist of a washer pressed on a turned-down diameter of ejector shaft 30 and<br>
retained by a second washer, as shown in Figure 2. Alternately, flaring a proximal<br>
end of ejector shaft 30 in a formed or molded part may form ejector flange 32.<br>
Shown distal of ejector shaft 30 in Figure 2 is a constraining member to<br>
prevent forward movement of ejector shaft 30, called stop latch 34. Stop latch 34<br>
pins to handle 12 and rotates about the pinned junction. Stop latch 34 has a stop end<br>
36 movable away and towards ejector flange 32. Stop latch 34 further has a cam<br>
surface 38. The proximal end of tube 16 contacts stop latch 34 along cam surface 38<br>
to rotate stop latch 34.<br>
Figure 2 further shows a force element in the form of ejector spring 40<br>
compressed between a wall on handle 12 and a proximal side of ejector flange 32.<br>
Ejector spring 40 urges ejector shaft 30 distaily. A second force element, latch<br>
spring 42, applies a force to rotate stop latch 34 so that stop end 36 bears against the<br>
distal side of ejector flange 32. In the embodiment shown, latch spring 42 is a leaf<br>
spring between a wall of handle 12 and stop latch 34. Latch spring 42 could also be,<br><br>
for example, a torsion spring having a torsional axis along the axis of rotation of stop<br>
latch 34.<br>
Expandable medical device 44 locates near the distal end of applier 10<br>
between the distal end of ejector shaft 30 and probe tip 18. Expandable medical<br>
device 44 may be, for example, an expandable medical device such as that described<br>
in United States Application number 2003/0120292. Such an expandable medical<br>
device will normally assume a ring-shaped appearance, but force applied by tube 16<br>
will force the expandable medical device to assume a cylindrical shape.<br>
Figure 3 depicts a cross-section view of applier 10 of Figure 1. showing<br>
applier 10 containing expandable medical device 44. A surgeon uses applier 10 of<br>
Figure 1 to eject expandable medical device 44 to perform a surgical procedure, such<br>
as, for example, anastomosis of two body lumens. A surgeon grasps applier 10 and<br>
places it into a patient's body. The surgeon maneuvers applier 10 to a portion of the<br>
body near organs needing surgical treatment such as an anastomosis. The surgeon<br>
may, for example, first divide a section of small intestine as a part of a medical<br>
procedure such as a gastric bypass operation or as part of an operation to remove a<br>
section of intestine for cancer. The surgeon creates an otomy in a section of small<br>
intestine and extends applier 10 through the section of small intestine to a position<br>
where another otomy is desired. The surgeon then makes a second otomy in the wall<br>
of the same section of small intestine and a third otomy in another section of<br>
intestine to be anastomosed. Applier 10 can then extend through the second and<br>
third otomies in the two sections of small intestine. The walls carrying the second<br>
and third otomies can be shown as proximal tissue portion 46 and distal tissue<br>
portion 48. Attaching these two tissue portions creates an intestinal anastomosis<br>
when the tissue portions are lumens of intestine. After extending applier 10 through<br>
proximal tissue portion 46 and distal tissue portion 48, a surgeon can operate applier<br>
10 to effect a medical procedure such as an anastomosis.<br>
Applier 10 may be in a locked position. Such a locked position may be<br>
achieved by having actuator button 14 rotated slightly into the shorter section, or<br>
flaring portion 24 of Z-Shaped slot 20 (Figure 2), and leaving -actuator button 14 in<br>
the undeflected position. Actuator button 14, in an undeflected position, tilts distally<br>
slightly so that a boss raised on actuator button 14 contacts lock stop 22 and rotation<br>
stop 23. In the locked position, linear movement of actuator button 14 is precluded<br><br>
by lock stop 22 and rotational movement of actuator button 14 about the axis of tube<br>
16 is precluded rotation stop 23. Slight pressure tilting actuator button 14 moves<br>
the boss away from lock stop 22 to permit movement of actuator button 14. This<br>
tilting or rocking motion is about an axis perpendicular to longitudinal axis 13 of<br>
tube 16.<br>
By urging actuator button 14 proximally, the surgeon begins to move tube 16<br>
proximally towards stop latch 34. Initially, stop latch 34 is in a first position abutting<br>
ejector flange 32 of ejector shaft 30 to prevent distal movement of ejector shaft 30.<br>
A proximal portion of proximally moving tube 16 contacts cam surface 38 of stop<br>
latch 34 and begins to rotate stop latch 34 about the pivot point of stop latch 34.<br>
Latch spring 42 deflects while still applying a slight force tending to oppose the<br>
rotation of stop latch 34. Stop end 36 of stop latch 34 rotates away from ejector<br>
flange 32 to a second position permitting ejector spring 40 to move ejector shaft 30<br>
distally. Ejector shaft 30 moves distally until ejector flange 32 reaches a boss within<br>
handle 12 that prevents further distal movement. Ejector shaft 30 drives expandable<br>
medical device 44 distally past the distal end of tube 16 to create the configuration<br>
shown in Figure 4. Expandable medical device 44 and ejector shaft 30 have moved<br>
relative to tube 16 a predetermined distance designed to best facilitate use of<br>
expandable medical device 44.<br>
Actuator button 14 still remains in flaring portion 24 of slot 20, better<br>
depicted in Figure 2. Slight rotation of actuator button 14 about longitudinal axis 13<br>
of tube 16 moves actuator button into the longer section, or actuation portion 26 of<br>
Z-shaped slot 20 (Figure 2). The rotation of actuator button 14 rotates rube 16 about<br>
longitudinal axis 13 of tube 16, and moves actuator button 14 away from a position<br>
distal to lock stop 22. Applier 10 then becomes ready to eject expandable medical<br>
device 44.<br>
Figure 4 shows a partially ejected expandable medical device 44. Moving<br>
tube 16 proximally exposes a gap between tube 16 and probe' tip 18. Expandable<br>
medical device 44, driven by ejector shaft 30, has moved towards probe tip 18. The<br>
tapered proximal end of probe tip 18 helps to flair expandable medical device 44<br>
outwardly through the gap. The surgeon may move actuator button 14 slightly<br>
distally, moving tube 16 slightly distally against expandable medical device 44 to<br>
retain it in position. The surgeon may use applier 10 with the flared expandable<br><br>
medical device 44 as a tool to manipulate tissue. The surgeon may pull distal tissue<br>
portion 48 towards proximal tissue portion 46 using expandable medical device 44.<br>
Figure 5 shows completely ejected expandable medical device 44. To eject<br>
expandable medical device 44, the surgeon moves actuator button 14 proximally,<br>
moving tube 16 proximally to release the proximal portion of expandable medical<br>
device 44. The distal end of ejector shaft 30 then becomes a restraint element to<br>
restrain proximal movement of expandable medical device 44 as tube 16 moves past<br>
expandable medical device 44. The embodiment of expandable medical device 44<br>
shown in Figure 5 will expand, assume a ring shape, and force distal tissue portion<br>
48 to proximal tissue portion 46 after the proximal portion of expandable medical<br>
device 44 is released from the confines of tube 16. In the embodiment of<br>
expandable medical device 44 shown in Figure 5, the inner diameter of expandable<br>
medical device 44 after application is larger than the outer diameter of probe tip 18.<br>
The application of expandable medical device 44 is now complete. Because<br>
ejector spring 40 moves ejector shaft 30 distally, the surgeon needed only to move<br>
actuator button 14 proximally to eject expandable medical device 44. A second<br>
control to move ejector shaft 30 distally is not needed because proximal motion of<br>
tube 16 triggers, through stop latch 34, an automatic ejection of expandable medical<br>
device 44 by force applied by ejector spring 40.<br>
It will be recognized that equivalent structures may be substituted for the<br>
structures illustrated and described herein and that the described embodiment of the<br>
invention is not the only structure that may be employed to implement the claimed<br>
invention. One example of an equivalent structure that may be used to implement<br>
the present invention is shown in Figure 6. In the embodiment of Figure 6, "U"-<br>
shaped deflection beam 60 replaces stop latch 34 and latch spring 42. Deflection<br>
beam 60 is deflectable and has a restrainer stop 62 at a proximal end. Deflection<br>
beam 60 also has a restrainer cam surface 64.<br>
Figure 6 further depicts a knob 66 attached to tube 16. Additionally, Figure 6<br>
displays an o-ring 68 on knob 66 and a series of o-ring grooves 70 on handle 12.<br>
useful for tactile feedback as will be discussed.<br>
When expandable medical device 44 is loaded into the applier 10 of Figure 6,<br>
ejector shaft 30 is held in the most proximal position by restrainer stop 62. As in the<br>
previous embodiment, ejector spring 40 applies a force urging ejector shaft 30<br><br>
distally. Deflection beam 60. in a first, undeflected position, holds ejector shaft 30<br>
from distal movement. Movement of tube 16 causes a proximal surface of tube 16<br>
to contact restrainer cam surface 64, deflecting deflection beam 60 towards<br>
longitudinal axis 13 of tube 16 as shown in phantom in Figure 6. The deflection<br>
drives restrainer stop 62 to a second position, inwardly towards longitudinal axis 13<br>
and away from the purchase that restrainer stop 62 has on ejector shaft 30. When<br>
ejector shaft 30 becomes released and no longer held by restrainer stop 62, ejector<br>
spring 40 moves ejector shaft 30 distally as in the previous embodiment.<br>
A surgeon moves tube 16 proximally in the embodiment of Figure 6 by<br>
grasping knob 66. O-ring 68 moves through the series of o-ring grooves 70 to cause<br>
tactile feedback to the surgeon. O-ring 68 can cause tube- 16 to detent at an<br>
advantageous position such as the position tube 16 is in at the point when deflection<br>
beam 60 releases ejector shaft 30.<br>
As a further example of equivalent structures that may be anticipated, tube 16<br>
and components contained within tube 16 may become long and flexible to<br>
maneuver through a long lumen such as a section of small; bowel to effect an<br>
anastomosis through a long, flexible lumen. Such a long, flexible tube may be used<br>
laproscopically or endoscopically.<br>
As a further example of an equivalent structure, applier 10 could have a long,<br>
rigid, curved tube, or a long, rigid, straight tube, and applied 10 could be placed<br>
through an obturator port and used laprocoopioally or andocoopioally. Length and<br>
curvature become advantageous in endoscopic or laproscopic surgery, especially<br>
when performing a surgical procedure on a bariatric patient. In either a rigid or a<br>
flexible form of an applier 10, restriction of gas flow through the instrument<br>
becomes advantageous when maintenance of a pneumoperiteneum is desired. Such<br>
restriction may be accomplished by, for example, a seal or flow restrictor.<br>
As a further example of an equivalent structure and method that may be used<br>
to implement the present invention, applier 10 may have a geometry small enough to<br>
be conveniently placed through the opening of a hand port used for hand-assisted<br>
laproscopic surgery, such as, for example, the Lap-Disk® hand, port sold by Ethicon<br>
Endo-Surgery in Cincinnati, Ohio. A surgeon using applier 10 through a hand port<br>
may use an endoscope through a secondary port for visualization, and may also<br>
maintain a pneumoperiteneum. The surgeon may also make use of trocars, graspers.<br><br>
cutters and other endoscopic instruments inserted through auxiliary pons to assist in<br>
grasping lumens or creating otomies in lumens to perform surgical procedures.<br>
As a further example of an equivalent structure and method that may be used<br>
to; implement the present invention, a long, rigid version of applier 10, or a long,<br>
flexible embodiment of applier 10 may be used through an auxiliary port while<br>
tissue is manipulated by the surgeon using a hand placed through aihand port.<br>
It is also conceivable that the desired result of triggering an ejection of<br>
expandable medical device 44 simply by moving a device retainer could be achieved<br>
by other means. Applier 10 may also, instead of a compression spring shown as<br>
ejector spring 40 as a force element, use an extension spring attached between<br>
handle 12 and ejector shaft 30. Springs may be replaced by other means. Such<br>
means may include a small motor set to start driving the expandable medical device<br>
44 to an ejected position when a moving device retainer trips a switch. Other means<br>
of achieving the same result will occur to those skilled in the art.<br>
As another example of an equivalent structure, probe tip 18 and probe tip<br>
shaft 28 could have open distal and proximal ends and a: lumen extending<br>
therethrough, so that a guidewire, fiber optic, or other useful surgical instrument may<br>
be placed through applier 10.<br>
An embodiment of applier 10 may be attached to and utilized with computer-<br>
controlled robotic equipment. The robotic equipment enables a surgeon distant from<br>
the surgery site to use applier 10 to perform a procedure.<br>
As other examples of equivalent structures, the surface of the distal taper on<br>
probe tip 18 may take many forms advantageous for various types of tissue<br>
manipulation, as illustrated in Figures 7A through 7F. Figure 7A represents a<br>
conical tipped nose that is blunted for low tissue trauma and for good visibility past<br>
the distal end. Figure 7B depicts a nose that is fluted to allow torque to be applied to<br>
tissue. Figure 7B depicts four flutes, although three or any other number of flutes<br>
may suffice. Figure 7C depicts a nose having a convex curve for rapid dilation of<br>
an otomy in a short space, while Figure 7D shows a nose having a concave surface<br>
for gentle dilation of friable tissue. An offset swept nose, shown in Figure 7E, may<br>
be used because of its asymmetry for better visibility to one side and may be used to<br>
assist in manipulation by using its asymmetry to minimally grasp tissue. Figure 7F<br>
shows a spherical nose to produce a short length for operation in limited space and to<br><br>
reduce the chance of tissue trauma. Combinations of these surfaces may also be<br>
advantageous, for example, a nose having a concave surface as depicted in Figure<br>
7D may also posses flutes as depicted in Figure 7B. Probe tip 18 may possess a<br>
knife or a piercing element to create an otomy. Other combinations of shapes may<br>
occur to one skilled in the art.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and<br>
described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments<br>
are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and<br>
substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the<br>
invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit<br>
and scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
An applier (10) For a surgical procedure, said applier comprising:<br>
a. a tube (16), being slidably movable proximally, having a distal<br>
end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis therebetween;<br>
b. a pusher rod (30) having distal and proximal ends, said<br>
pusher rod slidably disposed within said tube; and<br>
c. an expandable medical device (44) having distal and proximal<br>
ends disposed within said distal end of said tube distal to said<br>
pusher rod;<br>
characterized in that:<br>
a means is provided for moving said pusher rod distally a<br>
predetermined distance upon moving said tube proximally so as<br>
to deploy said distal end of said device.</td>
