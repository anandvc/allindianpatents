				<td>METHOD FOR REDUCTION OF ALIASING INTRODUCED BY SPECTRAL<br>
ENVELOPE ADJUSTMENT IN REAL-VALUED FILTERBANKS.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to systems comprising spectral<br>
envelope adjustment of audio signals using a real-valued sub-<br>
band filterbank. It reduces the aliasing introduced when using<br>
a real-valued subband filterbank for spectral envelope adjust-<br>
ment. It also enables an accurate energy calculation for sinu-<br>
soidal components in a real-valued subband filterbank.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been shown in PCT/SE02/00626 "Aliasing reduction using<br>
complex exponential modulated filterbanks", that a complex-<br>
exponential modulated filterbank is an excellent tool for<br>
spectral envelope adjustment audio signals. In such a procedure<br>
the spectral envelope of the signal is represented by energy-values<br>
corresponding to certain filterbank channels. By<br>
estimating the current energy in those channels, the corresponding<br>
subband samples can be modified to have the desired<br>
energy, and hence the spectral envelope is adjusted. If restraints<br>
on computational complexity prevents the usage of a<br>
complex exponential modulated filterbank, and only allows for<br>
a cosine modulated (real-valued) implementation, severe aliasing<br>
is obtained when the filterbank is used for spectral envelope<br>
adjustment. This is particularly obvious for audio signals<br>
with a strong tonal structure, where the aliasing components<br>
will cause intermodulation with the original spectral<br>
components. The present invention offers a solution to this by<br>
putting restraints on the gain-values as a function of frequency<br>
in a signal dependent manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved<br>
technique for spectral envelope adjustment.<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus or a method for spectral<br>
envelope adjustment of a signal in accordance with claims<br>
1 or 19 or by a computer program in accordance with claim 20.<br>
The present invention relates to the problem of intermodulation<br>
introduced by aliasing in a real-valued filterbank used<br>
for spectral envelope adjustment. The present invention analyses<br>
the input signal and uses the obtained information to restrain<br>
the envelope adjustment capabilities of the filterbank<br>
by grouping gain-values of adjacent channel in an order determined<br>
by the spectral characteristic of the signal at a given<br>
time. For a real-valued filterbank e.g. a pseudo-QMF where<br>
transition bands overlap with closest neighbour only, it can<br>
be shown that due to aliasing cancellation properties the<br>
aliasing is kept below the stop-band level of the prototype<br>
filter. If the prototype filter is designed with a sufficient<br>
aliasing suppression the filterbank is of perfect reconstruction<br>
type from a perceptual point of view, although this is<br>
not the case in a strict mathematical sense. However, if the<br>
channel gain of adjacent channels are altered between analysis<br>
and synthesis, the aliasing cancellation properties are violated,<br>
and aliasing components will appear audible in the output<br>
signal. By performing a low-order linear prediction on the<br>
subband samples of the filterbank channels, it is possible to<br>
asses, by observing the properties of the LPC polynomial,<br>
where in a filterbank channel a strong tonal component is present.<br>
Hence it is possible to assess which adjacent channels<br>
that must not have independent gain-values in order to avoid a<br>
strong aliasing component from the tonal component present in<br>
the channel.<br>
The present invention comprises the following features:<br>
Analysing means of the subband channels to asses where in a<br>
subband channel a strong tonal component is present;<br>
Analysing by means of a low-order linear predictor in every<br>
subband channel;<br>
Gain grouping decision based on the location of the zeros of<br>
the LPC polynomial;<br>
Accurate energy calculation for a real-valued implementation.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The below-described embodiments are merely illustrative for<br>
the principles of the present invention for improvement of a<br>
spectral envelope adjuster based on a real-valued filterbank.<br>
It is understood that modifications and variations of the arrangements<br>
and the details described herein will be apparent<br>
to others skilled in the art. It is the intent, therefore, to<br>
be limited only by the scope of the impending patent claims<br>
and not by the specific details presented by way of description<br>
and explanation of the embodiments herein.<br>
In the following description a real-valued pseudo-QMF is used<br>
comprising a real-valued analysis as well as a real valued<br>
synthesis. It should be understood however, that the aliasing<br>
problem addressed by the present invention also appears for<br>
systems with a complex analysis and a real-valued synthesis,<br>
as well as any other cosine-modulated filterbank apart from<br>
the pseudo-QMF used in this description. The present invention<br>
is applicable for such systems as well. In a pseudo-QMF every<br>
channel essentially only overlaps its adjacent neighbour in<br>
frequency. The frequency-response of the channels is shown in<br>
the subsequent figures by the dashed lines. This is only for<br>
illustrative purposes to indicate the overlapping of the channels,<br>
and should not be interpreted as the actual channel response<br>
given by the prototype filter. In Fig. 1 the frequency<br>
analysis of an original signal is displayed. The figure only<br>
displays the frequency range covered by 15.p/M to 25.p/M of<br>
the M channel filterbank. In the following description the<br>
designated channel numbers are derived from their low crossover<br>
frequency, hence channel 16 covers the frequency range<br>
16.p/M to 17.p/M excluded the overlap with its neighbours. If<br>
no modification is done to the subband samples between analy-<br>
sis and synthesis the aliasing will be limited by the proper-<br>
ties of the prototype filter. If the subband samples for adja-<br>
cent channels are modified according to a gain vector, as dis-<br>
played in Fig.2, with independent gain values for every chan-<br>
nel the aliasing cancellation properties are lost. Hence an<br>
aliasing component will show up in the output signal mirrored<br>
around the cross-over region of the filterbank channels, as<br>
displayed in Fig 3. This is not true for an complex implemen-<br>
tation as outlined in PCT/SE02/00626 where the output, as dis-<br>
played in Fig. 4, would not suffer from disturbing aliasing<br>
components. In order to avoid the aliasing components that<br>
causes severe intermodulation distortion in the output, the<br>
present invention teaches that two adjacent channels that<br>
share a sinusoidal component as e.g. channel 18 and 19 in Fig<br>
1, must be modified similarly, i.e. the gain factor applied to<br>
the two channels must be identical. This is hereafter referred<br>
to as a coupled gain for these channels. This of course im-<br>
plies that the frequency resolution of the envelope adjuster<br>
is sacrificed, in order to reduce the aliasing. However, given<br>
a sufficient number of channels, the loss in frequency resolu-<br>
tion is a small price to pay for the absence of severe inter-<br>
modulation distortion.<br>
In order to assess which channels should have coupled gain-<br>
factors, the present invention teaches the usage of in-band<br>
linear prediction. If a low order linear prediction is used,<br>
e.g. a second order LPC, this frequency analysis tool is able<br>
to resolve one sinusoidal component in every channel. By ob-<br>
serving the sign of the first predictor polynomial coefficient<br>
it is easy to determine if the sinusoidal component is situ-<br>
ated in the upper or lower half of the frequency range of the<br>
subband channel.<br>
A second order prediction polynomial<br><br>
is obtained by linear prediction using the autocorrelation<br>
method or the covariance method for every channel in the QMF<br>
filterbank that will be affected by the spectral envelope ad-<br>
justment. The sign of the QMF-bank channel is defined according<br>
to:<br><br>
where k is the channel number, M is the number of channels, and<br>
where the frequency inversion of every other QMF channel is<br>
taken into account. Hence, it is possible for every channel to<br>
asses where a strong tonal component is situated, and thus<br>
grouping the channels together that share a strong sinusoidal<br>
component. In Fig. 5 the sign of each channel is indicated and<br>
hence in which half of the subband channel the sinusoidal is<br>
situated, where +1 indicates the upper half and -1 indicates<br>
the lower half. The invention teaches that in order to avoid<br>
the aliasing components the subband channel gain factors should<br>
be grouped for the channels where channel k has a negative sign<br>
and channel k-1 has a positive sign. Accordingly the channel<br>
signs as illustrated by Fig. 5 gives the required grouping ac-<br>
cording to Fig. 6, where channel 16 and 17 are grouped, 18 and<br>
19 are grouped, 21 and 22 are grouped, and channel 23 and 24<br>
are grouped. This means that the gain values Sk{m) for the<br>
grouped channels k and k-1 are calculated together, rather than<br>
separately, according to:<br>
where Erefk(m) is the reference energy, and Ek(m)is the estimated<br>
energy, at the point m in time. This ensures that the grouped<br>
channels get the same gain value. Such grouping of the gain<br>
factors preserves the aliasing cancellation properties of the<br>
filterbank and gives the output according to Fig. 7. Here it is<br>
obvious that the aliasing components present in Fig. 3, are<br>
vanished. If there is no strong sinusoidal component, the zeros<br>
will nevertheless be situated in either half of the z-plane,<br>
indicated by the sign of the channel, and the channels will be<br>
grouped accordingly. This means that there is no need for de-<br>
tection based decision making whether there is a strong tonal<br>
component present or not.<br>
In a real-valued filterbank, the energy estimation is not<br>
straightforward as in a complex representation. If the energy<br>
is calculated by summing the squared subband samples of a sin-<br>
gle channel, there is a risk of tracking the time envelope of<br>
the signal rather than the actual energy. This is due to the<br>
fact that a sinusoidal component can have an arbitrary fre-<br>
quency from 0 to the filterbank channel width. If a sinusoidal<br>
component is present in a filterbank channel it can have a<br>
very low relative frequency, albeit being a high frequency si-<br>
nusoidal in the original signal. Assessing the energy of this<br>
signal becomes difficult in a real-valued system since, if the<br>
averaging time is badly chosen with respect to the frequency<br>
of the sinusoidal, a tremolo (amplitude-variation) can be in-<br>
troduced, when in fact the signal energy actually is constant.<br>
The present invention teaches however, that the filterbank<br>
channels should be grouped two-by-two given the location of<br>
the sinusoidal components. This significantly reduces the<br>
tremolo-problem, as will be outlined below.<br>
In a cosine-modulated filterbank the analysis filters hk{n)are<br>
cosine-modulated versions of a symmetric low-pass prototype<br>
filter P0(n)as<br><br>
where M is the number of channels, k = 0, 1, ..., M-l, N is the<br>
prototype filter order and n = 0, 1, ..., N. The symmetry of the<br>
prototype filter is assumed here to be with respect to n = N/2.<br>
The derivations below are similar in case of half sample symme-<br>
try.<br>
Given a sinusoidal input signal x(n) = Acos(?n + ?) with frequency<br>
0=?=p, the subband signal of channel k = I can be computed to<br>
be approximately<br><br>
where P(w) is the real valued discrete time Fourier transform<br>
of the shifted prototype filter P0(n+N/2) . The approximation is<br>
good when P(? +p(k+ 1/2)/M) is small, and this holds in particu-<br>
lar if P(w) is negligible for |w|=p/M, a hypothesis underlying<br>
the discussion which follows. For spectral envelope adjustment,<br>
the averaged energy within a subband k might be calculated as<br><br>
where w{n) is a window of lengthL . Inserting equation (5) in<br>
equation(6) leads to<br><br>
where ?(?) is a phase term which is independent of k and<br>
W(w) is the discrete time Fourier transform of the window. This<br>
energy can be highly fluctuating if ? is close to an integer<br>
multiple of p/M , although the input signal is a stationary<br>
sinusoid. Artifacts of tremolo type will appear in a system<br>
based on such single real analysis bank channel energy esti-<br>
mates .<br>
On the other hand, assuming that p(k-1/2)/M =?=p{k +1/2)/M and<br>
that P(w) is negligible for |w|=p/M , only the subband channels<br>
k and k-1 have nonzero outputs, and these channels will be<br>
grouped together as proposed by the present invention. The en-<br>
ergy estimate based on these two channels is<br><br>
where<br><br>
For most useful designs of prototype filters, it holds that<br>
S(?) is approximately constant in the frequency range given<br>
above. Furthermore, if the window w{n) has a low-pass filter<br>
character, then |e(?)| is much smaller than |W(0)|, so the fluc-<br>
tuation of the energy estimate of equation (8) is signifi-<br>
cantly reduced compared to that of equation (7).<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates an inventive apparatus for spectral enve-<br>
lope adjustment of a signal. The inventive apparatus includes<br>
a means 80 for providing a plurality of subband signals. It is<br>
to be noted that a subband signal has associated therewith a<br>
channel number k indicating a frequency range covered by the<br>
subband signal. The subband signal originates from a channel<br>
filter having the channel number k in an analysis filterbank.<br>
The analysis filterbank has a plurality of channel filters,<br>
wherein the channel filter having the channel number k has a<br>
certain channel response which is overlapped with a channel<br>
response of an adjacent channel filter having a lower channel<br>
number k-1. The overlapping takes place in a certain overlap-<br>
ping range. As to the overlapping ranges, reference is made to<br>
figures 1, 3, 4, and 7 showing overlapping impulse responses<br>
in dashed lines of adjacent channel filters of an analysis<br>
filterbank.<br>
The subband signals output by the means 80 from Fig. 8 are in-<br>
put into a means 82 for examining the subband signals as to<br>
aliasing generating signal components. In particular, the<br>
means 82 is operative to examine the subband signal having as-<br>
sociated therewith the channel number k and to examine an ad-<br>
jacent subband signal having associated therewith the channel<br>
number k-1. This is to determine whether the subband signal<br>
and the adjacent subband signal have aliasing generating sig-<br>
nal components in the overlapping range such as a sinusoidal<br>
component as illustrated for example in Fig. 1. It is to be<br>
noted here that the sinusoidal signal component for example in<br>
the subband signal having associated therewith channel number<br>
15 is not positioned in the overlapping range. The same is<br>
true for the sinusoidal signal component in the subband signal<br>
having associated therewith the channel number 20. Regarding<br>
the other sinusoidal components shown in Fig. 1, it becomes<br>
clear that those are in overlapping ranges of corresponding<br>
adjacent subband signals.<br>
The means 82 for examining is operative to identify two adja-<br>
cent subband signals, which have an aliasing generating signal<br>
component in the overlapping range. The means 82 is coupled to<br>
a means 84 for calculating gain adjustment values for adjacent<br>
subband signals. In particular, the means 84 is operative to<br>
calculate the first gain adjustment value and a second gain<br>
adjustment value for the subband signal on the one hand and<br>
the adjacent subband signal on the other hand. The calculation<br>
is performed in response to a positive result of the means for<br>
examining. In particular, the means for calculating is opera-<br>
tive to determine the first gain adjustment value and the sec-<br>
ond gain adjustment value not independent on each other but<br>
dependent on each other.<br>
The means 84 outputs a first gain adjustment value and a sec-<br>
ond gain adjustment value. It is to be noted at this point<br>
that, preferably, the first gain adjustment value and the sec-<br>
ond gain adjustment value are equal to each other in a pre-<br>
ferred embodiment. In the case of modifying gain adjustment<br>
values, which have been calculated for example in a spectral<br>
band replication encoder, the modified gain adjustment values<br>
corresponding to the original SBR gain adjustment values are<br>
both smaller than the higher value of the original values and<br>
higher than the lower value of the original values as will be<br>
outlined later on.<br>
The means 84 for calculating gain adjustment values therefore<br>
calculates two gain adjustment values for the adjacent subband<br>
signals. These gain adjustment values and the subband signals<br>
themselves are supplied to a means 8 6 for gain adjusting the<br>
adjacent subband signals using the calculated gain adjustment,<br>
values. Preferably, the gain adjustment performed by the means<br>
86 is performed by a multiplication of subband samples by the<br>
gain adjustment values so that the gain adjustment values are<br>
gain adjustment factors. In other words, the gain adjustment<br>
of a subband signal having several subband samples is per-<br>
formed by multiplying each subband sample from a subband by<br>
the gain adjustment factor, which has been calculated for the<br>
respective subband. Therefore, the fine structure of the sub-<br>
band signal is not touched by the gain adjustment. In other<br>
words, the relative amplitude values of the subband samples<br>
are maintained, while the absolute amplitude values of the<br>
subband samples are changed by multiplying these samples by<br>
the gain adjustment value associated with the respective sub-<br>
band signal.<br>
At the output of means 86, gain-adjusted subband signals are<br>
obtained. When these gain-adjusted subband signals are input<br>
into a synthesis filterbank, which is preferably a real-valued<br>
synthesis filterbank, the output of the synthesis filterbank,<br>
i.e., the synthesized output signal does not show significant<br>
aliasing components as has been described above with respect<br>
to Fig. 7.<br>
It is to be noted here that a complete cancellation of alias-<br>
ing components can be obtained, when the gain values of the<br>
adjacent subband signals are made equal to each other. Never-<br>
theless, at least a reduction of aliasing components can be<br>
obtained when the gain adjustment values for the adjacent sub-<br>
band signals are calculated dependent on each other. This<br>
means that an improvement of the aliasing situation is already<br>
obtained, when the gain adjustment values are not totally<br>
equal to each other but are closer to each other compared to<br>
the case, in which no inventive steps have been taken.<br>
Normally, the present invention is used in connection with<br>
spectral band replication (SBR) or high frequency reconstruc-<br>
tion (HFR), which is described in detail in WO 98/57436 A2 .<br>
As it is known in the art, spectral envelope replication or<br>
high frequency reconstruction includes certain steps at the<br>
encoder-side as well as certain steps at the decoder-side.<br>
In the encoder, an original signal having a full bandwidth is<br>
encoded by a source encoder. The source-encoder produces an<br>
output signal, i.e., an encoded version of the original sig-<br>
nal, in which one or more frequency bands that were included<br>
in the original signal are not included any more in the en-<br>
coded version of the original signal. Normally, the encoded<br>
version of the original signal only includes a low band of the<br>
original bandwidth. The high band of the original bandwidth of<br>
the original signal is not included in the encoded version of<br>
the original signal. At the encoder-side, there is, in addi-<br>
tion, a spectral envelope analyser for analysing the spectral<br>
envelope of the original signal in the bands, which are miss-<br>
ing in the encoded version of the original signal. This miss-<br>
ing band(s) is, for example, the high band. The spectral enve-<br>
lope analyser is operative to produce a coarse envelope repre-<br>
sentation of the band, which is missing in the encoded version<br>
of the original signal. This coarse spectral envelope repre-<br>
sentation can be generated in several ways. One way is to pass<br>
the respective frequency portion of the original signal<br>
through an analysis filterbank so that respective subband sig-<br>
nals for respective channels in the corresponding frequency<br>
range are obtained and to calculate the energy of each subband<br>
so that these energy values are the coarse spectral envelope<br>
representation.<br>
Another possibility is to conduct a Fourier analysis of the<br>
missing band and to calculate the energy of the missing fre-<br>
quency band by calculating an average energy of the spectral<br>
coefficients in a group such as a critical band, when audio<br>
signals are considered, using a grouping in accordance with<br>
the well-known Bark scale.<br>
In this case, the coarse spectral envelope representation con-<br>
sists of certain reference energy values, wherein one refer-<br>
ence energy value is associated with a certain frequency band.<br>
The SBR encoder now multiplexes this coarse spectral envelope<br>
representation with the encoded version of the original signal<br>
to form an output signal, which is transmitted to a receiver<br>
or an SBR-ready decoder.<br>
The SBR-ready decoder is, as it is known in the art, operative<br>
to regenerate the missing frequency band by using a certain or<br>
all frequency bands obtained by decoding the encoded version<br>
of the original signal to obtain a decoded version of the<br>
original signal. Naturally, the decoded version of the origi-<br>
nal signal also does not include the missing band. This miss-<br>
ing band is now reconstructed using the bands included in the<br>
original signal by spectral band replication. In particular,<br>
one or several bands in the decoded version of the original<br>
signal are selected and copied up to bands, which have to be<br>
reconstructed. Then, the fine structure of the copied up sub-<br>
band signals or frequency/spectral coefficients are adjusted<br>
using gain adjustment values, which are calculated using the<br>
actual energy of the subband signal, which has been copied up<br>
on the one hand, and using the reference energy which is ex-<br>
tracted from the coarse spectral envelope representation,<br>
which has been transmitted from the encoder to the decoder.<br>
Normally, the gain adjustment factor is calculated by deter-<br>
mining the quotient between the reference energy and the ac-<br>
tual energy and by taking the square root of this value.<br>
This is the situation, which has been described before with<br>
respect to Fig. 2. In particular, Fig. 2 shows such gain ad-<br>
justment values which have, for example, been determined by a<br>
gain adjustment block in a high frequency reconstruction or<br>
SBR-ready decoder.<br>
The inventive device illustrated in Fig. 8 can be used for<br>
completely replacing a normal SBR-gain adjustment device or<br>
can be used for enhancing a prior art gain-adjustment device.<br>
In the first possibility, the gain-adjustment values are de-<br>
termined for adjacent subband signals dependent on each other<br>
in case the adjacent subband signals have an aliasing problem.<br>
This means that, in the overlapping filter responses of the<br>
filters from which the adjacent subband signals originate,<br>
there were aliasing-generating signal components such as a to-<br>
nal signal component as has been discussed in connection with<br>
Fig. 1. In this case, the gain adjustment values are calcu-<br>
lated by means of the reference energies transmitted from the<br>
SBR-ready encoder and by means of an estimation for the energy<br>
of the copied-up subband signals, and in response to the means<br>
for examining the subband signals as to aliasing generating<br>
signal components.<br>
In the other case, in which the inventive device is used for<br>
enhancing the operability of an existing SBR-ready decoder,<br>
the means for calculating gain adjustment values for adjacent<br>
subband signals can be implemented such that it retrieves the<br>
gain adjustment values of two adjacent subband signals, which<br>
have an aliasing problem. Since a typical SBR-ready encoder<br>
does not pay any attention to aliasing problems, these gain<br>
adjustment values for these two adjacent subband signals are<br>
independent on each other. The inventive means for calculating<br>
the gain adjustment values is operative to derive calculated<br>
gain adjustment values for the adjacent subband signals based<br>
on the two retrieved "original" gain adjustment values. This<br>
can be done in several ways. The first way is to make the sec-<br>
ond gain adjustment value equal to the first gain adjustment<br>
value. The other possibility is to make the first gain adjust-<br>
ment value equal to the second gain adjustment value. The<br>
third possibility is to calculate the average of both original<br>
 gain adjustment values and to use this average as the first<br>
calculated gain adjustment value and the second calculated en-<br>
velope adjustment value. Another opportunity would be to se-<br>
lect different or equal first and second calculated gain ad-<br>
justment values, which are both lower than the higher original<br>
gain adjustment value and which are both higher than the lower<br>
gain adjustment value of the two original gain adjustment val-<br>
ues. When Fig. 2 and Fig. 6 are compared, it becomes clear<br>
that the first and the second gain adjustment values for two<br>
adjacent subbands, which have been calculated dependent on<br>
each other, are both higher than the original lower value and<br>
are both smaller than the original higher value.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present inven-<br>
tion, in which the SBR-ready encoder already performs the fea-<br>
tures of providing subband signals (block 8 0 of Fig. 8), exam-<br>
ining the subband signals as to aliasing generating signal<br>
components (block 82 of Fig. 8) and calculating gain adjust-<br>
ment values for adjacent subband signals (block 84) are per-<br>
formed in a SBR-ready encoder, which does not do any gain ad-<br>
justing operations. In this case, the means for calculating,<br>
illustrated by reference sign 84 in Fig. 8, is connected to a<br>
means for outputting the first and the second calculated gain<br>
adjustment value for transmittal to a decoder.<br>
In this case, the decoder will receive an already "aliasing-<br>
reduced" coarse spectral envelope representation together with<br>
preferably an indication that the aliasing-reducing grouping<br>
of adjacent subband signals has already been conducted. Then,<br>
no modifications to a normal SBR-decoder are necessary, since<br>
the gain adjustment values are already in good shape so that<br>
the synthesized signal will show no aliasing distortion.<br><br>
In the following, certain implementations of the means 80 for<br>
providing subband signals are described. In case the present<br>
invention is implemented in a novel encoder, the means for<br>
providing a plurality of subband signals is the analyser for<br>
analysing the missing frequency band, i.e., the frequency band<br>
that is not included in the encoded version of the original<br>
signal.<br>
In case the present invention is implemented in a novel de-<br>
coder, the means for providing a plurality of subband signals<br>
can be an analysis filterbank for analysing the decoded ver-<br>
sion of the original signal combined with an SBR device for<br>
transposing the low band subband signals to high band subband<br>
channels. In case, however, the encoded version of the origi-<br>
nal signal includes quantized and potentially entropy-encoded<br>
subband signals themselves, the means for providing does not<br>
include an analysis filterbank. In this case, the means for<br>
providing is operative to extract entropy-decoded and re-<br>
quantized subband signals from the transmitted signal input to<br>
the decoder. The means for providing is further operative to<br>
transpose such low band extracted subband signals in accor-<br>
dance with any of the known transposition rules to the high<br>
band as it is known in the art of spectral band replication or<br>
high frequency reconstruction.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the cooperation of the analysis filterbank (which<br>
can be situated in the encoder or the decoder) and a synthesis<br>
filterbank 90, which is situated in an SBR-decoder. The syn-<br>
thesis filterbank 90 positioned in the decoder is operative to<br>
receive the gain-adjusted subband signals to synthesize the<br>
high band signal, which is then, after synthesis, combined to<br>
the decoded version of the original signal to obtain a full-<br>
band decoded signal. Alternatively, the real valued synthesis<br>
filterbank can cover the whole original frequency band so that<br>
the low band channels of the synthesis filterbank 90 are sup-<br>
plied with the subband signals representing the decoded ver-<br>
sion of the original signal, while the high band filter chan-<br>
nels are supplied with the gain adjusted subband signals out-<br>
put by means 8 4 from Fig. 8.<br>
As has been outlined earlier, the inventive calculation of<br>
gain adjustment values in dependence from each other allows to<br>
combine a complex analysis filterbank and a real-valued syn-<br>
thesis filterbank or to combine a real-valued analysis filter-<br>
bank and a real-valued synthesis filterbank in particular for<br>
low cost decoder applications.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the means 82 for<br>
examining the subband signals. As has been outlined before<br>
with respect to Fig. 5, the means 82 for examining from Fig. 8<br>
includes a means 100 for determining a low order predictor<br>
polynomial coefficient for a subband signal and an adjacent<br>
subband signal so that coefficients of predictor polynomials<br>
are obtained. Preferably, as has been outlined with respect to<br>
equation (1), the first predictor polynomial coefficient of a<br>
second order prediction polynomial as defined in the equation<br>
(1) is calculated. The means 100 is coupled to means 102 for<br>
determining a sign of a coefficient for the adjacent subband<br>
signals. In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the means 102 for determining is operative<br>
to calculate the equation (2) so that a subband signal and the<br>
adjacent subband signal are obtained. The sign for a subband<br>
signal obtained by means 102 depends, on the one hand, on the<br>
sign of the predictor polynomial coefficient and, on the other<br>
hand, of the channel number or subband number k. The means 102<br>
in Fig. 10 is coupled to a means 104 for analysing the signs<br>
to determine adjacent subband signals having aliasing-<br>
problematic components.<br>
In particular, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the means 104 is operative to determine<br>
subband signals as subband signals having aliasing-generating<br>
signal components, in case the subband signal having the lower<br>
channel number has a positive sign and the subband signal hav-<br>
ing the higher channel number has a negative sign. When Fig. 5<br>
is considered, it becomes clear that this situation arises for<br>
subband signals 16 and 17 so that the subband signals 16 and<br>
17 are determined to be adjacent subband signals having cou-<br>
pled gain adjustment values. The same is true for subband sig-<br>
nals 18 and 19 or subband signals 21 and 22 or subband signals<br>
23 and 24.<br>
It is to be noted here that, alternatively, also another pre-<br>
diction polynomial, i.e., a prediction polynomial of third,<br>
forth or fifth order can be used, and that also another poly-<br>
nomial coefficient can be used for determining the sign such<br>
as the second, third or forth order prediction polynomial co-<br>
efficient. The procedure shown with respect to equations 1 and<br>
2 is, however, preferred since it involves a low calculation<br>
overhead.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a preferred implementation of the means for cal-<br>
culating gain adjustment values for adjacent subband signals<br>
in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present in-<br>
vention. In particular, the means 84 from Fig. 8 includes a<br>
means 110 for providing an indication of a reference energy<br>
for adjacent subbands, a means 112 for calculating estimated<br>
energies for the adjacent subbands and a means 114 for deter-<br>
mining first and second gain adjustment values. Preferably,<br>
the first gain adjustment value gk and the second gain adjust-<br>
ment value gk-1 are equal. Preferably, means 114 is operative<br>
to perform equation (3) as shown above. It is to be noted here<br>
that normally, the indication on the reference energy for ad-<br>
jacent subbands is obtained from an encoded signal output by a<br>
normal SBR encoder. In particular, the reference energies con-<br>
stitute the coarse spectral envelope information as generated<br>
by a normal SBR-ready encoder.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for spectral envelope<br>
adjustment of a signal, using a filterbank where said filter-<br>
bank comprises a real valued analysis part and a real valued<br>
synthesis part or where said filterbank comprises a complex<br>
analysis part and a real valued synthesis part, where a lower,<br>
in frequency, channel and the adjacent higher, in frequency,<br>
channel are modified using the same gain value, if said lower<br>
channel has a positive sign and said higher channel has a nega-<br>
tive sign, so that the relation between the subband samples of<br>
said lower channel and the subband samples of said higher chan-<br>
nel is maintained.<br>
In the above method, preferably, said gain-value is calculated<br>
by using the averaged energy of said adjacent channels.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, the inventive method of spec-<br>
tral envelope adjustment can be implemented in hardware or in<br>
software. The implementation can take place on a digital stor-<br>
age medium such as a disk or a CD having electronically read-<br>
able control signals, which can cooperate with a programmable<br>
computer system so that the inventive method is carried out.<br>
Generally, the present invention, therefore, is a computer<br>
program product having a program code stored on a machine-<br>
readable carrier, for performing the inventive method, when<br>
the computer-program product runs on a computer. In other<br>
words, the invention is, therefore, also a computer program<br>
having a program code for performing the inventive method,<br>
when the computer program runs on a computer.<br>
