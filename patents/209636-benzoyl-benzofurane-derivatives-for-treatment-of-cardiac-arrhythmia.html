NOVEL COMPOT JNDS FOR TREATMENT OF C^^RDIAC A3^T?HYTHMIA.<br>
SV&gt;JTHRSIS. AND METHODS OF USE<br>

Background of the Invention<br>
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a disease aiifecting approximately 2% of the population of the United States (Sanii, M.H. [1991] 1 Clin, Pharmacol 31:1081). Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CHF, tlae prognosis remains poor with a 5-yesar mortality rate higher tiian 50% fi^m the time of diagnosis (McFate Smith, W. [1985] Am. J. Cardiol 55:3A; McKee, P.A., W-P. Castelli, P.M, McNamara, W,B. Kannel [1971] K Engl 1 Med, 285:1441). In patients willi CHF, the rate of survival is lowest in those patients wifh severe depression of left ventricular function and patients who have fi-equent ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with ventricular arrhythmias and ischemic cardiomyopatiiy have an increased risk of sudden death. The presence of ventr].cular tachycardia in patients with severe CHF resiilts in a three-fold increase in sudden death compared to those without tachycardia C-Bigger, J.T., Jr. [1987] Circulation 75(supplIV):28). Because of the high prevalence of suddsn unexpected death in patients with (^HF, there has been a growing interest in the prognostic significance of arrhythmias in these patients.<br>
Several compounds have been used in the management of cardiac anrhythniias in patients with congestive heart failure. Unfortunately, antiarrhyttunic dmg therapy has<br><br>
been disappointing. The efficacy of antiarrhythmic cbiigs markedly decreases as left ventricular function declioies, such that only a small fraction of patients with CHF are responsive to autiairhythxnic therapy. No antiarrhythmic drug has prevrated sudden death in patients with CHF. There is even a question of increased mortality associated with certain antiarrhythmic drugs (the CAST investigators [1989] N, Engl 1 Med, 321:406). Scientists define tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation as being of multiple nature. It now seems clear, and is accepted in the art&gt; that re-entry is the underlying mechanism to mt:&gt;st sustained arrhythmias. Prolonging ventricular repolarization as a means of preventing ventricular arrhythmias has consequently received renewed attention. This pointis to Class-m agents as drugs of choice in the treatment of arrhythmias. A Class-IE agentj as referred to herein, is an agent which is classified as such in the Vaughan-Williams classification of antiarrhythmic drugs. A Class-HI agent exerts its primary antiatihythmic activity by prolonging cardiac action potential dxiration (APD), and thereby<br>
the effective refractory period (ERP), with no  e:Sect on conduction.    These<br>
•<br>
electrophysiological changes, which are brou^t about by blockade of cardiac potassium chamiels, are well known in the art. Because the blockade of cardiac potassium channels is not associated with depression of the contractile function of the heart, Class-HI agents are pjirticularly attractive for use in patients with CHE'. Unfortunately, the existing Class-Hi agaits are limited in their utihty by additional phaima^:ological activities, lack of good oral bioavailability^ or a poor toxicity profile. The only two Class DI agents currently marketed are bretylium (i.v. only) and amiodarone (i.v. and p.o.).<br>
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent having vasodilator properties that may beneiit patients with severe heart failure. Amiodarone has been shown to improve survival of post-myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic high-grade ventricular arrhyifamias, and it proved efficacious in patients resistant to other antianhythmic drugs without impairing left ventricular fimction. Cardioprotective agents and methods which employ amiodarone in synergistic combination with vasodilators and beta blockers have been described for use in patients with coronary iiisufaciency (U.S- Patent No. 5,175,187). Amiodarone has also been described for reducing arrhythmias associated with CHF as used in combination with antihypertensive agents, e.g., (S)-l-[6-ataino-2-<br><br>
[[hydroxy(4-pbenylbutyl)phosplimyl3oxyl]-L-proline (U.S. Patent No. 4,962,095) and zofenopril (U.S. Patent No. 4,931,464). However, amlodarone is a difficult drug to managie because of its numerous side effects, some of wMch are serious.<br>
The most serious long-term toxicity of amxodarone derives from its kinetics of distribanoD and elimination. It is absorbed slowly, ^ith a lew bioavailability and relatively long hiilf-Iife. These characteristics have clinically importioit consequences, including the necessity of giving loading doses, a delay in the achievemejit of full antiarrhythmic effects, and a protracted period of elimination of the drug aftesr its administration has been<br>
discontinued.<br>
Amiodarone also can interact negatively with numerous drugs including aprindiae, digoxin, flecainide, pbenytoin, procainamide, quinidine, and warfarin. It also has pharmacodynamic interactions with catecholamines, diltiazem, propranolol, and quinidine, resulting in alpha- and beta-antagonism, sinus arrest and hypotension, bradycardia and sinus £iirest&gt; and torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardias, respectively. There is also e&gt;ddence that amiodarone depresses vitamin K-dependent clotting factorSj thereby enhant:ing the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.<br>
Numerous adverse effects limit the clinical applicability of amiodarone. Important side eifects can occur including corneal microdeposits, hy{)erthyroidism, hypothyroidism, hepatic dysfunction, puhnonary alveolitis, photosensitivity, dermatitis, bluish discoloration, and peripheral neuropathy.<br>
There is no Class-m agent presently marketed that can be used safely in patients with CHF. The cardiovascular dmg market is the largest in any field of drug research, and<br>
a<br>
an effective and safe Ciass-HI antiarrhythmic agent useful in patients with CHF is expected to be of substantial benefit. Therefore, a drug which could successfully improve the prognosis of CHF patients, but vdth a safety profile much improved over that of amiodarone, would be extremely usefiil and desired.<br><br>
Brief SuTTimarv of the Invention<br>
The subject invention pertains to novel compounds, and compositions comprising the compounds, for the trcatnaent of cardiac arrhythmias. The subject invention further concerns a method of making the novel compounds. The novel compounds are rapidly metabolized analogs of amiodarone&gt; having the distinct and advantageous characteristic of bexQg metabolized to a less Upophihc compound. This results in an improved safety profile. The new compounds can have particular utility for treating life-threatening ventrisular tachyarrhythmias, especially in patients with c^ongestive heart failure (CHF). The product can also provide effective management for ventricular arrhythmias and supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation imd re-entrant tachyarrhythmias invohang accessory patliways.<br>
More specifically, the novel compounds have ihe particular advantage of reducing the numerous side effects observed with the drugs currently available for treatment of<br>
these cardiac arrhythmias.  For example, the compound of choice cuirently used for<br>
•<br>
treating cardiac arrhythmias is amiodarone, which has side effects that can be serious.<br>
Also disclosed are novel synthesis procedures for the production of the novel compounds. One of the novel syntliesis procedures essentially involves acylation of salicylaldehyde followed by cyclization and chain elongation reactions to form methyl-2-b^izcfiiraneacetate. This compound is reacted with p-anisoylchloride involving a Friedel-Craftsi type reaction which can use SnCl4 as a catalyst. Tlie compound resulting from the Friedtil-Crafts reaction is then converted from the acetate to its carboxylic acid form. The methc«ybenzoyl moiety of the compound is also convert
An alternative s&gt;'nthesis procedure, which also uses salicylaldehyde as a starting compound^ involves a cyclization step to form 2-acetylben2ofuran. This compound is then conv«5rted to its thiomorpholide derivative, which can be further converted to 2-<br><br>
benzoiurane acetic acid, which is also formed in the other described synthesis procedure^ The synthesis procedures are identical after formation of 2-benzofurane acetic acid.<br>
The subject invention thus involves the innovative development of a Class-Hi antianhythrnic agent having significantly lower toxicity than any currently available compc'imd useful in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).<br>

Figure 2 shows an alternative synthetic scheme, "vvhere 2-benzofurane acetic acid, compciund 7, can be made fay synthesizing 2-acetylbenzofuran M from salicylaldehyde, follo^^'ed by a chain elongation procedure known as the Willgerodt-Kindler reaction in order to make the thiomorpholide derivative 14 which is then hydrolyzed to compound 7.<br>

Detailed Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The subject invention concerns novel compounds which can produce the desired pharmacological properties of amiodarone but, unlike luniodarone, are susceptibk to biotransformation by plasma and tissue esterases to give a carboxylic acid metabolite. Carboxylic acids can forai water-soluble salts at physiological pH, and therefore can undergo renal ehmination. As a consequence, the novel compounds, cxemphfied herein by compound A, can have shorter elimination half-Ufs, Accordingly, long-term toxicity symptoms (pulmonary fibrosis, corneal microdeposits, t?tc.) decrease.<br>
One novel compound of the subject invention, when Zi and Z2 are iodine in Formula I, has the chemical name methyl 2"[3-(3,5-diiodc&gt;-4-diethylaminoethoxyben2oyl)benzofurane] acetate. Compounds of the invention have the cherrical structure;<br><br><br>

Salts may also be deri\'ed from bases (organic and inorganic), such as alkali metal salts (e.g., magnesium or calcium salts), or organic amine salts, such as morphtoHne, piperidine, dimethylamine, or dietfcylamine salts. In addition, the ring structure moieties of the novel compounds can be dkdvatized by methods and procedures well known by those of ordinary skill in tl:ie art. For example, it would be well known that various R-groups can be attached to the six-membered ring of the benzofijran moiety of the subject cx)mpound, wherein the R groups can :include H, OH, NH^, SH, halides, alkyl, O-aHc/l, a^cyl, 0-acyl, aryl, 0-aiyl groups, substituted amines, and substituted thiols. In a preferred embodiment, R is H and X is 0.<br>
The subject invention encompasses the novel compound A and compositions comprising these compounds. The successful appHcation of the new compounds to the treatment of CHF is evidenced by the evaluation of the liiermodynamic properties of the compound, e.g., measuring its partition coefficient between water and octanol, evaluation<br><br>
of its kinetics of eliminatioii by measuring its stability in buffer and in human plasina» and evaIi:ation of its electrophysiological properties in guinea pig heart preparations. See Examples hereinbelow. More specificaUy, the novel corapounds can be used for treating life-tiareatening ventricular tachyairhythmias, especially in patients with congestive heart failu3'e. This prodxxct can provide effective management of not only ventricular tach&gt;arrhythniias and less severe ventricular arrhythmias, but also atrial fibrillation and reentrant tachyarrhythmias involving accessory pathways. A composition comprising a novel compound having a rapid elimination rate can offer many advantages over the cunently available antiarrhythmic agents such as aim'odarone. These advantages include:<br>
(i)       a shorter onset of action,<br>
(ii)      decreased and more manageable long-term toxicity, and<br>
(ill)     lower potential for drug int^-actions.<br>
In addition, the novel compounds can be included in a composition comprising a second active ingredient The second active ingredient can be useful for concurrent or syneigistic treatment of arrhythmia or for the treatment of an unrelated condition which can be present with or resuU from arrhythmia or CIEF.<br>
The subject compounds have thermodynamic properties similar to those of amiodaronCj as suggested by log P measurements, but provide the advantageous property of being rapidly metabolized in plasma to a water-soluble metabolite. More specifically, the subject compounds are Class-IU agents with electronic^ steric, and thennodynamic proptsrties comparable to those of amiodarone, but with an enzymatically labile ester group advantageously binlt into the structure such that the dmg can be readily hydrolyzed in plasma to a polar, water-soluble metabolite. TMs ^vater-soluble metabolite can be eliminated by the kidneys. This is a definite advantage over axniodarone, which is metabolized primarily in the liver. Under such conditions, the elimination of the novel compound A is increased and results in a more rapid dissociation of the dmg fi-om phosjphoUpid-binding sites. The accumulation of the compoundj which is dependent on the sveady-state tissue concentration of the drug, and theiefore on the dose, then becomes easily reversible. It follows that, upon discontinuation of a drug comprising one of the novel compoiinds, clearance from the body is more rapid. This increased elimination<br><br>
makes antiarrhythmic therapy using the subject compounds or compositions compnsmg the subject compounds easi«' to manage.<br>
Furtbermore, ttie compounds of the invention may be administered in conjunction with other compounds, or compositions thereof. These compounds, and compositions thereof, may include additional compounds known to be useful for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias^ cardioprotective agents, antibiotics, antiviral agents, or thrombolytic agents (e,g-, streptokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, or recombinant tissue plasioinogen activator). The compounds and compositions of the invention can have particular usefiilness for treating life-threatening venlxiciJar tachyarrhythmias, especially in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Post-mj^ocardial infarction patients can also benefit from the administration of the subject compounds and compositions; thus, methods of treating post-myocardial infarction patients lire also provided by the subject invejition. An "individual" includes animals and huraans in need of treatement for anythmias. In a preferred embodiment, the individual is a human.<br>
Cardioprotective agents include vasodilators and beta blockers described for use in patients with coronary insufficiericy (such as those of U.S. Patent No. S^nSjlS? or othe-rs known to the skilled artisan). Other cardioprotective agents include known anti-hypertmsive agents, e^g., (S)-l-[6-atnino-2-[[bydroxy(4-pbenylbutyl)phosphinyl}oxyl]-L-proline (ILS.

The remainder of the syntbdic scheme to the novel compound A is ihsn. essentially identical to Example 1.<br>
1.	Acerulbenzofuran |3. Salicylaldehyde (326/7 g) is introduced into a 3-liter 3-necked round-bottomed flask containing potassium carbonate (415 g) and acerone (500 ml). ChloToacetone (252,6 g) is then added dropwis;es v/hile stilting, over a period of 30 minutes, followed by addition of another portion of ai^etone (500 ml).

Example 3 -Partition Coefficient of Novel Compounds<br>
The thermodynamic properties of the new compound A can be evaluated by measuring its pardtion coefficient, P, between a pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and octanol. The buffer solution and octanol are mutually saturated before the experiment The test compounds can be dissolved in the octanohbuffer mixture at such a concentration that neithcir phase is saturated. The volume ratio between buffer and octanol is adjusted so that tlie concentration of compound in water after equilibrium is measurable. The n:iixture is shiiken for I hour and centrifuged in order to obtain complete separation of the two phas(5S. The concentration of test compound can be measured in the aqueous phase before and after equilibrium^ using a UV detection method. The partition coefBcient can be calculated using the following equation:<br><br>
where P is the partition coefScientj and C^ and C^ are the concentrations of test compounds in octanol and in water, respectively. Since measurements take place only in aqueous buffer&gt; the equation has to be modified to the following, which can be used in this expe:riment: <br>
where Q^ is the initial amount of test compound introduced in the buffer;octanoi mixture, Q^ is the amount of test compound in buffer phase after equilibrium has been reached, and V^, iind V(^ are the volumes of buffer and octanol, respectively.<br><br>

ls4et^bQlism rate in humai\ plasma. The same procedure as above can be used with humen plasma instead of buffer* The rate constant in plasma can be compared to the rate constant in buffer in order to give an ^proximated rale of metabolism by plasma enzymes.<br>
Example 5 - Elftctronfavsiological Properties in Gumea Pig Heart<br>
Antiarrhythmic activity in guinea pig heart prepaj-ations can be tested for the novel comi)ound A by methods and techniques well know3a by those of ordinary skill in the art. Anti;arrhythmic activity in guinea pig heart preparations is accepted in the art as a model for ;mtiarrhythmic activity in humans. Specifically, activity in guinea pig heart preparations is used to show that a compound depresses the spontaneous discharge, slows the s:inus node spontaneous firing rate, prolongs the effective refractory period (ERP), slows the intra-atrial conduction, suppresses atrial premature beats, prolongs the ventricular ERP, and decreases ventricular excitabili.ty. Microelectrode and pacing techniques can be used as are standard in the art. Assays to show such activity can be conducted in the isolated, superfused guinea pig S-A node-right atrial preparation. A ^11 dose-response curve for compound A can be calculated in each preparation in order to denrtonstrate the effects of different doses on S-A node spontaneous rate, atrial action potratial duration (APD) and ERP, and on ventricukir APD and ERP. The EG50 (the effective concentration that produces 50% of the maximum response), as well as the threshold and maximum doses for the compound can be determined from the full dose-response curve-<br><br>
The results of electrophysiological studies carried out in guinea pig isolated hearts using the subject compound, compound A, showed that compound A displays electrophysiological properties classically associated with Class HI antiarrhythmic agents. The results of these studies are shown in Figures 3-5. Compared to the known compound, aimodarone, tiie electrophysical effects of the subject compound show several advantages. For example* on an equimolar basis, the electrophysiological effects of compound A on atrioventricular conduction, intraventricular conductirA and ventricular repolarization times are much greater than those of aKiiod-arone, both in the spontaneously beating heart (see Figures 3A, 3C, and 3D), and in tlie paced heart (see Figures 4A, 4C, and 4D). In addition, the effects of compound A on atrioventricular conduction, intraventricular conduction and ventricular repolarization times can be partially reversed upon discontinuation of the drug, whereas the effects of iuniodarone are not reversed and acmaliy tend to continue to increase even after discontinuation of the drug. Compound A is also able to more selectively increase the time of ventricular repolarization (i,e., prolctng the QT interval) relative to the changes obsen/ed on sinoatrial nodal rate and baseline atrioventricular nodal conduction time, as compared to amiodarone (Figures 3A-.    3D).<br>
Specifically, Figures 3 A-3D show the time-dependent electrophysiological effects of a continuous 90-niinute infusion of compound A (1 jiM, n=3), amiodarone (1 ^M, n=3) and vehicle (control, n=3) on the spontaneously beatmg heart. Changes from baseline vaiues of atrial rate (Figure 3 A), A-V interval (:?igure 3B), QRS interval (Figure 3C) and QT interval (Figure 3D), respectively, are plotted as a fimction of time. Figure 3 A shows thatj compared to control hearts^ compound A and amiodarone caused significant time-dependeat reductions in atrial rate of similar magnitude. In contrast, compound A and amiodarone caused only a small prolongation of the A-V interval (Figiure 3B). The minimal effect of compound A and amiodarone on atrioventricular nodal conduction in spontaneously beating hearts can be at least partly explained by noting that atrial rate modulates the effects of drugs on atrioventricular nodal conduction. That is, concomitant slowing of atrial rate will lessen the depressant effects of drugs on atrioventricular nodal conduction. For example, in paced hearts where atrial rate is kept<br><br>
constsnt, compound A (1 |iM) had a much greater effect on atrioventricular nodal conduction (Figure 4A). Unlike the effects of amiodarone^ the actions of compound A on A-V interval were reversed upon discontinuation of the drug iniusion, hereafter referred to as washout (Figure 3B). In addition, compound A but not amiodarone signifcantly prolonged tlie QRS interval, i.e., slowed intraventricular conduction (Figure 3C). During the 90-minute washout period of compound A, this effect of compound A was completely reversed. Likewise, although compound A and amiodarone significantly incre£.sed the QT interval^ the effect of compound A to prolong tlie time for ventricular repolJJrization was much greater (Figure 3D). Whereas the effect of compound A on repoliirization was partially reversed during washout, Ihe effect of amiodarone was not attenuated during washout. The average baseline valties of atrial rate, A-V interval, QRS interval and QT interval were 204.6±2.4,55.0±4.0,21,2±0.8 and 162,5±2.9, respectively. Data are shown as meaniSEM,<br>
Figures 4A-4D show a series of separate experiments, the time-dependent electi'Ophysiological efifects of a continuous 90-minute iJifusion of compound A (1 pM, n=3): amiodarone (1 jiM, n=3) and vehicle (control, n=3) in guinea pig hearts paced at 200 beats per minute was investigated. Changes from baseline values of S-H interval (Figure 4A), HV interval (Figure 46), QRS interval (Figure 4C) and QT interval (Figure 4D), respectively, are plotted as a function of time. At equimolar concentrations, com]:)ound A d^ressed atrioventricular nodal conduction in paced hearts to a much greater extent than amiodarone (Figure 4A). The prolongation of the S-H interval caused by compound A was gradual and reached a maximum of 18 msec (i.e., a 45% increase above the baseline S-H interval) before the drug infusion was stopped. Upon washout of compound A, a large fraction (» 70%) of this effect was reversed. In contrast, amiodarone had no effect on S-H interval during the period of drug infusion* Compound A and amiodarone had no effect on His-Purkinje conduction times, i.e., the HV interval remained constant (Figure 4B). Similar to its effects on S-H inteival, compound A but not amiodarone prolonged intraventricular conduc&gt;tion time, i.e,, increased the QRS intei-val (Figure 4C). The increase in QRS interval was gradual and reached a maximum of 1.3.5 msec (60% increase above baseline value) befo3*e the dmg infusion was<br><br>
disconiinued. The effect of compound A on intraventricular conduction was completely reversed dijrmg the 90-mmute washout period. Compoimd A and amiodarone both significantly increased the QT interval. However, compoimd A was much more potent at prolonging the time for ventricular repolarization than was amiodarone CFigure 4D), Wheresas the effect of compound A on repolarization was partially reversed during washcut, the effect of amiodarone was not attenuated during washout The average baseliie values of S-H interval, AV interval, QRS interval and QT interval were 40. l=fcl .9 msec, 7,Si:0.6 msec, 223±0.7 msec, and 164.0±1,7 msec, respectively. Data are shown as meaniSEM.<br>
Figure 5 shows a comparison of the electrophysiological actions of an equipotent (to prolong the baseline S-H interval) concentration of arcdodarone to those effects found using 1 ^M compound A. For this purpose, a concentration of 5 ]xM amiodarone was seleci:ed. Whereas amiodarone (5 ,|iM) caused a time-dependent increase in S-Hj QRS and (JT intervals, it had no effect on the HV interval Of the intervals measured, amiodarone (5 jj.M) had the greatest effect on atriovtsntricular conduction time. It prolonged the baseline S-H interval by 74 msec at 90 min of drag infusion before ihe heart went into second degree AV block. This large prolongation of S-H interval was accompanied by only a 20 msec increase in the QT intenral. On the oth^ hand, although com]30und A (1 |.iM) caused an increase of 18 msec in the baseline S-H interval at 90-min of diug treatment (Figure 3A), it was accompanied by m increase in the QT interval of 28 msec (Figure 3D). Thus, compound A, compared to amiodarone, is able to more selectively prolong the time for ventricular repolarization without causing as much depression of atrioventricular nodal conduction. Likewise, as shown in Figure 3 A, at corcparable degrees of atrial rate slowing, compound A was able to produce a much greater increase in the QT interval ia spontaneously beating hearts (Figure 3D). Taken tog<rther these data show that compound a compared to amiodarone can prolong the ventricular repolarization time in more selective manner at concentrations would cause less slowing of atrial rate and atrioventricular nodal conduction. latter is an important issue because excessive heart conduction symptoms inpatients.></rther><br>
One of the major drawbacks of amiodarone in the clinical setting is its long half-life (&gt; 30 days), which can cause severe life-threatening side effects that are slow to resolve even after discontinuation of drug therapy. The advantages of compound A over amiodarone or other currently used antiarrhythmics are that it exhibits more selective antiarrhythmic action, has a potentially shorter half-iifcj aid has cardiac effects which are more easily reversed ('washed") upon cessation of drug treatment.<br>
