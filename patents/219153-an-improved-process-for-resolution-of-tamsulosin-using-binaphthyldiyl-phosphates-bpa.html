Filed of Invention:<br>
The invention relates to an improved process for the resolution of tamsulosin<br>
using binaphthyldiyl phosphates (bpa). The present invention particularly relates to an improved process of resolving a racemic mixture of 5-[2-[2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy) ethylamino] propyl]-2-methoxy benzene sulfonamide, commonly known as tamsulosin.<br>
Background<br>
The compound tamsulosin (structure- of the f9ormula I given below) is a new type of highly selective a -adrenoceptor antagonist, clinically useful for patients with urinary obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in cardiac insufficiency. The racemic compound and its applications are revealed in the European Patent no 0034432, US patent no 4373106 and US patent no 4868216. Although there is a chiral center in the molecule (indicated by *), in none of these patents there is any mention of the optical isomers.<br><br>
The US patent no 4772475 also claims a controlled release formulation using the racemic tamsulosin as the active ingredient. In all these patents only the tamsulosin hydrochloride salt has been considered for therapeutic applications. The compound should obviously exhibit two optical isomers but are not reported in any of these patents.<br>
The US application no 2003/0109752 and the WO- patent no 03/037850 reveal method of obtaining solid racemic tamsulosin base in two polymorphic forms.<br>
The US patent no 4703063 claims several "sulfamoyl-substituted phenethylamine derivatives" represented by a general formula in Claim 1 of the said Patent. The dependent claim 6 makes a general claim for racemic compounds of all the analogs<br><br>
of claim 1. Similarly claims 8 to 10 make general claim for all optically active compounds of claim 1. The claim 14 dependent on claim 1 spells out the chemical name of tamsulosin, without mentioning the optical isomer. This racemic compound is described in example 20 only as its hydrochloride. As per example 20 and the scheme of its preparation in column 26 of the body of the patent, this compound v^as prepared by a non-stereospecific route resulting in a racemic compound only. There is neither a method of resolution nor a stereospecific synthetic route described for any compound claimed in the said patent.<br>
The US patent no 4731478 claims the optical isomers of tamsulosin, biological activity of only the (-) isomeric form is revealed. The two Examples namely, 33 (a) and 33 (b) in this patent, describe a method of stereospecific synthesis of the optical isomers.<br>
The stereospecific synthesis consists of condensing a chirally active intermediate amine, (R ) (-) isomer as in Example 33 (a) or (S) (+) isomer as in Example 33 (b), with the achiral bromo intermediate to yield the corresponding chiral base and converting the<br>
same to its hydrochloride salt. Although the Example states that "	crude crystals of<br>
(R) (-)-5'[2[2'(o-ethoxy phenoxy) ethylamino]-2-methylethyl]-2-methoxy benzene sulfonamide.... " this base was not characterized further but converted to its salt, namely the hydrochloride. The hydrochloride was characterized only with its melting point, elemental analysis and optical rotation. Although the claims are exclusively for the optically active tamsulosin base (not hydrochloride) and specifically for (-) isomer of tamsulosin base (not hydrochloride), there is neither an Example nor a process described for the preparation of the pure "optically active" tamsulosin base. No characteristics of the "optically active" tamsulosin base are given anywhere in this patent or related patents by the same inventors. Even the specific optical rotation of the claimed (-) tamsulosin free base is not recorded.<br>
It is therefore evident that the applicants of the said patent failed to actually isolate and characterize the pure free bases of the two enantiomers of tamsulosin. No process for resolution of the racemic tamsulosin has also been mentioned. No equivalent Indian patent could be located.<br><br>
The European Patent no 0257787 describes in Example 4 the preparation of (R) -tamsulosin by condensing the chiral intermediate R (-) 5-[(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxy benzene sulfonamide, with the achiral intermediate 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)-ethyl bromide exactly as described in the US patent no 4731478 patent. The same stereospecific synthetic process is also claimed. However, there is no mention of any resolution process for the racemic compound.<br>
The US patent no 5391825 is similar to the US patent no 4731478 in several aspects. The Examples 33(a) and 33(b) in both these patents reveal a method of preparing the optically active isomers as hydrochlorides by synthesis using the appropriate chiral intermediate. However, the claims are limited to the achiral intermediate only. The US patent no 5447958 claims the (R) tamsulosin as a compound and its application in pharmaceutical compositions. The method of its preparation as hydrochloride is given in Example 33(a) by synthesis using the chiral interinediate as in other US patents cited earlier. No equivalent patents have been filed in India.<br>
The WO- patent no 03/035608 describes the same synthetic route to the (R) tamsulosin as hydrochloride, however by improved conditions of reaction. In none of these patents a resolution process for obtaining the required (R) isomer from its racemic form has been mentioned. In none of these patents characteristics of the free bases are mentioned. It is thus evident that the pure R &amp; S isomers were never isolated by any of the earlier investigators.<br>
Although none of the patents mentioned above provide any biological data supporting the use of the (R) isomer in preference to the racemic form, the publication by Honda.K.and Nakagawa, C. in J.Pharm.Exp. Therap. 239, 512 (1986) suggests the advantage of (R) isomer over the (S) isomer and the racemic form of tamsulosin.<br>
The US patent application no 2003/0109752 and its co-application WO- patent no 03/037850 (PCT/NL02/00657) are the only filed applications for resolving a racemic mixture of tamsulosin base. The racemic free base may be obtained directly by synthesis or   the racemic salt may be converted to  free racemic base followed by partial<br><br>
purification as camphor sulfonate addition salt, which is enriched in the 'R'-isomer. The scheme is outlined in the Chart 1 shown below:<br>

The purity of the (R) isomer is low (68.7%) even after recrystallisation. The applicants<br>
have developed another process, which results in an isomer having an enantiomeric<br>
purity of over 99.5%. The process is outlined in the Chart 2 given below. The starting<br>
material is purified racemic tamsulosin free base obtained by one of the methods as<br>
outlined in Chart 1 shown above.<br><br><br>
Overall yield of the salt after four crystallizations was 47.4 % based on the 76 % purified free base. It is clear from the above that to obtain a purity of 99.5 % for the (R) tamsulosin (-) camsylate salt itself, a very tedious process is required, which can then be converted to pure (R) tamsulosin by alkaline treatment.<br>
Until the publication of this patent, 'no method was known as how to purify such an optically impure product (tamsulosiny^ (lines 3-4, page 4 of the WO-03/037850). This patent application also failed to isolate free bases of the two enantiomers of tamsulosin and characterize them. It reveals only the solid form of racemic tamsulosin base, its application mainly for the resolution as described in the application.<br>
Thus, there is a great need for developing a commercially viable, less tedious process of resolving the racemic tamsulosin, which can be easily prepared by known methods, without resorting to chiral intermediates and stereospecific synthesis.<br><br>
There is also a need for obtaining pure and well characterized R and S enantiomeric tamsulosin free bases. As the racemic mixture it is being used in therapy since its launch, the presence of about 1 % of the (S) isomer in the resolved and isolated (R) isomer does not adversely affect the improved activity of the (R) isomer. Moreover no adverse effects of the enriched (S) isomer are reported in literature. The pure isomers so obtained are excellent starting materials for conversion to optically pure salts other than hydrochlorides.<br>
Objectives of the Present Invention:<br>
It is therefore, the main objective of the present invention to provide an improved process for effectively resolving a mixture of (R) and (S) isomers of tamsulosin in any proportion, to obtain either of the isomers as free bases in an enantiomeric purity of at least 99 %.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for resolving the racemic mixture of (R) and (S) isomers of tamsulosin acid addition salts directly, by using the resolving agent which has not hitherto been used for the purpose.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the resolved and isolated (R) and (S) isomers in a purity of greater than 99 % enantiomeric excess.<br>
Tamsulosin is a secondary amine and exhibits basic properties forming salts with acids. The only report of partially successful resolution was achieved using optically active camphor -10-sulfonic acids, as explained earlier. Other commonly employed acids and their derivatives like tartaric acids, esters of tartaric acids, mandelic acids were tried in our search for a satisfactory resolving agent. We also tried the less common chirally pure R &amp; S naproxens with no success. Finally it was possible to obtain satisfactory results by the use of R (-)-l,r-binaphthyl -2,2'-diyl-hydrogen phosphate (CAS Registry No: 39648 -67 -4), hereinafter simply designated as R-BPA,   OR S(+)-l,r-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl<br><br>
hydrogen phosphate (CAS Registry No. 35193 - 64 -7), hereinafter simply designated as S-BPA, as resolving agents.<br>
It was found that the R-tamsulosin forms a sparingly soluble salt with S-BPA which is easily separated by filtration and worked up. Exactly similarly the S-tamsulosin in the racemic tamsulosin salt or base forms an insoluble S-tamsulosin-R-BPA salt with R-BPA enabling easy separation and work up. Both these salts are novel and enable almost quantitative recovery of either isomers of tamsulosin and the resolving agent itself. Further the novelty lies in the fact that either free racemic tamsulosin base or even one of its salts like oxalate can directly be converted to the optically highly pure BPA salt by this process.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the resolution of a mixture of (R) and (S) isomers of tamsulosin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts which comprises<br>
(i)       mixing the racemic mixture of tamsulosin or its salts and S (+) BPA in an<br>
organic solvent or a mixture of an organic solvent and water (ii)      maintaining the resulting mixture at a temperature in the range of 20° to 60°C<br>
for a period in the range of 2 to 10 hours (iii)     filtering the solid R-tamsulosin-S-BPA salt formed (iv)     liberating the R-tamsulosin free base by basification and recovering the free<br>
base by filtration and work - up by conventional methods, and if desired (v).     converting the R-tamsulosin free base so obtained to a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts by conventional methods (vi).    recovering the S-tamsulosin or its salt from the filtrate obtained in (iii)<br>
above by known methods and (vii).   recovering the chiral resolving agent -(S)- BPA used from the mother liquors obtained in steps (iv) or (vi)   by conventional methods.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention there is provided an improved process for the resolution of a mixture of (R) and (S) isomers of tamsulosin pharmaceutically acceptable salts which comprises<br><br>
(i)       mixing the racemic mixture of tamsulosin or its salts and R (+) BPA in an<br>
organic solvent or a mixture of an organic solvent and water (ii)       maintaining the resulting mixture at a temperature in the range of<br>
20° to 60°C for a period in the range of 2 to 10 hours (iii)      filtering the solid S-tamsulosin-R-BPA salt formed, (iv)     liberating the S-tamsulosin free base by basification and recovering the free<br>
base by filtration and work - up by conventional methods, and if desired (v).    converting the S-tamsulosin free base so obtained to a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt by conventional methods, (vi).    recovering the R-tamsulosin or its salt from the filtrate in (iii) above and (vii).   recovering the chiral resolving agent -(R)- BPA used in the process from the<br>
mother liquors obtained in steps (iv) or (vi)  by conventional methods.<br>
The chiral purity of the salt of R-tamsulosin -(S)- BPA prepared was found to be 96.88 % (Chiral HPLC) with only 3.12 % of the S-tamsulosin -(S) - BPA salt. The R-tamsulosin -S-BPA salt is well characterized by recording IR, *H-NMR,<br>
P -NMR, XRD spectroscopic data and DSC thermogram, besides the optical rotation.<br>
The mother liquors obtained from both the above mentioned resolution processes contain one of the isomers enriched. Therefore, the mother liquors are treated with a base, usually ammonia, to liberate the free tamsulosin base (mixture of R or S isomer), which can be extracted into an organic solvent like ethyl acetate and recovered as a solid after distilling off the solvent. The resolving agent remains in the aqueous phase in a microfine suspension as ammonium salt and can be liberated by addition of a mineral acid like hydrochloric acid and completely recovered. The mixture of R and S isomers of tamsulosin is frirther processed as in the initial resolution step by using the appropriate resolving agent, i.e. S-BPA to recover R-tamsulosin as a solid or R-BPA to recover S-tamsulosin as a solid.<br><br>
Description of the Invention:<br>
Racemic salt of tamsulosin obtained by any suitable process may be used for subjecting to the resolution process according to present invention. The circuitous route of synthesis as described in patent European Patent 34432 or its equivalent US patent no 4703063 or US patent no 4731478 result in the hydrochloride salt. The closely related analog, 2-methoxy-5-[2-[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)ethylamino] methyl ethyl]-N-methylbenzene sulfonamide hydrochloride revealed in example 4 of US patent no 5447958, was synthesized by reductive amination of the appropriate ketone with the appropriate amine. This method is well suited for obtaining the salts of racemic tamsulosin also, by choosing the appropriate ketone and amine.<br>
In this invention, the method as described in Example 4 of the US patent no 5447958 was adopted to prepare the salt of racemic tamsulosin. The US application no 2003/0109752 and its corresponding WO-patent no 03/037850 describe other methods of obtaining racemic tamsulosin free base, which can also be used In the present invention. We have found that either the racemic free base or acid addition salts of racemic tamsulosin, like oxalate, salicylate, fumarate, tartrate, maleate and the like can be directly used in the resolution step without liberating the free base. The salts themselves are well characterized. (See for example Fig. 1,2,3 given below<br>
The resolution step is carried out by mixing suitable quantities of the salt of racemic tamsulosin and S (+) BPA in adequate amount of an organic solvent or a mixture of organic solvent and water mixture . The temperature may be maintained at ambient to warm temperatures (20 to 60°C) for several hours. A salt crystallises out which was shown to be R-tamsulosin -(S) - BPA salt with chiral purity of 96.88 % (Chiral HPLC) with only 3.12 % of the S-tamsulosin ~(S) - BPA sah. After filtering off the solid, the mother liquor is reserved for recovering the S-tamsulosin and the chiral resolving agent. The R-tamsulosin -S-BPA salt is well characterized by recording IR (Fig.4) , *H-NMR, ^^P -NMR ( see Fig.5), XRD spectroscopic data (see Fig.7) and DSC thermogram (see Fig.6), besides the optical rotation.<br><br>
optically pure tamsulosin free base is liberated from the respective resolved tamsulosin BPA salt by using a base like ammonia. For example R-tamsulosin -S-BPA sah of 96.88% ee is treated with aqueous ammonia to yield R-tamsulosin free base, which is extracted with ethyl acetate and isolated by removing the solvent with 99.04 %ee and 99.56 % chemical purity (See Figs. 8 to 12). The purified R-tamsulosin base may be used as such or may be further converted to its hydrochloride or other pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Analogous to the above resolution, the salt of racemic tamsulosin is treated with R-BPA and solid S-tamsulosin -R-BPA salt is recovered. The mother liquor contains the R-tamsulosin -R-BPA salt which can be used for recovering the R-tamsulosin and the resolving agent. The S-tamsulosin - R-BPA salt is also characterized suitably (See Figs.13,14,15).<br>
The mother liquors from both the above resolutions contain one of the isomers enriched. Therefore the mother liquors are first treated with a base, to liberate the free tamsulosin base (mixture of R and S isomers), which can be extracted into an organic solvent like ethyl acetate and recovered as a solid after distilling off the solvent. The resolving agent remains in the aqueous phase in a microfine suspension as salt and can be liberated by addition of a mineral acid and completely recovered. The mixture of R and S isomers of tamsulosin obtained earlier is fixrther processed as in the initial resolution step by using the appropriate resolving agent, i.e. S-BPA to recover R-tamsulosin as a solid or R-BPA to recover S-tamsulosin as a solid. In this manner S-tamsulosin free base of high purity could be obtained and characterized (see Figs.l6,17i&amp;18).<br><br>
For clarity the resolution operations are summarized in the following charts 3 and 4.<br>

Chart - 4 Resolution of (R,S)-Tamsulosin Salt or Free Base with R - BPA<br><br>
The resolution steps described above and related operations and outcomes are illustrated with the Examples given below, without limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
The racemic tamsulosin free base required for Examples 4 and 5 was prepared by modifying a process described in US patent no 4703063 and US patent no 4731478 (Examples 4 and 5 in both). For the sake of clarity and completeness this preparation is also described below.<br><br>
Preparation of racemic tamsulosin Free Base:<br>
a). 2-Methoxy-5-(2-oxopropyl)-benzene sulfonamide (373 gm, 153.3 mmol), 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)-l-ethanamine (29.8 gm, 164.4 mmol) and methanol (250 mL) were taken into a one litre stainless steel flask and mixed well. Catalyst Raney nickel (8 gm) was added to the flask and the mixture hydrogenated at 50°C at hydrogen pressure of 40 psi for 30 hrs. The catalyst was removed by filtration and solvent from the filtrate was distilled off completely at 50°C under vacuum. The dark brown crude obtained was treated with methanolic hydrochloric acid (175 mL) at 0 -5*^C under stirring. Tamsulosin hydrochloride formed as a solid was filtered washed with ethyl acetate (200 mL), suspended in methanol (120 mL) and the methanol slurry filtered to obtain off white solid material. It was dried for 3 hrs at 80°C to give racemic tamsulosin hydrochloride. Melting point 255 - 257°C, chemical purity of 98.8 area % (by HPLC) and R,S ratio of 51.45 : 48.55 (by chiral HPLC),<br>
b). Racemic tamsulosin hydrochloride (25 gm) obtained by the process described in step (a) above was suspended in water (50 mL). A 15 % solution of ammonium hydroxide (25 mL) was added to the mixture and stirred for two hours at room temperature. The solid material was filtered, washed with water (25 mL) and dried at 60°C for 3 hrs under vacuum (3 torr) to afford racemic tamsulosin free base (yield 22.3 gm, 97.1 %) of melting point 127 - 130°C, chemical purity of 98.15 % (area % by HPLC) and R,S ratio of 51.65 : 48.35, (by chiral HPLC).<br>

EXAMPLE -1<br>
Synthesis of salts of racemic tamsulosin:<br>
(a). Synthesis of oxalate salt of racemic tamsulosin :<br>
2-(o-Ethoxyphenoxy) ethylamine (45 gm) was dissolved in methanol (250 mL). To this 2-methoxy-5-(2-oxopropyl)-benzene sulfonamide (55 gm), catalyst 5 % platinum on carbon (12.1 gm) and methanol (330 mL) were added. The mixture was hydrogenated in autoclave at 55°C at hydrogen pressure of 13 kg/cm for 5 hrs. The reaction mixture was cooled and the catalyst was filtered off To the filtrate containing racemic tamsulosin, oxalic acid (14.3 gm) was added and the solvent was distilled off To the residue, acetone (700 mL) was added and stirred at reflux temperature for 30 mins. The mixture was cooled, filtered, and the filter cake washed with acetone (50 mL). The salt was further purified by suspending the material in 2-propanol at reflux temperature, cooling to ambient temperature and filtering the solid. Pure oxalate salt of racemic tamsulosin shows melting range: 178 - 182°C and HPLC purity: 97.24 (area %). The chiral HPLC showed it to be a mixture R and S isomers in the ratio of 50.1 to 49.9.
