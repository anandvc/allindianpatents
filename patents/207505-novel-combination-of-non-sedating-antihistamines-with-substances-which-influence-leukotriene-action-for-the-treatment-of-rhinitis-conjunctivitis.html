				<td>Novel combination of nonsedating antihistamines with substances which influence leukotriene action, for the treatment of rhinitis/conjunctivitis<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions which contain a nonsedating antihistamine and a substance influencing leukotriene action which can be a leukotriene D4 antagonist, a 5-lipoxv.genase inhibitor, or a 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) antagonist.<br>
The combinations serve to improve the local therapy of allergic and/or vasomotor rhinitis or of allergic conjunctivitis.<br>
The antihistamine provides for the rapid elimination of the acute symptoms, which are manifested as reddening, itching or swelling while the inflammation underlying the syndrome is successfully controlled using the leukotriene antagonists contained in the combination..<br>
Prior art<br>
The number of allergic disorders is increasing greatly worldwide. Studies have shown that on average 7.5% of all children and adolescents worldwide suffer from rhinoconjunctivitis (hay fever combined with an ocular symptomatology) (Worldwide variation in prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema: ISAAC, Lancet, 351, 1225-1332, 1-998). In West European countries, the prevalence, at about 14%, is markedly higher (Annesi-Maesano, I. and Oryszczyn, M.P.: Rhinitis in adolescents, Results of the ISAAC survey, Revue Francaise d'Allergologie et d'Immunologie Clinique, 38, 283-289, 1998; Norrman, E., L. Nystrom, E. Jonsson and N. Stjernberg: Prevalence and  incidence  of  asthma  and rhinoconjunctivitis in<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
Swedish  teenagers,  European  Journal  of  Allergy  and Clinical Immunology, 53, 28-35, 1998) -<br>
The intensive research activities of recent years have led     to     the    recognition     that    allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is an inflammatory process in the sense  of  a  persistent  inflammatory  reaction.  While histamine  is  still  regarded  as  the  most  important mediator of the early phase and as the most important trigger of the symptoms such as reddening,  sneezing, itching    and    hypersecretion    (rhinorrhea    and lacrimation) ,    further   mediators   such   as   the leukotrienes are involved in the nasal obstruction, secretion and in the progression of the inflammation (e.g.   attraction   of   the   proinf lamina tory   cell-s, promotion of cellular infiltration, etc.). Accordingly, the  aims  of  the  therapy  have  been  shifted  from symptomatic therapy to an additional antiinflammatory therapy with influencing of the inflammation underlying the allergic disorders. Both histamine; and leukotrienes (LTs) are released in the allergic early phase and late phase.<br>
The acute symptoms (itching, reddening, swelling, rhinorrhea and lacrimation) of rhinoconjunctivitis can be readily controlled, inter alia, with the aid of classical antihistamines of the first and second generations. However, they hardly have a therapeutically relevant influence on the inflammation which underlies the disorder and is always progressive. Often, the allergic rhinitis {rhinoconjunctivitis) is regarded both by patients and by the physician as a trivial disorder and accordingly is only inadequately treated. As a result, however, a so-called change of stage can occur, i.e. bronchial asthma, which is to be taken very seriously, develops from the relatively harmless rhinitis. For this reason, it is indisp'eTfs'able to treat even allergic rhinoconjunctivitis adequately and  intensively.  Only  then  can  the  patients  live<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
symptom-free and only then can a change of stage, which under certain circumstances is life-threatening, be prevented.<br>
Numerous  animal  experimental  and  clinical  studies indicate that both histamine and LTs can be detected in nasal secretion (Yamasaki, U., T. Matsumoto, S. Fukuda, T. Natayama,  H.  Nagaya,  Y.  Ashida.  Involvement  of thromboxane A2 and histamine in experimental allergic rhinitis  of  guinea pigs.  J.  Pharmacol.  Exp.  Ther. 82:1046,  1997;  Pipkorn,  U,  G Karlsson,  L Enerbeck. Cellular response of the human allergic nasal mucosa to natural allergen exposure. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 35:234,  1988;  Volovitz,  B.,  S.L.  Osur,  M.  Berstein, P.L. Ogra. Leukotriene C4 release in upper respiratory mucosa during natural  exposure  to  ragweed-sensitive children.  J.  Allergy Clin.  Immunol.  82:414,  1988). Owing to the blockade of the histamine Hi receptors, certain symptoms such as sneezing, reddening, itching and  nasal  or  ocular  hypersecretion   (rhinorrhea, lacrimation) are significantly reduced (Simons, F.E.R., K.J. Simons. Second generation H1receptor antagonists. Ann. Allergy 66:5, 1991). In the acute phase of any allergic reaction - independently of the location -degranulation and the emptying of  the intracellular stores  of  the  mast  cells  or  of  the  basophilic granulocytes are prominent. This is a process which is controlled by the extra- or intracellular calcium.<br>
Histamine, however, does not only act as a mediator which induces allergic symptoms, it also acts on the allergic inflammation by influencing the release of cytokines. In a study on human conjunctival epithelial cells (eye), it was shown that histamine greatly increases the secretion of 11-8 and GM-CSF ("granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor). This release can be prevented by histamine H1 receptor antagonists, i.e. this action is mediated via Hi receptors  (Weimer,  L.K.,  D.A.  Gamache,  J.M.  Yanni.<br><br>
_ 4 -<br>
Histamine-stimulated cytokine secretion from human conjunctival epithelial cells: inhibition by histamine H1-antagonist emedastine. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 115:288, 1998). In addition, we know that allergic stimulation not only releases the intracellularly stored histamine from the mast cells and basophilic granulocytes, but also brings about the de nova synthesis of other mediators such as leukotrienes.<br>
Leukotrienes are mediators which belong to the eicosanoids group. They are derivatives of arachidonic acid, a fatty acid which is a constituent of membrane phospholipids. The leukotrienes are formed from arachidonic acid via 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) . At the present time, only the pathogenetically relevant, rale of the so-called cysteinyl-leukotrienes, to which LTC<i ltd4 and lte4 belong has been confirmed. the action of leukotrienes can take place due to occupation their receptors or by inhibition synthesis. in addition a protein also lead decreased synthesis leukotrienes.></i>
Among the numerous LT antagonists, a few, such as zafirlukast, montelukast, pranlukast, etc. are employed therapeutically in bronchial asthma. Of the 5-LOX inhibitors, zileuton is already on the market. The so-called FLAP inhibitors include, for example, MK-591, Bay x 1005, which are still in the clinical testing phase.<br>
Numerous investigations confirm the importance of the leukotrienes in allergic disorders. Thus after allergen provocation a marked increase in the LT concentration in the nasal lavage fluid of patients with allergic rhinitis was detected both in the early phase and in the late phase (Creticos, P.S., S.P. Peters, N.F. Adkinson. Peptide leukotriene release after antigen challenge in patients sensitive to ragweed.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
N. Eng.  J.  Med.  310:1626,  1984).  Cysteinyl-LTs	can<br>
induce hypersecretion (rhinorrhea or lacrimation},	but<br>
the leukotrienes appear to be far more important	for<br>
nasal obstruction.<br>
The nasal obstruction induced by histamine is present in the early phase of the allergic reaction and lasts only minutes, while the obstruction due to leukotrienes can be observed up to the late phase,  which lasts 6-8 hours after the allergic provocation. In contrast to histamine, sneezing and itching do not occur after LT  provocation  (Okuda,  M.,  T.  Watase,  A.  Mazewa, CM. Liu.  The  role  of  leukotrine  D4  in  allergic rhinitis. Ann. Allergy 60:537, 1988). After provocation with   LTD4,   however,   there   is   a   long-lasting infiltration of eosinophilic granulocytes,  which for the greatest part are responsible  for  the allergic inflammation (Fuj ika, M. et al. see above) . These so-called late-phase reactions  (e.g.  nasal obstruction) can be improved by LT antagonists such as zafirlukast (Donnelly, A.L., M. Glass, M.C. Minkwitz, T.B. Casale. The  leukotriene  D4-receptor  antagonist  ICI  204219 relieves symptoms of acute seasonal allergic rhinitis. Am.  J.  Resp.  Crit.  Care Med.  151:1734,  1995)  (ICI 204219 = Zafirlukast).  The 5-LOX inhibitors are also able markedly to reduce allergic reactions not only in animal experiments,  but also in human therapy  (Liu, M.C. , L.M. Dube, J. Lancaster, and the zileuton - study group. Acute and chronic effects of a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor in asthma: a 6-month randomized multicenter trial. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 98:859, 1996).<br>
Azelastine is presently the only active compound among the antihistamines which is available both systemically (tablet) and topically (nasal spray and eye drops). Accordingly, patients even with very strongly pronounced allergic symptoms can be treated successfully. On account of the various pharmaceutical formulations, the patients can be individually treated<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
with azelastine depending on the nature and degree of severity of the symptoms and thus the inflammation underlying the disorder can be suppressed.<br>
Of the modern antihistamines, azelastine was the first in  which  the  inhibition  of  the  synthesis  of  the leukotrienes important for the allergic inflammatory reaction was observed in therapeutically relevant doses or   concentration   (Achterrath Tuckermann  U  ,   Th. Simmet, W.  Luck,  I. Szelenyi,  B. A.  Peskar.  Inhibition of cysteinyl-leukotriene production by azelastine and its biological  significance.  Agents and Actions 24: 217, 1988). This antileukotriene effect of azelastine is also detected in controlled clinical studies in allergies  {Shin, M.H.,  F.M.  Baroody,  D.  Proud,  A. Kagey-Sobotka,  L.M.  Liechtenstein,  M.  Naclerio.  The effect of ' azelastine on the early allergic response. Clin. Exp. Allergy 22:289, 1992). Owing to this action, the clinical efficacy of azelastine,  comparable with budesonide,   a  glucocorticoid,   can  then  also  be explained  (Wang,  D.Y.,  J.   Smitz,  M.  De  Waele, P. Clement.   Effect   of   topical   applications   of budesonide and azelastine on nasal symptoms, eciainophi counts and mediator release in atopic patients after nasal allergen challenge during the pollen season. Int. Arch.  Allergy  Immunol.  114:185,  1997;  Gastpar,  H., R. Aurich,   U.   Petzold.   Intranasal   treatment   of perennial  rhinitis:  Comparison  of  azelastine nasal spray and budesonide nasal aerosol.  Arzn.  Forsch. Drug Res. 43:475, 1993).<br>
The mechanism of action via which azelastine inhibits LT synthesis and LT release is unique and not described in the case of other antihistamines. As is known, many release processes proceed via an increased level of intracellular Ca2, which takes place due to allergic stimulation of the effector cells, since intracellular Ca2 initiates the decisive steps for increased leukotriene synthesis and release. Azelastine inhibits<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
intracellular Ca2+ release  (Takanaka,  K.  Effects  of azelastine     on     polymorphonuclear     leukocytes: arachidonate  cascade  inhibition  mechanism.  Progress Med.  275,  1987;  Chand,  N.,  et  al.  Inhibition  of allergic and non-allergic  leukotriene  formation  and histamine secretion by azelastine: Implication for its mechanism of action. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 90:67, 1989; Senn, N-, et al. Action of azelastine on intracellular Ca2+ in cultured airway smooth muscle. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 205:29, 1991; Chand, N., .R.D. Sofia. A novel in vivo inhibitor of leukotriene biosynthesis: A  possible  mechanism  of  action:  A  mini  review. J. Asthm. 32:227, 1995).<br>
The mechanism of action of the LT receptor antagonists is "simple". As receptor antagonists, they occupy the LT receptors. Accordingly, the released leukotrienes can. approach their receptors and display their actions which can be mediated by the receptor.<br>
Combinations for intranasal application, which contain an antihistamine having leukotriene-inhibiting properties together with a glucocorticosteroid and, if appropriate, decongestants, antiallergics, mucolytics, nonopioid analgesics, lipoxygenase  inhibitors and leukotriene receptor antagonists, are disclosed in EP 0 780 127 Al and are recommended for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The cooperation of the antihistamine with the glucocorticosteroid should increase the effectiveness of the treatment.<br>
For the topical treatment of rhinitis, WO 98/48839 also discloses the application of an antiinflammatory agent in the form of corticosteroids, to which are added, to increase the efficacy, for example, at least a vasoconstrictor, a leukotriene inhibitor, an antihistamine, an antiallergic, a mucolytic, an anaesthetic, an anticholinergic or a neuraminidase inhibitor.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
As disclosed in WO 98/34611, for the topical treatment of allergic asthma, combinations are proposed which consist of descarboethoxyloratidine, a metabolite of the nonsedating antihistamine loratidine, and a leukotriene antagonist, which can be a leukotriene D4 antagonist, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor or a FLAP antagonist. The use of descarboethoxyloratadine should avoid a large number of undesired side effects of loratadine and other nonsedating antihistamines.<br>
A. Roquet et al. , Combined antagonism of leukotrienes and Histamine produces predominant inhibition of allergen-induced early and late phase airway obstruction in asthmatics. Am. J. Respir. Crit, Ca-re Med., 1997, 155; 1856-1863 investigate the' actions of loratadine, the leukotriene antagonist zafirlukast and the combination of both active compounds in allergen-induced airway disorders of asthmatics on oral administration.<br>
From investigations by Merck &amp; Co., WO 97/28797, it is also known to administer loratadine with five selected leukotriene  antagonists,   monetlukast,   zafirlukast, pranlukast,      sodium     1- ( ( (R)-3- (2- { 6, 7-difluoro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyDphenyl)-3-(2-(2-hydroxy-2-propyl)-phenyl)thiojmethyl)cyclopropaneacetate,      !-({(!(R)-3- (2- (2,3-dichlorothieno[3,2-b]pyridin-5-yl)-(E)-ethenyDphenyl)-3-(2-(1-hydroxy-l-methylethyl)phenyl)-propyl)thio)methyl)cyclopropaneacetic  acid  orally  or parenterally in asthma, allergy and inflammations.<br>
For the treatment of allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis, on account of numerous side effects of introduced preparations, lack of remedial success and the in some cases nonspecific therapy, a great need furthermore exists for combinations having high effectiveness and safety.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of finding and making available novel combinations for the treatment of allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  the  provision  of pharmaceutical  substance  combinations  which  can  be administered  topically  but  also  orally  in  allergic and/or vasomotor rhinitis or allergic conjunctivitis, these containing an efficacious amount of a nonsedating antihistamine with the exception of compounds of the loratadine  type,   preferably  azelastine,   but,   for example, also levocabastine, cetirizine,  fexofenadine, mizolastine,   astemizole,   in  combination  with  a leukotriene D4 antagonist which influences leukotriene action, such as montelukast, zafirlukast or pranlukast or with a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, such as zileuton, piripost         or  AWD  23-115  (1-[4-(quinolin-2-yl-methoxy}benzyl]-5-methoxy-lH-indazol-3-ol      dihydro-chloride) or with a FLAP antagonist, such as MK-591, MK-886, Bay x 1005 respectively, and,  if appropriate, further  pharmaceu'tically  acceptable  vehicles  and/or extenders or excipients therefor.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to the provision of a process for the: prophylaxis and treatment of allergic and/or vasomotor rhinitis or allergic conjunctivitis in a mammalian body, by administering an efficacious amount of a combination of a nonsedating antihistamine with the exception of compounds of the loratadine type, preferably azelastine, but, for example, also levocabastine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, mizolastine, astemizole, with a leukotriene D4 antagonist which influences leukotriene action, such as montelukast, zafirlukast or pranlukast or with a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, such as zileuton, piripost       or AWD 23-115 or with a FLAP<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
antagonist, such as MK-591, MK-886, Bay x 1005 topically or orally. Administration can be carried out simultaneously, sequentially or separately.<br>
The  present  invention  furthermore  relates  to  the provision of suitable individual dose forms of a non-sedating antihistamine with the exception of compounds of the loratadine type, preferably azelastine but, for example, also levocabastine,  cetirizine,  fexofenadine, mizolastine,   astemirole,   in   combination  with   a leukotriene D4 antagonist which influences leukotriene action, such as montelukast, zafirlukast or pranlukast or with a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, such as zileuton, piripost      or AWD 23-1.15 or with a FLAP antagonist, such as MK-591, MK-886, Bay x 1005, which are suitable for easy topical or oral administration, for example in the form of sprays or drops or tablets.<br>
The novel combination of an antihistamine,  with the exception  of  compounds  of  the  loratadine  type, preferably   azelastine,   but,   for   example,   also levocabastine,  cetirizine,  fexofenadine,  mizolastine, astemizole  and  a  leukotriene  D4  antagonist  which influences  leukotriene action,  such as montelukast, zafirlukast   or   pranlukast   or   a   5-lipoxygenase inhibitor,  such as zileuton,  piripost        or AWD 23-115 or a FLAP antagonist, such as MK-591, MK-886 or Bay x 1005,   which   can   also   be   present   as pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts,   can  be  given, according    to    the    invention,    simultaneously, successively or independently of one another topically (intranasally or intraocularly)  or orally as a fixed combination or in individual substances.<br>
If separate formulations are present, then these are tailored to one another and contain the respective active compounds in the dose unit in the same amounts and corresponding weight ratios in which they can be present in the combination.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
As a result of the combination, there is not only a rapid onset of action, but also a high therapeutic efficacy, which is accompanied by a strong antiinflammatory action, since the modes of action of the active compounds mentioned are mutually complementary and also behave similarly pharmacokinetically. The long duration of action makes possible administration twice daily. If the active components are present in the form of a fixed combination, administration is simpler for the patient, because both active compounds are contained in one tablet or one container.<br>
The concentration of the antihistamine components according to the invention can be in the range from 0.001% to 0.5%.<br>
The concentration of the leukotriene antagonists in the combination can be in the range from 0.01% to 5%.<br>
Preferred concentrations are 0.05% to 0.2% for the antihistamine component and 0.5% to 2% for leukotriene antagonists.<br>
The intended dosage takes place once to twice daily. The' individual dose of the antihistamine is 50 -500 Mg, preferably 200 - 400 ixg administered topically. On topical application, the dose of the leukotriene D4 antagonist is between 100 - 2000  g, preferably. -200 -1000  g.<br>
5-LOX or FLAP inhibitors are administered in a dose range from 50 - 2000 ng, preferably 200 - 1000  g.<br>
The dose of the antihistamine (for example as azelastine) is between 0.5 - 16 mg/day, preferably 2 -8 mg/day.<br>
In the case of the leukotriene D4 antagonists (for example montelukast), the individual dose is i -50 mg/day, preferably 5-10 mg/day.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
The oral dose of 5-LOX inhibitors such as zileuton is between 1-6 g/day, preferably 0.6 - 2 g/day. In the case of FLAP inhibitors,  the dose is  50 -2000 mg/day, preferably 100 - 500 mg/day.<br>
The antihistamine and leukotriene antagonist compounds mentioned and processes for their preparation are known.<br>
The pharmaceutical handling of the compounds to give combinations takes place according to the customary standard methods, by preferably mixing the antihistamine and the leukotriene antagonist individually or together, if appropriate together with vehicles and/or extenders or excipients, and converting the mixture thus obtained into suitable administration forms.<br>
The active compounds are administered orally or topically in the form of a mixture, which contains customary pharmaceutical extenders, excipients or vehicles for pharmaceutical purposes.<br>
The compositions for oral or topical administration can be formulated as different, pharmaceutically acceptable administration forms, e.g. nasal sprays, nasal drops, eye drops, tablets, capsules or granules. Apart  from  the  active  compounds,  the  compositions according  to  the  invention  can  furthermore  contain various typical pharmaceutical form constituents such as  antimicrobial preservatives,  osmotics,  thickening agents, excipients for pH adjustment or buffer systems.<br>
The antimicrobial preservative substances include, for example,    benzalkonium   chloride,    cetylpyridinium chloride/bromide, chlorobutanol, chlorhexidine acetate, chlorhexidine    HCl, .    chlorhexidine    digluconate, chlorocresol,       methylparaben,       propylparaben,<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
phenoxyethanol,  phenylmercury  salts,   sorbic  acid, thiomersal.<br>
For preservative purposes, a combination of sodium edetate and benzalkonium chloride is preferably used. Sodium edetate is used in concentrations of 0.05 - 0.1% and benzalkonium chloride in concentrations of 0.005 -0.05%.<br>
For the suitable excipients which are suitable for adjusting the tonicity or osmolality, sodium chloride, potassium  chloride,   mannitol,   glucose,   sorbitol, glycerol  or  propylene  glycol  in  concentrations  of approximately 0.1 to 10% can be used.<br>
The compositions frequently contain thickeners in order to increase the viscosity and to prolong and to improve the contact between pharmaceutical and body tissue. These  thickeners  include  methylcellulose,  hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose,   hydroxyethylcellulose,   sodium carboxymethylcellulose,  polyvinyl  alcohol,  polyvinyl-pyrrolidone,  polyacrylates,  polyacrylamide,  dextran, gellan gum, poloxamer or cellulose acetate phthalate.<br>
Moreover, the compositions according to the invention comprise pharmaceutically acceptable buffers such that the pH can be adjusted and kept in a range from approximately 4 to 8, preferably 5.5 to 7.5. Buffers of this type are citrate, phosphate, trornethamine, glycine, borate or acetate.<br>
These buffers can also be derived from substances of the type such as citric acid, primary or secondary sodium phosphate, glycine, boric acid, sodium tetraborate, acetic acid and sodium acetate. Moreover, further excipients such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide can be used for pH adjustment.<br>
The present invention will be illustrated with the aid of some examples.<br><br>

The following pharmacological investigation describes the action of azelastine and montelukast on their own and in combination on a rhinitis model on brown Norway rats. The brown Norway rats were actively sensitized by double i .p. injection of a suspension of ovalbumin and aluminum hydroxide in physiological saline solution on two successive days. Three weeks after sensitization, a catheter was tied into the trachea of the animals in orthograde manner under sodium thiopental anesthesia in order to maintain the respiration of the animals and a further catheter was advanced in a retrograde manner through the trachea up to the internal opening of the choanas for the perfusion of the nasal cavities and fixed. The nasal perfusate can thus trickle out through the nasal  cavities  and be  accepted by  a  fraction collector. The test substances were either suspended in Tylose  (montelukast}  or  dissolved  in  physiological saline    solution     {azelastine}     and    injected intraperitoneally 60 min before allergen provocation. In order to rinse mucus away from the nose, PBS was perfused through the nasal cavity for 30 min using a roller pump (perfusion rate 0.5 ml/min). In the case of topical application, the test substances are added to the perfusate in molar concentration and the solution is perfused through the nose for 30 min before allergen provocation. The plasma marker Evans Blue (1 ml/animal each  of  a  1%  strength  solution  in  PBS}  was.. - then injected into the jugular vein. There was then a break of 15 min in which the perfusion fluid was collected. The allergen provocation (challenge} was then carried out by perfusion of the nasal cavity with a solution of ovalbumin in PBS  (10 mg/ml of ovalbumin in PBS)  for 60 min, during which the perfusate was collected in the fraction  collector  in  15 min  fractions.  The  total amount of the samples/animal was 5. The samples were centrifuged and then applied to microtiter plates and measured at a wavelength of 620 rim using the Digiscan photometer.   The  blank  values  were  automatically<br><br>

subtracted. The course of action over 60 min was calculated using an AUC program. The substance action of the preparation group was calculated in % against vehicle controls,<br>
An increased mucosal permeability after allergen provocation is to be assessed as a sign of the release of messengers such as histamine and leukotrienes. After antigen contact, this phenomenon occurs even in allergic people and is manifested by increased fluid secretion and nasal blockage.<br>

Table 1: Action of azelastine and montelukast on their own and in combination (intraperi.toneal administration) on the nasal mucosal permeability in actively sensitized and topically provoked brown Norway rats<br><br><br>
- 19 -<br>
The sole administration of azelastine in a dose of 0.01 mg/kg i.p. causes a small inhibition of the vascular permeability of 11%. Montelukast is likewise slightly active in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg i.p. with 7% inhibition. The combinatory administration of azelastine in a dose of 0.01 mg/kg i.p. and montelukast in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg i.p. caused a superadditive inhibition of the mucosal plasma extravasation of 40% (p
The FLAP inhibitor BAY x 1005 inhibited the nasal mucosal permeability in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg i.p. by 31%. AWD 23-115, a 5-LOX inhibitor, in a dose range of 0.03 to 10 mg/kg i.p, caused a dose-dependent inhibition (37 - 54%) of the vascular permeability.<br>

- 20 -<br>
On topical application, the histamine H: blocker azelastine exhibits a strong inhibition of the mucosal plasma extravasation even in concentrations of 0.003 to 0.03  mol/1. The 5-LOX inhibitor AWD 23-115 inhibits the vascular permeability at 0.3 and 1  mol/1 in a dose-dependent manner by 32% and 49% respectively. If azelastine is given at a concentration of 0.003  mol/1 in combination with AWD 23-115 (0.1  mol/1) , the inhibition of the mucosal extravasation is 31% (p
