				<td>This invention relates to dispensing apparatus having integral dosage counting devices which require an axial force for actuation.  In particular, the invention relates ro dispensing apparatus having a dosage counter.<br>
It has been recognised that there is a need to provide accurate information to a user of a dose-dispensing delivery apparatus concerning the number of doses delivered from, or remaining in, the dispensing apparatus.  Without such information, there is a danger that a user will forget how many doses have been delivered and hence take E greater o.r fewer number of doses than is required.  There is also a danger that a user may be unaware that the dispensing apparatus is empty or close to empty.  This is especially dangerous where the dispensing apparatus is for use in delivering medicinal compounds for the treatment of chronic or acute symptoms, for example, as in the case of a pressurised metered dose inhaler used for treating asthmatic reactions.<br>
A number of devices have been proposed to count the number of doses delivered or remaining in a delivery apparatus.  W095/08484 teaches a dose counting device for use with an aerosol medication dispenser.  The device works by translating a non-rotative force on an outer cover into a rotation of an indicator wheel by use of a set of flexible pawls engaged with a set of teeth.  The pawls depress and thereby extend circumferentially when the applied force forces them to effect a rotation of the teeth.  This device has, however, been found to have disadvantages.  The reliability of operation of the medication dispenser and the<br><br>
pawls,   for -example .     If the pawl-s  are  too  stiff  relative  to the   internal   spring  bias   then  the  medication  dispenser  mav dispense  a  dose  before  the pawls   flex sufficiently  to  rotate the   indicator  wheel;   a   dose  would be   delivered  without   the counter registering  it.      Alternatively,   if  the  pawls   are   too flexible  relative   to   the   internal   spring bias   then   the  pawls may  flex sufficiently  to rotate  the  indicator wheel  before the  medication dispenser has  dispensed a dose;   a  dose  would be  registered by  the   counter but   not   actually  delivered.<br>
EP1065477  describes   a   dose   dispenser  with   a   device   for counting  the  dispensed  doses,  -wherein the  dispenser comprises  a base body,  .an operating body superimposed on the base body,   a  first   discoidal  body housed in and rot able within  the  operating  body,   and wherein  flexible   tangs projecting on  the  first  discoidal  body cause  the   first discoidal body to  rotate   one  step  each time the   operating body is moved axially relative to the base body.<br>
The present  invention  seeks  to provide  dispensing, apparatus having  integral  dosage  counting  devices  which overcome  at   least   some   of   the   associated disadvantages   of the  prior art.<br>
Accordingly,   in a  first  aspect,   the  invention provides  a dispensing apparatus   comprising  a housing  containing   a dosage  counter comprising  first  and second annular members, each mounted rotationally,   the housing being  suitable  for receiving,   in use,   a container containing  a product  for dispensation,   the  container being locatable  to  pass  within holes/apertures  of  the   first  and  second  annular members characterised in that   the  apparatus  further  comprises   a  cog_,-the   axis  of rotation o.f  the  cog being offset  from the  axes<br><br>
of rotation of the first and second annular members and the axis of rotation of the cog being located outside the first and second annular members whereupon each actuation of the apparatus causes the first annular member to incrementally rotate which, after a predetermined number of actuations of the apparatus/ causes the cog to rotate; the rotation of the cog causing the second annular member to incrementally rotate.<br>
In use, a longitudinal actuation force applied to the container is converted to a rotational force applied to the first annular member by way of co-operating formations having angled abutment surfaces.<br>
Preferably, the first annular member is provided with angled abutment surfaces.<br>
The dispensing apparatus further comprises a cap or sleeve, for surrounding at least part of a container locatable in the dispensing apparatus.  The cap or sleeve is provided with angled abutment surfaces.<br>
Most preferably, the first annular member, and/or the cap or sleeve is/are provided with one or more sets of angled abutment surfaces at different diameters.<br>
In use, respective sets of angled abutment surfaces of the first annular member, and the cap or sleeve co-operate to provide an incremental rotation of the first annular _member upon a longitudinal actuation of the sleeve or cap. In particular, a first set of co-operating portions of the first annular member, and the sleeve or cap co-operate to provide a partial-incremental rotation of the annular member upon a- down-stroke longitudinal actuation of the dispensing apparatus.  A second set of co-operating portions of the first annular member, and the sleeve or cap co-operate to<br><br>
provide a second and 'final partial-incremental rotation of-the first annular member upon a reciprocal up-stroke longitudinal actuation of the dispensing apparatus.<br>
The first annular member may be provided with means for affecting rotation of the cog, such as a notch or protrusion positioned on an outer edge of the first annular member. The notch or protrusion is capable of interacting with a correspondingly-shaped portion of the cog.<br>
When the rotation means of the first annular member .is<br>
a notch, the cog is turned by way of a tooth catching the<br>
notch of the first annular member as the member rotates upon<br>
actuation of the apparatus.  Similarly, when the rotation<br>
means of the first annular member is a protrusion, 'tig- cog<br>
has a correspondingly-shaped notch with which to affect the<br>
desired rotation of the cog. -	t<br>
The first annular member has three rotation means positioned on its outer edge, at least ten increments~&gt;of rotation apart.<br>
Preferably, each respective part of the cog which interacts -with the first and second annular member has a different number of teeth.  More preferably, the ratio of teeth on respective parts of the cog which interact with the first and second annular member is 1:2.<br>
The cog may be made of resilient material and/or resiliently positioned against an outer edge of the first annular member.<br>
Preferably, the first and second annular members are provided with one or more sets of markings indicative of the amount or number of doses of product dispensed from, or remaining in, a container received within the apparatus.  In<br><br>
particular, the sets of markings may be numbering or variations of colour and/or tone.<br>
As a pref-erence, numbering on the i±rst annular member ranges from 0 to 9 and that of the second annular member<br><br>
from 0-0 to 2D, so that when .both are seen in combination, a three-figure number is shown.<br>
Upon actuation of the apparatus, the numbering is caused to decrease or augment by a value of one.<br>
Preferably, the second annular member is provided with an extended portion which is positioned on the second annular member so as to cover the markings of the first annular member when a container locatable in the housing is empty.<br>
Optionally, the dispensing apparatus may further comprise means for locking-out operation of a container "-located in the housing.<br>
As a preference, the dispensing apparatus is provided1""'<br>
with a mouthpiece which is detachable from the housing.  ;;~	<br>
Additionally, a portion of the sleeve or cap and a  "' portion of the housing may be adapted to provide resistance to actuation of the dispensing apparatus .  The portion of '; the sleeve or-cap is a resilient member and the portion -of the housing is a static abutment surface which, during use, is temporarily abutable by the portion of the sleeve or cap.<br>
Tbe dispensing -apparatus may further comprise third and subsequent annular members, a further cog being provided for each additional annular member, whereby a predetermined number of rotations of the previous annular member causes an incremental rotation of the subsequent member.-<br>
The cog of the first aspect"of the invention comprises a hub, with a pivot hole situated in the- centre thereof, and a plurality of teeth outwardly-extending from the centre of the cog, the cog being rotatable about a longitudinal axis through the hole, wherein one or more teeth have a reduced-height in. the direction of the longitudinal axis in<br><br>
that upper and lower edges of the tooth are not inline with<br>
both upper and lower faces of the cog.<br>
Preferably, the one or more teeth having a reduced<br>
height are half the height of other teeth and are<br>
interspaced between each pair of non-reduced-height teeth. Preferably, also, the reduced-height teeth are<br>
positioned at either an upper or lower edge of the cog. The invention also includes dispensing apparatus<br>
substantially as herein described, with reference to, and as<br>
shown in, the accompanying drawings.<br>
Portions of the one or more teeth may be separated by a non-toothed spacer, such that, in use, a first end of the cog, including one or more teeth of reduced height, may interact with the first annular member and a second end. of the cog, which is not provided with one or more teeth of reduced height, may interact with the second annular member. The one or more teeth having reduced height are half the height of the non-reduced-height teeth, which non-reduced-height teeth extend from the spacer to the face of the first end of the cog.  Preferably, the cog comprises a reduced-height tooth interspaced between each pair of non-reduced-height teeth.<br>
The dispensing apparatus may further comprise a container located in the housing of the dispensing apparatus.  The container is, preferably, pressurised. The container is locatable within the dispensing apparatus, such that the container is locatable within the holes/apertures of the at least two annular members.  In other words, the annular members surround at least part of<br><br>
the container when the -container  is  loaded within the dispensing  apparatus.<br>
According to  a  second aspect  of  the present  invention,, there  is  provided a  combination  comprising  an apparatus according tc the  first  aspect  of  the present  invention  and  a container located  in  the housing  of  the   apparatus.<br>
Preferably,   the  container  located in the   apparatus is pressurised.<br>
The  invention  also includes  combinations   substantially as herein  described,   with  reference  tc the  accompanying drawings.<br>

Figure 1 shows a dispensing apparatus, indicated generally at 1, having a cap 2, a fixing collar 3, a counter body 4, £ main body 5 and a dust cap 6.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show internal features of the dispensing apparatus of Figure 1, wherein the apparatus comprises, a first number ring 11 (first annular member), a cog 12/ a second number ring 13 (second annular member) and a valve stem receiving block 14.  A separate container of product 10 is also shown.<br>
Referring to Figures I to 5, the main body 5, which is substantially cylindrical, is provided with an elongate mouthpiece 20 at a lower end - in relation to the dispensing apparatus, - the end of which may be covered by the dust cap 6, and an open end 21 situated at the other and relative upper end of the main body 5 remote from the mouthpiece 20. The valve stem receiving block 14 is positioned within the main body 5 so that it may receive a valve stem 22 of the container 10 - which may be inserted into position through the open end 21 - and is positioned so that, when the apparatus 1 is actuated, the product is dispensed through the mouthpiece 20 and out of the dispensing apparatus.  The container 10 also comprises a metering valve which is retained by means of a ferrule 23.  A valve stem 22 extends from the metering valve so that metered doses of product can be dispensed therethrough on actuation of the valve mechanism.  The main body 5 also comprises a first functional part of a twist-fit' arrangement 24 located adjacent the open end 21.<br>
The counter body 4, which is substantially cylindrical, further comprises one or more apertures 30 through the side of the counter body 4 and an enlarged portion 31, and is<br><br>
oper: et -both relative upper and lower 'ends.  The -enla-rged portion 31, situated at the upper end thereof, - in relation to the dispensing apparatus - houses the cog 12 and the first and second number rings 11,13.  The axis of the cog 12 is offset from the axes of the numbered rings 11,13 so that the oog 12 can interact with both number rings 11,13 which are housed in the substantially cylindrical part of the counter body 4 without impeding axial movement of the container 10.  The cap 2 is positioned at the -upper end of the counter body 4 and overlies an upper end of the container 10.  The cap 2 is axially slidable within the counter body 4 so that it may interact with the first numb.er ring 11.  The cap 2 and first number ring 11 have co- '^"" operating formations 41 having angled abutment surfaces *"" which can interact with each other upon actuation of'the' apparatus 1.  Figures 6 to 8 show in more detail the co-' operating formations.  In particular, the cap 2, which is substantially cylindrical, is provided with one or more substantially triangular teeth 70 (angled abutment surfaces) , equally spaced around the outer circumference of the cap 2 and is open at a lower end 71, so that an end of a container 10 may be inserted therein.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, a container 10 loaded in the dispensing apparatus 1 is slidable through holes/apertures of the number rings 11,13 when the apparatus is" actuated.<br>
The first number ring 11 comprises at-least one notch 40 positioned on the outer edge thereof and angled abutment surfaces 41 which can co—operate with the corresponding substantially-triangular teeth 70 of 'the cap 2.  The first number ring 11 is also provided with a set of numbering from 0 to 9 for each notch 40, so that after the ninth actuation<br><br>
of the apparatus 1, the notch 40 is in position to interact with the cog 12.  In a preferred embodiment/ the number ring 11 will have three notches 40 and, so, will have three sets of numbering from 0 to 9.<br>
The cap 2, the cog 12 and the first and second number rings 11,13 are held within the counter body 4 by a fixing collar 3, which forms a push-fit connection with the upper end of the counter body 4.  The counter body 4 also comprises a second functional part of a twist-fit arrangement 25 situated internally and adjacent the lower-end of the counter body.<br>
The cog 12, as more clearly shown in Figures 4 and 5, is provided with a hole 53 situated in the centre thereof, and a plurality of teeth 50 outwardly-extending from the centre of the cog 12.  The cog 12 is rotatably mounted about a longitudinal axis through the hole 53.  Each alternate tooth 50 has a reduced-height in the direction of the longitudinal axis in that upper and lower edges of the teeth 50 are not inline with both upper and lower faces of the cog 12.  The cog 12 is, therefore, arranged so that when there are eight teeth 50 on a lower row of teeth 52, an upper row of teeth 51 has only four teeth 50.  The upper and lower rows of teeth 51,52 are arranged such that they interact only with the first and second number rings 11,13, respectively.  In an alternative, the upper and lower teeth 50 may be misaligned in the form of two distinct rows, or, indeed, the upper teeth 50 may be extensions of some of the lower teeth 50, as shown in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
The second number ring 13 is provided with a plurality of teeth 60, positioned adjacent an upper edge of the number ring 13, and numbering on the outside of the number ring 13.<br><br>
Th-e number-a-rrg-ranges from 0.0 tc 20, the distance between each number corresponding to the distance between two teeth 60.<br>
The apertures 30 are positioned such that numbering on the outside of the number rings 11,13 can be seen by a user. In an alternative embodiment, only numbering on the second number ring 15 is visible by a user through the apertures 30.  In a further alternative, numbering on the outside of the number rings 11,13 may be substituted for markings, such as variations of colours and/or tone, or, even, indicators such as Full, %, H, ^?, or Empty, for example.<br>
The main body 5 and the counter body 4 are connected together by means of a twist-fit arrangement using the "ferst and second functional parts 24,25 which hold the two bodies 4,5 together securely.  'The dust cap 6 is secured to the" mouthpiece 20 by means of a push-fit arrangement.       •"<br>
Referring to all the Figures 1 to 8, in use, a container 10 can be loaded into position within the apparatus 1 by twisting apart the counter body 4 and the main body 5 and pushing a container I'D, valve stem 22 first, into the --opening of the main body 21, and positioning the valve stem 22 into the valve stem receiving block 14.  Such loading inserts the container 10 through central holes/apertures of number rings 11,13 and, when loaded, the number rings 11,13 are located around the container 10.<br>
Actuation of the apparatus 1, by depression of the cap 2 in the direction of Arrow A, ' causes an amount of product to be dispensed from the container 10 by an opposite reaction force from the valve stem receiving block 14 acting on 'the valve stem 22, which is inwardly retracted relative to the remainder of the metering valve such that an amount<br><br>
of product  is  dispensed  from  the  valve   stem  22   through  the valve  stem receiving block  14,   from where  it is  dispensed as an  aerosol  through  the mouthpiece  20   and  inhaled  by  a user inhaling  on the mouthpiece  20.     Release  of the  cap  2   causes the  cap 2  and  the  container  10  to return  to  its   starting position,   owing  to  the  internal  spring bias  of  the metering valve,   ready for subsequent  dispensing.<br>
Each actuation  of  the   apparatus   1   causes  the  first number ring  11  to  incrementally rotate  in  only one  of  either direction of Arrow B  continuously owing to  engagement  of  the co-operating formations,   having angled abutment  surfaces, between the  cap  2   and the   first number  ring  11.<br>
Every ten actuations   of  the   apparatus  1   cause  a  notch 40  to pass  the  cog  12,   the   effect  of  this being that   a  tooth 50  of  the upper row  of  teeth  51  is   caught  in  the  notch  40  as it  rotates,   this  rotation   causes  a  corresponding  opposite rotation  of the  cog  12.,   the   second number  ring  13  being caused to rotate in the  same  direction  as  the  first number ring 11.     Therefore,   it  can be  seen  that  every  actuation  of the  apparatus  causes  the  value  of the numbering visible through the one or more  apertures  30  to be decreased  or augmented by a value  of  one.<br>

The fixing collar 3' is provided with internal flange portions 140, such that, the external flange portions 130 of the cap 2' interact with the internal flange portions 140 to retain the cap 2' and, therefore, the container..10, within the main body 5' when closed.  The fixing collar 3' is provided with a clear portion 30, or one or more apertures 30 through which portions provided with markings of number rings 11,13 are visible.  Preferably, the fixing collar 3' is provided with a projection 124 at the end of which is provided the clear portion 30 or one or more apertures 30.  This projection 124 extends into the region of the main body 5' into a correspondingly-shaped hole 125.  This arrangement provides the clear portion 30 or the one or more apertures<br><br>
30 at a position in the region of the main body 5' which allows viewing of the markings on the number rings 11,13.<br>
The fixing collar 3' , in coinbination with the cap 2' , provides e closure tc the upper end of the main body 5' , remote from the mouthpiece 20f .  In addition, the internal parts of the dispensing apparatus, for example, the number rings 11,13, the cog 12', the sleeve 100, and the container are held within the main body 5' by the fixing collar 3' and the cap 2' .<br>
In this alternative embodiment, the first number ring 11 may be provided with two rows of angled abutment surfaces 41 located on two different diameter portions of that number ring.  The angled abutment surfaces 41 of a larger diameter portion are indicated by reference 41a and those of a smaller diameter by reference 41b, as shown in Figure 16, in particular.<br>
The second number ring 13 is provided with an extended portion. 150 which is positioned to enable covering of the markings on the first number ring 11 when a container locatable in the housing is empty.  Advantageously, the extended portion 150 provides a clear indication to a user that the dispensing apparatus has provided its full-quota of dispensations.<br>
The cog 12', as shown in Figure 12 in particular, is provided with one or more teeth 50T separated by a non-toothed spacer 160, such that, a first end 161 of the cog 12', including one or more teeth 162 of reduced height, may interact with the first annular member 11 and a second end of the cog 163, which is not provided with one or more teeth of reduced height, may interact with the second annular member 13.  The one or more teeth 162 having reduced<br><br>
..height  are,,   typically,   half -the he.i;ght ,oi  the non-reduced-height  teeth/   which non-reduced-height  teeth extend  from the spacer   160  to  the  face  of  the   first   end   161 of  the  cog   12'.    Most preferably,   cog   12'   is  provided with  B reduced-height  tooth  162   interspaced between   each pair   of non-reduced-height  teeth.<br>
In use, this alternative embodiment of dispensing apparatus is actuated in £ similar manner to the first embodiment of dispensing apparatus . Additionally, the slots<br>
114	of  the  sleeve  100  slide  down the   internal  projections<br>
110  of  the main body  5'   during actuation and,   thus/   guiding<br>
the valve  stem 22   against  the  abutment   (not  shown)   within.,<br>
the elongate portion 121,     In  addition,   the  resilient .member<br>
115	of the  sleeve   100 "abuts the  static  abutment   surface ,113<br>
of the main body 5' .     Such abutment provides   increased<br>
resistance  to  actuation  above  the normal  resistance provided<br>
by the reaction-force  of the valve  stem 22  which must be-<br>
overcome before actuation can  occur.     Advantageously,   the<br>
resistance requires   a minimum actuation force   to  a be<br>
applied before actuation of the -dispensing  apparatus   occurs<br>
- which helps to standardise the dosage of pharmaceutical<br>
dispensed.	•  .<br>
The present  arrangement provides partial-incremental rotations  of the first number ring  11.     When the  dispensing apparatus  is .actuated - by a longitudinal  down-stroke  of  the cap 21   and the container  10 -  a first  angled abutment surface  70a  of .each  set  of portions  "70'. interacts with  at least  one  angled abutment  surface  4la  of  the  larger  diameter portion of  the  first number ring  11   to provide  a partial -incremental   rotation of  the  first  number  ring  11.     Further, during a  corresponding  reciprocal  up-stroke   of  the   cap  2'<br><br>
and the container 10, a second angled abutment surface 70b of each set of portions 70' interacts with at least one angled abutment surface 41b of the smaller diameter portion of first number ring 11 to provide a second and final partial-incremental rotation of the first number ring 11. Therefore, an augmented or decreased number is indicated to a user by a two-step rotation of the first number ring 11 upon actuation of the dispensing apparatus I1.<br>
As mentioned in relation to the previous embodiment, the number rings 11,13 surround or are located around the container 1', when the container 10 is loaded in the dispensing apparatus 1'.  Further, the sleeve 100 and the container 10 are slidable within the main body 5' and pass through the holes/apertures of the number rings 11,13.<br>
Whilst in the specific example details of the invention are discussed, it will of course be understood that minor variations in features are still considered to be covered by the same inventive concept.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the dispensing apparatus may comprise, say, three or more number rings: a first number ring for 'units', a second for 'tens' and a third for 'hundreds'.  Further cogs may be provided.' Subsequent number rings for 'thousands' and so on may also be added. The second and subsequent number rings are rotated by an<br>
arrangement as~ described herein (by a -cog-rotated -by a   	<br>
previous number ring), whereby ten incremental rotations of the previous number ring. - as started originally on the 'units' number ring by actuation of the apparatus -  causes an incremental rotation of the subsequent number ring.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
