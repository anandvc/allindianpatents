				<td>The present invention relates to inhalable pharmaceutical compositions containing<br>
(endo,syn)-(-)-3-(3-hydroxy-l-oxo-2-phenylpropoxy)-8-methyl-8-(l-methylethyl)-8-azoniabicyclo[3.2.1.]Octane salt<br><br>
The invention relates to (endo,syn)-(-)-3-(3-hydroxy-l-oxo-2-phenylpropoxy)-8-methyl-8-(1-methylethyl)-8-azoniabicyclo[3,2,1]octane salts.  These compounds are useful as bronchospasmolytics with a powerful and particularly long-lasting effect.  The invention further relates to the use of the salts in the manufacture of preparations for inhalation in the treatment of asthma, and a method of treating subjects in need of such treatment.<br>
The racemate of the above-mentioned compound (in the form of the bromide) is on sale under the name Ipratropium bromide as an active substance in anticholinergic drugs.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that the conditions of activity of the racemate, laevorotatory and dextrorotatory enantiomers are significantly different and have major peculiarities which differ substantially from the norm.  The eutomer (i.e. the enantiomer having the desired or sought activity) is the L-(-)-enantiomer. Receptor binding studies on CHO-HM receptors have shown that the L-(-)-enantiomer has approximately twice as high an affinity as the racemate.  This ratio corresponds to observations which have frequently been made when comparing the effects of enantiomers and racemates.<br>
However, we have most surprisingly found in the present case that in a comparison of the eutomer with the racemate in the weight ratio 1:2, administration by inhalation to the (anaesthetised) dog exhibits not only a higher potency, but also a considerably longer<br><br>
duration of activity.<br>
In one aspect, therefore, we provide salts of (endo, syn)-(-)-3-(3-Hydroxy-l-oxo-2-phenylpropoxy)-8-methyl-8-(1-methylethyl)-8-azoniabicyclo[3,2,1]octane with an enantiomeric purity of 90 to 100%.<br>
The diagram shown in Figure 1 gives the percentage inhibition of bronchospasm as a function of time.  The dotted line (curve B) represents the pattern for the (endo, syn)-(-)-3-(3-hydroxy-l-oxo-2-phenylpropoxy)-8-methyl-8-(1-methylethyl)-8-azoniabicyclo[3,2,1]octane and the continuous line (curve A) gives the pattern for the corresponding racemate, the hydrobromides having been used.  5 /zg of the pure L-(-)-enantiomer and, accordingly, 10 /xg of the racemate were administered. The experiment was carried out on five test animals using the pure L-enantiomer (BIIH 150 BR) whilst the racemate was administered to seven test animals.<br>
Figure 1 shows that the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm in the dog by the administration of the Ipratropium bromide aerosol (curve A) has reached a peak of about 55% after about 10 minutes and has fallen back to its initial level after 60 minutes.  The same quantity of eutomer (curve B), as contained in the racemate, achieves a 60% inhibition after about 10 minutes and does not fall back to its starting level for 180 minutes.<br>
The half-lives measured show that the eutomer BIIH 150 BR has a duration of activity which is approximately four times longer.<br>
The eutomer is obtained in substantially pure form from the racemate by combined application of high pressure liquid chromatography and recrystallisation.  The term<br><br>
"eutomer" for the purposes of the present invention also includes strongly concentrated products (over about 90%), preferably containing more than 95, and particularly more than 97% of the L-(-)-enantiomer.  The anion corresponds to the one in the starting compound. If desired, an exchange may be carried out.<br>
The Example which follows is intended to illustrate the preparation of the L-(-)- and D-(+)-enantiomer:<br>
18 grams of Ipratropium bromide are separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography over a Chiralcel OD column (250x20 mm) with a mobile phase composed of 600 hexane, 250 methanol, 150 ethanol and 1 saturated alcoholic NaBr solution (V:V:V:V, throughflow rate 6 ml/min., wavelength 254 nm; sensitivity 0.5 A.U.F.S, solution containing 1 g Ipratropium bromide/5 ml ethanol + 5 ml mobile phase + 2.5 ml cone, acetic acid).<br>
By repeated chromatography and recrystallisation from ethanol, the L-(-)-enantiomer, white crystals, m.p. 239-40°C (decomp.), specific rotation [a] g° = -24.06°<br>
(c = 1.014; H20), enantiomeric purity 97.4% (HPLC) and the D-(+)-enantiomer, white crystals, m.p. 238-39°C<br>
(decomp.), specific rotation [a]%° = +24.26° (c = 1.018; H2O), enantiomeric purity 98.9% (HPLC), are obtained. Elemental analyses and spectra indicate that these compounds are present.<br>
The L-(-)-eutomer in the form of the various salts, preferably the bromide, chloride or acetate salts, is suitable, by virtue of being an anticholinergic, for treating chronic obstructive bronchitis and asthma by inhalation, whilst side effects are largely excluded.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, therefore, we provide pharmaceutical preparations in a<br><br>
form suitable for inhalation which" include..'a compound of<br>
the invention, optionally: .together with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients -and/or carriers and/or, other<br>
active substances.	.<br>
For use, the active substance inay,.be processed with known excipiehta and/or carriers to form conventional galenic preparations,' e. CT.. 'solutions for inhalation, suspensions  in liquefied :propellant ga.ses, preparations containing liposomes or proliposomes, and powders for inhalation (optionally in capsules) for use in conventional inhalers.<br>
Accordingly,  there is provided inhalable pharmaceutical compositions, having  a  prolonged  period  of  activity, characterised in that they contain an (endo, syn)-(-)-3-' (3-Hydroxy-l-oxo-2;~    phenylpropoxy)-8-methyl-8-(1 ruethylethyl)-8-azoniabicyclo [3.2. 1] octane   salt   in   an enantiomeric purity of 90 to 100% for treating diseases of the respiratory tract.<br>
