This  invention  relates to an improved switched mode powers supply  circuit  for<br>
IGBTS and MDSFETS for industrial electronics applications-Fast solid-state switches like IGBTS (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) and MOSFETS (Metal Oxide Semi-Conductor Field Effect Transistor) Fig .1 (a ),1(b) are the most commonly used devices in modern power-electronic circuits. Many such circuits  require more than one solid state switch connected at different voltage potentials. The gate control signals required for turning-on and turning- off of these switches often need to withstand large voltage isolation of the order of several hundred volts and are required to deliver considerable amount of peak current (2 to 5 amps). PRIOR ART<br>
Presently  the gate drive ciruits which meet the voltage  isolation and the current requirement  appear to be  too expensive although being  used in many power electronic circuits.<br>
Some examples of such circuits are: Fly-back and Forward converters using two switches and diodes. The Fly-back and Forward converters are the most widely used circuits in several industrial applications requiring regulated DC output voltages, such as regulated DC power supplies, magnet power supplies, etc..<br>
Currently used techniques for isolated gate drives of MOSFETs and IGBTs can be broadly divided in two categories:<br><br>
2<br>
(a)	The ones that use at least one stage of  optical  isolation<br>
using  opto-isolators to provide ohimc (or  electrical  isolation<br>
between  any  two  isolated  gate  pulses.  These  often  require<br>
isolated  control  power supplies, one on the input side 'of  the<br>
opto-isolator  and one on the output side of  the  opto-isolator.<br>
Such  opto-isolators  need to have very fast  response  for  high<br>
frequency  operation.  Most often the output stage  of  the  fast<br>
acting  opto-isolators are not directly capable of supplying  (or<br>
receiving ) the required magnitude of gate current and hence  are<br>
followed by an ouput amplifier (or buffer stage).<br>
(b)	The second category of isolated gate drivers use  at  least<br>
one  stage of transformer type isolation using magnetic  circuits<br>
adding to the cost and weight. Such isolated driver circuits need<br>
to  be specially designed to minimize leakage inductance  of  the<br>
isolated  windings  so  that they can  supply  (or  receive)  the<br>
required magnitude of gate current at a fast rate and often  call<br>
for  the use of more cumbersome torroidal type of core  for  coil<br>
winding.  It  also  often  calls for the  use  of  bi-filar  type<br>
windings  requiring higher electrical insualtion of  the  winding<br>
wire. Yet another problem with the magnetic type isolation is the<br>
special (and often patented) techniques required to see that the<br>
magnetic core does not saturate for the required gate voltage<br>
pattern and the gate current magnitude, while keeping the size of<br>
the core small.<br><br>
3-<br>
There  are disadvantaoes associated with the present system of<br>
tho  gate  drive circuit (as described above)  which requires  a<br><br>
costly isolated gate driver for switches like MOSEFTs and  ISBTs. In  many applications, particularly in low  power  applications, the cost of the isolated gate drive circuit exceeds several- times<br>
the cost of the solid state switch itself.	<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	<br><br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to propose<br><br>
a novel and reliable switched mode power supply circuit that is cost-effective and efficient and applicable to some important category<br>
of power-electronic converters.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved switched mode power supply circuit  which costs significantly  lower  than  the<br>
presently used isolated gate drive circuits.<br>
Yet  another  object of the present invention is  to  propose  an<br>
improved switch mode power supply circuit which is effective  in  withstanding<br>
the required gate voltage isolation without causing any significant power loss or without compromising in the gate driving performance.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose an <br>
improved switched mode power supply circuit which  can supply  or  absorb  the<br><br>
desired magnitude of gate current for fast switching operation with low switching losses.<br><br>
4-<br>
Further  objects of the present invention is  to  propose  an improved  switched mode power supply circuit which, though not  a generic  type  but is applicable to a  very  important  high—tech power  electronic  converters. This includes  some  very  papular switched-mode  power supply (SMPS) circuits for  magnet  current control.<br>
According to the invention there is provided an improved switched mode power supply (SMPS) circuit of fly-back and/or forward type for industrial electronic application being connectable to an input supply voltage (E), comprising unisolated drive (2,3) connected to a first solid state switching device of MOFSET or IGBT switches (01) via two halves (RG1, RG2) of a gate circuit resistance, said  first switching device being operably connected to a second solid state switching device of MOFSET or ISBT switches (02); a fly-back inductor and/or forward converter transformer (4) disposed between said first and second switching devices, characterized in that an isolated gate driver (5,6) is interposed between said switching devices for generating isolated gate pulses capable to withstand a voltage potential difference which the source terminals of the said sol id state switches being subjected to, the isolated gate driver (5,6) comprising a capacitor (C), plurality of resistances (R1,R2,R3), and at least one voltage clamping device (zl).<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) and Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) are presently the most popular  switching  devices for  power-electronics  applications. They  are of different types but the most commonly used  ones  are shown  by their circuit symbols in Fig. l(a) and Fig.l)b).  These are  voltage-control led devices and are switched  (turned-on  or turned-off)  by  applying suitable magnitude of  voltage  signals (often  referred as gate pulses, gate signals or  gate  voltages)<br><br>
6<br>
across their Gate and Source (Emitter) terminals,. These gate voltages are of smal1 magnitudes (often less than twenty volts) and need to be below the maximum magnitudes specified by the device manufacturers. The above-mentioned devices (ISBTs) andi MOSFETs) are often required to switch very fast to reduce the switching related losses in the device (often known as switching lasses) . This calls for a fast rising (or fast falling,) gate pulse capable of supplying (or receiving) the required gate current quickly. These gate voltage signals are referenced with respect  to the source terminal of the above-mentioned  switching<br>
devices.  In many power—electronic applications more than one  of<br>
these  switches are used and the source ,terminals of these may  be<br>
at different voltage potentials (often this potential difference may be of several hundred volts) and in such cases the respective contrail ing gate pulses must also be able to withstand the voltage difference that the device source terminals are subjected to. Any two such gate pulses that are required to withstand the said voltage potential difference are referred here as isolated gate pulses and the circuit that generates these pulses are called as isolated gate drive circuits Fig.2(a) and Fig.2(b) show some representative power—electronic circuits that may use any one or both of the above mentioned swtiches and require gate pulse  isolation -  For  example,  in  Fig.2(a)  gate  pulses  for<br>
switches Ql, Q2or Q3 need to be isolated from each other       <br><br>
1 -<br>
similarly in Fig.2(b) gate pulses for switches Q1 and Q2 need to be isolated by at least thei.r input voltage magnitude (marked as 'E' in the figures).<br>
One illustrative example is the very popular switch fly-back type switched mode power supply circuit which has been schematically shown in Fig.3(a).<br>
This circuit is presently the most popular one in low power ranges (20 watts to 100 watts). The main advantage of this circuit is that it requires a single switch and hence there is no need for any isolated gate driver. The other advantages are its simple output filter and the ability of the circuit to work over a wide range of input voltage (with some compromise on the output power capability ). However, the circuit of Fig.3(a) has the following drawbacks: It requires high voltage rated switch (significantly higher than the maximum working input voltage) requires snubber circuits and has considerable snubber losses and has low efficiency. A two-switch version of the same fly-back circuit is shown in Fig.3(b) and is technically much superior to the one-switch version of Fig.3(a). It has almost all positive features of the one-switch version but without its drawbacks just mentioned (except that some minor re-design of the fly-back inductor transformer may be required to match the large operating input voltage range of the one-switch version). The voltage rating of the switch in the two-switch version need not be<br><br>
%<br>
signifieanly higher than the maximum input DC voltage and in most of the designs the combined cost of the two switches is likely to be less than the cost of the single switch of the circuit in Fig.3(a). The two-switch version need not have the snubber circuit and the related losses. Inspite of its relative merits the two-switch version is not the industry favourite (at least. for  low power ranges) because of two gate pulses need  to  have<br>
isolation between them and calls for an isolated gate driver.<br>
The gate drive circuit is shown within dotted lines marked (5,6) in<br>
	V<br>
 the   illustrative  power-electronic  circuits  of  Fig.4 (a)   and Fig.4(b).  The proposed driver circuit is well suited to  circuit topologies such as the one discussed in the previous section  and shown  in Fig,3(b). In Fig.3(b) (ie a two-switch fly-back  power supply ) the switches Ql and Q2 need to be turned-on and  turned— off  together.  Fig.4(a) and Fig.4(b) essentially  reproduce  the circuit  of  Fig.3(b) with the proposed  invention.  Fig.4(a)  is shown  to  use n-channel power MOSEFTs whereas Fig.4(b)  uses  p-channel  power  MOSEFTs.  The invention  is  applicable  to  gate controlled devices like MOSFETs and IGBTs of many different types and their combinatons. WORKING OF THE PROPOSED CIRCUIT<br>
The  working of the proposed circuit is explained here  with  the illustrative circuits of Fig.4(a) and Fig.4(b).<br><br>
9<br>
In  the circuit of Fig.4(a), a regular non-isolated  type  driver circuit  is  used  for the upper switch Ql.  For  proper  circuit<br>
operation  Ql  and Q2 need to be turned on and off  without  much<br><br>
time delay between them. In the proposed circuit, switching of Q1<br><br><br>
itself  is used for fast and reliable switching of Q2. After  the<br><br>
turning-on  of  Q1, Q2 turns—on almost  instantly  and  similarly<br><br>
turning-off of Q1 is almost immediately followed by the turning off of Q2- With the proper choice of the components shown in the proposed circuit, the time delay in the switching of Ql and Q2 can be kept within one micro—second or even lower and will  suit most of the intended applications. Let us consider in detail the working of the dotted portion of the proposed circuit in Fig.4(a). As 01 turns on the voltage between the drain and source terminals of Q1 collapses to a very Low value determined by the on-state voltage drop of the switch. As a result, the source potential of 01 is pulled close to the positive end of the input supply voltage (E). A sharp charging current flow through the capacitor 'C', R2 and R3 to charge the effective gate to source capacitor of the switch Q2. Value of resistor Rl is very high and as a result, current through resistor Rl is negligibly smal1 and is used mainly to compensate for lost charge due to leakage etc. As a result, the power loss in Rl is also negligibly small. Zl and Z2  are voltage—clamping devices such as a zener diode  connected<br><br>
10-<br>
as a signle diode or a combination of several of them together with any other kind of diode. These may be connected in parallel, anti-parallel, in series or in anti-series and may provide voltage clamping of desired magnitude in either direction. Further, in some designs, it may be sufficient to use just one of Zl and Z2. Finally, the clamping devices denoted by Zl and Z2 keep the applied source to gate voltage of switch Q2 under the desired limit. The choice of resistors R2 and R3 together with the choice of capacitance 'C' decide the peak gate  charging current and also decide the rate at which the gate capacitance is charged and need to be suitably chosen based on the given input voltage  range and on the switching device  characteristics.  The<br>
relative  position of 'C' , R2 and R3 may be altered and few  more<br>
resistors  and  capacitors may be added but  the  basic  circuit<br>
operation remains essentially same. Once the gate to source capacitor of switch Q2 is charged to the required voltage, switch Q2 turns-on and starts conducting along with switch Ql. A positive current starts flowing through the dotted end of the induetor-transformer connected between switches Ql and Q2 (called the primary winding). The charging of capacitor 'C' will stop once it is charged to its full magnitude, this voltage magnigude being decided by the input voltage and the clamping circuit denoted by Zl and Z2) voltage. The charge on the capacitor 'C' is<br><br>
11-<br>
maintained as long as Ql is; on (with Ql end of capacitor plate kept positive) . Once switch Ql is turned-off due to control section of its driver, the primary winding current of the transformer-inductor, mentioned above, flows through the capacitor 'C', R2 , R3 and through the gate to source capacitance of switch Q2 but the current direction now is reversed and the. action is to discharge the gate to source capacitor of Q2 and also to discharge the capacitor 'C' . The gate to source capacitor of Q2 may be discharged to zero or to a clamped negative value depdnding on the choice of the clampinct circuit denoted by Zl and Z2. The gate discharge current is once again limited by the choice of the proposed circuit components 'C', R2 and R3. If the load (denoted by the primary winding current of fly-back transformer) is in excess of this gate charge current diode Dl turns on to conduct the remaining magnitude of the inductive load current. With the turning on of diode Dl, any remaining charge on the gate circuit capacitance of Q2 and on the capacitor 'C' will discharge even faster and quickly conclude the turning-off process of Q2 . The next turning—on and turning-off cycle repeats as described before.<br>
A similar charging/discharging cycle repeats for the p-channel MOSEFT Ql shown in cicuit of Fig.4(b). Here, the lower switch Q2 is   driven  directly  and  the  proposed  circuit  is  able   to<br><br>
12-<br>
effactively  switch  the upper switch (Q1). The lower  switch  Q2 could be a p-channel switch or alternatively a n-channel switch. In most of the fly-back type power supplies (as shown in Fig.4(a) and Fig.4(b), the gate power of the directly driven switch  (such as  switch  Ql in Fig.4(a) and switch Q2 in Fig.4(b)) is  derived from  one  of  the floating outputs of the  switched  mode  power supply  itself  (the  starting power required  for   few  initial Switchings  is  derived from the input DC supply  'E'  through  a clamped low rating resistive-capacitive circuit) and as  such  it does  not make much difference if the directly driven  switch' is upper  switch  or lower switch. However, some  times,  especially when  a  separate  independent supply is used  for  the  directly driven  switch,  there may be common mode noise  present  in  the driving power supply. This problem is greatly reduced by dividing the  gate circuit resistance in two halves and putting one   half in series with the gate and other half in series with the  source end  of  the driver. The arrangement is being shown  in  Fig.4(a) where  RG1 and RG2 are the two halves of the gate circuit series resistor. The  arrangement  of  dividing the gate circuit series resistor  in the above manner is claimed as yet another  related invention by the inventors-<br><br>
13<br>
The invention relates not only to the fly-back circuit described above but is equally applicable to many other circuits, such as two switch forward converters and the two-switch magnet power supplies as they essentially have the same circuit topology. The invention may also be fully or partly applicable to some other circuit topologies not mentioned here.<br>
The invention described here inabove is in relation to a non-limiting embodiment used as defined by the accompanying claims.<br><br>
