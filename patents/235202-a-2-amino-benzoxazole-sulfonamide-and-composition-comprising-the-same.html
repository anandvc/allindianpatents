				<td>'The present invention relates to a 2-amino-benzoxa2ole sulfonamide and composition comprising the same.<br>
The present invention relates to 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamides, their use as aspartic protease inhibitors, in particular as broadspectrura HIV protease inhibitors, processes for their preparation as well as phartaaceuticai compositions and diagnostic kits comprising them. The present invention also concerns combinations of the present 2-aminobenzoxazole sulfonamides with another anti-retroviral agent It further relates to their use in assays as reference compounds or as reagents.<br>
The vims causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is known by different names, including T-lymphocyte virus III (HTLV-III) or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) or AIDS-related virus (ARV) or human immnnodeficieacy virus (HTV). Up until now, two distinct families have been identified i-e. HIV-l and HIV-2. Hereinafter, HTV will be used to generically denote these viruses.<br>
One of the critical pathways in a retroviral life cycle is the processing of polyprotein precursors by aspartic protease. For instance with the HIV virus the gag-pol protein is processed by HTV protease. The correct processing of the precursor polyproteins by the aspartic protease is required for the assembly of infectious virions, thus making the aspartic protease an attractive target for antiviral therapy. In particular for HTV treatment, the HTV protease is an attractive target<br>
HIV protease inhibitors (Pls) are commonly administered to AIDS patients in combination with other anti-HIV compounds such as, for instance mcleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs) or other protease inhibitors. Despite the fact that these antiretrovirals are very useful, they have a corranon limitation, namely, the targeted enzymes in the HTV virus are able to mutate in such a way that the known drags become less effective, or even ineffective against these mutant HTV viruses. Or, in other words, the HTV virus creates an ever increasiGg resistance against the available drugs.<br>
Resistance of retroviruses, and in particular the HIV virus, against inhibitors is a major cause of therapy failure. For instance, half of the patients receiving anti-HIV combination therapy do not respond fully to the treatment, mainly because of resistance of-the virus to one or more drugs used. Moreover, it has been, shown that resistant virus is carried over to newly infected individuals, resulting in severely limited therapy options for these drug-naive patients. Therefore, there is a need in the art ibr new<br><br>
compounds for retrovirus therapy, more particularly for AIDS therapy. The need in the art is particularly acute for compounds that are active not only on wild type HTV virus, but also on the increasingly more common resistant HTV viruses.<br>
Known antiretrovirals, often administered in a combination therapy regimen, will eventually cause resistance as stated above. This often may force the physician to boost the plasma levels of the active drugs in order for said antiretrovirals to regain effectivity against the mutated HTV viruses. The consequence of which is a highly undesirable increase in pill burden. Boosting plasma levels may also lead to an increased risk of non-compliance with the prescribed therapy. Thus, it is not only important to have compounds showing activity for a wide range of HIV mutants, it is also important that there is little or no variance in Hie ratio between activity against mutant HIV virus and activity against wild type HTV virus (also defined as fold resistance or FR) over a broad range of mutant HIV strains. As such, a patient may remain on the same combination therapy regimen for a longer period of time since the chance that a mutant HIV virus will be sensitive to the active ingredients will be increased.<br>
Finding compounds with a high potency on the wild type and on a wide variety of mutants is also of importance since the pill burden can be reduced if therapeutic levels are kept to a minimum. One way of reducing this pill burden is finding anti-HIV compounds with good bioavailability, i.e. a favorable pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile, such that the daily dose can be minimized and consequently also the number of pills to be taken.<br>
Another important characteristic of a good anti-HIV compound is that plasma protein binding of the inhibitor has minimal or even no effect on its potency.<br>
Thus, there is a high medical need for protease inhibitors that are able to combat a broad spectrum of mutants of the HIV virus with little variance in fold resistance, have a good bioavailability and experience little or no effect on their potency due to plasma protein binding.<br>
Up until now, several protease inhibitors are on the market or are being developed. One particular core structure (depicted below) has been disclosed in a number of references, such as, WO 95/06030, WO 96/22287, WO 96/28418, WO 96/28463, WO 96/28464, WO 96/28465 and WO 97/18205. The compounds disclosed therein are described as retroviral protease inhibitors.<br><br><br>
WO 99/67254 discloses 4-substituted-phen.yl sulfonamides capable of inhibiting multi-drug resistant retroviral proteases.<br><br><br><br>
Surprisingly, the 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamides of the present invention are found to have a favorable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile. Not only are they active against wild-type HIV virus, but they also show a broadspectrum activity against various mutant HIV viruses exhibiting resistance against known protease inhibitors.<br>

The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms. Such forms, although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The term stereochemically isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as used hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or in admixture with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term 'stereoisomerically pure1 concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i. e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms 'enantiomerically pure' and 'diastereomerically pure' should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric • excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess of the mixture in question.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers maybe separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary<br>
phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will he synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The diastereomeric racemates of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods which may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.<br>

These modulators include compounds that interfere with the metabolization at cytochromes, such as cytochrome P450. Some modulators inhibit cytochrome P450. It is known that several isoenzymes exist of cytochrome P450, one of which is cytochrome P450 3 A4. Ritonavir is an example of a modulator of metabolization via cytochrome P450. Such combination therapy in different formulations, may be administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially. Alternatively, such combination may be administered as a single formulation, whereby the active ingredients are released from the formulation simultaneously or separately. Such modulator may be administered at the same or different ratio as the compound of the present invention. Preferably, the weight ratio of such modulator vis-a-vis the compound of the present invention (modulator: compound of the present invention) is 1:1 or lower, more preferable the ratio is 1:3 or lower, suitably the ratio is 1:10 or lower, more suitably the ratio is 1:3 0 or lower.<br>
For an oral administration form, compounds of the present invention are mixed with suitable additives, such as excipients, stabilizers or inert diluents, and brought by means of the customary methods into the suitable administration forms, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard capsules, aqueous, alcoholic, or oily solutions. Examples of suitable inert carriers are gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose, or starch, in particular, corn starch. In this case the preparation can be carried out both as dry and as moist granules. Suitable oily excipients or solvents are vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod liver oil. Suitable solvents, for aqueous or alcoholic solutions are water, ethanol, sugar solutions, or mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols are also useful as farther auxiliaries for other administration forms.<br>
For subcutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds, if desired with the substances customary therefor such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or further auxiliaries, are brought into solution, suspension, or emulsion. The compounds of<br>
formula (I) can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained used, for example, for the production of injection or infusion preparations. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, physiological saline solution or alcohols, e.g. efhanol, propanol, glycerol, in addition also sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or alternatively mixtures of the various solvents mentioned.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical formulations for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the compounds of formula (I) or their physiologically tolerable salts in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents. If required, the formulation can also additionally contain other pharmaceutical auxiliaries such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers as well as a propellant. Such a preparation customarily contains the active compound in a concentration from approximately 0.1 to 50%, in particular from approximately 0.3 to 3% by weight.<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ a-, p- or y-cyclo-dextrins or their derivatives. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions. In the preparation of aqueous compositions, addition salts of the subject compounds are obviously more suitable due to their increased water solubility.<br>
Appropriate cyclodextrins are a-, p- or y-cyciodextrins (CDs) or ethers and mixed ethers thereof wherein one or more of the hydroxy groups of the anhydroglucose units of the cyclodextrin are substituted with Ci-galkyl, particularly methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, e.g. randomly methylated P-CD; hydroxyCi-eallcyl, particularly hydroxy-ethyl, hydroxypropyl or hydroxybutyl; carboxyCi-ealkyl, particularly carboxymethyl or carboxyethyl; Ci-gaBcyl-carbonyl, particularly acetyl; Ci-galkyloxycarbonylCi-fjalkyl or carboxyCi_fiallcyloxyCi.6alkyl, particularly carboxymethoxypropyl or carboxyethoxy-propyl; C^alkylcarbonyloxyCi-fialkyl, particularly 2-acetyloxypropyl. Especially noteworthy as complexants and/or solubilizers are P-CD, randomly methylated P-CD, 2,6-dimethyl-p-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-p-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-y-CD, 2-hydroxy- ' propyl-y-CD and (2-carboxymethoxy)propyl-p-CD, and in particular 2-hydroxy-propyl-p-CD (2-HP-0-CD).<br>
The term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two cyclodextrin hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example, hydroxy-propyl and hydroxyethyl.<br>
An interesting way of formulating the present compounds in combination with a cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof has been described in EP-A-721,331. Although the formulations described therein are with antifungal active ingredients, they are equally interesting for formulating the compounds of the present invention. The formulations described therein are particularly suitable for oral administration and comprise an antifungal as active ingredient, a sufficient amount of a cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof as a solubilizer, an aqueous acidic medium as bulk liquid carrier and an alcoholic co-solvent that greatly simplifies the preparation of the composition. Said formulations may also be rendered more palatable by adding pharmaceutically acceptable sweeteners and/or flavors.<br>
Other convenient ways to enhance the solubility of the compounds of the present<br>
invention in pharmaceutical compositions are described in WO 94/05263,<br>
WO 98/42318, EP-A-499,299 and WO 97/44014, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
More in particular, the present compounds may be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of particles consisting of a solid dispersion comprising (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) one or more pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liquid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, wherein one component is dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components. When said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermodynamics, such a solid dispersion is referred to as "a solid solution", Solid solutions are preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavailable to the organisms to which they are administered.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions which are less homogenous throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physically uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase.<br>
The water-soluble polymer in the particles is conveniently a polymer that has an apparent viscosity of 1 to 100 mPa.s when dissolved in a 2 % aqueous solution at 20°C solution.<br>
Preferred water-soluble polymers are hydroxypropj'l methylcelluloses or HPMC. HPMC having a mefhoxy degree of substitution from about 0.8 to about 2.5 and a<br>
hydroxypropyl molar substitution from about 0.05 to about 3.0 are generally water soluble. Methoxy degree of substitution refers to the average number of methyl ether groups present per anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxy-propyl molar substitution refers to the average number of moles of propylene oxide which have reacted with each anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule.<br>
The particles as defined hereinabove can be prepared by first preparing a solid dispersion of the components, and then optionally grinding or milling that dispersion. Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions including melt-extrusion, spray-drying and solution-evaporation, melt-extrusion being preferred.<br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the present compounds in the form of nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nm. Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those which physically adhere to the surface of the antketroviral agent but do not chemically bond to the antiretroviral agent.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the present compounds involves a pharmaceutical composition whereby the present compounds are incorporated in hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads, thus yielding a composition with good bioavailability which can conveniently be manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration.<br>
Said beads comprise (a) a central, rounded or spherical core, (b) a coating film of a hydrophilic polymer and an antiretroviral agent and (c) a seal-coating polymer layer.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof.<br>
The route of administration may depend on the condition of the subject, co-medication and the like.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention concerns a kit or container comprising a compound of formula (I) in an amount effective for use as a standard or reagent in a test or assay for determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit HTV protease, HIV growth, or both. This aspect of the invention may find its use in pharmaceutical research programs.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in phenotypic resistance monitoring assays, such as known recombinant assays, in the clinical management of resistance developing diseases such as HTV. A particularly useful resistance monitoring system is a recombinant assay known as the Antivirogram™. The Antivirogram    is a highly automated, high throughput, second generation, recombinant assay that can measure susceptibility, especially viral susceptibility, to the compounds of the present invention. (Hertogs K, de Bethune MP, Miller V et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 1998; 42(2):269-276, incorporated by reference).<br>
Interestingly, the compounds of the present invention may comprise chemically reactive moieties capable of forming covalent bonds to localized sites such that said compound have increased tissue retention and half-lives. The term "chemically reactive group" as used herein refers to chemical groups capable of forming a covalent bond. Reactive groups will generally be stable in an aqueous environment and will usually be carboxy, phosphoryl, or convenient acyl group, either as an ester or a mixed anhydride, or an imidate, or a maleimidate thereby capable of forming a covalent bond with functionalities such as an amino group, a hydroxy or a thiol at the target site on for example blood components such'as albumine. The compounds of the present invention maybe linked to maleimide or derivatives thereof to form conjugates.<br>
The dose of the present compounds or of the physiologically tolerable salt(s) thereof to be administered depends on the individual case and, as customary, is to be adapted to the conditions of the individual case for an optimum effect. Thus it depends, of course, on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the compounds employed in each case for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature and severity of the infection and symptoms, and on the sex, age, weight, co-medication, and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated and on whether the therapy is acute or prophylactic. Customarily, the daily dose of a compound of formula (I) in. the case of administration to a patient approximately 75 kg in weight is 1 mg to 3g, suitably 1 mg to Ig, preferably 3 mg to 0.5 g, more preferably 5 mg to 300 mg. The dose can be administered in the form of an individual dose, or divided into several, e.g. two, three, or four, individual doses.<br>

Antiviral analyses:<br>
The compounds of the present invention were examined for anti-viral activity in a cellular assay. The assay demonstrated that these compounds exhibited potent anti-HFV activity against a wild type laboratory HIV strain (HIV-1 strain LAI). The cellular assay was performed according to the following procedure.<br>
Cellular Assay Experimental Method:<br>
HIV- or mock-infected MT4 cells were incubated for five days in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitor. At the end of the incubation period, all HTV-infected cells have been killed by the reph'eating virus in the control cultures in the absence of any inhibitor. Cell viability is measured by measuring the concentration of MTT, a yellow, water soluble tetrazolium dye that is converted to a purple, water insoluble formazan in the mitochondria of living cells only. Upon solubilization of the resulting formazan crystals with isopropanol, the absorbance of the solution is monitored at 540nm. The values correlate directly to the number of living cells remaining in the culture at the completion of the five day incubation. The inhibitory activity of the compound was monitored on the virus-infected cells and was expressed as ECso and ECgo- These values represent the amount of the compound required to protect 50% and 90%, respectively, of the cells from the cytopathogenic effect of the virus. The toxicity of the compound was measured on the mock-infected cells and was expressed as CCso, which represents the concentration of compound required to inhibit<br>
the growth of the cells by 50%. The selectivity index (SI) (ratio CCso/ECso) is an indication of the selectivity of the anti-HIV activity of the inhibitor. Wherever results are reported as e.g. pECso or pCCso values, the result is expressed as the negative logarithm of the result expressed as ECso or CCso respectively.<br>
The SI for the tested compounds ranges between more than 10 up to more than 10000.<br>
Antiviral spectrum:<br>
Because of the increasing emergence of drug resistant HIV strains, the present compounds were tested for their potency against clinically isolated HIV strains harboring several mutations (Table 2 and 3). These mutations are associated with resistance to protease inhibitors and result in viruses that show various degrees of phenotypic cross-resistance to the currently commercially available drugs such as for instance saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir and amprenavir.<br>
Table 2 List of mutations present in the protease gene of the HIV strains (A to F) used .<br><br>

As a measure of the broad spectrum activity of the present compounds, the fold resistance (FR), defined as FR = EC5o(mutant strain)/EC5o(HTV-l strain LAT), was determined. Table 3 shows the results of the antiviral testing in terms of fold resistance. As can be seen in this table, the present compounds are effective in inhibiting a broad range of mutant strains: Column A: FR value towards mutant A, Column B: FR towards mutant B , Column C: FR towards mutant C, Column D: FR towards mutant D, Column E: FR towards mutant E, Column F: FR towards mutant F. The toxicity (Tox) is expressed as the pCCjo value as determined with mock transfected cells. Column WT displays the pECSO value against 'wild type HTV-LAI strain.<br>

Caco-2 permeability assay for intestinal absorption<br>
The permeability of different compounds is evaluated according to a Caco-2 test protocol as described by Augustijns et al. (Augustijns et al. (1998). Int. J. ofPharm, 166, 45-54) whereby, Caco-2 cells at cell passage number between 32 and 45 are grown in 24-well transwell cell culture plates for 21 to 25 days. The integrity of the cell monolayer is checked by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). The test is performed at pH 7.4 and at 100 [iM donor compound concentration. Successive samples are taken at the receptor side to calculate the cumulative amounts and the apparent permeability.<br>
Aqueous solubility at different pH levels<br>
The equilibrium solubility in simulated gastrointestinal solutions under thermodynamic conditions is a good measure for the solubility profile of the compound in the stomach and the different parts of the intestine. Simulated gastric fluid (SGF) (without pepsin) is set at pH of 1.5. Simulated intestinal fluids (SIF) (without bile salts) are set at pH 5, pH 6.5, pH 7 and pH 7.5. The experimental protocol uses 96-well flat-bottom microplates in which 1 mg of compound is added per well (stock solution in methanol) and evaporated to dryness. The compounds are resolubilized in SGF and SIF and incubated overnight on a horizontal shaking device at 37°C. After filtration, the compound concentrations are determined by UV-spectrophotometry.<br>
Oral availability in the rat and the dog<br>
The oral availability of a series selected compounds is evaluated in a standard set of kinetic experiments, primarily hi male and female rats and secondarily in male and female dogs. The compounds are formulated as a 20 mg/ml solution or suspension in DMSO, PEG400 or cyclodextin 40% (CD40%) in water. For most experiments in the rat, three dosing groups were formed: II single intraperitoneal dose at 20 mg/kg using the DMSO formulation; 21 single oral dose at 20 mg/kg using the PEG400 formulation and 3/ single oral dose at 20 mg/kg using the cyclodextrin formulation, hi the dog,<br>
only the oral route of administration is used. Blood is sampled at regular time intervals after dosing and serum drug concentrations are determined using a LC-MS bioanalytical method.<br>
Boosting the systemic bioavailability<br>
With the described type of compounds (protease-inhibitors), it is known that inhibition of the metabolic degradation processes can markedly increase the systemic availability by reducing the first-pass metabolism in the liver and the metabolic clearance from the plasma. This 'boosting' principle can be applied in a clinical setting to the pharmacological action of the drug. This principle can be also explored both in the rat or the dog by simultaneous administration of a compound that inhibits the Cyt-p45O metabolic enzymes. Known blockers are for example ritonavir and ketoconazole. Dosing a single oral dose of ritonvir (RTV) at 5 mg/kg in the rat and the dog may result in a marked increase of the systemic availability (reflected'by the increased AUC) of the compound of the present invention added.<br>
Protein Binding analyses:<br>
Human serum proteins like albumin (HSA) or a-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) are known to bind many drugs, which may affect the effectiveness of those compounds. The anti-HJV activity of the compounds was measured in the presence of human serum, thus evaluating the effect of the binding of the protease inhibitors to those proteins. MT4 cells are infected with HTV-1 LAI at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001-0.01 CCIDso (50% cell culture infective dose per cell., CCIDso). After 1 hour incubation, cells are washed and plated into a 96 well plate containing serial dilutions of the compound in the presence of 10% PCS (foetal calf serum), 10% PCS + 1 mg/ml AAG (tti-acid glycoprotein), 10% PCS + 45 mg/ml HSA (human serum albumin) or 50% human serum (HS). After 5 or 6 days incubation, the ECso (50% effective concentration in cell-based assays) is calculated by determining Hie cell viability or by quantifying the level of HIV replication. Cell viability is measured using the assay described above. Into a 96 well plate containing serial dilutions of the compound in the presence of 10% PCS or 10% PCS + 1 mg/ml AAG, HTV (wild type or resistant strain) and MT4 cells are added to a final concentration of 200-250 CCIDso/wesll and 30,000 cells/well, respectively. After 5 days of incubation (37°C, 5% CO2), the viability of the cells is determined by the tetrazolium colorimetric MTT (3-[4,5-DimethylthiazoI-2-yl]-2,5-di-phenyltetrazolium bromide) method (Pauwels et al. J Virol. Methods 1988, 20, 309321).<br>
Formulation of compound 3<br>
Compound 3 was dissolved in organic solvent such as ethanol, methanol or methylene chloride, preferably, a mixture of ethanol and methylene chloride. Polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone copolymer with vinyl acetate (PVP-VA) or hydroxypropyhnethylcelralose (HPMC), typically 5 mPa.s, were dissolved in organic solvents such as ethanol, methanol methylene chloride. Suitably the polymer was dissolved in ethanol. The polymer and compound solutions were mixed and subsequently spray dried. The ratio of compound/polymer was selected from 1/1 to 1/6. Intermediate ranges are 1/1.5 and 1/3. A suitable ratio was 1/6. The spraydried powder, a solid dispersion, was subsequently filled in capsules for administration. The drug load in one capsule ranges between 50 and 100 mg depending on the capule size used.<br>
