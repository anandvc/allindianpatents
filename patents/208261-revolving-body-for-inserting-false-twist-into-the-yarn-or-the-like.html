The invention relates to a revolving body with a circumferential surface and end faces and to a use for this revolving body.<br>
A revolving body of this kind is known, for example, from DE 25 08 567 and, in particular, as a revolving tube for producing a so-called false twist in a device for texturing textile yarns. In this case the yarn passes through the revolving tube in its longitudinal direction, although is guided around a mandrel disposed approximately in the centre of the tube. If the revolving tube is now made to revolve, the yarn is twisted. In order to thread in or introduce the yarn before texturing, it must be introduced into an axial hole at one end face of the revolving tube, looped once around the mandrel and guided out again.<br>
One disadvantage of revolving bodies of this kind therefore lies in particular in the fact that they may well be suitable for continuous processes, although this is not the case where yarn processing operations of short duration are concerned. In such cases too much time is taken up by threading one end of the yarn into the revolving tube. Although it would be possible to eliminate this disadvantage by means of an automatic threading device, this ultimately results in a very expensive solution to the problem.<br>
The invention as characterised in the claims therefore achieves the object of producing a revolving body into ►  which a test specimen or an elongate product can be introduced very easily, which is also suitable for automated introduction of the test specimen or product and which enables a high-grade twist to be inserted.<br><br>
This object is achieved by a revolving body comprising a groove for the test specimen or the elongate product which is to be processed and which is always simply referred to as test specimen in the following for the sake of simplicity, into which groove the test specimen can be introduced from outside. The test specimen is deflected away from the longitudinal axis of the revolving body either through the shape of the actual groove or through elements such as pins, webs, entrainment devices, etc. specially provided for this purpose. The groove is preferably open towards the circumferential surface and the end faces and is of a variable depth, which is greater in the region of the end faces and smaller in the region of the circumferential surface.<br>
The advantages achieved through the invention lie in particular in the fact that a revolving body of this kind can be produced by relatively simple working steps and is therefore not very expensive. It is in addition suitable for automatic introduction of the test specimen, as the latter can enter it from the circumferential surface. The test specimen can in this respect additionally be moved in its longitudinal direction, which means that a revolving body of this kind can also be subsequently brought into a process already running. Very high twist insertion degrees can be achieved with revolving bodies of this kind, for a so-called twist backlog extending beyond the revolving body is produced. The revolving body according to the invention also enables the extent of twist insertion to be easily adjusted. This is effected by co-ordinating the tension of the test specimen, the revolutions per minute of the revolving body and possibly also other influencing variables such as the form of the groove or the form of the deflection means.<br><br>
The invention is illustrated in detail in the following on the basis of an example and with reference to the accompanying figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of a revolving body,<br>
Figure 2 is another side view of a revolving body,<br>
Figures 3 and 4 are perspective views of a revolving body,<br>
Figure 5 shows a revolving body with a mounting and a drive and<br>
Figures 6 to 24 are further possible constructions of a revolving body.<br>
Figure 1 shows the revolving body 1 with its circumferential surface 2, which here is cylindrical, and plane end faces 3 and 4. A groove 5, 6 can be seen here from its open side. It extends from the end face 3 to the end face 4. Also shown are a test specimen 7 and a longitudinal axis 8 for the revolving body 1. The circumferential surface 2 is at a distance 21 from the longitudinal axis 8 in the region of the end face 3, 4 which is greater than a distance 2 0 as can be measured in a section 22 further away from the end faces 3 and 4. This results in shoulders 29 and 3 0 at the circumferential surface 2.<br>
Figure 2 shows the same revolving body 1 from a direction which is turned through 90° in relation to the direction according to Figure 1. Planes which are represented by lines 9 and 10 as well as 11 and 12 and which here are perpendicular to the plane of the drawing, for example, can be seen in this figure. The groove 6 is in this case bounded at the sides by the planes 9 and 10 and the groove<br><br>
5 by the planes 11 and 12, the planes 9 and 10 being inclined by an angle 13 and the planes 11 and 12 by an angle 14 towards the end faces 4 and 3, respectively. These planes 9 to 12 are also inclined towards the circumferential surface 2 and form with the latter an angle 15, for example. Assuming that here the line 16 represents a plane of symmetry of the revolving body 1, it can also be seen here that the planes 9, 10, 11 and 12 intersect the end faces 4, 3 in the region of this plane of symmetry 16.<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view, again of the revolving body 1. It is in particular evident in this case that the groove, here the groove 6, extends or can extend in the region of the end face 4 into the revolving body 1 as far as the region of the longitudinal axis 8, or even beyond this. However the groove 6 is not very deep in a region 17 of the circumferential surface 2, this being obvious from the fact that one side wall 18 of the groove 6 is very low. The groove 6 also passes into the groove 5 in this region 17, this taking place here in particular via a web 19 which, although here is part of the groove 5, 6, forms the actual means for deflecting the test specimen. The grooves 5 and 6 are staggered slightly in the region 17.<br>
Figure 4 shows the revolving body 1 from another side, from which further, third and fourth grooves 23, 24 are evident. These are disposed symmetrically with respect to the grooves 5 and 6 and serve to prevent unbalance, i.e. to provide mass balancing. The revolving body may obviously also be balanced by other means, thus rendering the grooves 23, 24 unnecessary.<br>
Figure 5 shows a device 2 5 for mounting and driving the revolving body 1. This comprises in particular two friction wheels or friction wheel pairs 26 and 27 with a drive 28. The revolving body 1 lies on the friction wheel pairs 26, 27 and is centred on the latter in its longitudinal<br><br>
direction via the shoulders 29, 30. The revolving body 1 is pressed against the friction wheel pairs 26, 27 by magnets 31, 32 transversely to the longitudinal direction. However the revolving body could also be pressed against the friction wheel pairs 26, 27 by a third wheel pair, which is not shown here, or another means.<br>
The invention operates in the following mode: The test specimen 7', which is moved longitudinally and which in this case is a yarn, for example, is guided from outside towards the circumferential surface 2 of the revolving body 1, so that the test specimen 7' is deflected by the revolving body 1. The revolving body 1 is then made to revolve by the friction wheel pairs 26, 27, while the test specimen 7' is preferably additionally guided laterally. As soon as the groove 5, 6 is next to the test specimen 7', this is drawn by the revolving movement and by its own longitudinal movement into the groove 5, 6 and thus into the revolving body 1, so that the test specimen 7' now takes up the position of the test specimen 7. The test specimen 7 now passes through the grove 5, 6, being deflected away from the longitudinal axis 8 at one point by approximately a distance 20. This causes the test specimen 7 to twist in a region 33 (Fig. 1) outside of the revolving body 1. The region 33 lies before the entry into the revolving body 1, which means that the test specimen 7 moves in the direction of an arrow 34.<br>
This twisting of the test specimen 7 before it enters the revolving body may be desirable when continuously measuring properties of the test specimen. These revolving bodies may therefore also be used when measuring filaments, yarns and other test specimens moving longitudinally, and not just when processing filaments, for example. The revolving body 1 may therefore be used for measuring purposes and for processing yarns, filaments, etc.<br><br>
The revolving body which has been described above and which is of a preferred design, may of course take on other forms, which are illustrated in the figures described in the following, while maintaining the essential features and function.<br>
Figure 6 shows a base body 35 for a revolving body which is likewise suitable for introduction between the friction wheel pairs 23, 24 of the device according to Figure 5, In this case the spacing of the friction wheel pairs would possibly have to be greater, as they would have to act on shoulders 36, 37 of the revolving body. Although it is not shown here, this base body 35 also comprises a groove which upgrades it to a revolving body.<br>
Figure 7 shows a straight, cylindrical revolving body 3 8 without shoulders but with a groove, although this is not evident here.<br>
Figure 8 shows a revolving body 3 9 comprising two conical circumferential surfaces 40 and 41 which intersect at a circle 42. A groove 43 is provided in the region of the circle 42, through which groove the test specimen passes, so that this is deflected and made to twist by the revolving body 39 revolving about its axis 46. This revolving body 39 co-operates with two rings 44 and 45, which are stationary with respect to the body and which centre the test specimen in the region of the axis 46.<br>
Figure 9 shows a cylindrical revolving body 47 with a straight groove 48, into which a means 49 for deflecting the test specimen is fitted. As shown by Figure 10, this means 4 9 may consist in deepening the bottom 5 0 of the groove 48 from a point 51 in the region of the circumferential surface 54 towards the end faces 52, 53 and thus deflecting the test specimen towards the circumferential surface 54.<br><br>
Figure 11 shows a revolving body 55 with a straight groove 56, which comprises a region 58 deflected in the direction of the circumferential surface 57. This region 58 can also be seen in Figure 12. Figure 11 shows how the groove 56 extends to the axis 59. Here too a means 60 for deflecting the test specimen into the region of the circumferential surface is provided, so that the test specimen is twisted as a result of the revolving body 55 revolving.<br>
Figure 13 again shows just a straight groove 61, and Figure 14 the same groove into which a baffle 62 is fitted. As the groove 61 does not in this case extend as far as the centre, the test specimen is deflected over the entire length of the groove 61 and twisted as a result of the revolving body revolving.<br>
Figure 15 shows a spiral groove 63 and Figure 16 an arcuate groove 64. Here too the two grooves 63, 64 extend into the centre, so that the operating mode corresponds to that of the revolving bodies according to Figures 13 and 14.<br>
Figure 17 shows another construction of a revolving body 65 with two short grooves 66,   67 and with an entrainment device 68 optionally provided for the test specimen. As the grooves 66,   61  are not formed such that the test specimen is held on the end faces 70 in the region of the axis 69, the known, axially disposed rings 71, 72 are provided.<br>
Figures 18 and 19 show a revolving body 73 with a spiral groove 74 and a hole 75. Here the groove 74 simply serves to introduce the test specimen from the circumferential surface into the hole 75, in which hole 75 a pin 76 around which the test specimen is guided is disposed. The test specimen is thus deflected away from the axis 77. The use of rings 78, 79 outside of the revolving body 73 is advisable here.<br><br>
figures 20 and 21 show a revolving body 80 according to Figures 18 and 19, with the difference that two, eccentrically directed entrainment devices 82, 83 are disposed in the bore 81 to deflect the test specimen.<br>
Figures 22, 23 and 24 show a revolving body 84 with two conical inner faces 85, 86. A pin 88 is set in the revolving body 84 near the entry 87, on which pin a displacement body 89 is pivotably mounted. An end piece 90 prevents the displacement body 89 from shifting axially on the pin 88.  During operation the test specimen is urged by the displacement body 89, which swings out under the effect of the centrifugal force, against the inner face 86 and is gripped lightly, so that the test specimen is twisted in the known manner.<br>
All the illustrated constructions comprise at least one groove into which the test specimen can be introduced from outside and which provides access to means for deflecting the test specimen. The test specimen may in this respect be deflected away from the axis directly by the actual groove or by other means, obtaining access to the said means via the groove. The illustrated revolving bodies are suitable for elongate test specimens which are moved longitudinally, so that the twist is influenced by the revolving movement of the revolving body and the longitudinal movement of the test specimen. All these revolving bodies are also suitable for inserting a twist in the test specimen in the processing sense, which means that the test specimen discussed here is then an intermediate product or is processed from a primary product into a product in the revolving body.<br><br><br><br><br>
