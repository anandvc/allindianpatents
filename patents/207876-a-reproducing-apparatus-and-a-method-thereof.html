THE PATENTS ACT 1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 ; rule 13]<br>
"A REPRODUCING APPARATUS AND A METHOD THEREOF"<br>
SONY CORPORATION, a Japanese company of 7-35, Kitashinagawa 6-chome, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a reproducing apparatus and a reproducing method for checking forged information of a file recorded in a detachable memory card. Description of the Related Art<br>
EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM) that is an electrically rewritable memory requires a large space because each bit is composed of two transistors.  Thus, the integration of EEPROM is restricted.  To solve this problem, a flash memory that allows one bit to be accomplished with one transistor using all-bit-erase system has been developed.  The flash memory is being expected as a successor of conventional record mediums such as magnetic disks and. optical discs.<br>
A memory card using a flash memory is also known.  The memory card can be freely attached to an apparatus and detached therefrom.  A digital audio recording/reproducing apparatus that uses a memory card instead of a conventional CD (Compact Disc: Trademark) or MD (Mini Disc: Trademark) can be accomplished.<br>
On the other hand, as audio/video information is digitized and used for multi-media, the copyright protection thereof is becoming important.  In the field<br><br>
of information services, the user will be provided with a record medium on which digitized audio/video information having particular reproduction limitation information has been recorded.  In addition, digitized audio/video information having particular reproduction limitation information will be circulated to the user through digital broadcast and Internet.  The user can reproduce provided or circulated audio/video information (contents) for the duration or the number of times represented by the reproduction limitation information.  When necessary, the user can record desired audio/video information to a memory card at a predetermined cost.<br>
Although a file containing reproduction limitation information is easily recorded and stored, if the reproduction limitation information is forged with a particular means, the reproducing side cannot detect the forged reproduction limitation information. As a simple method for detecting forged reproduction limitation information, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) and a value obtained therewith can be used.  However, after reproduction limitation information has been forged, if CRC is forged, the forged reproduction limitation information cannot be detected.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a reproducing apparatus and a reproducing<br><br>
method that allow forged reproduction limitation information to be securely detected and contents to be prevented from being reproduced.<br>
A first aspect of the present invention is a reproducing apparatus for reproducing data from a record medium having a program area and a management area, the program area being used for recording a plurality of files, the management area being used for managing forging prohibition information against a particular file recorded in the program area, the apparatus comprising a calculating means for calculating the forging prohibition information managed in the management area of the record medium whenever a file recorded in the recorde medium is reproduced, a comparing means for comparing a value calculated by the calculating means corresponding to a former reproduction command with a value calculated by the calculating means corresponding to a current reproduction command, and a controlling means for permitting the file corresponding to the current reproduction command to be reproduced when the value calculated corresponding to the former reproduction command is the same as the value calculated corresponding to the current reproduction command as the result of the comparing means.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention is a reproducing apparatus for reproducing a file from a<br><br>
record medium on which a main file and a reproduction management file are recorded, the main file having an attribute header for managing forging prohibition information, the reproduction management file being used for managing at least clock information, the apparatus comprising a calculating means for calculating the forging prohibition information managed in a management area of the record medium using a predetermined function whenever the main file recorded on the record medium is reproduced and for calculating the clock information using the predetermined function whenever the clock information is updated, a first comparing means for comparing a value calculated by the calculating means corresponding to a former reproduction command with that corresponding to a current reproduction command, a second comparing means for comparing a value calculated by the calculating means corresponding to former clock information with a value calculated by the calculating means corresponding to current clock information, and a controlling means for permitting the main file to be reproduced when the value calculated corresponding to the former reproduction command is the same as that corresponding to the current reproduction command as the result of the first comparing means or when the value calculated corresponding to the former clock information is the same ^s that corresponding to the current clock<br><br>
information as the result of the second comparing means.<br>
In this case, when the number of reproduction times CT of the track is zero (namely, CT = 0) and the number of reproduction permission times MT is a predetermined value (namely, MT is any positive integer larger than zero), it is determined that the reproducing operation is performed the number of reproduction permission times.  Thus, the reproducing operation of the track is prohibited.<br>
These and other objects, features and 	<br>
advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in light of the following detailed description of a best mode embodiment thereof, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Next, an embodiment of the present invention will be described.  Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the structure of a digital audio recorder/player using a memory card according to an embodiment of the present invention.  The digital audio recorder/player records and reproduces a digital audio signal using a detachable memory card.  In reality, the recorder/player composes an audio system along with an amplifying unit, a speaker, a CD player, an MD recorder, a tuner, and so forth.  However, it should be noted that the present invention can be applied to other audio recorders.  In other words, the present invention can be applied to a portable recording/reproducing apparatus.  In addition, the present invention can be applied to a fset top box that records a digital audio data that is circulated as a satellite data communication, a digital broadcast, or Internet.  Moreover, the present invention can be applied to a system that records/reproduces moving picture data and still picture data rather than audio data.  The system according to the embodiment of the<br><br>
present invention can record and reproduce additional information such as picture and text other than a digital audio signal.<br>
The recording/reproducing apparatus has an audio encoder/decoder IC 10, a security IC 20, a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) 30.  Each of these devices is composed of a one-chip IC.  The<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus has a detachable memory card 40.  The one-chip IC of the memory card 40 has flash memory (nonvolatile memory), a memory control block, and a security block.  The security block has a DES (Data Encryption Standard) encrypting circuit. According to the embodiment, the recording/reproducing apparatus may use a microcomputer instead of the DSP 30.      The audio encoder/decoder IC 10 has an audio interface 11 and an encoder/decoder block 12.  The encoder/decoder block 12 encodes a digital audio data corresponding to a highly efficient encoding method and writes the encoded data to the memory card 40.  In addition, the encoder/decoder block 12 decodes encoded data that is read from the memory card 40.  As the highly efficient encoding method, the ATRAC3 format that is a modification of the ATRAC (Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding) format used in Mini-Disc is used.<br>
In the ATRAC3 format, audio data sampled at 44.1 kHz and quantized with 16 bits is highly efficiently encoded.  In the ATRAC3 format, the minimum<br><br>
data unit of audio data that is processed is a sound unit (SU).  1 SU is data of which data of 1024 samples (1024 x 16 bits x 2 channels) is compressed to data of several hundred bytes.  The duration of 1 SU is around 23 msec.  In the highly efficient encoding method, the data amount of audio data is compressed to data that is around 10 times smaller than that of original data.  As with the ATRAC1 format used in Mini-Disc, the audio signal compressed and decompressed corresponding to the ATRAC3 format less deteriorates in the audio quality.<br>
A line input selector 13 selectively supplies the reproduction output signal of an MD, the output signal of a tuner, or a reproduction output signal of a tape to an A/D converter 14.  The A/D converter 14 converts the input line signal to a digital audio signal (sampling frequency = 44.1 kHz; the number of quantizing bits = 16). A digital input selector 16 selectively supplies a digital output signal of an MD, a CD, or a CS (Satellite Digital Broadcast) to a digital input receiver 17.  The digital input signal is transmitted through for example an optical cable.  An output signal of the digital input receiver 17 is supplied to a sampling rate converter 15.  The sampling rate converter 15 converts the digital input signal into a digital audio signal (sampling frequency =44.1 kHz; the number of quantizing bits = 16).<br>
The encoder/decoder block 12 of the audio<br><br>
encoder/decoder IC 10 supplies encoded data to a DES encrypting circuit 22 through an interface 21 of the security IC 20.  The DES encrypting circuit 22 has a FIFO 23.  The DES encrypting circuit 22 is disposed so as to protect the copyright of contents.  The memory card 40 also has a DES encrypting circuit.     The DES encrypting circuit 22 of the recording/reproducing apparatus has a plurality of master keys and an apparatus-unique storage key.  The DES encrypting circuit 22 also has a random number generating circuit. The DES encrypting circuit 22  can share an authenticating process and a session key with the memory card 40 that has the DES encrypting circuit.  In addition, the DES encrypting circuit 22 can re-encrypt data with the storage key of the DES encrypting circuit.<br>
The encrypted audio data that is output from the DES encrypting circuit 22 is supplied to a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) 30.  The DSP 30 communicates with the memory card 40 through an interface.  In this example, the memory card 40  is attached to an attaching/detaching mechanism (not shown) of the recording/reproducing apparatus.  The DSP 30 writes the encrypted data to the flash memory of the memory card 40.  The encrypted data is serially transmitted between the DSP 30  and the memory card 40.  In addition, an external SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) 31 is<br><br>
connected to the DSP 30.  The SRAM 31 provides the recording/reproducing apparatus with a sufficient storage capacity so as to control the memory card 40. A bus interface 32 is connected to the DSP 30.  Data is supplied from an external controller (not shown) to the DSP 30 through a bus 33.  The external controller controls all operations of the audio system. The external controller supplies data such as a record command or a reproduction command that is generated corresponding to a user's operation through an operation portion to the DSP 30 through the bus interface 32.  In addition, the external controller supplies additional information such as image information and character information to the DSP 30 through the bus interface 32.  The bus 33 is a bidirectional communication path.  Additional information that is read from the memory card 40 is supplied to the external controller through the DSP 30, the bus interface 32, and the bus 33.  In reality, the external controller is disposed in for example an amplifying unit of the audio system.  In addition, the external controller causes a display portion to display additional information, the operation state of the recorder, and so forth.  The display portion is shared by the audio system.  Since data that is exchanged through the bus 33 is not copyright protected data, it is not encrypted.<br><br>
The encrypted audio data that is read from the memory card 40 by the DSP 30 is decrypted by the security IC 20.  The audio encoder/decoder IC 10 decodes the encoded data corresponding to the ATRAC3 format.  Output data of the audio encoder/decoder 10 is supplied to a D/A converter IS,     The D/A converter 18 converts the output data of the audio encoder/decoder 10 into an analog signal.  The analog audio signal is supplied to a line output terminal 19.<br>
The analog audio signal is supplied to an amplifying unit (not shown) through the line output terminal 19.  The analog audio signal is reproduced from a speaker or a head set.  The external controller supplies a muting signal to the D/A converter 18.  When the muting signal represents a mute-on state, the external controller prohibits the audio signal from being output from the line output terminal 19.<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing the internal structure of the DSP 30.  Referring to Fig. 2, the DSP 30 comprises a core 34, a flash memory 35, an SRAM 36, a bus interface 37, a memory card interface 38, and inter-bus bridges.  The DSP 30 has the same function as a microcomputer.  The core 34 is equivalent to a CPU.  The flash memory 35 stores a program that causes the DSP 30 to perform predetermined processes. The- SRAM 36  and the external SRAM 31 are used as a RAM of the recording/reproducing apparatus.<br><br>
The DSP 30 controls a writing process for writing encrypted audio data and additional information to the memory card 40 corresponding to an operation signal such as a record command received through the bus interfaces 32 and 37 and a reading process for reading them therefrom.     In  other words,   the DSP 3D  is disposed between the application software side of the audio system that records/reproduces audio data and additional information and the memory card 40.  The DSP 30 is operated when the memory card 40 is accessed.  In addition, the DSP 30 is operated corresponding to software such as a file system.<br>
The DSP 30 manages files stored in the memory card 40 with the FAT system used in conventional personal computers.  In addition to the file system, according to the embodiment of the present invention, a management file is used.  The management file will be descried later.  The management file is used to manage data files stored in the memory card 40.  The management file as the first file management information is used to manage audio data files.  On the other hand, the FAT as the second file management information is used to mange all files including audio data files and management files stored in the flash memory of the^memory card 40.  The management file is stored in the memory card 40.     The FAT is written to the flash memory along with the route directory and so<br><br>
forth before the memory card 40 is shipped.  The details of the FAT will be described later.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, to protect the copyright of data, audio data that has been compressed corresponding to the ATRAC3 format is encrypted.  On the other hand, since it is not necessary to protect the copyright of the management file, it is not encrypted.  There are two types of memory cards that are an encryption type and a non-encryption type.  However, a memory card for use with the recorder/player that records copyright protected data is limited to the encryption type.<br>
Voice data and image data that are recorded by users are recorded on non-encryption type memory cards.<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing the internal structure of the memory card 40.  The memory card 40 comprises a control block 41 and a flash memory 42 that are structured as a one-chip IC.  A bidirectional serial interface is disposed between the DSP 30 of the recorder/player and the memory card 40. The bidirectional serial interface is composed of ten lines that are a clock line SCK for transmitting a clock signal that is transmitted along with data, a status line SBS for transmitting a signal that represents a status, a data line DIO for transmitting data, an interrupt line INT, two GND lines, two INT<br><br>
lines, and two reserved lines.<br>
The clock line SCK is used for transmitting a clock signal in synchronization with data.  The status line SBS is used for transmitting a signal that represents the status of the memory card 40.  The data line DIO is used for inputting and outputting a command and encrypted audio data.  The interrupt line INT is used for transmitting an interrupt signal that causes the memory card 40 to interrupt the DSP 30 of the recorder/player.  When the memory card 40 is attached to the recorder/player, the memory card 40 generates the interrupt signal.  However, according to the embodiment of the present invention, since the interrupt signal is transmitted through the data line DIO, the interrupt line INT is grounded.<br>
A serial/parallel converting, parallel/serial converting, and interface block (S/P, P/S, I/F block) 43 is an interface disposed between the DSP 30 of the recorder/player and the control block 41 of the memory card 40.  The S/P, P/S, and IF block 43 converts serial data received from the DSP 30 of the recorder/player into parallel data and supplies the parallel data to the control block 41.  In addition, the S/P, P/S, and IF block 43 converts parallel data received from the control block 41 into serial data and supplies the serial data to the DSP 30.  When the S/P, P/S, and IF block 4 3 receives a command and data through the data<br><br>
line DIO, the S/P, P/S, and IF block 43 separates them into these that are normally accessed to the flash memory 42 and those that are encrypted.<br>
In the format of which data is transmitted through the data line DIO, after a command is transmitted, data is transmitted.  The S/P, P/S, and IF block 43 detects the code of a command and determines whether the command and data are those that are normally accessed or those that are encoded. Corresponding to the determined result, the S/P, P/S, and IF block 43 stores a command that is normally accessed to a command register 44 and stores data that is normally accessed to a page buffer 45 and a write register 46.  In association with the write register 46, the memory card 40 has an error correction code encoding circuit 47.  The error correction code encoding circuit 47 generates a redundant code that is an error correction code for data temporarily stored in the page buffer 45.<br>
Output data of the command register 44, the page buffer 45, the write register 46, and the error correction code encoding circuit 47 is supplied to a flash memory interface and sequencer (hereinafter, referred to as memory I/F and sequencer) 51.  The memory IF and sequencer 51 is an interface disposed between the control block 41 and the flash memory 42 and controls data exchanged therebetween.  Data is<br><br>
written to the flash memory through the memory IF and sequencer 51.<br>
Audio data that has been compressed corresponding to the ATRAC3 format and written to the flash memory (hereinafter, this audio data is referred to as ATRAC3 data) is encrypted by the security IC 20 of the recorder/player and the security block 52 of the memory card 40 so as to protect the copyright of the ATRAC3 data.  The security block 52 comprises a buffer memory 53, a DES encrypting circuit 54, and a nonvolatile memory 55.<br>
The security block 52 of the memory card 40 has a plurality of authentication keys and a unique storage key for each memory card.  The nonvolatile memory 55 stores a key necessary for encrypting data. The key stored in the nonvolatile memory 55 cannot be analyzed.  According to the embodiment, for example, a storage key is stored in the nonvolatile memory 55. The security block 52 also has a random number generating circuit.  The security block 52 authenticates an applicable recorder/player and shares a session key therewith.  In addition, the security block 52 re-encrypts contents with the storage key through the DSE encrypting circuit 54.<br>
For example, when the memory card 40 is attached to the recorder/player, they are mutually authenticated.  The security IC 20 of the<br><br>
recorder/player and the security block 52 of the memory card 40 mutually authenticate.  When the recorder/player has authenticated the attached memory card 40 as an applicable memory card and the memory card 40 has authenticated the recorder/player as an applicable recorder/player, they are mutually authenticated.  After the mutual authenticating process has been successfully performed, the recorder/player and the memory card 40 generate respective session keys and share them with each other.  Whenever the recorder/player and the memory card A0  authenticate each other, they generate respective session keys.<br>
When contents are written to the memory card 40, the recorder/player encrypts a contents key with a session key and supplies the encrypted data to the memory card 40.  The memory card 40 decrypts the contents key with the session key, re-encrypts the contents key with a storage key, and supplies the contents key to the recorder/player.  The storage key is a unique key for each memory card 40.  When the recorder/player receives the encrypted contents key, the recorder/player performs a formatting process for the encrypted contents key, and writes the encrypted contents key and the encrypted contents to the memory card 40.<br>
In the above section, the writing process for the memory card 40 was described.  In the following,<br><br>
the reading process for the memory card 40 will be described.  Data that is read from the flash memory 42 is supplied to the page buffer 45, the read register 48, and the error correction circuit 4 9 through the memory IF and the sequencer 51.  The error correcting circuit 49 corrects an error of the data stored in the page buffer 45.  Output data of the page buffer 45 that has been error-corrected and the output data of the read register 48 are supplied to the S/P, P/S, and IF block 43.  The output data of the S/P, P/S, and IF block 43 is supplied to the DSP 30 of the recorder/player through the above-described serial interface.<br>
When data is read from the memory card 40, the contents key encrypted with the storage key and the contents encrypted with the block key are read from the flash memory 42.  The security block 52 decrypts the contents key with the storage key.  The security block 52 re-encrypts the decrypted content key with the session key and transmits the re-encrypted contents key to the recorder/player.  The recorder/player decrypts the contents key with the received session key and generates a block key with the decrypted contents key. The recorder/player successively decrypts the encrypted ATRAC3 data.<br>
A config. ROM 50 is a memory that stores partition information, various types of attribute<br><br>
information, and so forth of the memory card 40.  The memory card 40 also has an erase protection switch 60. When the switch 60 is in the erase protection position, even if a command that causes the memory card 40 to erase data stored in the flash memory 42 is supplied from the recorder/player side to the memory card 40, the memory card 40 is prohibited from erasing the data stored in the flash memory 42.  An OSC cont. 61 is an oscillator that generates a clock signal that is the reference of the timing of the process of the memory card 40.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram showing the hierarchy of the processes of the file system of the computer system that uses a memory card as a storage medium.  On the hierarchy, the top hierarchical level is an application process layer.  The application process layer is. followed by a file management process layer, a logical address management layer, a physical address management layer, and a flash memory access layer.  In the above-mentioned hierarchical structure, the file management process layer is the FAT file system.  Physical addresses are assigned to individual blocks of the flash memory.  The relation between the blocks of the flash memory and the physical addresses thereof does not vary.  Logical addresses are addresses that are logically handled on the file management process layer.<br><br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic diagram showing the physical structure of data handled in the flash memory 42 of the memory card 40.  In the memory 42, a data unit (referred to as segment) is divided into a predetermined number of blocks (fixed length).  One block is divided into a predetermined number of pages (fixed length).  In the flash memory, data is erased as each block at a time.  Data is written to the flash memory 42 or read therefrom as a page at a time.  The size of each block is the same.  Likewise, the size of each page is the same. One block is composed of page 0 to page m.  For example, one block has a storage capacity of for example 8 KB (kilobytes) or 16 KB.  One page has a storage capacity of 512 B (bytes).  When one block has a storage capacity of 8 KB, the total storage capacity of the flash memory 42 is 4 MB (512 blocks) or 8 MB (1024 blocks).  When one block has a storage capacity of 16 KB, the total stdrage capacity of the flash memory 42 is 16 MB (1024 blocks), 32 MB (2048 blocks), or 64 MB (4096 blocks).<br>
One page is composed of a data portion of 512 bytes and a redundant portion of 16 bytes.  The first three bytes of the redundant portion is an overwrite portion that is rewritten whenever data is updated. The first three bytes successively contain a block status area, a page status area, and an update status area.  The remaining 13 bytes of the redundant portion<br><br>
are fixed data that depends on the contents of the data portion.  The 13 bytes contain a management flag area (1 byte), a logical address area (2 bytes), a format reserve area (5 bytes),,, a dispersion information ECC area (2 bytes), and a data ECC area (3 bytes).  The dispersion information ECC area contains redundant data for an error correction process against the management flag area, the logical address area, and the format reserve area.  The data ECC area contains redundant data for an error correction process against 512-byte data.<br>
The management flag area contains a system flag (1: user block, 0: boot block), a conversion table flag (1: invalid, 0: table block), a copy prohibition flag (1: OK, 0: NG), and an access permission flag (1: free, 0: read protect).<br>
The first two blocks - blocks 0 and 1 are boot blocks.  The block 1 is a backup of the block 0. The boot blocks are top blocks that are valid in the memory card.  When the memory card is attached to the recorder/player, the boot blocks are accessed at first. The remaining blocks are user blocks.  Page 0 of the boot block contains a header area, a system entry area, and a boot and attribute information area.  Page 1 of the boot block contains a prohibited block data area. Page 2 of the boot block contains a CIS (Card Information Structure)/IDI (identify Drive Information)<br><br>
area.<br>
The header area of the boot block contains a boot block ID and the number of effective entries.  The system entries are the start position of prohibited block data, the data size thereof, the data type thereof, the data start position of the CIS/IDI area, the data size thereof, and the data type thereof.  The boot and attribute information contains the memory card type (read only type, rewritable type, or hybrid type), the block size, the number of blocks, the number of total blocks, the security/non-security type, the card fabrication data (date of fabrication), and so forth.<br>
Since the flash memory has a restriction for the number of rewrite times due to the deterioration of the insulation film, it is necessary to prevent the same storage area (block) from being concentratedly accessed.  Thus, when data at a particular logical address stored at a particular physical address is rewritten, updated data of a particular block is written to a non-used block rather than the original block.  Thus, after data is updated, the relation between the logical address and the physical address changes.  This process is referred to as swap process. Consequently, the same block is prevented from being concentratedly accessed.  Thus, the service life of the flash memory can be prolonged.<br><br>
The logical address associates with data written to the block.  Even if the block of the original data is different from the block of updated data, the address on the FAT does not change.  Thus, the same data can be properly accessed.  However, since the swap process is performed, a conversion table that correlates logical addresses and physical addresses is required (this table is referred to as logical-physical address conversion table).  With reference to the logical-physical address conversion table, a physical address corresponding to a logical address designated on the FAT is obtained.  Thus, a block designated with a physical address can be accessed.<br>
The DSP 30 stores the logical-physical address conversion table in the SRAM.  When the storage capacity of the RAM is small, the logical-physical address conversion table can be stored to the flash memory.  The logical-physical address conversion table correlates logical addresses (2 bytes) sorted in the ascending order with physical addresses (2 bytes). Since the maximum storage capacity of the flash memory is 128 MB (8192 blocks), 8192 addresses can be assigned with two bytes.  The logical-physical address conversion table is managed for each segment.  Thus, the size of the logical-physical address conversion table is proportional to the storage capacity of the flash memory.  When the storage capacity of the flash<br><br>
memory is 8 MB (two segments), two pages are used as the logical-physical address conversion table for each of the segments.  When the conversion table is stored in the flash memory, a predetermined one bit of the management flag area in the redundant portion in each page represents whether or not the current block is a block containing the logical-physical address conversion table.<br>
The above-described memory card can be used with the FAT file system of a personal computer system as with the disc shaped record medium.  The flash memory has an IPL area, a FAT area, and a route directory area (not shown in Fig. 5).  The IPL area contains the address of a program to be initially loaded to the memory of the recorder/player.  In addition, the IPL area contains various types of memory information.  The FAT area contains information with respect to blocks (clusters).  The FAT has defined unused blocks, next block number, defective blocks, and last block number.  The route directory area contains directory entries that are a file attribute, an update date [day, month, year], file size, and so forth.<br>
Next, with reference to Fig. 6, a managing method using the FAT table will be described.<br>
Fig. 6 is a schematic diagram showing a memory map.     The  top area of the  memory map is a partition table portion.  The partition table portion<br><br>
is followed by a block area, a boot sector, a FAT area, a FAT backup area, a root directory area, a sub directory area, and a data area.  On the memory map, logical addresses have been converted into physical addresses corresponding to the logical-physical address conversion table.<br>
The boot sector, the FAT area, the FAT backup area, the root directory area, the sub directory area, and the data area are referred to as FAT partition area.<br>
The partition table portion contains the start address and the end address of the FAT partition area.<br>
The FAT used for a conventional floppy,disk does not have such a partition table.  Since the first track has only a partition table, there is a blank area.  The boot sector contains the size of the FAT structure (12 bit FAT or 16 bit FAT), the cluster size, and the size of each area.  The FAT is used to manage the position of a file recorded in the data area.  The FAT copy area is a FAT backup area.  The route directory area contains file names, start cluster addresses thereof, and various attributes thereof.  The route directory area uses 32 bytes per file.<br>
The sub directory area is achieved by a directory attribute file as a directory.  In the embodiment shown in Fig. 6, the sub directory area has<br><br>
four files named PBLIST.MSF, CAT.MSF, DOG.MSF, and MAN.MFA.  The sub directory area is used to manage file names and record positions on the FAT.  In other words, the slot of the file name CAT.MSF is assigned address "10" on the FAT.  The slot of the file name DOG.MSF is assigned address "10" on the FAT.  An area after cluster 2 is used as a data area.  In this embodiment, audio data that has been compressed corresponding to the ATRAC3 format is recorded.  The top slot of the file name MAN.MSA is assigned address "110" on the FAT. According to the embodiment of the present invention, audio data with the file name CAT.MSF is recorded to cluster 5 to 8.  Audio data of DOG-1 as the first half of the file with the file name DOG.MSF is recorded to clusters 10 to 12.  Audio data DOG-2 as the second half of the file with the file name DOG.MSF is recorded in clusters 100 and 101.  Audio data with the file name MAN.MSF is recorded in clusters 110 and 111.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, an example of which a single file is divided into two portions and dispersedly recorded is described.  In the embodiment, an area "Empty" in the data area is a recordable area.  An area after cluster 200 is used for managing file names.  The file CAT.MSF is recorded to cluster 200.  The file DOG.MSF is recorded to cluster 201.  The file MAN.MSF is recorded to cluster 202. When the positions of the files are changed, the area<br><br>
after cluster 200 is re-arranged.  When the memory card is attached, the beginning and the end of the FAT partition area are recorded with reference to the top partition table portion.  After the boot sector portion is reproduced, the root directory area and the sub directory area are reproduced.  The slot of the reproduction management information PBLIST.MSF in the sub directory area is detected.  Thus, the address of the end portion of the slot of the file PBLIST.MSF is obtained.  In the embodiment, since address "200" is recorded at the end of the file PBLIST.MSF, cluster 200 is referenced.<br>
The area after cluster 200 is used for managing the reproduction order of files.  In the embodiment, the file CAT.MSA is the first program.  The file DOG.MSA is the second program.  The file MAN.MSA is the third program.  After the area after cluster 200 is referenced, slots of the files'- CAT.MSA, DOG.MSA, and MAN.MSA are referenced.  In Fig. 6, the end of the slot of the file CAT.MSA is assigned address "5".  The end of the slot of the file DOG.MSA is assigned address "10".  The end of the slot of the file MAN.MSA is assigned address "110".  When an entry address is searched on the FAT with address "5", cluster address "6" is obtained.  When an entry address is searched on the FAT with address "6", cluster address "7" is obtained.  When an entry address is searched on the FAT<br><br>
with address "8", code "FFF" that represents the end is obtained.  Thus, the file CAT.MSA uses clusters 5, 6, 7, and 8.  With reference to clusters 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the data area, an area of ATRAC3 data with the file name CAT.MSA can be accessed.<br>
Next, a method for searching the file DOG.MSF that has been dispersedly recorded will be described. The end of the slot of the file DOG.MSA is assigned address "10".  When an entry address on the FAT is searched with address "10", cluster address "11" is obtained.  When an entry address on the FAT is searched with address "11" is referenced, cluster address "12" is obtained.  When an entry address on the FAT is searched with address "12" is referenced, cluster address "101" is obtained.  When entry address "101" is referenced, code "FFF" that represents the end is obtained.  Thus, the file DOG.MSF uses clusters 10, 11, 12, 100, and 101.  When clusters 10, 11, and 12 ire referenced, the first part of ATRAC3 data of the file DOG.MSF can be accessed.  When the clusters 100 and 101 are referenced, the second part of ATRAC3 data of the file DOG.MSF can be accessed.  In addition, when an entry address is searched on the FAT with address "110", cluster address "101" is obtained.  When an entry address "111" is searched on the FAT with address "101", code "FFF" that represents the end is obtained. Thus, it is clear that the file MAN.MSA uses clusters<br><br>
110 and 111.  As described above, data files dispersed in the flash memory can be linked and sequentially reproduced.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, in addition to the file management system defined in the format of the memory card 40, the management file is used for managing tracks and parts of music files.  The management file is recorded to a user block of the flash memory 42 of the memory card 40.  Thus, as will be described later, even if the FAT of the memory card 40 is destroyed, a file can be recovered.<br>
The management file is generated by the DSP 30.  When the power of the recorder/player is turned on, the DSP 30 determines whether or not the memory card 40 has been attached to the recorder/player.  When the memory card has been attached, the DSP 30 authenticates the memory card 40.  When the DSP 30 has successfully authenticated the memory card 40, the DSP 30 reads the boot block of the flash memory 42.  Thus, the DSP 30 reads the physical-logical address conversion table and stores the read data to the SRAM. The FAT and the route directory have been written to the flash memory of the memory card 40 before the memory card 40 is shipped.  When data is recorded to the memory card 40,   the management file is generated.<br>
In other words, a record command issued by<br><br>
the remote controller of the user or the like is supplied to the DSP 30 from the external controller through the bus and the bus interface 32.  The encoder/decoder IC 10 compresses the received audio data and supplies the resultant ATRAC3 data to the security IC 20.  The security IC 20 encrypts the ATRAC3 data.  The encrypted ATRAC3 data is recorded to the flash memory 42 of the memory card 40.  Thereafter, the FAT and the management file are updated.  Whenever a file is updated (in reality, whenever the recording process of audio data is completed), the FAT and the management file stored in the SRAMs 31 and 36 are rewritten.  When the memory card 40 is detached or the power of the recorder/player is turned off, the FAT and the management file that are finally supplied from the SRAMs 31 and 36 are recorded to the flash memory 42. Alternatively, whenever the recording process of audio data is completed, the'FAT and the management file written in the flash memory 42 may be rewritten.  When audio data is edited, the contents of the management file are updated.<br>
In the data structure according to the embodiment, additional information is contained in the management file.  The additional information is updated and recorded to the flash memory 42.  In another data structure of the management file, an additional information management file is generated besides the<br><br>
track management file.  The additional information is supplied from the external controller to the DSP 30 through the bus and the bus interface 32.  The additional information is recorded to the flash memory 42 of the memory card 40.  Since the additional information is not supplied to the security IC 20, it is not encrypted.  When the memory card 40 is detached from the recorder/player or the power thereof is turned off, the additional information is written from the SRAM of the DSP 30 to the flash memory 42.<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic diagram showing the file structure of the memory card 40.  As the file structure, there are a still picture directory, a moving picture directory, a voice directory, a control directory, and a music (HIFI) directory.  According to the embodiment, music programs are recorded and reproduced.  Next, the music directory will be described.  The music directory has two types of files. The first type is a reproduction management file BLIST.MSF (hereinafter, referred to as PBLIST).  The other type is an ATRAC3 data file A3Dnnnn.MSA that stores encrypted music data.  The music directory can stores up to 400 ATRAC3 data files (namely, 400 music programs).  ATRAC3 data files are registered to the reproduction management file and generated by the recorder/player.<br>
Fig. 8 is a schematic diagram showing the<br><br>
structure of the reproduction management file.  Fig. 9 is a schematic diagram showing the file structure of one ATRAC3 data file.  The reproduction management file is a fixed-length file of 16 KB.  An ATRAC3 data file is composed of an attribute header and an encrypted music data area for each music program.  The attribute data has a fixed length of 16 KB.  The structure of the attribute header is similar to that of the reproduction management file.<br>
The reproduction management file shown in Fig. 8 is composed of a header, a memory card name NM-1S (for one byte code), a memory card name NM2-S<for two byte code a program reproduction sequence table trktbl and memory card additional information inf-s. the attribute header in fig. at beginning of data file is composed name nm1 one nm2 track trkinf as key part prtinf inf. contains number total parts size so forth.></for>
The attribute data is followed by ATRAC3 music data.  The music data is block-segmented every 16 KB.  Each block starts with a header.  The header contains an initial value for decrypting encrypted<br><br>
data.  Only music data of an ATRAC3 data file is encrypted.  Thus, other data such as the reproduction management file, the header, and so forth are not encrypted.<br>
Next, with reference to Figs. 10A to IOC, the relation between music programs and ATRAC3 data files will be described.  One track is equivalent to one music program.  In addition, one music program is composed of one ATRAC3 data (see Fig. 9).  The ATRAC3 data file is audio data that has been compressed corresponding to the ATRAC3 format.  The ATRAC3 data file is recorded as a cluster at a time to the memory card 40.  One cluster has a capacity of 16 KB.  A plurality of files are not contained in one cluster. The minimum data erase unit of the flash memory 42 is one block.  In the case of the memory card 40 for music data, a block is a synonym of a cluster.  In addition, one cluster is equivalent to one sector.<br>
One music program is basically composed of one part.  However, when a music program is edited, one music program may be composed of a plurality of parts. A part is a unit of data that is successively recorded. Normally, one track is composed of one part.  The connection of parts of a music program is managed with part information PRTINF in the attribute header of each music program.  In other words, the part size is represented with part size PRTSIZE (4 bytes) of the<br><br>
part information PRTINF.  The first two bytes of the part size PRTSIZE represents the number of total clusters of the current part.  The next two bytes represent the positions of the start sound unit (SU) and the end sound unit (SU) of the beginning and last clusters, respectively.  Hereinafter, a sound unit is abbreviated as SU.  With such a part notation, when music data is edited, the movement of the music data can be suppressed.  When music data is edited for each block, although the movement thereof can be suppressed, the edit unit of a block is much larger than the edit unit of a SU.<br>
SU is the minimum unit of a part.  In addition, SU is the minimum data unit in the case that audio data is compressed corresponding to the ATRAC3 format.  1 SU is audio data of which data of 1024 samples at 44.1 kHz (1024 x 16 bits x 2 channels) is compressed to data that is around 10 times smaller than that of original data.  The duration of 1 SU is around 23 msec.  Normally, one part is composed of several thousand SU.  When one cluster is composed of 42 SU, one cluster allows a sound of one second to be generated.  The number of parts composing one track depends on the size of the additional information. Since the number of parts is obtained by subtracting the header, the program name, the additional data, and so forth from one block, when there is no additional<br><br>
information, the maximum number of parts (645 parts) can be used.<br>
Fig. 10A is a schematic diagram showing the file structure in the case that two music programs of a CD or the like are successively recorded.  The first program (file 1) is composed of for example five clusters.  Since one cluster cannot contain two files of the first program and the second program, the file 2 starts from the beginning of the next cluster.  Thus, the end of the part 1 corresponding to the file 1 is in the middle of one cluster and the remaining area of the cluster contains no data.  Likewise, the second music program (file 2) is composed of one part.  In the case of the file 1, the part size is 5.  The first cluster starts at 0-th SU.  The last cluster ends at 4-th SU.<br>
There are four types of edit processes that are a divide process, a combine process, an erase process, and a move process.  The divide process is   *• performed to divide one track into two portions.  When the divide process is performed, the number of total tracks increases by one.  In the divide process, one file is divided into two files on the file system. Thus, in this case, the reproduction management file and the FAT are updated.  The combine process is performed to combine two tracks into one track.  When the combine process is performed,   the number of total tracks decreases by one.  In the combine process, two<br><br>
files are combined into one file on the file system. Thus, when the combine process is performed, the reproduction management file and the FAT are updated. The erase process is performed to erase a track.  The track numbers after the track that has been erased decrease one by one.  The move process is performed to change the track sequence.  Thus, when the erase process or the move process is performed, the reproduction management file and the FAT are updated.<br>
Fig. 10B is a schematic diagram showing the combined result of two programs (file 1 and file 2) shown in Fig. 10A.  As a result of the combine process, the combined file is composed of two parts.  Fig. IOC is a schematic diagram showing the divided result of which one program (file 1) is divided in the middle of the cluster 2.  By the divide process, the file 1 is composed of clusters 0, 1, and the beginning portion of cluster 2.  The file 2 is composed of the end portion of cluster 2 and clusters 3 and 4.<br>
As described above, according to the embodiment of the present invention, since the part notation is defined, as the combined result (see Fig. 10B), the start position of the part 1, the end position of the part 1, and the end portion of the part 2 can be defined with SU.  Thus, to pack the space due to the combined result, it is not necessary to move the music data of the part 2.  In addition, as the divided<br><br>
result (see Fig. IOC), it is not necessary to move data and pack the space at the beginning of the file 2.<br>
Fig. 11 is a schematic diagram showing the detailed data structure of the reproduction management file PBLIST.  Figs. 12A and 12B show a header portion and the remaining portion of the reproduction management file PBLIST.  The size of the reproduction management file is one cluster (one block = 16 KB). The size of the header shown in Fig. 12A is 32 bytes. The rest of the reproduction management file PBLIST shown in Fig. 12B contains a name NM1-S area (256 bytes) (for the memory card), a name NM2-S area (512 bytes), a contents key area, a MAC area, an S-YMDhms area, a reproduction sequence management table TRKTBL area (800 bytes), a memory card additional information INF-S area (14720 bytes), and a header information redundant area.  The start positions of these areas are defined in the reproduction mahagement file.<br>
The first 32 bytes of (0x0000) to (0x0010) shown in Fig. 12A are used for the header.  In the file, 16-byte areas are referred to as slots. Referring to Fig. 12A, the header are placed in the first and second slots.  The header contains the following areas.  An area denoted by "Reserved" is an undefined area.  Normally, in a reserved area, a null (0x00) is written.  However, even if _any data is written to a reserved area, the data written in the<br><br>
reserved is ignored.  In a future version, some reserved areas may be used.  In addition, data is prohibited from being written to a reserved area.  When an option area is not used, it is treated as a reserved area.<br>

Next, areas (see Fig. 13B) that preceded by the header will be described.<br>
= NM1-S<br>
Meaning:  Name of memory card (as one byte code)<br>
Function:  Represents the name of the memory card as one byte code (max. 256).  At the end of this area, an end code (0x00) is written.  The size is calculated from the end code.  When data is not recorded, null (0x00) is recorded from the beginning (0x0020) of this area for at least one byte.<br><br>
Value:  Various character code<br>
= NM2-S<br>
Meaning:  Name of memory card (as two byte code)<br>
Function:  Represents the name of the memory card as two byte code (max. 512). At the end of this area, an end code (0x00) is written.  The size is calculated from the end code.  When data is not recorded, null (0x00) is recorded from the beginning (0x0120) of this area for at least two bytes.<br>

Meaning:  SQN (sequence) number of ATRAC3 data file reproduced.<br>
Function:  Represents FNo of TRKINF.<br><br>
Value:  1 to 400 (0x190)<br>
When there is no track, this area is all 0.<br>
= INF-S<br>
Meaning:  Additional information of memory card (for example, information with respect to photos, songs, guides, etc.)<br>
Function:  Represents variable length additional information with a header.  A plurality of types of additional information may be used.  Each of the types of additional information has an ID and a data size.  Each additional information area including a header is composed of at least 16 bytes and a multiple of 4 bytes.  For details, see the following section.<br>
Value:  Refer to the section of "Data Structure of Additional Information".<br>
= S-YMDhms (4 bytes) (Option)<br>
Meaning:  Year, month, day, hour, minute, and second recorded by the recorder/player with a reliable clock.<br>
Function:  Identifies the last recorded date and time.  In this case of EMD, this area is mandatory.<br>
Value:  bits 25 to 31:  Year 0 to 99 (1980 to 2079)<br>
bits 21 to 24:  Month 0 to 12 bits 16 to 24:  Day 0 to 31<br><br>
bits 11 to 15:  Hour 0 to 23<br>
bits 05 to 10:  Minute 0 to 59<br>
bits 00 to 04:  Second 0 to 29 (two<br>
second	interval)<br>
As the last slot of the reproduction management file, the same BLKID-TL0, MCode, and REVISION as those in the header are written.<br>
While data is being recorded to a memory card, it may be mistakenly or accidentally detached or the power of the recorder/player may be turned off. When such an improper operation is performed, a defect should be detected.  As described above, the REVISION area is placed at the beginning and end of each block. Whenever data is rewritten, the value of the REVISION area is incremented.  If a defect termination takes place in the middle of a block, the value of the REVISION area at the beginning of the block does not match the value of the REVISION area at the end of the block.  Thus, such a defect termination can be detected.  Since there are two REVISION areas, the abnormal termination can be detected with a high probability.  When an abnormal termination is detected, an alarm such as an error message is generated.<br>
In addition, since the fixed value BLKID-TL0 is written at the beginning of one block (16 KB), when the FAT is destroyed, the fixed value is used as a reference for recovering data.  In other words, with<br><br>
reference to the fixed value, the type of the file can be determined.  Since the fixed value BLKID-TLO is redundantly written at the header and the end portion of each block, the reliability can be secured. Alternatively, the same reproduction management file can be redundantly recorded.<br>
The data amount of an ATRAC3 data file is much larger than that of the track information management file.  In addition, as will be described later, a block number BLOCK SERIAL is added to ATRAC3 data file.  However, since a plurality of ATRAC3 files are recorded to the memory card, to prevent them from become redundant, both CONNUMO and BLOCK SERIAL are used.  Otherwise, when the FAT is destroyed, it will be difficult to recover the file.  In other words, one ATRAC3 data file may be composed of a plurality of blocks that are dispersed.  To identify blocks of the same file, CONNUMO is used.  In addition, to identify the order of blocks in the ATRAC3 data file, BLOCK SERIAL is used.<br>
Likewise, the maker code (Mcode) is redundantly recorded at the beginning and the end of each block so as to identify the maker and the model in such a case that a file has been improperly recorded in the state that the FAT has not been destroyed.<br>
Fig. 12C is a schematic diagram showing the structure of the additional information data.  The<br><br>
additional information is composed of the following header and variable length data.  The header has the following areas.<br>

Value:  Individually defined corresponding to the contents of each type of additional information.<br>
Fig. 13 is a table that correlates key code values (0 to 63 of additional information and types thereof.  Key code values (0 to 31) are assigned to music character information.  Key code values (32 to 63) are assigned to URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) (web information).  The music character information and URL information contain character information of the album title, the artist name, the CM, and so forth as additional information.<br>
Fig. 14 is a table that correlates key code<br><br>
values (64 to 127) of additional information and types thereof.  Key code values (64 to 95) are assigned to paths/others.  Key code values (96 to 127) are assigned to control/numeric data.  For example, ID = 98 represents TOC-ID as additional information.  TOC-ID represents the first music program number, the last music program number, the current program number, the total performance duration, and the current music program duration corresponding to the TOC information of a CD (Compact Disc).<br>
Fig. 15 is a table that correlates key code values (128 to 159) of additional information and types thereof.  Key code values (128 to 159) are assigned to synchronous reproduction information.  In Fig. 15, EMD stands for electronic music distribution.<br>
Next, with reference to Figs. 16A to 16E, real examples of additional information will be described.  As with Fig. 12C, s&gt;Fig. 16A shows the data structure of the additional information.  In Fig. 16B, key code ID = 3 (artist name as additional information).  SIZE = OxlC (28  bytes) representing that the data length of additional information including the header is 28 bytes; C+L representing that character code C = 0x01 (ASCII) and language code L = 0x09 (English).  Variable length data after byte 12 represents one byte data "SIMON &amp;" GRAFUNKEL" as artist name.  Since the data length of the additional<br><br>
information should be a multiple of 4 bytes, the rest is filled with (0x00).<br>
In Fig. 16C, key code ID = 97. representing that ISRC (International Standard Recording Code: Copyright code) as additional information.  SIZE = 0x14 (20 bytes) representing that the data length of the additional information is 20 bytes.  C = 0x00 and L = 0x00 representing that characters and language have not been set.  Thus, the data is binary code.  The variable length data is eight-byte ISRC code representing copyright information (nation, copyright owner, recorded year, and serial number).<br>
In Fig. 16D, key code ID =is 97 representing recorded date and time as additional information.  SIZE - 0 x 10 (16 bytes) representing that the data length of the additional information is 16 bytes.  C = 0x00 and L = representing that characters and language have not been set.  The variable length^data is four-byte code (32 bit) representing the recorded date and time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second).<br>
In Fig. 16E, key code ID = 107 representing a reproduction log as additional information.  SIZE = 0x10 (16 bytes) representing that the data length of the additional information is 16 bytes.  C = 0x00 and L = 0x00 representing that characters and language have not been set.  The variable length data is a four-byte code representing a reproduction log (year, month, day,<br><br>
hour, minute, second). When the recorder/player has a reproduction log function, it records data of 16 bytes whenever it reproduces music data.<br>
Fig. 17 is a schematic diagram showing a data arrangement of ATRAC3 data file A3Dnnnn in the case that 1 SU is N bytes (for example, N = 384 bytes). Fig. 17 shows an attribute header (1 block) of a data file and a music data file (1 block).  Fig. 17 shows the first byte (0x0000 to 0x7FF0) of each slot of the two blocks (16 x 2 = 32 kbytes).  As shown in Fig. 18, the first 32 bytes of the attribute header are used as a header; 256 bytes are used as a music program area NM1 (256 bytes); and 512 bytes are used as a music program title area NM2 (512 bytes).  The header of the attribute header contains the following areas.<br>

Data of 80 bytes starting from the fixed<br><br>
position (0x320) of the attribute header is referred to as track information area TRKINF.  This area is mainly used to totally manage the security information and copy control information.  Fig. 19 shows a part of TRKINF.  The area TRKINF contains the following areas.<br>
- CONTENTS KEY (8 bytes)<br>
Meaning: Value for each music program.  The value of CONTENTS KEY is protected in the security block of the memory card and then stored.<br>

= MAC (8 bytes)<br>
Meaning:  Forged copyright information check value    Function:  Represents the value generated with a plurality of values of TRKINF including contents cumulation numbers and a secret sequence number.<br>
The secret sequence number is a sequence number recorded in the secret area of the memory card. A non-copyright protection type recorder cannot read data from the secret area of the memory card.  On the other hand, a copyright protection type recorder and a computer that operates with a program that can read data from a memory card can access the secret area.<br>
= A (1 byte)<br>
Meaning:  Attribute of part.<br><br>
Function:  Represents the information of such as compression mode of a part.<br>
Value:  The details will be described in the following (see Figs. 19 and 20).<br>
Next, the value of the area A will be described.  In the following description, monaural mode (N = 0 or 1) is defined as a special joint mode of which bit 7=1, sub signal = 0, main signal = (L+R). A non-copyright protection type player may ignore information of bits 2 and 1.<br>
Bit 0 of the area A represents information of emphasis on/off state.  Bit 1 of the area A represents information of reproduction skip or normal reproduction.  Bit 2 of the area A represents information of data type such as audio data, FAX data, or the like.  Bit 3 of the area A is undefined.  By a combination of bits 4, 5, and 6, mode information of ATRAC3 is defined as shown in Fig. 20.  In other words, N is a mode value of 3 bits.  For five types of modes that are monaural (N = 0 or 1), LP (N - 2), SP (N = 4), EX (N = 5), and HQ (N = 7), record duration (64 MB memory card only), data transmission rate, and the number of SU per block are listed.  The number of bytes of 1 SO depends on each mode.  The number of bytes of 1 SU in the monaural mode is 136 bytes.  The number of bytes of 1 SU in the LP mode is 192 bytes.  The number of bytes of 1 SU in the SP mode is 304 bytes.  The<br><br>
number of bytes of 1 SU in the EX mode is 384 bytes. The number of bytes of 1 SU in the HQ mode is 512 bytes.  Bit 7 of the area A represents ATRAC3 modes (0: Dual, 1: JOint).<br>
For example, an example of which a 64 MB memory card is used in the SP mode will be described. A 64-MB memory card has 3968 blocks.  In the SP mode, since 1 SU is 304 bytes, one block has 53 SU.  1 SU is equivalent to (1024/44100) seconds.  Thus, one block is (1024/44100) x 53 x (3968 - 10) = 4863 seconds = 81 minutes.  The transmission rate is (44100/1024) x 304 x 8 * 104737 bps.<br>

track with reproduction restriction<br>
Function:  Represents the date and time at which data reproduction is expired with EMD.<br>

(bits 7 and 6)<br>
11:  Unlimited copy operation permitted 01:  copy prohibited<br>
00:  one time copy operation permitted (bits 3 and 2)<br>
00:  analog/digital input recording MG authentication level is 0. When digital record operation using data from a CD is performed, (bits 7 and 6): 00 and (bits 3 and 2): 00.<br>
= CN (1 byte) (Option)<br>

by a 24-byte part management information area (PRTINF) starting from 0x0370. When one track is composed of a plurality of parts, the values of areas PRTINF of the individual parts are successively arranged on the time axis. Fig. 22 shows a part of the area PRTINF. Next, areas in the area PRTINF will be described in the order of the arrangement.<br>
= PRTSIZE (4 bytes)<br>
Meaning:  Part size<br>
Function:  Represents the size of a part. Cluster: 2 bytes (highest position), start SU: 1 byte (upper), end SU: 1 byte (lowest position)-.<br>

Function:  Uniquely designates an ID of contents.<br>
Value:  Same value as the value of the<br><br>
contents cumulation number initial value key<br>
As shown in Fig. 17, the attribute header of an ATRAC3 data file contains additional information INF.  The additional information is the same as the additional information INF-S (see Figs. 11 and 12B) of the reproduction management file except that the start position is not fixed.  The last byte position (a multiple of four bytes) at the end of one or a plurality of parts is followed by data of the additional information INF.<br>
= INF<br>
Meaning:  Additional information with respect to track<br>
Function:  Represents variable length additional information with a header.  A plurality of different types of additional information may be arranged.  Each of additional information areas has an ID and a data size.  Each additional information area is composed of at least 16 bytes and a multiple of 4 bytes.<br>
Value:  Same as additional information INF-S of reproduction management file<br>
The above-described attribute header is followed by data of each block of an ATRAC3 data file. As shown in Fig. 23, a header is added for each block. Next, data of each block will be described.<br>

Meaning:  Cumulated number of initially created contents<br>
Function:  Designates a unique ID for contents.  Even if the contents are edited, the value of the area CONNUMO is not changed.<br>
Value:  Same as the contents cumulation number initial key<br>
= BLOCK SERIAL (4 bytes)<br>
Meaning:  Serial number assigned to each track<br>
Function:  Starts from 0 and increments by 1. Even if the contents are edited, the value of the area BLOCK SERIAL is not changed.<br>
Value:  0 to OxFFFFFFFF<br>
= BLOCK-SEED (8 bytes)<br>
Meaning:  Key for encrypting one block<br><br>
Function:  The beginning of the block is a random number generated by the security block of the recorder/player.  The random number is followed by a value incremented by 1. When the value of the area BLOCK-SEED is lost, since sound is not generated for around one second equivalent to one block, the same data is written to the header and the end of the block. Even if the contents are edited, the value of the area BLOCK-SEED is not changed.<br>
Value:  Initially 8-bit random number<br>
= INITIALIZATION VECTOR (8 bytes)<br>
Meaning:  Value necessary for encrypting/decrypting ATRAC3 data<br>
Function:  Represents an initial value necessary for encrypting and decrypting ATRAC3 data for each block.  A block starts from 0.  The next block starts from the last encrypted 8-bit value at the last SU.  When a block is divided, the last eight bytes just before the start SU is used.  Even if the contents are edited, the value of the area INITIALIZATION VECTOR is not changed.<br>
Value:  0 to OxFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF<br>
= SU-nnn<br>
Meaning:  Data of sound unit<br>
Function:  Represents data compressed from 1024 samples.  The number of bytes of output data depends on the compression mode.  Even if the contents<br><br>
are.edited, the value of the area SU-nnn is not changed.  For example, in the SP mode, N = 384 bytes.<br>
Value:  Data value of ATRAC3<br>
In Fig. 17, since N = 384, 42 SU are written to one block.  The first two slots (4 bytes) of one block are used as a header.  In the last slot (two bytes), the areas BLKID-A3D, MCode, CONNUMO, and BLOCK SERIAL are redundantly written.  Thus, M bytes of the remaining area of one block is (16,384 - 384 x 42 - 16 x 3 = 208) bytes. As described above, the eight-byte area BLOCK SEED is redundantly recorded.<br>
When the FAT area is destroyed, all blocks of the flash memory are searched.  It is determined whether the value of the area ID BLKID at the beginning of each block is TLO, HDO, or A3D.  As shown in Figs. 24A to 24C, at step SP1, it is determined whether or not the value of the area ID BLKID at the beginning of the top block is BLKID-TLO.  When the determined result at step SP1 is No, the flow advances to step SP2.  At step SP2, the block number is incremented.  Thereafter, at step SP3, it is determined whether or not the last block has been searched.<br>
When the determined result at step SP3 is No, the flow returns to step SPl.<br>
When the determined result at step SPl is Yes, the flow advances to step SP4.  At step SP4, it is determined that the searched block is the reproduction<br><br>
management file PBLIST.  Thereafter, the flow advances to step SP5.  At step SP5, the number of total tracks T-TRK in the reproduction management file PBLIST is stored as N to the register.  For example, when the memory has stored 10 ATRAC3 data files (10 music programs), 10 has been stored in T-TRK.<br>
Next, with reference to the value of the number of total tracks T-TRK, TRK-001 to TRK-400 of blocks are successively referenced.  In this example, since 10 music programs have been recorded, TRK-001 to TRK-010 of blocks are referenced.  Since a file number FNO has been recorded in TRK-XXX (where X = 1 to 400) at step SP7, a table that correlates the track number TRK-XXX and the file number FNO is stored to the memory.  Next, at step SP8, N stored in the register is decremented.  A loop of steps SP6, SP7, and SP8 is repeated until N becomes 0 at step SP9.<br>
When the determined result at step SP9 is Yes, the flow advances to step SP10.  At step SP10, the pointer is reset to the top block.  The searching process is repeated from the top block.  Thereafter, the flow advances to step SPll.  At step SPll, it is determined whether or not the value of the area ID BLKID of the top block is BLKID-HD0.  When the determined result at step SPll is No, the flow advances to step SP12.  At step SP12, the block number is incremented.  At step SP13, it is determined whether or<br><br>
not the last block has been searched.<br>
When the determined result at step SP13 is No, the flow returns to step SP11.  The searching process is repeated until the determined result at step SP11 becomes Yes.<br>
When the determined result at step SP11 is Yes, the flow advances to step SP14.  At step SP14, it is determined that the block is the attribute header (see Fig. 8) (0x0000 to 0x03FFF shown in Fig. 18) at the beginning of the ATRAC3 data file.<br>
Next, at step SP15, with reference to the file number FNO, the sequence number BLOCK SERIAL of the same ATRAC data file, and the contents cumulation number key CONNUM0 contained in the attribute header, they are stored to the memory.  When 10 ATRAC3 data files have been recorded, since there are 10 blocks of which the value of the area ID BLKID of the top block is BLKID-TL0, the searching process Is continued until 10 blocks are searched.<br>
When the determined result at step SP13 is Yes, the flow advances to step SP16.  At step SP16, the pointer is reset to the top block.  The searching process is repeated from the top block.<br>
Thereafter, the flow advances to step SP17. At step SP17, it is determined whether or not the value of the area ID BLKID of the top block is BLKID-A3D.<br>
When the determined result at step SP17 is<br><br>
No, the flow advances to step SP18.  At step SP18, the block number is incremented.  Thereafter, at step SP18', it is determined whether or not the last block has been searched.  When the determined result at step SP18' is No, the flow returns to step SP17.<br>
When the determined result at step SP17 is Yes, the flow advances to step SP19.  At step SP19, it is determined that the block contains ATRAC3 data. Thereafter, the flow advances to step SP20.  At step SP20, with reference to the serial number BLOCK SERIAL recorded in the ATRAC3 data block and the contents cumulation number key CONNUMO, they are stored to the memory.<br>
In the same ATRAC3 data file, the common number is assigned as the contents cumulation number key CONNUMO.  In other words, when one ATRAC3 data file is composed of 10 blocks, a common number is assigned to all the values of the areas CONNUMO. *<br>
In addition, when one ATRAC3 data is composed of 10 blocks, serial numbers 1 to 0 are assigned to the values of the areas BLOCK SERIALs of the 10 blocks.<br>
Corresponding to the values of the areas CONNUMO and BLOCK SERIAL, it is determined whether the current block composes the same contents and the reproduction order of the current block in the same contents (namely, the connection sequence).<br>
When 10 ATRAC3 data files (namely, 10 music<br><br>
programs) have been recorded and each of the ATRAC3 data files is composed of 10 blocks, there are 100 data blocks.<br>
With reference to the values of the areas CONNUM0 and BLOCK SERIAL, the reproduction order of music programs of 100 data blocks and the connection order thereof can be obtained.<br>
When the determined result at step SP19 is Yes, all the blocks have been searched for the reproduction management file, the ATRAC3 data file, and the attribute file.  Thus, at step SP21, based on the values of the areas CONNUM0, BLOCK SERIAL, FNO, and TRK-X in the order of block numbers of the blocks stored in the memory, the file connection state is obtained.<br>
After the connection state is obtained, the FAT may.be generated in a free area of the memory.<br>
v Next, a management file according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. Fig. 25 shows the file structure according to the second embodiment of the present invention.  Referring to Fig. 25, a music directory contains a track information management file TRKLIST.MSF (hereinafter, referred to as TRKLIST), a backup track information management file TRKLISTB.MSF (hereinafter, referred to as TRKLISTB), an additional information file INFLIST.MSF (that contains an artist name, an ISRC<br><br>
code, a time stamp, a still picture data, and so forth (this file is referred to as INFIST)), an ATRAC3 data file A3Dnnnn.MSF (hereinafter, referred to as A3nnnn). The file TRKLIST contains two areas NAMEl and NAME2. The area NAMEl is an area that contains the memory card name and the program name (for one byte code corresponding to ASCII/8859-1 character code).  The area NAME2 is an area that contains the memory card name and the program name (for two byte code corresponding to MS-JIS/Hankul/Chinese code).<br>

The file TRKLIST is a fixed-length file of 64 kbytes (= 16 k x 4).  An area of 32 kbytes of the file is used for managing tracks.  The remaining area of 32 kbytes is used to contain, the areas NAMEl and NAME2.  Although the areas NAMEl-and NAME2 for program names may be provided as a different file as the track information management file, in a system having a small storage capacity, it is convenient to totally manage the track information management file and program name files.<br>
The track information area TRKINF-nnnn and part information area PRTINF-nnnn of the track information management file TRKLIST are used to manage the data file A3Dnnnn and the additional information INFLIST.  Only the ATRAC3 data file A3Dnnnn is<br><br>
encrypted.  In Fig. 26, the data length in the horizontal direction is 16 bytes (0 to F).  A hexadecimal number in the vertical direction represents the value at the beginning of the current line.<br>
According to the second embodiment, three files that are the track management file TRKLIST (including a program title file), the additional information management file INFLIST, and the data file A3Dnnnn are used.

Fig. 30 shows the data arrangement (for one block) of the ATRAC3 data file A3Dnnnn in the case that 1 SU is composed of N bytes.  In this file, one slot is composed of eight bytes. „. Fig. 30 shows the values of the top portion (0x0000 to 0x3FF8) of each slot.  The first four slots of the file are used for a header.  As with the data block preceded by the attribute header of the data file (see Fig. 17) of the first example, a header is placed.

In other words, the additional information contains an area IN (2 bytes) as an ID, an area key code ID (1 byte), an area SIZE (2 bytes) that represents the size of each additional information area, and a maker code area MCode (2 bytes).  In addition, the additional information contains an area SID (1 byte) as a sub ID.<br><br>
According to the second embodiment of the present invention, in addition to the file system defined as a format of the memory card, the track information management file TRKLISffir music data is used.  Thus, even if the FAT is destroyed, the file can be recovered.  Fig. 33 shows a flow of a file recovering process.  To recover the file, a computer that operates with a file recovery program and that can access the memory card and a storing device (hard disk, RAM, or the like) connected to the computer are used. The computer has a function equivalent to the DSP30. Next, a file recovering process using the track management file TRKLIST will be described.<br>
All blocks of the flash memory whose FAT has been destroyed are searched for TL-0 as the value (BLKID) at the top position of each block.  In addition, all the blocks are searched for NM-1 as the value (BLKID) at the top position of each block. Thereafter, all the blocks are searched for NM-2 as the value (BLKID) at the top position of each block.  All the contents of the four blocks (track information management file) are stored to for example a hard disk by the recovery computer.<br>
The number of total tracks is obtained from data"after the fourth byte of the track information management-file.  The 20-th byte of the track information area TRKINF-001, the value of the area<br><br>
CONNUM-001 of the first music program, and the value of the next area P-001 are obtained.  The number of parts is obtained with the value of the area P-001.  The values of the areas PRTSIZE of all parts of the track 1 of the area PRTINF is obtained.  The number of total blocks (clusters) n is calculated and obtained.<br>
After the track information management file is obtained, the flow advances to step 102.  At step 102, a voice data file (ATRAC3 data file) is searched. All blocks of other than the management file is searched from the flash memory.  Blocks whose top value (BLKID) is A3D are collected.<br>
A block of which the value of the area CONNUM0 at the 16-th byte of A3Dnnnn is the same as that of the area CONNUM-001 of the first music program of the track information management file and of which the value of the area BLOCK SERIAL that starts from 20-th byte is 0 is searched.  After the first block is obtained, a block (cluster) with the same value of the area CONNUM value as the first block and of which the value of BLOCK SERIAL is incremented by 1 (1=0+1) is searched.  After the second block is obtained, a block with the same value of the area CONNUMO as the second block and of which the value of the area BLOCK SERIAL is incremented by 1 (2=1+1) is searched.<br>
By repeating the process, the ATRC3 data file is searched until n blocks (clusters) of the track 1<br><br>
are obtained.  When all the blocks (clusters) are obtained, they are successively stored to the hard disk.<br>
The same process for the track 1 is performed for the track 2.  In other words, a block of which the value of the area CONNUMO is the same as that of the area CONNUM-002 of the first music program of the track information management file and of which the value of the area BLOCK SERIAL that starts at the 20-th byte is searched.  Thereafter, in the same manner as the track 1, the ATRAC3 data file is searched until the last block (cluster) n1 is detected.  After all blocks (clusters) are obtained, they are successively stored to the hard disk.<br>
By repeating the above-described process for all tracks (the number of tracks: m), all the ATRAC3 data is stored to the hard disk controlled by the recovering computer.<br>
At step 103, the memory card whose the FAT has been destroyed is re-initialized and then the FAT is reconstructed.  A predetermined directory is formed in the memory card.  Thereafter, the track information management file and the ATRAC3 data file for m tracks are copied from the hard disk to the memory card. Thus, the recovery process is finished.<br>
In the management file and data file, important parameters (in particular, codes in headers)<br><br>
may be recorded triply rather than doubly.  When data is redundantly recorded, the same data may be recorded at any positions as long as they are apart from each other for one page or more.<br>
Next, a forge-checking process for a data file according to the first embodiment will be described.  Various types of information can be checked for forged information such as reproduction management file PBLIST.MSF and TRAC3 data file that is compressed audio data.  Since the reproduction management file PBLIST.MSF contains clock information S-YMDhms, the clock information is checked so as to prevent the user from forging it.<br>
A forge-check code is generated by calculating CONTENTS KEY (CK) of an ATRAC3 data file generated along with the reproduction management file PBLIST.MSF using the hash function.  In addition, since the file may be erased or moved, the value of CONTENTS KEY (CK) is stored in another file.  When clock information S-YMDhms has not been entered, all hash values are set to zero with no calculations.  Whenever the clock information S-YMDhms is updated, the hash values are calculated.<br>
With respect to an ATRAC3 data file that is audio data, track attribute A, reproduction limitation flag, security version LT, MG (D) serial number MG (D) Serial, contents cumulation number CCNNUM, reproduction<br><br>
start date/time YMDhms-S, reproduction expiration date/time YMDhms-E, number of track reproduction times CT, number of reproduction permission times MT, copy control CC, and number of high speed digital copy permission times CN (optional) are forge-checked so as to prevent the user from forging them.  A forge-check code is generated by calculating CONTENTS KEY (CK) of the ATRAC3 data file using the hash function. When the ATRAC3 data file is divided or combined, with new CONTENTS KEY, the hash value is re-calculated.<br>
Fig. 34 is a block diagram showing a forge-checking circuit of the digital audio recorder according to the present invention.  When a memory card is attached to the digital audio recorder or when the reproduction button is pressed, the attached memory is authenticated.  When the memory card has been successfully authenticated, a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) 30 causes the track information management file TRKLIST.MSF to be read from a flash memory of a memory card 40 to an S-RAM (Static RAM) 31.<br>
In Fig. 34, a reproduction limitation value block 70 is contained in the track information management file.  The track information management file is stored in a predetermined area of the flash memory of the memory card 40.  The reproduction limitation value block 70 is read from the flash memory to the SRAM 31 (36).  The reproduction limitation value block<br><br>
70 is forge-checked.  The forge-checking circuit shown in Fig. 34 includes a hash calculating circuit 71, an encrypting circuit 22 having predetermined memory areas (72 and 73) that are non-volatile memories, a match detecting circuit 74, and a controlling portion 75. The controlling portion 75 has an inner clock 76.  The hash calculating circuit 71, the match detecting circuit 74, and the controlling portion 75 are accomplished with a hardware structure or software processes.  The software processes are performed by the DSP 30.  The hash calculating circuit 71 can be accomplished with for example a functional device that composes the encrypting circuit 22.<br>
The controlling portion 75 monitors the attached state of the memory card 40.  When the memory card 40 is attached to the digital audio player, the controlling portion 75 determines whether or not the reproducing operation of files stored in the menjory card 40 is permitted corresponding to predetermined information of the reproduction limitation value block 70.  The predetermined information is for example track attribute A, reproduction limitation flag, security version LT, MG (D) serial number MG (D) Serial, contents cumulation number CONNUM, reproduction start date/time YMDhms-S, reproduction expiration date/time YMDhms-E, number of track reproduction times CT, number of reproduction permission times MT, COPY Control CC,<br><br>
number of high speed digital copy permission times CN (optional), CONTENTS KEY (CK), and so forth.  With respect to the reproduction start date/time and reproduction expiration date/time, they are compared with the date/time of the inner clock 7 6 so as to determine whether or not the reproducing operation is permitted.  With respect to the number of track reproduction times CT and the number of reproduction permission times MT, corresponding thereto, it is determined whether or not the reproducing operation is permitted.<br>
The hash calculating circuit 71 calculates hash values of individual parameter of the reproduction limitation value block 70.  The hash values are obtained using the hash function.  When the reproduction limitation value block 70 is forged, the hash values are varied.  The hash function is generally defined in ISO/IEC 10118-1, JIS X5057-1.  The hash ^ function is a function of which any two different input values that become the same output value cannot be calculated.  A calculated result of the hash calculating circuit 71 is supplied to the encrypting circuit 22.<br>
Control information is supplied from the controlling portion 75 to the non-volatile memory of. the encrypting circuit 22.  Hash values calculated before the reproducing operation are stored in the<br><br>
predetermined memory area 72 as current hash values. On the other hand, hash values calculated after the former reproducing operation are stored as former hash values to the predetermined memory area 73.  The current hash values and the former hash value stored in the encrypting circuit 22 are read and supplied to the match detecting circuit 74.  The values in the predetermined memory areas (72 and 73) of the flash memory of the encrypting circuit 22 cannot be read from the outside of the digital audio recorder.  Thus, it is impossible to access the hash values stored in the areas 72 and 73 from the outside.  Only a match detection result of the match detecting circuit 74 can be read from the outside.  An area that cannot be accessed from the outside is referred to as tamper resistant area.<br>
The match detecting circuit 74 compares the current hash values with the former hash values. Depending on whether the current hash values are the same as the former hash values, it is determined whether the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged.  Output data of the match detecting circuit 74 is supplied to the controlling portion 75.<br>
The controlling portion 75 determines whether the reproducing operation is permitted or prohibited corresponding to both the determination based on track attribute A, reproduction limitation flag, security<br><br>
version LT, MG (D) serial number MG (D) Serial, contents cumulation number CONNUM, reproduction start date/time YMDhms-S, reproduction expiration date/time YMDhms-E, number of track reproduction times CT, number of reproduction permission times MT, COPY CONTROL CC, number of high speed digital copy permission times CN (optional), and CONTENTS KEY (CK) and the output data of the match detecting circuit 74.  The controlling portion 75 generates control information corresponding to the determined result.  In other words, when it is determined that the reproduction limitation value block 70 has not been forged and the reproducing operation is permitted, the controlling portion 75 generates control information that permits the reproducing operation. On the other hand, when the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged, the controlling portion 75 generates control information that prohibits the reproducipg operation.  Even if the reproduction limitation value block 70 has not been forged, when the reproducing operation is prohibited corresponding to track attribute A, reproduction limitation flag, security version LT, MG (D) serial number MG (D) Serial, contents cumulation number CONNUM, reproduction start date/time YMDhms-S, reproduction expiration date/time YMDhms-E, number of track reproduction times CT, number of reproduction permission times MT, COPY CONTROL CC, number of high<br><br>
speed digital copy permission times CN (optional), and CONTENTS KEY (CK), the reproducing operation is prohibited.<br>
In the above-described example, the forge-checking process for an ATRAC3 data file was explained. Likewise, the forge-checking process is performed for the clock information S-YMDhms contained in the reproduction management file PBLIST.MSF.  A forge-check code is generated by calculating CONTENTS KEY (CK) of the first program of an ATRAC3 data file generated along with the reproduction management file PBLIST.MSF using the hash function.<br>
The calculating process of this example is performed in the same manner as that for an ATRAC3 data file.  The circuit of this calculating process can be shared with that for the ATRAC3 data file.  Since the file may be erased or moved, the value of CONTENTS KEY ^  (CK) is stored in another file.   When clock<br>
information S-YMDhms has not been entered, all hash values are set to zero with no calculations.  Whenever the clock information S-YMDhms is updated, the hash values are calculated.<br>
Fig. 35 shows a process of which an EMD (Electric Music Distribution) terminal (not shown) downloads an ATRAC3 data file in the format according to the first embodiment to a memory card.  In addition, Fig. '35 shows a process of which the EMD terminal<br><br>
downloads an ATRAC3 data file that has been compressed and encrypted through a public line (ISDN line, telephone line, or satellite line) to a memory card. In this example, it is assumed that a memory card (flash memory) that has not been used (namely, a virgin memory card (flash memory)) is attached to the EMD terminal.<br>
When a virgin memory card is attached to the EMD terminal at step SP101, a reproduction management file PBLIST.MSF is generated.  In addition, the downloaded date/time information is generated.  The downloaded date/time information is recorded as clock information S-YMDhms of the reproduction management file PBLIST.MSF.<br>
At step SP102, when an ATRAC3 data file that has been compressed and encrypted is received through the public line (ISDN line, telephone line, or satellite line) and recorded to the flash memory, an attribute header is generated as shown in Fig. 9 and added to the ATRAC3 data file.<br>
At Step SP103, with CONTENTS KEY (CK) contained in the attribute header, the hash calculating circuit 71 calculates the clock information S-YMDhms of the reproduction management file PBLIST.MSF using the hash function and stores the calculated value to the memory area 73 of the encrypting circuit 22.<br>
At step SP104, with CONTENTS KEY (CK)<br><br>
contained in the attribute header, the hash calculating circuit 71 calculates the reproduction limitation information (track attribute A, reproduction limitation flag, security version LT, reproduction start date/time YMDhms-S, reproduction expiration date/time YMDhms-E, number of track reproduction times CT, number of reproduction permission times MT, COPY CONTROL CC, and number of high speed digital copy permission times CN (optional) of the ATRACK3 data file using the hash function.  The calculated value obtained by the hash calculating circuit 71 is stored in the memory area 73 of the encrypting circuit 22.<br>
In addition, with CONTENTS KEY (CK) contained in the attribute file, the hash calculating circuit 71 calculates the MG (D) serial number MG (D) Serial and the contents cumulation number CONNUM generated along with the attribute file using the hash function.  The calculated value obtained by the hash calculating circuit 71 is stored in the memory area 73 of the encrypting circuit 22.  Since data is recorded to a virgin flash memory, no data has been recorded in the memory area 72 of the encrypting circuit 22.<br>
At step SP105, it is determined whether or not the flash memory has been detached from the EMD terminal.  When the determined result at step SP105 is Yes, the flow advances to step SP106.  At step SP106, it is determined whether or not the flash memory has<br><br>
been re-attached.  When the determined result at step SP105 is No, the flow advances to step SP107.  At step SP107, it is determined whether or not the power of the EMD terminal has be^n turned off.<br>
When the determined result at step SP107 is Yes, the flow advances to step SP108.  At step SP108, it is determined whether or not the power has been turned on again.<br>
When the determined result at step SP106 is Yes or when the determined result at step SP108 is Yes, the flow advances to step SP109.  At step SP109, with CONTENTS KEY (CK) contained in the attribute header, the hash calculating circuit 71 calculates the clock information S-YMDhms of the reproduction management file PBLIST.MSF using the hash function.  The calculated value obtained by the hash calculating circuit 71 is stored to the memory area 72 of the encrypting circuit Z2.<br>
At step S&amp;no, it is determined whether or not the current hash values stored in the memory area 72 of the encrypting circuit 22 matches the former hash values stored in the memory area 73 of the encrypting circuit 22.  When the determined result at step SP110 is Yes, the current hash values stored in the memory area 72 of the encrypting circuit 22 are copied to the former hash values stored in the memory area 73 of the encrypting circuit 2,2.<br><br>
At step SPlll, it is determined whether or not a reproduction command has been issued.  When the determined result at step SPlll is Yes and when the determined result at step SP110 is Yes, the flow advances to step SP112.  At step SP112, with CONTENTS KEY (CK) stored in the attribute file of the ATRAC3 data file, the hash calculating circuit 71 calculates the' track attribute A, reproduction limitation flag, security version LT, MG (D) serial number MG (D) Serial, contents cumulation number CONNUM, reproduction start date/time YMDhms-S, reproduction expiration date/time YMDhms-E, number of track reproduction times CT, number of reproduction permission times MT, COPY CONTROL CC, and number of high speed digital copy permission times CN (optional) of the attribute file added to the ATRAC3 data file corresponding to the reproduction command using the hash function.  The calculated value obtained by the hash calculating circuit 71 is stored in the memory area 72 of the encrypting circuit 22.<br>
Thereafter, the flow advances to step SP113. At step SP113, it is determined whether or not the hash values stored in the memory area 72 of the encrypting circuit 22 obtained by the hash calculating circuit 71 match the hash values stored in the memory area 73 of the encrypting circuit 22.<br>
The match detecting circuit 74 compares the<br><br>
currently calculated hash values with the formerly calculated hash values.  When they match, it is determined that any information of track attribute A, reproduction limitation flag, security version LT, MG (D) serial number MG (D) Serial, contents cumulation number CONNUM, reproduction start date/time YMDhms-S, reproduction expiration date/time YMDhms-E, number of track reproduction times CT, number of reproduction permission times MT, COPY CONTROL CC, and number of high speed digital copy permission times CN (optional) of the attribute file has not been forged.  Thereafter, the flow advances to step SP114.  At step SP114, the reproducing operation of the ATRAC3 data file is permitted.<br>
When the determined result at step SP113 is No, it is determined that some of the track attribute A, reproduction limitation flag, security version LT, MG (D) serial number MG (D) Serial, contents cumulation number CONNUM, reproduction start date/time YMDhms-S, reproduction expiration date/time YMDhms-E, number of track reproduction times CT, number of reproduction permission times MT, COPY CONTROL CC, and number of high speed digital copy permission times CN (optional) of the attribute file has been forged.  In this case, the flow advances to step SP115.  At step SP115, the reproducing operation of the ATRAC3 data file is prohibited.  Thereafter, the flow advances to step<br><br>
SP116.  At step SP116, a forging flag is set.<br>
When the ATRAC3 data file is reproduced, it is determined whether or not predetermine values (any positive integers) have been set to the number of track reproduction times CT and the number of reproduction permission times MT. When a predetermined value has been set to the number of track reproduction times CT, it is decremented by 1.  When the number of track reproduction times CT is zero and a predetermined number (any positive integer) has been set to the number of reproduction permission times MT, since the reproducing operation has been performed the number of reproduction permission times, the reproducing operation of the ATRAC3 data file is prohibited.<br>
Next, a real example of the operation of the EMD terminal in the format according to the second embodiment will be described in detail.  Fig. 3 6 shows an example of a process of which the EMD (Electric Music distribution) terminal downloads a music file having a two-times reproduction limitation.  For simplicity, it is assumed that the reproduction expiration date/time is not limited.  The EMD terminal has the same encrypting circuit (not shown) as the above-described digital audio recorder.  The encrypting circuit authenticates an attached memory card.  When the attached memory card has been successfully authenticated, the encrypting circuit records an<br><br>
encrypted audio file (ATRAC3 data file) to the memory card.  In addition, the EMD terminal supplies reproduction limitation information of the audio file to the digital audio recorder.<br>
The digital audio recorder performs a formatting process for the audio file and the reproduction limitation information and records the formatted data to the flash memory.  In Fig. 36, when the EMD terminal downloads data to the digital audio recorder, it performs a process denoted by S201.  At step SI, the digital audio recorder receives data having a reproduction times limitation from the EMD terminal and sets (MT = 2) and (CT = 2) to TRKINF of the track information management file TRKLIST.<br>
In addition, the hash calculating circuit 71 calculates hash values of several parameters (reproduction limitation value block 70) including MT, CT, and CONTENTS ID.  The hash values calculated by the hash calculating circuit 71 is stored to the memory area 73 of the encrypting circuit 22.  Thereafter, when the power of the digital audio recorder is turned off or when the memory card 40 is detached, the reproduction limitation value block 70 is checked for forged information.  If necessary, whenever the reproducing operation is performed, the reproduction limitation value block 70 can be checked for forged information.<br><br>
After the memory card 40 is detached and then attached again, when the reproduction command is issued at step S3, the flow advances to step S202.  At step S4, the hash calculating circuit 71 calculates hash values of the reproduction limitation value block 70. The hash values calculated by the hash calculating circuit 71 are stored as current hash values to the memory area 72 of the encrypting circuit 22.  The current hash values and the former hash values are read and supplied to the match detecting circuit 74.  The match detecting circuit 74 compares the current hash values with the former hash values.  Depending on whether they match, the match detecting circuit 74 determines whether or not the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged.  The match detecting circuit 74 supplies the detected result to the controlling portion 75.<br>
Corresponding to the output data of the match detecting circuit 74, the controlling portion 75 forms control information.  In other words, when the reproduction limitation value block 70 has not been forged, since the current hash values are the same as the former hash values, forged information is not detected.  In this case, since the number of reproduction times CT is not zero (CT *  0), the flow advances to step S5.  At step S5, the controlling portion 75 forms control information for controlling<br><br>
the reproducing operation and starts the reproducing operation.  After the reproducing operation has been completed, the flow advances to step S6.  At step S6, the number of reproduction times CT is decremented and thereby (CT = 1) is set.  In addition, hash values of the reproduction limitation value block 70 are calculated and stored as the former hash values to the memory area 73.<br>
After the memory card 40 is detached and then attached again, when the reproduction command is issued at step S7, the flow advances to step S203.  At step S203, the same process as step S202 is. performed.  In other words, hash values of the reproduction limitation value block 70 are calculated and compared with the former hash values.  Thus, it is determined whether or not the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged (at step S8).  When the reproduction limitation value block 70 has not been forged, the reproducing operation is performed (at step S9).  Thereafter, the number of reproduction times CT is decremented by 1 and thereby (CT = 0) is set (at step S10).<br>
After the number of reproduction times CT is set to zero (CT = 0), regardless of whether the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged, the number of reproduction times CT is considered with priority.  Thus, the reproducing operation is prohibited.  For example, after the memory card 40 is<br><br>
detached and then attached again, when the reproduction command is issued at step Sll, the flow advances to step S12.  At step S12, hash values of the reproduction limitation value block 70 are calculated and then the current hash values are compared with the former hash values.  Since the current hash values match the former hash values, normally, the reproducing operation is permitted.  However, since the number of reproduction times CT is zero (CT =0), the reproducing operation is prohibited.  Thus, in this case, the controlling portion 75 forms control information that prohibits the reproducing operation (at step S13).  In addition, with a speaker and/or a display, the user is informed that because the number of reproduction times CT matches the number of reproduction permission times MT, the reproducing operation is prohibited.<br>
Next, the case of which TRKINF of the track information management file TRKLIST has been forged will be described.  For example, it is assumed that TRKINF has been forged at step Sill and that the number of reproduction permission times MT of the music file has been forged to 10 (MT = 10).<br>
When the reproduction command has been issued at step S22, the flow advances to step S23.  At step S23, hash values of the reproduction limitation value block 70 are calculated.  The hash values are stored as the current hash values to the memory area 72.  The<br><br>
match detecting circuit 74 determines whether the current hash values match the former hash values.  In this case, since the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged, the match detecting circuit 74 determines that they do not match.  Thus, the controlling portion 75 forms control information that prohibits the reproducing operation (at step S23). Thus, at step S24, the reproducing operation is not performed.  In this case, with the speaker and display, the user is informed that because the reproduction limitation value? block 70 has been forged, the reproducing operation is prohibited.<br>
Thereafter, the flow advances to step S25. At step S25, the forging flag is set to a predetermined position (for example, the area "Reserved" shown in Fig. 27) of TRKINF of TRKLIST.  The hash values are calculated and stored.  In the state that the forging flag has been set, even if the number of reproduction permission times MT is set to 2 (MT = 2), since the forging flag has been set, the reproducing operation is prohibited (at step S26).  In other words, before an ATRACK3 data file is reproduced, the forging flag is checked.  When the forging flag is detected, the controlling portion 75 determines that reproducing operation is prohibited.  Thus, in this case, the controlling portion 75 forms control information that prohibits the reproducing operation.  Thus, the<br><br>
reproducing operation is not performed.<br>
In the above-described example, whenever the reproducing operation is performed, the number of reproduction times CT is decremented by 1.  When the number of reproduction times CT becomes zero (CT = 0), the reproducing operation is prohibited. Alternatively, whenever the reproducing operation is performed, the number of reproduction times CT may be incremented by 1.  When the number of reproduction times CT is equal to the number of reproduction permission times MT (MT = CT), the reproducing operation may be prohibited.  As another alternative method, the number of reproduction permission times MT may be decremented by 1 without the number of reproduction times CT.<br>
Next, the case of which only the reproduction expiration date/time (YMDhms-E) of a track having a reproduction limitation has been set to TRKINF of TRKLIST without the number of reproduction permission times MT and the number of reproduction times CT.<br>
When a music file having a reproduction expiration date/time is downloaded from the EMD terminal to the memory card, the reproduction expiration date/time is written to the track information management file of the memory card.  Hash values of the reproduction limitation value block 70 including the reproduction expiration date/time are<br><br>
calculated.  The hash values are stored as former hash values to the memory area 73 of the encrypting circuit 22.  Thereafter, when the power of the digital audio recorder is turned off, when the memory card 40 is detached, or if necessary, when the reproduction command is issued, before the reproducing operation is performed, the reproduction limitation value block 70 is checked for forged information.  In addition, the date/time of the inner clock 76 of the controlling portion 75 is matched with the reproduction expiration date/time.<br>
After the memory card 40 is detached and then attached, when the reproduction command is issued, hash values of the reproduction limitation value block 70 are calculated.  The match detecting circuit 74 compares the hash values currently calculated with the hash values formerly calculated.  Depending on whether they match, the match detecting circuit 74 determines whether the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged.  In addition, the match detecting circuit 74 compares the date/time of the inner clock 76 with the reproduction expiration date/time.  When the reproduction limitation value block 70 has not been forged and the date/time of the inner clock 76 is before the reproduction expiration date/time as the determined results of the match detecting circuit 74, the reproducing operation is performed.<br><br>
On the other hand, when the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged as the determined results of the match detecting circuit 74, the reproducing operation is prohibited.  In addition, when the date/time of the inner clock 76 exceeds the reproduction expiration date/time as the determined results of the match detecting circuit 74, even if the reproduction limitation value block 70 has not been forged, an expiration flag is set to a predetermined position (for example, the area "Reserved" shown in Fig. 27) of TRKINF of TRKLIST.  In addition, the reproduction expiration date/time is determined with priority against whether or not the reproduction limitation value block has been forged.  Thus, the reproducing operation is prohibited.<br>
In other words, before a data file is reproduced, the current hash values and the former hash values are compared.  When they do not match, since it is determined that the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged, the reproducing operation is prohibited.  However, even if the current hash values match the former hash values, unless the reproduction expiration date/time is proper, the reproducing operation is prohibited.  When the reproducing operation is prohibited, with the speaker or display, the user is informed of a relevant message.  Even if the date/time of the inner clock 76 exceeds the<br><br>
reproduction expiration date/time, hash values of the reproduction limitation value block 70 are calculated and stored against future forged information.<br>
Next, the case of which only the music file reproduction start date/time (YMDhms-S) rather than the number of reproduction permission times MT and the number of reproduction times CT has been set to TRKINF of TRKLIST will be described.<br>
When a music file is downloaded from the EMD terminal to a memory card, the reproduction start date/time is written to the track information management file.  Hash values of the reproduction limitation value block 70 including the reproduction expiration date/time are calculated and supplied to the encrypting circuit 22.  The hash values are supplied to the encrypting circuit 22.  The hash values are stored as former hash values to the memory area 73 of the encrypting circuit 22.  When the power of the digital audio recorder is turned off or when the memory card 40 is detached, before the reproducing operation is performed, it is determined whether or not the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged. In addition, it is determined whether the date/time of the inner clock 76 of the controlling portion 75 matches the reproduction start date/time.<br>
For example, after the memory card 40 is detached and then attached, when the reproduction<br><br>
command is issued, the current hash values and the former hash values are compared.  Corresponding to whether or not they match, it is determined whether or not the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged.  In addition, the date/time of the inner clock 76 and the reproduction start date/time are compared. When the reproduction limitation value block 70 has not been forged and the date/time of the inner clock 7 6 exceeds the reproduction state date/time as the determined results, the reproducing operation is permitted.<br>
On the other hand, when the reproduction limitation value block 70 has been forged, as with the above-described case, the reproducing operation is prohibited.  In addition, even if the reproduction limitation value block 70 has not been forged, when the date/time of the inner clock 76 does not exceed the reproduction start date/time as the determined results, the reproduction start date/time is determined with priority against forged information.  Thus, the reproducing operation is prohibited.<br>
In the above-described example, to detect forged information, hash values of individual parameters (CONTENTS ID, number of reproduction times CT, number of reproduction permission times MT, reproduction expiration date/time, and reproduction start date/time) of the reproduction limitation value<br><br>
block are calculated.  Alternatively, these hash values may be calculated for each music file.<br>
In the above-described example, the present invention was applied to a digital audio recorder. Alternatively, the present invention can be applied to other {apparatuses^ that deal with other types of data such as video data, audio data, program data, and so forth.<br>
According to the present invention, hash values of reproduction limitation information are calculated.  The obtained hash values are stored in a memory area that cannot be accessed from the outside of the apparatus.  Depending on whether the former hash values and the current hash values match, it is determined whether or not reproduction limitation information has been forged.  When the controlling portion detects forged information corresponding to the output data of the comparing means, the controlling portion prohibits the reproducing operation.  Thus, according to the present invention, forged information can be securely detected.  When forged information is detected, the reproducing operation of the file having the forged information can be prohibited.<br>
Although the present invention has been shown and described with respect to a best mode embodiment thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and various other changes,<br><br>
omissions, and additions in the form and detail thereof may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br><br>
