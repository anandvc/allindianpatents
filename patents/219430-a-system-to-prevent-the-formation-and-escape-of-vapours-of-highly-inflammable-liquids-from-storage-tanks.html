GRANTED<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system to prevent formation and escape of vapours of highly inflammable liquids from storage tanks. More particularly it relates to a system that prevents formation and escape of vapours of highly inflammable liquids such as petroleum products viz. petrol, gasoline, or such other volatile solvents like alcohols, acetone etc. The present invention prevents escape of vapours from storage tank during decantation of such inflammable liquids from mobile tankers to the storage tanks or removing these liquids from the storage tanks during their reuse such as refilling of automobiles tanks etc. Still more particularly it relates to the said system provided for preventing escape of the vapours of inflammable liquids wherein underground/onboard storage tanks are used. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Transportation of gasoline or highly inflammable liquids, with very low boiling point, like organic solvents is generally done through tankers which transport these liquids from the place of manufacturing or storage to the actual user points. The transportation of gasoline products particularly petrol as is generally and commonly known, is done using mobile tankers. The tankers are decanted into the storage tanks, underground/onboard, at the actual place of use or distribution such as petrol pumps. During such decantation considerable amount of vapours escape from the vents of the underground storage tanks (UST). In tropical countries, the variation in atmospheric temperatures is extreme. This variation between maximum and minimum temperatures may be up to 30 °C. The transfer of petrol is done mostly in daytimes wherein  the temperature  may  range  between  20  to 40  °C<br>
2<br><br>
throughout the year except in winter season. About 10, 000 litres of petrol is decanted to the UST in about 80-90 minutes. This operation which is done at high temperature results in heavy loss of petrol vapours to the atmosphere. Higher the temperature at the decantation, higher is the loss of vapours. It is estimated that the vapour loss.is to the tune of 0.4% at each transfer. Refuelling losses also contribute to VOC concentrations in ambient air. Considering the adverse impacts of VOCs on human health, climate and ecosystem, need of vapour recovery system at refueling units is evident. The vapour recovery system will help in reducing the ambient concentrations of Total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) in air and as well save the gasoline of the order of three Giga grams per year at two cities Delhi and Mumbai. (only) Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are important air pollutants in urban atmosphere. Some of the VOCs are toxic, potentially carcinogenic and mutagenic at concentrations levels found in urban environment {Edgerton et. al., 1989). Exposure to VOCs is of concern as it may result in significant risk to human health. Evaporative emissions of VOCs from gasoline distribution network are also one of the important sources of VOCs in ambient air.<br>
The problem of escape of the vapours to the atmosphere is severe during the transfer of the petrol from the tankers to UST or during fuelling of the automobiles wherein the petrol is transferred to the vehicles from the UST. This is also true in respect of transfer of the inflammable solvents from mobile tankers to UST or transfer for use from UST to place of use of such solvents in the industrial processes. As these transfers are done at a very high speed (approximately 5000/per 20-40 min) the loss of vapours is also<br>
3<br><br>
very high. During decantation of petrol from mobile tankers also the mixture of petrol vapours and air is displaced in atmosphere from the UST vents causing loss of the costly petrol and adding polluting VOCs in the atmosphere.<br>
The problem of loss of petrol vapours is tackled in Western countries using vehicles provided with "onboard refueling vapour recovery (ORVR) system or dispenser nozzles typicaJJy equipped witn vapour recovery systems. However such systems recover only partial petrol vapour - air mixture during refueling. The Healy 800 nozzle for Healy system used in western countries reduces the volume of air returned to the UST to approximately 25% of the liquid volume dispensed to an ORVR equipped vehicle. This causes problems in the busy service stations as ORVR refueling can cause the vapour pressure in the UST to drop to level below the set value at which the UST relief vent will open causing inflow of air into UST.<br>
The US patent No. 6,805,172, teaches a vapour space pressure control system for underground gasoline storage tanks. The said method and the system controls the pressure in the ullage vapour space of a volatile liquid fuel underground storage tank temporarily, during periods of increasing ullage vapour space pressure, allows vapour to flow into an auxiliary vapour space of variable volume, defined at least in part by a resilient wall member, thereby to rescue the volume of vapour otherwise released to the environment. The said passive pressure control system comprises of a tank containing a bladder. The said tank is provided a vent pipe having a pressure/vacuum relief valve set to ingest air into the ullage vapour space in response to the vapour space vacuum at -8 inch Water column (W.C.) and to<br>
4<br><br>
release the vapour from ullage space in response to the vapour pressure over +3 inches W.C. The storage tank is provided with a thin wall urethane bladder defining an auxiliary vapour space volume in communication with the underground storage tank vapour space and also defines an air space in communication with atmosphere through an air relief valve set to open at +3/4 inch W.C. to release air from the air space or at -3/4 inch W.C. to ingest air into the air space of the UST. The passive pressure control method provided by the said patent works well during refueling of with ORVR fitted motor vehicles and where the petrol distribution stations are provided with Healy 88 nozzles. In India, at present, these systems are not mandatory at the petrol pumps. The vehicles also are not at all provided with ORVR facilities. Hence there is a need to develop a system which will work well in conditions prevailing in the developing countries worldwide. The prior art system contains mixture of inflammable petrol and air. This being explosive there is always a danger of explosion. The system provided by the present invention has no such drawback and hence the hazards due to explosion are minimized.<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a system to prevent the<br>
formation and escape of vapours of highly inflammable liquids from storage<br>
tanks.<br>
Another object is to provide a system to prevent the formation and escape of<br>
vapours of highly inflammable liquids such as petroleum products like petrol,<br>
gasoline, or such other volatile solvents like alcohols, acetone during transfer<br>

of such liquids from the mobile tankers to the underground storage tanks or<br>
vice-versa.<br>
Another object is to provide a system which can be installed with necessary<br>
modifications tothe existing system at a very low cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a system of tackling the problem<br>
of escaping of the petrol vapours to atmosphere, more particularly during the<br>

volume (11) provided with a manhole (21) and (18) respectively, each of the<br>
said   UST  (1)   and   OBT   (10)   being   provided  with  a   single  and/or<br>
interconnected plurality of flexible bladder(s) (3) and (12) respectively, the<br>
said bladders suspended in the air space volume (2) and (11) of UST and<br>
OBT, the said single bladder secured in the vapour space to a connecting<br>
means (7) extending in vapour space of both UST and OBT by mounting<br>
means (6) and (9)   the said connecting means (7) being provided with a<br>
safety valve (8) at the OBT end.<br>
The UST (1) is provided with an opening (16), which acts as an inlet and<br>
outlet.<br>
The said opening (16) connected to the said UST by said connecting means<br>
(4) and (5).<br>
The flexible single and/or plurality of bladders (3) and (12) in the UST and<br>
OBT respectively are connected to each other by a connecting means (7)<br>
such as a pipe, passing through the airtight flange(s) of UST and OBT,<br>
In still another embodiment the said connecting means (7) is provided with a<br>
safety pressure or a vacuum valve (8).<br>
The UST provided with a liquid dispensing or a pumping mechanism (20)<br>
through a nozzle (19).<br>
9<br><br>
The singular or plurality of bladder(s) in the UST and OBT is/are thin walled<br>
urethane bladder.<br>
In another embodiment the said singular or plurality of bladder(s)(3) and (12)<br>
are adaptably mounted on a connecting means (7) extending in both the UST<br>
and OBT using mounting means (9) and (6).<br>
A system as described herein is used for preventing and escaping the fuel<br>
vapours from  the. storage tanks of the  automobiles with  mechanical<br>
modification such as providing an additional tank similar to OBT with<br>
connecting means (7), mounting means and bladders.<br>
A method of preventing escaping of vapours of highly inflammable liquids<br>
comprising the steps of:  decanting the inflammable liquid to the UST from<br>
the mobile tanker, wherein the air displaced from the vapour space of the<br>
UST due to filling of the liquid passes into and accommodated the bladders in<br>
the OBT through connecting means (7) effecting the said bladder(s) in the<br>
OBT to inflate to accommodate the increase in air space volume of the said<br>
UST without any loss of vapours., UST comprises single or plurality of<br>
bladders suspended in the air space volume of the said UST; when the UST<br>
is empty these bladders are in inflated condition because of air inside these<br>
bladders, the inflated bladder afford very little volume for vapour formation in<br>
the air space of the UST.<br>
In one of the features of the present invention the UST and OBT are secured<br>
to ground or support by concrete foundations (14).<br>
In another feature of the present invention the system provided by the<br>
present invention could be installed after retrograde modifications of the<br>
10<br><br>
existing UST, suitably adapting the available facilities to provide the OBT and the bladders after necessary mechanical modifications. In yet another feature of the present invention the UST (1) is provided with a safety valve (17).<br>
In another embodiment the OBT (10) is provided with an opening (13). Whenever petrol or highly inflammable liquid is decanted to the UST (1) from the mobile tanker, the sir space volume of the UST (1) is Filled by the decanted liquid resulting in building pressure due to formation of mixture of vapours of liquid and air, thereby displacing the air in the bladder(s) (3) of the UST (1), the displaced air from the bladder(s) is carried to the bladder(s) (12) of OBT (10) through connecting means (7), and the said bladder(s) (12) inflate(s) to absorb mixture of the petrol vapour and air. This creates the equilibrium of pressure in the UST (1) and OBT (10) and escape of vapours of petrol/inflammable liquid from UST (1) to atmosphere is prevented. In an embodiment of the pressure equilibrium system provided by the present invention comprises means for temporarily during the increased ullage vapour pressure reduction in the bladder(s) (2) volume causing corresponding increase in the volume of the bladder(s) (12) of the OBT triggering inflation of the said bladder(s) to equalize the pressure and during refilling of the automobiles, means for temporarily during the decreased ullage vapour pressure, inflation of the UST bladder(s) (2) causing corresponding decrease in the volume of the bladder(s) (12) in the OBT triggering deflation of the said bladder to equalize the pressure. When petrol or highly inflammable liquid is siphoned out of the UST (1) for refueling the automobiles or use in the industry, the vapour pressure in the<br>
11<br><br>
UST (1) drops and is vacuum created by the siphoning the petrol/inflammable liquid. This vacuum is created in the UST (1) causing bladder (3) to inflate, triggering transfer of corresponding volume of air from the bladder (12) to bladder (3) of UST (1) to bring the said bladder (3) to its original volume very slowly in a period of about 24 hours Thus the system provided by the present invention provides pressure equilibrium by inflation and deflation of bladder (3) and bladder (12). As these bladders are connected to each other, there is no loss of vapours to the atmosphere. In a feature of the present invention the pressure equilibrium system provided by the present invention may be associated with other conventional safety and vent means.
