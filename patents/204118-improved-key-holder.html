The following specification particularly describe; nature of the invention and the manner in which i' to be performed : -<br><br><br>
IMPROVED KEY HOLDER<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
5   OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present specification refers to an improved key holder providing the possibility of grouping a number of keys incorporated inside a containing body, it- being 10 possible to select the requested key, found grouped and ordered inside the containing body from which it may be roinovod in cane of replacement thereof,<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
15<br>
This invention is applicable to the industry dedicated<br>
i<br>
to the manufacture of key rings, key holders and similar items, it also being possible to be used in the industry dedicated to the manufacture of general accessories. 20<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  applicant  is  the  holder  of  a  Utility  Model requested in Spain with the number 9300466, published and 25  granted with the number 1,023,911, regarding a KEY HOLDING DEVICE.<br>
The applicant is also the holder of a Utility Model requested in Spain regarding an IMPROVED KEY HOLDER, as well 30  as an Industrial Design requested in Spain with the number 134,959 regarding a KEY.<br>
Beyond the aforementioned files, the applicant ignores the existence of an invention having a minimum relation with 35  that described in this specification.<br><br>
In the aforementioned Utility Models, a hollow body was described inside of which slit a second body holding a special key configured as a key shaft whose head had. been eliminated and which duly adapted was coupled to an axis or 5 transverse pin fixed in the internal ends of the sliding body inside the external body, the key being removed by manipulating the carrying axis thereof from outside.<br>
The  applicant  has  observed  the  existence  of  some<br>
10  anomalies in the general operation of the items mentioned<br>
above, such that an invention has been carried out whose<br>
object, being the same as above, has novel features with<br>
relation to the known items.<br>
15  'DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The improved key holder proposed by the invention is<br>
configured as  an  evident  novelty within  its  field  of<br>
application, combining in its context a series of important<br>
20  advantages which clearly improve the objects protected in<br>
similar applications.<br>
The improved key holder has an external part acting as a general casing inside of which the rectified key holding<br>
25 component is incorporated joined to the coupling axis. In its upper part, said case has a semicircular configuration and in the lower part a configuration with the shape of a semicircular arch seen sideways, provided in its front face with a longitudinal groove located in the central area,<br>
30 which partially penetrates in the curved lower area and in turn is located in the semicircular upper area finishing in the rear face which is blind.<br>
Matching  the longitudinal  groove,  the curved  lower 35  area  has  a  protuberance  with  a  central  perforation<br><br>
applicable to fix a support chain, ring or similar.<br>
The internal part which slides in both directions inside the case, adopts a lateral configuration similar to 5 the body in which it couples, the front face being totally free and the rear face being provided with a grooved wall in the external part and a traverse in the upper area, it being necessary to mention that on the internal blind face, the case has a double projection consisting of a guide which in 10 collaboration with an emerging spigot guide the internal body and in turn, slows it down by the introduction of the spigot in the aforementioned longitudinal and parallel grooves.<br>
15 In the internal central area of the upper zone of the sliding body, holder of the key shaft, a transverse body has been foreseen, centred in the semicircular area having a recess in the upper part which, together with a double spring existing in the internal area of the case in the<br>
20 curved or semicircular area, also facilitates guidance of the internal body, being coupled over the transverse axis some plastic parts provided with a central semicircular recess in the middle area and over its surface, an area of reduced dimension where the upper end of the key shaft in<br>
25 which it is fixed is coupled, prior reduction of the key thickness in question being coupled and on being introduced in the axis holder duly aligned.<br>
The set of keys is vertically situated inside the 30 holding body, which is then embedded in the case to be later incorporated matching the central groove, a semicircular body provided with a transverse spring generating removal of the key in a vertical ascending direction, prior selection thereof, the key being suitably configured as a conventional 35  one which in replacement of the head thereof, will have the<br><br>
general body of key holder and aligned with the emerging shaft will produce the opening of the lock.<br>
Once the. key has been used, it will be moved by means 5 of the transverse projection until this is coupled inside the key holder, the key ring or improved key holder consequently being in conditions to be again introduced in the user's pocket until being used again.<br>
10 It should be clearly indicated that beyond the parts comprising the case, holding body, key coupling part and the semicircular component applicable as remover thereof, the keys which should be used in this key holder should be previously machined in the area of the head to permit their<br>
15  coupling in the holding part which will be later coupled over the axis, which has a groove facilitating removal thereof.<br>
All the parts used to manufacture the key holder, 20  except the key itself, are manufactured in plastic material.<br>

Figure 13 finally shows a view of the invention when the key has been removed, remaining in the position of being used.<br>
5   PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
On observing figure 1, it may be appreciated how the case (1) of the improved key holder is constructed as from a long hollow body in which the case  (1)  has been shown,<br>
10 having a central body (2) with parallel walls terminating in the upper part with a semicircular configuration (3) in which a groove (6) has been foreseen, longitudinally dividing the front face in two identical areas, passing through the semicircular area (3) and terminating in the<br>
15 reverse once the semicircular area (3) has been surpassed, the body (2) finishing in the lower part through an area curved like an inverted semicircular arch (4) which externally has a protuberance (5) intended to be used as a nexus for fixing a chain or similar item.<br>
20<br>
If we observe figure 2, we may find two rectangular projections between which there is a groove (7), the combination acting as the body guide (10), likewise having a projection (8) intended to be used as an immobilising brake.<br>
25<br>
In figure 3, it is observed that the body (10) shown in profile in figure 4 is configured in its sides similar to the internal area of the case (1) having two semicircular upper areas (12) and (12'), two straight areas  (11) and<br>
30 (11') and terminating in the lower part as a not numbered semicircular shape.<br>
The areas (12) and (12') are joined to each other by a<br>
transverse body (14) which acts as an axis provided with a<br>
35  bottleneck • (15), this area (14) being destined to be used as<br><br>
an axis for placing the keys incorporated in the general body (10).<br>
The invention has an upper wall (18) located 5 parallel' to an area (16) in which there are vertical and parallel grooves (17), the body (10) moving inside the body (1) guided by the projections (1) which are coupled between the walls (16) y (18), whilst the longitudinal projection (8) acts as a body (10) brake 10  over!;-, it (1) on being introduced in the grooves  (17)<br><br>
situ<br><br>
ated in parallel.<br><br>
It should be mentioned that in the upper part of the bodies (12) a slot (13) has been foreseen which will permit 15 \a projection (9) existing inside the case (1) matching the upper internal area of the semicircular area (3) permits its mobilisation as a guide, collaborating with area (7) and the brake (8).<br>
20 In figure 5, the part is observed where the key shaft is coupled, which has been referenced with number (20) , having a practically circular body (21) in which there is an opening (22) finished in a semicircle and two lateral steps (24) which in collaboration with a central area (23) of<br>
?.[&gt; i (-(JIH.'CUI l.li I ckim.MM, poi.mlL I.lint, t.ho koy, oner .1 L;i t.h.l ckiiuriM has been reduced and its head eliminated, is left without any mobility inside the part (20) , specifically in area (23), to later proceed to fit the key inside the part (10) adjusting it to the carrying axis (14) using the notch or<br>
30 perimetric bottleneck (15) to facilitate its introduction and later coupling.<br>
Finally, the improved key holder is completed with the<br>
annular component shown in figure 6 in which it is observed<br>
35  how this component (30) has a semicircular area (31) and a<br><br>
transversely thickened component (32) which acts as a coupling area for the user's finger to proceed to mobilise the key (40) located inside the part (10) and which will emerge outside in a vertical ascending direction through the 5  opening or groove (6) as shown in figure number 13.<br>
The selection of the key to be removed is carried out by mobilising the internal body over the external one and once the key to be extracted has been defined, by mobilising<br>
10 the button (32) to achieve that the key (40) fixed in the bed (23) joined to the body (20) coupled over the axis (14) rotates over itself emerging through the groove (6) pushed by the annular component (31) impelled by the button (32), remaining outside and in a position to be used, so that once<br>
15 u^ed, it returns and is reintroduced inside the holding body (10) prior inverse operation.<br>
