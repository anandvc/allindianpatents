				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to dendrimers and transport molecules, to methods of synthesizing dendrimers and transport molecules, and to methods for using dendrimers and transport molecules. In some embodiments, the transport molecules may be used to transport biologically active molecules. In other embodiments, the transport molecules may be used to transport detector molecules. The present invention further relates to pharmaceutical formulations that include dendrimers in combination with one or more biologically active molecules.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A continuously challenging goal in the development of therapeutically useful drugs is to synthesize biologically active compounds that penetrate cells. Although a large number of drug candidates have been synthesized for the treatment of various diseases during the past few decades, many of these candidates have failed in clinical application because of low bioavailability. Therefore, significant efforts ha.ve been undertaken to improve the bioavailability of drugs and to increase their concentration in the bloodstream. The bioavailability of drugs depends significantly on the efficiency of transport into cells, which involves three concurrent steps including administration, membrane penetration, and distribution. To gain high bioavailability, drugs should be sufficiently polar for administration and distribution while sufficiently nonpolar for passive diffusion through the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. As a result, most drugs are limited to a narrow range of physical properties which be effective for the drug delivery process. Many highly promising and important drug candidates often fail to advance clinically because they fall out of this range and cannot achieve the desirable balance of water solubility and passive membrane translocation.<br>
Recently, several efforts have been disclosed with respect to improving the cellular uptake of drug candidates into cells. See (1) WO 79/00515; (2) WO 94/04686; (3) WO 91/09958; (4) WO 98/52614; (5) Pepinsky, R. B. et al. DNA Celt Biol., 13, p. 1011-1019 (1994); (6) Vocero-Akbani, A. M. et al. Nat. Med., 5, p. 29-33 (1999); (7) Schwarze, S. R. et al. Science, 285, p. 1569-1572 (1999); (S)Ryser, H.J.-P. Nature (London), 215, 934-936 (1967); (9) Emi, N. et al. Biophys. Res. Commm., 231, p 421-424 (1997); (10) Ryser, H. J. -P. et al. Proc. Nat!. Acad. Sci. USA., 75, p. 1872-1876 and 3867-3870 (1978); (ll)Leonetti, J. -P. et al. Bioconjugate Chem., 1, p. 149-153 (1990); (12) Murphy, J. E. et al. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 95, p. 1517-1522 (1998); (13) Buschle, M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 94, p. 3256-3261 (1997); (14) Mitchell. D. J. et al. J. PeptideRes., 55, p. 318-325 (2000); and (15) Wender. P. A. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A., 97, p. 13003 (2000). It has been disclosed that certain naturally occurring macromolecules including the HIV-1 protein Tat enter cells through an active transport mechanism. See references (5)-(7). It has also been reported that arginine-rich fragments of HIV-1 Tat are efficiently internalized by cultured cells. See references (2) and (3). Conjugation of oligo-arginine to small molecules or macromolecules has been disclosed as facilitating the delivery of the attached molecules into cells. See references (14) and (15). References (14) and (15) disclose that peptides containing 6 to 15 contiguous arginine residues can increase cellular uptake of conjugated molecules. These references also disclose that the peptoid analogs of 6 to 9 arginine residue peptides display even higher cellular uptake properties. Additionally, these references report that the chirality of the oligomers is not significant with respect to intracellular translocation and that the distance between the backbone and the guanidine head group of these materials is important in transport activity.<br>
Despite the apparent success in the use of peptide-based molecule transporters, including peptides and peptoids derived from arginine, lysine (see reference (8)), and ornithine (see reference (9)), such molecules are limited by their toxicity, availability, and cost. Furthermore, peptide-based molecule transporters may not be sufficiently stable toward intracellular and extracellular protease activity. Upon degradation, such<br>
molecules lose their efficacy as molecular transporters. In addition, peptide-based molecules also suffer from the drawback that such molecules may trigger antigenic responses and may thus be unsuitable for long term use in a patient. Therefore, a need remains for compounds and methods for transporting biologically active molecules such as drugs into cells which exhibit improved efficacy, stability, and which are not cost-prohibitive.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MENTION<br>
As employed herein, "peptide" refers to an organic compound that includes at least one peptide linkage. As employed herein a peptide linkage is an amide bond formed by the reaction of an amino group on a first a-amino acid with a carboxylic acid group on a second a-amino acid. An a-amino acid is an organic compound that bears both a carboxylic acid group and an amine group. The amine group of a-amino acids is bonded to the same carbon atom (the a-carbon) that is bonded to the carboxylic acid group. Examples of a-amino acids with the one letter symbols used to commonly refer to them include alanine (A), arginine (R), asparagine (N), aspartic acid (D), cysteine (C), glutamine (Q), glutamic acid (E), glycine (G), histidine (H), isolecuine (I), leucine (L), lysine (K), methionine (M), phenylalanine (F), proline (P), serine (S), threonine (T), tryptophan (W), tyrosine (Y), and valine (V).<br>
As employed herein, "dendrimer" refers to an organic compound that has at least one branched tree-like structure originating from at least one core atom or at least one core portion of a molecule. In some embodiments, at least two of the branches of a "dendrimer" will be structurally similar to one another. In other embodiments, at least two of the branches of a "dendrimer" will be structurally identical such that molecule has a high degree of symmetry. In other embodiments, a "dendrimer" includes at least three branches that originate from at least one core atom or at least one portion of a core molecule. In still other embodiments, a "dendrimer" includes three branches that originate from at least one core atom or at least one portion of a core molecule and each of the three branches is structurally identical. In some embodiments a "dendrimer" often includes several branched tree-like structures where each branched tree-like structure originates from a core atom such as, but not limited to atetravalent atom, or a portion of a core molecule.<br>
As employed herein, the phrase "is in an identical chemical environment" when used with respect to two or more chemical groups such as guanidine groups, protonated guanidine groups, or protected guanidine groups in a molecule means that the molecule possesses a degree of symmetry such that the groups, while separate and<br><br>
distinct, are identical to one another in the way that they are arranged in the molecule. For example, methane is a tetrahedral molecule with four hydrogen atoms bonded to a central carbon atom. While separate and distinct, each hydrogen atom is in "an identical chemical environment" due to the symmetry of the molecule. As a further example, in chloroform, CHCls, each of the three chlorine atoms "is in an identical chemical environment." Groups that are "in an identical chemical environment" will have identical chemical reactivity. Additionally, if such groups include hydrogen atoms, then each of the hydrogen atoms will have the same chemical shift in the !H NMR spectrum. For the purposes of this application, prochiral groups are considered to be "in an identical chemical environment." Because guanidine groups may be protonated with acids such as trifluoroacetic acid and hydrochloric acid, a molecule with more than one guanidine group in which the guanidine groups are "in an identical chemical environment" may be only partially protonated e.g. one guanidine group in a molecule with five other guanidine groups may be in a protonated form whereas the other five are not. Protonation of the single guanidine group would result in a molecule in which the protonated guanidine group is not "in an identical chemical environment" to the others. Furthermore, the protonation of the guanidine group in such a molecule may also mean that the other guanidine groups are not "in an identical chemical environment" to each of the others because the protonation of the one guanidine group has reduced the symmetry of the molecule. For this reason, Avhen a molecule that includes a number of unprotected guanidine groups is referred to as having guanidine groups that are "in an identical chemical environment," the statement that the molecule is either neutrally charged or that each of the guanidines is protonated is used. This indicates that in order to determine whether a molecule that includes guanidine groups has guanidine groups that are "in an identical chemical environment", the molecule must be considered when all the guanidine groups are either all neutrally charged are all protonated with the same acid. For determination of whether a molecule has groups where each "is in an identical chemical environment", the effect of isotopes on the symmetry will not be considered. For example, a molecule that has three guanidine groups where each "is in an identical chemical environment" when each is neutrally charged or is fully protonated will not<br>
be converted to one where each is not "in an identical chemical environment" because one of the guanidine groups include a D atom rather than a H or includes a different isotope of N or C, or because one of the guanidine groups is bonded to a group that includes a different isotope of 0 or some other element. In other words, the O atoms in a compound such as H2NC(CH2OH)3 will be considered to be "in an identical chemical environment" even if one of the H atoms of one or two of the hydroxyl groups is replaced with a D. The above discussion also applies to amidines, ureido groups, and thioureido groups in a manner analogous to guanidines.<br>
As employed herein, a "tetravalent atom" refers to an atom that is bonded to four different groups.

One skilled in the art will recognize that many of the dendrimers of the present invention possess a high degree of symmetry although this is not required or critical to the invention because the dendrimers of the invention may be synthesized from<br>
unsymmetrical materials such as unsymmetrical tris(hydroxyalkyl)alkanes and unsymmetrical bis(hydroxyalkyl)alkanes. Formation of dendrimers using a convergent synthesis from symmetrical starting materials such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, bis(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 2,2,2-tris(hydroxyethyl)-]-aminoethane, 3,3-bis(hydroxyethyl)-l-ammopropane, 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene compounds, 1,2-disubstituted benzenes, 1,3-disubstituted benzenes, 1,4-disubstituted benzenes, and the like can produce dendrimers with high degrees of symmetry. Convergent synthesis employing symmetrical starting materials also simplifies the synthesis and characterization of such dendrimers and thereby reduces the cost of such dendrimers. In some embodiments, the invention provides dendrimers which possess a degree of symmetry such that each of the guanidine groups, salts thereof, or protected forms thereof; each of the amidine groups, salts thereof, or protected forms thereof; each of the ureido groups, salts thereof, or protected forms thereof, or each of the thioureido groups, salts thereof, or protected forms thereof is in an identical chemical environment when each of the guanidine group, salts thereof, or protected forms thereof; ea.ch of the amidine groups, salts thereof, or protected forms thereof, each of the ureido groups, salts thereof, or protected forms thereof, or each of the thioureido groups, salts thereof, or protected forms thereof is either neutrally charged or is protonated. Although it is not required or critical to the invention, in some embodiments, the dendrimer possesses C^v symmetry whereas in other embodiments, the dendrimer possesses Cav symmetry. Symmetrical dendrimers may possess symmetry represented by other symmetry groups. By way of nonlimiting example, each of the three guanidine groups, protonated guanidine groups or protected guanidine groups in dendrimers 3, 4, 5,10, 17, and the top Transporter shown in Figure 15 are in identical chemical environments. By way of further nonlimiting example, each of the 6 guanidine groups, protonated guanidine groups or protected guanidine groups in dendrimers 11, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 30, 31, 67, 68, and the bottom Transporter shown in Figure 15 are in identical chemical environments. By way of still further nonlimiting example, each of the 9 guanidine groups, protonated guanidine groups, or protected guanidine groups in dendrimers 12, 24, 25, 26, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 69, and 71 are in identical<br>
chemical environments. By way of still further nonlimiting example, each of the 12 guanidine groups, protonated guanidine groups, or protected guanidine groups in dendrimers 13, 32, 33, and 34 are in identical chemical environments.<br>
One skilled in the art will readily recognize that the methods of the invention include the sjaithesis of dendrimers that include at least one group of formula IX or a protonated or a protected form of the group of formula IX<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
where, in groups of formula IX, R is H, a straight chain alkyl group having 1,2,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 carbon atoms, or a symmetrical branched alky] group. Dendrimers that include groups of formula IX or protonated or protected forms thereof include two guanidines or protected guanidines that are in identical chemical environments and may be used to prepare larger dendrimers that include 4, 6, or more guanidine groups. The synthesis of dendrimers that include a group of formula IX or a protonated or protected form thereof may be readily accomplished using the methods of the present invention. For example, the synthesis of dendrimers 3, 4, and 5 shown in Figure 1 may be applied to prepare the bis-guanidine analogs by starting with bis(hydrox}anethyl)aminomethane in place of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane by simply adjusting the equivalents of the reagents to take into account the difference in<br>
the number of branches originating from the tetravalent "methane" carbon atom of the tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and the bis(hydroxymethyl)armnomethane. The dibranched analog of 5 produced in this manner may be used in place of 5 in the reaction schemes shown in Figures 6, 7, 9, 10, ISA, and 14.<br>
Inspection of the various reaction schemes shown in the figures and the reaction transformations described in the examples shows that, in many embodiments, the dendrimers of the invention include amide bonds, but do not include any peptide linkages. They may also include ester bonds in some embodiments, and may further include both amide and ester bonds. The flexibility of the synthetic procedures is such that peptide linkages may be incorporated into the dendrimers if desired. For example, as shown in Figure 5, although dendrimer 14 does not include any peptide bonds, reaction with N-acetyl-Cys(STrityl))-Ala-Ala-COOH produces a dendrimer 15 which includes a linking group that has peptide linkages and a protected sulfhydryl (SH) group that may be deprotected and used to form a disulfide linkage to biological!}' active molecules that include a sulfhydryl group such as, but not limited to, 6-mercaptopurine.<br>
Dendrimers of the invention may include one or more detection molecules that are bonded to the dendrimer. Such dendrimers may be prepared using the same procedures used to produce transport molecules of the invention. For example, dendrimers with detection molecules include compounds 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 22, 26, and 34 in which a detection molecule, fluorescein, is bonded to the dendrimer through a thiourea group.

A therapeutical^ effective dose may vary depending upon the route of administration and dosage form. Preferred pharmaceutical formulations, medicaments., and transport molecules of the instant invention include formulations that exhibit a high therapeutic index. The therapeutic index is the dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects which can be expressed as the ratio between LDjo and EDso. The LDso is the dose lethal to 50% of the population and the EDso is the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population. The LDso and EDso are determined b}' standard pharmaceutical procedures in animal cell cultures or experimental animals. Typical doses typically range from nanaograms to milligrams, or more typically from micrograms to milligrams. Concentrations of liquid pharmaceutical formulations and medicaments generally range from nM to M or more more generally range from nanomolar to micromolar.<br>
"Treating" within the context of the instant invention, means an alleviation of symptoms associated with a disorder or disease, or halt of further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or prevention or prophylaxis of the disease or disorder.

EXAMPLES<br>
Introduction<br>
New non-peptidic, scaffold-based structures that include multiple guanidine groups have been synthesized and characterized. The synthesis and characterization of dendrimers with and without fluorescent tag detection molecules was accomplished. The fluorescent detection molecules were useful in evaluating cellular uptake of the dendrimers. The syntheses of target dendritic molecules was accomplished using a convergent coupling of a core molecule and guanidine-containing structures with and without a fluorescent tag. This approach allows for the preparation of a wide array of molecule transporters and the development of a. library of compounds for clinical investigations. A guanidine-containing key template dendrimer (5) was readily synthesized according to the reaction scheme shown in Figure 1.  A tris(hydroxyalkyl)amino-methane such as<br>
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane was converted to the corresponding tri-nitrile compound by Michel-type addition to acrylonitrile. The three nitrile groups were transformed to ethyl esters under anhydrous acidic conditions to produce amino tri-ester (1) with three ester groups in identical chemical environments. The amino group of compound 1 was then protected with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. Basic hydrolysis of the resulting Cbz-protected amine provided the tri-acid (2). Coupling of tri-acid (2) with a mono-Boc-protected diaminoalkane or diaminocycloalkane (Boc = 7-butoxycarbonyl) such as, mono-Boc-protected 1,2-diaminoethane, 1,3-diaminopropane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,5-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, cis and trans 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, cis and frans 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, and others or a mono-Boc protected diaminoalkene or diaminocj'cloalkene such as mono-Boc protected l,6-diamino-3-hexene, 1,2-cis diaminocyclohex-4-ene, and others, followed by removal of the Boc protecting group with HC1 in dioxane and guanidylation with A/')jV'-diBoc-7Vr"-triflylguanidine (see Feichtinger, L. et al. J. Org. Chen?., 63, p. 8432 (1998)) yielded the Cbz-protected dendrimer (3) that includes three Boc-protected guanidine groups in identical chemical environments. Removal of the Cbz group by hydrogenation over Pd-C in ethanol followed by reaction with N-Cbz-p-alanine using<br>
standard 1 -ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyIcarbodiimide (EDC)/1 -hydrobenzotriazole (HOBt)-chemistry afforded the Cbz-protected chain-extended dendrimer (4) with three Boc-protected guanidine groups in identical chemical environments. Removal of the Cbz protecting group by hydrogenation over Pd-C in ethanol afforded the template dendrimer (5). The coupling of various core structures such as compounds 6, 7. 8, and 9 shown in Figure 2 with template dendrimer (5) was straightforward and involved amide bond formation using appropriate activation reagents such as, but not limited to, HOBt, EDC, and thionyl chloride. Fluorescent detection molecules were readily attached to the dendrimers after removal of the Cbz protecting groups by reaction Avith fluorescein isothiocyanate (FLITC). Subsequent deprotection of the Boc groups provided dendritic molecule containing various numbers of guanidine groups and a fluorescein label for use in analyzing cellular uptake.<br>
The synthesis of a Boc-protected dendrimer (44) with a maleimide group is shown in Figure 13B. The reactive maleimide functional group serves as a site for linking a biologically active molecule to the dendrimer. The Cbz-protected tricarboxylic acid (2) was converted to a dendrimer with nine Boc-protected guanidine groups (42) in identical chemical environments by reaction with the template dendrimer (5) in 93% yield by the typical coupling reaction using EDC and HOBt. Subsequent hydrogenation Avith Pd-C afforded the free amine Boc-protected dendrimer (43). Treatment of the Cbz-deprotected dendrimer (43) with N-succinimidyl 3-maleimidopropionate in DMF afforded the desired dendritic maleimido guanidine with nine Boc-protected guanidine groups (44) in high yield. Various other linkers may be used to bond biologically active molecules to the dendrimers of the present invention. Examples of just some of the linkers and biologically active molecules are shown in Figure 15. An array of linkers may be used to link biologically active cargo molecules to the dendrimers of the present invention. After transport into the cell of a mammal, human, or plant, the cargo molecules are released by enzymatic cleavage such as by proteases, esterases, or phosphatases, by pH-specific hydrolysis, or by reduction within the cell. Although<br><br>
the dendrimers of the invention do not include peptide bonds, linkers containing peptides may be used to secure biologically active molecules to the dendrimers of the present invention as shown in 5 where a biologically active molecule, 5-mercaptopurine, is secured to a dendrimer with six guanidine groups in identical chemical environments through a linker that includes a peptide formed from cysteine and two alanines. Formation of a disulflde bond between the sulfhydryl group (-SH) of the cysteine residue and the sulfhydryl group of the 5-mercaptopurine affords the desired molecule transporter (16).<br>

Synthesis and Characterization of a Template Dendrimer (5) with Three Protected Guanidine Groups<br>
The synthesis of dendrimer (5) with three Boc-protected guanidine groups is illustrated in Figure 1 and is set forth in greater detail below.<br>
Step 1:	Synthesis of 3-[2-Amino-3-(2-cyanoethoxy)-2-(2-<br>
cyanoethoxymethyl)-propoxy]propionitrile<br>
To a suspension of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (5.0 g, 41.25 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (10 mL) was added aqueous 40% KOH (0.63 mL, 4.13 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. The reaction solution was cooled to 0°C, and acrylonitrile (9.0 mL, 136.2 mmol) was added using a S3'ringe. The reaction was then warmed to room temperature, stirred overnight, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with CH2C12 (120 mL) and washed with saturated<br>
aqueous NaHCO3 (2 x 70 mL) and (H2O (2 x 70 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO/t, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by a flash column chromatography (on silica gel, MeOH:CH2Cl2 = 1:10) to afford 11.08 g (96%) of the desired tri-nitrile as a slightly yellow liquid. ]H NMR (CDC13): 5 3.68 (t, J = 6.2Hz, 6H, CH2O), 3.44 (s, 6H, CH2O), 2.60 (t, J = 6.2 Hz, 6H, CH2CN).<br>
Step 2:	Synthesis of 3-[2-Amino-3-(2-ethoxycarbonyIethoxy)-2-(2-<br>
etlioxycarbonylethoxymethyl)-propoxy]-propionic acid ethyl ester (1)<br>
The tri-nitrile prepared above (10.0 g, 35.67 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH (50 mL). The solution was saturated with anhydrous HC1 gas until it became opaque (about 40 minutes), then refluxed for 6 hours. After the reaction was complete, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with CH2C12 (200 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous Na2C03 (2 x 150 mL) and (H2O (2 x 200 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSC&gt;4, and the solvent Avas removed under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by a flash column chromatography (on silica gel, MeOHiQfcClj = 1:10) to afford 11.18 g (74%) of atri-ester (1) as a slightly yellow liquid. 'HNMR (CDC13): 5 4.13 (q, J= 7.2 Hz, 6H, CH2O), 3.68 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 6H, CH20), 3.32 (s, 6H, CH2O), 2.53 (t, J - 6.4 Hz, 6H, CH2CO), 1.25 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 9H, CH3).<br>
Step 3:	Synthesis of 3-[2-BenzyJoxycarbonyIamino-3-(2-<br>
ethoxycarbonyIethoxy)-2-(2-ethoxycarbonyl-ethoxyrnethyl)propoxy]propionic acid ethyl ester<br>
To a solution of the tri-ester (1) (11.0 g, 26.09 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (110 mL) was added aqueous K2CO3 (3.97 g, 28.72 mmol in 11,0 mL of H2O). Benzyl chloroformate (6.0 g, 35.16 mmol) was added dropwise at 0°C, and the reaction was warmed to room temperature stirred for 3 hours. The resulting mixture was cooled in an ice bath, acidified to a pH of about 3 to avoid the hydrolysis of the ester, and concentrated under reduced pressure.

The resulting HC1 salt was dissolved in MeOH (3 mL) and diluted Avith CHC13 (16 mL). To the resulting clear solution was added Et3N (2.0 mL, 14.4 mmol) and then aN,N'-diBoc-N"-triflylguanidine (2.83 g, 7.22 mmol) at 0°C. The mixture was stirred overnight, poured into 50 mL of HoO, and extracted Avith CH2C12 (3 x 50 mL). The organic phase was Avashed with IN HC1 (2 x 50 mL), Avith saturated NaHCOS (50 mL), and Avith H2O (2 x 50 mL) and then dried over anhydrous NaoSC&gt;4.

EXAMPLE 18 Synthesis of Transporters with activated disulfide bonds<br>
For the synthesis of a disulfide dendrimer with six guanidine groups (68), the activated disulfide was attached via peptide coupling prior to deprotection of the guanidines as shown in Figure 35.<br>

The solution was cooled to ice bath temperature and l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-prop3d)-carbodiimide (EDC) (56 mg, 2 eq.) was added. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane (40 mL) and poured into water (50 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3x50 mL). The combined organic layers were then washed with 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid (3x100 mL.), saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution (1x100 mL), and brine (1x50 mL). The solution was dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated. Flash column<br>
chromatography (DCM/MeOH 10:1) gave the product (67) as a colorless foam shaped solid (330 mg, 72%).<br>
To a solution of 67 (100 rag, 35 umol) in 1,4-dioxame (3 rnL) was added 4 N HC1 in 1,4-dioxane (3 mL). After 2.5 hours, the precipitate was filtered off and dried in vacuum. The solid was dissolved in water (I mL) and the aqueous solution was then washed with diethylether (3x1 mL) and lyophylized to give the product (68) as a foam shaped hygroscopic solid (61.4 nig, 85%).<br>
For the synthesis of a disulfide dendrimer with nine guanidine groups (71), the pyridinium disulfide bond was incorporated after deprotection of the guanidines via disulfide formation as shown in Figure 36.<br>
Compound 69 was synthesized from compound 43 (Figure 13A). 6-Tritylsulfanyl-hexanoic acid was coupled to 43 via standard EDC/HOBt coupling. To a solution of 43 (140 mg, 34umol) and 6-tritylsulfanyl-hexanoic acid (67 mg, 5 equivalents) in dichloromethane (2 mL) was added hydroxybenzotriazole (23 mg, 5 equivalents) and triethlamine (24 \iL, 5 equivalents). The solution was cooled to ice bath temperature and l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)-carbodiimide(EDC) (33 mg, 5 equivalents) was added. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred at this temperature for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane (10 mL) and decanted into water (10 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic layers were then washed with 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid (3 x 30 mL), saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution (1 x 30 mL) and brine (1 x 10 mL). The solution was dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated. Flash column chromatography (DCM/MeOH 10:1) gave the intermediate product as a colorless foam shaped solid. (145 mg, 96 %)<br>
To a solution of the intermediate product prepared as described in the preceding paragraph (45 mg, 10 umol) in 1,4-dioxane (1 mL) was added 4 NHC1 in 1,4-dioxane (1 mL). After 4 hours, the precepitate Avas filtered off and dried under reduced pressure. The solid was dissolved in water (1 mL), and the aqueous solution<br>
Avas then washed with diethylether (3 x 1 mL) and lyophylized to give the product 69 as a foam shaped hygroscopic solid (30 rng, quantitative).<br>
To a solution of the HC1 salt (69) (50 mg) in 50% acetic acid was added 2,2'-pyridinium disulfide (70) (20 mg, 100 umol), and the solution was stirred for 48 hours. Soon after the addition of 2,2'-pyridinium disulfide (70), the color of the solution turned light yellow. The solution was then extracted with diethylether until the wash was colorless (6xlmL). Lyophilization of the aqueous layer provided the product (71) as a colorless foam shaped solid (49.7 mg, 96%).<br>
For the evaluation of the dendrimers as molecular transporters, they were coupled to the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and the uptake of the conjugates into HeLa cells was compared to the uptake of a TaLto-sv-GFP conjugate.<br>
Microscopic images and FACS analysis showed that the transport molecule with nine guanidine groups showed the best results in terms of transportation into cells. While the dose dependency measurements showed similar results, the time dependency showed that the conjugated guanidinylated dendrimers penetrated the cellular membrane more rapidly than the conjugate of the Tat derived peptide. (see Figures 39A-39B).<br>
EXAMPLE 19 CELLULAR UPTAKE AND TOXICITY STUDIES<br>
Some of the dendritic molecules synthesized and characterized above include fluorescent tags (fluorescein). The fluorescein enables the cellular uptake of these dendrimers to be readily visualized. In this study, the cellular uptake of each molecular fluorescein-labeled dendrimer is visualized and quantified to assess the usability of each molecule in our work.<br>
Method<br>
HeLa S3, human epithelioid cervical carcinoma cells of approximately 50% confluency were treated with concentrations varying from 250 nM to 50 uM of each of the molecular transporters 10, 11, 12,13, and 41 at 37°C. The molecular transporters were directly added to the media (Dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine semm and Ix antibiotic-antimycotic), and the delivery the cells was visualized by microscopy.<br>
Quantification of the uptake of the molecular transporter into the cells was performed by floAV cytometry 4 hours after treatment. Adherent cells, grown on 6 well plates, were displaced with trypsin, after which the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The final cell pellet was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS to a concentration of approximately 1 x 106 cells/mL. A minimum of 20,000 cell events were counted and analyzed using the FACSCalibur and CellQuest brand software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).<br>
A sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay was performed to determine whether compound 12 showed cytotoxic effects to HeLa S3 cells. The cells were treated with varying concentrations (250 nM to 50 uM) of compound 12 for 4 hours at 37°C. The cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid and were then subsequently stained with SRB dye. The cells were washed with water, and the SRB-bound complexes were solubilized in Tris buffer. The absorbance at 572 nm was measured in each sample.<br>
Results<br>
The cellular uptake of five molecular transporters at each concentration was observed by microscopy. Generally, those transporters possessing higher efficiency of uptake into HeLa S3 cells showed brighter and increased number of cell staining (see Figures 16A-16N). Furthermore, as cells were treated with increasing transporter concentrations, there was also an increase in the number of stained cells. Preferential localization of the transporter to the nucleus and nucleolus (Figures 16A-16N) was observed.<br>
To quantify the number of cells that had taken up the molecular transporter, FACS analyses were performed. Raw data collected by CellQuest acquisition was obtained. An example of one data set illustrating the percentage of uptake of compound 12 at various concentrations is shown in Figures 18A-1SC, 19A-19C, 22A-22C, 23A-23C, 24A-24C, 25A-25C, and 26A-26C. The fluorescing cells of the gated population are shown in M2. The percentage uptake of compounds 10, 11,12, 13, and 41 in HeLa S3 cells is shown in Table 1 and Figures 18A-18C, 19A-19C, 20, 22A-22C, 23A-23C, 24A-24C, 25A-25C, and 26A-26C. The values presented in Table 1 are an average percentage from two separate experiments. As the concentration of molecular transporter increased, there was a gradual increase of uptake into cells until saturation of approximately 100% of uptake was achieved. This was observed for all 5 of transporters 10,11, 12, 13, and 41. Transporters 11 (6 guanidines), 12 (9 guanidines), and 13 (12 guanidines) possess an increased number (&gt;6) of guanidine groups and exhibited excellent delivery to HeLa S3 cells. Transporters 11, 12, and 13 exhibit similar dose-dependent percentage uptake curves (Figure 20).<br>
Table 1. Uptake of FIuorescein-Labeled Dendrimers by HeLa S3 Human Epithelioid Cervical Carcinoma Cells<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Cell viability was maintained with each molecular transporter such that cell count remained similar before and after treatment with the transporter. Furthermore, the SRB assay confirmed that compound 12 exhibited no cj'totoxic effect and did not<br>
cause cell lysis during the 4 hour treatment at concentrations of up to 50 uM (see Figure 21). This was demonstrated by the retention of the absorbance at 572 nm between 0.3 and 0.4 in each sample.<br>
The results presented herein demonstrate that the molecular transporters of the invention are highly efficient and are effectively taken up into mammalian cells such as human cancer cells. Although the percentage of uptake varies between transporters and may vary at different concentrations, these transporters may be employed to deliver biologically active cargo molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and Pharmaceuticals into cells. Based on the preliminary results observed in cellular uptake by HeLa S3 epithelioid cervical carcinoma cells, it is clear that the dendrimers of the present invention may be used to deliver small organic molecules that have poor solubility in aqueous liquids such as serum and aqueous saline. Therefore, bioactive agents with therapeutic efficacies which are limited by low solubility may be administered in greater dosage using the dendrimers of the present invention. Furthermore, linking such drugs to a dendrimer of the present invention results in the production of molecule transporters with drugs that are more efficacious on a molar basis than is the same drug when it is not bonded or tethered to the dendrimer. Consequently, the dendrimers of the invention increase the pharmaceutical acceptability and bioavailability of pre-existing drugs and may be used to create drugs which othenvise Avould not be used due to poor bioavailability especially with drugs that would othenvise exhibit high activity. Biologically active molecules including, but not limited to, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, small molecule Pharmaceuticals, and other pharmaceuticals may be transformed, by linkage to a dendrimer of the invention, from unacceptable candidates into highly efficient candidates for drug development.<br>

Chemical synthesis of synthetic transporters of the branched guanidinium groups<br>
Dendrimers with multiple branched guanidinium groups (nine, six, and three guanidinium groups) were prepared as described above. The G6-GFP and the G9-GFP GFP conjugated compounds were produced by respective!)' reacting compounds 68 and 71 (See Figure 35 and Figure 36) with GFP.<br>
Preparation of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)<br>
The coding region of GFP was inserted in the BamHI/Sall sites of pET21b vector (Novagen, Inc.) for the expression of GFP as a fusion with C-terminal 6 histidine residues (6xHis) in E. coli. A cysteine residue was added at the N-terminus of GFP (pET/Cys-GFP) for conjugating GFP-6xHis with the branched structure of guanidinium groups using a disulfide bond formation. The basic domain of FHV Tat,9-57 (RKKRRQRRR) was also fused to the N-terminus of GFP (pET/Tat^.sv-GFP) as a control. A BL21(DE3) bacterial strain was used for the expression of these proteins. Soluble proteins with a bright green color were highly expressed when they were induced with 0.5 uM IPTG at 25°C overnight. The proteins were first affinity-purified using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Inc.) and then imidazole and salts were removed using a PD10 desalting column (Amersham Bioscience, Corp.) according to the instructions.<br>

Purified Cys-GFP protein (20 uM final in PBS) was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of the branched guanidinium groups with a cleavable disulfide linker (200 MM) in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of DTT (100 uM) at room temperature for 4 hours. The conjugated proteins were first purified in His-affinity column (Ni-NTA) to remove the un-reacted guanidinium groups. Then they were further purified in CM ion exchange column to remove the un-reacted GFP using the<br>
basic charge of the guanidinium groups. The purified proteins were finally desalted on aPDIO column and quantified using BCA assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.).<br>
Treatment of the GFP-conjugated transporters to animal cells<br>
Human cervical carcinoma cell lines, HeLa and HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Dulbeco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Cells were plated in 12-well plates the day before treatment. The cells were treated with GFP-conjugated guanidinium groups and Tati9ov-GFP in 500 j_iL of DMEM without serum. The concentration of the transporters and treatment time were as indicated in each set of experiments.<br>
FACS and microscopic analyses for assessing transduction<br>
After treatment, transporters were removed and cells were washed with 1 mL PBS at least four times. Uptake of the transporters into the cells was analyzed by FACS analysis or by microscopic observation of GFP fluorescence using a FITC wavelength channel. For confocal image analysis, cells Avere plated on the cover glass in 12-well plates and treated with 8 u.M of each transporter for 4 hours. After washing as above, cells Avere fixed with 3.7% para-formaldehyde for 10 minutes, counter-stained for actin and nucleus Avith Texas Red-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and DAPI (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively. Each process Avas performed at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instruction and folloAved by extensive washing with PBS. Finally, cover glasses were mounted on the slides and left in a dark environment to dry. Fluorescence images A^?ere obtained at the magnification of 1000X in the confocal microscope using Avavelengths of 617 nm (actin), 528 nm (GFP) and 457 nm (nucleus).<br>
Results<br>
Conjugation of the branched guanidinium groups with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)<br>
The Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Avas used as a cargo to evaluate the synthetic transporters. Their transduction Avas measured by microscopic images and<br>
statistically quantifiable FACS. GFP for conjugation and Tati9.57-GFP as a control were prepared as described above. Reaction conditions for conjugation were tested and it was found that, a molar excess of 20 fold for the guanidinium groups and 10 fold for DTT to the amount of GFP provided the best result. An increase in reaction time general!)' resulted in an increase in conjugation efficiency, but the incubation for 4 hours showed comparable efficiency to that of 24 hour-incubation (data not shown). Un-conjugated guanidinium groups and GFP were removed sequentially using His-affinity and carboxymethyl (CM) cation exchange columns, respectively (Figure 37A). GFP conjugates of nine (G9-GEP), six (G6-GFP) and three (G3-GFP) guanidinium groups were successfully obtained in high quality (Figure 37B, top).<br>
Transduction of the branched guanidinium groups into animal cells<br>
Transducing activity of the three synthetic transporters with GFP was first assessed in HeLa cells, which is known to be well-transduced by the molecular transporters in several previous reports. When tested with 4 uM concentrations of the transporters for 4 hours, the highest transduction efficiency corresponded to nine guanidinium groups (Figure 37B, bottom). The transduction efficiency peaked at the 4 hour time-point within 2-4 uM concentration range of these transporters, and the test in HeLa S3 cells shoAved similar results (Figures 39A-39B).<br>
Tat basic domain (aa 49-57) is a Avell-knoAvn molecular transporter and contains six arginine residues. When compared in HeLa cells, the transduction of the nine guanidinium groups (G9-GFP) was as efficient as that of the Tat basic domain (Tat49-57-GFP) both by microscopic observation (Figures 38A-38H) and in the FACS analysis for the dose- and time-dependency of transduction (Figures 39A-39B). The transduction efficiency of about 50% was seen at 1 uM and reached near saturation at 2-4 uM for both transporters in 4 hour treatments (Figure 39A). When tested at 2 piM, Tat49-57-GFP shoAved a gradual increase in transduction efficiency depending on the treatment time starting from about 40% transduction at 1 hour and reaching near saturation at 7 hour treatments. The transduction of G9-GFP was faster than that of Tatie-57-GFP shoAving about 70% transduction at 1 hour and near saturation at 2-4<br>
hours after treatment (Figure 39B). Therefore, the nine guanidinium groups with a branched structure proved to be a potent transporter for the delivery of bio-molecules into cells.<br>
Cellular localization of the branched guanidinium groups in HeLa cells<br>
To determine whether the transporters were really inside the cells and their sub-cellular localization, confocal microscopic observation of the GFP fluorescence was performed in HeLa cells as described (Figures 40A-40C). Cells were treated with high concentrations (S |_iM) for each transporter for 4 hours to obtain a high intensity of GFP fluorescence. After treatment, cells were counter-stained for actin (red) and for the nucleus (blue). Tat^.o.sv-GFP mainly localized in the nucleus with an intense speckled pattern (Figure 40B). However this might occur only with high concentrations of the transporter, because a relatively even distribution of Tat^-s?-GFP both in the nucleus and cytoplasm was observed at concentrations lower than 4 fjJVT (Figures 38E-38F). G9-GFP was relatively well spread throughout the cell body with a large proportion in the nucleus (Figure 40C). Interestingly, G9-GFP showed changes in the localization patterns in the time-course experiment at 2 uM in HeLa cells (Figures 41A-41E). G9-GFP localized in the cell membrane until 2 hours, then stained the whole cell body at 4 hours, and showed irregular localization inside of the cells after 7 hours of treatments. This Avas not observed with TaLt.o-sy-GFP under the same conditions, which showed an even distribution in the whole cell body from the early time points of 1 hour after treatment. This pattern of G9-GFP localization is not likely to mean the S!OAV or low transduction activity of G9-GFP in the initial uptake process, because it was very rapid and efficient in the FACS analysis (Figure 39B). Rather, there might be an interaction between G9-GFP and cell membrane holding the transporter in the cell membrane for awhile until some threshold concentration level is reached.<br>
