FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a Push To Connect (PTC) fitting<br>
cartridge used in a pneumatic device, and more specifically to a<br>
high strength plastic PTC cartridge attached to a housing of a<br>
pneumatic device, the system substantially eliminating stress on<br>
the housing due to the PTC cartridge.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Pneumatic devices, such as, air brakes and height control<br>
valves, such as are used on heavy equipment, have been in use<br>
for many years. Pneumatic devices typically utilize a number of<br>
pneumatic lines, which must be connected and interconnected<br>
to the various devices. The pneumatic device typically<br>
comprises a housing to which a number of components may be<br>
connected. The housing is provided with a number of openings<br>
for receiving various connections and component connections.<br>
[0003] Numerous types of connectors may be connected to the<br>
housing and may include, for example, threaded connectors,<br>
friction connectors and so forth. Push To Connect (PTC) fittings<br>
may also be used with various types of housing configurations.<br>
PTC fittings present a number of distinct advantages over other<br>
types of connectors. For instance, it is a relatively simple matter<br><br>
2A<br>
to connect pneumatic tubing with a PCT fitting as one simply<br>
needs to push the connector into a port, where the connector is<br>
retained by an interference fit.<br>
[0004] Typically, PTC fittings are provided manufactured of a relatively<br>
hard plastic. The plastic is typically a highly engineered grade,<br>
having high strength characteristics. This means that the plastic<br>
material will have relatively little "give" as very high strength<br>
characteristics are advantageous for critical applications, such<br>
as, vehicle braking and vehicle ride height control.<br>
[0005] The pneumatic device housing may also be provided with a<br>
highly engineered grade plastic port for receiving the plastic<br>
connector. In addition, various portions of the housing may<br>
comprise a highly engineered grade plastic with relatively high<br>
strength characteristics. Interference fit connectors, such as a<br>
PTC fitting, introduce stress to the surrounding material as the<br>
introduced stress between the connector and the port, maintains<br>
the connection.<br>
[0006] However, a problem arises in particular with vehicle air brake<br>
and vehicle control valve applications, in part, due to the<br>
required relatively high strength characteristics of the PTC<br>
fitting. The press fit induces "hoop" stress in the port and<br>
subsequently the housing, which often results in fracturing in the<br>
surrounding material. Any fracturing of the surrounding material<br>
can result in loosening of the connection and/or catastrophic<br><br>
3<br>
failure of the braking and/or height control system. Any failure<br>
of vehicle safety systems is unacceptable.<br>
[0007] Therefore, what is desired is a PTC fitting manufactured of a<br>
highly engineered grade plastic having high strength<br>
characteristics for use in a vehicle air brake and/or height<br>
control system that substantially eliminates fracturing in the<br>
surrounding material due to introduced stress.<br>
[0008] It is still further desired to provide highly reliable vehicle air<br>
brake and/or height control system that uses a PTC fitting<br>
manufactured of a highly engineered grade plastic having high<br>
strength characteristics that is received in a port of the<br>
pneumatic device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] These and other objectives are achieved in one advantageous<br>
embodiment, by the provision of a PTC fitting cartridge<br>
manufactured of a highly engineered grade plastic having high<br>
strength characteristics used in a vehicle air brake and/or height<br>
control system, which when advanced into a component,<br>
interconnects with an undercut provided in the surrounding<br>
material to substantially eliminate any "hoop" stress to avoid any<br>
fracturing of the surrounding material.<br>
[0011] In this manner, rather that utilize the standard interference<br>
fitting, the PTC fitting cartridge of the present invention uses a<br>
snap fit for retention in the air brake housing or the height<br><br>
4<br>
control valve housing. The highly engineered grade plastic PTC<br>
fitting cartridge will initially deflect radially inward upon<br>
advancement into the connector. The exterior of the PTC<br>
connector is provided with at least one protrusion that upon<br>
advancement of the protrusion past the undercut re-expands<br>
radially outward to interact with the undercut. In this manner,<br>
any "hoop" stress that may initially be experienced by the<br>
surrounding material upon advancement of the PTC fitting<br>
cartridge into the port, is only temporary because the PTC fitting<br>
cartridge is allowed to re-expand to its normal shape past the<br>
undercut.<br>
[0012] As the protrusion(s) interacts with the undercut forming an<br>
interlock between the PTC fitting cartridge and the port, the PTC<br>
fitting cartridge is securely maintained or locked into the port.<br>
Therefore, the convenience of using a PTC fitting cartridge<br>
manufactured of a highly engineered grade plastic having high<br>
strength characteristics may be used in connection with a<br>
vehicle brake housing or a height control valve housing, while<br>
still not compromising the integrity of the pneumatic vehicle<br>
system.<br>
[0013] It is contemplated that the PTC fitting cartridge may further be<br>
provided with means for removing the PTC fitting cartridge from<br>
the port. This may include, for example, means for disengaging<br>
the protrusion(s) from the undercut, such as deflection of the<br><br>
5<br>
protrusion(s) radially inwardly so that the PTC fitting cartridge<br>
may be withdrawn from the port. For example, the PTC fitting<br>
cartridge may be provided with a shoulder on either side of the<br>
PTC fitting cartridge to which inward pressure may be applied to<br>
deflect the protrusion(s) inwardly. In this manner, the PTC<br>
fitting cartridge may then be unlocked from the port and then<br>
withdrawn from the housing.<br>
[0014] In one advantageous embodiment, a pneumatic device<br>
assembly is provided, comprising a housing for the pneumatic<br>
device, where the housing has a port located therein. The<br>
pneumatic device assembly further comprises a push to connect<br>
fitting cartridge receivable in the port, where the push to connect<br>
fitting cartridge comprises plastic and includes at least one<br>
protrusion located on an outer surface thereof. The pneumatic<br>
device assembly is provided such that the port has an undercut<br>
located on an inner surface thereof for receiving the protrusion<br>
to create an interlock between the push to connect fitting<br>
cartridge and the housing, and the pneumatic device is selected<br>
from the group consisting of: a pneumatic brake and a<br>
pneumatic height control valve.<br>
[0015] In another advantageous embodiment, a method for connecting<br>
a push to connect fitting cartridge to a pneumatic brake or a<br>
pneumatic height control valve is provided, comprising the steps<br>
of positioning a protrusion on an outer surface of a plastic push<br><br>
6<br>
to connect fitting cartridge, and positioning a port in a housing of<br>
the pneumatic brake or a pneumatic height control valve for<br>
receiving the plastic push to connect fitting cartridge therein.<br>
The method further comprises the steps of forming an undercut<br>
in an inner surface of the port, inserting the plastic push to<br>
connect fitting cartridge into the port, and forming an interlock<br>
between the push to connect fitting cartridge and the port<br>
through the interaction of the protrusion with the undercut.<br>
[0016] In still another advantageous embodiment, a pneumatic device<br>
assembly is provided, comprising a housing for the pneumatic<br>
device, where the housing having a port located therein, and the<br>
port has an inner surface with a cross section diameter of (d2).<br>
The port also includes an undercut located on the inner surface,<br>
with the undercut having a cross section diameter of (d4), where<br>
diameter (d2) is smaller than diameter (d4). The pneumatic<br>
device assembly further comprises a push to connect fitting<br>
cartridge receivable in the port, where the push to connect fitting<br>
cartridge comprises plastic and includes at least one protrusion<br>
located on an outer surface thereof. The pneumatic device<br>
assembly is provided such that the protrusion, upon<br>
advancement of the push to connect fitting cartridge into the<br>
port, interacts with the undercut to form an interlock, and the<br>
pneumatic device is selected from the group consisting of: a<br>
pneumatic brake and a pneumatic height control valve.<br><br>
7<br>
[0017] Other objects of the invention and its particular features and<br>
advantages will become more apparent from consideration of<br>
the following drawings and accompanying detailed description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0018] FIG. 1 is an illustration of a PTC cartridge to be inserted into a<br>
housing of a pneumatic device.<br>
[0019] FIG. 2 is an illustration of the PTC cartridge according to FIG. 1<br>
inserted into the housing of the pneumatic device.<br>
[0020] FIG. 3 is an enlarged view of the connection between the PTC<br>
connector and the component.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0021] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals<br>
designate corresponding structure throughout the views.<br>
[0022] FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a pneumatic device assembly 10, in<br>
which a Push To Connect (PCT) fitting cartridge 12 is illustrated.<br>
As seen in FIG. 1, PCT cartridge 12 is insertable into port 14 of<br>
pneumatic device 16, which may include, for example, a<br>
pneumatic brake and a pneumatic height control valve.<br>
[0023] The PCT cartridge 12 is provided having a generally cylindrical<br>
diameter, but may, be provided with virtually any type of cross-<br>
section. PCT cartridge 12 is illustrated in FIG. 1 generally<br>
having a cross-section diameter (d).<br>
[0024] PCT cartridge 12 is further illustrated in FIG. 1 having a<br>
cartridge shoulder 28, which is defined having a cross-section<br><br>
8<br>
diameter (di). As can be seen in FIG. 1, cartridge shoulder 28<br>
extends out beyond outer surface 26 of the PCT cartridge 12,<br>
such that, diameter (d^ is larger than diameter (d).<br>
[0025] PCT cartridge 12 is further illustrated having a tube 18<br>
connection, which is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. Tube 18 may<br>
couple to PCT cartridge 12 by means of a tube cavity 20, which<br>
extends from a distal end 22 of PCT cartridge 12. Tube cavity<br>
20 is provided for receiving pneumatic tube 18 therein, the tube<br>
18 coupled to the port 14 via the PCT cartridge 12. Tube 18 is<br>
provided such that, pressurized air may be selectively<br>
introduced and/or exhausted from the pneumatic device 16 via<br>
the tube 18.<br>
[0026] Referring now to port 14 of pneumatic device 16, port 14 is<br>
provided having a generally cylindrical diameter and is provided<br>
with an inner surface 24 that is designed to receive outer<br>
surface 26 of the PCT cartridge 12 in relatively close fit. The<br>
inner surface 24 of port 14 is illustrated having a cross-section<br>
diameter (d2).<br>
[0027] In this manner, it is a relatively simple matter to insert PCT<br>
cartridge 12 into port 14 to couple tube 18 to pneumatic device<br>
16 as is illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
[0028] Port 14 is further provided with a port shoulder 30, which is<br>
designed to abut cartridge shoulder 28 of PCT cartridge 12 as<br><br>
9<br>
shown. As can be seen, port shoulder 30 is provided with a<br>
beveled section 32 to simplify the insertion of PCT cartridge 12.<br>
[0029] Port shoulder 30 is provided such that, when PCT cartridge 12<br>
is inserted therein, PCT cartridge 12 is steadied and securely<br>
maintained therein. Cartridge shoulder 28 is also provided as a<br>
stop for PCT cartridge 12 when cartridge shoulder 28 abuts up<br>
against port shoulder 30. As can be seen, the cross-section<br>
diameter (di) of cartridge shoulder 28 is larger than the cross-<br>
section diameter (d2) of the inner surface 24 of port 14.<br>
[0030] As seen in FIG. 2, tube 18 may be inserted in to tube cavity 20<br>
via tube cavity opening 34. Tube cavity opening 34 is indicated<br>
as having an opening with a cross-section diameter (d3), while<br>
tube cavity is shown having a cross-section diameter (d4), where<br>
diameter (d3) is larger than diameter (d4). In this manner, tube<br>
18 encounters a beveled edge at tube cavity opening 34 to<br>
facilitate insertion of tube 18 in cavity opening 34.<br>
[0031] Referring now to FIG. 3, an enlarged view of a section of FIG. 2<br>
is illustrated, which shows PCT cartridge 12 inserted in port 14,<br>
and more particularly, the interaction of PCT cartridge 12 with<br>
the inner surface 24 of port 14.<br>
[0032] As shown in FIG. 3, outer surface 26 of the PCT cartridge 12 is<br>
provided with protrusion(s) 36, which in this embodiment are<br>
provided as teeth to engage with inner surface 24. Also<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3 is undercut 38, which is situated on inner<br><br>
10<br>
surface 24 of port 14. Undercut 38 is provided to engage with<br>
protrusion(s) 36 such that, upon advancement of PCT cartridge<br>
12 into port 14, a snap fit occurs and an interlock is developed.<br>
For example, the cross-section diameter (d) of PCT cartridge 12<br>
is provided slightly larger than the cross-section diameter (d2) of<br>
the inner surface 24. Therefore, advancement of PCT cartridge<br>
12 into port 14 will generate "hoop" stress on the surrounding<br>
material as the protrusion(s) 36 are slightly deflected radially<br>
inward. However, as the protrusion(s) 36 advance past<br>
undercut 38, the protrusion(s) 36 is then able to expand radially<br>
outward again thereby reliving any "hoop" stress temporarily<br>
encountered by port 14.<br>
[0033] It may also be seen from FIG. 3, that an O-ring 40 is provided in<br>
a channel 42, which is positioned between the inner surface 24<br>
and the PCT cartridge 12. In this manner an air-tight seal may<br>
be created between PCT cartridge 12 and port 14. It is<br>
contemplated that O-ring 40 may comprise any type of material<br>
as desired for the application, but typically will comprise a<br>
pliable elastic material, such as , for example, rubber.<br>
[0034] It can be seen from FIG. 3 that the interlock created between<br>
PCT cartridge 12 and port 14 creates a highly secure<br>
connection, which will not easily be interrupted. This is very<br>
advantageous as the coupling will not loosen or disconnect due<br>
to, for example, vibration.<br><br>
11<br>
[0035] It may however, become necessary to disconnect PCT cartridge<br>
12 for servicing, replacement, etc. As an interlock has been<br>
created between PCT cartridge 12 and port 14, simply applying<br>
withdrawing pressure may not detach the PCT cartridge 12 from<br>
port 14. Accordingly, detaching means are provided in the form<br>
of cartridge shoulder 28, which may be deflected radially inward<br>
to as to disengage protrusion(s) 36 from undercut 38. In this<br>
manner, PCT cartridge 12 may then be easily withdrawn from<br>
port 14.<br>
[0036] In this manner, a highly engineered grade plastic PTC fitting<br>
cartridge may effectively be used for connection of air tubes or<br>
conduits to an air brake or height control valve. Therefore, the<br>
present system allows for the speed and convenience of PTC<br>
fittings to be taken advantage of, while at the same time, any<br>
stress encountered by the surrounding material is substantially<br>
eliminated to avoid fracture of the surrounding material.<br>
[0037] Although the invention has been described with reference to a<br>
particular arrangement of parts, features and the like, these are<br>
not intended to exhaust all possible arrangements or features,<br>
and indeed many other modifications and variations will be<br>
ascertainable to those of skill in the art.<br><br>
