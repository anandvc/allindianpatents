				<td>Inhalator capsules<br>
The invention relates to a capsule as primary<br>
packaging, in particular for pharmaceutical inhalation<br>
formulations. The capsule according to the invention is<br>
an integral component of a ready-to-use powder inhaler.<br>
State of the art<br>
Medicinal aerosol therapy, directed at pulmonary<br>
inhalation, plays an important role in the treatment of<br>
numerous lung diseases. In addition to nebulizers for<br>
liquids containing active substances, powder inhalers<br>
in particular are used for the application of<br>
formulations of active substances in powder form.<br>
In the area of powder inhalers, single-dose and<br>
multidose devices are known. In single-dose powder<br>
inhalers, dosing can be in the form of generally<br>
cylindrical capsules, which contain a powder<br>
formulation. Powder formulations contain the active<br>
substance in micronized form (with a particle size of<br>
approx. 1-5 μm) , and generally one or more excipients.<br>
If a capsule is used as a container, it is opened in<br>
powder inhalers before the inhalation maneuver by<br>
piercing, crushing or cutting, so that the powder can<br>
be entrained from the capsule by the patient's breath,<br>
forming an airborne aerosol, which the patient inhales.<br>
Depending on the device, one or more capsules can be<br>
stored together in the device, or each capsule is<br>
inserted individually into the device at the time of<br>
use.<br>
The capsules that are preferably	used in a powder<br>
inhaler comprise two or more parts	and are preferably<br>
of size 3. Such a powder inhaler	is for example an<br>
inhaler of the HandiHaler® type,	as disclosed for<br>
example in EP 1342483.<br><br>
— 2 —<br>
The manner in which the powder formulation for<br>
inhalation is packaged by the capsule is decisive for<br>
product quality and therefore suitability for use by<br>
inhalation. As a rule the inhalation powder comes into<br>
direct contact with the capsule material, so that the<br>
quality criteria for primary packaging have to be<br>
observed. Optionally, the primary packaging can be<br>
enclosed in a second outer protection, the secondary<br>
packaging, which must be removed before use. As a rule<br>
the secondary packaging encloses the primary packaging<br>
completely. Secondary packaging is used in particular<br>
when the primary packaging does not provide adequate<br>
protection for an unlimited time against e.g. moisture<br>
or other external factors. This secondary packaging can<br>
comprise e.g. film and foil containers made of aluminum<br>
foil (blisters etc.).<br>
In such cases,- as a rule the secondary packaging is<br>
removed first, before the sealed capsule is inserted in<br>
the powder inhaler. There, the capsule is then opened<br>
by an appropriate means of the powder inhaler.<br>
The choice of a suitable material for the capsules is<br>
determined by two factors: on the one hand the material<br>
must be able to fulfill a certain protective function.<br>
On the other hand the material must be of such a kind<br>
that the capsule can be given the form required for use<br>
in the powder inhaler and can fulfill its proposed<br>
function. In the case of the HandiHaler® the capsule<br>
must be of such a kind that the powder can be<br>
discharged as a result of the Bernoulli effect that<br>
arises when the patient inhales.<br>
Capsules for powder inhalers normally comprise hard<br>
gelatins, cellulose derivatives, starch, starch<br>
derivatives, chitosan etc., but capsules made from<br>
synthetic plastics, such as polyethylene,<br>
polycarbonate, polyester, polypropylene or polyethylene<br>
terephthalate etc. are also known.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
The materials used until now have the disadvantage that<br>
they are permeable to moisture from the air in both<br>
directions. There is therefore a need to improve the<br>
ability of the capsules to keep the inhalation powder<br>
stable. Furthermore, materials such as gelatins are<br>
sensitive to moisture and may break if they are too<br>
dry. Conversely, in moist conditions they are sticky,<br>
which hampers efficient filling and/or use of the<br>
capsules, for example in inhalers. In particular, it<br>
may prove difficult to make an adequate or stable<br>
opening in the capsule for release of the powder. Some<br>
portion of the powder may still adhere to the capsule<br>
wall and thus not be available for the therapeutic<br>
effect after inhalation. To summarize, the mechanical<br>
and physicochemical properties of the products known in<br>
the state of the art, including products using the<br>
aforementioned plastics, are not completely<br>
satisfactory.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
One of the main functions of the capsule is to protect<br>
the active substance as well as the entire inhalation<br>
formulation against biological, chemical or physical<br>
alteration. Physical alteration includes in particular<br>
changes that can alter the discharge of the<br>
predetermined dose of fine particles. The term "dose of<br>
fine particles" means the dose that can reach the<br>
patient's lungs. This is influenced by the interactions<br>
of the micronized particles of active substance with<br>
one another as well as the interactions with the<br>
excipients. It has been found that especially as a<br>
result of a change in the moisture level inside the<br>
packaging, these interactions can increase to an extent<br>
that the dose of fine particles is greatly reduced.<br>
Such changes include penetration of water into the<br>
packaging and equally the removal of water from inside<br>
the packaging.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
Therefore a main function of the packaging is to keep<br>
the chemical composition of the atmosphere inside the<br>
packaging constant, in order to avoid physical or<br>
chemical alteration of the formulation of active<br>
substance, or keep the inhalation formulation stable.<br>
In this connection, a distinction is made on the one<br>
hand between a short-term stability that the inhalation<br>
formulation must possess during the period of actual<br>
use {"in-use-stability") , i.e. the period from removal<br>
of the capsule from the additional protective packaging<br>
provided (secondary packaging), inserting in the<br>
inhaler, to opening of the capsule and inhalation of<br>
the inhalation powder and on the other hand the long-<br>
term stability, i.e. the stability that must be<br>
guaranteed for as long as the inhalation formulation is<br>
reliably protected by the unopened protective packaging<br>
(the secondary packaging) . Another aim of the present<br>
invention was to provide a capsule which, while<br>
offering improved protection for the formulation of<br>
active substance, can be produced easily, has<br>
advantageous mechanical and physicochemical properties<br>
and avoids the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
This problem was solved' by making capsules,	such as<br>
those used e.g. in the HandiHaler®, from a	material<br>
that comprises a polymer composition in which	at least<br>
one adsorbent is incorporated.<br>
It was found, surprisingly, that the manner of storage<br>
of powdered inhalation formulations can have a positive<br>
effect on the distribution of fine particles, and even<br>
the proportion of fine particles in the doses<br>
discharged can be increased. It was found that this can<br>
greatly prolong both the long-term stability of the<br>
pharmaceutical formulation as well as the in-use<br>
stability.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to capsules<br>
that can be used together with a powder inhaler and as<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
such are an integral component of the ready-to-use<br>
powder inhaler. The capsules can either be stored in<br>
the devices or they are inserted manually into the<br>
device at each use.<br>
One function of the capsule and its material preferably<br>
comprises delaying and optionally minimizing the<br>
exchange of gaseous substances, in particular water<br>
vapor, between their interior and the surroundings.<br>
Another problem comprises finding a capsule material<br>
that is suitable for making capsules preferably of size<br>
3, which can be used in a Bernoulli-inhaler.<br>
Another problem comprises producing capsules with a<br>
total mass and mechanical stability suitable for<br>
discharge from the inhaler. In this case a density of<br>
gelatine or polyethylene is advantageous.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a capsule, in particular for<br>
the packaging of inhalation formulations, in which at<br>
least one cavity is enclosed by a wall, characterized<br>
in that at least one part of the wall has a polymer<br>
composition that contains at least one adsorbent.<br>
The shape of the container according to the invention<br>
depends on the intended use, e.g. the powder inhaler<br>
that is to be used. Preferably the container according<br>
to the invention is a two-part capsule, with the two<br>
parts fitting into one another telescopically, so that<br>
a capsule with an internal, enclosed cavity is formed.<br>
The inhalation formulation is contained in this cavity.<br>
Preferably the capsule according to the invention is of<br>
cylindrical shape with rounded ends. The pharmaceutical<br>
preparation cannot be discharged by the inhalation<br>
maneuver until the capsule has been opened in the<br>
inhaler. The capsule is preferably an integral<br>
component of a ready-to-use inhaler.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
In this context the term "closed cavity" denotes a<br>
cavity enclosed by walls, from which a powder contained<br>
therein cannot escape without opening it.<br>
The term "inhalation formulation" preferably denotes a<br>
pharmaceutical powder formulation, which preferably<br>
comprises readily nebulizing powder particles of active<br>
substance with a size (mean aerodynamic diameter) of<br>
less than 100 micrometers, preferably from 1 to 15<br>
micrometers, more preferably from 1 to 5 micrometers.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical formulation can contain<br>
a readily flowing, pulverulent vehicle, e.g. lactose,<br>
with an average size 
especially preferably 
improving the nebulizing property.<br>
"Integral component of a ready-to-use inhaler" means<br>
that the capsule or an element is present in the<br>
inhaler, without which charging of the inhaler with the<br>
pharmaceutical formulation (inhalation formulation) for<br>
the purpose of inhalation is impossible or not<br>
provided. The capsule in the ready-to-use state can be<br>
connected rigidly to the inhaler, so that it cannot be<br>
removed nondestructively or without damaging the<br>
inhaler, or it is connected to the inhaler<br>
nondestructively, loosely or detachably.<br>
Ready-to-use means that the container according to the<br>
invention is already inserted in the inhaler. This can<br>
have already been done at the factory, or the capsule<br>
is inserted in the inhaler by the patient. Optionally,<br>
the container is opened mechanically by components of<br>
the inhaler and/or is transported in the inhaler to the<br>
place of discharge. The order of these two steps can<br>
also be changed.<br>
With the capsules according to the invention, an<br>
inhalation formulation is better shielded against the<br>
penetration of undesirable substances, in particular<br><br>
moisture from the surroundings, than is the case with<br>
comparable capsules known from the prior art.<br>
The capsules according to the invention contain an<br>
adsorbent-polymer composition, i.e. at least one part<br>
of the capsule is made of such a material. According to<br>
a preferred embodiment of the invention the capsules<br>
comprise, completely or substantially, an adsorbent<br>
polymer composition, i.e. a polymer composition<br>
containing at least one adsorbent.<br>
In the present description the expression adsorbent<br>
denotes a component that is capable of reacting or<br>
interacting with a chemical, undesirable component in<br>
the capsule (i.e. in the vicinity of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition), which has an affinity for the adsorbent,<br>
and can very probably be retained by the adsorbent.<br>
Although based on different reaction mechanisms, the<br>
expressions "adsorbent" and "absorbent" are used<br>
identically and interchangeably in the present<br>
description.<br>
Preferably, any material can be used as adsorbent that<br>
is able to adsorb moisture or extract moisture from the<br>
surrounding atmosphere in some other way, or any<br>
material that is able to adsorb or otherwise extract<br>
other (undesirable) chemical components from the<br>
surrounding atmosphere, which also includes, without<br>
restriction, oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,<br>
amines, aldehydes, epoxides and alcohols.<br>
In the present description and in the claims that<br>
follow, the expression "adsorbent" can also be used,<br>
according to a preferred embodiment, synonymously with<br>
the expression "drying agent" or "dehydrating agent".<br>
Nonlimiting examples of suitable adsorbents comprise,<br>
among others, silica gels, drying clays or clays that<br>
adsorb moisture or water, aluminosilicates such as<br>
zeolites or bentonites, molecular sieves, activated<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
carbon, alkaline-earth oxides, calcium sulfate or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the adsorbent comprises at least one dehydrating agent.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of preferred dehydrating agents<br>
are silica gel, aluminosilicates such as bentonites or<br>
zeolites, molecular sieves and/or calcium sulfate.<br>
The capsules according to the invention improve the<br>
usability of the filled capsules with respect to their<br>
functionality, their shelf life or storage stability,<br>
including pharmaceutical compositions contained<br>
therein. In particular they prevent negative effects of<br>
moisture or other harmful chemical components on the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions and the capsule material<br>
and any stickiness of the capsule walls due to<br>
increased moisture.<br>
Furthermore, it was found, surprisingly, that the<br>
presence of at least one adsorbent or dehydrating agent<br>
in the polymer composition makes possible, in an<br>
advantageous manner, the piercing, cutting open or<br>
opening of the capsule wall in some other way, in<br>
particular by means of opening devices using pins or<br>
cutters, as used for example in existing powder<br>
inhalers, avoiding breaking apart or fragmentation of<br>
the capsules. Thus, the adsorbent also has an influence<br>
on the mechanical properties of the polymer composition<br>
in comparison with a polymer composition without<br>
adsorbent. This makes it possible, surprisingly, to<br>
provide capsules that have improved barrier properties,<br>
and at the same time have the required strength and<br>
penetrability for it to be possible to make an opening<br>
in the capsule wall e.g. by means of pins or<br>
cutting/opening devices, said opening being<br>
sufficiently large and stable for efficient release of<br>
the pulverulent pharmaceutical composition. It was also<br>
found, unexpectedly, that with the capsules according<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
to the invention, the problem of partial or complete<br>
reclosing of the opening following its production by<br>
cutting or piercing the capsule wall with pins or<br>
cutting/opening devices, but before release of the<br>
powder from the capsule, is less pronounced or can even<br>
be avoided completely. It is assumed, though without<br>
the invention being limited to the accuracy of this<br>
assumption, that this positive effect can be attributed<br>
to the influence of the adsorbent on the mechanical and<br>
physical properties of the polymer composition. Thus,<br>
the capsules according to the invention combine stable,<br>
optimal protection of the powder composition with<br>
improved capacity for release of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition, including with other usual methods of<br>
opening the capsule, e.g. by separating the two parts<br>
of the capsule.<br>
Preferably the adsorbent present in the polymer<br>
composition is a particulate adsorbent. The adsorbent<br>
can thus preferably be in the form of granules or<br>
powder. However, polymeric adsorbents can also be used<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br>
According to an especially preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the polymer composition contains, based on<br>
the percentage by weight of the total composition, at<br>
least 5 wt.%, preferably at least 10 wt.%, in<br>
particular between about 10 and 50 wt.% of adsorbent.<br>
In general, with wall thicknesses greater than about<br>
0.4 mm somewhat higher contents of adsorbent are<br>
preferably used, for example in the range from 10 to<br>
80 wt.%. With thinner capsule walls, preferably of less<br>
than about 0.4 mm, the polymer composition preferably<br>
contains less than 50 wt.% adsorbent. It is of course<br>
possible to adjust the duration and degree of<br>
protection of the pharmaceutical composition packed in<br>
the capsule against harmful chemical components such as<br>
moisture by varying e.g. the amount of adsorbent in the<br>
polymer composition. Adsorption capacity and kinetics<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
can also be adjusted on the basis of the type of<br>
adsorbent. Furthermore, its barrier function can be<br>
adjusted e.g. via the constitution of the polymer<br>
composition, other additives, the content of polymer,<br>
thickness of the capsule wall and the method used for<br>
production of the capsule walls. The specific areas for<br>
exchange between the external and the internal<br>
atmosphere of the capsule can also be adjusted.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the polymer composition (polymer structure) used<br>
contains at least one thermoplastic material.<br>
Thermoplastic materials that can be used are generally<br>
all materials with thermoplastic properties, for<br>
example a polymer that was obtained from a single<br>
monomer, a copolymer from two or more monomers, a<br>
mixture of two or more polymers each from a single<br>
monomer, a mixture of two or more copolymers, or a<br>
mixture of at least one polymer, which was obtained<br>
from one monomer and at least one copolymer.<br>
According to an especially preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the thermoplastic material used is<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene. According to another<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, polystyrene can<br>
be used, especially when welding (e.g. ultrasonic<br>
welding) of the capsule parts is required. Polyamides<br>
may be preferred if for example especially thin capsule<br>
walls are required. To produce somewhat "softer"<br>
properties it is also possible to use silicones, for<br>
example.<br>
Non-limiting examples of polymers (thermoplastic<br>
materials) from single monomers comprise: polystyrene,<br>
polyolefins, in particular polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates,<br>
polyimides, polycarbonates, polyethersulfones,<br>
polyamides, polyesters and polyvinyl chlorides.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of copolymers comprise: ethylene-<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
acrylate, modified polymers and maleic anhydride<br>
copolymers and graft copolymers. If a copolymer or a<br>
mixture is used, it is preferable to use a combination<br>
of monomers or polymers that have (at least) one<br>
chemical monomer unit in common. For example, a<br>
thermoplastic material can be used that contains linear<br>
low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) , low-density<br>
polyethylene (LDPE) and ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer (EVA) , in which each of the components has<br>
ethylene as the monomer unit.<br>
According to one possible embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the polymer composition contains no<br>
elastomer or only small amounts thereof. It was found<br>
that as a result, in many cases the phenomenon of<br>
reclosing of the opening made in the capsule wall for<br>
release of the pharmaceutical composition can be<br>
reduced quite significantly. According to an<br>
alternative embodiment, however, the polymer<br>
composition contains at least one elastomer, and once<br>
again the properties of the adsorbent-containing<br>
polymer composition are especially advantageous for the<br>
primary packaging and release of pulverulent<br>
pharmaceutical compositions. The elastomer can be<br>
selected, for example, from the group comprising<br>
styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), styrene-ethylene-<br>
butadiene-styrene copolymers (SEBS), butyl rubber,<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR), ethylene-propylene-<br>
diene monomer rubber (EPDM), and ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymers (EVA) and butadiene-acrylonitriles.<br>
Preferred materials are plastics that can be processed<br>
by injection molding or blow molding. Moreover,<br>
plastics that can be processed without needing a mold<br>
release agent, which can cause adherence of the filler<br>
on the wall, are advantageous. This has the advantage<br>
that there is no need to clean mold release agent from<br>
the interior of the container, in order for example to<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
satisfy regulatory requirements restricting the use of<br>
mold release agents for primary packaging.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the polymer composition can contain or comprise 5 to<br>
85 wt.% of at least one polymer, in particular of at<br>
least one thermoplastic material, and 5 to 85 wt.% of<br>
at least one adsorbent.<br>
The relative concentration of thermoplastic material<br>
and adsorbent can vary as a function of the<br>
thermoplastic material used and of the adsorbents used,<br>
preferably within the ranges stated previously.<br>
According to an especially preferred embodiment, the<br>
adsorbent polymer composition contains polyethylene, in<br>
particular high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and about<br>
20 to 50 wt.%, in particular 20 to 40 wt.% of at least<br>
one particulate adsorbent or dehydrating agent.<br>
The adsorbent preferably has a maximum particle size of<br>
less than 50 urn, in particular less than 40 urn,<br>
especially preferably less than 25 um, measured in each<br>
case as max. 2% sieve residue. The average particle<br>
size, determined by the laser diffraction method<br>
(Malvern, according to the manufacturer's instructions,<br>
measurement in air) is between about 0.5 and 50 μm,<br>
preferably between 0.5 and 40 μm, in particular between<br>
1 and 20 μm, and more preferably between 1 and 10 μm.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the thickness of the capsule wall, at least in a<br>
section thereof, is between about 0.05 and 2 mm, in<br>
particular between about 0.1 and 1.1 mm, and more<br>
preferably between 0.1 and 0.5 nun. It was found that as<br>
a rule such a wall thickness provides both adequate<br>
stability of the formulation of active substance in the<br>
capsule according to the invention, as well as giving<br>
an advantageous capacity for release.<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
In addition it was found that, according to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the ratio of the maximum<br>
particle size of the adsorbent to the thickness of the<br>
capsule wall should be between 0.01 and 0.2, in<br>
particular between 0.02 and 0.1, as this gave<br>
especially advantageous stability and very good<br>
capacity for release of the formulations of active<br>
substance.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the base mixture is prepared conventionally with the at<br>
least one polymer and the at least one adsorbent, by<br>
heating the polymer (thermoplastic material), to<br>
produce a melt, adding the adsorbent (if not yet done)<br>
and other conventional additives and mixing them in,<br>
after which the mixture can be converted to granules<br>
and stored in this form. Said granules can then be used<br>
for production of the desired structure (capsule), for<br>
example by extrusion forming, but in particular by<br>
injection molding.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the at least one adsorbent is distributed uniformly<br>
over the thickness of the capsule wall or of the part<br>
thereof made from the polymer composition with at least<br>
one adsorbent. In this embodiment the polymer<br>
composition can be regarded as monolithic.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, however, the at least one adsorbent<br>
is present at a higher concentration near the surface<br>
of the capsule wall or polymer composition than in its<br>
interior. Accordingly, the polymer composition used has<br>
at least one migration zone on one surface of the<br>
capsule wall and an inner region, with the maximum<br>
concentration of the at least one adsorbent within the<br>
migration zone being at least twice as high as the<br>
maximum concentration of the at least one absorbent in<br>
the inner region. This is in many cases advantageous<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
with respect to the barrier function of the capsule<br>
wall. Such polymer structures are described for example<br>
in PCT/FR03/03465 or PCT/IB2004/004403. Their<br>
disclosure relating to this is hereby expressly<br>
incorporated in the description by reference.<br>
Generally, however, according to a possible embodiment<br>
of the present invention, any other adsorbent polymer<br>
composition can also be used within the scope of the<br>
present invention, for example those described in US<br>
5 432 214, US 5 911 937, US 4 665 050, EP 0 432438 or<br>
EP 0 400 460. Their corresponding disclosure is hereby<br>
expressly incorporated in the present description by<br>
reference.<br>
As already mentioned, the adsorbent polymer materials<br>
used can further contain (conventional) organic or<br>
inorganic additives such as fibers, stabilizers, dyes,<br>
pigments, expanding agents, or combinations thereof or<br>
also other additives known from plastics processing.<br>
The amount of these additional substances is preferably<br>
reduced to a minimum. According to a preferred<br>
embodiment, the adsorbent polymer composition contains<br>
at least one adsorbing fiber component, in particular a<br>
superabsorber-fiber, e.g. of polyacrylate. According to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, no wicking<br>
fibers are used in the polymer composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the dehydrating plastic does<br>
not possess any pronounced adhesion for pharmaceutical<br>
chemicals, in particular for particles of respirable<br>
size, so that when the container is used in an inhaler<br>
the entire contents of the capsule can be released.<br>
This ensures more accurate dosing, in particular of the<br>
respirable fine fraction of the pharmaceutical<br>
preparation.<br>
Further information on possible polymer compositions or<br>
relating to the possible processing can be found in the<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
aforementioned state of the art, in particular EP-A 0<br>
599 690 and PCT/IB2004/004403.<br>
In one embodiment the container wall can contain<br>
regions with varying composition of polymer /<br>
adsorbent. This applies for example in the case of<br>
capsules that comprise several different parts.<br>
In some embodiments the capsule wall comprises at least<br>
two layers, an inner layer and at least one outer layer<br>
above it. Then the inner layer forms the direct wall of<br>
the cavity and is therefore in contact with the<br>
inhalation formulation. In this case one of the two<br>
layers can comprise the polymer composition with<br>
adsorbent, and the other layer comprises a<br>
pharmacologically neutral material. Sandwich structures<br>
are also possible, in which the outermost layer forms a<br>
first barrier to moisture, the middle layer comprises<br>
the polymer with adsorbent and the inner layer<br>
comprises a pharmacologically neutral material. Other<br>
layer sequences are possible. Suitable<br>
pharmacologically neutral materials are familiar to a<br>
person skilled in the art and comprise (in addition to<br>
the polymer compositions with at least one adsorbent<br>
used according to the invention) for example polymer<br>
compositions or plastics such as polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene or polystyrene.<br>
The materials of the individual layers can	then be<br>
selected so that. they are not joined	together<br>
integrally, or so that they are joined	together<br>
integrally.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the wall of the container is<br>
coated externally with the polymer composition<br>
containing the adsorbent, producing a continuous<br>
sealing surface. This variant has the advantage that on<br>
applying the absorbing, in particular the dehydrating<br>
layer, any joins that the walls of the cavities might<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
have are sealed. This variant is especially suitable<br>
for two-part capsules.<br>
The preferred capsule according to the invention is a<br>
two-part capsule. Such capsules preferably comprise two<br>
parts that telescope together, a capsule body (body)<br>
and a capsule cap (cap), which can be joined together<br>
so that a stable, enclosed cavity of a defined volume<br>
is formed, which contains the pharmaceutical<br>
preparation. The size of the capsule is such that it<br>
can be used e.g. in commonly available powder inhalers<br>
fitted with capsules.<br>
In an especially preferred embodiment the cap and the<br>
body of the capsule are of cylindrical shape with a<br>
circular cross-section and closed convex ends of almost<br>
hemispherical shape.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the capsule comprises a<br>
dehydrating plastic with a Shore hardness D from 60 to<br>
80, preferably from 65 to 73.<br>
Preferably said capsule is sufficiently stable to<br>
withstand a force of up to 10 N, more preferably up to<br>
15 N along the longitudinal axis or the transverse<br>
axis. The advantage is that the capsule is more able to<br>
resist the stresses acting on the capsule during<br>
production, filling, packing, transportation etc.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the cap and body of the<br>
capsule are of mutually similar, cylindrical shape,<br>
comprising a self-contained shell with in each case a<br>
closed and an open end. The cap and the capsule are of<br>
a shape and size such that the open end of the body can<br>
be inserted telescopically into the open end of the<br>
cap, so that the cap is joined firmly to the body.<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
In a special embodiment the cap and body are provided<br>
with closing devices, which are of advantage in<br>
temporary and/or final closure of the capsule.<br>
In such an embodiment, there are raised dots on the<br>
inside surface of the cap and there are slightly larger<br>
dot-shaped depressions in the outside surface of the<br>
body, which are arranged so that during closure of the<br>
capsule the raised dots lock into the depressions.<br>
Alternatively, the raised dots can be formed on the<br>
outside surface of the body and the depressions on the<br>
inside surface of the cap. Arrangements are preferred<br>
in which the raised dots or the depressions are in each<br>
case arranged in a circle or spiral around the shell.<br>
Instead of raised dots and dot-shaped depressions, they<br>
can also form a continuous ring round the shell of the<br>
cap and of the body.<br>
In one embodiment, one or more continuous circular<br>
projections are formed on the inside surface of the cap<br>
and on the outside surface of the body, so that when<br>
the capsule is in the closed state a projection of the<br>
cap is in each case next to a projection of the body.<br>
In the embodiments with said circular depressions<br>
and/or projections these can be continuous or<br>
intermittent.<br>
In another embodiment, projections are formed on the<br>
outside of the body near the open end and holes are<br>
formed in the cap near the open end, so that in the<br>
closed state of the capsule the projections of the body<br>
lock into the holes in the cap. The projections can in<br>
this case be of a form such that the cap can be opened<br>
at any time without damaging the capsule, or<br>
alternatively such that the capsule, once closed, can<br>
no longer be opened nondestructively.<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
In another embodiment, a bead is formed on the outside<br>
of the body, going round the body perpendicularly to<br>
the connecting axis between cap and body. The bead<br>
serves as a stop for the cap, when the latter is fitted<br>
over the body, to prevent the body being pushed through<br>
the cap. The region between the open end of the body<br>
and the bead corresponds to the region of the body over<br>
which the cap can be fitted. The bead is located on the<br>
body in such a way that the cap can be pushed far<br>
enough over the body to produce a firm closure between<br>
cap and body. This means that the bead is not<br>
positioned for example directly at the open end of the<br>
body. The side of the bead directed toward the open end<br>
of the body stands as a vertical edge on the outer wall<br>
of the body, so that the cap cannot be pushed beyond<br>
the bead during closure. The side of the bead directed<br>
toward the closed end of the body can be in the form of<br>
an almost right-angled edge or it can flatten out<br>
toward the closed end of the body. The design with an<br>
almost right-angled edge can be of advantage in the<br>
case of loose fitting of the cap in a cap holder, and<br>
the variant with a bead that flattens out can be of<br>
advantage in the case of a firm fit. The bead can be<br>
continuous or intermittent.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the bead flattens out<br>
continuously toward the closed end of the body and its<br>
side directed toward the open end of the body stands<br>
perpendicularly on the capsule body. The height of the<br>
edge thus formed is then such that the edge does not<br>
project beyond the capsule cap when the capsule is in<br>
the closed state, so that there is a flat transition<br>
from capsule cap to capsule body.<br>
The thickness of the walls of the cap and of the body<br>
can vary in different regions. Thus, as a rule the wall<br>
thickness is greater in the rounded zones of the cap or<br>
of the body or at the point of the body where the bead<br>
is formed, than in the zones where the walls are<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
straight. In one embodiment the walls of the cap and of<br>
the body have a thickness from 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm.<br>
In another embodiment, pimples are formed on the<br>
outside of the capsule, and in another there are three<br>
or more ribs, running parallel to the longitudinal axis<br>
of the capsule. The advantage of these arrangements is<br>
that the capsule can be removed from a capsule holder,<br>
as used for example in the powder inhalers mentioned<br>
above, without being damaged or opened. The ribs or<br>
pimples can cover the entire outside of the capsule or<br>
just a portion thereof. Alternatively they can be<br>
formed only on the cap or only in the region of the<br>
body that is visible from outside when the capsule is<br>
in the closed state. The ribs run parallel to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the capsule and lock the capsule<br>
vertically in said capsule holder. In the case of a<br>
circular cross-section of the capsule, the ribs are<br>
preferably arranged so that the cross-section of the<br>
capsule does not have rotational symmetry about the<br>
central axis. In such an embodiment, the ribs can be<br>
formed only in the region of the body that is visible<br>
with the capsule in the closed state. Such an<br>
embodiment prevents jamming of the capsule in a capsule<br>
holder.<br>
In one embodiment without a bead, but with ribs on the<br>
portion of the body that is visible in the closed state<br>
of the cap, the ribs are formed so that the ends of the<br>
ribs directed toward the open end of the body perform<br>
the function of the bead, namely to serve as a stop for<br>
the cap when fitting the cap and body together.<br>
In another embodiment the shells of the cap and of the<br>
body describe a hollow cylinder of circular, oval,<br>
triangular, tetragonal, hexagonal, octagonal or<br>
polygonal cross-section, in each case with the top open<br>
and the bottom closed. The closed bottom can be flat or<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
convex. The angular embodiments have, for example, the<br>
advantage that they save space in storage.<br>
In one embodiment the elongation of the capsule<br>
(distance from the closed end of the body to the closed<br>
end of the cap in relation to the diameter with the<br>
capsule closed) is greater than 1, in another<br>
embodiment the elongation is equal to 1 and in yet<br>
another embodiment the elongation is less than 1. The<br>
latter has the advantage that the body has a larger<br>
opening for filling. In one of the embodiments with an<br>
elongation equal to 1 the cap and body are of a form<br>
such that the closed capsule is of spherical shape,<br>
which can be advantageous for automatic loading of an<br>
inhaler with the capsule from a reservoir.<br>
In order to achieve a better seal between cap and body<br>
with the filled capsule in the closed state, the join<br>
between cap and body can be sealed by welding, gluing<br>
or banding, so that permeability to water vapor<br>
decreases considerably. Welding of cap and body is<br>
preferred. Alternatively the entire cap can be coated<br>
with a continuous protective film. The latter can be<br>
made of the material that is preferred according to the<br>
invention. In this case the capsule itself can be made<br>
of a material that does not contain an adsorbent.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the gap can be sealed<br>
with a filler. Suitable fillers for said filling of the<br>
gap are pharmaceutically permitted filler materials,<br>
for example Eudragit, a class of polymer based on<br>
methacrylic acid and methacrylates. Said filler can be<br>
introduced into the gap as a solution or suspension in<br>
a suitable, preferably highly volatile, solvent.<br>
Such capsules are suitable containers of the type<br>
according to the invention for inhalers, for example<br>
those known by the tradenarnes HandiHaler®, Spinhaler®,<br>
Rotahaler®, Aerolizer®, Flowcaps®, Turbospin®, AIR DPI®,<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
Orbital® and/or are described in DE 33 45 722, EP 0 591<br>
136, DE 43 18 455, WO 91/02558, FR-A-2 146 202, US-A-4<br>
069 819, EP 666085, US3991761, W099/45987.<br>
A preferred invention relates to an assembly of an<br>
inhaler for the inhalation of pulverulent medicinal<br>
products and the capsule according to the invention, in<br>
particular a two-part capsule of cylindrical shape with<br>
rounded ends, the inhaler being characterized by a) an<br>
upward-opening, cup-shaped bottom part, which has two<br>
opposite windows in its shell and has a first hinge<br>
element at the edge of the opening, b) a plate, which<br>
covers the opening of the bottom part and has a second<br>
hinge element, c) an inhalation chamber for receiving<br>
the capsule, which is formed perpendicularly to the<br>
plane of the plate on the side of the plate directed<br>
toward the bottom part and on which a head is provided,<br>
which is movable against a spring, the head being<br>
provided with two ground needles, d) a top part with a<br>
mouthpiece and a third hinge element, and e) a lid,<br>
which has a fourth hinge element, the hinge elements of<br>
the bottom part, of the plate, of the top part and of<br>
the lid being joined together.<br>
Preferably it is an inhaler of the HandiHaler® type.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a<br>
secondary packaging, containing at least one capsule as<br>
described here, the secondary packaging preferably<br>
being moistureproof and more preferably having, at<br>
least partially, aluminum foil (e.g. a blister).<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to<br>
the drying of small amounts of inhalable pharmaceutical<br>
formulations. Thus, it has been found that the capsules<br>
according to the invention not only are able to prevent<br>
or delay the entry of moisture into the capsules, so<br>
that the capsules provide a method by which inhalable<br>
pharmaceutical formulations can be kept dry, but also<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
that with the capsules according to the invention,<br>
inhalable pharmaceutical formulations can be dried to<br>
low residual moisture. Pharmaceutical formulations in<br>
an amount of up to 50 mg, preferably up to 30 mg,<br>
especially preferably up to 15 and quite especially<br>
preferably up to 10 mg, are especially suitable. The<br>
moisture level can represent e.g. up to 5 wt. % of the<br>
formulation. The figures given relate to capsules of<br>
size 3. These and other suitable capsule sizes are<br>
described in more detail in the examples.<br>
Finally, another aspect of the present invention<br>
relates to the use of a polymer composition as<br>
described herein (with at least one adsorbent) for the<br>
production of a capsule as described herein.<br>
Examples<br>
Capsules of size 3 were produced as follows:<br>
The adsorbent-polymer composition contained 67 wt. %<br>
high-density polyethylene (HDPE), 3 wt. % EVA<br>
(elastomer) and 30 wt.% of a synthetic zeolite<br>
(molecular sieve 4A, max. particle size 20 urn). First a<br>
premix of HDPE and EVA was prepared manually. This was<br>
blended with the synthetic zeolite in a twin-screw<br>
extruder. The compound was converted to granules.<br>
Unless the granules are to undergo further processing<br>
immediately, they can be sealed for storage in welded<br>
aluminum bags, to exclude moisture. The granules were<br>
processed by injection molding to capsules of size 3,<br>
setting MFI (melt flow index) of about 18 and using a<br>
0.6 mm injection channel. According to a second variant<br>
the adsorbent polymer composition contained 66 wt.%<br>
high-density polyethylene (HDPE), 3 wt.% EVA<br>
(elastomer), 30 wt.% of a synthetic zeolite (molecular<br>
sieve 4A, max. particle size 20 urn) and additionally<br>
1 wt.% of a synthetic polyacrylate superabsorber fiber.<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
The capsules obtained were filled with 5.5 mg of a<br>
water-sensitive formulation and then the top and bottom<br>
parts of the capsule were welded together.<br>
The capsules thus produced were stored open, i.e.<br>
without additional secondary packaging, at a<br>
temperature of 40°C and at 75% relative humidity.<br>
After various times, the inhalable fraction of the<br>
particles (proportion by weight of particles with an<br>
aerodynamic size of less than 5 μm) was measured on<br>
discharge with a powder inhaler. The powder inhaler<br>
used was a device of the HandiHaler® type (WO94/28958) ,<br>
and the inhalable fraction was measured by means of a<br>
cascade impactor at a flow rate of 39 1/min.<br>
As a result it was found that the in-use stability of<br>
the formulation in capsules comprising conventional<br>
material without addition of molecular sieve could be<br>
prolonged from 1 day by at least 9 days. The "in-use<br>
stability" is to be understood to mean the period<br>
between removal of the capsule from the packaging (e.g.<br>
the blister) and use of the capsule in the inhalation<br>
maneuver. During this period the capsule must display<br>
adequate stability, in order to protect the active<br>
substance that it contains e.g. against moisture. This<br>
is particularly important in the case of multidose<br>
inhalers.<br>
The capsules according to the invention are preferably<br>
of the following size:<br>
a)	Length of capsule bodies: 22.2	±0.46 mm;	20.22<br>
±0.46 mm; 20.98 ±0.46 mm.; 18.4	±0.46 mm;	16.61<br>

6.2 ±0.46 mm.<br>
c)	Outside diameter of capsule bodies: 9.55 mm;<br>
8.18 mm; 7.36 mm; 7.34 mm; 6.63 mm; 6.07 mm; 5.57 mm;<br>
5.05 mm; 4.68 mm.<br>
d)	Outside diameter of capsule caps: 9.91 mm; 8.53 mm;<br>
7.66 mm; 7.64 mm; 6.91 mm; 6.35 mm; 5.83 mm; 5.32 mm;<br>
4.91 mm.<br>
e)	Total length of the closed capsule: 26.1 +0.3 mm;<br>
23.3 +0.3 mm; 24.2 ±0.3 mm; 21.7 ±0.3 mm; 19.4 ±0.3 mm;<br>
18.0 ±0.3 mm; 15.9 ±0.3 mm; 14.3 ±0.3 mm; 11.1 ±0.3 mm.<br>
f)	Capsule volumes: 1.37 ml; 0.95 ml; 0.7 8 ml; 0.50 ml;<br>
0.37 ml; 0.30 ml; 0.21 ml; 0.13 ml.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below on<br>
the basis of drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the simplest embodiment of the capsule<br>
according to the invention 1 in cross-section. The<br>
capsule 1 comprises the cap 2 and the body 3, which are<br>
inserted telescopically in one another. Cap 2, and body<br>
3 are of the same shape and they each have a convex<br>
bottom 4.<br>
Fig. 2a shows, in cross-section, an embodiment in which<br>
a bead 5 is formed on the body 3 of capsule 1, said<br>
bead tapering toward the closed end of the body. The<br>
side of bead 15 directed toward the open end of the body<br>
is almost perpendicular on the body. The edge thus<br>
formed limits the region of the body over which cap 2<br>
can be pushed telescopically.<br>
Another embodiment is depicted in Fig. 2b. The cross-<br>
section shows that this embodiment differs from that<br>
shown in Fig. 2a in that the wall thickness of cap 2 or<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
of body 3 is not of identical thickness over the entire<br>
region, but varies over individual partial regions. In<br>
addition, the convex bottoms 4 of the cap and of the<br>
body each have a concave indentation at the vertex.<br>
Figs. 2c and 2d show capsule caps with projections on<br>
the inside surface 6. Fig. 2e shows a further<br>
embodiment of the capsule body, which differs from that<br>
shown in Figs. 1, 2a and 2b with respect to the wall<br>
thickness.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an embodiment in which bead 5 is almost at<br>
right angles on the body both at the top and at the<br>
bottom of the body.<br>
The embodiment in Fig. 4 represents a further<br>
development of the embodiment in Fig. 2a, in which a<br>
circular depression or projection 6 or 7 is formed in<br>
cap 2 or body 3 for better closure of capsule 1.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a front view of the embodiment shown in<br>
cross-section in Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 6 shows another variant of the invention with dot-<br>
shaped depressions 8 and 9 in front view.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a variant of capsule 1, with projections<br>
10 formed on body 3 near the open end, and holes 11<br>
formed in cap 2 near the open end, so that during<br>
closure of the capsule the projections 10 lock into the<br>
holes 11.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an external view of an embodiment of<br>
capsule 1, in which ribs 12 are formed on body 3.<br>
The capsules as shown in the drawings can be made, in<br>
one embodiment, from the material according to the<br>
invention, in particular from polyethylene with<br>
dehydrating agent. In another embodiment the capsule is<br>
made from a polymer and this material is then sprayed<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
over it. In another embodiment the capsule is then<br>
banded or laminated with metal foil, e.g. aluminum<br>
foil.<br><br>
