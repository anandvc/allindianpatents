				<td>ROUTING OF MEDIA COMMUNICATION SERVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to telecommunication and more particularly<br>
to routing of communication messages in multimedia communication.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] As the telecommunication systems have evolved, services utilizing<br>
multimedia transmission have gained more and more ground. IP multimedia<br>
core network subsystem of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has<br>
been designed to enable operators a standardized way to offer their subscribers<br>
multimedia services based on and built upon Internet applications, services<br>
and protocols. Smooth integration of existing services and stand-alone network<br>
elements for the standardized IP multimedia core network subsystem thus<br>
seems to present an inevitable task for most operators.<br>
[0003] For example, Push-to-talk over Cellular (PoC) service can be provided<br>
as a packet-based user or application level service in a digital communication<br>
system. In PoC, the underlying communications system provides the<br>
basic connections (i.e. IP connections) between the communications applications<br>
in the user terminals and the communication service. The PoC communication<br>
service can be provided by a communication server system while the<br>
client applications reside in the user equipment or user terminals.<br>
[0004] Owing to the significant interest for the PoC services, individual vendors<br>
have already provided early adaptations of the technology, primarily in<br>
form of stand-alone PoC systems. Quite recently a group of interested organi3<br>
zations have prepared an industry specification for PoC, with the aim to follow<br>
existing 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystem<br>
(IMS) specifications. The standardization work in this direction has since then<br>
continued in Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) using this industry specification as a<br>
starting point.<br>
[0005] However, integration of the stand-alone PoC systems to IMS systems<br>
has presented some unexpected problems. When a PoC operator wishes to<br>
integrate his stand-alone PoC system in the IMS, it would seem obvious to<br>
create an IMS subscription for all identities and subscribers of the existing PoC<br>
system, but this is, however, not the case. For example, all existing PoC users<br>
would then be obliged to upgrade their current PoC terminals into IMS capable<br>
PoC terminals and to configure the new terminals. At the time of integration the<br>
installed base of the existing system is likely to be considerable, and such extensive<br>
operations could meet a lot of resistance and cause a considerable<br>
amount of administrative work.<br>
[0006] Furthermore, it is not likely that all PoC subscribers immediately wish<br>
to become IMS subscribers. Some subscribers may be ready for direct IMS<br>
migration, but some subscribers may also wish to time the migration to a later<br>
date and to control the timing themselves. Users who do not wish to become<br>
IMS subscribers are not willing to be charged for any IMS traffic, either. However,<br>
the implementation of two kinds of IMS traffic, chargeable and nonchargeable,<br>
is not easily managed.<br>
 [0007] Conventionally subscribers are categorized according to type by arranging<br>
the users' identity information into appropriate ranges. This may be<br>
implemented, for example, by configuring identities of the system so that the<br>
type of each user is easily deducible from the identity information, or by mapping<br>
the identities according to type to some other pre-categorized identity information.<br>
However, when the status of the categorizing type is not static but<br>
changes dynamically, these conventional means easily lead to complicated<br>
and conflicting definitions and implementations.<br>
[0008] For example, users of the existing PoC system that do not migrate at<br>
integration may be initially arranged to a specific addressable identity range.<br>
When they begin to show an interest in IMS services and wish to become IMS<br>
subscribers, they somehow need to be excluded from the address range. In<br>
order to manage this, the identity ranges would need to be divided which<br>
would make the management of the subscriber information very complicated.<br>
Such complexity would also affect to the critical activities based on identity information,<br>
especially the routing where the next hop is typically defined based<br>
on the identity information in the transmitted message.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] An object of the present invention is to provide a solution to prevent<br>
or eliminate problems of routing in communication systems that allow using at<br>
least two types of identities, typically including an individual identity and a<br>
ranged identity, and where the identity itself does not indicate its type. When<br>
such an identity is used for routing, interpretation of the type of identity may not<br>
be appropriate for the current purpose, and routing may actually fail or succeed<br>
depending on the ongoing activity. The objects of the invention are<br>
achieved by a method and a network element, which are characterized by<br>
what is stated in the independent claims. The preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.<br>
[0010] The invention is based on the idea of allowing the co-existence of<br>
different types of identities and ensuring the consistency when using the identities<br>
by controllably prioritizing the routing information related to one of the<br>
identity types over the routing information related to the other identity types.<br>
The identities are advantageously publicly available for users of the communication<br>
system for requesting actions related to an entity associated with the<br>
identity.<br>
[0011] An advantage of the method and arrangement of the invention is<br>
that it improves the correct routing in a system where different identity types<br>
are available.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0019] The invention is applicable to be used in any communication system<br>
capable of providing media communication service that can be integrated to a<br>
client server environment, for example a 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem, a<br>
3GPP2 Multimedia Domain (MMD) or a SIP service environment. Such systems<br>
comprise mobile communication systems as well as fixed telecommunication<br>
systems. In the following the present invention is described by means of<br>
a Push-to-talk over Cellular (PoC) media communication service in a third<br>
generation mobile communication system, without limiting the invention to this<br>
specific service or the terms used in description of the embodiment. The term<br>
service herein refers to intangible products consisting of activities between the<br>
service provider and the customer to meet the needs of the customer, covering<br>
both basic services as well as any supplementary services modifying or supplementing<br>
the underlying basic services.<br>
[0020] As illustrated in Fig 1, in the third generation (3G) mobile communications<br>
systems, a public land mobile network (PLMN) infrastructure may be<br>
logically divided into a core network (CN) 9,10,11,12 and access network (AN)<br>
infrastructures 5,6,7,8. The access network AN may be called a base station<br>
subsystem (BSS) 8 for the GSM and radio network subsystem (RNS) or radio<br>
access network (RAN) 5,6,7 for the UMTS. In the technical specifications of a<br>
third generation partnership project (3GPP), the core network CN is logically<br>
divided into a circuit-switched (CS) domain 9, a packet-switched (PS) domain<br>
10,11 and an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) 12. The CS domain refers to a<br>
set of all the CN entities offering "CS type of connection" for user traffic as well<br>
as all the entities supporting the related signalling. A "CS type of connection" is<br>
a connection for which dedicated network resources are allocated when a connection<br>
is established and released when the connection is released. A "PS<br>
type of connection" transfers the user information using packets so that each<br>
packet can be routed independently from the previous one. An example of the<br>
PS domain may be the GPRS .(General Packet Radio Service), and the typical<br>
entities may include a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) and a gateway<br>
GPRS support node (GGSN). The IP multimedia subsystem comprises CN<br>
elements for provision of multimedia services. The IP multimedia subsystem<br>
IMS utilizes the PS domain to transport multimedia signalling and bearer traffic.<br>
 [0021] The Push-to-talk over Cellular (PoC) is an overlay speech service in<br>
a mobile cellular network. In PoC a connection between two or more parties is<br>
established typically for a long period but the actual radio channels in the air<br>
interface are activated only when somebody is talking. This corresponds to the<br>
usage of the conventional radiotelephones where the radio frequency used is<br>
agreed upon between the parties (e.g. military/police radios, LA radios) or<br>
permanently set (walkie-talkie type of radios) and whenever somebody wishes<br>
to talk she/he presses the tangent, which activates the radio transmission on<br>
the selected channel. The traditional radiotelephone services are simplex by<br>
nature, meaning that only one party (the one who is pressing the tangent) can<br>
talk at a time.<br>
[0022] More specifically, in voice communication with "push-to-talk, release-<br>
to-listen" feature, a call is based on the use of a pressel (push-to-talk<br>
switch) as a switch in a telephone: by pressing a pressel the user indicates his<br>
desire to speak, and the user equipment sends a service request to the network.<br>
Alternatively, a voice activity detector (VAD) or any suitable means can<br>
be used instead of the manual switch. The network either rejects the request<br>
or allocates the requested resources on the basis of predetermined criteria,<br>
such as the availability of resources, the priority of the requesting user, etc. At<br>
the same time, a connection is also established to a receiving user, or users<br>
when group communication is concerned. After the voice connection has been<br>
established, the requesting user may talk and the other users may listen.<br>
When the user releases the pressel or traffic inactivity occurs, such an event is<br>
detected in the network, and the resources may be released and/or the talk<br>
item may be granted to another user.<br>
[0023] In Fig. 1, as an example, a Push-to-talk Over Cellular (PoC) server<br>
system is illustrated as provided on top of the Packet Switched (PS) core network<br>
10,11,12 in order to provide packet mode (e.g. IP) communication services<br>
to the User Equipment (UE) 1,2,3,4. A UE accessing the PS CN, and the<br>
PS core network itself, utilizes the services provided by the Radio network<br>
subsystem (RNS) or Radio access network (RAN) 5,6,7,8 to provide packetmode<br>
communication between the UE and the PS CN subsystem. The multiple<br>
access method employed in the air interface in the RAN may be Time Division<br>
Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Code<br>
Division Multiple Access (CDMA), or any other method or a combination<br>
thereof. In the 3rd and higher generation mobile communications system the<br>
access method is primarily based on the CDMA. Further, because the traffic<br>
channels may have a wide bandwidth, corresponding to user data rates e.g. up<br>
to 2 Mbits/s, such access may also be referred as a Wideband CDMA<br>
(WCDMA).<br>
[0024] Conceptually, a packet based media communication system is provided<br>
on top of the mobile network in order to provide media communication<br>
services to the user equipment UE through the communication system. The<br>
media communication system may be embodied as a server system, and it is<br>
generally referred to as a media communication server. A communication system<br>
may comprise a plurality of media communication servers 14,15.<br>
 [0025] In this embodiment the media communication servers are referred to<br>
as PoC servers, and they illustrate the combination of PoC functions that are<br>
necessary to provide the PoC service. PoC functions may be implemented in<br>
one or more separate PoC server(s) or as integrated into one or more network<br>
entities. A PoC Server is a media communication server that may be an endpoint<br>
of SIP signaling, as well as real time transport protocol (such as Realtime<br>
Transport Protocol (RTP)), and real time transport control protocol (such<br>
as Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)) signaling. The PoC Server<br>
may provide SIP session handling, policy control for access to groups, group<br>
session handling, access control, do-not-disturb (i.e. incoming session barring)<br>
functionality, floor control functionality, talker identification, participants information,<br>
quality feedback, charging reports and media distribution. A general<br>
PoC system architecture also specifies a Group and List Management Server<br>
(GLMS) which may be used in the PoC to manage groups, contact lists and<br>
access lists of the PoC users. For a person skilled in the art it is clear that the<br>
term PoC server may be interpreted to refer to a single PoC server or to a PoC<br>
system comprising a combination of a PoC server and other entities of the PoC<br>
system architecture.<br>
[0026] The block diagram of Figure 2 shows the network elements related<br>
to the currently described embodiment of the present invention. More specifically,<br>
Figure 2 shows an embodiment where two former stand-alone PoC servers<br>
PoCA 21 and PoCs 22 have been interconnected through IM subsystems<br>
IMSA 23 and IMSB 24, in order to allow the PoC communication between user<br>
equipment UEA 25 and UEe 26 to take place. PoC servers that are not inte<br>
grated with the IMS are in this context referred to as stand-alone PoC servers.<br>
For clarity, it should be noted that only essential elements for illustrating this<br>
particular embodiment of the present invention are shown in this description.<br>
For a person skilled in the art it is clear that complete communication systems<br>
comprise a plurality of elements that are not explicitly shown herein. Furthermore,<br>
in Figure 2 both PoC servers are integrated into separate IMS systems,<br>
but it is equally possible to implement the invention in configurations where the<br>
IMS is used in the originating or in the terminating end only, or where one IMS<br>
system interconnects two separate PoC servers (i.e. IMSA 23 and IMSB are the<br>
same).<br>
[0027] The IP Multimedia Core Network subsystem (IM CN subsystem),<br>
also called as IP Multimedia subsystem (IMS), comprises all core network<br>
elements for provision of multimedia services. The session flow procedures of<br>
an IMS session are controlled by a call session control function (CSCF), which<br>
is divided into several different roles. A Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is substantially<br>
the first contact point within the IMS|. The P-CSCF behaves like a proxy and<br>
thus accepts requests and services them internally or forwards them. An interrogating-<br>
CSCF (I-CSCF) is the contact point within an operator's network for<br>
all connections destined to a user of that network operator. A Serving-CSCF<br>
(S-CSCF) performs the session control services for the user equipment. It<br>
maintains a session state as required by the network operator for supporting<br>
the services. The S-CSCF usually contains a subscriber database to which<br>
required subscription data is downloaded when the user terminal registers to<br>
the S-CSCF. The operation of these call session control functions in this embodiment<br>
will be discussed below in more detail.<br>
[0028] The present embodiment illustrates a case where routing information<br>
related to the public user identity is prioritized. In the following, the embodiment<br>
is illustrated with a routing scenario where a user equipment LJEA25<br>
sends a request addressed to a PoC identity associated with the user equipment<br>
UEe 26. The IMS session is formed by (flows of mobile originating information,<br>
information between the serving call session control functions, and<br>
mobile terminating information. The block diagram of Figure 2 describes the<br>
elements for implementing the information flows in the embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In the originating side, L)EA 25 first sends a request to a PoC<br>
server PoCA 21 of his home network. According to the embodiment of the invention,<br>
PoC subscribers are not directly IMS subscribers, but initially continue<br>
operating with their PoC user identity. On the other hand, routing between the<br>
PoC servers is managed based on IMS Public Service Identities.<br>
[0029] An IP Multi-Media Subsystem is an example of a system that comprises<br>
a variety of identities that may be associated with IP multimedia services.<br>
Firstly, every IP Multi-Media Subsystem may have one or more private<br>
user identities. The private identity is assigned by the home network operator<br>
and may be used, for example, for registration, authorisation, administration,<br>
and accounting purposes. The IP Multi-Media Subsystem may also have one<br>
or more public user identities. The public user identity/identities may be used<br>
by any use, as the IMS is capable of routing IMS messages using a public ser13<br>
vice identity (PSI). The PSI differs from the public user identity in that it identifies<br>
a service that is hosted by an application server. Each PSI is hosted by an<br>
application server that executes the service specific logic identified by the PSI.<br>
[0030] An application server hosting the PSI may be invoked as an originating<br>
application server by modifying the filter information within the subscriber<br>
information of the users that intend to use the service identified by the<br>
PSI. The SIP requests are directed to the corresponding application server<br>
according to the originating filtering rules in the S-CSCF of the user who is using<br>
the service. Such statically pre-configured PSIs are available internally<br>
within the IMS of the operator's domain.<br>
[0031] In Figure 2 this is illustrated by means of routing information stored<br>
in Home Subscriber Servers HSSA 232 and HSSB 242 of the IMSA 23 and<br>
IMSs 24. Generally, a Home Subscriber Server is a master database, which is<br>
used for keeping a list of features and services associated with a user, and for<br>
tracking the location and means of access for its users. The HSS provides the<br>
functions of a conventional home location register, but differs from the conventional<br>
home location register in that it also communicates via IP-based interfaces<br>
and provides the functions of the user mobility server. As shown, HSSA<br>
232 comprises routing information associated with public user identities, as<br>
well as public service identities of IMSA 23. For example, a wildcarded public<br>
service identity range PSI1A (user*poc@operA) has a routing address<br>
poc.operA because the range is hosted in the PoC server PoCA. In addition<br>
e.g. the address of the S-CSCF 234 (scscf4.operA) may be assigned to the<br>
wildcarded public service identity range PSI1A to be used in originating routing<br>
from the integrated PoC server PoCA to IMSA 23. Correspondingly HSSB 242<br>
comprises routing information associated with public user identities and public<br>
service identities of IMSB24. For example the wildcarded public service identity<br>
range PSI1B (user*poc@operB) has the routing address poc.operB because<br>
the range is hosted in the PoC server PoCe.<br>
[0032] The request from the user equipment UEA 25 is delivered to the<br>
PoCA 21, whose address in this example is poc.operA. In the integrated environment<br>
the PoCA 21 acts as an application server (AS) and routes the request<br>
according to the originating PSI routing. Routing from the originating AS hosting<br>
the PSI can be performed in two ways.<br>
a) The AS may forward the originating request to the destination network<br>
without involving a S-CSCF.<br>
b) In case the PSI has a S-CSCF assigned, the AS may forward the originating<br>
request to this S-CSCF, which then processes the request as per<br>
regular originating S-CSCF procedures.<br>
[0033] In Figure 2 option b) is illustrated. The address of the S-CSCF may<br>
be configured in the PoCA 21 or it may be retrieved from the home subscriber<br>
server HSSA 232 of the IM subsystems IMSA 23, or some other database storage,<br>
table, list, file or the like available to the PoCA 21. In this example the<br>
scscf4.operA i.e. the S-CSCF 234 is assigned in the HSSA 232 to the public<br>
service identity PSI1A.<br>
[0034] The Serving-CSCF 234 handling the session origination performs<br>
an analysis of the destination address, and determines that it belongs to a<br>
subscriber of a different operator. The request is therefore forwarded to an entry<br>
point in the destination operator's network, the I-CSCF 244.<br>
[0035] Generally in the IMS, an application server hosting the PSI may also<br>
be invoked as a terminating application server with the PSI. The related PSIs<br>
are configured in the home network, are globally routable and can be made<br>
available to users within and outside the operator domain.<br>
[0036] A PSI can take the form of a distinct PSI (e.g.<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2b465274584e595d42484e6b4e534a465b474e05484446">[email&#160;protected]</a>), or of a wildcarded PSI (e.g. chatlist_<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="dde9e99db8a5bcb0adb1b8f3beb2b0">[email&#160;protected]</a> belonging to the wildcarded PSI range chatlist_*@<br>
example.com). A range of PSIs with the same domain part in the SIP<br>
URI may be defined using a wildcard indication in the user part of the SIP-URI.<br>
There are at least two ways to route towards the AS hosting the PSI:<br>
a) The HSS maintains the assigned S-CSCF information and ISC Filter Criteria<br>
to route to the AS hosting the PSI according to IMS routing principles.<br>
In this case, the I-CSCF receives SIP requests at the terminating<br>
side, queries the HSS and directs the request to the S-CSCF assigned to<br>
the PSI. The S-CSCF forwards the session to the application server hosting<br>
the PSI according to the terminating ISC Filter Criteria.<br>
b) The HSS maintains the address information of the AS hosting the PSI. In<br>
this case, the AS address information for the PSI is returned to the ICSCF<br>
in the location query response or the like, in which case the ICSCF<br>
will forward the request directly to the AS hosting the PSI.<br>
[0037] In the embodiment of Figure 2 option b) is illustrated. The I-CSCF<br>
244 of operator B sends a query to the home subscriber server HSSe 242 of<br>
the IM subsystem IMSB 24 to ask for a forwarding address for the request addressed<br>
to a PoC user identity user2poc@operB associated with the UEB 26.<br>
The HSSB 242 returns the AS address poc.operB assigned to the matching<br>
wildcarded public service identity range PSHe (user*poc@operB), and the ICSCF<br>
244 using the returned AS address (poc.operB) routes the request to<br>
the PoC server PoCe 22 that then delivers the request to the user equipment<br>
 [0038] Figure 3 illustrates the signaling flow information transfer related to<br>
the elements and data transfer described in the example of Figure 2. In step 3-<br>
1 the PoC user user1poc@operA sends a request to his home PoC server<br>
poc.operA. In step 3-2 the PoC server determines a S-CSCF assigned to itself<br>
in the configuration, or assigned to the wildcarded PSI userlpoc@operA in the<br>
HSSA 232. In this example a query is made to the HSSA 232 and a matching<br>
wildcarded PSI range is found, i.e. PSI1A that is user*poc@operA with<br>
scscf4.operA assigned as an S-CSCF. In step 3-3, the PoC server sends the<br>
request to the assigned S-CSCF scscf4.operA, which forwards the request to<br>
the entry point (e.g. I-CSCF) of the IMS network where the PoC server of the<br>
user user2poc@operB is located (step 3-4). In step 3-5, the I-CSCF makes a<br>
query to the home subscriber server of the receiving user, which server maps<br>
the identity user2poc@operB to a public service identity range<br>
user*poc@operB and retrieves the name/address information (poc.operB) of<br>
the AS that hosts the wildcarded public service identity range user*poc@operB<br>
(step 3-6). The home subscriber server of the receiving user returns the address<br>
poc.operB of the home PoC server of user2poc@operB (step 3-7), and<br>
the I-CSCF routes the message to poc.operB (step 3-8). In step 3-9, the PoC<br>
server of the operator B sends the request to user2poc@operB.<br>
 [0039] In the described embodiment, in the terminating routing from the<br>
PoC server to the user terminal and in the originating routing from the user terminal<br>
to the PoC server, identities of the integrated system identities or of the<br>
stand-alone PoC system can be applied. In the originating and terminating<br>
routing between the PoC servers, the IMS public service identity routing is applied.<br>
This means that routing in the integrated system can be managed without<br>
obliging the users to directly become IMS subscribers, which provides several<br>
advantages. From the terminal's point of view the existing PoC system<br>
looks the same and the users of the existing PoC system may continue to use<br>
their PoC terminals and no immediate need for changing or reconfiguring of<br>
PoC terminals is associated with the integration. Still, the routing in the network<br>
to network interface of the integrated system is harmonized according to the<br>
principles of the IMS. From the operator's point of view the arrangement allows<br>
utilization of the existing PoC server in the integrated environment and the installed<br>
base does not become obsolete when integrated. Furthermore, the operator<br>
may add new users to the integrated PoC server as the IMS users and<br>
avoid immediate investment to a new PoC server.<br>
[0040] However, a further problem is still related to the situation where former<br>
stand-alone subscribers wish to become subscribers of the IMS. In the<br>
solution described above the identities of the PoC users were grouped into one<br>
or more PSI ranges. In order to exclude a subscriber identity of a migrating<br>
subscriber from the PSI range the operator would need to divide the PSI range<br>
into separate parts. Repeating this for a number of subscribers would very<br>
quickly lead to the fragmentation of the PSI range into a plurality of PSI<br>
ranges.<br>
[0041] In a solution according to the present invention the PoC users may,<br>
however, primarily maintain their PoC subscription, be subscribed to the IMS at<br>
any moment and still avoid the division of the PSI range. This is managed by<br>
allowing the parallel existence of a wildcarded public service identity range and<br>
a public user identity belonging to that range, and consistently using the public<br>
user identity as a first search criteria. For example, a PoC user mailtoimav become<br>
a subscriber of the IMS using his PoC identity user7poc@operB as an<br>
IMS public user identity with normal public user identity routing, while the routing<br>
of the other PoC identities in the wildcarded PSI range user*poc@operB<br>
still refers to the originating/terminating PSI routing from/to the PoG server.<br>
The routing information associated with the public user identity<br>
user7poc@operB should be given precedence over the routing information<br>
associated with the public service identity user7poc@operB as a member of<br>
the wildcarded PSI range user*poc@operB. This is illustrated in Figures 4 and<br>
5 by means of elements and related information flows in an embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0042] The block diagram of Figure 4 shows the elements for implementing<br>
the currently described embodiment in a procedure for transmitting a request<br>
from a PoC user equipment UEA to a PoC user equipment UEe. Corresponding<br>
to Figure 2, Figure 4 shows two former stand-alone PoC servers PoCA 41 and<br>
42 interconnected though IM subsystems IMSA 43 and IMSe 44, in order<br>
to allow PoC communication between user equipment U£A 45 and UEs 46. In<br>
Figure 4 both PoC servers are again integrated into separate IMS systems,<br>
and furthermore, some of the PoC users have also become IMS subscribers.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the Home Subscriber Server HSSA 432 of operator A<br>
comprises routing information of the public user identity (userl poc@operA)<br>
associated with the user equipment U£A 45 and routing information of the<br>
wildcarded public service identity range (user*poc@operA) containing the public<br>
user identity as a member of the range. More specifically, the HSSA 432<br>
comprises the address of the S-CSCF (scscfB.operA) 436 associated with the<br>
public user identity (userl poc@operA) registered by the user equipment L)EA,<br>
and application server (AS) address (poc.operA) in the filter criteria associated<br>
with this public user identity. Additionally, the HSSA 432 comprises the address<br>
of another S-CSCF of the IMSA 43 assigned to the Public service identity<br>
range PSI1A user*poc@operA. Correspondingly the HSSB442 comprises the<br>
address of the S-CSCF (scscf9.operB) 447 associated with the public user<br>
identity (user7poc@operB) registered by the user equipment UEe 46, and application<br>
server (AS) address (poc.operB) in the filter criteria associated to this<br>
public user identity. Additionally, the HSSB 442 comprises the AS address<br>
(poc.operB) to the PoC server 42 of IMSe, assigned to the Public service identity<br>
range PSHe user*poc@operB.<br>
[0043] In the embodiment of Figure 4, a user L)EA 45 sends a request that<br>
is routed to the P-CSCF 434, the first contact point within the IM CN subsystem.<br>
The P-CSCF 434 remembers from the registration procedure the CSCF<br>
for this Public user identity and routes the request to the S-CSCF 436. Based<br>
on the filter criteria downloaded from the HSSA 432, the S-CSCF 436 routes<br>
the message to a PoCA41. Routing information for forwarding the request is<br>
available to the PoCA41 in some form of a database, storage, file, table or the<br>
like. Figure 4 shows the alternative of retrieving the routing information from<br>
the HSSA 432. According to the invention, routing information may first be<br>
searched from the HSSA 432 based on the public user identity associated to<br>
the user equipment L)EA 45. Therefore, in response to the query, the HSSA 432<br>
returns the address of the S-CSCF 436, and the PoCA41 routes the request to<br>
the S-CSCF 436.<br>
[0044] The S-CSCF 436 identifies that the request is addressed to an IMS<br>
of network B, and routes the request to an I-CSCF 446 of operator B's service<br>
area. In order to be able to route the information, the I-CSCF 446 makes a<br>
query to the HSSe of network B. According to the invention, routing information<br>
is now defined to be searched from the HSSe 442 first based on the public<br>
user identity of the receiving user equipment UEe 46. The definition may be<br>
made separately for one or more services, i.e. to be valid for the defined type<br>
of requests only. The definition may also be general, for example operatorrelated<br>
definition that is valid in the whole network.<br>
[0045] In response to the query, the HSSe 442 returns the address of a SCSCF<br>
447 (scscf9.operB) assigned to the public user identity registered by the<br>
user equipment UEe 46. Note that in case the user of the UEs would not be an<br>
IMS subscriber, and a public user identity would not be available, the HSSe<br>
would return the AS address poc.operB assigned to the wildcarded public ser21<br>
vice identity range PSI1B user*poc@operB. Now the I-CSCF 446, however,<br>
routes the request to the given S-CSCF 447 that evaluates the initial filter criteria<br>
of user7poc@operB and finds a match with AS address poc.operB pointing<br>
to the PoC server B. At receiving the request, the PoCB needs routing information<br>
to route the request to the receiving user UEB. Again, routing information<br>
for forwarding the request is available to the PoCB in some form of a database,<br>
storage, file, table or the like. Routing information may also be retrieved from<br>
the received request. Figure 4 shows an alternative for retrieving the routing<br>
information from the HSSB. Based on the public user identity associated with<br>
the user equipment UEB, the HSSe responds to the query by returning the SCSCF<br>
447 address scscf9.operB assigned to the public user identity. The<br>
PoCB routes the request to the given S-CSCF 447 address. From the registration<br>
procedure, the S-CSCF 447 knows the P-CSCF 448 for the UEB, and forwards<br>
the request to it. Correspondingly, the P-CSCF 448 knows the UEB address<br>
from the registration procedure, and forwards the request to user UEB.<br>
[0046] Figure 5 illustrates the corresponding signalling flow related to the<br>
elements and data transfer described in Figure 4. In step 5-1 the PoC user<br>
UEA sends to its first contact point, the P-CSCF of IMS, a request comprising<br>
its own public user identity userl poc@operA and the public user identity<br>
user7poc@operB of user UEB. In step 5-2, the P-CSCF forwards the request<br>
to the S-CSCF of UEA, that in step 5-3 forwards, based on the filter criteria of<br>
user UEA, the request to the PoC server poc.operA of the user U£A. In step 5-<br>
4, the PoC server poc.operA sends a query for the next routing address to the<br>
home subscriber server of the IMS of operator A. Alternatively the PoC server<br>
of user UEA may retrieve the S-CSCF address from the received request. According<br>
to the embodiment of the invention, routing information is first<br>
searched for (step 5-5) according the public user identity user1poc@operA. In<br>
step 5-6, the address scscfS.operA of the S-CSCF assigned to the public user<br>
identity user1poc@operA is returned to the PoC server of user U£A. The<br>
PoC server of user U£A forwards the message to the assigned S-CSCF (step<br>
5-7), which determines I-CSCF of the operator of the public user identity<br>
user7poc@operB. The S-CSCF sends the request to I-CSCF (step 5-8) of operator<br>
B. In step 5-9, the I-CSCF of operator B makes a query to the home<br>
subscriber server of operator B to obtain the next hop address. According to<br>
the embodiment of the invention, the home subscriber server determines (5-<br>
10) the routing information based on the public user identity user7poc@operB<br>
of the receiving user. The I-CSCF receives (step 5-11) the address<br>
scscf9.operB of S-CSCF assigned to the public user identity user7poc@operB<br>
of the receiving user and forwards the request (step 5-12) to it. The S-CSCF<br>
analyses/evaluates the filtering criteria associated with the public user identity<br>
user7poc@operB, and identifies the PoC server of the receiving user and forwards<br>
the request (step 5-13) to it. The PoC server of the receiving user queries<br>
(steps 5-14 and 5-15) from the home subscriber server of the receiving<br>
user the S-CSCF assigned to the public user identity user7poc@operB and<br>
delivers (step 5-16) the request to the given S-CSCF address. Alternatively the<br>
PoC server of the receiving user may retrieve the S-CSCF address from the<br>
received request. The S-CSCF determines P-CSCF of the public user identity<br>
user7poc@operB and forwards (step 5-17) the request to it. Finally, the P23<br>
CSCF forwards (step 5-18) the request to the user equipment UEe 46 of the<br>
receiving user.<br>
[0047] Consequently, the solution according to the invention allows consistent<br>
routing for an existing service at the time of integration to the IMS. At the<br>
same time it also provides users of the existing service an easy migration to<br>
the IMS without having to divide the identity ranges for excluding the migrated<br>
users.<br>
[0048] In the examples given above the precedence of the routing information<br>
of the public user identity was implemented by prioritization of the public<br>
user when searching for the routing data, i.e. in the home subscriber server of<br>
the sending or the receiving user. The functionality was first performed by for<br>
ing the routing information based on the public user identity in the request. If<br>
such information was not found, routing information was searched for based<br>
on the public service identity. For a person skilled in the art it is clear that this<br>
is only one alternative embodiment of the invention. As regards implementation<br>
during the search, the prioritization may be implemented as an operational<br>
functionality of the database management, as described above, or the information<br>
in the database may, for example, be structured in such a manner that the<br>
information related to the public user identities are always found first before<br>
any public service identities.<br>
[0049] Alternatively, the search may be implemented both for the public<br>
user identity and for the public service identity and either of the retrieved information<br>
may be prioritized after the search. The prioritization may be imple24<br>
mented in the database, whereby primarily the routing information of the public<br>
user identity is only provided to the querying function. Alternatively, routing information<br>
of both the public user identity and the public service identity may be<br>
forwarded to the querying function, who will then prioritize the routing information<br>
of the public user identity over the routing information of the public service<br>
identity.<br>
[0050] In terms of the network elements illustrated in Figure 2 and 4, the<br>
precedence may be implemented in any querying network entity, like in any of<br>
the call session control functions or in an application server (AS), by making<br>
sequential or parallel searches based on the separate identity types, and<br>
choosing the routing information related to the defined identity type. For example,<br>
any call state control function or the application server may submit two<br>
searches based on the public user identity and on the public service identity<br>
and prioritize the routing information received based on the public user identity.<br>
Alternatively, the precedence may be implemented in any queried network entity,<br>
like the home subscriber server, or any other database, file, storage, register<br>
or like. The queried network entity may make separate sequential or parallel<br>
searches with the identity received from the querying network entity, but<br>
return only routing information of the prioritized identity type. It is also possible<br>
to include in the query a request for routing information based on a special<br>
type of identity or based on two or more identity types.<br>
[0051] In the described embodiment routing is based on public user identities.<br>
It should be noted that the PoC facilitates also group communication, a<br>
multi-point communication service. In the IMS, groups are defined to be addressed<br>
using public service identities. One of the advantages of the present<br>
invention is that integration in the IMS does not cause changes to the addressing<br>
of the groups. Requests to and from a PoC group may be routed as a PSI<br>
routing or as Public user identity routing, for example depending on the operator's<br>
policy. Because group identities are not normally registered, they are not<br>
normal Public user identities even if the routing may be similar.<br>
[0052] In the above embodiments the public user identity was prioritized<br>
over the wildcarded public service identity range when processing the IMS requests.<br>
The prioritization order may, within the scope of protection, be defined<br>
according to the purpose, separately for one or more service applications or as<br>
a network-wide operator definition. There may be, for example, a need to use<br>
different types of user identities to collect requests primarily addressed to<br>
separate application servers to one general server. As an alternative example,<br>
let us consider a case where an operator provides a news service and maintains<br>
a general news server as 1.example. The operator also maintains separate<br>
servers for news concerning sports or politics: as4.example for political<br>
news and asT.example for sports news. The operator has defined a wildcarded<br>
PSI range news*@example, according to which requests are routed to<br>
as1.example, a distinct PSI news-politics@example, according to which requests<br>
are routed to as4.example, as well as a distinct PSI newssports@<br>
example, according to which requests are routed to as7.example. If<br>
the operator needs to route all news requests to the same general server, the<br>
operator may change the prioritization definition so that the identity in any re26<br>
ceived news request is first searched for as wildcarded PSI identity, instead of<br>
a distinct PSI.<br>
[0053] The implementation of the described mechanisms in a network element<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention is illustrated by<br>
referring to Figure 6. As an example, Figure 6 provides a functional description<br>
of a network element that may be used in the PoC for a call session control<br>
function (CSCF), as a PoC server, or a home subscriber server. By definition a<br>
server is a computer that serves other computers in the same or other networks<br>
by operating as the other computers request. The server of Figure 6<br>
comprises processing means 61, an element that comprises an arithmetic logic<br>
unit, a number of special registers and control circuits. Connected to the processing<br>
means are memory means 62, a data medium where computerreadable<br>
data or programs or user data can be stored. The memory means<br>
typically comprise memory units that allow both reading and writing (RAM),<br>
and a memory whose contents can only be read (ROM). The unit also comprises<br>
an interface block 63 with input means 64 for inputting data for internal<br>
processing in the unit, and output means 65 for outputting data from the internal<br>
processes of the unit. Examples of said input means comprise a plug-in<br>
unit acting as a gateway for information delivered to its external connection<br>
points. For receiving information on the operator, the server may also comprise<br>
a keypad, or a touch screen, a microphone, or the like. Examples of said output<br>
means include a plug-in unit feeding information to the lines connected to<br>
its external connection points. For outputting information to the operator of the<br>
server, they may also comprise a screen, a touch screen, a loudspeaker, or<br>
the like. The processing means 61, memory means 62, and interface block 63<br>
are electrically interconnected for performing systematic execution of operations<br>
on the received and/or stored data according to the predefined, essentially<br>
programmed processes of the unit. In an embodiment according to the<br>
invention, such operations comprise a functionality for implementing the operations<br>
of the call session control functions (CSCF) or of the PoC server as described<br>
above, or database management functions of a home subscriber<br>
server as described above.<br>
[0054] It will be obvious to a person skilled in the art that, as technology<br>
advances, the inventive concept can be implemented in various ways. The described<br>
embodiments of the invention may be combined with each other in all<br>
possible ways. For example, the receiving user may be an IMS subscriber,<br>
while the user originating the session may not be an IMS subscriber, and vice<br>
versa.<br>
[0055] The PoC service embodied herein represents a variety of media<br>
communication services that may be integrated into a variety of packet<br>
switched communication systems, herein embodied by the IP Multimedia Subsystem.<br>
For example, the S-CSCF, P-CSCF and I-CSCF may be SIP proxies<br>
and the PoC server may be a SIP server, and the HSS may be a SIP registrar<br>
in SIP networks. Alternatively, S-CSCF, P-CSCF, I-CSCF may be servers in<br>
general networks, PoC server may be a server offering a service to users and<br>
HSS may be a user database.<br>
 [0056] Furthermore, use of filter criteria, as described in the embodiment,<br>
represent one mechanism to route certain requests to specific application<br>
server(s). Any other mechanism or an address in the request may be used for<br>
routing. The invention and its embodiments are thus not limited to the examples<br>
described above but may vary within the scope of the claims.<br><br><br>
