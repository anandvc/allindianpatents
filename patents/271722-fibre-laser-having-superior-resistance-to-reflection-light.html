FIBER LASER HAVING SUPERIOR RESISTANCE TO REFLECTION LIGHT<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an MO-PA fiber laser, and particularly to a fiber<br>
laser having superior resistance to reflection light in pulse light output.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-169042, filed June<br>
27, 2007, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[Technical Background]<br>
[0002]<br>
In recent years, as a result of advances in the development of high output fiber<br>
lasers, fiber lasers have begun to be used in a variety of fields such as processing<br>
machinery, medical equipment, measuring instruments and the like. In particular, in the<br>
field of material processing, because fiber lasers have superior light focusing abilities<br>
compared to other lasers and allow an extremely small beam spot having a high power<br>
density to be obtained, they make it possible for precision processing to be performed.<br>
Moreover, they also enable non-contact processing and processing of hard substances<br>
which are able to absorb laser light to be performed so that, as a result, the use of these<br>
fiber lasers is spreading rapidly.<br>
[0003]<br>
Pulse output fiber lasers generally have an MO-PA structure in which<br>
comparatively low-power pulse light is emitted by a master oscillator (MO: Master<br>
Oscillator), and this pulse light is then amplified to a desired output by an optical fiber<br>
amplifier (PA: Power Amplifier). A schematic structural view of an MO-PA type of<br>
high output fiber laser is shown in FIG. 1. When it is not possible for pulse light to be<br>
amplified to a desired output using a single power amplifier, then in some cases a<br>
plurality of cascade-connected power amplifiers are used.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, an MO-PA type of optical fiber laser, and particularly a high output<br>
fiber laser which outputs 10W or more has the drawback that it is easily damaged by<br>
reflection light. For example, when processing is being performed using a fiber laser,<br>
there are cases when laser light output from the fiber laser is reflected by a surface of an<br>
object being processed, and a portion of this laser light gets returned to the fiber laser.<br>
Although this reflection light is faint, it is amplified as it passes through the PA towards<br>
the MO so that the power thereof increases, and there are cases when the optical<br>
components making up the MO and optical components located between the MO and the<br>
PA are damaged.<br>
[0005]<br>
Moreover, pulse light becomes amplified in the PA. and during the time until the<br>
next pulse light is irradiated into the PA, ASE (Amplified Spontaneous Emission) light is<br>
output from the rare earth-doped optical fiber which is used in the PA. When this light<br>
is reflected by the object being processed and becomes irradiated once again into the PA,<br>
there are cases in which parasitic oscillation is generated. If parasitic oscillation is<br>
generated, then pulse light having an extremely high peak value is emitted from the PA<br>
towards the MO, and there are cases when the optical components making up the MO<br>
and optical components located between the MO and the PA are damaged by this pulse<br>
light.<br>
[0006]<br>
As is disclosed, for example, in Patent document 1, consideration has been given<br>
to the use of an isolator in order to protect the optical components of the MO and optical<br>
components located between the MO and the PA from reflection light. Here, in a power<br>
amplifier which is used for optical communication, it is proposed that an isolator be used<br>
in order to prevent ASE light which is emitted from a latter-stage power amplifier being<br>
irradiated onto a prior-stage power amplifier. In the same way, in a fiber laser, it is<br>
possible to prevent reflection light being irradiated onto optical components located in<br>
the MO and between the MO and the PA by providing an isolator immediately in front of<br>
the PA.<br>

[Non-patent document 1] "Fabrication and characterization of an all-solid 2D photonic<br>

OPTICS EXPRESS 17, Vol. 13, No. 21, 2005, pp 8452-8459<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0007]<br>
However, as is disclosed in Patent document 1, even if an isolator is used, this<br>
isolator only functions normally while the fiber laser output is not more than a<br>
comparatively low several hundred mW. Although isolators which are able to be used<br>
up to approximately several W are commercially available, they are extremely expensive.<br>
[0008]<br>
Furthermore, the insertion loss of an isolator is largely dependent upon a<br>
Faraday rotator which is one of the component elements of the isolator. However, only<br>
limited materials can be used for a Faraday rotator, and in many cases it is difficult to<br>
obtain an isolator which has low loss in a desired wavelength band. In particular, when<br>
an isolator is used in a location through which laser light of several W or more is<br>
transmitted, even if only a slight loss (normal Faraday rotator loss is approximately 0.5<br>
dB) occurs, heat is generated from that loss which leads to damage.<br>
[0009]<br>
Furthermore, parasitic oscillation can be generated in any wavelength within the<br>
fluorescent wavelength region (in a wavelength region of approximately 100 nm) of the<br>
rare earth-doped optical fire used in a PA, however, sufficiently large isolation can be<br>
obtained from an isolator in a wavelength region of approximately 10 run, while isolation<br>
is low outside this wavelength, and there are cases when it is not possible to prevent the<br>
occurrence of parasitic oscillation.<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention was conceived in view of the above described<br>
circumstances, and it is an object thereof to provide a high pulse output MO-PA fiber<br>
laser in which breakage of the fiber laser from reflection light can be prevented without<br>
expensive optical components needing to be used.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[0011]<br>
In order to achieve the above described object, the present invention provides an<br>
MO-PA fiber laser which has: a master oscillator; and a first power amplifier which users<br>
as again medium a rare earth-doped optical fiber which is connected to a later stage of<br>
the master oscillator, wherein the MO-PA fiber laser has a wavelength conversion portion<br>
between the master oscillator and the power amplifier, and has a wavelength filter<br>
between the wavelength conversion portion and the master oscillator which only allows<br>
wavelength components of pulse light emitted from the master oscillator to pass.<br>
[0012]<br>
In the fiber laser of the present invention, it is preferable for a wavelength filter<br>
to be provided between the wavelength conversion portion and the power amplifier, and<br>
this wavelength filter only allows the wavelength of pulse light which was emitted from<br>
the master oscillator and was then subjected to wavelength conversion in the wavelength<br>
conversion portion to pass.<br>
[0013]<br>
In the fiber laser of the present invention, it is preferable for the wavelength<br>
conversion portion to convert the wavelength of pulse light emitted from the master<br>
oscillator to a wavelength capable of being amplified by the first power amplifier.<br>
[0014]<br>
In the fiber laser of the present invention, it is preferable for the wavelength<br>
conversion portion to be a wavelength conversion fiber which generates induced Raman<br>
scatterins.<br>
[0015]<br>
In the fiber laser of the present invention, it is preferable for the wavelength<br>
conversion fiber to be a photonic bandgap fiber.<br>
[0016]<br>
In the fiber laser of the present invention, it is preferable for the wavelength<br>
conversion portion to be a second power amplifier.<br>
[0017]<br>
In this fiber laser, it is preferable for there to be further provided a seed light<br>
source to facilitate wavelength conversion, and in synchronization with the master<br>
oscillator, for the seed light source to emit light which has the same wavelength as the<br>
wavelength of the pulse light which was emitted from the master oscillator and was then<br>
subjected to wavelength conversion in the second wavelength conversion portion, and for<br>
this light to be irradiated into the second power amplifier from the same direction as the<br>
pulse light is irradiated from the master oscillator.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
[0018]<br>
Because the fiber laser of the present invention has a structure in which a<br>
wavelength conversion portion is provided between the master oscillator (MO) and the<br>
power amplifier (PA), and in which a wavelength filter is provided between the<br>
wavelength conversion portion and the master oscillator which only allows wavelength<br>
components of pulse light emitted from the master oscillator to pass, because the<br>
wavelength of the pulse light emitted from the master oscillator is different from the<br>
wavelength of reflection light pulses, without using an isolator it is possible to protect<br>
components from the reflection light pulses by using a wavelength filter such as a BPF or<br>
the like in front of and behind the wavelength converter.<br>
Moreover, because it is not necessary to use an extremely expensive isolator, the<br>
cost of the fiber laser can be lowered.<br>
Moreover, because Raman scattering is used in the wavelength conversion,<br>
wavelength conversion can be performed irrespective of the wavelength of the pulse light<br>
emitted from the master oscillator.<br>
Moreover, because it is possible to increase the power of the pulse light<br>
irradiated into the PA by using a power amplifier for the wavelength conversion, only a<br>
small amount of excitation power is needed to obtain a desired output, and the costs of<br>
the fiber laser can be kept in check.<br>
Moreover, because it is possible to increase the power of the pulse light<br>
irradiated into the PA by using a power amplifier for the wavelength conversion, only a<br>
small amount of excitation power is needed to obtain a desired output, and parasitic<br>
oscillation can be suppressed in the PA. As a result, the reliability of a fiber laser can be<br>
improved.<br>

[Best Embodiments for Implementing the Invention]<br>
[0021]<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference<br>
made to the drawings.<br>
FIG 2 is a structural view showing an embodiment of the fiber laser of the<br>
present invention. A fiber laser 100 of the present embodiment is formed by providing<br>
a wavelength converter 130 between a master oscillator (referred to below as an MO) 110<br>
and a power amplifier (referred to below as a PA) 120, and by providing a first<br>
wavelength filter 140 between the MO 110 and the wavelength converter 130. and by<br>
providing a second wavelength filter 150 between the wavelength converter 130 and the<br>
PA 120. The first wavelength filter 140, the wavelength converter 130, and the second<br>
wavelength filter 150 which are provided between the MO-PA perform the following<br>
operations when pulse light emitted from the MO 110 passes through them towards the<br>
PA 120.<br>
[0022]<br>
The pulse light emitted from the MO 110 passes through the first wavelength<br>
filter 140 and enters the wavelength converter 130. The wavelength converter 150<br>
converts the wavelength of the input pulse light. The wavelength after this conversion<br>
is within the gain wavelength band of the PA 120 so that it can be amplified to the desired<br>
output by the PA 120. The second wavelength filter 150 receives the pulse light whose<br>
wavelength has been converted by the wavelength converter 150, and blocks components<br>
thereof whose wavelength was not converted by the wavelength converter 150. In this<br>
manner, pulse light which has passed through the second wavelength filter 150 is<br>
amplified to the desired output by the PA 120 and is then output.<br>
[0023]<br>
The first wavelength filter 140, the wavelength converter 130, and the second<br>
wavelength filter 150 also perform the following operations on reflection light. When<br>
laser light which has already been output is irradiated once again into the PA 120 due to it<br>
being reflected by external objects or the like, even if there is only a tiny quantity of<br>
reflection light, this becomes amplified as it passes through the PA 120 so as to become<br>
high intensity pulses and enter the second filter 150. Because the reflection light pulses<br>
which have entered the second wavelength filter 150 have the same wavelength as the<br>
pulses irradiated into the PA 120 from the wavelength converter 150, they are able to pass<br>
along without being blocked by the second wavelength filter 150, and enter the<br>
wavelength converter 130. The reflection light pulses passing through the wavelength<br>
converter 130 do become irradiated into the first wavelength filter 140, however, because<br>
the wavelength of the reflection light pulses is a different wavelength from the<br>
wavelength of the pulse light originally emitted from the MO 110, they are blocked by<br>
the first wavelength filter 140. As is described above, because it is possible to block<br>
reflection light pulses entering the MO 110 without using an isolator, it is possible to<br>
prevent the components inside the MO 110 being damaged by reflection light.<br>
Specific examples are described below.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0024]<br>
The MO 110 is a laser oscillator, and a fiber ring laser is used for the MO 110 in<br>
the present example. As is shown in FIG. 3, this fiber ring laser is formed by a pumping<br>
light source 111, a WDM coupler 112 which couples the pumping light with laser light, a<br>
rare earth-doped optical fiber 113 which serves as a gain medium, an isolator 114, a<br>
band-pass filter 117, an optical switch 118, and an output coupler 115. Excitation light<br>
emitted from the pumping light source 111 is irradiated into the rare earth-doped optical<br>
fiber 113 via the WDM coupler 112. The pumping light irradiated into the rare<br>
earth-doped optical fiber 113 is absorbed by rare earth ions with which the core of the<br>
rare earth-doped optical fiber 113 has been doped, so that the rare earth ions are placed in<br>
an excited state. The rare earth ions which are in an excited state emit spontaneous<br>
emission light of a specific wavelength. This spontaneous emission light is propagated<br>
through the interior of the rare earth-doped optical fiber 113 while it is being amplified,<br>
and is output as an ASE (Amplified Spontaneous Emission). The WDM coupler 112,<br>
the rare earth-doped optical fiber 113, the isolator 114, the discharge coupler 115, the<br>
band-pass filter 117, and the optical switch 118 are connected in a ring state, and the ASE<br>
of the wavelength of the transmission bandwidth of the band-pass filter 117 travels<br>
around through these components and is amplified again by the rare earth-doped optical<br>
fiber 113. Eventually, laser oscillation occurs and a portion thereof is output as laser<br>
light via the output coupler 115. The optical switch element 117 normally makes CW<br>
emissions if left in a low-loss state, and the laser output is output as continuous light. If<br>
the optical switch element 117 is made to switch cyclically between a low-loss state and<br>
a high-loss state, then pulse light is emitted and a pulse laser output can be obtained.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the present example, the rare earth-doped optical fiber 113 of the MO 110 is<br>
formed by doping Yb ions in a core having a core diameter of 4 um, so as to form an<br>
optical fiber having an absorption rate of 500dB/m@976nm. The pumping light source<br>
which is used oscillates at a wavelength of 976 nm so as to excite the Yb ions with which<br>
the core of the rare earth-doped optical fiber has been doped, while an acousto-optic<br>
modulator (AOM) is used for the optical switch element. When the pumping light<br>
source was driven so that an output of 500 mW was obtained and the AOM was operated<br>
at a frequency of 20 kHz, a pulse output having a pulse width of 50 ns and a peak power<br>
of approximately 70 W was obtained as the MO output.<br>
[0026]<br>
As the MO 110, instead of this type of fiber ring laser, it is also possible to use a<br>
combination of, for example, a Fabry-Perot type of fiber laser in which a resonator mirror<br>
is provided at both ends of a rare earth-doped optical fiber or a semiconductor laser<br>
which outputs continuous light with an external modulator.<br>
[0027]<br>
In contrast, for the PA 120, a PA having a structure such as that shown in FIG. 4<br>
is used.<br>
This PA 120 is formed by a pumping light source 121, an optical coupler 123, a<br>
rare earth-doped double clad fiber 125, and a pumping light source 121. The optical<br>
coupler 123 may be formed by an optical coupler such as that disclosed, for example, in<br>
Patent document 3. This optical coupler 123 1ms a plurality of excitation ports 122<br>
which are formed by multimode optical fibers, and one signal port 122 which is formed<br>
by a single mode fiber, and has a single discharge port 124 which is formed by<br>
melt-drawing these ports into an integrated unit.<br>
[0028]<br>
Laser light emitted from the MO 110 is irradiated from the signal ports 122, and<br>
is irradiated into the core of the rare earth-doped double clad fiber 125 via the optical<br>
coupler 123. The pumping light sources 121 are connected to one side of the excitation<br>
ports 122, and the pumping light is irradiated into a first cladding of the rare earth-doped<br>
double clad fiber 125 via the optical coupler 123. The pumping light which is irradiated<br>
into the first cladding of the rare earth-doped double clad fiber 125 is absorbed by the<br>
rare earth ions with which the core has been doped so that a population inversion is<br>
formed, and as a result of a stimulated emission being generated, the laser light<br>
propagating through the core interior is amplified and is output as a laser output.<br>
[0029]<br>
In the present example, an Yb-doped double clad fiber which has had ytterbium<br>
ions doped in the core thereof is used for the rare earth-doped double clad fiber 125 of<br>
the PA 120, and this fiber has a core diameter of 6 µm, a first cladding diameter of 125<br>
um, and a core absorption of 1200 dB/m at 976 nm. A pumping light source having a<br>
wavelength of 915 nm was used for the pumping light source in order to excite the Yb<br>
ions. The output per pumping light source was 6 W, so that by using 12 light sources, it<br>
was possible to irradiate a maximum of 72 W of pumping light. The number of<br>
pumping light sources (i.e., the maximum power) is adjusted in accordance with the<br>
required laser output. If the desired output cannot be obtained from the output from the<br>
PA 120, it is possible to provide a PA having the same structure at a downstream point<br>
from the PA 120 so as to amplify the output to the desired output.<br>
[0030]<br>
A wavelength conversion fiber was used for the wavelength converter 130.<br>
This wavelength conversion fiber is a fiber in which, when high intensity light is<br>
irradiated therein, the wavelength of incident light is shifted to the long wavelength side<br>
by induced Raman scattering. The light intensity which generates induced Raman<br>
scattering can be adjusted by means of the core diameter and fiber length of the<br>
wavelength conversion optical fiber. In the present example, by using 50 m of a single<br>
mode fiber having a core diameter of 6 um, if the peak value of the pulse light irradiated<br>
into the wavelength conversion fiber exceeds approximately 50 W, then wavelength<br>
conversion by means of induced Raman scattering occurs.<br>
[0031]<br>
Because the pulse light emitted from the MO 110 of the present example has a<br>
peak value of approximately 70 W, sufficient wavelength conversion is able to take place.<br>
The wavelength of the pulse light emitted from the MO 110 is 1040 nm, as is shown in<br>
FIG. 5, and when this pulse light passes through the wavelength conversion optical fiber,<br>
as is shown in FIG. 6, the wavelength of this pulse light is shifted by Raman scattering to<br>
approximately 1090 nm. In FIG 6, only light having a wavelength of 1090 nm (i.e., 1st<br>
Raman light) is generated, however, if adjustments are made in order to make induced<br>
Raman scattering occur more easily such as by extending the fiber length or reducing the<br>
core diameter or the like, then it becomes possible to perform wavelength conversion at<br>
even longer wavelengths, for example, at 1140 nm (i.e.. 2nd Raman light). In the<br>
present example, pulse light undergoes wavelength conversion only at 1090 nm so mat<br>
pulse amplification by the Yb-doped double clad fiber 125 of the PA 120 which is<br>
connected at a later stage is possible. Moreover, if the temporal waveform of the pulse<br>
light is completely square, then complete wavelength conversion to 1090 nm is possible,<br>
however, the temporal waveform of the pulses actually emitted from the MO 110 is a<br>
shape such as that shown in FIG. 8, so that wavelength conversion does not occur in the<br>
pulse leading edges and pulse trailing edges, and wavelength conversion occurs at<br>
approximately the pulse peak. Because of this, pulse light in which both 1040 nm and<br>
1019 nm wavelength components are included is emitted in the output light from the<br>
wavelength conversion fiber.<br>
[0032]<br>
A band-pass filter which is designed so as to transmit light in the vicinity of a<br>
wavelength of 1040 nm from among the pulse light emitted from the MO 110 is used for<br>
the first wavelength filter 140, while a band-pass filter which is designed so as to<br>
transmit light in the vicinity of the after conversion wavelength of 1090 nm is used for<br>
the second wavelength filter 150. A dielectric multilayer membrane filter is used for<br>
each filter. Accordingly, of the pulse light (see FIG. 6) emitted from the wavelength<br>
conversion fiber, only pulse light having wavelength components in the vicinity of the<br>
1090 nm wavelength is allowed to pass through (see FIG. 7). At this time, the pulse<br>
waveform changes from the waveform shown in FIG. 8 to the waveform shown in FIG 9,<br>
so that the pulse width also becomes narrower. As is described above, this is because<br>
the wavelength conversion is only generated in the vicinity of the pulse peak. Moreover,<br>
as a result of the pulse width being narrowed by the wavelength conversion, when it is<br>
amplified by the PA 120 it can be amplified to an even higher peak value.<br>
[0033]<br>
The pulse light which has passed through the second wavelength filter 150 is<br>
irradiated into the PA 120 where it is amplified, and it is then output as a laser output.<br>
In the present example, because the pumping light power is 70 W, an output of 25 W is<br>
obtained, and pulses having a pulse width of 53 ns and a peak power of 25 kW are<br>
obtained.<br>
[0034]<br>
Next, with the fiber laser being driven such that the laser output is 25 W, a<br>
mirror was placed at the emission end of the PA 120 so as to change the return loss and<br>
measurements were made of the average power of the reflection light pulses returning<br>
from the PA 120 to the MO 110 and of the power of the reflection light pulses passing<br>
through the first wavelength filter 140 and entering the MO 110. The results thereof are<br>
shown in FIG. 10.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 10, at the maximum power, approximately 30 dBm (1 W) of<br>
reflection light pulses were emitted from the PA 120 towards the MO 110. Even if 1 W<br>
of reflection light pulses enter the MO 110, the optical components used in the MO 110<br>
are damaged. However, the power of the reflection light pulses actually entering the<br>
MO 110 was kept to 0 dBm (1 mW) or less.<br>
[0035]<br>
The reason for this is that, because the first wavelength filter 140 only allows<br>
light having the same wavelength as the MO 110 to pass, when reflection light pulses<br>
which have undergone wavelength conversion and whose wavelength has been changed<br>
pass through the first wavelength filter 140, they are blocked. Normally, the optical<br>
components used in the MO 110 are not damaged provided that the power is 100 mW.<br>
Moreover, because dielectric multilayer membranes having superior properties to handle<br>
power are used for the wavelength filters 140 and 150, they are not damaged even when<br>
blocking high intensity reflection light pulses. In addition, expensive isolators are also<br>
not required.<br>
[0036]<br>
Here, a wavelength conversion Technology in which wavelength conversion is<br>
achieved by Raman scattering which is generated as a result of signal light being<br>
irradiated into a highly nonlinear fiber, and thereafter only the wavelength components<br>
after the wavelength conversion are extracted by a wavelength filter is disclosed, for<br>
example, in Patent document 2. If this structure is provided between the MO 110 and<br>
the PA 120 of the present example, then when irradiation takes place from the MO 110 to<br>
the PA 120, wavelength conversion into pulse light which is capable of being amplified<br>
by the PA 120 is possible, however, reflection light passes through both the wavelength<br>
filter and the highly nonlinear fiber, and enters into the MO 110. As a result, using this<br>
structure it is not possible to protect the MO 110 from reflection light pulses.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0037]<br>
In Example 1, the wavelength spectrum of the Raman conversion had the form<br>
shown in FIG. 6. and there was considerable power loss when the light passed through<br>
the second wavelength filter 150. Even if the occurrence of Raman scattering was<br>
facilitated by adjusting the length of the wavelength conversion fiber and the like,<br>
because 2nd Raman light begins to be generated, it is not possible to increase the power<br>
of the 1st Raman light beyond this. Therefore, by using a photonic bandgap fiber<br>
(abbreviated below to PBGF) for the wavelength converter 130 in the same structure as<br>
that employed in Example 1, power loss is suppressed and an improvement in efficiency<br>
is achieved.<br>
[0038]<br>
A PBGF is disclosed, for example, in Non-patent document 1. A<br>
cross-sectional view of a PBGF is shown in FIG. 11, while a refractive index profile in<br>
the radial direction thereof is shown in FIG. 12. This PBGF 500 has an area 501 in the<br>
center thereof which has the same low refractive index as pure quartz, and has a portion<br>
502 surrounding the area 501 which has been formed with a higher refractive index<br>
through the addition of Ge or the like. This high refractive index portion is arranged in<br>
a triangular lattice-shaped periodic structure. By adjusting the diameter and spacings of<br>
this high refractive index portion, a photonic band having the desired wavelength band<br>
can be formed. When light is irradiated into the low refractive index area 501 of this<br>
PBGF 500, because light in the photonic bandgap wavelength region cannot be guided<br>
through the higher refractive index portion 502 which has been arranged in the periodic<br>
structure, it becomes confined in the low refractive index area 501, and is guided through<br>
the core area. This is different from the waveguide principle governing optical fibers<br>
used in conventional optical communication and the like. Because light in wavelength<br>
regions other than this can also be guided through the periodic structure, it radiates<br>
outwards in its existing form over the entire surface of the fiber. Namely, an optical<br>
fiber is formed in which, in the wavelength regions of the photonic bandgap, the low<br>
refractive index regions function as a core towards light and the high refractive index<br>
regions function as cladding towards light.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the present example, a photonic bandgap is placed in the wavelength regions<br>
of the pulse light emitted from the MO 110 and of the 1st Raman light thereof (i.e., 1020<br>
~ 1120 nm), while the PBGF 500 which is outside the wavelength band of the photonic<br>
bandgap is used as a wavelength conversion fiber in the wavelength regions of the 2nd<br>
Raman light (i.e.. 1140 11m). By employing this type of structure, when pulse light<br>
emitted from the MO 110 travels towards the PA 120, the pulse light emitted from the<br>
MO 110 as well as the 1st Raman light thereof are propagated while being confined to<br>
the core region, and Raman scattered light generated by the 1st Raman light is discharged<br>
before it undergoes induced Raman scattering without being propagated along the core<br>
region. Provided that induced Raman scattering does not occur, because it is possible to<br>
effectively suppress wavelength conversion from 1 st Raman light to 2nd Raman light, by<br>
using this PBGF 500 it is possible to generate more 1 st Raman light than is generated<br>
using the wavelength conversion optical fiber of Example 1.<br>
[0040]<br>
FIG. 13 shows the output wavelength spectrum from the PBGF 500 when the<br>
PBGF 500 was used as the wavelength converter 130. Compared with the case of<br>
Example 1 (see FIG. 6), it was possible to generate a greater amount of pulse light having<br>
a wavelength of 1090 nm. The loss occurring during passage through the second<br>
wavelength filter 150 was 3.5 dB in Example 1, while in the present example, this loss<br>
was reduced to 1.8 dB.<br>
[0041]<br>
Moreover, by reducing this loss, the following effects were also obtained.<br>
As a result of loss being reduced, the power of the pulse light input into the PA<br>
120 is increased, so that the excitation power required to obtain an output of 25 W, which<br>
is the same as in Example 1, is decreased to 65 W. Namely, it is possible to obtain the<br>
same output as that obtained in Example 1 using less excitation power. The pumping<br>
light source in the fiber laser is one of the more expensive components thereof, and if it is<br>
possible to reduce the required excitation power, then this has a considerable effect<br>
towards lowering costs. Moreover, because it is possible to reduce the excitation power,<br>
it is possible to lower the gain of the rare earth-doped fiber and thereby make it more<br>
difficult for parasitic oscillation to occur. As a result, the effect is obtained that it is<br>
possible to improve the reliability of the fiber laser.<br>
[0042]<br>
With the fiber laser being driven such that the laser output is 25 W, in the same<br>
way as in Example 1, a mirror was placed at the emission end of the PA 120 so as to set<br>
the return loss to 20 dB, and measurements were made of the average power of the<br>
reflection light pulses returning from the PA 120 to the MO 110 and of the power of the<br>
light pulses passing through the first wavelength filter 140 and entering the MO 110.<br>
As a result, it was found that, at the maximum power, approximately 29 dBm (0.8 W) of<br>
reflection light pulses were emitted from the PA 120 towards the MO 110. Accordingly,<br>
the power of the reflection light pulses entering the MO 110 was kept to -3 dBm (0.5<br>
mW), so that substantially the same effects were obtained as those obtained from<br>
Example 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0043]<br>
In Example 2, by using a PBGF for the wavelength converter, power loss was<br>
suppressed so that efficiency was improved.<br>
However, in order for satisfactory wavelength conversion to occur, an extremely<br>
long wavelength conversion fiber of the order of several tens of meters is necessary.<br>
Because of this, workability during the making of the laser is poor, and a considerable<br>
space is required for containment. In particular, as is shown in FIG 12, because a<br>
PBGF presents a complex refractive index structure, manufacturability is worse than<br>
when a normal fiber is used and there is a consequent increase in costs.<br>
[0044]<br>
Light entering the wavelength converter 130 generates light having a longer<br>
wavelength than incident light through natural Raman scattering as it is propagated<br>
through a PBGF. This natural Raman scattered light gradually accumulates as the<br>
incident light is propagated through the PBGF. When it reaches a particular intensity,<br>
an abrupt wavelength shift occurs due to induced Raman scattering.<br>
[0045]<br>
Accordingly, the generation of 2nd Raman light occurs when the incident light<br>
approaches the emission side of the wavelength converter 130. Accordingly, even if the<br>
portion on the incident side of the wavelength converter 130 is not a PBGF fiber,<br>
provided that a PBGF is used for the emission side portion, then it is possible to suppress<br>
the generation of 2nd Raman light.<br>
[0046]<br>
In light of the above, the following modifications were made to the laser of<br>
Example 2.<br>
While the basic structure thereof remains the same as in Example 2, Example 3<br>
differs in that the wavelength converter 130 is constructed from two portions such as<br>
those described below (see FIG. 14).<br>
[0047]<br>
A single mode fiber having a core diameter of 4 um was used for a first<br>
wavelength converter 131. By making the core diameter smaller compared with<br>
Example 1, it is possible to increase the power density of the light being propagated<br>
through the core interior, and wavelength conversion can occur in a shorter optical fiber.<br>
The length of the fiber was adjusted to a length (15 m) at which 1st Raman light was<br>
slightly observed in the output light from the first wavelength converter 131. The<br>
output spectrum from the first wavelength converter is shown in FIG. 15.<br>
[0048]<br>
A second wavelength converter was formed from 25 m of the same fiber as that<br>
used in Example 2. The output spectrum for this was the same as the output spectrum<br>
for the output from the PBGF in Example 2 (see FIG. 13). so that the wavelength<br>
converter 130 had identical functions as in the structure in Example 2.<br>
Moreover, the PBGF used here had half the length compared to the examples,<br>
showing that it is possible to shorten the PBGF which is used.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0049]<br>
An Yb-doped power amplifier was used as the wavelength converter 130. For<br>
the Yb-doped fiber, a fiber having a double clad structure with a core diameter of 6 urn<br>
and a cladding diameter of 120 um was used, and the core absorption was 1200 dB/m (@<br>
976 run). The length of this Yb-doped optical fiber and the intensity of the pumping<br>
light were adjusted such that the maximum gain wavelength of the Yb-doped optical<br>
fiber was in the vicinity of 1090 nm. When pulse light emitted from the MO 110 was<br>
irradiated thereon, an output such as that shown in FIG 16 was obtained, and it was<br>
possible to convert the wavelength of the pulse light from 1040 nm to 1090 nm.<br>
Here, pulse light may in some cases also be generated at 1140 nm depending on the<br>
operating conditions of the power amplifier. This is because the pulse light whose<br>
wavelength has been converted to 1090 nm undergoes a wavelength shift due to Raman<br>
scattering, and if a large amount of this pulse light is generated, it may cause loss.<br>
Because of this, it is also possible to suppress wavelength shift which is caused by<br>
Raman scattering by using an Yb-doped optical fiber having a large core diameter, or by<br>
using a fiber obtained by doping YB ions into the core of the PBGF 500. It is also<br>
possible to facilitate wavelength shitting by inputting seed light from the same direction<br>
as the pulse light is irradiated from the MO 110 into the power amplifier. The seed light<br>
may be irradiated into the power amplifier in synchronization with the pulse light at the<br>
wavelength at which wavelength conversion is desired.<br>
[0050]<br>
Next, the pulse light which has undergone wavelength conversion was amplified<br>
by the PA 120, and adjustments were made such that the laser output was 25 W. In the<br>
same way as in Example 1 a mirror was then placed at the emission end of the PA 120 so<br>
as to set the return loss to 20 dB, and measurements were made of the average power of<br>
the reflection light pulses returning from the PA 120 to the MO 110 and of the power of<br>
the reflection light pulses passing through the first wavelength filter 140 and entering the<br>
MO 110. As a result, it was found that, at the maximum power, approximately 29 dBm<br>
(0.8 W) of reflection light pulses were emitted from the PA 120 towards the MO 110.<br>
Accordingly, it was confirmed that the power of the reflection light pulses entering the<br>
MO 110 was kept to -8 dBm (6mW). Because the reflection light was amplified when<br>
it passed through the power amplifier, the power of the reflection light pulses was greater<br>
compared with Example 1 and Example 2, however, it was still kept sufficiently small so<br>
that the optical components in the MO 110 were not broken.<br>
[0051]<br>
Moreover, by using a power amplifier as the wavelength converter 130, it was<br>
possible to obtain effects w?hich could not be obtained in Example 1 and Example 2. In<br>
the present example, while the power of the pulse light prior to wavelength conversion<br>
was 70 mW, the output after wavelength conversion was amplified up to 900 mW.<br>
Namely, the power of the pulse light irradiated into the PA 120 was able to be increased<br>
by a factor of 10 or more compared with Example 1 and Example 2. If the power of the<br>
pulse light irradiated into the PA 120 is increased, then it is possible to reduce the<br>
pumping light of the PA 120 which is required to obtain a predetermined output.<br>
Namely, because the gain of the PA 120 can be lowered, it is possible to prevent damage<br>
to the fiber laser caused by parasitic oscillation. The further merit is obtained that it is<br>
possible to decrease the number of pumping light lasers which make up the greatest<br>
proportion of the cost of a fiber laser.<br>
[Industrial applicability]<br>
According to the fiber laser of the present invention, it is possible to prevent<br>
breakage to a fiber laser which is caused by reflection light without using high-cost<br>
optical components.<br>
