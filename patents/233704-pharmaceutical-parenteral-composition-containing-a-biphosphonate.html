				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a parenteral composition comprising a bisphosphonic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (bisphosphonate) as active component, a pharmaceutically acceptable chelating agent and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, processes of the preparation of this composition, and methods of their use in the treatment and prevention of diseases involving bone resorption, especially osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and metabolic bone disease. The compositions are especially useful for improving the local tolerance of the active component when administered parenterally, especially by the subcutaneous route.<br>
Bisphosphonates, i.e. bisphosphonic acids or soluble, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are synthetic analogs of the naturally occurring pyrophosphate. Due to their marked affinity for solid-phase calcium phosphate, bisphosphonates bind strongly to bone mineral. Pharmacologically active bisphosphonates are well known in the art and are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and are therefore useful in the treatment and prevention of diseases involving abnormal bone resorption, especially osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and metabolic bone disease.<br>
Bisphosphonates as pharmaceutical agents-are described for example in EP-A-170,228, EP-A-197,478, EP-A-22,751; EP-A-252,504, EP-A- 252,505, EP-A-258,618. EP-A-350,002, EP-A-273,190, WO-A-90/00798, etc.<br><br>
Phafni'aeeutical forms of marketed bisphosphonates are oral formulations (tablets or capsules) or solutions for intravenous injection or infusion. They are systemically well tolerated when administered at therapeutic doses. However, bisphosphonates as a class are ritant to skin and mucous membranes resulting in digestive tract side effects, e.g. sophageal adverse events or gastrointestinal disturbances. In consequence, the oral route f administration has to follow inconvenient recommendations of us;: for the patient. The atravenous route of administration is complicated by adverse events in case of application allure. If the vein is not exactly met or if the drug is administered inadvertently by the )aravenous route, severe local tissue reaction are induced including necroses. Thus, there s a substantial need to improve the pharmaceutical formulation of bisphosphonates in jrder to reduce or avoid tissue damage after parenteral administration, especially by the iubcutaneous route.<br>
The pathophysiological mechanism of bisphosphonate induced tissue damage is unknown. As the local reactions are similar for different bisphosphonates, at least those induced by nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (amino-bisphosphonates), a common mechanism must be assumed. The delay in onset and progress of local reactions may indicate the involvement of the unspecific immune defense system.<br>
Attempts were made to improve tissue tolerance of bisphosphonates by developing suspensions of insoluble or poorly soluble salts of bisphosphonates providing local sustained release, e.g. described in EP-A-913007740, DE-A-4244422 and DE-A-4244423. However, this approach proved to improve only slightly the local tolerance.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is therefore to provide a composition which is able to minimize or suppress the above mentioned disadvantages.<br>
The problem is solved, according to the present invention, by a parenteral composition comprising a bisphosphonate, a pharmaceutically acceptable chelating agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that administering a bisphosphonate in a composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable chelating agent clearly improves the duration, frequency and intensity of side effects. The presence of an additional bivalent cation chelator, especially EDTA and DTPA, substantially improved the adverse local reaction at the application sites when compared with the corresponding formulation without this additional bivalent cation chelator.<br><br>
Unless otherwise indicated the following definitions are set forth to illustrate and â– 'efme the meaning and scope of the various terms used to describe the invention herein.<br>
The term "bisphosphonate" means compounds characterised by two C-PO&gt;^" bonds, f the two bonds are located on the same carbon atom, the compounds are called geminal 'isphosphonates. It should be noted that the term "bisphosphonate" as used herein in eferring to the therapeutic agents of the present invention are meant to also encompass liphosphonates, biphosphonic acids, and diphosphonic acids, as well as salts and lerivatives of these materials. The use of a specific nomenclature in referring to the Ksphosphonate or bisphosphonates is not meant to limit the scope of the present nvention, unless specifically indicated.<br>
The term "chelating agent" or "chelator" means an organic or inorganic compound, which forms via two or more of its functional groups stable ring-shaped complexes with metal cations. It should be noted that bisphosphonates have also chelating activity. The term "chelating agent" is therefore understood to be a chelator which sequesters metal ions competitively to the bisphosphonate used as the active component in the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein means that the salts or chelating agents are acceptable firom a toxicity viewpoint.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as potassium and sodium (including mono, di- and tri-sodium) salts (which are preferred), alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth.<br>
The term "alkyl", alone or in combination, means a straight-chain, branched-chain, or cyclic alkyl group containing a maximum of 30, preferably a maximum of 10, and more preferably a maximum of 7, carbon atoms, e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, 2-methylpropyl (iso-butyl), 1-methylethyl (iso-propyl), n-butyl, 1,1-dimethylethyl (t-butyl), and pentyl. The term "alkyl" also comprises the above defined groups, optionally substituted with phenyl, pyridyl, fiiranyl, pyrrolidinyl, imidazolyl, amino, mono- or dialkylamino, hydroxy, SH, and alkoxy.<br>
The term "diluent" means an ingredient in a medicinal preparation which lacks pharmacological activity but is pharmaceutically necessary or desirable. For example a diluent may be a liquid for the dissolution of drug(s) to be injected, e.g. water.<br><br>
The term "solvents'" refers to aiiquid that holds another substance in solution, iifci, dissolves it, e.g. water<br>
The term "preservatives" refers to a substance added to a pharmaceutical preparation to prevent bacterial growth.<br>
The term "device" means a contrivance for a specific purpose. In the present invention the purpose is to enable, support or facilitate parenteral drug administration.<br>
The term "local anaesthetic" refers to a compound that reversibly depresses neuronal function at the site of application, producing loss of ability to perceive pain and/or other sensations, e.g. lidocaine hydrochloride.<br>
In more detail, the present invention is directed to a parenteral composition comprising a bisphosphonate and a pharmaceutically acceptable chelating agent. The parenteral compositions may have the form of a liquid, e.g. an aqueous solution, or a steril powder and/or lyophilisate. A liquid, e.g. water, may be added to the steril powder and/or lyophilisate to give a solution for administration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the above composition is a liquid, preferably an aqueous solution.<br>

The pharmaceutically chelating agent or chelator or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention is a compound, which forms via two or more of its functional groups stable ring-shaped complexes with metal cations, e.g. preferably a polyacetic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof like EDTA and DTP A. Chelating agents are complexes, â€¢tvhich unlike simple ligands, e.g. ferrocyanide (Fe(CN)6^ â– ), which form complex salts by a single bond provided by a lone electron pair, are capable of forming more than one bond. Ethylene diamine, for example, is bidentate (two links), tripyridyl is tridentate (three) and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is hexadentate (six) which makes it particularly effective as a pharmaceutical chelating agent. One of the consequence of chelation is the formation of a cyclic structure which has high thermodynamic and thermal stability analogous to aromatic rings. Furthermore, the chelate complex is usually more stable than the ligand, since two bonds must rupture, and although one may break, reformation occurs before the other can. This is known as the chelate effect.<br>
Preferably the chelating agent is a bivalent cation chelator and more preferably, the chelator is selected from the group consisting of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), ethylene glycol-bis(p-aminoethyl ether)-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), N (hydroxyethyl) ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), triethanolamine, 8-hydroxyquinoUne, citric acid, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, gluconic acid, saccharic acid, thiodipropionic acid, acetonic dicarboxylic acid, lecithin, di(hydroxyethyl)glycine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, glycerin, sorbitol and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
More preferably the chelating agent is selected from the group consisting of EDTA, DTPA, citric acid, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, gluconic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and even more preferably iht pharmaceutically chelating agent is EDTA and DTPA or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the molar ratio between the bisphosphonate and the pharmaceutically acceptable chelating agent is about 1:0.01 to<br><br>
about 1: :â–  500, more preferably about" 1:0.1 to, about 1: 50, and even more preferably is about 1:10.<br>
For example, a formulation containing 1 mg ibandronate/ ml physiological saline adjusted to pH 7.4. EDTA was added to the ibandronate solution at a concentration range of 0.1 to 10 mg/ml. This corresponds to molar ibandronate to EDTA ratios of approximately 1: 0.1 to 1:10. The improving effect of EDTA was shown to be dose-related . At the lowest ratio of 1:0.1 there was still some beneficial effect and at the highest ratio of 1:10, the local adverse reactions were still not completely abolished. Thus, much higher and lower molar ratios can be expected to be also useful to improve the local tolerance of parenterally administered bisphosphonate formulations. In addition, the effect of EDTA on alendronate induced local reaction as well as the efficacy of DTPA as chelating agent could also be demonstrated.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Local Tolerance Test I<br>
Groups of 3 rats were treated with test formulations containing 1 mg ibandronate / ml physiological saline buffered at pH 7.4. One group of rats received the test formulation without any additional additive, another group received the test solution with 1 mg EDTA /ml as an additive. The back of the rat was shaved one day before treatment. A volume of 0.5 ml each was injected subcutaneously at three different sites of the right part of shaved back. The left side of the back was treated with the corresponding formulation without ibandronate (placebo). Local reactions were assessed by a scoring system for swelling: 0 = no reaction, 0.5 = barely perceptible swelling, 1 = slight swelling, 2 = moderate swelling, 3 = marked swelling, 4 = severe swelling. The animals were observed over 9 days and thereafter necropsied. At necropsy, the diameter of subcutaneous lesions, mainly consisting of reddening or swelling, was measured. The results are presented in figures 1 and 2.<br>

The same study design as described in example 1 was applied to examine the concentration dependence of the EDTA effect. EDTA was added at concentrations of 0.1, LO and 10 mg/ml. The results are presented in figures 3 and 4.<br>
Example 3: Local Tolerance Test III<br>
The same study design as described in example 1 was applied to examine the efficacy of DTPA on local reaction to s.c. injected ibandronate. DTPA was added at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The results are presented in figures 5 and 6.<br><br>
Exariiple 4: Local Tolerance Test IV<br>
The same study design as described in example 1 was applied to examine the efficacy of EDTA on local reaction to s.c. injected alendronate. The test formulations contained 3 mg alendronate / ml physiological saline buffered at pH 7.4. EDTA was added at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The results are presented in figures 7 and-8.<br>
In conclusion, there is clear evidence that the presence of a chelating agent, as EDTA or DTPA, in injectable formulations of bisphosphonates, as alendronate or ibandroriate, reduces both the intensity and duration of local swelling at the injection site and the severity of subcutaneous findings at necropsy after 9 days.<br><br><br><br><br>
