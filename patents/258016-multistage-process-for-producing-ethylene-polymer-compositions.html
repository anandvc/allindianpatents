MULTISTAGE PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ETHYLENE POLYMER COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to a process of producing an ethylene polymer composition, to ethylene polymer compositions obtainable by the process and to articles manufactured therefrom.<br>
Ethylene polymer compositions for use in molded articles, such as pipe, containers, cable jackets and insulations, and films require a good balance of mechanical properties, chemical resistance, processing properties, and optical properties.  While a relatively high molecular weight of the polymer is desirable, in combination with a desired higher density of the composition for enhancing certain mechanical properties, the processability of the composition is decreased at higher molecular weight.  For this reason, compositions containing polymer components of high molecular weight and low molecular weight have been proposed to address these problems.<br>
Such compositions may be obtained by physical blending, for example, by means of extruders or in other mixers, but are advantageously produced in a multi-staged reaction process to avoid the extra power and cost, and the lesser degree of homogenous blending associated with physical r blending processes.<br>
Generally, in producing polymer compositions, it is desirable to use catalysts which have small particle diameters, because such catalysts generally have high activity, which can result in process economies.  However, in the case of the multistage processes, for producing ethylene polymer compositions which are known in the art, the use of catalysts having small particle diameters can be problematic. For instance, in PCT application WO 94/22948, which relates to a process for manufacturing olefin homopolymers and<br><br>
copolymers having a bimodal molecular weight distribution, it is noted that, in a multiple-stage process, the fines produced in the first reactor are catalytically very active, which means that they tend to cause local overheating and formation of gels in the end product.<br>
Therefore, a need remains to reduce gel levels in ethylene polymer compositions produced in a multistage process, wherein the first stage is carried out in a slurry reactor.<br>
The present invention relates to a process of producing an ethylene polymer composition in multiple stages, comprising polymerizing ethylene, alone, or with a comonomer, to produce ethylene polymer in a first stage, transferring the polymer produced in the first stage into a second stage, in which second stage ethylene is polymerized, alone, or with a comonomer, in the presence of polymer produced in the first stage, and wherein the first stage is a slurry polymerization stage, and the polymerization is carried out in the presence of a catalyst system comprising: a) a solid catalyst precursor, comprising a transition metal selected from titanium and vanadium; magnesium; a halide; optionally an electron donor; and a solid particulate material comprising an inorganic oxide, wherein the median particle diameter of the solid catalyst precursor, based upon the total volume of solid catalyst precursor, D50, is from 1 to 13 micrometers; and b) an organoaluitiiniuiu compound.   All individual values and subranges between 1 to 13 micrometers, for the above D50, are disclosed herein and included herein.<br>
The present invention further relates to an ethylene polymer composition, obtainable by the process of the present invention, having a density of 0.900 - 0.980 g/cm3, and more preferably, a density of 0.900 - 0.970 g/cm3, an MI5 of 0.02 -3.5 dg/min, and less than 6 gels larger than 800 micrometer per square meter (Âµm/m2), and less than 100 gels in the range from 400 to 800 micrometer per square meter, wherein the<br><br>
number of gels is determined on a 5 square meter (m2) sample of a 50 micrometer thick cast film, prepared from the ethylene polymer composition.  The invention also relates to an article of manufacture, comprising the aforementioned composition or a composition obtained by the process of the present invention.  The ethylene composition may contain ethylene homopolymers, copolymers, terepolymers, or other mutitpolymers (polymers containing more than two comonomers). Suitable comonomers include, but are not limited to, C3-C20 a-olefins and dienes.  All individual values and subranges between 3 carbons and 20 carbons, for the C3-C20 a-olefins, are included herein and disclosed herein.<br>
The present invention further relates to an ethylene polymer compositions which are particularly well suited for downgauging blow molded containers for household and industrial products.  The inventive compositions provide molded products with increased stiffness compared to other resins of similar densities.<br>
The increased stiffness is described as high tt3-point flexural Young's modulus", according the following equations:<br>
F &gt; 1340*{l-exp [-235*(p - 0.9451)]}     (Eqn. 1)<br>
F &gt; 1355*{l-exp [-235*(p - 0.9448)]}     (Eqn. 2) with     F = 3-point flexural Young's modulus (MPa),<br>
p = density (g/cm3), and al, a2 and a3 are each a coefficient.<br>
The invention also provides an ethylene polymer composition having a density of 0.915 - 0.970 g/cm3, an MI5 of 0.02 - 3.5 g/l0min, and where the composition has a flexural Young's modulus, as measured on an Instron apparatus according to ISO 178, greater than 1340*{1-exp [-235*(density - 0.9451)]}, and also provides such a composition in combination with one or more additional features as discussed herein.<br><br>
The invention also provides an ethylene polymer composition, having a density of 0.915 - 0.970 g/cm3, an MI5 of 0.02 - 3.5 g/l0min, wherein the composition has a flexural Young's modulus greater than 1355*{l-exp [-235*(density -0.9448)]}, and also provides such a composition in combination with one or more additional features as discussed herein.<br>
The invention also provides compositions, prepared by the processes of the invention, and where the composition comprises a bimodal polyethylene resin, and where, in one embodiment, the bimodal polyethylene resin comprises a high molecular weight ethylene polymer and a low molecular weight ethylene polymer, and<br>
wherein the low molecular weight ethylene polymer has a MI2 between 10 g/10 min and 1000 g/10 min, and a density of at least 0.920 g/cm3, and<br>
wherein the composition has a density between 0.915 g/cm3 and 0.970 g/cm3.   The invention also provides for compositions with one or more other features as described herein.<br>
Figure 1 depicts flexural Young's modulus versus density profiles .<br>
In the process of the present invention, ethylene polymer compositions are made by polymerizing ethylene, alone, or with a comonomer, to produce ethylene polymer in multiple stages..  The process may be carried out, with the different stages being carried out subsequently in the same reactor, in a reactor having multiple stages or reaction zones, or a series of reactors,- each consisting of one or more stages.  In all embodiments of the present invention, polymer produced in an earlier stage is transferred into a later stage, in which later stage ethylene is polymerized, alone, or with a comonomer, in the presence of polymer produced in an earlier stage.  The polymerization in each<br><br>
stage typically occurs by a slurry polymerization, however, the polymerization may occur by another type of polymerization, such as a gas-phase polymerization.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the first stage is preferably a slurry polymerization stage.  In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium, to which ethylene, optionally comonomers, catalyst and optionally, a molecular weight control agent, such as hydrogen, are added. The suspension including the polymer and liquid diluent, also referred to as slurry, is removed from the first stage, preferably intermittently or continuously, followed, optionally, by separation of all or part of the monomer, diluent and other components, such as volatile components. The separated components thus may be recycled, optionally, after a distillation, to the first reaction stage.  The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically a hydrocarbon, which is liquid under the polymerization conditions employed.  The diluent employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. Examples of diluents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as propane, butane, pentane, hexane heptane, octane, decane, or dodecane; alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene or ethylbenzene.  Preferred diluents are alkanes having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably propane, isobutane, isopentane and hexane, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The reaction stage following the first slurry polymerization stage is a gas phase polymerization stage, a bulk polymerization stage, a solution polymerization stage or a slurry polymerization stage.  In a preferred embodiment, the second stage is a slurry polymerization stage.  In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br><br>
process consists of two or three polymerization stages in series.  In general, it is preferred that all the reaction stages are slurry reaction stages, because these are less susceptible to fouling than gas-phase reactors, when catalysts with small particle diameters are used. Furthermore, in multiple stage processes, which only employ slurry reaction stages, it is generally not necessary to remove the diluent between reaction stages.<br>
The multistage process of the present invention optionally is preceded by a catalyst prepolymerization step, which step is not considered to be a stage of the multistage reaction.  Typically, in a catalyst prepolymerization step, less than 5 weight percent, desirably less than 3 weight percent, and most preferably less than 1 weight percent of polymer, based on the total weight of the ethylene polymer composition, is produced.<br>
The multistage process of the present invention is preferably carried out to produce from 5 to 90 weight,percent of polymer in the first reactor, and preferably from 10 to 80 weight percent, based on the total ethylene polymer composition.  In a preferred embodiment, the process consists of two stages, wherein, in the first stage, from 2 0-80 weight percent of polymer is produced, and in the second stage, from 80-20 weight percent, based on the weight of the ethylene polymer composition.  In a more preferred embodiment, the process consists of two stages, wherein, in the first stage, from 40-60 weight percent of polymer is produced, and in the second stage, from 60-40 weight percent.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the polymerizations may be carried out in any suitable reactor known in the art.  Generally tank reactors, loop reactors, bubble columns, tubular reactors, or multitubular reactors are used.  The reactors may include agitators, pumps, screw conveyors, static mixers, spargers, distribution and<br><br>
redistribution devices, or baffles.  Reactors may incorporate more than one reaction-stage. Such reactors may be tank reactors with internal recirculation or external recirculation through a plug-flow reaction stage, column reactors or ring-and-disc reactors with multiple reaction stages or reactors with multiple feed, and exit nozzles, so positioned that the composition or morphology of the polymer is different in separate parts of the reactor. Reaction stages may be individually cooled, heated or operated adiabatically.<br>
In one embodiment of the process of the present invention, the process is operated continuously, and the first stage comprises a tank, which is optionally a stirred tank, provided with an external circulation section, preferably a tubular or multi-tubular section, to withdraw slurry produced in the reactor, and circulate it through the external circulation section back into the reactor.  The tank and the external circulation section are each independently operated adiabatically or non-adiabatically.  Fresh ethylene and the solid catalyst precursor may both be fed to the tank. It is advantageous to withdraw all or preferably a portion of the slurry that enters the external circulation section from the tank reactor, from said stage at a point in the external circulation section after it has passed through at least a portion of said section.  In another embodiment of the present invention, the first stage is a tank provided with external circulation through a tubular or multi-tubular section, as described above, where fresh ethylene is fed to the tank, but where the solid catalyst precursor is fed to the (multi-)tubular section, and all or preferably a portion of the slurry that enters the external circulation section from the tank reactor, is withdrawn from said stage at a point in the external circulation section after it has passed through at least a portion of said section, and before the<br><br>
point where the solid catalyst precursor is added to the external circulation section.  Preferably the point in the external circulation section where the slurry is removed from the first stage,is chosen such that it takes the slurry at least 3 0 seconds, preferably at. least 60 seconds, and more preferable at least 90 seconds, but advantageously, noc more than 600 seconds, preferably not more than 400 seconds to flow from the tank reactor to said slurry discharge point in the external circulation section.  These embodiments allow an increase in the average residence time of the catalyst in the first stage, while at the same time, ensuring a minimum residence time of the catalyst particles in the first stage, which can be controlled by the design of the external circulation section, slurry recirculation speed and location of the slurry discharge point. These embodiments can result in a further reduction of gel formation in subsequent reaction stages.<br>
A gas phase polymerization stage following the first or subsequent stages, if used, may be carried out in reactors well known in the art, for instance in a fluidized or stirred-tank reactor, as described in European patent EP-A-713 888, or U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,539, the relevant.features of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the process of the present invention, each stage may be operated continuously, in batch mode or in semi-batch mode, but preferably continuously.  The diluent, ethylene monomer, optional comonomer and molecular weight control agent, if any, may be added to each stage, separately, so as to allow control of the reaction conditions separately for each stage.<br>
The catalyst system, used in the method of the present invention, comprises a solid catalyst precursor, comprising a transition metal selected from the group of titanium and vanadium; and further comprises magnesium, a halide, and a<br><br>
solid particulate material, comprising an inorganic oxide, and optionally an electron donor.<br>
The magnesium may be used in the production of the solid catalyst precursor as magnesium metal, which generally reacts with other catalyst components to form magnesium compounds, or the magnesium may be used in the form of a magnesium compound.  Suitable magnesium compounds which may be used in the preparation of the solid catalyst precursor include magnesium halides and organomagnesium compounds.  In a preferred embodiment, magnesium halides are used, such as magnesium chloride (MgCl2), magnesium bromide (MgBr2) , magnesium iodide (Mgl2) -  In a more preferred embodiment, the magnesium halide is magnesium chloride.<br>
The transition metal, used in the preparation of the solid catalyst precursor component, is selected from titanium or vanadium.  In a preferred embodiment the titanium or vanadium metal is in the form of a compound which follows the formula:<br>
M(R)a Xb ,<br>
wherein M is titanium or vanadium, R is R1 or OR1  or OCOR1 where Ri is a C1 to C14 aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical, X is selected from Cl, Br, I, or mixtures thereof, "a" is 0 or 1, "b" is 2 to 4 inclusive, and a+b = 3 or 4. Exemplary titanium compounds include TiCl3, TiCl4, Ti(OC6H5)Cl3, Ti(OCOCH3)Cl3, Ti (OCOC6H5) Cl3, or mixtures thereof. Exemplary vanadium compounds include vanadium halides.  In a preferred embodiment, the vanadium halide is vanadium trichloride.  The solid catalyst precursor composition may also comprise mixtures of titanium and vanadium compounds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst further comprises an electron donor compound.  The electron donor compound can be an alkyl ester of an aliphatic or aromatic mono- or polycarboxylic acid, an aliphatic ketone, an<br><br>
aliphatic amine, an aliphatic alcohol, an alkyl. or cycloalkyl ether, or mixtures thereof, each electron donor having 2 to 20 carbon atoms.  Among these electron donors, the preferred are dialkyl and cycloalkyl ethers having 2 to 20 carbon atoms; dialkyl, diaryl, and alkylaryl ketones having 3 to 20 carbon atoms; and alkyl, alkoxy, and alkoxyalkyl esters of alkyl and aryl carboxylic acids having 2 to 20 carbon atoms. An especially preferred electron donor is tetrahydrofuran. Other examples of suitable electron donors are methyl formate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl ether, dioxane, di-n-propyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl anisate, ethylene carbonate, tetrahydropyran, and ethyl propionate, and anhydrides of dicarboxylic acids, such as phthalic anhydride.<br>
Another especially preferred class of electron donors is a combination of a cyclic aliphatic ether and an aliphatic alcohol.  Of this class, especially preferred combinations are tetrahydrofuran with ethanol, n-butanol or isopropanol. Other suitable electron donor combinations that may be used in the process of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004/0009869A1, now U.S. Patent 6,780,808, the relevant teachings of which, suitable electron donor combinations, are incorporated herein by reference.  Additional information is provided in US 2004/0010101, which is incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference.<br>
The catalyst precursor composition used in the present invention further comprises a solid particulate material, comprising an inorganic oxide.  Suitable inorganic oxides include silica, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, alumina, silica/alumina mixtures.  If silica is used, its surface may be modified with reagents capable of reacting with surface silanols.  In a preferred embodiment the solid particulate material is silica.  The particle size of the<br><br>
solid particulate material may be selected to suit the method chosen for producing the solid catalyst precursor.<br>
If the catalyst precursor is impregnated into the solid particulate material, the solid particulate material, comprising an inorganic oxide, is preferably a porous material, essentially inert to the polymerization.  The median particle diameter of the solid particulate material, comprising an inorganic oxide, can generally be of the same order as that of the solid catalyst precursor.  The solid particulate material, comprising the inorganic oxide, generally has a surface area, measured according to the method described in the ASTM Standard D-3663-84, of at least 3 m2/g, and preferably at least 50 m2/g; and a pore size, measured according to the method described in ASTM D-4641-87, of at least 8 nanometers, and preferably at least 10 nanometers.<br>
Alternatively, the solid particulate material, comprising an inorganic oxide, may have a particle size which is much smaller than the median diameter of the resulting solid catalyst precursor.  In this embodiment, the solid particulate material acts as a filler for the solid catalyst precursor composition, functioning both as a diluent of catalytically active materials, and to provide additional mechanical strength to the spray dried solid catalyst precursor particles.  Fumed silica, such as Cab-O-Sil TS-610 (a trademark of Cabot Corporation, USA) , is a preferred silica having such much smaller particle size.  Such silicas typically comprise primary particles, which form aggregated particles, which are typically in the form of chains.  The median particle size of the primary particles is typically less than 100 nanometers, and the aggregates typically have chain lengths of less than 0.5 micrometers.  The fumed silica has a surface area measured according to the method described<br><br>
in the ASTM Standard D-3663-84, of at least 50 m2/g and preferably at least 100 m2/g.<br>
The median particle size of the solid catalyst precursor, D50, is based upon the total volume of solid catalyst precursor, and is at least 1 micrometer, preferably at least 4 micrometers, and most preferably at least 6 micrometers.  The median particle size, D50, is preferably at most 13 micrometers, more preferably at most 11 micrometers and most preferably at most 9 micrometers.  All individual values and subranges between 1 micrometer and 13 micrometers are included herein and disclosed herein.<br>
Preferably the solid catalyst precursor satisfies the relationship (or span):<br>
2 â¥ (D90-D10) /D50 .<br>
The D5o, as discussed above, is the median particle size of the solid catalyst precursor, based upon the total volume of solid catalyst precursor, or 50 percent by volume of the particles in the sample have a diameter Â£ the stated value, D5o.  The D10 represents 10 percent of the volume of the particles in the sample that have a diameter 
More preferably the solid catalyst precursor satisfies the relationship: 1.6 â¥ (D90- D10) / D5o , still more preferably 1.5 ^ (D90- D10)/ D50, and most preferably 1.0 â¥ (D90- Di0) / D5o-<br>
Typically, the solid catalyst precursor comprises magnesium and transition metal in a molar ratio of 2:1 to 50:1; preferably greater than 5:1, and more preferably from 6:1 to 10:1.  All individual ratios and ratio subranges between 2:1 and 50:1 are included herein and disclosed herein.<br><br>
The solid catalyst precursor composition also typically comprises from 1 to 20 moles of electron donor per mole of the transition metal of solid catalyst precursor component, and preferably from 1 to 10 moles of electron donor per mole of the transition metal.  All individual values and subranges between 1 and 20 "moles of electron donor per mole of transition metal of solid catalyst precursor" are include herein and disclosed herein.<br>
If magnesium oxide, aluminum oxide or titanium oxide is used in the solid catalyst precursor, these metals and transition metal in this form are generally catalytically inactive, and therefore their content is not to be included in the calculation of the above-mentioned ratios.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the solid catalyst precursor comprises from 10 weight percent to 95 weight percent inorganic oxide particulate material, preferably silica, based upon the total weight of the solid catalyst precursor. All individual values and subranges between 10 weight percent and 95 weight percent are included herein and disclosed herein.  The solid catalyst precursor may comprises from 10 weight percent to 95 weight percent of a filler material, based upon the total weight of the solid catalyst precursor. All individual values and subranges between 10 weight percent and 95 weight percent are included herein and disclosed herein.<br>
Methods of preparing solid catalyst precursors are well known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. patent numbers 4,482,687,5,106,926, 5,290,745 and 5,442,018, which relevant parts of each, are incorporated herein, by reference.  Typically the solid catalyst precursor composition is formed by contacting a large excess of electron donor compound with the magnesium metal or magnesium compound, transition metal compound, and solid particulate material, comprising an inorganic oxide, in any order, to<br><br>
form a precursor slurry.  The mixing of the components generally takes place over several hours, and at a temperature which is below the normal boiling point of the electron donor, but preferably between 20aC and 80eC.  The excess of electron donor is then generally removed after the formation of the catalyst precursor slurry, to form the solid catalyst precursor.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst precursor composition is obtained by spray drying, wherein a solution of the catalyst precursor components is prepared and slurried with the solid particulate material.  The slurry is then spray dried by methods such as disclosed in United States Patent 5,290,745 (incorporated herein in its entirety by reference), whereby the solid particulate material comprising an inorganic oxide of the present application corresponds to the inert filler disclosed in US 5,290,745.  The average particle size of the spray dried precursor is generally adjusted by process means during spray-drying, and may optionally be altered by separation or classification techniques after spray-drying.<br>
As mentioned above, the catalyst precursor can be obtained by spray drying.  A spray-dried catalyst is the preferred mode of catalyst from.  In this option, a solution of the precursor is prepared and slurried with an inert filler.  The slurry is then spray dried by methods such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745, as discussed above. Generally, the amount of inert filler used, is that which will provide 0.3 to 2.5 millimole of titanium per gram of spray-dried precursor.  The fillers which are added to the solution prior to spray drying include any organic or inorganic compounds, which are inert to the titanium compound and the final active catalyst, such as silicon dioxide in the form of fumed silica, titanium dioxide, polystyrene, rubber modified polystyrene, magnesium chloride, and calcium<br><br>
carbonate.  The fillers can be used individually or in combination.  The spray dried precursor is 10 to 95 percent by weight filler.  Typical Mg/Ti atomic ratios in the spray dried precursor range from 3:1 to 10:1.  Average particle size and particle size distribution span can be adjusted by process means during spray-drying, and can be, furthermore, altered by separation techniques after spray-drying, although particle classification after drying introduces significant complexity to the process, and is not preferred.  Average particle sizes range from 10 to 30 microns using standard shaping and sizing techniques, and may typically run 14 microns or greater for some catalyst systems.<br>
An optional Lewis Acid modification may be accomplished either during catalyst introduction into the first polymerization reactor, during an optional pre-polymerization step or by addition of the Lewis acid directly to the polymerization reactor.  The first two techniques are preferred, as lower amounts of Lewis Acid are required to achieve the desired effect.  One particularly preferred option is addition of the Lewis Acid during catalyst feed to the reactor in inert hydrocarbon diluent.  When this is done, residence times of 1 to 2 00 minutes are desirable, particularly preferred residence times are 1 to 100 minutes. Apparatus described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,187,866 and 6,617,405 are particularly suited to Lewis Acid modification during catalyst feed.  The contents of both of these patents are incorporated herein, in their entirety, by reference.  The Lewis Acid may also be added to the catalyst precursor in a separate step prior to catalyst feed, isolating this mixture, and then feeding the mixture to the polymerization reactor. The addition of extra process steps, however, makes this a less desirable option.  Examples of suitable Lewis Acids are discussed below.<br><br>
The Lewis Acid modification can also occur during partial activation, if practiced.  Again, the apparatus described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,187,866 is particularly preferred.  A preferred partial activation system includes a diethylaluminumchloride (Et2AlCl) and trihexylaluminum (Hex3Al) system.  The partial activation is also an optional step.<br>
The solid catalyst precursor is combined with a cocatalyst to provide an active polymerization catalyst. Suitable cocatalysts comprise organoaluminium compounds. Preferred organoaluminum compounds have the structure AlRiid Xie Hi, wherein Xi is Cl or ORiii, and Rii and Riii are saturated hydrocarbon radicals containing from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, which radicals may be the same or different, we" is 0 to 2, "f" is 0 or 1, and d + e + f = 3.  The Rii and Riii may be substituted with one or more substituents which are inert under the reaction conditions employed during polymerization.

If desired, the solid catalyst precursor may be partially activated using a cocatalyst compound before it is introduced into the polymerization reactor.  In order to maintain maximum catalyst activity, and, if an electron donor is used, the cocatalyst compound is preferably employed in an amount, which will provide the catalyst with a "cocatalyst compound to electron donor" molar ratio from 0.1:1 to 1:1. Such partial activation may be carried out in a hydrocarbon slurry, optionally followed by drying of the resulting mixture to remove the solvent, at temperatures from 20Â°C to 80Â°C, preferably from 50Â°C to 70Â°C.  The resulting dried product can then be fed to the polymerization reactor, where the activation is completed with additional cocatalyst compound, which can be the same, or a different, compound. Preferably, the hydrocarbon slurry, containing both the solid catalyst precursor and cocatalyst, may be fed directly to the reactor, or the solid catalyst precursor and cocatalyst each may be added separately to the polymerization reactor.  The solid catalyst precursor feed generally contains from 1 weight percent to 75 weight percent of catalyst precursor. Preactivation in the hydrocarbon slurry is described in U.S. 6,187,866, which is incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference.<br>

Preferably, the solid catalyst precursor is sprayed dried and comprises the solid particles containing 10 to 95 weight percent filler, as described above.<br>
Where a modifier (or Lewis acid) is used, the modifiers are usually dissolved in an organic solvent such as isopentane or hexane, and, where a support is used, impregnated into the support following impregnation of the titanium compound or complex, after which the supported catalyst precursor is dried.  Modifiers are similar in chemical structure and function to the activators.For variations, see, for example, U.S. Pat.No.5,106,926,the relevant parts of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Unreacted monomer and comonomer, hydrogen and diluent can be partially or wholly removed from the suspension.  These materials can be removed from the process or recycled, optionally after distillation, to the first reaction stage.  The polymer/catalyst mixture is then transferred to the second and subsequent reaction stages.  Together with the polymer produced in the earlier stages, ethylene, optionally comonomers, hydrogen, and cocatalyst may be continuously fed to the second and subsequent reaction stages.  Preferably, fresh solid catalyst precursor is not fed to subsequent reaction stages.  The final product is continuously removed from the final reaction stage.<br>

The invention is further illustrated by means of the following examples, which are intended to illustrate the invention, and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
The median particle diameter, D50, is measured by means of a Malvern Mastersizer S modular particle size analyzer (available from Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK), calibrated with Uniform Polymer Size Standard polymer microspheres (from<br><br>
Duke Scientific Corporation,Palo Alto, USA) with a D50 of 8.9 micrometers Â± 0.3 micrometers.<br>
Information regarding particle distributions can be found in The Malvern Instruments Operator's Guide, Man 0247 Issue 2.0 (1999); which is incorporated herein, in its entirety by reference.<br>
The compositions produced, were characterized by the following tests:<br>
The MI2 is determined according to ASTM-D-1238-04, Condition 190Â°C/2.16 on compression molded plaques.<br>
The MI5 is determined according to ASTM-D-123 8-04, Condition 19 0Â°C/5.0 on compression molded plaques. The pellet density of the olefin polymers is determined by the displacement method, employing the Archimedes principle, as described in ASTM-D-792.  The solvent used is iso-propyl alcohol.<br>
Gel counts are determined on a 5 square meter (m2) sample of the film, using a Model FS-3 gel counter, available from OCS GmbH (Germany).  The counter comprises a digital scanning camera, a lighting source and computer with software to conduct the count.  The gel counts are reported as the number of gels per m2 of film.<br>
In order to prepare the film sample for gel count testing, a sample of the ethylene polymer composition to be tested, is first stabilized, such as, by blending with 2500 ppm Irganox B-215 (available from Ciba-Geigy) and 1000 ppm calcium stearate.  The blending is carried out under relatively mild conditions to prevent significant change in the gel number during blending.  A twin screw co-rotating extruder {model MP19TC, available from APV Baker Industrial Extruders Division, United Kingdom) is used for this purpose, and is equipped with two 19 mm diameter screws, each with a screw length to screw diameter ratio (L/D-ratio) of 40:1. The extruder is operated with a temperature profile of 190Â°C<br><br>
to 210Â°C,  at 3 kg/hr, and a screw speed of 300 rpm.  No screen pack is used, and a nitrogen purge on the feed hopper is used to reduce the oxygen content.<br>
A cast film of 50 micrometer thickness is then produced by extrusion of the stabilized composition.   The film extrusion is carried out on a Haake Rheomex model Rheodrive-3000, type 250, a " Â¼-inch" extruder (available from Haake Mess-Technik GmbH, Germany), equipped with three heat zones (temperature profile 190Â°C to 210Â°C), equipped with a standard " Â¼-inch" screw (Type Rheomex 252 from Haake Mess-Technik GmbH), having an L/D-ratio of 25 and a compression ratio 3:1, and a flat sheet die (available from OCS GmbH, Germany) of "10 cm width" and 0.5 mm die gap.  The film extrusion train includes a haul-off unit (model QCS CR-8 available from OCS GmbH, Germany), which is equipped with guiding rolls and a chill roll operated at 7 5Â°C, with automatic tension control at 5.5 Newton (N).<br>
Example 1<br>
a) Preparation of the solid catalyst precursor.<br>
The solid catalyst precursor was prepared essentially according to the process described in example 1 parts (a) and (b) of US 5,290,745, incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference.<br>
The solid catalyst precursor was prepared in two stages. First, a slurry was produced, and then the slurry was spray dried to obtain the solid catalyst precursor.<br>
The titanium trichloride catalyst component was prepared in a vessel equipped with pressure and temperature control, and a turbine agitator.  A nitrogen atmosphere ( 
Granulated magnesium metal, having a particle size of 0.1 mm to 4 mm, was added, under nitrogen, to an excess of<br><br>
tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of 502C, such that the weight ratio of magnesium to tetrahydrofuran was 1:800. Minor amounts of triethylaliuminum were added to scavenge moisture in the solvent.  Typically, a 0.01 to 0.02 molar amount (based on THF) was added.  Titanium (IV) chloride was added to the mixture in a mole ratio of magnesium to titanium of 1:2.<br>
The mixture was continuously agitated.  The exotherm resulting from the addition of titanium tetrachloride caused the temperature of the mixture to rise to approximately 72Â°C over a period of three hours.  The temperature was held at 70Â°C by heating for approximately another four hours.  At the end of this time, magnesium dichloride was added, so that the ratio of magnesium to titanium in the mixture rises to 5:1, and heating was continued at 70Â° C for another eight hours. The mixture was then filtered through a 100 micron (\im) filter to remove undissolved magnesium dichloride and unreacted magnesium.<br>
CAB-O-SIL TS-610 fumed silica (available from Cabot Corporation) was then added, under nitrogen, to the filtered mixture, over a period of two hours; the resulting slurry being stirred by means of a turbine agitator for several hours thereafter, to thoroughly disperse the fumed silica. The resulting slurry was spray dried using an 8-foot diameter closed cycle spray dryer equipped with a rotary atomizer. The rotary atomizer was adjusted to give catalyst particles with a D50 of 8.6 Âµm.  The scrubber section of the spray dryer was maintained at approximately - 4Â°C.  The recycle gas flow rate is in the range of 15-25 kg gas per kg of slurry feed.<br>
Nitrogen gas was introduced into the spray dryer at an inlet temperature of 150Â°C to 160Â°C, and was circulated at a rate of approximately 1700 kg/hour.  The catalyst slurry was fed to the spray dryer at a temperature of 3 5Â°C and a rate of<br><br>
90-95 kg/hour,or sufficient to yield an outlet gas temperature of approximately 110Â°C to 120Â°C.  The atomization speed was adjusted as required to achieve the desired particle size.  The atomization pressure was slightly above atmospheric.<br>
The discrete catalyst particles prepared above were mixed with mineral oil under a nitrogen atmosphere in a 400 liter vessel equipped with a turbine agitator to form a slurry. Component amounts are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
iO  b) Preparation of the ethylene polymer composition.<br>
The ethylene polymer composition was prepared in a multi-stage process consisting of two stirred-tank reactors in series, each having a volume of 10 liter, and operated at<br><br>
a liquid level of 70 percent.  The reactors were each equipped with a mixing blade which is operated at 1000 revolutions per minute.<br>
A stream, comprising hexane diluent, tri-n-butylaluminium and the solid catalyst precursor described above, was fed continuously to the first reactor at a rate of 1.8 kilograms per hour (kg/hr).<br>
Ethylene was also fed continuously to the first reactor, at a rate of 0.85 kg/hr, and hydrogen, at a rate of 6.8 grams per hour.  The absolute pressure in the first reactor was maintained at 13 bar, by adjusting the feed rate of the ethylene.  The melt flow rate of the ethylene polymer composition, MI2, is adjusted by changing the flow rate of hydrogen.  The temperature in the first reactor was maintained by means of jacket cooling to a temperature of 80Â°C.<br>
The ethylene polymer composition formed.in the first reactor was transferred continuously to the second reactor. In the second reactor, ethylene was fed continuously at a rate of 1.3 kg/hr, and 1-butene is added at a rate of 0.13 0 kg/hr, to control the density of the polymer in the second reactor at a target of 0.951 g/cm3.  The absolute pressure in the second reactor was maintained at 7 bar by adjusting the feed rate of the ethylene.  The melt index of the polymer composition leaving the second reactor was controlled by venting the gas phase of the second reactor.<br>
The ethylene polymer composition leaving the second reactor was continuously fed to a flash drum maintained at 1.3 bar and 70Â°C, in which the volatile material was flashed off to leave a dry ethylene polymer composition powder.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Example 2 was conducted in the same procedure as described in Example 1, except that median particle size of the catalyst is 10.3 micrometers.  The resulting ethylene polymer composition has a low gel content.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
The ethylene polymer composition of comparative Example 1 was obtained using a solid catalyst precursor particle size, D50 of 14.7 micrometers.  Compared to Examples 1 and 2, the ethylene polymer composition of Comparative Example 1 contains a considerable numbers of gels.<br>
Table 2 is a summary of the characteristics of ethylene polymer compositions produced by the method of the present invention in Examples 1 and 2, as well as of an ethylene polymer composition, produced by a method not within the scope of the present invention, in Comparative Example.<br><br><br><br>
precursor particles with a mean diameter as listed in Table 3, and b) an organoaluminium compound tri-n-butylaluminium in a molar ratio Al/Ti = 50.  The solid catalyst precursor satisfied the relationship:  2 â¥ (D90- B10) / D50, where D50 is the median particle diameter, D10 and D90 are described as above.<br>
Bimodal polyethylene was prepared in a commercial 2-reactor cascade slurry process, using the following reaction conditions listed in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
For Example 3 and 4, the bimodal powder obtained, was compounded on a Coperion W&amp;P 160 mm twin screw extruder, with 1000 ppm calcium stearate and 870 ppm Irganox B225.  Example 5 was obtained by extruding the bimodal powder on a twin screw extruder Leistritz ZSE-65 with 1000 ppm calcium stearate, 600 ppm Irganox 1010 and 1500 ppm Irgafos 168.<br>
All comparative examples are commercially available resins.<br>
Samples were compression molded according to ASTM 47 03-02 Procedure.c.  A "3-point flexural Young's modulus" was measured on an Instron apparatus, according to ISO 178.  The "3-point flexural Young's modulus" is a measure of the stiffness of the sample.  Densities and 3-point flexural Young's module are listed in Table 4.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the "3-point flexural Young's modulus" is unexpectedly high compared to the moduli of different HDPE resins (labeled as Comparative Examples). Moreover, when the densities of the resins are compared, the inventive resins show a much higher *3-point flexural Young's module."<br>
The following equations can be used to rank the resins based on the "3-point flexural Young's modulus" and density properties, where<br>
F = 3-point flexural Young's modulus (MPa),<br>
p = density (g/cm3), and<br>
al, a2 and a3 are each a coefficient.<br>
F &gt; 1340*{l-exp [-235*(p - 0.9451)]}     (Eqn. 1) F &gt; 1355*{l-exp [-235*(p - 0.9448)]}     (Eqn. 2)<br>
The inventive resins can be described by 'Eqn. 1," which is represented by the lower, solid line (or profile) on Figure 1.  More preferred inventive resins are described by<br><br>
'Eqn. 2," which is represented by the upper, dashed line (or profile) on Figure 1.<br><br><br><br><br>
