Prof Maheshwar Sharon, an Indian national, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Powai, Mumbai - 400076, Maharashtra, India<br>
The foBowing specific^on partictdaily describes	the nature of this	<br>
invention and the mann^ in wliicli it is to be ponned :<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an environment and user friendly and efficient method and formulation for cleaning cloths.<br>
Cloths may be cotton or synthetic or blends thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Stains on clodis are mostly organic in nature and are due to sweai or materials such as dyes, inks, paints, pigments, turmenc, coffee or tea. Cleaning agents such as detergentsand/ble^hing compounds such as chloro compounds are generdly used to wash cloths. Such cleaning agents convert stains into water soluble materials which tend to remain within the cloths unless properly rinsed out. They are effective in removing dirt and dust particles but not very effective in removing fast stains for imtance sweat stains on the coHats of shirts and such other garments. Non-so£^ detergents and bleaching compounds do not easily degrade biochemicaD.y and pollute the atmosphere and are not environment friendly.<br><br>
The cloths dso require physical handling like rubbing or beating during washing by hand. Therefore, washing with detergents is cumbersome and inconvenient and also time consuming. Some of the non-soap detergents and bleaching compounds are also ^ergic and not user fiiendly.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an environment and user fiiendly and efficient method of cleaning cloths, which eliminates use of polluting and allergic non-soap detergents and bleaching compounds and is very effective in the removal of fast stains.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an environment and user friendly and efficient method of cleaiing cloths, which is simple, easy and convenient to cany out and is less time consuming.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an environment and user friendly and efficient method of cleaning cloths, which is suit^le and economicai fox coramerciaiisadon.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an environment and user fiiendly and efficient cleaning fonnulation for cloths which eliminates use of poUuting and aJletgic non-soap detergents and bleaching compounds and which is very effective in the removd of fast stans.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an environment and user fiiendly and efficient cleaning fomiulsiion for cloths which renders w££hing simpK easy and convenient and less time consuming.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an environment and user fiiendly and efficient cleaning fonnulation for cloths which is suit^le and economic^ for canying out washing £tit a commerciahsation scale.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided an environment and user fiiendly and efficient method of cleaning cloths comprising<br><br>
plying soap and ceramic oxide of nano-size particles in the weight ratio 99; 1 followed by irradiation of the cloths with UV light.<br>
According  to   the   invention   thfere   iisJM^ environment and user Mendly and efficient cleaning formulation for cloths comprising so£^ and ceramic oxide of nano size particles in the weight ratio 99:1.<br>
The ceramic oxide forms an electrically chffl[ged l^er at the iiiterfs^e between the stained cloths and so£^ solution. On irradiating the stained cloths with UV hght, photogenerated electrons and holes are formed at the interface. The photo^nerated holes are strong oxidising ager^ asid oxidise the stains into gases such ss CO2 and water soluble imnerd acid salts such as hydrochloric acid salts which may be easily rinsed out. The gases escaepe  into the atmosphere on their own and need no separation.<br>
The ceramic oxide is, for exsmphy titanium dioxide (Ti02) zinc oxide (ZnO), iron oxide (Fe203)or tungsten oxide (WO3) preferably Ti02 or ZnO. Ceramic oxides upto paiticle sizes 60 x 10-8cm are known as nano<br><br>
size particles. Ceramic oxides of bigger particles sizes have been found to be unsuitable for the invention.<br>
The UV hght may be from sunli^ or UV li^ source. Durettion of irradiation depends on the nature and surface area of stain. Typically for a 15 watt UV hght, an irradiation period of 20 to 30 minutes is required. Dur^on of irradiation may be reduced by increasing the intensity of the UV light. If the cleaning is carded out in a washing machine, the UV light source is fiitted in the washing machine and operated by the control panel thereof.<br>
According to the invention stains are removed by converting them into gases and water soluble mineral acid salts. Due to this two way removal of stains all types of stains are effectively eliminated. Non¬biodegradable and polluting and aJlexgy causing non-so^ detergents and bleaching compounds are abo eliminated. SOE^J is completely biodegradable and non-polluting and non-aUergic. Ceramic oxides are biocompatible. Therefore, both the method and formulation of the invention me efficient in stain removal mid me environment and user<br><br>
fiiendly. The method is also simple, easy and convenient to cany out and less time consuming due to the fact that after irradiation with UV li^t the cloths are simply rinsed wifli water completely free of the stains. The formulation also rendeiB washing simple, easy and convenient and less time consuming. Both the method and formulation are suitable and economical for commercial expbitation because ceramic oxide and UV light are available in abundance and are cheap.<br>
The   following   experimental   examples   are<br>
illustrative of the invention but not limitative of the scope thereof.<br><br>
Example 1 Shirts (iO) sweat stained and yellow coloured at the collars and axmpit areas were soaked in a soap solution with water containing 10 gm of a washing soap and 0.1 gm of titanium dioxide of nano-size particles (P25, Degussa, Germany) added one after the other. The shirts were exposed to sunlight for 30 minutes and simply rinsed with water 3 times.   The shirts were completely<br>
free from the sweat stains.<br>
Example 2 Towels (10) stained with violet ink used in ink<br><br>
pad (Camel, Camlin Ltd) were soaked in a soap solution with water containing lOgmof washing soap and 0.1 gm of titanium dioxide of nano-size particles (P25, Degussa, Germany) added one after the other. The towels were irradiated with a 15 watt UV lamp for 20 minutes and simply rinsed with water 3 times. The towels were completely free from the ink stains.<br>
Example 3<br>
Towels (10) stained witli scarlet red writing ink (Camel, Camlin Ltd) were soaked in a soap solution with<br><br>
water containing 10 gm of a washing soap and 0.1 gm of zinc oxide of nano-size particles (P25, Degussa, Germany) added one after the other. The towels were irradiated with a 15 watt UV lamp for 30 minutes and simply rinsed with water 3 times. The towels were completely free from the ink stains.<br>
Example 4<br>
Towels (10) stained with turmeric powder were soaked in a soap solution with water containing 10 gm of a washing soap and 0.1 gm of zinc oxide of nano-size<br><br>
particles (Aldrich, USA) added one after the other. The towels were irradiated with a 15 watt UV lamp for 30 minutes and simply rinsed with water 3 times. The towels were completely free from the turmeric stains.<br>
Example 5<br>
Towels (10) stained with red   dye ("ALTA"),<br>
were soaked in a soap solution with water containing 10<br>
gmofa washing soap and 0.1 gm of titanium dioxide of<br>
nano-size particles (P255 Degussa Germany) added one<br>
after the other. The towels were irradiated with a 15 watt<br>
UV lamp for 30 minutes and simply rinsed with water 3<br><br>
times.   The towels were completely free from the dye<br>
stains.<br>
Example 6<br>
Towels (10) stained with coflFee were soaked in a soap solution with water containing 10 gm of a washing soap and 0.1 gm of zinc oxide of nano-size particles (Aldrich, USA) added one after the other. The towels were exposed to a 15 watt UV lamp for 30 minutes and simply rinsed witii water 3 times. The towels were completely free from the coffee stains.<br><br>
