FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention pertains to a device for position-precise alignment of containers.<br>
The invention further relates to a labelling machine with such a device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In containers and particularly bottles that have typical geometric container<br>
features on their outer surface, e.g. seal surface, ornament, embossing, raised<br>
lettering etc., it is necessary to apply the labels with high application precision<br>
with respect to these container features. This means that in a labelling machine<br>
to which the containers are fed in an upright position but in a purely random<br>
alignment or orientation, these containers have to initially be aligned in such a<br>
way that they have a pre-given orientation as precisely as possible with respect<br>
to their container features. Only then can be at least one label be applied on the<br>
respective container and subsequently pressed on and/or brushed on to it.<br>
It is known that for this alignment on a rotor of a labelling machine container<br>
holders in the form of turntables are foreseen that can be rotated in a controlled<br>
manner with own setting drives around a vertical axis and hence also around the<br>
axis of a respective container arranged on the container support. It is also<br>
especially known that the control of the container holders for alignment should<br>
be taken up by an image identification system or camera system, with which the<br>
respective position or orientation of at least one of the typical geometric<br><br>
container features used for the alignment is determined as actual value and then<br>
to compare it in an electronic system with stored image data or values<br>
representing the desired value, and from that the necessary control of the<br>
setting drive of container holders for the required position correction is activated<br>
(EP 1 205 388). In a design version of the known device the camera system has<br>
four cameras that are successively arranged along the movement path of the<br>
container holders in rotation direction of the rotor. Each camera scanned<br>
respectively one portion of the circumference of the container and that too<br>
overlapping 100° of this circumference in case of containers rotating around<br>
their container axis. On the basis of the actual image data, a rotation position<br>
correction of the container holders and alignment of the containers with respect<br>
to their typical geometric container features can be taken up.<br>
EP 1205388 (A1) disclose device for controlling the rotational movement of<br>
containers. According to the invention, each bottle (6) rests on a platform (4)<br>
rotatable by a stepper motor (8) and held by a transfer holder (5) on a turnable<br>
(3). During attachment of the label the platform is locked in position by a cam<br>
(9) driven peg (11), slidable in a fixture (10) on the turntable.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the task of this invention to present a device with which an alignment of<br>
containers with respect to at least one typical geometric container feature is<br>
possible with a significantly improved degree of precision and also with a high<br><br>
capacity, i.e. for a large number of containers to be processed per unit of time.<br>
This task is fulfilled with a device according to the features of the invention. A<br>
labeling machine is the other object of the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the device as per the invention, with the image data of a first camera system<br>
a pre-alignment of the containers takes place in such a way that after pre-<br>
alignment they at least somewhat precisely conform to the required orientation,<br>
particularly also with respect to their geometric container features used for the<br>
alignment, and that too with a degree of precision that cannot be attained with<br>
known devices. With this first camera system the testing range, i.e. the<br>
circumference range of the respective container where the at least one<br>
geometric container feature can be found, is determined over a large area.<br>
With the image data of at least another camera system a more precise and<br>
eventually also final alignment of each container takes place. As the container<br>
region scanned by the at least one camera of the at least one additional camera<br>
system is much smaller than the area to be scanned by the at least one camera<br>
of the first camera system, i.e. the at least one camera of the additional camera<br>
system for example has a much smaller aperture angle than the at least one<br>
camera of the first camera system, alignment can take place very precisely<br>
within a very extremely short period of time by which the image data supplied by<br>
the at least one additional camera system.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is described below in details on the basis of diagrams of design<br>
examples. The following are shown:<br>
Figure 1 - In schematic depiction a labelling machine of the circulating type;<br>
Figure 2-7 - Different depiction for explaining the algorithm while calculating the<br>
rotation angle of the container holders required for correction of<br>
the orientation.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The labelling machine shown in figure 1 and generally referred to there with the<br>
sign 1 serves the purpose of labelling containers 2, e.g. bottles that are fed to<br>
the labelling machine at a container inlet 3 and leaving the labelling machine 1 in<br>
labelled condition at the container outlet 4. The containers 2 are for example<br>
bottles made of translucent material, e.g. glass, and are provided on their<br>
container outer side with at least one typical geometric container feature, e.g.<br>
seal surface, ornament, embossing, raised letterings etc. The containers 2 are<br>
supposed to be provided with labels with a high degree of application precision<br>
with respect to these geometric features.<br>
The labelling machine 1 consists of, among other things a driven turntable or<br><br>
rotor 5 circulating around a vertical machine axis in the direction of the arrow A,<br>
which has at its circumference several container carriers or container holders 6,<br>
which are arranged distributed at uniform angular distances around the vertical<br>
machine axis and on which respectively a container 3 is foreseen with its<br>
container axis parallel to the vertical machine axis for applying the labels.<br>
The containers 2 are fed to the labelling machine 1 at the container inlet 3<br>
through a transporting mechanism (not shown) in an upright position, i.e. with<br>
their container axis oriented in vertical direction, but otherwise in a purely<br>
random orientation also with respect to their typical geometric container<br>
features; they are then passed on in this purely random orientation to a<br>
container holder 6 and subsequently aligned in an angular region W1 of the<br>
rotation movement A of the rotor 5, so that each container 3 at the end of this<br>
angular region is exactly aligned with respect to its typical geometric container<br>
features, i.e. has a pre-given orientation. In this condition each container 2 is<br>
passed through a labelling station 7 moving along with the rotor 5 for applying at<br>
least one label, so that this can then be applied on the respectively container 2<br>
with the endeavoured high degree of application precision with respect to the<br>
geometric container features. In the angular region W2 of the rotation<br>
movement A of the rotor 5 following the labelling station 7 till the container<br>
outlet 3, the usual pressing on and/or brushing on of the labels take place.<br>
For aligning the containers 2, the container holders 6 are rotate-able through<br>
own setting drivers around an axis parallel to the vertical machine axis, and<br><br>
controlled by a multi-stage image identification system with several electronic<br>
cameras 9-11 explained in more details below and having an evaluation and<br>
control electronics system 12 preferably in the form of a computer.<br>
In the shown design form the cameras 8-11 that do not move along with the<br>
rotor 5 are arranged radial outside the movement path of the container holder 6<br>
in such a way that with each camera the passing containers 2 are scanned at<br>
least in the testing range or in the region of its container outer surface revealing<br>
the typical geometric container features. Furthermore, all the cameras 8 - 11 are<br>
situated within the angular region W1 and hence in rotation direction A before<br>
the labelling station 7.<br>
In details, both cameras 8 and 9 that are arranged in a part region of the<br>
angular region W1 following on to the container inlet 3, form a first stage of the<br>
image identification system along with a white background or a wide background<br>
element 13 forming a background mirror that does not move along with the rotor<br>
5, and which is arranged in the depicted design form radial inwards and lying<br>
opposite to both cameras 8 and 9 with respect to the circular movement path of<br>
the container holders 6, as well as along with a foreground lighting indicated by<br>
the arrow B1. Both the cameras 8 and 9 are arranged with their optical axes at<br>
an angle to one another in such a way that they can scan a circumference region<br>
or a range greater than 180° of the respective passing container 2. The images<br>
or image data supplied by both cameras 8 and 9 are combined for this purpose<br>
to a total image or a total data set that corresponds to a picture of the traversed<br>
path or the container circumference region of greater than 180°.<br><br>
The first stage of the image identification system is followed by the second stage<br>
of this system formed by the single camera 10. The camera 10 is again allocated<br>
with a white background or a background element forming a white background<br>
mirror corresponding to the element 13, and in the depicted design form lying<br>
radial inwards with respect to the movement path of the container holder 6. This<br>
second stage further has foreground lighting, as indicated by the arrow B2.<br>
Obviously the elements 13 and 14 of the first and second stage can also be<br>
formed by a single, continuous element. Furthermore, the foreground lighting for<br>
both stages can also be made up of one or more common light sources, e.g.<br>
fluorescent screens. Basically it holds good that in relation to the optical<br>
properties of the containers, for the foreground lighting a lighting technology is<br>
selected that allows an optimum detection of the container features used for<br>
alignment of the containers. Furthermore, by giving a special shape to the<br>
background element 13 and/or 14, e.g. by partially blackening the white<br>
background element 13 and/or 14, one can achieve an increased optical<br>
detection of edge profiles of the container features use for the alignment.<br>
Following the second stage (camera 10) in rotation direction A is the third stage<br>
of the image detection system consisting of the single camera 11, with a<br>
background lighting B3 provided for example by a fluorescent screen that does<br>
not move along with the rotor 5 and on the side of the movement path of the<br>
container holder 6 lying opposite to the camera 11. The background lighting B3<br>
is selected or can be adjusted for a minimum possible optimum optical detection<br>
with respect to colour and/or intensity in relation to the optical properties of the<br>
containers 2 or the container material and/or in relation to the optical properties<br>
of the filling substance.<br><br>
In details, alignment of the containers 2 with the image identification system<br>
takes place in such a way that with the first stage or with both the cameras 8<br>
and 9 placed there the respective random orientation of the passing container 2<br>
is detected with one picture per container and camera 8 or 9. By subsequent<br>
comparison of the images or image data supplied by both camera systems 8 and<br>
9 in the electronic system with the images or image data or typical values stored<br>
there in a data storage, the actual orientation of the respective container 2 at<br>
that movement is determined in the electronic system 12; from that the<br>
necessary correction for achieving the required pre-alignment is determined and<br>
the correction is carried out by corresponding control of the setting drive of the<br>
respective container holder 6.<br>
For each individual container 2 the position correction is carried out in a<br>
described manner through control of the container holder 6, so that each<br>
container 2 is at least aligned with a position precision that allows subsequent<br>
exact determination of the position of the at least one typical container feature<br>
used for final alignment.<br>
In the second stage of the image identification system formed by the camera 10<br>
each passing container 2 is scanned in a narrower region of its typical geometric<br>
container feature. For this, the lens of the camera is design in such a way that<br>
the optical aperture angle of the camera 10 is lesser than the corresponding<br>
aperture angle of the cameras 8 and 9 and the region of the respective container<br>
revealing the typical geometric container feature is imaged in a format-filling<br><br>
manner. The thus generated image from each container 2 is again compared in<br>
the electronic system 12 with an image stored there for the concerned container<br>
type or with characteristic values stored for the concerned container type; from<br>
this the necessary position correction is determined and carried out by<br>
corresponding control of the setting drive of the respective container holder 6.<br>
With the help of the image region reduced to the typical container feature, with<br>
the second stage of the image identification system, already a very highly precise<br>
alignment of each container 2 is attained that is also vastly improved with<br>
respect to the pre-alignment (with the first stage).<br>
With the camera 11 forming the third stage a fine-tuning or fine-alignment of<br>
each container 2 is then done before it reaches the labelling station 7. As criteria<br>
for this fine-alignment at least one edge profile or at least one typical edge point<br>
is used, and that too for at least one typical container feature and/or in the<br>
region of this container feature used for alignment. The image data supplied by<br>
the camera 11 is again compared in the electronic system 12 with the image<br>
data stored there for the respective container type or with the characteristic<br>
values stored there for the respective container type, so that from this<br>
comparison the necessary position correction can be calculated and taken up by<br>
means of corresponding control of the setting drive of the concerned container<br>
holder.<br>
By means of the above described three-stage optical detection of the containers<br>
2 or the typical container features a very precise alignment of the containers fed<br><br>
to the labelling machine 1 in random orientation or positioning is achieved with<br>
only four cameras, before these reach the labelling station 7, so that the<br>
endeavoured application precision while applying the labels is ensured with<br>
respect to the typical geometric container feature with a high degree of reliability<br>
and also a very high capacity for the labelling machine, e.g. for a labelling<br>
capacity of several 10,000 containers per hour.<br>
The details of an algorithm, as it is used in at least one of these stages of the<br>
image identification system for determining the necessary correction, are<br>
explained below. In order to carry out a precise identification of the rotation<br>
angle with a precision of at least one degree, the cylindrical geometry of the<br>
bottle surface has to be taken into account. For known holder-geometry<br>
(distance of a camera to the bottle, diameter of a bottle) and known geometry of<br>
the embossing sample, from the calculation shown in the appendix one can<br>
calculate for each rotation angle of the bottle (e.g. in 0.5 degree stages), as to<br>
how the embossing sample gets distorted for an observer (=camera) on the<br>
bottle surface. These calculated distorted embossing samples must now be<br>
compared with the observed embossing sample on a taken-up bottle. The<br>
calculated embossing sample that matches closest to the observed sample then<br>
determines the rotation angle of the bottle.<br>
Figure 2 shows as example a typical container feature of an embossing sample<br>
16 on a bottle in almost frontal view. The bottle edge as well as the bottle centre<br>
is marked with a thin vertical red line. This frontal view is allocated as the<br><br>
rotation angle zero degrees. One naturally defines the zero point of the rotation<br>
angle on the basis of the symmetry of the embossing sample (i.e. "in the centre<br>
of the embossing sample"). Along the horizontal test line 17 those points are<br>
given as 17.1 - 17.7 at which the embossing intersects the test line 17. These<br>
points are referred to below as embossing points.<br>
With the variable Xj the seen position of an embossing point in a scanned image<br>
is denoted and Zj denotes the world coordinates on the bottle surface. The<br>
running index i numbers the individual embossing points.<br>
Figure 3 shows the same embossing sample, where the bottle has been twisted<br>
by 24° to the left. Even in this picture the embossing points are marked. On<br>
account of twisting the bottle the position and distances of the embossing points<br>
17.1 - 17.7 have characteristically changed. For example, on account of the<br>
perspective distortion on the cylindrical bottle body the visible distance between<br>
two adjacent embossing points that have got closure to the left bottle edge is<br>
reduced as compared to the untwisted position. In case of a stronger distortion<br>
parts of the embossing sample would disappear behind the bottle horizon.<br>
A geometric calculation according to fig. 5 leads to the formulas (1) and (2).<br><br><br>
Here R gives the bottle radius and d the distance of the camera from the bottle<br>
center.<br>
With these formulas it is possible to convert the seen position Xi of embossing<br>
point 17.1 - 17.7 into world coordinates Zi on the bottle surface and vice versa.<br>
In order to be able to calculate the exact distribution of the embossing points<br>
17.1 - 17.7 along a horizontal test line 17 to a random rotation angle of the<br>
bottle, the position zi of all embossing points 17.1 - 17.7 on the bottle surface<br>
for a known rotation angle (e.g. for zero degrees) has to be known with respect<br>
to the symmetry axis (= zero point) of the embossing samples. The position Zi of<br>
an embossing point is defined by the distance of the seen bottle centre<br>
measured along the bottle surface.<br>
Studying an embossing sample for the identification algorithm is thereby made<br>
much simpler. As one can see clearly in figure 2 and 3 through the embossing<br>
points 17.1 - 17.7, a user guidance can be executed in a computer programme,<br>
in which a user can mark the crossing points of the embossing sample with a<br>
test line 17. With the help of the formula (2) the clicked monitor functions Xi can<br>
immediately be converted into world coordinates Zi on the bottle surface. Thus<br>
the user can make the embossing sample available to the algorithm in the form<br>
of a list of embossing points 17.1 - 17.2. Once the embossing points zi have<br>
been determined in world coordinates for an embossing sample then it can be<br>
converted for any rotation angle of the bottle by the formula (1) in reverse<br>
direction in the seen positions Xi. The identification algorithm can thus calculate<br><br>
the seen positions Xi (ϕ) for the given embossing sample for all possible rotation<br>
angles ϕ. In practice, it has proved to be useful that the identification algorithm<br>
carries out this calculation for all rotation angles ϕk with an angular distance of<br>
0.25 degrees, i.e. fa = 0.25 degrees *k with k = 0.±1, ±2, ±3, .... For each<br>
angle fa the algorithm can retain the allied distribution of the seen positions Xi<br>
(ϕk) in the memory and does not have to calculate afresh for the sample search<br>
in the next bottle with same embossing sample. This can save a lot of computing<br>
time.<br>
As a next step the algorithm must decide, which distribution Xi (ϕk) is best suited<br>
for the situation observed in the image. For this a method is used that allocates<br>
an evaluation number (score) to each distribution Xi (ϕk). This score is construed<br>
in such a way that it is greater, the better the observed situation suits a<br>
distribution. The maximum score SkMax that is reached for a given image situation<br>
thus determines the rotation angle ϕkmax of the bottle.<br>
For calculating a score, the brightness graph H(x) is determined along the test<br>
line 17 (fig. 6). Here x denotes the pixel position along the horizontal test profile.<br>
In such a brightness profile embossing points become conspicuous through clear<br>
brightness fluctuations on a linear scale that approximately corresponds to the<br>
width of an embossing point. These brightness fluctuations are however<br>
superimposed by other brightness fluctuations that take place on a clearly<br>
greater linear scale and can thus be separated from the brightness fluctuation<br>
caused by embossing points in the following way: From the brightness profile<br>
H(x) one calculates a brightness profile HAve(x) that is glazed on a linear scale<br>
that clearly lies above the width of an embossing point. This glazed brightness<br><br>
profile HAve(x) is subtracted from the original brightness profile H(x) and one<br>
observes only the values of the differences, i.e.<br><br>
Regions in which there are no embossing points then reveal very small values<br>
Hsub(x), whereas one can find high values on an embossing point. By selecting a<br>
suitable threshold value, the locations bi of the embossing points can be<br>
identified in the given image in this way.<br>
The score Sk for a distribution of the seen positions Xi(ϕk) is then calculated in the<br>
following way:<br>
The point pair bi and Xi with the least distant is searched for. If this distance is<br>
lesser than a pre-given maximum distance d, then the found point pair is<br>
evaluated as suitable, i.e. it is accepted that the position of the embossing point<br>
bi found in the image matches a position of the embossing sample to the bottle<br>
twist ϕk. In this case a bonus contribution is added to the score Sk. As the<br>
embossing samples of different bottles are never all absolutely exactly the same,<br>
the bottle geometry as well as the bottle position to the camera is subjected to<br>
fluctuations during imaging, one can never assume an exact matching of a point<br>
pair bi and Xi. Therefore, through the maximum distance d it is demanded that<br>
the points have to lie sufficiently close together. If a point pair has been found in<br>
this way, then these are marked in an internal list of the algorithm as already<br>
allocated. For the remaining points the procedure is repeated till all possible<br><br>
points have either been allocated or till all points have been identified as not-<br>
allocate-able (i.e. for a point bi no model point Xi has been found that lies<br>
sufficiently close).<br>
If no corresponding points bi have been found for model points Xi, then for this<br>
Malus's contributions are deducted from the score.<br>
Figure 7 shows for the example shown in figure 3 the relation of the score Sk in<br>
relation to the angle. One can identify that there is a sharp maximum at<br>
approximately 24 degrees, i.e. the seen point sample bi best corresponds to the<br>
point sample Xi for a bottle rotation angle of -24 degrees.<br>
The invention has been described above on the basis of a design example. It is<br>
obvious that numerous alterations and deviations are possible without deviating<br>
from the basic concept of the invention. Thus it was mentioned above that the<br>
first stage of the image identification system has two cameras 8 and 9 and the<br>
second or third stage respectively have only one camera 10 or 11. The number<br>
of cameras in these stages can obviously also be selected differently, whereby it<br>
is however necessary and at least purpose-oriented if the camera system of the<br>
first stage detects as large a circumference area of the respective passing<br>
container 2 as possible.<br>
In the shown design form the cameras 8, 9, 10 and 11 are designed or activated<br>
in such a way that for each passing container 2 an image or image data set is<br>
complied and then on the basis of this image data set the pre-alignment (in the<br>
first stage), the pre-adjustment (in the second stage) and the fine-adjustment (in<br>
the third stage) take place by comparing with the respective image data.<br><br>
