				<td>AN APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS<br>
DISCHARGE OF PARTICULATE HOT DIRECT REDUCED<br>
IRON (DRI) AND PARTICULATE COLD DRI FROM<br>
A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF HOT DRI.<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No.60/150,036 filed on August 20, 1999.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a an apparatus and method for the<br>
simultaneous discharge of particulate hot direct reduced iron (DRI) and particulate<br>
cold DRI from a continuous supply of hot DRI, and particularly to a method and<br>
apparatus that simultaneously provides both hot and cold DRI (direct reduced iron)<br>
from a continuous gravity-fed supply of hot DRI material, as from a conventional<br>
direct reduction furnace.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The sponge iron, metallized pellets, briquettes, or reduced metal materials<br>
such as direct reduced iron ("DRI"), nickel, or the like, are produced by the direct<br>
reduction of ores or metal oxides. Large quantities of metallized iron pellets are<br>
made in the direct reduction process wherein particulate iron oxide is reduced<br>
substantially to metallic iron by direct contact with a reducing gas such as a mixture<br>
of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Throughout this specification and appended<br>
claims, the term "metallized pellets" is intended to include metal-bearing pellets such<br>
as sponge iron, briquettes, DRI, other compacted forms of reduced metal and the<br>
like which contain at least 80 percent of their metal in the<br>
metallic state with the balance being primarily in the form of metallic oxide. For these<br>
purposes, iron carbide is considered iron in the metallic state. "Metallized" in this<br>
specification does not mean coated with metal, but means nearly completely reduced to the<br>
metallic state. For ease of discussion and visualization., the majority of this specification<br>
will describe the invention as it relates to DRI, although it should be understood that the<br>
invention functions equally well with other forms of "metallized pellets" of any size, or any<br>
metal.<br>
A problem associated with the use of DRI as a raw material to make steel or other<br>
products is its inherent tendency to reoxidize upon exposure to air or water. Exposure of<br>
a mass of hot DRI to atmospheric air and moisture causes re-oxidation of the metal<br>
("rusting") with a significant loss of metallization. The re-oxidation also produces heat that<br>
can dramatically raise the temperature of a mass of DRI. The process of reoxidation also<br>
releases water-bound hydrogen into the immediate environment. Under proper conditions,<br>
hot DRI can ignite the liberated hydrogen resulting in additional heat, formation of<br>
additional hydrogen and possibly an explosion within transfer piping or within storage<br>
units.<br>
DRI must be removed from a direct reduction furnace in order to be useful.<br>
Methods are needed to transport DRI while reducing the risk of re-oxidation. One common<br>
method of reducing this risk of re-oxidation is to cool the hot DRI material to a sufficiently<br>
low temperature (less than about 100° C), to prevent the ignition of any hydrogen that is<br>
released by the oxidation process. One drawback to this method is that current DRI<br>
production systems are typically "all or nothing" propositions with respect to cooling.<br>
Either all of the hot DRI material exiting a particular fumace is cooled or none of it is<br>
cooled.<br>
A known method of transfer is the pneumatic transfer of hot DRI materials through<br>
piping from a fumace to an exterior storage unit. Drawbacks to this method include:<br>
extensive piping is required to transfer hot DRI through significant elevation changes, input<br>
of additional energy is required to the gases utilized in pneumatic transfer, additional<br>
opportunities are present for oxygen intake into transfer piping, and size reduction of hot<br>
DRI from nugget-size to particulate-size occurs during the transfer to remote storage units<br>
because of abrasion and impact.<br>
The present invention does not employ pneumatic transfer, and instead provides a<br>
method and apparatus for removing continuous output of hot DRI material from a direct<br>
reduction furnace and gravitationally transferring the output for subsequent processing or<br>
storage. The invention may simultaneously provide hot DRI material for subsequent steps<br>
such as melting or briquetting. The invention may also cool DRI material for transport,<br>
storage, or other use.<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is a system for providing both hot and cold DRI from a<br>
continuous gravity-fed supply of hot DRI material. The invention is an apparatus for<br>
the simultaneous discharge of hot direct reduced iron (DRI) material and cold DRI<br>
material from a continuous supply of hot DRI. The invention has a furnace discharge<br>
section, a hot discharge section, and a cold discharge section. The furnace<br>
discharge section has a pair of discharge outlets for discharging DRI material, and a<br>
plurality of feeders. The hot discharge section gravitationally receives hot DRI from<br>
the first discharge outlet of the hot discharge cone and conveys the hot DRI through<br>

section gravitationally receives hot DRI material from the other discharge outlet of<br>
the furnace discharge section, conveys the DRI to a cooler through a conduit cools<br>
the hot DRI, and discharges cold DRI.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention is an efficient apparatus and method to simultaneously provide both<br>
hot and cold DRI from a continuous gravity-fed supply of hot DRI material, as from a<br>
Midrex direct reduction shaft furnace. The invention satisfies the demand for both hot DRI<br>
material as a feed to a steelmaking process, and for cool DRI material as a storable<br>
commodity for eventual use in a fumace. The transport method thus used throughout this<br>
system is gravity, not pneumatics. Since the shaft furnace is elevated, it is possible to<br>
discharge into a lower elevation pellet cooler to produce cold DRI and into a lower<br>
elevation surge vessel to temporarily store the hot DRI for down stream processing (i.e., for<br>
briquetting, melting, etc.). This arrangement provides the unique flexibility for discharging<br>
both hot and cold DRI simultaneously. Furthermore, the discharge can be adjusted to<br>
produce 100% cold DRI or 100% hot DRI or any combination in between. These<br>
adjustments can be made instantaneously without any effect on the process.<br>
Because the present invention avoids the use of pneumatics there is minimal<br>
temperature loss of the hot DRI. In fact, hot DRI can be delivered from the surge vessel<br>
at a temperature of 700 °C or higher. There is also no loss in metallization since the entire<br>
system is sealed and DRI the product is only exposed to reducing or inert atmospheres.<br>
Gravity flow also results in negligible product degradation which cannot be avoided during<br>
pneumatic conveying. Unlike pneumatics, gravity flow can also handle a wide size range<br>
of product (as small as fines and as large as 200 mm).<br>
Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to Figure 1, the invented apparatus<br>
for the simultaneous discharge of hot direct reduced iron (DRI) material and cold DRI<br>
material from a continuous supply of hot DRI, such as a continuously discharging DRI<br>
furnace 10, includes a furnace discharge section 12, a hot discharge conduit 14, and a cold<br>
discharge conduit 16.<br>
Hot discharge furnace 10 is located above a pellet cooler 20 and above a hot DRI<br>
receiving vessel such as surge vessel 30. The furnace discharge section 12 is generally<br>
conical. The furnace discharge section 12 has an upper DRI admitting area 22 and a lower<br>
discharge region 24. The admitting area 22 receives DRI material from the furnace 10.<br>
The material is transported by gravity with the assistance of upper burden feeders 32,<br>
intermediate burden feeders 34, and lower burden feeders 36 to the discharge region 20.<br>
This embodiment can have a burden discharge feeder 38, if desired. The burden feeders<br>
are water cooled.<br>
The furnace discharge section 12 is a refractory lined cone. The cold DRI discharge<br>
rate is controlled by means of a vibratory feeder 26 at the discharge 28 of the pellet cooler<br>
20.<br>
The first discharge conduit 14 hermetically connects the furnace discharge section<br>
12 to the hot DRI receiving vessel 30. The second discharge 16 connects the furnace<br>
discharge section 12 to the pellet cooler 20.<br>
Hot discharge conduit 14 is a seal leg having associated degassing and depressurising<br>
apparatus. Hot DRI material may be conveyed by the first discharge conduit 24 to a<br>
melting furnace. The embodiments of Figure 2 connects the hot discharge conduit to an<br>
electric arc furnace (EAF). However, the invention will work with any melting furnace of<br>
sufficient capacity. In addition, the hot DRI material can be transported to a melting<br>
furnace by insulated containers sometimes known as "milk cans", by mechanical<br>
conveyors, or the material can be passed through a briquetting machine to form briquettes<br>
for transport.<br>
The hot discharge conduit 14 is a sealing and conveying means that differs from the<br>
traditional lock hopper-type sealing and conveying means. The sealing and conveying<br>
means is a dynamic seal leg, which allows a single, low pressure surge vessel to be used<br>
as a receptacle instead of requiring redundant "lock hoppers", where a lock-hopper is a<br>
pressurized hopper often employed in pairs, where as one hopper is being filled with a<br>
pressurized DRI, an alternate hopper is being depressurized.<br>
The hot discharge conduit can discharge hot DRI into a surge bin or surge vessel 30<br>
for temporary storage. The surge bin or surge vessel 30 has an attached bubbler 56. The<br>
bubbler 56 provides an outlet for the seal gas and prevents over pressurization of the vessel<br>
30. The surge bin or surge vessel 40 has two discharge nozzles 38 that enable quick<br>
changeover of the hot transport vessels.<br>
The surge bin or surge vessel 30 is refractory lined. The surge bin or surge vessel<br>
30 has a discharge cone 40 which is preferably made from stainless steel to prevent<br>
bridging. A flow stimulator 44 is also located near the discharge of the surge vessel to<br>
prevent bridging.<br>
In the cold discharge portion of the apparatus, hot DRI material is conveyed<br>
through the cold discharge conduit 16 to a pellet cooler 20. The DRI material is cooled in<br>
the pellet cooler 20 and discharged into an appropriate vessel for storage. The cold<br>
discharge conduit 16 is also preferably a dynamic seal leg. The dynamic seal leg isolates<br>
the pellet cooler and the inlet of the hot DRI surge vessel which is important because<br>
dynamic seal legs eliminate the need for redundant high pressure vessels and feeders in the<br>
cooling section, thus reducing the capital investment as compared to that required for<br>
similar facilities.<br>
Gas (Seal gas) removed from the cooler pellet through two large offtakes 52 located on top<br>
of the cooler. DRI Discharge from the cooler is accomplished by a standard DRI discharge<br>
mechanism such as vibratory feeder 26. Preferably the discharge is via a dynamic seal leg<br>
58 beneath the discharge mechanism..<br>
In operation, hot DRI material passes from the furnace discharge section 12 through<br>
a sealing and conveying conduit 14 in which the hot DRI is degassed and depressurized.<br>
Both the hot discharge conduit 14 and the cold discharge conduit 16 are connected to the<br>
furnace discharge section 12. The product moves by gravity to the cooler (for cold DRI),<br>
to a hot transport vessel 60 or to a melting furnace 70 or 72 (for hot DRI).<br>
The hot DRI material that is transported to a melting furnace or a hot transport<br>
vessel moves from the direct reduction furnace through hot discharge conduit 14 which is<br>
a seal leg. The hot DRI material is conveyed from seal leg 14 to a surge bin or surge vessel<br>
6 or before discharge into a transport vessel melting furnace. The rate of discharge is<br>
controlled by the speed of a vertical feed screw 46 at the bottom of the conduit 16.<br>
The system is shown with hot transport vessel 60 on rails 64. Two 70- ton transport<br>
vessels can fully supply a charge for one EAF heat. Other transport methods such as a hot<br>
conveyor or a pneumatic conveyor can be also incorporated into the system.<br>
Hot DRI material that is to be cooled is transported through cold discharge conduit<br>
16, which may be a seal leg, into pellet cooler 20 in which the pellets are cooled.. The<br>
cooled DRI material are discharged by vibrator feeder 26 through a cold discharge cone 28.<br>
The discharge rate from the pellet cooler can be changed instantaneously without affecting<br>
the process so long as the discharge rate of the furnace remains constant- The rate of<br>
discharge is set by a control system.<br>
ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The surge vessel arrangement can have various configurations. The surge vessel can<br>
be attached to a briquetter. In the configuration shown, a product discharge chamber or a<br>
similar device is required upstream to "screen-out" large size product, as is done in an HBI<br>
plant.<br>
The apparatus can also utilize a product discharge chamber or a similar device when<br>
the hot transport method from the DRI furnace to a meltshop is pneumatic conveying.<br>
Pneumatic conveying cannot transport large diameter material (i.e., greater than 200 mm).<br>
When the invention is attached to a conventional EAF, the vertical screw feeder on<br>
the inlet of the surge vessel dictates the furnace discharge rate in conjunction with the pellet<br>
cooler discharge feeder. When the invention is attached to a hot transport system or to a<br>
continuous melting furnace 70, only one screw feeder is required. Alternatively, screw<br>
feeders can be replaced by another device such as a wiper bar.<br>
When the invention is attached to a conventional EAF 72, a horizontal screw feeder<br>
74 is frequently utilized, which conveys discharged material from the surge vessel to the<br>
EAF or to a charging chute 76. The screw feeder 74 is used because the discharge rate<br>
from the surge vessel to the EAF is sporadic. The surge vessel is sized according to the<br>
desired EAF heat size.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE ACHIEVEMENT<br>
