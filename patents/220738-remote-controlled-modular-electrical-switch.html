3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Remote Control Operated Modular Switching System<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a remote control operated modular switching system. More particularly it relates to a remote control operated switching system to control the electrical appliances remotely while keeping an option of being operated manually or mechanically by conventional "ON" and "OFF" switching method by the same switching system. Further it relates to a remote control operated switching system to protect the electrical/electronic appliances from the initial current inrush, which results when power is first applied to a load having a low starting impedance.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
This is an era of the automation, and the people want everything to be controlled automatically by the remote controller. They need all the controls on their fingertip to control all electrical/electronic appliances. Current electrical switching system has only two positions "ON" and "OFF" and one need to go near the switch to operate the electrical /electronic appliances.<br>
Currently many Remote controlled systems to control electrical appliances are available in market. They are not very popular because of their complexity to install and incase of any problem need an expert to fix it. Some needs even major wiring changes to install them in place of existing switchboard. Also these systems are not economical and easy to maintain. No redundancy to each electrical /electronics load, incase of any failure within the system.<br>
Switching on equipments at full blast causes a high peak surge or inrush current. Inrush current is the initial surge of current that results when power is first applied to a load having a low starting impedance, such as discharged capacitor, a cold lamp filament or a stopped motor, etc. This inrush current can be up to 20 times greater than the operating or steady state current. The inrush current is substantially reduced after 10ms, but it can take up to 30-40 cycles until the current is down at a normal level.<br>
Transformers can produce extremely high inrush current in the first half cycle when turn on. Inductive load draws a very heavy current at turn on until the magnetic flux has stabilized. When power supplies are first turned on, they present high initial currents as a result of filter capacitor impedance. These large filter capacitors act like a short circuit, producing an immediate inrush surge current with fast rise time. The peak inrush current is several orders of magnitude greater than the circuit's steady state current. This power surge current can seriously damage other<br>
2<br><br>
components such as welding switch contacts or lead to blown fuses or tripped breakers. Also heavy inrush current reduces the life of the electrical or electronic appliances. Therefore, there is a need of a protective switching system, which can protect the electrical/electronic appliances from initial inrush current.<br>
Hence there is a need of a remote control operated switching system which will address and overcome all the problems of the remote control operated systems of the prior art and at the same time will take care for the protection of the electrical/electronic appliances from initial in-rush current.<br>
Objective of the Invention:<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a switching system, which will obviate the entire problems discussed above in the prior art.<br>

Yet another objective of present invention is to minimize the inrush current while turning on the electrical/electronics appliances, to increases the life of the appliances.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to subdivide entire switching system into different modules for easy and economical replacement of failed module.<br>

Referring to figure 1, it shows the front view of remote control operated modular switching system according to present invention. The housing (23) is a box type construction can be opened from front side or the backside. Housing (23) consists of plurality of slots for accommodating the controller module (1), at least one switch module (2), safety module (6) and power sockets (4). The size of the slots is kept in such a way that controller module (1), switch module (2), power sockets (4) and safety modules (6) can be easily press fitted on the housing (23) from the front side. The advantage of the press fitting modular units on housing (23) is that whenever any particular module is not working user need not to change the entire system, he can easily replace the non-working module. Remote control unit (25) is being used to operate system remotely. Now we will see each unit in greater details with the help of the figures.<br>
As shown in figure 2b, switch module (2) of the present invention consists of three position switch (5), electronic switching device (11), optoisolator (12), power connector (8) and control signal connector (7). Three position switch (5) having three positions referred as ON, OFF &amp; REMOTE positions. As shown in figure 2a and Figure 2b any electrical load (9) and AC power (10) connected externally to switch module (2) using Power connector (8). The electrical load (9) connected to switch module (2) of present invention will be operated remotely when user keeps the three<br>
7<br><br>
position switch (5) on REMOTE position. Control signal (22) from control signal connector (7) turns ON or OFF electronic switching device (11). Current flows through electrical load (9) when electronic switching device (11) is ON and no current flows when electronic switching device (11) is OFF when three position switch (5) is placed in REMOTE position. Also there is an option that user can switch ON or OFF electrical load (9) manually or mechanically by conventional "ON" and "OFF" switching method if he doesn't keep the three position switch (5) in REMOTE position. An Optoisolator (12) isolates the electronic switching device (11) from the controller module (1) electrically. Function of Optoisolator is to pass on control signal (22) from control module (1) to electronic switching device (11) optically but not electrically. Optoisolator (12) prevents any electrical damage to control module (1) incase of electronic switching device (11) failure. An electronic switching device may be TRIAC or SCR.<br>
Now referring to figure 4, shows the block diagram of remote control operated modular switching system according to present invention. The system consists of a controller module (1) for controlling switch modules (2). If it consists of plurality of switch modules (2), then all of them controlled at the same time by the controller module (1). Controller module (1) consists of processor unit (19), zero crossing detector unit (20), display unit (26), communication ports (28), output ports (21) and remote control receiver unit (18). Remote control receiver unit (18) receives signal from remote control unit (25) and sends data to processor unit (19). Data is processed in processor unit (19) and provides control signals (22) to each switch module (2) through output ports (21). Zero crossing detector unit (20) provides A C power reference to the processor unit (19) for determining the time delay required for turning on the electrical load (9) to be operated by switch module (2). Display unit (26) shows the current operation and status of processor unit (19). Processor unit (19) can communicates to safety module (6), external computer or external remote controller using communication ports (28). The processor unit may be microprocessor, programmable logic array, programmable gate or the like. Also the controller module is provided with the firmware/software to execute the function as required by the remote control operated modular switching system and this firmware/software can be upgraded or modified at any time as the need.<br>
Figure 3 shows the Interconnection board (3), which is fitted inside the housing (23). In interconnection board (3), control module (1) plugs into the provided controller module slot (14), switch modules (2) plugs into switch module slots (17) respectively. The control module (1) makes required contact with controller module connector (13), and switch modules (2) makes required contact with switch module connector (16) respectively moment they plugged into housing (23) and interconnection board (3). The interconnection tracks (15) in the interconnection board (3) makes required electrical connection between switch modules (2) and controller module (1).<br>
8<br><br>
Interconnection boards (3) board can connect safety module (6) to controller module (1) and also provides other electrical wiring requirements for the entire system.<br>
The remote control unit (25) used in the present invention is infrared remote controller or radio frequency remote controller. Remote control unit (25) consists of plurality of keys (24) which are to be pressed for sending the command to the controller module (1) in accordance with the application to be carried out by the said switch module (2).<br>
Now we will see the working of the entire system in details. User can select the key (24) on the remote control unit (25) as per the application need to be run by the switch module (2). The signal from the remote control unit (25) is colleted by the remote control receiver unit (18) of the controller module (1), demodulated and given to processor unit (19). Processor unit (19) gets the AC power zero crossing signal from the zero crossing detectors unit (20). Then as per the signals obtained by the processor unit (19), it produces the control signal (22) from one of the output port (21) and this control signal (22) is given to switch module (2). Switch module (2) receives this control signal (22) and couples optically to electronic switching device (11). Control signal (22) from control module (1) turns ON or OFF electronic switching device (11) inside switch module (2).<br>
Current through electrical load (9) and electronic switching device (2) is controlled by controller module (1) when three position switch (5) is placed in REMOTE position. User can switch ON or OFF electrical load (9), and also he can control the current flowing through it. For example user can switch ON or OFF any electrical and electronic appliances, increase or decrease brightness of the lights, increase or decrease speed of the fans, motor speed etc as per his need using remote control unit (25).<br>
In the system of present invention, when user keeps the three position switch (5) on REMOTE position, then only switch module (2) is operated by remote control unit (25). Only in REMOTE position controller module (1), electronic switching device (11) and remote control unit (25) comes into action, otherwise switch module (2) works just like a normal electrical ON-OFF switch.<br>
In this system of present invention current through electrical load (9), increases or decreases gradually when being operated by remote control unit (25). Controller module (1) increases or decreases current through electrical load (9), by controlling the switching timing of electronic switching device (11). Figure 5a shows the resultant voltage waveform (27) across electrical load (9), and control signal (22) from control module (1). By means of phase control, the electronic switching device (11) is held in an OFF condition for a portion of each positive and negative cycle, and then is triggered to ON condition at a time in the half cycle determined by the controller module (1).<br>
9<br><br>
In conventional mechanical switching, while switching ON electrical or electronics appliances, current reaches to peak within few milliseconds and results current inrush as described in prior art Figure 5b, shows the resultant waveform (27) of AC voltage across electrical load (9), and control signal (22) from controller module (1) during soft start period (29). Here power to electrical load (9) increases gradually during power up and reaches to peak over a period of time. Control signal (22) from controller module (1), increase power gradually by controlling switching of electronic switching device (11). In other words, a phase angle controlled soft start will not supply a pure sine wave to the load during the soft start period (29). A phase angle controlled soft start spreads the initial surge of current over many periods, thus reducing the stress and also prevents the occurrence of enormous saturation current. Soft start period (29) for electrical load (9) is set to 1800 milliseconds as shown in figure 5(b) but this period can be altered to any time duration.<br>
