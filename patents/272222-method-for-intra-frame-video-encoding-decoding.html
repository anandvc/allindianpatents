<br>
[0001] The disclosure relates to digital video processing and, more particularly, to techniques for intra-frame video encoding and decoding.<br>
<br>
CLAIM OF PRIORITY<br>
<br>
[0002] This patent application is based on and claims priority to U.S. patent application Serial No. 60/912,364, filed April 17, 2007 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
<br>
[0003] In video encoding, a frame of a video sequence may be partitioned into rectangular regions or blocks. A video block may be encoded in Intra-mode (I-mode) or Inter-mode (P -mode).<br>
<br>
[0004] FIG 1 shows a diagram of a prior art video encoder for the I-mode. In FIG 1, a spatial predictor 102 forms a predicted block 103 from video block 100 by using pixels from neighboring blocks in the same frame. The neighboring blocks used for prediction may be specified by a spatial mode 101. A summer 104 computes the prediction error 106, i.e., the difference between the image block 100 and the predicted block 103. Transform module 108 projects the prediction error 106 onto a set of basis or transform functions. In typical implementations, the transform functions can be derived from the discrete cosine transform (DCT), Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT), or any other transforms. A set of transform functions can be expressed as {f0, fls f2,..., fN}, where each fn denotes an individual transform function.<br>
<br>
[0005] The transform module 108 outputs a set of transform coefficients 110 corresponding to the weights assigned to each of the transform functions. For example, a set of coefficients {co, C1, C2,..., CN} may be computed, corresponding to the set of transform functions {f0, fi, f2,..., f&gt;j}. The transform coefficients 110 are subsequently quantized by quantizer 112 to produce quantized transform coefficients 114. The quantized coefficients 114 and spatial mode 101 may be transmitted to the decoder. <br>
<br>
[0006] FIG IA depicts a video decoder for the I-mode. In FIG IA, quantized coefficients 1000 are provided by the encoder to the decoder, and supplied to the inverse transform module 1004. The inverse transform module 1004 reconstructs the prediction error 1003 based on the coefficients 1000 and the fixed set of transform functions, e.g., {fo, fi, f2,..., fN}- The spatial mode 1002 is supplied to the inverse spatial prediction module 1006, which generates a predicted block 1007 based on pixel values of already decoded neighboring blocks. The predicted block 1007 is combined with the prediction error 1003 to generate the reconstructed block 1010. The difference between the reconstructed block 1010 and the original block 100 in FIG 1 is known as the reconstruction error.<br>
<br>
[0007] An example of a spatial predictor 102 in FIG 1 is herein described with reference to document VCEG-N54, published by ITU - Telecommunication Standardization Sector of Video Coding Expert Group (VCEG) in September 2001. In the embodiment, a coder offers 9 spatial modes of prediction for 4x4 blocks, including DC prediction (Mode 2) and 8 directional modes, labeled 0 through 8, as shown in FIG 2. Each spatial mode specifies a set of already encoded pixels to use to encode a neighboring pixel, as illustrated in FIG 3. In FIG 3, the pixels from a to p are to be encoded, and already encoded pixels A to L are used for predicting the pixels a to p. If, for example, Mode 0 is selected, then pixels a, e, i and m are predicted by setting them equal to pixel A, and pixels b, f, j and n are predicted by setting them equal to pixel B, etc. Similarly, if Mode 1 is selected, pixels a, b, c and d are predicted by setting them equal to pixel I, and pixels e, f, g and h are predicted by setting them equal to pixel J, etc. Thus, Mode 0 is a predictor in the vertical direction; and Mode 1 is a predictor in the horizontal direction. The encoder is further described in the aforementioned document, and in document JVT-B 118r4, published by the Joint Video Team of ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T VCEG in February 2002.<br>
<br>
[0008] It has been noted that when performing the mode -based spatial prediction described above, the reconstruction error may exhibit regular spatial patterns. For example, the reconstruction error may have strong correlation in the direction corresponding to the mode used for prediction. It would be desirable to reduce the reconstruction error by reducing direction-dependent spatial patterns in the reconstruction error. <br>
<br>

<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
[0020] Disclosed herein are techniques for providing mode-dependent transform functions to represent the prediction error.<br>
<br>
[0021] In an embodiment, a transform module projects the prediction error from the spatial predictor onto transform functions that are selected based on the spatial mode. The transform module may select a unique set of transform functions for each spatial mode. For example, the mode-dependent transform functions may be characterized as shown in the following table: <br>
<br>
<br>
Table 1.<br>
<br>
In Table 1, fxy denotes the x-th transform function corresponding to the y-th spatial mode.<br>
<br>
[0022] According to the present disclosure, the mode chosen by the spatial predictor uniquely specifies the particular set of transform functions used to represent the prediction error associated with that mode. Hence only the mode needs to be signaled from the encoder to the decoder to allow the decoder to recover the appropriate transform functions. Accordingly, no additional signaling is needed between encoder and decoder as compared to the implementations shown in FIGs 1 and IA. [0023] Note while Table 1 shows an embodiment wherein (N+ 1) functions are assigned to each mode, the number of functions assigned to each mode need not be the same. For example, in an embodiment, mode 0 may have (N+ 1) assigned transform functions, while mode 1 may have N assigned transform functions, mode 2 may have (N-I) assigned transform functions, etc.<br>
<br>
[0024] FIG 4 depicts an embodiment of an encoder according to the present disclosure. Numbered elements in FIG 4 correspond to similarly numbered elements in FIG 1. The operation of the encoder in FIG 4 is similar to that of FIG 1 , except that the spatial mode 101 selected by the spatial predictor 102 is provided to a modified transform module 408. According to the present disclosure, the spatial mode 101 indicates to the transform module 408 which set of transform functions to use to transform the prediction error 106.<br>
<br>
[0025] FIG 5 depicts an embodiment of a decoder according to the present disclosure. The quantized coefficients 500 and spatial mode 502 are signaled to the decoder from the encoder. Given the coefficients 500 and spatial mode 502, the inverse transform module 504 reconstructs the prediction error 505. The inverse transform module 504 has a priori knowledge of the set of transform functions corresponding to each mode, and thus, given the mode 504, can generate the appropriate transform functions corresponding to the coefficients 500. <br>
<br>
[0026] The mode 502 is also provided to the inverse spatial predictor 506, which derives the predicted block 507. The predicted block 507 and the prediction error 505 are combined by adder 508 to generate the reconstructed video block 510. [0027] Note aspects of the present disclosure need not be limited to any particular mapping of mode to transform functions. In an embodiment, the set of transform functions for each mode may be empirically derived to minimize the reconstruction error of blocks encoded in that mode. For example, a set of transform functions for each mode may be derived by taking a suitably large number of "training" video blocks, and finding the set of transform functions that minimize the prediction error for each mode. For example, a set of transform functions for mode 0 may be determined by finding a best set of transform functions for representing the prediction error of 10,000 training blocks to be encoded in mode 0. The transform functions may be based on the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), or any other transforms known in the art.<br>
<br>
[0028] Based on the teachings described herein, it should be apparent that an aspect disclosed herein may be implemented independently of any other aspects and that two or more of these aspects may be combined in various ways. The techniques described herein may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in hardware, the techniques may be realized using digital hardware, analog hardware or a combination thereof. If implemented in software, the techniques may be realized at least in part by a computer-program product that includes a computer readable medium on which one or more instructions or code is stored. [0029] By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, such as synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), readonly memory (ROM), non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM), ROM, electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), FLASH memory, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other tangible medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. [0030] The instructions or code associated with a computer-readable medium of the computer program product may be executed by a computer, e.g., by one or more processors, such as one or more digital signal processors (DSPs), general purpose <br>
<br>
microprocessors, ASICs, FPGAs, or other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry.<br>
<br>
[0031] A number of aspects and examples have been described. However, various modifications to these examples are possible, and the principles presented herein may be applied to other aspects as well. These and other aspects are within the scope of the following claims. <br>
