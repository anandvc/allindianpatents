				<td>Gear and Vehicle Seat comprising such a Gear<br>
EP 0 979 /50 A2 describes a vehicle seat comprising an adjusting device with a spindle and an associated spindle nut. The spindle is fixed to a first adjustment element of the adjusting device. The spindle nut can turn in a second adjusting element, wherein the second adjusting element together with the first adjusting element is mounted in sort cf a rail guide. ?Jith its outer casing, the spindle nut forms a worm wheel, which is engaged with a worm of a drive unit. The arrangement serves the displacement of a vehicle seat attached "o the second aajusting element in relation to the first adjusting element, which is fixed to the vehicle bottom. The disadvantage associated with this arrangement is that it comprises a plurality of individual components, which must be disposed and att~. rhed directly in the rail arrangement formed by the twc- adjusting elements. Any potentially necessary repairs are theierore associated with greSt expenses.<br>
US 4,802,374 describes a control drive for a vehicle seat, wherein such a srindle is non-rotatably connected to a vehicle seat rail form in .7 an adjusting element. The spindle, however, is fastened outside the rail guide, which is considered undesirable by "-hide manufacturers. A further seat adjustment device with a self-locking adjusting drive for vehicle seats is -:nown from DF, .- 7!^5 740. Also in this arrangement, a plurality of components is disposed adjacent to a rail guide.<br>
A gear arrangement with complex, design for adjusting a vehicle seat is known frr:n WO 02/070299 Al. This arrangement has a<br><br>
gear with complex design, which gear is intended to accommodate forces occurring in the event of an accident.<br>
EP 1 068 093 Bl discloses a gear, as that illustrated according to FIG. 3, which is used to adjust two elements 60, 61 in relation to each other, particularly vehicle elements of a seat adjustment device, a window lifter or a sliding roof, wherein the first of the parts 60 forms a lower rail firmly connected to the -ehicle bottom, which rail receives a locked spindle 62 or a fixed toothed rack.  The gear 6 is located on the spindle 62 ar.~; disolaced back and forth along the spindle n2 upon actuation. The gear 6 is received in a mount 63, v;hich is displaced back and forth together with the second of the adjustable elements 61. The mount 63 is fixed to the second of the elements 61 arinustable in relation to each other, which second element forms a top rail that is adjustably connected to the bottom rail. The upper rail is connected to further components of the vehicle seat via a retaining plate 64. Furthermore, a dri'.'e rechanism 66 is attached to the retaining plate h4 using fa~*er.ing elements 65, the drive shaft 67 of which mechanism i? connected to a drivable worm of the gear 6.<br>
The gear 6 comprises ^ worm wheel, with a spindle nut locked thereto for drivir. j the spindle or a worm locked thereto for driving the toothvd rack, a drivable w^rm for transmitting a driving force fro~ the drive mechanism to the worm wheel and a gear housing, whim receives and supports the worm and the worm wheel and is connected non-displaceably to the second of the adjustable elements 61 in the displacement direction. The gear housing comprises a plurality of, but at least two, housinq plates that are fixed against each other with plug-type connectors, ".'he plug-type connectors fix the positions of the housing plates in relation to each other in all three-<br><br>
dimensional directions, wherein the plug-type connectors are configured at the same time as supporting connecting joints, which absorb the gear forces. If only two housing plates are provided, the gear housing comprises two L-shaped housing plates. If at least four elements are provided, the gear housing comprises at least two pairs of mutually opposed disk-shaped housing plates, wherein in any case a complex gear arrangement is provided, which in addition to the housing elements necessitates a plurality of further bearing elements or bearing support" elements, such as washers. Apart from the complex assembly :f a plurality of individual components, it is also disadvantageous that the tolerances cf the individual components must c~ adapted to each other. The individual housing elements :f such a gear housing are connected by welding/<br>
Furthermore it ha~ been knov:n to provide two individual pressure housing elements, v:hich are equipped with a spindle nut, driver plate.- and bearing bushings as well as a worm and associated bearin;: bushings and are then closed through plastic deformation cf plug-type connectors of the housing halves.<br>
DE 36 40 19"7 Al ri-scribe? a drive apparatus for an adjustable power seat with .-. two-piece housing. In two opposed walls of the housing, respectively, a bore is formed for accommodating the shaft of a wc:.:r, or cf a worm wheel. So as to be able to support the shaft projecting from one end of the worm, a cover is inserted in t':vnt of the bore, which cover on the inside comprises a plug ;^r supporting the shaft. In terms of the support of the we rm wheel ar.d the wheel, this concept has a two-piece housing, which is formed by a main housing and the absolutely required cover ir. terms of its function.<br><br>
EP 0 992 711 A2 describes a gearbox for receiving a worm and a<br>
worm wheel, through earn of which a shaft extends. The two shafts are mounted in two opposing recesses, wherein the recesses are formed by corresponding through-bores through the opposite side walls. So as to insert the worm wheel and worm in the housing, the housing comprises two members, wherein the respective parting line through the side walls extends at the center through the f-.rcugh-bores. After inserting the shafts of the worm ana :•:: rm •••-eel in the recesses of the lower housing member, tee ucper housing rr.emfcer is placed on top and t h e y a r e s c r e w e d i r g e t h e r .<br>
DE 41 04 470 Cl describes a car sear ai^uster with a housing, in which a spindle nut and a threaded 5pindle are accommodated. The- housing is a two-piece housing comprising a main housing el err en. t end a cover for closing the main housing element. A borehole is formed in a housing wall for receiving • -i drive s h a f t . T':. e c c r ~ h c 1 e •-• x t ends laterally in a slot shape t: o an outside wall, w.-.ich can be closer, with the cover. The width of the slo" ror responds t,: mere than the width of the drive shaft and rhe v;i-jth of the receiving section for the diive shaft in i v ? i *.:. pect .1 vo function.-.! position, furthermore, the r.rus:r:u; ;s -/ery complex and comprises a plurality of ind:":idu^._ w.viJ and support, elements.<br>
DE 37 25 15P C2 relates to a power seat apparatus for an automotive vehic.e, v;:.ere::i a mult:-piece housing with a worm and a worm whee] is sr.owr-.. A pluralit\- of different components are used foi support ing t lie //o:::". and wrrm wheel. DE 37 26 SOI C2 relates to a worm gear with a housing, wherein the housing is divided by a partitioning plane that includes the driving axle and is disposed perpendicular to the driving axle, so<br>
that upon separation of the two housing meir.bers an opening is formed for inserting the worm wheel and worn. DE 35 19 058 C2 describes a seat adjustment for a motor vehicle seat with a complex housing for accommodating a worm ar.z a worm wheel. A shaft is mounted in a U-shaped support, which is closed by a flat cover-shaped element in order to prevent the shaft from sliding out of the support. DE 29 25 032 Cl describes a drive unit for a seat adjustment with a multi-piece housing for accommodating a worm and a worm wheel. Particularly support elements, which are included in the housir.:: parts as separate components, serve the support of shafts. IE 29 03 ^82 Al relates to an adjustment mechanism with a :. tnplex design ft. r receiving a worm and a worm wheel, wherein the'.' are accommodated in scecial bearing elements.<br>
It is the object of the invention to simplify a gear for adjusting two elements that can be disclaced in relation tt each: other, particularly vehicle elements -~ a seat adjustment device. In particular, the number of elemer.is required is intended to be reduced and simpler asserr.bl" and/or replacement of near elements are supposed to be pcs'sirle.<br>
Thi.1.' object is attained with a gear for adjusting two elertents that can be displaced in relation to each other, with the characteristics cf claim 1. The object of tlairn 10 is a spindle or worm drive mechanism with a gear of this type. The object of claim 11 is a vehicle seat with ~ gear of this type. Advantageous embodiments are disclosed in the dependent cla ims.<br>
Advantageously, drive mechanisms identical, in design are used for left and right seat rails if the worm asec. and/or the worm wheel used are configured axially on both sides for inserting<br>
or guiding through a drive shaft. It is preferred if the drive shaft is connected to the worm with a square socket, which is provided in the worm on both sides or through it.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred to use a gear for adjusting two elements that can be displaced in relation to each other, particularly vehicle elements of a seat adjustment device, a window lifter or a sliding roof, wherein the first one of the parts has a non-rotatable spindle or a fixed tc?.thed rack and wherein the gear is configured with a wcro. wheel, which has a spindle nut non-re ratable thereto for driving toe spindle or a worm non-rotatabie thereto for oirivir.:: the toothed rack, v.oith a drivable worm fcr transmitting a drivir.:; force to the /.-orm wheel and with a gear housing, which receives ao:i supports the worm and the worm wheel and Ahich car. be connected non-displaceably to the second one of the parts in the displacement direction thereof, wherein the gear housing is made of a single-piece body with a worn hearing and a worro wheel bearing.<br>
It is preferred to use a gear, whereir. the worr. bearing is formed in one or two opposite walls, particularly in the form of side walls of the gear housing, ac~ve all ir. the top section of the gear housing, ana in the .r.serti.n direction, of the worm comprises a v.'orm bearing access openir.':, with th-e worm bearing access opening extending through toe corresponding side wa_i to the bottor. of the sioe wall and/or of the gear housing.<br>
It. is preferable to use such a gear ir. wh;ch tr.-: worm bearing access opening or a section in the transition region between the worm bearing access opening and to.e v;orm be-ring has a<br>
smaller distance than the diameter of a worm shaft of the worm.<br>
It is preferred to use a gear in which the worm wheel bearing is formed in one or two opposite walls, particularly beneath the upper worm, and comprises a worm wheel bearing access opening, with the; worm wheel bearing access opening extending through a corresponding side wall to the bottom of the side wall and/or of the gear housing.<br>
It. is preferable t '" use such a gear in which "he worm wheel bearing acoes.; orening or a section in the transition regirr. between the worm '.-.'heel bearing access opening and the worm wheel bearing ha.? a smaller distance than the diameter of a worm wheel shaft of the worm wheel.<br>
It is preferable to use a gear in which the side walls with the worm bearing are configured between the side walls with the worm wheel bearing. In a simple embodiment, the side walls with the worm wheel bearing form the fronts of a housing ar.d the side walls wi:r. the worm bearing form the two walls between the fronts. In a view from above, these four walls thus form side w-.ISs of a square or cuboid housing. Other embodiments, however, are also conceivable, for example one in<br>
which two of the opposite walls extend to the two other walls<br>
»<br>
at an angle between a worm axis and a worm wheel axis, the angle theoretically ranging between 1 and 179°.<br>
Preferred is =) near, in which the side walls in the bottom section d the uear housing are formed by mutually-spaced legs, with the distances of two adjoining legs as worm bearing access openings for. the purpose of guiding through a worm shaft and/or as worm wheel bearing access openings for guiding<br>
through a worm wheel shaft are dimensioned wide enough and/or elastic enough.<br>
Preferable is such a gear that has a housing closure elemer.t. for closing the bottom of the gear housing, the housing closure element fixing the legs against each other after inserting the housing closure element. A housing closure element of this type can be implemented particularly in the :'?-rr. of an encompassing pan or in the form of a pin design.<br>
I referable 1..-3 a near with a housing closure element for "losing the bottor.. of the gear housing, in which 'he housi. :; :losure element supports the worm wheel and/or the worn ir. the ;:ear housing from beneath.<br>
-referable is a gear, in which at least one inside side wall towards the worm bearing access opening or towards the worr vrheel bearing access opening has an insertion taper.<br>
This advantageously simplifies the design and assembly of ~.;ch ; gear accordingly. In the simplest case, this is done by reducing the number of components to three particular ones, namely a single-piece gear block as the gear housing, a wcr~; end a spindle nut. The worm and spindle nut used can have -he conventional designs, with the spindle nut having part rcul -.rly an enveloping row of teeth with a cylindrical portion. The Tear block may be produced easily and at the same time: COST-efficiently, for example, as a polymer injection-molded part •/.•ith accordingly integrally formed recesses for gearing elements. The individual components, meaning particularly :he worm and spindle nut, are inserted in the gear block usinc appropriate receiving devices and/or feed devices to the bearings and are supported therein rotatably about the<br>
respective longitudinal axis using a snap-fit or detent connection. According to a preferred embodiment, a gear cover is snapped into corresponding detent elements from beneatr. as a housing closure element in order to secure the combination of worm wheel and spindle nut in the gear housing.<br>
It is preferred if a gear with such very small dimensions is used between twc seat rails, functioning as the elements of a vehicle seat that can be displaced relative to each other. In principle, however, the use in various applications of werm gears car. be implemented.<br>
One exemplary embodiment will be explained in more detail-hereinafter with reference to the drawing, wherein:<br>

1A   is a sectional view of such an arrangement;<br>
FIG. 2    shows ine element.s of the arrangement according to FIG. 1 in exploded view; ana<br>
FIG. 3    is a 5-hematic illustration of individual elements of a vehicle seat frame and rail guide with a gear according to the prior art.<br>
FIGS. 1 =nd 2 sr.rv assemble.i and exploded views of a gear and the components *. nereof according to a particularly preferred embodiment. A single-piece gear housing 1 serves to accommodate a w,-rm ; and a worm wheel 4. The arrangement ran<br>
optionally be closed from beneath using a housing closure<br>
element 2 or a housing cover.<br>
The gear housing 1 comprises an upper element 10, on the bottom corner rerions of which legs 11 or bar-shaped extensions are integrally formed and directed downward. The spatial directions above and below in the present embodiment serve only illustration purposes since the assembled gear can ultimate!// ::. e in-^rted in a drive mechanism in arbitrary<br><br>

.-. rt, the worm 3 comprises a worm shaft 3D and<br>
.ich are formed in the center 'region of -he und the same. As is apparent particularly r. ends of the worm shaft 30 preferably have 5 '2 serving the fastening of a drive shaft<br>
31'), so "hat the worm 3 can be rotated about 5x1.3 X thereof. An arrangement of this rr.ount<br>
a through-arrangement of a drive shaft mount ."vision of drive mechanisms for left and vith identical designs. Using one and the _sn is useful in that a drive shaft 67 can be :n both .sides or that it can extend thrrugh. ;f the drive shaft mount 32 is configured in<br>
;.yjrire socket on both sides or through it.<br><br><br>
the worm 3 in the worm space 12, it is :-f-. annular bearing disks 33 on the two •.-:crm .ich project from the worm 3 on both sides of . This, however, is not absolutely required<br><br>
and may be foregone in the event of an enveloping row of teeth with cylindrical portion, for example.<br>
Worm bearings 14 are formed in two mutually opposed first side walls 13 of the upper part 1 [sic]1 of the gear housing 1, which part forms the worm space 12. At least one of the worm bearings 14 is configured as a through-bore through the corresponding first side wall 13 in order to allow the corresponding w:rm shaft 30 and/or the drive shaft attached thereto tc pass inrough the first side wall 13. The open diameter of the worm bearing 14 is larger than the diameter d3<br>
"inirnum c_earan -e .<br>
For inserting tr.e worm 3 in the worm'bearing 14, worm bearing access openings 15 are integrated in the first two side walls 13, which openings extend from the worm bearing 14 to the bottom of the uirper element 10 or the corresponding first side •.-.•alls 13. This r.llcws the worm 3 to be inserted in the worm bearing 14 from beneath, wherein the ends of the worm shaft 30 are guided through the two corresponding worm bearing access openings 1 5.<br>
So as to retain ihe worm 3 in the worm space 12, acc^rdi:"..;: to a simple embodirent the worm wheel 4 may be inserted in the gear housing 1 from beneath and be supported therein such that the worm 3 is securely supported in the worm bearing 14 ar.ci also supported towards the bottom by the worm wheel.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, however, the wall of the worm bearing access opening 15 has a transversely, meaning<br>
particularly parallel to the worm axis X, extending bar as a retaining bar 16. An open distance d4 between the retaining bar or bars 16 on the two opposite walls of the worm bearing access opening 15 is smaller than the diameter d3 of the worm shaft 30. The wall of the gear housing 1 in the region of at least the worm bearing access opening 15 and/or the wall of the worm shaft 30 are made of elastic material, which yields when inserting the worm 3 in the worm bearing 14 through the worm bearing access openings 15. After inserting the worm shaft 30 above the retaining bar or bars 16, the worm shaft 3C with the two ends thereof is rotatably supported in the worm bearing 14, wherein the retaining bars 16 prevent the shaft from sliding downward out of the worm bearing 14.<br>
The worm wheel 4 comprises in the familiar fashion a worm wheel shaft 40, which protrudes from worm wheel teeth 41 with both ends. The wcrm wheel 4 is configured such that it can rotate about a wcrm wheel axis Y, wherein the worm wheel axis Y at the same tire forms the axis of rotation of a spindle nut 42. The spindle n/.;t 42 is formed by inside teeth of the worm wheel shaft 40, which is configured as a hollow shaft. The spindle nut 42 .serves to accommodate a spindle, which during operation of the oear, for example in the guide rails of a vehicle seat, meshes with a spindle disposed non-rotabably in one of the rails. "Jpon rotating the worm wheel 4, the worm wheel 4 is ciisplared back and forth along the stationary spindle. Together with the worm wheel 4, the gear housing 1 accommodating the worm wheel 4 is displaced back and forth. The worm wheel •'-. here is driven by a worm 3 provided on the 4*op and a drive shaft, which is connected to the drive shaft mount 32 of the wcrm 3.<br>
For inserting the worm wheel 4, the gear housing 1 comprises worm wheel spaces 17 beneath the upper element 10 and beneath<br>
the worm space 12. The worm wheel space 17 may be bordered by two or more mutually opposed closed walls or preferably by the four legs 11. Two mutually adjacent legs 11, respectively, thus form a second side wall 18. Each of these two mutually opposed second side walls 18 includes a worm wheel bearing 19. The diameter cf this worm wheel bearing 19 is equal to or larger than the outside diameter dl of the worm wheel shaft 40, so that the worm wheel shaft 40 is supported rotatably about the worrr. wheel axis Y in the two worm wheel bearings 19.<br>
A worm wheel bearing access opening 20 is provided in the two second side wails 18 for inserting the worm wheel 4 in the worm wheel bearing 19. The worm wheel be'aring access openings 20 extend frorr the two worm wheel bearings 19 to the bottom of the two second side walls 18 or to the bottom of the gear housing 1, so that the worm wheel 4 can be inserted from beneath with "he worm whe'el shaft 40 through the worm wheel bearing access opening 20 upwards into the worm wheel bearing<br>
I M.<br>
So as to support the worm wheel 4 and/or the worm wheel shaft 40 downward in the worm wheel bearings 19, a distance d2 of the walls in :.he wo.::n wheel bearing access openings 20 is preferably si:ght ly smaller than the outside diameter of the worm wheel sh.ift 40. The wall material of the worm wheel bearing access openings 20 and/or the material of the worm wheel shafts -0 are elastic such that the worm wheel shaft 40 c.m be in.sorted in rhe worm wheel bearings 19 from beneath through the worm wheel bearing access openings 20 and is supported securely towards the bottom by the walls after-reaching the worm wheel bearings 19. To facilitate the<br>
insertion of the worm wheel shaft 40 in the worm wheel bearing access openings 20, the openings have a wall tapered towards the bottom and the outside as insertion taper 21.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, a housing cover in the form of a housing closure element 2 may be inserted in the gear housing 1 from beneath. The housing closure element 2 then closes off the worm wheel space 17, which is otherwise open towards the bottom. The upper wall of the housing closure element 2 is preferably rounded such that the worm wheel space 17 forms a suff icier*, iy large space for the worm wheel teeth 41 and so that the t'/:c ends of the worm wheel shaft 40 •.: e supported on correspondingly shaped bearing surfaces 22. So as to fix the housing closure element 2 in the gear housina 1, a prior art detent closure comprising, for example, corresponding detent elements may be provided on the legs 11 of the gear housing I. It is particularly preferred, however, if bolt recesses 23 for accommodating fastening bolts 24 are provided, wherein the bolt recesses 23 in the form of through-borers extend through the legs .1 L as well as a lateral w~;li 25 of the housing closure element 2. The width of the lateral walls 25 preferably corresponds to the distance d2 of the walls of the worm wheel bearing access openings 20 so that the worm wheel space 17 is sealed 1 -n-:ards the second side W:\lis if' after the worm wheel 4 has been inserted. The worm wheel axis Y extends particularly in a direction perpendicular to the worm axis X, as is known from prior art.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment, a worm wheel 4 with a worm wheel shaft 40 may also be used in place of a worm wheel 4 with integrated spindle nut 42, wherein then in addition to the worm wheel teeth 41 worm teeth are configured on the worm wheel shaft 40. The worm teeth then serve the meshing with the<br>
teeth of a toothed rack, which is disposed in a stationary manner, for example in a rail attached on the vehicle bottom, in order to displace the gear housing 1 back and forth along the toothed rack. In this case, the bottom of the gear housing 1 is open to the bottom in order to allow engagement of the toothed rack, wherein such a toothed rack may extend through the worm wheel bearing access openings 20. In particular, such a toothed rack may also serve as abutment for the worm wheel 4, so that, the constriction of the distance of the legs 11 or the walls of the &gt;:orm wheel bearing access openings 20 need not. be smaller than the diameter dl of the worm wheel shaft 40.<br>
It is also possible to implement a plurality of further embodiments of t'he gear housing 1. The gear housing 1 may be formed, for example, by a substantially cuboid housing with an open floor wall ar.d four worm bearing or worm wheel bearing access openings 15, 20 extending through the side walls from the floor wall, which openings are directed upward to the respective worm bearing 14 or worm wheel bearing 19.<br>
Instead of using elastic wall materials, it is also conceivable to configure elastic transition regions, particularly at the height of the worm wheel bearings 19 and/or the worm bearings 14, in order to temporarily widen the downward extending lateral walls of the worm wheel bearing access openings 2C and/or of the worm bearing access openings 15 for pushing through the worm wheel shaft 40 and/or the worm shaft. 30.<br>
Plastic material is particularly preferred for the gear housing i, the worm 3 and the worm wheel 4 because it allows simple manufacturing using an injection molding process. In<br>
principle, however, also other materials can be used, particularly metal, to produce such gears.<br>
A gear of this configuration comprising such a gear housing 1 with worm 3 and worm wheel 4 is used, for example, in an arrangement according to FIG. 3 in place of the gear 6 depicted there. The spindle 62 is guided through the spindle nut 42.  The drive shaft 67 of the drive mechanism 66 is connected to' the drive shaft mount 32 of the worm shaft 30 of the worm 3. Driving the drive shaft 67 by means of the drive mechanism 66 thus results in a rotation of the worm 3, which in turn results in a corresponding rotation of the we rm •/.•heel 4. As a result, of the subsequent rotation z~ the spir.ile rvit 42, the worm wheel 4, and via the support thereof ir. the w;rm wheel bearing 19 also the gear housing 1, are displaced back and forth along the stationary spindle 62. Together with the gear housing 1, the upper rail 61, which forms one of the adjustable elements, is displaced via the mount 62 ir. relation to the lower rail 60,"which forms the other adjustable element, so that a seat attached to the upper rail 61 is displaced forward or backward relative to ^ vehicle crttom.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment, the worm v/neel 4 r.ay also be disposed as an upper tooth element in the gear housing 1 above the worm .? .<br>
Particularly with an arrangement of the worn wheel 4 as the lower tooth element in the gear housing 1 v.'ith the penetrating spindle 62, a support for the worm wheel shaft 40 th?.t. is closed toward ': he bottom may be eliminated if the spindle 62 retains the worm wheel 4, and via the worm wheel -. optionally retains also the worm 3, relative to the gear houiir.:; 1 in the corresponding bearings 14, 19.<br>
