				<td>Technical field, problem posed<br>
The invention concerns a system for controlling mobile objects in a guide circuit. It is<br>
particularly applicable, for example, to toy car systems guided on a track.<br>
Games consisting of automobile circuits in which the cars are guided, for example, by<br>
guide lanes, are known in the art. However, these systems generally provide several circuits,<br>
each of which guides a car. Each car is guided by commands given to the circuit. If there are<br>
several cars on the same circuit, they will be guided in the same way, based on the orders<br>
given to the circuit. For the operator, this creates a certain monotony in the use of the system,<br>
and in the long run, a certain tedium that can result in a loss of interest in this type of game.<br>
The subject of the invention is a system that makes it possible to solve this problem.<br>
It concerns a system that makes it possible to introduce surprise and spontaneity into the<br>
control of a vehicle circuit such as a guided automobile circuit. The invention also has the<br>
advantage of making it possible to control several vehicles independently on the same circuit.<br>
The invention concerns a method for piloting mobile objects driven by actuators,<br>
particularly miniature cars, on a continuous track. The mobile objects are guided by operators<br>
via a guide circuit comprising several lanes. The guide circuit is common to the various<br>
mobile objects moving around the same track. The method comprises the following steps:<br>
- the step, for the operator, of choosing, ahead of time or in real time, a mobility<br>
strategy for the mobile object,<br>

miniature cars, the nature of the tires, the initial gasoline allocation, etc.<br>
The mobility strategy is also characterized by at least one of the following parameters<br>
specifying the driving:<br>
- a speed parameter,<br>
- a lane change parameter.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the method is such that, in order to<br>
parameterize the mobile object based on the mobility strategy chosen, the method also<br>
comprises the step, for the operator, of entering data and/or macro commands into a memory<br>
area located in the mobile object. The memory area is associated with a microcontroller that<br>
controls the actuators.<br>
Preferably, according to a variant of embodiment of the invention, the method is such<br>
that, in order to transmit to the mobile object control instructions in accordance with the<br>
mobility strategy chosen, the method comprises the step of initializing each of the mobile<br>
objects by assigning them an identifier, particularly an alphanumeric identifier. This<br>
identifier can also be characterized by a specific communication channel. In the case of this<br>
variant of embodiment, the method also comprises the following steps:<br>
- the step of formatting the control instructions in the form of digital data by<br>
associating them with the identifier of the mobile object in question,<br>

of the mobile objects and the electric power supply required to operate the mobile object,<br>
- the step, for each microcontroller of each mobile object, of extracting from the<br>
multiplexed control instructions those that are associated with the identifier that has been<br>
assigned to the mobile object in question.<br>
The method also comprises the step, for the microcontroller, of controlling the<br>
actuators based on the extracted control instructions.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the method is such that the multiplexing is a<br>
time multiplexing.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the time multiplexing is such that each phase<br>
for transmitting the control instructions associated with a given mobile object is followed by<br>
a phase for supplying electric power.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the method also comprises the step of<br>
supplying power to the actuators of the mobile object through an electrical circuit associated<br>
with the guide circuit and/or through a battery and/or through a rechargeable battery in the<br>
mobile object. The method is such that, in order to transmit to the mobile object control<br>
instructions in accordance with the mobility strategy chosen, the method also comprises the<br>
following steps:<br>
- the step of initializing each of the mobile objects by assigning each of them an<br>
identifier, particularly an alphanumeric identifier,<br>

signal the control instructions associated with the identifier assigned to the mobile object in<br>
question.<br>
The method also comprises the step, for the microcontroller, of controlling the<br>
actuators based on the control instructions extracted from the signal.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, in order to select the guide lane used based on<br>
the mobility strategy, while the mobile object is moving around the track, the method also<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
- the step, for a given mobile object, of transmitting a guide signal, particularly an<br>
optical - for example infrared - signal, to a receiver disposed on the guide circuit and/or on<br>
the track;<br>

controlling the state of a switch associated with said receiver and disposed on the guide<br>
circuit,<br>
- the step, for the switch, of changing states as a function of the control signal.<br>
The result of the combination of the technical features according to the invention is<br>
that as the mobile object moves around the track, the mobile object actuates the switch that<br>
allows it to change lanes.<br>
Another result of the combination of the technical features according to the invention<br>
is that the operator transmitting control instructions to the mobile object can see that the<br>
lateral movements of the mobile object on the track are practically identical to those that<br>
would be observed by an observer actuating a steering wheel for changing the direction of<br>
said mobile object, whose point of view would be associated with said mobile object.<br>
Another result of the combination of the technical features according to the invention<br>
is that a mobile object moving around the track can pass another one located in front of it, by<br>
swerving laterally.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the receiver is disposed on the guide circuit<br>
and/or on the track ahead of the switch and at a distance from the latter such that a change in<br>
the state of the switch cannot produce a change in the movement of any mobile object other<br>
than the one that first actuated the switch.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the method is such that it also comprises the<br>
step of automatically switching the switch to a predetermined state after the passage of a<br>
mobile object that has actuated it.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the predetermined state is the initial state.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the method also comprises the step of<br>
determining the number of laps around the track performed by each mobile object by<br>
detecting a label associated with a given mobile object by means of a reader, particularly an<br>
optical or electromagnetic reader, integral with the track.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the method also comprises the step of timing<br>
the time taken by a given mobile object to perform a given number of laps around the track.<br>
The timing is performed by detecting the passage of a label associated with the mobile object<br>
read by means of a reader, particularly an optical and/or electromagnetic reader, integral with<br>
the track.<br>
System<br>
The invention also concerns a system for piloting mobile objects driven by actuators,<br>
particularly miniature cars, on a continuous track. The mobile objects are guided by operators<br>

strategy chosen, and/or<br>
- transmission means for transmitting to the mobile object control instructions in<br>
accordance with the mobility strategy chosen, particularly control instructions related to its<br>
speed and to the guide lane used.<br>
Thus, in the example in question, the mobile object can be a robot moving<br>
autonomously around the track without the intervention of the operator. It can also be<br>
programmed to interpret control instructions from the operator so as to generate movements<br>
that correspond to the operator's expectations.<br>
The mobile object includes selection means for selecting the guide lane used based on<br>
the mobility strategy. The selection means are implemented by the mobile object as it moves<br>
around the track.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the system is such that the mobility strategy is<br>
characterized by one of the following initialization parameters specifying:<br>

miniature cars, the nature of the tires, the initial gasoline allocation, etc.<br>
The mobility strategy is also characterized by at least one of the following parameters<br>
specifying the driving:<br>
- a speed parameter,<br>
- a lane change parameter.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the system is such that the parameterization<br>
means include a control element for entering data and/or macro commands into a memory<br>
area located in the mobile object. The memory area is associated with a microcontroller that<br>
controls the actuators.<br>

multiplexed control instructions those that are associated with the identifier that has been<br>
assigned to the mobile object in question. The microcontroller controls the actuators based on<br>

for transmitting the control instructions associated with a given mobile object is followed by<br>
a phase for supplying electric power.<br>
Preferably, according to another variant of embodiment of the invention, the system<br>
also comprises an electric power supply for the actuators, constituted by an electrical circuit<br>
associated with the guide circuit and/or by a battery and/or by a rechargeable battery in the<br>
mobile object. Each mobile object is identified by an identifier, particularly an alphanumeric<br>
identifier. In the case of this variant of embodiment, the system also includes a base<br>

signal the control instructions associated with the identifier assigned to the mobile object in<br>
question. The microcontroller controls the actuators based on the extracted control<br>
instructions.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the guide circuit is in the form of several guide<br>
lanes. Each mobile object includes a guide element that cooperates with the guide lanes. The<br>
guide lanes are interconnected by switches. The mobile object includes transmission means<br>
for transmitting a guide signal, particularly an optical - for example infrared - signal, to a<br>

circuit and/or on the track The switch receiver includes decoding means for decoding the<br>
guide signal and producing a control signal for the switch. The switch includes a moving<br>
element that is actuated by the switch control signal. This moving element is capable of<br>
assuming at least two positions.<br>
The result of this combination of technical features is that the mobile object can thus<br>
select the appropriate guide lane, based on the mobility strategy, as it moves around the track.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the switch receiver is disposed on the guide<br>
circuit and/or on the track ahead of the switch and at a distance from the latter such that a<br>

Detailed description<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will emerge through the reading<br>
of the description of variants of embodiment of the invention given as illustrative and<br>
nonlimiting examples, and of:<br>
- Fig. 1, which schematically represents the system according to the invention,<br>
- Figs. 2a and 2b, which represent an exemplary switch according to the invention,<br>
- Figs. 3a and 3b, which represent an application of the invention to a system wherein<br>
the electric power supply for the vehicles that allows them to move and the speed and<br>
guidance information flow through the same circuit, for example the guide circuit for the<br>
vehicles,<br>
- Fig. 4, which represents the control circuits of the system according to the invention,<br>
- Fig. 5, which represents the circuits provided in each vehicle,<br>
- Figs. 6a and 6b, which represent a variant of a switch to which the invention can be<br>
applied,<br>
- Figs. 7a and 7b, which represent a variant of a switch that automatically returns to<br>
the neutral position.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically represents the system according to the invention. The system<br>
includes a circuit Cl, C2, C3 on which mobile objects such as one or more vehicles VI, V2,<br>
V3 must run. The circuit Cl, C2, C3 is supplied with electric power in an intrinsically known<br>
way. For example, in Fig. 1, the power required to move the vehicles VI, V2, V3 is supplied<br>
via a transformer Tl and the guide circuit Cl, C2, C3. According to the invention, the<br>
vehicles VI, V2, V3 also receive speed and trajectory commands through the guide circuit. A<br>
circuit interposed between the transformer and the guide circuit is provided, making it<br>
possible to transmit, through the guide circuit, speed and guidance information for the<br>
vehicles VI, V2, V3. Each vehicle VI, V2, V3 can receive a piece of information, or a<br>
packet of information containing a piece of speed information and a piece of guidance<br>
control information. The control of each vehicle V2, V2, V2 is therefore independent of the<br>
control of the other vehicles VI, V2, V3 running on the circuit.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2a and 2b, each vehicle VI, V2, V3 has an information transmitter<br>
El. In addition, the guide circuit Cl has an information receiver Dl associated with each<br>
switch Al, A2, A3 and ahead of each switch in the vehicles' direction of travel. When a<br>
vehicle receives a guidance command, it has this information transmitted to its transmitter<br>
El. When the transmitter El of the vehicle comes near the receiver Dl, the latter receives<br>
this information, decodes it, and triggers the operation of the switch Al. Thus, in Fig. 2b, the<br>
receiver Dl has controlled the switching of the switch Al so that the vehicle is directed to the<br>
lane C3 of the circuit.<br>
According to a simplified variant of embodiment of the invention, all of the switches<br>
on the circuit such as Al have a neutral position such that after the switching of the switch<br>
and after the passage of the vehicle, the switch returns to a neutral position. Under these<br>
conditions, the system can be designed so that the normal movement of the vehicle is such<br>
that it runs through the circuit with the switches in the neutral position. As long as it does not<br>
receive a guidance command, the vehicle's transmitter does not transmit any information, and<br>
the detectors such as Dl remain inactive. When the operator wants to make the vehicle turn,<br>
for example to the right in Fig. 2a, he sends a direction change command, the transmitter El<br>
transmits a control signal, the detector Dl detects it and triggers the operation (the switching)<br>
of the switch Al, which moves to the position represented in Fig. 2b and automatically<br>
returns to the position of Fig. 2a after the vehicle passes.<br>
Under these conditions, according to this variant of embodiment, the receiver has no<br>
decoding function.<br>
Relative position of the transmitters and receivers<br>
The transmitters such as El can be placed underneath the vehicles. In this case, the<br>
receivers such as D1 are placed on the circuit in the lane in which the vehicles are running,<br>
for example, between the wheel paths.<br>
The transmitters such as El can also be placed on a lateral wall or on the front of the<br>
vehicle and oriented toward the edge of the track. The receivers will then be placed on the<br>
edge of the track at a height such that they sit on the axis of maximum transmission of the<br>
transmission lobe of the vehicles' transmitters.<br>
In any case, the transmitters El will preferably be placed in the front part of the<br>
vehicle so as to trigger the switch as soon as possible when the vehicle approaches the<br>
switch.<br>
Relative position of the receivers and the switches<br>
The receivers such as Dl are located along the lane at a distance from the switches<br>
Al such that a vehicle, when it is at the maximum speed allowed by the system., is diverted<br>
by the switch Al that follows the detector Dl right after having been detected by this<br>
detector.<br>
In this general description of the invention, the transmission of the information<br>
transmitted from an operator's station to a vehicle can take place through the guide circuits of<br>
the vehicle via radio frequency, ultrasound or optical transmission.<br>
Generally, it is also possible to arrange for the power supply of the vehicle that allows<br>
it to move to be provided in the vehicle itself, by means of an electric battery.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, we will now describe the application of the invention to a system<br>
wherein the electric power supply of the vehicles that allows them to move, and the speed<br>
and guidance information, are carried by the same circuit, for example the guide circuit for<br>
the vehicles.<br>
Fig. 3a represents a control diagram for the power supply and the transmission of<br>
information wherein the electric power supply of the vehicles is periodically cut off for brief<br>
periods, during which the centralized control system transmits guidance and speed<br>
information to the vehicles. In Fig. 3a, there are assumed to be three vehicles. During a first<br>
electric power supply cutoff, information is transmitted to the vehicle VI (data VI). During a<br>
second electric power supply cutoff, information is transmitted to the vehicle V2 (data V2).<br>
During a third electric power supply cutoff, information is transmitted to the vehicle V3 (data<br>
V3). Then, the cycle begins again. For example, a time ts for the transmission of data to a<br>
vehicle (data VI or example) can be approximately 5 ms. A time t for the supply of electric<br>
power can be approximately 20 ms. A practical example allowing for 8 vehicles would lead<br>
to a cycle time T of 200 ms.<br>
Fig. 3b represents a variant wherein the data VI, V2, V3 of a cycle are sent together<br>
during the same cutoff of the electric power supply to the vehicles.<br>
Fig. 3c represents a variant of embodiment wherein the speed and guidance<br>
information are superposed on the power supply current.<br>
Fig. 4 represents an exemplary embodiment of a control station which supplies the<br>
electric power to the guide circuit and from which the vehicles are controlled. The guide<br>
circuit in this case includes electrically conductive elements.<br>
This control station includes a transformer TR which is generally supplied with<br>
alternating current by the mains supply and which provides a low-voltage power supply.<br>
A processing unit UT1 includes a circuit Wl for transmitting speed information and a<br>
circuit for transmitting guidance information. These circuits are controlled by joysticks Jl,<br>
J2, J3 of a known type. The joystick Jl makes it possible to control the vehicle VI, the<br>
joystick J2 makes it possible to control the vehicle V2, and the joystick J3 makes it possible<br>
to control the vehicle V3. A central control unit UC1 makes it possible to periodically and<br>
alternately connect the circuit Cl to the transformer TR and to the processing unit UT1. In<br>
addition, the processing unit UT1 controls the successive transmission of the speed and<br>
guidance information transmitted from the joysticks Jl, J2, J3. It adds to each of these pieces<br>
of information an identity (IDENT) that represents the joystick and consequently the vehicle<br>
controlled. The successive transmissions take place in accordance with a process of a type<br>
similar to the one in Figs. 3a through 3c.<br>
Fig. 5 represents a vehicle VI. The unit ALIM of the vehicle is connected by an<br>
electrical connection device, for example brushes, to the guide circuit. The unit ALIM is<br>
therefore supplied with power during the periods when the transformer TR is connected to<br>
the guide circuit Cl, and it supplies the electric power to the motor M and to all the<br>
electronic circuits of the vehicle.<br>
A processing unit UT2 is also electrically connected to the guide circuit Cl by the<br>
brushes. Thus, it receives the speed and guidance information sent by each joystick, along<br>
with an identity associated with this information. The processing unit of the vehicle VI<br>
recognizes the identity related to the joystick Jl and hence to itself and retrieves the<br>
information associated with this identity.<br>
The processing unit UT2 processes this information based on the characteristics<br>
assigned to this vehicle (for example, parameters such as the driving type, the vehicle type,<br>
the speed, the nature of the tires, the gasoline allocation, etc.) and then transmits the<br>
processed speed and guidance information. A control unit UC2 provides:<br>
- a piece of guidance information to a transmission circuit G for activating the<br>
transmission by the transmitter El of a piece of guidance information<br>
- a piece of speed information to a transmission circuit W2 for controlling the speed<br>
of the motor M.<br>
On the guide circuit end, a receiver Dl is located along the circuit. When the receiver<br>
Dl receives a piece of guidance information as a vehicle passes, it switches the position of<br>
the switch Al, particularly by means of an electromagnet.<br>
In a simplified version, each switch has only two positions as in Fig. 2a. In this case,<br>
the guidance information is just a simple piece of switching information, which is all the<br>
receiver Dl needs to detect in order to trigger the switching of Al.<br>
In a more elaborate version, a switch can have more than two positions and can<br>
switch a lane Cl to more than two possible other lanes.<br>
For example, Figs. 6a and 6b show that a lane Cl can be connected to a selected lane<br>
C2, C3 or C4. In this case, the guidance information transmitted by the transmitter El<br>
contains a direction indication and must be interpreted by the receiver Dl.<br>
In this case, the transmitter El includes several light sources such as diodes. A<br>
combination of lit diodes makes it possible to represent a control instruction. Thus, two<br>
diodes make it possible to control a four-way switch, and three diodes make it possible to<br>
control an eight-way switch. Then, based on the guidance information received, the control<br>
unit UC2 will then actuate the lighting of selected diodes that correspond to this information.<br>
Each receiver such as Dl will have as many detecting diodes as each vehicle has<br>
emitting diodes. Based on the diodes that have detected a signal, the receiver Dl will control<br>
the position of the switch.<br>
It should be noted that the transmitters on the vehicles must be positioned based on<br>
the position of the detectors, and vice versa, so that as the vehicle passes, the various diodes<br>
of El pass in front of the diodes in the same row of Dl.<br>
In the above system, it is presumed that in the absence of a detection of a guidance<br>
information signal, the switch is not activated, and it remains in the neutral position like the<br>
one in Fig. 2a.<br>
Figs. 7a and 7b represent a device that makes it possible to have the switch return to<br>
the neutral position after a vehicle passes.<br>
In Fig. 7a, the switch Al is in the neutral position, and it connects the lane segment<br>
Cl to the lane segment C2.<br>
Switching the switch Al has the effect of connecting the lane segment Cl to the lane<br>
segment C2. The point of the switch Al has a portion Bl that curves toward the inside of the<br>
lane segment C3.<br>
When the vehicle that triggered this switching passes over the switch, it pushes on the<br>
portion B1 and forces the switch to return to its neutral position.<br>
It should be noted that depending on the type of switch, the switching of the switch<br>
can be done by means of a keel Q located underneath the vehicle and extending downward<br>
into the support plate containing the guide system. In this case the part Bl does not interfere<br>
with the passage of the vehicle's wheels.<br>
Preferably, it is arranged for the keel to be located underneath the vehicle at the front<br>
of the vehicle in order to trigger the return of the switch to the neutral position immediately<br>
after it passes.<br>
Moreover, each vehicle has, underneath the vehicle, an identification label L. This<br>
label is optically, electrically, or electromagnetically readable by a sensor CL located along<br>
the guide circuit. This sensor is linked to the processing unit UT1, which can thus calculate<br>
the various performances reached by the vehicle, such as speed, distance traveled, etc.<br>
