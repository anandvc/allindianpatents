We,  TORRENT PHARMACEUTICALS  LIMITED, Torrent  Research Centre,  P.O.   Bhat 382428, District Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION HAVING CASING WITH MULTIPLE MICRO TABLETS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a modified extended or controlled release pharmaceutical composition, containing at least one pharmaceutical active substance, having a casing containing two or more micro tablets. The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of said modified release dosage form comprising steps of making core particles by granulating active ingredient or substance with release controlling agent(s), optionally coating of core particles with release controlling agent(s), compression of coated core particles into micro tablets, optionally coating of micro tablets with release controlling agent(s) and then filling of two or more coated and/or uncoated micro tablets in a casing.<br>
At least one pharmaceutical active ingredient or substance is selected from the group consisting of venlafaxine HC1, sodium valproate, domperidone maleate, diltiazem HC1 and mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention also relates to solid oral dosage forms comprising a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention.<br>
The present invention also provides a novel process for preparing the novel formulations of the invention.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of treating a mammal, particularly a human in need of treatment utilizing at least one active pharmaceutical substance, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of composition or solid oral dosage form, preferably once or twice daily. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
During the past three decades significant advances have been made in the area of controlled drug delivery. This was, in part, due to the evolving disciplines of biopharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In a typical therapeutic regimen, the drug dose and the dosing interval are optimized to maintain drug concentration within the therapeutic window, thus ensuring efficacy while minimizing toxic side effects. Due to different physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of different active ingredients or substances, different types of release profiles like zero order, first order, pulsating profiles, etc. are required to develop an effective modified<br><br>
release dosage form. This warrants a flexible technology that can offer different kinds of release profiles.<br>
Modified release pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are designed to improve the delivery profile drugs to be internally administered to an animal, including humans. A modified release composition is typically used to improve the effects of administered substances by optimizing the kinetics of delivery, thereby increasing bio-availability, convenience, and patient compliance, as well as minimizing side effects associated with inappropriate immediate release rates such as a high initial release rate and, if undesired, uneven blood or tissue levels.<br>
There are a number of different modified release dosage forms available commercially and their methods of manufacturing are disclosed in books like Encyclopedia of Control Drug Delivery, Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology, Multiparticulate Oral Drug delivery and Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems.<br>
The most popular way to make modified release formulation is tablet. The tablet can be either monolithic matrix tablet or heterogeneous matrix tablet or tablets coated with release controlling membrane. These type of modified release formulations offer various advantages like simple manufacturing process, compact dosage form, use of conventional manufacturing equipments, high throughput, easy scale-up, economic, etc. However, such matrices do not provide adequate control over the release rate, instead resulting in a release that approximates first-order kinetics and may have a problem of dose dumping or burst release. However, since many modified release dosage forms contain comparatively large amounts of active ingredient or substance it is often necessary to include large amounts of suitable excipients to achieve appropriate controlled release profiles. Clearly, this will tend to increase the size of the dosage form. Tablet based matrix formulations have variations in gastric emptying rates and overall transit times leading to intra- and inter-subject variability of plasma profiles. Moreover these systems are also not suitable for modified release of active ingredients or substances with poor water solubility and active ingredients or substances with high water solubility and often difficult to combine two chemically incompatible active ingredients or substances in a singe unit.<br>
Another popular way to make modified release formulation is multiparticulate formulations based on pellets or spheroids. Pelletized products not only offer flexibility in dosage form design and development, but are also utilized to improve the safety and<br><br>
efficacy of active ingredients or substances. When pellets containing the active ingredient or substance are administered in vivo in the form of suspensions, capsules, or disintegrating tablets, they offer significant therapeutic advantages over single unit dosage forms like matrix-based tablets. Because pellets disperse freely in the gastrointestinal tract, they invariably maximize drug absorption, reduce peak plasma fluctuations, and minimize potential side effects without appreciably lowering drug bioavailability. Pellets also reduce variations in gastric emptying rates and overall transit times. Thus, intra- and inter-subject variability of plasma profiles, which are common with single unit regimens, is minimized. Another advantage of pellets over single-unit dosage forms is that high local concentrations of bioactive agents, which may inherently be irritative or anesthetic, can be avoided. When formulated as modified-release dosage forms, pellets are less susceptible to dose dumping than the reservoir-type, single unit formulations.<br>
Pellets also provide tremendous flexibility; for instance, pellets composed of different active ingredients or substances can be blended and formulated in a single dosage form. It allows the combined delivery of two or more active ingredients or substances that may or may not be chemically compatible, at the same site or at different sites with in the gastrointestinal tract. It also permits the combination of dosage form.<br>
But production of pellets generally involves expensive processes or highly specialized equipment. Equipment, which is readily available in a given setting due to its suitability for other applications such as coating, tends to obviate the need for the purchase of a new and specialized machine. Unfortunately, except in special cases, the pelletization processes are usually lengthy and expensive. Processing of a single batch may sometimes require hours or even days to be completed. Conversely, if a short processing time is desired, it becomes mandatory to utilize highly efficient and, at times, unique pieces of equipment that require the allocation of substantial capital investment. Extruders, spheronizers, and rotor granulators fall under this category.<br>
Although pellets could conceivably be coated in any tablet coating equipment, they generally require specialized coating machinery for optimum processability. Moreover, irrespective of the pelletization process, pellets are not uniform in size and generally represent a narrow mesh fraction, which could lead to fewer yields and increases the cost of the product.    Apart from this pellet based products may also be<br><br>
difficult to fill in the capsule if they differ in size or density, as it leads to segregation. Other factors that lead to segregation are static electricity and surface morphology. PRIOR ART<br>
US patent application 2003/0050620 Al discloses a controlled release delivery device, which comprises more than one vehicle for the controlled release of the drugs. The vehicle can be in the form of granules; pellets, beads or tablets filled in a housing. The vehicle essentially contains an amino acid, a polymer and a buffer.<br>
PCT application WO 98/29095 discloses a sustained release cisapride mini tablet formulation for oral administration. Cisapride is a poorly soluble ingredient or substance. The comprises of plurality of mini tablets containing cisapride with an organic acid. The tablets are capable of releasing cisapride at different sites of gastrointestinal tract in response to the pH environment. The tablets are coated with a pH dependent polymer, namely a copolymer of methacrylic acid and methacrylic acid esters.<br>
PCT application WO 00/71099 Al refers to a tablet or a multiparticulate controlled release selective serotinin reuptake inhibitor for oral administration. The formulation contains fluvoxamine, is suitable for once or twice daily administration and can comprise a blend of two or more population of particles, pellets or mini tablets. The composition or method to manufacture of said mini tablets is not described. PCT applications WO 03/041692, WO 02/102129 A2 and WO 99/22724 disclose information about sustained release formulations of venlafaxine hydrochloride. These formulations are based on pellets, beads or spheres. The pellets or core is prepared by either extrusion spheronization or layering techniques and a polymer layer is provided over the core for the sustained release of venlafaxine hydrochloride. PCT application WO 03/055475 and US patent application 2003/0059466 Al disclose about modified release formulations of venlafaxine hydrochloride. The formulations are tablet based and in the form of single unit.<br>
Venlafaxine, chemically named (±) l-[2-(dimethylamino)-l-(4-methoxyphenyl) ethyl]-cyclohexanol, is an antidepressant disclosed in EP-A-0 112 669. Presently venlafaxine hydrochloride is administered to adults as conventional immediate release tablets or as 24 hour extended-release multiparticulate capsules.<br>
Venlafaxine hydrochloride is highly soluble in water. It is known that it is very difficult to develop a pharmaceutical form with a very slow dissolution rate of freely soluble drug. Besides that, venlafaxine hydrochloride is polymorphic, so dissolution is<br><br>
dependent also on polymorphic form and particle size of particular polymorphic form. Therefore, it is a special task to develop such a pharmaceutical formulation that would sustain and control the dissolution of freely soluble drug over 24 hour period.<br>
EP-A-0 797 991 and WO 99/22724 disclose encapsulated venlafaxine extended release dosage formulation of venlafaxine hydrochloride, which provides in a single dose, a therapeutic blood serum level over a twenty four hour period. Gelatine capsules are filled with film coated spheroids containing venlafaxine hydrochloride. EP-A-0 797 991 states that numerous attempts to produce extended release tablets by hydrogel technology proved to be fruitless because the compressed tablets were either physically unstable (poor compressibility or capping problems) or dissolved too rapidly in dissolution studies. Typically, the tablets prepared as hydrogel sustained release formulations gave 40-50% dissolution at 2 hours, 60-70% dissolution at 4 hours and 85-100% dissolution at 8 hours (EP-A-0 797 991).<br>
