FIELD<br>
The field of this invention is flexible thermoplastic olefin blends.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Flexible thermoplastic olefin blends are used extensively in commercial applications, such as roofing membranes and geomembranes, automotive interior skins, and wall coverings. These applications typically require an excellent balance of flexibility, tensile strength, extensibility, self-hot tack, tear and puncture resistance, heat resistance, and low temperature flexibility.<br>
Flexible thermoplastic olefin blends are typically a blend of a polypropylene with an elastomer, such as, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR), ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM), elastomeric propylene-alpha olefin copolymers, and elastomeric ethylene-alpha olefin copolymers. The polypropylene typically provides tensile strength and heat resistance to the blend, while the elastomer provides flexibility, extensibility and good self-hot tack.<br>
PCT publication WO 00/69965 describes thermoplastic filled membranes utilizing propylene copolymers in combination with polypropylene. The propylene copolymers disclosed in this reference have both narrow composition distributions (that is uniform composition distribution) and narrow molecular weight distribution. It is believed that the use of propylene copolymers having narrow composition distribution limits the heat sealability window of the blend and reduces the compatibility between the polypropylene component and the elastomer component. For purposes of this invention, the heat sealability window is described as the temperature range within which the blend will exhibit an adequate seal initiation temperature, while at the same time maintaining sufficient self-hot tack strength.<br>
The seal initiation temperature can be lowered by increasing the relative amount of propylene-alpha olefin copolymer in the blend and/or by adding additional components such as process oils. However, these type of changes will also reduce the<br><br>
heat resistance, tensile strength and hot tack performance of articles made from the blend.<br>
What is desired is a flexible thermoplastic olefin blend that exhibits an excellent balance of flexibility, tensile strength, extensibility, and has abroad heat sealability window and good heat resistance. Surprisingly, the inventors have found that a flexible thermoplastic olefin blend of (a) an isotactic polypropylene, and (b) a propylene-alpha olefin copolymer having substantially isotactic propylene sequences and exhibiting a narrow molecular weight distribution provides better physical properties, such as puncture resistance and tear, higher ultimate seal strength and tensile strength; and a broad composition distribution providesAmproved compatibility between the blend components, which results in an excellent balance of flexibility, heat resistance, extensibility, tensile strength, tear resistance and improved heat sealability window^) It is further believed that, the use of a propylene-alpha olefin copolymer in accordance with the invention (which has a broad composition distribution in addition to a narrow MWD) allows for the development of high performance blends encompassing greater formulation flexibility and property balance with respect the compositional range of polypropylene and propylene-alpha olefin copolymers utilized.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

The Mw/Mn of the propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of the inventive blend are less than 3.5, preferably less than 3.0, more preferably less than 2.8, more preferably less than 2.5, and most preferably less than 2.3. Molecular weight distribution for all the polymers of the invention are determined in accordance with the description provided below.<br>
Gel Permeation Chromatography<br>
Molecular weight distribution of the polymers is determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a Polymer Laboratories PL-GPC-220 high temperature chromatographic unit equipped with four linear mixed bed columns (Polymer Laboratories (20-micron particle size)). The oven temperature is at 160°C with the autosampler hot zone at 160°C and the warm zone at 145°C. The solvent is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene containing 200 ppm 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol. The flow rate is 1.0 milliliter/minute and the injection size is 100 microliters. About 0.2% by weight solutions of the samples are prepared for injection by dissolving the sample in<br><br>
nitrogen purged 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene containing 200 ppm 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol for 2.5 hrs at 160°C with gentle mixing.<br>
The molecular weight determination is deduced by using ten narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards (from Polymer Laboratories, EasiCal PS1 ranging from 580 - 7,500,000 g/mole) in conjunction with their elution volumes. The equivalent molecular weights for the polymer of interest are determined by using appropriate Mark-Houwink coefficients for polypropylene (as described by Th.G. Scholte, N.L.J. Meijerink, H.M. Schoffeleers, and A.M.G. Brands, J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 29, 3763 - 3782 (1984)) and polystyrene (as described by E. P. Otocka, R. J. Roe, N. Y. Hellman, P. M. Muglia, Macromolecules, 4, 507 (1971)) in the Mark-Houwink equation:<br>
{N} = KMa<br>
where Kpp = 1.90E-04, app=0.725 and Kps = 1.26E-04, aps = 0.702.<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetrv<br>
Differential scanning caloximetry (DSC) is a common technique that can be used to examine the melting and crystallization of semi-crystalline polymers. General principles of DSC measurements and applications of DSC to studying semi-crystalline polymers are described in standard texts (for example, E. A. Turi, ed., Thermal Characterization of Polymeric Materials, Academic Press, 1981).<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis is determined using a model Q1000 DSC from TA Instruments, Inc. Calibration of the DSC is done as follows. First, a baseline is obtained by running the DSC from -90°C to 290°C without any sample in the aluminum DSC pan. Then 7 milligrams of a fresh indium sample is analyzed by heating the sample to 180°C, cooling the sample to 140°C at a cooling rate of 10°C/min followed by keeping the sample isothermally at 140°C for 1 minute, followed by heating the sample from 140°C to 180°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The heat of fusion and the onset of melting of the indium sample are determined and checked to be within 0.5°C from 156.6°C for the onset of melting and within 0.5 J/g from 28.71 J/g for the heat of fusion. Then deionized water is analyzed by cooling a small drop of fresh sample in the DSC pan from 25°C to -30°C at a cooling rate of<br><br>
10°C/min. The sample is kept isothermally at -30°C for 2 minutes and heated to 30°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The onset of melting is determined and checked to be within 0.5°C from 0°C.<br>
The selected polypropylene or propylene-alpha olefin samples are pressed into a thin film at a temperature of 190°C. About 5 to 8 mg of sample is weighed out and placed in the DSC pan. The lid is crimped on the pan to ensure a closed atmosphere. The sample pan is placed in the DSC cell and the heated at a high rate of about 100°C/min to a temperature of about 30°C above the melt temperature. The sample is kept at this temperature for about 3 minutes. Then the sample is cooled at a rate of 10°C/min to -40°C, and kept isothermally at that temperature for 3 minutes. Subsequently the sample is heated at a rate of 10°C/min until complete melting. The resulting enthalpy curves are analyzed for peak melt temperature (Tmax), onset and peak crystallization temperatures, heat of fusion and heat of crystallization, Tme, and" any other DSC analyses of interest.<br>
Tables A and B below show several physical properties for exemplary propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of the invention as compared to propylene-alpha olefin copolymers made with metallocene catalysts. All the copolymers are propylene-ethylene copolymers. The metallocene propylene-ethylene copolymer is designated P/E and are sometimes referred to hereinafter as P/E and/or P/E Copolymers. The propylene-ethylene copolymers made with Catalysts C, D, and F are designated P/E* and are sometimes referred to hereinafter as P/E* and/or P/E* Copolymers. The propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of the current invention preferably have a heat of fusion (Hf) of less than 50 Joules/gram, more preferably less than 40 Joules/gram, further more preferably less than 35 Joules/gram, and for blends exhibiting excellent flexibility, less than 30 Joules/gram and/or preferably show regio-errors at 14 and 16 ppm (as more folly-described below in the 13C NMR section). B-5 and B-6 from Table B show that at high comonomer levels, there is very little crystallinity in the polymer and the regio-errors may not be readily discernable.<br><br><br><br><br>
The Propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of the current invention exhibit broad melting points in the DSC heating curve. While not wishing to be held to any particular theory of operation, it is believed that this broad melting behavior is the result of a broad composition distribution (that is non-uniform). In Figures 1A and IB, for example, a relatively narrow melting peak is observed for a propylene/ethylene copolymer prepared using a metallocene catalyst as a comparative example (Comparative Example 1), while the melting peak for a similar copolymer of propylene and ethylene meeting the requirements of the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer of the current invention exhibits a relatively broader melting behavior. Such broad melting behavior is useful for providing a relatively low heat seal initiation temperature and a broad hot tack and/or heat sealability window. Thermal Properties<br>
Figure 2 further illustrate the thermal properties of the propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of this invention. In particular, Figure 2 illustrates that propylene-ethylene copolymers of this invention have a higher glass transition temperature (Tg) than do comparable metallocene-catalysed propylene polymers at a equivalent crystallinity. This means that propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of the invention, such as the<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The data obtained from TREF are expressed as a normalized plot of weight fraction as a function of elution temperature. The separation mechanism is analogous to that of copolymers of ethylene, whereby the molar content of the crystallizable component (ethylene) is the primary factor that determines the elution temperature. In the case of copolymers of propylene, it is the molar content of isotactic propylene units that primarily determines the elution temperature. Figure 3 is a representation of the typical type of distribution one would expect for a propylene-ethylene copolymer made with a metallocene polymer and an example of the distribution of a propylene-alpha olefin copolymer (in particular an P/E* copolymer) of the current invention.<br>
The shape of the metallocene curve in Figure 3 is typical for a homogeneous copolymer. The shape arises from the inherent, random incorporation of comonomer. A prominent characteristic of the shape of the curve is the tailing at lower elution temperature compared to the sharpness or steepness of the curve at the higher elution temperatures. A statistic that reflects this type of asymmetry is skewness. Equation 1 mathematically represents the skewness index, Six, as a measure of this asymmetry. Equation 1. <br>
The value, TM3X is defined as the temperature of the largest weight fraction eluting between 50 and 90°C in the TREF curve. T1 and Wi are the elution temperature and weight fraction respectively of an arbitrary, ith fraction in the TREF distribution. The distributions have been normalized (the sum of the W1 equals 100%) with respect to the total area of the curve eluting above 30°C. Thus, the index reflects only the shape of the crystallized polymer and any uncrystallized polymer (polymer still in solution at or below 30°C) has been omitted from the calculation shown in Equation 1.<br><br>
In addition to the skewness index, another measure of the breadth of the TREF curve (and therefore a measure of the breadth of the composition distribution of a copolymer is the Median Elution Temperature of the final eluting quartile (TJVM). The Median Elution Temperature is the median elution temperature of the 25% weight fraction of the TREF distribution (the polymer still in solution at or below 30°C is excluded from the calculation as discussed above for skewness index) that elutes last or at the highest temperatures. The Upper Temperature Quartile Range (TM4-TMax) defines the difference between the Median Elution Temperature of the final eluting quartile and the peak temperature TM3X- Referring to Table 7, the comparative copolymers made with a metallocene catalyst exhibit an Upper Temperature Quartile Range of from 1.5°C to 4.0°C, with the majority being less than 3°C. The propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of our current invention have broad composition distributions indicated in part by an Upper Temperature Quartile Range of greater than 4.0°C, preferably at least 4.5°C, more preferably at least 5°C, further more preferably at least 6°C, most preferably at least 7°C, and in some instances, at least 8°C and even at least 9°C. In general, the higher the value for the Upper Temperature Quartile Range, the broader the composition distribution of the copolymer. 13CNMR<br>
The propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of this invention are further characterized as having substantially isotactic propylene sequences. "Substantially isotactic propylene sequences" and similar terms mean that the sequences have an isotactic triad (mm) measured by 13C NMR of greater than 0.85, preferably greater than 0.90, more preferably greater than 0.92 and most preferably greater than 0.93. Isotactic triads are well known in the art and are described in, for example, USP 5,504,172 and WO 00/01745 which refer to the isotactic sequence in terms of a triad unit in the copolymer molecular chain determined by 13C NMR spectra. NMR spectra are determined as follows.<br>
13C NMR spectroscopy is one of a number of techniques known in the art of measuring comonomer incorporation into a polymer. An example of this technique is described for the determination of comonomer content for ethylene/oc-olefm copolymers in Randall (Journal of Macromolecular Science, Reviews in Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics, C29 (2 &amp; 3), 201 - 317 (1989)). The basic<br><br>
procedure for determining the comonomer content of an olefin interpolymer involves obtaining the 13C NMR spectrum under conditions where the intensity of the peaks corresponding to the different carbons in the sample is directly proportional to the total number of contributing nuclei in the sample. Methods for ensuring this proportionality are known in the art and involve allowance for sufficient time for relaxation after a pulse, the use of gated-decoupling techniques, relaxation agents, and the like. The relative intensity of a peak or group of peaks is obtained in practice from its computer-generated integral. After obtaining the spectrum and integrating the peaks, those peaks associated with the comonomer are assigned. This assignment can be made by reference to known spectra or literature, or by synthesis and analysis of model   . compounds, or by the use of isotopically labeled comonomer. The mole % comonomer can be determined by the ratio of the integrals corresponding to the number of moles of comonomer to the integrals corresponding to the number of moles of all of the monomers in the interpolymer, as described in Randall, for example.<br>
The data is collected using a Varian UNITY Plus 400MHz NMR spectrometer, corresponding to a   C resonance frequency of 100.4 MHz. Acquisition parameters are selected to ensure quantitative   C data acquisition in the presence of the relaxation agent. The data is acquired using gated *H decoupling, 4000 transients per data file, a 7sec pulse repetition delay, spectral width of 24,200Hz and a file size of 32K data points, with the probe head heated to 130°C. The sample is prepared by adding approximately 3mL of a 50/50 mixture of tetrachloroethane-d2/orthodichlorobenzene that is 0.025M in chromium acetylacetonate (relaxation agent) to 0.4g sample in a 10mm NMR tube. The headspace of the tube is purged of oxygen by displacement with pure nitrogen. The sample is dissolved and homogenized by heating the tube and its contents to 150°C with periodic refluxing initiated by heat gun.<br>
Following data collection, the chemical shifts are internally referenced to the mmmm pentad at 21.90 ppm.<br>
For propylene/ethylene copolymers, the following procedure is used to calculate the percent ethylene in the polymer. Integral regions are determined as follows:<br><br><br><br>
by the total methyls at 14-22 ppm attributable to propylene. The mole percent of the regio-error peaks is the mole fraction times 100.<br>
Isotacticity at the triad level (mm) is determined from the integrals of the mm triad (22.70-21.28 ppm), the mr triad (21.28-20.67 ppm) and the rr triad (20.67-19.74). The mm isotacticity is determined by dividing the intensity of the mm triad by the sum of the mm, mr, and rr triads. For ethylene copolymers the mr region is corrected by subtracting 37.5-39 ppm integral. For copolymers with other monomers that produce peaks in the regions of the mm, mr, and rr triads, the integrals for these regions are similarly corrected by subtracting the intensity of the interfering peak using standard NMR techniques, once the peaks have been identified. This can be accomplished, for example, by analysis of a series of copolymers of various levels of monomer incorporation, by literature assignments, by isotopic labeling, or other means which are known in the art.<br>
The   C NMR peaks corresponding to a regio-error at about 14.6 and about 15.7 ppm are believed to be the result of stereoselective 2,1-insertion errors of propylene units into the growing polymer chain. In a typical polymer of this invention, these peaks are of about equal intensity, and they represent 0.02 to 7 mole percent of the propylene insertions into the homopolymer or copolymer chain. For some embodiments of this invention, they represent 0.005 to 20 mole % or more of the propylene insertions. In general, higher levels of regio-errors lead to a lowering of the melting point and the modulus of the polymer, while lower levels lead to a higher melting point and a higher modulus of the polymer.<br>
While not wanting to be limited to thereby or to any theory of operation, it is believed that the relatively high levels of regio-errors present in the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer of the invention results in more flexible and resilient blends. It<br>
should be appreciated that the nature and level of comonomers other than propylene also control the melting point and modulus of the copolymer. The level of regio-errors can be controlled by several means, including the polymerization temperature, the concentration of propylene and other monomers in the process, the type of (co)monomers, and other factors. Various individual catalyst structures may inherently produce more or less regio-errors than other catalysts. For example, in Table A above, the propylene homopolymer prepared with Catalyst C has a higher level of regio-errors<br><br>
and a lower melting point than the propylene homopolymer prepared with Catalyst D, which has a higher melting point. Preferably, the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer of the invention has more regio-errors than 3 mole % of the propylene insertions, more ►referably more than 5 mole % of the propylene insertions, still more preferably more han 6 mole % of the propylene insertions, and most preferably more than 10 mole % )f the propylene insertions. The regio-errors may comprise threo, erythro or a combination thereof. Preferably, the majority of the regio-errors result from threo errors.<br>
It should be appreciated by the skilled artisan that the mole % of regio-errors for an inventive polymer which is a component of a blend refers to the mole % of regio-errors of the particular inventive polymer component of the blend that is the particular inventive polymer, and not as a mole % of the overall blend.<br>

The above described metal complexes of the invention are typically activated in various ways to yield catalyst compounds having a vacant coordination site that will coordinate, insert, and polymerize addition polymerizable monomers, especially olefm(s). For the purposes of this patent specification and appended claims, the term "activator11 is defined to be any compound or component or method which can activate any of the catalyst compounds of the invention as described above. Non-limiting examples of activators include a Lewis acid or a non-coordinating ionic activator or ionizing activator or any other compounds including Lewis bases, organometal compounds and<br><br>
combinations thereof that can convert a neutral catalyst compound to a catalytically active species.<br>
One suitable class of activator or cocatalyst are alumoxanes, also referred to as alkylaluminoxanes. Alumoxanes are well known activators for use with metallocene type catalyst compounds to prepare addition polymerization catalysts. There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxane and modified alumoxanes, non-limiting examples of which are described in US Patents 4,665,208,4,952,540, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924, 018, 4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,308,815, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157,137, 5,103,031, 5,391,793, 5,391,529, 5,693,838, 5,731,253, 5,731,451 5,744,656; European publications EP-A-561476, EP-A-279586 and EP-A-594218; and PCT publication WO 94/10180.<br>

Preferred among the foregoing activators are ammonium cation containing salts, especially those containing trihydrocarbyl- substituted ammonium cations containing one or two CKMO alkyl groups, especially methylbis(octadecyl)ammonium- and methylbis(tetradecyl)-ammonium- cations. It is further understood that the cation may comprise a mixture of hydrocarbyl groups of differing lengths. For example, the protonated ammonium cation derived from the commercially available long chain amine comprising a mixture of two Ci4, C\e or Qg alkyl groups and one methyl group. Such amines are available from Witco Corp., under the trade name Kemamine™ T9701, and from Akzo-Nobel under the trade name Armeen™ M2HT.<br><br>
It is also within the scope of this invention that the above described metal complexes can be combined with more than one of the activators or activation methods described above. The mole ratio of the activator component(s) to the metal complex in the catalyst compositions suitably is in the range of between 0.3:1 to 2000:1, preferably 1:1 to 800:1, and most preferably 1:1 to 500:1. Where the activator is an ionizing activator such as those based on the anion tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron or the strong Lewis acid trispentafluorophenylboron, the mole ratio of the metal or metalloid of the activator component to the metal complex is preferably in the range of between 0.3:1 to 3:1.<br>
In addition to the metal complex and cocatalyst or activator, it is contemplated that certain tertiary components or mixtures thereof may be added to the catalyst composition or the reaction mixture in order to obtain improved catalyst performance or other benefit. Examples of such tertiary components include scavengers designed to react with contaminants in the reaction mixture to prevent catalyst deactivation. Suitable tertiary components may also activate or assist in activation of one or more of the metal complexes employed in the catalyst composition.<br>
Examples include Lewis acids, such as trialkylaluminum compounds, dialkylaluminum aryloxides, alkylaluminum diaryloxides, dialkylaluminum amides, alkylaluminum diamides, dialkylaluminum tri(hydrocarbylsilyl)amides, and alkylaluminum bis(tri(hydrocarbylsilyl)amides).<br>
The propylene-alpha olefin copolymers are preferably made using a solution polymerization process. Examples of solution processes that are suitably employed with the catalyst compositions of the present invention are described in USP's 4,271,060, 5,001,205, 5,236,998, and 5,589,555. Highly preferably the solution process is<br>
ethylene/propylene copolymerization operated in a continuous or semi-continuous manner<br>
with high propylene and ethylene conversion. Highly preferably such process is conducted at a temperature greater than or equal to 100 °C, more preferably greater than or equal to 110 °C, and most preferably greater than or equal to 115 °C.<br><br>
Suitable addition polymerization processes wherein the present catalyst compositions may be employed include solution, gas phase, slurry phase, high pressure, or combinations thereof.<br>
If the propylene-alpha olefin copolymers are made in a gas phase, high pressure and/or slurry polymerization process, then the above described catalyst compounds and catalyst compositions preferably are combined with one or more support materials or carriers using one of the support methods well known in the art or as described below. Either the catalyst composition or the individual components thereof may be in a supported form, for example deposited on, contacted with, or incorporated within a support or carrier.<br>
The terms "support" or "carrier" are used interchangeably and are any porous or non-porous support material, preferably a porous support material, for example, inorganic oxides, carbides, nitrides, and halides. Other carriers include resinous support materials such as polystyrene, a functionalized or crosslinked organic supports, such as polystyrene divinyl benzene polyolefins or polymeric compounds, or any other organic or inorganic support material and the like, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The Polypropylene<br>
The polypropylene of the invention can comprise a random propylene copolymer, a propylene impact copolymer, a propylene homopolymer, a polypropylene copolymer and mixtures thereof. The polypropylene exhibits a peak melting point (Tmax)&gt; as determined by DSC, of at least 120°C, preferably at least 130°C, more preferably at least 140°C, and for applications which require particularly high heat resistance, a Tmax of at least 150°C, preferably at least 160°C. The polypropylene is stereoregular, preferably having isotactic stereoregular propylene sequences. The polypropylene exhibits a heat of fusion higher than the heat of fusion for the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer of the invention.<br>
The polypropylene can be prepared by typical polypropylene production processes, known to one of ordinary skill in the art and can be made using a variety of catalysts, including metallocene and Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Polypropylenes made using Ziegler-<br><br>
Natta catalysts are preferred due to their relatively low cost to produce, their high level of isotactic sequences and high crystallinities. The polypropylenes typically have molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn) of at least 3.0, preferably at least 3.5, further more preferably at least 4.0, and for some applications, at least 4.5, and preferably at least 5.<br>
The polypropylene typically has a melt flow rate of from 0.1 g/lOmin to 50 g/10 min.  Preferably, the ratio of the intrinsic viscosity of the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer to the intrinsic viscosity of the polypropylene is typically between 0.5 and 3, more preferably between 0.8 and 2, further more preferably between 0.8 and 1.5. The intrinsic viscosity can be determined in accordance with ASTM D5225-98.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, polypropylene copolymers are used for the polypropylene component of the blend. In these aspects a random propylene copolymer is preferred. If a propylene-ethylene copolymer makes up the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer component of the blend, then a random propylene copolymer incorporating units derived from ethylene preferably is utilized to increase the compatibility between the propylene-ethylene copolymer component and the polypropylene component of the blend. Increasing the compatibility will provide a blend exhibiting better physical properties, as discussed earlier. The polypropylene copolymer, preferably has from 0.5 to 6 percent by weight units derived from an alpha olefin, with the alpha-olefin preferably matching the alpha-olefin comprising the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer component of the blend. For example, if a propylene-ethylene copolymer makes up the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer of the blend, then the polypropylene component preferably is a polypropylene copolymer having from 0.5 to 6 percent by weight units derived from ethylene, more preferably it is a random propylene copolymer having from 0.5 to 6 percent by weight units derived from ethylene.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the polypropylene is a propylene impact copolymer. The matrix may be either a propylene homopolymer or a polypropylene copolymer. For applications requiring an excellent balance of physical properties, a polypropylene copolymer preferably is utilized. For applications demanding the highest heat resistance, a propylene homopolymer preferably utilized. The propylene impact copolymer may be either a physical blend of the matrix polymer and the elastomer<br><br>
polymer or it may be made by an in-reactor blend manufactured by an in-reactor process as known to one of ordinary skill in the art. As described above for the polypropylene copolymers, the monomers used to construct the propylene impact copolymer are selected to be compatible with the comonomers present in the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer component of the blend. For ease of manufacturing, the matrix typically is a propylene-ethylene, a propylene-ethylene-butene, or a propylene-butene copolymer, with propylene-ethylene copolymer matrixes being more preferred. For similar reasons, the elastomer phase is typically a propylene-ethylene, propylene-ethylene-butene or a propylene-butene rubber. Preferably, the propylene impact copolymer is an in-reactor blend, due to the enhanced rubber dispersion that these blends exhibit. Preferably, the elastomer phase is greater than 10 percent by weight, more preferably greater than 15 percent by weight, most preferably greater than 20 percent by weight of the impact copolymer. The rubber phase of the propylene impact copolymer has similar properties to discussed below forthe elastomer component.<br>
The Elastomer Component<br>
The blend of the invention optionally contains an elastomer component in addition to the propylene-alpha olefin. Typical elastomers that can be utilized include olefinic copolymers (such as ethylene-alpha olefin copolymers, propylene-alpha olefin copolymers (such as ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR)), ethylene-propylene-diene copolymers (EPDM)), fimctionalized copolymers (such as ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers (EAA), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), block copolymer rubbers (such as styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymers (SBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymers (SIS), styrene-ethylene-butene-styrene copolymers (SEBS) and other elastomers known to one of ordinary skill in the art. SEPS, SEBS, and other styrenic block copolymers preferably are incorporated into blends for use in soft-touch applications.<br>
The elastomer component preferably has a glass transition temperature (Tge)which is lower than the glass transition temperature of the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer (Tgp), more preferably Tgp is at least 5°C higher than Tge. Glass transition temperature is determined by DSC analysis in accordance with procedures known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the elastomer component preferably is not substantially miscible<br><br>
in the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer or the polypropylene. For the purposes of this invention, two polymers are not substantially miscible if, after being blended together, the blend exhibits at least two separate identifiable glass transition temperatures (as measured by DSC) that correspond to the glass transition temperatures of the non-blended polymers.<br>

General 1 Gallon Continuous Solution Propylene/Ethylene Copolymerization Procedure (Examples 1-10 and comparative examples)<br>
Purified toluene solvent, ethylene, hydrogen, and propylene are supplied to a 1 gallon reactor equipped with a jacket for temperature control and an internal thermocouple. The solvent feed to the reactor is measured by a mass-flow controller. A variable speed diaphragm pump controls the solvent flow rate and increases the solvent pressure to the reactor. The propylene feed is measured by a mass flow meter and the flow is controlled by a variable speed diaphragm pump. At the discharge of the pump, a side stream is taken to provide flush flows for the catalyst injection line and the reactor agitator. The remaining solvent is combined with ethylene and hydrogen and delivered to the reactor. The ethylene stream is measured with a mass flow meter and controlled with a Research Control valve. A mass flow controller is used to deliver hydrogen into the ethylene stream at the outlet of the ethylene control valve. The<br><br>
temperature of the solvent/monomer is controlled by use of a heat exchanger before entering the reactor. This stream enters the bottom of the reactor. The catalyst component solutions are metered using pumps and mass flow meters, and are combined with the catalyst flush solvent. This stream enters the bottom of the reactor, but in a different port than the monomer stream. The reactor is run liquid-full at 500 psig with vigorous stirring. The process flow is in from the bottom and out of the top. All exit lines from the reactor are steam traced and insulated. Polymerization is stopped with the addition of a small amount of water, and other additives and stabilizers can be added at this point. The stream flows through a static mixer and a heat exchanger in order to heat the solvent/polymer mixture. The solvent and unreacted monomers are removed at reduced pressure, and the product is recovered by extrusion using a devolatilizing extruder. The extruded strand is cooled under water and chopped into pellets. The operation of the reactor is controlled with a process control computer.<br>
Example 1 Propylene/Ethylene Polymerization Using Metallocene Catalyst A (Comparative)<br>
The general procedure for the 1 gallon continuous solution polymerization outlined above was employed. A catalyst solution containing 2.6 ppm Zr from Catalyst A was prepared and added to a 4 L catalyst storage tank. This solution was combined in a continuous stream with a continuous stream of a solution containing Armeenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate in toluene and a continuous stream of a solution of PMAO-IP in toluene to give a ratio of total Ti:B:Al of 1:1.2:30. The activated catalyst solution was fed continuously into the reactor at a rate sufficient to maintain the reactor temperature at approximately 80° C and a polymer production rate of approximately 3 pounds an hour. The polymer solution was continuously removed from the reactor exit and was contacted with a solution containing 100 ppm of water for each part of the polymer solution, and polymer stabilizers (that is , 1000 ppm Irgaphos 168 and 1000 ppm Irganox 1010 per part of the polymer). The resulting exit stream was mixed, heated in a heat exchanger, and the mixture was introduced into a separator where the molten polymer was separated from the solvent and unreacted monomers. The resulting molten polymer was extruded and chopped into pellets after being cooled in a<br><br>
water bath. For this example, the propylene to ethylene ratio was 22.0. Product samples were collected over 1 hour time periods, after which time the melt flow rate was determined for each sample. Figure 6 is a 13C NMR of Comparative Example 1, and it demonstrates the absence of regio-error peaks in the region around 15 ppm.<br>

EXAMPLE 7<br>
Table 7 is a summary showing the skewness index, Six, for inventive and prior art samples. All of the samples were prepared and measured as described in Table C in the Description of the Preferred Embodiments and entitled Parameters Used for TREF. The copolymers of the invention have a skewness index greater than (-1.2), preferably greater than -1.0, more preferably greater than -0.8, and further more preferably greater than -0.7 and in some instances greater than -0.60. The skewness index of the propylene-ethylene copolymers of our invention, are indicative of the broad composition distribution of the copolymers. The results from Table 7 are represented graphically in Figure 12.<br>
The inventive examples show unusual and unexpected results when examined by TREF. The distributions tend to cover a large elution temperature range while at the same time giving a prominent, narrow peak. In addition, over a wide range of ethylene incorporation, the peak temperature, TMax, is near 60°C to 65°C. In the prior art, for similar levels of ethylene incorporation, this peak moves to higher elution temperatures with lower ethylene incorporation.<br>
For conventional metallocene catalysts the approximate relationship of the mole fraction of propylene, Xp, to the TREF elution temperature for the peak maximum, TMax , is given by the following equation:<br>
Loge(Xp) = - 289/(273 + Tmax) +0.74 For the inventive copolymers, the natural log of the mole fraction of propylene, LnP, is greater than that of the conventional metallocenes, as shown in this equation:<br>
LnP &gt; - 289/(273 + Tmax) +0.75<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
The following example shows some of the physical properties that typically are exhibited by the propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of the current invention and are indicative of the broad composition distribution of the P/E* copolymers.<br><br>
DSC analysis shows that propylene-ethylene copolymers produced by a solution polymerization process using a nonmetallocene, metal-centered, pyridal-amine ligand catalyst have melting behavior that differs in surprising ways from propylene/ethylene copolymers produced by metallocene polymerization processes that are known in the art. The different melting behavior of these copolymers compared to that of copolymers that are known in the art not only demonstrates the novelty of these materials, but it is also believed lead to the advantages seen when the propylene-ethylene copolymers are incorporated into the blends of the current invention. The novel aspects of the melting behavior of these copolymers and their associated utility are discussed below, after first describing the DSC analysis method used for this example.<br>
Any volatile materials (for example, solvent or monomer) are removed from the polymer prior to DSC analysis. A small amount of polymer, typically five to fifteen milligrams, is accurately weighed into an aluminum DSC pan with lid. Either hermetic or standard type pans are suitable. The pan containing the sample is then placed on one side of the DSC cell, with an empty pan with lid placed on the reference side of the DSC cell. The DSC cell is then closed, with a slow purge of nitrogen gas through the cell during the test. Then the sample is subjected to a programmed temperature sequence that typically has both isothermal segments and segments where the temperature is programmed to increase or decrease at a constant rate. Results that are presented here were all obtained using heat-flux type DSC instruments manufactured by TA Instruments (for example, Model 2910 DSC). The measurement principles underlying heat-flux DSC are described on page 16 of Turi, ibid. The primary signals generated by such instruments are temperature (units: °C) and differential heat flow (units: watts) into or out of the sample (that is, relative to the reference) as a function of elapsed time. Melting is endothermic and involves excess heat flow into the sample relative to the reference, whereas crystallization is exothermic and involves excess heat flow out of the sample. These instruments are calibrated using indium and other narrow-melting standards. Calibration ensures that the temperature scale is correct and for the proper correction of unavoidable heat losses.<br>
Temperature programs for DSC analysis of semi-crystalline polymers involve several steps. Although the temperature programs used to generate the data presented<br><br>
here differed in some details, the critical steps were maintained constant throughout. The first step is an initial heating to a temperature sufficient to completely melt the sample; for polypropylene homopolymers and copolymers, this is 210° C or higher. This first step also helps insure excellent thermal contact of the polymer sample with the pan. Although details of this first step differed for data presented here — for example, the rate of heating, the upper temperature, and the hold time at the upper temperature - in all cases the choices were sufficient to achieve the principal objectives of this step, of bringing all samples to a common completely melted starting point with good thermal contact. The second step involves cooling at a constant rate of 10° C/min from an upper temperature of at least 210° C to a lower temperature of 0° C or less. The lower temperature is chosen to be at or slightly below the glass transition temperature of the particular propylene polymer. The rate of crystallization becomes very slow at the glass transition temperature; hence, additional cooling will have little effect on the extent of crystallization. This second step serves to provide a standard crystallization condition, prior to examining subsequent melting behavior. After a brief hold at this lower temperature limit, typically one to three minutes, the third step is commenced. The third step involves heating the sample from a temperature of 0° C or lower (that is, the final temperature of the previous step) to 210° C or higher at a constant rate of 10° C/min. This third step serves to provide a standard melting condition, as preceded by a standard crystallization condition. All the melting behavior results presented here were obtained from this third step, that is, from the second melting of the sample.<br>
The output data from DSC consists of time (sec), temperature (°C), and heat flow (watts). Subsequent steps in the analysis of melting endotherms are as follows. First, the heat flow is divided by the sample mass to give specific heat flow (units: W/g). Second, a baseline is constructed and subtracted from the specific heat flow to<br>
give baseline-subtracted heat flow. For the analyses presented here, a straight-line baseline is used. The lower temperature limit for the baseline is chosen as a point on the high temperature side of the glass transition. The upper temperature limit for the baseline is chosen as a temperature about 5-10° C above the completion of the melting endotherm. Although a straight-line baseline is theoretically not exact, it offers greater<br><br>
ease and consistency of analysis, and the error introduced is relatively minor for samples with specific heats of melting of about 15-20 Joules per gram or higher. Employing a straight-line baseline in lieu of a more theoretically correct baseline does not substantively affect any of the results or conclusions presented below, although the fine details of the results would be expected to change with a different prescription of the instrumental baseline.<br>
There are a number of quantities that can be extracted from DSC melting data. Quantities that are particularly useful in demonstrating differences or similarities among different polymers are: (1) the peak melting temperature, Tmax (°C), which is the temperature at which the baseline-subtracted heat flow is a maximum (here the convention is that heat flow into the sample is positive); (2) the specific heat of melting, Ahm (J/g), which is the area under the melting endotherm obtained by integrating the baseline-subtracted heat flow (dq/dt) (W/g) versus time between the baseline limits; (3) the specific heat flow (dq/dt)max (W/g) at the peak melting temperature; (4) the peak specific heat flow normalized by the specific heat of melting, {(dq/dt)max/Ahm} (sec-1); (5) the first moment Ti of the melting endotherm, defined and calculated as described below; (6) the variance Vi (°C ) of the melting endotherm relative to the first moment Ti, defined and calculated as described below; and (7) the square root of the variance,<br>
■J  try<br>
Vi    (°C), which is one measure of the breadth of the melting endotherm.<br>
Treatment of the melting endotherm as a distribution is a useful way to quantify its breadth. The quantity that is distributed as a function of temperature is the baseline-subtracted heat flow (dq/dt). That this is also a distribution of temperature is made explicit using the calculus chain rule, (dq/dt) = (dq/Dt)(Dt/dt) where (Dt/dt) is the heating rate. The standard definition of the first moment Ti of this distribution is given by the following equation, where the integrations are carried out between the baseline limits. All integrations are most reliably performed as (dq/dt) versus time, as opposed to the alternative (dq/Dt) versus temperature. In the following equation, (dq/dt) and T<br>
are the specific heat flow and temperature at time t<br>
JT-(dq/dt)dt<br>
Udqldi)dt<br>
The variance Vi relative to the first moment is then standardly defined as:<br><br><br>
Both Vj and Vi    are measures of the breadth of the melting endotherm.<br>
Results of DSC analyses of both inventive and comparative polymers are shown in Table 8-1. All the samples are propylene-ethylene copolymers;, with the exception of samples 1-4 and 17 which are homopolymers. Polymers 8-1-1 to -4 were made with Catalyst C, polymers 8-1-5 to -16 were made using Catalyst D in a solution process. Polymers 8-1-17 to -27 were made with Catalyst A in a solution process. An idea of the precision of the experimental method plus the data analysis procedure is provided by replicates (polymers 17, 20, and 22) and by the consistency of results for sets of polymers that were synthesized under nearly identical conditions (polymers 1-4, 7-9, 10-12, and 13-16).<br>
Differences in melting behavior are most easily seen with the aid of figures. Figure 13 compares the melting endotherms of Samples 8 and 22a. These two propylene-ethylene copolymers have nearly equivalent heats of melting and mole percent ethylene contents, about 71 J/g and 8 mole%. However, despite these similarities, the melting behavior of the inventive copolymer (Sample 8) is surprisingly different than that of the comparative copolymer (Sample 22a). The melting endotherm of Sample 8 is shifted towards lower temperatures and significantly broadened, when comparing at equivalent heat of melting. These changes in melting behavior are unique to and characteristic of the propylene-ethylene copolymers used in the invention.<br>
Comparison at equivalent heats of melting is particularly meaningful and relevant. This is because equivalent heats of melting implies approximately equal levels of crystallinity, which in turn implies that the room temperature moduli should be similar. Therefore, at a given modulus or stiffness, the propylene-ethylene copolymers of this invention possess usefully broadened melting ranges compared to<br>
typical metallocene propylene-alpha olefin copolymers.<br>
Figures 14-18, which are derived from the results in Table 8-1, further highlight the differences in melting behavior for the propylene-ethylene copolymers of this<br><br>
invention compared to metallocene propylene-alpha olefin copolymers. For all five of these figures, quantities are plotted as functions of the heat of melting, which as described above is an especially meaningful and relevant basis for making intercomparisons and inferring utility. For these plots, data have broken into two series based on the catalyst type used to make the polymer, either metallocene or nonmetallocene type.<br>
Figure 14 demonstrates how the peak melting temperature is shifted towards lower temperature for the propylene-ethylene copolymers of this invention. All the changes in melting behavior, of which this shift in peak melting temperature is but one example, imply that there are differences in the crystalline structure at the level of crystal lamellae or other type of primary crystalline elements. In turn, such differences in crystalline structure can most reasonably be attributed to differences in microstructure, for example, the different type of mis-insertion errors that characterize the propylene-ethylene copolymers of this invention.<br>
Figure 15 which shows a plot of the temperature TV/oC at which there is approximately 1% residual crystallinity, demonstrates another surprising aspect of the melting behavior of the propylene-ethylene copolymers of this invention. The factor that is used to convert specific heat of melting into nominal weight% crystallinity is 165 J/g =100 weight% crystallinity. (Use of a different conversion factor could change details of the results but not substantive conclusions.) With this conversion factor, the total crystallinity of a sample (units: weight% crystallinity) is calculated as 100% times Ahm divided by 165 J/g. And, with this conversion factor, 1% residual crystallinity corresponds to 1.65 J/g. Therefore, Tio/oC is defined as the upper limit for partial integration of the melting endotherm such that Ahm minus the partial integral equals 1.65 J/g, where the same lower limit and baseline are used for this partial integration as for the complete integration. Surprisingly, for the P/E* copolymers as compared to metallocene-catalyzed copolymers, this 1% residual crystallinity temperature shifts downward less rapidly with increase in ethylene level (that is , with decrease in the heat of melting). This behavior of Tio/oC is similar to that of the final temperature of melting<br><br>
Figure 16, which shows the variance relative to the first moment of the melting endotherm as a function of the heat of melting, demonstrates directly the greater breadth of the melting endotherm for the propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of this invention.<br>
Figure 17, which shows the maximum heat flow normalized by the heat of melting as a function of the heat of melting, further demonstrates the broadening of the melting endotherm. This is because, at equivalent heat of melting, a lower peak value implies that the distribution must be broadened to give the same area. Roughly approximating the shape of these melting curves as a triangle, for which the area is given by the formula one-half times the base times the height, then bl/b2 = h2/hl. The inventive copolymers show as much as a four-fold decrease in height, implying a significant increase in breadth,<br>
Figure 18 illustrates a useful aspect of the broader melting range of the propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of the invention, namely that the rate at which the last portion of crystallinity disappears (units: weight% crystallinity per °C) is significantly lower than for metallocene copolymers.<br>
Together the data in Table 8-2 demonstrate in practical terms the physical properties that are exhibited by a propylene-alpha olefin copolymer having a broad composition distribution and the other requirements of the propylene-alpha olefin copolymer of our inventive blend. Entries in Table 8-2 illustrate: (1) the extent to which a greater fraction of melting occurs at lower temperatures, which is important for heat seal and bonding applications, and which is greater for the propylene-ethylene copolymers of the invention; and (2) the extent to which crystallinity remains at higher temperatures and the rate at which the final portion of crystallinity disappears, which can be important for fabrication operations such as thermoforming, foaming, blow molding, and the like, both of which are greater for the propylene-ethylene copolymers of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Examples 9 and 10 demonstrate that the propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of the current invention have flexible and elastic characteristics as compared to metallocene copolymers. Table 9 reports the details behind Figures 7 and 8. All these samples were made by a solution polymerization process. Homopolymer samples 9-1 and 9-12 were made with catalysts A and C, respectively. Comparative metallocene propylene-ethylene copolymer samples 9-2 through 9-11 were made with Catalyst A. P/E* copolymer samples 9-13 through 9-16 were made with catalyst D. Mole % ethylene was determined by 13C-NMR. Tmax was determined by DSC, second heating scan at 10°C/min. Flexural modulus values in Table 9 are either from: (a) direct measurement on injection molded specimens by ASTM D790 (samples marked by asterisks); or (b) measurement of tensile modulus on compression molded microtensile specimens by ASTM D638 then use of established correlations between tensile and flexural moduli to estimate the flexural modulus; or (c) estimation of flexural modulus from correlations of flexural modulus to heat of fusion by DSC. Haze was measured on 10 mil thick compression molded films by ASTM D1003 using Model XC211 Haze-Gard System manufactured by Pacific Scientific, Gardner/Neotec Instrument Division. Films for haze measurements were compression molded at 200°C with six minute preheat at low pressure plus four minute molding at about 200 psi pressure, followed by ten minute cooling to 30°C at 200 psi pressure. Mylar<br><br>
film was used as backing in contact with the polymer in order to obtain films with minimal surface haze. After molding, films or other specimens were aged two weeks or longer at room temperature prior to mechanical testing or haze testing.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Figure 9 report certain elasticity data for the polymers of this invention and certain comparative polymers. Table 10-1 describes the elastomers.<br>
The test samples were compression molded specimens. Polymer in pellet form was compression molded at 190°C into 1.5 mm thick sheets. The sheets were cooled<br><br>
by placing each between two platens at 25°C under light pressure. The specimens were allowed to age for at least seven days at ambient conditions before testing.<br>
Tensile "dog bones" were punched out of the sheets using a knife shaped according to ASTM D-1708. The first melting behavior was measured by cutting out a 5 to 10 mg piece of the aged specimen. The specimen was loaded into an aluminum pan and analyzed in a differential scanning calorimeter manufactured by TA Instruments Incorporated. Heating spanned -50 to 230°C at 10°C/min.<br>
The specimens were tested in uniaxial tension with a mechanical test device (Instron Corp.) fitted with pneumatic grips. The engineering strain rate was 400% per minute. Both strain to break and multicycle loading strain histories were used. In the case of multicycle loading, specimens were loaded and unloaded to various strains (100 to 900%) for up to 10 cycles. No pause was used between successive cycles.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
The following Examples show the improved physical properties exhibited by selected formulations of the inventive blend. The propylene-alpha olefin copolymers of this example have similar molecular weight distributions as the P/E* copolymers of examples 2 through 6, and also exhibit similar broad composition distributions. The<br><br>
blends include both two-component and three component inventive blends. Tables 11-1 and 11-2 show the physical properties for several two component and three component blends versus a comparative blend made using a two Ziegler-Natta polymers.<br>
General Continuous Loop Solution Propylene-Ethylene Copolymerization<br>
Procedure (Examples 11)<br>
The P/E* copolymers were made according to the following procedure. Catalyst F was used to manufacture all the propyl ene-alpha olefin copolymers of Example 11.<br>
The propylene polymerization process is exothermic. There are - 900 BTU released per pound of propylene polymerized and ~1,500 BTU released per pound of ethylene polymerized. The primary process design consideration is how to remove the heat of reaction. The P/E* copolymer of Example 11 were produced in a low-pressure, solution polymerization loop reactor, made up of a 3" loop pipe plus two heat exchanges, the total volume of which is 26.9 gals. Solvent and monomer (propylene) are injected into the reactor as a liquid. The comonomer (ethylene) gas is fully dissolved in the liquid solvent. The feed is cooled to 5°C before injection into the reactor. The reactor operates at polymer concentrations equal to 18 wt%. The adiabatic temperature rise of the solution accounts for some of the heat removal from the polymerization reaction. Heat exchangers within the reactor are utilized to remove the remaining heat of reaction, allowing for reactor temperature control at 105°C.<br>
The solvent used is a high purity iso-paraffinic fraction purchased from Exxon called Isopar E. Fresh propylene is passed through a bed of Selxsorb COS for purification before mixing with the recycle stream (contains solvent, propylene, ethylene, and hydrogen). After mixing with the recycle stream, the combined stream is passed through a bed of 75 wt% Molecular Sieve 13X and 25 wt% Selexsorb CD for further purification before using a high pressure (700 psig) feed pump to pump the contents to the reactor. Fresh ethylene is passed through a Selexsorb COS bed for purification before compressing the stream to 750 psig. Hydrogen (a telogen used to reduce molecular weight) is mixed with the compressed ethylene before the two are mixed/<br><br>
dissolved into the liquid feed. The total stream is cooled to the appropriate feed temperature (5°C). The reactor operates at 525 psig and a control temperature equal to 105°C. The propylene conversion in the reactor is maintained by controlling the catalyst injection rate. The reaction temperature is maintained by controlling the water temperature across the shell side of the heat exchanger at 85°C. The residence time in the reactor is short, 15 minutes. The propylene conversion per reactor pass is 60 wt%.<br>
Upon exiting the reactor, water and additive are injected into the polymer solution. The water hydrolyzes the catalyst, terminating the polymerization reaction. The additives consist of antioxidants, 500 ppm of Irganox™ 1010 and 1000 ppm of Irgafos™ 168, that remain with the polymer and act as stabilizers to prevent polymer degradation while in storage before subsequent fabrication at the end-user's facility. The post-reactor solution is super-heated from reactor temperature to 230°C in preparation for a two-stage devolatilization. The solvent and unreacted monomers are removed during the devolatilization process. The polymer melt is pumped to a die for underwater pellet cutting.<br>
Solvent and monomer vapors exiting the top of the devolatilizers are sent to a coalescer. The coalescer removes polymer entrained in the vapor during devolatilization. The clean vapor stream leaving the coalescer is partially condensed through a series of heat exchangers. The two-phase mixture enters a separation drum. The condensed solvent and monomers are purified (this is the recycle stream described above) and re-used in the reaction process. The vapors leaving the separating drum, mostly containing propylene and ethylene are sent to a block flare and burned.<br>
The Blends of Example 11<br>
The components of the blends of samples 11-2 through -4 were batch mixed on a Kobelco Batch Mixer. The polypropylene was first loaded in the mixer. The propylene-alpha olefin copolymers were added next and a second elastomer, if indicated. The total mixing time was approximately three minutes at 100 rpm. Cooling<br><br>
cycle began after the resins had completely mixed to form chips. The chips were reduced in size using a Glen Mills Type P-15 laboratory grinding mill.<br>
The ground chips from above and pelleted components for the blend of samples 11-1 and 11-5 were further compounded on a Werner &amp; Pfleiderer ZSK-30, 30-mm twin-screw extruder. The extruder speed was set at 350 rpm's and the extruder temperature was about 200 °C. The extrusion rate was about 40 lb./hr. A Conair pellitizer was used to chop the strands to form pellets at the outlet of the extruder.<br>
The pelleted compounds from above for samples 11-1 through 11-5 and the individual components of the blend for samples 11-6 through 11-12 were fabricated into films on a Haake 25-mm twin screw extruder equipped with a TPI Tape Postex with a 6 inch sheet die. One KTron Volumetric feeder was used. Haake PolyLab Monitor monitored the fabrication process. The set point for the feeder was 500. The extruder operated at about 200 °C and 500 psi. A Conair Tempro press was used to flatten out the sheet after the film rolled out from the chill roll.<br>
For compression molding tests, the samples were melted at 190°C for 3 minutes and compression molded at 190°C under 5.5 MPa pressure for 2 min. The molten materials were then quenched in a press equilibrated at room temperature.<br>

Unless otherwise indicated below (or by the specific test procedure), the blends were formed into 20 mil extruded films and tested for the physical properties shown in Tables 11-1 and 11-2.<br>
The data of Tables 11-1 and 11-2 show the excellent balance of flexibility (low modulus), heat resistance (TMA and Vicat) and mechanical properties (tensile strength and tear resistance) exhibited by the inventive blends.

In particular, the following points are made regarding the inventive blends of Tables 11-1 and 11-2.<br>
Table 11-1: P/E*-RCP blends<br>
Sample 11-1: Similar modulus as comparative sample 11-6 but higher heat resistance (TMA, Vicat); this blend will be useful in applications such as, wire and cable, stationary, coated fabrics and artificial leather.<br>
Sample 11-2: Lower modulus (much better flexibility) and similar TMA as compared to comparative samplel 1-6; this blend when combined with oil, filler and other elastomer such as styrenic block copolymers is useful in applications such as, coated fabrics, artificial leather, and soft-touch.<br>
Sample 11-3: Similar modulus as sample 11-1, but higher Vicat temperature; this blend is useful in applications such as, geo-membranes and roofing membranes, wire and cable, stationary, coated fabrics and artificial leather. This sample shows that the use of a propylene-alpha olefin terpolymer leads to improvements in the heat resistance of the blends.<br><br>
Sample 11-4: Lower modulus and similar heat resistance (TMA, Vicat) as compared to comparative sample 11-6; this blend when combine with oil, filler and other elastomer such as styrenic block copolymers will be useful in coated fabrics, artificial leather, and soft-touch applications.<br>
Sample 11-5: Similar shore A as 11-6 but significantly higher Vicat temperature; this blend will be particularly usefiil for geo-membranes and roofing membranes, wire and cable applications, stationary, coated fabrics and artificial leather.<br>
Table 11-2: P/E*-E/0-RCP blends<br>
Sample 11-7: Lower flexibility but higher heat resistance and tensile strength versus comparative sample 11-6; this blend will be particularly useful for geo-membranes and roofing membranes, wire and cable, stationary, coated fabrics and artificial leather applications.<br>
Sample 11-8: Similar modulus but higher TMA versus sample 11-6; this blend will be useful in geo-membranes and roofing membranes, wire and cable, stationary, coated fabrics and artificial leather.<br>
Sample 11-9 through 11-12: Better low temperature property (lower brittleness point) versus sample 11-7. This Sample shows that by adding a relatively small amount of ethylene-octene elastomer, the brittleness point can be significantly lowered, while maintaining the other advantageous properties of the blend..<br>
The properties recorded in Tables 11-1 and 11-2 were determined as follows:<br>
TMA, "thermal mechanical analysis", is the upper service temperature determined from a thermal mechanical analyzer (Perkin-Elmer TMA 7 series) scanned at 5 C/min and a load of 1 Newton, and defined as the temperature at which the probe penetrates<br><br>
lmm into the sample. The samples are compression molded 80 mil (203 micrometers) thick films.<br>
Ultimate Tensile Strength was determined in accordance with ASTM-C412, in the machine direction. The samples are 20 mil (51 micrometer) thick extruded films.<br>
2% Secant Tensile Modulus is measured in accordance with ASTM-DS82, in the machine direction. The samples are 20 mil (51 micrometer) thick extruded films.<br>

Brittleness Point is determined in accordance with ASTM-D-2136. The samples are 50 mil (127 micrometer) thick compression molded films.<br>
Shore A was determined in accordance with ASTM-D2240<br>

The film sample was exposed to a relative humidity of 50 percent and a temperature of 23 °C for a minimum of 24 hours prior to testing.<br>
The seal strength of the film sample was determined using an Instron Tensile<br>
Tester Model #1122 according to the following test conditions:<br>
Direction of Pull:	90° to seal<br>
Crosshead Speed:	500 pirn/minute<br>
Full Scale Load:	5 kg<br><br>

Break Criterion:	80 percent<br>
Gauge Length:	2.0 inches<br>
(50.8 millimeters)<br>
Sample Width:	1.0 inch<br>
(25.4 millimeters)<br>
Heat seal initiation temperature is defined as the minimum temperature for 2 lb/in (0.4 Kg/cm) seal strength.   The heat seal data are shown on Figure 10.<br>
End-Use Applications: The blends of the invention are useful for a variety of fabrication techniques, including, but not limited to, injection molding, compression molding, extrusion (both profile and sheet), calendering thermoforming and foaming.<br>
The blends are particularly useful for making fabricated articles such as, calendered sheet, blow molded articles, and injection molded parts. The blends are also useful for TPO roofing membranes, wire and cable applications, shoe stiffeners/toe puffs, shoe soles, coated fabrics, artificial leather, calendered upholstery, auto interiors and sins, soft touch applications, dual durometer for toothbrush and razor handles, dedical and food tubing, glass interlayer coatings, weather stripping, gasket, stationary, thennoformed bottles, hosing applications, bottle cap liners, bitumen modifiers, carpet backing and flooring, elastic diaper back sheets, elastic diaper ears, elastic waistbands, elastic side-panels and other applications apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Many of the above applications will take advantage of fillers and oils, to enhance the physical properties and processability of the blends.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
