The   following   specification   particularly  describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION] [0001]<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement in an interlocking brake device having a master cylinder connected to a hydraulic wheel brake and adapted to be operated according to the braking operations of an<br><br>
independent brake operator and an interlocking brake operator wherein a braking force generated in operating the interlocking brake operator is applicable to the master cylinder and a mechanical wheel brake. [0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Such an interlocking brake device is known from Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 11-91673, for example. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the conventional interlocking brake device mentioned above, a knocker is pivotably supported to a cylinder body of a master cylinder so as to be pivotally operated according to the braking operations of an independent brake operator and an interlocking brake operator.  The knocker is provided with a push pin for pushing a piston in the master cylinder.  That is, the knocker is composed of a pair of levers positioned on the opposite sides of the operation axis of the piston and a push pin having an axis perpendicular to the operation axis of the piston to connect the levers. [0004]<br>
In this conventional interlocking brake device, however, the knocker is composed of plural components and<br><br>
it is complicated in configuration. [0005]<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide an interlocking brake device having a knocker for pushing a piston in a master cylinder wherein the knocker has a reduced number of parts and a simple configuration. [0006]<br>
[Means of Solving the Problem]<br>
In accordance with the present invention as defined in claim 1, there is provided in an interlocking brake device including a master cylinder having a cylinder body and a piston slidably engaged in the cylinder body so that the front surface of the piston is exposed to a fluid pressure chamber connected to a hydraulic wheel brake, a knocker for pushing the rear end of a piston rod extending from the piston, an independent brake operator and an interlocking brake operator adapted to be operated independently of each other, load distributing means for distributing an operating force to a mechanical wheel brake and the knocker at a predetermined distribution ratio according to the braking operation of the interlocking brake operator, and connecting means for connecting the independent brake operator and the load<br><br>
distributing means to the knocker so as to avoid mutual interference between the independent brake operator and the load distributing means; the improvement wherein the knocker comprises a single component kept in direct contact with the rear end of the piston rod and supported to the cylinder body so as to be pivotable about an axis perpendicular to a plane containing the operation axis of the piston. [0007]<br>
With this configuration, the piston rod in the master cylinder is directly pushed by the knocker as a single component.  Accordingly, the number of parts can be reduced, and the configuration of the knocker can be simplified. [0008]<br>
In accordance with the present invention as defined in claim 2 including the configuration of claim 1, the knocker is a platelike member parallel to the plane.  With this configuration, the knocker can be simplified in shape and can be made compact. [0009]<br>
In accordance with the present invention as defined in claim 3 including the configuration of claim 1 or 2, the cylinder body is integrally formed with a reservoir<br><br>
tank.  With this configuration, the master cylinder and<br>
the reservoir tank can be assembled compactly.<br>
[0010]<br>
In accordance with the present invention as defined in claim 4 including the configuration of claim 1, 2, or 3, the load distributing means and the connecting means are positioned on one side of the plane.  With this configuration, the operating portions of the components of the interlocking brake device can be collectively arranged, thereby making easy the layout in mounting the interlocking brake device on a vehicle. [0011]<br>
In accordance with the present invention as defined in claim 5 including the configuration of claim 4, the reservoir tank is arranged on the other side of the plane. With this configuration, the reservoir tank can be arranged without the limitation by the layout of the operating portions of the components of the interlocking brake device, and the capacity of the reservoir tank can be set large.  Furthermore, the master cylinder, the reservoir tank, the load distributing means, and the connecting means can be compactly arranged as a whole. [0012]<br>

[0017]<br>
A disc brake BF as a hydraulic wheel brake is mounted on the front wheel WF, and a drum brake BR as a mechanical wheel brake is mounted on the rear wheel WR. The disc brake BF can be independently operated by operating the independent brake lever 21, and the disc brake BF and the drum brake BR can be interlockingly operated by operating the interlocking brake lever 22. [0018]<br>
A master cylinder unit 23 is mounted on the head pipe portion 12a of the front frame 12 of the body frame 11.  The master cylinder unit 23 supplies a brake fluid pressure to the disc brake BF according to the braking operation of the independent brake lever 21.  The master cylinder unit 23 supplies a. brake fluid pressure to the disc brake BF and also applies a drawing force to the drum brake BR according to the braking operation of the interlocking brake lever 22.<br><br>
[0019]<br>

[0020]<br>
The master cylinder 24 includes a cylindrical cylinder body 30 extending vertically and closed at its upper end in the condition where the master cylinder unit 23 is mounted on the body frame 11, and a piston 31 slidably fitted in the cylinder body 30 so that the front surface of upper surface of the piston 31 is exposed to a fluid pressure chamber 32.  The fluid pressure chamber 32 is defined between the closed upper end of the cylinder<br><br>

The other end of the fluid pressure hose 34 is connected to the disc brake BF.  That is, the fluid pressure chamber 32 is connected to the disc brake BF. [0022]<br>
An annular recess 36 is formed on the outer cylindrical surface of the piston 31, and a pair of cup seals 37 and 38 are mounted on the outer cylindrical surface of the piston 31 so as to interpose the annular recess 36 on the axially opposite sides of the piston 31. The cup seal 37 positioned between the annular recess 36 and the fluid pressure chamber 32 allows the brake fluid to flow from the annular recess 36 to the fluid pressure chamber 32 when the fluid pressure in the fluid pressure<br><br>
chamber 32 becomes lower than that in the annular recess<br>
36.<br>
[0023]<br>
The reservoir tank 26 is integral with the cylinder body 30.  The reservoir tank 26 extends vertically in the condition where the master cylinder unit 23 is mounted on the body frame 11, and has a closed lower end and an open upper end.  The open upper end of the reservoir tank 26 is closed by a cover member 40. [0024]<br>
A diaphragm 41 is accommodated in the reservoir tank 26 to minimize the contact of the brake fluid in the reservoir tank 26 with the outside air and to prevent a change in pressure applied to the brake fluid according to a change in amount of the brake fluid in the reservoir tank 26.  The diaphragm 41 has a flange portion 41a at its upper end.  The flange portion 41a of the diaphragm 41 and a retainer plate 42 placed on the flange portion 41a are sandwiched between the reservoir tank 26 and the cover member 40.  The retainer plate 42 is formed with a central communication hole 43 communicating with the inside of the diaphragm 41.  A passage 44 communicating with the communication hole 43 is defined between the retainer plate 42 and the cover member 40.  The passage 44 opens<br><br>
from a side surface of the cover member 40 to the outside of the reservoir tank 26. [0025]<br>
An inspection window 45 is provided at a vertically central portion of the reservoir tank 26.  The inspection window 45 is fluid-tightly closed by a translucent plate 46 formed of glass or synthetic resin, so that the condition inside the reservoir tank 26 can be visibly recognized through the translucent plate 45. [0026]<br>
A supply port 47 for supplying the brake fluid in the reservoir tank 26 to the annular recess 36 is formed through a lower portion of the reservoir tank 26, and a relief port 48 for making communication of the fluid pressure chamber 32 with the reservoir tank 26 in the condition where the piston 31 is lowered to its retraction limit as shown in FIG. 6 is also formed through the lower portion of the reservoir tank 26 near the supply port 47. [0027]<br>
The piston 31 is integrally formed with a piston rod 31a extending rearward or downward in coaxial relationship with each other.  The piston rod 31a has a rear end projecting rearward or downward from the<br><br>
cylinder body 30. [0028]<br>
The knocker 25 is adapted to push the rear end of the piston rod 31a and has one end portion pivotably supported through a support shaft 49 having an axis perpendicular to a plane P containing the operation axis of the piston 31 to a knocker supporting portion 30a formed integrally with the cylinder body 30 at its lower end portion.  The knocker 25 is a platelike component parallel to the plane P, and has a pushing portion 25a kept in direct contact with the rear end of the piston rod 31a.  The pushing portion 25a is formed integrally with the knocker 25 at its intermediate portion. [0029]<br>
The connecting means 28 is composed of a first connecting member 50 vertically extending, a second connecting member 51 vertically extending longer than the first connecting member 50 so as to overlap the first connecting member 50, and a torsion spring 52 provided between the cylinder body 30 and the second connecting member 51.  The connecting means 28 is positioned on one side of the plane P. [0030]<br>
The first connecting member 50 is formed at its<br><br>
lower portion'with a first elongated hole 53 vertically extending.  A connecting pin 54 is provided at the other end portion of the knocker 25, and is inserted through the first elongated hole 53 of the first connecting member 50.  The second connecting member 51 is also formed with a second elongated hole 55 vertically extending.  The second elongated hole 55 has the same width as that of the first elongated hole 53, and the connecting pin 54 is also inserted through the second elongated hole 55.  The connecting pin 54 is formed at its intermediate portion with an enlarged diameter portion 54a whose opposite shoulders are in sliding contact with the opposed surfaces of the first and second connecting members 50 and 51 in the periphery of the first and second elongated holes 53 and 55. [0031]<br>
A first input cable 58 is connected at one end thereof to the independent brake lever 21, and a solid cylindrical connection terminal 59 is provided at the other end of the first input cable 58.  The connection terminal 59 is engaged and connected with the first connecting member 50 at its upper portion.  The first input cable 58 is inserted through a first cable supporting portion 30b formed integrally with the<br><br>
cylinder body 30 in such a manner that an end portion of a guide tube 60 surrounding the first input cable 58 is fitted and supported to the first cable supporting portion 30b. [0032]<br>
The load distributing lever 27 is positioned on the same side as that of the connecting means 28 with respect to the plane P containing the operation axis of the piston 31 so as to extend horizontally.  That is, the load distributing lever 27 and the connecting means 28 are positioned on one side with respect to the plane P, and the reservoir tank 26 is positioned on the other side with respect to the plane P. [0033]<br>
The load distributing lever 27 is connected at its one end portion through a connecting pin 61 to an upper portion of the second connecting member 51 in the connecting means 28. [0034]<br>
A second input cable 62 is connected at one end thereof to the interlocking brake lever 22, and a solid cylindrical connection terminal 63 is provided at the other end of the second input cable 62.  The connection terminal 63 is engaged and connected with the load<br><br>
distributing lever 27 at its intermediate portion.  The second input cable 62 is inserted through a second cable supporting portion 30c formed integrally with the cylinder body 30 in such a manner that an end portion of a guide tube 64 surrounding the second input cable 62 is fitted and supported to the second cable supporting portion 30c. [0035]<br>
Further, a solid cylindrical connection terminal 66 is provided at one end of an output cable 65 inserted through a third cable supporting portion 30d formed integrally with the cylinder body 30.  The connection terminal 66 is engaged and connected to the other end portion of the load distributing lever 27 in such a manner that an end portion of a guide tube 67 surrounding the output cable 65 is fitted and supported to the third cable supporting portion 30d.  The other end of the output cable 65 is connected to a working lever 68 of the drum brake BR. [0036]<br>
The torsion spring 52 in the connecting means 28 has one end engaged and connected with the second connecting member 51 and the other end abutting against the cylinder body 30.  The torsion spring 52 further has<br><br>
an intermediate spiral portion surrounding the support shaft 49. Accordingly, the torsion spring 52 exerts a spring force so as to bias the second connecting member 51 in its downward direction, so that one end portion of the load distributing lever 27 connected to the second connecting member 51 is biased downward.  The cylinder body 30 is integrally formed with a projecting stopper 69 against which the lower surface of the load distributing lever 27 at its one end portion abuts to restrict downward movement of the second connecting member 51 and downward movement of the one end portion of the load distributing lever 27. [0037]<br>
Further, the first cable supporting portion 30b for supporting the guide tube 60 of the first input cable 58 is extended horizontally to the upper side of the second connecting member 51.  Accordingly, the upper end of the second connecting member 51 is adapted to abut against the second cable supporting portion 30b, so that upward movement of the second connecting member 51 and upward movement of the one end portion of the load distributing lever 27 can be restricted. [0038]<br>
According to the load distributing lever 27 and the<br><br>
connecting means 28 in operating the independent brake lever 21, the first input cable 58 is drawn to upward move the first connecting member 50 in the connecting means 28 as shown in FIGS. 8(a) and 8(b). The upward movement of the first connecting member 50 is transmitted to the knocker 25 through the connecting pin 54 engaged with the lower end of the first elongated hole 53. Accordingly, the knocker 25 is pivotally moved about the axis of the support shaft 49 so as to push the piston rod 31a in the master cylinder 24. As a result, a brake fluid pressure generated in the fluid pressure chamber 32 of the master cylinder 24 is applied to the disc brake BF. At this time, the connecting pin 54 moves upward within the second elongated hole 55 of the second connecting member 51, and the second connecting member 51 is not moved upward, so that there is no possibility that the braking force applied to the independent brake lever 21 may not be transmitted from the connecting means 28 to the load distributing lever 27. [0039]<br>
The operation of the connecting means 28 and the load distributing lever 27 in operating the interlocking brake lever 22 will now be described with reference to FIGS. 9(a) and 9(b) .  The second input cable 62 is drawn<br><br>
according to the braking operation of the interlocking brake lever 22, so that the intermediate portion of the load distributing lever 27 is pulled upward.  Initially, the spring force of the torsion spring 52 is applied to the one end portion of the load distributing lever 27, so that the load distributing lever 27 is pivotally moved about the connecting pin 61 at the one end portion as shown by a phantom line in FIG. 9(a). As a result, the output cable 65 is drawn to operate the drum brake BR mounted on the rear wheel WR prior to the disc brake BF mounted on the front wheel WF.  Thus, retarding the operation timing of the disk brake BF for the front wheel WF from the operation timing of the drum brake BR for the rear wheel WR is effective in obtaining a good brake feeling on the motorcycle. [0040]<br>
When the braking force applied to the interlocking brake lever 22 is increased to such a degree that the force applied from the second input cable 62 through the load distributing lever 27 to the second connecting member 51 exceeds a set load of the torsion spring 52, the whole of the load distributing lever 27 is pulled up as shown by a solid line in FIG. 9(a) .  Accordingly, the second connecting member 51 and the output cable 65 both<br><br>
connected to the load distributing lever 27 are moved upward at a distribution ratio corresponding to the ratio of a distance between the connecting pin 61 and the connection terminal 63 and a distance between the connection terminal 63 and the connection terminal 66. As a result, the drum brake BR for the rear wheel WR continues to be operated, and simultaneously the knocker 25 is pivotally moved about the axis of the support shaft 49 through the connecting pin 54 engaged with the lower end of the second elongated hole 55, according to the upward movement of the second connecting member 51, thereby pushing the piston rod 31a to apply a brake fluid pressure generated in the fluid pressure chamber 32 to the disc brake BF. At this time, the connecting pin 54 moves upward within the first elongated hole 53 of the first connecting member 50, and the first connecting member 50 is not moved upward, so that there is no influence of the connecting means 28 upon the independent brake lever 21. [0041]<br>
When the braking force applied to the interlocking brake lever 22 is further increased to such a degree that the second connecting member 51 comes into abutment against the first cable supporting portion 30b, that is,<br><br>
the upward movement of the second connecting member 51 is restricted by the first cable supporting portion 30b, the load distributing lever 27 is allowed to be pivotally moved about the connecting pin 61.  Accordingly, the braking force by the drum brake BR for the rear wheel WR can be further increased.  Further, even if the disc brake BF for the front wheel WF fails to properly operate because of fluid pressure defects or the like, a sufficient braking force can be ensured on the rear wheel WR side. [0042]<br>
The intermediate portion of the load distributing lever 27 is integrally formed with a sensed portion 27a projecting downward.  A first brake switch 70 having a sensor 70a kept in contact with the sensed portion 27a is supported to a first switch supporting portion 30e formed integrally with the cylinder body 30.  Further, the one end portion of the knocker 25 supported by the support shaft 49 is integrally formed with a sensed portion 25b projecting upward like an inverted L-shape as viewed in side elevation.  A second brake switch 71 having a sensor 71a kept in contact with the sensed portion 25b is supported to a second switch supporting portion 30f formed integrally with the cylinder body 30.<br><br>
[0043]<br>
The first brake switch 70 detects that the load distributing lever 27 has been moved upward according to the braking operation of the interlocking brake lever 22, and the second brake switch 71 detects that the knocker 25 has been pivotally moved to push the piston rod 31a according to the braking operation of at least one of the independent brake lever 21 and the interlocking brake lever 22.<br>
[0044]<br>
The operation of the preferred embodiment mentioned above will now be described.  The knocker 25 as a single component kept in direct contact with the rear end of the piston rod 31a in the master cylinder 24 is supported to the cylinder body 30 so as to be pivotable about the axis perpendicular to the plane P containing the operation axis of the piston 31.  Thus, the knocker 25 as a single component directly pushes the piston rod 31a in the master cylinder 24.  Accordingly, as compared with a knocker composed of plural components, the number of parts can be reduced and the configuration of the knocker 25 can be simplified.<br>
[0045]<br>
Further, the knocker 25 is a platelike member<br><br>
parallel to the plane P.  Accordingly, the knocker 25 can be simplified in shape and can be made compact. [0046]<br>
The reservoir tank 26 is formed integrally with the cylinder body 30.  Accordingly, the master cylinder 24 and the reservoir tank 26 can be assembled compactly. [0047]<br>
The load distributing lever 27 and the connecting means 28 are positioned on one side of the plane P. Accordingly, the operating portions of the components of the interlocking brake device can be collectively arranged, thereby making easy the layout in mounting the interlocking brake device on the vehicle. [0048]<br>
The reservoir tank 26 is positioned on the other side of the plane P.  Accordingly, the reservoir tank 26 can be arranged without the limitation by the layout of the operating portions of the components of the interlocking brake device, and the capacity of the reservoir tank 26 can be set large.  Furthermore, the master cylinder 24, the reservoir tank 26, the load distributing lever 27, and the connecting means 28 can be compactly arranged as a whole. [0049]<br><br>
Having thus described a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above preferred embodiment, but various design changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined in claims. [0050]<br>
