				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to homeopathic composition for increasing immunity of plants and a process for the preparation of the same. More particularly the present invention relates to a composition comprising ammonium sulphuricum, zinc sulfate, zingiber officinale {'shundi') &amp; neem concentrate in liquid forms for increasing immunity of plants.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A large population of India is directly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Every human being is inevitably dependent on agriculture and animals for their food sources. For healthy human civilization the food sources and land particularly agricultural land, must be free from toxicity and must have desired level of nutrients. A large proportion of the land which is used for growing food and crops is toxicated, nutrient deficient and are having poor physical condition. The indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers is converting fertile land into barren land.<br>
Due to industrial development and improper chemical waste management the toxic level in plant and in their products has been increased considerably, which is taking a toll on the health of animal kingdom including human being. The immunity level of plants has gone down and they are unable to sustain adverse<br>
climatic conditions. We keep on hearing farmers' suicide in India on account of crop failure.<br>
Further on account of increase in population there is a need to protect productivity of crops even in adverse climatic conditions. We keep on hearing global food crisis.<br>
Homeopathic medicines have been found to be very useful and free from side effects when administered to human beings. However homeopathic medicines have not been used for the conditioning of land and for plants.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a homeopathic composition for increasing immunity of plants to sustain adverse climatic conditions and a process for the preparation of the same.<br>
It is further objective of the present invention to provide a safe and non toxic composition free from side effects for increasing immunity of plants.<br>
It is yet another objective of the present invention is to develop a composition that can be given easily and whose prolonged usages do not have any adverse effect.<br>
It is still another objective of the present invention to provide a composition which can be inexpensively produced and easily employed / administered.<br>
Yet another objective is to develop a homeopathic composition that can be stored for a longer period.<br>
Additional objects and additional advantages of the present invention will be set forth, in part, in the description that follows, or may be learned from practicing or using the present invention. The objects and advantages may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly recited in the appended claims. It is to be understood that the foregoing detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not to be viewed as being restrictive of the invention, as claimed.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
The present invention aims to provide a cost effective and free from side effects, homeopathic composition comprising ammonium sulphuricum, zinc sulfate, zingiber officinale {'shundi') &amp; neem concentrate forms for increasing immunity of plants to sustain adverse climatic conditions including the effects of global warming.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The novel features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims hereto. The invention itself, however, as well as a preferred mode of use, further objectives, and advantages thereof, will best be understood by reference to the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments.<br>
The present invention relates to homeopathic composition for increasing immunity of plants to sustain adverse climatic conditions including the effects of global warming. More particularly the present invention relates to a composition comprising ammonium sulphuricum, zinc sulfate, zingiber officinale {'shundi') &amp; neem concentrate in liquid forms for increasing immunity of plants to sustain adverse climatic conditions including the effects of global warming. The main ingredients are described as below:<br>
Ammonium Sulphuricum<br>
It is commonly known as ammonium sulpfate. Ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2S04, is an inorganic chemical compound. It contains 21% nitrogen as ammonium ions and 24% sulfur as sulfate ions. Ammonium sulfate occurs naturally as the rare mineral mascagnite in volcanic fumaroles and due to coal fires on some dumps. Ammonium sulfate is prepared commercially by reacting ammonia with sulfuric acid (H2S04). Ammonium sulfate is prepared commercially from the ammoniacal liquor of gas-works and is purified by recrystallisation. It forms large rhombic prisms, has a somewhat saline taste and is easily soluble in water.<br>
Zinc Sulfate<br>
Zinc sulfate (ZnS04) is a colorless crystalline, water-soluble chennical compound. The hydrated form, ZnS047H20, the mineral goslarite, was historically known as "white vitriol" and can be prepared by reacting zinc with aqueous sulfuric acid. It may also be prepared by adding solid zinc to a Copper II Sulfate solution. Other natural form of this heptahydrate is known as mineral zincmelanterite (Zn,Cu,Fe)S04-7H20 (structurally different from goslarite). Lower hydrates of zinc sulfate are rarely found in nature as minerals: bianchite (Zn,Fe)S04.6H20, boyleite (Zn,Mg)S04-4H20 and gunningite (Zn,Mn)S04H20.<br>
Shundi (Ginger)<br>
The botanical name for shundi is Zingiber officinalis. It originates from the family: zingiberaceae. The common names are: sunthi, adrak, nagar and the English name is ginger. It is widely cultivated in India but seems to originate from Southern China. The common cooking ginger is an herbaceous perennial with upright stems and narrow medium green leaves arranged in two ranks on each stem. The plant gets about 4 ft (1.2 m) tall with leaves about 3/4 in (1.9 cm) wide and 7 (17.8 cm) long. Ginger grows from an aromatic tuber like rhizome (underground stem), which is warty and branched. The inflorescence grows on a separate stem from the foliage stem, and forms a dense spike, to 3 in (7.6 cm) tall. The bracts are green with translucent margins and the small flowers are<br>
yellow green with purple lips and cream-colored blotches. Most gingers in cultivation are sterile cultivars grown for the edible rhizome, and the flower is rarely seen.<br>
The shundi used in present invention is basically liquid extract of Zingiber officinalis prepared from dried underground stems of Zingiber officinalis.<br>
Neem<br>
Neem (Azadirachta indica, syn. Melia azadirachta L., Antelaea azadirachta (L.) Adelb.) is a tree in the mahogany family Meliaceae. It is one of two species in the genus Azadirachta, and is native to Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan growing in tropical and semi-tropical regions. Neem is a fast-growing tree that can reach a height of 15-20 m (about 50-65 feet), rarely to 35-40 m (115-131 ft.). The branches are wide spread. The fairly dense crown is roundish or oval and may reach the diameter of 15-20 m In old, free-standing specimens. The neem used in present invention is basically liquid extract of Azadirachta indica prepared from dried bark of Azadirachta indica.<br>
The preparation<br>
The unique composition is prepared by mixing liquid extracts of above named<br>
ingredients in the effective ranges shown below.<br>
For a vial of 125 ml<br>
1. Ammonium Sulphuricum -12.5 to 62.5 ml (10-50% by Volume)<br>
2.	Zinc Sulfate -12.5 to 62.5 ml (10-50% by Volume)<br>
3.	Zingiber Officinale {'shundi') - 12.5 to 62.5 ml (10-50% by Volume)<br>
4.	Azadirachta indica -12.5 to 62.5 ml (10-50% by Volume)<br>
The best results are achieved when the key 4 ingredients mentioned above are<br>
used in equal proportion by volume.<br>
Unique composition<br>
When these individual ingredients are administered separately the results are not<br>
encouraging. The unique combination of ingredients in the present invention<br>
shows altogether different result and different properties when compared with<br>
aggregation of the properties of the components.<br>
Dosages &amp; Administration<br>
For administration purposes a vial of 125 ml needs to be mixed in a jaggery (gud) solution of 1 Kg diluted with 75 to 80 litre of water. The utensil used for mixing and preparation of solution should be non reactive and should be cleaned properly before use. The prepared solution should be sprayed slowly on leaves. It should be ensured that there are no immediate chances of rain. After spray there should be clear weather for atheist six hours for better results.<br>
A vial of 125 ml can be used for one acre crop. There are no side effects of this composition.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim<br>
1.	A homeopathic plant conditioning composition for increasing immunity of plants to sustain adverse climatic conditions including the effects of global warming comprising ammonium sulphuricum, zinc sulfate, zingiber officinale {'shundi') &amp; neem concentrate in liquid forms.<br>
2.	A homeopathic composition as claimed In claim 1, where each of the ingredients mentioned above are in the range of 10% to 50% of the total composition by volume.<br>
3.	A homeopathic therapeutic composition as claimed in claim 2 wherein each of the ingredients mentioned above are in equal proportion by volume.<br><br></td>
