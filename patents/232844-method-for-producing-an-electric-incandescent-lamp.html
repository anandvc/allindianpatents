				<td>The invention relates to a method for producing an electric incandescent lamp in accordance with the preamble of Patent Claim 1.<br>
I. Prior Art<br>
Such a method of production is disclosed, for example, in German Patent DE 22 43 717. This patent describes a two-filament halogen incandescent lamp having an anti-dazzle device and an incandescent filament arranged in the anti-dazzle device. The anti-dazzle device has a welding lug provided with a transverse rib. The incandescent filament ends are wrapped in each case in a metal foil. Here, the incandescent filament is fixed on the anti-dazzle device by fastening one of the filament ends enclosed in the metal foil to the transverse rib by a spot weld.<br>
II . Description of the Invention<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a method for producing an electric incandescent lamp equipped with an anti-dazzle device and at least one incandescent filament, which method permits simpler fastening of the incandescent filament end to the anti-dazzle device.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by the characterizing features of Patent Claim 1. Particularly advantageous embodiments of the invention are described in the subclaims .<br>
The method of production according to the invention for an electric incandescent lamp provided with at least one incandescent filament and an anti-dazzle device is<br>
distinguished in that said method has the following<br>
production steps:<br>
Provision of an anti-dazzle device whose edge is<br>
provided with a notch,<br>
Provision of an incandescent filament,<br>
Threading an incandescent filament end into the<br>
notch, and<br>
Melting   the   anti-dazzle   device   with   the<br>
incandescent filament end arranged in the notch by<br>
melting the material of the anti-dazzle device in<br>
the region of the notch so that the melt wets the<br>
incandescent filament end arranged in the notch,<br>
and the  incandescent  filament  end is  embedded<br>
after the melt  solidifies  in the  resolidified<br>
material of the anti-dazzle device.<br>
By comparison with the prior art, the method of production according to the invention renders possible a simpler fastening of an incandescent filament end to the anti-dazzle device, because now at least one of the metal foils enclosing the filament ends can be saved. Fusing the incandescent filament end in a notch on the edge of the anti-dazzle device in the way according to the invention can be carried out both for uncoiled and for coiled incandescent filament ends. In order to fuse the anti-dazzle device with the incandescent filament end threaded in the notch at the edge of the antidazzle device, the material of the anti-dazzle device is advantageously melted on both sides of the notch. It is thereby ensured that the incandescent filament end is embedded completely in the resolidified melt of the anti-dazzle device. The anti-dazzle device is advantageously formed from a metal sheet so that it can serve as an electric supply lead for the incandescent filament connected to the anti-dazzle device. The notch at the edge of the anti-dazzle device is advantageously formed from two neighbouring projections projecting from the anti-dazzle device, which have a V-shaped or U-shaped interspace. These two exposed projections can<br>
be heated and melted with a comparatively low expenditure of energy with the aid of a laser. The method of production according to the invention is particularly suitable for producing two-filament halogen incandescent lamps which are used as a light source in motor vehicle headlamps.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to method for producing an electric incandescent lamp, a lamp, which has a lamp vessel, at least one incandescent filament and an anti-dazzle device, characterised in that the method contains the following steps:<br>
Provision of an anti-dazzle device whose edge is provided<br>
with a notch<br>
Provision of an incandescent filament<br>
Threading an incandescent filament end into the notch,<br>
and<br>
Melting  the   anti-dazzle   device  with   the   incandescent<br>
filament   end   arranged   in   the   notch   by   melting   the<br>
material of the anti-dazzle device in the region of the<br>
notch so that the melt wets the incandescent filament end<br>
arranged in the notch, and the incandescent filament end<br>
is embedded  after the melt  solidifies in  the  solidified<br>
material of the anti-dazzle device.<br>
III. Description of the preferred exemplary embodiment<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with the aid of a preferred exemplary embodiment. In the drawing:<br>
Figure 1 shows an incandescent filament frame, produced in accordance with the method according to the invention, for- a two-filament halogen incandescent lamp having two incandescent filaments, an anti-dazzle device and the supply leads associated therewith,<br>
Figure 2 shows an anti-dazzle device provided for the method of production according ' to the invention, and<br>
Figure 3 shows a two-filament halogen incandescent lamp in accordance with the prior art.<br>
The method of production according to the invention is to be explained below with the aid of a two-filament halogen incandescent lamp, a so-called H4 lamp. The design of the H4 lamp is represented diagrammatically in Figure 3. The two-filament halogen incandescent lamp depicted in Figure 3 has a lamp bulb 1 which is made from hard glass and is pinched in a sealed fashion at one end. The pinch seal 10 of the lamp bulb 1 is fixed in a clamped fashion in a pot-shaped holder part 2 made from stainless steel. The holder part 2 forms the lamp cap together with the cap shell 3 and the adjusting plate 4 integrally formed thereon as well as with the<br>
cap insulator 5. The holder part 2 is welded to the adjusting plate 4 via welding lugs 13 punched out of the adjusting plate 4 and bent upwards. Located inside the lamp bulb 1 are two incandescent filaments 6, 7 which are respectively connected in an electrically conducting fashion to a contact lug 9 via a total of three supply leads 8 projecting from the pinch seal 10 and sealed between two quartz beams 11. One of the incandescent filaments 6 is provided with an anti-dazzle device 12.<br>
In order to produce the incandescent filament holder of an H4 lamp in accordance with the method of production according to the invention, a prefabricated trough-like anti-dazzle device 20 is prepared from a metal sheet, preferably a molybdenum sheet (Figure 2) . At its edge, this anti-dazzle device 20 has two neighbouring projections 21, 22, which project like teeth and form with one another an interspace constructed as a V-shape or U-shaped notch 23. The anti-dazzle device 20 further has a welding lug 25 provided with a transverse rib 24. The base of the anti-dazzle device 20 is fitted with two projections 27. Furthermore, two prefabricated incandescent filaments 30, 31 and three supply lead wires 33, 34, 35 made from molybdenum are provided for the method of production according to the invention. In order to fix the anti-dazzle device 20, the supply lead wire 35 is welded on the outside of the anti-dazzle device 20 to the two projections 27 arranged in the base 26 of the anti-dazzle device 20.<br><br>
The ends 30a, 3Ob of the dipped beam filament 30 are in each case wrapped in a molybdenum foil 36 and spot welded to the transverse rib 24 on the welding lug 25 of the anti-dazzle device 20 or to an end of the supply lead wire 33, with the result that the incandescent filament 30 is arranged in the anti-dazzle device 20. In order to fix the main beam filament 31 arranged below the anti-dazzle device 20, an end 31a of the main<br>
beam filament 31 is inserted into the notch 23 formed by the tooth-like projections 21, 22, and the two projections 21, 22 are subsequently heated and melted simultaneously with the aid in the  each case of a LASER beam acting for a short time on/two projections 21, 22, with the result that the filament end 3la is wetted by the melt and completely enclosed. After the solidification of the melt, the end 31a of the main beam filament 31 is completely embedded in the solidified material 20a of the anti-dazzle device 20. The resolidified material 20a then forms the shading nose 20a of the anti-dazzle device 20. The other end 31b of the main beam filament 31 is wrapped in a molybdenum foil 36 and spot welded to the supply lead wire 34. The incandescent filament frame produced in this way is depicted with the anti-dazzle device in Figure I. This complete filament frame is inserted in a<br>
known way into the prefabricated lamp bulb 1 and<br>
mounted<br>
moltod.. Sealing the lamp bulb 1 by means of the pinch<br>
seal 10, and capping the lamp are likewise prior art and are therefore not to be described in more detail here.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the exemplary embodiment explained in detail. For example, the filament end 30a of the dipped beam filament 30 which is welded to the transverse rib 24 can also be fused in the same way as the end 3la of the main beam filament 31 with the edge of the anti-dazzle device 20. Moreover, the application of the fusing according to the invention of incandescent filament end and antidazzle device is not restricted to two-filament halogen incandescent lamps.<br><br><br><br>
