REDUCING TUBES OVER A STEPPED MANDREL TO MANUFACTURE TUBU-<br>
LAR SHAFTS HAVING AN UNDERCUT IN ONE OPERATION<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing<br>
hollow shafts having end portions of greater wall thickness<br>
and at least one intermediate portion of reduced wall<br>
thickness, particular a from a tube previously having con-<br>
stant wall thickness, using a mandrel having diameters<br>
stepped over the length, which has a first longitudinal<br>
section having a smallest diameter and at least one further<br>
longitudinal section having a further larger diameter.<br>
A method of this type is known from DE 101 18 032 A1. In<br>
this case, a first end portion of the tube is reduced<br>
freely in external diameter in a matrix without internal<br>
support, a middle tube portion having lesser wall thickness<br>
and larger external diameter is manufactured by stretching<br>
over an internal mandrel of constant diameter, and a second<br>
end portion of the tube is manufactured through reduction<br>
in external diameter in a matrix in the opposite drawing<br>
direction or through hammering without internal support.<br>
A method of the type cited, in which a first portion of a<br>
tube is reduced over a calibration mandrel which is intro-<br>
duced from the tube end discussed, and in which an interme-<br>
diate portion of the tube is reduced over a stretching man-<br>
drel, which is introduced from the other tube end, is known<br>
from DE 35 06 220 A1. The second end portion of the tube is<br>
reduced over the calibration mandrel again after changeover<br>
of the tube. The stretching mandrel comprises two longitu-<br>
dinal sections of different diameters having a conical<br>
transition area.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of providing a<br>
dimensionally accurate method, which may be performed effi-<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
ciently, for manufacturing hollow shafts of the above-<br>
mentioned type.<br>
This object is achieved by a method of the type cited hav-<br>
ing the following steps:<br>
reducing the external diameter of a first portion of the<br>
tube over the first longitudinal section of the mandrel to<br>
produce the first end portion of the hollow shaft,<br>
reducing the external diameter of at least one middle por-<br>
tion of the tube over the at least one further longitudinal<br>
section of the mandrel to produce the at least one interme-<br>
diate portion of the hollow shaft,<br>
reducing the external diameter of a further portion of the<br>
tube over another longitudinal section of the mandrel to<br>
produce the second end portion of the hollow shaft.<br>
This method has the advantage that all longitudinal por-<br>
tions of the hollow shaft are reduced over a single man-<br>
drel, the orientation of the direction of tube and mandrel<br>
to one another remaining the same. In this case, the method<br>
is applied in such a way that in the event of one or more<br>
changes of the relative position of mandrel and tube, the<br>
entire process up to manufacturing a finished hollow shaft<br>
may occur in a uniform feed direction of mandrel and tube<br>
in relation to one another without a tool change. For this<br>
purpose, the first end portion and one or more intermediate<br>
portions of the hollow shaft, having a reduced wall thick-<br>
ness in each case, may be produced with unchanged axial po-<br>
sition of the mandrel in relation to the tube. If the two<br>
end portions are to have the same cross-section, the second<br>
end portion is particularly also to be produced over the<br>
first longitudinal section of the mandrel. Furthermore, one<br>
or more further intermediate portions, each having an in-<br>
reased wall thickness respectively, and the second end por-<br>
tion of the hollow shaft may be produced with a changed ax-<br>
ial position of the mandrel in relation to the tube in each<br>
case, drawn out from the tube step-by-step. Finally, be-<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
tween the above-mentioned shaping steps, at least two in-<br>
termediate portions having alternating wall thicknesses,<br>
first increased in relation to the preceding wall thickness<br>
and then reduced again in relation to the last wall thick-<br>
ness, may be produced. The reduction of the external diame-<br>
ter of the tube is preferably performed through cold draw-<br>
ing using a matrix; alternatively, the reduction of the ex-<br>
ternal diameter of the tube is also possible through swag-<br>
ing, roll bending, or rolling, however.<br>
Furthermore, it is suggested that transitions between end<br>
portions and intermediate portions and transitions between<br>
intermediate portions of different wall thicknesses be<br>
formed by internal conical surfaces having a cone opening<br>
angle between 5 and 45°. A further embodiment provides that<br>
the wall thickness ratio between end portions and the ad-<br>
joining intermediate portion of smallest wall thickness is<br>
greater than 1.6.<br>
Preferred exemplary embodiments for performing the method<br>
according to the present invention are illustrated in the<br>
drawing and will be described in the following.<br>

Figure 1 shows an illustration a of a tube 11 in the start-<br>
ing state, in which a first tube end 12 is identified on<br>
the left and a second tube end 16 is identified on the<br>
right, while a middle portion is identified by 14.<br>
It may be seen in illustration b that a matrix 31 is ap-<br>
plied to the left first tube end 12 and a mandrel 21 is in-<br>
serted into the interior of the tube, which essentially<br>
terminates with the left first tube end 12 and projects out<br>
of the right second tube end 16. The mandrel 21 has a first<br>
longitudinal section 22 having minimal diameter and a fur-<br>
ther longitudinal section 24 having a diameter which is es-<br>
sentially seated fixed in the tube 11. A conical transition<br>
section 27 is located between the first longitudinal sec-<br>
tion 22 and the further longitudinal section 24.<br>
Illustration c shows how two phases of the shaft manufac-<br>
turing have already been finished through a relative move-<br>
ment of matrix 31 (to the right) and mandrel 21 (to the<br>
left). Using the matrix 31, the first tube end has been re-<br>
duced in external diameter while increasing the wall thick-<br>
ness to produce a first shaft end 12' over the longitudinal<br>
section 22 of the mandrel 21. Furthermore, the middle por-<br>
tion has been reduced to form an intermediate portion 14'<br>
of the hollow shaft 11' over the second longitudinal sec-<br>
tion 24 of the mandrel 21. An internal conical transition<br>
area 17 has been formed over the transition section 27.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
In illustration d, the mandrel 21 has been pulled back into<br>
a second axial position in relation to the matrix 31, the<br>
first longitudinal section 22 of the mandrel 21 being in-<br>
serted axially into the second tube end 16.<br>
In illustration e, the tube 11 is shown after the comple-<br>
tion of a third phase of the shaft manufacturing, the sec-<br>
ond tube end having been reduced in external diameter to<br>
manufacture a second shaft end 16' with wall thickness in-<br>
creased, the tube being supported radially on the inside on<br>
the longitudinal section 22 of the mandrel 21. An internal<br>
conical transition area 20 between the intermediate portion<br>
14' and the second end portion 16' of the hollow shaft 11'<br>
is formed for this purpose solely by reducing the external<br>
diameter without internal support.<br>
In illustration f, the finished hollow shaft 11' having the<br>
two strengthened shaft ends 12', 16' and the intermediate<br>
portion 14' of reduced wall thickness is shown, two inter-<br>
nal conical transition areas 17, 20 being recognizable.<br>
In Figure 2, a tube 11 of constant wall thickness is shown<br>
in the starting state in illustration a.<br>
In illustration b, a matrix 31 is applied to the tube 11,<br>
while a mandrel 21 is inserted into the interior of the<br>
tube, which comprises a first, a second, and a further lon-<br>
gitudinal section 22, 23, 24 and conical transition sec-<br>
tions 27, 29 lying between them, which increase in diameter<br>
from the free end on the left to the end on the right. The<br>
matrix 31 is applied to the left tube end 12. The right<br>
tube end 16 may be axially supported.<br>
In illustration c, a partially finished hollow shaft 11' is<br>
shown after performing three manufacturing phases. By re-<br>
ducing the external diameter while increasing the wall<br>
thickness, a first shaft end 12' has been produced, which<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
is supported radially on the inside on the first longitudi-<br>
nal section 22 of the mandrel 21. A first intermediate por-<br>
tion 13 has also resulted with reduction of the external<br>
diameter and simultaneous stretching, which is supported on<br>
the longitudinal section 23 of the mandrel 21, and a second<br>
intermediate portion 14, which is supported on the longitu-<br>
dinal section 24 of the mandrel 21, has resulted with re-<br>
duction of the external diameter.<br>
In illustration d, the mandrel 21 is pulled back into an<br>
axial position in relation to the matrix 31 in which the<br>
longitudinal section 23 of the mandrel 21 is inserted into<br>
the second tube end 16 of the tube 11, which has not yet<br>
been shaped. The tube 11 is held axially in the matrix 31.<br>
Illustration e shows how a further intermediate portion 15<br>
has resulted through reduction of the external diameter<br>
with partial stretching, whose wall thickness and length<br>
corresponds to the first intermediate portion 13 of the<br>
hollow shaft 11' and which is supported radially on the<br>
longitudinal section 23 of the mandrel 21.<br>
Illustration f shows how the mandrel 21 is again pulled to<br>
the right out of the matrix 31, in which the hollow shaft<br>
11 is held axially, the first longitudinal section 22 of<br>
the mandrel 21 now being inserted into the last unshaped<br>
portion of the right tube end 16.<br>
In illustration g, it may be seen how a second shaft end<br>
16' has been manufactured by reducing the external diameter<br>
using the matrix 31, which is supported internally on the<br>
longitudinal section 22 of the mandrel 21 with wall thick-<br>
ness reduction and whose length and dimensions correspond<br>
to the first shaft end 12' in the present case.<br>
The finished hollow shaft 11' is shown in illustration h,<br>
in which the two shaft ends 12', 16' and the intermediate<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
portions 13', 14', 15' may be seen. The transitions are<br>
each formed by internal conical transition areas 17, 18,<br>
19, 20. The external diameter of the entire hollow shaft 11<br>
is constant over the length, corresponding to the active<br>
diameter of the matrix 31.<br>
For both embodiments, it is to be noted here that in the<br>
practical application, the matrix 31 is preferably held<br>
axially fixed, while the entire relative motion is per-<br>
formed by the mandrel 21 having the tube 11 seated. Spe-<br>
cifically, a cylindrical intake area 32, an internal coni-<br>
cal reduction and stretching area 33, and an outlet cone 34<br>
may be differentiated on the matrix. Instead of the cold<br>
drawing shown here using the matrix, milling or swaging or<br>
rolling of the external surface of the tube may also be ap-<br>
plied, the particular tool being axially displaced in the<br>
corresponding phases in relation to the mandrel in the di-<br>
rection corresponding with the matrix in each case.<br>
In Figure 3, a tube 11 of constant wall thickness is shown<br>
in the starting state in illustration a.<br>
In illustration b, a matrix 31 has been applied to the tube<br>
11, while a mandrel 21 has been inserted into the interior<br>
of the tube, which comprises a first, a second, and a fur-<br>
ther longitudinal portion 22, 23, 24 and conical transition<br>
ares 27, 29 lying between each of them, which increase in<br>
diameter from the free end on the left to the end on the<br>
right. The matrix 31 is applied to the left tube end 12.<br>
The right tube end 16 may be axially supported.<br>
A partially finished hollow shaft 11' is shown in illustra-<br>
tion c after three manufacturing phases have been per-<br>
formed. A first shaft end 12' has been produced by reducing<br>
the external diameter while increasing the wall thickness,<br>
which is supported radially on the inside on the first lon-<br>
gitudinal section 22 of the mandrel 21. A first intermedi-<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
ate portion 13 has resulted, also with reduction of the ex-<br>
ternal diameter and simultaneous stretching, which is sup-<br>
ported on the longitudinal section 23 of the mandrel 21,<br>
and a first thin-walled intermediate portion 141, which is<br>
supported on the longitudinal section 24 of the mandrel 21,<br>
has resulted with reduction of the external diameter.<br>
In illustration d, the mandrel 21 is pulled back in rela-<br>
tion to the matrix 31 into an axial position in which the<br>
longitudinal section 23 of the mandrel 21 is inserted into<br>
the second, still unshaped tube end 16 of the tube 11. The<br>
tube 11 is held axially in the matrix 31.<br>
Illustration e shows how a thick-walled intermediate por-<br>
tion 15, which is supported radially on the longitudinal<br>
section 23 of the mandrel 21, has resulted through reduc-<br>
tion of the external diameter with partial stretching. Fur-<br>
thermore, a second thin-walled intermediate portion 142,<br>
which is supported radially on the longitudinal section 24<br>
of the mandrel 21, has resulted through stretching of an<br>
adjoining longitudinal portion over the longitudinal sec-<br>
tion 24 of the mandrel 21.<br>
Illustration f shows how the mandrel 21 has again been<br>
pulled out to the right from the matrix 31, in which the<br>
hollow shaft 11 is held axially, the first longitudinal<br>
section 22 of the mandrel 21 now being inserted in the last<br>
unshaped portion of the right tube end 16.<br>
In illustration g, it may be seen how a second shaft end<br>
16', which is supported on the inside on the longitudinal<br>
section 22 of the mandrel 21 with wall thickness reduction<br>
and which corresponds in length and dimensions to the first<br>
shaft end 12' in the present case, has been manufactured by<br>
reducing the external diameter using the matrix 31.<br>
The finished hollow shaft 11' is shown in illustration h,<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
in which the two shaft ends 12', 16' and intermediate por-<br>
tions 13', 14', 15', 142' may be seen. The transitions are<br>
each formed by internal conical transition areas 17, 181,<br>
191, 182, 192. The external diameter of the overall hollow<br>
shaft 11 is constant over the length, corresponding to the<br>
active diameter of the matrix 31.<br>
For embodiments, it is to be noted here that in the practi-<br>
cal application, the matrix 31 is preferably held axially<br>
fixed, while the entire relative motion is performed by the<br>
mandrel 21 having the tube 11 seated. Specifically, a cy-<br>
lindrical intake area 32, an internal conical reduction and<br>
stretching area 33, and an outlet cone 34 may be differen-<br>
tiated on the matrix. Instead of the cold drawing shown he-<br>
re using the matrix, milling or swaging or rolling of the<br>
external surface of the tube may also be applied, the par-<br>
ticular tool being axially displaced in the corresponding<br>
phases in relation to the mandrel in the direction corre-<br>
sponding with the matrix in each case.<br><br>

ness, and the second end portion (16') are each pro-<br>
duced with a changed axial position of the mandrel<br>
(21) in relation to the tube (11), drawn out step-by-<br>
step from the tube (11).<br>
5.	The method according to Claim 3,<br>
characterized in that at least two second intermediate<br>
portions (15', 142'), alternately having first in-<br>
creased, then reduced wall thickness, are produced -<br>
particularly with an unchanged axial position of the<br>
mandrel (21) in relation to the tube (11) in each<br>
case.<br>
6.	The method according to one of Claims 1 through 5,<br>
characterized in that the reduction of the external<br>
diameter of the tube (11) is performed through cold<br>
drawing using a matrix (31), through which the tube<br>
(11) is guided from one tube end (12), tube (11) and<br>
mandrel (21) jointly on one side and matrix (31) on<br>
the other side moving axially in relation to one an-<br>
other.<br><br>
- 14-<br>
7.	The method according to one of Claims 1 through 5,<br>
characterized in that the external diameter of the tu-<br>
be (11) is reduced through swaging, roll bending, or<br>
rolling.<br>
8.	The method according to one of Claims 1 through 7,<br>
characterized in that transition areas (17, 20) be-<br>
tween end portions (12', 16') and intermediate por-<br>
tions (13', 15') and transition areas (18, 19) between<br>
intermediate portions (13', 14', 15') of different<br>
wall thicknesses are formed by internal conical sur-<br>
faces having a cone opening angle between 5 and 45°.<br>
9.	The method according to one of Claims 1 through 8,<br>
characterized in that the wall thickness ratio between<br>
the end portions (12', 16') and the intermediate por-<br>
tion (14') of smallest wall thickness is greater than<br>
1.6.<br><br>
A method for manufacturing hollow shafts 11' having end portions 12', 16' of greater wall thickness and at least one<br>
intermediate portion 14 of reduced wall thickness, from a tube<br>
11 having constant wall thickness using a mandrel 21 having<br>
diameters stepped over the length, which has a first longitudinal section 22 having a smallest diameter and at least one<br>
further longitudinal section 24 having a further larger diameter,<br>
having the following steps:<br>
reducing the external diameter of a first portion of the tube<br>
11 over the first longitudinal section 22 of the mandrel 21 to<br>
produce the first end portion 12',<br>
reducing the external diameter of a middle portion 14 of the<br>
tube 11 over the at least one further longitudinal section 24<br>
of the mandrel 21 to produce the at least one intermediate<br>
portion 14',<br>
reducing the external diameter of a further portion 16 of the<br>
tube 11 over the first longitudinal section 22 of the mandrel<br>
21 to produce the second end portion 16'.</td>
