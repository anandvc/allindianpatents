				<td>A POWER CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN ELECTRIC MOTOR AND A METHOD OF<br>
RUNNING DOWN A HIGH SPEED DC ELECTRIC MOTOR<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates in general to a power control system for an electric motor and a<br>
method of running down a high speed DC electric motor, and in particular to a power supply for a<br>
motor using magnetic bearings.<br>
International Patent Application No. WO 98/33260 describes a high speed electric motor<br>
which is particularly suitable for use as a refrigeration compressor motor. Such a motor may be used<br>
in, for example, a compressor of the type described in Australian Patent No. 686174 and utilizing<br>
magnetic bearings for the suspension of rotating parts.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A known difficulty with the use of magnetic bearings is to supply power to the bearings<br>
during a system power failure, during which the power supply to the motor fails. While it is known to<br>
use auxiliary or back-up power supplies to the system, such as by way of batteries or the like, such<br>
auxiliary power supplies are relatively expensive and require additional switching controls to enable<br>
the auxiliary supply to take over when the main power supply fails. Further, the batteries have a<br>
limited life and generally must be replaced every two years. This adds substantial further costs to the<br>
system.<br><br>
It is therefore desirable to provide an improved power supply system for a high speed electric<br>
motor running on magnetic bearings which can maintain power to the bearings in the event of a main<br>
power supply failure.<br>
It is also desirable to provide a power supply system for continously supplying power to the<br>
magnetic bearings of a high speed electric motor following a failure of the main power supply until<br>
such time as the rotating parts are at rest.<br>
It is also desirable to provide an improved controller for a high speed electric motor which<br>
enables a spinning motor to spin down under controlled conditions.<br>
It is also desirable to provide a power supply controller for a high speed electric motor with<br>
magnetic bearings which is relatively inexpensive, which is efficient in its operation and which<br>
provides a substantially fail-safe power supply for its magnetic bearings.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention there is provided a power<br>
control system for an electric motor having at least one magnetic bearing, said<br>
system comprising a DC/DC converter supplied from a DC link buss connected to<br>
a main power supply, said buss supplying power for the electric motor and for a<br>
bearing actuator, said converter providing low voltage DC power supplies for a<br>
motor controller, a bearing controller and a supervisory controller, the supervisory<br>
controller monitoring the main power supply and communicating with the motor<br>
controller and bearing controller so as to cause the motor to operate as a generator<br>
in the event of a failure of the main power supply to thereby supply power to the DC<br>
link buss to maintain operation of the magnetic bearing characterised in that, circuit<br>
switching components are connected to the motor winding and selectively switched<br>
in a manner causing current generated in the motor winding to flow in one direction<br>
into said DC link buss only while the winding voltage is greater than that of the DC<br>
link buss.<br>
The invention is preferably adapted for use with a high speed electric motor,<br>
the rotor of which is supported solely by magnetic bearings. The invention may also<br>
be utilised for an electric motor having a combination of magnetic and gas bearings.<br>
Preferably, the DC link buss incorporates at least one capacitor, which, in<br>
normal use, is maintained in a charged condition by the main power supply. The<br>
capacitor is able to provide sufficient power in conjunction with that supplied by the<br>
motor running as a generator to run down the motor from full speed and maintain<br>
operation of the magnetic bearings during the run down period. Running the motor<br>
as a generator during the run down period extracts the kinetic energy stored in the<br>
motor and other rotating parts and constitutes an electric brake to quickly and safely<br>
stop the rotor rotation. During the run down period, power continues to be supplied<br>
from the motor, running as a generator, to the DC link buss which provides an<br>
uninterruptable power supply to the DC/DC converter and the several controllers as<br>
well as the magnetic bearing actuator for the full run down period.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a<br>
method of running down a high speed DC electric motor run on magnetic bearings<br><br>
in the event of a failure of the main power supply, said method including the steps<br>
of supplying the motor and the magnetic bearings from a high voltage DC buss<br>
connected to the main power supply, proving a DC/DC converter to supply low<br>
voltage DC power to a magnetic bearing controller and to a motor controller, using<br>
switching devices to control the motor operation, sensing a failure of said main<br>
power supply and providing a signal to the motor controller, characterized in that,<br>
said switching devices are selectively controlled on sensing said failure, to initially<br>
feed existing motor current to said buss, detecting when said buss voltage drops<br>
below a predetermined value and shorting said motor winding, and as soon as<br>
current flow in said winding commences, as a result of the short, removing said<br>
short whereby the winding voltage rises to above the buss voltage, feeding the<br>
resulting generated current back to said buss, and repeating said selective control<br>
as necessary until said motor is run down.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention the power control system<br>
incorporates a plurality of switches operable to switch power between the two<br>
polarities of the DC buss and each end of the motor winding to switch the current<br>
flow through the winding. Each switch has a diode in parallel. When a mains power<br>
failure is sensed, such as by measuring a voltage drop across the buss, the<br>
switches are all switched to the "off' position and current existing in the motor coil<br>
is fed to the buss. As soon as the buss voltage drops again, the motor winding is<br>
shorted by closing the appropriate switches and then opened to let the current,<br>
generated by shorting the winding, be pumped back into the buss through the<br>
diodes.<br>
This control method uses the existing motor control IGBT switches to realise<br>
the generator function of the motor when the buss voltage falls. With this control<br>
system, there is no need to track the rotor position and control switching as a<br>
function of rotor position. The diodes enable the motor to act as a generator with<br>
all switches in the open position and the current being pumped into the buss to<br>
assist the installed capacitor for maintaining the buss voltage until the motor is run<br>
down.<br>
One embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawing wherein:<br><br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a power control system in accordance with the<br>
present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic circuit diagram illustrating the control switches for a<br>
single phase motor and<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart of the control algorithm of the system shown in<br>
Figures 1 and 2.<br>
Description of one embodiment<br>
Refemng to the drawings and firstly Figure 1, the power control system 12 is<br>
connected to a three phase AC power supply 14 through a bridge rectifier 16. A DC<br>
link buss 17 supplies DC power to a DC/DC converter 18, magnetic bearing actuator<br>
19 and electric motor power supply 21. A large capacitor 22 or capacitor bank is<br>
connected across the link buss 17 to provide a buffer of stored power for motor run<br>
down. In this embodiment, the DC link buss voltage is 1000V and the capacitor, or<br>
several capacitors, will have a capacity sufficient for a motor run down time of about<br>
0.1 sec to about 1.5 sec, in the absence of any other power source.<br>
The DC/DC converter 18 provides low voltage DC power for a motor<br>
controller 23, a bearing controller 24 and a supervisory controller, which, in this<br>
embodiment, takes the form of a computer 26. The converter 18 also supplies low<br>
voltage power for various sensors associated with the magnetic bearings and for<br>
Insulated Gage Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) (not shown) which are used for control<br>
purposes in the magnetic bearing actuator 19 and the electric motor power supply<br>
21. The magnetic bearing actuator 19 and associated IGBTs and the electric motor<br>
power supply 21 and its associated IGBTs are known in the art and will not be<br>
described in detail. Gate drive signals for the various IGBTs are generated by the<br>
bearing controller 24 and motor controller 23, respectively, to provide the desired<br>
operational parameters for the electric motor bearings.<br>
An AC power monitor 27 provides a signal to the supervisory computer 26 in<br>
the event of a failure of the main AC power supply 14. Alternatively, the supervisory<br>
computer 26 may monitor the buss voltage, through DC/DC converter 18, to detect<br>
a power failure which results in a voltage drop across the capacitor 22. On<br>
detection of a power failure, the motor controller 23 controls the IGBTs to feed<br><br>
8.	The method as claimed in claim 7, comprising the steps of connecting a capacitor across the<br>
DC bus and of providing an AC power monitor for the main power supply, said step of sensing a<br>
failure of the main power supply comprising one of: sensing a voltage drop across the capacitor and<br>
of: the AC power monitor emitting a power failure signal.<br>
9.	The method as claimed in claim 7, said step of detecting when the bus voltage drops below a<br>
predetermined value comprising measuring an indicator voltage by means of a voltage sensor.<br>
10.	The method as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 9, the switching devices comprising IGBT<br>
switches connected between each end of the motor winding and positive and negative side of the DC<br>
bus respectively, a diode being connected in parallel with each switch, the diodes enabling the motor<br>
to act as a generator and feed current into the DC bus to assist the capacitor in maintaining the bus<br>
voltage until the motor is run down.<br><br>
A power control system (12) for an electric motor having at least one magnetic bearing has a<br>
DC/DC converter (18) supplied from a DC link bus (179) connected to a main power supply (14), the<br>
bus (17) supplying power for the electric motor and for a bearing actuator; the converter (18)<br>
provides a low voltage DC power supplies for a motor controller (23), a bearing controller (24) and a<br>
supervisory controller (26), the later monitoring the main power supply and communicating with the<br>
motor controller (23) and bearing controller (24) so as to cause the motor to operate as a generator in<br>
the event of a failure of the main power supply (14) to thereby supply power to the DC link bus (17)<br>
to maintain operation of the magnetic bearing. Circuit switching components are connected to the<br>
motor winding and selectively switched in a manner causing current generated in the motor winding<br>
to flow in one direction into the DC link bus (17) only while the winding voltage is greater than that<br>
of the DC link bus(17)<br></td>
