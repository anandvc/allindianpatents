				<td>The present invention relates to novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]beuzodiazpines useful as antitumour agents. This invention also relates to a process for preparation of novel pyirolo[2,l-c][l,4] benzodiazepines useful as antirumour agents. More particularly, it provides a process for the preparation of 2-(3-[7-methoxy-5~oxo-(llaS)-2,3,5,lla-teti ahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1 -c][ 1,4]bem:odiazepme-8-yloxy]alkyl]-2,3 -dihydro- lH-benzo (de]isoquinolin-l,3-dione, with aliphatic chain length variations for the compounds, The structural formula of novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine is as follows wherein R is H, OH, R1 is OCH3, R2 is H, NH2 and n is 2 to 15.<br>
Pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine antitumour antibiotics are commonly known as anthramycin class of compounds. A large number of these compounds have been studied for their in vitro anticancer activity. These compounds exhibit their anticancer or antitumour activity by covalently binding with the DNA at N2 of guanine. These Pyrrolobenzodiazepine antibiotics exhibit their antitumour activity by forming an adduct in the minor groove of DNA, thus interfering with DNA processing. After insertion in the minor groove an aminal bond is formed through nucleophilic attack of the N2 of a guanine base at the electrophilic Cll position. (Ref. Kunimoto, S. Masuda, T. Kanbayashi, N. Hamada, M. Naganawa, H. Miyamoto, M. Takeuchi, T. and Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot., 1980,33, 665.; Kohn, K.W. and Speous, C.L. J. Mol. Biol, 1970, 57, 551.; Hurley, L.H. Gairpla, C. and Zmijewski, M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 1977, 475, 521.; Kaplan, D.J. and Hurley, L.H. Biochmestry, 1981,20,7572.)<br>
However, the clinical efficacy for these antibiotics is hindered by several limitations, such as poor water solubility and cardiotoxicity and development of dmg resistance and me abolic inactivation.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine useful as antitumour agenti. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepines useful as antitumour agents.<br>
The compounds of present invention has a difference with C-8 linked napthalimides congeners by the replacement of phenolic hydrogen of (1 laS)-8-Hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,2,3,11 a-tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1 -c][ 1,4]benzodiazepine-5-one(DC-81). Naphthalimides are a class of compounds that bind to DNA by intercalation of the chromophore group and show high antitumour activity against a variety of murine and human tumour ceils. These are a new class of DNA interacting agents, which exerf their antitumour activity through the inhibition of topoisomerase-II.<br>

The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL), filtered through a sintered funnel and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The clear yellow organic supernatant was extracted with    saturated aq.NaHCO3 (2x20 mL), brine (2x20 mL) the combined aqueous phase was back extracted with ethyl acetate (2x20 mL). The combined organic phase was dried over Na2S04 and then filtered through a short bed of celite. The filtrate was evaporated under vacuum to afford2- {4-[2-Hydroxy-7-methoxy-5-oxo(2R, 11 a-tetrahydro-5H-pyyyolo {2,1 -c][ 1,4]benzodiazepine-8-yloxy]butyl} -2,3-dihydro- lH-benzo[de]isoquinolin-1,3-dione (formula IV) as yellow oil which was purified by flash chromatography using ethyl acetate as eluent.<br>

Biological Activity: In rirro biological activity studies were carried out at National Cancer Institute (USA).<br>
In vitro human cell line assay: For each compound dose response curves for each cell line were measured with five different concentrations and the concentration causing 50% cell growth inhibitions observed. The dose-response curves of some tumour carcinoma sensitive to the compounds (IVa, IVc) are shown and discussed below. These dose response curves were plotted, the percentage growth of each cell line against different concentrations of the compounds in logarithmic values.<br>
Dose response curves: Compound IVa is effective towards the (e.g. NCI-H23 &amp; NCI-H522) from small cell lung cancer, (e.g. HT 29) from colon cancer, (e.g. SF-539) from CNS cancer, (e.g. RPMI-8226 &amp; SR) from leukaemia, (e.g. MALME-3M &amp; SK-MEL-2) from melanoma cancer, (e.g. UO-31, RXF-393, SN 12C, ACHN &amp; CAKI-1) from renal cancer and (e.g. MIDA-N) from breast cancer.<br>
Compound IVc is effective towards the (e.g. NCI, HOP-92, H322M, HOP-62 &amp; NCI-H522) from small cell lung cancer, (e.g. KM12 &amp; COLO205) from colon cancer, (e.g. SNB-75 &amp; SF-539) from CNS cancer, (e.g. RXF393, UO-31, &amp; A498) from renal cancer, (e.g. MALME-3M, LOXIMVI, SK-MEL-5 &amp; SK-MEL-2) from melanoma cancer, (e.g. BT-549 &amp; NCyADR-RES) from breast cancer and (e.g. OVCEAR-3, OVCEAR-4 &amp; IGROVI) from ovarian cancer. These compounds showed total growth inhibition of all the cell lines at 10-6 molar concentration.<br>
Mean Graph: The mean graph of the compound IVa shown and discussed below. In these mean graphs, the log10 GI 50 of compound expressed in the form of mean graphs. In these graphs, the mean logarithmic value of GI 50 in all cell lines for each compound is used as mid point of the bar graph. Bars extending to the right represent sensitivity of the cell lines to the test agent in excess of the average sensitivity of all tested cell lines. The bar scale is<br>
logarithmic, therefore, a bar two units to the right shows the compound achieved the GI 50 for the cell line at a concentration one-hundredth the mean concentration required overall the cell lines thus, the cell line is unusually sensitive to the compound. Bars to the left correspondingly imply sensitivity less than the mean. The log 10 TGI and log10 LC 50 values for these compounds were also measured and expressed with similar bar mean graphs.<br>
Mean Graph for the Compound: Figure logio GI 50 mean graph of compound IVa the in vitro antitumour activity against human tumour cell lines [logio GI 50: The logarithmic concentration required to produce 50% of the growth inhibition]. Responses to the right of the mean logio GI 50 line (the mid point of the bar graph) are more sensitive than the mean, while those on the left are more resistant, (data from NCI)<br>
As demonstrated by the mean graph pattern these compounds have similar selectivity over leukaemia (e.g. PML-8226, SR), non small cell lung cancer (e.g. NCI-H23 &amp; NCI-H522), renal cancer (e.g. UO-31, RXF393, SN12C, ACHN &amp; CAKI-1), breast cancer (e.g. MIDA-N), melanoma cancer (e.g. MALME-3M &amp; SK-MEL-2), and colon cancer (e.g. HT29) cell lines. However some compounds shown increased selectivity towards renal cancer cell lines (e.g. VO-31, RXF393, SN12C, ACHN &amp; CAKI-1). In general all the compounds shown greater activity towards all cell lines. Mid points of logio TGI and logio LC 50 showed similar patterns to the logio GI 50 mean graph mid points.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
