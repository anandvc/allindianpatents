BACKGROUND PRIOR ART<br>
Menopause, the transition in women from the reproductive to the non-reproductive stage of life, is characterized by the cessation of menstruation and occurs at an average age of fifty years. The post-menopausal state is characterized by changes in<br>
the levels of circulating sex hormones, the most dramatic of which is the reduction in plasma levels of 17-beta-estradiol to less than ten percent of pre-menopausal values. Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that the post-menopausal state is an important risk factor for a number of chronic disorders and is often referred to as Post Menopausal Syndrome. In view of the fact that the current life span of women is about eighty years, women spend approximately one-third of their lives in the postmenopausal state. This means that the potential for chronic effects of the postmenopausal state on women's health is greater today than at the turn of the century when life expectancy was considerably shorter.<br>
Estrogen deficiency is the most important risk factor associated with Post Menopausal Syndrome. Some of the major effects of the Post Menopausal Syndrome that are source of greatest long-term medical concern include osteoporosis, bone loss, bone formation, cardiovascular effects more particularly hyperlipidaemia, thrombosis and vasomotor disorders, neurodegenerative effects such as stroke, senile dementia-Alzheimer type and Parkinson disease, menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, urogenital atrophy, depression, mania, schizophrenia, urinary incontinence, relief of dysmenorrhea; relief of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, an aid in ovarian development, treatment of acne, hirsutism.<br>
Osteoporosis can be defined as a reduction in bone mass per unit volume with an alteration in bone microarchitecture that results in an increased susceptibility to fractures. It is not surprising that the most common fractures are those associated with bones, which are highly dependent on trabecular support, for example the vertebrae, the neck, and the weight bearing bone such as the femur, and the fore arm. Indeed the hip fracture, collies fractures and vertebrae crush fractures are hallmarks of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In most cases, bone loss occurs as a result of increased bone destruction (resorption) relative to bone formation and most women lose from about 20% to 60% of the bone mass in the trabecular compartment of the bone within 3 to 6 years after the menopause. Osteoporosis, more particularly the post-menopausal osteoporosis represents a major problem in women health care and poses a risk to quality of life during old age. Efforts to reduce this risk factor and incidence of fractures have resulted in the development of compounds that conserve skeletal mass by inhibiting bone resorption and/or by enhancing bone formation (Dwivedi I, Ray S, 1995 "Recent developments in the chemotherapy of osteoporosis" Progress in Drug Research 45, 289-338, Editor E Jucker, Birkhauser Vela; Marshall DH, Horsmann A,<br>
Nordin   BEC,   1977,   "The   prevention   and   management   of  post-menopausal osteoporosis"  Acta  Obstet  Gynecol  Scand  (Suppl)  65:49-56;  Hutchinson TA, Polansky SM, Feinstein AR,  1979,    "Postmenopausal estrogen protect against fractures of hip and distal radius: A care-control study" Lancet 2:705-709. Estrogen replacement therapy also has positive effect on CVS &amp; CNS related disorders (Lobo RA, 1990, "Cardiovascular implication of estrogen replacement therapy" Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 75:185-245; Mendelson ME, Karas RH, 1994, "Estrogen and the blood vessel wall" Current opinion in Cardiology 1994:619-626; Stampfer MJ, Colditz GA, 1991, "Estrogen replacement therapy and coronary heart disease: a quantitative assessment of the epidemiological evidence" Preventive Medicine 20:47-63). Cardiovascular disease is another leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older women.  Menopause and ageing increase risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.  An altered lipid profile is thought to be associated with this increased risk. Compared to men, pre-menopausal women are relatively more protected from cardiovascular diseases. This protection is gradually lost following menopause. This loss of protection has been linked to the loss of estrogen and in particular to the loss of estrogen's stationary phase ability to regulate the level of serum lipids. The nature of estrogens ability to reduce serum lipids is not well understood, but evidences indicate that estrogen can up-regulate LDL receptors in the liver which act to remove excess cholesterol.    Additionally, estrogen appears to have some effects on the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. Estrogen is also believed to directly influence vessel wall compliance, reduce peripheral resistance and prevent atherosclerosis. It is also reported that serum lipids in post-menopausal women having estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) return to concentrations found in the pre-menopausal state (Gruber CJ, Tschugguel W, Schneeberger C, Huber JC, 2002, "Production and actions of estrogens" The New England Journal of Medicine 346:340-352; Bellino FL, Wise PM, 2003 "Nonhuman primate models of menopause workshop" Biology of Reproduction 68:10-18; Lobo RA 1990, "Cardiovascular implication of estrogen replacement therapy", Obstetrics and Gynaecology 75.18S-24S; Medelson ME, Karas RD 1994, "Estrogen and the blood vessel wall", Current opinion in Cardiology, 1994 (9):619-626).   Based on available  epidemiological  data,  the  overall   impact of these  physiological  and pharmacological actions of estrogen is an age independent reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in women (Knnel WH, Hjortland M, McNamara PM, 1976<br>
"Menopause and risk of cardiovascular disease: The Framingham Study", Ann Int Med 8:5447-5552). Furthermore, a more recent analysis has concluded that postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by approximately 50 percent (Stampfer MJ, Colditz GA, 1991, "Estrogen replacement therapy and coronary heart disease: a quantitative assessment of the epidemiological evidence", Preventive Medicine 20:47-63).<br>
There is growing interest in recent years on neuroprotective effects of estrogens for neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.     Reports of greater brain damage in males than  in  females and in ovariectomized than intact female animals in ischemic stroke models are available. Estrogen is also known to increase density of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and increase neuronal sensitivity to input mediated by these receptors in neurons of hippocampus, the area involved in memory.   The estradiol-depleted state in postmenopausal women has been correlated with increased incidence of stroke, cognitive defects, hot flashes, mood changes, and early onset and severity of Alzheimer disease. Some epidemiological data suggests that in post-menopausal women, estrogen deficiency is associated with decline in cognitive function and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (Gruber CJ, Tschugguel W, Schneeberger C, Huber JC, 2002 "Production and actions of estrogens", The New England Journal of Medicine 346:340-352; Dhandapani KM, Brann DW, 2002, "Protective effects of estrogen and Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators in the brain" Biology of Reproduction 67:1379-1385).   Short-term studies in human subjects have shown that increased levels of estrogen are associated with higher memory scores in post-menopausal women (Kampen DL, Sherwin BB, 1994 "Estrogen use and verbal memory in healthy postmenopausal women", Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 83:979-983; Ohkura T, Isse K, Akazawa K, Hamanioto M, Yoshimasa Y, Hagino N, 1995, "Long-term estrogen replacement therapy in female patients with dementia of the Alzheimer Type: 7 Case reports", Dementia 6:99-107). Furthermore, the administration of exogenous estrogen to  surgically  post-menopausal  women  specially  enhances  short-term   memory. Moreover, the effects as epidemiological findings indicate that estrogen treatment significantly  decreases  the  risk  of senile  dementia-Alzheimer type  in  women (Paganini-Hill A, Henderson VW, 1994, "Estrogen deficiency and risk of Alzheimer's disease in women", Am J Epidemiol 100:256-261; Ohkura T, Isse K, Akazawa K, Hamamoto M, Yoshimasa Y, Hagino N,  1995, "Long-term estrogen replacement<br>
therapy in female patients with dementia of the Alzheimer Type: 7 case reports", Dementia 6:99-107). While the mechanism whereby estrogens enhance cognitive function is unknown, it is possible to speculate that the direct effects of estrogen on cerebral blood flow (Goldman H, Skelley Eb, Sandman CA, Kastin AJ, Murphy S, 1976, "Hormones and regional brain blood flow", Pharnacik Biochem Rev 5 (suppl 1): 165-169; Ohkura T, Teshima Y, Isse K, Mastuda H, Inoue T, Sakai Y, Iwasaki N, Yaoi Y, 1995, "Estrogen increases cerebral and cerebellar blood flows in postmenopausal women", Menopause: J North Am Menopause Soc 2:13-18) and neuronal cell activities (Singh M, Meyer EM, Simpkins JW, 1995, "The effect of ovariectomy and estradiol replacement on brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger ribonucleic acid expression in cortical and hippocampal brain regions of female Sprague-Dawley rats", Endocrinology 136:4120-4124; McMillan PJ, Singer CA, Dorsa DM, 1996, "The effects of ovariectomy and estrogen replacement on trkA and choline acetyltransferase mRNA expression in the basal forebrain of the adult female Sprague-Dawley rat", Neurosci 16:1860-1865).<br>
Even though the beneficial effects of estrogen replacement on a wide variety of organ systems and tissues appear indisputable, the dose and duration of estrogen therapy is also associated with an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. The use of concomitant cyclic progestins does reduce the risk of endometrial pathology, but this is achieved at the expense of the return of regular uterine bleeding, a result that is objectionable to many patients. In addition to estrogen's stimulatory effect on the endometrium, there remains considerable controversy regarding reports of an association between long-term estrogen replacement and an increased risk of breast cancer (Bergkvist L, Adami HO, Persson I, Hoover R, Schairer C, 1989, "The risk of breast cancer after estrogen and estrogen-progestin replacement", N Eng J Med, 321:293-297; Coiditz GA, Hankinson SE, Hunter DJ, Willett WX, Manson JE, Stampfer MJ, Hennekens C, Rosner B, Speizer FE, 1995, "The use of estrogens and progestins and the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women", N Eng J Med 332:1593). Furthermore, there are other side effects of estrogen replacements, which, while might not be life threatening, contraindicate estrogen's use and reduce patient compliance.<br>
Breast cancer is by far the most common malignant disease in women (22% of all new cancer cases). Concerted efforts are being made worldwide to develop new and safer drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. Tamoxifen ('Nolvadex'), a selective<br>
estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), is currently the most widely used drug for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+ve) breast cancer. Tamoxifen inhibits the estrogen-dependent growth of cancer cells by competitive binding to estrogen receptors of the cells. However, as tamoxifen has also estrogen-like effects, it induces, among other adverse effects, endometrial cancer, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in women undergoing the therapy. In addition, tamoxifen is known to induce DNA adduct formation and produced liver tumors in rodent life-term bioassays. Thus there is an urgent need for developing safer SERMs for the treatment of breast cancer (Baum M, Odling-Smee W, Houghton J, Riley D, Taylor H, 1994, "Endometrial cancer during tamoxifen treatment", Lancet 343:1291; Clemons M, Danson S, Howell A, 2002, "Tamoxifen ('Nolvadex'): Antitumour treatment. A review", Cancer Treatment Reviews 28:165-180; Huggins, C, Yang NC, 1962, "Induction and extinction of mammary cancer", Science 137:257-262; Williams GM, Latropoulos, MJ, Djordjevic MV, Kaltenberg OP, 1993, "The triphenylethylene drug tamoxifen is a strong liver carcinogen in the rat", Carcinogenesis 10:315-317; Meier CR, Jick H, 1998, "Tamoxifen and risk of idiopathic venous thromboembolism", Br J Clin Pharmacol 45:608-612).<br>
Egg-implantation in most mammals is dependent on a sequential action of estrogen and progesterone on the uterus and is considered as a preferential peripheral site for contraception. Development of hormone antagonists (both antiestrogens and antiprogestins) which inhibit action of endogenous hormones at the receptor level resulting in inhibition of implantation is one of the promising approaches for control or regulation of fertility in humans and other animals. Previous studies have revealed that administration of estrogen antagonists, recently termed as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs), due to their tissue selective action) to cyclic or mated females prevents implantation. Studies also reveal their uterine specific action, inhibiting endometrial receptivity to embryonic signal(s) for decidualisation, without affecting pre-implantation development of embryos up to the blastocyst stage (Singh MM, 2001, "Centchroman, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, as contraceptive and in the management of hormone related clinical disorders", Medicinal Research Reviews 21:302-347; Nityanand S, Chandravati, Singh L, Srivastava JS, Kamboj VP, 1988, "Clinical evaluation of centchroman: A new oral contraceptive", In: Hormone Antagonists for Fertility Regulation, Eds Puri CP, Van Look PFA, Indian Society for the Study of Reproduction and Fertility, Bombay, India, 241-410; Puri V, Kamboj<br>
VP, Chandra H, Ray S, Kole PL, Dhawan BN, Anand N, 1988, "Results of multicentric trial of centchroman", In: Pharmacology for Health in Asia, Eds Dhawan BN, Agarwal KK, Arora RB, Parmar SS, Allied Publishers, New Delhi, 441-447; Nityanand S, Kamboj VP, Chandravati, Das K, Gupta K, Rohtagi P, Baveja R, Jina R, Mitra R, Sharma U, 1994, "Contraceptive efficacy and safety of centchroman with biweekly-cum-weekly schedule", In: Current Concepts in Fertility Regulation and Reproduction, Eds Puri CP, Van Look PFA, Wiley Eastern Ltd., New Delhi, 61-68; Nityanand S, Gupta RC, Kamboj VP, Srivastava PK, Berry M, 1995, "Centchroman: Current Status as a contraceptive", Indian Progress in Family Welfare 10:26-31; Nityanand S, Anand N, 1996, "Centchroman: A nonsteroidal antifertility agent",<br>
FOGSI FOCUS, March issue: 8-1O). Such SERMs have also been successfully used for induction of ovulation in amenorrhic women under the assisted reproduction programmes (Roy SN, Kumari GL, Modoiya K, Prakash V, Ray S, 1976, "Induction of ovulation in human with centchroman, a preliminary report", Fertility and Sterility 41:1108-111O) and suppression of post-partum lactation (Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Seventh Edition) Macmillan Publishing Company, 1985, pages 1321-1041).<br>
From the foregoing discussion it would appear that the availability of therapies which possess the ideal pharmacological profile and could mimic the beneficial actions of estrogen on the bone, cardiovascular system and central nervous system without the undesirable side effects on uterus and breast, would essentially provide a "safe estrogen" which could dramatically influence the number of patients that would be able to benefit from estrogen replacement therapy. Therefore, in recognition of estrogen's beneficial effects on a number of body systems and disease conditions, there is a continuing need for the development of potent estrogen agonists which can selectively target different body tissues. Accordingly, the present invention provides new compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions thereof and methods of using such compounds for the prevention or treatment of:<br>

Biological evaluation<br>
The compounds of the present invention were evaluated for use for the prevention or treatment of symptoms of estrogen deficiency or deprivation including estrogen deficient or deprivation state in mammals, in particular osteoporosis, bone loss, bone formation, cardiovascular effects more particularly hyperlipidaemia, prevention or the treatment of estrogen dependent or estrogen independent cancers such as cancer of breast and control or regulation of fertility in humans and in other animals. Detailed procedures for the evaluation of the compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or compositions thereof are described hereunder: Test procedure for evaluation of antiosteoporosis (antiresorptive) activity in vitro<br>
Test solutions of the compounds of the present invention are prepared in appropriate solvents in concentration range of 5 millimolar to 400 millimolar, most preferably in concentrations of 20 millimolar. 5 ul of each concentration are used for evaluation of antiresorptive activity in vitro. In control experiments, 5 ul of appropriate solvent is used in lieu of test compound. Femur bones are isolated from chick embryos on day 11 post-ovulation.   The adhering soft connective tissue is<br>
completely removed. Each femur bone is then placed in a drop of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and is transferred to BGJb culture medium containing 45CaCl2 and incubated for 2 h. Labeled femur bones are washed 2-3 times with PBS and transferred to BGJb medium containing parathyroid hormone and cultured for 96 h in the presence or absence of the compound of invention or the vehicle in BGJb medium. Contralateral femur of each fetus serves as corresponding control. Culture medium with the respective treatment in each well is changed after 48 h. On termination of the culture at 96 h, bones are transferred to 0.1 N HCI for 24 h. Radioactivity due to 45Ca in the spent medium collected at 48 and 96 h of culture and HCI extract at 96 h of culture is quantified by Liquid Scintillation Spectrophotometer in 10 ml of the scintillation fluid. Bone resorbing activity is expressed as percentage of 45Ca released into the culture medium and the effect of the compound of invention as percent of the corresponding contra-lateral control or T/C ratio as shown below: 45Ca resorption in presence of PTH + test agent<br>
T/C ratio =	<br>
45Ca resorption in presence of PTH + vehicle Appropriate solvents are selected from solvents like water, normal saline, phosphate  buffered  saline,   phosphate  buffer,   DMSO  alone  or   in  a  suitable combination thereof.<br>
In accordance with the above test procedure, the compounds of the present invention, on employing or administering their effective amounts, exhibit positive response by inhibiting the PTH induced resorption of 45Ca from chick fetal bones in culture. This compound showed promising antiresorptive activity in vitro using chick foetal bone assay with T/C ratio of 0.4 to 0.8 at 25 µM to 100 uM concentrations in comparisions to Raloxifene having T/C of 0.6 (Table 1). It was devoid of any pos-coital antifertility and estrogenic activities in rats. Activity in the above test procedure indicates that the compounds of the present invention are useful as antiresorptive agents in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis.

Test procedure for evaluation of antiosteoporosis activity in vivo<br>
The in vivo antiosteoporosis activity is evaluated in colony-bred adult (3-4 month old) female Sprague-Dawley rats or female retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats (12-10 months old; parity &gt;3).   Animals are bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) under light ether anesthesia and treated with the compound of the present invention, 17-alfa-ethynylestradiol (EE) or the vehicle once daily on days 1-30 post-ovariectomy (day 1: day of bilateral ovariectomy) by the oral route. One group of females is sham operated and treated similarly with the vehicle.    Animals of all the groups are autopsied 24 h after the last treatment. Before autopsy, 24 h fasting urine samples are collected in fresh containers using all-glass metabolic cages and stored at -20°C until analyzed for calcium, phosphorus and creatinine.   At autopsy, about 5 ml blood samples are collected by cardiac puncture from each rat under light ether anesthesia and serum is isolated and stored at -20°C until analyzed for total and bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and calcium. Uterus of each rat is carefully excised, gently blotted, weighed and fixed for histology. Representative sections (5 u.m) from each uterus are stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Femur and tibia of each rat are then dissected free of adhering tissue, fixed in 70% ethanol in physiological saline and stored at -20°C until Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measurement.   Before autopsy, whole body scan of each rat for measurement of BMD is performed on an Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer, calibrated daily with Hologic hydroxyapatite anthropomorphic spine phantom using manufacturer provided software for small animals. BMD measurement of isolated bones is performed using identical regions of interest.    Serum total alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, calcium ion content and urinary calcium and creatinine are estimated colorimetrically using commercial kits.

Test procedure for evaluation of anti-hyperlipidaemic activity<br>
The in vivo anti-hyperlipidaemic activity is evaluated in colony-bred adult (3-4 month old) female Sprague-Dawley rats or female retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats (12-10 months old; parity &gt;3). Animals are bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) under light ether anesthesia and treated with the compound of the present invention, 17-alfa-ethynylestradiol (EE) or the vehicle once daily on days 1-30 post-ovariectomy (day 1: day of bilateral ovariectomy) by the oral route. One group of females is sham operated and treated similarly with the vehicle. Animals of all the groups are autopsied 24 h after the last treatment. At autopsy, about 5 ml blood samples are collected by cardiac puncture from each rat under light ether anesthesia and serum is isolated and stored at -20°C until analyzed for total cholesterol. The total cholesterol concentration is measured by a timed-end point method using a Beckman Synchron CX autoanalyser. In the reaction, cholesterol estrase hydrolyses cholesterol esters to free cholesterol and fatty acids. Free cholesterol is oxidized to cholestene-3-one and H2O2 by cholesterol oxidase. Peroxidase catalyses the reaction of H2O2 with 4-amino antipyrine and phenol to produce a colored quinoneimine product. Absorbance is recorded at 520 nm.

Test procedure for evaluation of anti-cancer breast activity in vivo.<br>
Compound(s) of invention identified on the basis of the above test are evaluated in vivo for anticancer breast activity using the well established and widely used rodent model of hormone responsive breast cancer namely, 7,12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) induced rat mammary tumor model. Healthy female Sprague-Dawley rats (50-60 days of age) are given a single oral administration of DMBA (180 mg/kg) and the mammary tumor development is monitored by weekly palpation of the mammary tracks. Body weight of the animals is recorded weekly. All animals are used and handled adhering to the Animal Ethics Committee guidelines for humane treatment of animals. The animals have free access to standard rodent pellet diet and safe drinking water and are housed in temperature and photoperiod-controlled animal quarters throughout the experimental period. When palpable mammary tumors develop and reach approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, the tumor bearing rats are grouped and receive oral administration of the test compound at a<br>
daily dose of 10-mg/kg body weight for 4 weeks. Tumor incidence, number and area/volume are recorded at the commencement of the treatment and at weekly intervals. The diameter of tumors is measured using calipers and the tumor volume is derived using the formula for sphere volume. The compound is considered active against mammary tumor if, by the end of treatment period, the tumor volume decreases by more than 25% or remains static or when the volume shows less than 25% increase over the pre-treatment volume (Graph-1).<br>

Twenty-one-day-old  immature  female  rats  are  bilaterally ovariectomized<br>
*<br>
under light ether anaesthesia and, after post-operative rest for 7 days, are randomized into different treatment groups. Each rat receives the compound of the invention once daily for 3 consecutive days on days 28-30 of age. A separate group of animals receiving only the vehicle for similar duration serves as control. At autopsy 24 h after the last treatment on day 31 of age, vaginal smear of each rat is taken and uterus is carefully excised, gently blotted, weighed and fixed for histology and histomorphometry using image analysis. Premature opening of vagina, cornification of vaginal epithelium, increase in uterine fresh weight, total uterine and endometrial area and uterine luminal epithelial cell height are taken as parameters for evaluation of estrogen agonistic activity in comparison to rats of vehicle control group. Table 6: Increase in uterine weight: Percent of OVX+vehicle treatment group<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
For image analysis in estrogen agonistic activity evaluation studies, paraffin sections (6 um thick) of the uterus stained with haematoxylin and eosin were analysed microscopically. To determine changes in uterine tissue components, areas of whole uterus and endometrium and the thickness of uterine epithelium were measured using a computer-image analysis system (BioVis, Expert Vision, India). Briefly, microscopic images of uterus acquired through a CCD camera were loaded in to the image analysis program and spatially calibrated against a stage micrometer image taken at the same magnification. Using thresholding and line tools, the regions for measurements were selected and the area (mm2) of whole uterine transection<br>
excluding the luminal space, the area (mm2) of the endometrium only, and the thickness (um) of luminal epithelial lining were measured.    Luminal epithelial thickness data was the average of measurements made at 6 randomly selected sites of the lining. Table 7:   Estrogen agonistic activity: Effect on uterine morphometry<br>

Twenty-one-day-old   immature  female  rats  are  bilaterally ovariectomized<br>
under light ether anaesthesia and after post-operative rest for 7 days, are randomized<br>
into different treatment groups. Each rat receives the compounds of the invention and<br>
0.02 mg/kg dose of 17-alfa-ethynylestradiol in 10% ethanol-distilled water once daily<br>
for 3 consecutive days on days 28-30 of age. A separate group of animals receiving<br>
only 17-alfa-ethynylestradiol (0.02 mg/kg) in 10% ethanol-distilled water for similar<br>
duration are used for comparison. At autopsy on day 31 of age, vaginal smear of each<br>
rat is taken and uterus is carefully excised, gently blotted, weighed and fixed for<br>
histology and  histomorphometry using  image analysis.     Inhibition  in  17-alfa-<br>
ethynylestradiol-induced premature opening of vagina,  cornification of vaginal<br>
epithelium, increase in uterine fresh weight, total uterine and endometrial area and<br>
uterine luminal epithelial cell height are taken as parameters for evaluation of<br>
estrogen antagonistic activity.<br>

Test procedure for evaluation of relative binding affinity (RBA) to estrogen receptors<br>
The relative binding affinity (RBA) of the compounds for estrogen receptor<br>
was determined by competition assay, employing 3H-estradiol (3H-E2) as the radioligand. The test ligands and 3H-E2 were incubated at 4°C with cytosol estrogen receptors obtained from uteri of immature estradiol-primed (1 ug/rat 24 h before autopsy) 20-21 days old rats. Aliquot of uterine cytosol (200 µ1; 2 uteri per ml) prepared in TEA buffer (10 mM Tris, 1.5 mM EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4) were incubated in duplicate with a fixed concentration of 3H-E2 in the absence or presence of various concentrations of the competitor substance dissolved in 30 jil of the TEA buffer containing DMF as co-solvent (final concentration of DMF in the incubation mixture never exceeded 5%) for 18 hrs at 4°C. At the end of this period, dextran coated charcoal (5% Norit 0.5% dextran) suspension in 100 µl of TEA buffer was added to each tube, which were briefly vortexed and allowed to stand for 15 minutes at 4°C. The mixture was centrifuged at 800 g for 10 minutes and the supernatants counted for radioactivity in 10 ml of a dioxane-based scintillation fluid. RBA of the text compound was computed from a graph plotted between percent bound radioactivity verses log concentration of the test substance. At 50% inhibition, log of the competitor concentration relative to that of 17-beta-estradiol, gave the affinity of the test compound to estrogen receptor relative to estradiol. This when multiplied with 100 gave the percentage value designated as RBA.<br>
