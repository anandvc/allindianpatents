CROISS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of<br>
and priority to prior filed co-pending U.S.<br>
provisional application serial No. 60/462,234,<br>
filed April 11, 2003, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a<br>
method and apparatus for storing hydrogen. More<br>
specifically, the invention relates to storing and<br>
transporting hydrogen by employing carbon dioxide<br>
as a storage medium.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0001] Fossil fuels such as methane (CH4)<br>
provide energy but at the expense of producing CO2<br>
emissions. Renewable energy sources such as solar<br>
power and wind provide intermittent energy,<br>
including electrical energy, that is difficult to<br>
store, and as such, is not easily useable to<br>
supplement energy demands. However, energy from<br>
renewable sources can be used to easily produce<br>
hydrogen by electrolyzing water. Furthermore,<br>
hydrogen can be obtained by reforming hydrocarbon<br>
products such as methane or diesel fuel. Hydrogen<br>
can also be produced by nuclear power,<br>
electrolysis or steam electrolysis (making use of<br>
waste heat).<br><br>
[0002] Accordingly, hydrogen storage has been'<br>
an area of intense research because hydrogen is<br>
abundant and a superior fuel for many<br>
applications. Hydrogen may be used to produce<br>
electricity by employing a device such as a fuel<br>
cell, which produces only water vapor as a<br>
byproduct. Hydrogen is a favored fuel because<br>
fuel cells are more efficient at using the energy<br>
content of hydrogen than internal combustion<br>
engines are at using the energy content of diesel<br>
fuel or gasoline (roughly 40% versus 30% energy<br>
usage). However, fuel cells are not mature<br>
technologies. Furthermore, there are concerns<br>
with transporting hydrogen.<br>
[0003] There are difficulties involved with<br>
hydrogen storage. Although hydrogen has very high<br>
energy capacity per unit mass, it has a very low<br>
density, even in liquid form, and consequently is<br>
very bulky as a fuel. Storage is a major concern<br>
especially for mobile applications, as the tank<br>
must be on board the vehicle. A liter of<br>
hydrogen, compressed to 400 times standard<br>
pressure, contains only the energy value of .24<br>
liters of gasoline or diesel, even taking into<br>
account the improved efficiency of fuel cells. A<br>
liter of liquefied hydrogen has a higher energy<br>
value than the compressed hydrogen referenced<br>
above is a bit better, equal to about .475 liter<br>
of gasoline. Hydrogen must be made very cold to<br>
liquefy, about -423 F/-253C, which requires energy<br>
input. Tanks that are designed to retain liquid<br>
hydrogen are also expensive. Hydrogen can be<br>
compressed to 660 times atmospheric pressure or<br><br>
more, but this requires additional energy, and<br>
these tanks become very expensive to build.<br>
[0004] Because of the problems of storing<br>
hydrogen directly, other fuel sources that can be<br>
stored more easily are sought. These compounds<br>
are then processed, or reformed, to release the<br>
hydrogen for use. Compounds such as these include<br>
methanol, ethanol, methane, and even gasoline, can<br>
be reformed to release hydrogen. One problem with<br>
this method is that carbon dioxide is released,<br>
which means it is not a useable strategy for a<br>
zero emission vehicle (ZEV). Furthermore, these<br>
fuels do not leverage renewable energy sources.<br>
[0005] Other compounds, such as hydrides can be<br>
used to hold hydrogen. Some metal hydrides can be<br>
heated to release their hydrogen and then later<br>
must be restored or "recharged" during a refueling<br>
process. Other hydrides, such as sodium<br>
borohydride, release hydrogen when exposed to<br>
water but leave a residue on the storage material,<br>
which must be processed to be recharged.<br>
[0006] A final category for hydrogen storage is<br>
to use new or exotic materials, including<br>
nanotubes, to store hydrogen. The new materials<br>
have an immense array of tiny surfaces to which<br>
hydrogen can attach and then release, producing a<br>
storage mechanism. However, this technology is<br>
not yet mature or proven to work effectively.<br>
[0007] Thus, it is desirable to provide a cost<br>
effective means of storing hydrogen without having<br><br>
to expend a significant amount of energy to<br>
compress or liquefying the gas. Furthermore, it<br>
is desirable to provide a cost effective means of<br>
transporting hydrogen. It is further desirable to<br>
provide a method of effectively harnessing<br>
renewable energy sources. Lastly, it would be<br>
advantageous to provide an energy storage and<br>
transportation system that precludes net carbon<br>
dioxide emissions during energy consumption.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0023] With initial reference to FIG. 1, a<br>
schematic of an energy usage system according to<br>
the current state of the art is shown. A natural<br>
gas source 5, specifically a gas well, is in<br>
communication with a gas conduit 7 to transport<br>
natural gas to an energy user at a consumption<br>
location 8. The energy user will consume the<br>
natural gas by combustion of the natural gas with<br>
oxygen to generate heat and produce carbon dioxide<br><br>
and water as byproducts, assuming the combustion<br>
is ideal.<br>
[0024] Referring now to FIG. 2, a schematic of<br>
the energy usage system of FIG. 1 is shown,<br>
further comprising a renewable energy source 9,<br>
according to the current state of the art.<br>
Renewable energy sources are difficult to employ<br>
in order to supplement energy demand because the<br>
energy from renewable sources, such as wind and<br>
solar energy, are not consistent. Renewable<br>
energy sources can easily produce electricity, but<br>
can only sporadically reduce fixed loads from<br>
traditional electrical power sources. Electricity<br>
from renewable energy sources is also difficult to<br>
store in large quantities. Furthermore,<br>
electricity becomes inefficient to transmit via<br>
high voltage power lines more than a few hundred<br>
miles. Accordingly, renewable energy source 9 is<br>
shown not connected to the energy user at<br>
consumption location 8. Meanwhile, carbon dioxide<br>
is being released into the atmosphere, which is<br>
suspected to be a cause of global warming.<br>
[0025] The prior art reveals that the world's<br>
energy system has significant shortcomings,<br>
including the absence of an acceptable use of<br>
renewable energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions<br>
which threaten the world with global warming.<br>
[0026] A solution is desired to this problem<br>
that makes energy from renewable sources 9<br>
accessible, stable in price and quantity, and low<br>
cost. To address the role of renewable sources.<br><br>
and to avoid C02 emissions, a solution referred to<br>
as the hydrogen economy is considered.<br>
[0027] Referring now to PIG. 3, a schematic of<br>
an energy usage system is shown where natural gas<br>
and renewable energy are converted into hydrogen<br>
for transportation. Energy from renewable energy<br>
source 9 is converted to electrical energy, which<br>
is provided to an electrolyzer (not shown) to<br>
dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen. A<br>
hydrogen conduit 7 connects a renewable energy<br>
source 9 to a consumption location 8 for<br>
transportation of hydrogen gas. A reformer (not<br>
shown) may be employed to reform natural gas from<br>
a natural gas source 5 to hydrogen and carbon<br>
dioxide. A hydrogen conduit 7 connects a natural<br>
gas source 5 to the consumption location 8 for<br>
transporting hydrogen.<br>
[0028] In the present embodiment, renewable<br>
sources use electrical power to produce hydrogen<br>
by the electrolysis of water. The hydrogen is<br>
then conducted to consumers as a substitute for<br>
hydrocarbon fuel. Since the product from<br>
combustion of hydrogen is water, no carbon dioxide<br>
is produced. Additionally, fossil fuels are<br>
reformed into hydrogen as well to meet energy<br>
demands. The byproduct of the reforming step is<br>
carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide from the<br>
reforming step would have to be captured or simply<br>
vented. If the carbon dioxide is vented, the<br>
hydrogen economy does not avoid carbon dioxide<br><br>
emissions; the carbon dioxide emissions are simply-<br>
deferred .<br>
[0029] While the hydrogen economy setting seems<br>
to work in theory, there are some concerns with<br>
it. First, our entire infrastructure has to<br>
change to make use of hydrogen as a fuel. Second,<br>
hydrogen is bulky and difficult to transport or to<br>
store. Therefore, renewable sources would be<br>
accessible only after this hydrogen infrastructure<br>
is in place.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 4, a diagram of a<br>
carbon dioxide circuit 25 for transporting<br>
hydrogen is shown. The circuit 25 transports<br>
hydrogen from a point "A" 'to a point <br>
"B" by<br>
reacting the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to form<br>
a product, which in the preferred embodiment is<br>
methane. The diagram of FIG. 4 shows that by<br>
employing carbon dioxide as a storage medium,<br>
hydrogen may be transported from point "A" to<br>
point "B", returning the carbon dioxide to be<br>
"recharged" at point "A". The premise of the<br>
present invention is that it is more efficient to<br>
transport a product of a reaction between carbon<br>
dioxide and hydrogen, including a hydrocarbon,<br>
such as methane, or oxygenated hydrocarbon, such<br>
as methanol, and the carbon dioxide to be reacted<br>
with the hydrogen, than it is to transport<br>
hydrogen from a point "A" to a point "B".<br>
[0031] Between any two points A and B, it is<br>
cheaper to transport a mole of methane from A to B<br><br>
and a mole of carbon dioxide from B to A, than it<br>
is to simply transport hydrogen, of equal energy<br>
content, from A to B. For example, one mole of<br>
carbon dioxide reacts with four moles of hydrogen<br>
to produce one mole of methane and two moles of<br>
water.<br>
[0032] Although the present assertion seems<br>
counterintuitive, consider that the two major<br>
methods of moving hydrogen are either by a storage<br>
tank, or by a pipeline. In the case of the<br>
storage tank, it is well known that compressed<br>
methane is a more.dense energy carrier than<br>
hydrogen. Therefore, a given tank of methane will<br>
hold more energy than hydrogen at the same<br>
pressure. After discharging, the hydrogen tank<br>
must be returned empty to the source for<br>
refueling. The methane tank is instead filled<br>
with carbon dioxide on its return trip. The<br>
carbon dioxide is transported with the returned<br>
container.<br>
[0033] In the case of the pipeline, methane is<br>
more than twice as dense, from an energy per unit<br>
volume standpoint, than a given volume of hydrogen<br>
at the same pressure. Given two pipelines, the<br>
first containing methane, and the second<br>
containing carbon dioxide, moving in the opposite<br>
direction, can carry more energy than a single<br>
hydrogen pipeline that is more than twice the size<br>
of a methane pipeline, containing only hydrogen at<br>
the same pressure. Since methane is more than<br>
twice as dense energetically than hydrogen, even<br>
the combined compression costs of both the methane<br><br>
and carbon dioxide gases are less than hydrogen<br>
alone.<br>
[0034] This assertion can be more formally<br>
supported by considering the following. Hydrogen<br>
has an energy capacity of 33.90 kilowatt-<br>
hours/kilogram. Methane has a capacity of 13.44<br>
kilowatt-hours/kilogram. A mole of hydrogen is 2<br>
grams, yielding 500 moles of hydrogen per<br>
kilogram. A mole of methane is 16 grams, yielding<br>
62.5 moles of methane per kilogram. On a mole<br>
basis, the energy content of hydrogen is 0.0678<br>
kilowatt-hours/per mole. Methane, however, has a<br>
capacity of 0.215 kilowatt-hours per mole. The<br>
combustion of one mole of methane produces one<br>
mole of carbon dioxide. Accounting for the carbon<br>
dioxide, the energy capacity of methane/carbon<br>
dioxide is still 0.1075 kilowatt-hours/mole. This<br>
is more than 58% greater than hydrogen. Energy<br>
content per mole is important because the work<br>
required to compress a gas is dependent on the<br>
number of moles of the gas, not its weight. Not<br>
wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that<br>
methane and carbon dioxide require less energy to<br>
compress than hydrogen because each has a higher<br>
critical temperature and lower critical pressure<br>
than hydrogen does.<br>
[0035] Referring now to FIG. 5, a diagram of a<br>
carbon dioxide circuit 25 for transporting<br>
hydrogen from a reactor location 90 to a<br>
consumption location 80 is shown. A product<br>
conduit 60 is in communication with the reactor<br>
location 90 and consumption location 80 for<br><br>
transporting a product, which in the present<br>
embodiment is methane, from the reactor location<br>
90. A carbon dioxide conduit 70 is in<br>
communication with the consumption location 80 and<br>
the reactor location 90 for transporting carbon<br>
dioxide from the consumption location 80.<br>
[0036] Since it is cheaper to transport methane<br>
and carbon dioxide in a circuit, the hydrogen<br>
economy plan may be modified. Instead of<br>
employing a single pipe of hydrogen, substitute<br>
two pipes for the hydrogen pipe, one of methane<br>
going from energy production to energy use, and<br>
the other carbon dioxide going from energy user to<br>
energy production.<br>
[0037] At the energy consumption location 80,<br>
rather than venting carbon dioxide to the<br>
atmosphere, conduit 70 transports carbon dioxide<br>
back to the reactor location 90. Users of large<br>
quantities of energy retain C02 regularly,<br>
therefore, the ability to retain C02 is not a<br>
concern; the concern has been disposing of the<br>
retained C02. Accordingly, any method known in the<br>
art for sequestering C02 may be employed. The<br>
present invention that provides an apparatus and<br>
method for storage and transportation of hydrogen<br>
also provides a need for C02.<br>
[0038] Referring now to FIG. 6, a schematic of<br>
an operative element according to the principles<br>
of the present invention is shown. A reactor 40,<br>
which in the present embodiment is a Sabatier<br>
reactor, is in communication with a hydrogen<br><br>
source 20 and carbon dioxide source 30 to form a<br>
product 50, specifically, methane. Although a<br>
Sabatier reactor is disclosed herein, those<br>
skilled in the art will immediately recognize that<br>
any suitable substitute may be employed,<br>
including, but not limited to, photo-electrolyzing<br>
devices.<br>
[0039] Production of hydrogen for the present<br>
invention is accomplished by an electrolyzer,<br>
which dissociates water by introducing an<br>
electrical current, forming hydrogen and oxygen,<br>
as a byproduct. For example, 9 kilograms of water<br>
will produce 8 kilograms of oxygen and 1 kilogram<br>
of hydrogen, as demonstrated by the following<br>
chemical reaction:<br>
4H20 → 202 + 4H2<br>
[0040] A Sabatier reactor, in simple terms, is<br>
typically a metal tube containing a catalyst, such<br>
as nickel or ruthenium. The hydrogen reacts<br>
exothermically with the retained carbon dioxide to<br>
produce methane and water. As a Sabatier reactor<br>
is exothermic, energy is lost in the system. When<br>
hydrogen is reacted with carbon dioxide, about 79%<br>
of the energy content of hydrogen is stored as<br>
methane, with the balance released as heat. Some<br>
of the low-grade heat released by the Sabatier<br>
reactor may be employed for other uses. For<br>
example, 5.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide reacted<br>
with 1 kilograms of hydrogen will produce 2<br>
kilograms of methane and 4.5 kilograms of water,<br><br>
as demonstrated by the following chemical<br>
reaction:<br>
C02 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H20<br>
[0041] Overall, a renewable energy site may be<br>
60-80% efficient in producing methane according to<br>
the principles disclosed herein by using C02 as a<br>
carrier, versus 70-90% efficiency in producing<br>
hydrogen alone.<br>
[0042] Referring now to FIG. 7, a schematic of<br>
an apparatus according to the principles of the<br>
present invention is shown. Energy from a<br>
renewable energy source 15 is used to convert<br>
water to hydrogen and oxygen. As Buch, a<br>
renewable energy source 15 functions as a source<br>
of hydrogen by dissociating water. A conduit 70<br>
is in communication with a reactor (not shown in<br>
this figure) for transporting carbon dioxide to<br>
the reactor from a carbon dioxide source. The<br>
reactor causes hydrogen to react with the carbon<br>
dioxide to form a product, which in the present<br>
embodiment is methane.<br>
[0043] A conduit 60 transports the product to a<br>
consumption location 80. At the consumption<br>
location 80 the product is consumed in the<br>
presence of oxygen yielding water and carbon<br>
dioxide as byproducts. In the present embodiment,<br>
the consmption_location 80 is a source of carbon<br>
dioxide, which is used by the reactor to convert<br>
hydrogen to a product, such as a hydrocarbon or an<br>
oxygenated hydrocarbon. As such, carbon dioxide<br><br>
is employed as a storage medium for hydrogen. In<br>
addition, a renewable energy source may provide<br>
methane as a fuel source rather than low quality,<br>
intermittent electrical energy. Methane, in the<br>
form of natural gas, has long been economically<br>
transported in pipelines thousands of miles long,<br>
one of which extends from Louisiana to Michigan.<br>
Alternatively, electricity is uneconomical to<br>
transmit more than a few hundred miles due to<br>
resistance losses of the wires. Furthermore,<br>
carbon dioxide is not released into the<br>
environment, which provides an environmental<br>
benefit.<br>
[0044] Referring now to FIG. 8a, a schematic of<br>
an apparatus according to the principles of the<br>
present invention is shown, revealing an<br>
embodiment for hydrogen transportation. An<br>
electrolyzer 35 receives energy from a renewable<br>
energy source 15 and water to produce hydrogen.<br>
As such, electrolyzer 35 is a hydrogen source<br>
which is in communication with reactor 40.<br>
Reactor 40 is located at a reactor location 90,<br>
which may be any suitable location. A carbon<br>
dioxide source 3 0 provides carbon dioxide to the<br>
reactor 40. The reactor 40 causes the hydrogen to<br>
react with the carbon dioxide to form a product 50<br>
selected from the group consisting of a<br>
hydrocarbon and an oxygenated hydrocarbon. A<br>
product conduit 60 is in communication with the<br>
reactor 40 for transporting the product 50 to a<br>
consumption location 80. A carbon dioxide conduit<br>
70 is in communication with the consumption<br><br>
location 80 for transporting carbon dioxide to the<br>
reactor location 90.<br>
[0045] Referring now also to PIG. 8b, a<br>
schematic of an apparatus according to the<br>
principles of the present invention is shown,<br>
revealing an embodiment for hydrogen storage. The<br>
electrolyzer 35 receives energy from the renewable<br>
energy source 15 to provide a source of hydrogen<br>
to reactor 40. The reactor 40 combines hydrogen<br>
and carbon dioxide to form a product 50 for<br>
storage in a tank (not shown) or any suitable<br>
device provided at a storage location 85. A<br>
product conduit 60 may be in communication with<br>
the reactor 40 to transport the product 50 from<br>
the reactor location 90 to the storage location 85<br>
for future use. When an energy demand requires<br>
the product 50 for consumption, a product conduit<br>
65 may be employed to conduct the product 50 to<br>
consumption location 80.<br>
[0046] Once the product 50 is consumed, carbon<br>
dioxide from the consumption location 80 is<br>
conducted to a storage location 87 for storage in<br>
a tank (not shown), or any suitable device,<br>
provided at a storage location 87. Storage<br>
location 87 may also serve as a carbon dioxide<br>
source 30.<br>
[0047] Referring now also to FIG. 8c, a<br>
schematic of an apparatus according to the<br>
principles of the present invention is shown,<br>
revealing an alternative embodiment for carbon<br>
dioxide storage. The electrolyzer 35 receives<br><br>
energy from the renewable energy source 15 to<br>
provide a source of hydrogen to reactor 40. The<br>
reactor 40 combines hydrogen and carbon dioxide to<br>
form a product 50 for storage in a tank (not<br>
shown) or any suitable device provided at a<br>
storage location 85. A product conduit 60 may be<br>
in communication with the reactor 40 to transport<br>
the product 50 from the reactor location 90 to the<br>
storage location 85 for future use. When an<br>
energy demand requires the product 50 for<br>
consumption a product conduit 65 may be employed<br>
to conduct the product 50 to consumption location<br>
80.<br>
[0048] Once the product 50 is consumed, carbon<br>
dioxide from the consumption location 80 may be<br>
conducted back to the reactor 40 or vented or<br>
sequestered, depending on the state of a control<br>
valve 75. Alternatively, carbon dioxide may be<br>
extracted from a carbon dioxide source 30, such as<br>
a coal fired electricity generator, an underground<br>
well or ethanol production facility and directed<br>
by a control valve 75 to a reactor 40 or<br>
sequestered or vented. It should be noted that<br>
any suitable technology know in the art for<br>
storing and extracting carbon dioxide may be<br>
employed in the present invention.<br>
[0049] Accordingly, the present invention<br>
incorporates carbon dioxide as a "hydrogen<br>
carrier", which circulates in the system of the<br>
present invention rather than being released into<br>
the atmosphere. The invention can also allow for<br>
carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere<br><br>
where carbon dioxide capture may be expensive<br>
(such as in a vehicle) and be replaced by carbon<br>
dioxide which can be more easily retained from a<br>
non-consumption location, such as from an ethanol<br>
production facility.<br>
[0050] The present invention can be adapted to<br>
motor vehicles, which would run on the product<br>
formed by the present invention rather than<br>
hydrogen. In order to accomplish this adaptation,<br>
the carbon dioxide from combustion could be<br>
retained during use. Adapting the present<br>
intention to order vehicles could be achieved by<br>
providing a plurality of tanks, where at least one<br>
tank contains the product formed by the present<br>
invention, and at least another for receiving<br>
carbon dioxide.<br>
[0051] Refueling could be accomplished by<br>
evacuating the tank containing C02 and refilling<br>
the evacuated tank with methane. The evacuated C02<br>
would then would be stored or provided to a<br>
reactor for production. The storage and<br>
transportation system of the present invention<br>
solves the problems regarding vehicle fuel cells,<br>
storing liquefied hydrogen, and emissions.<br>
[0052] A vehicle, being a first consumption<br>
location, could also vent carbon dioxide to the<br>
atmosphere, as long as it was replaced with<br>
another source, such as from ethanol production,<br>
being a non-consumption location, or another<br>
consumption location, being a second consumption<br>
location. A vehicle may also be able to partially<br><br>
retain its carbon dioxide produced with the<br>
resulting partial benefit of returning the carbon<br>
dioxide.<br>
[0053] It should be noted that although methane<br>
is referenced in the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention as the product formed by<br>
reacting hydrogen and carbon dioxide, any<br>
hydrocarbon or oxygenated hydrocarbon may be<br>
substituted for methane.<br>
[0054] Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is<br>
believed that more complex hydrocarbons, such as<br>
ethane, propane, and butane may be preferred<br>
products for hydrogen storage as it might be<br>
easier to store complex hydrocarbons more densely<br>
than methane, in the same way methane is stored<br>
more densely than hydrogen.<br>
[0055] Although current infrastructure supports<br>
natural gas for use, the tank storage<br>
infrastructure is fairly advanced for propane,<br>
C3H8. Ethane, C2H6, seems to be more difficult to<br>
store than propane, and more expensive to produce<br>
than methane.<br>
[0056] It is believed that forming octane C8H18<br>
from electrolyzed hydrogen would be cost<br>
prohibitive, but is deemed to be within the scope<br>
of the present invention. Although alcohols are<br>
believed to be inferior to the alkane series, CH4,<br>
C2H6, C3H8, production of oxygenated hydrocarbons,<br><br>
including alcohols, are also deemed to be within<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0057] Ethylene, C2H4, may also be a product<br>
within the scope of the present invention. Since<br>
ethylene has a double carbon bond, it is an<br>
alkene. Either liquefied ethylene or ethane C2H6<br>
can be stored at about 1200 psi at room<br>
temperature, compared with 7500 psi for methane.<br>
Ethylene can also be reformed, using a Sabatier<br>
reactor for example, into ethane or propane which<br>
can be stored at room temperature at 250 psi.<br>
[0058] Carbon dioxide is heavier than methane,<br>
but it liquefies under compression at much lower<br>
pressure. Carbon dioxide needs to be compressed<br>
to about 1000 psi to be retained as a liquid at<br>
room temperature. Methane requires a pressure of<br>
5000-7500 psi at room temperature for high density<br>
storage. Hydrogen cannot be stored as a liquid at<br>
room temperature.<br>
[0059] Although renewable energy sources for<br>
producing hydrogen from water are disclosed<br>
herein, it should be noted that any other source<br>
for hydrogen known in the art may be substituted<br>
for water.<br>
[0060] The foregoing discussion discloses and<br>
describes the preferred structure and control<br>
system for the present invention. However, one<br>
skilled in the art will readily recognize from<br>
such discussion, and from the accompanying<br><br>
drawings and claims, that various changes,<br>
modifications and variations can be made therein<br>
without departing from the true spirit and fair<br>
scope of the invention.<br><br>
