Improved Weatherabilitv of Flame Retardant Polvolefin<br>
The instant invention pertains to a thermoplastic organic polymer, especially a polyolefin such as thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO), stabilized against the deleterious effects of light, oxygen and heat and containing a certain flame retardant, which contains a sterically hindered amine of the hydrocarbyloxyamine or hydroxyhydrocarbyloxyamine class and optionally further stabilizers, to the use of these flame retardants and sterically hindered amines for imparting both light stabilization and flame retardant properties, and to a corresponding process for improving light stability and flame retardancy of a thermoplastic organic polymer.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,393,812 does describe polyolefin compositions which are made flame retardant by addition of a halogenated hydrocarbyl phosphate or phosphonate ester flame retardant, and stabilized against weathering with a alkoxyamine functional hindered amine. EP-A-792911 proposes the use of a alkoxyamine functional hindered amine for improving the flame retardant properties of a polyolefin. The activity of alkoxyamine functional hindered amines alone as a flame retardant is disclosed in WO 99/00450.<br>
There is still need to improve flame retardant polymer compositions in order to obtain good stability against weathering.<br>
Now it has been found that optimum stabilization against UV light and weathering and good flame retardant properties, especially for outdoor applications, can be combined in a thermoplastic polymer, especially a polyolefin, polyolefin copolymer or blend thereof such as impact modified polyolefin or thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO), when certain hindered amine stabilizers are used in combination with a specific flame retardant. Thus, present invention pertains to the use of a combination of a flame retardant selected from<br>
b1) melamin based flame retardants and/or ammonium polyphosphate,<br>
b2) bis-(hexachlorocyclopentadieno) cyclooctane,<br>
b3) tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl)-isocyanurate,<br>
b4) ethylene-bis-tetrabromophthalimide,<br>
b5) 1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromo-cyclo-dodecan,<br>
b6) ethane-1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl);<br>
and<br><br>
c) a sterically hindered amine light stabilizer of the hydrocarbyloxyamine or hydroxyhydrocarbyloxyamine class for imparting both weathering stability and flame retardancy to a thermoplastic polymer (a),<br>
provided that the flame retardant is not (b4) if the sterically hindered amine is of the<br>
hydroxyhydrocarbyloxy class.<br>
Detailed Disclosure<br>
The sterically hindered amine light stabilizer of the hydrocarbyloxyamine or hydroxyhydrocarbyloxyamine class of component (c) is characterized by its substituent E1-o-on the amino nitrogen atom (see formula below), wherein E1 is preferably c1-C18alky!, C5-C12cycloalkyl or C7-C15aralkyl in the sterically hindered amine of the hydrocarbyloxyamine class; and Ei is preferably C1-C18alkyl, C5-C12cycloalkyl or C7-C15aralkyl each of which is substituted in the aliphatic part by 1-3 OH groups in the sterically hindered amine of the hydroxyhydrocarbyloxyamine class. The latter type of compound, containing a reactive OH group, may also be used in the form of its reaction product.<br>
The sterically hindered amine light stabilizer of the hydrocarbyloxyamine or hydroxyhydrocarbyloxyamine class of component c usually is a compound containing a group of the formula <br>
where G1 and G2 are independently alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or are together pentamethylene, and<br>
Ei is C1-C18alkyl, C5-Ci2cycloalkyl or C7-C15aralkyl; or E1 is CrC18alkyl, C5-C12cycloalkyl or C7-C15aralkyl each of which is substituted in the aliphatic part by 1-3 OH groups; or is a reaction product thereof. Preferred is a cyclic sterically hindered amine conforming to the formula<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
G1, G2 and E1 are as defined above;<br>
T is a divalent organic radical required to complete formula I to form, together with<br>
the hindered amine nitrogen atom and the two quaternary carbon atoms<br>
substituted by Gi and G2, a five- or six-membered aliphatic ring structure,<br>
especially a piperidine ring;<br>
or is an oligomeric or polymeric hindered amine molecule made from the reaction<br>
of a dialkyl ester or isocyanate with a compound of the formula (I) wherein E^<br>
contains 1 OH group and T is -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-;<br>
or is a simple diester or urethane derivative of a compound of the formula (I)<br>
wherein Ei contains 1 OH group and T is -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-.<br>
In general, effective stabilizing amounts of a compound of component c used are from 0.01 to 10 %, preferably from 0.05 to 5% by weight, especially from 0.1 to 2 % by weight, based on the polymer component (a), of the stabilizer of component (c).<br>
Sterically hindered amines of present component (c) are largely known as light stabilizers (US-5004770; US-5096950; US-5204473; US-5096950; US-5300544; US-6117995; US-6271377).<br>
Flame retardants of component (b) are commercial compounds. Most preferred is tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl)-isocyanurate (b3).<br>
Halogen-free flame retardants b1 are usually employed in an amount from 1 to about 50 % by weight of the polymer (a), preferably in an amount from 5 to 50 % by weight of the polymer (a). The ratio b1 : c is most preferably in the range from 20 : 1 to 250 : 1.<br>
Halogenated flame retardants b2, b3, b4, b5 and/or b6 are usually employed in a total amount from 0.5 to 40 % by weight of the polymer (a); more preferably 3 to 40%, most preferably 5 to 35% by weight of polymer (a).<br><br>
Most preferred amounts of flame retardants (b) in the compositions of present invention are<br>
for<br>
b1) the melamin based flame retardant and/or ammonium polyphosphate 20 - 50 %;<br>
b2) bis-(hexachlorocyclopentadieno) cyclooctane   5 -20 %;<br>

b5) 1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromo-cyclo-dodecan 2-20 %;<br>
b6) ethane-1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl)    2-20 %;<br>
each amount denotes percent by weight, based on the weight of the polymer (a).<br>
Also of importance in the context of present invention is the use of the flame retardant tris(3-bromo-2,2-(bromomethyl)propyl) phosphate (b7; see below), which is most preferably employed in an amount of 2 - 20, especially 2-10, percent by weight, based on the weight of the polymer (a).<br>
The ratio of halogenated flame retardants b2, b3, b4, b5, b6 or b7 : c is most preferably in the range from 5:1   to 100 : 1.<br>

Component a is frequently selected from the following thermoplastic polymers:<br>
1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene (PP), polyisobutylene, polybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HDPE), high density and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE).<br><br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, preferably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, Vlb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either Π- or σ-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, lla and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br><br>
2.	Mixtures of the polymers mentioned under 1), for example mixtures of polypropylene with polyisobutylene, polypropylene with polyethylene (for example PP/HDPE, PP/LDPE) and mixtures of different types of polyethylene (for example LDPE/HDPE).<br>
3.

copolymers with one another and with polymers mentioned in 1) above, for example polypropylene/ethylene-propyiene copolymers, LDPE/ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), LDPE/ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers (EAA), LLDPE/EVA, LLDPE/EAA and alternating or random polyalkylene/carbon monoxide copolymers and mixtures thereof with otr.er polymers, for example polyamides.<br>
4. Blends of the aforementioned polymers (polyblends), for example PP/EPDM.<br>
In the following, the term polyolefin will be used for pure polyolefin homopolymers as well as copolymers and blends thereof.<br>

Examples of polymer compositions in which the instant compounds are effective include flame retardant polyolefins where acidic residues from the decomposition of the halogenated flame retardants deactivate hindered amines not having the N-OR group, roofing membranes, greenhouse films and agricultural mulch films where acidic residues from pesticides interfere with the activity of "normal" hindered amine stabilizers, and in thermoplastic polyolefins where pigment interactions with basic hindered amine stabilizers interfere with painting the substrate surfaces.<br>

The additives may be added to component (a), individually or mixed with one another. If desired, the individual components can be mixed with one another in the melt (melt blending) before incorporation<br><br>
into the material to be stabilized. Components b and/or c and optional further additives may be incorporated, for example, before or after molding or also by applying the dissolved or dispersed stabilizer mixture to the material to be stabilized, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent. The additives of component b and/or c as well as further ■   additives can also be added to the material to be stabilized in the form of a masterbatch which contains these components in a concentration of, for example, about 2.5 % to about 25 % by weight; in such operations, the polymer can be used in the form of powder, granules, solutions, suspensions or in the form of latices.<br>
Incorporation can take place prior to or during the shaping operation, or by applying the dissolved or dispersed compound to the polymer, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent. In the case of elastomers, these can also be stabilized as latices. A further possibility for incorporating the stabilizers of the invention into polymers is to add them before, during or directly after the polymerization of the corresponding monomers. In the case of addition prior to or during the polymerization, the stabilizers of the invention can also act as a regulator of the chain length of the polymers (chain terminator).<br>
Components b and c of the invention can judiciously be incorporated by the following methods:<br>
as emulsion or dispersion (e.g. to latices or emulsion polymers),<br>
as a dry mixture during the mixing in of additional components<br>
or polymer mixtures,<br>
by direct introduction into the processing apparatus (e.g. extruders, internal<br>
mixers, etc),<br>
as solution or melt.<br>
