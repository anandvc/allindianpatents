				<td>NOVEL CYCLIC PHOSPHATE WESTERS OF 1,3-PROPANE-l-ARYL DIOLS AND THEIR USE IN PREPARING PRODRUGS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/423,259, filed October 31, 2002 and U. S. Provisional Application No. 60/423,211, filed October 31,2002 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed towards certain novel cyclic phosphate diesters of  1-aryl-1,3-propane diols, their preparation and synthetic intermediates, and their use in the synthesis of prodrugs. More specifically, the invention relates to the optionally substituted cyclic phosphate diesters of l-aryl-l,3-propane diols, that have the trans-stereochemistry and their use to synthesize phosphate prodrugs that have the cis-configuration.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following description of the background of the invention is provided to aid in understanding the invention, but is not admitted to be, or to describe, prior art to the invention. All publications are incorporated by reference, in their entirety.<br>
Free phosphorus and phosphonic acids and their salts are highly charged at physiological pH and therefore frequently exhibit poor oral bioavailiability, poor cell penetration and limited tissue distribution (e.g, CNS). In addition, these acids are also commonly associated with several other properties that hinder their use as drugs, including short plasma half-life due to rapid renal clearance, as well as toxicities (e.g. renal, gastrointestinal, etc.) (e.g., Antimicrob Agents Chemother. May; 42(5): 1146-50 (1998)). Phosphates have an additional limitation in that they are not stable in plasma as well as most tissues since they undergo rapid hydrolysis via the action of phosphatases (e.g. alkaline phosphatase, nucleotidases). Accordingly, phosphate esters are frequently<br>
used as a prodrug strategy, especially for water-insoluble compounds, since the<br>
phosphate group enables high water solubility and thereby enables delivery of the drug<br>
parenterally.<br>
Liver cancer is poorly treated with current therapies. In general, liver tumors are<br>
resistant to radiotherapy, respond poorly to chemotherapy and are characterized by a<br>
high degree of cell heterogeneity.<br>
Hepatitis and liver cancer remain poorly treated with current therapies due to dose-limiting extrahepatic side effects or inadequate delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the target tissue.<br>
Many nucleosides have been used as oncolytics or antiviral agents. Frequently, these compounds are reported to exhibit low activity due to either poor substrate activity of the corresponding nucleoside with viral kinases or because the viral nucleoside kinase which is required to convert the nucleoside to the monophosphate is down regulated viral resistance. Monophosphates, however, are difficult to deliver to virally-infected cells after oral administration due to their high charge and in the case of the monophosphate instability in plasma. In addition, these compounds often have short half-lives due in most cases to high renal clearance. In some cases, the high renal clearance can lead to nephrotoxicities or be a major limitation in diseases such as diabetes where renal function is often compromised.<br>
Limitations in approaches described above include drug loading capacity, complexity of the manufacture and characterization of the conjugate, and receptor down regulation. Thus, there is still a need for prodrugs of phosphorus containing drugs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed towards certain novel cyclic phosphate diesters of l-aryl-l,3-propane diols, having the trans-stereochemistry, their preparation and synthetic intermediates, and their use in the synthesis of prodrugs.<br>

Compounds of Formula I are either racemic, have the S configuration or the R configuration at carbon C'.

Synthesis of phosphorylating agents n.l     Synthesis of l-(aryIJ-Propane-l53-DioIs:<br>
A variety of synthetic methods are- known to prepare' 1,3-dioIs. These suitable methods are divided into two types as following: 1) synthesis of racemic l-(aryl)-propane-l,3-diol; 2) synthesis of enantioemiched l-(aryl)-propane-l,3-diol. H.1.1  Synthesis of Racemic 1-(aryI)-Propane-l,3-DioI:<br>
1,3-Dihydroxy compounds can be synthesized by several well known methods from the literature. Substituted aromatic aldehydes are utilized to synthesize racemic 1-<br>
(aiyl)propane-l,3-diol via addition of lithium enolate of alkyl acetate followed by ester reduction (path A) (Turner, /. Org. CJiem. 55:4744 (1990)). Alternatively, aryl Grignard additions to l-hydroxypropan-3-alalso give l-(arylsubstitated)propane-l,3-diols'(path B). This method will enable conversion of various substituted aryl halides to 1-(arylsubstituted)-1,3-propane diols (Coppi, etal.,J. Org. Chem. 53:911 (1988)). Aryl halides can also be used to synthesize 1-substituted propane diols by Heck coupling of 1,3-diox-4-ene followed by reduction and hydrolysis (Sakamoto, et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 33:6845 (1992)). Pyridyl, quinoline, isoquinoline propan-3-ol derivatives can be oxygenated to l-substituted-l,3-diols by N-oxide formation followed by rearrangement in acetic anhydride conditions' (path C) (Yamamoto, et al, Tetrahedron 37:1871 (1981)). A variety of aromatic aldehydes can also be converted to 1-substituted-1,3-diols by vinyl Grignard addition followed by hydroboration reaction (path D).<br>

V  Aryl, R = Alkyl, R' = benzyl, M=Mg or Li, X=Halide or null n.1.2  Synthesis of Enantipenriched l-(aryl)-Propane-l,3-DioI:<br>
A variety of known methods for separation of secondary alcohols via chemical or enzymatic agents may be utilized for preparation of diol enantiomers (Harada, et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 28:4843 (1987)). Transition metal catalyzed hydiogenation of substituted 3-aryl-3-oxo propionic acids or esters is an efficient method to prepare R or S-isomers of beta hydroxy acids or esters in high enantiomeric purity (Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis, Jacobsen, E. N., Pfaltz, A., Yamamoto, H. (Eds), Springer, (1999); Asymmetric Catalysis ?n organic Synthesis, Noyori, R., John Wiley, (1994)).<br>
. " -i<br>
These beta hydroxy acid or ester products can be further reduced to give required 1-(aryl)-propane-1,3-diols in high ee. (path A). The p-keto acid or ester substrates for high pressure hydrogenation or hydrogen transfer reactions may be prepared by a variety of methods such as condensation of acetophenone with dimethylcarbonate in the presence of a base (dm, et al., J. Het Chem. 22:1033 (1985)), by ester condensation (Turner, et<br>
al., J. Org. Chem. 54:4229 (1989)) or from aryl halides (Kobayasbi, et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 27:4745 (1986)). Alternatively, 1,3-diols of high enantiomeric purity can be obtained by enantioselective borane reduction of p-hydroxyethyl aryl ketone derivatives or p-keto acid derivatives (path B) (Ramachandran, et al., Tetrahedron Lett, 38:761 (1997)). In another method, commercially available cinnamyl alcohols may be converted to epoxy alcohols under catalytic asymmetric epoxidation conditions. These epoxy alcohols are reduced by Red-Al to result in 1,3-diols with high ee's (path C) (Gao, etal.,J. Org. Chem. 53:4081 (1980)). Enantioselective aldol condensation is another ' well described method for'synthesis of 1,3-oxygenated functionality with high ee's starting from aromatic aldehydes, (path D) (Mukaiyama, Org. React. 28:203 (1982)).<br>

Synthesis of phosphorylating reagent<br>
The general synthesis of the phosphorylating reagent is accomplished by reacting 1 -aryl-3 -propane diols with phosphorodichloridate of formula Cl2P(O)-L. Phosphorodichloridate where L is aryloxy are synthesized by reacting substituted-phenols with phosphorusoxychloride (Rathore etal., Indian J. Chem B 32(10), 1066(1993)).<br>
The enantioenriched activated phosphorylating agent is synthesized by phosphorylation of an enantioenriched l-(V)-.l,3-propane diol with phosphorodichloridates of formula L-P(O)Cl2 in the presence of a base (Ferroni et al, J. Org. Chem. 64(13), 4943 (1999)). In one aspect, orders of addition include the addition of a solution of the diol and the base to a solution of the phosphorodichloridate in the chosen solvent In another aspect, a solution of the diol and the base, and another solution containing the phosphorodichloridate in the same solvent or a different solvent,<br>
are added simultaneously to a chosen solvent In another aspect, a solution of the diol is added to a solution of the phosphorus reagent followed by the addition of the base. Typical solvents for the phosphorylation of the diol are polar aprotic solvents that have low reactivity with phosphorodichloridates and solubilize the diol or the phosphorodichloridate. In one aspect, solvents to run the phosphorylation reaction are dichloromethane, THF, acetonitrile, pyridine, .tetraalkylureas, trialkyl phosphates or hexaalkylphosphoramides. In another aspect, the solvents are dichloromethane, THF, acetonitrile, pyridine, DMPU, DMEU, tetramethyl urea, trimethyl phosphate, hexamethylphosphoramide. The reaction temperature is kept low, especially during the initial phase of the reactionj.which is exothermic, so as to preserve the integrity of tie reagents.<br>
In one aspect, temperatures are below room temperature within - 20 °C to 10 °C. In one aspect, the exothenn is under control, the reaction temperature is brought slowly to room temperature to complete the formation of the phosphate reagent. In another aspect, the temperature is kept the same until completion of the reaction to preserve the integrity of the reagent. Due to the stereogenic nature of the phosphorus atom, reaction of the phosphorodichloridate with the diol under the reaction conditions described above gives a mixture of cis and trans isomers, slightly favoring the ciy-isomer. Typical cisltrans ratios range from 50/50 to 60/40. The cis and trans isomers are separated by a combination of column chromatography and/or crystallization.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, we found that when the isolated ciy-isomer of the 4-nitrophenoxy phosphorylating agent was heated with, a salt of 4-nitrophenol, &gt;85% of the phosphorylating reagent isolated was the /7-<my-isomer. in another aspect of this invention we found that when the isolated mixture cis and trans isomers phosphorylating reagent was heated with a salt same solvent used for phosphorylation step or>85% of the phosphorylating reagent isolated was the #-
reacting the corresponding phenol with a base, preferably trialkylaraines, nitrogen-containing heterocycles or sodium. In one aspect, bases are triethylamirie, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, DABCO, DBU, sodium hydride or an alkali metal. In another aspect, bases are triethylamine, DBU or the sodium salt of the phenoxide. The enrichment step can be run at room temperature but is generally heated to decrease reaction times, preferably in the range of 40 °C to 70 °C. While the conversion of the aryloxy phosphorylating reagent requires the addition of the salt of the corresponding phenoxide, the conversion of phosphprochloridates of the enantioenriched diol do not necessitate the additional use of soluble chloride salts as the formation of the<br>
••* ••<br>
phosphorochloridate itself with the preferred bases generates two'equivalents of chloride ion. In one aspect, upon completion of the phosphorylation of the diol, the reaction mixture is then heated, preferably in the range of 40 °C to 70 °C, to completely convert the cis'isomer into the trans isomer. In another aspect the temperature is kept the same as the one used for the addition of the reagents.<br>
For the preparation of enantioenriched phosphorylating reagents from enantioenriched diols, preservation of the cm'rality at carbon C' in compounds of Formula I is critical. While for most enantioenriched diols epimerization of carbon C' was minimal, decrease in ee was observed with a few diols using the previously described reaction conditions. Especially troublesome were l-(A^-containing-heteroaiyl)-1,3-propane diols where the initial ee of 98% for the dioi was reduced to 
••;•••"<br>
prior to addition of the phosphorodichloridate orphesphorusoxychloride and subsequent addition of the base helped prevent epimerization of the C' carbon without requiring the use of a ^-containing heteroaryl solvents. In one aspect, salts of l-(A^-contaimng-heteroaryl)-1,3-propane diol are salts made by reacting l-(JV-containing-heteroaryl)-l,3-propane diol with an organic or mineral acid with a pka 
chromatography and/or crystallization. However, it was found that after running the enrichment step, the isolation of the trans-isomet was greatly simplified yielding pbosphorylating reagent of great purity, &gt;95% trans-isam&amp;i and ee &gt;95%. In one aspect the trans-phosphorylating reagent is isolated. In another aspect, the phsophorylating reagent is kept in solution and used for the phosphorylation of nucleosides without purification. The relative configuration of the phosphorus atom is determined hy comparison of the 31P NMR spectra. The chemical shift of the equatorial phosphoryloxy moiety ( frvmy-isomer) is more upfield than the one of the axial isomer (cis-isomer) (Verkade, et al, J. Qrg. Chan. 42, 1 549 (1 977)). HI.     Use of the phosphorylating agents to prepare prodrugs<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
The invention is also directed towards the use of the phosphorylating agents of Formula I for the synthesis of compounds of Formula Et that are efficiently converted to the corresponding phosphate-containing compounds by P450 enzymes found in large amounts in the liver and other tissues containing these specific enzymes. As such the present invention is extremely useful in synthesizing ci?-prodrugs of compounds effective in treating liver diseases or diseases where the liver is responsible for the overproduction of the biochemical end product such as glucose, cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglyeerides. Such diseases include viral and parasitic infections, liver cancer, liver fibrosis, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. In addition, the liver specificity of the prodrugs should also prove useful in the delivery of diagnostic agents to the liver.<br>
Li one aspect, the invention is directed towards the use of the phosphorylating agent for the synthesis of ciy-prodrugs of the monophosphate of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs. Although the nucleoside or nucleoside analog can be attached to the phosphorus atom of the prodrug moiety through an oxygen, a nitrogen or a sulfur atom, in another aspect, the compound is attached to the phosphorus through an oxygen atom. hi one aspect, the nucleoside or nucleoside analog is attached to the phosphorus atom of<br>
the prodrug moiety through a primary hydroxyl group. In another aspect, the prodrug moiety is attached to the 5'-hydroxyl of nucleoside or nucleoside analog.<br>

For the synthesis of cw-prodrugs of Formula n, the prodrug moiety can be introduced at different stages of the synthesis. Most often the cyclic phosphates are introduced at a later stage, because of the general sensitivity of these groups to various reaction conditions. The synthesis can also proceed through using a protected or unprotected nucleoside or nucleoside analog depending on the reactivity of the functional groups present in the compound. Single stereoisomers of the cw-prodrugs can either be made by separation of the dias^ereoisomers/enantiopers by a combination of column chromatography and/or crystallization, or by enantiospecific synthesis using enantioenriched activated phosphate intermediates.<br>
The general procedure for the phosphorylation of protected nucleosides is accomplished by reacting a suitably protected nucleoside with a base and reacting the aQcoxide generated with the phosphorylating reagent. The protected nucleoside can be prepared by one skilled in the art using one of the many procedures described for the<br>
protection of nucleosides (Greene T.W., Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1999)). The nucleoside is protected in such a way as to expose the hydroxyl group oa which to add the phosphate group while protecting all the remaining hydroxyls and other functional groups on the nucleoside that may interfere with the phosphorylation step or lead to regioisomers. In one aspect, the protecting groups selected are resistant to strong bases, e.g., ethers, sily] ethers and ketals. In one aspect, the protecting groups are optionally substituted MOM ethers, MEM ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers and symmetrical ketals. In another aspect, the protecting groups are /-butyldimethylsilyl ether and isopropylidene. Further protection entails masking of the amino group of the base moiety, if present, so as to eliminate any acidic protons. In. one aspect the selected jV-protecting groups are selected from the groups of dialfcyl formamidines, mono and dialkyl imines, mono and diaryl imines. In one aspect, the N-protecting groups are selected from the groups of dialkyl formamidines and mono-alkyl imine and mono aryl imine. In one aspect the mono-alkyl imine is benzylimme and the mono-aryl imine is phenylimine. In another aspect, the Ar-protecting group is a symmetrical dialkyl formamidine selected from the group of dimethyl formamidine and diethyl formamidine.<br>
Generation of the alkoxide of the exposed hydroxyl group on the suitably protected nucleoside is accomplished with a base in an aptotic solvent that is not base sensitive such as THF, dialkyl and cylic formamides, ether, toluene and mixtures of those solvents. In one aspect, the solvents are DMF, DMA, DBF, ?/-methylpyrrolidine, THF, and mixture of those solvents.<br>
Many different bases have been used for the phosphorylation of nucleosides and non-nucleoside compounds with cyclic and acyclic phosphorylating agents. For example trialkylamines such as triethylamine (Roodsari et al, J. Org. Chem. 64(21), 7727 (1999)) or diisopropylethylamine (Meekef al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110(7), 2317 (1988)); nitrogen containing heterocyclic amines such as pyridine (Hoefler et al., Tetrahedron 56(11), 1485 (2000)), JVHtnethylimidazole (Vankayalapati ei.al,J..Chem. Soc. PerkTl 14, 2187(2000)), 1,2,4-triazole (Takaku eta!.,'Chem. Lett. (5), 699 (1986)) orimidazole (Dyatkina et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 35(13), 1961 (1994)); organometallic bases such as potassium £-butoxide (Postel etal., J. Carbohyd. Chem. 19(2), 171 (2000)), butyllithium (Torneiro etal., J. Org. Chem. 62(18), 6344 (1977)), jf-butylmagnesium chloride (Hayakawa et al, Tefrahedron Lett. 28(20), 2259 (1987)) or LDA (Aleksiuk et al, J. Chem, Soc. Chem. Comm. (1), 11 (1993)); inorganic bases such as cesium fluoride<br>
(Takaku et al, Nippon Kagaku Kaishi (10), 1968 (1985)), sodium hydride (Hanaoka et al., Heterocydes -23(11), 2927 (1985)), sodium iodide (Stromberg et al., J, Nucleos. Nucleot. 6(5), 815 (1987)), iodine (Stromberg et al, J. Nucleos. Nucleot. 6(5), 815 (1987)) or sodium hydroxide (Attanasi et al, Phosphorus Sulfur 35(1-2), 63 (1988)); metal such as copper (Bhatia et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 28(3), 271 (1987)). However, no reaction or racemization at the phosphorus stereogenic center was observed when coupling of phosphorylating reagent of Formula I was attempted using the previously described procedures. Especially, no reaction was observed with bases previously used with substituted cyclic phosphorylating agent to give the corresponding cyclic phosphate in high yield such as sodium hydride (TTiuong et.a.1, Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 667 (1974)), pyridine (Ayral-Kaloustian et al., Carbohydr. Res. 187(1991)), butyl-lithium (Hulst et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 1339 (1993)), DBU (Merckling et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 2217 (1996)), triethylamine (Hadvary et al, Helv. Chim. Acta, 1986, 69(8), 1862), N- ' inethylimidazole (Li et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 6615 (2001)) or sodium methoxide (Gorenstein et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 5077 (1980)). In one aspect of this invention, it was found that the use of Grignard reagents promoted phosphorylation with minimal epimerization of the phosphorus center. In one aspect, Grignard reagents are alkyl and aryl Grignards. In another aspect, the Grignard reagents are ?-butyl magnesium halides and phenyl magnesium halides. In another aspect, the Grignard reagents are t-butylmagnesium chloride and phenylmagnesium chloride.<br>
In another aspect of the invention magnesium alkoxides are used to generate the magnesium 5'-alkoxide of the nucleoside. In one aspect magnesium alkoxides are selected from the group of Mg(O-£-Bu)2, and MgfO-iPrfe.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, Lewis acids can be added to the solution of the alkoxide, made with one of the bases previously described, to either1 exchange the carbocation of the alkoxide and/or modulate the reactivity of the formed alkoxide with the phosphorylating agent. Examples of Lewis acids include alkali salts, rare earth salts or transition metal salts. In 'one aspect, Lewis acids are magnesium salts, calcium salts, cesium salts, aluminum salts or cerium salts. In another aspect, Lewis acids are magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide and magnesium iodide.<br>
In one aspect, the reaction conditions for the synthesis of compounds of Formula n encompass first the generation of the alkoxide with a Grignard reagent or, one of the other bases followed by addition of magnesium salts, second the addition of the phosphorylating reagent of Formula I to the solution of the nucleoside, either in solution,<br>
generally in the same solvent but not necessarily, or directly as a solid. In another aspect, the solution of the alkoxide is added to the solution of the phosphorylating reagent. In one aspect, temperatures for the generation of the alkoxide with a base are chosen from the range of -78 °C to 40 °C. In one aspect, the temperatures are chosen from the range of—20 °C to 25 °C. In another aspect, temperatures for the phosphorylation step are chosen from the range of-10 °C to 70 °C. In another aspect, the temperatures are chosen from the range of 10 °C to 40 °C.<br>
The protected prodrugs generated as described above are then subjected to a deprotection step to remove all the protecting groups using one of the many methods known to those skilled in the art (Greene T.W., Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1999)) and that are compatible with the stability of the phosphate prodrug. Iij one aspect, deprotection reagents include fluoride salts to remove silyl protecting groups, mineral or organic acids to remove aeid labile protecting groups such as silyl and/or ketals and //-protecting groups, if present. In another aspect, reagents are TBAF, hydrochloric acid solutions and aqueous TFA solutions. Isolation and purification of the final prodrugs, as well as all intermediates, is accomplished by a combination of column chromatography and/or crystallization.<br>
One aspect of the present invention provides methods to synthesize single isomers of compounds of Formula E. Due to the presence of a stereogenic center at the carbon where V is attached on the cyclic phosphate reagent, this carbon atom can have two distinct orientations, namely R or S. As such the fraraj-phosphate reagent can exist as either the S-trans or R-trans configuration and these two reagents are enantiomers. Therefore, an equal mixture of the R-trans and S-trans is a racemic mixture. In addition, because most nucleosides are chiral, phosphorylation of these nucleosides with a racemic itraTw-phosphate reagent will generate a mixture of two diastereomeric cis-prodrugs while phosphorylation of an achiral nucleoside analog (e.g., ACV) will generate a racemic mixture of cw-prodrugs. These compounds can be separated by a combination of column chromatography and/or crystallization. Alternatively, phosphorylation of the alkoxide of the nucleoside with an enantioemiched tamy-phosphate reagent generates an enantioenriched ciy-prodrug. As such reaction of the C'-S-trans-phospbate reagent generates the C'-S-cf-y-prodrug of the nucleoside while reaction with the C'-R-trajis-phosphate reagent generates the C'-^-czJ-prodrug.<br>
In another aspect, depending on the rate of epimerization of the cis-phosphate reagent to the trans-phosphate reagent compared to the rate of reaction of the nucleoside<br>
with the trans-phosphate reagent, it was discovered that a cis-phosphorylating reagent still gives the cis-prodrug of a nucleoside. In that aspect, the cis-phosphorylating reagent epimerizes to the trans-phosphate reagent with the traces of the leaving group generated by the formation of small amounts of the prodrug. The nucleoside then reacts with the trans-phosphate reagent being generated in-situ giving the cis-prodrug. In another aspect, the nucleoside is reacted with a crude mixture of phosphorylating reagent to generate the cis-prodrug. In one aspect, the crude mixture of the phosphorylating reagent has been enriched in the trans-isomer. In another aspect the phosphorylating reagent is used without the enrichment step. UI.2    Phosphorylation of unprotected nucleosides<br>
Alternatively, the prodrug of the nucleoside can be synthesized without prior protection of the nucleoside using reaction conditions that selectively phosphorylate primary hydroxyl groups. Selective 5 ?-acylation. of nucleosides such as araC with acyl chlorides is well established (Gish et al, J. Med. Chem. 14,1159 (1971)). However, because phosphorylating agents are considered to be more reactive, they presumably would give rise to less regioselectivity and lower yields, as well as reaction with the solvent used in the reaction (DMF). In one aspect of the invention, we found that reaction of a phosphorylating agent of Formula I with an unprotected nucleoside generated the 5 '-cz's-phosphate prodrug of the nucleoside in high yield, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. In one aspect the isolated phosphorylating is added to a solution of the nucleoside. In another aspect the nucleoside is. added to a solution of the phosphorylating reagent. Due to the poor solubility of unprotected nucleosides in common solvents and the potential reactivity of the solvent with the phosphorylating reagent, solvents with strong dielectric constants that have low reactivity with the phosphorylating reagent are necessary. Examples of such solvents are tetraalkylureas, trialkyl phosphates, or hexaalkylphosphoramides. In one aspect, the solvents are DMPU, tetramethyl urea, DMEU, trimethyl phosphate or hexamethylphosphoramide. Temperatures for the prodrug.:fprmation range from -20 °C to 40 °C depending on the stability of the reagents. In one aspect, the temperature for the phosphorylation of the nucleoside is kept between -10 °C and 10 °C. In another aspect the temperature is kept between 0 °C and room temperature.<br>
