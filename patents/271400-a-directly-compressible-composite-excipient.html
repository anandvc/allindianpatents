TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Orally Disintegrating Tablets<br><br><br>
APPLICANTS<br>
Rubicon Research Private Limited, an Indian Company<br>
having its registered office at 221, Annexe Building,<br>
Goregaon-Mulund Link Road, Opposite Indira Container Yard,<br>
Off L.B.S Marg, Bhandup (W), Mumbai 400 078, Maharashtra, India<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/113856	PCT/IN2OO7/O0O138<br>
ORALLY DISINTEGRATING TABLETS<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention provides a tablet with optimal mechanical strength, which when placed in the oral cavity rapidly dissolves or disintegrates without water preferably within about 60 seconds. 5<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to composites produced by co-processing of at least one water-soluble excipient and at least one water insoluble excipient such as calcium silicate and their use in orally disintegrating tablets.<br>
10     Background and prior art<br>
Design of an orally disintegrating tablet requires a significant amount of research work in order to develop a process that maintains enough porosity inside the compressed tablets for fast dissolving or fast melting while maintaining the mechanical strength of the tablet Orally disintegrating dosage forms are known in the art and some of the most commonly 15 used techniques arc incorporated herein by reference. Current technologies involved in many patents as well as existing commercial fast-dissolving tablets utilize complicated processing techniques such as freeze-drying, molding and sublimation or use of specialized excipients such as effervescent couple, highly micronized agents or the likes.<br>
20 Freeze drying is one common process for producing many commercial fast dissolving tablets wherein a cake or wafer is prepared by freeze drying a solution or suspension of the medicament and suitable excipients in water or other solvents. Such systems dissolve very rapidly on the tongue, due to their high affinity for moisture and a very high porosity. U.S. Patent 5298261 discloses freeze- drying a slurry or paste comprising an<br>
25 active ingredient and excipients placed in blister packets. PCT application WO 97/36879 discloses vacuum drying, at room temperature or a slightly elevated temperature, a suspension including the active drug, a sugar alcohol, PEG 6000, talc, sweeteners and flavors in preformed blisters. However, the freeze-drying process suffers from several disadvantages, primary among these is that solutions employed for freeze-drying are<br>
30 aqueous and, therefore, not suited for water sensitive medicaments. It is also limited to low dose actives. The process itself is typically laborious, costly and time-consuming. Finally, the resultant dosage forms, in addition to being hygroscopic, tend to be very soft<br><br>
WO 2007/113856	PCT/1N 200 7/000138<br>
2<br>
and, therefore, require special moisture-and impact-resistant packaging and require careful handling.<br>
US Patent 5464632 claims use of high levels of disintegrants such as 16% starch 1500 5     and 13.3 % crospovidone for disintegration time of 35 seconds to 45 seconds. However, such tablets have a chalky or dry feel when placed in the mouth.<br>
US Patent 5178878 discloses a rapidly dissolving oral formulation that requires an extragranular   microparticulate   active   in   conjunction   with   an   effervescent   agent<br>
10 incorporated into a tableted matrix in order to achieve rapid oral disintegration. Many fast-dissolving tablets are also formulated by the inclusion of effervescent compounds. US Patent 5178878 and WO 91/04757 disclose the addition of an effervescent couple (such as sodium bicarbonate and citric acid) to a tablet. Exposure of such tablet to moisture results in contact and chemical reaction between the effervescent couple which<br>
15 leads to gas production and tablet disintegration. However, tablets which include effervescent pairs are highly sensitive to moisture and require a specific, very costly plant including special handling equipment, controlled-humidity environments and special moisture resistant packaging and also such preparations have an unpleasant mouth feel.<br>
20 Another orally disintegrating technique is spray drying technology as explained in US patent 5958471 and 6165511, which includes preparing an aqueous solution of more than 80% of one or more non-hygroscopic polyols and spraying the resulting mixture into an air stream. The resulting composition of the spray-drying process contains a filamentous structure. Similarly PCT application WO03051338A1 relates to a method for producing a<br>
25 directly compressible and highly compactible composition by co-spray drying of mannitol and sorbitol solution resulting in nonfilamentous micro structure. Both these patents describe use of highly concentrated aqueous solutions, which are to be maintained and sprayed at high temperature thus demanding special equipment.<br>
30 Another approach to develop orally disintegrating dosage form involves optimal selection of excipients which would result in desired disintegration time. These are typically compressed dosage forms. EP 1145711 describes the preparation of flash-melt dosage<br><br>
WO 2007/113856<br><br>
PCT/IN2007/000138<br><br>
3<br>
forms that disintegrated in the mouth in less than 25 second. They consist of granules composed of a superdisintegrant (4-8%), a dispersing agent such as calcium silicate (20-70%), a distributing agent selected from amorphous silica, fumed silica, diatomaceous earth, talc, kaolin, magnesium aluminum trisilicate, and a binder (10 to 50% by weight). 5 A larger amount of binder although may produce stronger tablets, the disintegration time tend to increase. To counter this, a large amount of dispersing and distributing agent is included in the formulation which increases the weight of the tablet and also the cost of the formulation may increase.<br>
10 PCT application WO03045844A1 relates to synthetic calcium metasilicate which when incorporated in a solid product significantly increases the disintegration rate of the formed product, when contacted by a substantially aqueous environment. The reduction in disintegration time with calcium silicate is more pronounced with immediate release tablets as tablets prepared with calcium silicate has low porosity leading to increased<br>
15 disintegration time in oral cavity. However use of calcium silicate with conventional equipments leads to discoloration of the final dosage form due to interaction of calcium silicate with some metals. Calcium silicate due to its hydrophobic and static nature results in blends with very poor flow properties causing weight and content variation during compression into tablets. Further, it also imparts a chalky taste to the dosage form.<br>
20<br>
In general, there are numerous other examples of specific formulations that utilize one or more of the techniques or mechanisms discussed above. Majority of these techniques possess one or more of the above enumerated disadvantages to some extent such as tedious   and   complex   method   of manufacturing,   special   packaging   and   storage<br>
25 requirements, high cost, limitation on drug load etc. Thus, there continues to be a need for a formulation that mitigates or eliminates these disadvantages. The desired features of such dosage form include quick disintegrability in an oral cavity, a pleasant mouth feel and optimal mechanical strength even in storage under a humidifying conditions.<br>
30 It was surprisingly found that composites made by co-processing of at least one water soluble excipient and at least one water insoluble excipient such as calcium silicate, leads to a formulation that rapidly disintegrates or dissolves on in the mouth. Tablets made with<br><br>

these excipients are robust (e.g., low friability, low ejection forces, hardness) enough to be processed in high speed tableting machines and shipped in low cost packages, and at the same time retain rapid disintegration or dissolution properties. The tablets have a pleasant mouth feel and good mechanical strength and such tablets also do not require 5      special handling or packaging conditions.<br>

Detailed description:<br>
Solid pharmaceutical dosage forms that rapidly dissolve or disintegrate in a glass of water or in the gastrointestinal tract have been known in the art for many years. The obvious<br>
20 advantages of the convenience of carrying dosage forms that will dissolve or effervesce in water to release medicaments are well known. Rapid disintegration technology is among the most exciting recent developments in the pharmaceutical industry. Orally Disintegrating Tablets are tablets that disintegrate/dissolve in the mouth rapidly without administering extra water. These dosage forms provide the convenience of a tablet<br>
25 formulation while allowing the ease of swallowing provided by a liquid formulation. Such dosage forms due to their ease of administration and pleasant mouth feel, may encourage patients especially children, the elderly and schizophrenic patients who have difficulty in swallowing conventional tablets to adhere to daily medication regimens and also allow the luxury of much more accurate dosing than oral liquids. Yet another situation where<br>
30 such tablets would be useful is where water may not be readily available to assist in swallowing the tablet in specific conditions.<br><br>

The term 'Co-processed excipient* as used here refers to an excipient composite in which at least two excipients are present in close proximity to each other. In one of the embodiments such excipient composite may have one excipient incorporated in the particle structure of the other. 5<br>
The term 'porosity' as used here is a measure of void spaces within the material and is measured as a fraction (between 0 to 1) or as a percentage value (between 0 to 100%). Porosity is the ratio of void space to bulk volume. It can be determined using the following formula: Porosity = (Bulk volume - True volume) / Bulk volume 10<br>
The term 'wicking time' as used here provides time (seconds) taken for water to wick into the tablet and completely wet the tablet core. The wicking time test is used to evaluate the performance of orally disintegrating tablets. The wicking time determination is carried out in a petri plate (~ 10 cm in diameter). The plate is layered with tissue papers of- 0.25 15 mm thick. The tissue paper is wetted with 10 ml water (preferably colored using a water soluble dye) and allowed to soak for 30 sec. A tablet is then placed on the wetted tissue paper and the time taken by water to reach the surface of tablet and completely wet it is recorded as the 'wicking time'. The test may be appropriately modified for tablets having weight of more than 200 mg. 20<br>
The term 'mouth dissolution time' as used here provides time (seconds) taken for tablet to completely dissolve in the mouth determined in and by human volunteers.<br>
The term 'lag time' as used here provides time (seconds) taken for tablet to soften and 25      start disintegrating after being placed on the tongue determined in and by human volunteers.<br>
The term 'in vitro disintegration time' as used here refer to the time taken for complete disintegration of the tablet as determined using the USP disintegration apparatus. 30<br><br>

Composites<br>
Composites are blend of excipients obtained by co-processing of at least one water<br>
soluble excipient and at least one water insoluble excipient.<br>
5     The water soluble excipients according to the embodiments of the  invention are<br>
excipients that are soluble in water. The preferred examples include water soluble<br>
carbohydrates,  salt or  a polyhydric  alcohol  or its  derivative.  The  water  soluble<br>
carbohydrates can be a monosaccharide, disaccharide, oligosaccharide or polysaccharide.<br>
Examples include but not limited to monosaccharides such as glyceraldehyde, erythrose,<br>
10     threose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, fructose, gulose,<br>
idose, galactose, talose and sorbitol; disaccharides such as maltose, lactose, cellobiose,<br>
sucrose, mannitol and trehalose; oligosaccharides such as raffinose, stachyose, and<br>
dextrates; or polysaccharides such as maltodextrins, starch, glycogen, cellulose, chitin,<br>
callose, galactomannan, xylan and laminarin   The saccharide is preferably at least one<br>
15     selected from mannitol, lactose, saccharose, trehalose, xylitol and erythritol. Preferably,<br>
the saccharide is mannitol. These water soluble excipients can be employed alone or in<br>
combination. The water soluble excipients also include but are not limited to polyhydric<br>
alcohols like propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerin or their derivatives, salts<br>
such as sodium chloride or water soluble cellulose derivatives.<br>
20<br>
The water insoluble excipients according to the embodiments of the invention are excipients that are not soluble in water, These excipients include but are not limited to inorganic salts such as calcium silicate-ortho, meta and alpha tricJinic forms thereof, magnesium trisilicate-ortho and meta forms thereof or light anhydrous silicic acid, mica, 25 synthetic aluminum silicate, silicon dioxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, magnesium metasilicate aluminate, celluloses such as microcrystalline cellulose, crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, vinylpyrolidone derivatives, colloidal silicon dioxide etc. The preferred water insoluble agent is calcium metasilicate. The most preferred water insoluble agent is calcium silicate marketed by Huber as Rxcipient FM1000 having an 30 aspect ratio of about 1:1 to about 2.5:1 and an oil absorption of from about 20 ml/lOOgm to 220 ml/100 gm. It is a unique physical form of Calcium Silicate, which reduces the disintegration time of a dosage form.<br><br>
WO 2007/113856<br><br>
PCT/IN2007/000138<br><br>
8<br>
These water soluble and insoluble excipients may be present in the composites in the ratio of 1:50 to 50:1. Preferably the ratio can be 1:30 to 30:1 and more preferably 1:20 to 20:1.<br>
Any process that ensures close proximity of water insoluble excipient and water soluble excipient can be employed. Such process would ensure intimate contact of water insoluble excipients and water soluble excipients. Some of the preferred processes ensure complete or partial covering of the water insoluble excipient by water soluble excipient can be employed for the preparation of the composites. The non-limiting processes may include physical mixing, wet mixing, complexation, precipitation, spray drying, lyophilization, microencapsulation, spray congealing, hot melt, gas antisolvent or rapid evaporation of supercritical solvent methods employed with supercritical fluid processing. The preferred method for preparing composites is spray drying.<br>
Spray drying is an industrial process involving particle formation and drying. It is highly suited for the continuous production of dry solids in either powder, granulate or agglomerate form from liquid feedstocks as solutions, emulsions and pumpable suspensions. Therefore, spray drying is an ideal process where the end-product must comply with precise quality standards regarding particle size distribution, residual moisture content, bulk density, and particle shape. Spray drying involves the atomization of a liquid feedstock into a spray of droplets and contacting the droplets with hot air in a drying chamber. The sprays are produces by either rotary (wheel) or nozzle atomizers. Evaporation of moisture from the droplets and formation of dry particles proceed under controlled temperature and airflow conditions. Powder is discharged continuously from the drying chamber. Operating conditions and dryer design are selected according to the drying characteristics of the product and powder specification.<br>
There are a number of variables in the spray drying process which include feed composition, feed viscosity, density, feed spray rate, inlet temperature, outlet temperature, temperature difference, atomization pressure, vacuum, residence time. All these parameters can be varied in order to achieve the desired product.<br><br>
WO 2007/113856<br><br>
PCT/IN2007/000138<br><br>
9<br>
The process employed comprise of preparation of the slurry of water-soluble and water insoluble excipient which was homogenized using overhead stirrer, homogenizer etc. The feed can be preheated during stirring before being fed to the spray drying chamber. For spraying this dispersion a single fluid nozzle or a two-fluid nozzle can be employed. 5 Alternatively the feed may also be sprayed using a rotating disk. The drying of the particles could be achieved using any of the methods such as co-current flow, counter current flow or mixed flow. The total solid content of the feed could vary from about 2-75%, preferably from 5-60% and more preferably from 10-50%.<br>
10 The composites of at least one water soluble excipient and at least one water insoluble excipient such as calcium silicate may have certain desirable properties. The moisture content of the composite as determined using loss on drying is preferably less than 2%. The porosity of the composite plays a crucial role in the performance of the orally disintegrating tablet. In order to have disintegration time of less than 60 seconds, the<br>
15 porosity of the composite should be at least about 50%. Another parameter which determines the wicking time, disintegration time in oral cavity and lag time is the particle size distribution of the composite. This parameter also determines the flow of the blend ready for compression into tablets. It is desirable that not less than 40% of particles are less than 150 microns.<br>
