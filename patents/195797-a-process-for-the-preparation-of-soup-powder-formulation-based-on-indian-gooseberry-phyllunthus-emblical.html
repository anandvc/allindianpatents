				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of soup powder formulation based on Indian gooseberry (Phyllunthus emblica L).<br>
The formulation prepared by this method described herein is in the form of an instant soup mix that can be reconstituted with hot water before consumption. The product in the dry powder form and can be stored for 4-6 months after suitable packing. The product has ascorbic acid 600-680 mg%, protein 7-8.5 %, carbohydrate 63-67.5 %, fat 1-1.2 %, fibre 10.3-12.1% and acidity 3.4-3.8% (as citric acid). Hot water reconstituted product has soup like taste, consistency and good palatability. Apart from us use as soup powder, this product, because of its high content of vitamin-C, can be a used as an ingredient in the preparation of nutraceuticals.<br>
Reference may be made to Indian gooseberry (Phyllunthus emblica L.) that is used in the formulation for instant soup mix described in this patent. The fruit pulp contains moisture - 81.2%, carbohydrate - 14.1%, fibre - 3.4%, and low levels of crotein and fat (The Wealth of India, Raw Materials, vol.Ill, p.168-170, 1952, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi). It is a rich source of vitamin-C; 300-1000 mg% of vitamin-C content has been reported (Ghorai K. and Sethi V., Indian Food Packer, 50(1), p. 11-18, 1996). Indian gooseberry is held in high esteem in Ayurvedic system of Indian medicine. According to Ayurveda, gooseberry has several therapeutic properties. It is reported to be acrid, cooling, diuretic and laxative. Dried Iruit is useful in hemorrhage, diarrhea and dysentery (The Wealth of India, Raw Materials, vol. Ill, p. 168-170, 1952, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi.). Gooseberry is used for the preparation of murabba (Ghorai K. and Sethi V., Indian Food Packer, 50(1), p. 11-18, 1996). Patented Information on Indian gooseberry<br>
covers: (1). vitamin and mineral composition (Creative Nutrition, Canada Corp., April, 1995), (2). of formulation containing gooseberry (amla) to Ayurvedic composition (Surendra Rohtagi, Inventor, India, June, 1996) comprising gooseberry and other herbs for treatment of some diseases, (3). A composition for comprising gooseberry as an important constituent claimed to be useful in psoriasis and eczema (Shah Eladevi, Inventor, England, December, 1997), (4). A patent on herbal tea composition contains gooseberry (amla) as one of the constituents (E. Excel International, USA, April, 2001). However, these patents do not cover the aspects related to a dry mix formulation that can be made into a soup.<br>
Reference may be made to patented information available on gooseberry of a different species (Phyllunthus acidus, Actinidia chinensis Planch, etc.,) grown mainly in European, American continents, China and Russia continents. But none of these patents describe the use of Indian gooseberry (Phyllunthus emblica L syn. Emblica officinalis Gaertn.). However, published information is available on harvesting storage, physico-chemical characteristics and technology of products of Indian gooseberry.<br>
Reference may be made to a comprehensive review on chemistry arid technology of Phyllunthus emblica L This review gives a detailed account of chemical composition of Indian gooseberry and preparation of preserve (murabba, pickles, juice squash, and syrup) (Kalra C.L, Indian Food Packer 42(2): 67-82, 1988). The review also covers the work done on the dehydration of gooseberry. Deseeded and pulp$d gooseberries were sun dried and changes in ascorbic acid contents were determined by Ramasastri B.V. (The Ind. J. Nutr. Dietet., 11, 134-136, 1974). Drying of fresh gooseberry pulp in a oven at 55-60°C was described by Sethi V., (Indian Food Pactoef<br>
40(4): 7-10, 1986). Gooseberry juice extraction and preparation of squash and ready-to-drink beverage and concentrate are reported by Prasad PSRK, Rao Suryaprakasa P.V., Rao Nageswara G. and Giridhar N (Indian Food Packer 22(6): 8-11, 1968). Loss of ascorbic acid during storage of juice was found to be 77% at the end of 10 weeks at a temperature of 29-37°C (Mehta U. and Rathore H., Indian Food Packer 30(1): 9-11, 1976).<br>
However, the patents and scientific papers mentioned as above, do not cover the aspects of formulation and processing of soup powder based on Indian gooseberry.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of soup powder formulation based on Indian gooseberry (Phyllunthus emblica L).<br>
Another object is to process raw Indian gooseberry into a form of dry powdet* suitable for reconstitution in hot water.<br>
Yet another object is to select an appropriate combination of gooseberry, garlic, ginger, green chilli, salt and puffed Bengal gram to provide high palatability to the* product.<br>
Still another object is to have the final product in the form of a free flowing material that can readily be reconstituted by mixing with hot water.<br>
Accordingly  the   present  invention   provides   a   process  for the   preparation   of  soup  powder formulation based on Indian gooseberry (Phyllurrthus emblica .) comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	washing the fresh gooseberry with water,<br>
b)	deseeding the washed gooseberry to remove seeds.<br>
c)	cutting the deseeded gooseberry manually into small pieces to facilitate better size reduction,<br>
d)	suspending the cut gooseberry in 0.1% potassium metabisulphite solution for about 15 mm to prevent black colour in cut gooseberry<br>
e)	mashing or mascerating 40-45 weight % of the above said gooseberry, 8-12 weight % garlic, 4-6 weight % ginger, 2-3 weight % green chilli and 2-4 weight% salt with water in a grinder to obtain a paste having spreadable consistency,<br>
f)	adding 30-35 weight % puffed Bengalgram Dal powder to the above said paste,<br>
g)	grinding and dehydrating the above said paste mix to a moisture content of 6-7 % in a conventional hot air dryer at a temperature ranging between 55-65°C for a period, ranging between 2 and 3 hr and<br>
h) pulverising the above said dehydrated material in a conventional mill to obtain the desired soup powder of particle size ranging between 170 and 200 microns.<br>
The formulation obtained by the process of the present invention is neither a product of chemical reaction nor a mere admixture but is a synergistic formulation having properties different than the aggregate properties of the individual components<br>
In our co-pending application 340/del/2002 we have described and claimed a soup powder formulation based on Indian gooseberry (phyllunthus emblica.)<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the soup powder formulation may have the<br>
following composition:<br>

Salt ranging from 2-4 weight%<br>
Puffed Bengalgram powder ranging from 30-35 weight%<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the soup powder formulation obtained may retain 66-68 weight% of vitamin C.<br>
The novelty of the present invention are: (1). A rich source of ascorbic acid i.e., gooseberry is used in the formulation. (2). Gooseberry in the dry form is used as a major ingredient in a soup powder formulation.<br>
(3). The formulation ensures a balanced taste of gooseberry, garlic, ginger, green chilli salt and puffed Bengal gram and has good reconstitution in hot water. (4). Consistency of reconstituted soup is achieved by   the use of puffed Bengal gram. (5). High retention (67.5%) of ascorbic acid in reconstituted soup is achieved.<br>
