				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an improved method of non-<br>
desctructive testing, ultrasonic method for assessing the depth of surface<br>
cracks in rolls of rolling mills (hot Strip Mill / Cold Rolling Mill) by using<br>
ultrasonic surface wave (90° angle) probe, particularly shallow cracks<br>
less than 0.7 mm deep in alloyed steel forged and hardened rolls as well as<br>
0.88 mm deep in cast double poured alloyed cast iron rolls, which are<br>
critical for their life as well as the surface quality of the rolled products.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
There was no NDT technique which could accurately measure the<br>
depth of the tight shallow surface breaking cracks (depth less than 1.0 mm)<br>
on the surface of the rolling mill (hot Strip Mill / Cold Rolling Mill) roll.<br>
The use of surface wave probes were limited to surface crack detection<br>
only. A novel technique using such surface wave probe was developed by<br>
the applicant to measure the depth of the surface breaking cracks, within<br>
the accuracy of ± 5%.<br>
The surface cracks were originated either due to manufacturing fault<br>
of the rolls or due to residual, thermal and mechanical stresses developed<br>
during their services in the mills. After roll dressing, if these cracks are<br><br>
missed by visual inspection, they will be opened up during operation in the mill<br>
and leave marks on the strips it downgrading / rejection. At the same time these<br>
cracks may also propagate further either leading to roll spalling or causing the<br>
roll unsuitable for use, if it reaches the zone of scrap diameter. To reduce such<br>
incidences at cold rolling mill and hot rolling mill of Tata Steel, an ultrasonic<br>
technique using single crystal surface wave (90° angle) probe was developed to<br>
assess the depth of these surface cracks.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
US 2003/0183011 discloses an ultrasonic detection apparatus and ultrasonic<br>
detection method employing the same. According to the method, while a<br>
transmitting transducer (2a) for transmitting an ultrasonic wave and a receiving<br>
transducer (2b) for receiving an ultrasonic wave are moved within a<br>
predetermined circular region (7) on a surface of a material being measured,<br>
ultrasonic waves are transmitted and received 10,000 times. Then, arithmetic<br>
averaging is performed every time an ultrasonic wave is received, on the<br>
ultrasonic wave and ultrasonic waves that have been received until then. For<br>
example, the aforementioned predetermined frequency is given by<br>
((n±(1/2))x(105xv/ΔL)(Hz),where ΔL is a variation in distance between the<br>
transmitting transducer and the receiving transducer, v is a transmission velocity<br>
of an ultrasonic wave transmitting in a material being detected, and n is a<br>
natural number. Consequently, it is possible to detect, with high accuracy, the<br>
thickness of a concrete material having a narrow width and a thick thickness, the<br>
thickness of the covering of a reinforcing bar and the diameter thereof, the<br>
depth of a crack and the like.<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an ultrasonic method of<br>
assessing a very tight cracks, which are invisible to naked eyes being measured<br>
for their depths, which is not possible by using A C potential drop method.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to measure the depth of the shallow<br>
cracks (less than 0.7 mm in forged and hardened alloyed steel rolls and less than<br>
0.88 mm in cast double poured alloyed cast iron rolls) within the accuracy of ±<br>
5%, which is not possible by using Time of flight Diffraction (TOFD) method.<br>
The measuring method of depth of cracks according to present invention is<br>
insensitive to ascertain width of the cracks since the ultrasonic pulses are<br>
reflected from one wall of the crack only.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have invented that using surface wave probe and measuring the<br>
amplitude of the reflected ultrasonic echo in terms of % FSH (Full<br>
Screen Height) from a surface crack, it is possible to predict the depth of<br>
surface crack in rolling mill rolls made of steel or cast iron within accuracy<br>
of ± 5%. For this, calibration curves, showing correlation between flaws<br>
echo amplutude and notch depths in calibration blocks, made of steel and<br>
cast iron, were prepared. A direct correlation was valid upto crack depth<br>
equivalent to half of the wavelength of ultrasound in the material of the<br>
calibration block. Such calibration curves were used to predict the surface<br>
crack depths in the rolling mill rolls of cold rolling mill. There was a good<br>
agreement between ultrasonically and actually measured crack depth of<br>
surface cracks in these rolls.<br>
The present invention provides an improved ultrasonic method for<br>
assessing the depth of surface cracks in rolls of rolling mills by using<br>
ultrasonic surface wave probe limited to surface crack detection, wherein<br>
shallow cracks less than 0.7 mm deep in alloyed steel being forged and<br>
hardened rolls, said surface wave probe being developed to measure the<br>
depth of surface breaking cracks invisible to necked eyes.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The surface wave of ultrasound travel along the surface of a material at a depth<br>
of 1 (one) wavelength from the surface. While traveling, when it interacts a<br>
surface cracks, having depth less than one wavelength, they are reflected back<br>
to create art ultrasonic signal on the oscilloscope. The amplitude of the reflected<br>
signal is a function of area of the reflector (normal plane of the crack).<br>
A direct correlation between crack depth and the amplitude of reflected signal<br>
has been observed during experimentation with notches (with different depths<br>
from 0.04 to 1.94 mm) made on calibration blocks of materials similar to roll<br>
material.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL WORK<br>
The proposed invention will be understood from the following description with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings and tables obtained on experimental<br>
results achieved to predict depth of cracks in rolling mill rolls through surface<br>
wave probe in which<br>
Fig 1 represents schematic diagram of calibration blocks (made of mild steel and<br>
cast iron) fabricated to calibrate the instrument for crack depth measurement.<br>
Fig 2 represents variation in Echo Amplitude (% FSH) in the calibration blocks<br>
(made of mild steel) with varying depths, using 2 MHZ, Surface Wave Probe at<br>
49.5 dB Attenuator setting, measured at 100mm from the notch.<br>
Fig 3 represents variation in Echo Amplitude (% FSH) in the calibration blocks<br>
(made of cast iron) with varying depths, using 2 MHZ, Surface Wave Probe at<br>
70.5 dB Attenuator setting, measured at 100mm from the notch.<br><br>

using an ultrasonic surface wave probe.<br>
Fig. 5 represents variation in Echo Amplitude (% FSH) with corresponding crack<br>
depth (in mm) for 3% / 4% Cr Forged Steel Rolls.<br>
Fig. 6 represents variation in Echo Amplitude (% FSH) with corresponding crack<br>
depth, in mm for Doubled Poured Alloy Cast Iron Rolls.<br>

Depths and their Actual Measured Values in CRM Roll.<br>

Details of the ultrasonic flaw equipment and surface wave probe: Make &amp; Model:<br>
Krautkramer Branson USN 52 R Probe:<br>
2 MHZ, 90° angle (Surface Wave), 8x9 mm.<br>
The calibration blocks made of steel and cast iron with various notches 0.04.<br>
0.08, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35,0.46, 0.58, 0.70, 0.78, 0.86, 0.94, 1.06, 1.17, 1.25, 1.35,<br>
1.47, 1.53, 1.66, 1.77, 1.90 and 1.94 mm deep were fabricated, as mentioned in<br>
Table 1 and shown in Fig.1, to calibrate the said conventional instrument for<br>
crack depth measurement.<br><br><br>
For 3% / 4% Cr Steel rolls, variation in echo amplitude (% FSH) in the<br>
calibration blocks (made of mild steel) with varying depths, using 2 MHZ, Surface<br>
Wave Probe at 49.5 dB attenuator setting has been shown in Table 2 and plotted<br><br>
in a graphical form as shown in Fig. 2.<br><br>
For alloy cast iron rolls, variation in echo amplitude (%FSH) in the calibration<br>
blocks (made of cast iron) with steps of varying depths, using 2 MHZ, surface<br>
wave probe at 49.5 dB attenuator setting has been shown in Table 3 and plotted<br>
in a graphical form as shown in Fig.3.<br><br><br>
Fig. 4 shows a schematic diagram of a surface crack (developed in mill<br>
operation), which propagated in transverse direction and was measured using<br>
surface wave probe.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As obvious from Fig. 2, up to 0.70 mm notch depth of the fabricated calibration<br>
block (made of mild steel), there is increase in echo amplitude with increase in<br>
the notch depth. Beyond 0.70 mm the relationship is reverse up to 0.86 mm and<br>
between 0.86 to 1.94 mm there is no direct correlation. These results show<br>
implications in measuring crack depth using surface wave probe if the depth of<br>
the crack is more than 0.70 mm. The crack depth can be measured only if it is<br>
less than 0.70 mm.<br>
Similarly, it is clear from Fig. 3, up to 0.88 mm notch depth fabricated calibration<br>
block (made of cast iron), there is increase in echo amplitude with increase in<br>
the notch depth. Beyond 0.88 mm the relationship is reverse up to 1.06 mm and<br>
between 1.06 to 1.94 mm there is no direct correlation. These results show<br>
implications in measuring crack depth using surface wave probe if the depth of<br>
the crack is more than 0.88 mm. The crack can be measured only if it is less<br>
than 0.88 mm in the case of cast iron.<br>
Cracks (in which depth is less or equal to the half wave length of the surface<br>
wave probe) can be measured accurately by using surface wave (90° angle)<br>
probe for the 3 % / 4% Cr Forged steel and alloy cast iron by using the graphs<br>
as shown in the Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 respectively.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the correlation between Ultrasonically Measured Surface Crack<br>
Depths and their Actual Measured Values in CRM Rolls.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the % error in Ultrasonically Measured Surface Crack Depths in CRM<br>
Rolls. It is well within ± 5%.<br>
After, implementation on the roll shop of cold rolling mill of Tata Steel, it has<br>
been observed that using this method, it is possible to predict the depth of<br>
surface cracks within an accuracy of ± 5%.<br><br>
