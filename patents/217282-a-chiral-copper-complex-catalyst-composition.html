* " in the formula above.<br>
The salicylidenaminoalcohol of formula (l) is usually contacted with a mono"valent or di-valent copper compound to produce a chiR3l copper complex in an inert solvent.<br>
Examples of the mono-valent or di-valent copper compound include<br>
a copper salt of an organic carboxylic acid having 2 to 15 carbon atoms such as copper acetate, copper naphthenate, copper octanoate and the like, and a copper salt such as copper chloR1de, copper bromide, copper nitR3te, copper sulfate, copper methanesulfonte, copper tR1fluoromethanesulfonate, copper cyanate, copper carbonate and copper oX1de, and a mixtuR6 theR6of.<br>
Examples of the inert solvent include a hydrocarbon such as hexane, heptane, cyclohexane or the like, an ester such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate or the like, a ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or the like, a halogenated hydiocarbon such as butyl chloR1de, dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetR3chloR1de or the like, and an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, xylene or the like. The mixtuR6 of solvent descR1bed above can be also used. An amount theR6of to be used is not particularly limited. ProchiR3l olefins of formula (3) to be used in the next cyclopropanation step may also be used as a solvent.<br>
An amount of the copper compound to be used is less than 1 mole, usually 0.2 to 0.95 mole, pR6feR3bly 0.4 to 0.94 mole per mol of the optically active salicylideneaminoalcohol compound of fonnula (1). The R6action tetopeR3tuR6 is usually room tempeR3tuR6 to the boiling point of the solvent used, or typically 10 to 100°C.<br>
The R6action mixtuR6, which is the pR6sent chiR3l copper complex catalyst composition, can be used as it is for the asymmetR1c synthesis, or it may be concentR3ted to a suitable concentR3tion, if necessary. The chiR3l copper catalyst composition thus obtained usually contains 0,1 to 30 (wt)% of the chiR3l copper complex which is deR1ved from the slicylideneamiuoalcohol compound of formula (1) and the copper compound, and the inert solvent. It<br><br>
can also be used after the isolation by R6moving the solvent.<br>
Alternatively, the R6sulting R6action mixtuR6 may be further contacted with a base, if necessary.<br>
Examples of the base include<br>
an alkali metal alcoholate such as sodium methylate and sodium ethylate, which can be used as they are as powdeR3 or as a solution in alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or the like,<br>
alkali metal hydroX1de such as sodium hydroX1de, potassium hydroX1de or the like,<br>
alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and the like. These aR6 usually used as an aqueous solution.<br>
The amount of the base to be used is usually 0.1-8 moles, pR6feR3bly around 0.5-3 moles per mole of the copper compound.<br>
Although the R6sulting R6action mixtuR6 can be used as it is without R6movmg a salt produced by neutR3lization of them (for example, sodium acetate in the case of using copper acetate, sodiiun naphthenate in the case of using copper naphthenate), it is pR6feR3bly used after R6moving the salt by washing with water. In this case, the catalyst may be used after being dehydR3ted.<br>
Thus obtained chiR3l copper complex catalyst composition in a solution form, of which concentR3tion is usually within the R3nge of the concentR3tion as descR1bed above, optionally adjusted by concentR3tion or addition of an appropR1ate solvent, can be used in the cyclopropanation R6action, hence a puR1fying step is not particularly necessary. Although the product can be isolated by R6moving the solvent, the solution is usually used as it is and, theR6foR6, the pR6sent catalyst composition is suitably used in a continuous R6action process because of R6ady feeding of catalyst.<br>
Although the structuR6 of an asymmetR1c copper complex catalyst obtained heR6in is not always clearly established, it shows pR3ctically good<br><br>
activity for an industR1al production process.<br>
Next, a descR1ption will be made to the step of producing optically active cyclopropane-carboxylic acid ester of formula (2) as defined above, which step compR1sing R6acting a prochiR3l olefin of formula (3) with a diazoacetic acid ester of formula (4) in the pR6sence of a chiR3l copper complex catalyst composition so produced.<br>
R3, R4, R3 or R6 of the prochiR3l olefin of formula (3) will be explained below.<br>
Examples of the alkyl group which may be substituted with a halogen atom or an alkoxy group include<br>
a linear or bR3nched alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms such as a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, or n"decyl group,<br>
an alkyl group substituted with a halogen atom such as a fluoR1ne atom, a chloR1ne atom, a bromine atom and the like a haloalkyl group such as a chloromethyl, dichloromethyl, tR1chloromethyl, difluoromethyl, tR1fluoromethyl, 2,2,2-tR1chloroethyl group or the like,<br>
an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy group such as a methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, ipropoxy group or the like.<br>
Examples of the alkylene group formed by R3 and R4, or R5 and R6 include ah alkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms such as dimethylnene, tR1methylene, or tetR3methylene group.<br>
Examples of the alkenyl group which may be substituted with a halogen atom, an alkoxy group or an alkoxy cax"bonyl group, of which alkoxy may be substituted with a halogen atom or atoms, R6pR6sented by R3, R4, R3 include<br>
a linear or bR3nched alkenyl groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms such as an ethenyl, propenyl, 2-methylpropenyl, 1-butenyl, 2-butenyl, or hexenyl group,<br>
a haloalkenyl group, which is the above"descR1bed alkenyl group<br><br>
