The radio wave circuit 2 receives the radio wave signal including a telephone signal and a paging signal from a base station (not shown) and outputs a baseband reception signal from the received the radio wave signal. The processing and control circuit 5 receives the base band reception signal and in response to a call in the base band reception signal operates the vibrator 9 or the buzzer 10 to inform the operator of the arrival of the call and supplies a sound signal to the speaker 7 to reproduce the sound signal for communication through the sound processing circuit 27.  The microphone 24 receives the sound from the<br>
operator and supplies a second sound signal to the processing and control circuit 5 through the sound processing circuit 27.  The processing and control circuit 5 processes the second sound signal and supplies a base band transmission signal.  The radio wave circuit 2 transmits the radio wave signal to the base station from the base band transmission signal from the antenna 1.  The processing and control circuit 5 generates a dialing signal in response to the ten-keys 8a on the operation panel 8 and a one-touch dialing key 8b .  That is, when the operator depress the one-touch dialing key 8b , the processing and control circuit 5 generates the dialing signal in accordance with telephone number data in the non-volatile memory 12, which was stored in response to the operation to the operation panel 8.  The radio wave circuit 2 also transmits the dialing signal through the transmitted radio wave signal.<br>
The non-volatile memory 12 further stores a safety<br>
driving flag which is inputted from the operation panel 8<br>
under control of the processing and control circuit 5, telephone number data, a character alarming character message, a sound alarming message in response to the operation by the operator to the operation panel 8 and the microphone 24 under the control of the processing and control circuit 5.

The speed detection circuit 3 comprises a reception electrostatic field intensity measuring circuit 14, a memory 16, a variation detection circuit 17, a memory 19, and a timing control circuit 18.<br>
The reception electrostatic field intensity measuring circuit 14 measures the reception electrostatic field intensity from the output of the radio wave circuit 2 in response to a timing signal from the timing control circuit 18.  The memory 16 stores data of the reception electric field intensity.  More specifically, the memory 16 repeatedly stores recent predetermined sets of output data from the reception electrostatic field intensity measuring circuit 14.  The variation detection circuit 17 detects variations in the recent predetermined sets of output data to determine a phasing pitch and generates a speed signal from the detected variation.  The timing control circuit 18 generates the timing signal in accordance with the speed signal.<br>

signal from a Doppler shift which occurs between the base station and the mobile unit communication apparatus which relatively moves against the base station.  Moreover, it is possible to use the vehicle speed signal 23a supplied from the vehicle (not shown) carrying the mobile communication apparatus instead the speed signal from the speed detection circuit 3.<br>
Fig. 7 depicts a flow chart of this embodiment showing a main routine executed by the processing and control circuit 5.<br>
The processing and control circuit 5 receives an input operation in step s3 and s4.  That is, the processing and control circuit 5 receives mode-setting for the security such as a call neglecting mode, a sound alarming message mode, a character alarming message mode, an alarming sound mode, transmitting sound and character message modes, an automatic answering mode, a vibrator mode, a paging mode, a receiving character message mode, a telephone number detecting mode, and a line hold mode and stores corresponding flags in the non-volatile memory 12.<br>
Moreover, the processing and control circuit 5 receives a decreasing sound level of alarming mode, that is, a manner mode, a sound alarming message mode, a character alarming message mode or the like and stores corresponding flags in the non-volatile memory 12.<br>
The processing and control circuit 5 receives a call in steps s5 and s2 and a calling operation in steps s6 and si and returns to step s3.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts a flow chart of this embodiment showing the calling operation si.<br>
The processing and control circuit 5 executes a program as shown in Fig. 3 in response to a calling operation by the operator to the operation panel 8.<br>
In response to the calling operation, the processing and control circuit 5 checks whether the safety driving flag has been set in the non-volatile memory 12 in step sl-1.  If the safety driving flag has not been set, the conventional calling operation is executed in step sl-6.<br>
If the safety driving flag has been set, the processing and control circuit 5 operates the speed signal detection circuit 3 and receives the speed signal in step sl-2.  The processing and control circuit 5 checks whether the speed signal indicates a high speed by comparing at least a reference.  If the speed signal indicates the high speed, the processing and control circuit 5 informs the operator of alarming by the speaker 7, that is a sound alarming message, by the display 11, that is, an alarming character message or flickering a predetermined sign on the display 11, inhibits the actual calling operation, that is, the processing and control circuit 5 neglects the calling<br>
demand In step sl-4.<br>
In step sl-4, the processing and control circuit 5 further transmits a character message automatically to the called party determined by the operation to the operation panel 8 if the character message is stored in the non-volatile memory 12 and the corresponding flag has been set in the non-volatile memory 12.  Moreover, in step sl-4, the processing and control circuit 5 further transmits a sound message automatically to the called party determined by the operation to the operation panel 8 if the sound message is stored in the non-volatile memory 12 and the corresponding flag has been set.<br>
In step sl-3, if the speed signal does not indicate the high speed, the processing and control circuit 5 operates a timer 5a included therein.  When a predetermined interval has passed, processing returns to step sl-2 to detect the speed again and repeats the processing in the loop of the step sl-5, sl-2, sl-3 until the high speed is detected.  That is, if the speed of the vehicles increase and reaches the reference high speed, the operations in step sl-4 are executed more surely.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts a flow chart of this embodiment showing a call arrival operation.<br>
The processing and control circuit 5 executes a program as shown in Fig. 4 in response to the call from the<br>
base station.<br>
In response to the call from the base station, the processing and control circuit 5 checks whether the safety driving flag has been set in the non-volatile memory 12 in step s2-l.  If the safety driving flag has not been set, the conventional response operation is executed in step s2-8.<br>
If the safety driving flag has been set, the processing and control circuit 5 operates the speed signal detection circuit 3 and receives the speed signal in step s2-2.  The processing and control circuit 5 checks whether the speed signal indicates a high speed by comparing the reference.  If the speed signal indicates the high speed, the processing and control circuit 5, the processing and control circuit 5 checks whether there is the hands-free mount detection signal in step s2-4.  If there is the hands-free mount detection signal from the hands-free mount detection circuit 13, the processing and control circuit 5 sets the flag of the hands-free mode.  The hand-free mode is that gains of the amplifier 27a and 27d for the microphone 24 and the receiver 7 are increased.  Then, processing proceeds to step s2-5.<br>
If there is no hands-free mount detection signal, processing directly proceeds to step s2-5.<br>
In step s2-5, the processing and control circuit 5<br>
checks whether there is the vehicle mount adapter detection signal in step s2-5 fro the vehicle mount adapter detection circuit 4.  If there is the vehicle mount adapter detection signal, processing proceeds to a processing A, that is, a subroutine s2-9.  If there is not the vehicle mount adapter detection signal, processing proceeds to a processing B, that is, a subroutine s2-10.<br>
Fig. 5 depicts a flow chart of this embodiment showing the processing A s2-9.<br>
In the processing A s2-9, the processing and control circuit 5 checks whether the operator is communicating in step s3-l.  If the operator is communicating, the processing and control circuit 5 generates a sound alarming message.<br>
If the operator is not communicating, in step s3-3 the processing and control circuit 5 executes all of or some of functions in accordance with the flags which has been set from the operation panel 8 in the non-volatile memory 12.  The functions are neglecting the call, generating a sound alarming message, displaying a character alarming message, generating an alarming sound, transmitting sound and character messages, effecting automatically answering, operating the vibrator 9, receiving a character message in the paging signal, detecting the telephone number and storing it in the<br>
non-volatile memory 12 for one-touch dialing, or holding the line.<br>
Fig. 6 depicts a flow chart of this embodiment showing the processing B S2-10.<br>
In the processing B s2-10, it is assumed that the operator is getting on a train, a bus, or the like.<br>
In step s4-l, the processing and control circuit 5 checks whether the operator is communicating.  If the operator is communicating, the processing and control circuit 5 generates the sound alarming message to the operator in step s4-2.<br>
If the operator is not communicating, in step s4-3, the processing and control circuit 5 executes all of or some of functions in accordance with the flags which have been set from the operation panel 8 in the non-volatile memory 12.  The function are operating the sound processing circuit 27 to decrease the sound level of the alarm informing the arrival of the call, generating the sound alarming message to provide the caution, generating the alarm sound, operating the vibrator.<br>
In step s4-3 the processing and control circuit 5 further operates the timer 5a.<br>
In step s4-4, the processing and control circuit 5 checks whether there is a key input.  If there is no key input, the processing and control circuit 5 checks the<br>
speed signal is one.  However, the speed may be classified such that a high speed, a middle speed, and a low speed. The security operations in steps sl-4, s3-3. s4-3. s4-6, s4-7 may be executed in accordance with the plurality of classified speeds.<br>
predetermined time interval set in the timer 5a has expired. If the time interval has expired, in step s4-6,the processing and control circuit 5 executes all or some of functions in accordance with the flags in the non-volatile memory 12.  The functions are neglecting the call transmits the sound message to the caller, effecting an automatic answering operation, transmitting or receiving a character message through the paging signal, detecting the telephone number and storing it in the non-volatile memory 12 for one-touch dialing.<br>
In step s4-4, if there is a key input, the<br>
processing and control circuit 5 increases the gain of the microphone 24 by operating the sound processing circuit 27 to decrease a speech level of the operator in step s4-7.<br>
In step s4-4, if there is no key input, the processing and control circuit 5 executes step s4-4 until the predetermined interval set to the timer 5a expires.  If the predetermined interval expired, the processing and control circuit 5 effects all of or some of functions such as neglecting the call, transmitting a sound message, automatic answering, transmitting or receiving character message, and detecting the telephone number of the caller and store it in the non-volatile memory for the one touch dialing in steps s4-6.<br>
