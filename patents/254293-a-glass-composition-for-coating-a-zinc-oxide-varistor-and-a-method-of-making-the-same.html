PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a glass composition for coating a zinc oxide varistor and a method of making the same<br>
This invention also relates to a method of coating a zinc oxide varistor with the glass composition and to zinc oxide varistor coated with the glass composition.<br>
PRIOR ART DESCRIPTION<br>
Varistors are electrical devices which are used as surge arresters or lightening arresters to protect transmission and distribution lines and peripheral devices thereof from the destructive voltage levels induced or caused by lightening impulses or switching surges. Zinc oxide varistors have lately replaced the silicon carbide varistors because of the several advantages they posses like cost effectiveness, flexibility of being fabricated into a variety of shapes, excellent non- linearity with respect to voltage, discharge withstand current rating properties or life characteristics under voltage. A zinc oxide varistor comprises a sintered varistor body and electrodes in contact with the varistor body. The varistor body comprises zinc oxide as the many components and a high resistive coating formed or applied on the varistor body. The high resistive coating provides electric insulation to prevent flash over or Creepage when a high voltage appears on the varistor body. US5294908 describes a glass composition for coating zinc oxide varistor comprising 50.0 to 75.0 percent by weight of PbO, 10.0 to 30.0 percent by weight of ZnO, 5.0 to 10.0 percent by weight of B2O3 and 6.0 to 15.0 percent by weight of Si02. US5547907 describes a glass composition for coating zinc oxide varistor comprising 50.0<br><br><br>
to 64 percent by weight of PbO, 25 to 30.0 percent by weight of ZnO, 5.0 to 10.0 percent by weight of B203 and 6.0 to 15.0 percent by weight of Si02. US 5594406 describes a glass composition for coating zinc oxide varistor comprising a mixture of lead borosilicate-type glass particulate material and at least one metal oxide selected from the group consisting of cobalt oxide, magnesium oxide, yttrium oxide, antimony oxide, manganese oxide, tellurium oxide, lanthanum oxide, cerium oxide, praseodium oxide, neodymium oxide, samarium oxide, europium oxide, gadolinium oxide, terbium oxide, dysprosium oxide, holmium oxide, erbium oxide, thulium oxide, ytterbium oxide and lutetium oxide. In order to reduce energy consumption and cost and to reduce cycle time of coating the varistor and to increase productivity of the varistor, it is very much desirable to have glass compositions of low melting temperatures. There is, therefore, scope for development of such glass compositions.<br>

Another object of the invention is to provide a method of making the above glass coating composition.<br><br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method of coating a zinc oxide varistor with the above glass composition.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a zinc oxide varistor coated with the above glass composition.<br>

6% of Si02, 2 to 3% of A1203, 0.04 - 1% of MgO, 1 to 5% of Bi203 and 3 to 5% of Sn02 at 700° to 800°C.<br>
ii)        quenching the melt of step (i) in water;<br>
iii)       crushing the beads formed in step (ii) and sieving the powder to obtain a powder of 2-4 microns; and<br>
iv)       mixing the powder obtained in step (iii) with 4 to 5%&gt; of a binder in water solution to make slurry.<br><br><br>
According to the invention there is also provided a method of coating a zinc oxide varistor with the above glass composition the method comprising the following steps;<br>
i)	precleaned and demoisturised zinc oxide varistor at 100 - 120°C.<br>
ii)        applying the glass slurry on the varistor.<br>
iii)       curing the varistor at 475-525°C.<br>
Preferably the glass composition is applied on the varistor by dipping the varistor in glass slurry or by spraying the glass slurry or by applying the glass slurry with a brush. The binder is selected from polyvinyl acetate, methyl cellulose, and polyester resin. Preferably the binder is methyl cellulose. Preferably the glass composition 47-50%) of PbO, 29-33% of ZnO, 10-21% of B203, 4-6% of Si02, 2 to 3% of A1203, 0.04 - 1% of MgO, 1 to 5% of Bi203 and 3 to 5% of Sn02 and 4 to 5wt % of a binder. In one embodiment of the invention the glass composition comprises 47.81%) of PbO, 32.47% of ZnO, 20.74% of B203, 5% of Si02, 2% of A1203, 0.75% of MgO, 1.5% of Bi203 and 3.18% of Sn02 and 4 wt% of methyl cellulose. In another embodiment of the invention, the glass composition comprises 47.81%) of PbO, 32.47% of ZnO, 10.74%) of B203&gt; 5% of Si02, 2% of A1203, 0.75% of MgO, 1.5% of Bi203 and 3.18% of Sn02 and 4 wt% of methyl cellulose. Prior to applying the glass composition, the varistor is surface cleaned by acetone and demoisturised by heating it at 100 tol20°C.
