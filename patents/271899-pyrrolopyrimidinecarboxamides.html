Salts of the compounds of formula (I), the N-oxides thereof and the stereoisomers of the compounds and the N-oxides thereof can be obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (for example a ketone such as acetone, methylethylketone or methylisobutylketone, an ether such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofurane or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride or chloroform, a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, a low molecular weight aliphatic ester such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate, or water) which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is then added. The add or base can be employed in salt preparation, depending on whether a mono- or polybasic acid or base is concerned and depending on which salt is desired, in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a non-solvent for the salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted into the free compounds which, in turn, can be converted into salts. In this manner, pharmaceuticalty unacceptable salts, which can be obtained, for<br><br>
example, as process products in the manufacturing on an industrial scale, can be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts by processes known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of formula ((), the salts thereof and the stereoisomers of the compounds and the salts according to the invention can be converted into their N-oxides, for example, by reaction with peracids, such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid or peracetic acid. The person skilled in the art is familiar with the reaction conditions for carrying out the N-oxidation.<br>
Pure diasfereomers and pure enantiomers of (he compounds of formula (I) and the sails thereof, the Nl-oxides of the compounds and the N-oxides of the salts can be obtained e.g. by asymmetric synthesis, by using chiral starting compounds in synthesis and/or by splitting up enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures obtained in synthesis. Preferably, the pure diastereomeric and pure enantiomeric compounds of the invention are obtainable by using chiral starting compounds in synthesis and/or by splitting up enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures obtained in synthesis.<br>
Enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures can be split up into the pure enantiomers and pure diastereomers by methods known to a person skilled in the art. Preferably, diastereomeric mixtures are separated by crystallization, in particular fractional crystallization, or chromatography. Enartiomeric mixtures can be separated e.g. by forming diasfereomers with a chiral auxiliary agent, resolving the diastereomers obtained and removing the chiral auxiliary agent. As chiral auxiliary agents, for example, chiral acids can be used to separate enantiomeric bases and chiral bases can be used to separate enantiomeric acids via formation of diastereomeric salts. Furthermore, diastereomeric derivatives such as diastereomeric esters can be formed from enantiomeric mixtures of alcohols or enantiomeric mixtures of acids, respectively, using chiral acids or chiral alcohols, respectively, as chiral auxiliary agents. Additionally, diastereomeric complexes or diastereomeric dathrates may be used for separating enantiomeric mixtures. Alternatively, enantiomeric mixtures can be split up using chiral separating columns in chromatography. Another suitable method for the isolation of enantiomers is the enzymatic separation.<br>

Biological investigations<br>
Method for measuring inhibition of the type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE5) activity:<br>
As a source for human PDE5, platelets are used. For that purpose, 150 ml fresh blood from human donors anticoagulated with citrate [final concentration 0.3% (w/v)] is centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min to obtain the so-called platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) as a supernatant. 1/10 volume of ACD solution (85 mM Na3-citrate, 111 mM D-glucose, 71 mM citric acid, pH 4.4) is added to 9/10 volume of PRP. After centrifugation (1,400 g, 10 min) the cell peUet is resuspended in 3 mi homogenizalion buffer (NaCi 140 mM, KCI 3.8 mM, EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) ImM, MgCb ImM, Tris-HCl 20 mM, beta-mercaptoethanol 1mM, pH 8.2) plus protease-inhibitor mix giving rise to the final concentrations of 0.5 mM Pefablock (Roche), 10 |jM Leupeptin, 5 |jM Trypstninhibitor, 2 mM Benzamidin and 10 |jM Pepstatin A. The suspension is sonified and thereafter centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 g. The resulting supernatant (platelet lysale) is used for enzymatic testings.<br>
PDE5A1 activity is inhibited by the compounds of the invention in a modified SPA (scintillation proximity assay) test, supplied by Amersham Biosciences (see procedural instructions "phosphodiesterase [3H]cAMP SPA enzyme assay, code TRKQ 7090"), carried out in 96-well microtitre plates (MTP's). The test volume is 100 ^.1 and contains 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg of BSA (travine serum albumin)/ml, 5 mM Mg^*, 1 pM motapizone, 10 nM PDE2 inhibitor 2-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyt)-7-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxy-1-(2-phenylethyl)propyl]-5-methylimidazo(5,1-/][1,2.4]triazin-4(3H)-one, 0.5 ^M cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) (incladmg about 50,000 cpm of (3H]cGMP as a tracer), 1 jil of the respective compound dilution in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and sufficient PDE5-containing platelet lysat (10,000xg supernatant, see above) to ensure that 10-20 vrt% of the cGMP is converted under the said experimental conditions. The final concentration of DMSO in the assay (1 % v/v) does not substantially affect the activity of the PDE investigated. After a preincubation of 5 min at 37Â°C, the reaction is started by adding the substrate (cGMP) and the assay is incubated for a further 15 min; after that, it is stopped by adding SPA beads (50 nl). In accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, the SPA beads had previously been resuspended in water, but are then diluted 1:3 (v/v) in water; the diluted solution also contains 3 mM 8-methoxymethyl-3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to ensure a complete PDE activity stop. After the beads have been sedi-mented {&gt; 30 min), the MTP's are analyzed in commercially available luminescence detection devices. The corresponding iCw values of the compounds for the inhibition of PDE activity are determined from the concentration-effect curves by means of non-linear regression.<br>

Animal pharmacological testing<br>
Nitric oxide regulates smooth muscle tone by elevation of cGMP via activation of guanylate cyclase and subsequent activation of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase. The amplitude and duration of the cGMP signal in smooth muscle is largely regulated by cGIVIP-specific cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5). Therefore, inhibition of PDE5 or activation of guanylate cyclase causes altered arterial blood pressure response, which is more pronounced under conditions of acute arterial hypertension, which can be easily induced by continuous intravenous (i.v.) phenylephrine(PE)-infusion. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of the selective PDE5 inhibitors described in this invention on phenylephrine-induced acute arterial hypertension and sodium-nitroprusside (SNP) induced blood pressure response in anaesthetised male Spraque Dawley rats.<br>
Method<br>
The test compound (suspended in a 4% w/v aqueous methylcellulose solution either 3 or 10 mg/kg) or placebo {i.e. 4% aqueous methylcellulose solution) is administered orally to conscious Spraque Dawley rats 90 min prior to SNP administration. 40 min later, rats are anaesthetised by intramuscular administration of 80 mg/kg ketamine-HCI + 4 mg^g xylazin-HCI and ventilated with -1.5% isoflurane in a mixture of ambient air and 40% oxygen. Catheters for i.v. PE- and SNP- administration and recording of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) are inserted. One hour after compound or placebo administration, a continuous i.v. (V. femoralis) PE-infusion (3 pg/kg/min at an infusion rate of 0.06 ml/min) is started and maintained till the end of the experiment. 30 min after start of the PE-infusfon, an i.v.-bolus of the NO-donor sodium nifroprusside (SNP, 30 pg/kg at a volume of 1.0 ml/kg) is administered. To assess the effect of test compounds (PDE5 inhibitory activity) in comparison to placebo, MAP response is analysed, MAP prior to SNP-administration and area under the curve of MAP within 180 s following SNP-administration, corrected for initial MAP (corr. AUCMAPO-I8OS) is used, to describe altered arterial vascular response and thus in vivo PDE5-inhibitory activity. The efficacy (% change vs. control) achievable in this model is approximately between -13% and ^5% effectforthe examples 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. 10, 11, 15, 16, 23, 24, 26, 50, 98, 99, 112, 113, 132, 171, 172, 173, 176, 177, 178, 179,181, 182, 187, 228, 237, 269 and 272.<br><br>
