				<td>ISOPROPANOL WATER SOLVATE OF OLANZAPINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention belongs to the field of organic   chemistry and relates to a new mixed solvate form of 2-methyl-4- (4-methyl-l-piperazinyl) -10H-thieno [2, 3-Jb] [1, 5] benzodiazepine (hereinafter referred to by its- generic name "olanzapine"), a process for its preparation and processes for the preparation of polymorphic form I of olanzapine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Olanzapine has shown to have high activity with regard to the central nervous system and is also useful for the treatment<br><br><br>
of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorders, acute mania, mild anxiety states and psychosis.<br>
Various polymorphic and psetidopolymorphic forms , such as solvate-s, of olanzapine have become known. Some of them are useful for conversion to other desirable forms.<br>
The British patent GB 1 533 235 discloses antipsychotically effective thienobenzodiazepines by a generic formula which also covers olanzapine.<br>
US patent 5,229,382 discloses 'olanzapine explicitly. The described process for its' synthesis involves a crystallization from acetonitrile.<br>
EP-B-733 635 claims crystalline form II olanzapine, and this polymorphic form is said to be mote stable than the material obtained according to US 5,229,382 which is designated "form I olanzapine". Both the form I .and'the form II of olanzapine are characterized by e. g. X-ray data. The preparation of the more stable form II of olanzapine is effected by dissolving technical grade olanzapine in ethyl acetate and crystallization from the resulting solution by any conventional process such as seeding, cooling, scratching the glass of the reaction vessel or other common techniques.<br>
WO 02/18390 discloses the monohydrate form I and the dihydrate form I of olanzapirie, a process for production thereof and a process for production of form I of olanzapine which comprises the steps of stirring olanzapine monohydrate form I or crude olanzapine or form II of olanzapine in methylene chloride at reflux, cooling, filtering and drying. It is also described that a repeating of the process described in US 5,22 9,382 Example 1, subexample 4 did not lead to formation of form I of olanzapine.<br><br>
WO 03/101997’ relates to processes for preparation of form I of olanzapine by regulation of the pH-value of the solution,<br>
WO 03/055438 discloses the preparation of form I olanzapine by crystallization from ethanol and subsequent conversion of the obtained ethanol solvate,<br>
US patent 5,637,584 discloses the (mono)iuethylene chloride solvate form of olanzapine and a method for its conversion to the polymorphic form I of olanzapine.<br>
EP-B-733 634 discloses three specific solvates of olanzapine, namely the methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol solvates and a process for production of form II olanzapine by drying such a solvate.<br>
WO 03/097650 describes two new mixed solvate forms, the water/methylene chloride solvate and the water/DMSO solvate, methods for preparing them, and their transformation to polymorphic form I.<br>
WO 2004/006933 discloses a process for the preparation of form I olanzapine, as well as various pseudopolymorphic forms, namely the isopropanol solvate, and the acetonitrile/methylene chloride/water and acetonitrile/water mixed solvates of olanzapine, and the polymorphic form A.<br>
However, the prior" art processes for preparation of form I olanzapine often do not lead to a satisfactory • yield. Moreover, they 'result in olanzapine having a purity which is not satisfactory for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations as impurities are present which are difficult to be removed. This is often caused by undesired impurities which are formed upon preparation of precursors and are<br><br>
therefore, upon conversion of the precursors to form I olanzapine, introduced in the final product.<br>
Further, prior art processes often do not allow use of higher temperatures without impairing yield or purity of the form I olanzapine.<br>
Consequently, there is still a need for improved processes to prepare purified olanzapine form I in a satisfactory yield.<br>
Further, there is a need for precursors which allow the easy preparation of polymorphic forms of olanzapine or the conversion to other forms of olanzapine in a high purity.<br>
These problems are solved by the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a water/isopropanol mixed solvate which contains 2 molecules of water and 1 molecule of isopropanol per 2 molecules of olanzapine.<br>
The solvate according to the invention was subjected to an x-ray structure analysis. Single crystal x-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer by means of the Nonius Collect Software. The structure was solved by using SIR97 (direct methods) and the refinement was performed with X'tal software. The crystallographic data for the olanzapine isopropanol/water mixed solvate, particularly the interplanar distances (a, b, c) and angles (a, (3, y), are indicated in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Thus, the invention also relates to the isopropanol/water mixed solvate of olanzapine characterized by the x-ray structure shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows the ORTEP view of the asymmetric unit of the solvate according to the invention which corresponds to the formula-C17H20N4S. H2O. ½(C3H7OH) . It is to be noted the population of the disordered isopropanole molecule in Figure 1 is 0.50. Thus, an isopropanol molecule occurs only with every second molecule of olanzapine.<br>
Further,  the  solvate  according  to  the  invention  is characterized by a NMR spectrum in CDCI3 showing peaks at approximately  1.20  ppm,  2.20-2.40  ppm  and  4.03  ppm. Preferably, the solvate is characterized by the NMR spectrum shown in Figure 2.<br>
The NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian UNITY+ 300 (300 MHz) spectrometer and CDC13 as solvent with tetramethylsilane as internal standard.<br>
Figure 2 shows the NMR spectrum of the solvate according to<br>
the invention. The peaks were assigned as follows . (1H NMR;<br>

The solvate according to the invention is prepared by a process which comprises crystallizing it from a solvent mixture comprising isopropanol and water in a ratio of at least 9 to 1, preferably at least 20 to 1 and most preferred at least 35 to 1 parts by volume.<br>
It has been shown particularly advantageous if the crystallization is effected by adding the water to a solution comprising olanzapine and the isopropanol.<br>
It has unexpectedly been found that the preparation of the olanzapine water-isopropanol mixed solvate can easily be accomplished if olanzapine is crystallized by using a solvent mixture which comprises isopropanol and water. In this way persistent impurities are removed from' the active compound<br><br>
and the dissolved olanzapine can also be recovered from filtrates in an easy manner.<br>
The olanzapine used as a starting material for the preparation of the water/isopropanol mixed solvate according to the invention can be in any form, e.g. it can be used when it is contained in a reaction s.olution or in a filtrate in combination • with other solvents,  or it can be in crude, anhydrous or any solvated or hydrated form or a mixture thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the water/isopropanol mixed solvate according to the invention is prepared from a reaction mixture. An example is given in the following.<br>
For  this  purpose,  a  mixture  of  4-amino-2-methyl-10H-thieno[2,3-bJ [1,5]benzodiazepine  , hydrochloride   and   1- methylpiperazine is heated in high boiling solvents, e.g. dimethylsulfoxide or toluene, or mixtures thereof/ preferably under reflux, until the reaction is completed, preferably 3 to 12 hours.  The solution is then cooled,  preferably to temperatures  ranging from 90 °C to  room temperature,  and optionally a part of the reaction mixture is distilled off, preferably under vacuum, at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 90 °C,  preferably at 50 °C to 90 °C.  To the obtained solution isopropanol and water are separately added in any order or a mixture thereof is added.  Preferably, isopropanol is added first, followed by the addition of water to initiate crystallization. Preferably, the clear solution is cooled to temperatures from boiling temperature to 10°C, and water is added to start crystallization. The product is then filtered off, washed with isopropanol,  dried at room temperature under vacuum to  a  constant weight,  and the<br><br>
water/isopropanol mixed solvate according to the invention is obtained.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the water/isopropanol mixed solvate of  olanzapine is prepared from mother liquors containing olanzapine and for- "example methylene chloride, or from a methylene chloride solvate. form. An example is given in the following.<br>
In such a case, the solvent is . optionally distilled off, preferably under vacuum, and subsequently isopropanol and water are separately added in any order or a mixture thereof is added. Preferably, isopropanol is added first, followed by the addition of water to initiate crystallization. After the crystallization has been completed, the precipitate is filtered off and dried.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the water/isopropanol mixed solvate is prepared from crude olanzapine, or from olanzapine in anhydrous or any solvated or hydrated form, or mixtures thereof. An example is given in the following.<br>
In such a case, the olanzapine is dissolved by heating in a mixture of isopropanol and water, or in either isopropanol or water with the other solvent being subsequently added. The obtained clear solution is cooled to temperatures from boiling temperature to 10°C, and water is added to start crystallization. The product is then filtered off, washed with isopropanol, dried at room temperature under vacuum to a constant weight, and the water-isopropanol mixed solvate according to the invention is obtained.<br>
The water-isopropanol mixed solvate obtained .by any one of the above processes can optionally be recrystallized. During the  crystallization  or  precipitation  procedure  of  any -<br><br>
process, ethylenediaminotetraacetic acid disodium salt can be added and,.' after stirring, undissolved material be hot filtered.<br>
The water-isopropanol mixed solvate according to the invention prepared by any of the above processes is of high quality and substantially free of impurities and is therefore ideally suited for the preparation of various other highly pure solvates, hydrates or anhydrous forms or mixtures thereof.<br>
The water-isopropanol mixed solvate according to the invention is particularly useful for the preparation, of olanzapine form I in a high purity.<br>
Thus, the invention also relates -. to a process for the preparation of form I olanzapine, wherein the isopropanol/water mixed solvate of olanzapine according to the  invention is used.<br>
Form I of olanzapine is rather difficult to be prepared in substantially pure form, because formation of the thermodynamically more stable form II is favoured. According to. the process of the present  invention pure form I could be obtained which is in particular substantially free from form II and solvates.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process, in a step (a) the isopr-opanol/water mixed solvate is converted to a methylene chloride solvate of olanzapine, and in a step (b) the methylene chloride solvate is converted to form I olanzapine.<br>
It is advantageous if in step (a) a solution of the isopropanol/water mixed solvate in methylene chloride is<br><br>
prepared, the solvent is partly evaporated and the remaining solution is cooled.<br>
It is also preferred if in step (a) a solution of the isopropanol/water mixed solvate in methylene chloride is prepared, a drying agent is added to the solution, the drying agent is removed from the mixture rand the methylene chloride solvate of olanzapine is recovered. Preferably, the mixture is stirred for some time and filtered, and finally, the product is recovered, e. g. by crystallization after cooling. A particularly useful drying agent is anhydrous CaSCU.<br>
In a further process for effecting step (a) , the- water-isopropanol mixed solvate according to the invention is suspended in methylene chloride and the suspension is heated until a clear solution is obtained. Then a part of the solvent is evaporated under vacuum or optionally at atmospheric pressure or a combination thereof at temperatures ranging from the boiling point of the solution to -30°C to precipitate olanzapine methylene chloride solvate, which can be isolated by filtration. Alternatively, the heated solution can be cooled to temperatures frorrT room temperature to -30 °C to precipitate the olanzapine methylene chloride solvate.<br>
In another typical process for effecting step (a), the water-isopropanol mixed solvate is suspended in methylene chloride and the suspension is heated to 35 °C to obtain a clear solution. Subsequently, a drying agent, preferably Drierite (CaSO4 anhydrous), is added, and the desired product is recovered in conventional manner.<br>
Optionally, a seeding with higher amounts of crystalline methylene chloride solvate is effected. Also olanzapine form   I is a suitable seeding material.<br><br>
It is preferred to use as methylene chloride	solvate in step<br>
(b) the methylene chloride hemisolvate. For	its preparation<br>
it is "usually necessary to dry the product	in a vacuum at<br>
room temperature for 2 to 12 hours.<br>
In a typical and preferred process for effecting step (b) , isopropanol is added to the prepared olanzapine methylene chloride solvate in a volume (1) by weight (kg) ratio of 5:1 to 2:1, preferably 3:1 to 2:1, and the obtained suspension is stirred at a temperature of 15°C to 35°C, in particular at room temperature, for 15 to 90 min; preferably from 30 to 60 min. Preferably, seeding with form I olanzapine can be used. The filtered product is dried under vacuum at a temperature from room temperature to 50 °C until a constant weight is achieved.<br>
In another typical and preferred process for effecting step (b) , methylene chloride solvate is suspended in isopropanol at  a weight  (kg)  by volume  (1)  ratio  of 1:30 to  1:2, preferably 1:15 to 1:3, which has been presaturated with olanzapine.  The  obtained  suspension  is  stirred  at  a temperature  of  5°C  to  50°C,  in  particular  at  room temperature, for 15 to 90 min, preferably from 30 to 60 min. The product is filtered off and dried under vacuum at room temperature to a constant weight, and then at 50 °C to a constant weight. Form I olanzapine is isolated.<br>
In another typical and preferred process .for effecting step (b), methylene chloride solvate is first dried under vacuum at a temperature of 30 to 55°C .for 6 to 3 6 hours. The obtained product is suspended in isopropanol at a weight (kg) by volume (1) ratio of 1:5 to 1:2, preferably 1:3 to 1:2, The obtained .suspension is stirred at a" temperature of 15°C to 35°C, in particular at room temperature, for 15 to 60 min,<br><br>
preferably from 15 to 30 min. The product is filtered off and dried under vacuum at room temperature to a constant weight, and then at 50°C to a constant weight. This process offers the advantage that it very much diminishes the possibility of formation of the undesired form II of olanzapine.<br>
In  another preferred embodiment of  the	process  for "the<br>
preparation of form I olansapine,  solid	isopropanol/water<br>
mixed solvate of olanzapine according 'to	the invention is<br>
mixed with solid olanzapine of form. I and	the particle size<br>
of the mixture is reduced.    <br>
Preferably the mixing and the sizp-reduction take place in a single step by for example grinding or milling the mixture. Grinding can take place in a mortar and for milling usual milling machines can be .used.<br>
The mixture preferably comprises up to 10% and in particular up to 5% by weight of form I olanzapine.<br>
The obtained material is usually dried to give the desired form I olanzapine. The drying is preferably conducted in a vacuum drier at temperatures ranging from room temperature to' 80°C,  preferably from room' temperature to  60°C and most preferred from 40 to 50°C.<br>
It is also	preferred to process the dried material further	by<br>
suspending  it  in  isopropanol,  separating  the  solid	by<br>
filtration	and drying of the solid. The dried material	is<br>
preferably	suspended in isopropanol in a weight  (kg)	to<br>
volume (1)	ratio of 1:5 to 1:2, in particular 1:3 to 1:2. The<br>
suspension	is preferably stirred • at a temperature of 15	to<br>
35°C, in particular at room temperature, for 15 to 60. min,	in<br>
particular	15 to 30 min.<br><br>
The drying is preferably conducted under vacuum at room temperature to a constant weight and then at 50 °C to a constant weight.<br>
This simple process unexpectedly results in very high yields of form I olanzapine having a high polymorphic purity.<br>
Further, the invention also relates to a process for the preparation of any other solvate or hydrate forms of olanzapine, or - mixtures ' thereof, wherein the isopropanol/water mixed solvate of olanzapine according to the indention is used.<br>
Moreover, the invention also relates to a process for the preparation of anhydrous forms of olanzapine, wherein the isopropanol/water mixed solvate of olanzapine according to the invention is used.<br>
It has also surprisingly been found out that in the process of preparing form I olanzapine the purity of the final product can be influenced by the type of the materials which come into contact with the liquid media from which precursors or the final product is crystallized or precipitated. This has in particular been observed when using elevated temperatures in the process.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a process for preparing form I olanzapine wherein at least one of (a) precursors for olanzapine form'I and (b) olanzapine form I. is crystallized or precipitated from a liquid medium which medium, is present in a container wherein the surfaces of the container contacting the medium are comprising at least one polymer,-'preferably are consisting of at least one polymer.<br><br>
It was unexpectedly found out -that such polymer surfaces in particular diminish the likelihood of formation of the undesired form II of olanzapine, especially when using elevated temperatures. This is very beneficial since the form II is an impurity which is very difficult to be removed, if possible at all, and even small amounts thereof may function as seeding crystals /which lead to formation of further amounts of the undesired form II olanzapine.<br>
It is preferred that the precursors and/or the olanzapine form I are prepared using the isopropanol/water mixed solvate according to the invention. This leads to highly pure olanzapine form I.<br>
The liquid medium can be a solution or dispersion which upon crystallization or precipitation leads to form I olanzapine or a precursor of form I olanzapine.<br>
Preferably, at least one crystallization or precipitation step of a precursor is carried out such that the liquid medium is contacting the mentioned polymer surface. It is particularly preferred that such a precursor is the methylene chloride hemisolvate of olanzapine. It was found out that in particular in the crystallization or precipitation of the methylene chloride hemisolvate the likelihood of formation of the undesired form II olanzapine is diminished if carried in contact with the polymer surfaces.<br>
In an even further preferred embodiment, the methylene<br>
chloride hemisolvate has been prepared- by using the very pure<br>
isopropanol/water mixed solvate according to the invention.<br>
This accomplishes the preparation of very pure olanzapine of<br>
form I.	<br><br>
The container can be any equipment, like a vessel or reactor, wherein a crystallization or precipitation occurs.<br>
It  has  been  proven  particularly  useful  if  the  polymer contains  fluorine.  Preferred  examples  are  selected  from polytetrafluoroethylene,  e-g  available  under  the  brand Teflon, fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer, perfluoro . alkoxy polymer, or ethylene terafluoroethylene copolymer.<br>
It is possible that only the surfaces contacting the liquid medium are comprising polymer or are consisting of polymer, but  typically  the  whole  container  is  made  of  polymer, preferably made of polytetrafluoroethylene..<br>
The invention is in the following illustrated by means of examples.<br>
