				<td>FUEL CELL REACTANT FLOW FIELDS THAT MAXIMIZE PLANFORM<br>
UTILIZATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to fuel cell flow fields that have transverse portions so<br>
as to clear internal manifold holes or an external inlet for an external fluid manifold,<br>
having extra grooves in the transverse portion of the flow field, thereby to provide<br>
flow field over a maximal amount of the fuel cell planform.<br>
Background Art<br>
Reactant gas and oxidant gas flow fields in modern fuel cells comprise<br>
channels consisting of grooves machined or otherwise formed in the surface of one<br>
side of a bipolar plate, metal/or carbonaceous plate, variously called a reactant gas<br>
flow field plate, or water transport plate (if it is porous and separates water flow from<br>
reactant gas flow by means of bubble pressure). The planform of the cells is typically<br>
rectangular, with about a two-to-one aspect ratio. The active fuel cell area, where the<br>
fuel reacts with the oxidant at an electrolyte, can exist only where the opposing<br>
reactant flow fields are in each other's shadow, on opposite sides of the electrolyte.<br>
The unproductive areas are not only created as a result of the shape of the flow field<br>
on one reactant gas plate, but additional unproductive areas are created by the shape<br>
of flow field on the other reactant flow field plate.<br>
To provide internal manifolds, such as to convey coolant into and out of the<br>
cells, each plate has a hole which aligns with similar holes in adjacent plates. In fuel<br>
cells with only external inlet/outlet manifolds, porting is required to separate the inlet<br>
flow from the outlet flow. The porting areas, holes, and surrounding plate material<br>
required to seal internal manifolds from reactant gas flow fields, occupy space that<br>
otherwise would contain grooves.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1, as long as the length, L, of the flow field minus the<br>
lengths, S, of any internal manifold seal areas 16 is the same as the width, W, of the<br>
flow field, then the entire available planform of the reactant gas flow field plate 20 is<br>
productively utilized.<br>
However, as seen in Fig. 2, when the length, L', of the flow field minus the<br>
lengths, S, of any manifold seal areas, is different from the width, then there<br>
inherently is a non-productive area 21 of the planform.<br>
Consider matching a fuel flow field plate 22 of the type illustrated in Fig. 3<br>
with a similarly arranged, but orthogonally flowing oxidant flow fuel plate 23 as<br>
shown in Fig. 4. The active area would be limited, as illustrated in Fig. 5, to a<br>
parallelogram 25 which encompasses both the fuel reactant gas channels in the fuel<br>
reactant gas flow field plate of Fig. 3 and the oxidant reactant gas channels in the<br>
oxidant reactant gas flow field plate of Fig. 4.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Objects of the invention include: maximizing the useful (active) portion of<br>
the planform of a fuel cell having internal manifolds; providing reactant flow fields,<br>
the flow inlet edges of which are offset from the flow outlet edges thereof in order to<br>
provide space for internal manifold holes and external manifold porting, which<br>
nonetheless do not leave unnecessarily unusable portions of the planform as a result<br>
of the offset; and provision of reactant gas flow fields which permit having an active<br>
area that includes all of the planform not required for internal manifolds, porting, or<br>
seals.<br>
This invention is predicated on my discovery that fuel cell reactant gas flow<br>
field plates having inlets offset from outlets will have little waste (inactive) area if the<br>
transverse channels have as many grooves per channel as the aspect ratio between the<br>
length/width of the transverse flow field area to the width/length of the transverse<br>
flow field area.<br>
According to the present invention, in a fuel cell reactant gas flow field plate<br>
having channels with inlets which are offset from the outlets of such channels by<br>
means of transverse channels, the ratio of the number of transverse grooves per<br>
channel is on the order of the aspect ratio of the transverse area; that is, the ratio of the<br>
length to the width or the ratio of the width to the length, whichever is greater.<br>
Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more apparent in the light of the following detailed description of exemplary<br>
embodiments thereof, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is a simplified top plan view of a fuel cell fuel reactant gas flow field<br>
plate having flow channels with inlets which are offset from their outlets, in which the<br>
aspect ratio of the transverse flow field area is unity (the width is equal to the length)<br>
and in which the width of the flow field W is equal to the flow field minus the lengths<br>
of any internal seal areas, which might be known to the prior art.<br>
Fig. 2 is similar to Fig. 1 but the length of the flow field minus the lengths of<br>
the internal manifold seal areas is much greater than the width of the flow field,<br>
resulting in non-productive area.<br>
Fig. 3 is similar to Fig. 2 but with straight flow fields set at an angle<br>
compared to the edge of the flow field, which might be known to the prior art.<br>
Fig. 4 is similar to Fig. 3 but showing flow fields transverse to those of Fig.<br>
3, to provide a flow field plate which could be used in conjunction with the flow field<br>
plate of Fig. 3 to form a fuel cell.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the limited productive area of a fuel cell formed utilizing the<br>
plates of Figs. 3 and 4 on opposite sides of an electrolyte, which might be known to<br>
the prior art.<br>
Fig. 6 is a top plan view of a reactant gas flow field plate having flow<br>
channels with inlets offset from their outlets and employing the present invention so<br>
as to maximize productive area of the plate.<br>
Fig. 7 is a fragmentary exploded view of the flow field of Fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 8 is a top plan view of an oxidant reactant flow field plate having a<br>
general flow direction transverse to the flow direction of the flow field plate of Fig. 6,<br>
employing the present invention, so as to avoid wasting any of the planform.<br>
Fig. 9 is a fragmentary exploded view of a portion of Fig. 8.<br>
Fig. 10 is a fragmentary top plan view of the invention being practiced in an<br>
interdigitated reactant gas flow field plate.<br>
Fig. 11 is a top plan view of a reactant gas flow field plate having inlet and<br>
outlet flow fields separated by porting areas.<br>
Mode(s) for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Referring to Figs. 6 and 7, a reactant gas flow field plate 53 has seal areas 54<br>
along edges and seal areas 55, 56 surrounding internal manifold holes 57, 58. The<br>
flow field plate has an inlet end 61 and an outlet end 62. Reactant gas is provided<br>
from a pipe 64 through an inlet manifold 65 and is passed from the flow field through<br>
an exit manifold 66 to an exhaust and/or recycle pipe 67.<br>
The inlet ends 61 of the fuel channels 71 are offset from the outlet ends 62 of<br>
the fuel channels 71. The offset is created by transverse portions 73 which together<br>
make up a parallelogram-shaped flow field transverse area 74. The transverse<br>
channels 73 may have either one groove 77 or two grooves 78, 79, The ratio of the<br>
number of grooves 77-79 to the number of transverse channels 73 is on the order of<br>
the aspect ratio of the reactant gas flow field transverse area 74. In the embodiment<br>
of Fig. 6, the ratio of the length, L, of the transverse area 74 (from right to left in Fig.<br>
6) to the width, W, of the transverse area 74 (from the top to the bottom as shown in<br>
Fig. 6) is about 1.4. In the embodiment of Fig. 6, there are approximately 16 grooves<br>
77-79 per 11 transverse channels 73, which is a ratio of grooves to channels of 1.4.<br>
Thus, the ratio of transverse grooves to transverse channels in the embodiment of<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 is about the same as the aspect ratio of the transverse area 74.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, a flow field plate 82 has two separate flow fields 83, 84,<br>
each of which is within the purview of the invention, and only one of which will be<br>
discussed.<br>
A reactant gas inlet manifold would be at either the top or bottom (as seen in<br>
Fig. 8) of the flow field plate 82, and a reactant gas outlet manifold would be at either<br>
the bottom or the top of the flow field plate 82. Or, there may be an inlet/outlet<br>
manifold at the top or bottom and a turn manifold at the bottom or top. These have<br>
been omitted in Fig. 8 for clarity.<br>
In Fig. 8, there are seal areas 86 along the edges of the flow field plate, and<br>
seal areas 87, 88 around internal manifold holes 89,90. In Fig. 8, there are two areas<br>
93, 94 which do not have reactant gas flow field channels thereon; however, when<br>
these are placed on opposite sides of an electrolyte with a flow field plate similar to<br>
Fig. 6, the areas 93, 94 will substantially overlay the seal areas 54 of the opposite<br>
plate (e.g., Fig. 6), which areas are not active anyway. Therefore, the areas 93 and 94<br>
in Fig. 8 are not wasted.<br>
In Fig. 8, the inlet (or outlet) ends 97 of the flow channels 98 are offset from<br>
the other ends 99 thereof by means of transverse portions 100 of the flow channels.<br>
In Fig. 9, the transverse portions 100 of the flow channels may have either one groove<br>
101 or two grooves 103, 104. In Figs. 8 and 9, there are five grooves for each four<br>
transverse channel portions, giving a ratio of 1.25. In Fig. 8, the ratio of the length, L,<br>
of the transverse area 107 (from top to bottom) is about 1.24 times the width, W, of<br>
the reactant gas flow field transverse area 107 (from right to left in Fig. 8). Thus, the<br>
ratio of grooves to transverse channels is about the same as the aspect ratio of the<br>
transverse area 107.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, an interdigitated reactant gas flow field plate 104 has a<br>
plurality of inlet grooves 105, which are open at the inlet end to receive gas, but are<br>
blocked at the outlet end. The plate 104 also has a plurality of outlet grooves 106,<br>
from which the gas can freely flow at the outlet, but which are blocked at the inlet.<br>
As is known, this forces the gas to pass into the bulk of the plate material in order to<br>
advance from the inlet to the outlet, thus providing an increased capacity for the gas to<br>
react at the catalyst.<br>
In Fig. 10, some of the inlet channels, such as channel 109, have only one<br>
groove in the transverse portion thereof. But, some of the inlet channels such as the<br>
inlet channel 110 have two transverse grooves 111,112 therein. Similarly, some of<br>
the outlet channels, such as the channel 115 have only a single transverse groove,<br>
while some of the outlet channels, such as the outlet channel 116 have two grooves<br>
117,118 in the transverse channel. As in the other embodiments, the ratio of the total<br>
number of grooves in the transverse channels to the number of transverse channels is<br>
on the order of the aspect ratio of the reactant gas flow Meld transverse area 121.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates a flow field plate 129 having areas 130 which separate<br>
inlet flow fields 131 from outlet flow fields 132. There are six grooves per five<br>
transverse channels 135 (6/5 = 1.2) and the aspect ratio is about 1.22.<br>
The invention may be used in flow field plates in which the grooves are of<br>
uniform or variable width and are of uniform or variable depth.<br>
Thus, although the invention has been shown and described with respect to<br>
exemplary embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that the foregoing and various other changes, omissions and additions may be made<br>
therein and thereto, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
