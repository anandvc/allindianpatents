				<td>MICROCELLULAR POULYURETHANE SHOE SOLES BLOWN WITH WATER AND AUXILIARY COMPOUNDS<br>
<br>
This application claims benefit of United States Provisional Application No. 60/874.306, filed 12 December 2006. <br>
<br>
This invention relates to methods for producing microcellular polyurethanes, particularly shoe soles.<br>
<br>
Microcellular   shoe   soles   are   produced   by   forming  a   polyurethane-forming<br>
reaction mixture that includes at least one blowing agent, and introducing the mixture<br>
into a mold where it expands and cures into the shape of the shoe sole.   It is common,<br>
particularly  in   Europe,   to produce   microcellular   polyurethane   shoe   soles  using  a<br>
mixture of HFC-134a and water as the blowing agent   However, the use of HFC-i34a<br>
in shoe sole applications is being regulated more strictly, particularly in Europe, and a<br>
change to an alternative blowing agent is becoming necessary.	<br>
<br>
A potential alternative blowing agent is a high hydrocarbon, but these materials tend to be highly flammable and thus raise a number of safety and exposure concerns. Water, which reacts with a polyisocyanate to generate carbon dioxide, is another potential substitute blowing agent. The carbon dioxide forms gas bubbles which expand the polyurethane to form the desired cellular structure. Water is used in many polyurethanes applications as a blowing agent.<br>
<br>
After the shoe sole cures and is subsequently cooled (either within the mold or after being demolded). a certain amount of linear shrinkage will occur. For HFC-134a and HFC-134a/water-based formulations, the extent to which this shrinkage occurs is generally repeatable and predictable. Shoe sole molds are constructed a bit larger than the size of the final shoe sole will be, in order to take this shrinkage into account. Typically, this linear shrinkage is in the range of from 0.8 to 1.5%; and is most often from about 1 to 1.25%.<br>
<br>
It has been found that when water is used to replace HFC-l34a as the blowing agent in microcellular  shoe sole applications, the linear shrinkage is reduced significantly. The bnear shrinkage also appears to be sensitive to changes in isocyanate index (the ratio of isocyanate groups to isocyanate-reactive groups in the system).<br>
<br>
Small differences in linear shrinkage have a very substantial impact on shoe sole manufacturers.   Shoes are often made to close tolerances to provide a proper fit and to <br>
match the sole correctly with uppers and other components. The difference in shrinkage characteristics between HFC-134a-blown and water-blown systems is great enough that molds which are used for the HFC-134a systems often cannot be used with the water-blown systems. This represents a potentially large expense to shoe manufacturers for producing new molds for use with the new water-blown systems. Shoe manufacturers want to avoid this expense, and for that reason strongly desire an alternative microcellular polyurethane system that has shrinkage characteristics very close to those of the HFC-134a systems.<br>
<br>
This invention is a process for preparing an integral skin microcellular polyurethane elastomer, comprising<br>
<br>
a)	forming a reactive mixture containing at least<br>
<br>
1)	a high molecular weight polyol or mixture thereof, the polyol br mixture thereof having an average functionality of from 1.8 to 3 hydroxyl groups per molecule and an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 400 to 6000;<br>
<br>
2)	at least one chain extender;<br>
<br>
3)	at least one polyisocyanate;<br>
<br>
4)	from about 0.1 to about 1 part of water per 100 parts by weight of component 1); and<br>
<br>
5)	from about 0.5 to about 5 parts of one or more of the following auxiliaries:<br>
<br>
5-a) methylal<br>
5-b) 1,2-trans-dichloroethene <br>
5-c) dioxolane <br>
5-d) tertiary butanol <br>
5-e) propyl propionate, and<br>
5-f) one or more hydrocarbons having a boiling point of from 100 and 250ºC and<br>
a fash point above 30°C;	<br>
<br>
b)	curing the reactive mixture in a closed mold to form an integral skin microcellular<br>
polyurethane elastomer.<br>
<br>
The resulting microcellular polyurethane often exhibits a linear shrinkage in the range of from 0.8 to 1.5%, and is most often from about 1 to 1.25%. when foam density is from about 400 to 700 kg/m3. Linear shrinkage is measured by storing the demolded part for 24 hours at room temperature (~23°C) and -50% humidity, and comparing its length (longest dimension) with the longest dimension of the mold. Linear shrinkage values are expressed in relation to the longest dimension of the mold.<br>
 <br>
The invention is also a formulated polyol composition comprising a blend of components 1-5 above. The formulated polyol composition has a. further advantage of having low flamrability. In many cases, the formulated polyol composition has a flash point higher than 65°C, and is therefore rated as non-flammable according to ISO 1523, despite the presence of the auxiliary. This is a significant advantage, as other possible approaches, such as the use of light hydrocarbons as blowing agents, result in polyol formulations having low flash points and therefore can represent significant fire risks.<br>
<br>
The polyol component contains one or more high equivalent weight polyols. By<br>
"high equivalent weight polyol", it is meant a polyol having an atomic mass of from 400<br>
to 6000 times the total number of hydroxyl groups on the polyol molecule. The high<br>
equivalent weight polyol contains an average of from 1.8 to 3.0 hydroxyl groups per<br>
molecule. Preferred high equivalent weight polyols have an average equivalent weight<br>
of from about GOO to Z800 and an average functionality of from 2.0 to 3.0. Especially<br>
preferred high equivalent weight polyols have an average equivalent weight of from 800<br>
to 1500 and an average functionality of from 2.0 to 3.0.	<br>
<br>
Suitable high equivalent weight polyols include polyether polyols and polyester polyols. The high equivalent weight polyol may be derived from an animal fat or vegetable oil.<br>
<br>
Suitable polyether polyols include, for example, polymers of propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, 1,2-butylene oxide, tert a methylene oxide, block and/or random copolymers thereof, and the like. Of particular interest are poiy(propylene oxide) homopolymers, random copolymers of propylene oxide and ethyleneloxide in which the poly(ethylene oxide) content is, for example, from about 1 to about 30% by weight, ethylene oxide-capped poly(propyIene oxide) polymers and ethylene oxide-capped random copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide. The polyether polyols may be one that contains only low amounts of terminal unsaturation (for example, less than 0.02 meq/g or less than 0.01 meq/g), such as those made using so-called double metal cyanide. (DMC) catalysts, as described for example in US Patent Nos. 3,278,457, 3.278,458, 3,278,459, 3,404,109, 3.427,256, 3,427.334, 3,427,335, 5,470.813 and 5.627,120. Polyester polyols typically contain about 2 hydroxyl groups per molecule and have an equivalent weight per hydroxyl group of from 400 to 1500.<br>
<br>
Polymer polyols of various sorts may be used as well. Polymer polyols include dispersions of polymer particles, such as polyurea, polyurethane-urea, polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile and polystyrene-co-acrylonitrile polymer particles, in a polyol, typically<br>
a polyether polyol. Suitable polymer polyols are described in US Patent N'os. 4,581,418 and 4,574,137. It is generally preferred that at least a portion of the high equivalent weight polyol(s) is one or more polymer polyols.<br>
<br>
A variety of polyols which are derived from animal fats or vegetable oils especially can be used as the high equivalent weight polyol. Among those are transesterified "blown" vegetable oils as described in US Published Patent Applications 2002/0121328, 2002/0119321 and 2002/0090488. A more preferred type of vegetable oil-derived polyols is a hydroxy methyl-containing polyester polyol such as is described in WO 04/096882 and WO 04/096883.<br>
<br>
The reactive mixture contains at least one chain extender. For the purposes of this invention, a chain extender is a material having two isocyanate-reactive groups per molecule and an equivalent weight per isocyanate-reactive group of less than 400, especially from 31 to 125. The isocyanate reactive groups are preferably hydroxyl, primary aliphatic or aromatic amine or secondary aliphatic or aroriiatic amine groups. Representative chain extenders include, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, ethylene diamine, phenylene diamine. bis(3-chloro-4-aminophenyl)methane and 2.4-diamino-3,5-dieth3'l toluene. The hydroxyt-functional chain extenders are preferred. 1,4-butane diol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and tripropylene glycol are especially preferred.<br>
<br>
The   organic   polyisocyanate   may   be   a   polymeric   polyisocyanate,   aromatic isocyanate,      cycloaliphatic      isocyanate,      or      aliphatic      isocyanate.      Exemplary polyisocyanates include m-phenylene diisocyanate, toluene-2,4-diisocyanate,  toluene 2.6-diisocyanate.     hexamethylene-1.6-diisocyanate.     tetramethylene-l,4-diisocyanate cyclohexane-l,4-diisocyanate,      hexahydrotoluene      diisocyanate,      naphthylene-1,5 diisocyanate, methoxyphenyl-2,4-diisocyanate, diphenyimethane.4,4'-diisocyanate, 4.4' biphenylene diisocyanate, 3.3'-dimethoxy-4,4"-biphenyl diisocyanate, 3,3'-dimethyl-4-4' biphenyl     diisocyanate,     3,3'-dimethyldiphenyl     methane-4,4'-diisocyanate,     4,4',4" triphenyl methane triisocyanate, a polymethylene polyphenyiisocyanate (PMDI), 4,4 and/or 2,4'-methylenediphenyldiisocyanate (MDI), toluene-2,4,6-tri]L|socyanate   and 4,4 dimethyldiphenylmethane-2,2',5,5'-tetraisocyanate.<br>
<br>
A preferred type of polyisocyanate is a prepolymer or quasi-prepolymer prepared by reacting an isocyanate compound as just described with one or more isocyanate-reactive materials, to form a mixture of isocyanate-terminated having an average -NCO content of from  15 to 25%, especially from  18 to 23% by weight.    The isocyanate functionality of the prepolymer is preferably from about 2.0 to 3.0, especially from 2.1 to about 2,6 isocyanate groups/molecule. The isocyanate-reactive materials used to make the prepolymer or quasi-prepolymer is preferably one or more high equivalent weight polyols as described before, optionally in combination wnth one or more chain extenders and/or crosslinkers. The preferred polyisocyanate quasi-prepolymer is prepared from MDl or a PMDI, one or more high equivalent weight poly.ether polyols and optionally an hydroxyl-terminated chain extender such as l,4^butanediol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and tripropylene glycol (or mixture of two or more thereof).<br>
<br>
The reactive mixture contains water. Water can be used as the sole blowing agent.<br>
<br>
The reaction mixture further contains one or more of the following auxiliaries: methylal (dimethoxymethane), 1,2-trans-dichloroethene, 1,3-dioxolane, t-butanol, propyl propionate, or one or more hydrocarbons having a boiling point of from 100 and 250°C and a flash point above 50 ºC. The hydrocarbon may be aromatic or aliphatic, and if aUphatic, branched, Unear or cyclic. Aliphatic hydrocarbons may be unsaturated. A suitable hydrocarbon mixture is commercially available from Exxon Mobil Chemicals as Isopar G.<br>
<br>
Preferred auxiliary compounds are methylal and 1,2-trans-dichloroethene, as these materials produce microcellular  polyurethanes having low odor. 1,2-trans-dichloroethene is more preferred than methylal, as polyol mixtures containing effective amounts of 1,2-trans dichloroethene tend to be less flammable than those containing effective amounts of methylal.<br>
<br>
One or more catalysts are preferably present in the reactive mixture. A wide variety of materials are known to catalyze polyurethane forming reactions, including tertiary amines, tertiary phosphines, various metal chelates, acid' metal salts, strong bases, various metal alcoholates and phenolates and metal salts of organic acids. Catalysts of most importance are organotin catalysts and tertiary amine catalysts, which can be used singly or in some combination. It is usually preferred to use a combination of at least one "gelling" catalyst, which strongly promotes the reaction between an alcohol group with an isocyanate, and at least one "blowing" catalyst, which strongly promotes the reaction of an isocyanate group with a water molecule.<br>
<br>
Examples of suitable organotin catalysts are stannic chloride, stannous chloride, stannous    octoate,    stannous   oleate,    dimethyltin    diJaurate,    dibutyltin    dilaurate, dibutyltin dioctoate, other organotin compounds of the formula SnRn(OR)4.n, wherein R is alkyl or aryl and n is from 0 to 2, mercaptotin catalysts, and the like.<br>
<br>
Examples of tertiary amine catalysts include: trimethylamine, triethylamine. N-<br>
methylmorpholine,	N-ethylmorpholine,	N,N-dimethylben2ylamine,	N.N-<br>
dimethylethanolamine,	N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1.4-butanediamine,	N.N-<br>
dimethylpiperazine, . l,4-diazobicyclo-2,2,2-octane, bis(djmethylaminoethyl)ether, triethylenediamine and dimethylalkylamines where the allcyl group contains from 4 to 18 carbon atoms. Mixtures of these tertiary amine catalysts can be used. Examples of suitable commercially available amine catalysts include Niax ™  Al (bis(dimethylaminoethyl)ether in propylene glycol available from GE OSi Sihcones), Niax"*" B9 (N,N-dimethylpiperazine and N-N-dimethylhexadecylamine in a polyalkylene oxide polyol, available from GE OSi Silicones), Dabco™ 8264 (a mixture of bis(dimethylaminoethvl)ether, triethylenediamine and dimethvlhvd'roxyethvl amine in<br>
it dipropylene glycol, available from Air Products and Chemicals), Dabco™ 33S(triethylene diamine in 1,4-butanediol, available from Air Products and Chemicals), and Dabco 33LV (triethylene diamine in dipropylene glycol, available from Air Products and Chemicals), Niax™ A-400 (a proprietary tertiary amine/carboxylic salt and bis (2-dimethylaminoethy)ether in water and a proprietary hydroxyl compound, available from GE OSi Silicones); Niax ™  A-300 (a proprietary tertiary amine/carboxylic salt and triethylenediamine in water, available from GE OSi Specialties Co.); Polycat™  58 (a proprietary amine catalyst available from Air Products and Chemicals), Polycat ™  5 (pentamethyl diethylene triamine, available from Air Products and Chemicals) and Polycat ™  8 (N,N-dimethyl cyclohexylamine, available from Air Products and Chemicals).<br>
<br>
The foam formulation may contain one or more crosslinkers in addition to the high equivalent weight polyols and chain extenders described above. For purposes of this invention "crosslinkers" are materials having three or more isocyanate-reactive groups per molecule and an equivalent weight per isoc3'anate-reactive group of less than 400. Crosslinkers preferably contain from 3 to 8. especially from 3 to 4 hydroxyl, primary amine or secondary amine groups per molecule and have an equivalent weight of from 30 to about 200, especially from 50 to 125. Examples of suitable crosslinkers include diethanol amine, monoethanol amine, triethanol amine, mono- di- or tri(isopropanol) amine, glycerine, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, and the like.<br>
 <br>
In addition to the foregoing components, the foam formulation may contain various other optional ingredients such as surfactants, cell openers; fillers such as calcium carbonate; pigments and/or colorants such as titanium dioxidde, iron oxide, chromium oxide, azo/diazo dyes, phthalocyanines, dioxazines and carbon black; reinforcing agents such as fiber glass, carbon fibers, flaked glass, mica, talc and the like; biocides; preservatives; antioxidants: flame retardants; and the like.<br>
<br>
The quantity of most components in the mixture is conveniently expressed in terms of parts by weight per 100 parts by weight high equivalent weight polyol(s). The amount of chain extender may range from about 1 to about 50 parts per weight per 100 parts by weight high equivalent weight polyol(s). A more preferred amount is from 5 to 20 parts by weight, and an even more preferred amount is from 5 to 15 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight high equivalent weight polyol(s). Crosslinkers, if used, may be present m an amount of up to 20 parts, preferably up to 10 parts and more preferably up to 5 parts per weight per 100 parts by weight high equivalent weight polyol(s).<br>
<br>
A surfactant is preferably also present in the reactive mixture. A wide variety of silicone surfactants can be used in making the foams of this invention. Examples of such silicone surfactants are commercially available under the tradenames Tegostab ™  (Th. Goldschmidt and Co.), Niax™ (GE OSi Silicones) and Dabco ™  (Air Products and Chemicals. The amount of surfactant used will vary somewhat according to the particular application and surfactant that is used, but in general wiU be between 0.02 and 1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight high equivalent weight polyol(s). A preferred amount is from 0.08 to 0.3 parts by weight surfactant perlJlOO parts by weight high equivalent weight polyol(s).<br>
<br>
Water is generally used in an amount of from about 0.35 to 1 part per 100 parts, preferably from about 0.4 to about 0.75 part and more preferably from 0.4 to 0.65 part by weight per 100 parts by weight high equivalent weight polyols. This amount is generally sufficient to produce a foam having a free rise density (i.e., the density of the foam that is formed when the reaction mixture is allowed to expand and cure against only atmospheric pressure) of from 150 to 350 g/L.<br>
<br>
The reaction mixture suitably contains from 1.0 to 10, especially from 1.5 to about 7.5, and more preferably from 1.5 to about 5 parts by weight of the auxiliary per 100 parts by weight of the high equivalent weight polyol(s).<br>
<br>
Organotin catalysts are typically used in small amounts, such as from 0.00l to 0.03 parts, preferably 0.05 to 0.015 parts, per 100 parts by weight high equivalent weight polyol(s). When used, tertiary amine catalysts are generally used in somewhat greater amounts, such as from 0.05 to about 5, especially from about 0,25 to about 2 parts per 100 parts by weight high equivalent weight polyol(s).<br>
<br>
The amount of polyisocyanate that is used is commonly expressed in terms of isocyanate index, i.e., 100 times the ratio of NCO groups to isocyanate-reactive groups in the reaction mixture including those provided by the water). The isocyanate index typically ranges from about 80 to 140. especially from about 90 to 120. For producing shoe soles, an especially preferred isocyanate index is from about 95 to 105.<br>
<br>
In general, the microcellular  foam is prepared by mixing the polyisocyanate and polyol composition in the presence of the water, auxiliary, surfactant, catalyst(s) and other optional ingredients as desired. The resulting reaction mixture is placed into a closed mold and subjected to conditions such that the polyisocyanate, water and polyol react to form a polyurethane and/or polyurea polymer while the water/isocyanate reaction generates carbon dioxide gas that expands the reacting mixture and reduces its density.<br>
<br>
It is generally preferred to pre-mix the high equivalent weight polyol(s), chain extender(s), water, auxiliary, catalyst(s) and other components if any (notably at least one surfactant) into a formulated polyol component. Despite the presence of the auxiliary, the formulated polyol component in many cases has a flash point of above 65°C and is rated as non-flammable according to the closed cup equilibrium method of ISO 1523.<br>
<br>
This formulated polyol component is then mixed with the polyisocyanate and the resulting mixture introduced into the mold. It is possible to bring the individual components individually, or in various admixtures, to a mixing head for mixing and dispensing.<br>
<br>
Enough of the reaction mixture is charged to the mold to produce a cured product having a foam density of from about 250 to about 750 kg/m^. A preferred foam density is from about 400 to about 700 kg/m3. A more preferred foam density is from 450 to 650 kg/m3. The foam density is preferably from about 1.5 to about 3.0, especially from about 2.0 to 2.7, times the free rise density of the foam formulation.<br>
<br>
The mold and/or the reactive mixture may be preheated if desired, but this is not required in all cases. The mold containing the reactive mixture may be heated after the reactive mixture is charged to the mold. If heating is used, a useful temperature is from 45 to 60ºC.<br>

After demolding, the parts are aged for 24 hours at 23ºC and 50% relative humidity. The length of the parts is then measured, and compared with the length of the mold. Results are as indicated in Table 4 below.<br>
<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1 is repeated, using the following formulation (Table 2), to form three microcellular elastomers having densities of 500, 550 and 650 kg/m3.<br>
<br>
Table 2<br>
<br>
1.8 See corresponding notes in Table 1.<br>
<br>
The resulting parts are tested for shrinkage as described in Example 1, with results as indicated in Table 4 below.<br>
<br>
Examples 3 and 4	<br>
Example 1 is again repeated, using the following formulation (Table 3), to form<br>
three microcellular elastomers having densities of 500. 550 and 650 kg/m3.<br>
<br>
Table 3		<br>
1.8 See notes 1-8 in Table 1<br>
<br>
The resulting elastomers are tested for shrinkage as described in Example 1, with results as indicated in Table 4. In Table 4, Comparative Sample A is a microcellular   elastomer   made   using   a   commercially   available   HFC-l34a-based.<br>
<br>
The reaction mixture is maintained in the mold until it cures sufficiently that it can be demolded without becoming permanently distorted or damaged.<br>
<br>
The invention is particularly suitable for producing microcellular shoe soles. Shoe soles made in accordance with the invention exhibit linear shrinkages that closely resemble those of microcellular polyurethane shoe soles that are made using HFC-134a as the blowing agent. This attribute is very significant to shoe sole manufacturers, who can continue to use molds designed for use with HFC-134a-containing formulations. This represents a significant cost savings. The linear shrinkage is typically from 0.8 to 1.5%, and is most often from about 1 to 1.25%, for a microcellular elastomer having a foam density of from 400 to 700 kg/m3, when measured according to the method described before.<br>
<br>
The shrinkage characteristics of microcellular elastomers produced in accordance with the invention tend to be only mildly sensitive to changes in isocyanate index. This is particularly the case over a range of isocyanate index from about 95 to about 110 when water is sole blowing agent.	<br>
<br>
Another advantage of the invention is that the microcellular elastomer often exhibits a more open-celled structure than what is seen in similar systems that use water as the sole blowing agent and do not contain the auxiliary. A microcellular elastomer made in accordance with the invention usually has a somewhat open-celled structure, similar to those made using HFC-134a as a blowing agent. The open-celled structure permits somewhat lower foam density (such as from 400-550 kg/m3) products to be prepared with good physical properties and shrinkage values similar to those seen with HFC-134a-blown microcellular elastomers.<br>
<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention, but are not intended to limit the scope thereof. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
<br>
Example 1<br>
A series of three microcellular polyurethanes at different densities are made in a 280-mm long "dog-bone" mold from the formulation described in Table 1:<br>
formulation.    Comparative Sample B is a water-blown microcellular elastomer made without the use of an auxiliary.<br>
<br>
	Table 4~	Shrinkage Test Results, % of original length	<br>
<br>
*Not an example of the invention.<br>
The data for Comparative Sample B illustrates the difference in shrinkage behavior that is seen when the blowing agent is changed from HFC-134a to water, Shrinkage is reduced quite significantly at all density values. When the auxiliary is present during the foaming reaction, shrinkages are restored nearly to the same values as for Comparative Sample A.    This is particularly true at the i500 and 550 kg/m3 densities, where the shrinkage behavior of Examples 1-4 is very similar to that of Comparative Sample A. At the higher 650 kg/m3 density, at which the water/no auxiliary formulation (Comparative Sample B) performs much differently than the HFC-134a formulation, the examples of the invention behave much more similarly to the control.<br>
<br>
Examples 5-9	.<br>
Microcellular elastomer examples 5-9 are made in the same general manner as described in Example 1, at a foam den.sit.y of 550 kg/m^. using the folJowing formulations.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
Table 5<br>
<br>
1'8See notes 1-8 of Table 1.<br>
<br>
Linear shrinkage is evaluated as described before for each of these microcelluiar elastomer parts, with results being as indicated in Table 6. Results for a control HFC-134a system (Comparative Sample C) and a water blown system (without any auxiliary) (Comparative Sample D) are included in Table 6 for comparison,<br>
<br>
Table 6		<br>
<br>
*Not an example of the invention.<br>
<br>
As before, the water-blown microcellular elastomers having the auxiliary present in the<br>
formulation exhibit shrinkages very similar to the HFC-134a/water blown control  Also<br>
as before, the water-blown elastomer made without the auxiliary exhibits substantially less shrinkage.<br>
