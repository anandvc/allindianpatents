				<td>The present invention relates to aromatic polyurethane polyols useful in coating compositions, and particularly useful in primers applied to metal substrates. More specifically, the present invention relates to aromatic pofyurethane polyols comprising the reaction product of diisocyanate, triisocyanates and idols wherein at least one of the isocyanates is aromatic. The resultant aromatic polyurethane polyols are low molecular weight oligomers (typically number average molecular weight (Mn)
These aromatic polyurethane polyols are prepared from a special doss of idols (a,p and/or any) in order to provide selectivity, and produce a polyurethane polyol having low molecular weight and relatively low viscosity.<br>
It should be noted that, as used herein, the term "polyurethane polyols" refers to a reaction product wherein the reactants (diol component and polyiisocyanate -component(s)) are linked substantially only via urethane linkage. This is in contrast to polyester-urethane and urethane-modified acrylic polyols, in which the reactants are linked via urethane as well as ester linkages.<br>
Currently, the automotive and the car refinish industry are using coating systems comprising primers, basecoats and clear coats in ever-increasing amounts. In such systems, generally a pigmented coating is applied over appropriate primers and the coating system is completed by applying an unlimited, dear topcoat over the pigmented basecoat. In some instances, pigmented monocoats are utilized. These coating compositions are generally supplied as "one-pack" or "two-pack" systems. In a typical one-pack system, all of the coating ingredients are combined into one storage stable mixture. Upon application the polyol component is crosslinked, generally with an aminoplast resin (such as a melamine resin) or a blocked isocyanate, under heat cure conditions of 120   or above. In a typical two-pack system, the polyol component is combined with a cross linking agent, generally an<br><br>
isocyanate, shortly before application, with curing being conducted at ambient or elevated temperatures up to 80 .<br>
To achieve acceptable solution viscosities (20-30 seconds, #4 Ford Cup at about 25 Â° C) for typical high solids coating systems, it is necessary that the film-forming polymer has a weight average molecular weight (Mw) lower than about 5,000. To achieve good film properties in such systems after crosslinking, it is also necessary that the number average molecular weight (Mn) should exceed about 800, and that each polymer should contain at least two reactive hydroxyl functional groups. These general principles apply to polyester polyols, acrylic polyols, and also to urethane polyols. In primer systems, the following properties are desirable, good adhesion, concoction resistance, and hardness. The use of urethane polyols (aliphatic) are generally cost prohibitive and seedily used in the primer systems. Durability of the complete coating system is mostly unaided by the topcoats. That's why epoxy primers are often used.<br>
However, epoxies typically have high molecular weights and, thus, high viscosities. As is evident from the above discussion, the requirements for acceptable solution viscosities and good film properties lead to contradictory molecular weight requirements since in low solution viscosities the Molecular weight should be low, but for good film properties the Molecular weight should be high.<br>
Many of the high performance, high solids automotive and car refinish coatings presently In use are based upon polymeric systems comprised of either epoxies (used extensively in primer systems) or polyester-based or polyacrylic-based polyols, We offer chemical and physical properties advantages over acrylics and polyesters such as excellent adhesion, improved hardness and excellent solvent resistance. We offer VOC advantages over high molecular weight epoxies,<br>
A considerable amount of work has been done related to coatings containing polyurethane polyols. One way to make polyurethane polyols is to react a<br><br>
diisocyanate or a multifunctional isocyanate with a significant stoichiometric excess of a diol After the reaction is complete, the excess of diol is removed. preferable by defilation. The obvious disadvantage of this method of making low molecular weight polyurethane polyols Is that the distillation of the diols is Inconvenient, not practical and cost prohibitive. U.S. Patents describing the production of polyurethane polyols by using stoichiometric excess of diols include: U.S. Patent 4,543,405 to Ambrose, et aL; issued September 24,1985; and U.S. Patent4,288,577 to McCabe, Jr., Issued Septembers, 1981.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,155,201 discloses polyurethane polyols comprising reaction products of n-functional polylsocyanates (n=2-5) and substantially monomeric diols having hydroxyl groups separated by 3 carbon atoms or less, and is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,175,227 discloses acid etch resistant coating compositions comprising polyurethane polyols and hydroxyl group-reactive cross linkers. The polyurethane polyols comprise reaction products of substantially monomeric asymmetric diols with hydroxyl groups separated by 3 carbon atoms or less and n functional polylsocyanates (n=2-5). This patent Is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Additionally, U.S. Patent No. 5,130,405 discloses add etch resistant coatings comprising (1) polyurethane polyols prepared from symmetric 1, 3-dioi components and polylsocyanates and (2) hydroxyl group-reactive crosslinking agents and is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
WO 96/40813 discloses a film fuming polyurethane polyol composition prepared from an n-functional Isocyanate with at least one diol or trial or mixtures thereof and a compound containing isocyanate-reactive functional groups preferably a mono functional alcohol or thiol and a method of preparing such polyurethane polyols. WO 96/40813 is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
In a number of the above described patents the polyurethane polyols are prepared from a,p and/or a diols and polyisocyanates. However, it has been established that polyurethane polyols prepared from a,p and/or a,y diols and aromatic triisocyanates alone have extremely high viscosities and cannot be used in low VOC coating compositions because high viscosity will result in high VOC.<br>
It would, therefore, be advantageous to provide an economical polyol suitable for use in high solids coatings, which not only possesses a desirable spectrum of properties but also is quite convenient to prepare. It has now been discovered that polyurethane polyols prepared from a,p and/or any diols and blends of triisocyanates   diisocyanate where at least one of the isocyanates is aromatic do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks.<br>
Primers made from these polyurethane polyols exhibit enhanced performance. They have unexpectedly demonstrated fast ambient cure, improved hardness, excellent solvent resistance and excellent adhesion to the substrate, even metal substrates, compared to the conventional primers typically used In the industry.<br>

Example 10<br>
The original primer was based on a binder system composed of a 90/10 blend of a commercially available polyester modified acrylic (Setalux 2152 available from Kazoo Nobel Resins inc,)/polyester. This primer composition also contained two catalysts. (A 10% solution of tri-ethylene thiamine in isopropyl alcohol and 18% zirconium in mineral spirits At 0.9 and 0.3 weight percent, respectively). To evaluate the aromatic polyurethane polyol, the polyester in this blend was replaced with the aromatic polyurethane polyol of EXAMPLE 1, No additional catalysts were added to the system (dibutyltin dilaurate is a catalyst added with Hardener one). The fully formulated paint was activated, separately, with two different hardeners; Hardener one contained a hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) based polyisocyanate ( a blurt)<br><br>
at 40 weight percent solids in butyl acetate with 0.005 weight percent of a 10% solution of dibutyltin dilaurate in an ester/aromatic solvent blend; and Hardener two containing a 60/40 blend of an HDI based/IPDI based polyisocyanate (isocyanurate) at 69 weight percent solids at a NCO:OH ratio of 1.05. Each sample was reduced with a ketone based solvent blend to achieve a ready to spray VOC of 479 lbs/gal (575 g/l).<br><br>

Non-sanding primer applications were crosslinked at 105% using Hardener one and reduced to 4.65 lbs/gal (558g/l) VOC using a ketone solvent blend. Sanding primer applications were crosslinked at 105% using Hardener three, a blend of two solvent free aliphatic HDI based polyisocyanates reduced to 42% weight solids with a conventional solvent blend, and reduced to 4.2 lb/gal (504 g/l) VOC using ketone sovent based reducer.
