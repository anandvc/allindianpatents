				<td>METHOD FOR DESIGNING CONTACT LENSES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to methods for designing contact lenses. In particular,<br>
the invention provides a method for designing contact lenses in which the thickness<br>
in the lens periphery is precisely controlled.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of contact lenses for purposes of visual acuity correction and<br>
cosmetics is well known. It is important in the design of a contact lens to provide<br>
for good handling, comfort, centration, and orientation of the lens. Each of these<br>
lens characteristics is dependent to a large extent on the thickness profile of the lens<br>
periphery.<br>
Conventional methods for controlling the thickness of the lens periphery<br>
include the use of one or more of lenticular zones, bevels, chamfers, and the like.<br>
However, these methods do not provide precise control of the thickness differential<br>
of the lens periphery. Additionally, these methods do not provide a means for<br>
designing a non-rotationally symmetric lens. Therefore, a need exists for a method<br>
for designing contact lenses that overcomes these disadvantages.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
**—■<br>
Fig. 1 is a depiction of a coarse mesh used in the method of the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is a graph of the thickness variations of several parallels of Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 3 is a depiction of intersection points of the mesh of Fig. 1 and a point<br>
falling between the parallels and meridians of that mesh.<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph for use in the method of the invention.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention provides a method, and lenses produced using the method, for<br>
designing articles, preferably ophthalmic lenses, in which the thickness of the<br>
periphery may be precisely controlled. Thus, the method provides for precise<br>
control of the thickness differential of the periphery and the location of the<br>
differential on the periphery. Finally, the method provides a ready means for<br>
designing non-rotationally symmetric articles.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method for designing an<br>
ophthalmic lens, the method comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of:<br>
a.) generating a thickness map for at least a portion of the periphery of the lens; and<br>
b.) deriving a geometry for at least a portion of the lens periphery from the thickness<br>
map. In another preferred embodiment, the invention provides an ophthalmic lens<br>
produced by this method.<br>
By "ophthalmic lens" is meant a spectacle lens, contact lens, intraocular lens,<br>
onlay lens, or the like. Preferably, the lens designed using the method of the<br>
invention is a contact lens. For purposes of the invention, by "lens periphery" or<br>
"periphery of the lens" is meant the portion of the lens that is outside of the optic<br>
zone.<br>
For the lens of the invention, the optical properties of its base curve and<br>
optical zones may be designed in any conventional manner. The base curve and<br>
optical curve may be described in any manner, as long as for a given diameter D on<br>
the base curve, the corresponding sag value S may be derived.<br><br>
In a preferred method, at least a portion of, and preferably all of, the lens<br>
periphery is first described using parallels and meridians, as shown in Fig. 1, to<br>
define a coarse mesh. The location of all of the intersecting points of the mesh are<br>
recorded as Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates and stored in arrays. The<br>
greater the number of points used, the greater will be the precision for controlling<br>
the lens periphery thickness.<br>
Further, the intersecting points are divided into at least three families of<br>
arrays: optic zone array points that are located at the innermost border of the<br>
periphery; exterior array points that are located at the outermost border of the<br>
periphery; and mid-array points that are located between the inner and outermost<br>
array points. In Fig. 1 is depicted representative members of each of these arrays.<br>
The thickness differential or, preferably, the thickness variation then is<br>
defined for each parallel of the mesh. Preferably, this is carried out by one of two<br>
methods. First, a set of functions may be used to define the thickness variation<br>
along each parallel. The variations may be a function of any or all of the Cartesian,<br>
cylindrical, and spherical functions. For example, the variation may be a function of<br>
the angle of rotation 6. Referring to Fig. 2, the lens thickness along three parallels is<br>
shown. The function may be of any form. Preferably, the function is selected so<br>
that it creates a smooth surface, provides the means for creating non-axisymmetric<br>
lenses with thin zones for better centering, and is reasonably easy to visualize.<br>
Suitable functions include, without limitation, functions of the following form<br>
Lens Thickness = A*Cos(θ) + B<br>
Lens Thickness = A*Cos(Bθ + C) + D, wherein A is the<br>
maximum thickness differential in each parallel and D is the thickness at 0 - 90°<br>
Lens Thickness = A*Cos2(B. θ + C) + D*Sin2(E.θ + C)<br><br>
Lens Thickness = A*|Cos(B. θ+C|+D, for θ = [0, Pi]<br>
Lens Thickness =A*(1+|Sinθ|), for θ = ]Pi, 2.Pi[<br>
The number of functions that need to be defined are equal to Nr, or the<br>
number of parallels. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that, in addition<br>
to trigonometric functions, any suitable function may be used including, without<br>
limitation, exponential, series, logarithmic, polynomial, step functions, and the like.<br>
Preferably, trigonometric functions are used and more preferably trigonometric<br>
functions are used in conjunction with step functions. Alternatively, the thickness<br>
variations may be defined manually at every point. In this method, the thickness of<br>
the lens at every point is specified. However, this method is disadvantageous<br>
because it is cumbersome. The resulting thickness for each intersection point, the<br>
number of points which equals Nr*Nθ wherein Nθ is the number of meridians, is<br>
calculated and recorded.<br>
In the second step of the method, a geometry of the lens periphery is derived<br>
from the thickness map. This step is carried out by first refining the coarse mesh to<br>
the desired accuracy in order to define the lens periphery more precisely. The<br>
refined, or fine, mesh describes the same lens geometry, but uses a greater number<br>
of points than does the coarse mesh. For example, referring to Fig. 1, the coarse<br>
mesh has Nr*N0 intersection points, or 60. In the fine mesh, there may be, for<br>
example, 3600 points. The precise number of points used will be determined by<br>
balancing the use of as many points as possible to obtain a better lens definition<br>
against the computation time and storage space required for the information along<br>
with the fact that the lathes used to cut the tools for the lens may not be able to cut<br>
with the level of accuracy necessary for a large number of points.<br>
The thickness and coordinates of the coarse mesh points are used to derive<br>
the thickness and z coordinates of the fine mesh points. For fine mesh points located<br><br>
on one of the parallels, the function corresponding to the parallel is used to derive<br>
the thickness of that point. For fine mesh points falling on one of the meridians, an<br>
approximation is used to derive the lens thickness. Suitable approximations may be<br>
made by selecting a function type and from that function type, deriving the curve<br>
that best fits the data points. Examples of useful function types include, without<br>
limitation, polynomial function, conic functions, exponential functions, rational<br>
functions, logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, and the like. Additionally<br>
and preferably, cubic spline approximations, or a series of special polynomials, may<br>
be used.<br>
In the case of a fine mesh point that falls between the meridians and<br>
parallels, adjacent points falling on the parallels and meridians may be used to<br>
determine the fine mesh point's properties. Referring to Fig. 3, points nl through n4<br>
are shown along with fine mesh point P. The distance between Nl through n4 to<br>
point P is dl, d2, d3, and d4, respectively. The thickness at point P may be<br>
calculated by any suitable method including, without limitation, the use of bilinear<br>
interpolation, bicubic interpolation, bicubic splines, and the like. A quick, but crude<br>
method is as follows:<br>
T(P) = (wl*T(nl) + w2*T(n2) + w3*T(n3) + w4*T(n4)<br>
wherein T is thickness and where SumD = dl + d2 + d3 + d4, and<br>
wl = [1-dl/SumD]/3<br>
w2 = [1-d2/SumD]/3<br>
w3 = [l-d3/SumD]/3<br>
w4 = [l-d4/SumD]/3<br>
Alternatively, a three-dimensional cubic spline approximation may be used<br>
to approximate the location of the fine mesh points. Three-dimensional cubic spline<br><br>
approximations and their use are described in Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77: The<br>
Art of Scientific Computing, Cambridge Press (1996)<br>
Once the thickness is calculated for all of fine mesh points, the z coordinates<br>
(or p for spherical coordinates) may be derived. Referring to Fig. 4, an example for<br>
a spherical base curve zone is shown. In Fig. 4, Pf(Zf, Rf) is the point on the front<br>
surface for which the z coordinate is to be derived, Rbc is the base curve radius, and<br>
(Zctr, Rctr) are the coordinates of the center of the base curve and Thck is the<br>
thickness at Pf Zf is found using the following formula:<br><br>
In the case in which the base curve is non-spherical, the procedure may be<br>
more complicated, but may be summarized as follows: a.) offset the base curve by<br>
Thck; b.) intersect the offset curve with line r = Rf, wherein r = Rf is an equation<br>
for a line containing all of the points with y-coordinate Rf in a Cartesian coordinate<br>
system; and c.) select the correct solution if there are more than one solutions. One<br>
ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the correct solution will depend on<br>
the form of the equation of the offset curve.<br>
In this way, all or a portion of the geometry of the lens periphery may be<br>
fully described as a point cloud. The lens periphery designed according to the<br>
method of the invention may be used in the design of any type of ophthalmic lens,<br>
but preferably is used in designing contact lenses and more preferably contact lens<br>
that are spherical, multifocal, toric, or combinations thereof. However, the method<br>
may find its greatest utility in the design of toric contact lenses.<br><br>
