FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel compounds of the class bicycloheteroaryls that are capable of modulating P2X7 receptor activity, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds. This invention also relates to methods for preventing and/or treating conditions that are causally related to aberrant P2X7 activity, such as inflammation-related conditions in mammals, comprising (but not limited to) rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Parkinson's disease, uveitis, asthma, cttdiovascutaff conditions including myocardial infarction, the treatment and prophylaxis of pain syndromes (acute and chronic or neuropathic), traumatic brain injury, acute spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disorders, using the compounds arid pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cell surface receptors for ATP can be divided into metabotropic (P2Y/P2U) and ionotropic (P2X) classes. The metabotropic class belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, with seven transmembrane segments. The ionotropic class members (P2X i - P2X 6) are ligand-gated ion channels, currently thought to be multisubunit proteins with two transmembrane domains per subunit (Buell et al, Europ. J. Neurosci. 8:2221 (1996)). P2Z receptors have been distinguished from other P2 receptors in three primary ways (Buismafl et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:7988 (1988); Cockcroft et al, Nature 279:541 (1979); Steinberg et al, J. Biol. Chem. 262:3118 (1987)). First, activation of P2Z receptors leads not only to an inward ionic current, but also to cell permeabilization. Second, 3'-0-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP (BZATP) is the most effective agonist, and ATP itself is of rather low potency. Third, responses are strongly inhibited by extracellular magnesium ions, that has been interpreted to indicate that ATP4- is the active agonist (DiVirgilio, Immunol. Today 16:524 (1995)).<br>
A seventh member of the P2X receptor family has been isolated from a rat cDNA library and, when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, exhibits the above three properties (Surprenant et al, Science 272:735 (1996)). This receptor (rP2X7) thus corresponds to the P2Z receptor. rP2X7 is structurally related to other members of the P2X family but it has a longer cytoplasmic C-terminus domain (there is 35-40% amino acid identity in the corresponding region of homology, but the C-terminus is 239 amino acids long in the rP2X? receptor compared with 27-20 amino acids in the others). The rP2X7 receptor functions both as a channel permeable to small cations and as a cytolytic pore. Brief applications of ATP (l-2s) transiently open the channel, as is the case of other P2X receptors. Repeated or prolonged applications of agonist cause cell permeabilization reducing the extracellular magnesium concentration potentiates this effect. The unique C-tenninal domain of rP2X7 is required for cell permeabilization and the lytic actions of ATP (Suprenant et al, Science 272:735 (1996)).<br>
The P2Z/ rP2X7 receptor has been implicated in lysis of antigen-presenting cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, in the mitogenic stimulation of human T lymphocytes, as well as in the formation of multinucleated giant cells (Blanchard et al, Blood 85:3173 (1995); Falzoni et al, J. Clin. Invest. 95:1207 (1995); Baricolrdi et al, Blood 87:682 (1996)). Certain functional differences exist between rodent and man (Hickman et al, Blood 84:2452 (1994)). The human macrophage P2X7 receptor (P2X7) has now been cloned and its functional properties determined (Rassendren et al, J. Biol. Chem. 272:5482<br>
-2-<br><br>
(1997). When compared with the rat P2X7 receptor, elicited cation-selective currents in the human P2X7 receptor required higher concentrations of agonists, were more potentiated by removal of extracellular magnesium ions, and revised more rapidly on agonist removal. Expression of chimeric molecules indicated that some of the differences between rat and human P2X7 receptors could be revised by exchanging the respective C-terminal domains of the receptor proteins.<br>
It has been reported that certain compounds act as P2X7 antagonists. For example, WO99/29660 and W099/29661 disclose that certain adamantane derivatives exhibit P2X7 antagonistic activity having therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Similarly, W099/29686 discloses that certain heterocyclic derivatives are P2X7 receptor antagonists and are useful as immunosuppressive agents and treating rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, septic shock and atheroscelerosis. Finally, WO00/71529 discloses certain substituted phenyl compounds exhibiting immunosuppressing activity. All of the references described herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
A need therefore exists for therapeutic agents, and corresponding pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of treatment, that address the conditions causally related to aberrant P2X7 activity, and it is toward the fulfillment and satisfaction of that need, that the present invention is directed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bicycloaryl derivatives of formulae I-XIIId, and their pharmaceutical compositions are disclosed as therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of conditions in mammals associated with abnormal or aberrant activity of the P2X7 receptor, including inflammatory-mediated conditions such as (but not limited to) arthritis, myocardial infarction, the treatment and prophylaxis of pain syndromes (acute and chronic [neuropathic]), traumatic brain injury, acute spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory bowel disease and immune dysfunctions such as autoimmune disorders.<br>
It has now been found that the present bicycloheteroaryl compounds are capable of mediating the activity of the P2X7 receptor. This finding leads to novel compounds having therapeutic value. It also leads to pharmaceutical compositions having the compounds of the present invetion as active ingredients and to their use to treat, prevent or ameliorate a range of conditions in mammals such as but not limited to inflammation of various genesis or etiology, for example rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, acute, chronic, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, dental pain and headache (such as migraine, cluster headache and tension headache) and other conditions causally related to inflammation or immune dysfunction.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of inflammatory pain and associated hyperalgesia and allodynia. They are also useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain and associated hyperalgesis and allodynia (e.g. trigeminal or herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, causalgia, sympathetically maintained pain and deafferentation syndromes such as brachial plexus avulsion). The compounds of the present invention are also useful as anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of arthritis,<br>

"Treating" or "treatment" of any disease or disorder refers, in one embodiment, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another embodiment "treating" or "treatment" refers to ameliorating at least one physical parameter, which may not be discernible by the subject. In yet another embodiment, "treating" or "treatment" refers to modulating the disease or disorder, either physically, (e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom), physiologically, (e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter), or both. In yet another embodiment, "treating" or "treatment" refers to delaying the onset of the disease or disorder.<br>
Other derivatives of the compounds of this invention have activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but in the acid sensitive form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well know to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides and anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the compounds of this invention are preferred prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. Preferred are the C1 to C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, aryl, C7-C12 substituted aryl, and C7-C]2 arylalkyl esters of the compounds of the invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "isotopic variant" refers to a compound that contains unnatural proportions of isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compound. For example, an "isotopic variant" of a compound can contain one or more non-radioactive isotopes, such as for example, deuterium (2H or D), carbon-13 (l3C), nitrogen-15 (15N), or the like. It will be understood that, in a compound where such isotopic substitution is made, the following atoms, where present, may vary, so that for example, any hydrogen may be 2H/D, any carbon may be l3C, or any nitrogen may be l5N, and that the presence and placement of such atoms may be determined within the skill of the art. Likewise, the invention may include the preparation of isotopic variants with radioisotopes, in the instance for example, where the resulting compounds may be used for drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation<br>
-20-<br><br>
and ready means of detection. Further, compounds may be prepared that are substituted with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 150 and ,3N, and would be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
All isotopic variants of the compounds provided herein, radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the invention.<br>
It is also to be understood that compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "isomers". Isomers that differ in the arrangement of then-atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers".<br>
Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereomers" and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed "enantiomers". When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or Jevorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a "racemic mixture".<br>
"Tautomers" refer to compounds that are interchangeable forms of a particular compound structure, and that vary in the displacement of hydrogen atoms and electrons. Thus, two structures may be in equilibrium through the movement of n electrons and an atom (usually H). For example, enols and ketones are tautomers because they are rapidly interconverted by treatment with either acid or base. Another example of tautomerism is the aci- and nitro- forms of phenylnitromethane, that are likewise formed by treatment with acid or base.<br>
Tautomeric forms may be relevant to the attainment of the optimal chemical reactivity and biological activity of a compound of interest.<br>
The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)- stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art.<br>

In certain aspects, the present invention provides prodrugs and derivatives of the compounds according to the formulae above. Prodrugs are derivatives of the compounds of the invention, which have metabolically cleavable groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological conditions the compounds of the invention, which are pharmaceutical^ active, in vivo. Such examples include, but are not limited to, choline ester derivatives and the like, N-alkylmorpholine esters and the like.<br>
Other derivatives of the compounds of this invention have activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but the acid sensitive form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well know to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides and anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the compounds of this invention are preferred prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. -Preferred are the Q to C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, aryl, C7-Cl2 substituted aryl, and C7-C,2 arylalkyl esters of the compounds of the invention.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of this invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound.<br>
Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount.   The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be<br>
-32-<br><br>
determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound -administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. Depending on the intended route of delivery, the compounds of this invention are preferably formulated as either injectable or oral compositions or as salves, as lotions or as patches all for transdermal administration.<br>
The compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term '*unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the furansulfonic acid compound is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.<br>
Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like.

Example 1<br>
The P2X7 receptor is strongly expressed in macrophage-derived cell lines, including, but not limited to, J774 (mouse macrophage line, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD, ATCC TIB-67), P388 (mouse cell line, ATCC CCL-46), P815 (mouse mast cell mastocytoma-derived line, ATCC TIB-64), THP-1 (Human monocyte-derived cell line, ATCC TIB202) and U937 (human cell line derived from histiocytic lymphoma, induceable to monocyte differentiation, ATCC CRL-1593.2) and in isolated macrophage cultures. Human or non-human animal macrophages are isolated using the procedure noted below.<br>
The P2Z/ P2X7 receptor can be characterized by measuring channel opening, for instance ion flux, and/or by assessing pore formation, including by monitoring dye uptake or cell lysis in cells naturally expressing this receptor. Compounds such as ATP, 2' and 3*-(0)-(4-benzoyl benzoyl) ATP (BzATP) effect the formation of pores in the plasma membrane of these cells, particularly at low extracellular divalent ion concentrations (Buisman et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:7988 (1988); Zambon et al, Cell. Immunol 156:458 (1994); Hickman et al Blood 84:2452 (1994)). Large molecular size dyes, including propidium dye YO-PRO-1, can be seen entering macrophage-derived cell lines during cell recordings (Hickman et al, Blood 84:2452 (1994); Wiley et al, Br J Pharmacol 112:946 (1994); Steinberg et al, J Biol Chem 262:8884 (1987)). Ethidium bromide (a fluorescent DNA probe) can also be monitored, where an increase in the fluorescence of intracellular DNA-bound ethidium bromide is observed. Expression of recombinant rat or human rP2X7 in cells, including HEK293 cells, and in Xenopus oocytes demonstrates influx and pore  formation by whole cell recordings and YO-PRO-1   fluorescence<br>

(Suprenant et al, Science 272:735 (1996); Rassendren et al, J Biol Chem 272:5482 (1997)).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor. Tests to be performed include and are selected from: (i) electrophysiological experiments; (ii) YO-PROl fluorescence; (iii) ethidium bromide fluorescence; and (iv) IL-lp release from stimulated macrophages, including as described below. Compounds can be tested in vivo in animal models including for inflammation models (e.g. paw edema model, collagen-induced arthritis, EAE model of MS).<br>
Isolation of Human Macrophages<br>
Monocyte-derived human or non-human animal macrophage cultures are prepared as described by Blanchard et al (Blanchard et al, J Cell Biochem 57:452 (1995); Blanchard et al, J Immunol 147:2579 (1991)). Briefly, monocytes are isolated from leukocyte concentrates obtained from a healthy volunteer. Leukocytes are suspended in RPMI 1460 medium (Life Techologies, Inc.) with 20% serum (human for human cells), 2mM glutamine, 5mM HEPES, and lOOug/ml streptomycin. Cells are allowed to adhere to culture flasks for l-2h, after which nonadherent cells are washed away. Adherent cells are cultured for 7-14d in this medium plus interferon-? (human for human cells) (1000 units/ml). Macrophages are recovered from the culture flask by pipetting with cold phosphate-buffered saline and plated onto glass coverslips for electrophysiological or other experiments carried out 12-24h later.<br>
Example 2<br>
Electrophysiological Experiments Whole cell recordings are made using the EPC9 patch-clamp amplifier and Pulse acquisition programs (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Whole-cell recordings are obtained from cells, e.g. J774A.1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, ATCC TIB-67)); agonists are applied for periods of 1 to 3 s by a fast-flow U-tube delivery system [E.M. Fenwick, A. Marty, E. Neher, J. Physiol, (London) 331, 577 (1982)]. The internal pipette solution is 140 mM cesium-aspartate or potassium-aspartate, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA, and 5 mM Hepes; normal external solution is 145 mM NaCl, 2 mM KC1, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2i 10 mM Hepes, and 12 mM glucose. Low divalent external solution is nominally magnesium-free with 0.3 mM CaCl2. Concentration-response curves are constructed in low divalent solution by recording currents in response to 1 s applications of agonist at 8 min intervals with normal external solution present for 6 min before each application. This protocol is necessary to prevent the development of sustained inward currents.<br>
Reversal potentials (Erev) are obtained by application of ATP (300 uM) or BzATP (30 uM)(controls), or the compound being tested, while the membrane is held at various potentials or by application of voltage ramps from -120 to 30 or 50 mV. Permeability ratios are calculated from Erev by first computing a (= PNH/PIC where P is permeability) for internal (i) and external (o) concentrations [Na]| = 20 mM, [Na]0 = 145 mM, [K]0 = 0 mM, and [K], = 140 mM from a = ([\45/Qxp(EKVFIRT)] - 20)/140 (where F is the Faraday, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature). Other PX/PN3 values, when PC]0 = 145 mM, [Na], = 20 mM, [K], = 140 mM, and [Na]0 - [K]0 = [X]! = 0 mM, are computed from Px/PNa = [(exp)ErejF/RT)] (20 + 140a))/145.   In order of size, X is<br>

cesium, methylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, tetraethylammonium, and N-methyl-D-glucamine. The internal solution also contains 10 mM EGTA and 5 mM Hepes. External solutions also contain 10 mM glucose and normal or low concentrations of divalent cations; pH is maintained at 7.3 with HC1, histidine, or Hepes as required, and the osmolality of all solutions is 295 to 315.<br>
Example 3<br>
YO-PROl Fluorescence The Photonics Imaging (IDEA) system for microscopic fluorescence measurements (Photonics, Planegg, Germany) is used. Coverslips are placed at the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 or equivalent inverted microscope and viewed under oil immersion with a 40X Fluor objective. YO-PRO-1 (10 uM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) is added to the supervision fluid during electrophysiological recordings 3 to 6 min before switching to low divalent solution and washed out upon switching back to normal divalent solution, after which the fluorescent lamp is turned on and cells are examined with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. YO-PROl fluorescence is measured using 491/509 nm excitation/emission wavelengths. Images are obtained at 5-20s intervals during continuous superfusion (2ml/min) with YO-PROl and varying concentrations of control ATP, BzATP or compound to be tested. For each experiment, the time course of YO-PROl fluorescence obtained for 10-20 individual cells and then averaged to obtain the mean fluorescence signal. Results were expressed as mean signal at 3 min for rP2X7 and the signal at 10 min is used for P2X7 and human macrophage cells. All experiments are carried out at room temperature.<br>
Example 4<br>
Ethidium Bromide Compounds of the invention are tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor by monitoring Ethidium Bromide entering P2X7 receptor-expressing cells on pore formation. The test is performed in 96-well flat bottomed microtitre plates, the wells being filled with 250 ui of test solution comprising 200 ul of a suspension of P2X7- expressing cells (e.g. THP-1 cells, J774 cells, etc.)(2.5 xlO6 cells/ml) containing 10"*M ethidium bromide, 25 ul of a high potassium buffer solution containing 10"5M BzATP, and 25 ul of a high potassium buffer solution containing test compound. The plate is covered with a plastic sheet and incubated at 37° C for one hour. The plate is then read in a Perkin-Elmer fluorescent plate reader, excitation 520 nm, emission 595 nm, slit widths; Ex 15 nm, EM 20 nm. For the purposes of comparison, BzATP (a P2X7 receptor agonist) and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (a P2X7 receptor agonist) are used separately in the test as controls. From the readings obtained, a pIC5o figure is calculated for each test compound. This figure is the negative logarithm of the concentration of test compound necessary to reduce the BzATP agonist activity by 50%.<br>

Cell isolation<br>
Monocytes are isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as follows. Whole blood is layered directly onto Histopak 1077-1 columns (Sigma Biochemicals) and centrifuged at 800xg for 15 minutes. The PBMC band of cells is removed to a fresh 50 ml culture tube and diluted 1:1 with wash buffer (Phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 containing 2 mM EDTA and 5 mg/ml BSA) followed by centrifugation at 800xg for 5 minutes. Cells are then washed by sequential resuspension of the cell pellet in wash buffer .and centrifugation at 600xg for 5 minutes. The wash process is repeated until the supernatent is clear of contaminating platelets (generally, 5 to 6 washes). Monocytes are then purified from the PBMCs by negative selection using a monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.) that contains antibodies to non-monocytic cells, running the cells over a magnetic column to remove antibody-bound cells, and collecting the flow through volume of monocytes. Monocytes are washed once with wash buffer and seeded at 100,000 cells per well in 100 ul serum-free RPMI 1640 in 96-well plates and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C in a 5% C02/95% humidified tissue culture incubator. After 1 hour, the medium is replaced with 100 ul complete culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% human serum-type AB (heat inactivated), 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, 50 U/ml each of penicillin      and      streptomycin)      and      incubated      overnight      (16      hours).<br>
Dosing regimen<br>
The next day, the culture medium is replaced with 100 fresh complete culture medium in the absence or presence of human beta amyloid 1-42 peptide (5 uM) and incubated at 37° C in a 5% C02/95% humidified tissue culture incubator for 5 hours. Medium is then removed and discarded. Each well is washed once with Hanks buffered saline (HBSS) containing 1 mM CaCl2 followed by the addition of 80 of HBSS/CaCl2-inhibiting compound of the present invention (lOx stock in HBSS/CaCl2 for a final concentration of 23 nM and 206 nM) and incubated 15 minutes in the tissue culture incubator followed by the addition of either 10 ul of HBSS/CaCl2or 10 ul of benzoyl ATP (BzATP; 3 mM stock in HBSS/ CaCl2 for a 300 uM final concentration) and incubated for a further 30 minutes in the tissue culture incubator. Medium is then removed to new 96-well plates for storage at -70° C until the IL-16 content was quantitated by ELISA (from R&amp;D Systems). The cells are washed once with HBSS/CaCl2 followed by lysing the cells with 100 \i\ ice cold lysis buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 tablet per 30 ml Complete TM protease inhibitor from Roche Biochemicals, Inc). Cell lysates are stored at -70° C until the IL- is quantitated by ELISA.<br>

B. This Example illustrates a protocol for determining the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention for the treatment of stroke using an animal model.<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River) weighing 280-320 g are given free access to food and water and acclimatized for a minimum of 4 days before use in experiments. All rats for use in studies are to be fasted beginning at 3;00 pm the day prior to surgery but given free access to water. Prior to surgery each rat is weighed. The rat is initially induced with 5% isoflurane (Aerrane, Fort Dodge), combined with 30% 02, 70% N20 for 2-5 minutes. The rat is then placed on a circulating water-heating pad and into a nose cone for spontaneous respiration of anesthetic gases. The isoflurane is reduced to 2%. A rectal probe is inserted and body temperature maintained at 36.5-37.5° C. The hair is clipped at all surgical sites and these regions will then be scrubbed with Betadine.<br>
Surgical Procedure<br>
A temporalis muscle probe is placed into the right temporalis muscle and "brain" temperature" is monitored. A midline neck incision is made in the upper thorax of the rat. Careful dissection, isolation and retraction of the sternomastoideus, digastricus, and sternohyoideus muscles is made to expose the right common, internal and external carotid arteries. The right common carotid artery is isolated with a 5-0 silk suture. During surgery the suture is released allowing reperfusion every 2-4 minutes. The right external caTotid and superior thyroid arteries are also isolated and the superior thyroid is cauterized, while the external carotid is ligated distally with a 5-0 silk suture. Another 5-0 silk suture is loosely tied around the external carotid artery. The occipital artery is isolated, ligated and incised. The internal carotid is isolated.<br>
With the common and external carotid arteries immobilized, an aneurysm clip is placed onto the internal carotid artery. A small incision is made at the distal end of the external carotid. A 3-0 nylon suture coated with1 poly-L-lysine is then inserted into the external carotid and up into the common carotid artery. The loosely tied 5-0 silk suture around the external carotid is now gently tightened around the filament. The external carotid artery is then incised and the remaining piece of the external carotid artery with the filament is rotated so that the filament may be inserted into the internal carotid artery the length of insertion depending on the weight and rat strain. In Sprague Dawley rats the monofilament is inserted 18-19 mm (18 mm for rats weighing 
The external jugular vein will be cannulated with PE 50 tubing for I.V. administration of compounds. The cannula will be exteriorized at the previously shaven, scruff of the neck and sutured in place. The wound will be closed by means of suture. The right femoral artery is catheterized for blood gas and glucose determination during surgery.<br>
Two hours after the insertion of the monofilament suture the rats are re-anesthetized with the same anesthetic combination used initially and placed back into the nose cone with the reduction of isoflurane concentration to 2%. The neck incision is reopened to expose the external carotid artery. The restoration of blood flow is accomplished by completely withdrawing the intraluminal suture from the carotid arteries. The incision is then closed with 3-0 silk in an interrupted stitch.<br>
-57-<br><br>
Compound Administration<br>
Five groups of 15 animals are subjected to the above methodology. Compounds are infused (I.V.) at various doses (dose response) over different time period's post MCAo. A pre-determined concentration is infused over a pre-selected time period beginning at various intervals post MCAo. Vehicle-treated controls receive an infusion of normally 0.9 ml/hr. A positive control compound is run at the same time.<br>
Neurological Tests<br>
Prior to surgery, 2 hours following the onset of ischaemia and 24 hours after ischaemia a battery of neurological tests are performed. The postural reflex test, which is designed to examine upper body posture, when the rat is suspended by the tail above a flat surface. A normal rat will extend the entire body and both forelimbs towards the surface. Rats with an infarction will consistently flex the contralateral limb and show signs of body rotation. The rats respond to a gentle lateral push with a finger behind the shoulders. A normal rat would resist such a push, whereas a rat with an infarction will not. The elicited forelimb placing in response to visual and tactile stimuli. The animal is held by the body so that the lateral or dorsal forepaw surface is placed against a bench. This test is repeated but on this occasion obstructing the view of the rat.<br>
Upon completion of each experiment, all animals are deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane (5%), euthanized by decapitation, and the brains removed, the extent and location of the ischaemic damage is verified histologically by means of tetrazolium chloride.

Method<br>
Groups of 3 Wistar derived male rats weighing 180±20 gms are used. Distal colitis is induced by intra-colonic instillation of DNBS (2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, 30 mg in 0.5 ml ethanol 30%) after which, 2 ml of air is gently injected through the cannula to ensure that the solution remains in the colon. Test substance is administered orally (PO) at a dose of 50 mg/kg or intraperitoneally (IP) at 30 mg/kg once daily for 7 consecutive days. DNBS is instillated into the distal colon of each animal 2 hours after dosing on the second day. The control group is similarly treated with vehicle alone and sulfasalazine (300 mg/kg, PO) is used as reference agent. Animals are fasted 24 hours before DNBS challenge and 24 hours after the final treatment when they are sacrificed and each colon is removed and weighed. During the experiments, presence of diarrhea is recorded daily. When the abdominal cavity is opened before removal of the colon, adhesions between the colon and other organs are noted. After weighing the colon, the extent of colonic ulceration is observed and noted as well. Colon-to-body weight ratio is then calculated for each animal according to the formula: Colon (g)/BWxl00%. The "Net" increase in ratio of Vehicle-control +DNBS group relative to Vehicle-control group is used as a base value for comparison with test substance treated groups and expressed as % decrease in inflammation. A 30 percent or more (30%) decrease in "Net" colon-to-body weight ratio for each test substance treated group relative to the "Net" vehicle+DNBS treated group is considered significant.<br>

Neuropathic Pain Model This example illustrates the analgesic activity of the compounds of this invention using a Sciatic Nerve ligation model of mononeuropathic pain<br>
Test system<br>
Adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats weighing 250-300 gin (Charles River Laboratories, San Diego, CA) are used. The animal room is lighted artificially at a 12-hr light-dark cycle (from 7:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M) with water and food supply ad libitum. Animals are allocated randomly into groups.<br>
Model induction<br>
Sciatic nerve ligation (SNL, Seltzer's model):<br>
Under anesthesia with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and aseptic techniques, the selective nerve injury is created by tightly ligating the selective portion of the common sciatic nerve according to the method of Seltzer (1990). Briefly, the high-thigh level of the left sciatic nerve is exposed after skin incision and blunt separation of muscles at a site near the trochanter just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendious nerve nerve branches from the common sciatic nerve. The nervtf is then fixed in this position with fine forceps by pinching the epineurium on its dorsal aspect, taking care not to press the nerve against underlying structures. An 8-0 silicon-treated silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle, and tightly ligated so that the dorsal - Vi of the nerve is trapped in the ligature. The muscles are sutured in layers, and the skin closed with wound clips. Animals are then returned to their home cages. Rats exhibiting postoperative neurological deficits or poor grooming are excluded from the experiments.<br>

IC50 Determinations<br>
The compounds set forth in Table 1 were tested for activity in a cellular model as described herein. Specifically, cells were pretreated with differing amounts of the compound under test and released IL-lβ determined as in Example 9, above. Measurements were made and IC50 values, presented in Table 2, below, were determined by fitting the data to a four parameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc). The equation may be expressed by the following formula:<br>
Y=Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(l+10^ ((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope)) Where X is the logarithm of concentration,Y is the response and Y starts at Bottom and goes to Top with a sigmoid shape.<br>

Half-life in human liver microsomes (HLM)<br>
Test compounds (1 μM) are incubated with 3.3 mM MgCl2 and 0.78 mg/mL HLM (HL101) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37°C on the 96-deep well plate. The reaction mixture is split into two groups, a non-P450 and a P450 group. NADPH is only added to the reaction mixture of the P450 group. An aliquot of samples of P450 group is collected at 0, 10, 30, and 60 min time point, where 0 min time point indicated the time when NADPH is added into the reaction mixture of P450 group. An aliquot of samples of non-P450 group is collected at -10 and 65 min time point. Collected aliquots are extracted with acetonitrile solution containing an internal standard. The precipitated protein is spun down in centrifuge (2000 rpm, 15 min). The compound concentration in supernatant is measured by LC/MS/MS system.<br>
The half-life value is obtained by plotting the natural logarithm of the peak area ratio of compounds/ internal standard versus time. The slope of the line of best fit through the points yields the rate of metabolism (k). This is converted to a half-life value using following equations:<br>
Half-life = In 2 /k<br>

Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of compounds following Intravenous and oral administration in rats.<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats are acclimatized for at least 24 hours prior to experiment initiation. During the acclimation period, all animals receive food and water ad libitum. However, food but not water is removed from the animal's cages at least 12 hours before initiation of the experiment. During the first 3 hours of experimentation, the animals receive only water ad libitum. At least three animals each are tested for intravenous and oral dosage. For intravenous formulation, compounds were dissolved (0.25 to 1 mg/mL) in a mixture of 3% dimethyl sulfoxide, 40% PEG 400 and the rest percentage of 40% Captisol in water (w/v). The animals are weighed before dosing. The determined body weight is used to calculate the dose volume for each animal.<br>
Dose volume (mL/kg) = 1 mg/kg/formulation concentration (mg/mL) In instances where the formulation concentrations were less than 0.5 mg/mL, the dosing volume is about 2 mL/kg.<br>
For oral formulation, compounds of this invention are suspended (0.5 to 0.75 mg/mL) in a mixture of 5% of 10% Tween 80 in water (v/v) and 95% of 0.5 % methyl cellulose in water (w/v). PO rats are typically dosed through oral gavage following the same dose volume formula as IV to achieve a dose level of 1 to 5 mg/kg. For IV dosing, blood samples are collected (using a pre-heparinized syringe) via the jugular vein catheter at 2, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300, 480, and 1440 minutes post dosing. For PO dosing, blood samples are collected (using a pre-heparinized syringe) via the jugular vein catheter before dosing and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300, 480, and 1440 minutes post dosing. About 250 uL of blood is obtained at each time point from the animal. Equal volumes of 0.9% normal saline are replaced to prevent dehydration. The whole blood samples are maintained on ice until centrifugation. Blood samples are then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C and the upper plasma layer transferred into a clean vial and stored at -80°C. The resulting plasma samples are then analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Following the measurement of plasma samples and dosing solutions, plasma concentration-time curve is plotted.   Plasma exposure is calculated as76 <br>
the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to time infinite (AUCnf). The AUCinf is averaged and the oral bioavailability (%F) for individual animal is calculated as:<br>
AUCinf (PO)/AUCinf (IV), normalized to their respective dose levels.<br>
The %F can be reported as the mean %F of all animals dosed orally with the compound<br>
of the invention at the specified level.<br>
