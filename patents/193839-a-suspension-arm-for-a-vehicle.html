The present invention relates to a suspension arm for a vehicle, including first and second plate-like members which are superposed one on another on opposite sides of a center plane and integrally welded to each other at their peripheral edges, each of the first and second plate-like members including a vehicle body mounting portion and a knuckle mounting portion provided respectively at its base and tip ends, such that the first and second plate-like members are located on the center plane, and each of the first and second plate-like members further including a stabilizer mounting portion provided at its intermediate portion with a stabilizer mounting means which is connected to the stabilizer mounting portion, the first or second plate-like member being located at an upper side, such that the suspension arm can be used as a left suspension arm or a right suspension arm.<br><br>
When the suspension arm is constructed by welding the pair of upper and lower plate-like members, two types of upper and lower plate-like members are required for each of the left and right suspension arms. This causes a problem that a total of four types of plate-like members having different shapes must be fabricated, resulting in an increased mold cost.<br><br>
Therefore, there is a conventionally known technique in which two types of upper and lower plate-like members are welded to form substantially a single suspension arm which can be commonly used as any of the left and right suspension arms by turning it upside down, thereby providing a reduction in cost.<br>
When the suspension arm capable of being used by turning<br>
it upside down is employed, in order to maintain the symmetry<br>
of the left and right suspension arms, it is necessary to dispose<br>
joints for connecting the suspension arm to a vehicle body or<br>
a knuckle, on the center plane of the suspension arm.  Further,<br>
for each of the left and right suspension arms, the stabilizer<br>
mounting portions to which the stabilizer is connected must be<br>
provided at equal distances from the center plane. Moreover,<br>
when the stabilizer mounting portions are provided in one of<br>
the plate-like members of the suspension arm formed into a<br>
box-like shape in section by welding the pair of upper and lower<br>
plate-like members to each other, the other plate-like member<br>
must be prevented from interfering with the stabilizer mounting<br>
means.<br>
Thereupon, in the known left and right suspension arms, brackets are welded such that they are located at equal distances from the center plane, and the stabilizer mounting portions are formed in the brackets. However, such a construction requires the bracket, which causes an increase in number of parts, and the bracket protrudes to the outside, which increases a size of the suspension arm.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a suspension arm foe a vehicle, which can commonly be used as any of left and right suspension arms by turning it upside down, wherein symmetrical stabilizer mounting portions for each of the left and right suspension arms are formed without use of any special member.<br>
To achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a suspension arm for a vehicle, comprising first and second plate-like members which are superposed one on. another an opposite sides of a center plane and integrally welded to each other at their peripheral edges, each of the first and second plate-like members including a vehicle body mounting portion and a knuckle mounting portion provided respectively at its base and tip ends, such that the first and second plate-like members are located on the center plane, and each of the first and second plate-like members further including a stabilizer mounting portion provided at its intermediate portion with a stabilizer mounting means which is connected to the stabilizer mounting portion, the first or second plate-like member being located at an upper side, such that the suspension arm can be used as a left suspension arm or a right suspension arm, wherein the first and second plate-like members are provided with stabilizer support surfaces at equal distances from the center plane, respectively, the stabilizer mounting portion being formed in the stabilizer<br><br>
'l<br>
supporting surface provided on one'of the first and second plate-like members, and the stabilizer supporting surface provided on the other of the first and second plate-like members being provided with an opening for preventing the interference with the stabilizer mounting means.<br>
With such arrangemf^nt, even if the suspension arm is turned upside down for use, the stabilizer mounting portion formed in one of the plate-like members is located at the same level in any of the left and right suspension arms, to maintain the symmetry, but also to prevent the stabilizer mounting means from interfering with the other plate-like member by the opening formed in the other plate-like member. In addition, any special member need not be added in order to provide the stabilizer mounting portion and hence, it is possible to reduce the number of pares and the manufacture cost and moreover to compactify the suspension arm.<br>
If the stabilizer mounting portion is a small-diameter hole through which a stabilizer mounting bolt is inserted, and the opening is a large-diameter hole into which one of a pair of rubber bushes supported by the stabilizer mounting bolt for clamping the stabilizer mounting portion from above and below, one of the plate-like member and the stabilizer can be resiliently connected to each other through the pair of rubber bushes, and the interference of the rubber bush supported on the stabilizer mounting bolt.with the other plate-like member can be effectively avoided.<br><br>
Further, if a seat surface against which the other of the pair of the rubber bushes abuts is iotegrally Sonneid on a periphery of the stabilizer mouated portion, a washer for abutment of the rubber bush need not specially be mounted, leading to a reduction in number of parts.<br>
A suspension arm for a vehicle, comprisiug first and second plate-like members which are superposed one on another on opposite sides of a center plane and integrally welded to each other at their peripheral edges, each of said first and second plate-like members having a vehicle body mounting portion and a knuckle mounting portion provided respectively at its base and tip ends, such that said first and second plate-like members are located on said center plane, and each of said first and second ptate-tike members wherein a stabilizer mounting portion is provided at its intermediate portion with a stabilizer mounting means which is connected to said stabilizer mounting portion, said first or second plate-like member being located at an upper side, such that said suspension arm can be used as a left suspension arm or a right suspension arm, wherein said first and second plate-like members are provided with stabilizer support surfaces at equal distances from said center plane, respectively, said stabilizer mounting portion being formed in said stabilizer supporting surface provided on one of said first and second plate-like members, and said stabilizer supporting surface provided on the other of said first and second plate* like members being provided with an opening for preventing the interference with said stabilizer mounting means.<br>

DETAILED DESCIPTIOM OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to Fig.l, a MacPherson type suspension S for suspending a left front wheel Wf of a vehicle includes an A-type left suspension arm AL vertically swingably supported at its base end on a vehicle body frame (not shown) at front and rear points (two points), a knuckle 1 pivotally supported at a tip end of the left suspension arm AL, and a front damper 2 which connects an upper portion of the knuckle 1 to a vehicle body frame (not shown). The front damper 2 includes a damper unit 3 composed of an expandable' hydraulic cylinder, and a coil spring 4 wound around an outer periphery of the damper unit 3. A right suspension S mounted at a right side of a vehicle body includes a right suspension arm AR having the substantially same structure as the left suspension arm AL.  The left and right<br><br>
suspension arms AL and AR are interconnected by a stabilizer 5.<br>
The structure of the left suspension arm AL will be described below.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 14, a body of the left suspension arm AL includes a first plate-like member Al forming a top surface of the left suspension arm AL, and a second plate-like member A2 forming a bottom surface of the left suspension arm AL. The first and second plate-like members Al and A2 are integrally coupled by welding. Reference character Al' in Fig. 14A shows a blank for the first plate-like member Al (first plate-like member blank Al')• Prior to welding of the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 to each other, a cutout 111 at a tip end of the first plate-like member Al is cut through a cut line 12i, and a small-diameter stabilizer mounting hole 13i is provided in a stabilizer supporting surface lOi-Reference character A2' in Fig. 14A shows a blank for the second plate-like member A2 (second plate-like member blank A2')-Prior to welding of the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 to each other, a single large-diameter stabilizer-mounting relief hole 142 snd two welding holes 152, 12 3.re provided in a stabilizer supporting surface 102 of the second plate-like member blank A2', and two-drain holes I62, l^s and a single ball housing-mounting hole I'll are provided at other predetermined locations.<br><br>
As shown in Fig.l4A, a first edge portion 18i, a second<br>
edge portion I9i and a third edge portion 20i are formed on an<br>
outer periphery of the first plate-like member blank Al'. A<br>
first edge portion 182, a second edge portion 192 and a third<br>
edge portion 202 are formed onan outer periphery.of the second<br>
plate-like member blank A2 ' in correspondence to the edge<br>
portions I81, 19i and 20i, respectively.  In coupling the first<br>
and second plate-like members Al and A2 to each other, the first,<br>
second and third edge portions I81, 19i and 20i of the first<br>
plate-like member Al are welded to the first, second and third<br>
edge portions I82, 192 and 2O2 of the second plate-like member<br>
A2, respectively.	JA 88&gt;8C,9D, 9£ anJ gF<br>
As can be seen from Figs.2, 3, / the first edge portion I81 of the first plate-like member Al and the first edge portion I82 of the second plate-like member A2 are welded to each other in a state where they abut against each other from above and below. On the other hand, the third edge portion 20i of the first plate-like member Al is welded in a fitted state to an outer side of the third edge portion 2O2 of the second plate-like member A2.<br>
An inner shaft 22 of a rubber bush joint for pivotally supporting a rear portion of the left suspension arm AL at its base end is welded at W4 (see Figs.SA and 8B) to an inner surface of an inner shaft support portion 21i of the first plate-like member Al. The welding W4 is conducted before welding Wi, W; and W3 of the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 to<br><br>
each other. At that time, a flange 23 of the inner shaft 22 is welded to end faces of the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 for reinforcement (see Figs.2 and 3).<br>
An outer pipe 26 of a rubber bush joint for pivotally supporting a front portion of the left suspension arm AL at its base end to the vehicle body frame is welded at Wg to each of an outer pipe support portion 25i of the first plate-like member Al and an outer pipe support portion 252 of the second plate-like member A2 (see Figs.2 and 3).<br>
Since the cutout Hi (see Fig. 14A) of the first plate-like member is previously cut, as described above, a back of a ball housing support portion 272 of the second plate-like member A2 corresponding to the cutout is directed upward and exposed (see Figs. 5 and 7} . A ball housing 28 of a ball joint for pivotally supporting the tip end of the left suspension arm AL to the. knuckle 1 is welded at W? to the ball housing mounting hole 172 provided in the ball housing support portion 272.<br>
The first and second plate-like members Al and A2 abut against each other at an abutment area ^ surrounded by a dashed line in Figs. 3 and 9F, and are integrally welded at We to each other through welding holes 152/ 1^2 provided in the second plate-like member A2 such that they are located in the abutment area s. The first and second plate-like members Al and A2 also abut against each other at an abutment area fe surrounded by a dashed line in Figs.4 and 8A.<br><br>
.'    .	J^   ■	■    ^-<br>
In welding the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 at W1, W2 and W3 in their mutually-superposed states, as described above, the first and second edge portions I81 and 191 of the first plate-like member Al are butted against the first and second edge portions 182 and 192 of the second plate-like member A2.  Hence, it is possible to reliably position the plate-like members Al and A2 in the thickness direction (see Figs.     /     The third edge portion 20i of the first plate-like member Al is fitted to the outer side of the third edge portion 2O2 of the second plate-like member A2.  Hence, the positioning of the plate-like members Al and A2 cannot reliably be performed in the thickness direction at these third edge portions 201 and 202, and a special positioning jig is required in the welding at Wi, W2 and W3.<br>
However, practically, the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 are positioned in the thickness direction to abut against each other in the two abutment areas ^ and h {see Figs.SA and 9F) . Hence, even if the special jig is not used, the third edge portion 20L of the first plate-like member Al and the third edge portion 2O2 of the second plate-like member A2 can be positioned in the thickness direction to enhance the welding {W1, W2 and W3} workability.<br>
If the butting of the first edge portions I81 and I82 and the second edge portions 191 and 192 is conducted by the flanges, the sectional area of the suspension arm AL is decreased, which is inconvenient for the strength.  However, the third edge<br>
73<br><br>
portions 20i and 20; are fitted with each other without having flanges and hence, the sectional area can be increased at this region to increase the strength of the suspension arm AL.<br>
As shown in Fig.l6A, a stabilizer mounting bolt 29 is upwardly inserted through the suspension arm mounting hole 13i provided in the first plate-like member Al of the left suspension arm AL, and a nut 30 is threadedly fitted over an upper end of the bolt 29. A washer 32a, a rubber bush 33a, a washer 32b, the first plate-like member Al, a rubber bush 33b, a washer 32c, a collar 34, a washer 32d, a rubber bush 33c, the stabilizer 5, a rubber bush 33d and a washer 32e are clamped in the named order from below to above between a head of the stabilizer mounting bolt 29 and the nut 30. This causes the end of the stabilizer 5 to be resiliently supported to the left suspension arm AL. The stabilizer mounting bolt 29, the nut 30, the washers 32a to 32e, the rubber bushes 33a to 33d and the collar 34 constitute a stabilizer mounting means 38.<br>
The bottom surface of the rubber bush 33b is supported, without use of any washer, on a seat surface 35i formed on a top surface of the first plate-like member Al. The top surface of the rubber bush 33c and the bottom surface of the rubber bush 33e are also supported, without use of any washer, on a pair of upper and lower seat surfaces 36 and 37 formed on the stabilizer 5.<br>
Because the cutout lli is previously cut from the first plate-like member Al, as can be seen from Figs. 5 and 7, the first<br><br>
and second plate-like members Al and A2 cannot interfere with each other, when the left suspension arm AL is fabricated by coupling the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 in the  above-described manner.   In  addition,  because  the large-diameter  stabilizer  mounting  relief  hole  142  is previously provided in the lower second plate-like member A2, as shown in Fig. ISA, the upper first plate-like member Al cannot interfere with such portion of the lower second plate-like member A2, when the left suspension arm AL is fabricated by coupling the first and second plate-li^ke members Al and A2 in the above-described manner.<br>
The structure of the right suspension arm AR will be described below.<br>
The right suspension arm AR is made using the same blanks as the first and second plate-like member blanks Al' and A2' which are the blanks of the left suspension arm AL. The outline structure is similar to that of the left suspension arm AL turned upside down.<br>
As shown in Fig.l4A, the left suspension arm AL is made using the first plate-like member blank Al' at the top surface side and using the second plate-like member blank A2' at the bottom surface side, while the right suspension arm AR is made using the first plate-like member blank Al' at the bottom surface side and using the second plate-like member blank A2' at the top surface side.<br><br>
Therefore, for the right suspension arm AR, the first<br>
plate-like member Al constituting the bottom surface of the<br>
right suspension arm AR is fabricated by providing the first<br>
plate-like member blank Al' with the large-diameter stabilizer<br>
mounting relief hole 141, the two welding holes 151, 151, the<br>
two drain holes 161, 161, and the single ball housing mounting<br>
hole 171, The second plate-like member A2 constituting the top<br>
surface of the right suspension arm AR is fabricated by cutting<br>
the cutout II2 at the tip end of the second plate-like member<br>
blank A2' through the cut line 122 and by providing the second<br>
plate-like member blank A2' with the small-diameter stabilizer<br>
mounting hole 132.<br>
The edge portions I81, 191, and 201; I82, 192 and 2O2 around the outer peripheries of the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 are welded at W1, W2 and Wa in, the same manner as the left suspension arm AL. The inner shaft 22 is welded at W^ to the inner surface of the inner shaft support portion 21i of the first plate-like member Al, and the flange 23 of the inner shaft 22 is welded at W5 to the end faces of the first and second plate-like members Al and A2. Further, the outer pipe 2S is welded at Wg to the outer pipe support portions 25i and 252 of the first and second plate-like members Al and A2, and the ball housing 28 is welded at W7 in the ball housing mounting hole 17i provided in the ball housing support portion lly of the first plate-like member Al.<br><br>
Because the cutout ll; is previously cut from the second plate-like member A2, as can be seen from Figs.12 and 13, the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 cannot interfere with each other, when the right suspension arm AR is fabricated by coupling the first and second plate-like members Al and A2. Likewise, because the large-diameter stabilizer mounting relief hole 14i is previously provided in the lower first plate-like member Al, as shown in Fig.lSB, the upper first plate-like member A2 cannot interfere with such portion of the lower second plate-like member A2, when the right suspension arm AR is fabricated by coupling the first and second plate-like members Al and A2.<br>
As shown in Fig.l6B, the stabilizer 5 is connected to the right suspension arm AR through the stabilizer mounting means 38 in the substantially same manner as in the left suspension arm AL, but a difference between the right suspension arm AR and the left suspension arm AL is that the second plate-like member A2 rather than the first plate-like member Al is clamped by the lower two rubber bushes 33a and 33b.<br>
In any of the left and right suspension arms AL and AR fabricated in the above manner, the common first and second plate-like member blanks Al' and A2' (see Fig. 14) are used and hence, the number of pressing molds for forming the these plate-like member blanks Al' and A2' can be suppressed co the minimum to contribute to a reduction in cost.<br><br>
Moreover, in the left and right suspension arms AL and AR each having the above-described structure, the inner shaft 22, the outer pipe 26 and the-ball housing 28 are disposed to lie on a center plane P extending between the first and second plate-like members Al and A2, as can be seen from Figs.4 and 6. Therefore, in the left and right suspension arms AL and AR in a turned upside-down relationship have the substantially same relationship in positions of the positional relationship of the inner shaft 22, the outer pipe 26 and the ball housings 28, and there is no possibility that a difference is produced between characteristics of the left and right suspensions S, S.<br>
In the vicinity of the stabilizer supporting surfaces lOi and 102/ the interference of the first and second plate-like members Al and A2 with each other is prevented by the stabilizer mounting relief holes 14i and 142- Therefore, as can be seen from the comparison of Figs.lSA and 15B, in any of the left and right suspension arms AL and AR, the stabilizer mounting holes 13i and 132 can be positioned on the center plane P to maintain the symmetry of the left and right suspensions S, S.<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention have been described in detail, it wilLbe understood that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various modifications in design may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined in claims.<br><br>
For example, the stabilizer mounting holes 131 and 132<br>
are positioned on the center plane P in the embodiment, but need<br>
not necessarily be positioned on the center plane P.  The<br>
stabilizer mounting holes 131 and 132 in the left and right<br>
suspension arms AL and AR may be positioned at the same level<br>
from the center plane P.  Tor this purpose, the pair of<br>
stabilizer supporting surfaces lOi and lOj rnay be disposed at<br>
the same distance above and below the center plane P.  The<br>
stabilizer mounting hole 13i, 132 may be provided in one of the<br>
stabilizer supporting surfaces lOi and IO2,  and the stabilizer<br>
mounting relief hole 141, 142 may be provided in the other of<br>
the stabilizer supporting surfaces 101 and l02.  In this case,<br>
the stabilizer mounting hole 131,  132 and the stabilizer<br>
mounting relief hole 141, 142 may be in a turned upside down<br>
relationship, so that the former may be disposed at the upper<br>
location, and the latter may be disposed at the lower location.<br><br><br>
