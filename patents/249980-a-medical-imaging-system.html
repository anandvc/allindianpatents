				<td>ITERATIVE FILTER FRAMEWORK FOR MEDICAL IMAGES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The field of the invention is medical imaging, and particularly, the filtering and enhancement of medical images to improve their visual quality<br>
The quality of medical images is a function of the imaging modality used and the particular method used to acquire the image data  As a general matter, regardless of the imaging modality used, the quality of medical images can be improved by acquiring redundant data which can be averaged to reduce the effects of random noise  Unfortunately, this solution results in an increased scan time that inconveniences the patient and is expensive  Another approach is to increase the power of the imaging system  In MRI this may take the form of a stronger polarizing field (eg  15 Tesla instead of 0 5 Tesla), in x-ray systems this can take the form of a higher power x-ray beam, and in ultrasound this may take the form of a more powerful rf amplifier and transducer  These measures drive up the cost of the equipment, and m the case of x-ray, increase the dose of ionizing radiation to the patient<br>
Attempts have been made to improve the imagability of the subject by injecting contrast agents into the patient  See for example, U S  Pat No  4,834,964 of Rosen  However, injected contrast agents only improve a limited range of image characteristics, and because it is as an invasive technique, it is sometimes inappropriate for medical reasons<br>
Acguired medical images can also be processed to enhance their clinical value by modifying with the histogram or distribution of signal values on a global or local basis as described, for example, m U S  Pat No  5,063,607   In other enhancement techniques, the gray scale range of each subimage region is stretched such that it covers the entire display range as, for example, in U S  Pat  No  4,991,092   However, histogram modifications which expand the dynamic range of the data, also increase the noise in the image Local histogram modifications cause a blocking effect that results in a lack of uniformity over the entire image<br>
Images may be enhanced using convolution or filtering techniques  Such techniques include the amplification of selected frequency bands as illustrated in U S  Pat  No  5 072,314 of Chang Others have used a combination of high and low pass filtering to enhance images as illustrated for example in U S  Pat  No  5,081,692 to Kwon or U S  Pat  No 4,972,256 to Hirosawa  However, global filtering techniques tend to blur the images and eliminate the lower frequency regions  This makes clinical evaluation of the images difficult<br>
To eliminate some of the drawbacks of global filtering or convolution, locally adjusted filtering may be used  See for example, U S  Pat No 4,761,819 of Denison, et al , U S  Pat No 4,991,092 of Swon, U S  Pat  No  5,050,227 of Furusawa and "Adaptive Smoothing A General Tool For Early Vision", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine<br>
Intelligence, Vol  13, No  6, Jun 1991, Saint-Marc, et al  However, the local filtering techniques have difficulty distinguishing between sudden image variations attributable to edges and sudden image variations attributable to noise  These techniques also fail to account for differences in edge direction and regional variance, producing an image which is overly smooth without consideration of the edges<br>
Restoration approaches may also be used in which the acquisition process is modeled and the degradation of the imaging process described mathematically  These techniques then attempt to invert the degradations using restoration techniques such as least squares, Bayesian, or Kalman filtering  However, the restoration methods require an accurate model for the acquisition process  Complicated acquisition processes, such as MRI imaging are too difficult to model accurately, and the parameters of a complicated model for a given image can require lengthy iterative computations<br>
U S  Pat  No  4,691,366 of Fenster, et al  uses filters which are adjusted to enhance long edges and attenuate noise and points  However, this technique requires an analysis of the imaging system in order to produce the appropriate filters  Such analysis is computationally intensive, time consuming, and prone to errors<br>
Summary Of The Invention The present invention is a multi-pass filter framework which is employed to improve the quality of<br>
medical images  More particularly, the multi-pass filter framework includes storage means for storing the acquired image data, a plurality of separate filter functions for receiving the acquired image data in a pass therethrough to produce corresponding filtered image data, scaling means for multiplying the filtered image data by a constant (a), summing means for combining filtered and original image data by appropriate scaling to produce an output image, and iteration means for passing the image data through selected filter functions a plurality of times  The filter functions can take many different forms to tailor the multi-pass filter to many different imaging modalities and clinical applications<br>
A general object of the invention is to enhance the quality of medical images without the addition of special hardware or significantly increasing the image processing time  By using the multi-pass filtering of the image data, the separate filtering functions may be considerably simplified  For example, rather than filtering with 15 x 15 element filter kernels, the same result can be accomplished in three passes through the framework which uses a 3 x 1 element filter kernel This translates into simplified and faster processing Also, by using the multi-pass technique the filter can be changed for each pass to provide a much greater range of image effects<br>
A more specific object of the invention is to improve the quality of images acquired with an MRI system Noise may be filtered from the image data using a directional smoothing filter that is sensitive<br>
to edges in the image  The edges are smoothed along them, but their sharpness is not reduced  Segmentation may be used to differentially filter regions with strong and weak edges  These different filter functions may be employed in different combinations during the multiple passes through the filter framework<br>
The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description  In the description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which there is shown by way of illustration a preferred embodiment of the invention  Such embodiment does not necessarily represent the full scope of the invention, however, and reference is made therefore to the claims herein for interpreting the scope of the invention<br>

General Description Of The Invention The present invention is a filter framework which can be configured by the user to implement a wide range of filtering operations on medical images  Referring particularly to Fig 3, the framework is formed around a basic filter block Fu which is comprised of a filter F1  that operates on input image data input at 10  The output of filter Fx is scaled by a factor Cx  and is combined at summer 12 with scaled input image data The scaling factor for the input image data is (1-C) The output 14 of the filter block FX1 is intermediate image data that has undergone one pass of first degree filtering  The filter Fx may be relatively simple in construction such as a smoothing or sharpening filter using a 3x1 filter kernel, or it may be a combination of different filters that can be selectively employed during each pass<br>
The filter framework uses the filter block in Fig 3 to form a multi-pass filter F21 such as that shown in Fig 4  The intermediate image data is fed back into the filter block for another pass, and the particular filter function and the scaling factor C used may be different during each pass  Any number (n) of passes may be performed, as illustrated in Fig 4, and after the last pass, the filtered output image data is scaled by a scaling factor (d) and combined with scaled original input image data at summer point 16  The filtered image data is output at 18  As will be described in detail below, the preferred embodiment of the invention is a three-pass d e n=3) filter for use with image data acquired with an MRI system<br>
With particularly noisy images it may be necessary to provide a second degree filter  Referring particularly to Fig 5, this can be achieved with the filter framework of the present invention by concatenating multi-pass filter blocks such as filter F21 in Fig 4  The output 18 of each multi-pass filter block F21 F22   F2m is fed back through the framework to provide the input to the next filter block in the chain  The output 18 of the last filter block F2m is scaled by a scaling factor (e) and combined with scaled original input image data at summing point 20  The filtered image data is output at 22  It should be apparent that the second order filter F31 can itself be concatenated to form still higher order filters as needed to provide the desired image effects<br>
While the summing points 12, 16 and 20 may be as simple as the arithmetic sum of the scaled pixel intensities, it is also possible to segment the image into different regions and combine the regions with the original image  Regions with strong edges, for example, may not be combined, whereas regions with weak edges may be combined with corresponding data in the original image<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is the ability to configure the filter framework to provide the desired filter functions  A set of parameters control the filter framework to provide the filter blocks and concatenate them as described above  These parameters select the particular filter function to be performed during each pass, and select the value of the scaling factors c1-cn, d1-dn, etc  Stored sets of<br>
parameters may be used to configure the filter framework for particular medical applications<br>
Description Of The Preferred Embodiment Referring first to Fig 1, there is shown the major components of a preferred MRI system which incorporates the present invention  The operation of the system is controlled from an operator console 100 which includes a keyboard and control panel 102 and a display 104  The console 100 communicates through a link 116 with a separate computer system 107 that enables an operator to control the production and display of images on the screen 104  The computer system 107 includes a number of modules which communicate with each other through a backplane  These include an image processor module 106, a CPU module 108 and a memory module 113, known in the art as a frame buffer for storing image data arrays  The computer system 107 is linked to a disk storage 111 and a tape drive 112 for storage of image data and programs, and it communicates with a separate system control 122 through a high speed serial link 115<br>
The system control 122 includes a set of modules connected together by a backplane  These include a CPU module 119 and a pulse generator module 121 which connects to the operator console 100 through a serial link 125   It is through this link 125 that the system control 122 receives commands from the operator which indicate the scan sequence that is to be performed The pulse generator module 121 operates the system components to carry out the desired scan sequence  It<br>
produces data which indicates the timing, strength and shape of the RF pulses which are to be produced, and the timing of and length of the data acquisition window  The pulse generator module 121 connects to a set of gradient amplifiers 127, to indicate the timing and shape of the gradient pulses to be produced during the scan  The pulse generator module 121 also receives patient data from a physiological acquisition controller 129 that receives signals from a number of different sensors connected to the patient, such as ECG signals from electrodes or respiratory signals from a bellows  And finally, the pulse generator module 121 connects to a scan room interface circuit 133 which receives signals from various sensors associated with the condition of the patient and the magnet system  It is also through the scan room interface circuit 133 that a patient positioning system 134 receives commands to move the patient to the desired position for the scan<br>
The gradient waveforms produced by the pulse generator module 121 are applied to a gradient amplifier system 127 comprised of Gx, Gy and Gz amplifiers  Each gradient amplifier excites a corresponding gradient coil in an assembly generally designated 139 to produce the magnetic field gradients used for position encoding acquired signals  The gradient coil assembly 13 9 forms part of a magnet assembly 141 which includes a polarizing magnet 140 and a whole-body RF coil 152  A transceiver module 150 in the system control 122 produces pulses which are amplified by an RF amplifier 151 and coupled to the RF<br>
coil 152 by a transmit/receive switch 154  The resulting signals radiated by the excited nuclei in the patient may be sensed by the same RF coil 152 and coupled through the transmit/receive switch 154 to a preamplifier 153  The amplified NMR signals are demodulated, filtered, and digitized in the receiver section of the transceiver 150  The transmit/receive switch 154 is controlled by a signal from the pulse generator module 121 to electrically connect the RF amplifier 151 to the coil 152 during the transmit mode and to connect the preamplifier 153 during the receive mode  The transmit/receive switch 154 also enables a separate RF coil (for example, a head coil or surface coil) to be used in either the transmit or receive mode<br>
The NMR signals picked up by the RF coil 152 are digitized by the transceiver module 150 and transferred to a memory module 160 in the system control 122  When the scan is completed and an entire array of data has been acquired in the memory module 160, an array processor 161 operates to Fourier transform the data into an array of image data  This image data is conveyed through the serial link 115 to the computer system 107 where it is stored in the disk memory 111 In response to commands received from the operator console 100, this image data may be archived on the tape drive 112, or it may be further processed by the image processor 106 in accordance with the present invention and conveyed to the operator console 100 and presented on the display 104<br>
For a more detailed description of the transceiver 150, reference is made to U S  patent Nos  4,952,877 and 4,922,73 6 which are incorporated herein by reference<br>
The present invention is implemented in the image processor 106 shown in Fig l by carrying out the sequence of steps indicated by the flow chart in Fig 2 on an image stored in digital form  The filtering process provides a multi-pass (iterative) framework with options for changing the parameters used during each pass  As shown by process block 200, eighteen parameters that control the filter process are input by the operator for the particular application  As will be described in more detail below, these parameters control the filtering effect which can range from complete smoothing of the image to complete sharpening of image features, as well as segmentation-based adaptive smoothing and sharpening  In research settings, the separate parameters may be specified by the operator, whereas in clinical settings, a group of stored parameters may be selected by the operator depending on the particular application<br>
As indicated at process block 202, the next step is to initialize the system for the multi-pass filter operation to be performed, and to scale the input image data  The mam reason for scaling is to make the filtering functions independent of the dynamic range of the image data or its DC offset value  More specifically, the following steps are performed<br>
1)	Internal parameters which will be discussed m the next section are initialized and the iteration counter is set to 1,<br>
2)	Maximum (MAX_ORIGINAL)and minimum (MIN_ORIGINAL) image intensity values are determined,<br>
3)	If the iteration number is 1, the original data is save as I2,<br>
4)	scale = 4095 0/MAX_ORIGINAL,<br>
5)	Scaled image I is obtained using the relation 1=(I-MIN_ORIGINAL)* scale,<br>
6)	Save the prefilteration image as I^I,<br>
7)	Compute the average image intensity value<br>
(MEAN_BEFORE) of I before filtering<br>
Because the MR image data has 12-bit precision, 4095/MAX_ORIGINAL is used for scaling  The image I1  is used in an intermediate blending operation described below, while the stored image I2 is used for a final blending operation also to be described below<br>
As indicated by decision block 2 04, either of two directional smoothing functions is performed on the image data  The choice is one of the 18 control parameters described above  One choice ("1") is a directional smoothing function indicated by process block 206 in which a simultaneous direction smoothing operation is applied to the image I  This simultaneous smoothing operation is described in L S Davis, "A Survey of Edge-Detection Techniques," Computer Graphics and Image Processing, volume 4, pp  248-270, 1975   It employs the following steps<br>
1)   Scan the image in the raster format one time<br>
2)	At each image pixel, consider four 1-dimensional 3x1 filters in all the four directions (45°, 135°, 90°,0°)<br>
3)	At each direction, compute the mean value and the variance of the 3 corresponding pixels<br>
4)	Determine the direction which gives the minimum variance and choose the corresponding mean value for the subsequent calculations<br>
5)	This new pixel value at the given location (x,y) is thus modified according to the equation<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
By design, this process smooths along the line structures and edges but not across them  The border pixels in a given image have to be treated differently and are set to zero in the processed image<br>
The other choice ("2") at decision block 204 is a sequential smoothing function indicated by process block 208  The smoothing function is applied to the image I and its function is described in P  Chan and J S Lim, "One-Dimensional Processing for Adaptive Image Restoration," IEEE Transactions In Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, volume 33, pp  117-126, Feb  1985  This sequential smoothing function employs the following steps<br>
1)	Scan the image in the raster format four times<br>
2)	At each pixel, consider four 1-dimensional 3x1 filters in all the four directions (45°, 135°, 90°, 0°) sequentially<br>
3)	For one direction, compute the mean value and the variance of the 3 corresponding pixels and use these for the subsequent calculations<br>
4)	If the variance (var) is greater than a preselected noise variance (nvar), then set var=var-nvar, otherwise, set var=0<br>
5)	The new pixel value at the given location<br>
(x,y) is thus modified according to the equation<br>
0(x,y)=mean+(I(x,y)-mean)*(var/var+nvar), where 0(x,y) is a temporary image  After all the points in the image are processed, set I(x,y) = 0(x,y) at every point (x,y)<br>
6)	Repeat steps 3-5 for all the remaining<br>
direction angles<br>
With this filter function the amount of smoothing can be controlled using a single parameter, nvar Since this is a sequential direction filtering, it is not cumulative  However, this approach has been found to produce minimal smoothing across edges while producing an overall stronger smoothing effect while preserving edges  The border pixels in a given image have to be treated differently and are set equal to zero in the processed image<br>
Regardless of which smoothing function is performed, the next step in the filter framework is to determine if the image edges are to be sharpened as indicated at process block 210   If they are, a directional sharpening and segmentation function is performed at process block 212  The functions performed by this filter function include the following<br>
1)	The 1-D Laplacian of the image at every pixel<br>
in each of the 4 directions (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°) is<br>
obtained using the equation<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
where the index x refers to the current location along a given direction, E(k) is the edge strength and I(k) is the intensity value at the pixel<br>
2)	After computing all the four edge strengths at a given pixel, determine the maximum directional edge strength and use it in the subsequent steps as the edge strength E(x,y) at that location<br>
3)	Continue this process for all the pixels in the image Border pixels in a given image have to be treated differently and are set equal to zero for the subsequent steps<br>
4)	Smooth the edges of image E(x,y) to produce a smoothed edge strength image ES(x,y) by performing the following steps<br><br>
a)	Scan the image E(x,y) in the raster format one time<br>
b)	At each pixel, consider four 1-dimensional 3x1 filters in all the four directions (45°, 135°, 90°, 0°)<br>
c)	At each direction, compute the mean value and the variance of the 3 corresponding pixels<br>
d)	Determine the direction which gives the minimum variance and choose the corresponding mean value for the subsequent calculations<br>
e)	The new pixel value at the given location (x,y) is thus modified according to the equation<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
5)	Determine the maximum and the minimum values of ES(x,y)   Select the greater of the absolute value of the maximum and the minimum as parameter MAX<br>
6)	Compute the threshold value using the equation<br>
threshold=MAX/threshold_parameter, where threshold_parameter is one of the eighteen selectable parameters<br>
7)	In this step computations are performed based<br>
on decisions made using another one of the eighteen<br>
selectable parameters called segment_parameter  The<br>
decision logic also creates a mask called mask(x,y)<br>
The parameters HPF_attenuated_parameter and HPF_unattenuated_parameter are also user selectable These are used to essentially control the amount of edge strength image ES(x,y) added back to the smoothed image I(x,y) based on the segmentation criterion as determined in the following<br>
a)	If segment_parameter=l, perform the following<br>
if (ES(x,y)
set mask{x,y)=l, and<br>
set I(x,y)=1(x,y)+ES(x,y)*HPF_attenuated_parameter, or if ES(x,y)&gt;threshold)<br>
set mask(x,y)=0, and<br>
set I(x,y)«I(x,y)+ES(x,y)*HPF_unattenuated_parameter,<br>
b)	If segment_parameter=2, perform the following<br>
if (ES(x,y))&gt;=-threshold)<br>
set mask(x,y)=l, and<br>
set I(x,y)=1(x,y)+ES(x,y)*HPF_attenuated_parameter, or if(ES(x,y)
et mask(x,y)=0, and<br>
set I(x,y)=1(x,y)+ES(x,y)*HPF_unattenuated_parameter, c)   If segment_parameter=3, perform the following if(abs(ES(x,y))
set mask(x,y)=1, and<br>
set I(x,y)=1(x,y)+ES(x,y)*HPF_attenuated_parameter or if(abs ES(x,y))=threshold)<br>
set mask(x.y)=0, and<br>
set I(x,y)=1(x,y)+ES(x,y)*HPF_unattenuated_parameter<br>
At the completion of the sharpening and segmentation process 212 we have differentially enhanced strong edges and weak edges and the image is separated into strong edge regions and weak edge regions<br>
As indicated by process block 214, the next function to be performed is a blending and rescalmg operation in which the filtered imaged I(x,y) is combined with the stored prefiltered image I(x,y) and the combined image is rescaled  This operation includes the following steps<br>
1)	The filtered image I(x,y) and the<br>
prefllteration image Ix(x,y) are blended using the<br>
equation<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
 where alpha is<br>
one of the selectable parameters such that 0<alpha></alpha>
2)	Compute the average pixel intensity<br>
(MEAN_AFTER) in the blended image I(x,y)<br>
3)	Compute the normalization factor NORM_FACTOR=MEAN_BEFORE/MEAN_AFTER<br>
4)	Compute the normalized image using I(x,y)=(I(x,y)*NORM_FACTOR)+MIN_ORIGINAL,<br>
where MIN_ORIGINAL is the minimum intensity of the original image<br>
5)   Set the value of image Ix(x,y) to be equal to image I(x,y)<br>
At the completion of process 214, a test is made at decision block 216 to determine if all the passes through the filter framework are complete  In the preferred embodiment three passes are performed by branching back to process block 202 to repeat all the selected filter functions on the image I(x,y)   The filter functions performed need not be the same during each pass  For example, it has been found that the best results are achieved when the simultaneous directional smoothing function 202 is performed during the first pass and the directional sharpening function 212 is performed during the final pass  Other than these, the operator can choose any functions during each iteration to achieve the desired effects<br>
The final function performed by the filter framework is a segmentation-based blending as indicated at process block 218  The purpose of this function is to maintain the texture of the original image in regions where there are no edges d e  low edge strength)   The final image If(x,y) is obtained by blending the filtered image I(x,y) and the prefllteration image I2(x,y) using the equation<br>

where alpha_f; and beta_f are two of the eighteen selectable parameters and mask(x,y) is produced by process block 212 described above Depending upon the selection of the parameters alphs_f and beta_f used in this process, one can obtain adaptive grey level compression and expansion Various visual effects can thus be obtained as follows<br>
if (alpha_f+beta_f)=1, no grey scale compression or expansion is performed,<br>
if (alpha_f+beta_f)&gt;1, grey scale compression occurs to provide an overall smoothing effect<br>
If (alpha__f +beta_f) 
There are 18 user selectable parameters for use in the preferred embodiment of the filter framework Various visual effects are produced by different combinations of these parameters   In the following description the parameters are indicated as P[i], where I indicates the parameter number<br>
P[l]<br>
Description Sets the upper limit for the sharpening<br>
process   This can be set equal to 4095 for 12-bit<br>
images<br>
Range  4000 - 6000,<br>
P[2]<br>
Description Dampening factor to prevent weak edge<br>
amplification  This is set to 0 1 in the preferred<br>
embodiment<br>
Range  0<p></p>
P[3] and P[4]<br>
Description Fractional texture blended from original image to weak edge regions of filtered image in the final stage of processing as determined by the segmentation mask  Set P[3] and P[4] appropriately to avoid "smushmess" while providing overall smoothness Range  0
Description Multiplication factor<br>
(HPF_unattenuated_factor) to the edge image for adding edges back to the filtered image in the final pass Select this parameter high (&gt;0 2) to increase overall sharpness of strong edges  Never set   this parameter equal   to zero  to avoid missing out on  the segmentation step<br>
Range  0 00001 
Description Multiplication factor<br>
(HPF_unattenuated_factor) to the edge image for adding edges back to the filtered image in the penultimate iteration (pass number 2 in the preferred embodiment) Use this parameter if additional edge enhancement boost is needed for tasks such as making the dark structures darker and white edges whiter  This parameter can also be used to put some texture back in images while providing higher overall smoothness to the image Range  0 0 
Description Variance threshold for the first, the second and the third passes to control the amount of<br>
smoothmg  These values are useful if and only if<br>
directional smoothing 2 is used  Setting these values<br>
too high tends to blur the image<br>
Range     0   1
0   1
P[10],   P[ll],   P[12]<br>
Description These parameters represent the fractional<br>
post-pass filtered image blended in with pre-pass<br>
filtered image for each of the three passes<br>
Range Range 0
P[13], P[14], P[15]<br>
Description Dampening factors (HPF_attenuated_factors)<br>
to prevent weak edges amplification in each of three<br>
iterations,<br>
Range     Range     0
P[16]<br>
Description Control parameter to decide during which<br>
iteration directional smoothing 2 (block E) should be<br>
done instead of directional smoothing 1 (block D)<br>
Always use directional smoothing 1 for the first pass<br>
and use either of the smoothing schemes for the<br>
remaining passes<br>
Range     1
P[17]<br>
Description Reciprocal of this parameter<br>
(threshold_parameter) is multiplied to the maximum edge<br>
strength to determine the threshold for segmentation of<br>
the image into strong and weak edge regions<br>
Range     1
P[18]<br>
Description This parameter (segment_parameter) determines which of the three segmentation modes is to be applied for filtering  The parameter is set equal to 1 when the user needs the white edges but not the black edges to be emphasized  The parameter is set to 2 when the black edges but not the white edges have to be emphasized  The parameter is set to 3 when all edges have to be emphasized Range  1
While there are millions of possible parameter combinations, all of them are not useful  Therefore, it is important to tune parameters to get the desired filtering effects   In order to achieve these effects, the following guidelines can be used<br>
Strong edge regions  In general, for noisy images, the strong edges must be emphasized or kept the same as in the original  Smoothing can be performed along a strong edge, but should never be performed across it This is important to avoid blurring of details in the image which is undesirable in medical images<br>
Weak edge region As a rule of thumb, weak edge regions must be attenuated  Sharpening the weak edge regions in general increases the chance of noise amplification and the appearance of "worms" in MR images  The texture in these regions must be maintained to have natural appearance in order to avoid "smudging" and "smushing" of pixel intensities<br>
The following are exemplary parameter sets for use in the preferred embodiment of the invention to achieve specific visual effects<br>

The invented filter provides a framework of selectable functions which when used in a multi-pass manner provide a variety of filtering functions that are performed in an efficient manner using 3x1 one-dimensional computations   This framework is capable of producing smoothing and sharpening depending upon edge strength of the region and it therefore produces varying filtration effects which are considered useful by radiologists  Since the weak edge regions are<br>
attenuated but never completely removed and strong edges are always smoothed along but never across, visually pleasing results can be obtained Furthermore, the framework provides multilevel control to obtain sharpness and smoothness  Examples of the parameter combinations illustrate various visual effects that can be achieved using the present invention with high field MR images  Results indicate the proposed framework will also work well for all MRI systems with different strengths, but the parameter values should be separately tuned to obtain optimal results<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
