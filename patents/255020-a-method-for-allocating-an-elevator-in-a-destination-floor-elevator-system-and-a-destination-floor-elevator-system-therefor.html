ELEVATOR ARRANGEMENT FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to elevator systems. In particular, the present invention relates to a method for allocating an elevator in a destination floor ele vator system which comprises: an elevator group com prising several elevators, a passenger data terminal for reserving elevators for use by passengers, and an elevator group control system for controlling the ele vators that responds to signals from the said passenger data terminal.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In destination floor elevator systems, each passenger wanting to enter an elevator gives at the building's landing level the destination floor to which he/she wants to travel. The destination floor is given by us ing a passenger data terminal specially reserved for this purpose, such a terminal being an extended version of a landing call button. The actual landing call but ton has been extended by adding a more versatile user interface allowing the user, i.e. the passenger, to in dicate the floor that he/she wants to reach by eleva tor.<br>
A destination floor elevator system like this and the passenger data terminal used in it for calling an ele vator involve certain drawbacks. These drawbacks become apparent especially in an up-peak traffic situation, particularly in the mornings and at lunch time. These drawbacks include the following.<br>
Especially during lunch hours, people using the build ings often go to lunch in groups with their own col leagues. However, in a prior-art destination floor ele vator system, each passenger traveling on an elevator<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT/FI2005/000048<br>
2<br>
has to input his/her own destination floor to the des tination floor elevator system independently. This naturally means that each passenger has to wait inde pendently for his/her particular elevator allocated specially for him/her, although the passenger wants go to the same destination floor as another person belong ing to the same group with him/her. A problem now arises as to how the users should behave in such a situation. Should each user stand in queue and await his/her own turn in order to give a call via the pas-senger data terminal and indicate his/her own destina-tion floor to the destination floor elevator system. Further, even if the passenger should await his/her own turn in order to carry out these tasks via the passen-ger data terminal, he/she has to carry out these tasks and input his/her data. This takes time, on an average at least five seconds. On the other hand, if passengers do not await their own turn in order to input their destination floors to the destination floor elevator system and its passenger data terminal, then the eleva tor system will receive incomplete information as to the number of passengers actually traveling to a given destination floor.<br>
In such a situation, the incomplete information re ceived by the destination floor elevator system and es pecially its control system results in an impairment of the level of service provided by the elevator system to the passengers. It is obvious that if: the elevator sys tem had more accurate information regarding the number of passengers going to each destination floor, the ele vators and the elevator system would, be able to serve these passengers better. In prior-art solutions, the problem is that the elevators are filled prematurely and in an uncontrolled manner because not all members of a group traveling together let the system know that<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT/FI2005/000048<br>
3<br>
they are going to travel on the same elevator with the other members of the group.<br>
Furthermore, even if the passengers should behave in a conventional destination floor elevator system like this in the manner described in the above-described ideal case, in other words, if each passenger awaited his/her own turn in order to use the passenger data terminal and gave accurate information regarding his/her own destination floor, there are still draw backs apparent in this procedure. It is obvious that each passenger has to spend a specific amount of time, approximately five seconds, to input information con cerning his/her destination floor and whether he/she belongs to a group. This means that the queues of peo ple awaiting their turn at the passenger data terminal grow longer. An additional delay arises from the fact that the passenger can only indicate his/her destina tion floor when it is his/her turn to use the passenger data terminal and not immediately e.g. upon arrival in the building or when there appears a need for him/her to go to a given destination floor. Therefore, the in formation regarding the. number of passengers and their destination floors reaches the destination floor eleva tor system and especially its control system later than would be necessary, and so the elevator allocation de cisions have to be made on the basis of insufficient and belated information. As a consequence of this, the elevator allocation decisions are made with a delay and their quality is lower than in an ideal situation.<br>
OBJECT OP THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to implement a method and a system for allocating an elevator in a destination floor elevator system so that the above-mentioned problems encountered in prior-art solutions are avoided.<br><br>

The method and system of the invention are character ized by what is disclosed in the characterization parts of claims 1 and 17. Other embodiments of the invention are characterized by what is disclosed in the other claims. Inventive embodiments are also presented in the description part of the present application.

In this case, some of the attributes contained in the claims below . may be superfluous from the point of view of separate inventive concepts. Within the framework of the basic concept of the invention, features of differ ent embodiments of the invention can be applied in con junction with other embodiments.<br>
As for- the features of the invention,., reference is. made to the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The principal idea of the invention is to make it pos sible for a passenger using an elevator to indicate that he/she belongs to a group traveling at the same time from a landing level to one or more destination floors. Thus, according to the invention, when giving his/her destination floor, the passenger can also in form the system that he/she belongs to a group. This information is input using a passenger data terminal. In particular, the passenger data terminal may have a user interface with a menu or key for indicating that the passenger belongs to a group. It is also possible that only one of the members of the group inputs infor mation to the passenger data terminal, telling the sys-<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT/FI2005/000048<br>
5<br>
tern how many members of the group are traveling to the destination floor. Thus, the destination, floor elevator system and especially its elevator group control system receives information as to how many passengers are traveling from the landing level to the destination floor. The elevator system can now send an elevator that has a sufficient space for the whole group of pas sengers, or if necessary, the elevator system can send several elevators for the whole group.<br>
The advantages of the present invention include the following:<br>
The process of calling an elevator at a landing level or landing floor is accelerated in a situation where a group of passengers want to have a ride on the same elevator. In this case only one member of the group needs to define the size of the group and the desired destination floor.<br>
Further, the system of the invention ensures that the passengers traveling in the same group can actually use the same elevator, so their group will remain coherent.<br>
Further, the method of the invention shortens the queues formed at the passenger data terminal on the landing level, because it is not necessary for all the passengers comprised in the group to per-sonally input a call for an elevator, but it suffices that one of the members of the group does so. Therefore, the queue in front of the passenger data terminal is substantially shortened. This means an increased degree of traveling comfort of passengers as there is less waiting and an noyance .<br>
The solution disclosed also provides the advantage that the elevator allocation system receives the information<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT7FI2005/000048<br>
6<br>
regarding the number of passengers in the group and their destination floor at an earlier stage, so that a correct number of available elevators can be directed to the landing level more quickly than in prior-art so lutions. At the same time, the information available regarding the numbers of passengers and their destina tion floors is more accurate, allowing the service level of the elevator system to be further improved. An additional advantage of the solution of the invention is that possible identification of an up-peak traffic condition can be performed, earlier, because the identi fication of a peak traffic condition may occur in re sponse to a large group size that a passenger has given while calling an elevator; for a group by means of a passenger data terminal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 presents a flow diagram of the operation of the method of the invention. The method for allocating an elevator is implemented in a destination floor elevator system which comprises an elevator group consisting of several elevators, a passenger data terminal for re serving elevators for use by passengers and an elevator group control system for controlling the elevators, said control system responding to signals from said passenger data terminal. A feature typical of the des tination floor elevator system is that a passenger data<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT/FI2005/000048<br>
7<br>
terminal is provided on the landing level of the build ing, i.e. on the floor where people arriving in the building enter to wait for elevator transport to their respective destination floors. Via the passenger data terminal, the passenger informs the system about his/her wish to travel to a given destination floor. Destination floor refers to that floor in the building that the passenger wants to reach.<br>
Execution of the method of the invention starts from step 101. In the method of the invention, the size and destination floor of the group traveling together are input 103 to the control system, of the elevator group. This is often done by the passenger, but it is also possible that another person, e.g. a member of the ser vice personnel in the building does it. Having received information regarding the passenger's destination, the passenger data terminal sends this information to the elevator group control system. The elevator group con trol system allocates 105 a suitable elevator to the group of passengers. In the method of the invention, one or more elevators are allocated to the group of passengers, using the aforesaxd group size and the aforesaid destination floor. That is to say, if the group can not be transported by one elevator, then sev eral elevators are allocated to it. After this, the members of the group of passengers are informed 107 about the allocation. This information can be given via the aforesaid passenger data terminal. Another possi bility is to communicate the information by using an illuminated indicator board. Such a board may be dis posed in a space communicating with the landing level where passengers wait for the elevators. The informa tion can also be communicated as an announcement given by a person or machine.<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT/FI2005/000048<br>
8<br>
In the method of the invention, the allocation proce dure, in which one or more elevators are allocated to a group of passengers, is carried out e.g. by optimizing elevator operation factors and/or the efficiency of passenger service. Operation factors and efficiency of passenger service refer e.g. to one or more of the fol lowing factors: utilization ratio of elevator, energy consumption of elevator, call time, waiting time and traveling time. It is also obvious that the allocation can also be implemented using e.g. a suitable mathe matical algorithm.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the allocation is implemented by placing the entire group of passengers in as small a number of elevators as possible. A second embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the group size is limited. It is also possible that the size of the group is not lim ited.<br>
In the method of the Invention, after the allocation one or more of the allocated elevators are reserved 109 for use by the group at the landing level. This means that the elevators are directed to the floor in ques tion so that they can be used by the group waiting for them.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, identification of a peak traffic condition is performed in response to the group size which is input to the passenger data termi nal by a passenger. This identification is used in the elevator group control system to change the control of the elevators in such manner that they are controlled in the way the elevators are controlled in a peak traf fic condition. This may mean e.g. that elevators are sent to the landing level more frequently and quickly<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT/FI2005/000048<br>
9<br>
than calls for elevators are received from there. This ensures that the landing level will not be congested.<br>
Fig. 2 presents a diagram of the user interface 201 of a passenger data terminal 200 according to the inven tion. Such a passenger data terminal 200 is intended to be placed e.g. in the entrance hall of the building, at the landing level. The passenger data terminal 200 may be one of the following devices: a passenger data ter minal in general use, a mobile station, a terminal in a data communication network, a terminal in a telecommu nication network and/or a wireless terminal.<br>
The group size and the destination floor are input via the passenger data terminal 200. This information is typically" input by a passenger. It is also possible that the information is input by a person appointed to perform this task, e.g. the janitor of the building, a guard or other member of the service personnel.<br>
In the method and system of the invention, the size and destination of the group of passengers are input in re sponse to a prompt 2 03 given to the user. This prompt 2 03 can be given to the user via the passenger, data terminal 200.<br>
In the method and system, the size and destination of the group of passengers are input by using the user in terface 201 of the passenger data terminal. This user interface 201 of the passenger data terminal comprises at least one of the following: group size indicator 205, push button 207, group key 209, window user inter face 2 01 and/or keys 211 for defining the size of the group.<br>
Fig. 3 presents an operation diagram of the destination floor elevator system according to the invention, which<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT/FI2005/000048<br>
10<br>
comprises: an elevator group 301 consisting of a number of elevators 303, 304, a passenger data terminal 305 for reserving elevators for use by the passengers. The system also comprises an elevator group control system 3 07 for controlling the elevators which responds to signals from the passenger data terminal 305. The ele vator group control system 3 07 directs elevators to de sired floors on the basis of the car calls received from the elevators and the landing calls received from different floors as well as the destination floor and group size data received from the passenger data termi nal 3 05. In the control of the elevators, the elevator group control system 307 utilizes algorithms appropri ate to the purpose.<br>
In the destination floor elevator system of the inven tion, the passenger data terminal 3 05 has been arranged to receive the., size and destination floor of the group of passengers and to send this information further to the elevator group control system 307. The elevator group control system 307 has been arranged to allocate one or more elevators to_ the group, of passengers, using as basic data the size of the group and the destination floor that the members of the group wish to reach by elevator. The passenger data terminal 305 has been ar ranged to inform the members of the group of passengers regarding elevator allocation performed.<br>
In this destination floor elevator system, especially on the landing level, the size and destination floor of the group are input via the passenger data terminal 3 05. The passenger data terminal may be one of the fol lowing devices: a passenger data terminal in general use, a mobile station, a terminal in a data communica tion network, a. terminal in a telecommunication network and/or a wireless terminal. Thus, it is to be noted that, utilizing a telecommunication and data communica-<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT/FI2005/000048<br>
11<br>
tion network, it is possible to provide in the user in terface of the passenger's mobile terminal or computer an option to reserve an elevator for a desired trip for a desired group of passengers.<br>
In the method and system of the invention, the input of the size and destination floor of the group of passen gers takes place in response to a prompt given to the user. The prompt can be given via the user interface of the passenger data terminal. Further, the size and des tination floor of the group of passengers can be input by using the user interface of the passenger data ter minal .<br>
The destination floor elevator system of the invention is characterized in that the aforesaid user interface of the passenger data terminal comprises at least one of the following items: group size indicator, push but ton, group key, window user interface and/or keys for defining the group size.<br>
In the destination floor elevator system of the inven tion, the elevators are allocated e.g. by optimizing elevator operation factors and/or the efficiency of passenger service. Operation factors and efficiency of passenger service refer e.g. to one or more of the fol lowing factors: utilization ratio of elevator, energy consumption of elevator, call time, waiting time and traveling time. It is also obvious that the allocation can also be implemented using e.g. a suitable mathe matical algorithm.<br>
When passengers are to be placed in elevators in the destination floor elevator system of the invention, the allocation of elevators to different users or passen gers is performed by placing the whole group of passen gers in as small a number of elevators as possible. It<br><br>
WO 2005/070804	PCT/FI2005/000048<br>
12<br>
is also possible that the size of a group traveling to gether is limited.<br>
In practice, after the allocation of elevators in the destination floor elevator system of the invention, one or more of the allocated elevators is/are reserved for use toy the group of passengers at the landing level. Passengers, especially groups of passengers, are in formed about the allocation of elevators via -the pas senger data terminal. It is also possible to give this information by using an illuminated indicator board. It is likewise possible to communicate the information as a public announcement, which can be implemented e.g. by a speech synthesizer or the service personnel of the building.<br>
In the destination floor elevator system of the inven tion, it is also possible that an up-peak traffic con dition is identified in response to group size. This means that when a passenger calling an elevator gives the group size as a number exceeding a threshold value, this may be regarded as an indicator of the onset of an up-peak traffic condition. This identification of an up-peak traffic situation may also be conditional so that it is only implemented during certain periods, e.g. on weekdays in the morning between 07.30-09.20 and during lunch hours between 11.15-14.00.<br>
It is obvious to the person skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, in which the invention was described by way of example, but that it may be varied within the scope of the inventive concept defined in the claims presented below.<br><br>
