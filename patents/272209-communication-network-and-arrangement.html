				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a communication network, method and unit for improving<br>
performance of radio communication and in particular to a multi path solution using a<br>
plurality of neighbouring communication enabled devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is an ever increasing demand for available bandwidth and radio resources in<br>
wireless communication. Currently, the wireless communication field is one of the most<br>
expansive development and deployment fields within the communication arena. However,<br>
wireless communication have several drawbacks and inherent problems that limit the<br>
amount of available bandwidth and radio resources since they operate in an open field<br>
with competing radio resources, disturbing objects and disturbing environments, and limits<br>
to the amount of radio traffic that can be employed at the same time within a given area.<br>
One way of decreasing the effect of disturbing environment may be to use antenna<br>
diversity, i.e. essentially two antennas receiving the same signal and in a smart way<br>
analysing the signals from these two antennas in order to acquire a large signal to noise<br>
ratio (SNR). This demands devices with two (or more antennas) which may increase cost<br>
and geometrical size of the devices. Using two or more antennas in one device for<br>
transmitting signals it is possible to use different radio channels and therefore potentially<br>
increase the available bandwidth for that device; again this increases the cost and size of<br>
the device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a device, method, and system that may<br>
increase transmission and receiving redundancy and/or increase the bandwidth for the<br>
device.<br>
 <br>
Some attempts to enhance the bandwidth utilization have been done, for instance:<br>
In EP1113592 a communication method is disclosed that is used when a mobile station<br>
receives a signal from a base station, In the method signals to a mobile station is<br>
transmitted using one or several other mobile stations. This solution provides a solution<br>
where other mobile units within the same cell transmit data downstream to a mobile<br>
station in a relaying manner; i.e. the relaying mobile stations receive communication<br>
from the base station and determines the destination and retransmits this towards the<br>
final destination.<br>
In DE10027115 OFDM radio access technology nas relay stations to send uplink and<br>
downlink signals from a centra! station onwards to user terminals with relay selection<br>
based on transmission of measured signal data to the central station. In this document<br>
also a relaying function is discussed.<br>
WO0237771 discloses methods and systems using short link radios (SLRs) with mobile<br>
terminals are disclosed. A mobile terminal having a SLR connects to other mobile<br>
terminals having SLRs over a SLR link to increase the throughput, the QoS, or both of<br>
the system. The mobile terminals establish a SLR link between a first mobile terminal<br>
and a second mobile terminal. Both mobile terminals receive data transmitted from a<br>
base station intended for the first mobile terminal The second mobile terminal then<br>
retransmits the data received by the second mobile terminal to the first mobile terminal<br>
via the SLR link.<br>
EP1545076 discloses a method ana apparatus for improving a network. The network<br>
uses the energy from a vehicle battery or vehicle generator to power an intermediate<br>
transmitted device that receives the signal from a portable wireless device and<br>
retransmits the information in the signal to a base station. The intermediate transmitter<br>
device also receives information from the base station and retransmits the information to<br>
the portable wireless device. The described system expands the areas in which a<br>
wireless device may be used.<br>
In US2003220074 a portable wireless system is described. The portable wireless system<br>
has a controller that is operable to selectively configure the portable wireless system as<br>
 <br>
a personal electronic appliance or a third party wireless repeater that is configured to<br>
relay wireless signals between a third party electronic appliance and a wireless network<br>
Accordingly, the portable wireless system (e.g., a cellular telephone, a pager or a<br>
personal digital assistant) may act as a wireless repeater for third party wireless<br>
communications when the portable wireless system otherwise is not in use. In this way,<br>
the portable wireless system increases the utilization of existing wireless network<br>
infrastructures (e.g., a cellular telephone network) by making one or more unused<br>
wireless channels available to other devices, A novel incentives-based business model<br>
that encourages owners of portable electronic appliances to fully utilize existing wireless<br>
network capacity also is described,<br>
In "Position assisted reraying and handover in hybrid ad hoc WCDMA cellular systems"<br>
by Jung Houn Yap et at at "Personal, indoor and mobile radio communications, 2C02,<br>
the 13th IEEE International Symposium on Sept, 15-18, Piscataway, NJ, USA, IEEE, vol<br>
5, 15 September 2002, pages 2194-2198, a solution with relaying mobile stations are<br>
discussed,<br>

communication data and/or packet inspection analysis is needed to determine the final<br>
destination of the data.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Basically, the invention emulates a MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) terminal which<br>
allows using transmission schemes involving several radio channels, without incorporating<br>
several antennas in same device, which will be detailed in the following description of the<br>
exemplary embodiments.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a communication network system 100 according to the present invention<br>
including a mobile wireless unit 10, e.g. a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant<br>
(PDA), a mobile computer, or a mobile music platform (e.g. an MP3 player), and a<br>
number of different peripheral devices such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) 20, a<br>
laptop 30, and a printer 40. The network system comprises a central communication<br>
device 50 connected to a network 120. The communication device 10 may be connected<br>
to a base station 50 or transceiver of the network.<br>
The mobile unit 10 is arranged to communicate with the different peripheral devices 20,<br>
30, and 40 using one or several of different available communication interfaces, for<br>
instance a wireless (e.g. Bluetooth) link 60 to the PDA 20, a USB link 70 to the laptop 30,<br>
and an Ethernet link 80 to the printer 40. The mobile unit 10 is arranged to mainly<br>
establish a wireless communication link 90 with the central communication device 50<br>
(such as a 2G, 2.5G, or 3G base station; "G" stands for generation, i.e. 2G means second<br>
generation mobile telephony systems and so on) for transmitting and receiving<br>
communication signals to/from the network 120 using any type of suitable link 110<br>
between the central communication device 50 and the network 120. All devices including<br>
the mobile unit 10 and the peripheral devices 20, 30, 40 utilize the same communication<br>
type towards the central communication device 50 (e.g. a base station).<br>
To employ the teachings of the invention, each peripheral device comprises an air<br>
interface for RF communication with the network. The interface may be an internal or<br>
external cell phone or the like. In the laptop, for example, a PC-card including a<br>
transceiver can be used. The modern PDA's usually also include a cell phone ability and<br>
so on. It should be noted that all devices able of communicating wirelessly with the<br>
network, must have a unique identity within the local network formed by the mobile unit 10<br>
and the different peripheral devices 20, 30, 40 in a conventional way. However, with<br>
respect to the base station 50 all devices should have the same ID so as to provide a<br>
 <br>
single interface towards the base station 50. The base station then believes that it is<br>
communicating with a single mobile unit 10 with a plurality of antennas.<br>
In this manner a plurality of radio links 90 and radio channels may be established to the<br>
central communication device 50 increasing the available bandwidth and/or providing<br>
redundancy using peripheral devices 20, 30 and 40, acting as access converters or<br>
access relays. These peripheral devices 20, 30 and 40 may be any type of equipment that<br>
can communicate with the mobile unit 10, such as the mentioned PDA, laptop, or printer,<br>
but also for instance a docking station, battery charging devices, other mobile units,<br>
storage devices, music platform devices (e.g. an MP3 player), telephones, set top boxes<br>
for digital audio and/or video, routers, wireless data communication devices (e.g. WLAN,<br>
WPAN, and other similar devices).<br>
The mobile unit 10 may communicate with different peripherals using a plurality of<br>
communication links, such as IR (infrared), Bluetooth, WLAN (Wireless Local Area<br>
Network), e.g. from the IEEE 802.11, 802.15, and 802.16 families, Ethernet, serial or<br>
parallel communication, USB (Universal Serial Bus), Firewire (IEEE 1394), or optical<br>
communication solutions. However, the communication links between the devices are not<br>
limited to the above mentioned types, but any other suitable communication link solution<br>
now existing or future developments may be used as understood by the person skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
The communication links between the mobile unit 10 and the peripheral devices 20, 30,<br>
40 on one side and the central communication device 50 may be as mentioned earlier<br>
using 2G, 2.5G, and 3G, but also future similar wireless communication links. One<br>
important aspect of the invention is that the link between the mobile unit 10 and the<br>
central communication device 50 is of the same type as between the peripheral devices<br>
20, 30, 40 and the central communication device 50.<br>
With the term 2G is meant GSM (Global System for Mobile communication), CDMA (Code<br>
Division Multiple Access), or similar low data rate communication links, with 2.5G is meant<br>
any type of intermediate data rate communication link such as GPRS (General Packet<br>
Radio Service) and EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution), and with 3G is<br>
meant higher data rate communication links such as UMTS (Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System), CDMA2000, or WCDMA (wideband CDMA).<br>
 <br>
Turning now to Fig. 2 illustrating a mobile unit 200 according to the present invention<br>
comprises a processing unit 201, a storage unit 202, an interface unit 203, at least one<br>
communication unit 204, a first communication interface 205 and a plurality of peripheral<br>
communication interfaces 206, 207, and 208. The mobile unit further comprises an<br>
identification arrangement 209 for uniquely identifying it in the network. The identification<br>
arrangement can be a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card, IMSI (International Mobile<br>
Subscriber Identity), or any other unique identifier. The processing unit 201 has instruction<br>
sets for different operations and functions available in the mobile unit, e.g. for interfacing<br>
with the user, address and phone register, coding and decoding of voice and/or data, and<br>
many other normal operations and functions normally available in mobile units. However,<br>
according to the present invention, additional instruction sets for handling and processing<br>
the signals incoming from the peripheral devices received and relayed from the<br>
communication network are provided. The storage unit 202 may be provided for storing<br>
data permanently and/or temporarily, such as an address and phone register, user<br>
information and so on. The interface unit 203 may be provided for interfacing with a user<br>
via a keypad and an LCD screen or similar. The communication unit 204 may be provided<br>
for handling communication related issues such as deciding on which communication<br>
interface to use depending on type of data to send or receive (including digital data and<br>
voice data). The first communication interface 205 handles a wireless interface used as a<br>
main communication link, for instance 2.5G or 3G interface. The peripheral interface units<br>
206, 207, 208 are used for communication with peripheral equipment, as described<br>
earlier.<br>
The peripheral equipment may be similarly built with similar components as the mobile<br>
unit; however, it should be understood that operations and functions may differ slightly of<br>
course depending on type of equipment.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a schematic of the reception and transmission of signals by the mobile<br>
unit 410. Thus, according to this embodiment, it is assumed that the system of the<br>
invention acts as MIMO emulator, in which the peripheral devices act as additional<br>
antennas. In this case peripheral are denoted with 420, 430 and 440. Each peripheral<br>
device comprises an antenna 421, 431, 441 connected to a transceiver unit (not shown).<br>
The mobile station comprises the interfaces 406-408 for communication with peripherals<br>
as mentioned earlier. Moreover, the antenna 411 of the mobile unit is connected to the<br>
 <br>
processing unit through the interface 405. The processing arrangement 401 receives the<br>
inputs from the interfaces and processes the signals. This is important that the signals are<br>
so processed that the information derived from the signals provides correct result.<br>
The peripherals can be tuned into different channels or same channel as the<br>
communication unit depending on application and how the components interact. In a first<br>
simple application of the present invention, it is utilized as a powerful diversity antenna<br>
solution, where a plurality of antennas send the same signal and thus providing e.g. radio<br>
signal diversity for handling small scale (microscopic) fading. This is useful for any type of<br>
mobile communication solution, including GSM and upwards in the cell phone version<br>
history. It is not necessary to demand any changes of the central communication device<br>
side (e.g. base station) 50, but the invention may be implemented on the mobile unit 10<br>
side only.<br>
For systems where the essential parts of the system network (i.e. on both mobile unit and<br>
base station side) are arranged according to the present invention, it is possible to allow<br>
for multiple bit streams transmitted in parallel. The different bit streams are then separated<br>
by synchronization codes (embedded into the data packets or signaling packets) that are<br>
unique for each bit stream in order to be able to separate the bit streams from each other.<br>
The separation is similar as may be found for direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)<br>
techniques, where orthogonal (or semi-orthogonal) codes are used to separate different<br>
data streams from each other. This type of enhanced data streaming is particularly useful<br>
for the more recent cell phone infrastructure systems, e.g. 2.5G and 3G systems.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 3 wherein a flow diagram illustrates steps of a method according to<br>
the present invention. In a first step 301, the user establishes a communication link with<br>
the base station through the communication device 50 and possibly further up the<br>
communication link channel (depending on the type of the communication link) as<br>
understood by the person skilled in the art. In step 302, either the mobile unit 10 or the<br>
base station (or any other device on the base station side of the communication link)<br>
determines if the available communication rate is sufficient or if there is a need for<br>
increasing this rate. In an optional parallel or subsequent step 303, the system may<br>
determine the quality of the established link (or links) and selects to open additional links<br>
or channels to the devices connected to the mobile unit, to provide redundancy, multiple<br>
streams, or error handling functions. In step 304, the peripheral units 20, 30, 40 are<br>
 <br>
connected to the mobile unit 10 or already established connections are used and in a<br>
subsequent step 305 the mobile unit 10 establishes communication links with the central<br>
communication device 50 via each peripheral unit each using a communication link with<br>
the central communication device 50 in a similar manner as the mobile unit 10. The<br>
mobile unit 10 routes data via the plurality of established communication links (via the<br>
direct first link 90 and/or via links 60, 70, 80 to the peripheral units 20, 30, 40). The traffic<br>
is routed to or from the mobile unit 10 according to a predetermined traffic shaping<br>
function in order to use the peripheral devices 20, 30, 40 in a rate optimal manner, i.e.<br>
depending on data rate of established links either between the mobile unit 10 and each<br>
peripheral unit 20, 30, 40 and/or between each peripheral unit 20, 30, 40 and the central<br>
communication device 50. The mobile unit may also use other parameters in the traffic<br>
shaping function, e.g. battery levels of peripheral units, link quality (such as signal to<br>
noise levels and/or data rate), type of peripheral unit, type of data, ownership of peripheral<br>
units, and so on. In a last step 306, when the communication session is terminated, the<br>
communication links not used are terminated.<br>
In a similar manner, the base station 50 may use established links with the mobile unit 10<br>
directly and/or together with peripheral units 20, 30, 40. There may also be provided a<br>
traffic shaping function at the base station side of the communication link as described<br>
above for the mobile unit using similar types of traffic shaping criteria.<br>
It should be noted that the word "comprising" does not exclude the presence of other<br>
elements or steps than those listed and the words "a" or "an" preceding an element do not<br>
exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. It should further be noted that any<br>
reference signs do not limit the scope of the claims, that the invention may be at least in<br>
part implemented by means of both hardware and software, and that several "means" or<br>
"units" may be represented by the same item of hardware.<br>
The above mentioned and described embodiments are only given as examples and<br>
should not be limiting to the present invention. Other solutions, uses, objectives, and<br>
functions within the scope of the invention as claimed in the below described patent<br>
claims should be apparent for the person skilled in the art.<br>
