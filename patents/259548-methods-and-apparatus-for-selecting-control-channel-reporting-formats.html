The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to performed.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/076037<br><br>
PCT/US2006/049083<br><br>
METnODS AND ATrARATBS-RBLATED TO SELECTING CONTROL CHANNEL REPORTING FORMATS'<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to wireless communications methods and apparatus and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for implementing and using control channels.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]     In multiple access wireless communications systems, multiple wireless terminals are typically in competition for limited air link resources. A wireless terminal, operating in a state supporting uplink and downlink user data traffic signaling, typically tries to routinely communicate control information to a base station attachment point .In some systems control information may be communicated in the form of control information reports which allow the base station attachment point to obtain information about the wireless terminal status and effectively allocate resources. As the popularity and variety of wireless communication services has increased, the need to support ever larger numbers of concurrent users has grown. In addition, events and/or time of day can drive peak concurrent user demand.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/076037<br><br>
PCT/US2006/049083<br><br>
[0003]     Changes in the number of concurrent users can affect the demand for control information communication resources. However, it should also be appreciated that different wireless terminals can have different needs at different times and that the demand forresources in many cases is not simply a matter of the total number of terminals in the system that have the ability to communicate user data to the base station.<br>
[0004]     Different wireless terminals using the same base station attachment point often have different reporting needs and priorities. For example^ a first wireless terminal operating from a current stationary position, with no or minimal obstructions between itself and the base station attachment point, and needing to communicate small amounts of user data infrequently may have very different control information reporting needs than another, e.g., second, wireless terminal, e.g., a mobile node in a moving automobile, experiencing rapidly changing channel conditions and/or needing to communicate large amounts of data frequently. Using a universal single control information reporting format to report control information to a base station although simple to implement can result in inefficiencies due to tradeoffs made to accommodate the wide variety of different types of anticipated concurrent users with reasonable degree of effectiveness.<br>
[0005]     In view of the above, it should be appreciated that there is a need for methods and apparatus which provide flexibility with regard to control information reporting, e.g., flexibility in terms of supported report formats. Improved methods and/or apparatus which tend to match a wireless terminal's current needs and/or conditions to a well suited control information report format would tend to increase efficiency and be beneficial, e.g., in terms of increasing traffic throughput capability. The ability to change control information reporting formats, if it could be supported, could also be useful in some cases.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]    Various embodiments are directed to methods and apparatus related to control information reporting over wireless communication channels including control<br><br><br>

information reporting format alternatives. Selection between various control reporting format alternatives is performed, in some-embodiments, by a wireless terminal and/or a base station.<br>
. [00071    In some exemplary embodiments, a method of operating a first communications device, e.g., a wireless terminal, to interact with a second communications device, e.g., a base station, includes: determining a set of control information reports to be transmitted, e.g., selecting between a plurality of predetermined reporting formats where said set of control information reports corresponds to a reporting format; generating the determined set of control information reports; and communicating said generated set of control information reports. In some such embodiments, the control information reporting format is selected as a function of an application being executed, e.g., a voice application vs a data application. In some embodiments, the control information reporting format is selected as a function of at least one of: device capability information, channel conditions, system loading, and user quality of service information. In some embodiments, the control information reporting format is selected as a function of at least one of a received command signal and a received request signal. An exemplary communications device, e.g., wireless terminal, in accordance with some but not necessarily all embodiments, includes a report format selection module for selecting a reporting format. The reportingformat is one of a plurality of supported reporting formats. The reporting format specifies .a set of report definitions, e.g., one or more report definitions. In some embodiments, the report format also specifies a reporting schedule as part of the report format. In some implementations, the communications device further includes a report generation module for generating a sequence of reports in-accordance with a reporting schedule which is part of a particular selected reporting format and at least one definition in the set of report definitions. The communications device may also include a transmitter for transmitting the generated sequence of reports.<br>

The reporting schedule 328 includes information identifying a sequence of reports to be communicated within a reporting structure, e.g., a predetermined recurring reporting structure, when using reporting format 1. Coding and modulation scheme 332 identifies a coding and modulation scheme to be used to communicate control information reports when using reporting format 1, e.g., BPSK or QPSK, a number of information bits per segment, a number of coded bits per segment, and a mapping between coded bits and modulation •symbols.<br>

Coding and modulation module 360 performs a coding and modulation operation on the generated sequence of reports using a predetermined coding and modulation scheme corresponding to selected reporting format. For example, in one exemplary embodiment for one particular reporting format, a first coding and modulation scheme is used where the sequences of reports are grouped into sets of 6 information bits and the six information bits are coded into 21 QPSK modulation symbols. In the same exemplary embodiment, for another particular reporting format, a second coding and modulatidn scheme is used where the sequence of reports are grouped into sets of 8 information bits, and the eight information bits are coded, into 21 QPSK modulation symbols.

axis 1702 plots logical uplink tone index while horizontal axis 1704 plots the uplink  • index of the halfslot within a beaconslot In this example, an uplink tone block includes<br>
113 logical uplink tones indexed (0	112); there are seven successive OFDM symbol<br>
transmission time periods within a halfslot, 2 additional OFDM symbol time periods followed by 16 successive half-slots within a superslot, and 8 successive superslots within a beacon slot. The first 9 OFDM symbol transmission time periods within a superslot are an access interval, and the dedicated control channel does not use the air link resources of the access interval.<br>
[00105]     The exemplary dedicated control channel is subdivided into 31 logical tones (uplink tone index 81 1706, uplink tone index 82 1708,..., uplink tone index 111<br>
1710). Each logical uplink tone (81	Ill) in the logical uplink frequency structure<br>
corresponds to a logical tone indexed with respect to the DCCH channel (0,..., 30).<br>
[00106]     For each tone in the dedicated control channel there are 40 segments in the beaconslot corresponding to forty columns (1712; 1714,1716, 1718,1720, 1722,..., 1724). The segment structure repeats on a beaconslot basis. For a given tone in the dedicated control channel mere are 40 segments corresponding to a beaconslot 1728; each of the eight superslots of the beaconslot includes 5 successive segments for the given tone. For example, for first superslot 1726 of beaconslot 1728, corresponding to tone 0 of the DCCH, there are five indexed segments (segment [0][0], segment [0][1], segment [0][2], segment[0j[3], segment [0][4]). Similarly, for first superslot 1726 of • beaconslot 1728, corresponding to tone 1 of the DCCH, there are five indexed segments (segment [1][0], segment [1][1], segment [1 ][2], segment [1 ][3], segment [1][4]). Similarly, for first superslot 1726 of beaconslot 1728, corresponding to tone 30 of the DCCH, there are five indexed segments (segment [30][0], segment [30][1], segment [30][2], segment [30][3], segment [30][4]).<br>
[00107]    In this example each segment, e.g., segment [0][0], comprises one tone for 3 successive half-slots, e.g., representing an allocated uplink air link resource of 21 OFDM tone-symbols. In some embodiments, logical uplink tones are hopped to physical tones in accordance with an uplink tone hopping sequence such that the<br>

physical tone associated with a logical tone may be different for successive half-slots, but remains constant during a given half-slot<br>
[00108]     Each logical tone of the dedicated control channel may be assigned by the base station to a different wireless terminal using the base station as its current point of attachment. For example, logical tone (506,508,... ,510) may be currently assigned to (WT A 1730, WT B 1732,..., WT N* 1734), respectively.<br>
[00109]     Each uplink DCCH segment is used to transmit a set of Dedicated Control Channel Reports (DCRs). A list of exemplary. DCRs is given in table 1800 of Figure 18.    First column 1802 of table 1800 describes abbreviated names used for each exemplary report. The name of each report ends with a number which specifies the number of bits of the DCR. Second column 1804 of table 1800 briefly describes each named report<br>

Column 1902 lists the 32 possible information bit patterns for the report, and column 1904 lists a corresponding reported WT measured downlink pilot channel SNR conveyed by the report. A wireless terminal measures downlink pilot channel SNR, determines the SNR reported value possibility closest to the measured value, and then determines the corresponding 5 bit pattern to be reported in the report. Each report in table 1800 has its' own corresponding mapping information.<br>

Some reporting formats may be additional pre-stored reporting formats. Some reporting formats may be custom reporting formats, e.g., tailored for a particular wireless terminal, set of wireless terminals, type of wireless terminal, and/or set of conditions. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, use different numbers of information bits/segment, e.g., 8 information bit/per segment instead of 6 information bits/segment. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, use different modulation schemes. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiment, have a different set of reports used. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, have different orderings and/or frequencies of reports." Some different reporting formats, in some embodiment, intentionally omit certain types of reports. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, have a concentration of certain types of reports. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, use different sets of segments. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, refrain from transmitting of subsets of segments. Some different reporting formats, in some embodiments, have different durations, e.g., different durations of a recurring pattern.<br>

[00115]     In step 2104, the base station determines a set of control information reports to be received, said set of control information reports corresponding to a reporting format Step 2104 includes sub-step 2106. In sub-step 2106, the base station selects between a plurality of predetermined reporting formats. Sub-step 2106 includes one or more of sub-step 2108,2110, and 2112. In sub-step 2108, the base station selects<br>
i<br>
the control information reporting format as a function of an application being executed, e.g., by said base station or said wireless terminal or a peer node in a communications session with said wireless terminal.in some embodiments, the application is one of a   • voice and a data application. In some such embodiments, a reporting format selected in response to a voice application includes a latency report or includes latency information embedded in a traffic channel request report, and a reporting format selected in response to a data application includes less frequent uplink request reports than a reporting format used for voice but more bits per uplink request on average than used for voice. For example, frequently scheduled 1 bit uplink request reports may be used in an exemplary reporting format tailored for a voice application, while less frequently scheduled 3 and/or 4 bit uplink traffic channel request reports may be used in an exemplary reporting format tailored for a data application. In sub-step 2110, the base station selects the control information reporting format as a function of at least one of: device capability information, channel condition information, system loading information, and user quality of service (QoS) information. In sub-step 2112,. the base station selects the control information reporting format as a function of at least one of: a command signal or a request signal received from said wireless terminal.<br>
[00116]     In some embodiments, each of said plurality of predetermined reporting, formats specifies a plurality of different types of reports and an ordering of said different types of reports. In some embodiments, the different reporting types includes at least two of a SNR report, a traffic request report, a power information report, an interference report, and a delay-report, e.g., a latency report. In some embodiments, the reporting format specifies the control information to be communicated in the different types of reports, e.g., counts of frames of traffic backlog with defined quantization,<br>

PCT/US2006/049083<br><br>
SNR level in dB with defined quantization, power gain level in dBs with defined quantization, etc.<br>
100117]     Operation proceeds from step 2104 to step 2114. In step 2114, the base -station receives signals, e.g., dedicated control channel segment OFDM signals, conveying said determined set of reports. Then, in step 2116, the base station performs a demodulation and decoding operation on said received signals to generate sets of ordered information bits, each set of ordered information bits corresponding to a communications segment Step 2116 includes sub-step 2118. In sub-step 2118, the base station uses a predetermined decoding and demodulation scheme corresponding to said reporting format, different decoding and demodulation schemes being used for at least some of said plurality of reporting formats. For example, in one exemplary embodiment one exemplary control information reporting format uses a demodulation and decoding scheme which obtains 6 information bits from 21 QPSK modulation symbols corresponding to a dedicated control channel communications segment; while a different exemplary control information format uses a demodulation and decoding scheme which obtains 8 information bits .from 21 QPSK modulation symbols corresponding to a dedicated control channel communications segment. Operation proceeds from step 2116 to step 2120.<br>
[00118]     In step 2110, the base station maps the ordered bits of a segment to one or more control information reports in accordance with said reporting format. For example, corresponding to one exemplary control information reporting format, a first segment in a recurring structure may convey 6 ordered information bits, and bits 1-5 convey a 5 bit downlink SNR report, while bit 0 (LSb) conveys a 1 bit uplink traffic channel request report. Operation proceeds from step 2120 to step 2122.<br>
[00119]     In step 2122, the base station recovers information from said set of determined control information reports in accordance with said reporting format For example, the bit pattern, e.g., 01110, of a received SNR report may report a pilot channel SNR measurement value, e.g., 2 dB.<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2007/076037<br><br>
PCT/US2006/049083<br><br>
[00120]     Operation proceeds from step 2122 to step 2104, where the base station determines another set of control information reports to be received .by the wireless terminal assuming the wireless terminal is still allocated a dedicated control channel by the base station.<br>
[00121]     In some embodiments, the received signals, e.g., dedicated control channel segment signals, from multiple wireless terminal using the base station are received concurrently, and the control information reporting format for at least some of the different wireless terminals, at at least some times is different For example, a first wireless terminal communicating with the base station may be using a control information reporting format tailored for a voice application, and a second wireless terminal communicating with the base station may be using a control information reporting format tailored to. delay insensitive data communications, e.g., file transfers.<br>
[00122]     Figure 22 is a drawing of a flowchart 2200 of an exemplary method of operating a base station to interact with one or more wireless terminals. For example, the base station and wireless terminal may be part of a multiple access OFDM wireless communications system including a dedicated control channel for uplink control information reports and using dedicated control channel segments. Operation starts in step 2202, where the base station is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 2202 to step 2204, for each wireless terminal of some wireless terminals allocated a dedicated control channel by a base station. In step 2204, the base station -uses a default format as a current reporting format when communicating with said wireless terminal, e.g., as part of an initial communications with the wireless terminal.<br>
[00123] '   Operation proceeds from step 2204 to step 2206, where the base station . performs at least one of receiving and transmitting control information reporting format definition information from a wireless communications link. In some embodiments, a control information reporting format includes reporting format definition information providing definition mapping information to be included in said report to possible report "values. In some embodiments; a control information reporting format includes reporting format definition information defining a reporting schedule according to which reports are to be transmitted. In some embodiments, a control information reporting format<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2007/076037<br><br>
PCT/US2006/049083<br><br>
includes reporting format definition information defining a set of reports which are to be ' transmitted, e.g., by a wireless terminal to the base station, in accordance with the defined reporting schedule. In some embodiments, a control information reporting format includes reporting format definition information specifying a coding and modulation scheme to be applied to the set of reports.<br>
[00124]     Then, in step 2208, the base station checks at least one of device capability information, channel condition information, application information, quality of service information, system loading information, and the reception of a control information format switching command or request from said wireless terminal.<br>
[00125]     In step 2210, the base station decides how to proceed based on the result of the check of step 2208. If the result of the check indicates that the reporting format should be changed, operation proceeds to step 2212; otherwise operation proceeds to step 2214.-<br>
[00126]     In step 2212, the base station switches the current reporting format to a new reporting format, e.g., said new reporting format in accordance with said control information reporting format definition information received or transmitted from a wireless communication link of step 2206. Operation proceeds from step 2212 to step 2214.<br>
[00127] In step 2214, the base station recovers control information corresponding to a received control information report in accordance with the current reporting format Operation proceeds from step 2214 to step 2208, where the base station perform another check.<br>
[00128]     In some embodiments, reporting format information, e.g., corresponding to customized control information reports, is communicated between a base station and a wireless terminal using the base station as its attachment point. In some embodiments, reporting format information corresponding to a wireless terminal is communicated to and/or stored at a centralized server and/or a home agent node. In some such embodiments, state information corresponding to a control information reporting<br>
