NOVEL SUBTILASE ENZYMES HAVING AN IMPROVED WASH PERFORMANCE ON EGG STAINS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel subtilases having an improved wash performance on egg stains. These subtilases are useful exhibiting excellent or improved wash performance on egg stains when used in e.g. cleaning or detergent compositions, such as laundry detergent compositions and dish wash compositions, including automatic dish wash compositions.<br>
The present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides encoding the subtilases, nucleic acid constructs, recombinant expression vectors, host cells comprising the nucleic acid construct, and methods for producing and using the subtilases of the invention. Further, the present invention relates to cleaning and detergent compositions comprising the subtilase enzymes of the invention as well as to use of such enzymes in detergent compositions and for removal of egg stains.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the detergent industry enzymes have for more than 30 years been implemented in washing formulations. Enzymes used in such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases,, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially most important enzymes are proteases.<br>
An increasing number of commercially used proteases are protein engineered variants of naturally occurring wild type proteases, e.g. DURAZYM® (Novo Nordisk A/S), RELASE® (Novo Nordisk A/S) , MAXAPEM®    (Gist-Brocades    N.V.),    PURAFECT®    (Genencor International, Inc.).<br>
Further, a number of protease variants are described in the art,  such as in EP 130756  (GENENTECH) (corresponding to US<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br>
Reissue Patent No. 34,606 (GENENCOR)); EP 214435 (HENKEL); WO 87/04461 (AMGEN); WO 87/05050 (GENEX); EP 250105 (GENENCOR); ThomaS; Russell, and Fersht (1985) Nature 318 375-376; Thomas, Russell, and Fersht (1987) J. Moi. Biol. 193 803-813; Russel and Fersht Nature 328 496-500 (1987); WO 88/08028 (Genex); WO 88/08033  (Amgen);  WO  95/27049  (SOLVAY  S.A.);  WO  95/30011<br>
(PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE COMPANY); WO 95/30010 (PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE COMPANY); WO 95/29979 (PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE COMPANY); US 5.543.302<br>
(SOLVAY S.A.); EP 251 446 (GENENCOR); WO 89/06279 (NOVO NORDISK A/S); WO 91/00345 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) ; EP 525 610 Al (SOLVAY}; and WO 94/02618 (GIST-BROCADES N.V.).<br>
However, even though a number of useful proteases and protease variants have been described^ there is still a need for new improved proteases or protease variants for a number of industrial uses.<br>
In particular, the problem of removing egg stains from e.g. laundry or hard surfaces has been pronounced due to the fact that substances present in the egg white inhibit many serine proteases.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide improved subtilase enzymes, which are suitable for removal of egg stains from, for example, laundry and/or hard surfaces.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Concerning alignment and numbering reference is made to Fig. 1 which shows alignments between subtilisin BPN' (a) (BASBPN) and the novel subtilase of the invention (b)<br>
These alignments are in this patent application used as a reference for numbering the residues.<br>
DEFINITQNS<br>
Prior to discussing this invention in further detail, the following terms and conventions will first be defined.<br><br><br>
NOMENCLATURE OF NUCLEIC ACIDS<br>
A      =  Adenine<br>
G      =  Guanine<br>
C      =  Cytosine<br>
T      =  Thymine (only in DNA)<br>
U      =  Uracil  (only in RNA)<br>
NOMENCLATURE AND CONVENTIONS FOR DESIGNATION OF VARIANTS In describing the various subtilase enzyme variants produced or contemplated according to the invention, the following nomenclatures  and  conventions have  been  adapted  for  ease  of reference:<br>
A frame of reference is first defined by aligning the isolated or parent enzyme with subtilisin BPN' (BASBPN).<br>
The alignment can be obtained by the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9-1 to number the subtilases using the following parameters: gap creation penalty = 8 and gap extension penalty = 8 and all other parameters kept at their default values,<br>
Another method is to use known recognized alignments between subtilases, such as the alignment indicated in WO 91/00345. In most cases the differences will not be of any importance.<br>
Such an alignments between subtilisin BPN' (BASBPN) and the novel subtilase of the invention is indicated in Fig. 1.<br>
Thereby a number of deletions and insertions will be defined in relation to BASBPN. In Fig. 1, the novel subtilase according to the invention has 6 deletions in positions 36, 58, 158, 162, 163, and 164 in comparison to BASBPN- These deletions are in Fig. 1 indicated by asterixes (*).<br><br>
The various modifications performed in a parent enzyme is indicated in general using three elements as follows:<br>
Original amino acid position substituted amino acid<br>
The notation G195E thus means a substitution' of a glycine in<br>
position 195 with a glutamic acid.<br>
In the case where the original amino acid residue may be any amino acid residue- a short hand notation may at times be used indicating only the position and substituted amino acid:<br>
Position substituted amino acid<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with<br>
modification(s) in homologous subtilases {vide infra).<br>
Similarly when the identity of the substituting amino acid residue(s) is immaterial:<br>
Original amino acid position<br>
When both the original amino acid(s) and substituted amino acid{s) may comprise any amino acid, then only the position is indicated, e.g,: 170.<br>
When the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid[s), then the selected amino acids are indicated inside brackets:<br>
Original amino acid position {substituted amino acid1 . , substituted amino acidn)<br>
For specific variants the specific three or one letter codes<br>
are used, including the codes Xaa and X to indicate any amino<br>
acid residue.	<br>
SUBSTITUTIONS:<br><br><br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with modification(s) in homologous subtilases {vide- infra). 170Ser is thus meant to comprise e.g. both a Lysl70Ser modification in BASBPN and Argl70Ser modification in the subtilase according to the invention (cf. Fig. 1)•<br>
For a modification where the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s), the substitution of glycine, alanine, serine or threonine for arginine in position 170 would be indicated by<br>
Argl7 0{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}    or R170{G,A,S,T}<br>
to indicate the variants<br>
R170G, R170A, R170S, and R170T.<br><br>
DELETIONS:<br>
A deletion of glycine in position 195 will be indicated by:<br>
Glyl95-    or  G195*<br>
Correspondingly the deletion of more than one amino acid residue, such as the deletion of glycine and leucine in positions 195 and 196 will be designated<br>
Glyl95*+Leul96*  or  G195*+L196*<br>
INSERTIONS:<br>
The insertion of an additional amino acid residue such as e.g.<br>
a  lysine after G195 is indicated by:<br>
Glyl95GlyLys    or  G195GK;<br>
or, when more than one amino acid residue is inserted^ such as e.g. a Lys, and Ala after G195 this will be indicated as:<br>
Glyl95GlyLysAla  or  G195GKA<br>
In such cases the inserted amino acid residue(s) are numbered by the addition of lower case letters to the position number of the amino acid residue preceding the inserted amino acid residue (s). In the above example the sequences 194 to 196 would thus be:<br>
194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br>
194 195 195a 195b  196 Variant    A-G-K- A-  L<br><br>
In cases where an amino acid residue identical to the existing amino acid residue is inserted it is clear that degeneracy in the nomenclature arises. If for example a glycine is inserted after the glycine in the above example this would be indicated by G195GG. The same actual change could just as well be indicated as A194AG for the change from<br>
194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br>
to<br>
194 195  195a 196 Variant    A - G -  G - L<br>
194 194a 195  196<br>
Such instances will be apparent to the skilled person, and the indication G195GG and corresponding indications for this type of insertions are thus meant to comprise such equivalent degenerate indications.<br>
FILLING A GAP:<br>
Where a deletion in an enzyme exists in. the reference comparison with the subtilisin BPN' sequence used for the numbering, an insertion in such a position is indicated as:<br>
*36Asp     or   *36D<br>
for the insertion of an aspartic acid in position 36<br>
MULTIPLE MODIFICATIONS:<br>
Variants comprising multiple modifications are separated by<br>
pluses, e.g.:<br>
Argil 0Tyr+Glyl95Glu       or       R170Y4-G195E<br><br>
representing modifications in positions 170 and 195 substituting tyrosine and glutamic acid for arginine and glycine, respectively.<br>
Thus,	Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}+Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}<br>
designates the following variants:<br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl7 0Gly,	Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl7 0Ser,	Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Thr,<br>
ryrl67Ala+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Ala+Argl7 0Ser,	Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Thr,<br>
Tyrl67Ser+Argl7 0Gly,	Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ser,	Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Thr, •<br>
Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ser,   and Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Thr.<br>
This nomenclature is particular relevant relating to<br>
modifications aimed at substituting, replacing, inserting or<br>
deleting amino acid residues having specific common properties,<br>
such as residues of positive charge (K, R, H) , negative charge<br>
(D, E), or conservative amino acid modification(s) of e.g.<br>
Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}+Argl70.{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr},	which<br>
signifies substituting a small amino acid for another small amino acid. See section 'Detailed description of the invention" for further details.<br>
Proteases<br>
Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein substrates are classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases (see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3)%<br>
Numbering of amino acid positions/residues<br><br>
If nothing else is mentioned the amino acid numbering used herein correspond to that of the subtilase BPN'  (BASBPN) sequence. For further description of the BPN' sequence, see Fig. 1 or Siezen et al.,   Protein Engng.   4 (1991) 719-737.<br>
Serine proteases<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handler and Smith, 1973 'Principles of Biochemistry," Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272).<br>
The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Dalton range. They are inhibited by diisopro-pyl fluorophosphate. They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. A more narrow term, alkaline protease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high pH optimum of some of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11.0 (for review, see Priest (1977) Bacteriological     Rev.   41 711-753).<br>
Subtilases<br>
Siezen et al have proposed a sub-group of the serine proteases tentatively designated subtilases, Protein Engng, 4 (1991) 719-737 and Siezen et al. Protein Science 6 (1997) 501-523. They are defined by homology analysis of more than 170 amino acid sequences of serine proteases previously referred to as subtilisin-like proteases. A subtilisin was previously often defined as a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, and according to Siezen et al. now is a subgroup of the subtilases- A wide variety of subtilases have been identified, and the amino acid sequence of a number of subtilases has been determined. For a more detailed description of such subtilases and their amino acid sequences reference is made to Siezen et ai.(1997).<br><br>
One subgroup of the subtilases I-SI or "true" subtilisins, comprises the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168 (BSS168), subtilisin BPN' (BASBPN), subtilisin Carlsberg (BLSCAR)(ALCALASE®, NOVO NORDISK A/S), and subtilisin DY (BSSDY).<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases, I-S2 or high alkaline subtilisins, is recognized by Siezen at al. (supra). Sub-group I-S2 proteases are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprises enzymes such as subtilisin PB92 (BAALKP) (MAXACAL®, Gist-Brocades NV), subtilisin 309 (BLSAVI)(SAVINASE®, NOVO NORDISK A/S), subtilisin 147 (BLS147) (ESPERASE®, NOVO NORDISK A/S) r   and alkaline elastase YaB (BSEYAB).<br>
Parent subtilase<br>
The term 'parent subtilase' describes a subtilase defined according to Siezen et al, (1991 and 1997). For further details see description of 'SUBTILASES" immediately above. A parent subtilase may also be a subtilase isolated from a natural source, wherein subsequent modifications have been made while retaining the characteristic of a subtilase. Furthermore, a parent subtilase may also be a subtilase which has been prepared by the DNA shuffling technique, such as described by J.E. Ness et ai., Nature Biotechnology, 17, 893-896 (1999).  Alternatively the term 'parent subtilase' may be termed "wild type subtilase".<br>
Modification(s) of a subtilase<br>
The term 'modification (s)" used herein is defined to include chemical modification of a subtilase as well as genetic manipulation of the DNA en'coding a subtilase. The modification (s) can be replacement (s) of the amino acid side chain(s), substitution(s) , deletion(s) and/or insertions in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br><br>
Subtilase variant<br>
In the context of this invention, the term subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene from which said mutated subtilase protease is produced when expressed in a suitable host. Analogously, the mutant gene may also be derived from a parent gene produced by DNA shuffling technique.<br>
Homologous subtilase sequences<br>
In the present context the homology between two amino acid<br>
sequences is described by the parameter 'identity"-<br>
In order to determine the degree of identity between two subti-lases the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 can be applied [infra)   using the same settings. The output from the rou- . tine is besides the amino acid alignment the calculation of the "Percent Identity" between the two sequences.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable homologous subtilases and corresponding homologous active site loop regions, which can be modified according to the invention.<br>
Isolated polynucleotide<br>
The term "isolated polynucleotide' as used herein refers to a polynucleotide, which has been isolated and purified and is thus in a form suitable for use 'within genetically engineered protein production systems. Such isolated molecules may be those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones as well as polynucleotides<br><br>
derived from DNA shuffling experiments or from site-directed autogenesis experiments. Isolated polynucleotides of the present invention are free of other genes with which they are ordinarily associated, but may include 5' and 3' untranslated regions such as promoters and terminators. The identification of associated regions will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art (see for example, Dynan and Tijan, Nature 316:774-78, 1985) - The term 'isolated nucleic acid sequence' may alternatively be termed 'isolated DNA sequence, 'cloned nucleic acid sequence" or "cloned DNA sequence".<br>
Isolated protein<br>
When applied to a protein, the term "isolated" indicates that<br>
the protein has been removed from its native environment.<br>
In a preferred form, the isolated protein is substantially free of other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins (i.e. "homologous impurities" (see below)).<br>
An isolated protein is more than 10% pure, preferably more than 20% pure, more preferably more than 30% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Further it is preferred to provide the protein in a highly purified form, i.e., more than 40% pure, more than 60% pure, more than 80% pure, more preferably more than 95% pure, and most preferably more than 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE,<br>
The term "isolated protein" may alternatively be termed "purified protein".<br>
Homologous impurities<br>
The term "homologous impurities" -means any impurity (e.g. another polypeptide than the subtilase of the invention) , which originate from the homologous cell where the subtilase of the invention is originally obtained from.<br><br>
Obtained from<br>
The term 'obtained from" as used herein in connection with a specific microbial source, means that the polynucleotide and/or subtilase produced by the specific source, or by a cell in which a gene from the source has been inserted.<br>
Substrate<br>
The term 'substrate" used in connection with a substrate for a protease should be interpreted in its broadest form as comprising a compound containing at least one peptide bond susceptible to hydrolysis by a subtilisin protease.<br>
Product<br>
The term "product" used in connection with a product derived<br>
from a protease enzymatic reaction should, in the context of<br>
the present invention, be interpreted to include the products<br>
of a hydrolysis reaction involving a subtilase protease, A<br>
product may be  the  substrate  in  a  subsequent  hydrolysis<br>
reaction.<br>
Wash Performance<br>
In the present context the term "wash performance" is used as<br>
an enzyme's ability to remove egg stains present on the object<br>
to the cleaned during e.g. wash or hard surface cleaning. See<br>
also the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" in Example 2,<br>
herein.<br>
Performance Factor<br>
The term "Performance Factor" is defined with respect to the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first interesting aspect of the present invention/ the subtilase enzyme having improved wash performance on egg stains is an isolated subtilase which has at least 88% identity with the amino acid sequence shown as amino acids 1 to 269 of SEQ ID NO:2 (i.e. the matiore subtilase). In an interesting embodiment of the invention the subtilase has at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identity with the amino acid sequence shown as amino acids 1 to 269 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (hereinafter "homologous subtilases") . In another interesting embodiment of the invention the isolated subtilase consists of the amino acid sequence shown as amino acids 1 to 2 69 of SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
Alignments of sequences and calculation of identity scores can be done using a full Smith-Waterman alignment, useful for both protein and DNA alignments. The default scoring matrices BLO-SUM50 and the identity matrix are used for protein and DNA alignments respectively. The penalty for the first residue in a gap is -12 for proteins and -16 for DNA, while the penalty for additional residues in a gap is -2 for proteins and -4 for DNA. Align is from the Fasta package version v20u6 (W. R- Pearson<br><br>
and D. J. Lipman (1988), "Improved Tools for Biological Sequence Analysis", PNAS 85:2444-2448, and W. R. Pearson (1990) "Rapid and Sensitive Sequence Comparison with FASTP and FASTA" Methods in Enzymology 183:63-98),<br>
By performing such alignments, the following identities (in percentage) between the amino acid sequences of the subtilase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 and various known subtilases were found:<br><br>
In another interesting embodiment of the invention the isolated sub-tilase is encoded by a polynucleotide which hybridizes under low stringency conditions, preferably under medium stringency -conditions, more preferably under high stringency conditions with (i) a complementary strand of the polynucleotide shown as nucleotides 1 to 807 of SEQ ID N0:1, or (ii) a subsequence of (i) of at least 100 nucleotides (J. Sambrook, E.F. Fritsch, and T. Maniatis, 1989, Molecular Cloning^ A Laboratory Manual, 2d edition. Cold Spring Harbor, New York).<br>
The fragment or subsequence of the complementary strand of the polynucleotide, shown as nucleotidesl to 807 of SEQ ID N0:1, may be at least 100 nucleotides or preferably at least 200 nucleotides. Moreover, the subsequence should encode a subtilase fragment, which has proteolytic activity. The subtilases may also be allelic variants or fragments of the subtilases that have proteolytic activity.<br><br>
The polynucleotide of SEQ ID N0:1 or a subsequence or fragment thereof, as well as the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or a fragment thereof, may be used to design a nucleic acid probe to identify and clone DNA encoding subtilas'es having proteolytic activity from strains of different genera or "species according to methods well known in the art. In particular, such probes can be used for hybridization with the genomic or cDNA of the genus or species of interest, following standard Southern blotting procedures, in order to identify and isolate the corresponding gene therein. Such probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence, but should be at least 15, preferably at least 25, and more preferably at least 35 nucleotides in length. Longer probes can also be used. Both DNA and RNA probes can be used. The probes are typically labelled for detecting the corresponding gene (for example, with 32P, 3H, 35S, biotin, or avidin). Such probes are encompassed by the present invention.<br>
Thus, a genomic DNA or cDNA library prepared from such other organisms may be screened for DNA that hybridizes with the probes described above and which encodes a subtilase according to the invention. Genomic or other DNA from such other organisms may be separated by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or other separation techniques known by the skilled person. DNA from the libraries or the separated DNA may be transferred to and immobilized on nitrocellulose or other suitable .carrier materials. In order to identify a clone or DNA that is homologous with SEQ ID NO: 1 or a subsequence thereof, the carrier material is used in a Southern blot. For purposes of the present invention, hybridization indicates that the polynucleotide hybridizes to a labelled nucleic acid probe corresponding .to the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, its complementary strand, or a subsequence thereof, under low to high stringency conditions. Molecules to which the nucleic<br><br>
acid probe hybridizes under these conditions are detected using X-ray film.<br>
For long probes of at least 100 nucleotides in length, low to high stringency conditions are defined as pre-hybridization and<br>
hybridization at 42°C in 5X SSPE, 0-3% SDS, 200 µg/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA and either 25% formamide for low stringency, 35% formamide for medium stringency, or 50% formamide for high stringency, following standard Southern blotting procedures.<br>
For long probes of at least 100 nucleotides in length, the carrier material is finally washed three times each for 15 minutes using 2 x SSC, 0.2% SDS preferably at least at 50°C (low stringency) , more preferably at least at 55°C (medium stringency), even more preferably at least at 65°C (high stringency) .<br>
For short probes, which are about 15 nucleotides .to about 70 nucleotides in length, stringency conditions are defined as pre-hybridization, hybridization, and washing post-hybridization at 5°C to 10°C below the calculated Tm using the calculation according to Bolton and McCarthy (1962, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 48:1390) in 0,9 M NaCl, 0.09 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 6 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, IX Denhardt's solution, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 0.1 mM ATP, and 0.2 mg of yeast RNA per ml, following standard Southern blotting procedures.<br>
For short probes, which are about 15 nucleotides to about 70 nucleotides in length, the carrier material is washed once in 6X sec plus 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes and twice each for 15 minutes using 6X SSC at 5°C to 10°C below the calculated Tm.<br><br>
It is well known in the art that a so-called conservative substitution of one amino acid residue to a similar amino acid residue is expected to produce only a minor change in the characteristic of the enzyme.<br>

Therefore, in a further interesting embodiment of the invention, the subtilase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 is combined with a substitution, deletion and/or insertion of one or more amino acid residues.<br>
Especially, combinations with other modifications known in the art to provide improved properties to the enzyme are envisaged.<br><br>
The art describes a number of subtilase variants with different improved properties and a number of those are mentioned in the '^Background of the invention" section herein {vide supra) .<br>
Thus, modification of the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 2 in one or more of the following positions are contemplated as being of particular relevance (in BASBPN.numbering):<br>
27, 36, 56, 76, 87, 97, 101, 104, 120, 123, 167, 170, 222, 224, 235 and 274<br>
In particular, the following variants of the subtilase of the invention are considered appropriate for combination (in BASBPN numbering):<br>
K27R, *36D, S56P, N76D, S87N, G97N, RIOIG, S103A, V104A, V104I, V104N, V104Y, H120D, N123S, Y167, R170, M222S, M222A, T224S, K235L and T274A.<br>
Furthermore, it is contemplated that insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue in the active site (b) loop region, corresponding to insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue from position 95 to position 103 (BASBPN numbering), will confer additional wash performance to the subtilase of the invention. In particular, it is preferred to insert at least one additional amino acid residue, such as one additional amino acid residue, in the following positions: between positions 98 and 99, and between positions 99 and 100.<br>
Moreover, isolated subtilases, preferably in a purified form, having immunochemical identity or partial immunochemical identity to the subtilase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 are also considered as being within the scope of the present invention. The immunochemical properties are determined by immunological cross-reaction identity tests by the well-known<br><br>
Ouchterlony double immnunodiffusion procedure. Specifically, an antiserum containing polyclonal antibodies which are immuunore-active or bind to epitopes of the subtilase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 are prepared'^by immunizing rabbits (or other rodents) according to the procedure'described by Har-boe and Ingild, In N.H, Axelsen, J. Kroll, and B. Weeks, editors, A Manual of Quantitative Immunoelectrophoresis, Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1973, Chapter 23, or Johnstone and Thorpe, Immunochemistry in Practice^ Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1982 (more specifically pages 27-31). A subtilase having immunochemical identity is a subtilase, which reacts with the antiserum in an identical fashion such as total fusion of precipitates, identical precipitate morphology, and/or identical electrophoretic mobility using a specific immunochemical technique. Axelsen, Bock, and Kr0ll describe a further explanation of immunochemical identity in N.H. Axelsen, J. Kr0ll, and B. Weeks, editors, A Manual of Quantitative Immunoelectrophore-sisr Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1973, Chapter 10. A subtilase having partial immunochemical identity is a subtilase, which reacts with the antiserum in a partially identical fashion such as partial fusion of precipitates, partially identical precipitate morphology, and/or partially identical electrophoretic mobility using a specific immunochemical technique. Bock and Axelsen describe partial immunochemical identity in N.H. Axelsen, J. Kr0ll, and B. "Weeks, editors, A Manual of Quantitative Immunoelectrophoresis, Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1973, Chapter 11.<br>
The antibody may also be-a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared and used, e.g., according to the methods of E. Harlow and D. Lane, editors, 1988, Antibodies^ A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.<br><br>
The present inventors have isolated the gene encoding the sub-tilase having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID-N0:2 and inserted it into E. coli MT173. The E. coli MT173 strain harbouring the gene was deposited according to the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposits of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedures on 8 February 2000 at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Mascheroder Weg 1 B, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany, and designated the accession No. DSM 13306.<br>
In an interesting embodiment of the invention the subtilase has at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identity with the subtilase encoded by the subtilase encoding part of the polynucleotide cloned into a plasmid fragment present in E.  coli Mri73 deposited under the accession No. DSM 13306.<br>
As mentioned above, the subtilase of the invention exhibits excellent wash performance on egg stains. Therefore, in order to enable the skilled person - at an early stage of his. development work - to select effective and preferred subtilases for this purpose, the present inventors have provided a suitable preliminary test, which can easily be carried out by the skilled person in order to initially assess the performance of the subtilase in question.<br>
Thus, the test 'Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" disclosed in Example 2, herein, may be employed to assess the ' efficiency of the selected subtilase. In other words, the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" may be employed to assess the ability of a subtilase, when incorporated in a standard detergent composition, 'to remove egg stains from a standard textile as compared to a reference system, in this case Savinase® (incorporated in the same model detergent system and tested under identical conditions). Using this test, the<br><br>
suitability of a selected subtilase to remove egg stains can be initially investigated, the rationale being that if a selected subtilase does not show a significant improvement in the test compared to Savinase®, it is' normally not necessary to carry out further test experiments.<br>
Therefore, subtilases which are particular interesting for the purposes described herein, are such subtilases which, when tested in a model detergent composition comprising<br>
6.2%	LAS (Nansa SOS)<br>
2%	Sodium salt  of C16C-18  fatty acid<br>
4%"	Non-ionic  surfactant   (Plurafax LF404)<br>
22%	Zeolite  P<br>
10.5%	Na2C03<br>
4%	Na2Si205<br>
2%	Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)<br>
6.8%	Acrylate liquid CP5 40%<br>
20%	Sodium perborate (empirical formula NaB02.H202)<br>
0.2%	EDTA<br>
21%	Na2S04<br>
Water (balance)<br>
as described in the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" herein, shows an improved wash performance on egg stains as compared to Savinase® tested under identical conditions.<br>
The improvement in the wash performance may be quantified by employing the so-called "Performance Factor" defined in Example 2, herein.<br>
In a very interesting embodiment of the invention, the subtilase of the invention, when tested in the "Wash Performance Test" has a Performance Factor of at least 1, such as at least 1.5, e.g. at least 2, preferably at least 2.5, such<br><br>
as at least 3,e.g. at least 3.5,in particular at least 4, such as at least 4.5, e.g. at least 5.<br>
Evidently,, it is preferred that the subtilase of the invention fulfils the above criteria on at least the stated lowest level, more preferably at the stated intermediate level and most preferably on the stated highest level.<br>
The subtilase of the invention may be constructed by standard techniques for artificial creation of diversity, such as by DNA shuffling of different subtilase genes (see WO 95/22625 and J.E. Ness et  ai., Nature Biotechnology, 17, 893"896 (1999)).<br>
Obviously, the subtilase of the invention may also be isolated from a natural source, i.e. the subtilase of the invention may, for example, be a bacterial subtilase, e.g. a gram positive bacterial subtilase such as a Bacillus polypeptide, e.g., a Bacillus alkalophilus, Bacillus amyloliquefacienS, acillus breviS,Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus lautuS,Bacillus lentus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megateriui?3. Bacillus stearothenaophilus, Bacillus subtiliSr or Bacillus thuringiensis subtilase; or a Streptomyces subtilase, e.g. a Streptomyces lividans or Streptomyces murinus subtilase; or a gram negative bacterial subtilase, e.g., an E. coli  or a Pseudomonas  sp. subtilase.<br>
The subtilase of the present invention may also be a fungal polypeptide, and more preferably a yeast subtilase such as a Candidar Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharo-myceSf or Yarrowia subtilase; or more preferably a filamentous fungal subtilase such as an Acreinoniuin, Aspergillus, Aureo-basidiuin, Cryptococcus, Filihasidium, Fusarium, Humicoia, Mag-naporthef Mucor, Myceliophthora ,Neocallimastix, Neurospora, PaecilomyceS   Penicilliumr   Piromyces,    Schizophyllumr    Talaromy-<br><br>
ces, ThermoascuSf Thielavia, Tolypocladiumr or Trichoderma sub-tilase.<br>
In an interesting embodiment the subtilase is a Saccharomyces carlsbergensls , Saccharomyces cerevislae Saccharomyces dl-astaticusr Saccharomyces douglasiir Saccharomyces kluyveri Saccharomyces norbensis or  Saccharomyces  ovlformis  subtilase.<br>
In another interesting embodiment, the subtilase is an Aspergillus aculeatus, Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus foetidus, Aspergillus japonicus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Fusarium bactridioides, Fusarium cerealis, Fusarium crookwellense,Fusarium culniorum, Fusariujn graminea-rum, Fusarium graminum, Fusarium heterosporum,Fusarium ne~ gundif Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium reticulatum, Fusarium roseum, Fusarium sambucinumr Fusarium sarcochroum,Fusarium sporotrichioides, Fusarium sulphureum, Fusarium torulosum, Fusarium trichothecioides, Fusarium venenatumr Humicola inso-lens,micola lanuginosa, Mucor miehei, Myceliophthora thermo-phila, Neurospora crassa, Penicillium purpurogenum, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma longibrachiatumf Trichoderma  reesei,   or Trichoderma viride  subtilase.<br>
It will be understood that for the aforementioned species, the invention encompasses both the perfect and imperfect states^ and other taxonomic equivalents, e.g., anamorphs, regardless of the species name by which they are known. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize the identity of appropriate equivalents.<br>
Strains of these species are readily accessible to the public in a number of culture collections, such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganis-men und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), Centraalbureau Voor Schimmel-<br><br>
cultures (CBS) , and Agricultural Research Service Patent Culture Collection, Northern Regional Research Center (NRRL).<br>
Furthermore, such subtilases may be identified and obtained from other sources including microorganisms isolated from nature (e.g., soil, composts, water, etc,) using the above-mentioned probes. Techniques for isolating microorganisms from natural habitats are well known in the art. Similarly screening a genomic or cDNA library of another microorganism may then derive the polynucleotide. Once a polynucleotide encoding a subtilase has been detected with the probe(s), the sequence may be isolated or cloned by utilizing techniques which are known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra) ,<br>
Many methods for cloning a subtilase of the invention and for introducing insertions into genes (e.g. subtilase genes) are well known in the art, cf. the references cited in the '"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION" section.<br>
In general standard procedures for cloning of genes and introducing insertions (random and/or site directed) into said genes may be used in order to obtain a subtilase enzyme of the invention. For further description of suitable techniques reference is made to Examples herein (vide infra) and (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning; A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor lab.. Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C R., and Cutting, S. M. (eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus". John Wiley and Sons, 1990); and WO 96/34946.<br>
Further, a subtilase enzyme of the invention may be constructed<br>
by standard techniques for artificial creation of diversity,<br>
such as by DNA shuffling of different subtilase genes  (WO<br>
f<br><br>
95/22625/ Stemmer WPC, Nature 370:389-91 (1994)), DNA shuffling of e.g. the gene encoding Savinase® with one or more partial subtilase sequences identified in nature will, after subsequent screening for improved wash performance, provide subtilases according to the invention.<br>
POLYNUCLEOTIDES<br>
The present invention also relates to an isolated polynucleotide, which encodes a subtilase of the present invention.<br>
In one interesting embodiment, the polynucleotide has at least 88% identity with the polynucleotide shown as nucleotides 1 to 807 of SEQ ID N0:1. Preferably, the polynucleotide has at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99% identity with the polynucleotide shown as nucleotides 1 to 807 of SEQ ID N0:1. In another interesting embodiment of the invention the polynucleotide comprises the polynucleotide shown as nucleotides 1 to 807 of SEQ ID N0:1, an allelic variant thereof, or a fragment thereof capable of encoding a subtilase according to the invention. Obviously, the polynucleotide may consist of the polynucleotide shown as nucleotides 1 to 807 of SEQ ID N0:1.<br>
The present invention also encompasses polynucleotides that encode a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, which differ from SEQ ID NO:2 by virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code. The present invention also relates to subsequences of SEQ ID N0:1 that encode fragments of SEQ ID NO:2 that have proteolytic activity.<br>
A subsequence of SEQ ID N0:1 is a polynucleotide encompassed by nucleotides 1 to 807 SEQ ID N0:1 except that one or more nucleotides from the 5' and/or 3' end have been deleted.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides encoding a subtilase of the present invention^ which hybridize under low stringency conditions, preferably under medium stringency conditions, more preferably under high stringency conditions, with (i) a complementary strand of the polynucleotide shown as nucleotides 1 to 807 of SEQ ID NO:1, or (ii) a subsequence of (i) of at least 100 nucleotides. The present invention also relates to complementary strands of  (i) and (ii).<br>
The techniques used to isolate or clone a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide are known in the art and include isolation from genomic DNA, preparation from cDNA, or a combination thereof. The Cloning- of the polynucleotides of the present invention from such genomic DNA can be effected, e.g., by using the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody screening of expression libraries to detect cloned DNA fragments with shared structural features. See, e.g., Innis et al., 1990, PCR: A Guide to Methods and Applicatiorir Academic Press, New York. Other nucleic acid amplification procedures such as ligase chain reaction (LCR), ligated activated transcription (LAT) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) may be used.<br>
An isolated polynucleotide can, for example, be obtained by standard cloning procedures used in genetic engineering to relocate the polynucleotide from its natural location to a different site where it will be reproduced. The cloning procedures may involve excision and isolation of a desired nucleic acid fragment comprising the polynucleotide encoding the subtilase, insertion of the fragment into a vector molecule, and incorporation of the recombinant vector into a host cell where multiple copies or clones of the polynucleotide will be replicated. The polynucleotide may be of genomic, cDNA, RNA, semisynthetic, synthetic origin, or any combinations thereof.<br><br>
For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two polynucleotides is determined is described above.<br>
Modification of a polynucleotide encodin'g a subtilase of the present invention may be necessary for the synthesis of subti-lases substantially similar to the subtilase. The term "substantially similar" to the subtilase refers to non-naturally occurring forms of the subtilase. These subtilases may differ in some engineered way from the subtilase isolated from its native source, e.g., variants that differ in specific activity, thermostability, pH optim;im, or the like. The variant sequence may be constructed on the basis of the polynucleotide presented as the polypeptide encoding part of SEQ ID N0:1, e.g., a subsequence thereof, and/or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions which do not give rise to another amino acid sequence of the subtilase encoded by the nucleic acid sequence, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the enzyme, or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions which may give rise to a different amino acid sequence. For a general description of nucleotide substitution, see, e.g.. Ford et al., 1991, Protein Expression and Purifica-tion 2:   95-107.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that such substitutions can be made outside the regions critical to the function of the molecule and still result in an active subtilase. Amino acid residues essential to the activity of the polypeptide encoded by the isolated polynucleotide of the invention, and therefore preferably not subject to substitution, may be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (see, e.g.,  Cunningham and Wells,. 1989, Science 24A: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, mutations are introduced at every positively charged residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for proteolytic<br><br>
activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. Sites of substrate-enzyme interaction can also be determined by analysis of the three-dimensional structure as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, crystallography or photoaffinity labelling (see, e.g,, de Vos et al., 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith et ai., 1992, Journal of Molecular Biology 224: 899-904; Wlodaver et ai., 1992, FEES Letters 309: 59-64).<br>
NUCLEIC ACID CONSTRUCTS<br>
The present invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention operably linked to one or more control sequences capable of directing the expression of the polypeptide in a suitable host cell.<br>
An isolated polynucleotide encoding a subtilase of the present invention may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of the subtilase. Manipulation of the polynucleotide prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotides utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art.<br>
The control sequences include all components that are necessary or advantageous for the expression of a subtilase of the present invention. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the polynucleotide encoding the subtilase. Such control sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenyla-tion sequence, propeptide sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transcription terminator. At a minimum, the control sequences include a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences<br><br>
with the coding region of the polynucleotide encoding a subti-lase.<br>
The control sequence may be an appropriate promoter sequence, a polynucleotide that is recognised by a host ceTl for expression of the nucleic acid sequence. The promoter sequence contains transcriptional control 'sequences that mediate the expression of the subtilase. The promoter may be any polynucleotide that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice including mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular sub-tilases either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention, especially in a bacterial host cell, are the promoters obtained from the £. coli lac operon, Streptomyces coelicolor agarase gene (dagA), Bacillus subtilis levansucrase gene {sacB} ^ Bacillus lichenlformis alpha-amylase gene (amyL), Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene {aiayM), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene {amyQ) , Bacillus licheni-formis penicillinase gene {penP) , Bacillus subtilis xylA and xylB genes, and prokaryotic beta-lactamase gene (Villa-Kamaroff et al., 197 8, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 75: 3727-3731), as well as the tac promoter (DeBoer et al,, 1983, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 80: 21-25) . Further promoters are described in "Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria" in Scientific American^ 1980, 242: 74-94; and in Sambrook et ai., 1989, supra.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention in a' filamentous fungal host cell are promoters obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase.<br><br>
Aspergillus niger acid stable alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger or Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase (glaA), Rhizomucor miehei lipase, Aspergillus oryzae alkaline protease, Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase, Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase, and Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease (WO 96/00787), as well as the NA2-tpi promoter (a hybrid of the promoters from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase and Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase), and mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters thereof.<br>
In a yeast host, useful promoters are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces 'cerevisiae enolase (ENO-l), Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactokinase (GALl), Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase {ADH2/GAP) , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanes et al.   1992, Yeast  8: 423-488.<br>
The control sequence may also be a suitable transcription terminator sequence, a sequence recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator sequence is operably linked to the 3' terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the subtilase. Any terminator that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.<br>
Preferred terminators for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase, and Fusarium oxysporum  trypsin-like protease.<br>
Preferred terminators for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae   cytochrome C (CYCl), and Saccharomyces    cerevisiae<br><br>
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Romanos et al., 1992, supra, describe other useful terminators for yeast host cells.<br>
The control sequence may also be a suitable leader sequence, a non-translated region of an laRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader sequence is operably linked to the 5' terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide. Any leader sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.<br>
Preferred leaders for filamentous fungal host* cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase and Aspergillus nldulans triose phosphate isomerase. Suitable leaders for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevlslae enolase (ENO-1), Saccharomy-ces cerevlslae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, Saccharomyces cerevlslae alpha-factor, and Saccharomyces cerevlslae alcohol dehy-drogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2/GAP).<br>
The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence, a sequence operably linked to the 3' terminus of the polynucleotide and which, when transcribed, is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.<br>
Preferred polyadenylation sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus nldulans anthranilate synthase, Fusariuin oxysporum trypsin-like protease, and Aspergillus nlger  alpha-glucosidase.<br>
Useful polyadenylation sequences for yeast host cells are described by Guo and Sherman, 1995, Molecular Cellular Biology 15: 5983-5990.<br><br>
The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that codes for an amino acid sequence linked to the amino terminus of a subtilase and directs the encoded subtilase into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5' end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a signal peptide coding region naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding region that encodes the secreted subtilase. Alternatively, the 5' end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding region that is foreign to the ' coding sequence- The foreign signal peptide coding region may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding region. Alternatively, the foreign signal peptide coding region may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding region in order to enhance secretion of the subtilase. However, any signal peptide coding region that directs the expressed subtilase into the secretory pathway of a host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.<br>
Effective signal peptide coding regions for bacterial host cells are the signal peptide coding regions obtained from the genes for Bacillus NCIB 11837 maltogenic amylase. Bacillus stearothenaophilus alpha-amylase. Bacillus licheniformis sub-t'ilisin, Bacillus licheniformis beta-lactamase, Bacillus stearothenaophilus neutral proteases {nprT, nprS, nprM) , and Bacillus subtilis prsA. Further signal peptides are described by Simonen and Palva, 1993, Microbiological Reviews 57: 109-137.<br>
Effective signal peptide coding regions for filamentous fungal host cells are the signal peptide coding regions obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae,TAKA amylase, Aspergillus ni-ger neutral amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, Humicola insolens cellulase, and Humicola  lanuginosa  lipase.<br><br>
Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor and Sac-charomyces cerevisiae invertase. Romanes et al. ^ 1992, supra, describe other useful signal peptide coding regions.<br>
The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding region that codes for an amino acid sequence positioned at the amino terminus of a subtilase- The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases) . A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to a mature active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding region may be obtained from the genes for Bacillus sub-tills alkaline protease {aprE) , Bacillus suhtilis neutral protease InprT)  Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, and Myceliophthora thermophila lac-case (WO 95/33836).<br>
Where both signal peptide and propeptide regions are present at the amino terminus of a subtilase, the propeptide region is positioned next to the amino terminus of a subtilase and the signal peptide region is positioned next to the amino terminus of the propeptide region.<br>
It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that allow the regulation of the expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those which cause the expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeasty the ADH2 system or GALl system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, Aspergillus niger   glucoamylase promoter, and Aspergillus oryzae   glucoamy-<br><br>
lase promoter may be used as regulatory sequences. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems these include the dihydro-f olate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence.<br>
EXPRESSION VECTORS<br>
The present invention also relates to a recombinant expression vector comprising the nucleic acid construct of the invention, a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals-<br>
The recombinant expression vector comprising the nucleic acid construct encoding the enzyme of the invention may be any vector that may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures.<br>
The choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one that on introduction into a host cell is integrated into the host cell genome in part or in its entirety and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA. In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both. The term, 'operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so<br><br>
that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the enzyme.<br>
The promoter may be any DNA sequence that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in bacterial host cells include the promoter of the  Bacillus steazothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene, the Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus subtilis alkaline protease gene^ or the Bacillus pumilus xylosidase gene, or the phage Lambda PR or P^ promoters or the E. coli lac, trp or tac promoters.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator.<br>
The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, or a gene encoding resistance to e.g. antibiotics like kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, spectinomycine, or the like, or resistance to heavy metals or herbicides.<br>
To direct an enzyme of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a seqretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in<br><br>
the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme. The secretory signal sequence may be that normally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the present enzyme, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, or to assemble these sequences by suitable PCR amplification schemes, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication or integration, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et al., op.cit.).<br>
HOST CELL<br>
The present invention also relates to a recombinant host cell<br>
comprising the nucleic acid construct of the invention.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the present enzyme introduced into the host cell may be either homologous or heterologous to the host in question. If homologous to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it will typically be operably connected to another promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment. The term "homologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence encoding an enzyme native to the host organism in question. The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence not expressed by the host cell in nature. Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.<br>
The host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector of the invention is introduced may be any cell that is<br><br>
capable of producing the present enzyme and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells including plants.<br>
Examples of bacterial host cells which,"* on cultivation," are capable of producing the enzyme of the invention are gra.-n-positive bacteria such as strains of Bacillus, such as strains of B. subtilis B. licheniformis r B. lentuSr B. brevis^ B. stearothermophilus , B. alkalophilus ^ B. amyloliquefaciensr B. coagulans f B. circulanS, B. lautus, B. megaterium or B. thuringiensis, in particular B. lentus, or strains of StreptomyceSf such as S. lividans or 5. murinus, or gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia   coli.<br>
The transformation of the bacteria may be effected by protoplast transformation, electroperation, conjugation, or by using competent cells in a manner known per se (cf. Sambrook et al., supra).<br>
When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E. coli, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules (known as inclusion bodies), or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the enzyme is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells, e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the enzyme.<br>
When expressing the enzyme in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus or Streptomyces strains, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, or may be directed to the extracellular medium by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the medium as described below.<br><br>

The filamentous fungi are characterized by a mycelial wall composed of chitin, cellulose, glucan, chitosan, mannan, and other complex polysaccharides. Vegetative growth is by hyphal elongation and carbon catabolism is obligately aerobic. In contrast, vegetative growth by yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae is by budding of a unicellular thallus and carbon catabolism may be fermentative.<br>

Fungal cells may be transformed by a process involving protoplast formation, transformation of the protoplasts, and regeneration of the cell wall in a manner known per se. Suitable procedures for transformation of Aspergillus host cells are described in EP 238 023 and Yelton et ai., 1984, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 81: 1470-1474. Suitable methods for transforming Fusarium species are described by Ma-lardier et al. 1989, Gene 78: 147-156 and WO 96/00787.

METHOD  OF  PRODUCING A   SUBTILASES   OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
The  present   invention   further   relates   to   a  method  for   producing<br>
a subtilase of the invention,  the method comprising:<br>
a)	cultivating a recombinant host  cell of the invention under conditions conducive to the production of the subtilase;  and<br>
b)	recovering the subtilase.<br>
When an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme is transformed into a heterologous host cell it is possible to enable heterologous recombinant production of the enzyme of the invention.<br>
Thereby it is possible to make, a highly purified subtilase composition, characterized in being free from homologous impurities.<br>
In this context homologous impurities means any impurities (e.g. other polypeptides than the enzyme of the invention) that originate from the homologous cell where the enzyme of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>

The expressed subtilase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered therefrom by well-known procedures including.separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium<br><br>
sulfate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like,<br>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY<br>
In the context of this invention proteolytic activity is<br>
expressed in Kilo NOVO Protease Units (KNPU). The activity is<br>
«<br>
determined relatively to an enzyme standard (SAVINASE®) , and the determination is based on the digestion of a dimethyl casein (DMC) solution by the proteolytic enzyme at standard conditions, i.e. 50°C, pH 8-3, 9 min. reaction time, 3 min. measuring time. A folder AF 220/1 is available upon request to Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference.<br>
A GU is a Glycine Unit, defined as the proteolytic enzyme activity that, under standard conditions, during a 15 minutes'<br>
incubation at 4 0°C, with N-acetyl casein as substrate, produces an amount of NHs-group equivalent to 1 mmole of glycine.<br>
Enzyme activity can also be measured using the PNA assay, according to reaction with the soluble substrate succinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-phenyl-alanine-para-nitro-phenol, which is described in the Journal of 7\merican Oil Chemists Society, Rothgeb, T.M-, Goodlander, B.D., Garrison, P,H., and Smith, L.A., (1988).<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - Construction and expression of subtilases according to the invention<br>
The subtilisin having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 was located in vector pJRoC112, which is very similar to plasmid pKH400 (previously described in WO 98/41623) . The plas-mids are identical outside the regions encoding the mature sub-<br><br>
tilisin, i.e. the origin of replication the cat gene conferring resistance towards chloramphenicol, the promoter directing the initiation of transcription of the subtilisin and the pre/pro regions from Savinase® are identical in these plasmids. Differences are only found within the part of the gene encoding the mature subtilisin.<br>
This plasmid replicates both in E. coli and in Bacillus sub-tiJis. In Bacillus subtilis the subtilisin according to the invention was expressed from this plasmid. Fermentation and purification of the protease is described below.<br>
PKH400 was constructed from pJS3 [E, coli - B. sujbtiJis shuttle vector containing a synthetic gene encoding for subtilase 309 (Savinase®) as described by J. Schi0dt et al. in Protein and Peptide Letters, 3, 39-44 (1996)) by introduction of two BamHI sites at positions 1841 and 3730.<br>
The mature gene has been subcloned into plasmid p2ero-2 (Invi-trogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). An approximately 1240 bp . Pmel-BamHI "fragment containing the complete mature region of the subtilase having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2 was ligated with vector pZero-2 and digested with restriction endonucleases BamHI-EcoRV. The ligation mixture was transformed into competent E. coli cells. Transformants, were analysed by PCR to verify the presence of the inserted fragment ~ and the part of this fragment encoding the mature subtilisin was sequenced. The resulting plasmid^ denoted pTVB364, was deposited on 10 February 2000 at DSMZ and was given the accession number DSM 13306.<br>
Fermentation<br>
Fermentations for the production of subtilase enzymes were<br>
performed at 30°C on a rotary shaking table (300 r.p.m.) in 500<br><br>
ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml BPX medium for 5 days-<br>
Consequently, in order to make, e.g., a 2 litre broth 20 Erlenmeyer flasks■were fermented simultaneously.<br>
Media:<br>
BPX Medium Composition	(per litre)<br>
Potato starch	100 g<br>
Ground barley	50 g<br>
Soybean flour	20 g<br>
Na2HP04 x  12  H2O	9 9<br>
Pluronic	0,1 g<br>
Sodium caseinate	10 g<br>
The starch in the medium was liquefied with a-amylase and the<br>
medium was sterilized by heating at 120°C for 45 minutes. After sterilization the pH of the medium was adjusted to 9 by addition of NaHCOs to 0.1 M.<br>
Purification<br>
This procedure relates to purification of a 2 litre scale fermentation for the production of the subtilases of the invention in a Bacillus  host cell.<br>
Approximately 1.6 litres of fermentation broth was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 35 minutes in 1 litre beakers. The supernatants were adjusted to pH 6.5 using 10% acetic acid and filtered on Seitz Supra SlOO filter plates.<br>
The filtrates were concentrated to approximately 400 ml using ■ an Amicon CH2A UF unit equipped with an Amicon SIYIO UF cartridge. The UF concentrate was centrifuged and filtered at room temperature prior to absorption on a Bacitracin affinity colurrtn at pH 7. The subtilase was eluted from the Bacitracin<br><br>
column at room temperature using 25% 2-propanol and 1 M sodium chloride in a buffer solution with 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.1 M boric acid and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 7.<br>
The fractions with protease activity from the Bacitracin purification step were combined and applied to a 7 50 ml Sephadex G25 column (5 cm diameter) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid and 0.002 m calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
Fractions with proteolytic activity from the Sephadex G25 column were combined and applied to a 150 ml CM Sepharose CL 6B cation exchange column {5 cm diameter) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 M dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid, and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
The protease was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0,1 M sodium chloride in 2 litres of the same buffer.<br>
In a final purification step, protease-containing fractions, from the CM Sepharose column were combined and concentrated in an Amicon ultra filtration cell equipped with a GR81PP membrane (from the Danish Sugar Factories Inc.).<br>
By using the techniques mentioned above for the construction and fermentation, and the above isolation procedure, the novel subtilase having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 was produced and isolated.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 - The ^^Model Detergent Wash Performance Test'<br>
In order to asses the wash performance of subtilases in a standard' detergent composition, standard washing experiments may be performed using the below experimental conditions:<br><br>
Detergent:	Model detergent<br>
Detergent dosage	4,0 g/1<br>
pH	10.1<br>
Wash time	20 min<br>

20%	Sodium perborate (empirical formula NaB02-H202)<br>
0.2%	EDTA<br>
21%	Na2S04<br>
Water (balance)<br>
pH of the detergent solution is adjusted to 10.1 by addition of HCl or NaOH, Water hardness is adjusted to 15°dH by addition of CaCl2 and MGCI2 (Ca^'^iMg^'" = 4:1) to the test system. After washing the textile pieces were flushed in tap water and air-dried.<br>
Measurement of the reflectance (Rsuttilase) on the test material is performed at 460 nm using a Macbeth ColorEye 7000 photometer<br><br>
(Macbeth^ Division of Kollmorgen Instruments Corporation, Germany) . The measurements are performed accordance with the manufacturer's protocol.<br>
In order to determine a blank value, a similar wash experiment is performed without addition of enzyme. The subsequent measurement of the reflectance (Rblank) is performed as described right above.<br>
A reference experiment is then performed as described above, wherein the wash performance of Savinase® is tested. The subsequent measurement of the reflectance (Rsavinase) is performed as described right above.<br>
The wash performance is evaluated by means of the Performance Factor  (P)  which is defined in accordance with the below<br>
formula:<br><br><br>
The performance of the subtilase of the invention in ADW was tested in a commercial available household dish wash composition (Somat Turbo, from Henkel Waschmittel GmbH) using Standard conditions. The soil used was an egg/milk mixture coated on a steel plate. Further, a ballast soil containing various foodstuffs was added.<br>
Detergent:	Somat Turbo<br>
Detergent dosage       4 . 0 g/1<br>
pH	10.7 (as is)<br>
Water hardness:        3°dH (machine ion exchanger)<br>
Temperature:	55°C<br>

Wash program:	Program 4 without pre-flush<br>
Materials<br>
220 ml full cream milk<br>
15 eggS, medium size<br>
Steel plates, diameter 18 cm<br>
The Somat Turbo dish wash composition was heated at 85°C for 5 minutes in a microwave oven in order to inactivate enzyme activity in the composition.<br>
Soiling of steel plates<br>
220 ml full cream milk was mixed with 15 raw eggs in a Braun UK 20 kitchen machine for 2 minutes, After sieving, stainless steel plates were soiled in the mixture by immersion.<br><br>
The plates were dried overnight at room temperature in an upright position. The dried plates were then heated at 120°C for 45 minutes in order to denature the proteins on the surface.<br>
ADW experiments<br>
For each experiment^ 10 soiled plates were washed without pre-wash (Program 4) in a Cylinda Compact machine. In addition to the soiled plates, the machine was filled up with 10 porcelain plates, 4 glasses, 4 cups and 16 pieces of cutlery.<br>
Furthermore, 50 g of ballast slurry was added to the machine. The composition of the slurry was as follows:<br>
Potato starch (5.43%), wheat flour (4,38%), vegetable oil (4.32%), margarine (4,32%), lard (4.32%), cream (8.76%), full cream milk (8.76%), eggs (8.76%), tomato ketchup (3,00%), barbecue sauce (2,19%), mustard (4.00%), benzoic acid (0.73%), water (3 mM Ca2+ + Mg2+) (36.71%),<br>
Measurements and calculations<br>
The light reflection values (R-values) were measured at six<br>
different locations on the plates using a Minolta Chroma Meter<br>
(Type: CR-300) . Measurements were made on clean plates (Rciean) r<br>
on soiled plates after heating (Rsoiied) and on plates after wash<br>
(Rafter -wash) •<br>
The removed protein film (%RPF) was calculated according to the below formula:<br>
%RPF   =   100%   X    (Pwafter wash   ~  Rsoiled) / (Rciean   ~   Rsoiled)<br>
Using the above test method the following results were obtained (± indicates the standard deviation) :<br><br><br>
