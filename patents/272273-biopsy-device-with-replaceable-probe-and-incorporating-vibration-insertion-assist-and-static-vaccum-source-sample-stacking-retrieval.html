BIOPSY DEVICE WITH REPLACEABLE PROBE AND<br>
INCORPORATING VIBRATION INSERTION ASSIST AND STATIC<br>
VACUUM SOURCE SAMPLE STACKING RETRIEVAL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[OO01]	The present invention relates in general to biopsy devices, and more particularly<br>
to biopsy devices having a cutter for severing tissue, and even more particularly to biopsy<br>
devices for multiple sampling with a probe remaining inserted.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002!	When a suspicious tissue mass is discovered in a patient's breast through<br>
examination, ultrasound, MRI, X-ray imaging or the like, it is often necessary to perform<br>
a biopsy procedure to remove one or more samples of mat tissue in order to determine<br>
whether the mass contains cancerous cells. A biopsy may be performed using an open or<br>
percutaneous method.<br>
[0003]	An open biopsy is performed by making a large incision in the breast and<br>
removing either the entire mass, called an excisional biopsy, or a substantial portion of it,<br>
known as an incisional biopsy. An open biopsy is a surgical procedure that is usually<br>
done as an outpatient procedure in a hospital or a surgical center, involving both high cost<br>
and a high level of trauma to the patient. Open biopsy carries a relatively higher risk of<br>
infection and bleeding than does percutaneous biopsy, and the disfigurement that<br>
sometimes results from an open biopsy may make it difficult to read future<br>
mammograms. Further, the aesthetic considerations of the patient make open biopsy even<br>
less appealing due to the risk of disfigurement. Given that a high percentage of biopsies<br>
show that the suspicious tissue mass is not cancerous, the downsides of the open biopsy<br>
procedure render this method inappropriate in many cases.<br>
[0004]	Percutaneous biopsy, to the contrary, is much less invasive than open biopsy.<br>
Percutaneous biopsy may be performed using fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle<br>
biopsy. In FNA, a very thin needle is used to withdraw fluid and cells from the suspicious<br>
 <br>
-2-<br>
tissue mass. This method has an advantage in that it is very low-pain, so low-pain that<br>
local anesthetic is not always used because the application of it maybe more painful than<br>
the 1<na itself. however a shortcoming of fna is that only small number cells are></na>
obtained through the procedure, rendering it relatively less useful in analyzing the<br>
suspicious tissue and making an assessment of the progression of the cancer less simple if<br>
the sample is found to be malignant.<br>
[0005]	During a core needle biopsy, a small tissue sample is removed allowing for a<br>
pathological assessment of the tissue, including an assessment of the progression of any<br>
cancerous cells that are found. The following patent documents disclose various core<br>
biopsy devices and are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety: US 6,273,862<br>

issued June 23, 1998; US 5,649,547 issued July 22, 1997; US 5,526,822 issued June 18,<br>
1996; and US Patent Application 2003/0199753 published Oct. 23, 2003 to Hibner et al.<br>
[0006]	At present, a biopsy instrument marketed under the tradename MAMMOTOME is<br>
commercially available from ETHICON ENDO-SURGERY, INC. for use in obtaining<br>
breast biopsy samples. These devices generally retrieve multiple core biopsy samples<br>
from one insertion into breast tissue with vacuum assistance. In particular, a cutter tube is<br>
extended into a probe to cut tissue prolapsed into a side aperture under vacuum assistance<br>
and then the cutter tube is fully retracted between cuts to extract the sample.<br>
[0007]|	With a long probe, the rate of sample taking is limited not only by the time<br>
required to rotate or reposition the probe but also by the time needed to translate the<br>
cutter. As an alternative to this "long stroke" biopsy device, a "short stroke" biopsy<br>
device is described in the following commonly assigned patent applications: US Patent<br>
Application 10/676,944, "Biopsy Instrument with Internal Specimen Collection<br>
Mechanism" filed September 30, 2003 in the name of Hibner et al.; and US Patent<br>
Application 10/732,843, "Biopsy Device with Sample Tube" filed December 10, 2003 in<br>
the name of Cicenas et al. The cutter is cycled across the side aperture, reducing the<br>
sample time. Several alternative specimen collection mechanisms are described that draw<br>
 <br>
-3-<br>
samples through the cutter tube, all of which allow for taking multiple samples without<br>
removing the probe from the breast.<br>
[0008]	Even given the many advantages of such multiple sample taking core biopsy<br>
devices, in certain applications some surgeons continue to use less expensive biopsy<br>
devices guided in real time by an ultrasonic system. These simple biopsy systems omit a<br>
full function control console that operates the cutter and vacuum assistance. Instead, a<br>
manually controlled hand piece advances a cutter by either stored spring force, a constant<br>
pneumatic pressure source, or motor power. Then the surgeon activates a cutter motor to<br>
effect the tissue sample. Thus, the surgeon is challenged to maintain the biopsy probe at a<br>
desired surgical site while manipulating the patient's breast.<br>
[0009]	Consequently, it would be desirable to provide for a core biopsy device with a<br>
motorized cutter that provides increased functionality such as one-handed operation with<br>
assisted multiple sample retrieval with only one insertion of the probe, yet be able to<br>
retain the economical aspects of simple core biopsy devices that lack elaborate remote<br>
control systems.<br>
[0010]	Spring-fired core needle biopsy devices rely upon a firing mechanism that thrusts<br>
forward a needle and a cutter to penetrate the tissue and to obtain a tissue sample rather<br>
than palpitating tissue to prolapse into a side aperture of a probe. Frequently, a surgeon<br>
may encounter an area of dense tissue that is more difficult to penetrate than the<br>
surrounding tissue during core needle biopsy. In particular, the lesion or tissue mass being<br>
targeted in the biopsy procedure may be difficult to penetrate, requiring the physician to<br>
push the biopsy needle with considerable force and/or speed in an attempt to penetrate the<br>
lesion and collect a sample.<br>
[0011]	When encountering such an area of dense tissue, it is common for surgeons using<br>
the type of firing core needle biopsy device described above to fire the device in order to<br>
penetrate the lesion and obtain a sample. However, due to the length of the firing stroke<br>
of such devices, which may be as long as 0.75 inches, it is nearly impossible for the<br>
surgeon to control the travel of the needle after firing. Consequently, the long needle<br>
stroke may cause uncertainty as to the needle tip location post fire. This may cause the<br>
surgeon to obtain a sample from the wrong area. In addition to missing the targeted tissue,<br>
long firing strokes may cause the needle to puncture the chest wall or pierce the skin,<br>
particularly when the targeted area is near the patient's chest wall. Even if the skin is not<br>
 <br>
-4-<br>
pierced, the long travel of the needle, along with the likelihood that the needle will be<br>
pushed off course by the force of the firing stroke, may lead to needlessly increased<br>
trauma for the patient. These spring-fired biopsy devices also yield a single sample per<br>
insertion, thus limiting the amount of diagnostic and therapeutic treatment that may be<br>
achieved without the increased discomfort and tissue trauma from repeated insertions.<br>
Based on surgeons' use of the long firing stroke feature of current devices to aid in<br>
penetrating tissue lesions, it is clear that the medical community sees the benefit of firing<br>
assistance when inserting a probe to the desired location.<br>
[0012]	In commonly-owned and co-pending US Pat. Application No. 11/035,873,<br>
BIOPSY INSTRUMENT WITH IMPROVED NEEDLE PENETRATION to Beckman,<br>
at al., filed on January 10, 2005, manual mechanisms are disclosed that impart small<br>
reciprocating motions to the probe of a core biopsy device to render assistance in<br>
penetrating tissue, yet cutting is performed after the probe is properly positioned, thus<br>
avoiding taking samples from the wrong location. While there are advantages to having<br>
such cutting assistance imparted by manual actuation, it is generally desirable to alleviate<br>
the need for the surgeon to perform this additional action while having to manually<br>
position (he biopsy device.<br>
[0013]	Additionally, it would be desirable to provide for a hand-held core biopsy device<br>
that automatically imparts a motion to the probe that assists in penetrating dense tissue yet<br>
does not take a sample.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014]	The present invention addresses these and other problems of the prior art by<br>
providing a core biopsy device having a probe assembly with a probe support structure<br>
that holds a probe having a side aperture. A cutter tube is slidingly received by the probe<br>
and sized to translate across the side aperture to sever prolapsed tissue. A hand piece<br>
includes a hand piece support structure having a lateral engaging portion that receives the<br>
probe assembly. A lead screw is attached for rotation to the hand piece support structure.<br>
A cutter carriage is longitudinally translated by rotation of the lead screw thereby<br>
translating the cutter tube. Thereby, an economical incorporation of a replaceable probe<br>
and cutter tube into a laterally mounted assembly allows reuse of a powered hand piece.<br>
 <br>
-5-<br>
[0015]	In one aspect consistent with other aspects of the invention, a biopsy device<br>
includes a frame supported core biopsy probe, the frame spring biased to a housing. A<br>
motor driven cam wheel coupled to the housing urges the frame against the spring bias,<br>
imparting a reciprocating longitudinal movement to the core biopsy probe to assist in<br>
penetrating dense tissue.<br>
[0016]	In another aspect of the invention, a biopsy device includes the replaceable probe<br>
assembly that engages a motor-driven carriage assembly that sequences distal translation<br>
of a rotated cutter tube with vacuum assistance sequenced from a constant vacuum source<br>
by the position of the cutter tube. Thereby, advantages of consistent prolapse of tissue<br>
into the probe is achieved with a commonly available vacuum source.<br>
[0017|	In yet another aspect of the invention, a biopsy device obtains tissue samples that<br>
prolapse into a sample aperture in a probe needle that are then severed by a translating<br>
cutter tube received in the probe needle. A sample straw is proximally received in the<br>
cutter tube to capture these severed tissue samples. As these severed tissue samples are<br>
sequentially stacked in the sample straw, an indicator tube is forced proximally out of the<br>
sample straw to give a visual indication as to the number of tissue samples obtained. The<br>
stored tissue samples advantageously are maintained in the order taken, which aids in<br>
further diagnostic assessment.<br>
[0018]	In yet a further aspect of the invention, a biopsy device obtains tissue samples that<br>
prolapse into a sample aperture in a probe needle that are then severed by a translating<br>
cutter tube received in the probe needle. A storage tube communicates with a proximal<br>
end of the cutter tube so that a vacuum control may apply a vacuum through the storage<br>
tube and the cutter tube to retract severed tissue samples there through. The stored tissue<br>
samples are also advantageously maintained in the order taken to aid in further diagnostic<br>
assessment.<br>
[0019]	In yet an additional aspect of the invention, a hand piece has a hand piece support<br>
structure having a lateral engaging portion operatively configured to engage a probe<br>
support structure of a selected one of a first and second probe assemblies. A lead screw<br>
translates a cutter carriage that advances a cutter tube within a probe needle of the<br>
selected probe assembly. One probe assembly includes a sample straw that is proximally<br>
advanced by a cutter carriage of the hand piece that is longitudinally translated by rotation<br>
of the lead screw to retract tissue samples. The other probe assembly has a storage tube<br>
 <br>
-6-<br>
that communicates with the cutter tube for pneumatically retracting tissue samples.<br>
Thereby, economical incorporation of a common hand piece may be realized while<br>
providing the clinical flexibility of choosing a disposable probe assembly with a desired<br>
approach to tissue sample retraction.<br>
[0020]	In yet another aspect of the invention, a method of obtaining core biopsy samples<br>
advantageously maintains samples taken in a sequential stack to enhance diagnostic<br>
assessment thereof. This orientation is achieved by inserting a core biopsy needle into<br>
tissue, prolapsing tissue into an opening of the core biopsy needle and then translating a<br>
cutter tube through the core biopsy needle to sever the prolapsed tissue to form a first<br>
tissue sample. These steps are repeated with each tissue sample being sequentially urged<br>
into a sample lumen, that proximally communicates with the cutter tube. Thereby, the<br>
sequential stacking is maintained for lateral retrieval and analysis.<br>

apparent from the accompanying drawings and the description thereof.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0077]	In FIGS. 1-4, a biopsy device 10 has a reusable hand piece 12 and a disposable<br>
probe 14 that enables economical taking of multiple percutaneous core biopsy samples by<br>
accessing a standard medical vacuum pump or wall-mounted vacuum access port (not<br>
shown) through an interfacing vacuum conduit 16. In the illustrative version, the hand<br>
piece 12 is self-powered and suitable for use in conjunction with ultrasonic diagnostic<br>
imaging. The disposable probe 14 reduces the portion of biopsy device 10 that requires<br>
protective packaging to avoid contact with sharp surfaces and to keep it sterile prior to<br>
use. Further economy is accomplished by reducing the portion of the biopsy device 10<br>
that is disposed as medical waste between uses. Movable components of the disposable<br>
probe 14 are advantageously locked until mounted in an access trough 18 formed in a<br>
housing 20 of the reusable hand piece 12. It should be appreciated that one or more<br>
standard mechanical, pneumatic, or electrical latches (not shown) may be integrated into<br>
the biopsy device 10 to secure the disposable probe 14 to the reusable hand piece 12.<br>
[0078]	With particular reference to FIG. 3, the disposable probe assembly 14 includes a<br>
substantially rectangular cover 22 sized to close the access trough recess 18 (FIGS. 2, 4).<br>
An end slot 24 formed in the cover 20 (FIGS. 1-2,4) is closed by a probe union sleeve 26<br>
attached to an inner surface 27 of the substantially rectangular cover 22. A core biopsy<br>
needle ("probe") assembly 28 passes longitudinally through the probe union sleeve 26<br>
and is formed by a probe tube 30 with underlying vacuum lumen 32 that communicates<br>
with a side aperture 34 through holes 35 (FIG. 23) near a distal opening 36 of the probe<br>
tube 30 that is closed by a piercing tip 38. A cutter tube 40 is sized to closely fit and<br>
translate within an inner diameter (i.e., cutter lumen) of the probe tube 30 with a length<br>
sufficient to close the side aperture 34 with a proximal end 42 extending from the probe<br>
union sleeve 26 to attach to a cutter gear 44, as depicted in FIG. 1.<br>
[0079]	Proximal to the probe union sleeve 26 is an elongate slot 50 that is part of a<br>
vacuum assist valve assembly 52. The cutter gear 44 includes distal and proximal annular<br>
recesses 54, 56 flanking spur gear teeth 58 that engage the reusable hand piece 12 as<br>
described below. A more distal annular recess 60 is gripped by a post 62 that is engaged<br>
 <br>
-12-<br>
to longitudmaUy translate in an elongate post slot 64 of a distal portion 66 of a vacuum<br>
valve actuator 68. A cylindrical proximal portion 70 of the vacuum valve actuator 68 has<br>
distal and proximal O-ring grooves 72, 73 that respectively retain distal and proximal<br>
dynamic O-ring seals 74, 75 that move within a distally open cylindrical valve bore 76 of<br>
a valve body 78 molded onto an outer surface 79 of the substantially rectangular cover 22<br>
(FIG. 2).<br>
[0080]	As described below, the vacuum valve actuator 68 selectively allows<br>
communication between a proximal port 80, a center port 82, and a distal port 84 (FIG.<br>
2). In particular, with the cutter gear 44 retracted, the proximal and center ports 80, 82 are<br>
in communication. With the cutter gear translated distally, the center and distal ports 82,<br>
84 communicate. The center port 82 is attached to a distal vacuum conduit 86 whose<br>
other end is connected through the rectangular cover 22 to the probe union sleeve 26. It<br>
should be appreciated that the probe union sleeve 26 includes pneumatic passages that<br>
communicate between a proximal end of the vacuum lumen 32 and the distal vacuum<br>
conduit 86. The distal port 84 is attached to a hose nib 88 that is exposed to atmospheric<br>
pressure. Hose nib 88 may include an air and/or saline filter. Alternatively, hose nib 88<br>
may be connected to a positive pressure source (e.g., fluid pump) or a negative pressure<br>
source (e.g., vacuum pump, syringe) to aspirate fluids. Likewise, hose nib 88 may be used<br>
to lavage the tissue cavity with saline, pain medication , or bleeding control fluids.. The<br>
proximal port 80 communicates through a proximal vacuum conduit 90 to the interfacing<br>
vacuum conduit 16.<br>
[0081]	With further reference to FIG. 3, a sample extraction feature is incorporated so<br>
that multiple samples may be made without the need to remove the probe assembly 28<br>
from tissue nor even to foil retract the cutter tube 40 to retract a tissue specimen to the<br>
reusable hand piece 12. In the illustrative version, this feature is accomplished with a<br>
stacking straw assemblylOO. An elongate straw 102 is scored down its length on opposite<br>
sides by grooves 104 defining first and second straw halves 106, 108, whose respective<br>
proximal, outer surfaces 110, 112 are attached to triangular grips 114, 116, respectively.<br>
A locking strip 118 extends distally from one triangular grip 114 and is attached along a<br>
proximal portion of the first straw half 106.<br>
[0082]	Distal and proximal tabs 120, 122 extend from the inner surface 27 of the<br>
substantially rectangular cover 22, each having a respective through hole 124, 126<br>
 <br>
-13-<br>
through which the stacking straw assembly 100 is inserted. The through holes 124, 126<br>
are shaped to allow the locking strip 118 to rotate ninety (90) degrees. A bayonet locking<br>
member 130 also extends from the inner surface 27 of the substantially rectangular cover<br>
22 just distal and laterally offset from the through hole 124 of the distal tab 120 to lock<br>
into an alignment locking slot 132 in the locking strip 118 when laterally rotated. The<br>
bayonet locking member 130 prevents axial movement of the stacking straw assembly<br>
100. The cutter gear 44 and cutter tube 40 cannot move proximally due to contact with<br>
the stacking straw assembly 100 and cannot move distally due to contact with the probe<br>
union sleeve 26. By securing both the cutter gear 44 and the stacking straw assembly 100<br>
in a full distal axial position, the disposable probe 14 is aligned to engage the components<br>
of the reusable hand piece 12 as described below. Distal to the alignment locking slot<br>
132, a rectangular recess 134, formed in the locking strip 118, defines a distal-most<br>
locking finger 136 for engaging components of the reusuable hand piece 12 that positions<br>
the stacking straw assembly 100 as described below. An indicator tube 150 has a stacked<br>
cone-shaped outer surface 152 (FIG. 14) that slides within the elongate straw 104 that in<br>
turn slides within the cutter tube 40.<br>
[0083]	With particular reference to FIG. 4, the reusable hand piece 12 includes four user<br>
controls aligned on a top surface 160 of the housing 20, specifically from most distal to<br>
most proximal: a forward motor rotation key 162, a reverse motor rotation key 164, a<br>
saline Hush key 166 and a slide button 168 for selecting insertion mode or sample taking<br>
mode. The keys 162-166 control a control circuit 170, which may include integral power<br>
storage (e.g., batteries, fuel cell, etc.) for untethered use. The forward motor rotation key<br>
162 causes a DC motor 172 to rotate its motor output shaft 174 in a forward rotation. A<br>
slide spur gear 176 includes an internal keyed engagement with a longitudinal key groove<br>
178 on the motor output shaft 174 that allows longitudinal positioning by the slide button<br>
168. In particular, fore and aft brackets 180, 182 of the slide button 168 engage distal and<br>
aft annular grooves 184,186 that flank spur gear teeth 188 of the slide spur gear 176.<br>
[0084]	When the slide button 168 is moved distally, the slide spur gear 176 engages a<br>
tissue penetration gear 190 that spins on a common shaft centerline 192 forward of a<br>
gearbox input gear 196. Gearbox input gear 196 consists of a distal small gear 198 and a<br>
proximal large gear 200. The tissue penetration gear 190 has spur gear teeth 206 that<br>
engage the slide spur gear 176. A frame hub 212 projects proximally from the frame 204<br>
with a strike pin 214 projecting upwardly from the frame hub 212. In FIG. 4 and 13, a<br>
 <br>
-14-<br>
oircular cam wheel 216 is attached to a distal side of the tissue penetration gear 190.<br>
Rotating the tissue penetration gear 190 urges the strike pin 214, and thus the frame 204,<br>
proximally. In FIG. 12, left and right spring cavities 218, 220 (when viewed from above),<br>
formed longitudinally in distal corners of the frame 204, respectively receive inwardly<br>
projecting left and right tabs 222, 224 from the cover 20 and receive left and right<br>
compression springs 226, 228. Movement of the frame 204 proximally compresses these<br>
compression springs 226,228 that thereafter assert a restoring force.<br>
[0085]	When the slide button 168 is moved proximally into engagement with the gearbox<br>
input gear 196, specifically the distal small gear 198, also engages and turns a translation<br>
large input gear 230 whose shaft 232 passes through an aft wall 234 of the frame 204. The<br>
proximal large gear 200 of the gearbox input gear 196 engages and turns a rotation small<br>
input gear 236 whose shaft 238 passes through the aft wall 234. The frame 204 includes a<br>
carriage recess 240, defined between a partition 242 and the aft wall 234, that contains<br>
longitudinally aligned left side lead (translation) screw 244 and right-side rotation spur<br>
gear 246 that are attached for rotation respectively with the shafts 232, 238. The partition<br>
7.42 is positioned aft of the left and right tabs 222, 224 of the cover 20 and also defines in<br>
part the left and right spring cavities 218, 220. An unlocking cam 247 projects proximally<br>
from and is longitudinally centered on the aft wall 234 above the position of the lead<br>
(translation) screw 244 and rotation spur gear 246.<br>
[0086]	The rotation spur gear 246 engages the cutter gear 44 when the disposable probe<br>
14 is inserted, imparting a rotation as the cutter tube 40 and cutter gear 44 translate<br>
longitudinally in response to the rotation of the lead (translation) screw 244. This<br>
translation is caused by lead screw threads 248. In particular, a distal cutter carriage 250<br>
is longitudinally moved on the lead screw threads 248. Distal and proximal J-hook<br>
extensions 252, 254 project downwardly from the distal cutter carriage 250 to engage the<br>
distal and proximal annular recesses 54, 56 of the cutter gear 44 (FIG. 3). Distal of the<br>
cutter carriage 250, a biasing spring 256 urges against the cutter carriage 250, which<br>
assists in engagement of the lead screw threads 248 with the distal cutter carriage 250.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 4 and 19, a sliding pin 260 has a proximal carriage sliding pin<br>
retainer 266 attached to a proximal straw carriage 258. Shaft 264 also passes through a<br>
distal carriage sliding pin retainer 270 attached to the distal cutter carriage 250. Sliding<br>
pin 260 has a proximal end 262 and a distal end 268 to prevent the sliding pin 260 from<br>
disengaging from the carriage sliding pin retainers 266, 270. A sliding pin spring 272<br>
 <br>
-15-<br>
resides on the sliding pin 260 and is constrained at each end by carriage sliding pin<br>
retainers 266, 270.<br>
[0087]	With the components FIGS. 1-4 now introduced, a sequence of use of the biopsy<br>
device 10 will be described. The interfacing vacuum lumen 16 is attached to the<br>
disposable probe assembly 14 (FIGS. 1-2). The disposable probe assembly 14 is installed<br>
into the reusable hand piece 12 (FIGS. 5-8). In so doing, the distal cutter carriage 250<br>
engages the cutter gear 44 (FIG. 9), the proximal straw carriage 258 engages the locking<br>
strip 1.18 of the stacking straw assembly 100 (FIG. 10), and the bayonet locking member<br>
130 is deflected by the unlocking cam 247, longitudinally unlocking from the alignment<br>
locking slot 132 of the locking strip 118 (FIG. 11) allowing longitudinal movement of the<br>
cutter lube 40 and the straw stacking assembly 100.<br>
[0088]	In FIGS. 12, 14, the cutter and straw carriages 250, 258 may initially be distally<br>
advanced to close the side aperture 34 of its probe tube 30 with the cutter tube 40 and the<br>
stacking straw assembly 100 also fully distally advanced to minimize proximal extension<br>
of its elongate straw 102.<br>
[0089]	In FIG. 13, the piercing tip 38 of the core biopsy needle (probe) assembly 28 is<br>
assisted in penetrating tissue by moving the slide button 168 distally to a "tissue insertion<br>
mode" wherein the slide spur gear 176 engages the tissue penetration gear 190.<br>
Depression of the forward motor rotation key 162 turns these gears 176, 190 causing the<br>
circular cam wheel 216 to turn against strike pin 214 that creates proximal longitudinal<br>
motion of frame 204 and core biopsy needle (probe) assembly 28 of approximately 0.1<br>
inch at a rotation rate of 7 cycles per second. Left and right compression springs 226, 228<br>
provide the restoring distal longitudinal motion to frame 204 and disposable probe 14 as<br>
left and right compression springs 226, 228 are repeatedly compressed between the<br>
forward surface of the left and right spring cavities 218, 220 as the frame 204 and the left<br>
and right tabs 222, 224 of the housing 20. The restoring distal longitudinal motion to<br>
frame 204 and core biopsy needle (probe) assembly 28 result in a corresponding distal<br>
motion of piecing tip 3 8 that assists in penetrating tissue.<br>
[0090]	In FIG. 15, with the side aperture 40 positioned within the tissue to take samples,<br>
the slide button 168 is moved proximally to engage the slide spur gear 176 with the distal<br>
small gear 198 of the gearbox input gear 196. When the forward motor rotation key 162 is<br>
depressed, the DC motor 172 rotates in a forward direction, turning the slide spur gear<br>
 <br>
-16-<br>
176, which turns the distal small gear 198 that directly turns the translation large input<br>
gear 230 that is connected by the shaft 232 through the aft wall 234 of the frame 204 to<br>
the lead (translation) screw 244. Meanwhile, the proximal large gear 200 of the gearbox<br>
input gear 196 rotates the small input gear 236 that turns shaft 238 through aft wall 234 to<br>
turn the rotation spur gear 246.<br>
[0091]	With the carriages 250, 258 distally advanced as depicted in FIGS. 15-16, the<br>
cylindrical proximal portion 70 of the vacuum valve actuator 68 is also distally positioned<br>
as depicted in FIG. 17. The hose nib 88 is thus in fluid communication through the distal<br>
port 84, through the distally open cylindrical valve bore 76 between distal and proximal<br>
dynamic O-ring seals 74,75 to the center port 82 through the distal vacuum conduit 86 to<br>
the vacuum lumen 32.<br>
[0092]	In FIGS. 18-19, depression of the reverse motor rotation key 164 causes the lead<br>
(translation) screw 244 to rotate in a reverse direction. Sliding pin spring 272 between the<br>
distal cutter carriage 250 and the proximal straw carriage 258 urges the proximal straw<br>
carriage 258 into engagement with the lead screw thread 248, causing the straw carriage<br>
258 to move proximally as the cutter carriage 250 free wheels on an unthreaded distal<br>
portion of the lead screw 244. The straw carriage 258 draws back the elongate straw 102<br>
and the indicator tube 150 (FIG. 20). As the straw carriage 258 approaches the proximal<br>
portion of the lead screw 244, the distal end 268 of sliding pin 260 contacts the distal<br>
carriage sliding pin retainer 270 on distal cutter carriage 250, pulling the distal cutter<br>
carriage 250 onto the lead screw thread 248. Thereafter, the cutter carriage 250 and the<br>
cutter tube 40 are retracted as the straw carriage 258 free wheels (FIGS. 21-22).<br>
[0093]	Alternately, sliding pin spring 272 may be replaced with a ball detent mechanism<br>
(not shown) located on frame 204 that would engage with a small depression in proximal<br>
straw carriage 258. This alternate mechanism in conjunction with biasing spring 256<br>
would cause both the distal cutter carriage 250 and proximal straw carriage 258 to retract<br>
simultaneously from their fully distal position and to advance sequentially from their fully<br>
proximal position (i.e., cutter carriage 250 would fully advance and then the straw<br>
carriage 258 would advance).<br>
[0094]	At the end of the proximal movement of the cutter tube 40, vacuum valve actuator<br>
68 is moved proximally such that the distal and proximal dynamic O-ring seals 74, 75<br>
bracket the proximal port 80 and center port 82 of the distally open cylindrical valve bore<br>
 <br>
-17-<br>
76. Thereby, the intertiacing vacuum conduit 16 draws air through the proximal vacuum<br>
conduit 90, through the valve body 78, through the distal vacuum conduit 86, and<br>
ultimately from the vacuum lumen 32 (FIG. 24). In FIG. 23, this suction draws tissue 280<br>
into the side aperture 34 of the probe assembly 28.<br>
[0095]	It should be appreciated that in the illustrative version, the distal cutter carriage<br>
250 does not freewheel (FIG. 21) in its proximal-most position. Instead, rotation of the<br>
motor is stopped as the distal cutter carriage 250 is about to contact the proximal straw<br>
carriage 258 with closed-loop control based on an encoder (not shown) coupled to the DC<br>
motor 172 enabling accurate positioning of the motor output shaft 174. Alternatively,<br>
freewheeling may be incorporated at the proximal-most position of the distal cutter<br>
carriage 250 by adding a section of no helical threads to the proximal end of the lead<br>
(translation) screw 244 equal to the longitudinal thickness of the distal cutter carriage<br>
250.<br>
[0096]	It should further be appreciated that free wheeling may be provided for cutter<br>
translation even without stacking straw sample retraction to avoid reliance upon other<br>
structures to block further translation or more elaborate closed loop position control.<br>
[0097]	The forward motor rotation key 162 is depressed to advance the cutter tube 40,<br>
rotating lead (translation) screw 244 and rotation spur gear 246, as depicted in FIG. 25.<br>
Due to sliding pin spring 272 between carriages 250, 258, only the distal cutter carriage<br>
250 engages with the lead screw threads 248 of the lead (translation) screw 244 and<br>
translates distally initially cutting tissue 280, as depicted in FIG. 26. Once the distal cutter<br>
carriage 250 approaches its distal-most position, the sliding pin 260 pulls the proximal<br>
straw carriage 258 into engagement with the lead screw threads 248 of the lead<br>
(translation) screw 244. As the cutter carriage 250 freewheels, the elongate straw 102 is<br>
distally translated to encompass a first severed tissue sample 280a, displacing proximally<br>
the indicator tube 150 a corresponding amount.<br>
[0098]	At this point, depression of the reverse motor rotation key 164 causes retraction of<br>
the proximal straw carriage 258 (FIG. 18) with the side aperture 134 communicating with<br>
atmospheric pressure (FIG. 17) as previously discussed so that the first severed tissue<br>
sample 280a remains within the elongate straw 280a. It should be appreciated that<br>
repeating the retraction and advancement of the cutter carriage 250 thereafter results in a<br>
second severed tissue sample 280b being encompassed by the elongate straw 102 and the<br>
 <br>
-18-<br>
indicator tube 150 being further proximally displaced thereby as depicted in FIG. 27. An<br>
additional retention feature is depicted in FIG. 27 wherein small bent-up, proximally<br>
directed tabs 284 formed in the elongate straw 102 resist distal movement of the severed<br>
tissue samples 280a, 280b. This automated sequencing of the cutter and straw carriages<br>
250, 258 during retraction and advancement may be repeated a number of times to take a<br>
plurality of samples without withdrawing the probe assembly 28 from tissue 280. The<br>
surfaces of the elongate  straw 102 may be coated with lubricous materials to aid in<br>
proximal movement of tissue through the elongate straw 102 and to reduce friction<br>
between the elongate straw 102 and the cutter tube 40. Likewise, to aid in proximal<br>
movement of tissue through the elongate straw 102, the diameter of the elongate straw<br>
102 and the cutter tube 40 may be increased slightly some distance proximal from their<br>
distal end to reduce the friction of the tissue through the elongate straw 102.<br>
[0099]	In FIG. 28, a proximal end of the stacking straw assembly 100 includes a one-way<br>
latch (mechanical diode) 290 that engages the stacked cone shaped outer surface 152 of<br>
the indicator tube 150 as it proximally extends out of the elongate straw 102 preventing<br>
its being pneumatically drawn back into the elongate straw 102 when subsequently<br>
exposed to vacuum pressure.<br>
[00100]	In FIGS. 29, 30, the proximal straw carriage 258 is shown to include distal and<br>
proximal J-hooks 300, 302 that encompass on three sides the stacking straw assembly<br>
100. In particular, the rectangular recess 134 formed in the locking strip 118 is sized to<br>
longitudinally bracket the J-hooks 300, 302 with the distal locking finger 136 preventing<br>
retraction as depicted in FIG. 29 when the triangular grips 114, 116 are positioned<br>
horizontally (FIG. 31), as would be typical before and during use of the biopsy device 10.<br>
The surgeon may wish to segregate samples as they are taken or to take more samples<br>
than possible within one stacking straw assembly 100. Extraction and replacement of the<br>
stacking straw assembly 100 is allowed by rotating the triangular grips one quarter turn<br>
counterclockwise (as viewed proximally) as depicted in FIG. 32, which rotates the<br>
locking finger 136 out of alignment with the J-hooks 300, 302 of the straw carriage 258<br>
(FIG. 30). A new stacking.straw assembly 100 is then reinserted in reverse fashion.<br>
[00101]	In FIG. 33, samples contained in the removed stacking straw assembly 100 may<br>
be accessed by pulling apart the triangular grips 114, 116 causing the grooves 104 to peel<br>
apart the first and second straw halves 106, 108, which need not be symmetric. The<br>
 <br>
-19-<br>
samples may be removed individually or the samples and the straw half 106 portion of the<br>
straw 102 in which they are located may be put directly into a formalin solution for<br>
pathological preparation. Alternately, the samples contained in the stacking straw<br>
assembly 100 can be removed from the elongate straw 102 with a simple plunger-like rod<br>
(not shown) eliminating the need to peel apart the straw to access the tissue samples.<br>
[00102] Although the integral vacuum assistance supported by a medical vacuum pump<br>
may often be advantageous, some surgeons may desire to palpitate tissue into a side<br>
aperture of a probe assembly without the assistance of vacuum. To that end, in FIGS. 34-<br>
36, an alternative disposable probe 414 is depicted that omits a vacuum valve capability<br>
that responds to the cutter position but is otherwise identical to the afore-described<br>
disposable probe 14. The modified components of the disposable probe assembly 414<br>
include a substantially rectangular cover 422 sized to close the access trough recess 18 of<br>
the reusable hand piece 12 (not shown in FIGS. 34-36). The probe union sleeve 26,<br>
attached to the inner surface 27 of the substantially rectangular cover 422, communicates<br>
through a short pneumatic conduit 425 that terminates on the outer surface 79 at a hose<br>
nib 427. Hose nib 427 may include an air and/or saline filter. Alternatively, hose nib 427<br>
may be connected to a positive pressure source (e.g. fluid pump) or a negative pressure<br>
source (e.g., vacuum pump, syringe) to aspirate fluids. Hose nib 427 could also be used to<br>
lavage the tissue cavity with saline, pain medication, or bleeding control fluids. A core<br>
biopsy needle ("probe") assembly 428 that passes longitudinally through the probe union<br>
sleeve 26 differs in that a cutter gear 444 needs only engage and respond to the distal<br>
cutter carnage 250 (not shown in FIGS. 34-36) and not also position a pneumatic valve.<br>
Cutter guide tab 445 extends out from the inner surface 27 to provide a distal stop for<br>
cutter gear 444. Prior to insertion of the disposable probe 414 into the reusable hand piece<br>
12 (not shown in FIGS. 34-36), the bayonet locking member 430 prevents axial<br>
movement of the stacking straw assembly 100. The cutter gear 444 and cutter tube 40<br>
cannot move proximally due to contact with the stacking straw assembly 100 and cannot<br>
move distally due to contact with the cutter guide tab 445. By securing both the cutter and<br>
straw in a fully distal axial position, it insures that when the disposable probe 414 is<br>
inserted into the reusable hand piece 12 that the cutter gear 444 and stacking straw<br>
assembly 100 align and engage with the correct components within the reusable hand<br>
piece 12.<br>
 <br>
-20-<br>
[00103]	In FIG. 37, an alternative disposable assembly 514 is, as described in FIG. 3 but<br>
with the stacking straw assembly 100, replaced with a straw assembly 516 having distal<br>
tube 518 attached to a proximally attached luer fitting 520. The straw assembly 516 may<br>
be used to flush the cavity (via side aperture 34) with saline, epinephrine (or similar<br>
substances that reduce bleeding), or lidocane (or similar substances that reduce pain) by<br>
attaching a syringe or similar device (not shown) to the luer fitting 520. To remove the<br>
saline, epinephrine, or lidocane from the tissue, the cutter tube 40 may be fully or<br>
partially retracted to insure that the valve assist valve assembly 52 is positioned to<br>
connect the lateral lumen (distal vacuum conduit 86) with the vacuum source ( and not<br>
simply atmospheric pressure) as depicted in FIG. 24. The fluid would then be drawn from<br>
the tissue cavity (via side aperture 34), through the lateral lumen (distal vacuum conduit<br>
86) and into a canister located in line with the vacuum source (not shown).<br>
[00104]	In FIG. 38, an alternative biopsy needle (probe) assembly 628 is identical to that<br>
depicted in FIG. 14 with the exception of a probe tube 630 with through holes 631 placed<br>
proximate to the side aperture 34. The vacuum lumen 32 thus communicates with the<br>
holes 631 in the probe tube 630 as an alternate means to apply saline, epinephrine, or<br>
lidocane to the tissue cavity. These through holes 631 allow the fluid to reach the cavity<br>
while the elongate straw 102 and indicator tube 150 remain distally positioned in the<br>
cutter tube 40 (i.e., during the middle of a biopsy sampling procedure). In this case, the<br>
syringe would be attached to the hose nib 88 via a stopcock fitting (not shown). With the<br>
stopcock valve positioned to connect the syringe directly to the needle's lateral lumen<br>
(distal vacuum conduit 86), when the syringe is depressed the fluid will enter the lateral<br>
lumen (distal vacuum conduit 86) and then flow into the tissue through the through holes<br>
631 in the wall of the probe tube 630. The cutter tube 40 would be positioned distally<br>
(side aperture 34 closed) while the fluid is being inserted into the cavity to prevent the<br>
tissue indicator tube 150 from being moved proximally due to the fluid pressure. During<br>
subsequent sampling cycles, the fluid would then be aspirated from the tissue cavity.<br>
[00105] In FIGS. 39-45, an alternative proximal stacking disposable assembly 702 is<br>
depicted that may also be used with the reusable hand piece 12. Pneumatic force is<br>
employed to retrieve tissue samples rather than a mechanical movement from the reusable<br>
hand piece 12 that actuates a straw assembly. To that end, in FIG. 39, a core biopsy<br>
needle ("probe") assembly 704 is formed by a probe tube 706 with a distally positioned<br>
side aperture 708. A cutter tube 710 is sized to closely fit and translate within an inner<br>
 <br>
-21-<br>
diameter (i.e., cutter lumen) 712 of the probe tube 706 with a length sufficient to close the<br>
side aperture 708. The probe assembly 704 includes an underlying vacuum lumen 714<br>
that communicates with the cutter lumen 712 via through holes 716 underlying the side<br>
aperture 708. Both the probe tube 706 and vacuum lumen 714 distally terminate in open<br>
ends that communicate with each other via a curved manifold 718 defined inside of a<br>
piercing tip 720 that is attached as a distal-most portion of the probe assembly 704. A<br>
distal tissue stop 722 projects from the piercing tip 720 into the distal open end of the<br>
probe tube 706 to maintain prolapsed tissue inside a sampling bowl 724 under the side<br>
aperture 708 within the cutter lumen 712. Prolapsing occurs under the urging of axial<br>
vacuum force through the cutter lumen 712 and lateral vacuum force through the vacuum<br>
lumen 714 converging at the side aperture 708. After distal translation of the rotated<br>
cutter tube 712, a tissue sample 726 resides within a distal portion of the cutter tube 712,<br>
wherein an inner diameter of the cutter tube 712 defines a tissue sample lumen 728 for<br>
guiding retrieval of samples 726. Rather than subsequently distally advancing a straw to<br>
encompass and retract the tissue sample 726, axial vacuum pressure as depicted by arrow<br>
730 is asserted against a proximal face of the tissue sample 726 through the tissue sample<br>
lumen 728 with the cooperation of lateral pneumatic pressure as depicted by arrow 732<br>
through vacuum lumen 14 and curved manifold 718 to a distal face of the tissue sample<br>
726.<br>
[00106]	In FIGS. 40-45, the portions of the alternative proximal stacking disposable<br>
assembly 702 capture these tissue samples 726. A proximal end of the cutter tube 710<br>
extends through a probe union sleeve 734 to attach to a cutter gear 736. A proximal end<br>
of the vacuum lumen 714 terminates within the probe union sleeve 734. The alternative<br>
proximal stacking disposable assembly 702 includes a substantially rectangular cover 738<br>
sized to close the access trough recess 18 (FIGS. 2, 4), and omits pneumatic valve<br>
features. Instead, the distally positioned probe union sleeve 734 attached to an inner<br>
surface 740 of the substantially rectangular cover 738 communicates to a distal hose nib<br>
742 formed on an outer surface 744 of the rectangular cover 738 and to the vacuum<br>
lumen 714. A hose 746 is attached to the distal hose nib 742 to selectively provide<br>
pneumatic vacuum, pneumatic pressure, or fluid transfer (not shown). The alternate<br>
proximal stacking assembly 702 could likewise have a vacuum assist valve assembly 052<br>
as depicted in FIG. 2 to selectively provide pneumatic vacuum, pneumatic pressure, or<br>
Quid transfer to the vacuum lumen 714.<br>
 <br>
-22-<br>
[00107]	With particular reference to FIGS. 40, 42, a rear tube 748 is aligned proximally to<br>
the cutter tube 710 and coupled for longitudinal movement thereto, although the rear tube<br>
748 is disengaged from the rotational movement of the cutter tube 710. This coupled<br>
movement may be achieved by an actuator that engages the distal cutter carriage 250<br>
(FIG. 4) or by a circular lip and groove engagement between the cutter tube 710 and rear<br>
tube 748. The inner surface 740 of the rectangular cover 738 includes four support<br>
surfaces. First, a cutter guide 750 supports the cutter tube 710 proximal to the probe union<br>
sleeve 734 and distal to a most distal position of the cutter gear 736. A distal rear tube<br>
guide 752, is proximal to the most proximal position of the cutter gear 736, and a<br>
proximal rear tube guide 754, and distal to a most distal position of a proximal locking<br>
flange 756 of the rear tube 748, to maintain alignment of the rear tube 748. A bottom<br>
half-cylinder locking flange 758 at a proximal end of the rectangular cover 738<br>
cooperates with the proximal locking flange 756 of the rear tube 748 to lock to a sample<br>
holding portion 760 of the alternative proximal stacking disposable assembly 702. The<br>
sample holding portion 760 extends proximal to the rectangular cover 738 and the<br>
reusable hand piece 712 and thus may be readily replaced during a biopsy procedure.<br>
[00108] A distal locking half cylindrical portion 762 engages the bottom half-cylinder<br>
locking flange 758. The distal locking half cylindrical portion 762 is attached to a<br>
proximal half cylindrical portion 764 to form an outer sleeve 766. A reciprocating<br>
member 768, which engages the proximal locking flange 756 of the rear tube 748 and is<br>
partially encompassed by the outer sleeve 766, engages and distally advances a more<br>
proximal rod 770 out of an external vacuum lumen 772 defined as an inner diameter of an<br>
external vacuum tube 773. The rod has a down turned distal end 774 that exits an opening<br>
776	in the proximal half cylindrical portion 764. A flexible, peel-apart external tissue tube<br>
777	defining an external tissue lumen 778 is formed from an inwardly open channel 780<br>
closed by an elongate seal 782.<br>
[00109]	Rod 770 may be formed of a fluoropolymer resin material such as TEFLON™ or<br>
other suitable flexible material having a low coefficient of friction. Rod 770 maybe sized<br>
and shaped to conform closely to the inner diameter (i.e., vacuum lumen 772) of vacuum<br>
tube 773. The close fit between rod 770 and vacuum lumen 773, as well as the low<br>
friction properties of the rod 770, enable the rod 770 to translate easily within the vacuum<br>
lumen 772 without any loss of vacuum force through the distal end of the vacuum lumen<br>
772. The inwardly open channel 780 may advantageously be formed of polyvinyl<br>
 <br>
-23-<br>
ohloride or another similar type of flexible, water insoluble material so that stacked tissue<br>
samples may be visible. A proximal end of the open channel 780 is attached to and closed<br>
by a lumen peel tab 784. A proximal end of the external vacuum lumen 772 is attached to<br>
a vacuum line 786 via a tubing connector 788.<br>
[00110]	In FIGS. 40, 41, the alternative proximal stacking disposable assembly 702 is in<br>
an initial condition with the rod 770 at its proximal most position in the external vacuum<br>
lumen 772. The cutter gear 736 and thus the rear tube 748, reciprocating member 768 and<br>
flexible, peel-apart external tissue lumen 778 are in their distal most position. In FIGS.<br>
43, 44, the rod 770 has extruded distally out of the opening 776 in the proximal half<br>
cylindrical portion 764 of the outer sleeve 766, denoting reciprocating cycles to retract at<br>
least one tissue sample (not shown) that is held within a proximal portion of the external<br>
tissue lumen 778. The cutter gear 736 and thus the rear tube 748, reciprocating member<br>
768 and flexible, peel-apart external tissue lumen 778 are in their proximal most positions<br>
relative to the outer sleeve 766 and rectangular cover 738. The relative change causes the<br>
flexible, peel-apart external tissue lumen 778 to bow away from the outer sleeve 766. In<br>
FIG. 45, the lumen peel tab 784 has been pulled to separate the inwardly open channel<br>
780 from the elongate seal 782 to reveal and possibly access stored tissue samples (not<br>
shown).<br>
[00111]	In FIGS. 46-48, the sample holding portion 760 is depicted in greater detail. The<br>
distal locking half cylindrical portion 762 of the outer sleeve 766 includes upper lateral<br>
locking arms 790 that lock into the bottom half-cylinder locking flange 758 at the<br>
proximal end of the rectangular cover 738. In FIGS. 46, 47, aligned below these, lower<br>
lateral locking arms 792 of a distal interface portion 794 of the reciprocating member 768<br>
lock into the proximal locking flange 756 of the rear tube 748. The distal interface portion<br>
794 of the reciprocating member 768 includes an axially-extending bore 796 for<br>
connecting the external tissue lumen 778 of the sample holding portion 760 to the rear<br>
tube 748, maintaining generally coaxial alignment of the probe assembly 702, tissue<br>
sample lumen 728, rear tube 748, bore 796, and external tissue lumen 778 to provide an<br>
unobstructed passageway for the aspiration of tissue samples from the cutter tube 710.<br>
[00112]	In FIGS. 48, 50-51, the flexible rod 770 may be advanced distally within the<br>
external vacuum lumen 772 by the interaction between side ratchet teeth 798 and a pawl-<br>
type latching mechanism 800 on the reciprocating member 768, which is shown in greater<br>
 <br>
-24-<br>
detail n FIG. 49. Reciprocating member 768 may be supported on lower lateral latch<br>
arms 792 and reciprocate as cutter tube 710 is advanced and retracted. Reciprocating<br>
member 768 may have a bifurcated proximal end with proximally extending portions 802<br>
separated by an axially extending slot 804. A ramped surface 806 is formed between<br>
portions 802 at a distal end of slot 804. Ramped surface 806 may serve to deflect the<br>
distal end 774 of rod 770 through the opening 776 in the outer sleeve 766 as the rod 770<br>
is ratcheted out of external vacuum lumen 772. Unidirectional engagement pawls 808<br>
formed to inwardly extend from the proximally extending portions 802 into the axially<br>
extending slot 804 engage side ratchet teeth 798 on rod 770 as the rod 770 extends<br>
through the axially extending slot 804. The engagement between pawls 808 and side<br>
ratchet teeth 798 advances rod 770 distally through vacuum lumen 772.<br>
[00113] In FIG. 51, a plurality of small holes 810 may be formed in a center wall divider<br>
812 of the external vacuum tube 773 between external vacuum lumen 772 and tissue<br>
lumen 778. Small holes 810 enable vacuum from a source (not shown) connected to<br>
vacuum line 786 to communicate from external vacuum lumen 772 into external tissue<br>
lumen 778, to provide vacuum in tissue sample lumen 728 in cutter tube 710. Small holes<br>
810 may be spaced along the longitudinal axis of tube vacuum tube 773 and separated by<br>
a distance in the range of 0.1 to 4 centimeters. Holes 810 may be oriented at an angle<br>
relative to the longitudinal axis of vacuum tube 773. The angle in holes 810 may function<br>
as a mechanical diode, in that the edge of the holes 810 opening into the tissue lumen 778<br>
may aid in preventing motion of tissue samples 726 in a distal direction, while permitting<br>
tissue samples 726 to move proximally in tissue lumen 778 under vacuum force provided<br>
by the vacuum line 786. A tissue sample 726 may continue to slide proximally through<br>
the tissue lumen 778 until the sample 726 contacts either a proximal tissue stop 812<br>
attached to the lumen peel tab 784 or a preceding tissue sample 726.<br>
[00114] With further reference to FIG. 51, small holes 810 may be formed between<br>
lumens 772, 778 by boring top holes 813 into an upper surface 814 of external vacuum<br>
tube 773 with the sharpened tip of a drill or other appropriate instrument. The tip of the<br>
drill bit or other boring instrument may be directed to pass through vacuum lumen 772 to<br>
penetrate the center wall divider 812 that separates the two lumens 772, 778. The<br>
proximal half cylindrical portion 764 of the outer sleeve 766 may be securely attached to<br>
the upper surface 814 of the external vacuum tube 773 following the drilling of vacuum<br>
communication small holes 810 to seal top holes 813. For instance, outer sleeve 766 may<br>
 <br>
-25-<br>
Be attached to the external vacuum tube 773 by an adhesive or other appropriate type of<br>
attachment mechanism.<br>
[00115]	As tissue samples 726 are stored in tissue lumen 778, the stack of samples 726<br>
will grow in length distally in tissue lumen 778. The samples 726 will tend to block or<br>
otherwise restrict flow communication through small holes 810 as the stack of samples<br>
726 extends distally in tissue lumen 778. The translating flexible rod 770 is shown<br>
disposed at least partially in vacuum lumen 772. Rod 770 extends axially through vacuum<br>
lumen 772 to selectively cover or otherwise block at least some of the small holes 810.<br>
Rod 770 may be manipulated, such as by axial movement of rod 770, to selectively<br>
expose small holes 810 in the vacuum tube 773 in compensation for those holes 810<br>
blocked by stacked tissue samples 726. For instance, during each cutting cycle, rod 770<br>
may be advanced distally within vacuum lumen 772 to expose or otherwise unblock/open<br>
additional small holes 810 as additional samples 726 are stored in tissue lumen 778. The<br>
movement of rod 770 maintains a predetermined number of small holes 810 open to<br>
provide flow communication between vacuum and tissue lumens 772 and 778 as<br>
additional tissue samples 726 are added to the stack of tissue samples 726 in tissue lumen<br>
778, thereby facilitating a generally consistent vacuum force, depicted as arrow 816, in<br>
tissue sample lumen 728 in the probe assembly 704 (FIG. 39) throughout multiple cutting<br>
cycles.<br>
[00116]	Initially as depicted in FIG. 52, flexible rod 770 may be inserted within vacuum<br>
lumen 772 such that rod 770 is axially offset within vacuum lumen 772 so as to cover or<br>
otherwise block most, but not all, of the small holes 810. For instance, prior to storing any<br>
samples 726 in tissue lumen 778, rod 770 may be offset distally within vacuum lumen<br>
772 a distance that is slightly longer than the length of side aperture 708 (FIG. 40).<br>
Offsetting rod 770 distally within the vacuum lumen 772 ensures an initial set of small<br>
holes 810 are exposed to communicate axial vacuum force 730 to side aperture 708 when<br>
cutter tube 710 is in the fully proximal position prior to tissue sampling. The axial<br>
vacuum force 730 communicated through the exposed small holes 810 aids in prolapsing<br>
tissue into side aperture 708 prior to cutting, as well as pulling the tissue sample 726<br>
proximally into tissue lumen 778 after cutting. As a tissue sample 726 is drawn into and<br>
stacked within tissue lumen 778, the tissue sample 726 blocks the previously exposed<br>
small holes 810, preventing vacuum from passing into the tissue lumen 778. Rod 770 may<br>
be selectively moved a predetermined distance distally that is slightly longer than the<br>
 <br>
-26-<br>
length or side aperture 708 to expose additional small holes 810 immediately distal of the<br>
most recently acquired tissue sample 726. Rod 770 may be adapted to be automatically<br>
advanced distally by the translation of the cutter carriage 250. The newly exposed small<br>
holes 810 continue the communication of vacuum force 816 into tissue lumen 778 for the<br>
next cutting cycle. As reciprocating member 768 retracts proximally, unidirectional<br>
bottom ratchet teeth 818 located on the bottom side of flexible rod 770 engage the small<br>
holes 810 within vacuum lumen 772. The engagement between the bottom ratchet teeth<br>
818 and small holes 810 prevents rod 770 from moving proximally within vacuum lumen<br>
772. As pawls 808 move proximally relative to rod 770, the pawls 808 engage the next<br>
proximal set of side ratchet teeth 798 on rod 770. This engagement with the next set of<br>
side ratchet teeth 798 causes rod 770 to again advance distally when the reciprocating<br>
member 768 advances distally during the next cutting cycle to expose additional small<br>
holes 810. In the event that the cutter tube 710, and thus the reciprocating member 768, is<br>
advanced and retracted without the probe assembly 704 in tissue, the result is that the<br>
flexible rod 770 advances' too far distally relative to the tissue samples 726; the flexible<br>
rod 770 may be rotated a fraction of a turn about its longitudinal axis to disengage side<br>
ratchet teeth 798 and pawls 808 allowing the flexible rod 770 to be repositioned<br>
proximally within the vacuum lumen 772.<br>
