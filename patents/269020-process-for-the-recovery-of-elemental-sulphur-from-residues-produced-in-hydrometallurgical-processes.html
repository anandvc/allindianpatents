				<td>PROCESS  FOR  THE  RECOVERY  OF  ELEMENTAL  SULPHUR  FROM RESIDUES PRODUCED IN HYDROMETALLURGICAL PROCESSES<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the recovery of elemental sulphur from residues produced in hydrometallurgical processes.<br>
The present invention derives from the field of desulphurization processes of the residues of the metallurgical industry.<br>
Hydrometallurgical processes for the production of metals from concentrates based on sulphides lead to the production of elemental sulphur which is generally found in a mixture with gangue and other insoluble products.<br>
These residues can also contain precious metals, and also other metals of industrial interest, in significant quantities. Their recovery however requires the removal of elemental sulphur and its recovery in pure form.<br>
Various processes and methods for the recovery of sulphur from residual materials of hydrometallurgical processing are known, which avail of different types of recovery techniques such as flotation, filtration of molten sulphur, leaching with solvents miscible with water or with solvents immiscible with water, conversion to fertilizers and roasting.<br>
Flotation is among these processes of the known art. This technology is used in the concentration of sulphide-<br><br>
based minerals based on the addition of foaming additives which preferably suspend some of the sulphurized compounds bringing them to the foam phase followed by skimming and recovery. Although many attempts have been made for the flotation of sulphur from these residues, the results are disappointing mainly due to the high quantity of other elements contained in the concentrated sulphur phase. Although this process for the recovery of sulphur is not particularly effective, it is an inexpensive method.<br>
The process with filtration of molten sulphur is based on the principle that sulphur melts at a low temperature producing a hot dispersion which can be filtered. This process also obtains a rather low sulphur recovery even if the quality is discreet. Although this treatment is quite economical with respect to the operating costs, it requires, however, the use of sophisticated equipment.<br>
With respect to recovery processes which avail of the use of solvents miscible in water, the use of Carbitol (2(2-ethoxy-ethoxy)ethanol) has been evaluated, but this so far has not given encouraging results as the water, containing in the residue, diminishes the solubility of the sulphur requiring the use of an evaporation unit.<br>
The use of solvents immiscible in water for the recovery of  sulphur has  been indicated  in numerous scientific  publications.  In particular,  the  use  is described of perchloroethylene which exploits the great difference  in  solubility  of  sulphur  with  different temperatures (25 g/1 at 25°C - about 300 g/1 at 120°C) . This process, however, also has its disadvantages of use, mainly due to the formation of greasy deposits (to be treated and/or disposed of) at the interface between the water extracted from the residue and solvent, to the toxicity of the solvent (classified as a carcinogenic substance) and, in addition, to the formation of crusts of sulphur on the cold surfaces of the exchangers.<br>
As sulphur is soluble in sulphides, recovery techniques are also known which avail of the use of ammonium sulphide. The sulphur is leached as polysulphide and is then either transformed into ammonium sulphate or distilled in a vapour stream to give ammonium sulphide, which can then be recycled to the leaching, and sulphur which can be recovered in a substantially pure form. One of the main drawbacks of this technology lies in the fact that each unit must in any case by effectively sealed as on heating ammonium sulphide, which is an extremely unstable substance, there is an emission of ammonia and hydrogen sulphide.<br>
Another sulphur recovery technology consists in roasting in which sulphur is transformed into sulphur dioxide which can in turn be converted to sulphuric acid and/or gypsum using suitable equipment.<br>
The necessity is felt in the present state of the art for a process for the recovery of elemental sulphur from leaching residues of sulphide-based metallic concentrates or other materials which is substantially free of the drawbacks of the known art described above.<br>
One of the objectives of the present invention therefore consists in providing a process for the recovery of elemental sulphur from residues produced in hydrometallurgical processes which is simple to effect and which allows the recovery and recycling of the reagents used.<br>
Another objective of the present invention consists in providing a process which allows the recovery of elemental sulphur from residues produced in hydrometallurgical processes which is economically advantageous.<br>
These objectives are achieved by providing a process for the recovery of elemental sulphur from residues produced in hydrometallurgical processes as specified in the enclosed claim 1.<br>
Further  characteristics  and  embodiments  of  the<br>
invention are indicated in the  subsequent dependent claims...<br>
According .to a first aspect, the process for the recovery of elemental sulphur from residues produced in hydrometallurgical processes comprises:<br>
a)	leaching of a residue containing sulphur with a<br>
solution of sodium sulphide;<br>
b)	separation,  conveniently  by  filtration,  of  a<br>
residue from a solution of polysulphide;<br>
c)	treatment of said solution of polysulphide with<br>
CO2  to give  a dispersion containing elemental<br>
sulphur, polysulphide and sodium bicarbonate;<br>
d)	separation and recovery of the elemental sulphur<br>
contained  in  the  dispersion  from  a  solution<br>
containing polysulphide and sodium bicarbonate,<br>
and subsequently, optionally,<br>
e)	treatment of said solution of polysulphide and<br>
sodium bicarbonate with CaO;<br>
f)	separation,  conveniently  by  filtration,  of  a<br>
residue  of  CaCO3  from  a  solution  of  sodium<br>
sulphide which is  conveniently recirculated to<br>
phase a) of the process.<br>
According to another embodiment, the process also comprises a phase g)  for roasting the CaC03 residue, obtained in phase e) to produce:<br>
-	CaO (lime), which can be used/recycled as reagent in<br>
phase e) of the process<br>
-	CO2, which can be used/recycled as reagent in phase<br>
c) of the process.<br>
According to an embodiment, the leaching phase a) is carried out inside a reactor at a temperature within the range of 20 to 100°C and typically about 80°C, for a period of time ranging from 10 to 120 minutes and preferably for about 30 minutes. According to an embodiment, said leachiiig solution has a concentration of sodium sulphide ranging from 20 to 300 g/1, preferably equal to about 60 g/1. According to another embodiment, a residue which is substantially free of elemental sulphur is obtained in phase b) , by filtration, together with a solution of polysulphide wherein (1+x+y) varies from 1 to 9 and is preferably equal to 5 and wherein (1+x) varies from 1 to 4 and is preferably equal to 2.<br>
According to another embodiment of the process, phase d) for the treatment of the solution of polysulphide and bicarbonate with CaO is carried out inside a stirred reactor, at a temperature within the range of 20 to 100°C and preferably equal to about 70°C for a period of time ranging from 10 to 120 minutes and preferably equal to about 20 minutes.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of an embodiment<br>
of a process for the recovery of elemental sulphur from residues according to the present invention will appear more evident from the following illustrative and non-limiting description, referring to the enclosed schematic drawing.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a flow chart relating to an embodiment of the process of the invention which initially comprises the feeding of a reactor 1 with residues (x + y) S° (Residue) coming from the leaching of a lead concentrate.<br>
The leaching, phase a) takes place inside the reactor 1, which is preferably equipped with stirring means, with a solution of sodium sulphide in which the sulphur contained in the residues is selectively leached as sodium polysulphide (2) according to the following reaction:<br>
Na2S  +   (x  +  y)S° (Residue)   -* Na2S(1+x+y)<br>
The dispersion obtained from the leaching phase is subsequently subjected to filtration using a filter which allows a good washing of the panel 2 and which allows a solution to be separated from an almost sulphur-free residue which is removed, to be typically subjected to subsequent flotation or treatment to extract the precious metals possibly present therein.<br>
The solution recovered from the filtration phase b)<br>
of the process is transferred to a closed reactor 4 where it is then neutralized or treated according to phase c) of the process with carbon .dioxide according to the following reaction:<br>
Na2S(i+x+y) + C02 + H20 -&gt; NaHS(1+X) + NaHCO3 + yS°(S)<br>
The final dispersion obtained from this reaction is sent to a filter 5 where a sulphur residue (cake) is separated and removed (6) from a solution containing a mixture of bicarbonate and acid sodium polysulphide. This solution can regenerate a solution of sodium polysulphide. This regeneration is effected inside a reactor 7 by the addition of lime with the development of the following reaction:<br>
NaHS{1+x) + NaHCO3 + CaO -* CaC03 + Na2S(i+x) + H20<br>
The dispersion obtained is transferred to a filter 8 in which limestone (CaC03) is separated from the solution based on sodium polysulphide which is conveniently recycled to the leaching phase a) of the process.<br>
In particular,  for high-capacity plants,  it  is conveniently possible to recover lime (CaO) and carbon dioxide (C02) by typically roasting the limestone (CaC03) obtained inside a reactor or oven 9 according to the following reaction:<br>
CaC03 -» CaO + C02<br>
The lime recovered is conveniently subsequently sent to the reactor 7.<br>
The overall reaction, also recovering CaO (10) and CO2 (11), can be schematized as follows:<br>
S° (Residue) -&gt; S° (Pure solid)<br>
In this case, the sulphur is recovered as elemental sulphur with a minimum consumption of reagents and with a considerable advantage in economical terms.<br>
The process of the invention allows both the recovery and recycling of CaO and also the regeneration of a solution of sodium polysulphide which is conveniently recycled to the leaching section where the leaching reaction, from the second round onwards, becomes:<br>
Na2S(i+x)     +   yS° (Residue)    -»   Na2S(i+x+y)<br>
whereas reaction (1) is still valid for the make-up Na2S.<br>
The  following examples  are provided  for purely illustrative purposes of the present invention and should not be considered as limiting the protection scope, as defined by the enclosed claims. Example 1<br>
A residue produced from the leaching of a lead concentrate has a content of elemental sulphur of 52%. 100 g of this residue are introduced into a reactor containing"0:85 1 of a 60 g/1 solution of sodium sulphide<br>
 (Na2S) . After 1 h of leaching at 55°C, 46.85 g of dry residue washed residue are obtained, which contains 0.08 g of residual elemental sulphur and 1.0 1 of a solution of sodium polysulphide (Na2Sx wherein X is about 3.5) including the washing of the cake.<br>
The solution is introduced into a closed reactor where approximately 43 g of C02 are fed. The dispersion produced is filtered, the cake washed and dried recovering 30.96 g of pure sulphur. Part of the sulphur is still in the aqueous phase as polysulphide.<br>
The filtrate is treated with 55 g of lime (CaO) obtaining a dispersion which is filtered recovering 97.45 g of dry washed residue (CaC03) and 1.46 1 of a solution containing about 49.. 6 g/1 of sodium polysulphide (approximately Na2S2) to be recycled to the leaching. Example 2<br>
Another portion of residue coming from the leaching of a lead concentrate, already used in Example 1, is adopted for this test and the end-solution of Example 1 evaporated to 0.85 1, is used as leaching solution. -60 g of residue are introduced into a reactor into which the regenerated solution of polysulphide is fed.<br>
After 1 h of leaching at 55 °C, 28.11 g of dry residue washed residue are obtained, which contains 0.06 g of residual elemental sulphur and 0.96 1 of a solution<br>
of sodium polysulphide (Na2Sx wherein X is about 3.5) including the washing of the cake.<br>
The solution is introduced into a closed reactor where approximately 43 g of C02 are fed. The dispersion produced is filtered, the cake washed and dried recovering 31.39 g.of pure sulphur.<br>
The filtrate is treated with 55 g of lime (CaO) obtaining a dispersion which is filtered recovering 97.22 g of dry washed residue (CaC03) and 1.38 1 of a solution containing  about  55.2  g/1  of  sodium  polysulphide (approximately Na2S2) to be recycled to the leaching.<br><br><br><br>
