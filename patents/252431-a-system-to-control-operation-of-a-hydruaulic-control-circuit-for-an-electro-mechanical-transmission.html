METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL OPERATION OF A HYDRAULIC<br>
CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control systems for electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions, and more specifically to control of a hydraulic<br>
circuit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to a vehicle driveline. One such<br>
transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, typically an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to the<br>
vehicle driveline. Electrical machines, operatively connected to an electrical<br>
energy storage device, comprise motor/generators operable to generate motive<br>
torque for input to the transmission, independently of torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electrical machines are further operable to<br>
transform vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to<br>
electrical energy potential that is storable in the electrical energy storage<br>
device. A control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the<br>
operator and provides operational control of the powertrain system, including<br>
controlling transmission gear shifting, controlling the torque-generative<br>
devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange between the electrical<br>
energy storage device and the electrical machines.<br>
[0003] The exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively<br>
operative in fixed gear modes and continuously variable modes through<br>
actuation of the torque-transfer clutches, typically employing a hydraulic<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
circuit to effect clutch actuation. A fixed gear mode occurs when rotational<br>
speed of the transmission output member is a fixed ratio of rotational speed of<br>
the input member from the engine, typically due to actuation of one or more<br>
torque-transfer clutches. A continuously variable mode occurs when<br>
rotational speed of the transmission output member is variable based upon<br>
operating speeds of one or more electrical machines. The electrical machines<br>
can be connected to the output shaft via actuation of a clutch, or by direct<br>
connection. Clutch actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a<br>
hydraulic circuit.<br>
[0004] Engineers implementing powertrain systems having electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions with hydraulically-actuated clutches are tasked with<br>
implementing transmission control schemes to effectively actuate torque-<br>
transfer clutches while providing fault detection and limp-home capability.<br>
Such a system is described hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In order to address the concerns raised hereinabove and in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the invention, a control system for electro-mechanical<br>
transmission is provided that is selectively operative in a plurality of fixed<br>
gear modes and continuously variable modes comprising first and second<br>
electrical machines and four hydraulically-actuated clutches in fluid<br>
communication with a hydraulic circuit comprising first, second and third<br>
pressure control devices and first and second flow management valves. The<br>
control system is operative to selectively actuate the pressure control devices<br>
and the flow management valves based upon a demand for torque, presence of<br>
a fault, and temperatures of the electric machines.<br>
[0006] An aspect of the invention includes a transmission, comprising: an<br>
electro-mechanical device operative to transmit torque. The transmission<br>
comprises first and second electrical machines, a plurality of planetary gears<br>
and four hydraulically actuated torque-transfer devices selectively actuatable<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
3<br>
using a hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic circuit comprises first, second and<br>
third pressure control devices and first and second flow management valves<br>
and pressure monitoring devices. There is included a control system adapted<br>
to monitor the pressure monitoring devices to identify presence of a fault and<br>
adapted to determine a demand for torque and temperatures of the electrical<br>
machines. The control system is adapted to execute a computer program to<br>
selectively actuate the four torque-transfer devices by selectively actuating the<br>
plurality of pressure control devices and flow management valves based upon<br>
the demand for torque, the presence of a fault, and the temperatures of the<br>
electrical machines.<br>
[0007] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0015] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0016] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode,<br>
Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed<br>
Ratios", which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The transmission 10 has an input shaft 12 that is<br>
preferably directly driven by an internal combustion engine 14. The<br>
transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28, and four<br>
torque-transmitting devices, i.e. clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. An<br>
electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by transmission<br>
control module 17, is operative to control actuation and deactivation of the<br>
clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise hydraulically-actuated<br>
rotating friction clutches. Clutches Cl and C3 preferably comprise<br>
comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices grounded to the<br>
transmission case 68.<br>
[0017] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined to an outer gear member of the second planetary gear<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
set 26, and connected to a first electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 56, also referred to as "MG-A".<br>
[0018] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60, to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through clutch C2 62. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output member<br>
64. An inner gear member of the second planetary gear set 26 is connected to<br>
an inner gear member of the third planetary gear set 28 through a sleeve shaft<br>
66 that circumscribes shaft 60, and is connected to a second electrical machine<br>
comprising a motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B.<br>
[0019] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as MG-A and MG-B<br>
56 and 72 are coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft 60. MG-<br>
A and MG-B 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which permits<br>
them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such that the<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the MG-A<br>
and MG-B 56 and 72. Transmission output member 64 is operably connected<br>
to a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive torque. Each clutch is preferably<br>
hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump,<br>
described below, via an electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to Fig. 3.<br>
[0020] The transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 typically comprises<br>
one or more batteries. Other electrical energy and electrochemical energy<br>
storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and dispense<br>
electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering the<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is preferably sized based<br>
upon factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related<br>
to typical road grade and temperature, and propulsion requirements such as<br>
emissions, power assist and electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the control system described<br>
hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19 transmits electrical energy<br>
to and from MG-A 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly<br>
transmits electrical energy to and from MG-B 72 by transfer conductors 31.<br>
Electrical current is transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with<br>
whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the<br>
pair of power inverters and respective motor control modules configured to<br>
receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom for<br>
providing motor drive or regeneration functionality.<br>
[0021] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from<br>
the DC transmission lines and provides AC current to the respective<br>
electrical machine, i.e. MG-A and MG-B, over transfer conductors 29 and<br>
31. In regeneration control, the respective inverter receives AC current from<br>
the electrical machine over transfer conductors 29 and 31 and transmits<br>
current to the DC lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the<br>
inverters determines the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical<br>
energy storage device 74. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-<br>
phase AC machines each having a rotor operable to rotate within a stator that<br>
is mounted on a case of the transmission. The inverters comprise known<br>
complementary three-phase power electronics devices.<br>
[0022] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23,<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface<br>
('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain including the<br>
transmission 10 through a request for a torque output. Exemplary vehicle<br>
operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal,<br>
transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the<br>
aforementioned control modules communicates with other control modules,<br>
sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6<br>
allows for structured communication of control parameters and commands<br>
between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol<br>
utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols<br>
provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between<br>
the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
[0023] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an operator torque request, an engine torque command,<br>
clutch torque commands for the various clutches Cl, C2, C3, C4 of the<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands for MG-A and MG-B. The<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
TCM is operatively connected to the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 of<br>
Fig. 3, including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and<br>
generating and executing control signals for various solenoids to control<br>
pressure switches and control valves contained therein.<br>
[0024] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine torque input to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed, N1, to shaft 12 leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0025] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches Cl, C2, C3, and, C4 and<br>
rotational speed, No, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and sensors may<br>
be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the HCP for<br>
control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure switches and<br>
selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids to actuate<br>
various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes, as described<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
[0026] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0027] The TPIM 19 includes previously referenced power inverters and<br>
motor control modules configured to receive motor control commands and<br>
control inverter states therefrom to provide motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable to generate torque commands for<br>
MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, based upon input from the HCP 5, which is driven<br>
by operator input through UI 13 and system operating parameters. The<br>
motor torque commands for MG-A and MG-B are implemented by the<br>
control system, including the TPIM 19, to control MG-A and MG-B.<br>
Individual motor speed signals for MG-A and MG-B are derived by the<br>
TPIM 19 from the motor phase information or conventional rotation sensors.<br>
The TPIM 19 determines and communicates motor speeds to the HCP 5.<br>
The electrical energy storage device 74 is high-voltage DC-coupled to the<br>
TPIM 19 via DC lines 27. Electrical current is transferable to or from the<br>
TPIM 19 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged.<br>
[0028] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
[0029] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0030] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine requested output torque at shaft 64, also referred to as the<br>
operator torque request. Selectively operated components of the transmission<br>
10 are appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the operator<br>
demand. For example, in the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and 2,<br>
when the operator has selected a forward drive range and manipulates either<br>
the accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5 determines an output<br>
torque which affects how and when the vehicle accelerates or decelerates.<br>
Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g., road<br>
load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states<br>
of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission<br>
required to arrive at the desired torque output. Under the direction of the HCP<br>
5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of output speeds from slow to fast<br>
in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0031] The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission operates in several fixed gear operating modes and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Fig. 1, and Table 1,<br>
below.<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>

Table 1<br><br>
Transmission Operating Mode	Actuated	Clutches<br>
Mode I	Cl 70	<br>

Mode II	C2 62	<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR3)	C2 62	C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR4)	C2 62	C3 73<br>
[0032] The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches Cl, C2, C3, and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each operating mode. Additionally, in various transmission<br>
operating modes, MG-A and MG-B may each operate as electrical motors to<br>
generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate electrical energy. A first<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when clutch Cl 70 is actuated in order to<br>
"ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set 28. A second<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when clutch C1 70 is released and clutch C2 62<br>
is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28. Other factors outside the scope of the invention affect<br>
when the electrical machines 56, 72 operate as motors and generators, and are<br>
not discussed herein.<br>
[0033] The control system, shown primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to provide<br>
a range of transmission output speeds at shaft 64 from relatively slow to<br>
relatively fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two modes<br>
with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the transmission<br>
10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds, and meet<br>
various other requirements as previously described. Additionally, the control<br>
system coordinates operation of the transmission 10 so as to allow<br>
synchronized shifts between the modes.<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
[0034] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch<br>
Cl 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
fixed ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
[0035] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio operation of input-<br>
to-output speed of the transmission, i.e. N,/No, is achieved. The rotations of<br>
machines MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B function as motors or<br>
generators. They are completely independent of engine to output power flow,<br>
thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any<br>
combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio<br>
1 that motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided by<br>
power from the engine and power from MG-A and MG-B, through planetary<br>
gear set 28 by accepting power from ESD 74.<br>
[0036] Referring to Fig. 3, a schematic diagram is shown which provides a<br>
more detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic system for<br>
controlling flow of hydraulic fluid in the exemplary transmission, including<br>
operation of main hydraulic pump 88 and an auxiliary hydraulic pump 110.<br>
As previously described with reference to Fig. 1, the main hydraulic pump 88<br>
is driven off the input shaft from the engine 10. The main hydraulic pump 88<br>
receives input torque from the engine and pumps hydraulic fluid drawn from a<br>
sump into hydraulic circuit 42 of the transmission, initially passing through<br>
control valve 140. Auxiliary pump 110 is operatively electrically controlled<br>
by the TPIM 19. The auxiliary pump 110 preferably comprises an<br>
electrically-powered pump of an appropriate size and capacity to provide<br>
sufficient flow of pressurized hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic system when<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>

operational. Pressurized hydraulic fluid flows into electro-hydraulic control<br>
circuit 42, which is operable to selectively distribute hydraulic pressure to a<br>
series of devices, including the torque-transfer clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
and C4 75, cooling circuits for machines A and B, and a circuit for cooling<br>
and lubricating the transmission 10 (not shown). As previously stated, the<br>
TCM 17 is preferably operable to actuate the various clutches to achieve<br>
various transmission operating modes through selective actuation of pressure<br>
control solenoids PCS_1 108, PCS2 112, PCS_3 114, PCS_4 116 and<br>
solenoid-controlled flow management valves X-valve 118 and Y-valve 120.<br>
The circuit is fluidly connected to pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, and<br>
PS4 via passages 122, 124, 126, and 128, respectively. The pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS1 108 has control positions of neutral and high and is operative<br>
to provide modulation of fluidic pressure and flow in the hydraulic circuit<br>
through fluidic interaction with valve 107. Pressure control solenoid PCS2<br>
112 has control positions of neutral and low, and is fluidly connected to spool<br>
valve 113 and operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool<br>
valve 113 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS_3 via passage 126.<br>
Pressure control solenoid PCS_3 114 has control positions of neutral and high,<br>
and is fluidly connected to spool valve 115 and operative to effect flow<br>
therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 115 is fluidly connected to pressure<br>
switch PS_2 via passage 124. Pressure control solenoid PCS4 116 has<br>
control positions of neutral and low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve<br>
117 and operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 117<br>
is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS_4 via passage 128.<br>
[0037] The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 each comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by solenoids 118, 120, respectively, in the exemplary<br>
system, and have control states of High (T) and Low ('0'). The control states<br>
reference positions of each valve effecting flow control to different elements<br>
in the hydraulic circuit 42 and the transmission 10. The X-valve 119 is<br>
operable to direct pressurized fluid to clutches C3 and C4 and cooling systems<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
for stators of MG-A and MG-B via fluidic passages 136, 138, 140, 142<br>
respectively, depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described<br>
hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is operable to direct pressurized fluid to clutches<br>
Cl and C2 via fluidic passages 132 and 134 respectively, depending upon the<br>
source of the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter. A more detailed<br>
description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is provided in<br>

[0039] Selective control of the X and Y valves and actuation of the solenoids<br>

[0040] In operation, an operating mode, i.e. one of the fixed gear and<br>
continuously variable mode operations, is determined for the exemplary<br>
transmission based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the<br>
powertrain. This includes demand for an operator demand for torque,<br>
typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously described.<br>
Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated on external conditions,<br>
including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or wind load. The<br>
operating mode may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand caused by a<br>
control module command to operate of the electrical machines in an electrical<br>
energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The operating mode<br>
can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine operable to<br>
determine optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for power,<br>
battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A<br>
and MG-B 56, 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the engine<br>
14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system optimization occurs to optimize system<br>
efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage battery charging.<br>
Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a component<br>
or system.<br>
[0041] Referring now to Fig. 4, various transmission operating modes are<br>
plotted as a function of transmission output speed, No, and transmission input<br>
speed, N1 for the exemplary transmission and control system shown in Fig. 1<br>
and 2. The Fixed Ratio operation is shown as individual lines for each of the<br>
specific gear ratios, GR1, GR2, GR3, and GR4, as described with reference to<br>
Table 1, above. The continuously variable Mode operation is shown as ranges<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
16<br>
of operation for each of Mode I and Mode II. The transmission operating<br>
mode is switched between Fixed Ratio operation and continuously variable<br>
Mode operation by activating or deactivating specific clutches. The control<br>
system is operative to determine a specific transmission operating mode based<br>
upon various criteria, using algorithms and calibrations executed by the<br>
control system, and is outside the scope of this invention. Selection of the<br>
mode of operation of the transmission depends primarily on operator input and<br>
the ability of the powertrain to meet that input.<br>
[0042] Referring to Tables 1 and 2 and again to Fig. 4, the low range<br>
operating state includes selective actuation of clutches C2, Cl, and C4,<br>
facilitating operation in any one of continuously variable Mode I, and fixed<br>
gears GR1, GR2, and GR3. The high range operating state includes selective<br>
actuation of clutches C2, C3, and C4, facilitating operation in any one of<br>
continuously variable Mode II and fixed gears GR3 and GR4. It should be<br>
recognized that ranges of continuously variable operation for Mode I and<br>
Mode II may overlap.<br>
[0043] In operation, a shift occurs in the exemplary transmission due to a<br>
variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. There may be a change<br>
in demand for an operator demand for torque. Such, demands are typically<br>
communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously described.<br>
Additionally, a change in demand for output torque may be predicated on a<br>
change in external conditions, including, e.g., changes in road grade, road<br>
surface conditions, or wind load. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in powertrain torque demand caused by a control module command to<br>
change one of the electrical machines between electrical energy generating<br>
mode and torque generating mode. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in an optimization algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum<br>
system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery state of<br>
charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72.<br>
The control system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A and<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
17<br>
MG-B 56, 72 based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine,<br>
and there can be changes in system optimization that compel a shift change in<br>
order to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage<br>
battery charging. Furthermore, a shift change may be predicated upon a fault<br>
in a component or system. The distributed control module architecture acts in<br>
concert to determine a need for a change in the transmission operating mode,<br>
and executes the forgoing to effect the change in transmission operation. A<br>
shift change in the exemplary system comprises one of at least three possible<br>
situations. There can be a shift from one fixed gear to a second fixed gear.<br>
There can be a shift from a fixed gear to one of the continuously variable<br>
modes. There can be a shift from one of the continuously variable modes to a<br>
fixed gear.<br>
[0044] Referring now to the transmission described with reference to Figs. 1,<br>
2, 3, and 4, and Tables 1 and 2, specific aspects of the transmission and<br>
control system are described herein. The control system selectively actuates<br>
the pressure control devices and the flow management valves based upon a<br>
demand for torque, presence of a fault, and temperatures of the electric<br>
motors. The control system selectively commands one of the low-range<br>
continuously variable operation, the high-range continuously variable<br>
operation, the low range state, and the high range state based upon selective<br>
actuation of the X-valve 118 and Y-valve 120 flow management valves. The<br>
control system effects actuation of the stator cooling system for MGA<br>
(MGA Stator Cool), the stator cooling system for the second electrical<br>
machine (MG_B Stator Cool), and the first hydraulically-actuated clutch (Cl)<br>
based upon selective actuation of the pressure control devices PCS_2, PCS_3,<br>
and PCS4 when the low-range continuously variable operation has been<br>
commanded. Furthermore, the control system is operative to effect actuation<br>
of the stator cooling system for MG-A, stator cooling system for MG-B, and<br>
the second hydraulically-actuated clutch (C2) based upon selective actuation<br>
of the pressure control devices when the high-range continuously variable<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
18<br>
operation has been commanded. The control system is operative to effect<br>
actuation of the first, second, and fourth hydraulically-actuated clutches (C1,<br>
C2, C4) based upon selective actuation of the pressure control devices when<br>
the low-range state has been commanded, comprising operation in one of the<br>
first, second, and third fixed gear ratios via selective actuation of the clutches.<br>
The control system is operative to effect actuation of the second, third, and<br>
fourth hydraulically-actuated clutches (C2, C3, C4) based upon selective<br>
actuation of the pressure control devices when the high-range state has been<br>
commanded, comprising operation in one of the third and fourth fixed gear<br>
ratios via selective actuation of the clutches.<br>
[0045] As previously stated, fluid output from each of the second, third and<br>
fourth pressure control devices (PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4) is selectively<br>
mapped to one of the four hydraulically-actuated clutches and stator cooling<br>
systems for MGA and MGB based upon commanded positions of the first<br>
and second flow management valves. Therefore, selective actuation of PCS2<br>
effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-B, when<br>
both the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to Low. Selective actuation<br>
of PCS_2 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C2 when either of<br>
the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to High. Selective actuation of<br>
PCS_3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch Cl when both the X-<br>
valve and the Y-valve are commanded to Low. Selective actuation of PCS_3<br>
effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-B when<br>
the X-valve is commanded to Low and the Y-valve is commanded to High.<br>
Selective actuation of PCS_3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch<br>
C1 when the X-valve is commanded to High and the Y-valve is commanded to<br>
Low. Selective actuation of PCS_3 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate<br>
clutch C3 when both the X-valve and the Y-valve are commanded to High.<br>
Selective actuation of PCS_4 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling<br>
to the stator of MG-A when the X-valve is commanded to Low, regardless of<br>
the position to which the Y-valve is commanded.    Selective actuation of<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
19<br>
PCS_4 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C4 when the X-valve is<br>
commanded to High, regardless of the position to which the Y-valve is<br>
commanded.<br>
[0046] Referring now to the flowchart shown in Fig. 5, with reference to the<br>
exemplary transmission described with reference to Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, and<br>
Tables 1 and 2, specific aspects of controlling operation of the exemplary<br>
transmission and control system are described, comprising a control scheme<br>
for selectively commanding one of the low-range continuously variable<br>
operation, the high-range continuously variable operation, the low range state,<br>
and the high range state based upon selective actuation of the flow<br>
management valves, i.e. the X-valve and the Y-valve. A desired operating<br>
state, i.e. fixed gear or continuously variable mode operation, is determined<br>
for the exemplary transmission based upon the operating characteristics of the<br>
powertrain. When the desired gear is neutral (Block 200), and EVT Mode 1 is<br>
tracking (Block 202), then continuously variable Mode I is commanded<br>
(Block 226), resulting in both X-valve and Y-valve commanded to Low.<br>
When the desired gear is not neutral, the control scheme determines what the<br>
desired operating state comprises, i.e. Mode I, Mode II, GR1, GR2, or GR3.<br>
When the desired gear is Mode I (Block 206), the control scheme determines<br>
when active stator cooling has been commanded (Block 208). When stator<br>
cooling has been commanded, then continuously variable Mode I is<br>
commanded (Block 226). When stator cooling has not been commanded, then<br>
the Low Range is commanded (Block 228), resulting in X-valve commanded<br>
to High and Y-valve commanded to Low. When the desired gear is either of<br>
GR1 and GR2 (Block 210), it is determined whether diagnostic testing is<br>
occurring (Block 216). When diagnostic testing is occurring, then<br>
continuously variable Mode I is commanded (Block 226). When diagnostic<br>
testing is not occurring, then the Low Range is commanded (Block 228).<br>
When the desired operating state is Mode II (Block 212), it is determined<br>
whether  stator  cooling  has  been  commanded  (Block  218),  resulting  in<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
20<br>
continuously variable Mode II being commanded (Block 230), resulting in X-<br>
valve commanded to Low and Y-valve commanded to High. When stator<br>
cooling has not been commanded, it is determined whether system operating<br>
conditions favor operating in the high range (Block 222), and the controlled<br>
output is commanded the High Range (Block 232) or to the Low Range<br>
(Block 228) accordingly. When the High Range is commanded (Block 232),<br>
the X-valve commanded to High and Y-valve commanded to High. When the<br>
desired operating state is GR3, then it is determined whether diagnostic testing<br>
is occurring (Block 220). When diagnostic testing is occurring, then<br>
continuously variable Mode II is commanded (Block 230). When diagnostic<br>
testing is not occurring, then it is determined whether system operating<br>
conditions favor operating in the high range (Block 222), and the controlled<br>
output is commanded the High Range (Block 232) or to the Low Range<br>
(Block 228) accordingly.<br>
[0047] The diagnostic testing referenced hereinabove preferably includes<br>
active fault testing wherein one or more of the pressure control solenoid<br>
devices is selectively actuated during ongoing operation to determine whether<br>
it is functioning properly.<br>
[0048] Referring now to the flowchart in Fig. 6 and the graph in Fig. 7,<br>
determining whether system operating conditions favor operating in the high<br>
range (Block 222) is described in greater detail. It is first determined whether<br>
GR-4 is available (Block 250), based upon N1 and No, as shown graphically in<br>
Fig. 7, the values of which are precalibrated and storage in ROM in the control<br>
system. When GR4 is not available, the Low Range is commanded (Block<br>
228). When GR4 is available, then it is determined whether a predicted time-<br>
rate change in input speed, N1_profile is greater than N0_GR3 plus a hysteresis<br>
threshold, preferably of about 100 engine rpm (Block 252), again resulting in<br>
the Low Range being commanded (Block 228). It is then determined whether<br>
time-rate change in input speed, N1_profile is less than N0_GR3 minus a<br>
hysteresis threshold, preferably of about 100 engine rpm (Block 254).  When<br><br>
GP-308398-PTH-CD<br>
21<br>
the time-rate change in input speed, N1_profile is less than N0_GR3 minus the<br>
hysteresis threshold, then operation in the High Range is commanded (Block<br>
232). When the time-rate change in input speed, Njrofile greater less than<br>
N0_GR3 minus the hysteresis threshold, then the current command for the X<br>
and Y valves is maintained (Block 234).<br>
[0049] The control system is operative to determine presence of a fault based<br>
upon a selective transition of the first flow management valve between a<br>
commanded-on state and a commanded-off state. The control system is<br>
operative to monitor signal outputs from pressure monitoring devices PS1,<br>
PS2, PS3 and PS4. Therefore, the control system is operative to selectively<br>
command either one of the low-range continuously variable operation and the<br>
high-range continuously variable operation based upon selective actuation of<br>
the flow management valves when presence of a fault has been determined.<br>
[0050] It is understood that modifications in the transmission hardware are<br>
allowable within the scope of the invention. The invention has been described<br>
with specific reference to the preferred embodiments and modifications<br>
thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon<br>
reading and understanding the specification. It is intended to include all such<br>
modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the<br>
