FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present Invention relates to a method for dismantling and reassembly of high capacity 'Crawler Cranes with Lattice Boom'. More particularly the present invention relates to a method for dismantling and reassembly of high capacity 'Crawler Cranes With Lattice Booms' without the use of additional crane, including loading and unloading from transport vehicles adaptable to handle wind electric generators at Wind Farms being set up in remote areas and in other areas where availability of cranes is scarce and costlier.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wind turbines are used to convert wind energy into electrical energy. Wind turbine consists of a generator, a gearbox, a bearing housing, a hub and a plurality of blades places in a nacelle. Wind turbine boles convert the wind energy into mechanical energy resulting in slow rotation of rotors with high torque. The generator coupled to the gearbox produces electrical power. For high capacity wind turbines, the tower height is more than 40m and quite commonly above 50 m. On top of the tower, the wind turbine nacelle is fixed. The nacelle weighs about 14MT for 250KW. All high capacity wind turbine nacelles weigh more than this and whenever the nacelle is to be brought down for repair, a high capacity crane having boom length<br><br>
-3-<br>
sufficient to reach the nacelle and lift the naceiie safely is required. Wind farms are generally located in remote places and arrangement of crane to work in these areas is a costlier affair. Crawler crane with Lattice Booms are relatively cheaper but require an additional crane of sufficient capacity (about 50 Ton capacity additional crane is required for 100 Ton crawler crane) to reassemble and dismantle the cranes transported by vehicles. This increases the total cost and more time is taken for arrangement of two cranes at a time. Further there is loss of wind power generation as repair activity is delayed if two cranes are to be arranged at a time. An innovative solution to assemble and reassemble the 'Crawler Cranes with Lattice Booms at wind farms without an additional crane brings down the cost and reduces the total time taken for repair.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an abject of the present invention to propose a method for dismantling and reassembly of high capacity 'Crawler Cranes With Lattice Booms' without the use of additional crane, including loading and unloading from transport vehicles, adoptable to handle wind electric generators at Wind Farms and other places, which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another objection of the present invention is to propose a method for dismantling and reassembly of high capacity 'Crawler Cranes<br><br>
-4-<br>
With Lattice Booms' without the use of additional crane, including loading and unloading from transport vehicles, adaptable to handle wind electric generators at wind farms, which is economic, simple and easy to maintain.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a method for dismantling and reassembly of high capacity 'Crawler Cranes With Lattice Booms' without the use of additional crane, including loading and unloading from transport vehicles, adaptable to handle wind electric generators at wind farms, which minimizes the brake down time of wind farm.<br>
A still further object of the present Invention is to propose a method for dismantling and reassembly of high capacity 'Crawler Cranes With Lattice Booms' without the use of additional crane, including loading and unloading from transport vehicles, adaptable to handle wind electric generators at wind farms, which can be utilized in remote area.<br>
As yet further object of the present invention is to propose a method for dismantling and reassembly of high capacity 'Crawler Cranes With Lattice Booms' without the use of additional crane, including loading and unloading from transport vehicles, adaptable to handle wind electric generators at wind farms, which is easy to handle.<br><br>
-5-<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a method for dismantling and reassembly of high capacity 'Crawler Cranes With Lattice Booms' without the use of additional crane, including loading and unloading from transport vehicles adaptable to handle wind electric generators at wind farms. The method of unloading or reloading of all major crane parts requiring additional crane is same as described in Fig 1,2,3,4. A part of crawler crane received on a vehicle is shown in Fig. 1. Using jacks, the crane part is lifted up and inserting supports and some cross members the crane part is physically separated from the vehicle bed Fig 2 &amp; 3. Once the crane part is physically separated then the vehicle is moved away and the crane part is ready for further assembly with other parts removed from vehicles in similar way. Referring to Fig. 5, a boom, a crane car body, a Crawler-Left &amp; Crawler-Right, a counter weights and a Frame with ropes removed from vehicles in similar way, are aligned using tripods and chain pulley blocks to integrate with the main car body as shown in Fig 06 and the crane is now ready for use. Dismantling of the crane parts is done in reverse sequence of assembly following the same method and loaded on the vehicles for transport purpose.<br>

As shown in Figure - 5, the major parts of the cranes are identified as crane boom - 01, crane car body - 02, crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04 dead weights -05, frame with wire ropes- 06. These parts are transported in vehicles (11) in disassembled condition and arrival of a typical part is shown in Fig 1. Referring to Fig 2 &amp; 3, the crane part 02 is lifted up to insert two support beams 09 in between crane part 02 and vehicle bed 07, using plurality of jacks 08 as shown in Fig. 2. The jacks are then removed and the crane part 02 rests now on support beams 09 which extend sufficiently beyond the vehicle bed (07). Remove jacks 08 and place sufficient supports with plurality of jacks 10, below support beams 09 to lift and support the crane part 02. Using arrangement 10, lift crane part 02 sufficiently such that crane part 02<br><br>
-7-<br>
does not rest on vehicle bed 07. Now the vehicle (11) is completely freed from the vehicle bed (07) and the vehicle (11) is moved away, Now the crane part 02 rest on support beams 09 and arrangement 10. Employing this method unload all the parts of the crawler crane as shown Fig. 6. The sequence of unloading is important as this minimizes the reassembly cycle time and facilities quick and easy reassembly of crawler crane parts. As shown in Figure - 5 &amp; 6, the major parts of the cranes are identified as crane boom - 01, crane car body -02, crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04, dead weights - 05, frame with wire ropes - 06 are aligned in a straight line. Lower the crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04 to ground level so that they can be moved as and when required. Referring to Fig. - 06, a chain pulley block is fixed in between the dead weights 05 and crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04. The crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04 together pulled towards car body 02 using chain puiley blocks. After the crawler Assembly - 03 &amp;<br>
4	and car body 02 are brought together and aligned they are<br>
assembled. Now the crane is mobile as a unit without boom 01 (Fig.<br>
5	&amp; 06), frame with wire ropes 06 and deadweight 05. Using<br>
portable 'A' Frame with chain pulley block or tripod with chain pulley<br>
block these parts assembled on to the crane. As the crane is now<br>
mobile, maneuverability is increased and assembly is now easy and<br>
quick. Assemble all the booms' parts (Fig. 05 &amp; 06, item 01) and<br>
position  them  at suitable  height  for  assembling  with  the Car<br>
body (Fig. 05 &amp; 06, item 02). Complete the assembly of booms and<br>
dead weights and frame with wire ropes (Fig, 05 &amp; 06, item 06), Now<br>
the crane is ready for use.<br><br>
-8-<br>
DISASSEMBLY OF CRAWLER CRANE<br>
Disassembly Is done In the reverse sequence of reassembly described above. First position the crane such that all the dismantled parts can be lined up for loading on vehicles without any problem. Referring to Fig. 5, Lower the boom 01 and position them with supports at height suitable for handling by portable 'A' Frame with chain pulley bock or tripod with chain pulley block for loading on vehicle. Remove ail the connecting fasteners and boom is now detached from crane and physically stands on supports. Dismantle the sections of booms further to accommodate on available vehicles. Using portable *Af Frame with chain pulley block or tripod with chain pulley block load the boom parts on vehicle and transport them. Employing this same method unloads the frame with wire ropes 06 and deadweights 05 and keep them on floor. Remove all connecting fasteners between crane car body - 02, crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04. Lift the crane car body - 02 up using plurality of jacks and supports as shown in Fig. 03. Pull the crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04 away from crane car body -02 using, a chain pulley block fixed in between the dead weight 05 and crawler Assembly 03 &amp; 04. The crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04 should be physically away from crane car body - 02. Lift the crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04 up using plurality of jacks and supports as shown in Fig. 03. Drive a transport vehicle carefully under the support beams and lower the crawler Assembly - 03 &amp; 04 on the bed of the vehicle using jacks.
