				<td>METHOD OF MONITORING MEMBRANE SEPARATION PROCESSES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to membrane separation and, more particularly,<br>
to methods for monitoring and/or controlling membrane separation processes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Membrane separation, which uses a selective membrane, is a fairly recent<br>
addition to the industrial separation technology for processing of liquid streams, such as<br>
water purification. In membrane separation, constituents of the influent typically pass<br>
through the membrane as a result of a driving force(s) in one effluent stream, thus<br>
leaving behind some portion of the original constituents in a second stream. Membrane<br>
separations commonly used for water purification or other liquid processing include<br>
microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO),<br>
electrodialysis, electrodeionization, pervaporation, membrane extraction, membrane<br>
distillation, membrane stripping, membrane aeration, and other processes. The driving<br>
force of the separation depends on the type of the membrane separation. Pressure-<br>
driven membrane filtration, also known as membrane filtration, includes<br>
microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, and uses pressure as a<br>
driving force, whereas the electrical driving force is used in electrodialysis and<br>
electrodcionization. Historically, membrane separation processes or systems were not<br>
considered cost effective for water treatment due to the adverse impacts that membrane<br>
scaling, membrane fouling, membrane degradation and the like had on the efficiency of<br>
removing solutes from aqueous water streams. However, advancements in technology<br>
have now made membrane separation a more commercially viable technology for<br>
treating aqueous feed streams suitable for use in industrial processes.<br>
Further, membrane separation processes have also been made more practical for<br>
industrial use, particularly for raw and wastewater purification. This has been achieved<br>
through the use of improved diagnostic tools or techniques for evaluating membrane<br>
separation performance. The performance of membrane separation, such as efficiency<br>
(e.g. flux or membrane permeability) and effectiveness (e.g. rejection or selectivity),<br>
are typically affected by various parameters concerning the operating conditions of the<br>
process. Therefore, it is desirable to monitor these and other types of process<br>
parameters specific to membrane separation to assess the performance of the process<br>
and/or the operating conditions. In this regard, a variety of different diagnostic<br>
techniques for monitoring membrane separation processes have been routinely used and<br>
are now understood and accepted as essential to its practicality and viability for<br>
industrial use.<br>
However, monitoring is typically conducted on an intermittent basis, for<br>
example, once a work shift or at times less frequently. Known employed monitoring<br>
techniques can also be labor and time intensive. Thus, adjustments made to membrane<br>
separation processes in order to enhance performance based on typical monitoring may<br>
not be made in an expeditious manner. In addition, the presently available monitoring<br>
techniques often do not provide optimal sensitivity and selectivity with respect to<br>
monitoring a variety of process parameters that are generally relied on as indicators to<br>
evaluate and/or control membrane separation processes.<br>
For example, monitoring techniques typically applied to reverse osmosis and<br>
nanofiltration include conductivity measurements and flow measurements.<br>
Conductivity measurements are inherently less accurate in order to determine the<br>
recovery of solutes which are substantially retained by the membrane. In this regard,<br>
conductive salts, typically used as an indicator during conductive measurements, can<br>
pass through the membrane. Since salts generally pass through the membrane as a<br>
percentage of the total salt concentration, changes in local concentration due to<br>
concentration gradients or the like can change the conductivity of the product water<br>
without necessarily indicating membrane damage. This is especially true in the last<br>
stage of a multi-stage cross flow membrane system where salt concentrations (and,<br>
therefore, passage of salts as a percentage of that concentration) reach their highest<br>
levels. In this regard, the salt passage/ percent rejection parameter is generally<br>
determined as an average value based on values measured during all stages of the<br>
membrane system.<br>
Further, flow meters generally employed in such systems are subject to<br>
calibration inaccuracies, thus requiring frequent calibration. Moreover, typical<br>
monitoring of reverse osmosis and other membrane separations can routinely require<br>
the additional and/or combined use of a number of different techniques, thus increasing<br>
the complexity and expense of monitoring.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists to monitor and/or control membrane separation<br>
processes which can treat feed streams, such as aqueous feed streams, suitable for use<br>
in industrial processes where conventional monitoring techniques are generally<br>
complex and/or may lack the sensitivity and selectivity necessary to adequately monitor<br>
one or more process parameters specific to membrane separation processes which are<br>
important to the evaluation of the performance of membrane separation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods and systems for monitoring and/or<br>
controlling membrane separation processes capable of treating feed streams suitable for<br>
use in industrial processes. In this regard, the detection of inert fluorescent tracers and<br>
tagged fluorescent agents is utilized to evaluate and/or control a number of different<br>
process parameters unique to membrane separation, such as operational parameters,<br>
chemical parameters, a ratio of the inert fluorescent tracer to the tagged fluorescent<br>
agent, mechanical parameters and combinations thereof.<br>
The inert fluorescent tracer/tagged fluorescent agent monitoring technique of<br>
the present invention can be performed with a high degree of sensitivity and selectivity<br>
with respect to the monitoring of process parameters specific to a membrane separation.<br>
In this regard, the methods and systems of the present invention can be effectively<br>
utilized to optimize the performance of membrane separation processes. Examples of<br>
such optimized performance include longer times between membrane cleanings, longer<br>
membrane life, verification of treatment chemical in the system, tracking of chemical<br>
consumption, ability to operate at optimal recovery, and decreased energy costs due to<br>
better control of scaling, fouling and other system parameters.<br>
To this end, in an embodiment of the present invention, a method for<br>
monitoring a membrane separation process including a membrane capable of separating<br>
a feed stream into a first stream and a second stream to remove solutes from the feed<br>
stream is provided. The method includes the steps of providing an inert fluorescent<br>
tracer and a tagged fluorescent agent; introducing the inert fluorescent tracer and<br>
tagged fluorescent agent into the feed stream; providing a fluorometer to detect the<br>
fluorescent signal of the inert fluorescent tracer and the tagged fluorescent agent in at<br>
least one of the feed stream, the first stream and the second stream; and using the<br>
fluorometer to determine an amount of the inert fluorescent tracer and the tagged<br>
fluorescent agent in at least one of the feed stream, the first stream and the second<br>
stream.<br>
In another embodiment, a method for monitoring a membrane separation system<br>
of a water purification process including a membrane capable of removing solutes from<br>
a feed stream suitable for use in an industrial process is provided. The method includes<br>
the steps of adding an inert fluorescent tracer and a tagged fluorescent agent to the feed<br>
stream; contacting the membrane with the feed stream; separating the feed stream into a<br>
permeate stream and a concentrate stream to remove solutes from the feed stream;<br>
providing a fluorometer to detect the fluorescent signal of the inert fluorescent tracer<br>
and the tagged fluorescent agent in at least one of the feed stream, the permeate stream<br>
and the concentrate stream; using the fluorometer to measure an amount of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer and the tagged fluorescent agent in at least one of the feed stream, the<br>
permeate stream and the concentrate stream; and determining a ratio of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer to the tagged fluorescent agent based on the measurable amounts of<br>
the inert fluorescent tracer and the tagged fluorescent agent.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a membrane separation system capable of purifying<br>
a feed stream suitable for use in an industrial process is provided. The membrane<br>
separation system includes a semi-permeable membrane capable of separating the feed<br>
stream containing an inert fluorescent tracer and a tagged fluorescent agent into a<br>
permeate stream and a concentrate stream to remove one or more solutes from the feed<br>
stream; adetection device capable of fluorometrically measuring an amount of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer and the tagged fluorescent agent each ranging from about 5 parts per<br>
trillion ("ppt") to about 1000 parts per million ("ppm") in at least one of the feed<br>
stream, the permeate stream and the concentrate stream wherein the detection device is<br>
capable of producing a signal indicative of the amount of inert fluorescent tracer and<br>
tagged fluorescent agent that is measured; and a controller capable of processing the<br>
signal to monitor and/or control the purification of the feed stream. Such monitoring or<br>
control may include control of chemical dosing and checking the accuracy/calibration<br>
of standard instruments (e.g. flow sensors).<br>
In still another embodiment, a method for monitoring and controlling a<br>
membrane separation process including a membrane capable of removing solutes from<br>
a feed stream for use in an industrial process is provided. The method includes the<br>
steps of adding an inert fluorescent tracer and a tagged fluorescent agent to the feed<br>
stream; contacting the membrane with the feed stream; separating the feed stream into a<br>
first effluent stream and a second effluent stream to remove solutes from the feed<br>
stream; providing a fluorometer to detect the fluorescent signal of the inert fluorescent<br>
tracer and the tagged fluorescent agent in at least one of the feed stream, the first<br>
effluent stream and the second effluent stream; using the fluorometer to measure the<br>
inert fluorescent tracer and the tagged fluorescent agent in an amount ranging from<br>
about 5 ppt to about 1000 ppm in at least one of the feed stream, the first effluent<br>
stream and the second effluent stream; and evaluating at least one process parameter<br>
specific to membrane separation based on the measurable amounts of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer and the tagged fluorescent agent.<br>
It is, therefore, an advantage of the present invention to provide methods and<br>
systems that utilize inert fluorescent tracers in combination with tagged fluorescent<br>
agents to monitor and/or control membrane separation processes or systems.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to provide methods and systems<br>
that utilize measurable amounts of inert fluorescent tracers and tagged fluorescent<br>
agents to improve the operational efficiency of membrane separation processes or<br>
systems.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is to provide methods and systems<br>
for monitoring parameters specific to membrane separation processes with selectivity,<br>
specificity and accuracy based on measurable amounts of inert fluorescent tracers and<br>
tagged fluorescent agents added to the membrane separation system.<br>
Yet another advantage of the present invention is to provide methods and<br>
systems for monitoring and/or controlling membrane separation processes for purifying<br>
aqueous feed streams suitable for use in industrial water systems.<br>
Still further an advantage of the present invention is to enhance performance of<br>
membrane separation processes or systems that utilize cross-flow and/or dead-end flow<br>
separation to remove solutes from feed streams.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in,<br>
and will be apparent in, the detailed description of the presently preferred<br>
embodiments.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides methods and systems for monitoring and/or<br>
controlling membrane separation processes that are capable of removing solutes from<br>
feed streams, such as aqueous feed streams, which are suitable for use in a number of<br>
different industrial applications. More specifically, the methods and systems of the<br>
present invention can monitor and/or control membrane separation processes based on<br>
measurable amounts of inert fluorescent tracers and tagged fluorescent agents which<br>
have been added to the membrane separation process. In this regard, a number of<br>
different process parameters specific to membrane separation including, for example,<br>
operational parameters, chemical parameters, mechanical parameters, like parameters<br>
and combinations thereof, can be evaluated with a high degree of selectivity, specificity<br>
and accuracy such that the performance of the membrane separation process can be<br>
effectively optimized.<br>
Applicants have surprisingly discovered that the monitoring of an inert<br>
fluorescent tracer in combination with a tagged fluorescent agent can be effectively<br>
utilized to monitor and/or control a variety of different parameters specific to<br>
membrane separation, particularly with respect to monitoring and/or controlling the<br>
effects of treatment agents on the scaling and/or fouling during membrane separation.<br>
With inert fluorescent tracer monitoring, it is assumed that the inert molecule of<br>
the fluorescent tracer and the treatment molecule of the treatment agent can be both<br>
concentrated and/or rejected or otherwise passed through a given membrane separation<br>
system at the same rate. In other words, the inert fluorescent molecule is assumed to<br>
behave in substantially the same manner as the treatment molecule.<br>
However, treatment agents can be adsorbed on the surface of growing crystals<br>
or otherwise associated with the crystals and/or the membrane or other surfaces present<br>
in the system. In this regard, a portion of the treatment agent initially added to the<br>
membrane separation system can be effectively taken out of solution, thus rendering<br>
that portion of the treatment agent useless or "spent."<br>
When the treatment agent is modified so that it contains a fluorescent moiety<br>
(fluorophore) as part of its chemical structure, it is said to be "tagged" and then<br>
functions as the tagged fluorescent agent.<br>
The tagged fluorescent agent used in combination with the inert fluorescent<br>
tracer can be effectively utilized to monitor the effect of the treatment agent in the<br>
membrane separation process. The tagged fluorescent agent and the inert fluorescent<br>
tracer must have similar rejection characteristics with respect to the type of membrane<br>
used for optimal monitoring performance. On one level, monitoring of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer can be utilized to monitor the dosage of the treatment agent added to<br>
membrane separation. Further, the tagged fluorescent agent can be utilized to monitor<br>
the active chemical ingredient of the treatment. The active chemical ingredient of the<br>
treatment is that part of the chemical treatment which adsorbs onto the surface of<br>
growing crystals as discussed above.<br>
In this regard, the treatment agent (or molecule thereof) is tagged or<br>
incorporated with a fluorescent tag or group such that effects on the treatment due to,<br>
for example, adsorption of the treatment agent on a growing crystal, can be evaluated.<br>
Thus, loss of treatment can be detected by evaluating changes in the ratio of inert<br>
fluorescent tracer to tagged fluorescent agent as measured. Applicants have uniquely<br>
discovered that such a system can indicate consumption of the active treatment agent<br>
and can be used to controllably and responsively increase and/or decrease the amount<br>
of treatment agent(s) or product(s) added to membrane separation depending on actual<br>
conditions rather than assumptions based on the sole monitoring of inert fluorescent<br>
tracers.<br>
The methods and systems of the present invention can include a variety of<br>
different and suitable components, process steps, operating conditions and the like, for<br>
monitoring and/or controlling membrane separation processes or systems. In an<br>
embodiment, the membrane separation process of the present invention includes cross<br>
flow and dead-end flow processes. During cross-flow processes, the feed stream can be<br>
treated in a flow direction that is substantially parallel to the membrane of the<br>
separation system. With respect to dead-end flow separation processes, the feed stream<br>
can be treated in a flow direction that is substantially perpendicular to the membrane of<br>
the separation system.<br>
In general, the membrane separation processes of the present invention are<br>
capable of treating or purifying aqueous feed streams by dividing the feed stream into<br>
separate streams. In an embodiment, the feed stream is separated into at least a first<br>
and second stream, such as a permeate stream and a concentrate stream. The feed<br>
stream can contain various solutes, such as dissolved organics, dissolved inorganics,<br>
dissolved solids, suspended solids, the like or combinations thereof. Upon separation<br>
of the feed stream into the permeate and the concentrate, in membrane filters for<br>
example, the permeate stream essentially contains a substantially lower concentration<br>
of dissolved and/or suspended solutes as compared to the aqueous feed stream. On the<br>
other hand, the concentrate stream has a higher concentration of dissolved and/or<br>
suspended solutes as compared to the aqueous stream. In this regard, the permeate<br>
represents a purified feed stream, such as a purified aqueous feed stream.<br>
It should be appreciated that the present invention can be utilized with respect to<br>
a number of different types of membrane separation processes including, for example,<br>
cross-flow processes, dead-end flow processes, reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration,<br>
microfiltration, nanofiltration, electrodialysis, electrodeionization, pervaporation,<br>
membrane extraction, membrane distillation, membrane stripping, membrane aeration<br>
and the like or combinations thereof. Reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, microfiltration<br>
and nanofiltration are the preferred membrane separation processes.<br>
In reverse osmosis, the feed stream is typically processed under cross-flow<br>
conditions. In this regard, the feed stream flows substantially parallel to the membrane<br>
surface such that only a portion of the feed stream diffuses through the membrane as<br>
permeate. The cross-flow rate is routinely high in order to provide a scouring action<br>
that lessens membrane surface fouling. This can also decrease concentration<br>
polarization effects (e.g., concentration of solutes in the reduced-turbulence boundary<br>
layer at the membrane surface which can increase the osmotic pressure at the<br>
membrane and thus reduces permeate flow). The concentration polarization effects can<br>
inhibit the feed stream water from passing through the membrane as permeate, thus<br>
decreasing the recovery ratio, e.g., the ratio of permeate to applied feed stream. A<br>
recycle loop(s) may be employed to maintain a high flow rate across the membrane<br>
surface.<br>
Reverse osmosis processes can employ a variety of different types of<br>
membranes. Such commercial membrane element types include, without limitation,<br>
hollow fiber membrane elements, tubular membrane elements, spiral-wound membrane<br>
elements, plate and frame membrane elements, and the like, some of which are<br>
described in more detail in "The Nalco Water Handbook," Second Edition, Frank N.<br>
Kemmer ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, N.Y., 1988, incorporated<br>
hereinto, particularly Chapter 15 entitled "Membrane Separation". It should be<br>
appreciated that a single membrane element may be used in a given membrane<br>
filtration system, but a number of membrane elements can also be used depending on<br>
the industrial application.<br>
A typical reverse osmosis system is described as an example of membrane<br>
filtration and more generally membrane separation. Reverse osmosis uses mainly spiral<br>
wound elements or modules, which are constructed by winding layers of semi-porous<br>
membranes with feed spacers and permeate water carriers around a central perforated<br>
permeate collection tube. Typically the modules are sealed with tape and/or fiberglass<br>
over-wrap. The resulting construction has one channel which can receive an inlet flow.<br>
The inlet stream flows longitudinally along the membrane module and exits the other<br>
end as a concentrate stream. Within the module, water passes through the semi-porous<br>
membrane and is trapped in a permeate channel which flows to a central collection<br>
tube. From this tube it flows out of a designated channel and is collected.<br>
In practice, membrane modules are stacked together, end to end, with inter-<br>
conncctors joining the permeate tubes of the first module to the permeate tube of the<br>
second module, and so on. These membrane module stacks are housed in pressure<br>
vessels. Within the pressure vessel feed water passes into the first module in the stack,<br>
which removes a portion of the water as permeate water. The concentrate stream from<br>
the first membrane becomes the feed stream of the second membrane and so on down<br>
the stack. The permeate streams from all of the membranes in the stack are collected in<br>
the joined permeate tubes. Only the feed stream entering the first module, the<br>
combined permeate stream and the final concentrate stream from the last module in the<br>
stack are commonly monitored.<br>
Within most reverse osmosis systems, pressure vessels are arranged in either<br>
"stages" or "passes." In a staged membrane system, the combined concentrate streams<br>
from a bank of pressure vessels are directed to a second bank of pressure vessels where<br>
they become the feed stream for the second stage. Commonly systems have 2 to 3<br>
stages with successively fewer pressure vessels in each stage. For example, a system<br>
may contain 4 pressure vessels in a first stage, the concentrate streams of which feed 2<br>
pressure vessels in a second stage, the concentrate streams of which in turn feed 1<br>
pressure vessel in the third stage. This is designated as a "4:2:1" array. In a staged<br>
membrane configuration, the combined permeate streams from all pressure vessels in<br>
all stages are collected and used without further membrane treatment. Multi-stage<br>
systems are used when large volumes of purified water are required, for example for<br>
boiler feed water. The permeate streams from the membrane system may be further<br>
purified by ion exchange or other means.<br>
In a multi-pass system, the permeate streams from each bank of pressure vessels<br>
are collected and used as the feed to the subsequent banks of pressure vessels. The<br>
concentrate streams from all pressure vessels are combined without further membrane<br>
treatment of each individual stream. Multi-pass systems are used when very high<br>
purity water is required, for example in the microelectronics or pharmaceutical<br>
industries.<br>
It should be clear from the above examples that the concentrate stream of one<br>
stage of an RO system can be the feed stream of another stage. Likewise the permeate<br>
stream of a single pass of a multi-pass system may be the feed stream of a subsequent<br>
pass. A challenge in monitoring systems such as the reverse osmosis examples cited<br>
above is that there are a limited number of places where sampling and monitoring can<br>
occur, namely the feed, permeate and concentrate streams. In some, but not all,<br>
systems "inter-stage" sampling points allow sampling/monitoring of the first stage<br>
concentrate/second stage feed stream. Similar inter-pass sample points may be<br>
available on multi-pass systems as well.<br>
In practice it is possible to "probe" the permeate collection tube within a single<br>
pressure vessel to sample the quality of the permeate from each of the membrane<br>
elements in the stack. It is a time consuming;, messy and inexact method and is not<br>
routinely applied except in troubleshooting situations. There is no currently accepted<br>
method of examining the feed/concentrate stream quality of individual membrane<br>
elements within a single pressure vessel.<br>
In contrast to cross-flow filtration membrane separation processes, conventional<br>
filtration of suspended solids can be conducted by passing a feed fluid through a filter<br>
media or membrane in a substantially perpendicular direction. This effectively creates<br>
one exit stream during the service cycle. Periodically, the filter is backwashed by<br>
passing a clean fluid in a direction opposite to the feed, generating a backwash effluent<br>
containing species that have been retained by the filter. Thus conventional filtration<br>
produces a feed stream, a purified stream and a backwash stream. This type of<br>
membrane separation is typically referred to as dead-end flow separation and is<br>
typically limited to the separation of suspended particles greater than about one micron<br>
in size.<br>
Cross-flow filtration techniques, on the other hand, can be used for removing<br>
smaller particles (generally about one micron in size or less), colloids and dissolved<br>
solutes. Such types of cross-flow membrane separation systems can include, for<br>
example, reverse osmosis, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, electrodialysis<br>
or the like. Reverse osmosis can remove even low molecular weight dissolved species<br>
that are at least about 0.0001 to about 0.001 microns in minimum diameter, including,<br>
for example, ionic and nonionic species, low molecular weight molecules,<br>
water-soluble macromolecules or polymers, suspended solids, colloids, and such<br>
substances as bacteria and viruses.<br>
In this regard, reverse osmosis is often used commercially to treat water that has<br>
a moderate to high (e.g., 500 ppm or greater) total dissolved solids ("TDS") content.<br>
Typically on order of from about 2 percent to about 5 percent of the TDS of a feed<br>
stream will pass through the membrane. Thus, in general the permeate may not be<br>
entirely free of solutes. In this regard, the TDS of reverse osmosis permeates may be<br>
too high for some industrial applications, such as use as makeup water for high pressure<br>
boilers. Therefore, reverse osmosis systems and other like membrane separation<br>
systems are frequently used prior to and in combination with an ion exchange process<br>
or other suitable process to reduce the TDS loading on the resin and to decrease the<br>
amount of hazardous material used and stored for resin regeneration, such as acids and<br>

As discussed above, the performance of membrane separation systems can vary<br>
with respect to a number of different operational conditions specific to membrane<br>
separation, such as temperature, pH, pressure, permeate flow, activity of treatment<br>
and/or cleaning agents, fouling activity and the like. When developing and/or<br>
implementing a monitoring and/or control program based on the detection of<br>
fluorescent agents (e.g., inert fluorescent tracers and tagged fluorescent agents), the<br>
effects of the operational conditions specific to membrane separation must necessarily<br>
be taken into consideration. As previously discussed, the operational conditions of<br>
water treatment processes can vary greatly from process to process. In this regard, the<br>
monitoring techniques as applied to each process can also vary greatly.<br>
Membrane separation processes and the monitoring thereof are unique because<br>
of the following considerations.<br>
1. Systems are constructed with limited flexibility in terms of where<br>
monitoring may be<br>
done and/or where samples may be collected.<br>
2. Membrane separation systems include a concentration polarization layer that<br>
forms as<br>
water is permeated through the barrier. This is not present in other water treatment<br>
systems, such as cooling water systems.<br>
3. Membrane separation systems operate at significantly lower temperatures<br>
than<br>
industrial processes where inverse solubility of solutes is a problem. However, in the<br>
case of membrane separation systems such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration, this<br>
low temperature leads to scaling from salts that are less likely to be problematic in<br>
higher temperature processes (such as silica and silicate salts). In this regard, typical<br>
day-to-day membrane separation operations (for example RO and NF) occur at about<br>
75°F.<br>
4. Because it is essential that the surface of the membrane remain clean, a<br>
relatively<br>
small amount of fine precipitate can cause a significant performance loss. The<br>
performance loss in a membrane is, thus, more sensitive to precipitate deposition as<br>
compared to cooling water treatment. In this regard, performance loss in a membrane<br>
can occur at a film thickness appreciably lower than that required for heat transfer loss<br>
to occur in a cooling water system.<br>
5. Water loss in membrane filtration is due to "permeation" or passage through<br>
the<br>
membrane barrier. Damaged or otherwise imperfect membranes are susceptible to<br>
undesirable leakage of solutes through the membrane. Thus it is critical to monitor<br>
leakage through the membrane to keep it operating at maximum efficiency.<br>
6. The thin, semi-permeable films (polymeric, organic or inorganic) are<br>
sensitive to<br>
degradation by chemical species. Products which contact the membranes surface must<br>
be compatible with the membrane chemistry to avoid damaging the surface and thereby<br>
degrading performance.<br>
7. Chemical treatments used in membrane systems must be demonstrated to be<br>
compatible with the membrane material prior to use. Damage from incompatible<br>
chemicals can result in immediate loss of performance and perhaps degradation of the<br>
membrane surface. Such immediate, irreversible damage from a chemical treatment is<br>
highly uncommon in cooling water systems.<br>
Based on these differences, a number of different factors and considerations<br>
must necessarily be taken into account when developing and/or implementing<br>
monitoring and/or controlling programs with respect to membrane separation systems<br>
as compared to other water treatment processes, such as cooling water treatment<br>
processes.<br>
For example, both the cost of the membrane and the energy consumed can be<br>
significant operating cost factors specific to a membrane separation process. In this<br>
regard, deposits of scale and foulants on the membrane, on a small scale, can adversely<br>
impact the performance of membrane separation systems by, in membrane filtration for<br>
example, decreasing the permeate flow for a given driving force, lowering the permeate<br>
quality (purity), increasing energy consumed to maintain a given permeate flow,<br>
causing membrane replacement and/or unscheduled downtime for membrane<br>
replacement or cleaning/renovation, other like conditions and combinations thereof. In<br>
this regard, the continuous monitoring of process parameters specific to membrane<br>
separation, such as a ratio of inert fluorescent tracer to tagged fluorescent agent, the<br>
normalized permeate flow, driving force, and percent rejection, are generally believed<br>
to be critical to the detection of fouling and/or scaling and, thus, the implementation of<br>
remedial measures when such problems are observed. In reverse osmosis, about a ten<br>
to fifteen percent change in any of these parameters routinely signals a scaling/fouling<br>
problem requiring a responsive action, such as the adjustment of the dosage of<br>
treatment agent. Thus, detection of these problems at the earliest possible time can<br>
prevent, for example, undue energy consumption, loss of product, premature membrane<br>
replacement or the like. Ideally, when an unfavorable or questionable condition or<br>
change is detected in a system, some means, such as an alarm, will be used to notify an<br>
operator of the condition or change. Corrective action may then be taken as necessary<br>
or appropriate.<br>
Applicants have uniquely, discovered that the monitoring and/or controlling<br>
techniques of membrane separation processes in accordance with the present invention<br>
are faster, more sensitive, more comprehensive and/or more reliable than conventional<br>
techniques presently available, particularly where the monitoring methods of the<br>
present invention are employed on a substantially continuous basis. The present<br>
invention has enhanced diagnostic capabilities such that, for example, lack of chemical<br>
treatment, scaling and/or fouling problems unique to membrane separation and<br>
consumption of active chemical treatment can be detected with reasonable certainty,<br>
with far greater sensitivity, under a far less elapsed time than the presently available<br>
methods. In this regard, temporary system upsets or other short-lived variations can be<br>
detected during continuous monitoring as the transient conditions that they are, rather<br>
than as incorrect warning signs as detected by sporadic monitorings.<br>
As previously discussed, the methods and systems of the present invention<br>
employ inert fluorescent tracers in combination with tagged fluorescent agents to<br>
monitor and/or control the membrane separation processes. By utilizing inert<br>
fluorescent tracers with tagged fluorescent agents, the present invention can evaluate a<br>
number of different membrane separation process parameters with a greater selectivity,<br>
sensitivity and accuracy as compared to conventional monitoring techniques. In this<br>
regard, the measurable amount of inert fluorescent tracers and tagged fluorescent agents<br>
can be effectively utilized to optimally maximize the performance of such systems.<br>
For example, chemical consumption can be determined by comparing the<br>
concentrations of the inert fluorescent tracer to the tagged fluorescent agent. Ideally,<br>
the concentration ratio of the inert fluorescent tracer to the tagged fluorescent agent<br>
should be 1/1. As the tagged fluorescent agent is consumed (for example by adsorbing<br>
onto a crystal), the concentration ratio will begin to change. For instance, the<br>
concentration of the tagged fluorescent agent may drop, changing the ratio from 1/1 to<br>
1/0.9 (which is to say the ratio of the concentrations is 1.1). As the concentration of the<br>
tagged fluorescent agent drops still further, for example down to 0.5 units of<br>
concentration, the ratio also changes. In this case, the ratio becomes 1/0.5 or 2. It<br>
should be appreciated that the ratio of concentrations is a unitless number. Thus, from<br>
this example it can be seen that an increase of the concentration ratio signifies<br>
consumption of the tagged fluorescent agent and as such is indicative of the onset of<br>
scaling and/or fouling in the membrane.<br>
The term "inert," as used herein refers to an inert fluorescent tracer that is not<br>
appreciably or significantly affected by any other chemistry in the system, or by the<br>
other system parameters such as pH, temperature, ionic strength, redox potential,<br>
microbiological activity or biocide concentration. To quantify what is meant by "not<br>
appreciably or significantly affected", this statement means that an inert fluorescent<br>
compound has no more than a 10% change in its fluorescent signal, under severe<br>
conditions encountered in industrial water systems. Severe conditions normally<br>
encountered in industrial water systems are known to people of ordinary skill in the art<br>
of industrial water systems.<br>
It should be appreciated that a variety of different and suitable inert fluorescent<br>
tracers can be utilized in any suitable amount, number and application. For example, a<br>
single tracer can be used to evaluate a number of different membrane separation<br>
process parameters. However, the present invention can include the use of a number of<br>
different tracers each functioning as tracers for separate monitoring applications. In an<br>
embodiment, inert fluorescent tracer monitoring of the present invention can be<br>
conducted on a singular, intermittent or semi-continuous basis, and preferably the<br>
concentration determination of the tracer in the stream is conducted on-site to provide a<br>
rapid real-time determination.<br>
An inert fluorescent tracer must be transportable with the water of the<br>
membrane separation system and thus substantially, if not wholly, water-soluble therein<br>
at the concentration it is used, under the temperature and pressure conditions specific<br>
and unique to the membrane separation system. In other words, an inert fluorescent<br>
tracer displays properties similar to a solute of the membrane separation process in<br>
which it is used. In an embodiment, it is preferred that the inert fluorescent tracer of<br>
the present invention meet the following criteria:<br>
1. Not be adsorbed by the membrane to any appreciable amount;<br>
2. Not degrade the membrane or otherwise hinder its performance or alter<br>
its<br>
composition;<br>
3. Be detectable on a continuous or semi-continuous basis and susceptible<br>
to concentration measurements that are accurate, repeatable and capable of being<br>
performed on feedwater, concentrate water, permeate water or other suitable media or<br>
combinations thereof;<br>
4. Be substantially foreign to the chemical species that are normally<br>
present in the water of the membrane separation systems in which the inert fluorescent<br>
tracer(s) may be used;<br>
5. Be substantially impervious to interference from, or biasing by, the<br>
chemical species that are normally present in the water of membrane separation<br>
systems in which the inert fluorescent tracer(s) may be used;<br>
6. Be substantially impervious to any of its own potential specific or<br>
selective losses from the water of membrane separation systems, including selective<br>
permeation of the membrane;<br>
7. Be compatible with all treatment agents employed in the water of the<br>
membrane separation systems in which the inert fluorescent tracer(s) may be used, and<br>
thus in no way reduce the efficacy thereof;<br>
8. Be compatible with all components of its formulation; and<br>
9. Be relatively nontoxic and environmentally safe, not only within the<br>
environs of the water or the membrane separation process in which it may be used, but<br>
also upon discharge therefrom.<br>

salts thereof; 1,8-anthracenedisulfonic acid (CAS Registry No. 61736-92-3) and salts<br>
thereof; and mixtures thereof. The fluorescent tracers listed above are commercially<br>
available from a variety of different chemical supply companies.<br>
In addition to the tracers listed above, those skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
salts using alternate counter ions may also be used. Thus, for example, anionic tracers<br>
which have Na+ as a counter ion could also be used in forms where the counter ion is<br>
chosen from the list of: K+, Li+, NR4+, Ca+2, Mg+2 or other appropriate counter ions. In<br>
the same way, cationic tracers may have a variety of counter ions, for example: C1,<br>
SO4-2 PO4-3 HPO4-2; H2PO4-; CO3-2;<br>
HCO3'; or other appropriate counter ions.<br>
Modifications of these tracers to control molecular weight or physical size<br>
within a desirable size range by, for example, affixing them to an inert polymeric<br>
molecule, incorporating them into a fluorescent microsphere or adding additional<br>
chemical moieties in the side chains of the molecules should be obvious to those skilled<br>
in the art. Such modifications are included herein.<br>
As previously discussed, the inert fluorescent tracer is used in combination with<br>
the tagged fluorescent agent to enhance monitoring of membrane separation,<br>
particularly with respect to the monitoring and effect of treatment agents added to<br>
membrane separation in order to treat scaling and/or fouling.<br>
In this regard, the inert fluorescent tracer and the tagged fluorescent agent can<br>
each be measured such that fluctuations in the ratio of the inert fluorescent tracer to the<br>
tagged fluorescent agent can be monitored. Such fluctuations can be used to signal<br>
consumption of a chemical treatment agent, the onset of scaling and/or fouling, or the<br>
like. Adjustments to membrane separation can then be made controllably and<br>
responsively to correct for fluctuations with respect to the ratio. Thus, membrane<br>
separation performance can be enhanced by, for example, adjusting the amount of<br>
treatment agents added to optimize the treatment of scale, foulants and other like<br>
deposits which can adversely impact membrane separation.<br>
The fluorescent compounds of the present invention (i.e. the inert fluorescent<br>
tracer, the tagged fluorescent agent, or combinations thereof) can be added to the<br>
membrane separation process in any suitable form. For example, the present invention<br>
utilizes a combination of inert fluorescent tracers and tagged fluorescent agents. In this<br>
regard, the inert fluorescent tracers can be utilized to monitor the dosage of treatment<br>
agents (e.g., anti-sealants and/or biocides) that are added to the process. The tagged<br>
fluorescent agents can be utilized to monitor the active chemical ingredient of such<br>
treatment. Thus, the loss of treatment due to, for example, adsorption of a treatment<br>
agent on a growing crystal, can be detected based on fluctuations in the ratio of inert<br>
fluorescent tracer(s) to tagged fluorescent agents during membrane separating. The<br>
diagnostic capabilities of the present invention can be performed with a high degree of<br>
sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy with respect to the monitoring of process<br>
parameters specific to a membrane separation. In this regard, the method and system of<br>
the present invention can be effectively utilized to optimize the performance of<br>
membrane separation processes.<br>
The tagged fluorescent agent can include a variety of different and suitable<br>
materials. In an embodiment, the tagged fluorescent agent includes a polymeric<br>
compound that has one or more fluorescent groups attached or incorporated to its<br>
polymeric structure. In an embodiment, the polymeric compound has a molecular<br>
weight that ranges from about 2000 atomic mass units ("amu") to about 20,000 amu.<br>
The polymeric compound is water-soluble and has one or more monomer components<br>
in any suitable amount including, for example, acrylamide, acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylamide, vinyl acetate, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate methyl chloride quaternary<br>
salt, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate benzyl chloride quaternary salt, diallyldimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride, N-vinyl formamide, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate methyl<br>
chloride quaternary salt, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate benzyl chloride quaternary<br>
salt, methacrylamino propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, acrylamidopropyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride, and combinations thereof. Different combinations of these<br>
polymeric compounds may be chosen for their ability to target specific scales.<br>
The fluorescent group of the tagged fluorescent agent can include a variety of<br>
different and suitable materials including, hydroxy allyloxypropyl napthalimide quat, 4-<br>
methoxy-N-(3-N'N'-dimethylaminopropyl) napthalimide, 2-hydroxy-3-allyloxypropyl<br>
quat, 8-(3-vinylbenzyloxy)-l, 3, 6-pyrene trisulfonic acid, 8-(4-vinylbenzy!oxy)-l, 3, 6-<br>
pyrene trisulfonic acid, 8-(allyloxy)-l, 3, 6-pyrene trisulfonic acid, 1-(substituted)<br>
naphthalene, 9-(substituted) anthracene, 2-(substituted) quinoline monohydrochloride,<br>
2-(substituted) benzimidazole, 5-(substituted) fluorescein, 4-(substituted) coumarin,<br>
coumarin derivatives, 3-(substituted)-6, 7-dimethoxy-1-methyl-2(1H)-quinoxazoIinone,<br>
mixtures thereof and derivatives thereof.<br>
In an embodiment, the tagged fluorescent agent of the present invention<br>
includes a hydroxy allyloxy propyl naphthalimide quat, such as 4-methoxy-N-(3-N',N'-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl) napthalimide, 2-hydroxy-3-allyloxy propyl quat, tagged onto a<br>
35% aqueous solution of a sulfomethylated copolymer of acrylate and acrylamide<br>
wherein the fluorescent group is an amount of about 2% or less by weight of the<br>
polymeric compound. A variety of different and suitable tagged fluorescent agents are<br>
disclosed in the U.S. Patent Nos. 5,128,419; 5,171,450; 5,216,086; 5,260,386 and<br>
5,986,030 which are each herein incorporated by reference. In an embodiment, the<br>
tagged fluorescent agent or moiety is stable at a pH ranging from about 2 to about 10.<br>
It should be appreciated that a variety of different and suitable modifications,<br>
variations and/or derivatives thereof of the above-described tagged fluorescent agents<br>
and/or fluorescent groups can be utilized. For example, the hydrogen of the sulfonic<br>
acid groups of the substituted pyrene trisulfonic acids discussed above can be replaced<br>
with a suitable metal ion including, for example, sodium, potassium, cesium, rubidium,<br>
lithium and ammonium. Further, the allyloxy group of the substituted pyrene sulfonic<br>
acid can include any suitable number of carbon atoms including, for example, three,<br>
four, five, six, eight, eleven and the like.<br>
It should be appreciated that the amount of inert fluorescent tracer and tagged<br>
fluorescent agent to be added to the membrane separation process that is effective<br>
without being grossly excessive will vary with a respect to a variety of factors<br>
including, without limitation, the monitoring method selected, the extent of background<br>
interference associated with the selected monitoring method, the magnitude of the<br>
expected tracer(s) concentration in the feedwater and/or concentrate, the monitoring<br>
mode (such as an on-line continuous monitoring mode), and other similar factors. In an<br>
embodiment, the dosage of each of an inert fluorescent tracer(s) and tagged fluorescent<br>
agent to the feed water of the membrane separation system includes an amount that is at<br>
least sufficient to provide a measurable concentration of the fluorescent agents (i.e.,<br>
inert fluorescent tracer and tagged fluorescent agent) in the concentrate at steady state<br>
of at least about 5 ppt, and preferably at least about 1 part per billion ("ppb") or about 5<br>
ppb or higher, such as, up to about 100 ppm or about 200 ppm, or even as high as about<br>
1000 ppm in the concentrate or other effluent stream. In an embodiment, the amount of<br>
fluorescent agents ranges from about 5 ppt to about 1000 ppm, preferably from about 1<br>
ppb to about 50 ppm, and more preferably from about 5 ppb to about 50 ppb.<br>
It should be appreciated that the concentration of tagged fluorescent agent can<br>
be modified by varying the number of fluorescent groups on the polymeric compound<br>
and/or varying the concentration of the polymeric compound.<br>
The terms "tracing" and "monitoring" as used herein, unless expressly indicated<br>
otherwise, mean the determination of the concentration of the fluorescent agents in the<br>
membrane separation process. In an embodiment, the tracing/monitoring can be<br>
conducted on a singular, intermittent or semi-continuous basis, and preferably the<br>
concentration determination is conducted on-site to provide a rapid real-time<br>
determination.<br>
In an embodiment, the fluorescent agents of the present invention can be added<br>
to a membrane separation system as a component of a formulation, rather than as a<br>
separate component, such as a dry solid or neat liquid. The inert fluorescent tracer<br>
formulation or product may include an aqueous solution or other substantially<br>
homogeneous mixture that disperses with reasonable rapidity in the membrane<br>
separation system to which it is added. In this regard, the concentration of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer may be correlated to the concentration of a product. In an<br>
embodiment, the product or formulation can include a treatment agent which is added<br>
to treat scaling and/or fouling.<br>
As previously discussed, the inert fluorescent tracer(s) and tagged fluorescent<br>
agents can be measured or detected to evaluate the performance of the membrane<br>
separation process. This can be performed in any suitable manner. A determination of<br>
the presence of a fluorescent compound and the concentration thereof in the<br>
influent/feedwater and/or other stream of a membrane separation process can be made<br>
when the concentration of the compound in the influent/feedwater and/or other stream<br>
of a membrane separation system is several ppm or less, even as low as several ppt.<br>
At times, it may be desired to employ a number of different inert fluorescent<br>
tracers and tagged fluorescent agents. Such separate and distinct tracers and/or tagged<br>
fluorescent agents can each be detected and quantified in a single influent/feedwater<br>
and/or other stream fraction provided that their respective wavelengths of emission do<br>
not interfere with one another. Thus, concurrent analyses for multiple tracers and/or<br>
tagged fluorescent species are possible by selection of fluorescent agents having<br>
appropriate spectral characteristics.<br>
The inert fluorescent tracers and tagged fluorescent agents of the present<br>
invention can be detected by utilizing a variety of different and suitable techniques. For<br>
example, fluorescence emission spectroscopy on a substantially continuous basis, at<br>
least over a given time period, is one of the preferred analytical techniques according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. One method for the continuous on-stream<br>
measuring of chemical species by fluorescence emission spectroscopy and other<br>
analysis methods is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,992,380, B.E. Moriarty, J.J. Hickey,<br>
W.H. Hoy, J.E. Hoots and D.A. Johnson, issued February 12, 1991, incorporated<br>
hereinto by reference.<br>
In general, for most fluorescence emission spectroscopy methods having a<br>
reasonable degree of practicality, it is preferable to perform the analysis without<br>
isolating in any manner the fluorescent species. Thus, there may be some degree of<br>
background fluorescence in the influent/feedwater and/or concentrate on which the<br>
fluorescence analysis is conducted. This background fluorescence may come from<br>
chemical compounds in the membrane separation system (including the<br>
influent/feedwater system thereof) that are unrelated to the membrane separation<br>
process of the present invention.<br>
In instances where the background fluorescence is low, the relative measurable<br>
intensities (measured against a standard fluorescent compound at a standard<br>
concentration and assigned a relative intensity, for instance 100) of the fluorescence of<br>
each of the tracer and the tagged fluorophore versus the background can be very high,<br>
for instance a ratio of 100/10 or 500/10, when certain combinations of excitation and<br>
emission wavelengths are employed even at low fluorescent compound concentrations.<br>
Such ratios would be representative of a "relative fluorescence" (under like conditions)<br>
of respectively 10 and 50. In an embodiment, the excitation/emission wavelengths<br>
and/or the amount of each of the tracer and tagged fluorophore employed are selected<br>
to provide a relative fluorescence of at least about 5 or 10 for the given background<br>
fluorescence anticipated.<br>
Examples of fluorometers that may be used in the practice of this invention<br>
include the TRASAR® 3000 and TRASAR® 8000 fluorometers (available from Ondeo<br>
Nalco Company of Naperville, IL); the Hitachi F-4500 fluorometer (available from<br>
Hitachi through Hitachi Instruments Inc. of San Jose, CA); the JOBIN WON<br>
FluoroMax-3 "SPEX" fluorometer (available from JOBIN WON Inc. of Edison, NJ);<br>
and the Gilford Fluoro-IV spectrophotometer or the SFM 25 (available from Bio-tech<br>
Kontron through Research Instruments International of San Diego, CA). It should be<br>
appreciated that the fluorometer list is not comprehensive and is intended only to show<br>
examples of fluorometers. Other commercially available fluorometers and<br>
modifications thereof can also be used in this invention.<br>
It should be appreciated that a variety of other suitable analytical techniques<br>
may be utilized to measure the amount of inert fluorescent tracers and tagged<br>
fluorescent agents during the membrane separation process. Examples of such<br>
techniques include combined HPLC-fluorescence analysis, colorimetry analysis, ion<br>
selective electrode analysis, transition metal analysis and the like.<br>
For example, the combination of high-pressure liquid chromatography<br>
("HPLC") and fluorescence analyses of inert fluorescent tracers and tagged fluorescent<br>
agents can be utilized todetect measurable amounts of the inert fluorescent tracers and<br>
tagged fluorescent agents within the membrane separation system of the present<br>
invention, particularly when very low levels of the inert fluorescent tracers and tagged<br>
fluorescent agents are used or the background fluorescence encountered would<br>
otherwise interfere with the efficacy of fluorescence analysis. The HPLC-fluorescence<br>
analysis method allows inert fluorescent tracers and tagged fluorescent agents to be<br>
separated from the fluid matrix and then the tracer concentration(s) can be measured.<br>
The HPLC method can also be effectively employed to separate a tracer and/or<br>
tagged fluorescent agent(s) from a fluid matrix for the purposes of then employing a<br>
detection method(s) other than fluorescence analysis. An example of this type of<br>
chromatographic technique is described in "Techniques in Liquid Chromatography",<br>
C.F. Simpson ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 121-122, 1982, incorporated<br>
herein by reference, and "Standard Method For The Examination Of Water And<br>
Wastewater", 17th Edition, American Public Health Association, pp. 6-9 to 6-10, 1989,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
With respect to colorimetry analysis, colorimetry and/or spectrophotometry may<br>
be employed to detect and/or quantify a fluorescent species including an inert<br>
fluorescent tracer and/or a tagged fluorescent agent or other fluorescent group.<br>
Colorimetry is a determination of a chemical specie from its ability to absorb ultraviolet<br>
or visible light. Colorimetric analysis techniques and the equipment that may be<br>
employed therefor are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,992,380, B.E. Moriarty, J.J.<br>
Hickey, W.H. Hoy, J.E. Hoots and D.A. Johnson, issued February 12, 1991,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
With respect to ion selective electrode analysis, an ion selective electrode may<br>
be used to determine the concentration of an inert fluorescent tracer and/or a tagged<br>
fluorescent agent through the direct potentiometric measurement of specific ionic<br>
tracers in aqueous systems. An example of an ion selective electrode tracer monitoring<br>
technique is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,992,380, B.E. Moriarty, J.J. Hickey, W.H.<br>
Hoy, J.E. Hoots and D.A. Johnson, issued February 12, 1991, incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
It should be appreciated that analytical techniques for detecting and/or<br>
quantifying the presence and/or concentration of a chemical specie without isolation<br>
thereof are within an evolving technology. In this regard, the above survey of<br>
analytical techniques suitable for use in detecting measurable amounts of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer(s) and/or tagged fluorescent agent(s) during the membrane separation<br>
process of the present invention may presently not be exhaustive. Thus, analytical<br>
techniques equivalent to the above for purposes of the present invention may likely be<br>
developed in the future.<br>
As previously discussed, the present invention can provide highly selective<br>
and/or sensitive monitoring of a variety of process parameters unique and specific to<br>
the membrane separation process. The monitoring is based on the measurable amounts<br>
of an inert fluorescent tracer in combination with a tagged fluorescent agent analyzed<br>
during the membrane separation process. In this regard, the fluorescent species (i.e.,<br>
inert fluorescent tracer and tagged fluorescent agent) can be detected at any suitable<br>
location or locations within the membrane separation process, such as any suitable<br>
position in a membrane filtration process along the feedwater stream, the concentrate<br>
stream, the permeate stream, the like or combinations thereof. This effectively<br>
corresponds to a concentration of the fluorescent species in each stream.<br>
In an embodiment, the monitoring of the membrane filtration process of the<br>
present invention can be based on a measurable amount of each of the tracer (i.e., the<br>
inert fluorescent tracer and tagged fluorescent agent) from at least one of the feedwater<br>
stream, the permeate<br>
stream and the concentrate stream.<br>
In this regard, monitoring of an amount of the inert fluorescent tracer and<br>
tagged fluorescent agent as it may vary during membrane filtration can be utilized to<br>
evaluate a number of process parameters specific to membrane filtration such as the<br>
ratio of the inert fluorescent tracer to the tagged fluorescent agent or the like, with a<br>
high degree of sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy, as previously discussed. The<br>
ability to evaluate these types of membrane separation process parameters with such<br>
level of certainty, sensitivity and selectivity and on a continual basis in accordance with<br>
the present invention can provide a better understanding, in real time, of the<br>
performance of the membrane. Thus, adjustments to the membrane separation process<br>
can be made more responsively and effectively based on the measured amount of the<br>
inert fluorescent tracer and/or the tagged fluorescent agent, if needed, to optimize<br>
membrane performance. For example, adjustments can be made to increase the<br>
recovery ratio or percent recovery of the membrane separation system. In this regard,<br>
increasing the recovery ratio or percent recovery, for unit product, will reduce the<br>
feedwater required and thus reduce feedwater costs, lower influent fluid pretreatment<br>
costs and chemical treatment requirements. It should be appreciated that the optimal<br>
percent rejection value can vary with respect to the type of membrane separation<br>
system.<br>
However, unless controlled or optimally minimized, the scale and/or fouling of<br>
the membrane can adversely impact the performance of membrane separation. If<br>
deposition on the membrane is neither prevented nor detected soon enough for effective<br>
removal by cleaning methods, the normal life of the membrane, which can be about<br>
three to five years for reverse osmosis, may be severely shortened and replacement<br>
costs dramatically increased. As previously discussed, the membrane separation<br>
systems are more sensitive to such scaling and/or fouling activity as compared to<br>
cooling water systems. It should be appreciated that the membrane separation system of<br>
the present invention can include any suitable type and amount of components in order<br>
to effectively treat the scale and/or fouling conditions, such as, any suitable treatment<br>
or pretreatment system including antiscalants and/or biofouling agents, filters,<br>
treatment equipment, such as chemical agent delivery devices, like suitable components<br>
or combinations thereof.<br>
For example, suitable antiscalants that can be used in the membrane separation<br>
system (especially reverse osmosis systems) of the present invention include suitable<br>
polymers in aqueous solution which can inhibit the formation and growth of alkaline<br>
earth carbonate and sulfate scales, including calcium carbonate ("CaCO3"). calcium<br>
sulfate ("CaSO4") or the like. Antiscalant chemicals are generally fed continuously<br>
into the feed stream wherein the optimum feed point is before a cartridge prefilter<br>
positioned along the feedwater stream. The use of a continuous feed of antiscalants can<br>
minimize or eliminate the need for acid to be fed into the system in order to control<br>
scale, and can facilitate the suspension of solids and colloids in solution. This can<br>
minimize membrane fouling, and inhibit the precipitation of CaCO3 and CaSO4.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention can monitor and/or control the<br>
concentration of the scaling and/or biofouling treatment agents within the membrane<br>
separation process based on the measurable amounts of tracer in the system. In an<br>
embodiment, the inert fluorescent tracer is continuously fed to the feedwater along with<br>
the tagged fluorescent treatment agents. It should be appreciated that the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer can be added separately or as a part of a formulation of the treatment<br>
agent to the feedwater. In an embodiment, the inert fluorescent tracer is fed to the<br>
feedwater in known proportion to the scaling and/or biofouling agent. In this regard,<br>
the measure of the inert fluorescent tracer concentration corresponds to (is proportional<br>
to) the chemical concentration (under zero-system-consumption conditions) at any<br>
suitable tracer monitoring point within the membrane separation system.<br>
As previously discussed, the tagged fluorescent agents are utilized in<br>
combination with the inert fluorescent tracers. In this regard, one or more types of<br>
fluorescent tags can be added to a polymeric compound suitable for use as a water<br>
treatment agent in order to effectively monitor the effects of the treatment agents on the<br>
membrane separation.<br>
Applicants have discovered that the use of a tagged fluorescent agent in<br>
combination with an inert fluorescent tracer provides an added level of monitoring as<br>
compared to the sole use of an inert fluorescent tracer. In this regard, the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer component can be monitored to evaluate the dosage of treatment<br>
agent added to the membrane separation system, and the tagged fluorescent agents can<br>
be monitored to evaluate an active chemical ingredient (e.g., one that is reactive within<br>
the system, such as adsorbing to a growing crystal). Thus, a decrease in the effects of<br>
the treatment agent(s) due to, for example, a loss of the treatment agent due to<br>
adsorption on a growing crystal, can be monitored and detected by evaluating a change<br>
in a ratio of inert to tagged fluorophores.<br>
The chemicals or treatment agents employed as antiscalants and/or anti-fouling<br>
agents, and the mechanisms by which they inhibit scale deposition, may change as<br>
improvements are made in antiscalant chemistry for membrane filtration systems, but<br>
the need for a continuous feed of treatment agents will most likely continue despite the<br>
improvements. The preferred inert and tagged fluorophores of the present invention,<br>
will substantially have a rejection factor of 1, and more preferably will be employed in<br>
minute concentrations. Thus, the use of the tracer of the present invention will not in<br>
any significant manner add to the total dissolved solids ("TDS") of the permeate nor<br>
detrimentally affect a downstream ion exchange process or other permeate polishing<br>
process.<br>
The rejection factor is defined as follows:<br>
Rejection Factor = ( CF - CP) / CF<br>
where Cf is the concentration of the fluorophore in the feed stream and Cp is the<br>
concentration of the fluorophore in the permeate stream.<br>
The tracers (i.e., inert and tagged fluorophores) of the present invention can be<br>
utilized to monitor a variety of different parameters specific to membrane separation<br>
such that the performance of membrane separation processes can be effectively<br>
monitored and controlled. In an embodiment, the parameters can include, for example,<br>
operational parameters, chemical parameters, mechanical parameters, and combinations<br>
thereof. In this regard, the present invention can be utilized to assess and/or control a<br>
variety of different process conditions that can impact membrane performance, for<br>
example, scaling and/or fouling conditions, membrane leakage, degradation and the<br>
like specific to the membrane separation process.<br>
The methods of the present invention can include any suitable type, number and<br>
combination of components, such as tracer compounds, tracer detection devices (e.g.,<br>
analytical techniques) or the like. In an embodiment, the chemical compound(s)<br>
selected as the tracer(s) is soluble in the membrane separation stream to which it is<br>
added to the concentration value desired and is substantially stable in the environment<br>
thereof for the useful life expected of the tracers) (e.g., tagged and/or inert). In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the combination of the chemical compound(s) selected as the<br>
tracer(s) and the analytical technique selected for determining the presence of such<br>
tracer(s) permits such determination without isolation of the tracer(s), and more<br>
preferably should permit such determination on a continuous and/or on-line basis.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention includes a controller (not shown) to<br>
monitor and/or control the operating conditions and the performance of the membrane<br>
separation process based on the measurable amount of tracer(s) (e.g., inert fluorescent<br>
tracer and tagged fluorescent agent). The controller can be configured and/or adjusted<br>
in a variety of different and suitable ways.<br>
For example, the controller can be in contact with a detection device (not<br>
shown) to process the detection signal (e.g., filter noise from the signal) in order to<br>
enhance the detection of the tracer concentration. Further, the controller can be adjusted<br>
to communicate with other components of the membrane separation system. The<br>
communication can be either hard wired (e.g., electrical communication cable), a<br>
wireless communication (e.g., wireless RF interface), a pneumatic interface or the like.<br>
In this regard, the controller can be utilized to control the performance of<br>
membrane separation. For example, the controller can communicate with a feed device<br>
(not shown) in order to control the dosage of treatment agents, such as antiscalants and<br>
biocides, within the membrane separation process based on the monitoring of the<br>
measurable amounts of inert fluorescent tracers, tagged fluorescent agents and ratios<br>
thereof.<br>
It should be appreciated that pairs or groups of tracer monitoring points that are<br>
to be compared should not be positioned across a flow-through site that has a high<br>
concentration of solids, for instance a solids concentration of at least about 5 or about<br>
10 weight percent per unit volume based on a measured volume unit of about one cubic<br>
inch. Such high solids concentration flow-through sites are found at the site of filter<br>
cakes and the like. In this regard, these sites may absorb, or selectively absorb, at least<br>
some amount of the tracer. This can distort the significance of monitoring comparison.<br>
When a tracer is added upstream of, for instance, a cartridge filter, in an embodiment,<br>
the first monitoring location of a monitoring pair should preferably be downstream of<br>
such sites.<br>
However, separate monitorings across a flow-through site of high solids<br>
concentration may be conducted to determine the loss of tracer from the fluid, and if<br>
such loss is nonselective for the tracer, the loss of other solutes at that site. For<br>
instance, when the flow-through site is a cartridge filter, such monitorings can<br>
determine the loss of solutes, if any, attributable to that pretreatment location. Other<br>
high solids concentration sites include without limitation sites of solids concentration(s)<br>
created by the use of chemical additives, such as coagulants, flocculants and the like.<br>
In an embodiment, the inert fluorescent tracer selected is not a visible dye, that<br>
is, the inert fluorescent tracer is a chemical specie that does not have a strong<br>
absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the visible region, which extends from about<br>
4000 Angstroms to about 7000 Angstroms (from about 400 nanometers ("nm") to about<br>
700 nm). Preferably the tracer is chosen from a class of materials which are excited by<br>
absorption of light and product fluorescent light emission, where the excitation and<br>
emission light occurs at any point within the far ultraviolet to near infrared spectral<br>
regions (wavelengths from 200 - 800 nm). The relative fluorescence intensity of the<br>
inert fluorescent tracer must be such that it is detectable in the amounts specified by<br>
product formulations (typically 2-10 ppb as active fluorophore when dosed into the<br>
feed water stream of a device).<br>
Alternatively, when the tracer dye does have strong adsorbtions in the visible<br>
spectrum, it is used in concentrations such that it is not detectable to the naked eye.<br>
Such embodiments may be preferred, for instance, when a membrane's percent<br>
rejection of the tracer is less than 100 percent, and it is desirable to produce a permeate<br>
free of color.<br>
In some instances it may be preferable to chose a fluorophore which emits<br>
visible fluorescent light when excited by UV light. This may be preferred when visual<br>
detection and/or photographic or other imaging of the system is desired.<br>
Although membrane separation systems are often employed for the purification<br>
of water, or the processing of aqueous streams, the systems of the present invention are<br>
not limited to the use of an aqueous influent. In an embodiment, the influent may be<br>
another fluid, or a combination of water and another fluid. The operational principles<br>
of membrane separation systems and processes of the present invention are not so<br>
governed by the nature of the influent that the present invention could not be employed<br>
with influents otherwise suitable for water purification in a given membrane separation<br>
system. The descriptions of the invention above that refer to aqueous systems are<br>
applicable also to nonaqueous and mixed aqueous/nonaqueous systems.<br>
In an embodiment, the fluorescent tracer (e.g., inert and/or tagged) monitoring<br>
methods of the present invention can be utilized to monitor membranes which are<br>
subjected to destructive (sacrificial) testing. This type of testing may include the<br>
sectioning or division of an industrial membrane, for instance by cutting, into a number<br>
of separate membranes pieces prior to testing so that a number of tests can be<br>
performed, each on a different section of the membrane. The fluorescent tracer<br>
monitoring of the present invention can be utilized to monitor a number of different<br>
parameters of destructive testing including without limitation the effects of excessive<br>
pressure, contact with a membrane-destructive fluid and the like. The diagnostic<br>
regime of the destructive testing would generally be focused on the membrane which<br>
may be subjected to visual inspection of its surface, a membrane-surface<br>
microbiological analysis by swabbing of its surface and analysis of water samples in<br>
contact with membrane, surface analysis for inorganic deposits by scanning electron<br>
microscopy/eiectrodispersive spectroscopy ("SEM/EDS"), surface analysis for organic<br>
deposits by infrared ("IR") spectroscopy, electron microscopy, ionically coupled<br>
plasma ("1CP") analysis and like surface analysis techniques.<br>
Although the membrane during destructive testing is not on-line, in an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the tracer can be added to a fluid stream which<br>
flows to the membrane and passes by or through it as a first effluent stream to exit as a<br>
second effluent stream. The tracer can be added to the fluid upstream of the membrane<br>
and the tracer in the fluid stream at least passes by the membrane as a component of the<br>
first effluent stream and/or passes through the membrane to exit as a component of the<br>
second effluent stream. The tracer is monitored in the fluid stream at a point before the<br>
membrane to determine an influent tracer concentration value, and/or in at least one of<br>
the first and the second effluent streams to determine an effluent tracer concentration.<br>
In this regard, the tracer is representative of a solute of the fluid stream that can be<br>
added to the fluid in an amount sufficient for the determinations of influent tracer<br>
concentration and effluent tracer concentration. Thus, the separation performance of<br>
the membrane can be determined prior to actual use.<br>
"Deposits" is meant herein to refer to material that forms and/or collects on<br>
surfaces of a membrane. The "amount" or "concentration" of inert fluorescent tracers<br>
and/or tagged fluorescent agents, is meant herein to refer to the concentration of a<br>
fluorescent species in the specified fluid in terms of weight of the species per unit<br>
volume of the fluid, or weight of the species per unit weight of the fluid, or some<br>
characteristic of the species that is proportional to its concentration in the fluid and can<br>
be correlated to a numerical value of the species concentration in the fluid (whether or<br>
not that correlation conversion is calculated), and can be a value of zero or substantially<br>
zero. Thus, the present process includes the detection of the absence of such chemical<br>
species, at least to the limitations of the analytical method employed.<br>
The foregoing descriptions of the present invention at times refer specifically to<br>
aqueous influents and effluents, and the use of an aqueous system for describing a<br>
membrane filtration system and the operation of the present invention therein is<br>
exemplitive. A person of ordinary skill in the art, given the disclosures of the present<br>
specification, would be aware of how to apply the foregoing descriptions to<br>
nonaqueous membrane filtration systems.<br>
"Treatment chemicals and/or agents" is meant herein without limitation to<br>
include treatment chemicals that enhance membrane separation process performance,<br>
antiscalants that retard/prevent membrane scale deposition, antifoulants that<br>
retard/prevent membrane fouling, biodispersants, microbial-growth inhibiting agents,<br>
such as biocides, and cleaning chemicals that remove membrane deposits, like<br>
materials and combinations thereof.<br>
It should be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to all industries<br>
that can employ membrane separation processes. For example, the different types of<br>
industrial processes in which the method of the present invention can be applied<br>
generally include raw water processes, waste water processes, industrial water<br>
processes, municipal water treatment, food and beverage processes, pharmaceutical<br>
processes, electronic manufacturing, utility operations, pulp and paper processes,<br>
mining and mineral processes, transportation-related processes, textile processes,<br>
plating and metal working processes, laundry and cleaning processes, leather and<br>
tanning processes, and paint processes.<br>
In particular, food and beverage processes can include, for example, dairy<br>
processes relating to the production of cream, low-fat milk, cheese, specialty milk<br>
products, protein isolates, lactose manufacture, whey, casein, fat separation, and brine<br>
recovery from salting cheese. Uses relating to the beverage industry including, for<br>
example, fruit juice clarification, concentration or deacidification, alcoholic beverage<br>
clarification, alcohol removal for low-alcohol content beverages, process water; and<br>
uses relating to sugar refining, vegetable protein processing, vegetable oil<br>
production/processing, wet milling of grain, animal processing (e.g., red meat, eggs,<br>
gelatin, fish and poultry), reclamation of wash waters, food processing waste and the<br>
like.<br>
Examples of industrial water uses as applied to the present invention include,<br>
for example, boiler water production, process water purification and recycle/reuse,<br>
softening of raw water, treatment of cooling water blow-down, reclamation of water<br>
from papermaking processes, desalination of sea and brackish water for industrial and<br>
municipal use, drinking/raw/surface water purification including, for example, the use<br>
of membranes to exclude harmful micro-organisms from drinking water, polishing of<br>
softened water, membrane bio-reactors, mining and mineral process waters.<br>
Examples of waste water treatment applications with respect to the tracer<br>
monitoring of the methods of the present invention include, for example, industrial<br>
waste water treatment, biological waste treatment systems, removal of heavy metal<br>
contaminants, polishing of tertiary effluent water, oily waste waters, transportation<br>
related processes (e.g., tank car wash water), textile waste (e.g., dye, adhesives, size,<br>
oils for wool scouring, fabric finishing oils), plating and metal working waste,<br>
laundries, printing, leather and tanning, pulp and paper (e.g., color removal,<br>
concentration of dilute spent sulfite liquor, lignon recovery, recovery of paper<br>
coatings), chemicals (e.g., emulsions, latex, pigments, paints, chemical reaction by-<br>
products), and municipal waste water treatment (e.g., sewage, industrial waste).<br>
Other examples of industrial applications of the present invention include, for<br>
example, semiconductor rinse water processes, production of water for injection,<br>
pharmaceutical water including water used in enzyme production/recovery and product<br>
formulation, and electro-coat paint processing.<br>

tracers include, but are not limited to, effective "residence times" for species within the<br>
membrane, system flow profiles, membrane damage detection, system recovery based<br>
on mass balance, detection of scaling or fouling tendency (based on differences<br>
between mass balance and flow based system parameters), system volume calculation,<br>
chemical treatment product distribution and feed variability.<br>
While the present invention is described above in connection with preferred or<br>
illustrative embodiments, these embodiments are not intended to be exhaustive or<br>
limiting of the invention. Rather, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives,<br>
