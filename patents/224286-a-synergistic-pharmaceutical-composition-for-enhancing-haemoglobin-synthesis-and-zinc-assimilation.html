This invention relates to synergistic pharmaceutical composition for enhancing haemoglobin synthesis and Zinc assimilation. This pharmaceutical composition consists of vitamins of the Group B, Vitamin C, three essential amino acids, necessary for haemoglobin synthesis metabolism and Zinc and iron salts which compliment and assist in haemoglobin synthesis thereby promoting growth and reducing the rest of immunodeficiency.<br>
Vitamins are heterogenous organic compounds essential in small quantities for maintaining normal health, promoting growth and reducing the risk of infection. Human metabolic activity does not result in the synthesis of vitamins and as such they are to form a part of dietary intake regularly. Vitamins are either water soluble or oil soluble. Oil soluble vitamins are retained by the human system for a relatively longer period than the water soluble vitamins which are eliminated from the system easily. The need arises, therefore, to supplement the vitamins required by the system regularly. Most important water soluble vitamins belong to the vitamin 'B' group and vitamin 'C. Deficiency of vitamin B group is known to cause weight loss, Pellagra, Neuromuscular disorders, Beri beri, anaemia and the like. Vitamin C is yet another water soluble vitamin which needs to be supplemented almost daily. Scurvy and anaemia may result if vitamin C is deficient in dietary intake.  Further it has also<br><br>
been  established that a combination of vitamin C and iron enhances iron assimilation by the system.<br>
Proteins are complex nitrogen containing compounds formed mainly by amino acid residues joined by peptide linkage. Complex proteins like glycoproteins, nucleoproteins, lipoproteins, chromoproteins and the like have residues of carbohydrates, fats and nucleo acids conjugated with amino acid residues. Haemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein present in red blood cells is a conjugate protein of four haemo groups which are organo metallic compounds containing iron. It is observed that the diminution of the amount of total haemoglobin circulating in the blood stream results in anaemia. Absence of iron in food intake or improper assimilation of iron by the system causes anaemia. Growing children, women, nursing mothers and convalescents require more haemoglobin and their diets should be supplimented by iron containing compounds. Haemoglobin deficiency and resultant anaemia are more common in the developing and under-developed countries due to imbalanced intake of vitamins and minerals. Out of the twenty three amino acids generaly found in human metabolism, as building blocks for proteins, only eight are not produced by the system during metabolic activity. It has already been established that these eight amino acids should find a place in the daily intake of food for maintaining proper growth and vitality.  Out of these eight<br><br>
vital amino acids, three are found essential in haemoglobin synthesis metabolically. They are glycine, histidine and lysine. It has also been established that a composition of these three amino acids and an iron source increases the metabolic production of haemoglobin.<br>
From the above description it is clear that a combination of the three amino acids, vitamin B complex, vitamin C and a source of iron facilitates haemoglobin synthesis and easy assimilation of iron.<br>
Zinc is another essential trace element which plays a vital role in physiological processes. Many enzymes required for human metabolic activity are metallo enzymes having one or more inorganic elements as their constituents. Zinc is found to be an important trace element that forms a part of certain vital metallo enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of synthesising carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Zinc containing enzymes are also found to be beneficial in cell mediated immunity in convalescing patients. It is found that breast fed infants consume about 5 mg of zinc per day. During pregnancy and lactation increased intake of zinc is recommended. Zinc also is found to play a role in reducing hair fall and the process of ageing in humans. We have now found that a combination of the three amino acids that go in the making of haemoglobin, B group<br><br>
of vitamins, vitamin C, a source of iron and a source of zinc enhances haemoglobin synthesis and increases assimilation of thhe trace elements, iron and 2inc, during metabolic activity. We have also found that such a composition exhibits properties fundamentally different from the compounding ingredients and shows reinforced properties as the different components compliment each other in enhancing haemoglobin synthesis and in the increased assimilation of essential minerals like zinc and iron. The composition is found to be a synergestic dietary supplement resulting in augmenting immunity, promoting growth and health.<br>

Obvious modifications and alterations known to persons skilled in the art are within the scope of this invention and the appended claims.<br><br>
Synergistic Hematinic Composition<br>
The present invention is the novel composition, as there is no such composition in the prior art.<br>
The present invention (Composition 1) relates to a synergistic composition of a pharmaceutically acceptable ferrous salt; an effective amount of amino acids, an effective amount of vitamins along with Zinc. The composition also contains an effective amount of iron absorption enhancer, such as ascorbic acid, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, binder, or excipient, formulated into a suitable pharmaceutical formulation, especially capsule but not limiting to the same.<br>
During pregnancy the daily requirement of iron and zinc increases.The standard therapy for both iron and zinc deficiencies is the administration of iron and zinc supplementation. The co-administration of iron and zinc is restricted due to the fact that prenatal supplemental iron may adversley affect the maternal zinc status and vice versa. Inhibition of zinc absorption due to iron supplementation may adversely influence the maternal zinc status and alter the net zinc transfer to the fetus.<br>
This study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of the present invention in improving the iron and zinc levels and thereby to treat these deficiencies. The efficiency of the present invention (Composition 1) is compared with similar other two compositions.<br><br><br><br>
A baseline and periodic observations were recorded for the following parameters during the two month study period.<br>
1.	Hemoglobin level.<br>
2.	Zinc level.<br>
3.	RBC Count.<br>
4.	Packed cell Volume.<br>
5.	Peripheral Smear.<br>
The results are shown in table 1.<br><br>
From the above table, the group (2) who received composition 1, the mean hemoglobin level thai was 10.5 gm/dl at the baseline, had been increased to 12.9 gm/dl after 2 months of therapy. In the groups (3) and (4) the mean hemoglobin level that was at 10.4 gm/dl at baseline were increased to 10.8 gm/dl and 10.9 gm/dl respectively after treatment. The control group showed no similar response.<br>
The changes observed with the group (2), treated with the composition 1 was significant (p=0.02) when compared with other groups.<br>
In Group (3) the RBC count at baseline, 3.57 millions/cu mm increased to 3.68 millions/cu mm and the packed cell volume was increased from 33.6 % to 34.7 % after therapy.<br>
In the case of group (4) the RBC count increased from 3.46 millions/cu mm to 3.70 millions/cu mm and the packed cell volume increased from 33.4 % to 35.1 % after two month treatment.<br><br>
Whereas in Group (2), the RBC count 3.46 millions/cu mm at baseline was increased to 4.11 millions/cu mm and the packed cell volume that was 33.4 % at baseline was elevated to 37.6 %.<br>
The group 1 subjects showed no significant improvement in all the parameters studied. The changes observed with the group (2) are significant at (p= 0.02) for RBC count and (p=0.002) for packed cell volume when compared with other two groups.<br>
The peripheral smear showed microcytic hypochromic cells in all groups at baseline. However, after therapy only the group 2 patients who received formulation comprising the composition 1 got back their normocytic normochromic cells.<br>
The group 3 and group 4 subjects showed 3 n.g/dl of zinc level increase in serum and approximated to group l.The group 2 subjects who received the formulation according to the present invention (Composition 1) showed surprisingly a 20 ng/dl increase of serum zinc level (significant at p=0.017).<br>
Conclusion : These results supports that the present invention comprising of ferrous fumerate, amino acids, vitamins and zinc is both clinically as well statistically significant in increasing the Hemoglobin level, Zinc level, RBC count and Packed cell volume. Further it is the only composition that does not have any inhibition of zinc absorption due to iron supplementation and vice versa.<br>
Example 2<br>
The previous studies states that Zinc is absorbed through the intestinal tract into the body. In this process zinc in the form of a chelate with a low molecular weight carrier substance is transported from the intestinal lumen through the brush border membrane into the intestinal cells, temporarily stored in the form of zinc thioneine and then released into the blood stream when necessary to deliver zinc to the living tissues. It has not been well elucidated yet what molecules are carriers for zinc absorption. The elemental iron and a wide variety of iron supplements decreases this zinc absorption, as iron competes with zinc for absorption when taken together.<br>
The following study was performed to demonstrate the bioavailability of zinc from the compositions according to the present invention.<br><br>
Method<br>
Wistar rats of 8 weeks age were used in this study (n=12). The rats were fasted for 24 hours before they were given the compositions. The test composition was administered to the duodenum of ether-anesthetized rat as a solution or suspension in physiological saline. The dose of the composition was 10 mg/kg body weight as zinc in each case. Blood samples were collected before administration, 1,3,5 and<br>
7 hours after the administration. Plasma levels of zinc were determined using Zn Test Wako Kit. The absorbed amount of zinc was determined from the area under the curve (AUC) of blood level of zinc vs. time curve up to 7 hours.<br>
The results were shown in table 2.<br><br>
As shown in table 2 the bioavailability of zinc from composition 1 was much better than that of other two compositions.<br>
The present study clearly states that the new invention under composition 1 unexpectedly shows significantly higher bioavailability of zinc inspite of adminsistering it along with iron as evident from the group 3 and group 4 results.<br>
Conclusion: From the above result it is evident that only the present invention (Composition 1) has unusual superior bioavailability of zinc when taken together with iron.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Treatment of anemia in addition to identifying the source of iron deficiency typically involves administering iron supplements. These ferrous supplements are most efficient on an empty stomach and is often not tolerated for many peoples due to gastrointestinal side effects and this fact limits the amount of iron supplements that can be prescribed.<br>
Inorder to evaluate the tolerability of the compositions stated in the present invention this study was performed.<br>
Method<br>
Albino rats housed individually in stainless steel cages were fed a low-iron diet and de-ionized distilled water ad lib for 24 days. The low-iron diet contained not more than about 3 mg of iron per kg of diet. Following the 24 day depletion period, blood was drawn from the tail vein of each rat for hemoglobin analysis. Anemic rats were selected and used for further study.<br>
The rats were housed individually in cages. They were divided into four groups (n = 12) and were treated as follows.<br>
Group 1 - received placebo and served as control.<br>
Group 2 - received Composition 1.<br>
(Animal dose: lOmg Fe/kg of body weight)<br>
Group 3 - received Composition 2.<br>
(Animal dose: lOmg Fe/kg of body weight)<br>
Group 4 - received Composition 3.<br>
(Animal dose: lOmg Fe/kg of body weight)<br>
After 15 days the blood was drawn from the tail vein for hemoglobin analysis. The hemoglobin response to the compositions were stated in the table 3.<br><br><br><br>
The group 3 and group 4 animals exhibited gross internal changes different from group 1 namely fat depletion, thyroid nodules, reddened mandibular lymph nodes, reddened stomach mucosa, small thymus, foci on the thymus and dark fecal matter.<br>
In contrats the gross internal findings exhibited by group 2 animals were only reddened thymus and dark fecal matter indicating that the present invention is free from gastrointestinal side effects and hence well tolerated.<br>
Conclusion: From the above results, it is clear that only the present invention (Composition 1) is free from gastro intestinal side effects and well tolerated.<br><br><br>
