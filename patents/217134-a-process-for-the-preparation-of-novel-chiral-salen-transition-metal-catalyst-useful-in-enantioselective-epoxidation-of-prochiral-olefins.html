				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel chiral<br>
SALEN transition metal catalyst useful in enantioselective epoxidation of prochiral olefins.<br>
The chirally enriched epoxides are important intermediates in the synthesis of optically active medicines, including 6-cyano-2,2-dimethylbenzopyran, indene and styrene oxides also ecofriendly pest control agents and flavors.<br>
Enantioselective catalytic epoxidation of non-functionalised alkenes has emerged as a powerful tool for the synthesis of chirally enriched epoxides required as intermediates for chiral building blocks in the preparation of complex optically pure bio-active compounds. Several chiral drugs, viz., Crixivan (an HIV protease inhibitor), Cromakalim (a highly potent antihypertensive), Tetramisol ((5) form is a powerful anthelmintic) and many more under trial and developmental stage utilize optically pure epoxides as the key intermediate as reviewed by N. Collins, G. N. Sheldrake, J. Crossby (Eds), Chirality in Industry; The Commercial Manufacture and Application of Optically active Compound, Wiley, New Yorl, 1995; R. E. Gawley and J. Aube Principles of Asymmetric Synthesis, Ed. by J. E. Baldwin, Pergamon publication Chapter 8 Oxidation pp. 325 ; E. N. Jacobsen, In catalytic asymmetric synthesis, Ed. by Ojima, I. VCH publication, 1993. pp. 59.<br>
Among functionalised alkenes, Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols has emerged as one of the most widely applied reactions in asymmetric synthesis using titanium tartrate in presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant showing highest enantioselectivity. (R. A. Johnson and K. B. Sharpless, In catalytic asymmetric synthesis, Ed. by Ojima, I. VCH publication, 1993. pp. 103). This method requires pre-coordinating<br><br>
functional group on the substrate, in absence of which the method is no more enantioselective. Since many drug and agrochemical intermediates require epoxides of non-functionalised alkenes, this method is of little use for this purpose.<br>
Bolm, C., in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 1991, 30, 403 has reviewed the enantioselective epoxidation catalysis. Central idea of the research in this area has been to achieve high enantioselectivity in the epoxidation of alkenes bearing no functionality require for precoordination to the catalyst. Their selectivity is determined solely through non bonded interactions. Hence, transition metals catalysts emerged as the most preferred strategy to accomplish this task. These catalysts can utilize a range of oxidants namely, molecular oxygen, lodosyl arenes, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, mono persulphates and alkyl hydroperoxide. It is likely that these catalysts will be oxo transfer agents analogous to Cytochrome P-450 class of heme containing proteins. Groves' land mark discovery of iron (III) porphyrin complexes models was the first successful step towards synthetic model of Cytochrome P-450. Since then many fascinating and sophisticated porphyrins have been synthesized which include Basket handle, Twin Coronet porphyrins, Picnic Basket derivatives, Strapped porphyrins, D4 symmetric metalloporphyrins (Me Murry, T. J., Groves, J. T., Cytochrome P-450, Ortiz deMontellano, PR (Ed.) Polonium, New York 1986, Chapter 1). Although high turnover numbers have been observed (more than 3000) with maximum enantioselection up to 76 % enantiomeric excess (ee's) was obtained for cis-ß methyl styrene, the synthesis of these porphyrins is very complicated. It involves multi step synthesis and requires many anhydrous and inert reaction conditions. Not withstanding multi step, yields are very low hence, these routes are of little commercial value.<br><br>
In the last decades non-porphyrin based processes have been developed for asymmetric epoxidation of non-functionalised alkenes that employ an optically active manganese complex as an asymmetric catalyst. These processes are attracting attention because of their ability to yield optically active epoxy compound quite effectively.<br>
Reference may be made to Jacobsen, E. N., Zhang, W., PCX Int. Appl. WO. 9114, 694. US, Appl. 496,992, 1990, pp 63, wherein the author described condensation of 3-ferr-butyl salicylaldehyde with R,R 1,2 diphenyl 1,2 ethane diamine to yield Schiff base which on complexation with manganese(III) metal ion give a complex which was used as catalyst for the epoxidation of cis p-methyl styrene using two phase system containing Na2B4O7.10 H2O Clorox- sodium hydroxide as oxidant in dichloromethane and water with 70 % yield and 85 % enantiomeric excess. The drawbacks of the system are, (i) yields and selectivity are still not up to the desired level of more than 98%.<br>
Katsuki, T. in Japanese patent application laid- open No. 301878, (1993) described further modification in the catalyst reported by Jacobsen E. N. et al. as described in the previous paragraph by altering substituent tert-butyl group by more bulkier groups like substituted alkylphenyls and also the ethylenediamine collar by preparing non commercial diamines with a significant increase in chemical and optical yields. However, the core of the catalyst remains manganese(III) SALEN. Thus substituted salicylaldehydes (prepared in more than 6 steps) and diamines (prepared in more than 13 steps) are condensed to yield desired Schiff bases that were subsequently reacted with Mn salt to yield the catalysts. These complexes were used as catalysts in the epoxidation of non-functionalised olefins using iodosylbenzene, 2-iodosylbenzoicacid hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite. A range of non-functionalized olefins gave<br><br>
epoxide yield 52-82% and enantiomeric excess 79-94% with iodosylbenzene as oxidant in 24 hours while with sodium hypochlorite as oxidant epoxide yield ranges between 45-72% and enantiomeric excess 55-95%. The drawbacks of this system are, (i) catalyst synthesis involves multi-step processes (ii) reaction time is too long (-24 hrs), (iii) utilizes expensive oxidant (iodosyl benzene) in order to give reasonable yields (52-82%) and enantiomeric excess above 79% with various olefins.<br>
Bell, D., Miller, D., Attrill, R.P., PCT Int. Appl. WO 94, 03, 271(1994) / GB Appl. 1992/16,662,06 (1992) described synthesis of several substituted SALEN Schiff base complexes of transition metal and their utilization in enantioselective epoxidation of 2,2-dimethyl 6-pentaflouro ethyl 2H-1-benzopyran using aqueous sodium hypochlorite, di-sodium hydrogen phosphate (pH-11) in dichloromethane. The only change in the catalysts described here was 2,3-diaminotetrahydrofuran and 3,4-diaminotetrahydrofuran was used in place of commercially available chiral diamines. A multi step synthesis of these amines is described. Moreover the catalysis part described the use of unresolved catalyst with no mention of chiral induction. Here again as in the preceding patent the drawbacks are, (i) synthesis of the diamine used is multi step and unresolved therefore, of little commercial value.<br>
Katsuki, T, et al., in preparation of optically active epoxides using chiral manganese binaphthyl catalysts. U.S. (1997), 18 pp Cont.-in-part of US patent No. 5,420,314/(1995), and also in Japanese Patent appl. 94/25,337,23, (1996) described a detailed multi step synthesis of substituted silyl and naphthyl manganese(III) Schiff base complexes for producing epoxy compounds claiming the epoxidation of indene (chemical yield 53%), asymmetric yield (92%) with Iodosyl benzene as oxidant in 24 hours. They<br><br>
also epoxidised benzopyran with the same oxidant and achieved 70% chemical yield, 94% asymmetric yield. Expensive oxidants such as 2-Iodosyl benzoic acid and penta fluoro iodosyl benzene are also described. However, this strategy has got the following drawbacks; (i) Some of these catalysts show high activity and selectivity but they require expensive oxidants such as iodosyl benzene, 2-Iodosyl benzoic acid, penta fluoro iodosyl benzene etc (ii) most of these epoxidation reactions utilizing earlier mentioned complexes as catalyst require 16-24 hours for obtaining the maximum conversions with higher selectivity under the reported reaction conditions.<br>
Jacobsen E. N. et al., in United States Patent No. 5,637,739 (1997) described the synthesis of complexes having salen derivatives as ligand with manganese (III) metal ion and their use as catalyst for the chiral epoxidation of non-functionalised olefins. Using these catalyst (0.5-2.0 mol%) the epoxide conversions (-94-97%) and enantiomeric excesses (51-96%) for chromenes within 12 hours is reported, while the use of 20mol% of 4-phenyl pyridine N-oxide/4-t-butylpyridine-N-oxide as axial base/co-oxidant with these catalysts reduced the time period to 1-5 hours. Plain chromene failed to give any epoxide. The main drawbacks of the system are, (i) in order to show high activity and selectivity these catalysts required high quantities (20mol %) of expensive 4-phenyl pyridine N-oxide/4-t-butylpyridine-N-oxide as axial base/co-oxidant, (ii) turn over numbers of-50 are not very high (iii) System do not yield epoxide with plain chromene.<br>
In our earlier patent Kureshy, R. I. et al. 1352/DEL/99 and 1353/DEL/99, we have reported manganese(III) Schiff base complexes having inbuilt phase transfer capability (five steps synthesis of the catalyst is described) and achieved enantioselective epoxidation of indene (Chemical yield &gt;99% , asymmetric yield 81%) , 6-Cyano<br><br>
chromene (Chemical yield &gt;99, asymmetric yield 100%) and styrene (Chemical yield &gt;99% ,asymmetric yield 36-54%) within the period of 1-10 hours in presence of inexpensive simple pyridine N-oxidc/dioxane (lOmol %) as cooxidant/ axial base and sodium hypochlorite as oxidant. In the post epoxidation work-up process chromatographic separation is required to separate product epoxide from the catalyst. The main drawback of this system is (i) at least five step synthesis is required in order to create inbuilt phase transfer capability in the catalyst (ii) takes 1-10 hours for completion of epoxidation reaction (iii) post epoxidation work-up protocol is typical of homogeneous catalytic system and require chromatographic separation of the catalyst and the product epoxide.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process  for the<br>
preparation of novel chiral SALEN transition metal catalyst useful in enantioselective epoxidation of prochiral olefins which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of optically active transition metal complexes of the formula 1 where RpRg independently represent hydrogen atom, alkyls such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, alkoxys such as methoxy, ethoxy, halogens such as fluro, chloro, bromo, trifluromethyl, X may be none, methylene, alkyl substituted methylenes Where in alkyls such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso- propyl, n-butyl, A-B-A may be chirally pure vicinal diamines such S, S (+) 1, 2 diamino cyclohexane, R, R (-) 1, 2 diamino cyclohexane, S, S (-) 1, 2, diphenyl diamino ethane, R, R (+) 1,2 diphenyl diamino ethane, S (+) 1,2 diaminopropane, R (-) 1,2 diaminopropane and (m) may be 3-5 repetitive units and M can be transition metal ion such Cobalt(II), Manganese(III), Ruthenium (III), Nickel(II),<br><br>

Yet another object of the present invention is to have a simple and cost effective synthesis of the modified chiral SALEN metal complexes devoid of many complicated steps.<br>

In the process of the present invention, the syntheses of modified chiral Schiff<br>
base derived from specially designed polymerisable salicylaldehyde was carried out using appropriate commercially available phenols by first introducing aldehyde group followed by coupling reaction in presence of aldehyde such as formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, trioxane or mixture thereof in presence of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid and sulfuric acid to give the desired polymerisable substituted salicylaldehyde which was then interacted with appropriate commercially available chiral diamines in a solvent such as ethanol and methanol, nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, chloroform and 1,2 dichloroethane most preferably ethanol to give rise the modified chiral Schiff bases which are recrystallized with appropriate solvents and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, H NMR spectroscopy before these are used for the synthesis of the metal complexes which are prepared by thus synthesised chiral Schiff base compounds by dissolving or suspending one of these in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, a nitrile solvent such as acetonitrile, propionitrile or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, chloroform and 1,2 dichloroethane most preferably ethanol and methanol and mixture thereof followed by addition of metal salt in an amount of 0.5-10 molar equivalent preferably 1-3 molar equivalent initially under inert atmosphere finally under aerobic condition to yield desired optically active complex although if required acetate ion may be replaced by chloride, hexaflourophosphate to give the complexes used as catalysts for the epoxidation of non-mnctionalised prochiral alkenes with several terminal oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxide, molecular oxygen (with sacrificial reductant), per benzoic acid, such as m-chloro per benzoic acid aryl iodosyl benzene, oxone more preferably sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide , oxone, tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide, m-chloro per<br>

The activity of the catalyst in a metal base catalysed system is largely dependent on the availability of the active sites to the reactants. The chemo and enantio selectivity of the system depends on mode of approach of the substrate, which is largely governed by shape, size and polarity of the substituents on the ligand system of the complex. The inventive steps involved in the present invention are i) the number of the active sites were increased by making polymeric complexes in order to achieve high catalytic activity; ii) simple synthetic procedures are used in the present invention to synthesise desired high molecular weight catalysts in three steps starting from the preferred salicylaldehyde; iii) high molecular weight of catalysts enabled the work up protocol simpler as catalyst-product separation after completion of catalytic epoxidation reaction can be achieved by precipitation method using commonly used non-polar solvents; iv) the time period of the<br>
epoxidation reaction was reduced to 1-6 hours from the previously reported 1-10 hours, v) high conversion (&gt;99%) and enantiomeric excess's (ee's) (35-&gt;99%) were achieved with cheaper oxidant like sodium hypochlorite. vi) cheaper axial base like pyridine N-oxide was employed in lower molar ratios (5 equivalent with respect to the catalyst).<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
In a typical synthesis of the preferred optically active transition metal complexes as catalysts are described in following examples, in general appropriate substituted polymerizable salicylaldehydes are prepared by using simple synthetic procedures. These polymerizable salicylaldehydes are interacted with appropriate chiral diamines to form novel improved catalyst precursor chiral Schiff bases. The characterization of these ligands is accomplished by elemental analysis, IR and H NMR spectroscopy. These polymerizable Schiff base ligands were interacted with appropriate metal ion to get desired metal complexes used as chiral epoxidation catalyst.<br>

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	Synthesis of high molecular weight optically active transition complexes and their<br>
precursor ligands involve simple reaction procedures and conditions.<br>
2.	Commercial LR grade ingredients required no further purification.<br>
3.	Final work up protocol of the post catalytic run is simple and requires simply<br>
precipitation of the catalyst just by addition of a non-polar organic solvents.<br>
4.	In absence of any detectable amount of side products along with high conversions (on<br>
GC and NMR scale) the final work up protocol is further easy separation of the<br>
catalyst which is quite difficult in other homogeneous system.<br>
5.	Good isolated yields of epoxides are achievable with inexpensive oxidation reagents<br>
under mild reaction conditions.<br>
6.	Reaction rates are significantly faster than reported so far with these types of catalysts<br>
especially with the extent of selectivity disclosed here.<br>
7.   The phase transfer reagents alkyl ammonium halide can be used with biphasic catalytic runs to increase the rate of epoxidation with improved enantioselection in<br>
some cases.<br><br><br><br>
