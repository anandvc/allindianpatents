				<td>STRUCTURE OF DRIVING UNIT IN DRUM TYPE WASHING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a drum type washing machine, and more particularly, to a structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine. Background of the Invention<br>
In general, a drum type washing, making washing by using friction between a drum rotated by a motor and laundry in a state detergent, washing water, and the laundry are introduced into the drum, provides effects of beating and rubbing washing, but gives almost no damage to the laundry, and shows BO entangling of the laundry. A strbcrure of a related art drum washing machine will be explained with reference to FIG. 1. FIG. 1 illustrates a longitudinal section of a related art drum type washing machine, provided with a tub 2 mounted inside of a cabinet 1, a drum 3 rotatably mounted on a central portion of inside of the tub 2. There is a motor 5a under the tub 2 connected with a pulley 18. There is a drum shaft connected to a rear of the drum 3, to which a drum pulley 19 is coupled. And, the drum pulley 19 on the drum shaft and the motor . pulley 18 connected to the motor 5a are connected by a belt 20 for transmission of power. And, there is a door 21 in a front part of the cabinet 1, with a gasket 22 between the door 21 and the tub 2. There is a hanging spring between an inside of an upper portion of the cabinet 1 and an outside of an upper portion of the tub 2, and a friction damper 24 between an inside of a lower portion of the cabinet 1 and a lower side of an outside of the tub 2 for damping vibration of the<br>
tub 2 generated during spinning.<br>
However, the related art washing machine has the following disadvantages since driving power of the motor 5a is transmitted to the drum 3 through the motor pulley 18, and the drum pulley 19, and the belt 20 connecting the motor pulley 18 and the drum pulley 19.<br>
First, there is a loss of energy in a course of driving power transmission because the driving power is transmitted from the motor 5a to the drum 3, not directly, but through the belt 20 wound around the motor pulley 18 and the drum pulley 19.<br>
And, the driving power transmission from the motor 5a to the drum 3, not directly, but through many components, such as the belt 20, the motor pulley 18, and the drum pulley 19, causes much noise in the course of power transmission.<br>
The lots of components required for transmission of driving power from the motor 5a to the drum 3, such as the motor pulley 18, the drum pulley 19 and the belt 20, require many assembly man-hours. And, the more the number of components required for transmission of driving power from the motor 5a to the drum 3, the more number of spots which require repair, and the more frequent at which repair required. The imbalance caused by the motor mounted to a lower part of rear of the tub 2 causes heavy vibration when the motor is rotated. Consequently, there is a weight balancer of metal or cement separately provided tp,an opposite position of the motor for system balancing.<br>
In summary, the indirect driving power transmission from the motor 5 a to the drum 3 through the motor pulley, the drum pulley, and the belt requires many repair, has much noise, waste of energy, and results in a deterioration of a washing capability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a structure of a driving unit in a drum<br>
type washing machine that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a structure of driving unit in a drum type washing machine, in which the motor is coupled to the drum directly for reducing vibration, and either reducing a weight of the weight balancer or remove the weight balancer completely.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a structure of driving unit in a drum type washing machine, which can reduce waste of energy by employing a BLDC motor that has a good energy efficiency.<br>
Other object of the present invention is to provide a structure of driving unit in a drum type washing machine, which involves no deformation of the rotor even if the rotor rotates at a high speed.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a structure of driving unit in a drum type washing machine, which permits an easy assembly of the drum washing machine.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>

Referring to FIG. 2, the drum type washing machine in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a tub 2 of a metal inside of a cabinet(not shown) for storage of water, a drum 3 inside of the tub 2, a shaft 4 connected to the drum 3 for transmission of a driving force from a motor 5 to the drum 3, a front bearing 6a and a rear bearing 6b respectively fitted to outer circumferences of both ends of the shaft 4, a bearing housing 7 mounted to a rear wall 200 of the tub 2 for supporting the front and rear bearings, a rotor 13 mounted to a rear end of the shaft 4 to form a motor 5 together with a stator, the stator 14 on an inner side of the rotor 13 mounted to a rear wall 200 of the tub to form the motor -together with the rotor, and a connector 16 serration coupled to the shaft 4 at a rear side of the" rear bearing 6b and fastened to the rotor 13 for transmission of a rotating force from the rotor to the shaft 4. The bearing housing 7 is formed of a metal, preferably aluminum alloy. There is a hub 700 formed as one unit with the bearing housing 7 at a center thereof for fitting the front and<br>
rear bearings therein, and fastening bosses 701 formed on an outer side of the hub 700 at fixed intervals along a circumference for fastening the stator 14 to the bearing housing 7 with fastening members 15d such that the bearing housing 7 looks like a tripod in overall as shown in FIG. 3. In this instance, there is a step 8a and 8b formed in an inside circumference of the hub 700 on a central portion of the bearing housing 7 at each end of the hub 700 for supporting the front bearing 6a and the rear bearing 6b so that respective bearings are not fell off, but held therein. The step 8a in the front has a form of""]" for holding a rear end of the front bearing 6a, and the step 8b in the rear has a form of"[" for holding a front end of the rear bearing 6b. And, there are positioning steps 9a and 9b at front and rear circumferences of the shaft 4 for positioning the front bearing 6a and the rear bearing 6b on the shaft 4, respectively. The shaft 4 has a fore end held in a spider 10 in the rear wall of the drum 3, an exposed portion from a rear end of the spider 10 to the front bearing 6a having a bushing 11 of brass press fit thereon for prevention of rusting, with a sealing member 12 fitted on an outer circumference thereof for prevention of ingress of water, and a rear end having the rotor 13 of a direct coupling type motor 5 mounted on a center thereof. In this instance, a crown formed stator 14 is positioned on an inner side of the rotor 13, fastened to the fastening bosses 701 jon the bearing housing 7 to form the direct coupling type motor in combination with the rotor 13.<br>
In the meantime, referring to FIGS. 4 to 6, the rotor 13, formed of a magnetic material, such as iron or iron alloy, has a rear wall, a side wall, and permanent magnets provided on the side wall. There is a magnet setting surface 130, a bent part, extended from a periphery of the rear wall 13a and formed along a circumference thereof for supporting the magnets 13c fitted to an inside surface of the side wall 13b, reinforcing the rotor 13, serving as a back yoke that forms a magnetic flux path. And, there is a hub 132 at a center of the rear wall 13a having a through<br>
hole 131 for passing of a fastening member 15a for preventing fall off of the shaft 4 from the connector 16 fixed to the rotor. The rotor 13 is preferably formed by pressing. That is, the rotor 13 is formed by pressing as a unit both with the side wall 13b having the magnet setting surface and the rear wall 13a serving as a frame for supporting the side wall, without any separate additional fabrication process.<br>
In general, the drum washing machine may cause a problem of temperature rise owing to a load since the drum and laundry should be run fast together. Therefore, there are a plurality of cooling fins around the hub 132 of the rotor 13 as a unit with the rotor 13 in a radial direction for blowing air toward the stator 14 in rotation of the rotor 13 to cool down a heat generated at the stator 14. Each of the cooling fins 133 has a length in the radial direction. The cooling fin 133 is formed by lancing, to be bent at approx. 90° from the rear wall 13a to direct toward opening, to form an opening 134 which serves as a vent hole. Accordingly, formation of the cooling fin 133 and formation of the vent hole are done by one process, different from a case when the formation of the vent hole is done by punching, thereby permitting saving in material and working hours as no separate component and process for forming the cooling fin is required. And, different from BLDC motors used in VCR(Video Cassette Recorder) and the like, since the BLDC motor employed in the washing machine runs fast under a great load, a shape of the rotor is liable to deform during rotation of the rotor, which causes a non-uniform gap between the rotor and the stator. In order to eliminate this problem, there is an embossing 135 between every adjacent cooling fins 133 for reinforcing the rotor 13 together with the"foregoing setting surface 130. Moreover, there is a channel sectioned rim 13d at an end of the rotor for stiffening the end for maintaining a true circle even if the rotor 13 rotates at a high speed. And, there is a draining hole 136 in the embossing 135 for discharge of water. And, there are fastening<br>
holes 137 for fastening the connector 16 serration coupled to an outer circumference of the shaft 4 at a rear end thereof exposed at a rear of the rear bearing 6b and the positioning holes 138 for fixing a position of assembly of the connector 16, both of which are formed around the through hole 131 in the hub 132 of the rotor 13 at fixed intervals. The connector 16 is formed of a resin which has a vibration mode different from the body of the rotor 13 of iron or iron alloy, for attenuating a vibration occurred in rotation of the drum. The fastening hole 137 and the positioning hole 138 in the connector 16 have diameters different from each other.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2,8 and 9, the connector 16 has fastening holes 162 in correspondence to the fastening holes in the hub 132 of the rotor 13 along a circumference of a periphery thereof, and positioning projections between adjacent fastening holes 162 for automatic match between the fastening holes 137 in the rotor 13 and the fastening holes 162 in the connector 16 as the positioning projections 160 are inserted into the positioning holes 138 in the connector 13. And, there is serration 164 in an inside circumference of the hub 163 of the connector 16 matched to the serration 400 in the rear end of the shaft 4, and there are reinforcing ribs 161 on an outer side of the hub 163 of the connector 16 for reinforcing the hub 163.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2and 7, the stator 14, forming the motor 5 together with the rotor 13, includes a plurality of magnetic cores 145 each formed by stacking magnetic laminations each having a salient pole projected outward in a radial direction and a rib 143 projected inward in a radial direction, both of which are formed as one unit, frames 140 of insulating material for covering top. and bottom surfaces of a magnetic core assembly of the magnetic cores 145, and coils 142 wound around the salient poles of the magnetic cores.<br>
There are tub brackets 17 welded to an outer circumference of the tub 2 for fixing the bearing housing 7 at a rear portion of the tub, and fastening holes 170 at rear ends of the tub<br>
brackets 17 for passing of fastening members 15d fastened to the fastening holes 702 formed in<br>
an end portion of the bearing housing 7 in a radial direction.<br>
The operation of the aforementioned structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing<br>
machine in accordance wjth a first preferred embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
explained.<br>
Upon rotation of the rotor 13 as a current flows to the coils 142 of the stator 14 in a<br>
sequence under the control of a motor driving controller in a panel part(not shown), the shaft 4<br>
serration coupled to the connector 16 which is in turn connected to the rotor is rotated, to rotate<br>
the drum 3 as a power is transmitted to the drum through the shaft 4.<br>
The assembly process of the first embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type<br>
washing machine of the present invention will be explained.<br>
First, the drum 3 is placed inside of the tub 2. In this instance, the bushing 11 is press fit on an exposed portion of the shaft from rear of the spider 10 to the front bearing 6a for prevention of rusting of the shaft and the sealing member 12 is fitted on the bushing 11 for prevention of ingress of water toward the bearing. Then, the front bearing 6a is inserted on the shaft 4 in a state the drum 3 is placed inside of the tub 2. After insertion of the front bearing 6a, the bearing housing 7 is fixed to the rear of the tub as the fastening member 15d passes through the fastening hole 170 in the tub bracket 17 welded to outer circumference of the tub 2 and fastened to the fastening hole 702 in the bearing housing 7. After completion of mounting of the bearing housing 7 to the tub 2, the'rear bearing 6b is fitted to the rear end of the shaft 4. In this instance, the rear bearing 6b is held at the step 9b in rear portion of the shaft 4 and the step 8b inside of the bearing housing 7 at an end thereof. In this condition, after the fastening holes 143a in the fastening ribs 143 of the stator are aligned with the fastening bosses 701 on the bearing<br>
housing 7 on the outer side of the hub 700 at fixed intervals along a circumference, the stator is fastened to the fastening bosses 701 with the fastening members 15c, to fix the stator 14 to the bearing housing 7, firmly. Then, after an assembly of the rotor 13 and the connector 16, which assembly is done separately, is inserted onto the rear end of the shaft 4, the fastening member 15a is fastened, to prevent the connector 16 from falling off the shaft by a fastening force of the fastening member 15a.<br>
The assembly process of the rotor 13 and the connector 16 will be explained. First, the positioning holes 138 in the rotor 13 and the positioning projections 160 on the connector 16 are aligned, and the positioning projections 160 on the connector 16 are inserted into the positioning holes 138 in the rotor 13. In this temporary assembly when the positioning projections 160 on the connector 16 are merely inserted into the positioning holes 13 8 in the rotor 13, the fastening holes 137 in the rotor 13 and the fastening holes 162 in the connector 16 are aligned, under which condition, the fastening members 15b are fastened through the fastening holes 137 and 162, to assemble the rotor 13 and the connector 16 together.<br>
The operation of the structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention assembled thus will be explained.<br>
The bearing housing 7 of a metal, such as aluminum alloy, is applicable to the drum type washing machine which has a drying cycle since the bearing housing 7 shows no thermal deformation even at a high temperature. The tt~\" formed step 8a in the front, and the"[_" formed step 8b in the rear of the inside circumference of the bearing housing 7 hold a rear end of the front bearing 6a and a front end of the rear bearing 6b fitted on outer circumferences of the shaft 4 at both ends thereof, respectively. The positioning steps 9a and 9b in outer circumferences of a front portion and a rear portion of the shaft 4 permit to fix positions of the front bearing 6a and<br>
the rear bearing 6b with respect to the shaft 4. In the meantime, the front end of the shaft 4 is fixed in the spider 10 mounted to a rear wall of the drum 3, the exposed portion of the shaft from rear of the spider 10 to the front bearing 6a has the bushing 11 press fit thereon for prevention of rusting of the shaft, and the sealing member 12 is fitted on the bushing 11 for prevention of ingress of water toward the bearing. The fastening bosses 701 on the bearing housing 7 on the outer side of the hub 700 at fixed intervals along a circumference permits the stator 14 to be fastened to the fastening bosses 701 with the fastening members 15c, to fix the stator 14 to the bearing housing 7, firmly. And, the rotor 13 of the direct coupling type motor 5 is fixed to the rear end of the shaft 4, and the bent part having the magnet setting surface 30 formed along a circumference of the sidewall 13b extended forward from a periphery of the rear wall 13a of the rotor 13 supports the magnets 13c attached to the rotor 13, thereby permitting an easy fabrication of the rotor. The through hole 131 in the hub 132 at a center of the rear wall 13a of the rotor 13 permits to fasten the fastening members 15a, such as bolts, to the rear end of the shaft for prevention of falling of the shaft 4 off the rotor 13 and the connector 16 coupled to the rotor 13, and the plurality of cooling fins 133 formed around the hub 132 of the rotor 13 in a radial direction each with a length blow air toward the stator 14 when the rotor 13 is rotated, thereby cooling down the heat generated at the stator 14. The cooling fin 133 formed to direct the open side of the rotor 13 by lancing forms the through hole 134 which serves as a vent hole. The body of the rotor 13 formed of iron or iron alloy by pressing reduces a fabrication time period very much, to improve a productivity of the rotor. The embossing 135 between adjacent cooling fins 133 on the rear wall 13a of the rotor improve an overall strength of the rotor 13, and the draining hole 136 in the embossing 135 permits to discharge water. The fastening holes 137 for fastening the connector and the positioning holes 138 for fixing a position of assembly of the connector<br>
16, both of which are formed around the through hole 131 in the hub 132 of the rotor 13 permits to assemble the connector 16, serration coupled to the rear end of the shaft 4 exposed in rear of the rear bearing 6b, and the rotor 13 with easy. Once the positioning projections on the connector 16 are aligned with the positioning holes 138 in the rotor 13, the fastening holes 137 and 162 in both of the rotor 13 and the connector 16 are aligned automatically, through which the fastening members 15b are fastened, to assemble the connector 16 and the rotor 13 with easy. In this instance, the connector 16 of a resin injection molding has a vibration mode different from the same of the rotor 13 of iron or iron alloy, to attenuate the vibration from the rotor 13 to the shaft 4. The serration 164 on an inside circumference of the hub 163 of the connector 16 is fitted to the serration 400 on the rear end of the shaft 4, to transmit a rotation force from the rotor 13 to the shaft 4 as it is.

serration coupled to the connector 16 which is in turn connected to the rotor, is rotated, to rotate<br>
the drum 3 as a power is transmitted to the drum through the shaft 4.<br>
The assembly process of the fourth embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type<br>
washing machine of the present invention will be explained.<br>
First, the front bearing 6a is inserted onto the shaft 4 in a condition the drum 3 having the shaft 4 fixed to the spider 10 at a rear of the drum 3 is assembled inside of the tub 1. According to this, the front bearing 6a inserted onto the outer circumference of the shaft 4 is fixed at the front bearing 6a is held both at the step 9a in a front portion of the shaft 4 and the step 202 in the hub 200 of the tub 2. Then, under a condition that the fastening holes 203 for fastening the supporting bracket formed in the hub 201 of the tub 2 and the fastening holes 801 in the supporting bracket 8 are aligned, the fastening members 15d are fastened, to fix the supporting bracket 8 to the hub 201 of the tub 2. After assembly of the supporting bracket 8 to the tub 2, the rear bearing 6b is inserted onto the shaft 4 through the rear end of the shaft 4 until the rear bearing 6b is held both at the step 9b in a rear portion of the shaft 4 and the step 800 in an inside end of the supporting bracket 8. Then, the fastening holes 802 in the periphery of the supporting bracket 8 and the fastening holes 143a in the fastening rib 143 of the stator 14 are aligned, and fastened with the fastening members 15c. Under this condition, an assembly of the rotor 13 and the connector 16 are inserted into the rear end of the shaft 4, and the fastening member 15a is screwed into the rear end of the shaft, for preventing the connector 16 from falling off the shaft by a fastening force of the fastening member 15a, thereby fixing the stator 14 to the supporting bracket 8.<br>
The operation of the structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine in accordance with a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained.<br>
In the fourth embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine of the present invention, since the supporting bracket 8 is formed of a metal, such as aluminum alloy, which is involved in no thermal deformation even at a high temperature, the supporting bracket 8 is applicable to the drum type washing machine which has a drying cycle. That is, the<br>
step 800 in an inside end of the supporting bracket 8 in the fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention permits to support the front end of the rear bearing 6b. And, the positioning steps 9a and 9b in outer circumferences of front and rear portions of the shaft 4 disposed inside of the supporting bracket 8 for transmission of a driving force from the motor 5 to the drum 3 permit easy positioning of the front and rear bearings 6a and 6b with respect to the shaft 4. In the meantime, the front end of the shaft 4 is fixed to the spider 10 in the rear wall of the drum 3, and a portion of the shaft 4 from an end of the spider 10 to the front bearing 6a has a bushing<br>
11	of brass press fit thereon, for prevention of rusting of the shaft 4. And, the sealing member<br>
12	on an outer circumference of the bushing 11 prevents ingress of water into the bearing. The<br>
fastening holes 802 in the periphery of the supporting bracket 8 at fixed intervals along a<br>
circumference permit the fastening members 15c passed through the fastening holes 143a in the<br>
fastening ribs 143 on the stator 14 to pass through the fastening holes 802 in the supporting<br>
bracket, thereby permitting the stator 14 fixed to the supporting bracket 8, firmly.  As the<br>
serration 164 on the inside circumference of the hub 201 of the connector 16 is fitted to the<br>
serration 400 on the rear end of the shaft 4, a rotation force can be transmitted from the rotor 13<br>
to the shaft 4 through the connector 1.6 as it is. Since the supporting bracket 8 is fastened to the<br>
hub 201 projected forward from a central portion of the rear wall 200 of the tub in a face to face<br>
contact, and the stator 14 is fixed to the supporting bracket 8, a distance from the rear wall 200<br>
of the tub to the stator 14 is very close, which permits to minimize a distance from the rear wall<br>
200 of the tub to the rear wall 13a of the rotor, that permits to provide a compact product.<br>

And, the second embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine can prevent ingress of water dropped from the water supply valve 25 into the motor by means of the arc formed baffle on an upper portion of the bearing housing, thereby assuring a motor reliability.<br>
And, the third embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine permits assembly of the stator with easy when the stator is mounted to the rear of the bearing housing owing to the self alignment action of the ribs.<br>
And, the fourth embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine can also reduce noise, trouble from being out of order, and a power loss as it is of the motor direct coupling type.<br>
And, the fourth embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine can be applied to a product with a dry function as the supporting bracket of a metal shows no thermal deformation.<br>
And, the fourth embodiment structure of a driving unit in a drum type washing machine can prevent ingress of water dropped from the water supply valve into the motor 5 by means of the arc formed baffle provided at a rear of the tub, thereby assuring a reliability of the motor.<br>
