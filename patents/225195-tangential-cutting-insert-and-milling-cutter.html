				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to a tangential cutting insert and<br>
a milling cutter for metal cutting operations for milling complex profiles such as for<br>
milling crankshafts with an annular internal-milling cutter.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Such milling cutters typically comprise an amular cutter body having a<br>
plurality of identical segments equally spaced about the inner circumference of the<br>
cutter body. Each segment having typically three or more cutting inserts secured to<br>
it, with each cutting insert intended to mill a particular feature of the complex<br>
profile. Inevitably, at least one of the cutting inserts of each segment has a different<br>
geometry from the other cutting inserts of that segment consequently, a stock of at<br>
least two types of cutting inserts has to be kept and care has to be taken when<br>
replacing a worn cutting insert of a segment not to replace it by<br>
a cutting insert of a different geometry.<br>
In many such milling cutters, tangential cutting inserts are<br>
used. Tangential cutting inserts* also known as on-edge, or lay<br>
down, cutting inserts, are oriented in an insert holder in such a<br>
manner that during a cutting operation on a workpiece the cutting<br>
forces are directed along a major (thicker) dimension of the<br>
cutting insert. An advamtage of such an arrangement being that<br>
the cutting insert can withstand greater cutting forces than when<br>
oriented in such a manner that the cutting forces are directed<br>
along a minor (thinner) dimension of the cutting insert.<br>
US 6,273,651 discloses a cutting insert which has a<br>
generally parallelpipedal body formed with a pair of generally<br>
rectangular, planar, and parallel side faces, a mounting<br>
formation at at least one of the side faces, a pair of opposite<br>
edge faces between the side faces and each forming at each end of<br>
the body a cutting face bounded by a cutting edge, and a<br>
respective pair of at least partially circularly arcuately<br>
concave free faces at each end extending between the respective<br>
cutting edges. The cutting edges are arcuate and each cutting<br>
edge has a convex part and straight or concave part.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Attention is drawn to Figs. 1 to 7 of the drawings showing a double-sided<br>
tangential cutting insert 20 in accordance with the present invention. The cutting<br>
insert 20 is typically made of extremely hard and wear-resistant material such as<br>
cemented carbide, either by form-pressing and sintering carbide powders in a binder<br>
or by powder injection molding methods. The cutting insert 20 comprises identical<br>
opposing end surfaces 22, 24 and a peripheral side surface 26 extending between the<br>
end surfaces 22, 24. A median plane M divides the cutting insert 20 into two equal<br>
halves, with the two end surfaces 22 ,24 located on opposite sides of the median plane<br>
M. The cutting insert 20 possesses minor (or reflection) symmetry about the median<br>
plane M. During a cutting operation, only one of the end surfaces 22, referred to as<br>
the operative end surface 22, participates in the cutting operation. Since the two end<br>
surfaces 22, 24 are identical, only one of them, namely the operative end surface 22,<br>
will be described in detail (the opposing end surface will be referred to as the non-<br>
operative end surface 24).<br>
The peripheral side surface 26 intersects the end surfaces 22, 24 at<br>
peripheral edges 28, 30. The peripheral side surface 26 comprises first and second,<br>
generally planar and parallel, opposing major side surfaces 32, 34 and first and second<br>
opposing minor side surfaces 36, 38 extending between the major side surfaces 32, 34.<br>
Adjacent major and minor side surfaces merge at common corner side surfaces. The<br>
first major side surface 32 merges with the first minor side surface 36 at a first corner<br>
side surface 40. The first minor side surface 36 merges with the second major side<br>
surface 34 at a second comer side surface 42. The second major side surface 34<br>
merges with the second minor side surface 38 at a third comer side surface 44 and the<br>
second minor side surface 38 merges with the first major side surface 32 at a fourth<br>
comer side surface 46. Each minor side surface is divided into two component minor<br>
side surfaces. The first minor side surface 36 comprises first and second component<br>
first minor side surfaces 48, 50 merging at a first component corner side surface 52.<br>
The second minor side surface 38 comprises first and second component second<br>
minor side surfaces 54, 56 merging at a second component comer side surface 58. The<br>
first component fast minor side surface 48 and the first component second minor side<br>
surface 54 are adjacent the first major side surface 32, whereas the second component<br>
first minor side surface 50 and the second component second minor side surface 56<br>
are adjacent the second major side surface 34.<br>
A through bore 60, having an axis A which lies in the median plane M,<br>
passes through the peripheral side surface 26, extending between the first and second<br>
major side surfaces 32, 34. A groove 62 in the peripheral side surface 26 extends<br>
between the opposing end surfaces 22, 24. The groove 62, which is intersected by the<br>
through bore 60, is straight and perpendicular to the median plane M of the cutting<br>
insert 20.<br>
The peripheral edge 28 comprises two component edges, a secondary edge<br>
64 and a primary edge 66. The secondary edge 64 is formed at the intersection of the<br>
groove 62 and the operative end surface 22, and the primary edge 66 is the whole of<br>
the peripheral edge 28 apart from the secondary edge 64. The primary edge 66<br>
comprises fust and second major edges 68, 70, formed at the intersection of the first<br>
and second major side surfaces 32, 34 with the operative end surface 22, respectively;<br>
first and second minor edges 72, 74, formed at the intersection of the first and second<br>
minor side surfaces 36, 38 with the operative end surface 22, respectively; and first,<br>
second, third and fourth corner edges 76, 78, 80, 82, formed at the intersection of the<br>
first, second, third and fourth comer side surfaces 40, 42, 44, 46 with the operative<br>
end surface 22, respectively. The first minor edge 72 comprises a first component first<br>
minor edge 84, a second component first minor edge 86 and a first component comer<br>
edge 88, formed at the intersection of the first component first minor side surface 48,<br>
the second component first minor side surface 50 and the first component corner side<br>
surface 52 with the operative end surface 22, respectively. Similarly, the second minor<br>
edge 74 comprises a first component second minor edge 90, a second component<br>
second minor edge 92 and a second component comer edge 94, formed at the<br>
intersection of the first component second minor side surface 54, the second<br>
component second minor side surface 56 and the second component corner side<br>
surface 58 with the operative end surface 22, respectively.<br>
The operative end surface 22 comprises a peripheral surface portion 96<br>
sloping inwardly from the peripheral edge 28 towards the median plane M and<br>
merging with a central surface portion 98 of the operative end surface 22. The<br>
peripheral edge 28 forms a cutting edge and the peripheral surface portion 96 forms an<br>
associated chip rake surface. Consequently, any section of the peripheral edge 28<br>
forms a cutting edge and therefore any such section will be referred to herein either as<br>
an edge or a cutting edge.<br>
With reference to Fig. 6, it is noted that in a side view of the cutting insert<br>
20 taken perpendicular to the second major side surface 34, also referred to herein as a<br>
first side view of the cutting insert 20, the second component first minor cutting 86,<br>
the second comer edge 78, the second major edge 70, the third corner edge 80, the<br>
second component second minor edge 92 and the second component corner edge 94<br>
form a generally concave edge portion C of the peripheral edge 28. In other words, in<br>
the first side view the peripheral edge 28 is generally concave. The structure of this<br>
generally concave edge portion C is as follows. The second component first minor<br>
cutting 86 extends from the first component corner edge 88 sloping towards the<br>
median plane M and merges with the second comer edge 78. The second corner edge<br>
78 extends from the second component first minor cutting 86 sloping towards the<br>
median plane and merges with the second major edge 70. The second major edge 70<br>
extends from the second comer edge 78 sloping towards the median plane M and<br>
merges with the third comer edge 80 at a region of join 100. The region of join 100<br>
contains a point Q which is the point on the concave edge portion C closest to the<br>
median plane M, also referred to as the minimum point Q, with respect to the median<br>
plane M. Around the region of join 100, the peripheral edge 28 is parallel to the<br>
median plane M. The third corner edge 80 extends from the region of join 100<br>
sloping away from the median plane M and merges with the second component<br>
second minor edge 92. The second component second minor edge 92 extends from<br>
the third comer edge 80 sloping away from the median plane M and merges with the<br>
second component corner edge 94. In the first view, the first and second component<br>
comer edges 88,94 form first and second end points XI, X2 of the generally concave<br>
edge portion C, with the second end point X2 being closer to the median plane M than<br>
the first end point XI.<br>
In the first side view, the cutting insert 20 is bounded by the first<br>
component comer side surface 52 on one side and the second component comer side<br>
surface 58 on the other side, the first and second component coiner side surfaces 52,<br>
58 thereby defining first and second bounding lines H1, H2 of the cutting insert 20.<br>
Hie minimum point Q on the generally concave edge portion C of the peripheral edge<br>
28 is closer to the second bounding line H2 than to the first bounding line H1.<br>
Therefore, in the first side view, the generally concave edge portion C is non-<br>
symmetric about the minimum point Q. It is also seen that in the side view of me<br>
cutting insert 20 taken perpendicular to the second major side surface 34, the cutting<br>
insert 20 has three characteristic lengths measured between the peripheral edges 28 of<br>
the opposing end surfaces 22. A maximum length L1, measured between the first<br>
component comer edges 38 (therefore L1 defines a maximum length of the first minor<br>
side surface 36), an intermediate length L2 measured between the second component<br>
comer edges 94 (therefore L2 defines a maximum length of the second minor side<br>
surface 38) and a minimum length 13, measured between the minimum points Q on<br>
the peripheral edges 28. Clearly, the maximum length L1 is greater than the<br>
intermediate length L2 which in turn is greater than the minimum length L3. The<br>
difference in lengths between the first and second minor side surface 36, 38, can also<br>
be clearly seen in Fig. 5 where, due to the fact that the maximum length of the second<br>
minor side surface 38 is smaller than the maximum length of the first minor side<br>
surface 36, portions of both the operative end surface 22 and the opposing non-<br>
operative end surface 24 can be seen.<br>
With reference to Fig. 7, it is noted that in a side view of the cutting insert<br>
20 taken perpendicular to the first major side surface 32, also referred to herein as a<br>
second side view of the cutting insert 20, the fourth comer edge 82, the fast major<br>
edge 68, the secondary edge 64 and the first comer edge 76 form a generally concave<br>
edge portion S of me peripheral edge 28. In other words, in the second side view the<br>
peripheral edge 28 is generally concave. When comparing the generally concave edge<br>
portion S of the peripheral edge 28 in the second side view with the generally concave<br>
edge portion C of the peripheral edge 28 in the first side view it is noted that the later<br>
is slightly recessed at a central region thereof, the recess being formed by the<br>
secondary edge 64.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3, it can be seen that in an end view of the cutting<br>
insert 20, the second component first minor edge 86 makes a first angle a1 with the<br>
second major edge 70 and the second component second minor edge 92 makes a<br>
second angle a2 with the second major edge 70. The first component second minor<br>
edge 90 makes a third angle a3 with a line N normal to a continuation line of the<br>
second major edge 70 and the first component first minor edge 84 is perpendicular to<br>
the continuation line of the second major edge 70. The secondary edge 64 comprises<br>
three component edges, an inner secondary edge 64' and two outer secondary edges<br>
64" extending from either end of the inner secondary edge 64' to the first major edge<br>
68, with each outer secondary edge 64" making an obtuse angle with the inner<br>
secondary edge 64'. The first major edge 68, comprises two straight line portions,<br>
interrupted by the groove 62, parallel to me second major edge 70, in the end view.<br>
With reference to Fig. 4, it is noted that in a third side view of the cutting<br>
insert 20, the second component first minor edge 86 extends from the second corner<br>
edge 78 to the first component corner edge 88 sloping away from the median plane<br>
M. Similarly, with reference to Fig. 5, it is noted that in a fourth side view of the<br>
cutting insert 20, the second component second minor edge 92 extends from the third<br>
corner edge 80 to the second component corner edge 94 sloping away from the<br>
median plane M. As can be seen in the figures, the through bore 60 can be seen in the<br>
first and second side views but not in the third and fourth side views.<br>
As will be described herein below with reference to Figs. 8 to 14, the<br>
above described geometrical properties of the cutting insert 20 enable it to mill all the<br>
features of a complex profile for which it is designed. Fig. 8 shows an annular<br>
internal nulling cutter 102 comprising nine segments 104, each segment 104 Having<br>
seven cutting inserts 20 secured thereto. Fig. 9 shows a section of a crankshaft 106<br>
after being milled by the milling cutter 102 and Fig. 10 shows in cross section the<br>
features milled. These features are the cheeks 108, mini-cheek 110 midway between<br>
the cheeks 108, two 90Q sections 112 (that is, at 90° to the cheeks 108) between the<br>
mini-cheek 110 and the cheeks 108 and two 45° sections 114 adjacent the cheeks 108<br>
and the 90° sections 112. The mini-cheek 108 comprises an upper straight section 116<br>
that merges with two corner sections 118 and two 30° sections 120 (mat is, at 30° to<br>
the cheeks 108) extending from the corner sections to the 90° section 112.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a cross section of the crankshaft 106 similar to that shown in<br>
Fig. 10, but before the crankshaft 106 is milled. The continuous line represents the<br>
above-mentioned features before the crankshaft 106 is milled and the dashed line<br>
adjacent the continuous line shows the milled surface as in Fig. 10. The pre-milled<br>
features being, pre-milled cheeks 108', pre-milled mini-cheek 110 (pre-milled upper<br>
section 116', pre-milled comer sections 118, pre-milled 30° sections 120') pre-milled<br>
90° sections 112' and pre-milled two 45° sections 114'. It will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art that the crankshaft 106, as well as crankshafts in general, are<br>
milled in a number of stages. The milling process as described herein and as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 11, represents only one intermediate stage of a number of stages<br>
required in order to fully mill the crankshaft 106.<br>
Attention is no drawn to Figs. 12 to 14 showing one segment 104. The<br>
segment 104 has seven cutting inserts 20 secured to it by means of clamping screws<br>
122 and arranged in three pairs of cuttind inserts and a single unpaired cutting insert.<br>
A first pair comprises two extreme outer cutting inserts 20a located on opposing side<br>
faces 124 of the segment 104. A second pair comprises two outer cutting inserts 20b<br>
located on the inner face 126 of the segment 104 with one of the outer cutting inserts<br>
20b adjacent one side face 124 and the other outer cutting insert 20b adjacent the<br>
opposing side face 124. A third pair comprises two inner cutting inserts 20c located<br>
adjacent a median plane P of the segment 104 on either side thereof. The single<br>
unpaired cutting insert is a central cutting insert 20d located substantially midway<br>
between the two side faces 124. The central cutting insert 20d is secured to the<br>
segment 104 with its groove 36 facing away from the segment 104, whereas each of<br>
the extreme outer cutting inserts 20a, the outer cutting inserts 20b and the inner<br>
cutting inserts 20c is secured to the segment 104 with its groove 36 facing towards the<br>
segment 104.<br>
When milling the crankshaft 106, the cutting inserts 20a, 20b, 20c, 20d of<br>
each segment 104 operate on given sections of the crankshaft 106. The two extreme<br>
outer cutting inserts 20a mill the cheeks 108', the 45° sections 114' and a portion of<br>
the 90° section 112' adjacent the 45° section 112'. The two outer cutting inserts 20b<br>
mill the 45° sections and a portion of the 90° section 112' adjacent the 45a section<br>
114' extending to approximately half way along the 90° section. The two inner cutting<br>
inserts 20c mill the 30° sections 120' and a portion of the 90° section 112' adjacent the<br>
30° section 120' extending to approximately half way along the 90° section, and the<br>
central cutting insert 20d mills the upper section 116 and the corner sections 118 of<br>
the mini-cheek 110. It will be appreciated mat the way in which the cutting edges<br>
slope relative to the median plane M provides mem with an inherent positive axial<br>
rake, thereby making the cutting process more efficient.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain degree of<br>
particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and modifications<br>
could be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as<br>
hereinafter claimed.<br>
