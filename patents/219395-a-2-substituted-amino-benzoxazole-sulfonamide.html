				<td>BROADSPECTRUM2-rSUBSTITUTED-AMINO)-BENZOXAZQLE SULFONAMIDE HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to 2-(substituted-amino)-benzoxazole sulfonamides, their use as aspartic protease inhibitor^ in particular as broadspectrum HIV protease inhibitors, processes for their preparation as well as pharmaceutical compositions and diagnostic kits comprising them. The present invention also concerns combinations of the present 2-(substituted-amino)-benzoxazole sulfonamides with another anti-retroviral agent. It further relates to their use in/assays as reference compounds or as reagents.<br>
The virus causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is known by different names, including T~lymphocyte virus IE (HTLV-IH) or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) or AIDS-related virus (ARV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Up until now, two distinct families have been identified, i.e. HTV-1 and HJV-2. Hereinafter, HTV will be used to generically denote these viruses.<br>
One of the critical pathways in a retroviral life cycle is the processing of polyprotein precursors by aspartic protease. For instance with the HTV virus the gag-pol protein is processed by HIV protease. The correct processing of the precursor polyproteins by the aspartic protease is required for the assembly of infectious virions, thus making the aspartic protease an attractive target for antiviral therapy, hi particular for HIV treatment, the HIV protease is an attractive target.<br>
HIV protease inhibitors (Pis) are commonly administered to ADDS patients in combination with other anti-HTV compounds such as, for instance nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs) or other protease inhibitors. Despite the fact that these antiretrovirals are very useful, they have a common Limitation, namely, the targeted enzymes in the HTV virus are able to mutate in such a way that the known drugs become less effective, or even ineffective against these mutant HIV viruses. Or, in other words, the HTV virus creates an ever increasing resistance against the available drugs.<br>
Resistance of retro viruses, and in particular the HTV virus, against inhibitors is a major cause of therapy failure. For instance, half of the patients receiving anti-HTV combination therapy do not respond fully to the treatment, mainly because of resistance of the virus to one or more drugs used. Moreover, it has been shown that resistant virus is earned over to newly infected individuals, resulting in severely limited therapy options for these drag-naive patients. Therefore, there is a need in the art for new<br>
compounds for retrovirus therapy, more particularly for AIDS therapy. The need in the art is particularly acute for compounds that are active not only on wild type HTV virus, but also on the increasingly more common resistant HIV viruses.<br>
Known antiretrovirals, often administered in a combination therapy regimen, will eventually cause resistance as stated above. This often may force the physician to boost the plasma levels of the active drags hi order for said antiretrovirals to regain effectivity against the mutated HTV viruses. The consequence of which is a highly undesirable increase hi pill burden. Boosting plasma levels may also lead to an increased risk of non-compliance with the prescribed therapy. Thus, it is not only important to have compounds showing activity for a wide range of HTV mutants, it is also important that there is little or no variance in the ratio between activity against mutant HIV virus and activity against wild type HTV virus (also defined as fold resistance or FR) over a broad range of mutant HIV strains. As such, a patient may remain on the same combination therapy regimen for a longer period of time since the chance that a mutant HTV virus will be sensitive to the active ingredients will be increased.<br>
Finding compounds with a high potency on the wild type and on a wide variety of mutants is also of importance since the pill burden can be reduced if therapeutic levels are kept to a minimum. One way of reducing this pill burden is finding anti-HTV compounds with good bio availability, i.e. a favorable pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile, such that the daily dose can be minimized and consequently also the number of pills to be taken.<br>
Another important characteristic of a good anti-HTV compound is that plasma protein binding of the inhibitor has minimal or even no effect on its potency.<br>
Thus, there is a high medical need for protease inhibitors that are able to combat a broad spectrum of mutants of the HTV virus with little variance in fold resistance, have a good bioavailability and experience little or no effect on their potency due to plasma protein binding.<br>
Up until now, several protease inhibitors are on the market or are being developed. One particular core structure (depicted below) has been disclosed in a number of references, such as, WO 95/06030, WO 96/22287, WO 96/28418, WO 96/28463, WO 96/28464. WO 96/28465 and WO 97/18205. The compounds disclosed therein are described as retro viral protease inhibitors.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
WO 99/67254 discloses 4-substituted-phenyl sulfonamides capable of inhibiting multi-drug resistant retroviral proteases.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Surprisingly, the 2-(substituted-amino)-benzoxazole sulfonamides of the present invention are found to have a favorable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile. Not only are they active against wild-type HIV virus, but they also show a broadspectrum activity against various mutant HTV viruses exhibiting resistance against known protease inhibitors.<br>

The term "prodrug" as used throughout this text means the pharmacologically acceptable derivatives such as esters, amides and phosphates, such that the resulting in vivo biotransformation product of the derivative is the active drug as defined in the compounds of formula (I). The reference by Goodman and Oilman (The PharmacoloÂ­gical Basis of Therapeutics, 8th ed, McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, 'Biotransformation of<br>
Drags", p 13-15) describing prodrugs generally is hereby incorporated. Prodrugs of a compound of the present invention are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxy group, for instance the hydroxy group on the asymmetric carbon atom, or an amino group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a patient, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl or free amino, respectively.<br>
Typical examples of prodrugs are described for instance in WO 99/33795,<br>
WO 99/33815, WO 99/33793 and WO 99/33792 all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Prodrugs are characterized by excellent aqueous solubility, increased bioavailability and are readily metabolized into the active inhibitors in vivo.<br>
For therapeutic use, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable. However, salts having a pharmaceutically unacceptable counterion may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound of formula (I). All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically tolerable addition salt forms which the compounds of the present invention are able to form can conveniently be prepared using the appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohaiic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric; nitric; phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methane-sulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, ^-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, ^-aminosalicylic, pamoic .and the like acids.<br>
Conversely said acid addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt form by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the<br>
ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the<br>
benzathine, N-methyl, -D-glucamine3 hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the Hke.<br>
Conversely said base addition salt forms can be converted, by treatment with an appropriate acid into the free acid form.<br>
The term "salts" also comprises the hydrates and the solvent addition forms which the compounds of the present invention are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
The N-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called jV-oxide.<br>
The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms. Such forms, although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The term stereochemically isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as used hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or in admixture with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Pure stereoisomenc forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are -defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term 'stereoisomerically pure' concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomenc excess of at least 80% (i. e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomenc excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomenc excess of 90% up to 100%, -even more in particular having a stereoisomenc excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomenc excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms 'enantiomerically pure1 and<br>
'diastereomerically pure' should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess of the mixture in question.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids. Alternatively, enantiomers maybe separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The diastereomeric racemates of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods which may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromato graphy.<br>
It is clear to a person skilled in the art that the compounds of formula (I) contain at least one asymmetric center and thus may exist as different stereoisomeric forms. This asymmetric center is indicated with a asterisk (*) in the figure below. <br>

The formulations described therein are particularly suitable for oral administration and comprise an antifungal as active ingredient, a sufficient amount of a cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof as a splubilizer, an aqueous acidic medium as bulk liquid carrier and an alcoholic co-solvent that greatly simplifies the preparation of the composition. Sajd formulations may also be rendered more palatable by adding pharmaceutically acceptable sweeteners and/or flavors.<br>
Other convenient ways to enhance the solubility of the compounds of the present<br>
invention in pharmaceutical compositions are described in WO 94/05263,<br>
WO 98/42318, EP-A-499,299 and WO 97/44014, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
More in particular, the present compounds may be formulated in a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of particles consisting of a<br>
solid dispersion comprising (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) one or more<br>
â€¢ pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.	j<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liqijjid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, wherein one component is dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components. Wljien said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermo-i dynamics, such a solid dispersion is referred to as "a solid solution". Solid solutiotLS are<br>
preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavailable to the organisms to which they are administered.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions which are less homogenous throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physicall^ uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase.<br>
The water-soluble polymer in the particles is conveniently a polymer that has an apparent viscosity of 1 to 100 mPa.s when dissolved in a 2 % aqueous solution at ^0Â°C<br>
4<br>
solution.<br>
Preferred water-soluble polymers are hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses or HPMC. HPMC having a methoxy degree of substitution from about 0.8 to about 2.5 and a hydroxypropyl molar substitution from about 0,05 to about 3.0 are generally water soluble. Methoxy degree of substitution refers to the average number of methyl ethjer groups present per anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxy-propyl molar substitution refers to the average number of moles of propylene oxide which! have reacted with each anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule.<br>
The particles as defined hereinabove can be prepared by first preparing a solid dispersion of the components, and then optionally grinding or milling that dispersiojn. Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions inchiding melt-extrusion, spray-drying and solution-evaporation, melt-extrusion being preferred.<br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the present compounds hi the form of      j nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nnji.. Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those which physically adhere to tfaje surface of the antrretrovrral agent hut do not chemically bond to the antiretroviral agent.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the present compounds involves a pharmja-ceutical composition whereby the present compounds are incorporated in hydrophilip polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads, thus yielding<br>
a composition with good bioavailabiKty which can conveniently be manufactured which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral adrninistratiojn.<br>
Said beads comprise (a) a central, rounded or spherical core, (b) a coating film of | hydrophilic polymer and an antiretroviral agent and (c) a seal-coating polymer lay^r.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention concerns a kit or container comprising a compound of formula (I) in an amount effective for use as a standard or reagent inj a test or assay for determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit Hly protease, HIV growth, or both. This aspect of the invention may find its use in pharmaceutical research programs.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in phenotypic resistance monitoring assays, such as known recombinant assays, in the clinical management! of resistance developing diseases such as HIV. A particularly useful resistance         | monitoring system is a recombinant assay known as the Antivirogramâ„¢. The Antivirogramâ„¢ is a highly automated, high throughput, second generation, recombinant assay that can measure susceptibility, especially viral susceptibility, t<b the compounds of present invention. k de bethune mp miller v et al. antimicrob agents chemother incorporated by reference></b>
The compounds of the present invention may also be linked to maleimide or derivatives thereof to form conjugates.<br>
The dose of the present compounds or of the physiologically tolerable salt(s) thereof to be administered depends on the individual case and, as customary, is to be adapted! to the conditions of the individual case for an optimum effect. Thus it depends, of course, on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the compounds employed in each case for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature and severity of the infection and symptoms, and on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated and on whether the therapy is Â£.cute or prophylactic. Customarily, the daily dose of a compound of formula (I) in the c0.se of administration to a patient approximately 75 kg in weight is 1 mg to 3g, suitably! 1 mg to 1 g. preferably 3 mg to 0.5 g, more preferably 5 mg to 300 mg. The dose can be<br>
administered in the form of an individual dose, or divided into several, e.g. two, three, or four, individual doses.<br>

Antiviral analyses:<br>
The compounds of the present invention were examined for anti-viral activity in a cellular assay. The assay demonstrated that these compounds exhibited potent antj-HTv acti^dty against a wild type laboratory HIV strain (B3V-1 strain LAI). The cejilular assay was performed according to the following procedure.<br>
Cellular Assay Experimental Method:<br>
HIV- or mock-infected MT4 cells were incubated for five days in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitor. At the end of the incubation period, all HIJV-infected cells have been killed by the replicating virus in the control cultures in th^ absence of any inhibitor. Cell viability- is measured by measuring the concenrratiojn- of MTT, a yellow, water soluble tetrazolium dye that is converted to a purple, water insoluble formazan in the mitochondria of living cells only. Upon solubilization ojf the resulting formazan crystals with isopropanol, the absorbance of the solution is monitored at 540nm. The values correlate directly to the number of living cells remaining in the culture at the completion of the five day incubation. The inhibitory activity of the compound was monitored on the virus-infected cells and was expressed as ECso and ECgo- These values represent the amount of the compound required to| protect 50% and 90%, respectively, of the cells from the cytopathogenic effect of tjie virus. The toxicity of the compound was measured on the mock-infected cells and I was expressed as CCso, which represents the concentration of compound required to inhibit the growth of the cells by 50%. The selectivity index (SI) (ratio CCso/ECso) is an indication of the selectivity of the anti-HIV activity of the inhibitor. Wherever results are reported as e.g. pECso Â°r pCCjo values, the result is expressed as the negative logarithm of the result expressed as ECso Â°r CCso respectively.<br>
Antiviral spectrum:<br>
Because of the increasing emergence of drug resistant HIV strains, the present compounds were tested for their potency against clinically isolated HIV strains harboring several mutations (Table 2 and 3). These mutations are associated with resistance to protease inhibitors and result in viruses that show various degrees of phenotypic cross-resistance to the currently commercially available drugs such as fb|r instance saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir and amprenavir.<br>

Caco-2 permeability assay for intestinal absorption<br>
The permeability of different compounds is evaluated according to a Caco-2 test protocol as described by Augustijns et al. (Augustijns et al. (1998). Int. J. ofPharni, 166, 45-54) whereby, Caco-2 cells at cell passage number between 32 and 45 are grown in 24-well transwell cell culture plates for 21 to 25 days. The integrity of thd cell monolayer is checked by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)L The test is performed at pH 7.4 and at 100 uM donor compound concentration.<br>
Aqueous solubility at different pH levels<br>
The equilibrium solubility in simulated gastrointestirial solutions under thermodynajnaic conditions is a good measure for the solubility profile of the compound in the stomach and the different parts of the intestine. Simulated gastric fluid (SGF) (without pepsin) is set at pH of 1.5. Simulated intestinal fluids (SIF) (without bile salts) are set at pH 5sj pH 6.5, pH 7 and pH 7.5. The experimental protocol uses 96-well flat-bottom microplalfes in which 1 mg of compound is added per well (stock solution in methanol) and evaporated to dryness. The compounds are resolubilized in SGF and SIF and incubated overnight on a horizontal shaking device at 37Â°C. After filtration, fee compound concentrations are determined by UV-spectrophotometry.<br>
Oral availability in the rat<br>
'<br>
The compounds are formulated as a 20 mg/ml solution or suspension in DMSO, PEG400 or cyclodextin 40% in water. For most experiments in the rat (mal-e and fenjiale rats), three dosing groups are formed: II single intraperitoneal (IP) dose at 20 mg/kg. using the DMSO formulation; 21 single oral dose at 20 mg/kg using the PEG400 formulation and 3/ single oral dose at 20 mg/kg using the cyclodextrin formulation. Blood is sampled at regular time intervals after dosing and drug concentrations in<br>
serum are determined using a LC-MS bio analytical method. Serum concentratioip are expressed in ng/mg after normalization to 10 mg/kg. Serum concentration at 30 minutes (30') and at 3 hours (180') can be determined as these values reflect the Extent of absorption (30') and the speed of elimination (ISO')- The rat serum concentration at 30 min and 180 min following IP administration of 20 mg/kg of compound 4 are J1098 ng/ml and 553 ng/ml respectively.<br>
Boosting the systemic bioavailability<br>
With the described type of compounds (protease-inhibitors), it is known that inhibition of the metabolic degradation processes can markedly increase the systemic availability by reducing the first-pass metabolism in the liver and the metabolic clearance froija the plasma This 'boosting' principle can be applied in a clinical setting to the pharmacological action of the drug. This principle can be also explored both in thfc rat or the dog by simultaneous administration of a compound that inhibits the Cyt-p4$O metabolic enzymes. Known blockers are for example ritonavir and ketoconazole.j Dosing a single oral dose of ritonvir at 5 mg'kg in the rat and the dog may result iji an increase of the systemic availability.<br>
Protein Binding analyses:<br>
Human serum proteins like albumin (HSA) or a-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) are kriovra to bind many drugs, resulting in a possible decrease in the effectiveness of those compounds. In order to determine whether the present compounds would be adversely affected by this binding, the anti-HTV activity of the compounds was measured in jhe presence of human serum, thus evaluating the effect of the binding of the protease inhibitors to those proteins.<br>
MT4 cells are infected with HTV-1 LAI at a multiplicity of infection (MOT) of 0.001-0.01 CCIDso (50% cell culture infective dose per cell, CCED5o). After 1 h incubation, cells are washed and plated into a 96 well plate containing serial dilutions of the compound in the presence of 10% PCS (foetal calf serum), 10% PCS + 1 mg/ml AAG (cci-acid glycoprotein), 10% PCS + 45 mg/ml HSA (human serum albumin) or 50% human serum (HS). After 5 or 6 days incubation, the BCso (50% effective concentration in cell-based assays) is calculated by determining the cell viability or by quantifyinjg the level of HIV replication. Cell viability is measured using the assay described abov^. Into a 96 well plate containing serial dilutions of the compound in the presence of 10% PCS or 10% PCS + 1 mg/ml AAG, FHV (wild type or resistant strain) and MT4 cells are added to a final concentration of 200-250 CCIDso/well and 30,000 cells/well respectively. After 5 days of incubation (37Â°C, 5% CO?), the viability of the cells i$ determined by the tetrazolium colorimetric MTT (3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2?5T<br>
diphenyltetrazoli-um bromide) method (Pauwels et al. J Virol. Methods 1988,20. [309-321).<br>
