				<td>The present invention relates to an apparatus for displacing slide elements in an apparatus for displaying characters.<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for displacing slide elements in an apparatus for displaying characters, preferably on a price label. It consists of a basic part comprising openings for receiving the slide elements and a visible surface and a reverse side opposite of the same. The slide elements are arranged in a displaceable manner from a first position in which the face sides of the slide elements are visible from the visible surface of the basic part to a second position in which the face surfaces are arranged in the basic part at a distance behind the' visible surface and are substantially not visible. The openings for displaying each character are preferably arranged in a form of a matrix.<br>
A similar apparatus is already known from EP 1232491 Al.  in this case however the apparatus disclosed there has a more complex setting mechanism and a more complex setting method. The apparatus disclosed in EP 1232491 Al calibrates in a first method step the position of the slide elements, such that all slide elements which are provided for displaying a character are displaced to one end of the openings receiving the slide elements. The slide elements are displaced in a second method step to such position in which the desired character can be read on  the  visible  surface.  This  procedure  requires  that positioning pins displacing  the slide elements  need to be introduced first from one side into the openings of the basic part in order to perform the calibration. Other positioning pins  need  to  be  introduced  from  the  other  side  into  the openings in order to push the slide elements to their required end position. This time-offset introduction of the positioning pins into the opening of the basic part requires a convolev motion mechanism of the apparatus. Moreover, the precise time adjustment is very important because the calibration first of the  slide  elements  whose  openings  are  covered  by  the calibrating  positioning  pins  it  is  not  possible  to  first <br>
introduce the positioning pins into the openings which produce the displacement of the slide element according to the character to be displayed.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to avoid these disadvantages and to provide an apparatus of the kind mentioned above which is simple in its configuration and allows to perform a more convenient and quicker setting of the characters to be displayed on the basic part.<br>
This is achieved in accordance with the invention by the characterizing features of claim 1.<br>
As a result of the precise allocation of positioning pins to<br>
each  slide  element  for  each  character  to  be  displayed,  a<br>
separation of the positioning pins can be made in the respect<br>
that only the part of the positioning pins which is required<br>
for displaying the desired character and which push the slide<br>
elements to the visible surface of the basic part is arranged<br>
on a setting template and the other part of the positioning<br>
pins which is responsible for displacing the slide elements in<br>
the  direction  of  the  reverse  side  opposite  of  the  visible<br>
surface  is  arranged  at  the  opposite  side  of  the  setting<br>
template. In this way, the positioning pins can be introduced<br>
substantially simultaneously form both sides into the openings<br>
of the basic part guiding the slide element,  leading to a<br>
substantial  simplification in the movement mechanism of the<br>
apparatus.  It  is  therefore  sufficient  to  press  the  handle<br>
strips against each other. In their initial position they are<br>
oreferably aligned in a V-shaped manner relative to each other<br>
and are connected with each other via a spring element.  By<br>
pressing the handle strips cogether, they are aligned parallel<br>
with respect to each other and the positioning pins moved with<br>
the handle strips can be introduced simultaneously into the<br>
openings  of  the  basic  part.  The  setting  thus  occurs  more<br>
quickly than in the already known apparatus. Positioning pins<br><br>
that need not be displaced due to a former illustrated character are not displaced in the setting apparatus in accordance with the invention.<br>
The arrangement of the positioning pins occurs in the setting templates which are held in the handle strips which according to an embodiment of the invention in accordance with the characterizing feature of claim 2 are joined with each other and are fixed in their position with respect to each other. Groups of positioning pins are arranged in sections on the setting templates. Groups of positioning pins arranged on mutually joined setting templates are allocated with respect to each other in directly opposite sections and are provided for simultaneous introduction of different sides into the openings of the basic part.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention as described in the characterizing features of claim 3, two mutually associated groups of positioning pins comprise the number of positioning pins which corresponds to the number of openings for displaying a character in the basic part. As a result, one of the mutually associated groups can form a positive image of the character to be displayed on the setting template and the other of the associated groups can form an inverse representation of the character on the setting template. Both groups which are introduced simultaneously into the openings of the basic part of mutually opposite sides produce the alignment of the slide elements on the visible surface according to the character to be displayed.<br>
As a result of the characterizing features of claims 4 and 5 it is possible to fasten the setting templates in a displaceable way on the handle strips.<br>
As a result of the characterizing features of claim 6, setting templates arranged mutually opposite on different handle strips can be joined to each other and be fixed in their<br><br>
position relative to each other. There is thus also the definition of mutually associated groups of positioning pins which are introduced substantially simultaneously into the openings of the basic part.<br>
As a result of the characterizing feature of claim 7, the basic part can be held between the handle strips in a position in which the positioning pins can be introduced into its openings .<br>
The characterizing features of claim 8 describe a preferred embodiment of the holding element.<br>
The distance between webs which are arranged in parallel with respect to each other corresponds according to the characterizing part of claim 9 substantially to the width of the setting templates, so that the same can be displaced along the handle strips despite the holding element. Positioning positions which are associated with each other in the holding element receiving the basic part can be brought into position for the introduction into its openings.<br>
The webs forming the holding element and the receiving means each comprise breakthroughs in accordance with claim 10 to 12, which breakthroughs, in combination, form an outwardly accessible cuboid chamber within the holding element into which a basic part can be pushed. The cross section of the chamber is formed by the flush aligned breakthroughs of the webs. The longitudinal section is formed by the breakthrough which is arranged at a right angle thereto in the receiving means .<br>
Claims 13 to 15 describe a preferably realized ejector for the basic part 1. After the alignment of the slide element in the basic part, the same can be removed again rapidly from the apparatus in accordance with the invention, as a result of<br><br>
which the same will become  free  for use in the  next basic<br>
part.<br>
As a result of the characterizing features of claim 16, the holding element and the setting templates form a precisely matched unit which allow a precise mutual positioning.<br>
Claims 17 to 19 describe alternative embodiments of the setting templates.<br>

Fig. 2 shows a sectional view along the line XX of fig. 1. The slide elements can be moved from a position in which they are visible from the visible surface la of the basic part (direction of view 4 in fig. 5} to a position in which they are not visible from the visible surface la.<br>
A matrix of openings 2 is provided for each character to be displayed. In the present case this is a 3x5 matrix. The number of openings per character can be chosen at random.<br>
Depending on the character to be displayed, the slide elements 3 are pushed to a position in which they are visible from the visible surface la (direction of view 4).<br>

Fig. 4 shows the respective sectional view along line YY of fig. 3, with the slide elements shown in fig. 3 as a black dot projecting with their face surfaces 5 slightly over the visible surface la beyond the basic part 1 and thus being visible. It is understood that visibility is also ensured in the case when the face surfaces 5 are flush with the visible surface la and in the case of an arrangement of the face surfaces 5 within the basic part 1, shortly behind the visible surface la.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a side view of a basic part 1 with a web 6 which can be used for fastening to various holding apparatuses or for making the observation angle more convenient.<br>
The apparatus in accordance with the invention is now used to adjust the slide elements 3 in such a way that the characters desired by the user can be displayed.<br>
Figs. 6 to 10 show such an apparatus in accordance with the invention in a side and sectional views.<br>
The apparatus consists of two handle strips 7, 8 which are pivotably connected with each other. Setting templates 16 and 17 are arranged on the same. In the present embodiment, several setting templates 16, 17 are held parallel adjacent to one another and in a longitudinally displaceable manner in each handle strip 7, 8. As will be explained below in closer detail, alternative embodiments for the setting templates are possible.<br>
The setting templates 16, 17 are provided with guide hooks 18 which engage in guide grooves 39 of the handle strips 7, 3 and are guided therein. The guide hooks 18 engaging in the handle strip 7 are simultaneously used as setting handles 11 whose purpose will be explained in closer detail in the course of describing the function.<br>
Covers 10 are provided to cover the guide grooves 39 over the regions of the handle strips 7, 8, which prevents the intrusion of dirt.<br>
The handle strips 7, 8 per se are compressible and are aligned in a V-shaped mariner with respect to each other in their starting position. They are joined with each other via a pivoting apparatus 13. Notice must be taken here that the V-shaped starting position merely represents a preferred embodiment of the invention. The principal reguirement is the compressibility, which can also be achieved for example by a parallel advancing movement. In the present embodiment, the pivoting apparatus 13 is a spring element which produces the V-shaped alignment in the starting position of the handle strips 7, 8 and is arranged in recesses 21 of the handle strips 7, 8. The spring element 13 is provided in its end regions with noses 20 which engage in respective stops 22 of the handle strips 7, 8 and fix the spring element 13.<br>
The handle strip 7 is provided with a reading window 9 through which the adjustable characters 43 painted on the setting templates (cf. figs. 13 and 13a) can be read. Since the reading window 9 always faces the user, the handle strip 7 can also be designated as the upper handle strip and handle strip 8 as the lower handle strip.<br>
Each of the setting templates 16 guided in the upper handle strip 7 is provided with a driver 14 which engages in a respective driving opening 15 of the setting template 17 guided directly opposite in the lower handle strip 8.<br>
Positioning pins 34 for insertion into the openings 2 of the basic part are provided on each setting template 16, 17. It is also possible that several positioning pins are provided for one slide element 3. This is especially advantageous when a<br>
character is not formed by several slide elements which are rnovably held in the openings arranged in a matrix-like way, but when a character is formed merely by a larger slide element (as is shown in figs. 13b, 14b and 16a), which has the shape of the character per se for example. In this case a positioning pin for said larger slide element would lead to the jamming of the same during the displacement.<br>
In  the  present  embodiment,  the  positioning  pins  34  are arranged  in groups  in  the  setting templates  (16,  17),  with each group being separated from each other by webs 33. Groups which  are  directly  opposite  of  one  another  on  mutually opposite setting templates are associated with each other and are  used  for  displaying  a  single  character.  The  number  of positioning pins  34  of such mutually associated groups  thus corresponds in the present embodiment in total to the number of openings 2 of a matrix of a character to be displayed. By joining mutually opposite setting templates 16, 17 by means of driving pins 14 and the driving opening 15 it is ensured that the webs 33 of the mutually opposite setting templates 16,  17 are also aligned so as to be precisely directly opposite of each other and subsequently the groups of positioning pins 34. The webs 33 prevent the compression of the handle strips 7, 9 in case the setting templates 16, 17 are not correctly aligned to each other. This prevents a destruction of the positioning pins .<br>
A holding element 52 is further arranged between the handle strips 7, 8, and especially between the setting templates 16, 17, which holding element is used to hold the apparatus for displaying the characters 1 and to fix the same relative to the positioning pins 34.<br>
The holding element 52 is formed by several webs 41 which extend parallel with respect to each other, which are arranged at a distance from each other in which the setting templates<br>
16, 17 are guided and which are mutually connected by means of a receiving means 23 which extends at a right angle thereto. The webs 41 are provided with latches 42 which cooperate with latching grooves 44 arranged on the setting templates 16,  17 and allow the precise positioning of the positioning pins 34 relative to the basic part 1. The webs each further comprise a breakthrough 53 which substantially corresponds to the cross section of basic part 1. The breakthroughs 53 are aligned in a flush manner, so that a continuous opening is formed in the sliding direction of basic part 1. The receiving means 23 also comprises a breakthrough which is accessible from a side edge and with respect to its shape substantially corresponds to the longitudinal section of the basic part 1.<br>
The respective outermost webs 41a of the holding element 52 are provided with a slightly thicker configuration and provided with a latching hook 45 which grasps behind recesses 46 in the handle strips 7, 8 and fixes the holding element 52 in a longitudinally displaceable manner between the two handle strips.<br>
The receiver 23 divides the breakthroughs 53 of the webs 41 extending parallel with respect to each other into two halves, with the breakthrough being arranged in the intersecting region of the webs 41 with the receiving means 23, so that all breakthroughs jointly form within the holding element 52 an externally accessible, substantially cuboid chamber into which the basic part 1 can be slid.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a sectional view along the line BB of fig. 6. In. this case too it can be clearly seen that each of the upper setting templates 16 is connected with one directly opposite lower setting template 17 via a driving pin 14. Fig. 11 also shows clearly how the setting templates are held in the handle strips 7, 8 via guide hooks 18.<br>
Fig.  12 shows a sectional view along the line CC of fig  6 The free mobility of the setting templates  16,  17  is shown very clearly.<br>
The apparatus in accordance with the invention works as follows:<br>
A basic part 1, which is to be used for example for labeling goods or as a price label,  is slid into the holding element 52. The apparatus in accordance with the invention is still in its initial position as shown in fig.  9,  9a.  The user must then predetermine the characters which are to be displayed on the  basic  part.  This  occurs  by  displacing  the  setting templates  16,  17  by  means  of  the  setting  handles  11.  The longitudinal  displacement  of  the  setting  template  16  is transmitted via the driving pin 14 and the driving opening 15 onto the  setting  template  17.  Mutually associated groups of positioning pins 34 are thus simultaneously displaced parallel with respect to each other.  During the displacement of the setting templates 16, 17, one can read in the reading window 9 which character would be set on compressing the handle strips 7,  8  in the basic part and which positioning pins would be introduced  into  the  basic  part  on  compressing  the  handle scrips.<br>
Once the desired characters have been set (e.g. for the number 1.567 and the special character .-), the groups of positioning pins 34 which are required for theses characters are situated precisely above or below the basic part 1, as is still shown in figs. 9 and 9a.<br>
In a next step, the handle strips 7, 8 are pressed together against the force of the spring element 13, as a result of which the positioning pins 34 of the setting templates 16, 17 are simultaneously introduced into the openings 2 from both sides of the basic part 1 and displace the slide elements 3 (cf. fig. 10 and l0a), with a group of positioning pins 34,<br>
e.g. the lower group in fig. l0a, is responsible relating to each character to be displayed for the face sides 5 of the slide elements 3 which are visible from the visible surface la of the basic part 1, and the associated group of positioning pins 34 (e.g. the upper group in fig. l0a) is responsible for the slide elements 3 which are not visible from the visible surface la. In the present embodiment, mutually associated groups of positioning pins 34 fill all openings 2 of a matrix for displaying a character.<br>
After the handle strips 7, 8 have been brought back to their initial position (as shown in fig. 9), the basic part 1 can be removed from the holding element 1.<br>
In order to facilitate the removal of the basic part 1, an ejection mechanism is provided in the present embodiment. It consists of an ejector 24 which is displaceably held in the holding element 52 or, more precisely, in the receiving means 23 and which projects with a driving edge 29 into the breakthrough of the receiving means 23 and is pretensioned against the insertion movement of the basic part 1, preferably by means of a spring 25. Spring 25 rests on the one hand on the receiving means 23 and on the other hand on a pin 31 of the ejector 24 (cf . fig. 15a and 15b) . The ejector 24 is provided with a guide groove 32 which slides along a guide web 35 extending on the receiving means 23.<br>
By inserting the basic part 1 into the holding element 52, the ejector 24 is displaced over the driving edge 29 in the insertion direction against the force of a spring 25 until the movement is stopped by the ejector arresting device 30. An ejector hook 27 which is arranged on the ejector 24 on a tapering portion 28 is latched on a latching edge 37 of the holding element 52 which is opposite of the insertion opening 12 (or is latched more precisely in the outermost web 4la; cf. fig. 18). During the setting process in which the handle<br>
strips 7, 8 are pressed against each other,  the ejector hook 27 is lifted over the latching edge 37 again by an edge 38 of the lower handle strip 8, as a result of which the ejector 23 is  moved  by  the  spring  25  in  the  direction  towards  the insertion opening 12 of the holding element 52. As soon as the insertion  opening  12  is  released  again,  which  opening  was blocked in the course of the compression of the handle strips 7, 8 by their side surfaces 54a,b or by the positioning pins 34 stuck in the openings 2, the basic part 1 is moved by the ejector 24  from the chamber in the holding element 52 as a result of the relaxation of the spring 25. In order to prevent the basic part 1 from jumping out too quickly,  a frictional surface 26 is provided on the e]ector 24, which surface can be pressed against the basic part 1 and which does not block the ejection but brakes the ejection speed of the basic part 1 to such an extent that the same does not fall out of the holding element,  but  merely  has  enough  kinetic  energy  in  order  to project  out  of  the holding element  52  in order to  then be manually taken therefrom.<br>
Figs. 20, 21 and 22 show alternative embodiments of the setting templates 16, 17. They are configured as elastic bands 50 or chain links 49 which are guided over deflection pulleys 47. The positioning pins 34 and preferably the webs 33 are arranged on the elastic bands 50 or the chain links 49. By turning the deflection rollers 47, the positioning pins 34 which are to be introduced into the openings 2 of the basic part I can be brought to the required position.<br>
As an alternative thereto, the setting templates 16, 17 can also be arranged as polygonal or circular bodies 51 on which the positioning pins 34 are arranged.<br>
Even in the case of alternative embodiments of the setting templates 16, 17, the adjustable characters 43 are painted or printed on the same. <br><br><br><br><br>
