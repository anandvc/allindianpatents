				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the control and prevention of anorectal and colonic diseases comprising of an extract of the plant Euphorbia Prostrata containing one or more flavonoids.<br>
The invention relates to the treatment of anorectal and colonic diseases (including hemorrhoids) by means of novel combination of ingredients, which possess properties to control inflammation, prevent capillary bleeding and fragility.<br>
Anorectal and colonic diseases are usually characterized by inflammation of the infected region. Other common symptoms are those associated with inflammation, like heat, itching, redness, pain and swelling. A common characteristic of such anorectal and colonic diseases is the appearance of fissures, cracks, fistulas and abscesses.<br>
Among the various anorectal and colonic diseases, hemorrhoids occupy a prominent position and have been the subject of numerous clinical studies. Hemorrhoidal disease is characterized by bleeding, without any pain. Fresh blood spots occur immediately, on defecation. However, pain occurs when the hemorrhoids are secondarily infected, or complicated by thrombosis and anal fissures. Hemorrhoids is characterized by episodes of acute hemorrhoid attacks, with bleeding, pain and prolapse of hemorrhoidal mass.<br>
Thus, an effective treatment of acute hemorrhoidal attacks should not only provide relief as early as 2-3 days, after initiation of the treatment, but also reduce the recurrence of such attacks.<br>
There exist several procedures for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Patents have been granted in respect of surgical dressings (European Patent No.88003398) and surgical devices (European Patent No.0095142). A patent, (United States Patent No.4621635) has been granted for the use of lasers in the treatment of hemorrhoids. The techniques of cryopharmacotherapy and electrochemical techniques for treatment of hemorrhoids have also been patented vide European Patent No.0091405 and European Patent No.0116688, respectively. However, the biggest drawbacks of the above, are the involvement of medical experts beyond mere prescription of medicines and probable hospitalization. Also, some of them are physically and/or psychologically unpleasant in application.<br>
Several Patents (Nos.4160148, 4508728, 4797392, 4518583 and 5234914) have been granted in the United States of America in respect of compositions containing certain wound healing agents to provide symptomatic relief, by promoting tissue repair, reducing inflammation and encouraging wound healing. Some of them like United States Patent Nos. 4518583 and 5234914 contain antimicrobial agents. These compositions, however, only relieve symptoms associated with inflammation, like heat, itching redness, pain and swelling.<br>
A number of compositions for the treatment of anorectal diseases (including hemorrhoids) are based on the anaesthetic and vasoconstrictive properties of the constituents, but these provide only temporary symptomatic relief.<br>
Patents in the United States of America (United States Patents Nos.4613498, 4626433, 5166132, 5219880,5234914 and 4797392) and Europe (European Patents Nos.8518086 and 0513442) have been granted in respect of compositions with varying constituents, for topical application in the form of suitable and acceptable pharmaceutical carriers, such as salts, salves, ointments etc., with organic, inorganic and biological active agents. However, these compositions provide only temporary relief and are limited to local application and cannot be used for systemic use or oral administration.<br>
A topical treatment for hemorrhoidal pain and for spasms of the sphintcters and muscles located in the Gl tract is disclosed in a granted patent (US patent 595753) which includes amino acid L-arginine in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Another US patent (5591436) has been granted for a composition for dietary supplement for the treatment of hemorrhoids. The composition comprisis 60% to 95% Indian Barberry by weight; 4.8% to 38% Nagkesar by weight; and 0.2% to 2% Margosa tree leaves by weight.<br>
Another US patent (5562906) discloses the use of bark or berries of the species Xanthoxylum clavaherculis L and Xanthoxylum americanum Hill, both of the yellow wood tree family, both containing the compound Xanthoxylum are employed for the treatment of hemorrhoids and other membrane and capillary disorders of the veins and arteries. Improved strength and flexibility of the veins, arteries and their constituent structures is obtained.<br>
There is available in the market, pharmaceutical compositions containing diosmin and a combination of diosmin and hesperidin for the treatment of hemorrhoids. However, the concentration of diosmin and hesperidin in such compositions is much higher than the concentrations of flavonoids of the present invention. Besides such diosmin and hesperidin are obtained from synthetic sources.<br>
The inventors have researched, and as a result of the expenditure of time and mental faculties have found that the flavonoid composition of the present invention exhibits surprisingly significant enhanced pharmacological and therapeutic response at much lower dosage levels in comparison to existing compositions employing flavonoids.<br><br>
The present invention provides a Pharmaceutical composition which is safe and painless and has long term effectiveness.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A composition and method for treating anorectal diseases including hemorrhoids and colonic diseases with long term effectiveness and low prolapse rates. The treatment includes applying to the hemorrhoids and anorectal tissues an effective amount of composition including a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a mixture of flavonoids. The treatment also includes administration by oral route and / or parenteral route and effective amount of composition including a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and mixture of flavonoids.<br>
Accordingly the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the control and prevention of anorectal and colonic diseases comprising of an extract of the plant Euphorbia Prostrata containing one or more flavonoids from 35 to 62% by weight of the extract, wherein the said flavonoids comprises apigenin-7-glyccoside from 30-45% by weight, luteolin-7-glycoside from 3-9% by weight and 6-methoxy quercetin-3-glycoside from 1 to 6% by weight, quercetin from 1 to 2% by weight and luteolin from 1 to 2% by weight, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s)/base(s) and other active agents from 0.2% to 60.0% of the kind such as herein described.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
This invention provides compositions which are water soluble and can be uniformly distributed in the affected region. It reduces inflammation, and soothes the feeling of itching and burning associated with it. The invention also provides relief from pain, which characterizes hemorrhoids. Growth of microorganisms is also prevented by the composition when administered in any manner. The invention is useful in the treatment of lesions, other than hemorrhoids in the anorectal area and can be formulated in several types of Dosage Forms. There are no side effects from the use of the composition in human beings. Further, the treatment is not physically or psychologically unpleasant in its application. The plant Euphorbia prostrata (Family : Euphorbiaceae) was identified as being relevant in the study of anorectal and colonic diseases, including hemorrhoids. Euphorbia prostrata is well known to the Indian traditional medicine in the use of treatment for asthma, bloody dysentery and sores. Five new compounds were discovered and identified by the inventors in Euphorbia Prostrata (Fig. 1) namely luteolin, 6-methoxy-quercetin-glycoside, Querceitin, and glycosides of luteolin and apigenin. Euphorbia prostrata contains 1-2.5% of total flavonoids. Out of which apigenin glycoside is 0.8-1.4%, luteolin glycoside is 0.2-0.5%, 6-methoxy-quercetin glycoside is 0.2%, quercetin and luteolin is 0.1%.<br>
These flavonoidal constituents are reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds were extracted from Euphorbia prostrata for testing and combined in a proportion, which is new and has not been reported before. The compounds in such proportion were standardized to pharmaceutically acceptable specifications in order to ensure reproducibility from batch to batch. The result is the standardized extract of Euphorbia rpostrata, which is the main active agent in the improved anorectal composition. Another unique feature of this extract of Euphorbia prostrata is, that it is prepared in such manner that the resulting composition is water soluble. Pharmaceutical dosage carriers used in the present invention are capsules, tablets, ointment, creams, gels, foams, aerosols, sprays and the like.<br>
Other plants containing apigenin glycosides and luteolin glycosides are Ixora arborea (Rubiaceae), Bommervia hispida (Pteridaceae), Adenocalymma alliaceum<br>
(Bignomiaceae), Thalictrum thunbergii (Renunculaceae), Perilla frutescens (Labiateae), Matricaria chamomilla (Compositae), Thymus membranaceous (Labiateae), Digitalis lanata (Scrophulariaceae), Cuminum cyminum (Umbelliferae), Petroselinum, Euphorbia minuta, E.Serpeus-microfolia, E.granulata. Chrysanthemum indicum and Matricaria chamomilla (Compositae) contain both apigenin and luteolin.<br>
Glycosides of quercetin has been reported from different species of Euphorbia (E. verrueosa, E. platiphyllos, E.discolor, E. dulcis, E. helioscopia, E. thymifolia etc).<br>
The pharmaceutical composition containing the standardised extract of Euphorbia prostrata<br>
as the active ingredient contains 35-62% flavonoids. Out of which apigenin glycoside is 30-<br>
45%, luteolin glycoside is 3-9%, 6-methoxy quercetin glycoside is 1-6%, quercetin and luteolin<br>
is 1 -2%. The Extract also contains tannins (5%), resins and gums (10-15%), besides pigments,<br>

EVALUATION OF PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF THE STANDARDIZED<br>
EXTRACT<br>
ORAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY (AIA):<br>
Studies with the standardized extract of Euphorbia prostrata, when administered orally<br>
showed an inhibition of both carrageenan-induced oedema at t= 180 min (b = 0.019, r =<br>
0.965, p 
induced oedema (b = 0.019, r = 0.860.p
0.01-32.73).<br>
Carrageenan-induced oedema is a biphasic event, the early hypermia being due to the release of histamine and serotonin and the delayed oedema due to the release of bradykinin and prostaglandins, The findings shown in Table 1, indicate that the orally administered standardized extract (200mg/kg) is effective against both phases of inflammation, inhibiting 76% of oedema and equivalent to 74% inhibition by 1 mg/kg of indomethacin (i.p.).<br>
The results have been further supported by the experiments carried out in histamine and bradykinin induced oedema models. The data shown in Table 2 indicates 77% and 56% inhibition of oedema at + 60 and +120 min in the histamine-induced oedema model, while in the bradykinin-induced model the effect was significant (p

TOPICAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY: Carrageenan-induced Pedal Oedema Test:<br>
Dose dependent antiinflammatory response was observed with the standardized extract (b=0.0287, r=0.991, p
It is thus concluded that the standardized extract is an antiinflammatory agent against two models of acute inflammatory reaction but appears to be relatively less potent than Indomethacin given by a different route (i.p.).<br>
Table 3:<br>
Modification of Carrageenan-induced Mice Paw Oedema following Topical Application of the Standardized Extract and Indomethacin.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Significance releative to the respective control group data: *p
The duration of action of topical preparation was determined by studying the effects of different concentrations of the drug on oedema over a period of 8 hr. As evident from the Table 3, the peak inhibition was observed after 3-4 hours of carrageenan injection begining at 2 hr for the extract at lower concentrations (0.5 -2.0 %) and 1 hr. at 4 % concentration. A similar kinetic response was observed for the mixture of Apigenin glycoside &amp; luteolin glycoside (4:1) (0.2-1%) and Indomethacin (1-2%). The maximal effect of the mixture of apigenin glycoside and luteolin glycoside preparations observed at 4% concentration (37.1% inhibition) and 1 % concentration (46.8% inhibtion), respectively, was comparable to that of indomethacin at 2 percent concentration (41.9% inhibition).<br>
The topical effects of indomethacin were comparable with published results of mice carragenan-induced paw oedema (Schrier, D.J., Moniot, S., Gluckman, M.I. and Gilberston, R.B., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 39,57,1989).<br>
The mixture of apigenin glycoside &amp; luteolin glycoside was found to possess significant AIA on oral administration with ED50, value=5.98 mg/kg (1.12%) to carageenan-induced paw oedema in rats which is comparable to ED50 value=1.11% obtained on evaluation of topical AIA data of same fraction, suggesting that this mixture of compounds has both topical as well as oral AIA. The oral absorption of drug as a result of preening may also be considered in topical effect. However, percutaneous absorption of apigenin glycoside has also been reported. When compared to indomethacin this fraction demonstrated a greater antiinflammatory action and slightly higher inhibition of the later phases of oedema. This is attributed to the activity of luteolin glycoside present in the fraction which is reported to decrease swelling in the later phase of oedematus reaction while apigenin glycoside acts in the earlier phase. Hence it is concluded that the standardized extract and the mixture of apigenin glycoside &amp; luteolin glycoside have signifincant AIA. Further, comparable ED50 values of topical and oral administration of the standardized extract suggest that the topical effect appears to be independent of systemic absorption.<br>
Croton Oil Ear Test:<br>
The test used was described in published literature, where apigenin 7-glucoside was used as a reference sample. Luteolin glycoside (300ug/ear) significantly inhibited the croton-oil induced (72%) and showed a dose dependent inhibition of the oedematous response to corton oil. The activity of the compound is comparable to that of apigenin 7-glucoside. Since the standardized extract also contain similar glycosides, hence also active, but to a lesser extent than the mixture of apigenin glycoside &amp; luteolin glycoside. From this data it can be concluded that these glycosides possess an AIA similar to that already described for other chemically related glycosides.<br>
This comparative study of the standardized extract, apigenin glycoside, luteolin glycoside, and the mixture of apigenin glycoside &amp; luteolin glycoside was confirmed independently by a Pharmacology Institute in Italy on the instruction of the inventors. The data on croton oil ear test in mice was found in agreement with data obtained in our laboratory using carrageenan model; any difference in the responses was attributed to the different administration routes.<br>
Some of the results obtained by Italian Institute are reproduced below (Table 4). Indomethacin and hydrocortisone were used as the reference drugs.<br>
Table 4:<br>
Anti inflammatory activity of the products tested. (Table Removed) • Indomethacin = 1     * Main constiuents of the standardized extract.<br>
Apigenin glycoside and luteolin glycoside appear to be the most active compounds among the compounds tested and are similar in potency to indomethacin, whereas other glycosides are less active. The potency of aglycones has been shown to be strictly propotional to their polarity (data not shown) suggesting that the percutaneous absorption may be an activity-limiting factor.<br>
Study on duration of Topical AIA constituents of the extract:<br>
The effect of apigenin glycoside and luteolin glycoside has been further investigated for the AIA, beyond the standard time of 6 hours; this activity was assessed as oedema (Table 5) and Leucocyte infiltrate inhibition (Table 6) at doses that normally produce an almost complete inhibition of oedema 6 bours after treatment.<br>

Apigenin glycoside and indomethacin lose their antiinflammatory activity 18 hours after treatment, whereas, at that time, hydrocortisone and luteolin glycoside maintain their effect to a certain extent. The inflammation appears to naturally supress after 30 hours. The four compounds strongly and permanently inhibit the leukocyte infilteration, measured as myeloperoxidase activity.<br>
Percutanous absorption of Topically Active Flavonoids :<br>
The topical AIA of apigenin glycoside, one of the main constituents of the standardized extract, appears to be more potent than Indomethacin. These findings are at variance with the common opinion that such chemical compounds are scantily absorbed through the intact skin. The percutaneous absorption of apigenin glycoside was studied in the same test conditions as used for the assessment of its AIA (inhibition of the croton oil-induced oedema in mice ears). To this purpose two doses of 3H-apigenin glycoside (60 and 6 µg/ear) were applied to the inner surface of the mice ears, with or without the usual amount of irritant (35µg/ear). The specific activity of the labelled compounds was adjusted such that constant amount of radio activity and the amount of radio activity present in the wash solutions after exhaustive washings of the ears at the given times.<br>
The experiment shows first order absorption kinetics. The higher dose of apigenin glycoside is absorbed less rapidly (t½ = 4.4 h) than the lower one (t½ =3.4 h). the presence of corton oil enhances the absorption of the compound and the absorpotion rate becomes indentical for the both the doses (t^ = 2.5h).<br>
The higher dose of apigenin glycoside almost completely inhibits the oedematous response to croton oil at least within the first 6 hours, whereas the lower dose has no effect on the development of the inflammatory response. Consequently, the enhanced absorption caused by the croton oil is not bound up with an increased permeability of the inflammed skin. The observed effect is probably due to the lipophilic properties of croton oil, which merely acts as vehicle. It can, therefore, be concluded that apigenin glycoside is absorbed through the intact skin and that its absorption-rate may be increased by a suitable pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
MECHANISM OF AIA OF THE EXTRACT:<br>
Flavonoids offer the advantage of high margin of safety and lack the side effects such as ulcerogenicity over the classical antiinflammatory drugs (Agarwal, O.P., Agents Actions, 12, 298,1982; Havsteen, B., Biochem. Pharmacol., 32,1141,1983). Different approaches to study the antiinflammatory potential of theflavonoids have been made in recent years (Gabor, M., In "Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: Antiinflammatory Drugs," J.R. Vane, S.H. Ferreira (Eds.) Springer, NY, 1979, p.68; Parmar, N.S and Ghosh, M.N., Ind. J. Pharmacol., 10, 277, 1978). It has been suggested that flavonoids not only increase the capillary permeability, they may also inhibit a number of stages in inflammation including granulation, tissue formation and chronic arthritis. The commonly stressed mechanism of action for antiinflammatory drugs is the inhibition of the pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism. However, while this mechanism could apply to luteolin glycoside, apigenin glycoside is unable to affect these processes (published literature) and therefore, other mechanisms of action, such as inhibition of histamine release and radical scavenging activity should be taken into<br>
account for this compound. Apigenin and luteolin also decrease leukocyte infiltration and luteolin maintained its effect even after 18 hours of treatment.<br>
Quercetin and its glycosides have been extensively studied for their effects on inflammation and were found to control significantly the exudative and the proliferative phases of the cotton pellet granuloma (Roschin, Yu. V. and Geraschenko, G.I., Vopr. Farm. Dolnem Vostoke, 1, 134,1973; Chem. Abstr., 83,37683,1975; Kalshinikova, N.Aand Geraschenko, G.I., Aktual. Vopr. Farm.,2, 353,1974; Chem.Abstr., 84,99346,1976). Quercetin also inhibits mast cell histamine secretion (Benett, J.P., Gomperts, B.D. and Wollenweber, E., Arzneim. Forsch., 31, 433,1981), neutrophil functions such as release of lysosomal enzymes, oxygen con-sumption, generation of free radicals and chemotaxis (Busse, W.W., Kipp, D.E and Middleton, E. Jr., J. Allergy Clin. Pharmacol., 73,801,1984). Flavonoids are known to inhibit a number of enzymes including cycloxygenase (Sekiya, S. and Okuda, H., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 105,1090,1982). Flavonoids present in Euphorbia prostrata were found to be active as oral and topical antiinflammatory agents by the inventors (Singla, A.K. and Pathak, K., J. Ethanopharmacol., 27, 55,1989; Singla, A.K. and Pathak, K., J. Ethanopharmacol., 29,291,1990).<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Process of manufacture and evaluation of the standardized extract:<br>
The plant Euphorbia prostrata was collected by qualified professionals from the hilly regions of Ramgarh in North India. The plant was identified and characterised by the guidelines of WHO (WHO/TRM/91.4, Programme Traditional Medicines World Health Organization Ge-neva, 1991) and the plant was dried under control led conditions of temperature and humid-ity. The whole plant was ground to fine/coarse powder.<br>
The powdered drug (5kg) was packed in a S.S. percolator. The extraction was affected by carrying out cold percolation with 15 It. of Ethyl Alcohol first time. 10 It. of menstruum was withdrawn and an equal volume was replaced with fresh ethyl alcohol. The process was repeated 5 times till the drug was exhausted. The alcoholic extracts were combined and concentrated under vacuum at 60°C. The concentrated extract was treated with hot water (80-90°C) and water soluble extract was obtained for the flavonoidal components. The aque-ous extract was extracted with 5-10 volumes of a non polar organic solvent. The organic phasewas dehydrated with suitable desicants and concentrated under vacuum at 60°C. The concentrated extract was dried completely for several hours at 60°C under vacuum. The purified powdered extract was standardised before proceeding further.<br>
The extract of Euphorbia prostrata was characterised by High Performance Liquid Chroma-tography (HPLC). The HPLC was performed under following conditions and using Waters system equipped with M510 pumps and data station with Millenium software.<br>
Mobile phase	:   Acetonitrile: 2% acetic acid (17:23)<br>
Column	:   C18 (250X4mm/5µ)<br>
Flow Rate	:   1 ml/min<br>
Detector	:   UV absorbance at 350 nm<br>
The HPLC graph showed five peaks corresponding to the flavonoid components luteolin, 6-methoxy-quercetin glycoside, quercetin, luteolin glycoside and apigenin glycoside. Out of this the major peaks corresponded to luteolin and quercetin (these were confirmed by comparison with authentic luteolin and quercetin samples. apigenin glycoside and luteolin glycoside were used as the chemical and pharmacological marker for standardisation of the product.<br>
Method of preparation of capsules :<br>
Based on the pharmacological studies it was established that each capsule should contain 15-50 mg of Euphorbia extract with HPLC finger printing compounds. Compound a 35% compounds B 9 %, rest 6 % and total flavonoid content 50 %.<br><br>
Hence, the Euphorbia extract used for each batch was characterised and quantified with respect to flavonoid contents as above. Based on the exact values obtained, the extract quantity of Euphorbia extract per capsules was derived. A typical example of the formula based on average values of flavonoids is as follows:<br>
Example 1:<br>
(Table Removed)Example 2: (Table Removed)<br>
Example 3: (Table Removed) The standardized extract is dissolved in Ethyl Alcohol. Lactose, Colloidal Silicone Dioxide and P. Talc are passed through fine sieves individually. The solution of standardized extract in Ethyl Alcohol is adsorbed on lactose and mixed well to achieve uniformity. The material is dried at temperature of 60-70°C till completely dried. The colloidal silicone dioxide and P.Talc are blended as lubricants. The blend is then analysed for flavonoid contents by HPLC. Based on the assay values the powder is filled in empty hard gelatin capsules at an average fill weight of 300 mg ± 10 mg. The filled capsules are sealed in air-tight unit packages after Q.C. testing.<br>
Method of preparation of ointment:<br>
The standardized extract used for preparation of ointment was characterised in a similar manner as described in the preparation of capsules. Based on the exact values obtained, the exact percentage of standardized extract in ointment was derived. A typical example of the formula based on average values of flavonoids is as follows.<br>
Example 4:<br>
Extract	1%<br>
Cetyl alcohol		20%<br>
Beeswax	24 %<br>
Glycerin	12%<br>
Sodium lauryl sulphate	1 %<br>
Propyl paraben	0.01 %<br>
Methyl paraben	0.03 %<br>
Purified water	q.s 100%<br><br>
Example 5:<br>
Hydrophilic Ointment<br>
Extract	1%<br>
Methyl paraben	0.026 %<br>
Propyl paraben	0.015 %<br>
Sodium lauryl sulphate	1 %<br>
Propylene glycol	12%<br>
Stearyl alcohol	25%<br>
White petrolatum	25%<br>
Purified water	q.s 100%<br>
Example 6:<br>
Polyethylene Glycol Ointment<br>
Extract	3%<br>
Polyethylene glycol 3350        40% Polyethylene glycol 400         57%<br>
The standardized extract is dissolved in glycerin and a small portion of purified water. Sodium lauryl sulphate, methyl paraben and propyl paraben are incorporated in the solution. The solution is warmed to 65-75°C. Simultaneously, cetyl alcohol and beeswax are molten at about 75°C. The aqueous phase is added slowly to the oily phase under constant stirring and keeping the temperature between 65°C to 75°C. The resultant emulsion is stirred further for 1 hour and the weight is made upto 100% with warm purified water, if required. The ointment is allowed to cool and de-aerated. The final product is subjected to quality control testing and filled into lacquered aluminium collapsible tubes and sealed.<br>
EVALUATION OF CLINICAL EFFICACY OF CAPSULES AND OINTMENT<br>
The clinical evaluation of the pharmaceutical composition of this invention was done by University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences with the help of the University Health Centre, Punjab University, Chandigarh. After assessing the anti-inflammatory action and toxicity testing in animals and based on the safe use of plant in Indian Traditional Medicine for other conditions, the drug was administered in oral dosage form and topical application to patients with complaints of hemorrhoids and fissures. Majority of the patients either did not respond or had relapse with other forms of therapy. Patients were normally given one/two capsules a day for a period of 3-9 days. Some patients received both oral and topical preparation. Approximately 32,000 patients had been administered the drug. Most of the patients responded to one course of treatment without any side effects.<br>
