				<td>Process and Apparatus for the Continuous Production of Polyesters<br>
Description<br>
This invention relates to a process and an apparatus for the continuous production of<br>
polyesters (PES) by esterification/transesterification of dicarboxylic acids or dicarboxylic<br>
acid esters with diols, preferably polyethylene terephthalate (PET), proceeding from<br>
terephthalic acid (PTA) or dimethyl 	terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG), in at<br>
least one reaction stage, prepolycondensation of the esterification/transesterification<br>
product under a vacuum by means of a reaction stage consisting of a vertical reactor, and<br>
polycondensation of the prepolycondensation product in at least one polycondensation<br>
stage.<br>
For the continuous production of PET, PTA or dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and EG are<br>
used as starting substances. PTA is mixed with EG and a catalyst solution to form a paste<br>
and charged to a first reaction stage for esterification, in which esterification is effected at<br>
atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure by separating water. When DMT is used, the<br>
DMT melt and the catalyst together with the EG are supplied to a first reaction stage for<br>
transesterification, in which the reaction is effected at atmospheric pressure by separating<br>
methanol (MeOH). The product stream of the esterification/transesterification is supplied<br>
to a reaction stage for prepolycondensation, which generally is performed under a vacuum.<br>
The product stream from the prepolycondensation is introduced into a reaction stage for<br>
polycondensation. The polyester melt obtained is directly processed to obtain fibers or<br>
chips.<br><br>
The conventional process for producing PET comprises two stirring stages each for<br>
esterification and prepolycondensation and a horizontal cascade reactor for<br>
polycondensation, which includes bottom chambers and a stirrer equipped with vertical<br>
perforated or ring disks on a horizontal shaft for the purpose of producing a defined<br>
surface. The disadvantages of this process must in particular be seen in that inside the<br>
cascade reactor comparatively high temperatures of 284 to 288°C, which are<br>
disadvantageous for the quality, occur with sufficiently large flow rates. The vacuum<br>
applied in the first stirring stage of the prepolycondensation to avoid foaming and<br>
entrainment of droplets is limited to p &gt; 50 mbar. The viscosity of the prepolycondensation<br>
product likewise is limited to a range of 0.20 to 0.24 IV. What is furthermore<br>
disadvantageous is the increased gas yield in the cascade reactor forming the<br>
polycondensation stage. The use o:' a horizontal cascade reactor instead of the second<br>
stirring stage for prepolycondensation allows a high flexibility of the PET production with<br>
comparatively lower temperatures of 277 to 283°C in the cascade reactor for<br>
polycondensation and an increased viscosity of the prepolycondensation product of 0.27 to<br>
0.31 IV as well as optimum possibilities for increasing the plant capacity (Schumann,<br>
Heinz-Dieter: Polyester producing plants: principles and technology. Landsberg/Lech:<br>
Verlag Modeme Industrie, 1996, pp. 27 to 33). What remains disadvantageous, however,<br>
are the high investment costs for the apparatus involved and the company building.<br>
In a plant comprising two stirred tanks for esterification, a storey-type reactor for<br>
prepolycondensation and a horizontal cascade reactor for polycondensation, a comparable<br>
stability and flexibility of the polyester production is obtained with relatively little effort,<br>
but with the disadvantage that the dimensions of the reactors of the prepolycondensation<br>
and polycondensation stages will be increased because of increased vapor volumes, and the<br>
admissible transport dimensions are reached already with mean plant capacities.<br>
In the process of producing PET by means of four reaction stages, which is described in<br>
DE-C-4415220, a vertical reactor is used each for postesterification and<br>
prepolycondensation. In its initial upper region, the reactor has a helical duct with product<br>
inlet at the wall, which is open at the top and, extending from the outside to the inside,<br>
communicates via a central overflow with a stirred product sump disposed at the bottom,<br>
the duct bottom ascending continuously in flow direction, so that the depth of the product<br>
stream is decreasing continuously. Seating the product stream is effected by means of<br>
individual radiators initially repeated at intervals and optionally via the duct walls. By<br>
means of the duct bottom ascending in flow direction an automatic system evacuation in<br><br>
flow direction is prevented with the consequence of the formation of residues, quality<br>
deterioration or product losses, in particular in the case of operating troubles or when<br>
shutting down the production plant. Due to the evaporation surface limited by a single duct<br>
bottom, the operating vacuum is ei:her restricted, the operating temperature is increased,<br>
the color quality of the product produced is decreased, or an increased vacuum involves the<br>
risk of an excessive vapor velocity and an entrainment of droplets critical for a trouble-free<br>
condensation; this effect is intensif ed in addition by locally concentrated radiators in the<br>
flow duct.<br>
US-A-5464590 discloses a vertical polymerization reactor with a plurality of trays<br>
disposed vertically one above the other, which each have two flow ducts open at the top at<br>
the respective duct end, and an overflow weir with adjoining bottom recess for the vertical<br>
transfer of product in the form of a freely falling film on the succeeding tray. The duct has<br>
the shape of an approximately ring-shaped double loop, the respective first loop<br>
semicircularly being deflected into the second opposed loop. The liquid polymer traverses<br>
the ducts from the top to the bottom in a free movement. The vapors each flow between the<br>
trays towards the middle of the reactor and escape via central tray apertures to the vapor<br>
outlet at the reactor lid. A low filing level on the trays and a heating restricted to the<br>
bottom region involve a dwell time deficit for the prepolycondensation of esterification<br>
products with restricted polymer degrees of 4.5 to 7.5 with the consequence that either the<br>
number of trays or the dimensions of the reactor must be increased. Another disadvantage<br>
must be seen in that reaction space is lost due to the incorporation of guides and free<br>
falling-film zones. Due to the horzontal arrangement of the duct bottoms and due to the<br>
overflow weirs, a residue-free continuous operation of the reactor and/or its complete<br>
drainability are not ensured.<br>
The same disadvantages are also obtained with the polymerization reactor represented in<br>
US-A-5466419, in which the product charged to the first ring duct is divided in two partial<br>
streams, which each traverse two semicircular loops and half a distance up to the flow<br>
reversal and the overflow weir or the product outlet, i.e. with a comparable duct cross-<br>
section the flow velocity likewise is halved and the hydrostatic pressure difference is<br>
reduced.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to perform the prepolycondensation in the above-<br>
described process for producing PES in a reaction stage and at the same time increase the<br>
viscosity of the prepolycondensation product to 0.24 to 0.26 IV at lower process<br><br>
temperatures of 268 to 275°C in the prepolycondensation stage and 276 to 282°C in the<br>
polycondensation stage as well as a lower vaccum of 7 to 18 mbar. Furthermore, foaming<br>
and entrainment of droplets should be easy to control.<br>
This object is solved in that the es:erification/transesterification product flowing into the<br>
reactor, in which there exists a pres sure of 10 to 40 % of the diol equilibrium pressure of<br>
the prepolycondensation product leaving the reactor, successively traverses with a constant<br>
product height in a free movemen. under limited heating first at least one first reaction<br>
zone formed of a channel, then is ntroduced into the radially outer or radially inner ring<br>
duct of at least one second reaction zone formed of an annular channel divided into a<br>
plurality of concentric ring ducts, and with a constant product height is successively passed<br>
through the ring ducts to the outlet and then into a stirred third reaction zone located at the<br>
bottom of the reactor. Due to the arrangement of a first and a second reaction zone, a<br>
sufficiently large evaporation surface and hence a restriction of the vapor load is achieved.<br>
The total pressure of the reaction product at the bottom of the channels of the first and<br>
second reaction zones, which results from the hydrostatic pressure and the operating<br>
pressure, is smaller than the local diol equilibrium pressure of the polycondensation stage<br>
and is about 5 to 80 %, preferably about 10 to 70 % of the diol equilibrium pressure. As a.<br>
result, reproducible polycondensation conditions can be achieved in a relatively simple<br>
way. For the EG equilibrium pressure the following applies: PGL = 4 PST[(DP)2 -1]-1, where<br>
PST designates the EG vapor pressure and DP designates the degree of polymerization.<br>
At comparable relative total pressures, the product height in the ring ducts of the second<br>
reaction zone is lower than the product height in the channel of the first reaction zone by<br>
the factor of 2 to 3.5.<br>
Usually, the vapors formed in the three reaction zones are jointly withdrawn from the<br>
reactor. A preferred aspect of the invention consists in that the vapors of the first reaction<br>
zone are supplied to a separator "or the entrained product droplets, before the same are<br>
combined with the vapors of the wo other reaction zones. By means of this measure the<br>
foam and droplet problem can be controlled.<br>
The flow in the channel forming the first reaction zone can be regarded as turbulent<br>
because of the vigorous generation of gas up to about half the flow path. With decreasing<br>
generation of gas and increasing viscosity of the product stream a laminar flow will be<br><br>
obtained in the last third of the flow path at the latest. According to the principle of the<br>
similarity of flows in open conduits, the flow of the product stream in the ring ducts of the<br>
second reaction zone is a laminar flow. To avoid the formation of a faster core flow and a<br>
slower edge flow at the bottom and it the walls of the channel of the first reaction zone as<br>
well as in the ring ducts of the second reaction zone in the case of a laminar flow, it is<br>
necessary in accordance with another feature of the invention to slow down the velocity of<br>
the core flow and to accelerate the velocity of the edge flow.<br>
In accordance with the further aspect of ths invention, the product stream is passed<br>
cocurrently parallel or countercurr ently parallel through the ring ducts of the second<br>
reaction stage.<br>
In the apparatus for performing the process, a heating register extending in flow direction<br>
is arranged in the channel of the first reaction zone for the limited controlled heating of the<br>
product stream, the tubes of which heating register are retained in chamber sheets mounted<br>
transverse to the flow direction with a bottom-free and/or wall-free passage. By means of<br>
these chamber sheets the axial velocity of the product stream is slowed down in the free<br>
edge zones and relatively accelerated in the vicinity of the heating register and at the<br>
bottom. Conversely, by means of flow installations in the succeeding laminar conduit<br>
flows the slower velocity at the edge and at the bottom is accelerated and decelerated in the<br>
faster core flow.<br>
In accordance with the particular asp ect of the apparatus, a closed vapor collecting space is<br>
provided above the channel of the first reaction zone, whose outlet opening is connected<br>
with a separator, preferably including a cyclone-like gas conduit, for the entrained product<br>
droplets.<br>
To achieve a constancy of the product levels in the channel of the first reaction zone and in<br>
the ring ducts of the second reaction zone, overflow baffle plates or overflow tubes are<br>
mounted at the end of the channels or ring ducts in accordance with an additional feature of<br>
the invention, and expediently an underflow baffle plate should be provided upstream of<br>
each overflow baffle plate and a riser should be provided upstream of each overflow tube,<br>
in order to avoid separation effects or residues.<br>
To provide for an automatic and complete, i.e. residue-free evacuation of the channel of<br>
the first reaction zone and of the ring ducts of the second reaction zone of the reactor when<br><br>
shutting off the apparatus for produc ing PES, the arrangement of a gooseneck outlet at the<br>
deepest point of the bottom is provided at the end thereof among several possible concepts<br>
in accordance with another feature of the invention.<br>
In accordance with another feature of the invention a drainage tube or interposed drainage<br>
openings are additionally arranged at the ends of channel and/or ring ducts in the rearmost<br>
dead corner at the deepest point of the bottom, in order to avoid an accumulation of<br>
residues.<br>
Expediently, the bottom of the channel of the first reaction zone and/or that of the channel<br>
forming the ring ducts of the second reaction zone is inclined at an angle of 0.5 to 6°,<br>
preferably 1 to 4° with respect to the horizontal plane.<br>
One aspect of the apparatus consists in that the stirrer for the third reaction zone is a<br>
ground-running impeller, a finger, frame or drum stirrer, each with a vertical drive axle.<br>
Alternatively, the stirrer for the third reaction zone can be part of a rotary-disk cascade or a<br>
cage reactor, each with a horizontal drive: axle. The rotary-disk cascade includes<br>
perforated, ring or solid disks, the in.et for the reaction product being half mounted at each<br>
of the axial ends and the common outlet being mounted in the middle. In the case of a<br>
rotary-disk cascade with perforated disks, it is also possible to arrange the inlet for the<br>
reaction product at the one end and to arrange the outlet at the opposite end.<br>
The invention is represented in the drawing by way of example and will be explained<br>
below.<br>
As is shown in the longitudinal sect on, an esterification product for prepolycondensation<br>
is supplied via conduit 1 to the vertical reaction vessel 2 into the radially extending channel<br>
3 which is arranged therein and forms the first reaction zone. In the channel 3, a heating<br>
register 4 is located, whose tubes 5 are arranged concentrically. For forming a vapor<br>
collecting space 6, the channel is terminated at the top by a wall 7 extending concentrically<br>
between the radial outer channel wall and the reaction vessel 2. The product droplets<br>
entrained from the vapor collecting space 6 are separated in the cyclone-like separator 8.<br>
The product leaving the channel 3 is charged via an overflow tube 9 at the beginning of an<br>
external ring duct 10 and thereafter a channel including two further ring ducts 11, 12 and<br>
forming the first portion 13 of the second reaction zone. Upon traversing the ring ducts 10,<br><br>
11, 12, the product is discharged through an overflow tube 14 at the end of the internal ring<br>
duct 12 and is introduced into the external ring duct 15 of a channel including two further<br>
ring ducts 16, 17 and forming the sscond portion 18 of the second reaction zone. At the<br>
end of the internal ring duct 17, the product :is discharged via the overflow tube 19 and<br>
supplied to the sump 22 forming the third reaction zone and stirred by means of an<br>
impeller 20 with vertical drive axle 21. The vapors obtained in the three reaction zones are<br>
passed to the outside via conduit 23 The prepolycondensation product is discharged from<br>
the sump 22 via conduit 24 and supplied to the non-illustrated polycondensation stage.<br><br><br>
