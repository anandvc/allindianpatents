				<td>1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel apparatus for cultivating organic vegetables, and in particular, a novel ' apparatus for cultivating vegetables which enables normal growth of vegetables by just supplying suitable amount of water without necessity to sowing, loosing earth, weeds killing, animal pests killing, fertilizing and the like.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Conventional vegetable planting methods are mostly operated according to a scheme comprising of loosing earth, sowing, weeds killing, animal pests killing, fertilising, killing insects, harvesting and the like, with intervened tedious tasks as regular watering, weeds killing and the like, and thereby various vegetables can be produced for edible purpose of mankind. However, owing to modern environmental sense and health considerations., uses of insecticide are extremely avoided, and hence organic vegetables, being claimed as healthy, environmental protection, toxic-free, and free of residual chemical reagents, has become the most potential and popular vegetables in the 21st century.<br>
1A<br><br>
2<br>
 In  particular,   as   for   fertilizing,   amount  of  fertilizer   can influence directly the growth of the plant, which leads to a problem to be eagerly solved, that is, how to let a fresh learner  who  is   completely   strange  in   agriculture  manage effectively   the   works   of weeds   and   animal  pests   killing and the timing and dosage of fertilizing for normal growth of plants. Moreover, due to reasons stated above, growth of plants can not be effectively controlled which influences date of harvesting, and thus results in a disadvantage of irregular harvesting and hence being not able to enjoy fresh vegetables at   any   time.   In   addition,   in   conventional   sowing   and fertilizing, seeds and fertilizers are been grasped and spread on the soil by hands, which not only always dirties hands after each operation, but also leads to unevenly distribution of seeds and fertilizers in the soil, which can result readily in uneven  growing.   Further,   traditional   routes  of vegetables cultivation are carried out mostly on a farm land needing a wide   land   area   such   that   a   land   becomes   essential   to cultivation, and also, in some regions or countries, no fertile land can be provided for cultivating plants and vegetables due to   the   barren   earth   quality   therein,   and   thereby,   the agricultural development in such regions is limited.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the object of the invention is to provide a novel apparatus for cultivating  vegetables,<br><br>
3<br>
comprising an organic medium layer, a vegetable seeds paper membrane, a position-fixing membrane and an insect-proof screen membrane layer, wherein, said organic medium layer contains an appropriate amount of organic soil ( which consists of leaves, decayed wood, well rotted sawdust, coarse peat moss, which differs according to the kind of vegetables grown) or organic medium for nourishing and also being the base for cultivating organic vegetables, said vegetable seeds paper membrane consists of a lower paper membrane for placing vegetable seeds (such as cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, garlic, lettuce, onions, peas, peppers) on equal distance positions thereon while leaves suitable space and distance needed for their growth, and an upper membrane which covers said seeds and said lower paper membrane by being clamped therewith; and said position fixing membrane and said insect-proof screen membrane are used through bonding therebetween, wherein, holes corresponding to the seeds on the vegetable seeds paper membrane are provided on said position-fixing membrane for supporting and directing the growth of the vegetable and the area without holes is provided to prevent growing of weeds; while fine venting holes are provided on said insect.-proof screen membrane for passing air and water necessary for growth of vegetables and also for preventing insects.<br><br>
The vegetable seeds paper membrane covers a layer of organic medium layer which provides nutrients essential to the growth of vegetable sees. Through adequate wetting, the vegetable seeds paper membrane will break and thus vegetable seeds therein can fall spontaneously into the organic medium layer which just can supply nutrients necessary for growth of vegetables, and therefore, vegetables can grow normally by supplying merely a suitable amount of water.<br>
The position-fixing membrane provided on said vegetable seeds paper membrane can aid and direct the growth of vegetable, and also has an effect of inhibiting the growth of weeds surrounding the vegetable. Two edges of such position-fixing membrane is bonded adhesively onto corresponding lower faces of two edges of the insect-proof screen membrane. The position-fixing membrane and the insect-proof screen membrane are used in conjunction. The insect-proof membrane has a number of fine venting holes thereon for passing air and water necessary for the growth of vegetables.<br>
As vegetable grows, seeds emerge through the organic medium layer and are directed and positioned by the position-fixing membrane. Thereafter, since the insect-proof screen membrane is a thin and soft membrane, vegetables can grow upwardly against the membrane during their growth without being<br>
4<br><br>
suppressed.<br>
In addition, components in the novel apparatus for cultivating  vegetables according to the invention, namely, the organic medium layer, the vegetable seeds paper membrane, the position-fixing membrane and the insect-proof screen membrane are made by rolling into the form of a belt and stored in the form of a roll, and therefore, can be cut into a suitable size and used according to the requirement of cultivating space.<br>
The organic medium layer used in the novel apparatus for cultivating vegetables according to the invention can solve the problem of the land essential to the cultivation of vegetables, and can be used according to suitable place, area of cultivating region and the like are required by the cultivator. The insect-proof screen membrane and the position-fixing membrane can be used to prevent the growing vegetables from damaging by insects and the growing of weeds, which is the most important topic in the cultivation of vegetables. Folding portions of the insect-proof screen membrane can provide a space needed during the growth of vegetables such that organovegetables can grow upwardly against the insect-proof screen membrane and will not be suppressed thereby.<br>
Alternatively, the organic medium layer can be eliminated, i.e., the novel apparatus for cultivating vegetables can be<br>
5<br><br>
6<br>
comprised of a vegetable seeds paper membrane, a position-fixing membrane and an insect-proof screen membrane layer, and directly placed on the surface of the<br>
	land for cultivating vegetables without necessity to<br>
sowing, loosing earth, weeds killing, animal pests killing,<br>
fertilizing and the like.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that, it has progressiveness in that a fertilizing step can be eliminated through supply nutrients by using the organic medium layer. Also, the organic medium layer can be prepared from garbage and wastes, which makes possible the reuse of wastes, and which constitutes the environmental protection practicability and cost saving characteristic of the invention. Furthermore, during cultivating vegetables by using the apparatus according to the invention, none of herbicides or insecticides is needed for killing weeds and preventing insects so that soils, water and environment will not be polluted, and a nice cycle can be resulted.   Moreover,   the   novel   apparatus   for   cultivating<br>
 vegetables according to the invention can save cost of cultivation, simplify agricultural process and solves shortness of manpower in farm as well as can prevent cultivator and farmer from risks of toxic harm and, meanwhile, mankind can benefit well from vegetables free of residual pesticides.<br><br>

DETAILED  DESCRIPTION  OF THE  PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Figure 1 through 3, which are the exploded, assembled and partial enlarged schematic views of  the novel apparatus for cultivating organic-vegetables (such as cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, garlic, lettuce, onions, peas, peppers) according to the invention, respectively. The novel apparatus of the invention comprises components of an organic medium layer 10, a vegetable seeds paper membrane 20, a position-fixing membrane 30 and an<br><br>
insect-proof screen membrane 40.<br>
Wherein, said organic medium layer 10 contains an appropriate amount of organic soil or organic medium for nourishing and also being the base for cultivating  vegetables; said vegetable seeds paper membrane 20 consists of a lower paper membrane for placing organovegetable seeds 25 on equal distance positions thereon while leaves suitable space and distance needed for their growth, and an upper membrane which covers said seeds and said lower paper membrane by being clamped therewith; and said position-fixing membrane 30 and said insect-proof screen membrane 40 are used through bonding therebetween, wherein, holes 33 corresponding to the seeds 25 on the vegetable seeds paper membrane 20 are provided on said position-fixing membrane 30 for supporting and directing the growth of the vegetable, the part without holes 33 suppresses upward growing of weeds, and bonding portions 36 are provided on edges of two sides of the position-fixing membrane 30 for bonding adhesively onto the corresponding edges of the insect-proof screen membrane 40, while fine venting holes 43 are provided on said insect-proof screen membrane 40 for passing air and water necessary for growth of vegetables and also for preventing insects, and folding portions 46 are provided on two sides of the insect-proof screen membrane for providing spaces<br>
9<br><br>
10<br>
 needed for growth of organic vegetables during cultivating such that  they   can  grow  upwardly  against  the  insect-proof screen membrane 40 without limiting on growth thereof.<br>
The vegetable seeds paper membrane 20 covers a layer of organic medium layer 10 which provides nutrients essential to the growth of vegetable seeds. When the vegetable seeds paper membrane 20 is provided with moisture or water, the vegetable seed seeds paper membrane 20 breaks and the vegetable seeds 25 falls spontaneously into the organic medium layer 10 which just can supply nutrients necessary for growth of vegetables, and therefore, vegetables can grow normally by supplying merely suitable amount of water.<br>
The position-fixing membrane 30 provided on said vegetable seeds paper membrane 20 can aid and direct the growth of vegetable. The position-fixing membrane 30 and the insect proof screen membrane 40 are used in conjunction. The insect proof screen membrane 40 has a number of fine venting holes 43 thereon for passing air and water necessary for the growth of vegetables. As vegetables grow, seeds 25 emerge through the organic medium layer 10 and are directed and positioned by the position-fixing membrane 30. Thereafter, since the insect-proof<br><br>
11<br>
screen membrane 40 is a thin soft membrane, vegetables can grow upwardly against the membrane during their growth without being suppressed.<br>
The vegetable seeds paper membrane 20 is made of easily degradable and resolvable material, for example paper pulp; moreover this layer is provided with the seeds sowed at an equidistant position from each other wherein the position of the seeds are fixed.<br>
The position fixing membrane 30 is made of material, which is not easily degradable and resolvable for example non-woven cloth and does not have any weeds. This membrane is provided with holes 33; wherein the seeds 25 of the vegetable seeds paper membrane 20 during its growth causes the seeds paper membrane 20 to degrade and resolve; the seeds 25 grows gradually in the direction of the hole 33 of the position fixing membrane 30; when the vegetable grows further through the vegetable seeds paper membrane 30, the membrane 30 rots and resolves slowly.<br>
The seeds paper membrane 20 cover over the organic medium layer 10; and the position fixing membrane 30 cover over and adhere to seeds paper membrane 20; the two sides of the said seeds paper membrane 30, have bonding portions 36 which can connect and adhere to folding portions 46 of sides of the bottom layer of the insect proof screen membrane 40. Since the insect proof screen membrane 40, is thin and light therefore it cannot restrict the growth of vegetables.<br>
As an alternate form of the invention, the organic medium layer can be eliminated from the novel apparatus for cultivating vegetables according to the invention i.e., the novel apparatus for cultivating organic vegetables can be comprised of a vegetable seeds paper membrane 20, a position-fixing membrane 30 and an insect-proof screen membrane layer 40 (see Figure 4).<br><br>
12<br>
In addition, referring to Figures 5, 6 and 7, either two or three or all of the components in the novel apparatus for cultivating vegetables according to the invention, namely, the organic medium layer 10, the vegetable seeds paper membrane 20, the position-fixing membrane 30 and the insect-proof screen membrane 40, can be made by rolling into the form of a belt and stored in the form of a roll, and therefore, can be cut into a suitable size and used according to the requirement of cultivating space.<br>
The organic medium layer 10 used in the novel apparatus for cultivating  vegetables according to the invention can solve the problem of the land essential to the cultivation of vegetables, and can be used according to suitable space, area of cultivating region and the like as required by the cultivator. The insect-proof screen membrane 40 can be used to prevent the growing organic * vegetables from damaging by insects, which is the most important topic in the cultivation of vegetables. Folding portions 46 of the insect-proof screen membrane 40 can provide a space needed during the growth of organic vegetables such that organic vegetables can grow upwardly against the insect-proof screen membrane 40 and will not be suppressed thereby.<br>
Further, fine holes 43 provided on the insect-proof screen membrane 40 according to the invention have functions as venting, insect-proof and resistance to scrubbing by heavy rain, and hence can provide vegetable good environment and conditions for growing.<br>
Accordingly, the novel apparatus for cultivating vegetables according to the invention, when used in the cultivation of vegetables, has the following advantages:<br>
1. Using of the novel apparatus for cultivating vegetables (such as cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, garlic, lettuce, onions, peas, peppers) according to the invention is not limited by cultivating land,<br><br>
and can adapted to cultivation on deserts, stone lands or poor soils.<br>
2.	Using of the novel apparatus for cultivating vegetables according to the invention can eliminate the step of sowing, and can carried out the cultivation by just assembling in once in the order of an organic medium layer, a vegetable seed paper membrane, a position-fixing membrane and an insect-proof screen membrane into the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
3.	Using of the novel apparatus for cultivating vegetables according to the invention, the insect-proof screen membrane therein has functions as venting, insect-proof, and resistance to scrubbing by heavy rain, and hence can provide vegetables good environment and conditions for growing and thereby can have a good harvest.<br>
4.	Using of the novel apparatus for cultivating organovegetables according to the invention, the position-fixing membrane suppresses growing of weeds and eliminates consumption of fertilizers by weeds that influences the growing of organovegetables.<br>
