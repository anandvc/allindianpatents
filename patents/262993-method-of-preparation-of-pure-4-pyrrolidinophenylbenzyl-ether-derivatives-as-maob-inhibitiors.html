The invention relates to a method for preparing enantiomerically pure 4-pyrrolidinophenylbenzyl ether derivatives. The invention also relates to intermediates useful in the method of the invention as well as salts thereof.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for preparing enantiomerically pure 4-pyrrolidino phenylbenzyl ether derivatives of the formula (I):<br><br><br><br>

d)	or reacting the compound of formula (III) with the compound of formula (IV) in<br>
order to obtain a compound of formula (V):<br><br><br>
and then reacting the compound of formula (V) with an acetylating agent in order to obtain the compound of formula (I);<br>
wherein in the above formulae,<br>
Ar  is an aryl optionally substituted by one or more substituent selected from the group<br>
consisting of halogen, nitro, cyano or Ci-6-alkyl; and<br>
R is Ci_6-alkyl optionally substituted by one or more halogen;<br>
R1   is halogen, halogen-(Ci-C6)-alkyl, cyano, (d-C6)-alkoxy or halogen-(Ci-C6)-alkoxy;<br>
R , R  , R   and R   independently from each other are selected from the group<br>

The preparation of MAO-B inhibitors of formula (I) has already been disclosed in patent application WO 2004/026825 of which the Applicant is proprietor. Nevertheless, this document does not disclose the original process of the invention. It has further been surprisingly found that the original method of the invention allows obtaining the compounds of formula (I) with high yields and purity.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) are selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.<br>
Monoamine oxidase (MAO, EC 1.4.3.4) is a flavin-containing enzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, or noradrenaline, and trace amines, e.g. phenylethyl-amine, as well as a number of amine xenobiotics. The enzyme exists in two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B, encoded by different genes [Bach et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:4934-4938 (1988)] and differing in tissue distribution, structure and substrate<br><br>
specificity. MAO-A has higher affinity for serotonin, octopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline; whereas the natural substrates for MAO-B are phenylethylamine and tyramine. Dopamine is thought to be oxidised by both isoforms. MAO-B is widely distributed in several organs including brain [Cesura and Pletscher, Prog. Drug Research 38:171-297 (1992)]. Brain MAO-B activity appears to increase with age. This increase has been attributed to the gliosis associated with aging [Fowler et al., J. Neural. Transm. 49:1-20 (1980)]. Additionally, MAO-B activity is significantly higher in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease [Dostert et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 38:555-561 (1989)] and it has been found to be highly expressed in astrocytes around senile plaques [Saura et al., Neuroscience 70:755-774 (1994)]. In this context, since oxidative deamination of primary monoamines by MAO produces NH3, aldehydes and H2O2, agents with established or potential toxicity, it is suggested that there is a rationale for the use of selective MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of dementia and Parkinson's disease. Inhibition of MAO-B causes a reduction in the enzymatic inactivation of dopamine and thus prolongation of the availability of the neurotransmitter in dopaminergic neurons. The degeneration processes associated with age and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases may also be attributed to oxidative stress due to increased MAO activity and consequent increased formation of H2O2 by MAO-B. Therefore, MAO-B inhibitors may act by both reducing the formation of oxygen radicals and elevating the levels of monoamines in the brain.<br>
Given the implication of MAO-B in the neurological disorders mentioned above, there is considerable interest to obtain potent and selective inhibitors that would permit control over this enzymatic activity. The pharmacology of some known MAO-B inhibitors is for example discussed by Bentue-Ferrer et al. [CNS Drugs 6:217-236 (1996)]. Whereas a major limitation of irreversible and non-selective MAO inhibitor activity is the need to observe dietary precautions due to the risk of inducing a hypertensive crisis when dietary tyramine is ingested, as well as the potential for interactions with other medications [Gardner et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry 57:99-104 (1996)], these adverse events are of less concern with reversible and selective MAO inhibitors, in particular of MAO-B. Thus, there is a need for MAO-B inhibitors with a high selectivity and without the adverse side-effects typical of irreversible MAO inhibitors with low selectivity for the enzyme.<br><br>

The compounds of formula (I) are, as already mentioned hereinabove, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and can be used for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which MAO-B inhibitors might be beneficial. These include acute and chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, other types of dementia, minimal cognitive impairment or Parkinson's disease. Other indications include psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, panic attack, social phobia, schizophrenia, eating and metabolic disorders such as obesity, as well as the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndromes induced by abuse of alcohol, nicotine and other addictive drugs. Other treatable indications may be peripheral neuropathy caused by cancer chemotherapy (WO 97/33,572), reward deficiency syndrome (WO 01/34,172), or the treatment of multiple sclerosis (WO 96/40,095), and other neuroinflammatory diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are especially useful for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
The cDNAs encoding human MAO-A and MAO-B were transiently transfected into EBNA cells using the procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cytotechnology 15:1-13 (1998)]. After transfection, cells were homogenised by means of a Polytron homogenizer in 20 mM Tris HC1 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Cell membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 45,000 x g and, after two rinsing steps with 20 mM Tris HC1 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA, membranes were eventually re-suspended in the above buffer and aliquots stored at -80°C until use.<br><br>
MAO-A and MAO-B enzymatic activity was assayed in 96-well-plates using a spectrophotometric assay adapted from the method described by Zhou and Panchuk-Voloshina [Analytical Biochemistry 253:169-174 (1997)]. Briefly, membrane aliquots were incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37°C containing different concentrations of the compounds. After this period, the enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of the MAO substrate tyramine together with 1 U/ml horse-radish peroxidase (Roche Biochemicals) and 80 (^MiV-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probes). The samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a final volume of 200 \il and absorbance was then determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Background (non-specific) absorbance was determined in the presence of 10 ^iM clorgyline for MAO-A or 10 \iM L-deprenyl for MAO-B. IC50 values were determined from inhibition curves obtained using nine inhibitor concentrations in duplicate, by fitting data to a four parameter logistic equation using a computer program.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are specific MAO-B inhibitors. The IC50 values of preferred compounds of formula (I) as measured in the assay described above are in the range of 1 ^iM or less, typically 0.1 ^M or less, and ideally 0.02 \iM or less.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be processed with pharmaceutical^ inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols,<br><br>
polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula (I) and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
The following examples are provided for illustration of the invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being representative thereof. The abbreviation "RT" means "room temperature".<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of rac-l-[4-(3-fluoro-benzyloxy)-phenyl]-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-3-<br>
carboxylic acid (compound of formula (II))<br>
4-(3-Fluoro-benzyloxy)-phenylamine (31.2 g, 144 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (208 mL) and acetic acid (52 mL). Itaconic acid (18.96 g, 144 mmol) was added to the stirred mixture. The mixture was heated to reflux (101°C) and kept at this temperature for 3 h.<br><br>
