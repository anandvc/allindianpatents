				<td>Crystalline form of 2-chloro-5-[3,6-dihydro-3-methyl-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1-(2H)-<br>
pyrimidinyl]-4-fluoro-N-[[methyl-(1-methyl-ethyl)amino]sulphonyl]benzamide<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a crystalline form of 2-chloro-5-[3,6-dihydro-3-methyl-<br>
2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1-(2H)pyrimidinyl]-4-fluoro-N-[[methyl(1-methylethyl)-<br>
amino]sulfonyl]benzamide, hereinbelow also referred to as phenyluracil I. The invention<br>
also relates to a process for the preparation of this crystalline form and to crop<br>
protection formulations which comprise this crystalline form of the phenyluracil.<br>
The phenyluracil I, which has the following formula:<br><br>
is a herbicidal active substance which is disclosed in WO 01/083459. Further<br>
processes for its preparation are disclosed in WO 03/097589, WO 05/054208 and<br>
WO 06/097589 and the earlier international application PCT/EP 2006/062414. All<br>
known processes for preparing phenyluracil I provide it as an amorphous substance.<br>
Studies undertaken by the assignee company have demonstrated that the amorphous<br>
phenyluracil I is only moderately suitable for the preparation of formulations which<br>
comprise the substance as solid. Stability problems may occur in particular in the case<br>
of multi-phase formulations.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that suitable processes give a crystalline,<br>
essentially solvent-free form of the phenyluracil I which does not have these<br>
disadvantages. Moreover, it has, surprisingly, emerged that this crystalline form has a<br>
better herbicidal activity and, in a series of crops, has better crop plant tolerance, than<br>
the amorphous form of the phenyluracil I known to date. The inventive crystalline form<br>
is also more compact than the amorphous form to date and, upon its preparation, is<br>
generated in the form of discrete crystals or crystallites. It can therefore be handled<br>
with greater ease than form I.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an essentially solvent-free crystalline form<br>
of 2-chloro-5-[3,6-dihydro-3-methyl-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1-(2H)-pyrimidinyl]-4-<br>
fluoro-N-[[methyl(1-methylethyl)amino]sulfonyl]benzamide.<br><br>
To distinguish the inventive, essentially solvent-free, form of the phenyluracil I from the<br>
known amorphous form, hereinbelow referred to as form I, the former is hereinbelow<br>
also referred to as form II.<br>
Referring to form II, the term "essentially solvent-free" means that the inventive form II<br>
comprises no detectable amounts of solvents incorporated into the crystal lattice, i.e.<br>
the amount of solvent in the crystal lattice is less than 10 mol%, in particular not more<br>
than 5 mol%, based on the phenyluracil I.<br>
The inventive form II can be identified by means of X-ray powder diffractometry on the<br>
basis of its diffraction diagram. Thus, an X-ray powder diffractogram recorded at 25°C<br>
using Cu-Ka radiation (1.54178 A) shows at least 2, as a rule at least 4, frequently at<br>
least 6, in particular at least 8 and specifically all of the reflexes detailed in Table 1<br>
hereinbelow as 26 values, or as interplanar spacings d:<br><br>
Studies on monocrystals of form II at -170°C demonstrate that the underlying crystal<br>
structure is monoclinic. The unit cell has the space group P2(1)/c. The characteristic<br>
data of the crystal structure of form II are compiled in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Besides X-ray powder diffractometry and the crystallographic analysis, differential<br>
scanning calorimetry (DSC) may also be employed for identifying form II.<br>
Form II shows a thermogram with a characteristic melting peak in the range between<br>
170 and 200°C. The peak maximum is typically in the range of approximately 180°C to<br>
190°C. The melting points indicated herein refer to data determined by means of<br>
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, crucible material aluminum, heating rate<br>
5 K/min).<br>
The inventive form II of the phenyluracil I is prepared successfully by controlled<br>
crystallization from a solution of the phenyluracil I in an organic solvent which is<br>
essentially free from water.<br>
To this end, a solution of the phenyluracil I is provided, in a first step i), in an organic<br>
solvent which is essentially free from water, and then, in a second step, a controlled<br>
crystallization of the phenyluracil I is brought about.<br>
In this context, essentially free from water means that the concentration of water in the<br>
solution comprising the phenyluracil I does not exceed 10% by weight, frequently 5%<br>
by weight and in particular 1% by weight, based on the total amount of solvent.<br>
The term "controlled crystallization" is understood as meaning that the crystallization is<br>
performed over a prolonged period which, as a rule, amounts to at least 1 h, frequently<br>
at least 2 h and in particular at least 3 h. The crystallization may also take place over a<br><br>
prolonged period of up to several days, for example 1, 2 to 3 days. Frequently,<br>
however, the crystallization time will not exceed 15 h. Accordingly, the crystallization is,<br>
as a rule, carried out over a period of from 1 to 24 h, frequently 2 h to 15 h, in particular<br>
3 to 10 h.<br>
Suitable solvents are, in principle, those organic solvents and solvent mixtures in which<br>
the phenyluracil I is sufficiently soluble at elevated temperature, for example has a<br>
solubility of at least 100 g/l at 50°C.<br>
Preferred are, furthermore, solvents and solvent mixtures whose boiling point at<br>
atmospheric pressure is in the range of from 50 to 160°C.<br>
Examples of suitable solvents are, in particular, the organic solvents detailed<br>
hereinbelow, also referred to as solvents L1 hereinbelow:<br>
C1-C6-alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, tert-<br>
butanol, 1-pentanol orhexanol,<br>
acyclic ketones having 3 to 8 carbon atoms such as acetone, methyl ethyl<br>
ketone or 3-methylbutan-2-one (isopropyl methyl ketone),<br>
cyclic ketones having 5 to 8 carbon atoms such as cyclohexanone or<br>
cycloheptanone,<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon mixtures, and aromatic<br>
chlorohydrocarbons, in particular mono- and di-C1-C3-alkylbenzenes such as<br>
toluene, xylenes, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzenes,<br>
di-C1-C6-alkyl ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether and methyl tert-<br>
butyl ether,<br>
5- or 6-membered alicyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane,<br>
nitroalkanes having 1 to 3 carbon atoms such as nitromethane,<br>
alkylnitriles having 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as acetonitrile, propionitrile,<br>
isobutyronitrile and butyronitrile,<br>
C1-C4-alkyl esters of aliphatic C1-C4-carboxylic acids, in particular C1-C4-alkyl<br>
esters of acetic acid, such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate,<br>
N,N-dimethylamides of aliphatic C1-C4-carboxylic acids such as dimethyl-<br>
formamide and dimethylacetamide, and<br>
mixtures of the above solvents.<br>
Preferred organic solvents L1 are<br>
C2-C4-alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, n-butanol, isobutanol and<br>
tert-butanol,<br><br>
acyclic ketones having 3 to 6 carbon atoms such as acetone, methyl ethyl<br>
ketone or 3-methylbutan-2-one (isopropyl methyl ketone),<br>
mono-C1-C3-alkylbenzenes such as toluene,<br>
di-C1-Ce-alkyI ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether and methyl tert-<br>
butyl ether,<br>
C1-C4-alkyl esters of acetic acid, such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate,<br>
5- or 6-membered alicyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), and<br>
mixtures of the above solvents.<br>
Especially preferred organic solvents L1 are mono-C1-C3-alkylbenzenes, specifically<br>
toluene, and mixtures of mono-C1-C3-alkylbenzenes, specifically of toluene, with<br>
tetrahydrofuran. Also preferred are mixtures of the preferred solvents L1, in particular<br>
mixtures of mono-C1-C3-alkylbenzenes, specifically mixtures of toluene, with methanol,<br>
where even small amounts of methanol (for example up to 20% by volume, in particular<br>
up to 10% by volume) lead to an improved purity of the crystallizate obtained.<br>
Also suitable in principle are mixtures of the abovementioned organic solvents L1 with<br>
other solvents L2, where the solvent L1 typically accounts for the majority, in particular<br>
at least 70% by weight and specifically at least 90% by weight of the solvent employed<br>
for the crystallization. In particular, the solvent L1 is the sole solvent, or comprises less<br>
than 5% by weight based on the total solvent quantity of an organic solvent other than<br>
L1.<br>
The other organic solvents L2 are, in particular,<br>
carbonates having preferably 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as dimethyl carbonate,<br>
diethyl carbonate or ethylene carbonate,<br>
C1-C6-alkyl esters of aliphatic C1-C4-carboxylic acids such as methyl acetate,<br>
ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, methyl isobutyrate and isobutyl acetate,<br>
hydroxy-C1-C4-alkylaromatics and C1-C4-alkylcarbonylaromatics such as benzyl<br>
alcohol and acetophenone,<br>
aliphatic chlorohydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and dichloroethane,<br>
sulfoxides having preferably 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as dimethyl sulfoxide,<br>
sulfones having preferably 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as dimethyl sulfone and<br>
tetramethylene sulfone, and<br>
aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons having, as a rule, 5 to 10 carbon atoms,<br>
such as hexane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether and petroleum benzine.<br>
The concentration of phenyluracil I in the solution employed for the crystallization will<br>
naturally depend on the type of the solvent and the solution temperature and is<br>
frequently in the range of from 50 to 800 g/l. Suitable conditions can be determined by<br>
the skilled worker on the basis of routine experiments.<br><br>
Preferably, the phenyluracil I solution employed for the crystallization comprises the<br>
phenyluracil I in a purity of at least 85%, frequently at least 90%, in particular at least<br>
95%, i.e. the quantity of organic impurities which are not organic solvent amounts to no<br>
more than 15% by weight, frequently no more than 10% by weight and in particular no<br>
more than 5% by weight, based on the phenyluracil I which is present in dissolved form<br>
in the solvent.<br>
The solution comprising the phenyluracil I can be provided for example by the following<br>
methods:<br>
(1)	dissolving the phenyluracil I, preferably in a form which differs from form II, in an<br>
organic solvent which is essentially free from water; or<br>
(2)	preparation of the phenyluracil I by chemical reaction and transfer of the reaction<br>
mixture, if appropriate after removal of reagents and/or by-products, into an<br>
organic solvent which is suitable in accordance with the invention and is<br>
essentially free from water.<br>
In principle, any known form of the phenyluracil I may be employed for preparing the<br>
solution by dissolving the phenyluracil I. Naturally, a form of the phenyluracil I which<br>
differs from form II will be used. Suitable for this purpose are in particular a solid or<br>
liquid melt of the phenyluracil or amorphous phenyluracil I as known from the prior art.<br>
Suitable forms of the phenyluracil, other than form I, are also solvates, in particular<br>
hydrates, of the phenyluracil I, or a methanol solvate of the phenyluracil I. Also suitable<br>
are mixtures of different forms of the phenyluracil. The hydrates of the phenyluracil I<br>
are the subject matter of a parallel patent application which is referred to herewith in its<br>
entirety.<br>
The solvent used for dissolving the phenyluracil I typically takes the form of one of the<br>
abovementioned organic solvents L1 or a mixture of different solvents L1 or a solvent<br>
mixture, which comprises at least 70% by weight and specifically at least 90% by<br>
weight of solvent L1, based on the total amount of the solvent employed for the<br>
purpose of dissolving.<br>
To dissolve the form of the phenyluracil I which differs from form II, the phenyluracil I<br>
will usually be incorporated into the solvent in the form of finely particulate solid or as a<br>
melt by commixing, which process is carried out at a temperature at which the solvent,<br>
or solvent mixture, is capable of fully dissolving the phenyluracil I.<br>
Dissolving the amorphous form I is usually performed at temperatures in the range of<br>
from 20 to 160°C. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, dissolving of the<br>
phenyluracil I takes place at elevated temperature, in particular at at least 50°C,<br><br>
specifically at at least 80°C, where, naturally, the temperature employed for dissolving<br>
will not exceed the boiling point of the solvent. Frequently, the dissolving is carried out<br>
at temperatures in the range of from 50 to 140°C, in particular in the range of from 80<br>
to 120°C and especially preferably in the range of from 95 to 115°C.<br>
The amount of phenyluracil I which is dissolved in the solvent will naturally depend on<br>
the nature of the solvent L1 and the dissolving temperature, and is frequently in the<br>
range of from 100 to 800 g/l. Suitable conditions can be determined by the skilled<br>
worker by routine experiments.<br>
The solution of the phenyluracil I can also be provided by transferring a reaction<br>
mixture which has been obtained as the result of a chemical reaction and which<br>
comprises the phenyluracil I into an organic solvent which is essentially free from water<br>
and is suitable in accordance with the invention, if appropriate after having removed<br>
reagents and/or by-products. Here, a procedure may be followed in which the reaction<br>
is carried out in an organic solvent or solvent mixture which is composed at least in<br>
part, preferably to at least 50% by weight, of a solvent which is suitable for the<br>
crystallization and, if appropriate, a work-up is performed, where excess reagents and<br>
any catalysts which may be present and any unsuitable solvent which may be present,<br>
e.g. water and/or methanol, are removed. The preparation of a solution of the<br>
phenyluracil I by chemical reaction of a suitable precursor of the phenyluracil I, can be<br>
performed in analogy to the methods which are described in the prior art cited at the<br>
outset, which is herewith referred to in its entirety.<br>
In the event that solvates of the phenyluracil I are employed for preparing the solution,<br>
it may be advantageous to remove the solvate solvent after the dissolving step, but<br>
before the crystallization step, for example by means of distillation.<br>
The crystallization of form II of the phenyluracil I can be brought about in the customary<br>
manner, for example<br>
by cooling the solution which comprises the phenyluracil I in dissolved form,<br>
by addition, to the solution which comprises the phenyluracil I in dissolved form,<br>
of an organic solvent which reduces the solubility, in particular by addition of an<br>
anhydrous nonpolar organic solvent;<br>
by concentrating the solution which comprises the phenyluracil I in dissolved<br>
form, or<br>
by a combination of the abovementioned measures.<br>
As a rule, the crystallization is performed to such an extent that at least 80% by weight,<br>
preferably at least 90% by weight, of the phenyluracil I employed crystallize out.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a procedure will be followed in which the<br>
solution which comprises the phenyluracil I in dissolved form is prepared at elevated<br>
temperature, preferably at at least 50°C, for example 50 to 150°C, preferably 80 to<br>
120°C and especially preferably in the range of from 100 to 115°C, and the<br>
crystallization of the phenyluracil I is subsequently brought about by cooling and, if<br>
appropriate, concentrating the solution. Preferably, the solution of the phenyluracil I will<br>
be cooled by at least 20 K, in particular by 30 to 60 K, in order to initiate the<br>
crystallization. The cooling procedure can be performed in a controlled fashion, i.e. at a<br>
slow cooling rate of, as a rule, not more than 20 K/h, for example 0.5 to 20 K/h and<br>
frequently 1 to 15 K/h. Advantageously, the controlled cooling will be carried out as the<br>
crystallization starts. However, it is also possible to cool more rapidly, in which case the<br>
crystallizate will be moved over a prolonged period in the mother liquor, i.e. until the<br>
desired crystallization time is achieved, before being isolated.<br>
To improve the purity, the crystallization can be carried out in such a way that the<br>
solution of the phenyluracil is first cooled down until part or all of the phenyluracil has<br>
crystallized out, then reheated in order to incipiently dissolve the crystallizate, but<br>
without complete dissolution of the crystallizate taking place, and subsequently cooling<br>
the solution again. As regards the temperatures and the cooling rates, what has been<br>
said above also applies here analogously.<br>
The crystallization of form II can be promoted or accelerated by seeding with seed<br>
crystals of form II, for example by adding seed crystals of form II before or during the<br>
crystallization process.<br>
In the event that seed crystals are added during the crystallization process, they<br>
typically amount to 0.001 to 10% by weight, frequently 0.005 to 5% by weight, in<br>
particular 0.01 to 1% by weight and specifically 0.05 to 0.5% by weight, based on the<br>
dissolved phenyluracil I.<br>
In the event that the crystallization is carried out in the presence of seed crystals of<br>
form II, these are preferably only added at a temperature at which the saturation<br>
concentration of the phenyluracil I in the respective solvent has been attained, i.e. at, or<br>
below, the temperature at which the dissolved amount of phenyluracil I in the solvent in<br>
question forms a saturated solution. The temperature dependence of the saturation<br>
concentration in a solvent can be determined by the skilled worker in routine<br>
experiments. Frequently, the seed crystals are added when the temperature of the<br>
solution is not more than 60°C. Preferably, the solution is left to cool to temperatures of<br>
below 30°C, in particular of 25°C or less, for example to temperatures in the range of<br>
from 0°C to 25°C, after addition of the seed crystals, before the resulting crystalline<br>
material is separated from the mother liquor in order to isolate form II of the<br>
phenyluracil I. Cooling in the presence of seed crystals can be performed in a<br>
controlled fashion at a cooling rate of, as a rule, not more than 30 K/h, for example 1 to<br><br>
30 K/h, frequently 2 to 20 K/h and in particular 3 to 15 K/h, or in a noncontrolled<br>
fashion.<br>
Here too, reheating to incipiently dissolve the crystallizate, followed by renewed<br>
cooling, as described above, may lead to an improved product purity.<br>
It has proved advantageous to move the crystalline material for some time at<br>
temperatures below the crystallization temperature, for example in the range of from 0<br>
to 35°C, in the mother liquor, for example 1 h to 3 h, in order to ensure complete<br>
crystallization into form II. The total time from the beginning of the cooling process to<br>
the isolation of the crystals by separation of the mother liquor will then be in the<br>
abovementioned ranges.<br>
As an alternative, crystallization can also be brought about by addition of an anhydrous<br>
nonpolar solvent L2, for example of 5 to 60% by volume, in particular 20 to 55% by<br>
volume and specifically of 30 to 50% by volume, based on the volume of the solvent, or<br>
solvent mixture, used for dissolving the phenyluracil I. Preferably, the addition of the<br>
nonpolar solvent L2 is effected over a prolonged period, for example over a period of<br>
30 min to 10 h, in particular over a period of from 1 h to 8 h.<br>
In particular, it is possible to combine the addition of the nonpolar solvent and the<br>
addition of seed crystals with one another. The addition of the nonpolar solvent may be<br>
effected in the form of pure nonpolar solvent or in the form of a mixture of nonpolar<br>
solvent with one of the abovementioned solvents L1, in particular in admixture with the<br>
solvent employed for the dissolving process. Examples of nonpolar solvents are<br>
aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane,<br>
isohexane, heptane, octane, decane, and haloaromatics such as chlorobenzene,<br>
dichlorobenzene or mixtures of these.<br>
Obtaining the form II from the crystallizate, i.e. the removal of form II from the mother<br>
liquor, is successfully accomplished by conventional techniques for separating solid<br>
constituents from fluids, for example by filtration, centrifugation or decanting. As a rule,<br>
the isolated solid will be washed, for example with the solvent used for the<br>
crystallization, with water, or with a mixture of the organic solvent used for the<br>
crystallization and water. Washing can be effected in one or more steps, the last wash<br>
step frequently being performed with water. Washing is typically effected at<br>
temperatures of below 30°C, frequently below 25°C and in particular below 20°C, in<br>
order to keep the loss of product of interest as low as possible. Thereafter, the resulting<br>
form II may be dried and then processed. Frequently, however, the moist active<br>
ingredient obtained after washing, in particular water-moist active ingredient, will be<br>
processed directly.<br>
The inventive crystallization generates the form II with a phenyluracil I content of at<br><br>

pyrimidinyl]-4-fluoro-N-[[methyl(1-methylethyl)amino]sulfonyl]benzamide employed as a<br>
starting material for the preparation of form II can be accomplished by the methods<br>
described in WO 01/083459, WO 03/097589, WO 05/054208, WO 06/097589 and<br>
PCT/EP 2006/062414, which are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety by<br>

anhydride and subsequent conversion of the corresponding activated acid<br>
derivative with N-methyl-N-(1-methylethyl)sulfamoylamide, for example:<br><br>
This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from 20°C to the boiling<br>
point of the reaction mixture in an organic solvent in the presence of a base and,<br>
if appropriate, of a catalyst [cf., for example, WO 01/083459, WO 03/097589 and<br>

2) Methylation of 2-chloro-5-[3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1 (2H)-<br>

appropriate, as the solvent.<br>
In a very preferred variant of process (2), the pH is kept in a range of from 1 to 6 during<br>
all of the reaction by the continuous or portionwise addition of base. "Portionwise<br>
addition of base" means that the addition of the base during the conversion is<br>
performed in individual portions, i.e. in at least 2 portions, or in more, up to many,<br>
portions, or continuously.<br>
To carry out the reaction, the NH-uracil, the methylating agent C and, if appropriate, the<br>
base, may be introduced separately, simultaneously or in succession into the reaction<br>
vessel and reacted.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of process (2), the conversion of the NH-uracil<br>

The methylation of the NH-uracil is preferably accomplished at temperatures between<br>
-5°C and 100°C. The reaction time can be determined by the skilled worker in a<br>
manner known per se by routine methods such as thin-layer chromatography or HPLC.<br>
In another variant of process (2a), the conversion can also be carried out in a<br>
multiphase system. This variant is preferred.<br>
As regards methylating agent C, pH, base, temperature and pressure, what has been<br>
said above also applies here.<br>
In accordance with a second, preferred embodiment of process (2), the reaction of the<br>
NH-uracil with the methylating agent C is carried out in an aqueous-organic multiphase<br>
system in the presence of one or more phase transfer catalysts.<br>
Examples of phase transfer catalysts are quaternary ammonium salts, phosphonium<br>
salts, crown ethers or polyglycols. Preferred suitable quaternary ammonium salts<br>
comprise, for example, tetra(C1-C18)alkylammonium halides and N-benzyltriCC1-C^)-<br>

ether (= tetraglyme), triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (= triglyme), polyglycol dimethyl<br>
ether. As a rule, the phase transfer catalyst is employed in an amount of up to 20 mol%<br>
based on the NH-uracil.<br>
The multiphase system comprises an aqueous phase and at least one organic liquid<br>
phase. In addition, solid phases may also be present.<br><br>
The aqueous phase is preferably a solution which comprises the base, in particular an<br>
aqueous solution of alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal hydroxides (such as lithium<br>
hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide), alkali metal<br>
or alkaline-earth metal carbonates (such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate,<br>
potassium carbonate and calcium carbonate) or alkali metal bicarbonates (such as<br>
sodium bicarbonate) in water. It is especially preferred to use alkali metal or alkaline-<br>
earth metal hydroxides, very preferably sodium hydroxide.<br>
The base(s) is/are generally employed in equimolar amounts based on the NH-uracil,<br>
but may also be used in catalytic amounts, in an excess or, if appropriate, as the<br>
solvent. It is preferred to employ at least one equimolar amount of base, based on the<br>
NH-uracil.<br>
Suitable solvents for the organic phase, depending on the temperature range, are<br>
preferably aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane,<br>
cyclopentane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene, chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane,<br>

chlorobenzene, THF, toluene, or mixtures of these solvents; ethyl acetate, n-butyl<br>
acetate, chlorobenzene and THF mixtures, and also toluene and THF mixtures, are<br>
very preferred.<br>
Solid phases may occur during the conversion, for example when the NH-uracil, the<br>
methylating agent C, the base and/or the phase transfer catalyst are not fully dissolved.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the multiphase system when used as the aqueous phase<br>
consists of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and when used as the organic phase it<br>
consists of toluene and tetrahydrofuran, or dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran,<br>
chlorobenzene and tetrahydrofuran, or of ethyl acetate or n-butyl acetate.<br>
To carry out the conversion, the NH-uracil, the methylating agent C, the base and, if<br>
appropriate, the phase transfer catalyst can be introduced separately, simultaneously<br>
or in succession into the reaction vessel and reacted therein.<br>
When using a two-phase system, the phases will, as a rule, be separated before form II<br>
is crystallized. It is especially preferred to dry the resulting product by drying methods<br>
known to the skilled worker, for example by azeotroping the water off together with part<br><br>
of the organic solvent, before carrying out the crystallization.<br>
The figures and examples which follow are intended to illustrate the invention and are<br>
not taken to be limiting.<br>
Figure 1 shows an X-ray powder diffractogram of form II. The X-ray diffractogram of<br>
form II was recorded with a diffractometer type D-5000 from Bruker-AXS in reflection<br>
geometry in the range of 26 = 4°- 35° with a step width of 0.02° using the Cu-Ka<br>
radiation at 25°C. The reported interplanar spacings d were calculated from the<br>
determined 29 values.<br>
Figure 2 shows an IR spectrum of form II. The IR spectra were recorded by means of<br>
FTIR spectrometers "Nicolet Magna 550" and "Nicolet Magna 750" from Thermo<br>
Electron Corp./USA in the wave number range of 400 - 4000 cm"1 at a resolution of<br>
4 cm'1 (32 scans). The test specimens were KBr pellets.<br>
The melting points and melting heats were determined via DSC using a Mettler Toledo<br>
DSC 25 apparatus from Mettler at a heating rate of 5 K/min in the range of from -5°C<br>
to +80°C. The sample amount was 5 to 10 mg.<br>
The crystallographic data of form II (Table 1) were determined using a single-crystal<br>
diffractometer from Bruker ("Bruker P4") using CU-KQ radiation.<br>
Preparation of form II of the phenvluracil I bv crystallization of the amorphous form I<br>
from an organic solvent with removal of the solvent (general procedure)<br>
1 g of amorphous phenyluracil I was dissolved at room temperature in 25 ml of the<br>
solvent stated in each case. The resulting solution was warmed to the temperature<br>
detailed in Table 3 and left at this temperature, a stream of nitrogen passing over the<br>
solution in order to evaporate the solvent. After removal of the solvent, the mixture was<br>
cooled to ambient temperature, and the crystalline material was isolated and analyzed<br>
by means of DSC and/or by means of X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD). Form II was<br>
obtained in all cases.<br><br><br><br>
Example 10: 1 g of amorphous phenyluracil I was dissolved at room temperature in<br>
25 ml of acetonitrile. The clear solution was left to stand for one week at ambient<br>
temperature, without covering, during which process most of the solvent evaporated<br>
and a crystalline white precipitate remained. The DSC peak at 187°C confirmed the<br>
presence of form II.<br>
Example 11: Preparation of form II of the phenyluracil I by crystallization of the<br>
amorphous form I from acetone<br>
0.2 g of the amorphous form I was dissolved in 10 drops of acetone at 22°C, with<br>
stirring. Thereafter, stirring was continued for 3 minutes, and a first turbidity developed,<br>
which intensified over the next 30 minutes with formation of a precipitate. The<br>
precipitate was allowed to settle out (30 min.) and the acetone was then removed<br>
in vacuo; this gave 0.191 g (96% of theory) of form II with a melting point of 180-184°C.<br>
Example 12: Preparation of form II of the phenyluracil I by crystallization from the<br>
reaction solution<br>
50.0 g (0.098 mol) of 2-chloro-5-[3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1(2H)-<br>
pyrimidinyl]-4-fluoro-N-{[methyl(1-methylethyl)amino]sulfonyl}benzamide, 3.2 g<br>
(0.0089 mol) of tetrabutylammonium bromide (= TBAB) and 15.1 g (0.12 mol) of<br>
dimethyl sulfate were introduced into the reaction vessel at 25°C in a mixture of<br>
toluene, water and THF, and the mixture was heated to 40°C. Thereafter, a pH of 5.3-<br>
5.5 was established in the reaction mixture by addition of aqueous 10% strength NaOH<br>
solution. During the entire duration of the reaction, more aqueous 10% strength NaOH<br>
solution was added so that the pH during the entire course of the reaction was<br>
constantly at the pH which had been established beforehand. After the reaction had<br>
ended, stirring of the reaction mixture was continued for 3.5 h at 40°C. The phases<br>
were subsequently separated.<br>
55 to 60% of the solvent employed were removed from the resulting solution by<br>
distillation under atmospheric pressure, giving a hot solution of the title compound in<br>
toluene. The solution was subsequently cooled to 70°C and then, within 5 h, and at a<br>
constant cooling rate, to 20°C, and stirring was continued for 3 h at 20°C. The solid<br>
which had precipitated was filtered off with suction and dried. This gave 42.6 g (84.0%)<br>
of the title compound as form II with an active ingredient content of 96.8%.<br>
Like form I, form II is suitable as herbicide, but is superior to the former in terms of<br>
activity. The invention therefore also relates to plant protection compositions<br><br>
comprising the crystalline form II and adjuvants which are conventionally used in the<br>
formulation of plant protection compositions, in particular plant protection compositions<br>
in the form of aqueous or nonaqueous suspension concentrates. The invention also<br>
relates to a method of controlling undesired vegetation, which comprises allowing<br>
form II of the phenyluracil, preferably as a suitable active substance preparation, to act<br>
on plants, their environment and/or on seeds.<br>
The herbicidal compositions comprising form II effect a very good control of vegetation<br>
on noncrop areas, especially at high application rates. In crops such as wheat, rice,<br>
maize, soya and cotton, they are active against broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds<br>
without inflicting substantial damage to the crop plants. This effect is particularly<br>
observed at low application rates.<br>
Depending on the application method in question, form II, or the herbicidal<br>
compositions comprising it, can additionally be employed in a further number of crop<br>
plants to remove undesired plants. Crops which are suitable are, for example, the<br>
following:<br>
Allium cepa, Ananas comosus, Arachis hypogaea, Asparagus officinalis, Beta vulgaris<br>
spec, altissima, Beta vulgaris spec, rapa, Brassica napus var. napus, Brassica napus<br>
var. napobrassica, Brassica rapa var. silvestris, Camellia sinensis, Carthamus<br>
tinctorius, Carya illinoinensis, Citrus limon, Citrus sinensis, Coffea arabica (Coffea<br>
canephora, Coffea liberica), Cucumis sativus, Cynodon dactylon, Daucus carota,<br>
Elaeis guineensis, Fragaria vesca, Glycine max, Gossypium hirsutum, (Gossypium<br>
arboreum, Gossypium herbaceum, Gossypium vitifolium), Helianthus annuus, Hevea<br>
brasiliensis, Hordeum vulgare, Humulus lupulus, Ipomoea batatas, Juglans regia, Lens<br>
culinaris, Linum usitatissimum, Lycopersicon lycopersicum, Malus spec, Manihot<br>
esculenta, Medicago sativa, Musa spec, Nicotiana tabacum (N.rustica), Olea<br>
europaea, Oryza sativa , Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus vulgaris, Picea abies, Pinus<br>
spec, Pisum sativum, Prunus armeniaca, Prunus avium, Prunus cerasus, Prunus<br>
dulcis, Prunus domesticua, Prunus persica, Pyrus communis, Ribes sylvestre, Ricinus<br>
communis, Saccharum officinarum, Secale cereale, Solanum tuberosum, Sorghum<br>
bicolor (s. vulgare), Theobroma cacao, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, Triticum<br>
durum, Vicia faba, Vitis vinifera and Zea mays.<br>
In addition, form II, or the herbicidal compositions comprising it, can also be used in<br>
crops which tolerate the effect of herbicides as the result of breeding, including genetic<br>
engineering methods.<br>
Furthermore, form II, or the herbicidal compositions comprising it, can also be used in<br>
crops which tolerate attack by insects or fungi as the result of breeding, including<br>
genetic engineering methods.<br><br>
Moreover, it has been found that form II is also suitable for the defoliation and<br>
desiccation of plant parts, for which crops plants such as cotton, potato, oilseed rape,<br>
sunflower, soybean or field beans, in particular cotton, are suitable. In this regard, there<br>
have been found compositions for the desiccation and/or defoliation of plants,<br>
processes for the preparation of these compositions and methods of desiccating and/or<br>
defoliating plants using form II.<br>
As desiccants, form II is particularly suitable for desiccating the aerial parts of crop<br>
plants such as potato, oilseed rape, sunflower and soybean. This makes possible the<br>
fully mechanical harvesting of these important crop plants. Also of economic interest is<br>
to facilitate harvesting, which is made possible by concentrating within a certain period<br>
of time the dehiscence, or reduction of adhesion to the tree, in citrus fruit, olives or<br>
other species and varieties of pome fruit, stone fruit and nuts. The same mechanism,<br>
i.e. the promotion of the development of abscission tissue between fruit part or leaf part<br>
and shoot part of the plants is also essential for the controlled defoliation of useful<br>
plants, in particular cotton. Moreover, a shortening of the time interval within which the<br>
individual cotton plants mature leads to an increased fiber quality after harvesting.<br>
Moreover, it has been found that form II is also suitable for the control of conifers, in<br>
particular of conifer seedlings which grow naturally, specifically for the control of pine<br>
seedlings which grow naturally.<br>
Form II is also suitable for the control of weeds in crop plants such as, for example,<br>
soybean, cotton, oilseed rape, flax, lentils, rice, sugar beet, sunflower, tobacco and<br>
cereals, such as, for example maize or wheat.<br>
Form II or the herbicidal compositions comprising it can be applied, for example in the<br>
form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly<br>
concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions, oil suspensions, pastes, dusts,<br>
tracking powders or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, tracking or<br>
drenching. The use forms depend on the intended purposes; in any case, this should<br>
ensure the finest possible distribution of the active substances according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The herbicidal compositions comprise a herbicidally active amount of form II and<br>
auxiliaries and carriers conventionally used for the formulation of plant protection<br>
products.<br>
Carriers which are suitable are, in principle, all solid substances which are<br>
conventionally employed in plant protection products, in particular in herbicides.<br>
Examples of solid carriers are mineral earths such as silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin,<br>
attaclay, limestone, lime, chalk, boll, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium<br>
sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers<br><br>
such as, for example, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate,<br>
ureas and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal<br>
and nutshell meal, cellulose powders and other solid carriers.<br>
In the case of liquid formulations of form II, the compositions have a liquid phase.<br>
Suitable as the liquid phase are, in principle, water and those organic solvents in which<br>
form II is not soluble or only sparingly soluble, for example those in which the solubility<br>
of form II of the phenyluracil I at 25°C and 1013 mbar is not more than 1% by weight, in<br>
particular not more than 0.1% by weight and specifically not more than 0.01% by<br>
weight.<br>
Preferred liquid phases are, in particular, water and aqueous solvents, i.e. solvent<br>
mixtures which, besides water, also comprise up to 30% by weight, but preferably not<br>
more than 10% by weight, based on the total amount of water and solvent, of one or<br>
more water-miscible organic solvents, for example water-miscible ethers such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, methyl glycol, methyl diglycol, alkanols such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, or polyols such as glycol, glycerol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol and<br>
the like.<br>
Preferred liquid phases are, furthermore, nonaqueous organic solvents in which the<br>
solubility of form II of the phenyluracil I at 25°C and 1013 mbar is not more than 1% by<br>
weight, in particular not more than 0.1% by weight and specifically not more than<br>
0.01% by weight. These include, in particular, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
and oils, in particular those of vegetable origin, furthermore C1-C4-alkyl esters of<br>
saturated or unsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid mixtures, in particular the methyl<br>
esters, for example methyl oleate, methyl stearate, rapeseed oil methyl esters, but also<br>
paraffinic mineral oils and the like.<br>
Typical auxiliaries comprise surface-active substances, in particular the wetters and<br>
dispersants/dispersion aids which are conventionally employed in plant protection<br>
compositions, furthermore additives which modify the viscosity (thickeners), antifoam<br>
agents, antifreeze agents, pH regulators, stabilizers, anticaking agents and biocides<br>
(preservatives).<br>
The invention relates in particular to compositions for plant protection in the form of an<br>
aqueous suspension concentrate (SC). Such suspension concentrates comprise form II<br>
of the phenyluracil I in a finely divided particulate form, where the particles of form II<br>
are suspended in an aqueous phase. The size of the active substance particles, i.e. the<br>
size not exceeded by 90% by weight of the active substance particles, is typically<br>
below 30 μm, in particular below 20 μm. Advantageously, at least 40% by weight and in<br>
particular at least 60% by weight of the particles in the SCs according to the invention<br>
have diameters of below 2 μm.<br><br>
Besides the active substance, aqueous suspension concentrates typically comprise<br>
surface-active substances and, if appropriate, antifoam agents, thickeners, antifreeze<br>
agents, stabilizers (biocides), pH regulators and anticaking agents.<br>
The amount of active substance, i.e. the total amount of phenyluracil of the form II and,<br>
if appropriate, further active substances in such SCs are usually in the range of from 10<br>
to 70% by weight, in particular in the range of from 20 to 50% by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the suspension concentrate.<br>
Suitable surface-active substances are, preferably, anionic and nonionic surfactants.<br>
Other suitable surface-active substances are protective colloids. As a rule, the amount<br>
of surface-active substances will amount to from 0.5 to 30% by weight, in particular 1 to<br>
20% by weight, based on the total weight of the aqueous SCs according to the<br>
invention. Preferably, the surface-active substances comprise at least one anionic<br>
surface-active substance and at least one nonionic surface-active substance, the<br>
weight ratio of anionic to nonionic surface-active substance being typically in the range<br>
of from 10:1 to 1:10.<br>
Examples of anionic surface-active substances (surfactants) include alkylaryl-<br>
sulfonates, phenylsulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkylsulfonates, alkyl ether sulfates,<br>
alkylaryl ether sulfates, alkyl polyglycol ether phosphates, polyarylphenyl ether<br>
phosphates, alkyl sulfosuccinates, olefin sulfonates, paraffin sulfonates, petroleum<br>

Viscosity-modifying additives (thickeners) which are suitable for the aqueous SCs<br>
according to the invention are, in particular, compounds which impart a modified<br>
flowing behavior to the formulation, for example a high viscosity in the static state and<br>
low viscosity in the state of motion. Suitable compounds are, in principle, all those<br>
employed in suspension concentrates for this purpose. Substances to be mentioned<br>
are, for example, inorganic substances, for example layer silicates and organic<br>
modified layer silicates such as bentonites or attapulgites (for example Attaclay® from<br>
Engelhardt), and organic substances such as polysaccharides and<br>
heteropolysaccharides such as Xanthan Gum® (Kelzan® from Kelco), Rhodopol® 23<br>
(Rhone Poulenc) or Veegum® (from R.T. Vanderbilt), with Xanthan-Gum® being used<br>
by preference. The amount of the viscosity-modifying additives is frequently 0.1 to 5%<br>
by weight, based on the total weight of the SCs.<br>
Antifoam agents which are suitable for the aqueous SCs according to the invention are,<br>
for example, silicone emulsions which are known for this purpose (Silikon® SRE, from<br>
Wacker or Rhodorsil®from Rhodia), long-chain alcohols, fatty acids and their salts,<br>
antifoams of the aqueous wax dispersion type, solid antifoams (known as Compounds),<br>
organofluorine compounds and mixtures of these. The amount of antifoam agents is<br>
typically 0.1 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the SCs.<br>
Preservatives may also be added to the suspension concentrates according to the<br>
invention for the purposes of stabilizing them. Suitable preservatives are those based<br>
on isothiazolones, for example Proxel® from ICI or Acticide® RS from Thor Chemie or<br>
Kathon® MK from Rohm &amp; Haas. The amount of preservative is typically 0.05 to 0.5%<br>
by weight, based on the total weight of the SCs.<br>
Suitable antifreeze agents are liquid polyols, for example ethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol or glycerol, and also urea. The amount of antifreeze agents is, as a rule, 1 to<br>
20% by weight, in particular 5 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the<br>
aqueous suspension concentrate.<br><br>
If appropriate, the aqueous SCs according to the invention may comprise buffers to<br>
regulate the pH. Examples of buffers are alkali metal salts of weak inorganic or organic<br>
acids such as, for example, phosphoric acid, boric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid,<br>
citric acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid and succinic acid.<br>
If the formulations of the crystalline modifications of form II are employed for the<br>
treatment of seed, they may comprise further customary constituents as are employed<br>
in seed treatment, for example seed dressing or coating. Besides the abovementioned<br>
constituents, these include in particular colorants, adhesives, fillers and plasticizers.<br>
Colorants which are suitable are all dyes and pigments conventionally used for such<br>
purposes. Both pigments, which are sparingly soluble in water, and dyes, which are<br>
water-soluble, may be used. Examples which may be mentioned are the dyes and<br>
pigments known under the names Rhodamin B, C. I. Pigment Red 112 and C. I.<br>
Solvent Red 1, Pigment blue 15:4, Pigment blue 15:3, Pigment blue 15:2, Pigment blue<br>

will usually not exceed 20% by weight of the formulation and is preferably in the range<br>
of from 0.1 to 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the formulation.<br>
Stickers which are suitable are all customary binders which can be employed in seed-<br>
dressing products. Examples of suitable binders comprise thermoplastic polymers such<br>
as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and tylose, furthermore<br>

esters, cellulose ethers, cellulose ether esters, including methylcellulose,<br>
ethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose<br>
and starch derivatives and modified starches, dextrins, maltodextrins, alginates and<br>
chitosans, furthermore fats, oils, proteins, including casein, gelatin and zein, gum<br>
arabic, shellac. Preferably, the stickers are tolerated by plants, i.e. they have no, or no<br>
substantial, phytotoxic effects. The stickers are preferably biodegradable. The sticker is<br>
preferably selected so that it acts as the matrix for the active components of the<br>
formulation. The amount of sticker will usually not exceed 40% by weight of the<br>
formulation and is preferably in the range of from 1 to 40% by weight and in particular<br>
in the range of from 5 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the formulation.<br><br>
Besides the sticker, the seed treatment formulation may also comprise inert fillers.<br>
Examples are the abovementioned solid carriers, in particular finely divided inorganic<br>
materials such as clays, chalk, bentonite, kaolin, talc, perlite, mica, silica gel,<br>
diatomaceous earth, quartz powder, montmorillonite, but also finely divided organic<br>
materials such as wood meal, cereal meal, active charcoal and the like. The amount of<br>
filler will preferably be selected so that the total amount of filler does not exceed 75%<br>
by weight based on the total weight of all nonvolatile components of the formulation.<br>
Frequently, the amount of filler will be in the range of from 1 to 50% by weight, based<br>
on the total weight of all nonvolatile components of the formulation.<br>
In addition, the seed treatment formulation may also comprise a plasticizer which<br>
increases the flexibility of the coating. Examples of plasticizers are oligomeric<br>
polyalkylene glycols, glycerol, dialkyl phthalates, alkyl benzyl phthalates, glycol<br>
benzoates and comparable compounds. The amount of plasticizer in the coating is<br>
frequently in the range of from 0.1 to 20%, based on the total weight of all nonvolatile<br>
components of the formulation.<br>
In particular, the invention also relates to plant protection compositions in the form of a<br>
nonaqueous suspension concentrate. Such suspension concentrates comprise form II<br>
of the phenyluracil I in a finely divided particulate form, the particles of form II being<br>
suspended in a nonaqueous phase. The size of the active substance particles, i.e. the<br>
size which is not exceeded by 90% by weight of the active substance particles, is<br>
typically below 30 μm, in particular below 20 μm. Advantageously, at least 40% by<br>
weight and in particular at least 60% by weight of the particles in the nonaqueous SCs<br>
have diameters of below 2 μm.<br>
Besides the active substance, nonaqueous suspension concentrates typically comprise<br>
surface-active substances and, if appropriate, antifoam agents, thickeners, antifreeze<br>
agents, stabilizers (biocides), pH regulators and anticaking agents.<br>
The amount of active substance, i.e. the total amount of phenyluracil I in the form II<br>
and, if appropriate, further active substances, in such nonaqueous SCs is usually in the<br>
range of from 10 to 70% by weight, in particular in the range of from 20 to 50% by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the nonaqueous suspension concentrate.<br>
Suitable surface-active substances are, preferably, the abovementioned anionic and<br>
nonionic surfactants. As a rule, the amount of surface-active substances will amount to<br>
from 1 to 30% by weight, in particular 2 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
the nonaqueous SCs according to the invention. Preferably, the surface-active<br>
substances comprise at least one anionic surface-active substance and at least one<br>
nonionic surface-active substance, the weight ratio of anionic to nonionic surface-active<br>
substance being typically in the range of from 10:1 to 1:10.<br><br>
The form II according to the invention may also be formulated as powders, including<br>
tracking powders, and dust. Such formulations can be prepared by mixing or<br>
concomitantly grinding the form II with a solid carrier and, if appropriate, further<br>
auxiliaries.<br>
Form II according to the invention may also be formulated as granules, for example<br>
coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules. Such formulations<br>
can be prepared by binding the active substances to solid carriers. Solid carriers are<br>
mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk,<br>
boll, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate,<br>
magnesium oxide, ground synthetic substances, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate,<br>
ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas and products of vegetable origin such<br>
as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or<br>
other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of form II in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within wide<br>
limits. In general, the formulations comprise approximately from 11 to 98% by weight,<br>
preferably from 10 to 95% by weight, based on the total weight of active substances.<br>
The formulation examples which follow illustrate how such preparations are made:<br>
I.	20 parts by weight of form II are mixed thoroughly with 3 parts by weight of the<br>
sodium salt of diisobutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, 17 parts by weight of the<br>
sodium salt of a lignosulfonic acid from a sulfite waste liquor and 60 parts by<br>
weight of pulverulent silica gel, and the mixture is ground in a hammer mill. This<br>
gives a water-dispersible powder which comprises the form II. Finely distributing<br>
the mixture in 20 000 parts by weight of water gives a spray mixture which<br>
comprises 0.1% by weight of form II.<br>
II.	3 parts by weight of form II are mixed with 97 parts by weight of finely divided<br>
kaolin. This gives a dust which comprises 3% by weight of form II.<br>
III.	20 parts by weight of form II are mixed intimately with 2 parts by weight of<br>
calcium salt of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, 8 parts by weight of fatty alcohol<br>
polyglycol ether, 2 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a phenolsulfonic<br>
acid/urea/formaldehyde condensate and 68 parts by weight of a paraffinic<br>
mineral oil. This gives a stable nonaqueous suspension concentrate of the<br>
form II.<br>
IV.	10 parts by weight of form II were formulated as suspension concentrate in a<br>
solution of 17 parts by weight of a poly(ethylene glycol)(propylene glycol) block<br>
copolymer, 2 parts by weight of a phenolsulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensate<br>
and approximately 1 part by weight of other auxiliaries (thickeners, antifoams) in<br><br>
a mixture of 7 parts by weight of propylene glycol and 63 parts by weight of<br>
water.<br>
The application of form II or of the herbicidal compositions comprising it is<br>
accomplished in the form of aqueous spray mixtures, unless the formulation is ready to<br>
use. These aqueous spray mixtures are prepared by dilution with water of the<br>
abovementioned formulations which comprise form II of the phenyluracil I. The spray<br>
mixtures may also comprise further constituents in dissolved, emulsified or suspended<br>
form, for example fertilizers, active substances of other groups of herbicidal or growth-<br>
regulatory active substances, further active substances, for example active substances<br>
for controlling animal pests or phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria, furthermore mineral<br>
salts which are employed for alleviating nutritional and trace element deficiencies, and<br>
nonphytotoxic oils or oil concentrates. As a rule, these constituents are added to the<br>
spray mixture before, during or after dilution of the formulations according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Form II or the herbicidal compositions comprising it can be applied by the pre-<br>
emergence or the post-emergence method. If the phenyluracil I is less well tolerated by<br>
certain crop plants, application techniques may be employed where the herbicidal<br>
compositions are sprayed, with the aid of the spraying apparatus, in such a way that<br>
the leaves of the sensitive crop plants ideally do not come into contact with them, while<br>
the active substances reach the leaves of undesired plants which grow underneath, or<br>
the bare soil surface (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
Depending on the aim of the control measures, the season, the target plants and the<br>
growth stage, the application rates of form II are from 0.001 to 3.0, preferably from 0.01<br>
to 1.0 kg/ha active substance (a.s.).<br>
To widen the spectrum of action and to obtain synergistic effects or to increase<br>
selectivity, form II can be mixed with a large number of representatives of other groups<br>
of herbicidal or growth-regulatory active substances and/or safeners and can be<br>
applied together with these. Form II may be employed, or applied, in analogy to the<br>
mixtures of phenyluracils I with herbicides, growth regulators and/or safeners, which<br>
mixtures have been described in WO 2003/024221, WO 2004/080183,<br>
WO 2006/097509 and WO 2007/042447.<br>
Examples of suitable mixing partners are 1,2,4-thiadiazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, amides,<br>
aminophosphoric acid and its derivatives, aminotriazoles, anilides, aryloxy/heteroaryl-<br>
oxyalkanoic acids and their derivatives, benzoic acid and its derivatives, benzothia-<br>
diazinones, 2-(hetaroyl/aroyl)-1,3-cyclohexanediones, heteroaryl aryl ketones,<br>

acid and its derivatives, chloroacetanilides, cyclohexenone oxime ether derivatives,<br>
diazines, dichloropropionic acid and its derivatives, dihydrobenzofurans, dihydrofuran-<br><br>

aryloxyphenoxypropionic acid esters, phenylacetic acid and its derivatives, 2-phenyl-<br>
propionic acid and its derivatives, pyrazoles, phenylpyrazoles, pyridazines, pyridine-<br>
carboxylic acid and its derivatives, pyrimidyl ethers, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas,<br>
triazines, triazinones, triazolinones, triazolecarboxamides and uracils. Examples of<br>
suitable safeners are (quinoline-8-oxy) acetic acids, 1-phenyl-5-haloalkyl-1H-1,2,4-<br>
triazole-3-carboxylic acids, 1-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-5-alkyl-1/7-pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic<br>
acids, 4,5-dihydro-5,5-diaryl-3-isoxazolecarboxylic acids, dichloroacetamides, alpha-<br>

N-[[4-(aminocarbonyl)phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-benzamides, 1,8-napthalamide, 2-halo-4-<br>
(haloalkyl)-5-thiazolecarboxylic acids, phosphorothiolates and N-alkyl-O-<br>
phenylcarbamates and their agriculturally useful salts, and, with proviso that they have<br>
an acid function, their agriculturally useful derivatives, such as amides, esters and<br>
thioesters.<br>
Moreover, it may be useful to apply the form II, alone or in combination with other<br>
herbicides and/or safeners, jointly as a mixture with yet further plant protection agents,<br>
for example with agents for controlling pests or phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also<br>
of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for alleviating<br>
nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Nonphytotoxic oils and oil concentrates may<br>
also be added.<br>
Use examples<br>
The herbicidal activity of form II was demonstrated by the following greenhouse<br>
experiments:<br>
The culture containers used were plastic pots which were filled with soil (for example<br>
loamy sand with approximately 3.0% humus) as the substrate. The seeds of the test<br>
plants were sown separately for each species.<br>
In the case of the pre-emergence treatment, the active substances, which were<br>
suspended in water, were applied directly after sowing, by means of finely distributing<br>
nozzles. The containers were irrigated gently to promote germination and growth and<br>
subsequently covered with translucent plastic tents until the plants had rooted. This<br>
covering brings about a uniform germination of the test plants, unless this has been<br>
adversely affected by the active substances.<br>
For the purposes of the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were first grown to a<br>
height of 3 to 15 cm, depending on the growth form, and only then treated with the<br>
active substances which have been suspended in water. To this end, the test plants<br><br>
were either sown directly and grown in the same containers, or they were first grown<br>
separately as seedlings and transplanted into the test containers a few days prior to the<br>
treatment.<br>
The plants were kept at temperatures of from 10 to 25°C, or 20 to 35°C, respectively,<br>
depending on the species. The test period extended over 2 to 4 weeks. During this<br>
period, the plants were tended, and their response to the individual treatments was<br>
evaluated.<br>
The evaluation was carried out using a scale of from 0 to 100. 100 means no<br>
emergence of the plants, or complete destruction of at least the aerial parts, and 0<br>
means no damage or normal course of growth.<br>
The abovementioned methods were used to compare, in a greenhouse test, form II<br>
according to the invention and, as comparison compound, form I, which is disclosed in<br>
WO 01/83459, in each case formulated as aqueous suspension concentrate (SC;<br>
100 g/l), if appropriate with the addition of 1 l/ha Rustica Ol ®. The suspension<br>
concentrates had the following composition:<br><br>
dispersant I: EO/PO block copolymer<br>
dispersant II: phenolsulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensate<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
