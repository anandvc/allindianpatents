				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A PHARMACUTICAL COMPOSITION FOR TREATING DIABETES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for<br>
treating diabetes containing coenzyme Q.<br>
Background Art<br>
Diabetes is one of the. most common yet serious<br>
lifestyle-rElated diseases. More than one million patients<br>
suffer from diabetes worldwide. Furthermore, the number of<br>
people that have pre-diabetes, i.e., a relatively high blood<br>
glucose level, far exceeds the number of diabetes patients.<br>
Diabetes is a serious disease on a worldwide scale.<br>
There are two types of diabetes known: Type I diabetes<br>
caused by insulin hyposecretion (insulin-dependent diabetes)<br>
and Type IT diabetes caused by a lowered response to insulin<br>
(non-insulin-dependent diabetes). Most of the diabetes<br>
patients have Type II diabetes, which is frequently caused<br>
by an inappropriate lifestyle, such as overeating.<br>
One problem of diabetes is the lack of symptoms<br>
indicating hyperglycemia. Thus, the blood glucose level<br>
frequently remains uncontrolled over a long term, thereby<br>
leading to complications (such as retinopathy, nephropathy,<br>
and arteriosclerosis). For example, the most common cause<br>
of adult visual impairment in Japan is diabetic retinopathy.<br>
The second most common cause of chronic renal failure<br>
leading to artificial dialysis in Japan is diabetic<br>
nephropathy. Due to the seriousness of these complications,<br>
the primary objective of diabetes treatment is to maintain<br>
stringent blood glucose control.<br>
The blood glucose of Type I diabetes patients can be<br>
highly effectively controlled by insulin injection since<br>
insulin hyposecretion is the cause of Type I diabetes.<br>
However, insulin injection is not so effective for Type II<br>
diabetes patients since Type II diabetes patients have a low<br>
response to insulin. Treatments for Type II diabetes<br>
patients include diet restriction, in which the intake of<br>
excess dietary calories is restricted, combined with<br>
kinesitherapy to promote the consumption of calories inside<br>
the body. However, diet restriction is difficult to<br>
continue in many cases. For those patients who do not show<br>
significant progress despite the diet restriction and<br>
kinesitherapy, treatment through the administration of drugs<br>
for diabetes (sulfonylurea agents, biguanide agents, and the<br>
like) is attempted. However, these drugs have the following<br>
serious problems. Sulfonylurea agents (SU agents), which<br>
have a long history of administration and the second-<br>
generation agent of which has been available since the 1970s,<br>
are known to cause hypoglycemia resulting from an excessive<br>
reduction of the blood glucose level. Moreover, the SU<br>
agents produce strong feeling of hunger and thus tend to<br>
cause the diet restriction to fail. This often leads to<br>
failure in controlling the blood glucose and promotes<br>
obesity. Thus, the administration of SU agents having these<br>
problems must be tightly controlled by physicians.<br>
Biguanide agents (BG agents) have also been used since the<br>
1970s. However, since soon after the release of the<br>
biguanide agents, many cases of a side effect, i.e., lactic<br>
acidosis, have been reported. Although the administration<br>
method and the effectiveness of the BG agents have recently<br>
been reassessed, the administration of the BG agent also<br>
needs tight control under physicians.<br>
Under these circumstances, the development of new oral<br>
agents for diabetes has been attempted, and, for example, a-<br>
glucosidase inhibitors and insulin sensitizers have been<br>
developed. However, these drugs have a short history, and<br>
whether these drugs can be recognized as highly safe and<br>
effective agents must await further investigations. In fact,<br>
the development of an insulin sensitizer, troglitazone, has<br>
been discontinued due to a side effect of hepatopathy.<br>
As is described above, highly safe oral agents for<br>
diabetes have been rarely available to diabetes patients.<br>
The primary treatment for diabetes is still diet<br>
restriction; however, stringent diet restriction is<br>
difficult in many actual cases. Although many low-calorie<br>
meals for diabetes patients have been developed, they<br>
contribute only partially to the treatment of diabetes.<br>
Furthermore, since no therapeutic drugs to treat<br>
complications characteristic of diabetes are available,<br>
prevention of complications is currently done through<br>
stringent control of the blood glucose level. Accordingly,<br>
treatments of diabetes await highly safe and effective drugs,<br>
effective food that can be safely administered during diet<br>
restriction, and the like.<br>
Coenzyme Q is an essential ingredient found in a wide<br>
diversity of living organisms from bacteria to mammals and<br>
is known to function as a constituent of the electron<br>
transfer system of mitochondria in the cells of living<br>
organisms. Coenzyme Q not only serves as a transfer agent<br>
of the electron transfer system by repeating oxidation and<br>
reduction in the mitochondria but also has an antioxidative<br>
effect. The primary component of the coenzyme Q of human<br>
beings is coenzyme Qlo, which is a coenzyme Q having a side<br>
chain consisting of 10 repeating units.<br>
The important feature of the coenzyme Qlo is high safety.<br>
A chronic toxicity test conducted at a daily dose of 1,200<br>
mg/Kg for 52 weeks in rats reported no toxic effects (K. D.<br>
Williams et al., J. Agric. Food Chem. , 4.Z, 3756-3763, 1999).<br>
With respect to coenzyme Q10, oxidized coenzyme Qlo is<br>
widely used as a drug for congestive heart failure in Japan<br>
and as a health food in Europe and the United States.<br>
Although there is a report that suggests the effectiveness<br>
of the oxidized coenzyme Qlo on diabetes (Shimomura, Y. et<br>
al., 1981, Rinsho to Kenkyu, 58, 1349-1352), the<br>
effectiveness of the oxidized coenzyme Qlo on diabetes<br>
patients is not actually known. The reduced coenzyme Qlo is<br>
an active form of an oxidized coenzyme Qlo and is readily<br>
converted into an oxidized coenzyme Qlo in air by oxidation.<br>
Thus, the reduced coenzyme Qlo has not been used in products.<br>
We have found before that the oral absorbability of the<br>
total coenzyme Q10 can be increased by mixing the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 with the oxidized coenzyme Qlo compared to when<br>
the oxidized coenzyme Qlo is used alone (Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 10-109933). However,<br>
whether the reduced coenzyme Q10 exhibits a higher effect<br>
than the oxidized coenzyme Q10 on diseases such as diabetes<br>
has not been clear.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
highly safe oral composition that can satisfactorily control<br>
the blood glucose level of diabetes patients.<br>
The present inventors have conducted extensive<br>
investigations and found that a composition effective for<br>
diabetes can be obtained by using a highly safe coenzyme Q,<br>
in particular, a reduced coenzyme Q.<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for treating diabetes,<br>
comprising 0.001 to 20% by weight (to the total amount of the composition) of a reduced co-<br>
enzyme 0 represented by Formula (I) as an effective component.<br>
and a pharmaceutically effective material, such as herein described; optionally, in combination<br>
with 0.001 to 20% by weight (to the total amount of the composition) of an oxidized coenzyme<br>
Q represented by formula (2). as effective components:<br>
The present invention also relates to the above-described compositions<br>
further containing a<br>
therapeutic drug for diabetes; and to the above-described<br>
compositions in which the therapeutic drug for diabetes is a<br>
sulfonylurea agent, a sulfonamide agent, a biguanide agent,<br>
an a-glucosldase inhibitor, an insulin sensitizer, or<br>
insulin.<br>
The present invention also relates to a drug, a<br>
functional food, and animal feedstuff containing the above-<br>
described composition for treating diabetes.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for<br>
controlling the blood glucose level and a method for<br>
preventing diabetic complications using the above-described<br>
compositions for treating diabetes.<br>
Detailed Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
A coenzyme Q is represented by either formula (1):<br>
(wherein n represents an integer between 1 and 12), or<br>
formula (2):<br>
(wherein n represents an integer between 1 and 12). The<br>
coenzyme Q represented by formula (1) is a reduced coenzyme<br>
Q and the coenzyme Q represented by formula (2) is an<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q.<br>
The process for obtaining the oxidized coenzyme Q and<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q is not particularly limited. An<br>
example of such a process includes the steps of preparing a<br>
coenzyme Q by a conventional method, such as synthesis,<br>
fermentation, or extraction from natural materials, and<br>
condensing an oxidized coenzyme Q fraction or a reduced<br>
coenzyme Q fraction of the eluate obtained by chromatography.<br>
The oxidized coenzyme Q can be prepared by a conventional<br>
process. The reduced coenzyme Q may be prepared by adding a<br>
common reductant, such as sodium borohydride or sodium<br>
dithionite (sodium hydrosulfite), to the coenzyme Q obtained<br>
as above, reducing the coenzyme Q by a conventional method<br>
to prepare a reduced coenzyme Q, and condensing the<br>
resulting reduced coenzyme Q by chromatography. The reduced<br>
coenzyme Q can be prepared by interaction of the above-<br>
described reductant with a commonly available high-purity<br>
coenzyme Q.<br>
As shown in formulae (1) and (2), the coenzyme Q used<br>
in the present invention has a side chain having one to<br>
twelve repeating units ("n" in the formulae). A coenzyme Q<br>
having a side chain having ten repeating units, i.e., a<br>
coenzyme Qlo, is particularly preferred.<br>
The composition for treating diabetes according to the<br>
present invention contains either the above-described<br>
reduced coenzyme Q as an effective component or the above- <br>
described reduced coenzyme Q and the above-described <br>
oxidized coenzyme Q as effective components. <br>
The process for obtaining the composition for treating<br>
diabetes is not particularly limited. For example, either<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q prepared as above or the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q and the oxidized coenzyme Q prepared as above may<br>
be dissolved in an appropriate common solvent, such as<br>
isopropyl alcohol, acetone, or ether, so as to obtain a<br>
composition containing a predetermined amount of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q. Alternatively, the reduced coenzyme Q in solid<br>
form may be used. Alternatively, the reduced coenzyme Q in<br>
solid form may simply be mixed with the oxidized coenzyme Q<br>
in solid form. Alternatively, a mixture of the oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q and the reduced coenzyme Q obtained in the<br>
process for producing the coenzyme Q described above can be<br>
directly used. The composition of the present invention can<br>
be directly prepared by controlling the duration of the<br>
reduction of the above-described commonly available high-<br>
purity coenzyme 0. the type of the reductant, or the amount<br>
of the reductant.<br>
In view of effectiveness, costs, and the like, the<br>
composition for creating diabetes according to the<br>
present invention preferably contains 0.001 to 20 percent<br>
by weight, and more preferably 0.01 to 10 percent by<br>
weight of the coenzyme Q, whether in reduced or_oxidised<br>
state, to the total amount of the composition.<br>
The reduced coenzyme Q content is preferably at least<br>
60 percent by weight, and more preferably at least 80<br>
percent by weight of the total amount of the coenzyme Q to<br>
achieve higher efficacy.<br>
The composition for treating diabetes according to the<br>
present invention may contain a drug for treating diabetes<br>
in addition. Examples of the drug for treating diabetes<br>
include sulfonylurea agents, sulfonamide agents, biguanide<br>
agents, a-glucosidase inhibitors, insulin sensitizers, and<br>
insulin.<br>
The content of the drug for treating diabetes is not<br>
particularly limited and may be appropriately determined<br>
according to the usage, such as drugs, functional foods, and<br>
animal feedstuffs.<br>
The composition for treating diabetes according to the<br>
present invention improves glucose tolerance and facilitates<br>
the control of blood glucose levels, for example. Thus, the<br>
composition for treating diabetes is effective for<br>
preventing the onset of diabetes, treating diabetes, and<br>
preventing diabetic complications.<br>
The composition for treating diabetes of the present<br>
invention can also be used in methods for controlling the<br>
blood glucose level and methods for preventing diabetic<br>
complications.<br>
The above composition for treating diabetes of the<br>
present invention can be used in, for example, drugs for<br>
diabetes, functional foods and food materials for diabetes,<br>
and feedstuffs for diabetic animals. Here, the term<br>
"functional foods" refers to products that are not drugs but<br>
can be taken orally to maintain or improve health. Examples<br>
of the functional foods include oral supplements, foods for<br>
specified health use, health foods, and dietary supplements.<br>
The composition for treating diabetes can be used in<br>
any applications that involve oral administration of the<br>
coenzyme Q or oral administration of the coenzyme Q and the<br>
drug.<br>
When the composition for treating diabetes of the<br>
present invention is used as drugs, functional foods, animal<br>
feedstuffs, or the like, the dosage form is not particularly<br>
limited. For example, the composition for treating diabetes<br>
may be used as a powdered agent, a granular agent prepared<br>
by mixing a binder, a coated powder agent prepared by<br>
coating powder particles with a coating agent, or a capsule<br>
containing the powdered agent, the granular agent, or the<br>
coated powder agent. The composition for treating diabetes<br>
may be blended with natural oil, oily higher fatty acids,<br>
higher fatty acid monoglycerides, a surfactant, or a mixture<br>
of these to prepare a soft capsule containing the resulting<br>
oily mixture. Here, a material mainly composed of gelatin<br>
or other water-soluble polymer may also be used. Moreover,<br>
the term "capsule" includes microcapsules.<br>
In particular, for functional food applications, the<br>
coenzyme Q may be incorporated into conventional foods for<br>
diabetes.<br>
The composition for treating diabetes preferably<br>
contains an antioxidant for preventing oxidation of the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q. However, the antioxidant may not be<br>
necessary depending on the form of dosage. Examples of the<br>
antioxidant include citric acid and derivatives thereof,<br>
vitamin C and derivatives thereof, lycopene, vitamin A,<br>
carotenoids, vitamin B and derivatives thereof, flavonoids,<br>
polyphenols, glutathione, selenium, sodium thiosulfate,<br>
vitamin E and derivatives thereof, superoxide dismutase<br>
(SOD), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase,<br>
glutathione reductase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and<br>
combinations of these.<br>
A chelating agent may be used to also prevent oxidation.<br>
Examples of the chelating agent include<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and salts thereof,<br>
ethylenediaminediacetic acid and salts thereof,<br>
hydroxyiminodiacetic acid and salts thereof,<br>
hydroxyethylethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and salts<br>
thereof, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and salts<br>
thereof, nitrilotriacetic acid and salts thereof,<br>
triethylenetetraaminehexaacetic acid and salts thereof,<br>
dicarboxymethyl glutamic acid tetrasodium salt,<br>
dihydroxymethylglycine, 1,3-propanediaminetetraacetic acid<br>
and salts thereof, l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropanetetraacetic<br>
acid and salts thereof, gluconic acid sodium salt,<br>
hydroxyethylidenediphosphonic acid, nitrilotris,<br>
phosphonobutanetricarboxylic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the above-described antioxidants may be<br>
used in combination with the chelating agents.<br>
The composition for treating diabetes of the present<br>
invention may contain adequate amounts of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable and food-hygiene-acceptable materials in addition<br>
to the above-described reduced coenzyme Q according to<br>
conventional processes. Examples of the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable and food-hygiene-acceptable materials include,<br>
but are not limited to, excipients, disintegrants,<br>
lubricants, binders, coating agents, coloring agents,<br>
coagulation inhibitors, absorption promoters, solubilizing<br>
agents, stabilizing agents, health food materials, dietary<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail<br>
by way of nonlimiting examples.<br>
(EXAMPLE 1) Effects on Model Rats Having Type II Diabetes<br>
The improvement effects of the reduced coenzyme Q10 and<br>
the oxidized coenzyme Qlo on the glucose tolerance were<br>
examined using model GK rats (5 weeks old, male) having Type<br>
II diabetes. The rats were fed ad libitum with a powdered<br>
feedstuff containing 0.1 percent by weight of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Qlo (containing 2 percent by weight of the oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10) or a feedstuff containing 0.1 percent by weight<br>
of the oxidized coenzyme Qlo. In order to avoid the reduced<br>
coenzyme Qlo in the feedstuff mixture from decreasing due to<br>
oxidation, the feedstuff was completely replaced with a new<br>
one every two days. The control group was fed with a<br>
powdered feedstuff free of coenzyme Qlo. The glucose<br>
tolerance test was conducted four weeks and six weeks after<br>
the feeding of the feedstuff mixture was started (n = 4 in<br>
each group). In the glucose tolerance test, a 50% glucose<br>
solution was orally administered at a dose of 4 ml/kg, and<br>
the blood glucose level was measured before the<br>
administration and 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and<br>
120 minutes after the administration. The blood glucose<br>
level in blood collected from the tail vein was determined<br>
with a simple blood glucose meter. The results are shown in<br>
Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the results of the glucose tolerance test<br>
after four weeks of administration. The increase in blood<br>
glucose level in the group fed with the oxidized coenzyme Qlo<br>
30 minutes after the glucose load was significantly<br>
inhibited in comparison with the control group. This fact<br>
shows that the glucose tolerance was improved. The blood<br>
glucose level in the group fed with the reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
sharply decreased in comparison with the oxidized coenzyme<br>
Q10 group at all measurement times beginning with 30 minutes<br>
after the glucose load. This fact shows that the glucose<br>
tolerance was further improved.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the results after six weeks of<br>
administration. The glucose tolerance in the group fed with<br>
the oxidized coenzyme Q10 showed further improvements in<br>
comparison with that in after four weeks. The increase in<br>
the blood glucose level after the glucose load was inhibited<br>
in comparison with the oxidized coenzyme Q10. The increase<br>
in blood glucose level in the group fed with the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 was strongly inhibited at all measurement times.<br>
The blood glucose level was 200 mg/dl or less at all<br>
measurement points. This fact shows that the glucose<br>
tolerance was improved to a greater extent in comparison<br>
with that after four weeks of administration.<br>
These results show that the glucose tolerance of GK<br>
rats can be improved by the administration of the oxidized<br>
coenzyme Qlo. Furthermore, the test results also show that<br>
the glucose tolerance of GK rats can be further improved by<br>
the administration of the reduced coenzyme Q10 in comparison<br>
with the administration of the oxidized form. Interestingly,<br>
the improvement patterns of the glucose tolerance in the<br>
group fed with the oxidized coenzyme Qlo after four weeks and<br>
six weeks of administration were the same. In particular,<br>
the increase in blood glucose level 30 minutes after the<br>
glucose load was inhibited; however, the blood glucose level<br>
kept increasing until about an hour after the glucose load<br>
and subsequently became almost steady, during which no large<br>
difference was observed in comparison with the control group.<br>
In contrast, the glucose tolerance improvement patterns in<br>
the group fed with the reduced coenzyme Qlo after four weeks<br>
and six weeks of administration peaked 30 minutes after the<br>
load and decreased with time. The blood glucose level in<br>
the group fed with the reduced coenzyme Qlo 30 minutes after<br>
the peak was significantly lower than that of the control<br>
group. This fact shows that the glucose tolerance was<br>
clearly improved. It was a surprise to find that the<br>
pattern of improvements on the glucose tolerance achieved by<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10 was different from that achieved by<br>
the oxidized coenzyme Q10. In the previous investigations,<br>
we discovered that the oral absorbability of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Qlo is different from that of the oxidized coenzyme<br>
Qlo (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No.<br>
10-109933). This time we discovered that the improvement<br>
pattern of the glucose tolerance in GK rats was different<br>
between the oxidized form and the reduced form. The<br>
difference in absorbability alone cannot account for such<br>
differences. Thus, it can be presumed that the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 has different effects from those of the oxidized<br>
coenzyme Qlo in vivo.<br>
(EXAMPLE 2) Effects on Blood Glycosylated Hemoglobin<br>
The blood glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin Alc)<br>
level of GK rats fed for 12 weeks was measured as in EXAMPLE<br>
1. The results are shown in Table 1. The hemoglobin Alc<br>
level in the group fed with the reduced coenzyme Q10 showed a<br>
significant decrease, i.e., about 78% of the blood<br>
hemoglobin Alc level of the control group. In contrast,<br>
although the hemoglobin Alc level in the group fed with the<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 showed a decrease, i.e., 92% of that of<br>
the control group, the decrease was not significant and was<br>
smaller than the decrease achieved by the group fed with the<br>
reduced coenzyme Qlo. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels are<br>
clinically important parameters for controlling blood<br>
glucose levels. The fact that the group fed with the<br>
reduced coenzyme Qlo showed a significantly low level<br>
indicates that the blood glucose level of GK rats was<br>
satisfactorily controlled by the administration of this<br>
substance. The group fed with the oxidized coenzyme Q10 only<br>
showed a slight decrease, which was not as significant as<br>
that achieved by the group fed with the reduced coenzyme Qlo.<br>
This result concerning the glycosylated hemoglobin level is<br>
presumably attributable to the insufficient improvements in<br>
glucose tolerance shown in EXAMPLE 1.<br>
