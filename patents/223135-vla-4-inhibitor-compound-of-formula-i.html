FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds that selectively inhibit the binding of ligands to the adhesion receptor, a,P] inlegrin, also known as VLA-4. Compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment and prevention of pathologies associated with VLA-4 mediated cell adhesion, such as inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and tumor metastasis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A primary feature of such pathologies as inflammation and autoimmune diseases is the accumulation of activated leukocytes in affected tissues. The process by which leukocytes transmigrate from the circulation at a site of inflammation involves a cascade of interactions that can be divided into four major steps: tethering and rolling, activation, firm adhesion, and transmigration (Springer, T., Ann. Rev. Physiol. 57:827 (1995)). Initially, leukocytes are lightly tethered to the endothelium and roll along its surface. This is followed by cell activation, mediated by soluble chemotactic stimuli, which initiates the development of a firmer bond between individual leukocytes and endothelial cells. The firm bond then results in the successful adhesion and transmigration of the leukocytes through endothelial cell junctions. The steps occur in series and each is essential for transmigration to occur. This also means that transmigration can be modulated at each step, thus providing a number of potential targets for pharmacological inhibition.<br>
The receptors involved in leukocyte migration have, to a large extent, been characterized as belonging to particular cell adhesion molecule families (Carlos and Harlan, Blood, 84:2068 (1994)). The initial attachment and rolling step is mediated by a family of adhesion receptors referred to as selectins. Firm adhesion is mediated by interaction of leukocyte surface integrins with molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on the surface of the endothelium. Both integrins and the immunoglobulin-type adhesion molecules are also primarily involved in leukocyte transmigration. After transmigration, the leukocytes rely on integrins to traverse through the extracellular matrix and remain at the site of inflammation,<br>
Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of two noncovalently associated subunits, a and p (Hynes, R.. Cell. 69:11 (1992)), There are at least 16 different a subunits (arct9, ctL, aM, aD, ctx aE, a^, a.) and at least 9 different p (P,-Ps)<br><br>
subunits. Integrins are divided inlo sub-families, based upon the p subuiiit. Leukocytes express a number of different integrins, including a4P,, (XJP,, a6p,, a,p7, aLP 2, ax^h and ctvp3.<br>
a4p, integrin, also known as very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) or CD49d/CD29, is expressed on monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, all of which are key effector cells in various inflammatory disorders (Helmer, M., Ann. Rev. Immunol.. 8:365 (1990)). a4p, integrin serves as a receptor for vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), as well as to the extracellular protein fibronectin (FN) (Elices eta!.. Cell. 60:577 (1990)). Anii-inflammatory effects and delayed disease progression have been demonstrated after in vivo monoclonal antibody blockade of the tx4p/VCAM-1 pathway (Lobb ef a/.. J. Clin. Invest.. 94:1722-28 (1994)). In a-guinea pig mode] of pulmonary inflammation, anti-a4 inhibited both antigen-induced bronchial hyperreactivity and leukocyte recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Pretolani et al., J. Exp. Med.. 180:795 (1994)). Antibodies to aA or VCAM-1, prevented antigen-induced eosinophil infiltration of the mouse trachea fNakajima et al.. J. Exp. Med., 179:1145 (1994)). a4or VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody treatment also delayed or prevented cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity response in mice and monkeys (Chisholmef a!., Eur. J. Immunol.. 23:682 (1993); Silberef al., J, Clin. Invest.. 93:1554 (1993); cardiac allograft rejection in mice, accompanied by specific immunosuppression (Isobeer al.. J. Immunol.. 153:5810 (1994); grafi-versus-host disease in mice after bone marrow transfer (Yanee/a/. .Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:10494. (1993); and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats and mice (Yednock ef at., Nature, 356:63 (1992); Baron et al.. J. Exp. Med.. 177:57 (1993)).<br>
Rational drug design studies have produced soluble VCAM-Ig fusion protein containing the two N-tenninal domains of human VCAM-1 fused to a human IgGl constant region. In vivo administration of the fusion protein significantly delays the onset of adoptively transferred autoimmune diabetes in n on obese diabetic mice (Jakubowski et a I.. J. Immunol.. 155:938 (1995)), Another approach has used three-dimensional crystallographic structures of VCAM-1 fragments lo synthesize cyclic peptide antagonists that closely mimicked the a4 integrin binding loop in domain 1 of VCAM-I. Synthetic VCAM-1 peptide CQIDSPC, was able to inhibit the adhesion of VLA-4-expressing cells to purified VCAM-1 (Wang et a!., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 92:5714 (1995)).<br>
An additional strategy is to block the binding of a4pi lo its other counter receptor, that is, an alternatively spliced region of fibronectin containing the connecting segment-1 (CS-1) motif<br><br>
(E.A. Wayner, J. Cell. Biol., 116:489 (1992)). A synthetic CS-1 tetrapeptide (phenylacetic acid-Leu-Asp-Phe-d-Pro-amide) inhibited VLA-4-mediated lymphocyte adherence in vitro and reduced accelerated coronary arteriopathy in rabbit cardiac allografts (Molossi et a!., J. Clin. Invest-, 95:2601 (1995)). Each of these studies provide evidence that selective inhibition of a4p,/VCAM-1 mediated adhesion is a proven strategy in the treatment of autoimmune and allergic inflammatory diseases.<br>
Moreover, while United States Patent 5,821,231 and PCT Applications WO 96/22966, WO 97/03094, WO 98/04247 and WO 98/04913 describe compounds exhibiting VLA-4 inhibitory activity in in vitro binding assays, none of the described compounds have exhibited efficacy in oral administration.<br>
Accordingly, despite these advances, there remains a need for small, non-peptidic, specific inhibitors of VLA-4 dependent cell adhesion that are orally bioavailable and that are suitable for the long-term treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and other pathologies associated with leukocyte migration and adhesion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the present invention selectively inhibit the binding of ligands toa,p, and therefore, are useful for inhibition, prevention and suppression of VLA-4-mediated cell adhesion and the pathologies associated with that adhesion, such as, for example, inflammation, asthma, arthritis, diabetes, autoimmune responses, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, transplantation rejection, and tumor metastasis.<br>

The term "prodrug" refers to a chemical compound that is converted to an active agent by metabolic processes in vivo. [See, e.g., N. Boder and J.J. Kaminski, .^nn. Rep. Med. Chem. 22:303 (T987) and H. Bundgarrd, ^(A', Drug Delivery Rev., 3:39 (1989)]. The use of prodrug precursors of compounds of the present invention in any of the methods described herein is contemplaled and is intended to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
Terminology related to "protected," "protecting" and/or "deprotecting" functionalities is used throughout this application. Such tenninology is well understood by persons of skill in the art and is used in the context of processes which involve sequential treatment with a series of reagents. In this context, a protecting group refers to a group which is used to mask a functionality during a process step in which it would otherwise react, but in which reaction is undesirabJe. The protecting group prevents reaction at that step, but may be subsequently removed to expose the original functionality. The removal or "deprotection" occurs after the completion of the reaction or reactions in wliich the functionality would interfere. Thus, when a sequence of reagents is specified, as it is in the processes of the invention, the person of ordinary skill can readily envision those groups that would be suitable as "protecting groups" for the fimctionalities involved.<br>
In the case of the present invention, the functionalities that must be protected are amines. Suitable groups for that purpose are discussed in standard textbooks in the field of chemistiy, such as Protective Groups in Organic Svnthesis by T.W.Greene fJohn Wilev &amp; Sons. New York. 1991], which is incorporated herein by reference. Particular attention is drawn to the chapter entitled "Proiecrion for the Amino Group" (pages 309-405). Preferred protecting groups include BOC and Fmoc. E^templary mediods for protecting and deprotecting with these groups are found in Greene and Wuts on pages 318 and 327.<br>

In vitro Assays A direct binding assay was used to quaniify the inhibitory activity of the compounds. In this assay, VLA-4-expressing cells were seeded in a 96-weJl microliter plate. The cells were allowed to grow for 2 days until confluent. Various concentrations of the lest comfwund were added together with 2 nM of the europium-labeled, VCAM-IgG fusion protein. The cells were allowed to inoAate at room temperature in the microwells for at least 30 minutes. Following incubation, the microwells were emptied and washed. The amount of europium-labeled VCAM-IgG fijsion protein bound was determined by time-resolved fluorescence measurement. Inhibition of binding was determined by quantifying the fluorescence bound to Ihe plate for each of the various concentrations of test compound, as well as for controls containing no test compound.<br>
The VLA-4-expressing cells used in this assay was a CHO cell line stably transfecled with the cDNA of the human a4 and pi subunits. Construction and maintenance of the cell line are described in the assay procedures. A VCAM IgG fusion protein containing the one to seven immunoglobulin domains of human VCAM-1 (DID?) attached above the hinge region of an IgGl molec\ilc was labeled with euiopium chelates. The preparation and labeling of the fusion protein are described in the assay procedures.<br>
The cell adhesion inhibitory activity of the test compound was detennined by blocking the Jurkat cell attachmcnl to the DID7-VCAM IgG fusion protein, Jurkal cell is a human lymphocytic cell line expressing VLA-4 on cell surface. In this assay, each of the 96-well inicrotiter wells was coated with 75 ng of the VCAM IgG fusion protein. The wells were then blocked by the addition of 1% bovine senmi albumin to remove nonspecific adhesive sites. Varying concentrations of the test compound were added together with the calcein-labcled Jurkat cells. The cells were allowed to adhere to the VCAM coated wells at room temperature for 1 hour in the dark. Following incubation, the piate was washed by immersing face down into a container filled with phosphate buffered saline. The wells were blotted dry on paper towel. Quantitation of the adhered cell was detennined by fluorescence measurement. Decreased fluorescence indicated inhibition of cell adhesion by the test compound.<br>
Specificity for a4 pi of each test compound among other integrin receptors, namely, P2 (LFA-1 and Mac-1). p3 (GPIIb/IIla and ctvpS), pi Ca5pi) and p? (a4p7) was examined. LFA-1 binds to ICAM-1 and mediates the emigration of leukocytes into inflammatory sites. Mac-1 binds to a number of ligands, including lCAM-1 and fibrinogen, and plays an important role in<br><br>
neutrophil phagocytosis and oxygen free radical generation. GPilb/IIIa on platelet smfacc binds to fibrinogen in plasma and induces plaJeJel aggiegalion. avp binds lo a number of exlracciluJar matrix proteins, including vitronectin and mediates cell migration and prevents cell apoptosis. n4p7 shares the same ligands as VLA-4 (VCAM-l, MAdCAM-l,and libronectin), but with different preference, This receptor is expressed on lymphoid cells and is involved in lymphocyte migration to mucosal tissues.<br>
Assays of LFA-1, Mac-1, GPIIb/IIIa and avp3 involved coating the purified receptor on a 96-well microliter plate. The specific ligands for these receptors were labeled with europium chelates. In the assays of LFA-1 and Mac-1, an ICAW-1 IgGfijsion protein containing the one to five immunoglobulin domains of human ICAM-1 (DIDS) attached above the hinge region of an IgGl molecule, was used. In the assays of GPIIb/nia and avP3, europium-labeled fibrinogen and vitronectin, respcc^veJy, was used. The purified receptors were allowed to incubate in the wells with various concentrations of test compound, in the presence of europium-labeled ligands. Following incubation, the wells are emptied and washed. The amount of europium-labeled ligand bound was determined by time-resolved fluorescence measurement. Assay of o4P7 is similar to the adhesion inhibition assay of VLA-4 described above, and uses the c4P7-expressing cell, RPMI-8886. A MAdCAM-1 IgG fusion protein containing the one and two immunoglobulin domains of human MAdCAM-1 and mucin-like repeat domain, is used as the corresponding ligand for o;4p7.<br>
Eu**-VCAM-l IgG binding to CHOA'LA-4 cells may be determined as follows, 4B4 cells (CHO/VLA-4 cells) are distributed into each well of a 96-well microtitcr plate ai 3 x lO'/well. The plate is incubated at 37°C, 5% CO, for 48 hours and then washed twice with washing buffer, then blot dried. 50 ^1 of the inhibitor solution diluted with assay buffer (2% DMSO final) is added to each well, followed by 50 ^! of Eu^-VCAM-l IgG diluted with assay buffer at 2 nM. The plate is incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min. Each well is then washed four times with washing buffer and blot dried. 100 ^1 of DELFIA Enhancement solution is added to each well, followed by agitation ofthe plate at room temperature for 5 min. Fluorescence of each sample is then measured (e.g., DELFIA Fluoromcter 1234, Wallace, Inc., USA). In this assay, the washing buffer comprises 25 mM HEPES (pH 7,5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCij, 1 mM MgCli,and 4 mM MnClj; the assay buffer comprises 25 mMHEPES(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaClj, I mM MgClj, 4 mM MnCl,, 1% BSA, and 20 tM DTPA.<br><br>
The ■VLA-4 inhibitors may be ftirther characterized in in vivo assays. One such assay examines the inJiibition o/eosinophil infiJiralion into Ihe bronchoalveolai lavage Add in the mouse (murine) model. In this assay, the animals are treated with cyclophosphamide on day 0, On days 2 and 14, the aniniaJs are immunized intraperitoneally with Ascans suum extract. Seven days later, the animals are treated with various doses of the ■VLA-4 inhibitor. Shortly after drug administration, the animaJs are chaJIenged vnthAscaris suum extract by instillation into the trachea, Bronchoalveolar lavage of the animal is performed by instilling saline into the lung, 48 hours later. Total ceil and eosinophil counts in the lavage are determined.<br>
In the murine model of-^Jcon&gt;induced bronchial inflanimation, one of the representative compounds (example number 32) inhibited eosinophil infiltration by 49% at an oral dosage of 30 mg/kg. By contrast, a representative prior art compound, 4-(A^-2-methylphenyIurea)phenylacctyI-LDVP-OH, described in WO 97/03094, did not inhibit eosinophil infiltration (% inhibition = -2%) at an oral dosage of 50 mg/kg.<br>
