				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
AIR-FUEL RATIO CONTROL APPARATUS FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for controlling the air-fuel ratio of an internal combustion engine, and more particularly to an air-fuel ratio control apparatus which is capable of evaluating the deteriorated state of a catalytic converter for purifying exhaust gases.<br>
Background art:<br>
Conventional processes of determining the deteriorated       state of a catalytic converter for purifying exhaust gases which  is disposed in the exhaust passage of an d    internal combustion engine are known from Japanese patent publication  No. 2,526,640 and Japanese laid-open patent<br>
  publication No. 7-19033, for example.<br>
The disclosed techniques are based on the fact that when the air-fuel ratio of an air-fuel mixture to be combusted by an internal combustion engine is changed from a leaner value to a richer value or from a richer value to a leaner value, the outputs from oxygen concentration sensors that are positioned respectively upstream and downstream of a catalytic converter combined with the internal<br><br>
combustion engine are inverted. More specifically, under certain operating conditions of the internal combustion engine, i.e., when the power output of the internal combustion engine is increased or the fuel supplied to the internal combustion engine is cut off as disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. 2,526,640 or when certain conditions are satisfied, e.g., the load and rotational speed of the internal combustion engine are in predetermined ranges as disclosed in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 7-19033, the air-fuel ratio is positively changed from a leaner value to a richer value or from a richer value to a leaner value. At this time, the time consumed after the output- of the upstream oxygen concentration sensor is inverted until the output of the downstream oxvgen concentration sensor is inverted, and the period at which output of the downstream oxygen concentration sensor is inverted are measured, and the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter is evaluated based on the measured values.<br>
According to these techniques, when the internal combustion engine is operating under ordinary conditions, i.e., conditions without estimating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter, the air-fuel ratio is feedback-controlled depending on the inversion of the outputs from the oxygen concentration sensors in order to keep the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine in the vicinity of a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, for thereby allow-<br><br>
ing the catalytic converter to keep an appropriate purifying capability.<br>
According to the above process of evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter, however, it is necessary to positively change the air-fuel ratio from a leaner value to a richer value or from a richer value to a leaner value in order to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter. Consequently, as long as the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine is feedback-controlled so as to allow the catalytic converter to keep an appropriate purifying capability, it is impossible to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter. Therefore, at the time of evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter, it is difficult for the catalytic converter to keep an appropriate purifying capability.<br>
The applicant of the present application has proposed another technique for achieving an appropriate purifying capability of a catalytic converter (see, for example, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 9-324681,<br>
       Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 11-153051, U.S. ,$      patent No. 5,852,930, and U.S. patent application No.<br><br>
      09/153300). According to the proposal, an exhaust gas sen-p |       sor for detecting the concentration of a certain component, e.g., oxygen, of exhaust gases is positioned downstream of the catalytic converter, and the air-fuel ratio of an air-<br>
fuel mixture to be combusted by an internal combustion engine is manipulated in order to converge the output of the exhaust gas sensor to a predetermined target value.<br>
More specifically, in order to converge the output (the detected value of the oxygen concentration) of the exhaust gas sensor to a predetermined target value (constant value), a target value (target air-fuel ratio) for the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gases that enter the catalytic converter, or specifically the air-fuel ratio recognized from the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gases, is successively calculated according to a sliding mode control process. The air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture to be combusted by an internal combustion engine is then manipulated depending on the target air-fuel ratio to achieve the appropriate purifying capability of the catalytic converter.<br>
Since the above proposed technique is capable of stably keeping the appropriate purifying capability of the catalytic converter by controlling the air-fuel ratio as described above, it is desirable to be able to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter while performing the above air-fuel control process.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for controlling the air-fuel ratio of an internal combustion engine, which is capable of appropriately evaluating the deteriorated state of a cata-<br>
lytic converter while keeping a desired purifying capability of the catalytic converter that is disposed in the exhaust passage of the internal combustion engine.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention:<br>
To achieve the above object, there is provided in accordance with the present invention an apparatus for controlling the air-fuel ratio of an internal combustion engine, comprising an exhaust gas sensor disposed downstream of a catalytic converter which is disposed in an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine, for detecting the concentration of a particular component of a exhaust gas emitted from the internal combustion engine and having passed through the catalytic converter, air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means for sequentially generating a manipulated variable to determine the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter to converge an output of the exhaust gas sensor to a predetermined target value, air-fuel ratio manipulating means for manipulating the air-fuel ratio of an air-fuel mixture to be combusted in the internal combustion engine depending on the manipulated variable, and deteriorated state evaluating means for sequentially determining the value of a deterioration evaluating linear function from time-series data of the output of the exhaust gas sensor, the deterioration evaluating linear function having variable compo-<br>
nents represented by the time-series data of the output of the exhaust gas sensor, and evaluating a deteriorated state of the catalytic converter based on the determined value of the deterioration evaluating linear function, while the air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture is being manipulated by the air-fuel ratio manipulating means.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found that while a manipulated variable for the air-fuel ratio (e.g., a target value for the air-fuel ratio) of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter to converge the output of the exhaust gas sensor downstream of the catalytic converter to a given target value is being sequentially generated and the air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture is being manipulated depending on the manipulated variable, when an appropriate linear function whose variable components are represented by time-series data of the output of the exhaust gas sensor, i.e., a linear function expressed as a linear coupling of the time-series data of the output of the exhaust gas sensor, is determined from the time-series data of the output of the exhaust gas sensor, the value of the linear function has a tendency to exhibit a characteristic correlation between itself and the degree to which the deterioration of the catalytic converter progresses.<br>
For example, when the catalytic converter is substantially brand-new, the value of the linear function<br><br>
tends to be accumulated in the vicinity of a certain value. As the deterioration of the catalytic converter progresses, the value of the linear function tends to go away from the certain value. Stated otherwise, as the deterioration of the catalytic converter progresses, the degree to which the value of the linear function varies becomes larger.<br>
The deteriorated state evaluating means employs the above linear function as the deterioration evaluating linear function, and sequentially determines the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function from the time-series data of the output of the exhaust gas sensor. The deteriorated state evaluating means determines the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter based on the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function.<br>
The value of the deterioration evaluating linear function as a basis for evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter is determined from time-series data of the output of the exhaust gas sensor while the air-fuel ratio manipulating means is manipulating the air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture depending on the manipulated variable that is generated by the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means in order to converge the output of the exhaust gas sensor to the target value.  Therefore, the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function is obtained while the air-fuel ratio is being ma-<br><br>
nipulated to maintain a desired purifying capability of the catalytic converter.<br>
Thus, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter can be evaluated while maintaining the desired purifying capability of the catalytic converter, by evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter based on the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function.<br>
In the present invention, the above tendency of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function depending on the degree to which the deterioration of the catalytic converter progresses is likely to be clear when the manipulated variable is generated by the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means according to a sliding mode control process as one feedback control process. If the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means comprises means for generating the manipulated variable according to the sliding mode control process, then the deterioration evaluating linear function which is highly correlated to the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter is closely related to a switching function used in the sliding mode control process. Therefore, a linear function determined depending on the switching function is preferably used as the deterioration evaluating linear function.<br>
More specifically, the sliding mode control process used by the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable<br><br>
generating means employs a linear function whose variable components are represented by time-series data of the difference between the output of the exhaust gas sensor and the target value, for example, as the switching function. If this switching function is used in the sliding mode control process, then the deterioration evaluating linear function preferably comprises a linear function which has coefficients of variable components that are identical to coefficients of the variable components of the switching function. The linear function may be the switching function itself for the sliding mode control process.<br>
With the linear function determined depending on the switching function for the sliding mode control process being used as the deterioration evaluating linear function, the correlation between the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function and the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter is manifested, allowing the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter to be evaluated appropriately based on the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function.<br>
Even if the manipulated variable is generated by any of various other feedback control processes including a PID (proportional plug integral plus derivative) control process, when a linear function similar to the switching function for the sliding mode control process is determined as the deterioration evaluating linear function, it is pos-<br><br>
sible to provide a correlation of the above tendency between the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function and the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter .<br>
According to the present invention, the deteriorated state evaluating means preferably comprises means for determining data representing the degree to which time-series data of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function vary, as a deterioration evaluating parameter from the time-series data of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function, and evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter based on the value of the determined deterioration evaluating parameter.<br>
Specifically, as the deterioration of the catalytic converter progresses, the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function is liable to change away from a certain value, resulting in a large variation of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function. According to the present invention, the data representing the degree to which the time-series data of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function vary is used as the deterioration evaluating parameter, and the deterioration evaluating parameter is determined from the time-series data of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function. When the deterioration evaluating parameter is thus determined, the correlation between its value and the<br><br>
deteriorated state of the catalytic converter is made clear, making it possible to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter more appropriately based on the value of the deterioration evaluating parameter.<br>
The deterioration evaluating parameter may comprise the square or absolute value of the difference between the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function and a predetermined value. Preferably, however, the deterioration evaluating parameter is determined by effecting a low-pass filtering process on the square or absolute value of the difference between each of the time-series data of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function and a predetermined value as a central value of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function.<br>
When the deterioration evaluating parameter is determined by effecting the low-pass filtering process on the square or absolute value of the difference, the value of the deterioration evaluating parameter is adequate as a value representing the degree to which the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function varies. As the deterioration of the catalytic converter increases, the value of the deterioration evaluating parameter increases monotonously, clearly indicating a correlation between itself and the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate the deteriorated state of<br><br>
the catalytic converter with high reliability based on the value of the deterioration evaluating parameter.<br>
The low-pass filtering process preferably comprises a filtering process according to a sequential statistic algorithm.<br>
By determining the deterioration evaluating parameter in the filtering process according to the sequential statistic algorithm, the deterioration evaluating parameter can be stored in a reduced memory capacity without the need for a memory for storing many data of the difference and its square or absolute value.<br>
The sequential statistic algorithm may preferably comprise a method of least squares, a method of weighted least squares, a degressive gain method, a fixed gain method, etc.<br>
The deterioration evaluating parameter increases monotonously as the deterioration of the catalytic converter progresses. Therefore, the deteriorated state evaluating means may comprise means for comparing the deterioration evaluating parameter with a predetermined threshold to determine whether the catalytic converter is deteriorated to an extent corresponding to the threshold or not.<br>
Depending on a change in the rate of flow of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter, it may not be possible to obtain the value of the deterioration evaluat-<br><br>
ing linear function or the value of the deterioration evaluating parameter which is suitable for evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter. Therefore, the deteriorated state evaluating means may comprise means for determining whether the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter is to be evaluated or not depending on a change in the rate of flow of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter.<br>
Specifically, when the rate of flow of the exhaust gas is maintained stably at a constant level, since disturbance are small, the output of the exhaust gas sensor is likely to be kept stably at the target value steadily according to the feedback control process such as the sliding mode control process.  In such a situation, even when the deterioration of the catalytic converter has progressed, the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function is apt to be accumulated near a certain value, making it difficult to distinguish the catalytic converter from a brand-new catalytic converter.<br>
To alleviate such a drawback, the deteriorated state evaluating means may comprise means for failing to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter if the rate of flow of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter is maintained at a substantially constant level, and evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter if the rate of flow of the exhaust gas en-<br><br>
taring the catalytic converter is not maintained at the substantially constant level.<br>
Since the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter is evaluated only when the rate of flow of the exhaust gas changes properly, i.e., when the rate of flow of the exhaust gas undergoes a certain variation, the evaluation of the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter is made highly reliable.<br>
The deteriorated state evaluating means may comprise means for failing to determine the deterioration evaluating parameter if the rate of flow of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter is maintained at a substantially constant level, and determining the deterioration evaluating parameter if the rate of flow of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter is not maintained at the substantially constant level. With this arrangement, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter can be evaluated using only the deterioration evaluating parameter that is calculated while the rate of flow of the exhaust gas is appropriate, and the evaluation of the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter is made highly reliable.<br>
The air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means may comprise estimating means for sequentially determining data representing an estimated value of the output of the exhaust gas sensor after a dead time of a<br><br>
system ranging from a position upstream of the catalytic converter to the exhaust gas sensor, and means for generating the manipulated variable using the data determined by the estimating means.<br>
Alternatively, the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means may comprise estimating means for sequentially determining data representing an estimated value of the output of the exhaust gas sensor after a total data time which is the sum of a dead time of a system ranging from a position upstream of the catalytic converter to the exhaust gas sensor and a dead time of a system comprising the air-fuel ratio manipulating system and the internal combustion engine, and means for generating the manipulated variable using the data determined by the estimating means.<br>
The system ranging from the position upstream of the catalytic converter to the exhaust gas sensor, i.e., a system for generating the output of the exhaust gas sensor from the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas determined by the manipulated variable (hereinafter referred to as "object exhaust system" ) , generally has a relatively long dead time due to the catalytic converter included in the object exhaust system. When the rotational speed of the internal combustion engine is comparatively low, the system comprising the air-fuel ratio manipulating system and the internal combustion engine, i.e., a system for generating the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic con-<br><br>
verter from the manipulated variable (hereinafter referred to as "air-fuel ratio manipulating system"), also has a relatively long dead time. These dead times should preferably be compensated for as they may possibly adversely affect the process of converting the output of the exhaust gas sensor to the target value.<br>
The estimating means determines data representing the estimated value of the output of the exhaust gas sensor after the dead time of the object exhaust system/ or data representing the estimated value of the output of the exhaust gas sensor after the total data time which is the sum of the above dead time and the dead time of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system, and the manipulated variable is generated using the data determined by the estimating means.<br>
Because the effect of the dead time can thus be compensated for, the process of converting the output of the exhaust gas sensor to the target value can well be performed. As a result, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter can be evaluated while well maintaining the desired purifying capability or performance of the catalytic converter.<br>
With the estimating means thus employed, the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means comprises means for generating the manipulated variable to converge the estimated value of the output of the exhaust<br><br>
gas sensor represented by the data determined by the estimating means to the target value, according to the sliding mode control process. The process of converting the output of the exhaust gas sensor to the target value is thus performed highly stably, and hence the desired purifying capability of the catalytic converter can be maintained stably.<br>
The data representing the estimated value of the output of the exhaust gas sensor can be generated using the output of the exhaust gas sensor and the manipulated variable generated in the past by the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means or the detected value of the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas upstream of the catalytic converter which depends on the manipulated variable.<br>
The sliding mode control piocess comprises an adaptive sliding mode control process.<br>
The adaptive sliding mode control process is a combination of an ordinary sliding mode control process and a control law referred to as an adaptive law (adaptive algorithm) . When the manipulated variable is generated according to the adaptive sliding mode control process, the reliability of the manipulated variable is increased, allowing the output of the exhaust gas sensor to be converged to the target value with a quick response. The effect of a simple disturbance other than the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter on the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function determined depending on the<br><br>
switching function for the sliding mode control process is suppressed. Consequently, the reliability of the evaluation of the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter based on the deterioration evaluating parameter which represents the degree to which the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function varies is increased.<br>
The manipulated variable generated by the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means comprises a target air-fuel ratio for the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter, and the apparatus further comprises an air-fuel ratio sensor disposed upstream of the catalytic converter for detecting the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter, the air-fuel ratio manipulating means comprising means for manipulating the air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture according to a feedback control process to converge the output of the air-fuel ratio sensor to the target air-fuel ratio.<br>
With the manipulated variable comprising the target air-fuel ratio for the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter, the output of the air-fuel ratio sensor which detects the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter, i.e., the detected value of the air-fuel ratio, is feedback-controlled at the target air-fuel ratio. Therefore, the output of the exhaust gas sensor can well be converged to the target value, and hence<br><br>
the desired purifying capability of the catalytic converter can well be maintained.<br>
The manipulated variable may comprise a corrective quantity for the amount of fuel supplied to the internal combustion engine, for example, other than the target air-fuel ratio.  The air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture may be manipulated depending on the manipulated variable<br>
according to a feed-forward control process based on the<br>
&gt;<br>
manipulated variable.  For maintaining the optimum purifying capability of the catalytic converter and evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter, the exhaust gas sensor should preferably be an oxygen concentration sensor, i.e., an 02 sensor, and a target value therefor should preferably be a constant value.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided, an apparatus for controlling the air-fuel ratio of an internal combustion engine, comprising:<br>
an exhaust gas sensor disposed downstream of a catalytic converter which is disposed in an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine, for detecting the concentration of a particular component of a exhaust gas emitted from the internal combustion engine and having passed through the catalytic converter; air-fuel ratio manipulated variable generating means for sequentially generating a manipulated variable to determine the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas entering said catalytic converter to converge an output of said exhaust gas sensor to a predetermined target value for keeping an appropriate purifying capability of the catalytic converter;<br>

Best mode for carrying out the invention:<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIGS. 1 through 19.<br>
FIG. 1 shows in block form the apparatus according to the embodiment. As shown in FIG. 1, an internal combustion engine 1 such as a four-cylinder internal combustion engine is mounted as a propulsion source on an automobile or a hybrid vehicle, for example. When a mixture of fuel and air is combusted in each cylinder of the internal combustion engine 1, an exhaust gas is generated and emitted from each cylinder into a common discharge pipe 2 positioned near the internal combustion engine 1, from which the exhaust gas is discharged into the atmosphere. Two three-way catalytic converters 3, 4 are mounted in the common exhaust pipe 2 at successively downstream locations thereon.<br>
The upstream catalytic converter 3 is evaluated for its deteriorated state according to the present invention. The downstream catalytic converter 4 may be dispensed with.<br>
The apparatus serves to control the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter 3, or specifically the air-fuel ratio recognized from the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter 3 (hereinafter referred to as the "air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine") in order to achieve an optimum purifying capability of the catalytic converter 3. While controlling the air-fuel ratio, the apparatus also evaluates the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3.<br>
In order to perform the above processing, the apparatus has an air-fuel ratio sensor 5 mounted on the exhaust pipe 2 upstream of the catalytic converter 3, or more precisely at a position where exhaust gases from the cylinders of the internal combustion engine 1 are put together, an 02 sensor (oxygen concentration sensor) 6 mounted as an exhaust gas sensor on the exhaust pipe 2 downstream of the catalytic converter 3 and upstream of the catalytic converter 4, and a control unit 7 for carrying out a control process (described later on) and evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 based on detected outputs from the sensors 5, 6.<br>
The control unit 7 is supplied with detected outputs from the sensors 5, 6 and also detected outputs from various other sensors for detecting operating conditions of the internal combustion engine 1, including a engine speed sensor, an intake pressure sensor, a coolant temperature sensor, etc.<br>
The 02 sensor 6 comprises an ordinary 02 sensor for generating an output V02/OUT having a level depending on the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas that has passed through the catalytic converter 3, i.e., an output V02/OUT representing a detected value of the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas. The oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is commensurate with the air-fuel ratio of an air-fuel mixture which, when combusted, produces the exhaust gas. The output V02/OUT from the 02 sensor 6 will change with high sensitivity in proportion to the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas, with the air-fuel ratio corresponding to the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas being in a range A close to a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, as indicated by the solid-line curve a in FIG. 2. At oxygen concentrations corresponding to air-fuel ratios outside of the range Δ the output V02/OUT from the 02 sensor 6 is saturated and is of a substantially constant level.<br>
The air-fuel ratio sensor 5 generates an output KACT representing a detected value of the air-fuel ratio of<br><br>
the internal combustion engine 1 which is recognized from the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas that enters the catalytic converter 3. The air-fuel ratio sensor 5 comprises a wide-range air-fuel ration sensor disclosed in detail in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 4-369471, which corresponds to U.S. patent No. 5,391,282. As indicated by the solid-line curve b in FIG. 2, the air-fuel ratio sensor 5 generates an output whose level is proportional to the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas in a wider range than the 02 sensor 6.  Stated otherwise, the air-fuel ratio sensor 5 (hereinafter referred to as "LAP sensor 5") generates an output whose level corresponding to the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas in a wide rangs of air-fuel ratios.<br>
The control unit 7 comprises a control unit 7a (hereinafter referred to as an "exhaust-side control unit 7a") for performing a process of calculating a target air-fuel ratio KCMD as a manipulated variable for determining the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1 and carrying out a process of evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3, and a control unit 7b (hereinafter referred to as an "engine-side control unit 7b") for carryout out a process of controlling the air-fuel ratio of an air-fuel ratio to be combusted in the internal combustion engine 1 based on the target air-fuel ratio KCMD by adjusting the fuel injection quantity (fuel supply quantity) of<br><br>
the internal combustion engine 1 depending on the target air-fuel ratio KCMD.<br>
The control units 7a, 7b comprise a microcomputer, and perform their respective control processes in given control cycles. In the present embodiment, each of the control cycles in which the exhaust-side control unit 7a performs its processes of generating the target air-fuel ratio KCMD and evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 has a predetermined period (e.g., ranging from 30 to 100 ms) in view of the dead time (described later on) present in the catalytic converter 3, calculating loads, etc.<br>
The process of adjusting the fuel injection quantity, which is carried out by the engine-side control unit 7b, needs to be in synchronism with the rotational speed of the internal combustion engine 1, or more specifically combustion cycles of the internal combustion engine 1. Therefore, each of the control cycles in which the engine-side control unit 7b performs its process has a period in synchronism with the crankshaft angle period (so-called TDC) of the internal combustion engine 1.<br>
The constant period of the control cycles of the exhaust-side control unit 7a is longer than the crankshaft angle period (so-called TDC) of the internal combustion engine 1.<br><br>
The engine-side control unit 7b will further be described below with reference to FIG. 1. The engine-side control unit 7b has, as its main functions, a basic fuel injection quantity calculator 8 for determining a basic fuel injection quantity Tim to be injected into the internal combustion engine I, a first correction coefficient calculator 9 for determining a first correction coefficient KTOTAL to correct the basic fuel injection quantity Tim, and a second correction coefficient calculator 10 for determining a second correction coefficient KCMDM to correct the basic fuel injection quantity Tim.<br>
The basic fuel injection quantity calculator 8 determines a reference fuel injection quantity (fuel supply quantity) from the rotational speed NE and intake pressure PB of the internal combustion engine 1 using a predetermined map, and corrects the determined reference fuel injection quantity depending on the effective opening area of a throttle valve (not shown) of the internal combustion engine 1, thereby calculating a basic fuel injection quantity Tim.<br>
The first correction coefficient KTOTAL determined by the first correction coefficient calculator 9 serves to correct the basic fuel injection quantity Tim in view of an exhaust gas recirculation ratio of the internal combustion engine 1, i.e., the proportion of an exhaust gas contained in an air-fuel mixture introduced into the internal combustion engine 1, an amount of purged fuel supplied<br><br>
to the internal combustion engine 1 when a canister (not shown) is purged, a coolant temperature, an intake temperature, etc.<br>
The second correction coefficient KCMDM determined by the second correction coefficient calculator 10 serves to correct the basic fuel injection quantity Tim in view of the charging efficiency of an air-fuel mixture due to the cooling effect of fuel flowing into the internal combustion engine 1 depending on a target air-fuel ratio KCMD determined by the exhaust-side control unit 7a, as described later on.<br>
The engine-side control unit 7b corrects the basic fuel injection quantity Tim with the first correction coefficient KTOTAL and the second correction coefficient KCMDM by multiplying the basic fuel injection quantity Tim by the first correction coefficient KTOTAL and the second correction coefficient KCMDM, thus producing a demand fuel injection quantity Tcyl for the internal combustion engine 1.<br>
Specific details of processes for calculating the basic fuel injection quantity Tim, the first correction coefficient KTOTAL, and the second correction coefficient KCMDM are disclosed in detail in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 5-79374 and U.S. patent No. 5,253,630, and will not be described below.<br><br>
The engine-side control unit 7b also has, in addition to the above functions, a feedback controller 14 for feedback-controlling the air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture to be combusted in the internal combustion engine 1 by adjusting a fuel injection quantity of the internal combustion engine 1 so as to converge the output KACT of the LAP sensor 5 (the detected air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1) toward the target air-fuel ratio KCMD which is calculated by the exhaust-side control unit 7a.<br>
The feedback controller 14 comprises a general feedback controller 15 for feedback-controlling a total fuel injection quantity for all the cylinders of the internal combustion engine 1 and a local feedback controller 16 for feedback-controlling a fuel injection quantity for each of the cylinders of the internal combustion engine 1.<br>
The general feedback controller 15 sequentially determines a feedback correction coefficient KFB to correct the demand fuel injection quantity Tcyl (by multiplying the demand fuel injection quantity Tcyl) so as to converge the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5 toward the target air-fuel ratio KCMD.<br>
The general feedback controller 15 comprises a PID controller 17 for generating a feedback manipulated variable KLAF as the feedback correction coefficient KFB depending on the difference between the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5 and the target air-fuel ratio KCMD according to<br><br>
a known PID control process, and an adaptive controller 18 (indicated by "STR" in FIG. 1) for adaptively determining a feedback manipulated variable KSTR for determining the feedback correction coefficient KFB in view of changes in operating conditions of the internal combustion engine 1 or characteristic changes thereof from the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5 and the target air-fuel ratio KCMD.<br>
In the present embodiment, the feedback manipulated variable KLAF generated by the PID controller 17 is of "1" and can be used directly as the feedback correction coefficient KFB when the output KACT (the detected air-fuel ratio) from the LAF sensor 5 is equal to the target air-fuel ratio KCMD. The feedback manipulated variable KSTR generated by the adaptive controller 18 becomes the target air-fuel ratio KCMD when the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5 is equal to the target air-fuel ratio KCMD. A feedback manipulated variable kstr (= KSTR/KCMD) which is produced by dividing the feedback manipulated variable KSTR by the target air-fuel ratio KCMD with a divider 19 can be used as the feedback correction coefficient KFB.<br>
The feedback manipulated variable KLAF generated by the PID controller 17 and the feedback manipulated variable kstr which is produced by dividing the feedback manipulated variable KSTR from the adaptive controller 18 by the target air-fuel ratio KCMD are selected one at a time by a switcher 20. A selected one of the feedback manipulated<br><br>
variable KLAF and the feedback manipulated variable KSTR is used as the feedback correction coefficient KFB. The demand fuel injection quantity Tcyl is corrected by being multiplied by the feedback correction coefficient KFB. Details of the general feedback controller 15 (particularly, the adaptive controller 18) will be described later on.<br>
The local feedback controller 16 comprises an observer 21 for estimating real air-fuel ratios #nA/F (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) of the respective cylinders from the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5, and a plurality of PID controllers 22 (as many as the number of the cylinders) for determining respective feedback correction coefficients #nKLAF for fuel injection quantities for the cylinders from the respective real air-fuel ratios #nA/F estimated by the observer 21 according to a PID control process so as to eliminate variations of the air-fuel ratios of the cylinders.<br>
Briefly stated, the observer 21 estimates a real air-fuel ratio #nA/F of each of the cylinders as follows: A system from the internal combustion engine 1 to the LAF sensor 5 (where the exhaust gases from the cylinders are combined) is considered to be a system for generating an air-fuel ratio detected by the LAF sensor 5 from a real air-fuel ratio #nA/F of each of the cylinders, and is modeled in view of a detection response delay (e.g., a time lag of first order) of the LAF sensor 5 and a chronological contribution of the air-fuel ratio of each of the cylinders to the air-<br><br>
fuel ratio detected by the LAP sensor 5. Based on the modeled system, a real air-fuel ratio #nA/F of each of the cylinders is estimated from the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5.<br>
Details of the observer 21 are disclosed in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 7-83094 and U.S. patent No. 5,531,208, and will not be described below.<br>
Each of the PID controllers 22 of the local feedback controller 16 divides the output signal KACT from the LAF sensor 5 by an average value of the feedback correction coefficients #nKLAF determined by the respective PID controllers 22 in a preceding control cycle to produce a quotient value, and uses the quotient value as a target air-fuel ratio for the corresponding cylinder. Each of the PID controllers 22 then determines a feedback correction coefficient #nKLAF in a present control cycle so as to eliminate any difference between the target air-fuel ratio and the corresponding real air-fuel ratio #nA/F determined by the observer 21.<br>
The local feedback controller 16 multiplies a value, which has been produced by multiplying the demand fuel injection quantity Tcyl by the selected feedback correction coefficient KFB produced by the general feedback controller 15, by the feedback correction coefficient #nKLAF for each of the cylinders, thereby determining an output<br><br>
fuel injection quantity #nTout (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) for each of the cylinders.<br>
The output fuel injection quantity #nTout thus determined for each of the cylinders is corrected for accumulated fuel particles on intake pipe walls of the internal combustion engine 1 by a fuel accumulation corrector 23 in the engine-side control unit 7b. The corrected output fuel injection quantity #nTout is applied to each of fuel injectors (not shown) of the internal combustion engine 1, which injects fuel into each of the cylinders with the corrected output fuel injection quantity #nTout.<br>
The correction of the output fuel injection quantity in view of accumulated fuel particles on intake pipe walls is disclosed in detail in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 8-21273 and U.S. patent No. 5,568,799, and will not be described in detail below.<br>
A sensor output selector 24 shown in FIG. 1 serves to select the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5, which is suitable for the estimation of a real air-fuel ratio #nA/F of each cylinder with the observer 21, depending on the operating conditions of the internal combustion engine 1. Details of the sensor output selector 24 are disclosed in detail in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 7-259588 and U.S. patent No. 5,540,209, and will not be described in detail below.<br><br>
The exhaust-side control unit 7a has a subtracter 11 for determining a difference kact (= KACT -FLAF/BASE) between the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5 and a predetermined reference value FLAF/BASE and a sub-tractor 12 for determining a difference V02 (= V02/OUT -VO2/TARGET) between the output V02/OUT from the 02 sensor 6 and a target value VO2/TARGET therefor.<br>
The catalytic converter 3 achieves an optimum purifying capability irrespective of its deteriorated state at the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1 which causes the output V02/OUT from the 02 sensor 6 to settle on a certain constant value V02/TARGET (see FIG. 2). In the present embodiment, therefore, the constant value V02/TARGET is used as the target value V02/TARGET for the output V02/OUT from the 02 sensor 6. The reference value FLAF/BASE with respect to the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5 is set to a "stoichiometric air-fuel ratio".<br>
The differences kact, V02 determined respectively by the subtracters 11, 12 are referred to as a differential output kact of the LAF sensor 5 and a differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6, respectively.<br>
The exhaust-side control unit 7a also has an exhaust-side main processor 13 which is supplied with the data of the differential outputs kact, V02 as the data of the output from the LAF sensor 5 and the output of the 02 sensor 6.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the exhaust-side main processor 13 comprises, as its functions, a target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a as an air-fuel ratio manipulated variable determining means for sequentially determining a target air-fuel ratio KCMD for the internal combustion engine 1 based on the data of the differential outputs kact, VO2, and a deteriorated state evaluating means 13b for evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 based on the data of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6.<br>
The target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a serves to control an object exhaust system (denoted by E in FIG. I) including the catalytic converter 3, which ranges from the LAF sensor 5 to the 02 sensor 6 along the exhaust pipe 2. The target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a sequentially determines the target air-fuel ratio KCMD for the internal combustion engine 1 so as to converge the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to the target value VO2/TARGET therefor according to a sliding mode control process, or specifically an adaptive sliding mode control process, in view of a dead time present in the object exhaust system E to be controlled, a dead time present in the internal combustion engine 1 and the engine-side control unit 7b, and behavioral changes of the object exhaust system E.<br><br>
The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b serves to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 based on the value of a deterioration evaluating linear function, described later on, which is determined from time-series data of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6, and control the operation of a deterioration indicator 29 connected to the air-fuel ratio control apparatus depending on the evaluation of the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3. The deterioration indicator 29 may comprise a lamp, a buzzer, or a display unit for displaying characters, a graphic image, etc. to indicate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3.<br>
The target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a and the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b will further be described below.<br>
In order to carry out the process of the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a, according to present embodiment, the object exhaust system E is regarded as a system for generating the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 (the detected value of the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas having passed through the catalytic converter 3) from the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 (the detected value of the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1) via a dead time element and a response delay element, and the behavior of the system is modeled as a discrete time system.<br><br>
In addition, the system comprising the internal combustion engine 1 and the engine-side control unit 7b is regarded as a system (hereinafter referred to as "air-fuel ratio manipulating system") for generating the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 from the target air-fuel ratio KCMD via a dead time element, and the behavior of this system is modeled as a discrete time system.<br>
The model (hereinafter referred to as "exhaust system model") in which the behavior of the object exhaust system E is expressed as a discrete time system is expressed, using the differential output kact (= KACT -FLAP/BASE) from the LAF sensor 5 and the differential output V02 (= V02/OUT - V02/TARGET) from the 02 sensor 6, instead of the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 and the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6, according to the following equation (1):<br>
V02(k+l) = al.V02(k)+a2'V02(k-l)+bl'kact(k-dl) (1)<br>
According to the equation (1), the object exhaust system E is regarded as a system for generating the differential output V02 from the 02 sensor 6 from the differential output kact from the LAF sensor 5 via a dead time element and a response delay element, and expresses the behavior of the object exhaust system E with the model of a discrete time system (more specifically, an autoregressive model having a dead time in the differential output kact as an input to the exhaust system<br><br>
In the equation (1), "k" represents the ordinal number of a discrete-time control cycle of the exhaust-side control unit 7a, and "dl" the dead time (more specifically, the dead time required until the air-fuel ratio detected at each point of time by the LAP sensor 5 is reflected in the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6) of the object exhaust system E as represented by the number of control cycles. The dead time of the object exhaust system E is generally equal to the time of 3 - 10 control cycles (dl = 3 - 10) if the period (constant in the present embodiment) of control cycles of the exhaust-side control unit 7a ranges from 30 to 100 ms.  In the present embodiment, a preset constant value (dl = 7, for example) which is equal to or slightly longer than the actual dead time of the object exhaust system E is used as the dead time dl in the discrete-system model of the object exhaust system E as represented by the equation (1).<br>
The first and second terms of the right side of the equation (1) correspond to a response delay element of the object exhaust system E, the first term being a primary autoregressive term and the second term being a secondary autoregressive term.  In the first and second terms, "al", "a2" represent respective gain coefficients of the primary autoregressive term and the secondary autoregressive term. Stated otherwise, these gain coefficients al, a2 are rela-<br><br>
tive to the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6 as an output of the control system E.<br>
The third term of the right side of the equation (1) represents the differential output kact of the LAP sensor 5 as an input to the object exhaust system E, including the dead time dl of the object exhaust system E.  In the third term, "bl" represents a gain coefficient relative to the input to the object exhaust system E, i.e., the differential output kact of the LAF sensor 5. These gain coefficients "al", "a2", "bl" are parameters which define the behavior of the exhaust system model, and are sequentially identified by an identifier which will be described later on.<br>
The model (hereinafter referred to as "air-fuel ratio manipulating system model") of the discrete time system of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system which comprises the internal combustion engine 1 and the engine-side control unit 7b is expressed, using the differential output kact (= KACT - FLAP/BASE) from the LAF sensor 5 instead of the output KACT from the LAF sensor 5 and also using a difference kcmd (= KCMD - FLAF/BASE, which corresponds to a target value for the differential output kact of the LAF sensor 5, and will be referred to as "target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd") between the target air-fuel ratio KCMD and the reference value FLAF/BASE instead of the tar-<br><br>
get air-fuel ratio KCMD, according to the following equation (2):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The equation (2) expresses the air-fuel ratio manipulating system as the model of a discrete time system, regarding the air-fuel ratio manipulating system as a system for generating the differential output kact from the LAP sensor 5 from the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd via a dead time element, i.e., a system in which the differential output kact in each control cycle is equal to the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd prior to the dead time.<br>
In the equation (2), "d2" represents the dead tima of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system (more specifically, the time required until the target air-fuel ratio KCMD at each point of time is reflected in the output signal KACT of the LAF sensor 5) in terms of the number of control cycles of the exhaust-side control unit 7a. The dead time of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system varies with the rotational speed NE of the internal combustion engine lr and is longer as the rotational speed NE of the internal combustion engine 1 is lower.  In the present embodiment, in view of the above characteristics of the dead time of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system, a preset constant value (for example, d2 = 3) which is equal to or slightly longer than the actual dead time of the air-fuel<br><br>
ratio manipulating system at an idling rotational speed of the internal combustion engine 1, which is a rotational speed in a low speed range of the internal combustion engine 1 (the actual dead time is a maximum dead time which can be taken by the air-fuel ratio manipulating system at an arbitrary rotational speed of the internal combustion engine 1), used as the value of the dead time d2 in the air-fuel ratio manipulating system model expressed by the equation (2).<br>
The air-fuel ratio manipulating system actually includes a dead time element and a response delay element of the internal combustion engine 1.  Since a response delay of the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 with respect to the target air-fuel ratio KCMD is basically compensated for by the feedback controller 14 (particularly the adaptive controller 18) of the engine-side control unit 7b, there will arise no problem if a response delay element of the internal combustion engine 1 is not taken into account in the air-fuel ratio manipulating system as viewed from the exhaust-side control unit 7a.<br>
The target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a of the exhaust-side main processor 13 carries out the process for calculating the target air-fuel ratio KCMD based on the exhaust system model and the air-fuel ratio manipulating system model expressed respectively by the equations (1), (2) in constant control cycles of the exhaust-side<br><br>
control unit 7a.  In order to carry out the above process, the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a has its functions as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a comprises an identifier 25 for sequentially determining in each control cycle identified values al hat, a2 hat, bl hat of the gain coefficients al, a2, bl (hereinafter referred to as "identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat") that are parameters to be established for the exhaust system model (the equation (1)), an estimator 26 for sequentially determining in each control cycle an estimated value V02 bar of the differential output V02 from the 02 sensor 6 (hereinafter referred to as "estimated differential output V02 bar") after the total dead time d (= dl + d2) which is the sum of the dead time dl of the object exhaust system E and the dead time d2 of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system, and a sliding mode controller 27 for sequentially determining in each control cycle a target air-fuel ratio KCMD according to an adaptive slide mode control process.<br>
The algorithm of a processing operation to be carried out by the identifier 25, the estimator 26, and the sliding mode controller 27 is constructed as follows:<br>
The identifier 25 serves to identify the gain coefficients al, a2, bl sequentially on a real-time basis for the purpose of minimizing a modeling error of the actu-<br><br>
al object exhaust system E of the exhaust system model expressed by the equation (1). The identifier 25 carries out its identifying process as follows:<br>
In each control cycle, the identifier 25 determines an identified value V02(k) hat of the differential output V02 (the output of the exhaust system model) from the 02 sensor 6 (hereinafter referred to as "identified differential output V02(k) hat") on the exhaust system model, using the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat of the presently established exhaust system model, i.e., identified gain coefficients al(k-l) hat, a2(k-l) hat, bl(k-l) hat determined in a preceding control cycle, and past data kact(k-dl-l), V02(k-l), V02(k-2) of the differential output kact from the LAF sensor 5 and the differential output V02 from the 02 sensor 6, according to the following equation (3):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The equation (3) corresponds to the equation (1) which is shifted into the past by one control cycle with the gain coefficients al, a2, bl being replaced with the respective identified gain coefficients al(k-l) hat, a2(k-1) hat, bl(k-l) hat. The constant value (dl = 7) established as described above is used as the value of the dead time dl of the object exhaust system E in the third term of the equation (3).<br><br>
If vectors 0, - defined by the following equations (4), (5) are introduced (the letter T in the equations (4), (5) represents a transposition), then the equation (3) is expressed by the equation (6):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The identifier 25 also determines a difference id/e(k) between the identified differential output V02(k) hat from the 02 sensor 6 which is determined by the equation (3) or (6) and the present differential output V02(k) from the 02 sensor 6, as representing a modeling error of the exhaust system model with respect to the actual object exhaust system E (hereinafter the difference id/e will be referred to as "identified error id/e"), according to the following equation (7):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The identifier 25 further determines new identified gain coefficients al(k) hat, a2(k) hat, bl(k) hat, stated otherwise, a new vector 0(k) having these identified gain coefficients as elements (hereinafter the new vector 0(k) will be referred to as "identified gain coefficient vector 0"), in order to minimize the identified error id/e, according to the equation (8) given below. That is, the identifier 25 varies the identified gain coefficients al hat (k-1), a2 hat (k-1), bl hat (k-1) determined in the<br><br>
of weighted least squares, a method of least squares, a fixed tracing method, etc. may be employed. According to the present embodiment, a method of least squares (^ = X2 = 1), for example, is employed.<br>
Basically, the identifier 25 sequentially determines in each control cycle the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat of the exhaust system model in order to minimize the identified error id/e according to the above algorithm (calculating operation). Through this operation, it is possible to sequentially obtain the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat which match the actual object exhaust system E.<br>
The algorithm described above is the basic algorithm that is carried out by the identifier 25.<br>
The estimator 26 sequentially determines in each control cycle the estimated differential output V02 bar which is an estimated value of the differential output VO2 from the 02 sensor 6 after the total dead time d (= dl + d2) in order to compensate for the effect of the dead time dl of the object exhaust system E and the effect of the dead time d2 of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system for the calculation of the target air-fuel ratio KCMD with the sliding mode controller 27 as described in detail later on. The algorithm for the estimator 26 to determine the estimated differential output V02 bar is constructed as follows:<br><br>

If the equation (2) expressing the model of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system is applied to the equation (1) expressing the model of the object exhaust system E, then the equation (1) can be rewritten as the following equation (11):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 (11) The equation (11) expresses the behavior of a system which is a combination of the object exhaust system E and the air-fuel manipulating system as the model of a discrete time system, regarding such a system as a system for generating the differential output V02 from the 02 sensor 6 from the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd via dead time elements of the object exhaust system E and the air-fuel manipulating system and a response delay element of the object exhaust system E.<br>
By using the equation (11), the estimated differential output V02(k+d) bar which is an estimated value of thfc differential output V02(k+d) of the 02 sensor 6 after the total dead time d in each control cycle can be expressed using time-series data V02(k), V02(k-l) of present and past values of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6 and time-series data kcmd(k-j) (j = 1, 2, •••, d) of the past values of the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd (= KCMD - FLAP/BASE) which corresponds to the target air-fuel ratio KCMD determined by the sliding mode con-<br><br>

In the equation (12), "αl", "α2" represent the first-row, first-column element and the first-row, second-column element, respectively, of the dth power Ad (d: total dead time) of the matrix A defined as described above with respect to the equation (12), and "βj" (j = 1, 2, •••, d) represents the first-row elements of the product Aj-1 of the (j-l)th power Aj-1 (j = 1, 2, •••, d) of the matrix A and the vector B defined as described above with respect to the equation (12).<br>
Of the time-series data of the past values of the target combined differential air-fuel ratio kcmd according to the equation (12), the time-series data kcmd(k-<br>
d2), kcmd(k-d2-l), •••, kcmd(k-d) from the present prior to the dead time d2 of the air-fuel manipulating system can be replaced respectively with data kact(k), kact(k-l), •••, kact(k-d+d2) obtained prior to the present time of the differential output kact of the LAF sensor 5. When the time-series data are thus replaced, the following equation (13) is obtained:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The equation (13) is a basic formula for the estimator 26 to determine the estimated differential output V02(k+d) bar. Stated otherwise, the estimator 26 determines, in each control cycle, the estimated differential output VG2(k+d) bar of the 02 sensor 6 according to the equation (13), using the time-series data V02(k), V02(k-l) of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6, the time-series data kcmd(k-j) (j = 1, •••, d2-l) of the past values of the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd which represents the target air-fuel ratio KCMD determined in the past by the sliding mode controller 27, and the time-series data kact(k-i) (i = 0, •••, dl) of the present and past values of the differential output kact of the LAF sensor 5.<br>
In the present embodiment, the values of the coefficients al, 0.2, pj (j = I, 2, •••, d) required to calculate the estimated differential output V02(k+d) bar according to the equation (13) are basically calculated using the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat which are the identified values of the gain coefficients al, a2, bl (which are elements of the vectors A, B defined with respect to the equation (12)). The values of the dead times dl, d2 required in the equation (13) comprise the preset values as described above.<br>
The estimated differential output V02(k+d) bar may be determined according to the equation (12) without using the data of the differential output kact of the LAF sensor 5. For increasing the reliability of the estimated differential output V02(k+d) bar, however, it is preferable to determine the estimated differential output V02(k+d) bar according to the equation (13) using the data of the differential output kact of the LAF sensor 5 which reflects the actual behavior ol the internal combustion engine 1. If the dead time d2 of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system can be set to "1", all the time-series data kcmd(k-j) (j = 1, 2, •••, d) of the past values of the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd in the equation (12) may be replaced with the time-series data kact(k), kact(k-l), •••, kact(k-d+d2), respectively, prior to the present time, of the differential output kact of the LAF sensor 5.  In this<br><br>
case, the estimated differential output V02(k+d) bar can be determined according to the following equation (14) which does not include the data of the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd:<br>

The sliding mode controller 27 will be described in detail below.<br>
The sliding mode controller 27 determines an input quantity to be given to the object exhaust system E (which is specifically a target value for the difference between the output KACT of the LAP sensor 5 (the detected value of the air-fuel ratio) and the reference value FLAF/BASE, which target value is equal to the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd) (the input quantity will be referred to as "SLD manipulating input Usl") in order to cause the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to settle on the target value V02/TARGET, i.e., to converge the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6 to "0" according to an adaptive sliding mode control process which incorporates an adaptive control law for minimizing the effect of a disturbance, in a normal sliding mode control process, and determines the target air-fuel ratio KCMD from the determined SLD manipulating input Usl. An algorithm for carrying out<br><br>
the adaptive sliding mode control process is constructed as follows:<br>
A switching function required for the algorithm of the adaptive sliding mode control process carried out by the sliding mode controller 27 and a hyperplane defined by<br>
the switching function (also referred to as a slip plane) will first be described below.<br>
According to a basic concept of the sliding mode control process, the differential output V02(k) of the 02 sensor 6 obtained in each control cycle and the differential output V02(k-l) obtained in a preceding control cycle are used as a state quantity to be controlled (controlled quantity), and a switching function a for the sliding mode control process is defined as a linear function whose variable components are represented by the differential outputs V02(k), V02(k-l) according to the following equation (15):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
A vector X defined above with respect to the equation (15) as a vector whose elements are represented by<br><br>
the differential outputs V02(k), V02(k-l) will hereinafter be referred to as a state quantity X.<br>
The coefficients si, s2 of the switching function a is set in order to meet the condition of the following equation (16):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
In the present embodiment, for the sake of brevity, the coefficient si is set to si = 1 (s2/sl = s2), and the coefficient s2 is established to satisfy the condition: -1 
With the switching function a thus defined, the hyperplane for the sliding mode control process is defined by the equation a = 0. Since the state quantity X is of the second degree, the hyperplane a = 0 is represented by a straight line as shown in FIG. 4. At this time, the hyperplane is called a switching line or a switching plane depending on the degree of a topological space.<br>
In the present embodiment, the time-series data of the estimated differential output V02 bar determined by the estimator 26 is used as the variable components of the switching function for the sliding mode control process, as described later on.<br><br>
The adaptive sliding mode control process serves to converge the state quantity X onto the hyperplane o = 0 according to a reaching control law which is a control law for converging the state quantity X (= V02(k), V02(k-l)) onto the hyperplane a = 0, and an adaptive control law (adaptive algorithm) which is a control law for compensating for the effect of a disturbance in converging the state quantity X onto the hyperplane a = 0 (mode 1 in FIG. 4). While holding the state quantity X onto the hyperplane o = 0 according to an equivalent control input, the state quantity X is converged to a balanced point on the hyperplane a = 0 where V02(k) = V02(k-l) = 0, i.e., a point where time-series data V02/OUT(k), V02/OUT(k-l) of the output VO2/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 are equal to the target value V02/TARGET (mode 2 in FIG. 4).<br>
The SLD manipulating input Usl (= the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd) to be generated by the sliding mode controller 27 for converging the state quantity X toward the balanced point on the hyperplane o = 0 is expressed as the sum of an equivalent control input Ueq to be applied to the object exhaust system E according to the control law for converging the state quantity X onto the hyperplane a = 0, an input Urch (hereinafter referred to as "reaching control law input Urch") to be applied to the object exhaust system E according to the reaching control law, and an input Uadp (hereinafter referred to as "adaptive con-<br><br>
trol law Uadp" ) to be applied to the object exhaust system E according to the adaptive control law (see the following equation (17)).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The equivalent control input Ueq, the reaching control law input Urch, and the adaptive control law input Uadp are determined on the basis of the model of the discrete time system expressed by the equation (11), i.e., the model in which the differential output kact(k-dl) of the LAP sensor 5 in the equation (11) is replaced with the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd(k-d) using the total dead time 3, as follows:<br>
The equivalent control input Ueq which is an input component to be applied to the object exhaust system E for converging the state quantity X onto the hyperplane o = 0 is the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd which satisfies the condition: σ(k+l) = σ(k) = 0. Using the equations (11), (15), the equivalent control input Ueq which satisfies the above condition is given by the following equation (18): <br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br><br>
The equation (18) is a basic formula for determining the equivalent control law input Ueq(k) in each control cycle.<br>
According to the present embodiment, the reaching control law input Urch is basically determined according to the following equation (19)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Specifically, the reaching control law input Urch is determined in proportion to the value σ(k+d) of the switching function a after the total dead time d, in view of the effect of the total dead time d.<br>
The coefficient F in the equation (19) which determines the gain of the reaching control law is established to satisfy the condition expressed by the following equation (20):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The value of the switching function a may possibly vary in an oscillating fashion (so-called chattering) with respect to the hyperplane σ = 0.  In order to suppress such chattering, it is preferable that the coefficient F relative to the reaching control law input Urch be established to further satisfy the condition of the following equation (21):<br><br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
The adaptive control law input Uadp is basically determined according to the following equation (22) (AT in the equation (22) represents the period of the control cycles of the exhaust-side control unit 7a):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The adaptive control law input Uadp is determined in proportion to an integrated value (which corresponds to an integral of the values of the switching function a) over control cycles of the product of values of the switching function a and the period AT of the exhaust-side control unit 7a until after the total dead time d, in view of the effect of the total dead time d.<br>
The coefficient G (which determines the gain of the adaptive control law) in the equation (22) is established to satisfy the condition of the following equation (23):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
A specific process of deriving conditions for establishing the equations (16), (20), (21), (23) is de-<br><br>
scribed in detail in Japanese patent application No. 11-93741 and U.S. patent application No. 09/153032, and will not be described in detail below.<br>
In the present embodiment, the sliding mode controller 27 determines the sum (Ueq + Urch + Uadp) of the equivalent control input Ueq, the reaching control law input Urch, and the adaptive control law Uadp determined according to the respective equations (18), (19), (22) as the SLD manipulating input Usl to be applied to the object exhaust system E. However, the differential outputs V02(K+d), V02(k+d-l) of the 02 sensor 6 and the value σ(k+d) of the switching function a, etc. used in the equations (18), (19), (22) cannot directly be obtained as they are values in the future.<br>
According to the present embodiment, therefore, the sliding mode controller 27 actually uses the estimated differential outputs V02(k+d) bar, V02(k+d-l) bar determined by the estimator 26, instead of the differential outputs V02(k+d), V02(k+d-l) from the 02 sensor 6 for determining the equivalent control input Ueq according to the equation (18), and calculates the equivalent control input Ueq in each control cycle according to the following equation (24):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
According to the present embodiment, furthermore, the sliding mode controller 27 actually uses time-series data of the estimated differential output V02 bar sequentially determined by the estimator 26 as described as a state quantity to be controlled, and defines a switching function a bar according to the following equation (25) (the switching function a bar corresponds to time-series data of the differential output V02 in the equation (15) which is replaced with time-series data of the estimated differential output V02 bar), in place of the switching function cr established according to the equation (25):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The sliding mode controller 27 calculates the reaching control law input urch in each control cycle according to the following equation (26), using the switching function a bar represented by the equation (25), rather than the value of the switching function o for determining the reaching control law input Urch according to the equation (19):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Similarly, the sliding mode controller 27 calcu lates the adaptive control law input uadp in each control<br><br>
cycle according to the following equation (21), using the value of the switching function o bar represented by the equation (25), rather than the value of the switching func tion a for determining the adaptive control law input Uadp according to the equation (22):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The latest identified gain coefficients al(k) hat, a2(k) hat, bl(k) hat which have been determined by the identifier 25 are basically used as the gain coefficients al, a2, bl that are required to calculate the equivalent control input Ueq, the reaching control law input Urch, and the adaptive control law input Uadp according to the equations (24), (26), (27).<br>
The sliding mode controller 27 determines the sum of the equivalent control input Ueq, the reaching control law input Urch, and the adaptive control law input Uadp determined according to the equations (24), (26), (27), as the SLD manipulating input Usl to be applied to the object exhaust system E (see the equation (17)). The conditions for establishing the coefficients si, s2, F, G used in the equations (24), (26), (27) are as described above.<br>
The above process is a basic algorithm for determining the SLD manipulating input Usl (= target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd) to be applied to the object exhaust<br><br>
system E with the sliding mode controller 27. According to the above algorithm, the SLD manipulating input Usl is determined to converge the estimated differential output V02 bar from the 02 sensor 6 toward "0", and as a result, to convert the output V02/OUT from the 02 sensor 6 toward the target value V02/TARGET.<br>
The sliding mode controller 27 eventually sequentially determines the target air-fuel ratio KCMD in each control cycle. The SLD manipulating input Usl determined as described above signifies a target value for the difference between the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas detected by the LAP sensor 5 and the reference value FLAP/BASE, i.e., the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd.  Consequently, the sliding mode controller 27 eventually determines the target air-fuel ratio KCMD by adding the reference value FLAP/BASE to the determined SLD manipulating input Usl in each control cycle according to the following equation (28):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The above process is a basic algorithm for determining the target air-fuel ratio KCMD with the sliding mode controller 27 according to the present embodiment.<br>
In the present embodiment, the stability of the adaptive sliding mode control process carried out by the sliding mode controller 27 is checked for limiting the value<br><br>
of the SLD manipulating input Usl. Details of such a checking process will be described later on.<br>
A process carried out by the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b will be described below.<br>
Various studies conducted by the inventors have revealed that when the target air-fuel ratio KCMD is determined by the sliding mode controller 27 and the fuel injection quantity of the internal combustion engine 1 is adjusted by the engine-side control unit 7b is adjusted in order converge the output KACT (the detected value of the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1) of the LAF sensor to the target air-fuel ratio KCMD, the time-series data of the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 exhibits characteristic changes depending on the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 with respect to the hy-perplane σ = 0.<br>
Such characteristic changes will be described below with reference to FIGS. 5 through 7.  FIGS. 5 through 7 show sampled data, represented by stippled dots, of the set of the time-series data V02(k), V02(k-l) of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6, i.e., the state quantity X, which are obtained in respective control cycles of the exhaust-side control unit 7a when the fuel injection quantity of the internal combustion engine 1 is adjusted depending on the target air-fuel ratio KCMD, with respect to a brand-new catalytic converter 3, a catalytic converter<br><br>
3 that has been deteriorated to a relatively small degree, and a catalytic converter 3 that has been deteriorated to a relatively large degree.  In each of FIGS. 5 through 7, the straight line represents the hyperplane a = 0.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, when the catalytic converter 3 is brand-new, the state quantities X tend to concentrate in the vicinity of the hyperplane o = 0. As the deterioration of the catalytic converter 3 progresses, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the state quantities X tend to be distributed away from the hyperplane a = 0, i.e., vary in a larger range around the hyperplane o = 0. The state quantities X tend to be distributed more widely as the catalytic converter 3 is deteriorated to a larger degree, i.e., as the deterioration of the catalytic converter 3 progresses more greatly. Stated otherwise, as the deterioration of the catalytic converter 3 progresses, the switching function a determined according to the equation (15) is likely to have a value more remote from "0", and hence vary more widely from "0". This appears to be due to the fact that as the deterioration of the catalytic converter 3 progresses, the exhaust system model according to the equation (1) tends to suffer an error, and hence the ability of the state quantity X to converge to the hyperplane o = 0 is lowered.<br>
The above tendency is also exhibited by the value of the switching function a bar determined by the equation (25) where the estimated differential output V02 bar<br><br>
determined by the estimator 26 is used as a variable component, i.e., the switching function used actually as the switching function for the sliding mode control process. Whereas the switching function or bar employs the estimated value of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6, the switching function according to the equation (15) employs the actual differential output V02 of the O2 sensor 6. Therefore, the latter appears to better reflect the actual deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3.<br>
For the above reason, according to the present embodiment, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is evaluated based on the value of the switching function a according to the equation (15). As described above, the actual switching function for the sliding mode control process is the switching function a bar defined according to the equation (25) where the estimated differential output V02 bar determined by the estimator 26 is used as a variable component. Strictly, the switching function a according to the equation (15) is not the switching function for the sliding mode control process according to the present embodiment. The switching function or according to the equation (15) will hereinafter be referred to as "deterioration evaluating linear function a"•<br>
An algorithm for evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 based on the deteriora-<br><br>
tion evaluating linear function a with the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b is constructed as follows:<br>
In view of the above tendency of the deterioration evaluating linear function a to change as the deterioration of the catalytic converter 3 progresses, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b sequentially determines the square o^ of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function cr in each control cycle.<br>
Then, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b effects a low-pass filtering process on the square a2 to determine a central value of the square a2 (hereinafter represented by LSo2) as a deterioration evaluating parameter.<br>
The above filtering process to determine the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 comprises a sequential statistic processing algorithm, and is represented by the following equation (29):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Thus, the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 is determined while being sequentially updated, in each control cycle of the exhaust-side control unit 7a, from a previous value LSo2(k-l) of the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2, a present value σ2(k) of the square σ2, and a gain parameter BP updated in each control<br><br>
cycle by a recursive formula expressed by the following equation (30):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In the equation (30), n1, n2 are set to values that satisfy the conditions: 0 
When the deterioration evaluating parameter LSSσ2 as the central value (the central value of the minimum square in the present embodiment) of the square σ2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function a is determined, the value of the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 exhibits a tendency shown in FIG. 8 with respect to the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3. FIG. 8 shows the relationship between the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2 determined as described above and the rate of flow of the exhaust gas through the catalytic converter 3 (hereinafter referred to as "exhaust gas volume") at the<br><br>
respective deteriorated states of the catalytic converters 3 shown in FIGS. 5 through 7.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the deterioration evaluating parameter LScr2 remains substantially constant irrespective of the exhaust gas volume at each of the deteriorated states of the catalytic converters 3, and increases its value as the deterioration of the catalytic converters 3 progresses. Therefore, the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 represents the degree to which the catalytic converter 3 is deteriorated.<br>
In the present embodiment, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is evaluated to judge whether the catalytic converter 3 is in a state where it has been deteriorated to the extent that it needs to be replaced immediately or soon (such a deteriorated state will hereinafter be referred to as "deterioration-in-progress state", or not (a state of the catalytic converter 3 which is not in the deterioration-in-progress state will hereinafter be referred to as "non-deteriorated state"). The deterioration-in-progress state is indicated by the deterioration indicator 29.<br>
As indicated by the broken line in FIG. 8, a threshold CATAGELMT is preset with respect to the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2.  If the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 is equal to or greater than the threshold CATAGELMT, then the catalytic converter 3 is<br><br>
judged as being in the deterioration-in-progress state.  If the deterioration evaluating parameter LS^ is smaller than the threshold CATAGELMT, then the catalytic converter 3 is judged as being in the non-deteriorated state.<br>
The algorithm described above is a basic algorithm for evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 with the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b. The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b also performs an additional process of recognizing how the exhaust gas volume changes upon evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3.  Such an additional process of recognizing how the exhaust gas volume changes will be described later on.<br>
The general feedback controller 15 of the engine-side control unit 7b, particularly, the adaptive controller 18, will further be described below.<br>
In FIG. 1, the general feedback controller 15 effects a feedback control process to converge the output KACT (the detected value of the air-fuel ratio) from the LAF sensor 5 toward the target air-fuel ratio KCMD as described above.  If such a feedback control process were carried out under the known PID control only, it would be difficult keep stable controllability against dynamic behavioral changes including changes in the operating conditions of the internal combustion engine 1, characteristic changes due to aging of the internal combustion engine 1, etc.<br><br>
The adaptive controller 18 is a recursive-type controller which makes it possible to carry out a feedback control process while compensating for dynamic behavioral changes of the internal combustion engine 1. As shown in FIG. 9, the adaptive controller 18 comprises a parameter adjuster 30 for establishing a plurality of adaptive parameters using the parameter adjusting law proposed by I. D. Landau, et al., and a manipulated variable calculator 31 for calculating the feedback manipulated variable KSTR using the established adaptive parameters.<br>
The parameter adjuster 30 will be described below. According to the parameter adjusting law proposed by I. D. Landau, et al., when polynomials of the denominator and the numerator of a transfer function B(Z"1)/A(Z-1) of a discrete-system object to be controlled are generally expressed respectively by equations (31), (32), given below, an adaptive parameter 6 hat (j) (j indicates the ordinal number of a control cycle) established by the parameter adjuster 30 is represented by a vector (transposed vector) according to the equation (33) given below. An input £(j) to the parameter adjuster 30 is expressed by the equation (34) given below.<br>
In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the internal combustion engine 1, which is an object to be controlled by the general feedback controller 15, is considered to be a plant of a first-order system having a dead time dp<br><br>
corresponding to the time of three combustion cycles of the internal combustion engine 1, and m = n = 1, dp= 3 in the equations (31) - (34), and five adaptive parameters sO, rl, r2, r3, bO are established (see FIG. 9).  In the upper and middle expressions of the equation (34), us, ys generally represent an input (manipulated variable) to the object to be controlled and an output (controlled variable) from the object to be controlled.  In the present embodiment, the input is the feedback manipulated variable KSTR and the output from the object (the internal combustion engine 1) is the output KACT (detected air-fuel ratio) from the LAF sensor 5, and the input £(j) to the parameter adjuster 30 is expressed by the lower expression of the equation (34) (see FIG. 3).<br>
 (Equation Removed)<br><br><br>
The adaptive parameter 6 hat expressed by the equation (33) is made up of a scalar quantity element bO hat (j) for determining the gain of the adaptive controller 18, a control element BR hat (Z-1,j) expressed using a manipulated variable, and a control element S (Z~x,j) expressed using a controlled variable, which are expressed respectively by the following equations (35) ~ (37) (see the block of the manipulated variable calculator 31 shown in FIG. 9):<br><br>
- rlZ' + r2Z"2 + r3Z'3<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The parameter adjuster 30 establishes coefficients of the scalar quantity element and the control elements, described above, and supplies them as the adaptive parameter 6 hat expressed by the equation (33) to the manipulated variable calculator 31. The parameter adjuster 30 calculates the adaptive parameter 6 hat so that the output<br><br>
KACT from the LAP sensor 5 will agree with the target air-fuel ratio KCMD, using time-series data of the feedback manipulated variable KSTR from the present to the past and the output KACT from the LAP sensor 5.<br>
Specifically, the parameter adjuster 30 calculates the adaptive parameter 9 hat according to the following equation (38):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where r(j) represents a gain matrix (whose degree is indicated by m+n+dp) for determining a rate of establishing the adaptive parameter 9 hat, and e*(j) an estimated error of the adaptive parameter 9 hat. r(j) and e*(j) are expressed respectively by the following recursive formulas (39), (40):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where <br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
where D(Z-l) represents an asymptotically stable polynomial for adjusting the convergence. In the present embodiment, D(Z-1) = 1.<br>
Various specific algorithms including the degressive gain algorithm, the variable gain algorithm, the fixed tracing algorithm, and the fixed gain algorithm are obtained depending on how X,l(j), X2(j) in the equation (39) are selected. For a time-dependent plant such as a fuel injection process, an air-fuel ratio, or the like of the internal combustion engine 1, either one of the degressive gain algorithm, the variable gain algorithm, the fixed gain algorithm, and the fixed tracing algorithm is suitable.<br>
Using the adaptive parameter 0 hat (sO, rl, r2, r3, bO) established by the parameter adjuster 30 and the target air-fuel ratio KCMD determined by the deteriorated state evaluating means 13a of the exhaust-side main processor 13, the manipulated variable calculator 31 determines the feedback manipulated variable KSTR according to a recursive formula expressed by the following equation (41):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The manipulated variable calculator 31 shown in FIG. 9 represents a block diagram of the calculations according to the equation (41).<br><br>
The feedback manipulated variable KSTR determined according to the equation (41) becomes the target air-fuel ratio KCMD insofar as the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 agrees with the target air-fuel ratio KCMD. Therefore, the feedback manipulated variable KSTR is divided by the target air-fuel ratio KCMD by the divider 19 for thereby determining the feedback manipulated variable kstr that can be used as the feedback correction coefficient KFB.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing description, the adaptive controller 18 thus constructed is a recursive-type controller taking into account dynamic behavioral changes of the engine 1 which is an object to be controlled. Stated otherwise, the adaptive controller 18 is a controller described in a recursive form to compensate for dynamic behavioral changes of the engine 1, and more particularly a controller having a recursive-type adaptive parameter adjusting mechanism.<br>
A recursive-type controller of this type may be constructed using an optimum regulator.  In such a case, however, it generally has no parameter adjusting mechanism. The adaptive controller 18 constructed as described above is suitable for compensating for dynamic behavioral changes of the internal combustion engine 1.<br>
The details of the adaptive controller 18 have been described above.<br><br>
The PID controller 17, which is provided together with the adaptive controller 18 in the general feedback controller 15, calculates a proportional term (P term), an integral term (I term), and a derivative term (D term) from the difference between the output KACT of the LAP sensor 5 and the target air-fuel ratio KCMD, and calculates the total of those terms as the feedback manipulated variable KLAF, as is the case with the general PID control process.  In the present embodiment, the feedback manipulated variable KLAF is set to "1" when the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 agrees with the target air-fuel ratio KCMD by setting an initial value of the integral term (I term) to "1", so that the feedback manipulated variable KLAF can be used as the feedback correction coefficient KFB for directly correcting the fuel injection quantity. The gains of the proportional term, the integral term, and the derivative term are determined from the rotational speed and intake pressure of the internal combustion engine 1 using a predetermined map.<br>
The switcher 20 of the general feedback controller 15 outputs the feedback manipulated variable KLAF determined by the PID controller 17 as the feedback correction coefficient KFB for correcting the fuel injection quantity if the combustion in the internal combustion engine 1 tends to be unstable as when the temperature of the coolant of the internal combustion engine 1 is low, the internal combustion engine 1 rotates at high speeds, or the intake pressure is<br><br>
low, or if the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 is not reliable due to a response delay of the LAF sensor 5 as when the target air-fuel ratio KCMD changes largely or immediately after the air-fuel ratio feedback control process has started, or if the internal combustion engine 1 operates highly stably as when it is idling and hence no high-gain control process by the adaptive controller 18 is required. Otherwise, the switcher 20 outputs the feedback manipulated variable kstr which is produced by dividing the feedback manipulated variable KSTR determined by the adaptive controller 18 by the target air-fuel ration KCMD, as the feedback correction coefficient KFB for correcting the fuel injection quantity. This is because the adaptive controller 18 effects a high-gain control process and functions to converge the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 quickly toward the target air-fuel ratio KCMD, and if the feedback manipulated variable KSTR determined by the adaptive controller 18 is used when the combustion in the internal combustion engine 1 is unstable or the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 is not reliable, then the air-fuel ratio control process tends to be unstable.<br>
Such operation of the switcher 20 is disclosed in detail in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 8-105345 or U.S. patent No. 5,558,075, and will not be described in detail below.<br><br>
Operation of the entire apparatus according to the present embodiment will be described below.<br>
First, a process, carried out by the engine-side control unit 7b, of calculating an output fuel injection quantity #nTout (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) for each of the cylinders of the internal combustion engine 1 for controlling the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1 will be described below with reference to FIG. 10. The engine-side control unit 7b calculates an output fuel injection quantity #nTout (n = lf 2, 3, 4) for each of the cylinders in synchronism with a crankshaft angle period (TDC) of the internal combustion engine 1 as follows:<br>
In FIG. 10, the engine-side control unit 7b reads outputs from various sensors including the LAF sensor 5 and the 02 sensor 6 in STEPa. At this time, the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 and the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6, including data obtained in the past, are stored in a time-series fashion in a memory (not shown).<br>
Then, the basic fuel injection quantity calculator 8 corrects a fuel injection quantity corresponding to the rotational speed NE and intake pressure PB of the internal combustion engine 1 depending on the effective opening area of the throttle valve, thereby calculating a basic fuel injection quantity Tim in STEPb. The first correction coefficient calculator 9 calculates a first correction coeffi-<br><br>
cient KTOTAL depending on the coolant temperature and the amount by which the canister is purged in STEPc.<br>
The engine-side control unit 7b decides whether the operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is an operation mode (hereinafter referred to as "normal operation mode") in which the fuel injection quantity is adjusted using the target air-fuel ratio KCMD generated by the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a, and sets a value of a flag f/prism/on in STEPd. When the value of the flag f/prism/on is "I", it means that the operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is the normal operation mode, and when the value of the flag f/prism/on is "0", it means that the operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is not the normal operation mode.<br>
The deciding subroutine of STEPd is shown in detail in FIG. 11. As shown in FIG. 11, the engine-side control unit 7b decides whether the 02 sensor 6 and the LAF sensor 5 are activated or not respectively in STEPd-1, JTEPd-2. If neither one of the 02 sensor 6 and the LAF sensor 5 is activated, since detected data from the 02 sensor 6 and the LAF sensor 5 for use by the exhaust-side main processor 13 are not accurate enough, the operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is not the normal operation mode, and the value of the flag f/prism/on is set to "0" in STEPd-10.<br>
Then, the engine-side control unit 7b decides whether the internal combustion engine 1 is operating with a<br><br>
lean air-fuel mixture or not in STEPd-3. The engine-side control unit 7b decides whether the ignition timing of the internal combustion engine 1 is retarded for early activation of the catalytic converter 3 immediately after the start of the internal combustion engine 1 or not in STEPd-4. The engine-side control unit 7b decides whether the throttle valve of the internal combustion engine 1 is substantially fully open or not in STEPd-5. The engine-side control unit 7b decides whether the supply of fuel to the internal combustion engine 1 is being stopped or not in STEPd-6.  If either one of the conditions of these steps is satisfied, then since it is not preferable or not possible to control the supply of fuel to the internal combustion engine 1 using the target air-fuel ratio KCMD generated by the exhaust-side main processor 13, the operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is not the normal operation mode, and the value of the flag f/prism/on is set to "0" in STEPd-10. The engine-side control unit 7b then decides whether the rotational speed NE and the intake pressure ?B of the internal combustion engine 1 fall within respective given ranges or not respectively in STEPd-7, STEPd-8.  If either one of the rotational speed NE and the intake pressure PB does not fall within its given range, then since it is not preferable to control the supply of fuel to the internal combustion engine 1 using the target air-fuel ratio KCMD generated by the exhaust-side main processor 13, the<br><br>
operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is not the normal operation mode, and the value of the flag f/prism/on is set to "0" in STEPd-10.<br>
If the conditions of STEPd-1, STEPd-2, STEPd-7, STEPd-8 are satisfied, and the conditions of STEPd-3, STEPd-4, STEPd-5, STEPd-6 are not satisfied (at this time, the internal combustion engine 1 is in the normal operation mode), then the operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is judged as the normal operation mode, and the value of the flag f/prism/on is set to "I" in STEPd-9.<br>
In FIG. 10, after the value of the flag f/prism/on has been set, the engine-side control unit 7b determines the value of the flag f/prism/on in STEPe.  If f/prism/on = 1, then the engine-side control unit 7b reads the target air-fuel ratio KCMD generated by the exhaust-side main processor 13 in STEPf.  If f/prism/on = 0, then the engine-side control unit 7b sets the target air-fuel ratio KCMD to a predetermined 
In the local feedback controller 16, the PID controllers 22 calculates respective feedback correction coefficients #nKLAF in order to eliminate variations between the cylinders, based on actual air-fuel ratios #nA/F (n = 1, 2,<br><br>
3, 4) of the respective cylinders which have been estimated from the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 by the observer 21, in STEPh. Then, the general feedback controller 15 calculates a feedback correction coefficient KFB in STEPi.<br>
Depending on the operating conditions of the internal combustion engine 1, the switcher 20 selects either the feedback manipulated variable KLAF determined by the PID controller 17 or the feedback manipulated variable kstr which has been produced by dividing the feedback manipulated variable KSTR determined by the adaptive controller 18 by the target air-fuel ratio KCMD (normally, the switcher 20 selects the feedback manipulated variable kstr).  The switcher 20 then outputs the selected feedback manipulated variable KLAF or kstr as a feedback correction coefficient KFB.<br>
When switching the feedback correction coefficient KFB from the feedback manipulated variable KLAF from the PID controller 17 to the feedback manipulated variable kstr from the adaptive controller 18, the adaptive controller 18 determines a feedback manipulated variable KSTR in a manner to hold the correction coefficient KFB to the preceding correction coefficient KFB (= KLAF) as long as in the cycle time for the switching. When switching the feedback correction coefficient KFB from the feedback manipulated variable kstr from the adaptive controller 18 to the feedback manipulated variable KLAF from the PID controller 17,<br><br>
the PID controller 17 calculates a present correction coefficient KLAF in a manner to regard the feedback manipulated variable KLAF determined by itself in the preceding cycle time as the preceding correction coefficient KFB (= kstr).<br>
After the feedback correction coefficient KFB has been calculated, the second correction coefficient calculator 10 calculates in STEPj a second correction coefficient KCMDM depending on the target air-fuel ratio KCMD determined in STEPf or STEPg.<br>
Then, the engine-side control unit 7b multiplies the basic fuel injection quantity Tim determined as described above, by the first correction coefficient KTOTAL, the second correction coefficient KCMDM, the feedback correction coefficient KFB, and the feedback correction coefficients #nKLAF of the respective cylinders, determining output fuel injection quantities #nTout of the respective cylinders in STEPk. The output fuel injection quantities #nTout are then corrected for accumulated fuel particles on intake pipe walls of the internal combustion engine 1 by the fuel accumulation corrector 23 in STEPm. The corrected output fuel injection quantities #nTout are applied to the non-illustrated fuel injectors of the internal combustion engine 1 in STEPn.<br>
In the internal combustion engine 1, the fuel injectors inject fuel into the respective cylinders accord-<br><br>
ing to the respective output fuel injection quantities #nTout.<br>
The above calculation of the output fuel injection quantities #nTout and the fuel injection of the internal combustion engine 1 are carried out in successive cycle times synchronous with the crankshaft angle period of the internal combustion engine 1 for controlling the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine I in order to converge the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 (the detected air-fuel ratio) toward the target air-fuel ratio KCMD. While the feedback manipulated variable kstr from the adaptive controller 18 is being used as the feedback correction coefficient KFB, the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 is quickly converged toward the target air-fuel ratio KCMD with high stability against behavioral changes such as changes in the operating conditions of the internal combustion engine 1 or characteristic changes thereof. A response delay of the internal combustion engine 1 is also appropriately compensated for.<br>
Concurrent with the above fuel control for the internal combustion engine 1, the exhaust-side control unit 7a executes a main routine shown in FIG. 12 in control cycles of a constant period.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, the exhaust-side control unit 7a decides whether the processing of the exhaust-side main processor 13 is to be executed or not, and sets a value<br><br>
of a flag f/prism/cal indicative of whether the processing is to be executed or not in STEP1. When the value of the flag f/prism/cal is "0", it means that the processing of the exhaust-side main processor 13 is not to be executed, and when the value of the flag f/prism/cal is "I", it means that the processing of the exhaust-side main processor 13 is to be executed.<br>
The deciding subroutine in STEP1 is shown in detail in FIG. 13. As shown in FIG. 13, the exhaust-side control unit 7a decides whether the 02 sensor 6 and the LAF sensor 5 are activated or not respectively in STEP1-1, STEP1-2. If neither one of the 02 sensor 6 and the LAF sensor 5 is activated, since detected data from the 02 sensor 6 and the LAF sensor 5 for use by the exhaust-side main processor 13 are not accurate enough, the value of the flag f/prism/cal is set to "0" in STEP1-6. Then, in order to initialize the identifier 25 as described later on, the value of a flag f/id/reset indicative of whether the identifier 25 is to be initialized or not is set to "I" in STEP1-7. When the value of the flag f/id/reset is "I", it means that the identifier 25 is to be initialized, and when the value of the flag f/id/reset is "0", it means that the identifier 25 is not to be initialized.<br>
The exhaust-side control unit 7a decides whether the internal combustion engine 1 is operating with a lean air-fuel mixture or not in STEP1-3. The exhaust-side con-<br><br>
trol unit 7a decides whether the ignition timing of the internal combustion engine 1 is retarded for early activation of the catalytic converter 3 immediately after the start of the internal combustion engine 1 or not in STEP1-4.  If the conditions of these steps are satisfied, then since the target air-fuel ratio KCMD calculated to adjust the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to the target value V02/TARGET is not used for the fuel control for the internal combustion engine 1, the value of the flag f/prism/cal is set to "0" in STEP1-6, and the value of the flag f/id/reset is set to "I" in order to initialize the identifier 25 in STEPl-7.<br>
In FIG. 12r after the above deciding subroutine, the exhaust-side control unit 7a decides whether a process of identifying (updating) the gain coefficients al, a2, bl with the identifier 25 is to be executed or not, and sets a value of a flag f/id/cal indicative of whether the process of identifying (updating) the gain coefficients al, a2, bl is to be executed or not in STEP2. When the value of the flag f/id/cal is "0", it means that the process of identifying (updating) the gain coefficients al, a2, bl is not to be executed, and when the value of the flag f/id/cal is "1", it means that the process of identifying (updating) the gain coefficients al, a2, bl is to be executed.<br>
In the deciding process of STEP2, the exhaust-side control unit 7a decides whether the throttle valve of the internal combustion engine 1 is substantially fully open<br><br>
or not, and also decides whether the supply of fuel to the internal combustion engine 1 is being stopped or not.  If either one of these conditions is satisfied, then since it is difficult to adjust the gain coefficients al, a2, bl appropriately, the value of the flag f/id/cal is set to "0". If neither one of these conditions is satisfied, then the value of the flag f/id/cal is set to "I" to identify (update) the gain coefficients al, a2, bl with the identifier 25.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 12, the exhaust-side control unit 7a calculates the latest differential outputs kact(k) (= KACT(k) - FLAF/BASE), V02(k) (= V02/OUT(k) -V02/TARGET) respectively from the subtractors 11, 12 in STEP3.  Specifically, the subtractors 11, 12 select latest ones of the time-series data read and stored in the non-illustrated memory in STEPa shown in FIG. 10, and calculate the differential outputs kact(k), V02(k). The differential outputs kact(k), V02(k), as well as data given in the past, are stored in a time-series manner in a memory (not shown) in the exhaust-side control unit 7a.<br>
Then, in STEP4, the exhaust-side control unit 7a determines the value of the flag f/prism/cal set in STEP1. If the value of the flag f/prism/cal is "0", i.e., if the processing of the exhaust-side main processor 13 is not to be executed, then the exhaust-side control unit 7a forcibly sets the SLD manipulating input Usl (the target differential<br><br>
air-fuel ratio kcmd) to be determined by the sliding mode controller 27, to a predetermined value in STEP13. The predetermined value may be a fixed value (e.g., "0") or the value of the SLD manipulating input Usl determined in a preceding control cycle.<br>
After the SLD manipulating input Usl is set to the predetermined value in STEP12, the exhaust-side control unit 7a adds the reference value FLAF/BASE to the SLD manipulating input Usl for thereby determining a target air-fuel ratio KCMD in the present control cycle in STEP 14. Then, the processing in the present control cycle is finished.<br>
If the value of the flag f/prism/cal is "I" in STEP4, i.e., if the processing of the exhaust-side main processor 13 is to be executed, then the exhaust-side control unit 7a effects the processing of the identifier 25 in STEPS.<br>
The processing subroutine of STEPS is shown in detail in FIG. 14.<br>
The identifier 25 determines the value of the flag f/id/cal set in STEP2 in STEP5-1.  If the value of the flag f/id/cal is "0", then since the process of identifying the gain coefficients al, a2, bl with the identifier 25 is not carried out, control immediately goes back to the main routine shown in FIG. 12.<br><br>
If the value of the flag f/id/cal is "1", then the identifier 25 determines the value of the flag f/id/reset set in STEP1 with respect to the initialization of the identifier 25 in STEP5-2.  If the value of the flag f/id/reset is "I", the identifier 25 is initialized in STEP5-3. When the identifier 25 is initialized, the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat are set to predetermined initial values (the identified gain coefficient vector 8 according to the equation (4) is initialized), and the elements of the matrix P (diagonal matrix) according to the equation (9) are set to predetermined initial values. The value of the flag f/id/reset is reset to "0".<br>
Then, the identifier 25 calculates the identified differential output V02(k) hat using the present identified gain coefficients al(k-l) hat, a2(k-l) hat, bl(k-l) hat and the past data V02(k-l), V02(k-2), kact(k-d-l) of the differential outputs V02, kact calculated in each control cycle in STEP3, according to the equation (3) in STEP5-4.<br>
The identifier 25 then calculates the vector K6(k) to be used in determining the new identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat according to the equation (9) in STEP5-5. Thereafter, the identifier 25 calculates the identified error id/e(k), i.e., the difference between the identified differential output V02 hat and the actual differential output V02 (see the equation (7)), in STEP5-6.<br><br>
The identified error id/e(k) obtained in STEP5-6 may basically be calculated according to the equation (7). In the present embodiment, however, a value (= V02(k) -V02(k) hat) calculated according to the equation (7) from the differential output V02 acquired in each control cycle in STEP3 (see FIG. 12), and the identified differential output V02 hat calculated in each control cycle in STEP5-4 is filtered with low-pass characteristics to calculate the identified error id/e(k).<br>
This is because since the object exhaust system E including the catalytic converter 3 generally has low-pass characteristics, it is preferable to attach importance to the low-frequency behavior of the object exhaust system E in appropriately identifying the gain coefficients al, a2, bl of the exhaust system model.<br>
Both the differential output V02 and the identified differential output V02 hat may be filtered with the same low-pass characteristics.  For example, after the differential output V02 and the identified differential output V02 hat have separately been filtered, the equation (7) may be calculated to determine the identified error id/e(k). The above filtering is carried out by a moving average process which is a digital filtering process.<br>
Thereafter, the identifier 25 calculates a new identified gain coefficient vector 8(k), i.e., new identified gain coefficients al(k) hat, a2(k) hat, bl(k) hat, ac-<br><br>
cording to the equation (8) using the identified error id/e(k) determined in STEP5-6 and K6(k) calculated in SETP5-5 in STEP5-7.<br>
After having calculated the new identified gain coefficients al(k) hat, a2(k) hat, bl(k) hat, the identifier 25 further limits the values of the gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat (elements of the identified gain coefficient vector 0) to meet predetermined conditions in STEP5-8. Then, the identifier 25 updates the matrix P(k) according to the equation (10) for the processing of a next control cycle in STEP5-9, after which control returns to the main routine shown in FIG. 12.<br>
The process of limiting the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat in STEP5-8 comprises a process of limiting the values of the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat to a certain combination, i.e., a process of limiting a point (al hat, a2 hat) to a given region on a coordinate plane which has the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat as its component, and a process of limiting the value of the identified gain coefficient bl hat within a given range. According to the former process, if a point (al(k) hat, a2(k) hat) on the coordinate plane which is determined by the identified gain coefficients al(k) hat, a2(k) hat calculated in STEP5-7 deviates from the given region on the coordinate plane, then the values of the identified gain coefficients al(k) hat, a2(k) hat<br><br>
are forcibly limited to the values of the point in the given region. According to the latter process, if the value of the identified gain coefficient bl(k) hat calculated in STEP5-7 exceeds the upper or lower limit of the given range, then the value of the identified gain coefficient bl(k) hat is forcibly limited to the upper or lower limit of the given range.<br>
The above process of limiting the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat serves to maintain stability of the SLD manipulating input Usl (the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd) calculated by the sliding mode controller 27, and hence the target air-fuel ratio KCMD.<br>
Specific details of the process of limiting the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat are described in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 11-153051 and U.S. patent application No. 09/153300, and will not be described herein.<br>
The preceding values al(k-l) hat, a2(k-l) hat, bl(k-l) hat of the identified gain coefficients used to determine the new identified gain coefficients al(k) hat, a2(k) hat, bl(k) hat in STEP5-7 are the values of the identified gain coefficients after which have been limited in STEP5-8 in the preceding control cycle.<br>
Details of the processing of the identifier 25 in STEPS shown in FIG. 12 have been described above.<br><br>
In FIG. 12, after the processing of the identifier 25 has been carried out, the exhaust-side control unit 7a determines the values of the gain coefficients al, a2, bl in STEP6. Specifically, if the value of the flag f/id/cal set in STEP2 is "I", i.e., if the gain coefficients al, a2, bl have been identified by the identifier 25, then the gain coefficients al, a2, bl are set to the latest identified gain coefficients al(k) hat, a2(k) hat, bl(k) hat determined by the identifier 25 in STEPS (limited in STEP5-8).  If the value of the flag f/id/cal is "0", i.e., if the gain coefficients al, a2, bl have not been identified by the identifier 25, then the gain coefficients al, a2, bl are set to predetermined values, respectively.<br>
Then, the exhaust-sids control unit 7a effects a processing operation of the estimator 26, i.e., calculates the estimated differential output VO2 bar, in STEP7.<br>
The estimator 26 calculates the coefficients al 0.2, pj (j = 1, 2, •••, d) to be used in the equation (13), using the gain coefficients al, a2, bl determined in STEP6 (these values are basically the identified gain coefficients al hat, a2 hat, bl hat) according to the equation (12).<br>
Then, the estimator 26 calculates the estimated differential output V02(k+d) bar (estimated value of the differential output V02 after the total dead time d from the time of the present control cycle) according to the equation (13), using the time-series data V02(k), V02(k-l), from be-<br><br>
fore the present control cycle, of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor calculated in each control cycle in STEP3, the time-series data kact(k-j) (j = (),•••, dl), from before the present control cycle, of the differential output kact of the LAP sensor 5, the time-series data kcmd(k-j) (= Usl(k-j), j = 1, •••, d2-l), from before the preceding control cycle, of the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd (= the SLD manipulating input Usl) given in each control cycle from the sliding mode controller 27, and the coefficients αl, α2, βj calculated as described above.<br>
Then, the exhaust-side control unit 7a calculates the SLD manipulating input Usl (= the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd) with the sliding mode controller 27 in STEPS.<br>
Specifically, the sliding mode controller 27 calculates a value σ(k+d) bar (corresponding to an estimated value, after the total dead time d, of the linear function a defined according to the equation (15)), after the total dead time d from the present control cycle, of the switching function a bar defined according to the equation (25), using the time-series data V02(k+d) bar, V02(k+d-l) bar of the estimated differential output V02 bar determined by the estimator 26 in STEP7.<br>
At this time, the sliding mode controller 27 keeps the value of the switching function o bar within a predetermined allowable range.  If the valueσ(k+d) bar de-<br><br>
termined as described above exceeds the upper or lower limit of the allowable range, then the sliding mode controller 27 forcibly limits the value σ(k+d) bar to the upper or lower limit of the allowable range. This is because if the value of the switching function a bar were excessive, the reaching control law input Urch would be excessive, and the adaptive control law Uadp would change abruptly, tending to impair the stability of the process of converging the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to the target value V02/TARGET.<br>
Then, the sliding mode controller 27 accumulatively adds values a(k+d) bar.ΔT, produced by multiplying the value a(k+d) bar of the switching function a bar by the period AT (constant period) of the control cycles of the exhaust-side control unit 7a. That is, the sliding mode controller 27 adds the product a(k+d) bar-AT of the value cr(k+d) bar and the period AT calculated in the present control cycle to the sum determined in the preceding control cycle, thus calculating an integrated value or bar (hereinafter represented by "Σσ bar") which is the calculated result of the term £(a bar-AT) of the equation (27).<br>
In the present embodiment, the sliding mode controller 27 keeps the integrated value Σσ  bar in a predetermined allowable range.  If the integrated value Σσ  bar exceeds the upper or lower limit of the allowable range, then the sliding mode controller 27 forcibly limits the integrated value Σσ  bar to the upper or lower limit of the allowable<br><br>
range. This is because if the integrated value Za bar were excessive, the adaptive control law Uadp determined according to the equation (27) would be excessive, tending to impair the stability of the process of converging the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to the target value V02/TARGET.<br>
Then, the sliding mode controller 27 calculates the equivalent control input Ueq, the reaching control law input Urch, and the adaptive control law Uadp according to the respective equations (24), (26), (27), using the time-series data V02(k+d)bar, V02(k+d-l) bar of the present and past values of the estimated differential output V02 bar determined by the estimator 26 in STEP7, the value σ (k+d) bar of the switching function o bar and its integrated value Σσ  bar which are determined as described above, and the gain coefficients al, a2, bl determined in STEP 6 (which are basically the gain coefficients al(k) hat, a2(k) hat, bl(k) hat).<br>
The sliding mode controller 27 then adds the equivalent control input Ueq, the reaching control law input Urch, and the adaptive control law Uadp to calculate the SLD manipulating input Usl, i.e., the input (= the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd) to be applied to the object exhaust system E for converging the output signal V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 toward the target value V02/TARGET.<br>
After the SLD manipulating input Usl has been calculated, the exhaust-side control unit 7a determines the<br><br>
stability of the adaptive sliding mode control process carried out by the sliding mode controller 27, or more specifically, the ability of the controlled state of the output VO2/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 based on the adaptive sliding mode control process (hereinafter referred to as "SLD controlled state"), and sets a value of a flag f/sld/stb indicative of whether the SLD controlled state is stable or not in STEP9.<br>
The determining subroutine of STEP9 is shown in detail in FIG. 15.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, the exhaust-side control unit 7a calculates a difference Acr bar (corresponding to a rate of change of the switching function a bar) between the present value o(k+d) bar of the switching function a bar calculated in STEPS and a preceding value cr(k+d-l) bar thereof in STEP9-1.<br>
Then, the exhaust-side control unit 7a decides whether or not a product Aa bar -a(k+d) bar (corresponding to the time-differentiated function of a Lyapunov function a bar2/2 relative to the o bar) of the difference Ao bar and the present value σ (k+d) bar is equal to or smaller than a predetermined value e (&gt; 0) in STEP9-2.<br>
The difference Acr bar σ (k+d) bar (hereinafter referred to as "stability determining parameter Pstb") will be described below.  If the stability determining parameter Pstb is greater than 0 (Pstb &gt; 0), then the value of the switching function o bar is basically changing away from<br><br>
"0".  If the stability determining parameter Pstb is equal to or smaller than 0 (Pstb ≤ 0), then the value of the switching function a bar is basically converged or converging to "0". Generally, in order to converge a controlled variable to its target value according to the sliding mode control process, it is necessary that the value of the switching function be stably converged to "0". Basically, therefore, it is possible to determine whether the SLD controlled state is stable or unstable depending on whether or not the value of the stability determining parameter Pstb is equal to or smaller than 0.<br>
If, however, the stability of the SLD controlled state is determined by comparing the value of the stability determining parameter Pstb with "0", then the determined result of the stability is affected even by slight noise contained in the value of the switching function a bar. According to the present invention, therefore, the predetermined value e with which the stability determining parameter Pstb is to be compared in STEP9-2 is of a positive value slightly greater than "0".<br>
If Pstb &gt; E in STEP9-2, then the SLD controlled state is judged as being unstable, and the value of a timer counter tm (count-down timer) is set to a predetermined initial value TM (the timer counter tm is started) in order to inhibit the determination of the target air-fuel ratio KCMD using the SLD manipulating input Usl calculated in STEPS for<br><br>
a predetermined time in STEP9-4. Thereafter, the value of the flag f/sld/stb is set to "0" in STEP9-5, after which control returns to the main routine shown in FIG. 12.<br>
If Pstb ≤ ε in STEP9-2, then the exhaust-side control unit 7a decides whether the present value σ(k+d) bar of the switching function a bar falls within a predetermined range or not in STEP9-3.<br>
If the present value σ(k+d) bar of the switching function o bar does not fall within the predetermined range, then since the present value σ(k+d) bar spaced widely apart from "0"f the SLD controlled state is considered to be unstable. Therefore, if the present value σ(k+d) bar of the switching function a bar does not fall within the predetermined range in STEP9-3, then the SLD controlled state is judged as being unstable, and the processing of STEP9-4 through STEP9-5 is executed to start the timer counter tm and set the value of the flag f/sld/stb to "0".<br>
In the present embodiment, since the value of the switching function o bar is limited within the allowable range in STEPS, the decision processing in STEP9-3 may be dispensed with.<br>
If the present value <j bar of the switching function o falls within predetermined range in step9-3 then exhaust-side control unit counts down timer counter tm for a time atm step9-6. decides whether or></j><br>
not the value of the timer counter tm is equal to or smaller than "0", i.e., whether a time corresponding to the initial value TM has elapsed from the start of the timer counter tm or not, in STEP9-7.<br>
If tm &gt; 0, i.e., if the timer counter tm is still measuring time and its set time has not yet elapsed, then since no substantial time has elapsed after the SLD controlled state is judged as unstable in STEP9-2 or STEP9-3, the SLD controlled state tends to become unstable. Therefore, if tm &gt; 0 in STEP9-7, then the value of the flag f/sld/stb is set to "0" in STEP9-5.<br>
If tm 
According to the above processing, if the SLD controlled state is judged as being unstable, then the value of the flag f/sld/stb is set to "0", and if the SLD controlled state is judged as being stable, then the value of the flag f/sld/stb is set to "1".<br>
In the present embodiment, the above process of determining the stability of the SLD controlled state is by way of illustrative example only. The stability of the SLD controlled state may be determined by any of various other processes. For example, in each given period longer than the control cycle, the frequency with which the value of the<br><br>
stability determining parameter Pstb in the period is greater than the predetermined value e is counted.  If the frequency is in excess of a predetermined value, then the SLD controlled state is judged as unstable. Otherwise, the SLD controlled state is judged as stable.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 12, after a value of the flag f/sld/stb indicative of the stability of the SLD controlled state has been set, the exhaust-side control unit 7 a determines the value of the flag f/sld/stb in STEP10.  If the value of the flag f/sld/stb is "I", i.e., if the SLD controlled state is judged as being stable, then the sliding mode controller 27 limits the SLD manipulating input usl calculated in STEP 8 in STEP11. Specifically, the sliding mode controller 27 determines whether the present value of the SLD manipulating input Usl calculated in STEPS falls in a predetermined allowable range or not.  If the present value of the SLD manipulating input Usl exceeds the upper or lower limit of the allowable range, then the sliding mode controller 27 forcibly limits the present value Usl(k) of the SLD manipulating input Usl to the upper or lower limit of the allowable range.<br>
The SLD manipulating input Usl (= the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd) limited in STEP11 is stored in a memory (not shown) in a time-series fashion, and will be used in the processing operation of the estimator 26.<br><br>
Then, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b of the exhaust-side main processor 13 performs the process of evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 (described later on) in STEP12. The sliding mode controller 27 adds the reference value FLAF/BASE to the SLD manipulating input Usl limited in STEP11, thus calculating the target air-fuel ratio KCMD in STEP14. The processing in the present control cycle is now put to an end.<br>
If f/sld/stb = 0 in STEP10, i.e., if the SLD controlled state is judged as unstable, then the exhaust-side control unit 7a forcibly sets the SLD manipulating input Usl in the present control cycle to a predetermined value (the fixed value or the preceding value of the SLD manipulating input Usl) in STEP13. The exhaust-side control unit 7a calculates the target air-fuel ratio KCMD according to the equation (28) in STEP 14. Then, the processing in the present control cycle is finished.<br>
The target air-fuel ratio KCMD finally determined in STEP14 is stored in a memory (not shown) in a time-series fashion in each control cycle. When the general feedback controller 15 is to use the target air-fuel ratio KCMD determined by the exhaust-side control unit 7a (see STEPf in FIG. 10), the latest one of the time-series data of the target air-fuel ratio KCMD thus stored is selected.<br><br>
The process of evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 in STEP12 will be described below with reference to FIG. 16.<br>
The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b calculates the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function a determined according to the equation (15), from the time-series data V02(k), V02(k-l) of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6 which is calculated in STEP3 shown in FIG. 12, i.e., the present value of the differential output V02 and the past value thereof in the preceding control cycle, in STEP12-1.<br>
The values of the coefficients si, s2 used to calculate the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function a are identical to the values of the coefficients si, s2 used by the sliding mode controller 27 to determine the value of the switching function a bar.<br>
Then, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b determines the value of a flag F/DONE in STEP12-2. When the value of the flag F/DONE is "1", then it indicates that the evaluation of the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is completed during the present operation of the internal combustion engine 1, and when the value of the flag F/DONE is "0", then it indicates that the evaluation of the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is not completed during the present operation of the internal combustion engine 1. When the internal combustion en-<br><br>
gine 1 starts to operate, the value of the flag F/DONE is initialized to "0".<br>
If F/DONE = 0, i.e., if the evaluation of the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is not completed, then the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b performs a process of determining a varying state of the exhaust gas volume (the rate of flow of the exhaust gas through the exhaust pipe 2) in STEP12-3. More specifically, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b determines whether the exhaust gas volume is kept at a substantially constant level, i.e., in a cruise state, or not, and sets the value of a flag F/CRS. When the value of the flag F/CRS is "1", then it indicates that the exhaust gas volume is in the cruise state, and when the value of the flag F/CRS is "0", then it indicates that the exhaust gas volume is not in the cruise state.  The process of determining a varying state of the exhaust gas volume is carried out in a period of 1 second, for example (hereinafter referred to as "exhaust gas volume variation determining period") longer than the period (30 - 100 ms) of the control cycles of the exhaust-side control unit 7a, and is shown in detail in FIG. 17.<br>
As shown in FIG. 17, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b calculates an estimated value ABSV of the present exhaust gas volume (hereinafter referred to as "estimated exhaust gas volume") from the detected data of<br><br>
the present rotational speed NE and intake pressure PB of the internal combustion engine 1 according to the following equation (42) in STEP12-3-1:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In the present embodiment, the exhaust gas volume when the rotational speed of the internal combustion engine 1 is 1500 rpm is used as a reference. Therefore, the detected value of the rotational speed NE is divided by "1500" in the above equation (42).  In the equation (42), SVPRA represents a predetermined constant depending on the displacement of the internal combustion engine 1.<br>
instead of estimating the exhaust gas volume as described above, the exhaust gas volume may be estimated from the fuel supply quantity and intake air quantity of the internal combustion engine 1 or may be directly detected using flow sensor.<br>
Then, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b effects a predetermined filtering process on the estimated exhaust gas volume calculated in STEP12-3-1 in each exhaust gas volume variation determining period for thereby determining an exhaust gas volume variation parameter SVMA that represents the varying state of the exhaust gas volume in STEP12-3-2.<br><br>
The above filtering process is expressed by the following equation (43):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Specifically, the exhaust gas volume variation parameter SVMA is calculated by determining a moving average of changes of the estimated exhaust gas volume ABSV over a plurality of exhaust gas volume variation determining periods (three exhaust gas volume variation determining periods in the present embodiment).  In the equation (43), "n" represents the ordinal number of the cycle of the exhaust gas volume variation determining period.<br>
The exhaust gas volume variation parameter SVMA thus calculated represents a rate of change in the estimated exhaust gas volume ABSV. Consequently, as the value of the exhaust gas volume variation parameter SVMA is closer to "0", the time-dependent change of the estimated exhaust gas volume ABSV is smaller, i.e., the estimated exhaust gas volume ABSV is substantially constant.<br>
Then, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b compares the square of the exhaust gas volume variation parameter SVMA, i.e., the square SVMA2, with a predetermined value 6 in STEP12-3-3. The predetermined value &amp; is a positive value near "0".<br><br>
If SVMA2 ≥ δ, i.e., if the present exhaust gas volume suffers a relatively large variation, then the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b sets the value of a timer counter (count-down timer) TMCRSJUD to a predetermined initial value X/TMCRSJST in STEP12-3-4. As the exhaust gas volume is not in the cruise state, i.e., the exhaust gas volume is not kept at a substantially constant level, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b sets the flag F/CRS to "0" in STEP12-3-5, after which control returns to the main routine shown in FIG. 16.<br>
If SVMA2 
If TMCRSJUD ≤ 0, i.e., if the set time of the timer counter TMCRSJUD has elapsed, then the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b decides that the exhaust gas volume is in the cruise state, and holds the value of the timer counter TMCRSJUD to "0" in STEP12-3-8.  Then, the de-<br><br>
teriorated state evaluating means 13b sets the value of the flag F/CRS to "1" in STEP12-3-9, after which control returns to the main routine shown in FIG. 16.<br>
If TMCRSJUD &gt; 0 in STEP12-3-7, i.e., if the set time of the timer counter TMCRSJUD has not elapsed, then the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b sets the value of the flag F/CRS to "0" in STEP12-3-5, after which control returns to the main routine shown in FIG. 16.<br>
The processing sequence described above with reference to FIG. 17 represents the processing in STEP12-3 shown in FIG. 16. According to the processing in STEP12-3, if the square SVMA2 of the exhaust gas volume variation parameter SVMA is SVMA2 
The processing in STEP12-3 allows a proper recognition of the state in which the exhaust gas volume is maintained at a substantially constant level.  In each control cycle of the exhaust-side control unit 7a in one ex-<br><br>
haust gas volume variation determining period, the value of the flag F/CRS is kept constant.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 16, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b performs a process of calculating the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 in STEP12-4. The process of calculating the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 will be described below with reference to FIG. 18.<br>
The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b determines whether certain conditions for calculating the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 are satisfied or not in STEP12-4-1. The conditions include the value of the flag F/CRS set in STEP12-3 and the value of the flag f/prism/on set by the engine-side control unit 7b in STEPd shown in FIG. 10.<br>
If F/CRS = 1, i.e., if the exhaust gas volume is in the cruise state, then the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b decides that the condition for calculating tlie deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 (hereinafter referred to as "deterioration evaluating condition") is not satisfied. Therefore, without calculating the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2, control goes back to the main routine shown in FIG. 16.<br>
While the exhaust gas volume is in the cruise state, i.e., while exhaust gas volume is maintained at a substantially constant level, the deterioration evaluating<br><br>
parameter LSσ2 is not calculated for the following reason: In the cruise state, the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 is likely to be held stably to the target value V02/TARGET, and hence the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function a is less apt to change even when the deterioration of the catalytic converter 3 has progressed.  In the cruise state, therefore, the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function o does not tend to have a tendency depending on the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 described above with reference to FIG. 7.  In the present embodiment, therefore, the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 is not calculated in the cruise state.<br>
If f/prism/on = 0 in STEP12-4-1, i.e., if the operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is other than the normal operation mode in which the fuel supply of the internal combustion engine 1 is controlled depending on the target air-fuel ratio KCMD that is determined by the sliding mode controller 27 of the exhaust-side control unit 7a, then the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b also decides that the deterioration evaluating condition is not satisfied, and does not calculate the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2, and control returns to the main routine shown in FIG. 16. This is because for appropriately evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 with the deterioration evaluating parameter LScr2,<br><br>
it is preferable to determine the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2 using the data of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6 that is obtained while the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1 is being controlled depending on the target air-fuel ratio KCMD generated by the sliding mode controller 27 according to the adaptive sliding mode control process.<br>
In STEP12-4-1, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b also determines whether the speed of the vehicle with the internal combustion engine 1 mounted thereon is in a predetermined range or not, whether a certain time has elapsed after the startup of the internal combustion engine 1 or not, and whether the catalytic converter 3 has been activated or not.  If these conditions are not satisfied, then the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b determines that the deterioration evaluating condition is not satisfied. Therefore, without calculating the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2, control goes back to the main routine shown in FIG. 16.<br>
If the deterioration evaluating condition is satisfied in STEP12-4-1 (at this time, F/CRS = 0 and f/prism/on =1), then the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b calculates the square o2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function o determined in each control cycle of the exhaust-side control unit 7a in STEP12-1 shown in FIG. 16 in STEP12-4-2.<br><br>
of the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 and the gain parameter BP are used as their initial values. The initial values of the deterioration evaluating parameter LSor2 and the gain parameter BP at the time the internal combustion engine 1 operates for the first time are "0" and "I", respectively. The value of the counter CB1P is initialized to "0" at the time of the startup of the internal combustion engine 1.<br>
In FIG. 16, after calculating (updating) the value of the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 as described above, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b evaluates the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 based on the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 in STEP12-5. The process of evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 will be described below with reference to FIG. 19.<br>
The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b determines whether the present value BP(k) of the gain parameter BP and the preceding value BP(k-l) thereof are substantially equal to each other or not, i.e., whether the gain parameter BP has substantially been converged or not, in STEP12-5-1, and then determines whether or not the value of the counter CB1P is equal to or greater than a predetermined value CB1CAT, i.e., whether the number of values of the deterioration evaluating linear function o used to determine the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2 has<br><br>
reached the predetermined value CB1CAT or not, in STEP12-5-2.<br>
In the present embodiment, if the data of the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2 and the gain parameter BP are not held, i.e., if the values thereof are initialized to "0", as when the battery of the vehicle (not shown) is temporarily removed before the internal combustion engine 1 is started or as when the internal combustion engine 1 operates for the first time, then the predetermined value to be compared with the value of the counter CB1P in STEP12-5-2 is set to a value greater than if the data of the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2 and the gain parameter BP are held.<br>
If either of the conditions in STEP12-5-1 and STEP12-5-2 is not satisfied, then the deterioration evaluating parameter LSa2 determined in STEP12-4 in the present control cycle is considered to be not sufficiently converged to the central value of the square or2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function a. Therefore, the processing in STEP12-5 is finished without evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 based on the deterioration evaluating parameter LSa2.<br>
If either of the conditions in STEP12-5-1 and STEP12-5-2 is satisfied, then since the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2 determined in STEP12-4 in the present control cycle is representative of the central val-<br><br>
ue of the square σ2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function o, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b compares the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 with the threshold CATAGELMT shown in FIG. 8 in STEP12-5-3.<br>
If LSo2 £ CATAGELMT, then the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b decides that the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is in the deterioration-in-progress state in which it needs to be replaced immediately or soon. The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b controls the deterioration indicator 29 to indicate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 in STEP12-5-4. After setting the value of the flag F/DONE to "1", indicating that the evaluation of the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is completed, in STEP12-5-5. The processing in STEP12-5 is now finished.<br>
If LSo2 
The above processing represents the process that is carried out by the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b in STEP12 shown in FIG. 12.<br>
In the apparatus according to the above embodiment, the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a of the<br><br>
exhaust-side main processor 13 sequentially determines a target air-fuel ratio for the internal combustion engine I, i.e., a target value for the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter 3, according to the adaptive sliding mode control process in order to converge (settle) the output V02/OUT from the 02 sensor 6 downstream of the catalytic converter 3 to the target value V02/TARGET. The target air-fuel ratio calculating means 13a adjusts the amount of fuel injected into the internal combustion engine 1 in order to converge the output KACT of the LAF sensor 5 to the target air-fuel ratio KCMD, for thereby feedback-controlling the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1 at the target air-fuel ratio KCMD.  In this manner, the output signal V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 is converted to the target value V02/TARGET, and the catalytic converter 3 can maintain its optimum exhaust gas purifying performance without being affected by its own aging.<br>
Concurrent with the above control of the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b of the exhaust-side main processor 13 sequentially determines a deterioration evaluating linear function a from the time-series data of the differential output VO2 of the 02 sensor 6. The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b determines a deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2 as the central value (the central value of the minimum square in the present embodi-<br><br>
ment) of the square a2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function a, according to the sequential statistic processing algorithm (the algorithm of the method of weighted least squares in the present embodiment). The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b then compares the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 with the predetermined threshold CATAGELMT thereby to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3.<br>
In this fashion, it is possible to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 while maintaining the optimum purifying performance of the catalytic converter 3. Because the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 is the central value of the square a2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function a, its correlation to the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is high, so that the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 can appropriately be evaluated based on the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2.<br>
In the present embodiment/ in situations where the exhaust gas volume is maintained at a substantially constant level, i.e., in the cruise state, i.e., variations of the exhaust gas volume are small and the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function a is unlikely to change, the deterioration evaluating parameter LScr2 is not calculated.  In other situations, the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2 is calculated to evaluate the de-<br><br>
teriorated state of the catalytic converter 3. Therefore, the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo* representative of the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is highly reliable, allowing the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 to be evaluated accurately.<br>
The sliding mode controller 27 calculates a target air-fuel ratio KCMD to converge the estimated differential output V02 bar of the 02 sensor 6 determined by the estimator 26 to "0" and, as a result, to converge the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to the target value V02/TARGET.  It is thus possible to compensate for the effect of the dead time dl of the object exhaust system E and the effect of the dead time t2 of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system which is made up of the internal combustion engine 1 and the engine-side control unit 7b, and to increase the stability of the control process of converging the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to the target value V02/TARGET.  Inasmuch as the gain coefficients al, a2, bl which are parameters of the exhaust system model that is used by the sliding mode controller 27 and the estimator 26 in their processes are sequentially identified by the identifier 25, any effect that behavioral changes of the object exhaust system E have on the control process of converging the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to the target value V02/TARGET is held to a minimum. As a consequence, the control process of converging the output V02/OUT of the 02<br><br>
sensor 6 to the target value V02/TARGET can stably be carried out.<br>
In the apparatus according to the present embodiment, therefore, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 can be evaluated highly reliably while the desired purifying performance of the catalytic converter 3 is reliably maintained.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above first embodiment, but may be modified as follows:<br>
In the first embodiment, the central value of the minimum square a2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function a is used as the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2. However, the central value of the minimum square of the absolute value of the deterioration evaluating linear function σ may be determined as the deterioration evaluating parameter. According to such a modification, in STEP12-4 shown in FIG. 16, the absolute value of the deterioration evaluating linear function a is determined instead of the square σ2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function a, and "a2" in the equation (29) is replaced with the determined absolute value to obtain a deterioration evaluating parameter that exhibits the same tendency as the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo"2 with respect to the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3. By comparing the obtained deterioration evaluating parameter with a predetermined value, the deteriorated<br><br>
state of the catalytic converter 3 can be evaluated in the same manner as with the first embodiment.<br>
Rather than the square a2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function a or the central value of the minimum square of the absolute value, the central value of an average value of the square σ2 or the absolute value may be determined as the deterioration evaluating parameter. Alternatively, a variance of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function σ, or more accurately a variation with respect to "0" and an average value of the square o* of the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function a, or a standard deviation (the square root of a variance) may be determined as the deterioration evaluating parameter. The deterioration evaluating parameter thus determined exhibits the same tendency as the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 with respect to the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3. Therefore, by comparing the obtained deterioration evaluating parameter with a predetermined value, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 can be evaluated.<br>
In the first embodiment, the deterioration evaluating linear function a is determined according to the equation (15) whose variable components are represented by two time-series data of the differential output V02 of the O2 sensor 6. However, the deterioration evaluating linear function may be defined by a linear function whose variable<br><br>
components are represented by more time-series data of the differential output V02. According to such a modification, the switching function of the sliding mode control process is preferably defined by a linear function where the time-series data of the differential output V02 included in the deterioration evaluating linear function is replaced with the time-series data of the estimated differential output V02 bar.<br>
The deterioration evaluating linear function may alternatively be determined by an equation similar to the equation (15) where the differential outputs V02(k), V02(k-1) of the equation (15) are replaced with the outputs V02/OUT(k), VQ2/OUT(k-l) of the 02 sensor 6. According to this modification, the central value of the deterioration evaluating linear function is basically represented by "(sl+s2)«V02/TARGET".  If a parameter representing the degree to which the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function varies with respect to the central value (sl+s2)-V02/TARGET, such as the square of the difference between the central value (sl+s2)-V02/TARGET and the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function, or the central value of the minimum square of the absolute value, is determined as the deterioration evaluating parameter, then the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 can be evaluated in the same manner as with the first embodiment .<br><br>
Furthermore, a linear function whose variable components are represented by time-series data of the switching function a bar according to the equation (6), i.e., time-series data of the estimated differential output V02 bar of the 02 sensor 6, may be used as the deterioration evaluating linear function.  It is preferable for the purpose of increasing the reliability of the evaluated result to use the deterioration evaluating linear function a according to the equation (15) which employs the actual differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6 as a variable component, rather than the switching function a bar which employs the estimated differential output V02 bar that is an estimated value after the total dead time d of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6, because the deterioration evaluating linear function a better reflects the actual state of the catalytic converter 3.<br>
In the first embodiment, the square σ2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function σ is used to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3.  However, it is possible to use the product of the value of the linear function cr and its rate of change, which represents the stability determining parameter Pstb used in STEP9 to determine the stability of the SLD controlled state, for evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3.  In such a modification, if a variance of the product, or more generally a value representing the<br><br>
degree to which the value of the product varies, is determined as the deterioration evaluating parameter, then it is possible to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 based on the deterioration evaluating parameter thus determined.<br>
In the first embodiment, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is evaluated as one of the two states, i.e., the deterioration-in-progress state and the non-deteriorated state. However, if an increased number of thresholds are used for comparison with the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2, then the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 may be evaluated as three or more deteriorated states.  In this case, different evaluations may be indicated depending on those three or more deteriorated states.<br>
In the first embodiment, the algorithm of the sliding mode control process is constructed on the basis of an exhaust system model expressed as a discrete time system. However, the algorithm of the sliding mode control process may be constructed on the basis of a model which expresses the object exhaust system E as a continuous time system.  In this modification, the switching function for the sliding mode control process may be expressed by a linear function whose variable components are represented by the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6 and its rate of change, for example.<br><br>
In the first embodiment, the adaptive sliding mode control process is employed to calculate the target air-fuel ratio KCMD. However, the sliding mode control process which does not use the adaptive control law (adaptive algorithm) may be employed.  In this modification, the target air-fuel ratio KCMD may be determined according to an equation that is similar to the equation (28) except that the term of the adaptive control law input Uadp is removed therefrom.<br>
In the first embodiment, the effect of the total dead time d is compensated for by the estimator 26 in calculating the target air-fuel ratio KCMD.  If the dead time of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system is negligibly small, then only the dead time dl of the object exhaust system E may be compensated for.  In this modification, the estimator 26 sequentially determines in each control cycle the estimated value V02(k+dl) after the dead time dl of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6, according to the following equation (44) which is similar to the equation (12) except that "kcmd" and "d" are replaced respectively with "kact" and "dl":<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where al = the first-row,   first-column element of Adl,<br><br>
α2 = the first-row,  second-column element of Adl,<br>
ßj = the first-row elements of Aj-1B ral   <br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
In this modification, the sliding mode controller 27 determines in each control cycle the equivalent control input Ueq, the reaching control law input Urch, and the adaptive control law input Uadp according to equations which are similar to the equations (24) - (27) except that "d" is replaced with "dl", and adds the equivalent control input Ueq, the reaching control law input Urch, and the adaptive control law input Uadp to determine the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd for thereby determining the target air-fuel ratio KCMD which has been compensated for the effect of the dead time dl of the object exhaust system E.<br>
According to the above modification, the processing of the identifier 25, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b, and the engine-side control unit 7b may be the same as the processing thereof in the first embodiment .<br>
If the dead time dl of the object exhaust system E as well as the dead time dl of the air-fuel ratio manipulating system is negligibly small, then the estimator 26<br><br>
may be dispensed with.  In this modification, the processing operation of the sliding mode controller 27 and the identifier 25 may be performed with d = dl = 0.<br>
In the first embodiment, the identifier 25 is employed. However, the gain coefficients al, a2, bl of the exhaust system model may be of predetermined fixed values, or may be set to suitable values from the rotational speed and intake pressure of the internal combustion engine 1 using a map.<br>
In the first embodiment, the 02 sensor 6 is used as the exhaust gas sensor downstream of the catalytic converter 3. However, for maintaining the desired purifying performance of the catalytic converter 3, any of various other sensors may be employed insofar as they can detect the concentration of a certain component of the exhaust gas downstream of the catalytic converter to be controlled. For example, a CO sensor is employed if the carbon monoxide (CO) in the exhaust gas downstream of the catalytic converter is controlled, an NOx sensor is employed if the nitrogen oxide (NOx) in the exhaust gas downstream of the catalytic converter is controlled, and an HC sensor is employed if the hydrocarbon (HC) in the exhaust gas downstream of the catalytic converter is controlled.  If a three-way catalytic converter is employed, then it can be controlled to maximize its purifying performance irrespective of which of the above gas components is detected for<br><br>
its concentration.  If a reducing catalytic converter or an oxidizing catalytic converter is employed, then its purifying performance can be increased by directly detecting a gas component to be purified.<br>
In the first embodiment, the sliding mode control process is employed as the feedback control process for converging the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to the target value V02/TARGET. However, it is possible to employ another feedback control process to evaluate the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 while converging the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 to the target value VO2/TARGET. A second embodiment of the present invention which is directed to such an arrangement will be described below with reference to FIGS. 20 through 22.<br>
The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment only as to the functional structure and processing of the exhaust-side control unit 7a. Those structural and processing details of the second embodiment which are identical to those of the first embodiment are shown in identical figures and denoted by identical reference characters, and will not be described in detail below.<br>
FIG. 20 shows in block form a functional structure of an engine-side control unit 7a according to the second embodiment. As with the first embodiment, the engine-side control unit 7a according to the second embodiment performs, in given control cycles, a process of se-<br><br>
quentially generating a target air-fuel ratio KCMD (a target value for the air-fuel ratio detected by the LAF sensor 5) to converge the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 downstream of the catalytic converter 3 (see FIG. 1) to the target value V02/TARGET, and a process of evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3. The control cycles of the engine-side control unit 7a are of a constant period as with the first embodiment.<br>
For performing the above processes, the engine-side control unit 7a has the subtracter 12 for sequentially calculating a difference (= V02/OUT - V02/TARGET) between the output V02/OUT from the 02 sensor 6 and the target value V02/TARGET therefor, i.e., the differential output V02, and the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b for evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 using the time-series data of the differential output V02 and controlling the deterioration indicator 29 for its operation, as with the first embodiment. The engine-side control unit 7a also has a target air-fuel ratio calculating means 30 as an air-fuel ratio manipulated variable determining means for sequentially calculating the target air-fuel ratio KCMD from the data of the differential output V02 according to a PID (proportional plug integral plus derivative) control process which serves as one feedback control process.<br><br>
The processing of the subtracter 12 and the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b is identical to that of the first embodiment.  In the second embodiment, the values of the coefficients si, s2 of the deterioration evaluating linear function o required for the processing of the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b (see STEP12-1 shown in FIG. 16) may be identical to those used in the first embodiment. Basically, while the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine is being controlled depending on the target air-fuel ratio calculated by the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 30 as described later on, the values of the coefficients si, s2 for causing the value of the deterioration evaluating linear function a to clearly exhibit the tendency shown in FIGS. 5 through 7 with respect to the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 may be established through experimentation or the like.<br>
The target air-fuel ratio calculating means 30 comprises a PID controller 31 for sequentially generating an air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Upid required to converge the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6 to "0" according to the PID control process (described in detail later on), and an adder 32 for adding a predetermined air-fuel ratio reference value KBS to the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Upid thereby to calculate a target air-fuel ratio KCMD.<br><br>
The air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Upid is signified as a corrective quantity of the target air-fuel ratio KCMD with respect to the air-fuel ratio reference value KBS, and corresponds to the SLD manipulating input Usl (= the target differential air-fuel ratio kcmd) in the first embodiment. The air-fuel ratio reference value KBS added to the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Upid is a central air-fuel ratio for the target air-fuel ratio KCMD, and corresponds to the reference value FLAF/BASE in the first embodiment.  In the present embodiment, the air-fuel ratio reference value KBS is a value close to a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio which is determined from the detected values of the rotational speed NE and intake pressure PB of the internal combustion engine 1 using a predetermined map.<br>
Other details than the above exhaust-side control unit 7a, i.e., the functional arrangement of the engine-side control unit 7b and the arrangement of the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine 1, are exactly the same as those of the first embodiment.<br>
Operation of the apparatus according to the second embodiment, including detailed processing of the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 30, will be described below.<br>
The process performed by the engine-side control unit 7b is identical to the process in the first embodi-<br><br>
ment, and the processing sequence shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, i.e., the process of adjusting the fuel injection quantity of the internal combustion engine 1, is sequentially executed in control cycles in synchronism with the TDC (crankshaft angle period) by the engine-side control unit 7b. However, the target air-fuel ratio KCMD read by the engine-side control unit 7b in STEPf shown in FIG. 10 is the latest target air-fuel ratio KCMD that is calculated by the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 30 of the exhaust-side control unit 7a.<br>
In the present embodiment, the exhaust-side control unit 7a executes a main routine shown in FIG. 21 in given control cycles concurrent with the processing of the engine-side control unit 7b.<br>
Specifically, the exhaust-side control unit 7a determines the air-fuel ratio reference value KBS from the present rotational speed NE and intake pressure PB of the internal combustion engine 1 using a predetermined map in STEP21.<br>
Then, the exhaust-side control unit 7a determines the value of the flag f/prism/on which is set by the engine-side control unit 7b in STEPd shown in FIG. 10 in STEP22.  If f/prism/on = 0, i.e., if the operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is not the normal operation mode in which the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1 is manipulated to converge the output<br><br>
V02/OUT of the O2 sensor 6 to the target value V02/TARGET, then the exhaust-side control unit 7a sets the target air-fuel ratio KCMD(k) in the present control cycle to the air-fuel ratio reference value KBS determined in STEP21 in STEP30. Thereafter, the processing in the present control cycle is put to an end.<br>
If f/prism/on = 1 in STEP22, i.e., if the operation mode of the internal combustion engine 1 is the normal operation mode, then the subtracter 12 calculates the latest differential output V02(k) (= V02/OUT - V02/TARGET) of the 02 sensor 6 in STEP23.  Specifically, the subtracter 12 selects the latest one of the time-series data of the output VO2/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 which have been read and stored in the non-illustrated memory in STEPa shown in FIG. 10, and calculates the differential output V02(k). The differential output V02(k), including data calculated in the past (i.e., the differential output V02(k-l) calculated in the preceding control cycle), is stored in a memory (not shown).<br>
Then, the exhaust-side control unit 7a performs the processing of the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 30 in STEP24 - STEP27.<br>
The PID controller 31 of the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 30 determines the values of respective gain coefficients KVP, KVI, KVD of proportional, integral, and derivative terms relative to the PID control process for converging the differential output V02 of the<br><br>
O2 sensor 6 to "0", from the present rotational speed NE and intake pressure PB of the internal combustion engine 1 using a predetermined map in STEP24.<br>
Then, the PID controller 31 calculates the equations (45) - (47), shown below, using present and preceding values V02(k), V02(k-l) of the differential output V02 of the 02 sensor 6 determined in STEP23, and the latest gain coefficients KVP, KVI, KVD determined in STEP24, to determine present values VREFP(k), VREFI(k), VREFD(k) of the proportional, integral, and derivative terms, respectively. The PID controller 31 also adds the present values VREFP(k), VREFI(k), VREFD(k) of the proportional, integral, and derivative terms according to the equation (48), shown below, to determine a basic manipulated variable VREF as a basis for the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Usl in STEP25.<br>
VREFP(k) =V02(k)-KVP	(45)<br>
VREFI(k) = VREFI(k-l) + V02(k)«KVI      (46) VREFD(k) = (V02(k) - V02(k-l))'KVD      (47) VREF = VREFP(k) + VREFI(k) + VREFD(k)    (48) Furthermore, the PID controller 31 performs a limiting process for limiting the basic manipulated variable VREF in STEP26.  In the limiting process, if the basic manipulated variable VREF determined in STEP25 exceeds a predetermined upper or lower limit, the PID controller 31<br><br>
forcibly limits the basic manipulated variable VREF to the upper or lower limit.<br>
Then, the PID controller 31 determines an air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Upid from the limited basic manipulated variable VREF using a predetermined data table shown in FIG. 22.<br>
The data table shown in FIG. 22 is basically arranged such that as the basic manipulated variable VREF is larger, the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Upid is larger.  In a range of values of the basic manipulated variable VREF, i.e., a range S in FIG. 22, that are determined by the PID controller 31 while the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 is converged substantially closely to the target value V02/TARGET, the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Upid changes to a small degree as the basic manipulated variable VREF changes, and is held substantially closely to "0". This is because in the vicinity of the target value V02/TARGET, the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 greatly changes even when the air-fuel ratio changes slightly, as indicated by the solid-line curve a in FIG. 2.<br>
After determining the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Upid, the adder 32 of the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 30 adds the air-fuel ratio reference value KBS to the air-fuel ratio manipulated variable Upid, thus determining the target air-fuel ratio KCMD(k) in the present control cycle in STEP28.<br><br>
The target air-fuel ratio KCMD thus determined is stored in a memory (not shown) in a time-series fashion in each control cycle of the exhaust-side control unit 7a. When the engine-side control unit 7b reads the target air-fuel ratio KCMD in STEPf shown in FIG. 10, it selects the latest data of the target air-fuel ratio KCMD thus stored in the memory.<br>
After the target air-fuel ratio calculating means 30 has determined the target air-fuel ratio KCMD as described above, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b performs a process of evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 in STEP29.  The process of evaluating the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 performed by the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b in STEP29 is exactly the same as the process in the first embodiment. Specifically, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b carries out the processing sequence shown in FIGS. 16 through 19 as described above, using the time-series data of the differential output V02 of the O2 sensor 6 determined in each control cycle in STEP23. The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b evaluates the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 as the deterio-ration-in-progress state or the non-deteriorated state.  If the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is the deterioration-in-progress state, then the deteriorated state is indicated by the deterioration indicator 29.<br><br>
In the apparatus according to the second embodiment, as with the first embodiment, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is evaluated while the air-fuel ratio of the internal combustion engine 1 is being manipulated to converge the output V02/OUT of the 02 sensor 6 downstream of the catalytic converter 3 to the target value V02/TARGET.  Therefore, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 can be evaluated while maintaining the appropriate purifying performance of the catalytic converter 3.<br>
Since the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is evaluated in exactly the same manner as with the first embodiment, the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 can be evaluated appropriately based on the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 whose correlation to the deteriorated state of the catalytic converter 3 is high and which is highly reliable.<br>
In the present embodiment, the exhaust-side control unit 7a performs its processing in control cycles of a constant period. However, the exhaust-side control unit 7a may perform its processing in synchronism with the TDC with the engine-side control unit 7b, or in control cycles of a period which is several times (plural times) one TDC.<br>
The deterioration evaluating parameter and the evaluation of the deteriorated state of the catalytic con-<br><br>
verter 3 based thereon may be modified in the same fashion as with the first embodiment as described above.<br>
Industrial applicability:<br>
As is clear from the above description, according to the present invention, the deteriorated state of a catalytic converter such as a three-way catalytic converter, which is disposed in the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine loaded in an automobile or a hybrid vehicle, can be evaluated automatically and appropriately, thus the present invention is effective for use, e.g., in reporting the evaluation results.<br>
The deteriorated state evaluating means 13b calculates a new deterioration evaluating parameter LSo^(k) from the present value o^k) of the square o2, the present value LSo^k-l) of the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2, and the present value BP(k-l) of the gain parameter BP determined by the recursive formula expressed by the equation (30), according to the equation (29) in STEP12-4-3.<br>
After updating the value of the gain parameter BP according to the equation (30) in STEP12-4-4, the deteriorated state evaluating means 13b increments, by "I", the value of a counter CB1P which counts the number of times that the deterioration evaluating parameter LSσ2 and the gain parameter BP are updated, which number corresponds to the number of values of the deterioration evaluating linear function a used to determine the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2, in STEP12-4-5.  Thereafter, control returns to the main routine shown in FIG. 16.<br>
The values of the deterioration evaluating parameter LSo2 and the gain parameter BP which are determined respectively in STEP12-4-3 and STEP12-4-4 are stored in a nonvolatile memory such as an EEPROM or the like (not shown) when the internal combustion engine 1 is shut off, so that those values will not be lost when the internal combustion engine 1 is not operating. When the internal combustion engine 1 operates next time, the stored values<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
