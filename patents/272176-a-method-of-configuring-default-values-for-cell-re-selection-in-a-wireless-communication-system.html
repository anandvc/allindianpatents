				<td>A METHOD OF CONFIGURING DEFAULT VALUES FOR CELL RE-<br>
SELECTION IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of configuring default values, and more<br>
particularly, to a method of configuring default values for cell re-selection in a wireless<br>
communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) was developed to bring together<br>
different communication systems. Further, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)<br>
introduced packet switched data into GSM systems. The GPRS provides packet data service<br>
which means that multiple users can share the same transmission channel, only transmitting<br>
when there is data to send. GSM can be referred to as circuit-switched data service which<br>
establishes a radio resource (RR) connection and reserves the full bandwidth of that circuit-<br>
switched data during the lifetime of the RR connection. The difference with packet data<br>
service is that the packet data service can have total available bandwidth dynamically<br>
dedicated to those users who are actually sending at any given moment, providing higher<br>
utilization where users only send or receive data intermittently.<br>
Enhanced Data Rate for GSM Evolution (EDGE) introduced 8-phase shift keying<br>
(8-PSK) into GSM/GPRS networks. EDGE can use 8-PSK as well as Gaussian Minimum<br><br>
Shift Keying (GMSK) of GSM as the modulation scheme. With an exception of modulation<br>
scheme of GPRS, most of non-modulation techniques of GPRS can be applied to EDGE.<br>
In the GSM, the GPRS, and/or the EDGE can be in various states or modes such as<br>
an idle mode, packet transfer mode, packet idle mode, and dual transfer mode. Here, the<br>
packet idle mode is based on packet switched (PS) service and is used when there is no<br>
traffic between a mobile station (MS) and a network.<br>
As known, the MS can enjoy mobility between cells/sectors. In addition, the MS can<br>
move from one cell/sector to another cell/sector during various modes (e.g., idle mode). To<br>
put differently, the MS can move from a source cell to a target cell during idle mode. Here,<br>
the source cell refers to a cell in which the MS is currently located, and the target cell refers<br>
to the cell to which the MS seeks to enter or move. The process describing movement from<br>
the source cell to the target cell can be referred to as cell re-selection process.<br>
DISLCOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL SOLUTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method of configuring default<br>
values for cell re-selection in a wireless communication system that substantially obviates<br>
one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of configuring values of<br>
cell re-selection parameters for cell re-selection from a serving cell to a neighboring cell in<br>
a wireless communication system.<br><br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part<br>
in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary<br>
skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the<br>
invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and<br>
attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof<br>
as well as the appended drawings.<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of<br>
the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method of configuring values of<br>
cell re-selection parameters for cell re-selection from a serving cell to a neighboring cell in<br>
a wireless communication system includes receiving from a network a first message via a<br>
first control channel, wherein the first message includes values of a first group of cell<br>
selection parameters, assigning pre-stored values of the cell selection parameters for the<br>
serving cell to values of a second group of the cell selection parameters, if the first message<br>
does not include the values of the second group of the cell selection parameters, and<br>
calculating the values of the cell re-selection parameters using the values of the first and the<br>
second groups of the cell selection parameters.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following<br>
detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are<br>
intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding<br>
of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this application, illustrate<br>
embodiment(s) of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the<br>
principle of the invention. In the drawings;<br>
FIG. 1A is an exemplary diagram illustrating reception of a packet measurement<br>
order message from the network;<br>
FIG. 1B is an exemplary diagram illustrating calculation of a packet measurement<br>
order message from the network; and<br>
FIG. 2 is an exemplary flowchart illustrating a process of setting the default values.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the<br>
same or like parts.<br>
Figure 1A is an exemplary diagram illustrating reception of a packet measurement<br>
order message from the network. By transmitting the packet measurement order message,<br>
the network orders the MS to calculate necessary parameter(s) for cell re-selection and<br>
provides information for network control measurement (NC) reporting. If the parameters for<br><br>
the NC measurements are not included, then a previous packet measurement order message<br>
belonging to the same set of messages can still be considered valid.<br>
The packet measurement order message from the network can be transmitted to the<br>
MS on a packet common control channel (PCCCH) or a packet associated control channel<br>
(PACCH). If the information does not fit into one message (or the size of the information<br>
exceeds the message capacity), the remaining information can be sent in other packet<br>
measurement order message.<br>
Figure 1B is an exemplary diagram illustrating calculation of a packet measurement<br>
order message from the network. More specifically, the MS can use the information<br>
included in the packet measurement order message (e.g., neighbor cell measurement<br>
reporting) to calculate the parameter(s) for cell re-selection. In calculating the parameter(s),<br>
default value(s) can be used as well. Thereafter, the MS can transmit a packet measurement<br>
result message, including the calculated parameter(s), to the network.<br>
A detailed description of the packet measurement order message as well as<br>
information related to neighbor cells will be described hereinafter.<br>
A packet measurement order message includes network control (NC) measurement<br>
parameters. The NC measurement parameters provides the parameters for the serving cell<br>
and may contain frequency list deviations (add/delete) to the GPRS, for example, either on<br>
the PBCCH or on broadcast control channel (BCCH). As shown below in a part of a packet<br>
measurement order information elements table, Table 1, the NC measurement parameters<br>
are included as an optional element in the packet measurement order message.<br><br><br>
The "NC measurement parameters struct" contains the network control order, the<br>
NC parameters, and an NC frequency list struct. If the value of the network control order or<br>
any of the NC parameters differs between instances of the message, the value of the<br>
parameter in the instance with the highest PMOINDEX can be used or considered valid<br>
and all others can be ignored.<br>
The purpose of the PMOINDEX field and the PMO_COUNT field is to indicate<br>
the number of individual messages within the sequence of the packet measurement order<br>
messages and to assign an index to identify each one of them. The PMO_INDEX field is<br>
binary coded with a range of 0 to 7, and provides an index to identify the individual packet<br>
measurement order message. Similarly, the PMO_COUNT field is binary coded with a<br>
range of 0 to 7, and provides the PMO_INDEX value for the last (highest indexed) message<br>
is the sequence of packet measurement order messages. Furthermore, the measurement<br>
order is not affected by the MS until all instances of the packet measurement order message<br>
are received.<br>
If global TFI field is present, this information element indicates the MS to which<br>
this message is addressed. In addition, if TLLI/G-RNTI, which is a 32-bit field, is present,<br>
this field also indicates the MS to which this message is addressed.<br><br>
As optional element, the packet measurement order message may or may not include<br>
the NC Measurement parameters. If the message includes these parameters, the structure of<br>
the NC measurement parameters can be shown as in Table 2.<br><br>
Referring to Table 2, the NC measurement parameters include mandatory elements<br>
as well as optional elements. More specifically, as a mandatory requirement, the NC<br>
measurement parameter may include the NETWORK_CONTROL_ORDER parameter.<br>
Moreover, as the optional parameters NC_NON_DRX_PERIOD_I, NC_REPORTING_<br>
PERIOD_T, and the NC_FREQUENCY_ LIST may be included. Each of these optional<br>
parameters can be represented by a 3-bit field.<br>
Furthermore, the NETWORK_CONTROL_ORDER field can be coded according to<br>
the following table - Table 3.<br><br>
As an element of the NC measurement parameters, the NC_FREQUENCY_LIST<br>
parameter can be provided as optional element. If, however, the NC_FREQUENCY_LIST<br>
is present, then an exemplary structure of the list can be as follows as shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
As emphasized by bold type, a list of added frequency structure can be included in<br>
the NC frequency list. As shown in Table 4, the NR_OF_REMOVED_FREQ is a 5 bit field,<br>
and l+val(NR_OF_REMOVED_FREQ) indicates the number of frequencies in the list<br>
which may not be used for NC measurements and provides the number of instances of the<br>
parameter REMOVEDFREQ_NDEX.<br>
In addition, the REMOVED_FREQ_INDEX is a 6-bit field and is used to indicate<br>
the index to the frequency to be removed in the GPRS sent on the PBCCH or on the BCCH.<br>
Further, included in the "NC frequency list struct" can be a deviation list which<br>
contains removed or added frequencies to a different list (e.g., GPRS list).<br>
As one of the optional elements of the list of added frequency structure, cell<br>
selection parameters can be included. Hence, if the cell selection parameters (emphasized in<br>
bold) are included in the list of added frequency structure, then a cell structure comprising<br>
the cell selection parameters can be shown as in Table 5.<br><br><br>
Referring to Table 5, the "Add Frequency list struct" contains the frequency list for<br>
the NC parameters. More specifically, START_FREQUENCY, FREQ_DIFF_LENGTH,<br>
and FREQUENCY_DIFF are represented by a 10-bit field, a 3-bit field, and a<br>
(l+val(FREQ_DIFF_LENGTH) bit field, respectively. Moreover, the BSIC is a 6-bit field<br>
and is encoded as the "Base Station Identity Code" with a range of 0 to 63.<br>
The "Cell selection params" in the "Add Frequency list struct" can be present for the<br>
first neighbor cell added by the message. As an abnormal case, if the "Cell selection<br>
params" is missed (not present) for the first neighbor cell added by the message, then the<br>
same parameters as the serving cell can be applied as default value.<br>
Furthermore, a structure (or cell selection structure) of the cell selection parameters<br>
can be represented as in Table 6.<br><br>
Referring to Table 6, the parameters, such as GPRS_RXLEV_ ACCESS_MIN,<br>
GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH,	GPRS_TEMPORARY_OFFSET,<br>
GPRS_PENALTY_TIME, GPRS_RESELECT_OFFSET, PRIORITY_CLASS OF HCS<br><br>
pararns, HCS_THR, and SI13_PBCCH_L0CATI0N, are optional parameters that can be<br>
used to cell re-selection.<br>
With respect to the packet measurement order message, if any parameter or a part of<br>
a parameter (e.g., element) related to neighboring cell(s) is not included, there is no default<br>
value that can be used in its place. More detailed discussions related to unavailability of the<br>
default value(s) is discussed below in terms of possible cases or situations.<br>
The discussion of default values for the parameters associated with the first<br>
neighboring cell in the packet measurement order message as shown below in following<br>
cases or situations (Case#l - Case#3) can be found in Table 11.2.9b.2 of section 12.2.9b of<br>
3GPP TS 44.060 V.6.180. The same parameters, as described below, can also be found in<br>
3GPP TS 44.060 V7.5.0.<br>
First, consider a case (i.e., Case #1) in which cell selection parameters are not<br>
provided (or missed) in the packet measurement order message but the PCCCH is present in<br>
the serving cell. Table 7 illustrates this case.<br><br><br>
As indicated in this case, if the cell selection parameters (or cell selection params)<br>
are not provided for the first neighbor cell added by the message, then the same parameters<br>
as the serving cell can be applied as the default value.<br>
Second, Case #2 considers where the cell selection parameters are not provided (or<br>
present) in the packet measurement order message and the PCCCH is also not provided (or<br>
present) in the serving cell, as shown in Table 8.<br><br>
Third, Case #3 considers where the cell selection parameters are provided (or<br>
present) in the packet measurement order message but the optional parameters are not<br>
provided (or present) in whole or in part.<br><br>
The definitions of the parameters, such as CELL_BAR_ACCESS_2, EXCACC,<br>
SAME_RA_AS_SERVING_CELL,	GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN,	RXLEV<br>
_ACCESS_MIN, GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH, GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH,<br>
GPRS_TEMPORARY_OFFSET, GPRS_PENALTY_TIME, GPRS_RESELECT_OFFSET,<br>
HCS_THR, PRIORITY_CLASS, and SI13_PBCCH_LOCATION, are provided in 3GPP<br><br>
TS 45.008 or 3GPP TS 44.060. Therefore, discussions related to definitions of these<br>
parameters will be omitted.<br>
Furthermore, default values are provided to address possibilities of Cases #1 - #3. A<br>
packet system information type 3 (PSD) includes the parameters used as default values for<br>
optional parameters in the packet measurement order message, and a PSD message is<br>
usually transmitted via a packet broadcast control channel (PBCCH). However, as discussed,<br>
the packet measurement order message is based on the PCCCH, and as a result, the origin of<br>
the default value(s) may become ambiguous.<br>
In short, since the parameters are defined with respect to the PCCCH, the MS may<br>
not be able to perform efficient and/or effective cell re-selection since the PBCCH was not<br>
considered in order to get the information from a PSD message.<br>
As discussed, the MS can freely move from one cell to another cell in the wireless<br>
communication environment. It is also possible for the MS to move to another cell while in<br>
a packet idle mode. Here, the cell which currently hosts the MS can be referred to as a<br>
source cell, and the cell to which the MS moves to can be referred to as a target cell.<br>
If the MS moves from the source cell to the target cell during the packet idle mode,<br>
the MS can perform cell re-selection. Prior to performing the cell re-selection process, the<br>
MS receives a packet measurement order message from the network, requesting the MS to<br>
measure various information for cell re-selection.<br>
The MS uses the information related to neighbor cells (or list) included in the packet<br>
measurement order message and calculates certain parameters associated with cell re-<br><br>
selection. For example, the MS can calculate a cell ranking criterion parameter (i.e., C32).<br>
Here, C32 can be used for selection of a specific cell from the neighboring cell(s) having<br>
the same priority and can be defined as follows as shown in Equation 1.<br>
[Equation 1]<br>
C32(s) = Cl(s)<br>
C32(n) = Cl(n) + GPRS_RESELECT_OFFSET(n) - T0(n) * (1 - L(n))<br>
Referring to Equation 1, C32(s) and C32(n) respectively denote the cell priority of<br>
parameters associated with the serving cell and the neighboring cell. Moreover, Cl(s) and<br>
Cl(n) denote a path loss criterion parameter for the serving cell and the neighboring cell,<br>
respectively. The path loss criterion parameter, or C1, can be defined by Equation 2.<br>
[Equation 2]<br>
Cl=(A-Max(B, 0))<br>
A = RLA_P - GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN<br>
B = GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH - P<br>
Referring to Equation 2, RLA_P denotes received level averages, and<br>
GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN denotes a minimum received signal level requested to the<br>
MS for system access. Moreover, GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH denotes a maximum<br>
transmit power level requested to the MS for system access until other order is given, and P<br>
denotes a maximum radio frequency (RF) output power by the MS.<br><br>
In Equation 1, GPRS_RESELECT_OFFSET parameter is for applying prescribed<br>
offset value and/or hysteresis value to each cell. In addition, T0(n) and L(n) can be further<br>
defined as follows as shown in Equation 3.<br>
[Equation 3]<br>
T0(n) = GPRS_TEMPORARY _OFFSET(n) * H(GPRS_PENALTY_TIME(n) - T(n))<br>
L(n) = 0 if PRIORlTY_CLASS(n) = PRIORITY_CLASS(s)<br>
= 1 if PRIORITY_CLASS(n) # PRIORITY_CLASS(s)<br>
Referring to Equation 3, GPRS_TEMPORARY_OFFSET indicates a negative offset<br>
which is applied to C31/C32 during GPRS_PENALTY_TIME after timer, T, is initiated in<br>
the corresponding cell. Here, timer T is initiated for each cell selected from a list of carriers<br>
having the strongest signals. In other words, timer T is initiated for cells having the<br>
strongest signals. If the MS moves to one of the cells having the strongest signals, then<br>
timer T is initiated starting from 0. However, if the serving cell is one of the cells listed in<br>
the list during the cell re-selection process, timer T is set to the value of<br>
GPRS_PENALTY_TIME. Moreover, H(x) = 0 (for x  0).<br>
As discussed, parameters such as GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN, GPRS_MS_<br>
TXPWR_MAX_CCH, GPRS_RESELECT_OFFSET, GPRS_TEMPORARY_ OFFSET,<br>
GPRS_PENALTY_TIME, PRIORITYCLASS, and PRIORITY_CLASS, HCSTHR,<br>
SI13_PBCCH_LOCATION are optional parameters.<br><br>
If these optional parameters are excluded or not present in the packet measurement<br>
order message for the first neighbor cell, default value(s) can be used instead. As discussed,<br>
with respect to cell re-selection, there can be complications associated with<br>
PCCCH/PACCH-based packet measurement order message in terms of using the default<br>
values, especially if the PBCCH is present in the serving cell. The following<br>
discussions/examples address situations take into account reference to system information<br>
received on the broadcast control channel (e.g., PBCCH) for configuring default values<br>
associated with cell re-selection.<br>
Depending on the situation of the MS, the default value(s) can be configured<br>
accordingly. The following are examples of four (4) cases. For more detailed description,<br>
Figure 2 can be referred to as an exemplary flowchart illustrating a process of setting the<br>
default values.<br>
First, Case #1 represents a situation where cell selection parameters for the<br>
neighboring cell(s) are not provided (or not present) in the packet measurement order<br>
message but PBCCH is provided in the serving cell. Hence, the PSI3 message can be<br>
received via the PBCCH. Here, the MS can refer to PSI3 message received via the PBCCH<br>
and set/assign the default values for the parameters which are excluded (or not present) in<br>
the received packet measurement order message for the first neighbor cell. That is, the MS<br>
uses the parameter values of the PSI3 message and assigns the same values to the<br>
corresponding parameters whose values are not provided in the packet measurement order<br>
message. As for the remaining parameters, predetermined default values can be used.<br><br>
The PSI3 message is transmitted via the PBCCH, and the structure: of the PSD<br>
message including the mandatory parameters are shown in Table 10.<br><br>
Referring to Table 10, the serving cell parameters included in the PSI3 message<br>
include CELL_BAR_ACCESS_2, EXC_ACC, GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN,<br>
GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH, MULTIBAND_REPORTING, HCS_THR of HCS<br>
struct, and PRIORITY_CLASS.<br>
If the HCS struct is omitted for the serving cell, HCS is not used and the HCS<br>
parameters for the other cells can be neglected (i.e., the HCS signal strength threshold shall<br>
be set to infinity for all cells). Otherwise PRIORITY_CLASS and HCSJTHR are defined.<br>
The use of the HCS parameters is defined in 3GPP TS 45.008 (See Table 6).<br>
The default values associated with Case #1 can be defined as follows as shown in<br><br><br><br><br>
Second, Case #2 represents a situation where cell selection parameters are not<br>
provided (or present) in the packet measurement order message and the PBCCH is also not<br>
provided (or present) in the serving cell.<br><br>
Referring to Table 12, the PBCCH is not present in the serving cell.<br>
In such a case, the PSI3 message cannot be received via the PBCCH. Therefore, the<br>
MS can rely on a system information type 3 (SI3) message, which is transmitted via a<br>
broadcast control channel (BCCH), to apply the default value(s) for the mandatory<br>
parameter(s) for the neighboring cell(s).<br>
Similarly to above, the MS uses the parameter values of the SI3 message and assigns<br>
the same values to the corresponding parameters whose values are not provided in the<br>
packet measurement order message.<br>
The SI3 message can include various elements as shown in Table 13.<br><br><br><br><br>
A more detailed description of the information elements (IE) of the cell selection<br>
parameters (in bold) are shown in Figure 14.<br><br>
The cell selection parameters list included in the SB message includes the cell<br>
selection parameters IE list. Furthermore, mandatory parameters such as<br>
MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH and RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN are assigned to prescribed octets<br>
(e.g., Octet 2 and Octet 3) of the cell selection parameters IE list.<br>
The default values of the first neighbor cell(s) with respect to Case #2 is shown in<br><br><br>
Third, Case #3 represents a situation where the cell selection parameters for the first<br>
neighbor cell are provided (or present) in the packet measurement order message but some<br>
of the optional parameters are not provided and the PBCCH is not provided (or present) in<br>
the serving cell.<br>
In this case, the SB message transmitted on the BCCH can be referred to by the MS<br>
to apply the necessary default values for the first neighbor cell. That is, the MS uses the<br>
parameter values of the SB message and assigns the same values to the corresponding<br>
parameters whose values are not provided in the packet measurement order message.<br>
Further, the optional parameters which are not present in the message can be affected by the<br>
following parameters as shown in Table 16.<br><br>
Fourth, Case #4 represents a situation where the cell selection parameters for the<br>
first neighbor cell are provided (or present) in the packet measurement order message but<br>
some of the optional parameters are not provided and the PBCCH is provided (or present) in<br>
the serving cell. This is shown in Table 17 as follows.<br><br><br><br>
Referring to Table 17, unlike in Case #2 and Case #3 in which the SB message was<br>
looked at since the PBCCH was not present. However, in Case #4, the PBCCH is present in<br>
the serving cell and hence, the PS13 message can be referred to for applying the default<br>
value(s) for the first neighbor cell. That is, the MS uses the parameter values of the PSI3<br>
message and assigns the same values to the corresponding parameters whose values are not<br>
provided in the packet measurement order message.<br>
In the discussion of above with respect to Cases #1 - #4, the PBCCH of the serving<br>
cell is referred to for applying the default value(s) for the first neighboring cell, and the<br>
default value(s) can be derived from (or based on) the PSD or SI3 message transmitted on<br>
the PBCCH or BCCH, respectively. In particular, the cell selection parameters exist but do<br>
not provide certain parameters, the parameter values provided in the PSI3 (or SI3) message<br>
can be used. Furthermore, a default value for GPRS_TEMPORARY_OFFSET parameter<br>
can be set to "0 dB," and a default value for GPRS_PENALTY_TIME parameter can be set<br>
as "undefined" so that C32(s) = Cl(s) and C32(n) = C1 (n) can be established in Equation 1.<br>
Further, the discussion above related to cell re-selection can be implemented in an<br>
apparatus. That is, an apparatus associated with wireless communication system can be used<br>
to implement the cell re-selection process.<br>

for the serving cell are received from a network in a second message via a second control<br>
channel.<br>
5.	The method of claim 4, wherein the second control channel is a packet<br>
broadcast control channel (PBCCH), and the second message is a packet system<br>
information type 3 (PSI3) message.<br>
6.	The method of claim 4, wherein the second group of the cell selection<br>
parameters includes GPRS_RESELECT_OFFSET and GPRS_TEMPORARY_OFFSET,<br>
and one of the cell re-selection parameters is a cell ranking criterion parameter (C32) for<br>
selection of a specific cell from neighboring cells, and the cell ranking criterion parameter is<br>
defined as<br>
C32(s) = Cl(s)<br>
