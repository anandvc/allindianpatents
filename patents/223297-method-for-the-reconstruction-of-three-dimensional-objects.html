Method for the reconstruction of three-dimensional objects<br>
The invention relates to a method for the computer-aided reconstruction of a three-dimensional anatomical object from diagnostic image data, having the method steps:<br>
a)	acquisition of a diagnostic image data set of an object,<br>
b)	setting of a seed point belonging to the object within a reconstruction volume,<br>
c)	location of an adjacent point, likewise belonging to the object, within the reconstruction volume in accordance with a propagation criterion, which is calculated by means of a mathematical analysis of local areas, assigned to the point concerned, of the image data set,<br>
d)	reconstruction of the three-dimensional structure of the object within the reconstruction volume by multiple repetition of method step c) and propagation along the adjacent points thus located.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to a computer program and an imaging apparatus with* computer means for performing this method.<br>
In the field of angiography, three-dimensional medical imaging methods, such as for example three-dimensional rotational X-ray imaging (3D-RX) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are growing in importance. The volume image data obtained with such methods contain interesting information for diagnosis of vessel diseases, such as for example stenoses or aneurysms. In such cases, visualization of the vessel structures is crucial in allowing a doctor treating the condition to recognize quickly and reliably potential danger sources (e.g. an impending infarction or thrombosis).<br>
Computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction of the vessel system of a patient from the image data acquired on the one hand allows the profile of the blood vessels to be visualized with high reproduction accuracy, anatomical structures not belonging to the vessel system concerned being hidden. On the other hand, the three-dimensional reconstruction of the vessel structures is a useful aid in planning interventions, such as for example left coronary catheter investigations (PTCA).<br><br>
A three-dimensional reconstruction method for analyzing volume image data acquired by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is known for example from an article by Young et al (S. Young, V. Pekar and J. Weese, â€žVessel Segmentation for Visualization of MRA with Blood Pool Contrast Agent", MICCAI2001,491-498, Utrecht, October 2001). The previously known method serves, inter alia, to separate the arterial and venous vessel systems from one another during visualization of the image data. According to the previously known method, first of all a diagnostic image data set is acquired in the form of a volume image of the vessel structures of interest, using a suitable contrast agent. Then, a user sets a seed point within a reconstruction volume, this seed point being identified by the user as belonging to a venous vessel. Automatic three-dimensional reconstruction of the selected vessel then takes place by means of a propagation method, which is based on a mathematical analysis of the respective local image areas. Stalling from the seed point, points within the reconstruction volume are identified, in accordance with a propagation criterion supplied by the mathematical analysis, as belonging or not belonging to the vessel, whereby segmentation of the reconstruction volume takes place. Propagation continues until the entire structure has been reconstructed or until a set end point is reached. The mathematical analysis applied for calculation of the propagation criterion is of fundamental importance to the previously known method. In the stated article, a mathematical filter is proposed in this respect, which is based on evaluation of the second derivatives of the gray scale values within the local image areas. A proposed alternative involves adaptation of the local image data to a cylinder model, by means of which the mathematical analysis is rendered selective for image structures typical of blood vessels.<br>
In rotational X-ray imaging, a plurality of two-dimensional projection images is recorded at different projection angles, for example by means of a C-arm X-ray apparatus. To make the blood vessels of the patient under investigation visible in the projection images, an X-ray absorbent contrast agent is injected into the patient. A problem with this investigation method is that the blood vessels typically have a complicated three-dimensional profile, which it is difficult for the doctor to detect solely on the basis of two-dimensional projection images. The missing three-dimensional information within a projection image must be added by the doctor by comparison with images recorded at other projection angles.<br>
It is now possible to generate a volume image data set from the plurality of two-dimensional projection images recorded by means of 3D-RX using suitable modeling or back projection methods on a suitable computer. This volume image data set may then undergo an analysis of the type outlined above for the purpose of reconstruction of the three-<br><br>
dimensional vessel structures. This procedure, however, is disadvantageous^ associated with considerable computing power. A further disadvantage is that, in particular if the coronary vessels of the patient are to be investigated, generation of the projection images has to be ECG-controlled, so that the coronary arteries are recorded in all the images in the same phase of the heart beat cycle. Because of the need for ECG control, only a comparatively small number of images is then available for each phase of the heart beat cycle, which means that the volume images reconstructed therefrom reproduce the vessel structures only relatively inaccurately. A quantitative analysis according to the above-described reconstruction method does not then provide any usable results.<br>
Taking this as basis, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of segmenting a reconstruction volume which is in a position, starting from a comparatively small number of two-dimensional projection images, to determine the three-dimensional structure of the object reliably, precisely and using as little computing power as possible.<br>
In the case of a method of the above-mentioned type, this object is achieved according to the invention in that, in method step a), a plurality of two-dimensional projection images is recorded ftom different projection directions, the propagation criterion being calculated in method step c) by subjecting the local image areas of the two-dimensional projection images in each case individually to mathematical analysis.<br>
The basic concept of the invention is to perform the computer-aided segmentation of the reconstruction volume directly by means of a propagation method known per se, without any intermediate reconstruction of a three-dimensional volume image data set from the projection images, In the process, propagation in the reconstruction volume along the contours of the object to be reconstructed is controlled by combining the information obtained by means of the mathematical analysis applied to the individual two-dimensional projection images to yield a uniform propagation criterion.<br>
To this end, it is possible, for example, to identify a point in method step c) as belonging to the object, provided that the mathematical analysis yields a result which agrees for a plurality of two-dimensional projection images. This procedure takes account of the fact that, on the basis of projection, the mathematical analysis of an individual, two-dimensional projection image may cause the point concerned to appear to belong to the object even when<br><br>
this is not actually the case. Only a comparison with the results obtained by mathematical analysis of the other projection images in relation to this point allows reliable segmentation.<br>
The local image areas are appropriately determined in method step c) by projecting the point concerned within the reconstruction volume in accordance with the respective projection directions into the image planes of the two-dimensional projection images. In this way, the geometric conditions when the projection images are recorded are replicated, in order to be able to achieve assignment of the points of the reconstruction volume and the image points of the two-dimensional projection images.<br>
By the mathematical analysis in method step c), a propagation coefficient ought appropriately to be calculated in each case as propagation criterion for each two-dimensional projection image, the value of which coefficient indicates whether the point concerned belongs to the object or not. Such a coefficient is particularly well suited to performance of the method according to the invention by means of a computer, since location of points belonging to the object to be reconstructed may be effected by simple numerical comparison. For example, the procedure may be performed in such a way that, in method step c), a point is identified as belonging to the object, provided that the propagation coefficient assumes a large value for a plurality of two-dimensional projection images.<br>
A characteristic of blood vessels is their axial symmetry. They extend a long way in one direction and only a short way in the direction perpendicular thereto. This morphological characteristic may be used according to the invention to calculate the propagation coefficient. For three-dimensional reconstruction of vessel structures, it is accordingly sensible, during calculation of the propagation coefficient, to calculate the inherent values of the Hesse matrix of the gray scale values in the local image area of the respective two-dimensional projection image. By evaluating these inherent values, propagation then follows the image structures with - from a spatial point of view - the lowest possible gray scale curvature values, because the Hesse matrix provides information about the local second derivatives of the gray scale values. Suitable formulae for calculating the propagation coefficient on the basis of the inherent values of the Hesse matrix may be found, for example, in the above-cited article by Young et al. The propagation coefficient may be calculated from the two-dimensional projection images for example as follows:<br><br><br>
In this equation, a and c are weighting factors and X\ (x ) and Aa (x ) are the inherent values of the local gray scale value Hesse matrix calculated at the point x within the respective two-dimensional projection image. More details about this may be found in the above-cited publication by Young et al.<br>
When calculating the propagation coefficient for the respective two-dimensional projection image, adaptation to a cylinder model within the local image area may also be calculated. Such a cylinder model, which is also described in detail in the stated article by Young et al, likewise makes vessel structures distinguishable from other anatomical structures.<br>
Reconstruction is appropriately stopped when a predeterminable end point is reached during propagation in method step d). Such an end point may either be predetermined interactively or determined automatically, for example on the basis of the size of the reconstruction volume.<br>
An imaging apparatus, in particular a C-arm X-ray apparatus, for performing the method according to the invention constitutes the subject matter of claim 9, according to which a computer means of the imaging apparatus is provided with a program such that the two-dimensional projection images are recorded according to the above-described method. For angiographic investigations of the coronary arteries, the imaging apparatus appropriately comprises ECG control as claimed in claim 10, so as to be able to record the projection images synchronously with the heart beat.<br>
A computer program as claimed in claim 11 is suitable for performing the method according to the invention, for example on an imaging apparatus equipped with a suitable computer means. The software required therefore may be made available to the users of corresponding imaging apparatus advantageously on a suitable data medium, such as a floppy disk or a CD-ROM, or by downloading from a data network (Internet).<br>
The invention will be further described with reference to examples of embodiments shown in the drawings to which, however, the invention is not restricted. In the Figures:<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of the method according to the invention for reconstructing a three-dimensional anatomical object;<br>
Fig. 2 shows an imaging apparatus according to the invention.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagnostic image data set consisting of two two-dimensional projection images 1, 2, which image data set was acquired by means of X-ray fluoroscopy. Each of the projection images 1, 2, recorded at different projection angles, shows a branched blood vessel 3 of a patient. The projection images 1, 2 accordingly show the same blood vessel 3 from different perspectives. To acquire the image data set, a contrast agent was administered to the patient, such that the blood vessel 3 shows up dark in the projection images. To reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the blood vessel 3 according to the invention, a seed point 5 is firstly set within a reconstruction volume 4. The contour of the blood vessel 3 is then reconstructed in the volume 4, by locating adjacent points in the volume 4 in each case belonging to the blood vessel 3 in accordance with a propagation criterion. To this end, local image areas 6 and 7 belonging to the respective point 5 within the two-dimensional projection images 1 and 2 respectively are in each case subjected individually to mathematical analysis. After location of a point adjacent to the seed point 5, the procedure is repeated for points in turn adjacent to this point, until the entire structure of the blood vessel 3 has been reconstructed within the volume 4. The point investigated in each case with each propagation step' is fderitified~asT5el6hgihg to the blood vessel if the mathematical analysis of the local image areas 6 and 7 gives a positive result for both projection images 1 and 2 respectively. The local image areas 6 and 7 are determined by projecting the point 5, in accordance with the projection directions in which the two images 1 and 2 were recorded, into the image planes of these two images. This is indicated in Fig. 1 by arrows 8 and 9.<br>
The imaging apparatus illustrated in Fig. 2 is a C-arm X-ray apparatus, which comprises a C-arm 10, which is suspended by means of a holder 11 from a ceiling (not described in any more detail). An X-ray source 12 and an X-ray image converter 13 are guided movably on the C-arm 10, such that a plurality of two-dimensional projection X-ray images of a patient 15 lying on a table 14 in the center of the C-arm 10 may be recorded at different projection angles. Synchronous movement of the X-ray source 12 and the X-ray image converter 13 is controlled by a control unit 16. During image recording, the X-ray source 12 and the X-ray image converter 13 travel synchronously around the patient 15. The image signals generated by the X-ray image converter 13 are transmitted to a controlled image processing unit 17. The heart beat of the patient 15 is monitored using an ECG apparatus 18. The ECG apparatus 18 transmits control signals to the image processing unit 17, such that the latter is in a position to store a plurality of two-dimensional projection<br><br>
images in each case in the same phase of the heart beat cycle, in order in this manner to perform an angiographic investigation of the coronary arteries. The image processing unit 17 comprises a program control, by means of which three-dimensional reconstruction of a blood vessel detected with the image data set thus acquired is performed, according to the above-described method. The reconstructed blood vessel may then be visualized in known manner on a monitor 19 connected to the image processing unit 17.<br><br><br><br>
