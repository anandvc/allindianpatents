				<td>N.N'.N"'-TRIS{2.4-BIS[(1-HYDROCARBYLOXY-2.2.6.6-TETRA-METHYLPIPERIDIN-4-YL)ALKYLAMINO]-S-TRIAZIN-6-YL}-3.3'-ETHYLENEDIIMINODIPROPYLAMINES. THEIR ISOMERS AND BRIDGED DERIVATIVES AND POLYMER COMPOSITIONS STABILIZED THEREWITH<br>
The general invention pertains to selected N,N',N"'-tris{2,4-bis[(1-hydrocarbyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)alkylarnino]-s-triazin-6-yl}-3,3'-ethylenediiminodipropyl-amines, their pure isomers, and bridged derivatives and to polymer compositions stabilized therewith.<br>
The instant compounds, because of their low basicity, are of particular value in the stabilization of polymer compositions where the activity of more basic hindered amine stabilizers is significantly reduced because of interaction with the polymer substrate. Examples of polyolefin compositions in which the instant compounds are particularly effective include flame-retardant polyolefins where acidic residues from the decomposition of halogenated flame retardants deactivate normal hindered amine stabilizers, greenhouse films and agricultural mulch films where acidic residues from pesticides interfere with the activity of normal hindered amine stabilizers, and thermoplastic polyolefins where interactions with basic hindered amine stabilizers interfere with painting the substrate.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
N,N',N",N"'-Tetrakis substituted hindered amines, which are described by formula I where RrR4 are all E, have been patented as less basic, non-interacting polymer stabilizers in various ambient and thermoset automotive coatings, polyolefin, and non-polyolefin applications as taught in United States Patent Nos. 5,004,770; 5,096,950; 5,204,473; 5,112,890 and 5,124,378; and in European Patent Application 309402 A1. Specifically, the preparation of N,NI,N",N'"-tetrakis{2,4-bis[(1 -cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-ylJbutylaminoH-triazin-e-yl}-3,3-ethylenediiminodipropylamine and its octyloxy analogue is described by Winter et al., respectively, in Examples 62 and 67 of U.S. Patent No. 5,204,473. The same patent also claims the 1-methoxy analogue in claim 25. None of the above patents contain any specific performance data on these tetra-substituted-s-triazine<br>
indered amine stabilizers in any organic substrate.<br>
The instant invention differs from the prior art in that the instant compounds have one unsubstituted nitrogen on the tetraamine backbone. Furthermore, none of the prior art, including U.S. Patent 5,015,682, which describes oligomeric N-hydrocarbyloxy hindered amine stabilizers, discloses the bridged structures described by formulae II and III.<br>
Detailed Disclosure<br>
The instant invention pertains to a mixture of N,N',N'"-tris{2,4-bis[(1-hydrocarbyl-oxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin^-yl)alkylaminol-s-triazin-e-yl}-3,3'-ethylenediiminodipropyl-amine; N,N',N"-tris{2,4-bis[(1-hydrocarbyloxy-2)2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)alkylamino]-s-triazin-6-yl}-3,3'-ethylenediiminodipropylamine, and bridged derivatives as described by formulas I, II, IIA and III<br>
R1NH-CH2CH2CH2NR2CH2CH2NR3CH2CH2CH2NHR4	<br>
T-ErT,(II) T-E (MA) G-ErGrErGg     (III) <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Eis<br><br>
where in the tetraamine of formula I,<br>
R, and R2 are the s-triazine moiety E; and one of R3 and R4 is the s-triazine moiety E with the other of R3 and R4 being hydrogen,<br>
R is methyl, cyclohexyl or octyl, preferably cyclohexyl or octyl, R5 is alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably n-butyl; where in the compound of formula II or IIA when R is cyclohexyl or octyl,<br>
T and "H are each a tetraamine substituted by Ri-R4 as defined for formula I, where<br>
(1)	one of the s-triazine moieties E in each tetraamine is replaced by the group E!<br>
which forms a bridge between the two tetraamines T and T1, or<br>
(2)	the group E1 can have both termini in the same tetraamine T as in formula IIA<br>
where two of the E moieties of the tetraamine are replaced by one E1 group, or<br>
(3)	all three s-triazine substituents of tetraamine T can be E1 such that one E1 links<br>
T and TI and a second EI has both termini in tetraamine T,<br>
L is cyclohexanediyl or octanediyl;<br>
where in the compound of formula III<br>
G, G! and G2are each tetraamines substituted by RrR4as defined for formula I, except that G and G2 each have one of the s-triazine moieties E replaced by EL and G, has two of the triazine moieties E replaced by E^ so that there is a bridge between G and G! and a second bridge between G! and G2.<br>
The compounds of formula I have two possible isomers assuming that there is no bridging between molecules. These two isomers are outlined in the table below.<br><br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
The compound mixture of the invention is expediently prepared by reacting two to four equivalents of 2,4-bis[(1-hydrocarbyloxy-2,2,6,6-piperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with one equivalent of N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine, especially by reacting 2-4 equivalents of a 2,4-bis[(1 -hydrocarbyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-4-yl)alkylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with 1 equivalent of N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)-ethylenediamine in a hydrocarbon solvent with an acid acceptor, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, used to neutralize the hydrochloric acid produced in the reaction. The synthesis of various educts of the type 2,4-bis[(1-hydrocarbyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)alkyl-amino]-6-chloro-s-triazine is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,216,156 and 5,204,473.<br>
In a preferred process, 2.5 to three equivalents of the s-triazine, especially three equivalents of the s-triazine, are reacted with one equivalent of the amine.<br>
The preferred method for synthesis of the 2,4-bis[(1-hydrocarbyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetra-methylpiperidin-4-yl)alkylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazines is to heat a mixture of the corresponding hindered amine substituted 6-chloro-s-triazine with tert-butyl hydroperoxide, a metal oxide catalyst, and the appropriate hydrocarbon solvent until the red color of the nitroxyl intermediate is discharged as taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,921,962. In some instances, two<br>
itroxyl radicals will couple with the same solvent molecule. This is the source of the bridged material depicted by formulae II and III as described above. The N-methoxy compounds of the instant invention do not contain these bridged structures because different synthetic methodology is used to generate 1 -methoxy substituted hindered amines.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,204,473 describes the introduction of a 1 -cyclohexyloxy or 1-octyloxy substituent on a tetra-substituted s-triazine hindered amine starting material. The instant tris-substituted compounds differ from the tetra-substituted compounds of prior art because they are prepared by a different route as shown below. Even with the use of 4 equivalents of the chloro-s-triazine intermediate, the majority of the product mixture is tris-substituted. The use of as little as 2 equivalents of the chloro-s-triazine intermediate still gives some tris-substituted product.<br>
The term hydrocarbyloxy here stands mainly for methoxy, cyclohexyloxy or octyloxy. In the compounds of formulae l-lll and thus the products of the present process, R is usually cyclohexyl or octyl, and in compounds of formula I additionally embraces methyl.<br>
Preferred is a mixture of compounds l-lll, wherein R is cyclohexyl or octyl, especially a mixture of NIN',N"'-tris{2,4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2I6l6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)n-butylamino]-s-triazin-6-yl}-3,3'-ethylenediiminodipropylamine; N,N',N"-tris{2l4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)n-butylaminoJ-s-triazin-6-yl}-3,3-ethylene-diiminodipropylamine and bridged derivatives as described by formulas I, II, IIA and III.<br>
Also of interest is a mixture of NlN',N'"-tris{2I4-bis[(1-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-4-yl)n-butylamino]-s-triazin-6-yl}-3I3'-ethylenediiminodipropylamine; N,N',N"-tris-{2,4-bis[(1-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)n-butylamino]-s-triazin-6-yl}-3,3'-ethy-lene-diiminodipropylamine and bridged derivatives as described by formulas I, II, IIA and III. Of technical interest is also a mixture of N,N',N'"-tris{2I4-bis[(1-methoxy-2,2,6I6-tetramethyl-piperidin-4-yl)n-butylamino]-s-triazin-6-yl}-3,3'-ethylenediiminodipropylamine; N,N',N"-tris-{2,4-bis[(1-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)n-butylamino]-s-triazin-6-yl}-3,3'-ethy-lenediiminodipropylamine and bridged derivatives as described by formulas I, II, IIA and III.<br>
R5 as alkyl embraces methyl, ethyl, propyl such as n- or isopropyl, butyl such as n-, iso-, sec- and tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl; preferred<br>
is butyl, especially n-butyl.Compounds of the formulae l-lll are especially well suitable as stabilizers for organic material against thermal, oxidative or light-induced degradation; they are also active as flame retardants. Thus, the instant invention also pertains to a composition stabilized against thermal, oxidative or light-induced degradation which comprises,<br>
(a)	an organic material subject to thermal, oxidative or light-induced degradation,<br>
and<br>
(b)	an effective stabilizing amount of a compound of formula I, II, IIA or III.<br>
Preferably, the organic material is a natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic polymer, especially a thermoplastic polymer.<br>
Most preferably, the polymer is a polyolefin, a thermoplastic olefin or polycarbonate. Of utmost importance is a polyolefin, especially polyethylene or polypropylene.<br>
The compounds of this invention exhibit superior hydrolytic stability, handling and storage stability as well as good resistance to extractability when present in a stabilized composition.<br>
The methodology to make the instant compounds is described in the prior art. The intermediates needed to make the instant compounds are largely items of commerce.<br>
In general polymers which can be stabilized include<br>
1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, polybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), branched low density polyethylene (BLDPE). Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph,<br>
preferably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated<br>
temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than<br>
one metal of groups IVb, Vb, Vlb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals<br>
usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcohdates,<br>
esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls, cycloalkenyl, cyclopentadienyl, and/or<br>
aryls that may be either π- or σ-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in<br>
the free form or supported on substrates, typically on activated magnesium<br>
chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be<br>
soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by<br>
themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically<br>
metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal<br>
alkyloxanes, or compounds that afford non-coordinating anions such as<br>
tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron, said metals being elements of groups la, I la and/or<br>
Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with<br>
further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are<br>
usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont),<br>
constrained geometry catalyst technology CGCT (Dow), metallocene or single<br>
site catalysts (SSC).<br><br>

The instant invention also pertains to a process of making the instant mixture of N,N')N'"-tris{2,4-bis[(1-hydrocarbyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)alkylamino]-s-triazin-6-yl}-3,3'-ethylenediiminodipropylamine; N,N',N"-tris{2,4-bis[(1-hydrocarbyloxy-2,2,6I6-tetra-methylpiperidin-4-yl)aIkylamino]-s-triazin-6-yl}-3,3'-ethylenediiminodipropylamineand bridged derivatives as described by formulas I, II, MA and III defined supra which comprises<br>
reacting two to four equivalents of 2,4-bis[(1-hydrocarbyloxy-2,2,6,6-piperidin-4-yl)-butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with one equivalent of N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylene-diamine.<br>
Preferably, the process involves reacting 2.5 to 3 equivalents of the s-triazine with one equivalent of amine; most preferably three equivalents of the s-triazine to one equivalent of amine.<br>
There are advantages of the instant tris-substituted compounds over the related tetra-substituted compounds of the prior art. The tert-butyl hydroperoxide oxidation-coupling reaction used to introduce the 1-cyclohexyloxy or 1-octyloxy group on the tetra-substituted s-triazine hindered amine causes significant chain scission of the tetraamine moiety resulting in by-products of lower molecular weight. This chain scission is eliminated in the preparation of the instant compounds because the 1-alkoxy group is introduced in the absence of the tetraamine backbone.<br>
The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed to limit the scope of the instant invention in any manner whatsoever.<br>

Example 1: 2-Chloro-4,6-bis[N-(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl-amino]-s-triazine<br>
A mixture of 57.7 g (0.448 mol) of 70 % aqueous tert-butylhydroperoxide, 250 ml of cyclohexane and 100 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution is agitated vigorously and the organic layer is then separated and dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration. The filtrate, 30.0 g (0.056 mol) of 2-chloro-4,6-bis[N-(2,2,6)6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-s-triazine and 1.0 g of molybdenum trioxide are placed in a pressure bottle and heated at 130-140°C. The reaction mixture quickly turns red and heating is continued till the red color is discharged. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool and solids are removed by filtration. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to give an oil which is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to afford 30.3 g. (74 % yield) of the title compound as a white glass.<br>
Although the white glass is essentially the title compound, some minor amount of bridged material may also be present.<br>
Example 2:2-Chloro-4.6-bisfN-(1 -octyoxy-2,2.6.6-tetramethvlpiperidin-4-yl)butvlamino1-s-triazine<br>
A mixture of 57.7 g (0.448 mol) of 70 % aqueous tert-butylhydroperoxide, 340 ml of octane, and 50 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution is agitated vigorously, and the organic layer is then separated and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration. One-half of the tert-butyl hydroperoxide/octane solution is combined with 30.0 g (0.056 mol) of 2-chloro-4,6-bis[N-(2,2,6I6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-s-triazine and 1.0 g of molybdenum trioxide and the mixture is heated at reflux. Water is collected in a Dean-Stark trap. Once the mixture turns red, the remaining tert-butyl hydroperoxide/octane solution is added over a three-hour period while the reaction mixture is maintained at reflux. The mixture is heated for an additional hour to discharge the red color. The reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature and solids are removed by filtration. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain an amber oil which is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (40:1, heptane/ethyl acetate) to afford<br>
32.7 g (74 % yield) of the title compound as a colorless syrup.<br>
Although the colorless syrup is essentially the title compound, a minor amount of bridged material may also be present.<br>
Example 3 : Reaction of 2,4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-piperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine<br>
A mixture of 6.4 g (37 mmol) of N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine, 107.6 g (147 mmol, 4.0 equivalents) of 2,4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)-butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine, as prepared in Example 1, as a 70 % solution in cyclohexane, and 31.0 g of 20 % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is heated at 160 C for four hours. The reaction is cooled and diluted with 60 g of cyclohexane. The aqueous layer is removed, the organic layer is concentrated and water is added to precipitate the crude product. The solids are washed with water till neutral and dried to afford 102 g of product.<br>
Analysis: Although four equivalents of the 6-chloro-s-triazine are used per one equivalent of tetraamine, nmr analysis shows that on average only three triazinyl groups are attached to the amine backbone.<br>
The product is a mixture of isomers including bridged compounds. The mixture can be separated by preparative chromatography into the pure components, particularly the two non-bridged formula isomers discussed earlier.<br>
Example 4:   Reaction of 2,4-bis[(1 -cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-piperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine<br>
The procedure of Example 3 is repeated, except that 3.0 equivalents of 2,4-bis[(1 -cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine are used and the reaction is carried out at 120 C over nine hours.<br>
Again, this product is a mixture of isomers including bridged compounds. Analysis<br>
by nmr shows that on average between 2.5 and three triazinyl groups are attached to the amine backbone. The Tg for this product is 104-118°C as measured by DSC.<br>
Example 4a Comparative Example<br>
The compound of Example 62 of U.S. 5,204,473 is prepared by reacting the hindered amine precursor (CHIMASSORB® 905, Ciba), having four substituted s-triazinyl groups attached to the 3,3'ethylenediiminodipropylamine backbone, with molybdenum trioxide and cyclohexane to form the corresponding 1-cyclohexyloxy compound. This compound is supposedly tetrasubstituted as based on the original CHIMASSORB® 905 starting material. However, nmr and GPC analyses indicate that under the reaction conditions considerable scission of s-triazinyl groups and the formation of unknown colored by-products may have occurred and that only two s-triazinyl groups may still be bonded to the amine backbone.<br>
In order to distinguish the instant "trisubstituted" compound of Example 4 from this prior art compound of Example 62 of U.S. 5,204,473, here designated as Example 4a, the Tg of each compound is determined by DSC, and each compound is subjected to DSC and TGA analyses.<br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
*DSC scans (10°C/min to 350°C, 100 ml/min N2, Al pans, -10 mg) DSC - Estimate of error, Enthalpy to ±10 %; Temp, to ±2°C.<br>
**TGA scans (10°C/min to 500°C, 100 ml/min N2, Al pans, -10 mg) TGA - Estimate of error, Temp, to ±5°C; Weight to ±0.5 % absolute.<br>
It is clear from these data that the instant compound of Example 4 made by a different procedure from the prior art compound of Example 62 of U.S. 5,204,473 is not the same material at all and that the instant compound of Example 4 is far more thermally stable than is the prior art compound of Example 62.<br>
Example 5:   Reaction of 2,4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-piperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine<br>
The procedure of Example 4 is repeated, except that 2.5 equivalents of 2,4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazineare used.<br>
This product is also a mixture of isomers including bridged compounds. Analysis by nmr shows that on average between 2.5 and three triazinyl groups are attached to the amine backbone.<br>
The Tg for this product is 109-116°C as measured by DSC.<br>
Example 6: Reaction of 2,4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2l2,6&gt;6-piperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine<br>
The procedure of Example 4 is repeated, except that 2.0 equivalents of 2,4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine are used and the reaction is carried out at 120°C over five hours.<br>
This product is a mixture of isomers including bridged compounds. Analysis by nmr shows that on average two triazinyl groups are attached to the amine backbone as expected.<br>
The Tg for this product is 101-114 C as measured by DSC.<br>
Example 7: Purification of the Reaction product of 2,4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-piperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazinewith N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine<br>
A portion of the product mixture obtained in Example 4 is dissolved in toluene and passed through a column of Phenomenex    (10 microns) with toluene as the eluent. Fractions are collected and analyzed by gel permeation chromatography. Material having a molecular weight distribution consistent with tris-substituted product is isolated by evaporating the solvent.<br>
Example 8: Reaction of Pure 2,4-bis[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-piperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with NJN'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine<br>
Tributyltin hydride is added to a solution of excess 1 -oxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-4-one and cyclohexyl iodide in chiorobenzene. The mixture is passed through silica gel with heptane/ethyl acetate to obtain l-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin^-one, which is free of any bis(4-oxo-2,2I6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yloxy)cyclohexane bridged material.<br>
Step2<br>
A mixture of the compound prepared in step 1 above, n-butylamine, methanol and 5 % platinum-on-carbon catalyst is hydrogenated (50 psi, 25 C). The catalyst is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is evaporated to afford 4-butylamino-1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetra-methylpiperidine.<br>
Step3<br>
Two equivalents of the compound prepared in step 2 are added to a mixture of cyanuric chloride and xylene at 40 C. Sodium hydroxide is added, and the mixture is heated to 65°C till the reaction is complete. The reaction mixture is cooled, and water is added. The organic layer is washed with dilute acid, water, dried, and evaporated to afford 2,4-bis-[(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine.<br>
By its method of preparation, this intermediate is clearly not a mixture of compounds such as may be the case with the intermediate made in Example 1.<br>
Step 4<br>
A mixture of N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine and 3.0 equivalents of the compound prepared in step 3 is reacted according to the procedure in Example 4.<br>
Example 9: Reaction of 2,4-bis[(1 -octyloxy-2,2,6,6-piperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine<br>
A mixture of N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine, 3 equivalents of 2,4-bis[(1-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butylaminol-e-chloro-s-triazine prepared in Example 2 as a solution in octane, and 20 % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is heated at 120°C until the reaction is complete. The reaction mixture is cooled, the organic layer is washed with water till neutral, and solvent is evaporated to afford the product mixture.<br>
The nmr analysis is consistent with the expected product of this reaction.<br>
Example 10:     Reaction of 2,4-bis[(1 -methoxy-2,2,6,6-piperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-s-triazine with N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine<br>
A mixture of N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine, 3 equivalents of 2,4-bis[(1-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butylamino]-6-chloro-1,3,5-triazine a solution in cyclohexane, and 20 % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is heated at 120°C until the reaction is complete. The reaction mixture is cooled, the organic layer is washed with water till neutral, and solvent is evaporated to afford the product mixture.<br>
Example 11: Fiber grade polypropylene, containing 0.05 % by weight of calcium stearate and 0.05 % by weight of the hydroxylamine made by the direct oxidation of N,N-di(hydrogenated tallow)amine is dry blended with the test additives and then melt compounded at 234°C (450°F) into pellets. The pelletized fully formulated resin is then spun at 246°C (475°F) into fiber using a Hills laboratory model fiber extruder. The spun tow of 41 filaments is stretched at a ratio of 1:3.2 to give a final denier of 615/41.<br>
Socks are knitted from the stabilized polypropylene fiber on a Lawson-Hemphill Analysis Knitter and exposed in an Atlas Xenon-Arc WeatherOmeter using SAE J 1885 Interior Automotiveconditons at 89°C bpt, 0.55 kW/cm2 at 340 nm with no spray cycle. Failure in this test is determined by the observation of the physical failure of the sock when it is "scratched" with a blunt glass rod. The longer it takes for this catastrophic failure to occur, the more effective is the stabilizer system.<br>
The control socks containing none of the instant compound fail after 200 hours exposure while the sock containing 0.25 % by weight of the instant compound mixture of Example 4 or containing 0.25 % by weight of the compound of Example 3 fail after 700 hours of exposure. The sock containing 0.5 % by weight of the instant compound of Example 4 fail after 1000 hours; while socks with 0.75 % by weight of the compound of Example 4 have not failed after 1000 hours exposure.<br>
Example 12: Other socks of propylene fiber as prepared in Example 11 are exposed in a Blue M forced draft oven at 120°C. Failure is determined by the criterion set forth in Example 11. The longer it takes for the catastrophic failure to occur, the more effective is the stabilizing system.<br>
The socks containing the instant compounds exhibit good thermal stabilization efficacy.<br>
Example 13: Film grade polyethylene is dry blended with approximately 10 % by weight of the test additives and then melt compounded at 200°C into "Masterbatch" pellets. The "Masterbatch" is dry blended with polyethylene resin to get the desired final stabilizer concentration. This stabilized fully formulated resin is then blown at 200°C into a 150 micron thick film on a DOLCI film line.<br>
The blown films are exposed in an Atlas Xenon-Arc WeatherOmeter according to ASTM G26 at 63°C bpt, 0.35 W/m2 at 340 nm with no spray cycle. Films are tested periodically for any change in elongation using an Instron 112 tensile tester. Failure in this test is determined by observation of the loss of % elongation in the film. The longer it takes for this loss to occur, the more effective is the stabilizer system.<br>
The films containing the instant compound mixture show good light stabilizing efficacy.<br>
Example 14: Molded test specimens are prepared by injection molding thermoplastic olefin (TPO) pellets containing a pigment, a phosphite, a phenolic antioxidant or hydroxylamine, a metal stearate, a UV absorber or a hindered amine stabilizer or the hindered amine compounds of formulas I, II, HA and III; or a mixture of hindered amine and UV absorber.<br>
Pigmented TPO pellets are prepared from pure pigment or pigment concentrate, stabilizers, coadditives and commercially available thermoplastic olefin by mixing the components in a Superior/MPM 1" single screw extruder with a general all-purpose screw (24:1 L/D) at 400°F (200°C), cooled in a water bath and pelletized. The resulting formulated pellets are molded into 60 mil (0.006 inch) thick 2" x 2" plaques at about 375°F (190°C) on a BOY 30M Injection Molding Machine.<br>
Pigmented TPO formulation composed of polypropylene blended with a rubber modifier where the rubber modifier is an in-situ reacted copolymer or blended product containing copolymers of propylene and ethylene with or without a ternary component such as ethylidene norbornene are stabilized with a base stabilization system consisting of an N,N-dialkylhydroxylamine or a mixture of hindered phenolic antioxidant and an organophosphorus compound.<br>
All additive and pigment concentration in the final formulations are expressed as weight percent based on the resin.<br>
The test formulations contain thermoplastic olefin pellets and one or more of the following components:<br>
0.0 - 2.0 % pigment<br>
0.0 - 50.0 % talc<br>
0.0 - 0.5 % phosphite<br>
0.0 -1.25 % phenolic antioxidant<br>
0.0 - 0.1 % hydroxylamine<br>
0.0 - 0.5 % calcium stearate<br>
0.0-1.25 %UV absorber<br>
0.0 -1.25 % hindered amine stabilizer<br>
The components are dry blended in a tumble dryer prior to extrusion and molding.<br>
Test plaques are mounted in metal frames and exposed in an Atlas Ci65 Xenon Arc WeatherOmeter at 70°C black panel temperature, 0.55 W/m2at 340 nm and 50 % relative humidity with intermittent light/dark cycles and water spray according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE J 1960) test procedure. Specimens are tested at approximately 625 kilojoule intervals by performing color measurments on an Applied Color Systems spectrophotometer by reflectance mode according to ASTM D 2244-79. Data collected include delta E, L*, a* and b* values. Gloss measurments are conducted on a BYK-GARDNER Haze/Gloss Meter at 60° according to ASTM D523.<br>
UV Exposure Testing - Test specimens exposed to UV radiation exhibit exceptional resistance to photodegradation when stabilized with light stabilizer systems comprised of a combination of a benzotriazole UV absorber and the hindered amine compounds of formula I, II, IIA and III.<br>
The stabilized samples specifically show improved gloss retention compared to the prior art stabilizer systems. Resistance to color change upon UV exposure is also enhanced. Polymer<br>
blends containing an unsaturated ternary component, such as EPDM blends, especially show enhanced properties when stabilized by the instant systems.<br>
In all cases, the light stabilized formulations show much greater resistance to photodegradation than unstabilized specimens which fail quickly under UV exposure conditions as outlined above.<br>

The final formulation contains 0.25 % of Pigment Red 177, 0.05 % of neopentanetetrayl tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), 0.05 % of tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite and 0.2 % of 2-(2-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-amylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole. Samples are 60 mil thick 2" x 2" injection molded plaques. The UV exposures are conducted under exterior automotive conditions according to SAE J 1960 specifications.<br>
Example 15a: Film grade polyethylene is dry blended with 10 % loading of the test additives and then melt compounded at 200°C into master batch pellets. The master batch pellets are dry blended with the polyethylene resin to get the final stabilizer concentration. The fully formulated resin is then blown at 200°C into a 150 micron thick film using a DOLCI film line.<br>
The resulting films are exposed on a greenhouse on galvanized iron backing. Treatment includes applications of pesticides on a regular basis (i.e. sodium N-methyldithiocarbamate, VAPAM® every six months and SESMETRIN® every month). Performance is measured by monitoring the percent residual elongation. Failure is defined as the time to a 50 % loss of original elongation.<br>
The control film containing 0.4 % by weight of the polycondensation product of 4,4'-hexamethylene-bis(amino-2,2I6I6-tetramethylpiperidine) and 2,4-dichloro-6-tert-octylamino-s-triazine fails after 160 KLYS greenhouse exposure. The film containing 0.4 % by weight of the instant compound of Example 3 fails only after 300 KLYS exposure. These results show the resistance to pesticides of the instant compounds of formula I, II, HA and III.<br>
Example 15b: Master batch pellets prepared as described in Example 15a are dry blended into polyethylene resin to get the final stabilizer concentration. The fully formulated resin is then blown at 200°C into a 25 micron thick film using a DOLCI film line.<br>
The resulting films are exposed on a soil to simulate agricultural mulch film conditions. Treatment includes exposure to methyl bromide fumigant for three days at 60 g/m3. Performance is measured by monitoring the time to physical embrittlement.<br>

The film containing 1.2 % by weight of instant compound of Example 3 is still intact after 110 KLYS exposure. These results show the resistance of the instant compounds of formula I, II, MA and III to fumigants.<br>
Example 16: Greenhouse film samples are prepared as described in Example 15, but in addition to the instant compounds of formula I, II, MA and III also contain a metal stearate or a metal oxide. Typical formulations contain from 0.05 to 2 % by weight of the instant hindered amines, 0.05 to 0.5 % of a metal stearate such as calcium oxide, and 0.05 to 0.5 % of a metal oxide such as zinc oxide or magnesium oxide.<br>

Test plaques are mounted in metal frames and exposed in an Atlas Ci65 Xenon Arc WeatherOmeter with inermittent light/dark cycles and water spray following the ASTM G26 test procedure. Specimens are tested at periodic intervals for changes in tensile properties. Failure in this test is determined by the observation of the loss of tensile properties. The longer it takes for the loss in properties to occur, the more effective is the stabilizer system.<br>

When tested for light stabilizing activity as described in Example 13, the films containing the instant hindered amines exhibit good stabilization.<br>
Example 21: Molded test specimens are prepared by injection molding thermoplastic olefin (TPO) pellets containing the instant hindered amine compounds of formulas I, II, IIA and III, pigments and other coadditives as described in Example 14.<br>
The test specimens are painted with one-pack paint systems and tested for TPO/paint interactions. Before painting, the test specimens are first wiped with isopropanol and air blasted to remove any dust. After a five minute flash, these specimens are coated with the adhesion promoter, then the base coat, and then optionally a clear coat. Typical film thickness of these various coatings are 0.1-0.3 mils for the adhesion promoter, 0.6-0.8 mils for the base coat, and 1.2-1.5 mils for the clear coat. After painting, the specimens are cured in an oven at 120°C for 30 minutes.<br>
Samples are tested to evaluate the TPO/paint interactions as follows: In the initial adhesion test, a clear cellophane adhesive tape is used to pull on a 3 mm cross hatched paint surface or; in the humidity test, the painted plaques are exposed for 240 hours at 38°C in an atmosphere having 98 % relative humidity. The blister rating is tested by visual observation according to ASTM D 714.<br>
The samples containing the instant hindered amine compounds exhibit good TPO/paint interaction properties as determined by the criteria above.<br>
Example 22: Polyolefin resins including polypropylene, polyethylene homopolymer, polyolefin copolymer, or thermoplastic olefin (TPO) are dry blended with the instant hindered amine compounds of formulas I, II, HA and III and then melt compounded into pellets. The pelletized fully formulated resin is then processed into a useful article such as extrusion into fiber; blown or cast extrusion into film; blow molded into bottles; injection molded into molded articles; thermoformed into molded articles; extruded into wire and cable housing; or rotational molded into hollow articles.<br>
The materials containing the instant hindered amine compounds exhibit stability against the deleterious effects of UV light and thermal exposure.<br>
