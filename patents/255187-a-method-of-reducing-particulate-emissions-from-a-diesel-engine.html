REDUCED-EMISSIONS COMBUSTION UTILIZING MULTIPLE-<br>
COMPONENT METALLIC COMBUSTION CATALYST AND<br>
LIGHTLY CATALYZED DIESEL OXIDATION CATALYST<br>
Description<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0001] The invention concerns a new process for to reduce emission of pollutants of the<br>
type generated by incomplete combustion, e.g., particulates, unburned hydrocarbons and<br>
carbon monoxide, while avoiding increasing the production of NO2.<br>
[0002] Diesel engines have a number of important advantages over engines of the Otto<br>
type. Among them are fuel economy, ease of repair and long life. From the standpoint of<br>
emissions, however, they present problems more severe than their spark-ignition<br>
counterparts. Emission problems relate to particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOX),<br>
unbumed hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO). NOX is a term used to describe<br>
various chemical species of nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen monoxide (NO) and<br>
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), among others. NO is of concern because it is believed to undergo a<br>
process known as photo-chemical smog formation, through a series of reactions in the<br>
presence of sunlight and hydrocarbons, and is significant contributor to acid rain. NO2 on<br>
the other hand has a high potential as an oxidant and is a strong lung irritant. Particulates<br>
(PM) are also connected to respiratory problems. As engine operation modifications are<br>
made to reduce particulates and unburned hydrocarbons on diesel engines, the NOX<br>
emissions tend to increase.<br>
[0003] After treatment devices, such as diesel particulate filters (DPFs) and diesel<br>
oxidation catalysts (DOCs), have been proposed to reduce the emission of particulates and<br>
gaseous hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide from diesel engines. These devices are greatly<br>
stressed in older engines and are in need of efficiency improvements in newer engines. In<br>
all cases, they are expensive due in significant part to the cost of precious metals used<br>
required to be effective. It would be desirable to reduce the cost of DOC devices and/or<br>
improve their efficiency.<br><br>
WO 2006/078762	PCT/US2006/001813<br>
2<br>
[0004] NO2, being a strong oxidant, has been recognized by the art for playing a useful role<br>
in burning diesel particulates. Cooper, et al., U. S. Patent No. 4,902,487, implements this<br>
reaction through the use of a heavily catalyzed DOC upstream of an uncatalyzed DPF. The<br>
heavily catalyzed DOC converts NO present in the exhaust to NO2, which oxidizes carbon<br>
particulates to help regenerate the filter. As a first element in Example 2 of that patent, a<br>
conventional ceramic monolith supported catalyst was employed containing approximately<br>
80 gm/ft3 Pt. Typical loadings of platinum are reportedly 30 to 90 gm/ft3 of DOC volume.<br>
More recently a manufacturer of such devices has introduced a system which utilizes a<br>
heavily catalyzed DPF to help with low temperature regeneration. Total precious metal<br>
loadings are now reportedly 90 to 120 gm/ft3. A result of this approach is large quantities of<br>
excess NO2 escaping the system. NO2 is a strong lung irritant and concentrations have been<br>
limited in exhaust gas by MSHA and are proposed to be capped at 20% of exhaust nitrogen<br>
oxides by CARB. However, in this type of system, the art finds it necessary to utilize high<br>
platinum loadings to achieve satisfactory regeneration despite the high cost of the platinum<br>
and the associated problems of NO2 emission.<br>
[0005] Another commercial effort has been made to improve regeneration of the soot filter<br>
of the Cooper type, and generate high NO2 emissions and aid DPF regeneration through the<br>
use of cerium or iron fuel additives. See United States Patent No. 6,767,526 to Blanchard,<br>
et al., which employs a DOC with a DPF or a DPF alone with fixed platinum loadings of<br>
unspecified concentrations sufficient to oxidize NO to NO2. It does not address the high<br>
cost of platinum related to the Cooper system or the adverse effect of NO2 emissions.<br>
[0006] Another commercially tested system uses a DOC upstream of a new wire mesh<br>
filter but needs the heavily catalyzed DOC which forms high NO2 in the exhaust to<br>
regenerate the uncatalyzed wire mesh filter. See, for example, EP 1 350 933.<br>
[0007] In United States Patent No. 6,023,928, Peter-Hoblyn and Valentine describe a<br>
platinum FBC with a DOC or DPF and or Pt/Ce with a catalyzed or uncatalyzed DPF but<br>
does not describe minimizing platinum loadings or reduction in NO2. Conventional DOC's<br>
with high platinum loadings can convert sulfur into sulfate species increasing particulates<br>
and also increasing NO2. Catalyzed DOCs have not been considered effective, only able to<br>
provide PM reductions of 20 to 25%.<br><br>
WO 2006/078762	PCT/US2006/001813<br>
3<br>
[0008] What is needed is a system that provides good PM reduction while minimizing the<br>
generation and escape of NO2.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[009] It is an object of the invention to provide a system that provides good PM reduction<br>
through a catalytic exhaust treatment while minimizing the escape of NO2.<br>
[0010] It is another object of the invention to provide a system that can reduce system costs<br>
by lowering the requirements for platinum catalyst while maintaining the apparent benefit<br>
of NO2 as an aid to soot oxidation in a DOC.<br>
[0011] These and other objects are accomplished by the invention, which provides an<br>
improved diesel exhaust treatment system. In a principal aspect, the invention provides a<br>
method for reducing particulate emissions from a diesel engine while also controlling<br>
emissions of NO2 as a percent of exhaust total nitrogen oxides, comprising: adding a fuel<br>
borne catalyst comprising platinum and cerium and/or iron at a total metal concentration of<br>
from 2 to 15 ppm in the fuel to a diesel fuel; and passing exhaust produced by the<br>
combustion through a diesel oxidation catalyst having substrate with a precious metal<br>
catalyst thereon, the catalyst be present on the substrate in an amount of less than 15 grams<br>
per cubic foot of substrate.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0012] As noted, the invention provides improved systems for diesel operation and<br>
preferably employs an FBC and an emissions after treatment device comprising a lightly<br>
catalyzed diesel oxidation catalyst, DOC, e.g., of conventional or alternative construction.<br>
The term FBC refers to fuel borne catalyst, which is typically a fuel soluble or suspended<br>
composition having a metal component that is released to the combustion chamber in active<br>
form during the combustion of the fuel in the diesel engine. The terms DOC and FBC will<br>
all be explained in greater detail below and are also known to the art as evidenced by the<br>
above citations.<br>
[0013] The invention employs an emissions after treatment device treatment comprising a<br>
catalyst substrate that can be a DOC alone or with a DPF, the catalyst substrate being<br>
lightly catalyzed with precious metal, e.g., a platinum group metal. The catalyst loading<br><br>
WO 2006/078762	PCT/US2006/001813<br>
4<br>
will be less that the art has seen the need for to convert NO to NO2 for use as a soot<br>
oxidant, preferably having a metal loading of less than 15 gm/ft3, e.g., 1 to 15 gm/ft3,<br>
platinum group metal loading, desirably less than 10 gm/ft3, and most preferably 3 to 5<br>
gm/ft3. These low catalyst loadings aid in burning soot, without creating so much NO2 that<br>
excessive emission of the NO2 becomes an environmental problem. Among the suitable<br>
precious metals for catalyzing the DOC are those identified in the Cooper, et al, patent<br>
identified above, and particularly comprises platinum group metal.<br>
[0014] In one embodiment of the invention, a lightly catalyzed DOC contains less than 15<br>
grams per cubic foot (gm/ft3), e.g., 1 to 15 gm/ft3, platinum group metal loading, desirably<br>
less than 10 gm/ft3, and preferably 3 to 5 gm/ft3, used with a platinum and cerium FBC at<br>
0.015-0.5 ppm Pt and 0.5-8 ppm Ce and/or iron. Higher and lower levels of additives may<br>
be employed for portions of a treatment or operation cycle. A further discussion of FBC<br>
compositions is provided below.<br>
[0015] The improved systems of the invention significantly reduce PM, e.g., by 30 to 50 %<br>
in preferred embodiments, e.g., when used with ultra low sulfur diesel fuel and does not<br>
increase NO2 above baseline and has demonstrated the ability to maintain low NO2<br>
emissions, e.g., to below 20% of total nitrogen oxide species while also minimizing the use<br>
of platinum group metals.<br>
[0016] Among the diesel fuels suitable for use in the invention are those which typically<br>
comprise a fossil fuel, such as any of the typical petroleum-derived fuels including distillate<br>
fuels. The diesel fuel can be of any of those formulations disclosed in the above priority<br>
patent applications, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. A fuel<br>
can be one or a blend of fuels selected from the group consisting of distillate fuels,<br>
including diesel fuel, e.g., No. 2 Diesel fuel, No. 1 Diesel fuel, jet fuel, e.g., Jet A, or the<br>
like which is similar in boiling point and viscosity to No. 1 Diesel fuel, ultra low sulfur<br>
diesel fuel (ULSD) and biologically-derived fuels, such as those comprising a "mono-alkyl<br>
ester-based oxygenated fuel", i.e., fatty acid esters, preferably methyl esters of fatty acids<br>
derived from triglycerides, e.g., soybean oil, Canola oil and/or tallow.<br>
[0017] Jet A and Diesel No. 1 are deemed equivalent for applications of the invention, but<br>
are covered by different American Society For Testing and Materials (ASTM)<br>
specifications. The diesel fuels are covered by ASTM D 975, "Standard Specification for<br>
Diesel Fuel Oils". Jet A has the designation of ASTM D 1655, "Standard Specification for<br><br>
WO 2006/078762	PCT/US2006/001813<br>
5<br>
Aviation Turbine Fuels". The term ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) means No. 1 or No.<br>
2 diesel fuels with a sulfur level no higher than 0.0015 percent by weight (15 ppm) and<br>
some jurisdictions require a low aromatic hydrocarbon content e.g., less than ten percent by<br>
volume.<br>
[0018] The process of the invention employs a fuel-soluble, multi-metal catalyst, i.e., an<br>
FBC, preferably comprising fuel-soluble platinum and either cerium or iron or both cerium<br>
and iron. The cerium and/or iron are typically employed at concentrations of from 0.5 to 20<br>
ppm and the platinum from 0.0005 to 2 ppm, with preferred levels of cerium and/or iron<br>
being from 5 to 10 ppm, e.g., 7.5 ppm, and the platinum being employed at a level of from<br>
0.0005 to 0.5 ppm, e.g., less than 0.15 ppm. In some embodiments, the treatment regimen<br>
can call for the utilizing higher catalyst concentrations initially or at defined intervals or as<br>
needed—but not for the whole treatment as has been necessary in the past. The cerium<br>
and/or iron are preferred at levels of cerium and/or iron being from 2 to 10 ppm, e.g., 3-8<br>
ppm, and the platinum being employed at a level of from 0.05 to 0.5 ppm, e.g., from 0.1 to<br>
0.5ppm, e.g., 0.15 ppm, for typical operations. The tests below run at these levels show<br>
surprising results in terms emissions utilizing a lightly catalyzed DOC.<br>
[0019] The cerium and/or iron FBC is preferred at concentrations of 1 to 15 ppm cerium<br>
and/or iron w/v of fuel, e.g., 4 to 15 ppm. A preferred ratio of cerium and/or iron to<br>
platinum for the FBC is from 100:1 to 3:1, e.g., more typically will be from 75:1 to 10:1. A<br>
formulation using 0.15 ppm platinum with 7.5 ppm cerium and/or iron is exemplary.<br>
[0020] An advantage of low levels of catalyst (about 3 to 15 ppm total), preferably below<br>
12 ppm and more preferably below 8 ppm, is the reduction in ultra fine particles resulting<br>
from metal oxide emissions. Data published under the European VERT program show that<br>
at high FBC dose rates of 20 ppm, or 100 ppm, cerium the number of ultra fine particles<br>
increases dramatically above baseline. However, for a bimetallic used at 0.5/7.5 or 0.25/4<br>
ppm there is no significant increase in the ultra fine particle number. It has been found that<br>
at low levels of FBC there is not a separate ultrafine oxide particle peak and metal oxides<br>
are contained in the soot over the entire particle size distribution. A further advantage of<br>
the low dose rates prescribed by the current invention is a reduction in the contribution of<br>
metal ash to overall engine emissions. For an engine meeting 1998 US emission standards,<br>
particulate emissions are limited to 100,000 μg/hp-hr (0.1 gram/hp-hr). A cerium FBC used<br>
at 30 ppm in fuel represents a metal catalyst input loading to the engine of 6000 μg/hp-hr of<br><br>
WO 2006/078762	PCT/US2006/001813<br>
6<br>
metal or roughly 6% of untreated engine emissions. Therefore, low levels of catalyst used<br>
in the present invention of less than 8 ppm and preferably 4 ppm as a bimetallic or<br>
trimetallic FBC will, for example, contribute only 800 - 1600 μg/hp-hr of catalyst loading<br>
to the engine or 0.8 - 1.6% of baseline soot emissions. This has the advantage of reduced<br>
metal ash emissions and reduces the contribution of the FBC to overall particulate mass<br>
emissions or loading of metal ash to downstream emission control devices.<br>
[0021] The fuel can contain detergent (e.g., 50-300 ppm), lubricity additive (e.g., 25 to<br>
about 500 ppm), other additives, and suitable fuel-soluble catalyst metal compositions, e.g.,<br>
0.1-2 ppm fuel soluble platinum group metal composition, e.g., platinum COD or platinum<br>
acetylacetonate and/or 2-20 ppm fuel soluble cerium and/or iron composition, e.g., cerium<br>
as a soluble compound or suspension, cerium octoate, ferrocene, iron oleate, iron octoate<br>
and the like. The fuel as defined, is combusted without the specific need for other treatment<br>
devices although they can be used especially for higher levels of control on diesels.<br>
[0022] Among the specific cerium compounds are: cerium III acetylacetonate, cerium III<br>
napthenate, and cerium octoate, cerium oleate and other soaps such as stearate,<br>
neodecanoate, and other C6 to C24 alkanoic acids, and the like. Many of the cerium<br>
compounds are trivalent compounds meeting the formula: Ce (OOCR)3 wherein<br>
R=hydrocarbon, preferably C2 to C22, and including aliphatic, alicyclic, aryl and alkylaryl.<br>
Preferably, the cerium is supplied as cerium hydroxy oleate propionate complex (40%<br>
cerium by weight) or a cerium octoate (12% cerium by weight). Preferred levels are toward<br>
the lower end of this range.<br>
[0023] Among the specific iron compounds are: ferrocene, ferric and ferrous acetyl-<br>
acetonates, iron soaps like octoate and stearate (commercially available as Fe(III)<br>
compounds, usually), iron napthenate, iron tallate and other C6 to C24 alcanoic acids, iron<br>
penta carbonyl Fe(CO)5 and the like.<br>
[0024] Any of the platinum group metal compositions, e.g., 1,5-cycIooctadiene platinum<br>
diphenyl (platinum COD), described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,891,050 to Bowers, et al., U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,034,020 to Epperly, et al, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,083 to Peter-Hoblyn, et al., can be<br>
employed as the platinum source. Other suitable platinum group metal catalyst<br>
compositions include commercially-available or easily-synthesized platinum group metal<br>
acetylacetonates, including substituted (e.g., alkyl, aryl, alkyaryl substituted) and<br><br>
WO 2006/078762	PCT/US2006/001813<br>
7<br>
unsubstituted acetylacetonates, platinum group metal dibenzylidene acetonates, and fatty<br>
acid soaps of tetramine platinum metal complexes, e.g., tetramine platinum oleate.<br>
[0025] The invention can employ a DOC alone or it can be used with other devices<br>
including DPFs, particulars reactors, partial filters or NOX adsorbers can also be used and<br>
benefit from reduced engine out emissions of the current invention. See the examples<br>
below, for the engine out results and the benefits of the FBC with catalyzed DOC devices<br>
to reduce NO2 and particulate emissions. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, the<br>
unexpectedly good results with after treatnent devices as well as for engine out emissions,<br>
this may be because the platinum is not present in amounts sufficient to produce excessive<br>
amounts of NO2 and yet produces some NO2 which is sufficient to foster oxidation of the<br>
carbon in the particulates in the presence of low levels of cerium and/or iron. NO2 is a<br>
strong lung irritant and can be generated in large quantities by traditional use of heavily<br>
catalyzed aftertreatment devices such as DOCs, DPFs or combinations. The net result of the<br>
limited NO2 production due to low platinum concentrations and the cerium and/or iron<br>
being present in low but sufficient amounts is to produce greater than expected reductions<br>
in particulates (as well as other species resulting from incomplete oxidation) and at the<br>
same time control the amount of NO2 generated and released. Unlike the prior art, then, the<br>
invention has found that high NO2 production rates are not necessary and, indeed, has<br>
found a way to provide emissions less irritating to humans.<br>
[0026] The following examples are presented to further explain and illustrate the invention<br>
and are not to be taken as limiting in any regard. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and<br>
percentages are by weight.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0027] This example reports testing on a 1990 International DT 466 7.6 liter diesel engine<br>
operated over replicate hot transient test cycles on an engine dynamometer. Emissions<br>
results are the average of triplicate tests and are measured in units of grams/hp-hr. Testing<br>
on untreated No. 2 diesel fuel with &gt; 300 ppm sulfur produced baseline particulate<br>
emissions of 0.253 gr/hr-hr and NO2 of 1.1 g/hp-hr or 18% of total nitrogen oxides in the<br>
exhaust. Use of a bimetallic FBC in the No. 2D fuel at a dose rate of 0.15 ppm Pt and 7.5<br>
ppm Ce reduced PM by 15% to 0.215 gr/hp-hr with NO2 reduced to 12% of total nitrogen<br>
oxide emissions.<br><br>
WO 2006/078762	PCT/US2006/001813<br>
8<br>
[0028] Installation of a lightly catalyzed ceramic DOC with 3 grams/cu ft of precious metal<br>
loading operated on untreated No. 2D fuel produced PM emissions of 0.196 gr/hp-hr or a<br>
23% reduction from baseline. No measurement of NO2 was made due to unavailability of<br>
test equipment. Use of FBC treated No. 2D with the lightly catalyzed DOC reduced PM<br>
emissions to 0.178 gr/hp-hr for a 30% reduction while further reducing NO2 emission to<br>
8% of total nitrogen oxide emissions.<br>
[0029] Use of the same DOC with the engine operated on FBC treated ULSD (
reduced PM by 34% to 0.168 gr/hp-hr with NO2 emissions at 8% of total NOx. These<br>
results demonstrate the ability of the FBC to enhance the overall PM reduction efficiency of<br>
a lightly catalyzed DOC even on No. 2D fuel where the use of traditional heavily catalyzed<br>
devices can cause conversion of sulfur species to sulfate particulate emissions and increase<br>
NO2 emissions.<br>
[0030] Another unexpected benefit of the FBC used with a lightly catalyzed DOC is the<br>
reduction in NO2 emissions versus baseline. NO2 emissions are generally increased with<br>
traditional heavily catalyzed devices, but are decreased by over 50% with the FBC/DOC<br>
combination described in the invention.<br>

exhaust aftertreatment DOC installed. Particulate emissions were determined from the<br>
average composite at 0.190 gr/hp-hr.<br>
[0033] Fuel was switched to FBC treated commercial ULSD (
DOC-1 was installed in the engine exhaust. The engine was run for 16 hours and tested for<br>
emissions. Average particulate emissions were reduced by over 53% to 0.089 gr/hp-hr.<br>
Total NO2 was also reduced by more than 50% from 0.9 gr/hp-hr to 0.4 gr/hp-hr.<br>
[0034] The DOC was a 9.5" dia. x 6" L 400 cpsi ceramic substrate made by Corning, Inc.<br>
and catalyzed with 3 gr/cu ft. of precious metal by Clean Air Systems, Inc. of New Mexico.<br>
It was installed in a stainless steel can with conventional inlet and outlet cones. The FBC<br>
was a platinum/cerium bimetallic used at a dose rate of 0.5 ppm/7.5 ppm.<br>
[0035] An identical field aged DOC-2 which had been operated in commercial field service<br>
for 1000 hours on FBC treated ULSD was also tested using FBC treated ULSD. Average<br>
particulate emissions were reduced by 48% to 0.098 gr/hp-hr and NO2 emissions were held<br>
to 13% of overall nitrogen oxide representing a level of 0.6 gr/hp-hr.<br>
[0036] In another test, an identical DOC-3 that had been operated in commercial service for<br>
1100 hours on FBC treated No. 2D at a 0.15/7.5 ppm dose rate was tested on FBC treated<br>
No. 2D at 0.15/7.5 ppm. Overall PM reduction was to a level of 0.113 gr/hp-hr while total<br>
NO2 was reduced from 0.9 gr/hp-hr to 0.5 gr/hp-hr representing 10% of total nitrogen oxide<br>
emissions versus 19% for the baseline NO2 emissions on No. 2D fuel.<br>
[0037] These data support the unexpected high level of particulate reduction achieved by<br>
low levels of FBC with a lightly catalyzed DOC and confirm that PM performance can be<br>
maintained at high levels even after commercial service with the use of FBC treated fuel.<br>
There is also an unexpected reduction in NO2 from the combination of FBC and DOC,<br>
which is an advantage over heavily catalyzed devices which tend to increase NO2<br>
emissions.<br><br>

Example 3<br>
[0039] This example reports testing that further confirms the benefits of low levels of FBC<br>
in ULSD combined with a lightly catalyzed DOC. In this Example testing was conducted<br>
on a 1995 Navistar DT466, 7.6 liter engine over a single cold and three hot test cycles. The<br>
average of three composite emissions results was calculated and reported in grams/bhp-hr.<br>
Baseline emission results on untreated No. 2D fuel (&gt; 300 ppm S) show average PM<br>
emissions of 0.106 gr/hp-hr with NO2 emissions at 1.1 gr/hp-hr representing 23% of total<br>
NOx emissions.<br>
[0040] Use of ULSD (
PM by 31% to 0.073 gr/hp-hr with NO2 reduced to 0.8 gr/hp-hr or 19% of total NOx<br>
emissions. Reductions in HC, CO and NOx were also observed for the FBC/ULSD<br>
combination.<br>
[0041] In a further test, a degreened lightly catalyzed DOC-1 from Example 2 was installed<br>
in the exhaust and the engine was run on FBC treated ULSD. Overall PM emissions were<br>
reduced by 45% to 0.058 gr/hp-hr while NO2 was reduced to 0.6 gr/hp-hr representing 14%<br>
of overall NOx emissions. Further reductions in HC, CO and NOx were also noted.<br>

CLAIMS<br>
1.	A method for reducing particulate emissions from a diesel engine while also<br>
controlling emissions of NO2 as a percent of exhaust total nitrogen oxides, comprising:<br>
adding a fuel bome catalyst comprising platinum and cerium and/or iron at a total metal<br>
concentration of from 2 to 15 ppm in the fuel to a diesel fuel; and passing exhaust produced<br>
by the combustion through a diesel oxidation catalyst having substrate with a precious<br>
metal catalyst thereon, the catalyst be present on the substrate in an amount of less than 15<br>
grams per cubic foot of substrate.<br>
2.	A diesel emissions control system according to claim 1, wherein the diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst has a catalyst metal loading of less than about 10 grams per cubic foot..<br>
3.	A diesel emissions control system according to claim 1, wherein the fuel comprises<br>
a fuel soluble platinum compound providing from about 0.05 to about 0.5 ppm of platinum<br>
in the fuel.<br>
4.	A diesel emissions control system according to claim 1, wherein the diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst has a catalyst metal loading of from about 3 to 5 grams per cubic foot.<br><br>
An improved diesel operation system employs a lightly diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), preferably with a platinum<br>
containing fuel borne catalyst (FBC) in the fuel. The DOC is at least partially lightly catalyzed with precious metal catalyst, e.g.,<br>
platinum group metal, having a metal loading of from about 3 to 15 grams per cubic foot to minimize formation Of NO2 in the<br>
exhaust gas. Preferred fuel borne catalyst levels will be low, e.g., from 0.05 to 0.5 pprn for platinum and 3 to 8 ppm for cerium<br>
and/or iron, thereby providing effective engine out emissions reductions without discharging excessive amounts of metal catalysts<br>
or NO2 to the atmosphere.<br></td>
