				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a fan type chemical diffusing<br>
apparatus of volatilizing a chemical, a technique for diffusing an active<br>
ingredient of a volatile chemical such as an insecticide, insect repellent<br>
or moth-proofing agent, aromatic chemical and deodorant by ventilating<br>
a carrier body impregnated with the active ingredient while utilizing a<br>
fan type blower powered by a motor.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to a fan type debugging<br>
apparatus for repelling and exterminating or excluding noxious or<br>
harmful insects including bugs such as mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches,<br>
mites, ants and centipedes and clothing bags such as skin beetles and<br>
clothes moths by ventilating a carrier body impregnated with an active<br>
ingredient while using a fan type blower powered by a motor energized<br>
by a battery or cells.<br>
A fan type chemical volatilizing and diffusing apparatus has<br>
been known which is designed to diffuse into the atmosphere, e. g., in a<br>
room an active ingredient of a volatile chemical such as an insecticide,<br>
insect repellent or moth-proofing agent, aromatic chemical and deodor-<br>
ant by the force of a wind.<br>
This typical fan type chemical volatilizing and diffusing appa-<br>
ratus is provided with an air inlet for admitting air from the outside<br>
into the apparatus body and an air outlet for sending out air admitted.<br>
In the air flow passage between the air inlet and the air outlet there are<br>
mounted a fan type blower driven by a motor and an active ingredient<br>
carrier body impregnated with an active ingredient. Provided also in the<br>
apparatus body is a room for accommodating a battery for powering the<br>
motor and hence the fan blower.<br>
The active ingredient impregnated body is disposed either in<br>
the air flow passage between the air inlet and the fan or in the air flow<br>
passage between the fan and the air outlet. Thus, the apparatus is of<br>
the type in which rotating the fan to send air causes the active ingredi-<br>
ent in the impregnated body to diffuse through the air outlet into the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
As shown in JP U H06-4393A, another fan type chemical dif-<br>
fusing apparatus has been known in which the fan in a fan type blower<br>
itself contains a volatile chemical.<br>
The typical fan type chemical diffusing apparatus mentioned<br>
above is provided with the fan type blower and the active ingredient<br>
impregnated body separately in the apparatus body and formed with an<br>
air flow passage in the apparatus body. As a result, it is forced to be<br>
complex in structure and makes the apparatus large in size.<br>
The requirement that the active ingredient impregnated body<br>
and the fan be arranged to efficiently send air into, through and out of<br>
the active ingredient impregnated body tends to make the apparatus<br>
structure complex and large in size.<br>
If the apparatus is to be powered by a battery, providing a<br>
space for accommodating the battery in the apparatus makes the appa-<br>
ratus even more complex and larger in size.<br>
It should be noted in particular that the site in which the ac-<br><br>
tive ingredient impregnated body is placed determines the size of the<br>
apparatus and a degree of its complexity.<br>
The fan type chemical diffusing apparatus disclosed in JP U<br>
H06-4393A by having the fan effectively functioning as the active in-<br>
gredient impregnated body seeks to resolve the problem of how it can<br>
efficiently be arranged and to simplify the apparatus structure. How-<br>
ever, many problems still remain unresolved, for example, as regards an<br>
unsatisfactory durability (e. g., brittleness) of the fan which must be<br>
made by forming, a limited impregnable amount (small amount) of an<br>
active ingredient and, if the fan is of replacement type, the time, labor<br>
and cost entailed for replacement, which may make the apparatus poor<br>
in utility and serviceability.<br>
As an example of the fan type chemical diffusing apparatus<br>
using a fan type blower, a debugging apparatus of first type for repel-<br>
ling and exterminating or excluding a noxious or harmful insect has<br>
also been disclosed which is designed to volatilize a chemical by<br>
providing an air flow through the chemical by means of a fan blower<br>
driven by a motor. See, for example, JP P S53-14329A, JP U S61-<br>
182273A, JP U H06-75179A, WO96/04786, JP P H08-154554A, JP P<br>
H11-504627A and JP P H11-28040A.<br>
As another example as disclosed in JP P H05-68459A, a debug-<br>
ging apparatus of second type has also been disclosed in which a volatile<br>
chemical is retained, within the chemical diffusing fan which may be<br>
rotated to volatilize the chemical.<br>
Further, as another example, a third type of debugging appara-<br>
tus has been known as disclosed in JP P H07-111850A, a third type of<br><br>
debugging apparatus has been disclosed in which a carrier impregnated<br>
with a chemical and also functioning to rectify a gas flow is disposed in<br>
the air intake side of a fan which may be rotated to cause an air flow<br>
created to volatilize the chemical.<br>
The first type debugging apparatus seems to lack concreteness<br>
and seems to have many problems to be resolved for practical use.<br>
The second type debugging apparatus is technologically concre-<br>
te and practical but if ever practiced seems to lack flexibility. A need to<br>
make the retainer larger in size in order to volatilize a larger amount of<br>
a chemical proportionally increases energy needed to drive the fan.<br>
The third type debugging apparatus is technologically concrete<br>
and practical but is noted to require the carrier not only to be larger in<br>
area but to have a shape suitable to reduce air resistance as much as<br>
possible. As the present inventors' scrutiny indicates, the idea of re-<br>
quiring the active ingredient impregnated body to be larger in area in<br>
order to volatilize a larger amount of the active ingredient must be jus-<br>
tified. But, the idea of requiring it to be shaped so as to reduce wind<br>
resistance as much as possible was found much questionable.<br>
For to remove wind resistance means reducing wind pressure<br>
per unit area and this would reduce a force to detach the chemical from<br>
the carrier. Then, the phenomenon would take place that the wind<br>
passes away from the carrier without enough carrying the chemical, or a<br>
reduction in chemical concentration per unit air flow. This is a loss in<br>
wind force and in other words a loss in driving energy.<br>
In contrast, excessively increasing air resistance would reduce<br>
the wind speed of a wind coming out of the air outlet and lose the ca-<br><br>
pacity to carry the chemical far.<br>
As an example of the debugging apparatus using a fan type<br>
blower, a fourth type of such apparatus has also been proposed which is<br>
designed to volatilize a chemical by providing an air flow through the<br>
chemical by means of a fan blower driven by a motor. See, for example,<br>
JP P S53-14329A, JP U S61-182273A, JP U H06-75179A, WO96/04786,<br>
JP P H08-154554 and JP P H11-504627A.<br>
Further, as another example, a fifth type of debugging appara-<br>
tus has also been proposed as disclosed in JP P H11-28040A which com-<br>
prises a DC motor powered by a battery and a fan to be driven by the DC<br>
motor to provide an air flow through a chemical for its volatilization.<br>
The fourth type debugging apparatus seems to lack concrete-<br>
ness for using a battery as power supply and seems to have many prob-<br>
lems to be resolved for practical use.<br>
The fifth type debugging apparatus is an apparatus with a bat-<br>
tery as power supply and is shown in its second apparatus to have a<br>
current consumption of not greater than 100 milliamperes when the DC<br>
motor is unloaded. However, no consideration appears to be taken, e. g.,<br>
in efficiently using the battery to allow the chemical to be volatilized for<br>
a prolonged time period.<br>
Thus, a fan type debugging apparatus for repelling and ex-<br>
cluding harmful or noxious insects as previously described is used as<br>
placed on a storage space in a house in order to run over a long period of<br>
time or as carried by a worker for use to run outdoors. It is therefore<br>
desirable that the apparatus have the ability to volatilize a chemical for<br>
a long time without the need to change the battery.<br><br>
Another example of the fan type debugging apparatus has also<br>
been known as disclosed, for example, in JP P H11-308955A.<br>
This fan type debugging apparatus has an apparatus body<br>
provided with a motor, a fan, a battery and a chemical retainer and is<br>
operable to provide an air flow through the chemical retainer from the<br>
fun by driving the motor with the battery power to volatilise the chemi-<br>
cal. It is shown that the motor is intermittently operated to iteratively<br>
have a time period of air flow and a time period of halt alternately with<br>
the time period of halt being ten times or more as long as the time peri-<br>
od of air flow.<br>
The fan type debugging apparatus referred to above is designed<br>
for use as placed in a storage space such as a wardrobe or closet and is<br>
there found to extend the debugging component enough inside the closed<br>
space and capable of maintaining its efficacy enough for a long time.<br>
However, using this type of apparatus as placed in a living<br>
space in a dwelling proves it insufficiently efficacious.<br>
There have also bee known chemical volatilizing and diffusing<br>
methods using the wind force of a fan to volatilize and diffuse a volatile<br>
chemical into the atmosphere. For example, JP U S61-182273A discloses<br>
applying a wind from the fan to a chemical impregnated retainer body<br>
having a moderate air permeability, and JP P H07-11850A discloses<br>
defining a relationship between a fan's wind force and a permeability.<br>
To the present inventors' knowledge, all the chemical impreg-<br>
nated or retainer bodies (active ingredient impregnated bodies) so far<br>
proposed in the prior art are bodies which are solidified and monolithic.<br>
For this reason, they provide an effective means if chemicals to be car-<br><br>
ried thereby are high in vapor pressure and thus highly volatile. If a<br>
need arises to volatilize a chemical which is less volatile or hard to<br>
volatilize or to volatilize a plenty of a chemical at a time, it has become<br>
necessary to take a measure such as: (1) to make larger the area of<br>
volatilization of a chemical impregnated body; (2) to make larger voids<br>
in a chemical impregnated body to facilitate wind passage; and to inten-<br>
sify the fan's output.<br>
It has been found, however, that any of these measure cannot<br>
be taken without making larger the entire volume of the chemical im-<br>
pregnated body, or without making the fan larger in size or deteriorat-<br>
ing energy efficiency. Especially, an increase of the chemical impreg-<br>
nated body in size brings about the problems as follows:<br>
(1) Local changes in air flow within the chemical impregnated<br>
body. Thus, as it becomes distant especially from the wind<br>
blow outlet, the air flow per unit time tends to be reduced<br>
by an air resistance that develops in the chemical impreg-<br>
nated body. If the chemical impregnated body is larger in<br>
the direction of the wind, the wind force which the chemical<br>
impregnated body instantaneously receives varies from one<br>
site to another. This leads to an unbalance of volatilization<br>
over the entire impregnated body and prevents the chemi-<br>
cal from volatilizing stably.<br>
(2) Even if the situation (1) develops, stable volatilization will<br>
be possible even for the solidified, monolithic chemical im-<br>
pregnated body if the chemical impregnated is quickly<br>
made even in the body. However, increase in the size of the<br><br>
chemical impregnated body makes longer the distance for<br>
the chemical to move and requires longer time for the<br>
chemical to be made even in the body.<br>
(3) An increase in size of the chemical impregnated body for<br>
the reason of the problem mentioned at (1) above also<br>
brings about a drop in the air flow per unit time from the<br>
air outlets (volatilization outlets) of the chemical impreg-<br>
nated body receptacle, which leads to a drop in the ability<br>
of the chemical to volatilize into a room and in turn to a<br>
drop in the efficacy of the chemical. Made to resolve these<br>
problems, an attempt to intensify the fan's wind force is an<br>
attempt to waste energy and proves inefficient and uneco-<br>
nomical.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
fan type chemical diffusing apparatus that can resolve one or more of<br>
the problems mentioned earlier.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a fan<br>
type debugging apparatus for repelling and exterminating or expelling a<br>
noxious or harmful insect that permits an active ingredient to be vola-<br>
tilized in a maximum amount with a minimum input driving energy.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a fan<br>
type debugging apparatus operated with a battery which permit a<br>
chemical to be volatilized over a prolonged time period without the need<br>
to exchange the battery.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a fan<br>
type debugging apparatus usable in a living space, proving a sufficient<br>
efficacy and capable of maintaining the sufficient efficacy for a pro-<br>
longed time period.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a chemi-<br>
cal volatilizing method that permits a volatile chemical having insecti-<br>
cide, insect repellent or growth control function to be diffused and dis-<br>
persed stably by a wind force over a prolonged time period for a variety<br>
of noxious or harmful insects, regardless of the vapor pressure the<br>
chemical possesses and the amount of volatilization the chemical is<br>
aimed for.<br>
There is provided in accordance with the present invention in a<br>
first form of implementation thereof a fan type chemical diffusing appa-<br>
ratus, characterized in that it comprises: an apparatus main body hav-<br>
ing an air inlet and an air outlet; a fan type blower disposed in the ap-<br>
paratus main body and having a fan casing, a fan provided with a hollow<br>
space, and a motor; and an active ingredient impregnated body or mass<br>
disposed in the hollow space for containing an active ingredient,<br>
wherein the fan type blower is adapted and operative to send air from<br>
the air inlet through the hollow space into and out of the air outlet.<br>
This first form of implementation of the present invention that<br>
requires that a fan be uniquely provided with a hollow space adapted to<br>
accommodate therein an active ingredient impregnated body or mass<br>
only requires the apparatus body portion to have a space therein just<br>
enough to accommodate the fan blower, and eliminates the conventional<br>
need to provide an extra space for separately accommodating an active<br>
ingredient impregnated body.<br>
This simplifies the apparatus body interior structurally and<br>
makes the apparatus compact and small sized.<br>
Also, eliminating the requirement to dispose the active ingre-<br>
dient impregnated body beside the fan blower in the body portion of the<br>
apparatus, it enhances its design flexibility.<br>
Also, the fan is found not to reduce its durability and capable of<br>
retaining a sufficient amount of an active ingredient.<br>
In the construction stated above, the active ingredient impreg-<br>
nated body or mass is preferably fixed to one of the said fan casing and<br>
the apparatus main body.<br>
This specific construction permits the active ingredient im-<br>
pregnated body or mass to be placed as non-rotatable with the fan and<br>
to be kept not to increase the rotational resistance of the fan, and thus<br>
not to create a waste in its driving force.<br>
In the construction stated above, the active ingredient impreg-<br>
nated body or mass is preferably mounted removably in the hollow<br>
space.<br>
This construction makes the apparatus economical because it<br>
then requires only the active ingredient impregnated bod}7 or mass to be<br>
exchanged while leaving the fan intact.<br>
Extensive and zealous investigations and experiments con-<br>
ducted by the present inventors with what have been stated hereinbe-<br>
fore taken into consideration have revealed that there is a delicate bal-<br>
ancing relationship between wind resistance and amounts of volatiliza-<br>
tion of an active ingredient and has led them to the form of<br><br>
implementation of the invention mentioned below.<br>
Thus, in accordance with a second form of implementation of<br>
the present invention there is provided a fan type debugging apparatus<br>
for repelling and excluding or expelling a noxious or harmful insect with<br>
an active ingredient containing as its principal component at least one<br>
chemical having a vapor pressure of not less than 1.0 X 10 -4 mm Hg at<br>
a temperature of 30 °C and effective to act as an insecticide or acar-<br>
icide or to control growth, or to hinder bloodsucking, biting or eating<br>
behavior, of the insect, or to repel the insect, or effective to prevent any<br>
other damage by the insect, the apparatus having an active ingredient<br>
impregnated body or mass adapted to retain and release by volatiliza-<br>
tion the active ingredient, and including a fan type blower powered to<br>
be driven by a motor, characterized in that: the said active ingredient<br>
impregnated body or mass is disposed in a wind inlet side of the said fan<br>
type blower and is designed to provide a wind force resistance R which<br>
in terms of the proportion of current consumption E2 by the said motor<br>
in the presence of the said active ingredient impregnated body or mass<br>
to current consumption El by the said motor in the absence of the said<br>
active ingredient impregnated body or mass, ranges from 5 to 25 %<br>
where R is expressed by the equation: R = 100 - E2 / E1 X 100.<br>
This second form of implementation of the present invention<br>
enables a motor driving energy to be efficiently utilized to volatilize a<br>
plenty of active ingredients, and provides volatilization of a maximum<br>
amount of the active ingredient and thus a maximum extent of vermin<br>
or insect damage prevention at a minimum amount of input energy.<br>
In order to achieve the object or objects mentioned before, ex-<br><br>
tensive investigations and experiments conducted by the present inven-<br>
tors in variously changing fan's air resistance index, fan size and<br>
weight and motor parameters have led them to the following form of<br>
implementation of the invention.<br>
Thus, in accordance with a third form of implementation of the<br>
present invention there is provided a fan type debugging apparatus for<br>
repelling and excluding a noxious or harmful insect with an active in-<br>
gredient containing as its principal component at least one chemical<br>
having a vapor pressure of not less than 1.0 X 10-4 mm Hg at a tem-<br>
perature of 30 oC and effective to act as an insecticide or acaricide or to<br>
control growth, or to hinder bloodsucking, biting or eating behavior, of<br>
the insect, or to repel the insect, or effective to prevent any other dam-<br>
age by the insect, the apparatus having an active ingredient impregnat-<br>
ed body or mass adapted to retain and release by volatilization the said<br>
active ingredient, and including a fan type blower powered to be driven<br>
by a motor which is in turned by a battery, characterized in that the<br>
said fan type blower comprises a fan having: an air resistance f which<br>
when expressed by current consumption I1 by the said motor loaded with<br>
the said fan divided by current consumption Io by the said motor when<br>
unloaded with the said fan, ranges not less than 1 but not greater than<br>
17; a size in a range between 20 mm and 100 mm in diameter; and a<br>
weight in a range between 1.5 gram and 8 grams, wherein values of the<br>
said fan air resistance, size and weight are selected as aforesaid and<br>
further so that the current consumption by the said motor loaded with<br>
the said fan has a current value such that the ratio of a time period in<br>
which the said fan can be driven by the said battery to the capacity of<br><br>
the said battery is not less than 5 %.<br>
This third form of implementation of the present invention<br>
permits a motor to be driven effectively to ventilate an active ingredient<br>
impregnated body or mass for a prolonged gross time period without the<br>
need to exchange a battery and thus the active ingredient to be volatil-<br>
ized for such a long gross period without the need to replace the battery<br>
for.<br>
The failure of the conventional fan type debugging apparatus if<br>
used as placed in a living space to yield enough efficacy as mentioned<br>
herein earlier was reasoned by the present inventors as follows:<br>
¦ In contrast to a wardrobe or closet in which the convention-<br>
al fan type debugging is usable as placed and which is<br>
opened or closed usually only twice or so a day in the<br>
morning and evening, a living space has a number of visi-<br>
tors and is opened and closed frequently a day, and hence<br>
has air entry and exit much more than the storage space.<br>
¦ For this reason, making the time period in which the air<br>
flow is halted so long as ten times longer than the time<br>
period in which air is driven to flow prevents the debugging<br>
agent (active ingredient) from spreading and diffusing<br>
enough to an extent that a satisfactory efficacy is obtained.<br>
Extensive and zealous investigations and experiments con-<br>
ducted by the present inventors with these reasons taken into consid-<br>
eration have led them to the following form of implementation of the<br>
invention:<br>
Thus, in accordance with a fourth form of implementation of<br><br>
the present invention there is provided a fan type debugging apparatus<br>
for repelling and excluding a noxious or harmful insect with an active<br>
ingredient containing as its principal component at least one chemical<br>
having a vapor pressure of not less than 1.0 X 10-4 mm Hg at a tem-<br>
perature of 30 °C and effective to act as an insecticide or acaricide or to<br>
control growth, or to hinder bloodsucking, biting or eating behavior, of<br>
the insect, or to repel the insect, or effective to prevent any other dam-<br>
age by the insect, the apparatus having an active ingredient impregnat-<br>
ed body or mass adapted to retain and release by volatilization the said<br>
active ingredient, and including a fan type blower powered to be driven<br>
by a motor, characterized in that: the said fan type blower is operable to<br>
iteratively run and halt alternately with a time period of halt not more<br>
than 9 (nine) times as long as a running time period, the said time<br>
period of halt being also a time period in which a current or quantity of<br>
electricity not lost therein is more than a current or a quantity of elec-<br>
tricity consumed in excess by the said motor in the said running time<br>
period.<br>
This fourth form of implementation of the present invention<br>
permits an apparatus if used as placed in a living space to provide a<br>
sufficient efficacy and to retain this efficacy for a prolonged period of<br>
time.<br>
In a construction as stated above, desirably:<br>
The said active ingredient impregnated body or mass comprises<br>
a mass of discrete particles impregnable with the said active ingredient<br>
and the said particles each have a shape such that a maximum area of<br>
contact with one particle with another is not larger than one half of a<br><br>
total surface area thereof;<br>

An explanation is first given in respect of an apparatus ac-<br>
cording to the first form of embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the apparatus comprises an appara-<br>
tus main body or body portion 1 which as a whole is in the form of a<br>
substantially rectangular box having its one side portion 2 and its other<br>
side portion 3.<br>
The first side portion 2 is made up of a substantially rectan-<br>
gular side face plate 2a and a first, a second, a third and a fourth end<br>
face plate 2b, 2c, 2d and 2e which are continuous with the peripheral<br>
portion of the side face plate 2a.The first side portion 2 is thus in the<br>
form of a substantially rectangular box with one side face open. Dis-<br>
posed between the first and second end face plates 2b and 2c which are<br>
opposed to each other and lying closer to the third end face plate d is a<br>
partition plate 4 fastened thereto, whose horizontal cross section is<br>
shaped substantially in the form of letter "U", and which subdivides the<br>
apparatus body portion 1 into a fan type blower accommodating cham-<br>
ber 5 and a battery chamber 6.<br>
The third end face plate 2d is formed with an opening 7 shown<br>
as closed with a cover 8 for putting dry cells 9 in and out of the battery<br>
chamber 6 by opening the cover 8.<br>
The other side portion 3 is planar and is removably attached to<br>
an opening 10 formed by the first, second, third and fourth end face<br>
plates 2b, 2c, 2d and 2e. The other side portion 3 is so attached, e. g., in<br>
a snap fit or in a hinged door fit.<br>
A fan type blower 11 is shown disposed in the fan type blower<br>
accommodating chamber 5 and comprises a fan casing 12, a fan 13 and<br>
an electric motor 14.<br>
The fan casing 12 which comprises its one side face plate 12a,<br>
other side face plate 12b and peripheral face plate 12c has a recess 15<br>
formed in a center region of the one side face plate 12a so as to sink<br>
towards the opening 10 to hold the motor 14 therein. The other side face<br>
plate 12b is formed with a large diameter hollow 16 which is toroidal.<br>
The peripheral face plate 12c is formed with a discharge or<br>
delivery outlet 17 which is continuous with an air outlet 18 formed in<br>
the first end face plate 2b.<br>
The fan 13 is configured in the form of a centrifugal fan, com-<br>
prising a rotary disk 13a and a large number of radially extending<br>
blades 13b fastened thereto closer to its periphery. The rotary disk 13a<br>
is formed closer to its center with a cylindrical and a planner portion 19<br>
and 20 forming a hollow that sinks towards the large diameter hollow 16,<br>
and providing an annular hollow space 21 between the cylindrical por-<br>
tion 19 and the blades 13b. The hollow space 21 is open to communicate<br>
with the atmosphere via an intake ope.ning 22 between the large diame-<br>
ter hollow 16 of the other side face plate 12b and the cylindrical portion<br>
19.<br>
The motor 14 has its drive shaft 14a connected to the planar<br><br>
portion 20 of the fan 13 and is driven to rotate the fan 13.<br>
Unloadably loaded in the hollow space 21 of the fan 13 is a car-<br>
tridge-type active ingredient or a carrier body or mass 23 for the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
The active ingredient carrier body or mass 23 includes a hous-<br>
ing 24 that is hollow and toroidal in which a large number of particulate<br>
or granular processed goods 25 of active ingredient are contained. In<br>
loading the body 23, the housing 24 may be inserted from the intake<br>
opening 22 into the hollow space 21 and then fixed in position by fas-<br>
tening attachment pieces 24a provided for the housing 24 to the other<br>
side face plate 12b of the fan casing 12 by means of machine screws 26.<br>
The housing 24 is formed with a large number of air outlets 27<br>
opposed to the blades 13b and air inlets 28 which are opposed to air<br>
intake ports 29 formed in the other side portion or member 3. The other<br>
side member 3 is provided with an airflow guide 30.<br>
In operation, rotating the fan 13 by the motor 14 causes air to<br>
be drawn from the atmosphere through the intake ports 29 and the air<br>
inlets 28 into the housing 24 and, ventilating the particulate processed<br>
goods 25, allows the chemical to volatilize and then spread into the at-<br>
mosphere through the air outlets 27, the discharge outlet 17 and the air<br>
outlet port 18.<br>
Then, with the active ingredient impregnated body or mass 23<br>
itself non-rotated, the fan 13 is prevented from increasing its rotational<br>
resistance.<br>
Also, the ability to take the active ingredient impregnated body<br>
or mass 23 out of the hollow space 21 into the outside of the apparatus<br><br>
body portion 1 by removing the other side member 3 and loosening the<br>
machine screws 26 allows the active ingredient impregnated or carrier<br>
body or mass 23 to be exchanged as desired.<br>
An explanation is next given in respect of modifications of the<br>
first form of embodiment of the invention.<br>
Thus, first with respect to the direction of ventilation, while in<br>
the form of embodiment described above air is drawn through a lower<br>
surface to flow out through a side surface of the fan type blower 11 with<br>
its axis of rotation (i. e., the drive shaft 14a of the motor 14) set to ex-<br>
tend vertically, as an alternative air can be, e. g., drawn through one<br>
side surface to flow out through another side surface, or drawn through<br>
an upper surface to flow out through a side surface of the fan type<br>
blower 11 with the air inlet and outlet ports 29 and 18 properly rear-<br>
ranged.<br>
Likewise, the form of the apparatus can be altered according to<br>
its aimed use. For example, it is possible to set the axis of rotation of<br>
the fan type blower 11 (i. e., the drive shaft 14a of the motor 14) to ex-<br>
tend in a transverse (front and rear) direction, thus to make the<br>
apparatus longer vertically and suitable for placement in a vertical<br>
clearance.<br>
For the fan 13 of the fan type blower 11 for use in the present<br>
invention, in order to change the air flow from an axial direction to a<br>
radial direction, use is made of a centrifugal fan in which a centrifugal<br>
force is applied to impart an energy to the flow.<br>
A centrifugal fan is preferable for the fan 13 because it has a<br>
large number of blades which are wider in width and lower in height,<br><br>
and structurally it has no blade but a hollow space in its central area.<br>
A centrifugal fan is preferable also because it is high in blast<br>
power and relatively small in size.<br>
Illustrative are, for example, a turbo fan, an airfoil fan, a lim-<br>
ited load fan, a radial fan, a multi-blade fan and so on.<br>
It is also preferable that a centrifugal fan as mentioned above<br>
be placed in a volute, spiral or scroll casing designed to bring together<br>
efficiently winds produced by rotating the fan and then to let them out.<br>
For the active ingredient impregnated body or mass 23 for<br>
loading in the hollow space 21 of the above mentioned centrifugal fan,<br>
use may also be made of processed goods or a formed body or bodies<br>
which can be impregnated with a volatile chemical as an active ingredi-<br>
ent.<br>
Illustrative are, for example, processed goods so as to have an<br>
active ingredient coated thereon by spraying or the like, or such proc-<br>
essed goods accommodated in air-permeable housing as in the case of<br>
Figs. 1 and 2, or a formed body or bodies such as of a synthetic resin<br>
containing an active ingredient.<br>
No limitation is imposed on materials that may make up the<br>
processed goods or formed body except that they must be capable of fully<br>
containing an active ingredient and that they must be capable of re-<br>
leasing it when ventilated.<br>
Illustrative for such materials are, for example, pulp, paper<br>
such as filter paper or cardboard, a natural fiber such as of cotton, wool<br>
or chingma, an artificial fiber such as of polyester, nylon or polyolefine,<br>
a carbon fiber, a glass fiber, a ceramic, a synthetic resin such as of<br><br>
polyolefine, polyvinyl chloride or high-oil-absorptive polymer, non-<br>
woven fabric, and a porous natural material.<br>
No limitation is imposed on the shape or configuration of the<br>
active ingredient impregnated body either, except that the body must be<br>
disposed in the hollow space of the centrifugal fan. Illustrative for the<br>
shape and configuration are, for example, circular, semicircular, square<br>
and polygonal frames, and a toroidal hollow body.<br>
No limitation is imposed on the size or geometry of the active<br>
ingredient impregnated body either, except that the body must be read-<br>
ily disposed in that hollow space and that the body must not impair the<br>
fan to rotate.<br>
No limitation is imposed on the thickness or length of the ac-<br>
tive ingredient impregnated body either, which relates to the content of<br>
the active ingredient impregnant, except that it may be sized to meet<br>
with its aimed use. The body may even be designed to have its length in<br>
excess of the length of the hollow space.<br>
Also, as for loading the active ingredient impregnated body or<br>
mass, while in the form of embodiment described the housing 24 in<br>
which participate processed goods 25 as the active ingredient impreg-<br>
nated body are packed is shown to be inserted into the hollow space 21<br>
in the centrifugal fan 13 and to be fastened to the fan casing 21, such a<br>
housing 24 may be fastened directly to the apparatus main body portion<br>
1, e. g., by means of a clamping plate as separately prepared. It is also<br>
possible to provide the apparatus main body portion 1 with an opening<br>
for insertion (e. g., in a region of the air intake port 29 in the other side<br>
portion 3) so that the housing 24 may be inserted therethrough and then<br><br>
fastened so.<br>
Also, the fastening means is not limited to a machine nut or<br>
nuts but may adopt an adhesive or cladding means. It is preferable that<br>
any such means be selected according to the particular form of the ac-<br>
tive ingredient impregnated body designed for its intended use.<br>
Also, illustrative for the battery or cell 9 used to power driving<br>
the fan type blower 11 are, for example, a primary cell or battery such<br>
as an alkaline dry cell, a manganese dry cell, a button type cell, an air<br>
cell or lithium ion cell, and a secondary cell or battery such, as a nickel<br>
cadmium battery or a lithium ion cell.<br>
A suitable choice of a particular cell or battery may be made in<br>
conjunction with its kind (e. g., either alkaline or manganese, or unit 1<br>
or unit 2 type), its number and its manner of connection (parallel or<br>
series) in consideration of its use conditions and period, the kind of the<br>
motor and fan used.<br>
The fan type blower 11 for driving may also be powered by the<br>
commercial AC supply (e. g., with 100 volts). Then, it will become<br>
necessary to provide the apparatus internally or externally with an<br>
AC-DC converter.<br>
Also, a fan type chemical diffusing apparatus according to the<br>
present invention is not limited to a dedicated or exclusive apparatus as<br>
shown in Figs. 1 and 2 but may be applied to any home or office electri-<br>
cal appliance using a centrifugal fan as well, to provide it with the ca-<br>
pability of repelling and exterminating noxious or harmful insects, de-<br>
odorizing an offensive odor, and emanating fragrance or aroma.<br>
The present invention, if implemented into, e. g., a battery type<br><br>
portable apparatus that has no particular limitation on the place of<br>
installment or that can be used anywhere is found to be useful and ad-<br>
vantageous.<br>
Illustrative for the volatile chemical for use in the present in-<br>
vention are included, among a variety of chemicals, an insecticide, an<br>
insect repellent, an aromatic and a deodorant.<br>
The insecticides should preferably be pyrethroid insecticides of<br>
which at least one chemical selected from the group which consists of<br>
terallethrin, prallethrin, furamethrin, allethrin, and empenthrin may<br>
be used as particularly advantageous.<br>
For growth control (inhibiting) agents, at least one chemical<br>
may be used as preferred which is selected from the group consisting of<br>
pyriproxyfen, methoprene and hydroprene.<br>
Also, compounding an anti-oxidizing agent and/or an ultravio-<br>
let absorbing agent into the active ingredient impregnated body and/or<br>
compounding an ultraviolet absorbing agent into a casing for the active<br>
ingredient impregnated body will enable an implementation of the pre-<br>
sent invention to be used stably for a prolonged period of time. It also<br>
enables use in the outdoors.<br>
End point marking methods which are essential to the prepara-<br>
tion of a chemical include a method of using a lipophilic anthraquinone<br>
dye for the impregnated body if hydrophilic and utilizing the phe-<br>
nomena that the color of the dye if dissolved in the chemical is recogni-<br>
zable and that when the chemical is evaporated out the dye gets into the<br>
body to make its color unrecognizable. Also included is a method of<br>
utilizing a color changeable pigment made of a color changeable electron<br><br>
releasing organic compound and a desensitizer, or a color changeable<br>
electron releasing organic compound, a desensitizer and a color devel-<br>
oper. Further included is a method in which the rate of sublimation of a<br>
subliming agent is made substantially equal to the rate of volatilization<br>
of the chemical. While any one of these methods may be used singly, the<br>
use of a change in color and a subliming agent in combination will make<br>
one feel the use actually and thus would be preferred.<br>
The rate of sublimation can be adjusted at a value as required<br>
by adjusting the area of a vent opening that may be provided for a<br>
casing containing the subliming agent.<br>
Also for the active ingredients described, there is no limitation<br>
imposed in using the insecticides and/or rejectants (insect repellents)<br>
listed below, in any combination with a proportion as desired.<br>
For example, in killing insects, any one or more of a variety of<br>
volatile insecticides so far used may be utilized. Illustrative are pyre-<br>
throid insecticides, carbamate insecticides and organophosphorus in-<br>
secticides. Pyrethroid insecticides are known to be high in safety and<br>
have been used well, of which preferred examples are listed below, each<br>
given in the order of the general name, the chemical name and the par-<br>
enthesized trade name followed by the producer.<br>

According to the apparatus described of the present invention,<br>
having the fan 13 configured to provide in its bulk, volume and size a<br>
hollow space 21 adapted to accommodate an active ingredient impreg-<br>
nated body 23 only requires the apparatus body portion 1 to have a<br>
space therein just enough to accommodate the fan blower 11, and elimi-<br>
nates the conventional need to provide an extra space for separately<br>
accommodating the active ingredient impregnated body 23.<br>
This simplifies the apparatus body interior structurally and<br>
makes the apparatus compact and small sized.<br>
Also, eliminating the requirement to separately dispose the<br>
active ingredient impregnated body beside the fan blower in the body<br>
portion 1 of the apparatus, it enhances its design flexibility.<br>
Also, the fan is found not to reduce its durability and capable of<br>
retaining a sufficient amount of an active ingredient.<br>
According to the apparatus described of the present invention,<br>
the active ingredient impregnated body 23 not rotated with the fan 13 is<br>
kept not to increase the rotational resistance of the fan 13, and thus<br>
does not create a waste in its driving force.<br>
The apparatus described of the present invention is economical<br>
because it requires only the active ingredient impregnated body 23 to be<br>
exchanged while leaving the fan 13 intact.<br>
An explanation is next given in respect of a fan type debugging<br>
apparatus for repelling and exterminating noxious or harmful insects<br>
according to second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the debugging apparatus has a body<br>
portion 31 substantially in the form of a rectangular box, comprising an<br>
upper face plate 32, a lower face plate 33, a first pair of opposed side<br>
plates 34 and a second pair of side plates 35, defining and enclosing its<br>
interior therewith. A partition plate 36 is provided to subdivide with<br>
the side face plates 34 and 35, this interior into an upper and a lower<br>
space or compartment 37 and 38.<br>
The upper space 37 has a fan type blower 40 mounted therein<br>
together with an electric motor 39 for powering the same. The fan<br>
blower 40 comprises a fan 41 and a fan casing 42, the latter serving to<br>
accommodate and/or to protect the fan 41, and/or to rectify a wind cre-<br>
ated and/or to intensify the wind force. In the form of embodiment illus-<br>
trated, the fan 41 is constituted by a silocco fan with the fan casing 42<br>
having its air intake side in communication with an air intake port 43<br>
formed in the partition plate 36 and its outlet side in communication<br>
with an air discharge port 44 formed in one of the second pair of side<br>
face plates 35.<br>
The lower space 38 has a casing 45 for an impregnated body<br>
mounted removably therein as opposed to the air intake port 43.<br>
The impregnated body casing 45 is made of a material and/or<br>
has a shape that excels in air permeability to permit air to smoothly<br>
pass therethrough.<br>
The impregnated body casing 45 has an active ingredient im-<br>
pregnated body 46 placed therein for accommodation and/or protection<br>
thereby.<br>
At least a portion of the impregnated body casing 45 which con-<br>
tacts with the impregnated body 46 is made of plastic comprising at<br>
least one of polyester, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, ABS, polysty-<br>
rene, AS, methacrylate resin, polyvinyl alcohol, EVA, phenol resin, sili-<br>
cone resin, polyamide resin, polyacetal resin, polycarbonate resin and<br>
thermoplastic polyester resin.<br>
The lower space 38 also has a battery or cells 47 detachably<br>
mounted therein, the battery or cells 47 are for driving the motor 39.<br>
In operation, driving the fan 41 with the motor 39 causes air as<br>
indicated by the arrow a to be drawn into the fan casing 42 past the<br>
impregnated body casing 45, the impregnated body 46 and the intake<br>
port 43.<br>
Air drawn into the fan casing 41, creating a wind which is rec-<br>
tified and/or whose wind force is intensified thereby, is allowed to flow<br>
out through the outlet port 44 as indicated by the arrow b.<br>
This permits an active ingredient impregnated in the active<br>
ingredient impregnated body 46 to volatilize and then through the air<br>
outlet port 44 to diffuse into the atmosphere.<br><br>
In the form of embodiment of the present invention illustrated,<br>
for the purposes of convenience a value that may be termed as "wind<br>
force resistance value" R is established. In deriving a wind force resis-<br>
tance value, while it may ought to measure the wind (air) speed or air<br>
flow quantity direct, a method of measuring the amount of electric cur-<br>
rent consumption in the motor that varies as the air resistance of the<br>
active ingredient would give rise to less measurement error though it is<br>
indirect. Accordingly, the latter method is adopted here in the present<br>
invention.<br>
The fan type debugging apparatus described should preferably<br>
be provided with an impregnated body casing designed to accommodate<br>
and/or to protect an active ingredient impregnated body in considera-<br>
tion of performance and stability and in use safety.<br>
Also, the fan blower described should preferably be provided<br>
with a fan, a fan casing designed to accommodate and/or to protect the<br>
fan, and/or to rectify the wind of air an/or to intensify the wind force of<br>
air, and an electric motor.<br>
The active ingredient impregnated body should preferably have<br>
a shape or configuration which rather than being a honeycomb form<br>
having an air or gas rectifying function is a form of material that is<br>
large in effective area which is at least one material selected from the<br>
group that consists of a mass of granules, a mass of strips and a mass of<br>
strings, filaments or threads. It is also preferable from the standpoints<br>
of retention and/or release of the active ingredient that the particulate<br>
material forming the active ingredient impregnated body be composed of<br>
at least one material selected from the group which consists of a cellu-<br><br>
lose, a polymeric water absorptive agent, a polymeric oil absorptive<br>
agent and a gel.<br>
The active ingredient is preferably an insecticide or a growth<br>
control agent that is effective to one or more kinds of insecticides but is<br>
not harm to men and beasts.<br>
The insecticides should preferably be pyrethroid insecticides of<br>
which at least one chemical selected from the group which consists of<br>
terallethrin, prallethrin, furamethrin, allethrin, and empenthrin is<br>
particularly advantageous.<br>
For growth control (inhibiting) agents, at least one chemical is<br>
preferred which is selected from the group consisting of pyriproxyfen,<br>
methoprene and hydroprene.<br>
For the fan as a source that produces a wind force or power, use<br>
is preferably made of a silocco fan and/or axial fan configuration. If a<br>
silocco fan configuration is used, it is desirable that fan casing is used<br>
which is desired to bring winds together around the fan.<br>
In order to exhibit a maximum effect of repelling and extermi-<br>
nating noxious or harmful insects at a minimum energy, use is prefera-<br>
bly made of a power saving type motor having a current consumption of<br>
100 mA or less under no load conditions with an applied voltage of 1.5<br>
volts. Also, using a battery or cells as a power supply for such a motor<br>
enhances the serviceability of an apparatus according to the invention<br>
in the sense.that it does not choose a place for installment. The upper<br>
limit set at 100 mA or less for permissible current consumption is based<br>
on the assumption that a time period of at least 12 hours will be re-<br>
quired for use with a unit 3 type cell battery that is high in general-<br><br>
purpose properties.<br>
Also, compounding an anti-oxidizing agent and/or an ultravio-<br>
let absorbing agent into the active ingredient impregnated body and/or<br>
compounding an ultraviolet absorbing agent into a casing for the active<br>
ingredient impregnated body will enable an implementation of the pre-<br>
sent invention to be used stably for a prolonged period of time. It also<br>
enables use in the outdoors.<br>
End point marking methods which are essential to the prepara-<br>
tion of a chemical include a method of using a lipophilic anthraquinone<br>
dye for the impregnated body if hydrophilic and utilizing the phe-<br>
nomena that the color of the dye if dissolved in the chemical is recogni-<br>
zable and that when the chemical is evaporated out the dye gets into the<br>
body to make its color unrecognizable. Also included is a method of<br>
utilizing a color changeable pigment made of a color changeable electron<br>
releasing organic compound and a desensitizer, or a color changeable<br>
electron releasing organic compound, a desensitizer and a color devel-<br>
oper. Further included is a method in which the rate of sublimation of a<br>
subliming agent is made substantially equal to the rate of volatilization<br>
of the chemical. While any one of these methods may be used singly, the<br>
use of a change in color and a subliming agent in combination will make<br>
one feel the use actually and thus would be preferred.<br>
The rate of sublimation can be adjusted at a value as required<br>
by adjusting the area of a vent opening that may be provided for a<br>
casing containing the subliming agent.<br>
As a wind or winds created by the rotation of the fan driven by<br>
the motor, it is also desirable that air flow in the order of the air intake<br><br>
port, the active ingredient impregnated body, the fan, the fan casing<br>
and the air outlet port.<br>
Also for the active ingredients described, there is no limitation<br>
imposed in using the insecticides and/or rejectants (insect repellents)<br>
listed below, in any combination with a proportion as desired.<br>
For example, in killing insects, any one or more of a variety of<br>
volatile insecticides so far used may be utilized. Illustrative are pyre-<br>

Volatile oils including at least one selected from the above.<br>
In addition to an anti-oxidizing agent and an ultraviolet ab-<br>
sorbing agent for preventing degradation of the active ingredient de-<br>
scribed, there may be incorporated an inhibitor, depressor and/or retar-<br>
dant for adjusting the amount of volatilization of the active ingredient,<br>
a substance or substances having a function or functions of giving out<br>
fragrance, deodorizing and/or sterilizing as desired in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
Next, mention is made of specific examples.<br>
A fan type debugging apparatus as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 was<br>
used. As the active ingredient impregnated body, use was made of two<br>
impregnated masses of granules made of cellulose and having diameters<br>
of 4 mm and 2 mm, respectively [supplied by Rengo, K. K. under the<br>
trade name of Viscopar (spelled phonetically)], and an impregnated<br>
mass of strips made of paper cut into a size of 0.3 cm X 70 cm.<br>
Investigations were made of a relationship between the amount of im-<br>
pregnation or loading and the wind force resistance R values that these<br>
bodies were assumed to have as derived from the measured values of<br>
current consumption E2 of the motor. The results of the investigations<br>
are summarized in Table 1 below. Values of current consumption when<br>
the impregnated bodies were unused are shown as El.<br>
Investigations were also conducted of extents of the knock-<br>
down efficacy of these bodies impregnated with an active ingredient for<br>
common house mosquitoes and house flies and had results which are<br>
also included as efficaciousness in Table 1.<br><br>
Criterion used for the efficaciousness is as shown in Table 2<br>
below. Efficaciousness tests were carried out by leaving an approxi-<br>
mately 100 number of sample insects free in a 8.5 straw mat size(14.0<br>
m2) living room, and counting the number of insects knocked down with<br>
elapse of time from the commencement of volatilization of the active<br>
ingredient . The test results are indicated in KT50 values calculated by<br>
Bliss' probit method. For the active ingredient, use was made of teralle-<br>
thrin in an amount of loading of 300 mg for one specimen. The criterion<br>
for efficaciousness was adopted with reference to results of test likewise<br>
done for a heat vaporization liquid agent or a mosquito-repellent incen-<br>
The fan type debugging apparatus used in the above mentioned<br>
investigations and tests had the fan 41 made as a silocco fan directly<br>
connected to an electric motor 39 (supplied by Mabuchi Motor Co., Ltd.<br>
under the product name RF-330TK-07800) having a current consump-<br>
tion of 4 mA under no load conditions with an applied voltage 1.5 volts,<br>
the fan also having a fan casing 42 so disposed as to surround the fan 41.<br>
The casing 45 for accommodating an active ingredient impregnated body<br>
or mass was disposed on the side of the air intake port 43 to the fan 41.<br>
For the battery 47, two unit 3 type alkaline dry cells connected in series<br>
are used.<br>
From the results of the investigations and tests mentioned<br>
above, it has been determined that if the wind force resistance R of the<br>
active ingredient impregnated body or mass 46, namely the proportion<br>
of the motor current consumption E2 when the active ingredient im-<br>
pregnated mass 46 is loaded to the motor current consumption El when<br>
the active ingredient impregnated mass 46 is unused (R = 100 -<br>
E2 / El X 100) is less than 5 % or not less than 26 %, enough debug-<br>
ging efficacy is not obtainable. However, when that proportion lies in a<br>
range of 5 to 25 %, it has been found that enough debugging efficacy can<br>
be obtained.<br>
The present invention enables a motor driving energy to be<br>
efficiently utilized to volatilize a plenty of an active ingredient, and<br>
provides volatilization of a maximum amount of the active ingredient<br>
and thus a maximum extent of vermin or insect damage prevention at a<br>
minimum amount of input energy.<br>
The present invention provides volatilizing a plenty amount of<br>
an active ingredient by using an active ingredient impregnated body or<br>
mass that is large in effective area and also by efficient utilization of a<br>
wind created.<br>
The present invention is advantageous from the standpoints of<br>
either or both of retention and volatilization of an active ingredient.<br>
The present invention provides reliably bringing about vermin<br>
or insect damage preventing effect to a maximum possible extent at a<br>
minimum of input energy.<br>
An explanation is next given in respect of a third form of em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, a fan type debugging apparatus for repel-<br>
ling and exterminating noxious or harmful insects according to the<br>
third form of embodiment is provided that comprises a body portion 51<br>
provided with a motor 52, a fan 53 for driving by the motor 52, an active<br>
ingredient impregnated body or mass 14 to be ventilated by the fan 53,<br>
and a battery 55 that serves as a power supply for the motor 52, wherein<br>
the battery, the motor and the fan constitutes a fan type blower for ven-<br>
tilating the active ingredient impregnated body or mass to volatilize an<br>
inactive ingredient therein.<br><br>
The battery 55 is exchangeable by taking off a cover 56.<br>
Such a fan type debugging apparatus was implemented by us-<br>
ing a multi-blade fan for the fan 53, a motor having a voltage applica-<br>
tion of 3.0 volts and a current consumption of 6 milli-amperes (made by<br>
Mabuchi Motor Co., Ltd. product RF-330TK) for the motor 52, two unit 3<br>
type alkaline dry cells in series for the battery 55, a particulate cellu-<br>
lose or a mass of cellulose particles for the active ingredient carrier<br>
body or mass 54, and terallethrin in an amount of 300 mg for the active<br>
ingredient for impregnation in the carrier mass 54.<br>
For experimentation, a fan type debugging apparatus so im-<br>
plemented was placed in a 8 straw mat size (size 13.2 m2) living room<br>
and used every day with a running time duration of 12 hours/day.<br>
As a result, the 45-th day the fan blower ran no longer, mean-<br>
ing that it had run for a real total of 480 hours, and in that period of<br>
running of the fan blower there had been detected no mosquito bite.<br>
The active ingredient carrier body or mass should preferably be<br>
configured in at least one form selected from the group which consists of<br>
a form of granules or particles, a form of lines or strips and a form of<br>
strings, filament or threads which all provide a large effective area. It<br>
should preferably be composed of at least one material selected from the<br>
group which consists of cellulose, polymeric water absorptive material,<br>
polymeric oil absorptive material and gel. Those selections are desir-<br>
able from the standpoint of either or both of retention and release of an<br>
active ingredient.<br>
For the active ingredient, preference is given of an insecticide<br>
or growth control agent which is not only efficacious to a noxious or<br><br>
harmful insect but is high in safety to men and beasts. Such insecticides<br>
are preferably pyrethroid insecticides of which terallethrin prallethrin,<br>
furamethrin, allethrin and empenthrin are particularly advantageous.<br>
Such particular pyrethroid insecticides may be used singly or in combi-<br>
nation.<br>
For growth control (inhibiting) agents, at least one chemical<br>
may be used as preferred which is selected from the group consisting of<br>
pyriproxyfen, methoprene and hydroprene.<br>
Also, compounding an anti-oxidizing agent and/or an ultravio-<br>
let absorbing agent into the active ingredient impregnated body and/or<br>
compounding an ultraviolet absorbing agent into a casing for the active<br>
ingredient impregnated body will enable an implementation of the pre-<br>
sent invention to be used stably for a prolonged period of time. It also<br>
enables use in the outdoors.<br>
End point marking methods which are essential to the prepara-<br>
tion of a chemical include a method of using a lipophilic anthraquinone<br>
dye for the impregnated body if hydrophilic and utilizing the phe-<br>
nomena that the color of the dye if dissolved in the chemical is recogni-<br>
zable and that when the chemical is evaporated out the dye gets into the<br>
body to make its color unrecognizable. Also included is a method of<br>
utilizing a color changeable pigment made of a color changeable electron<br>
releasing organic compound and a desensitizer, or a color changeable<br>
electron releasing organic compound, a desensitizer and a color devel-<br>
oper. Further included is a method in which the rate of sublimation of a<br>
subliming agent is made substantially equal to the rate of volatilization<br>
of the chemical. While any one of these methods may be used singly, the<br><br>
use of a change in color and a subliming agent in combination will make<br>
one feel the use actually and thus would be preferred.<br>
The rate of sublimation can be adjusted at a value as required<br>
by adjusting the area of a vent opening that may be provided for a<br>
casing containing the subliming agent.<br>
Also for the active ingredients described, there is no limitation<br>
imposed in using the insecticides and/or rejectants (insect repellents)<br>
listed below, in any combination with a proportion as desired.<br>
For example, in killing insects, any one or more of a variety of<br>
volatile insecticides so far used may be utilized. Illustrative are pyre-<br>
throid insecticides, carbamate insecticides and organophosphorus in-<br>
secticides. Pyrethroid insecticides are known to be high in safety and<br>
have been used well. Specific examples of the pyrethroid insecticides,<br>
the organophosphorus insecticides the oxadiazol insecticides and chloro<br>
nicotine insecticides have been listed hereinbefore in connection with<br>
the first form of embodiment of the present invention. Also, specific<br>
examples of growth control agent, specific examples of the repellent and<br>
its components, and specific examples of natural volatile oil and its<br>
components have been listed hereinbefore in connection with the second<br>
form of embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In addition to an anti-oxidizing agent and an ultraviolet ab-<br>
sorbing agent for preventing degradation of the active ingredient de-<br>
scribed, there may be incorporated an inhibitor, depressor and/or retar-<br>
dant for adjusting the amount of volatilization of the active ingredient,<br>
a substance or substances having a function or functions of giving out<br>
fragrance, deodorizing and/or sterilizing as desired in accordance with<br><br>
the present invention.<br>
For the fan 53 in the fan type blower for use in the present<br>
invention, use may, if air is to flow from the axial direction to the radial<br>
direction, be made of a centrifugal fan in which a centrifugal force is<br>
applied to impart an energy to the flow. If air is to flow in the axial<br>
direction, use may be made of an axial fan in which a lift force of the<br>
blade is used to impart energy to the flow.<br>
Illustrative of the centrifugal fan are, for example, a turbo fan,<br>
an airfoil fan, a limited load fan, a radial fan, a multi-blade fan and so<br>
on.<br>
Here, preferred are centrifugal funs and more preferred is a<br>
multi-blade fan.<br>
It is also preferable that a centrifugal fan as mentioned above<br>
be placed in a volute, spiral or scroll casing designed to bring together<br>
efficiently winds produced by rotating the fan and then to let them out.<br>
In designing the fan type blower made by the fan 53 mounted to<br>
the motor 52, it has been found it important that as the load which acts<br>
on the motor 52 the index of air resistance f of the fan be taken into<br>
account which is equal to motor current consumption I, with a motor<br>
loaded with the fan divided by motor current consumption Io with the<br>
motor unloaded, and that the relationship be made here: 1 
preferably 1 <c f></c>
The index of air resistance f represents the air resistance that<br>
a fan blade receives when the fan 53 rotates and is conveniently ex-<br>
pressed here by the ratio of current consumption of the motor 52 when it<br>
is loaded with the fan 53 to current consumption of the motor 52 when it<br><br>
is unloaded.<br>
As the index of air resistance f increases, the current consump-<br>
tion of the motor 52 loaded with the fan 53 increases. Thus, it has been<br>
found that increasing the index of air resistance f to 18 or more signifi-<br>
cantly reduces the hours in which the fan 53 can run without changing<br>
the battery.<br>
Also, increasing the index of air resistance f tends to increase<br>
the fan in size. And, increasing the index of air resistance f to 18 or<br>
more makes the apparatus body 51 excessively bulky and makes it in-<br>
convenient for use. For example, the apparatus will become unhandy.<br>
The fan 53 in size should advantageously have a diameter of 20<br>
to 100 mm, preferably 30 to 60 mm. With a diameter of 20 mm or less,<br>
the fan will be too small in diameter to efficiently send air. If it is of<br>
axial type, the fan with a diameter of 20 mm or less will have an area of<br>
a blade that is too small to give it enough lift force. Also, if it is of cen-<br>
trifugal type, the fan with a diameter of 20 mm or less will be too small<br>
in fan diameter to be given enough centrifugal force.<br>
Attempting to obtain enough air flow requires the fan to be<br>
rotated with an increased number of rotation. This increases motor cur-<br>
rent consumption and also requires a higher voltage to be applied. It<br>
leads to increasing the number of cells for use and makes the apparatus<br>
unsuitable in both total weight and cost.<br>
With a diameter of 100 mm or more, the apparatus 51 will be-<br>
come excessive bulky to the extent that it can no longer be a potable or<br>
handy debugging apparatus.<br>
The fan 53 in weight should advantageously range between 1.5<br><br>
and 8 g. With a weight of less than 1.5 g, the fan 53 will be unable to<br>
send air in a necessary and sufficient volume.<br>
With a weight in excess of 8 g, the fan 53 will become too heavy,<br>
bringing about the inconveniences that the motor 52 needs for too high a<br>
power for starting and must have an excessive current consumption.<br>
The motor 52 as mentioned before should advantageously be a<br>
motor of energy saving type that has a voltage application of 3 volts and<br>
that can be driven with a current consumption of 35 mA or less when it<br>
is unloaded.<br>
The motor 52 having a current consumption of 36 mA or more<br>
when it is unloaded significantly reduces the hours in which the fan<br>
type blower can run without changing the battery.<br>
For the battery 55, use may be made of one or more of general<br>
purpose cells commercially available, such as alkaline dry cells, man-<br>
ganese dry cells and so forth. As illustrative for practical applications<br>
of the invention are one unit 3 type manganese dry cell (with a cell ca-<br>
pacity of 1200 mA • hr), one unit 3 type alkaline dry cell (with a battery<br>
capacity of 2300 mA • hr), two unit 3 type alkaline dry cells (with a<br>
battery capacity of 4600 mA • hr), one unit 2 type alkaline cry cell (with<br>
battery capacity of 6900 mA • hr), one unit 1 type alkaline dry cell<br>
(with a battery capacity of 11500 mA • hr), two unit 2 type alkaline dry<br>
cells (with a battery capacity of 13800 mA • hr) and two unit 1 type<br>
alkaline dry cells (with a battery capacity of 23000 mA • hr).<br>
The battery capacity here represents a load (amount of current)<br>
which makes the "battery life" 1 hour under the assumption that the<br>
battery life is the time elapsed for a 1.5 volt battery (cell or cells) in<br><br>
voltage to drop to 0.9 volt. In other words, the battery capacity means<br>
the amount of electric current that makes the voltage of a 1.5 volt bat-<br>
tery (cell or cells) drop to 0.9 volt in an hour.<br>
While there are slight differences in indicating the battery ca-<br>
pacity, there do not affect the present invention, and the battery<br>
capacities shown above are illustrative only and are not intended to<br>
limit the present invention.<br>
Pre-establishing the index of air resistance f of the fan 53, the<br>
size of the fan 53, the weight of fan 53 and the current consumption Io of<br>
the motor 52 when it is unloaded each in the range described provides a<br>
debugging apparatus that is portable or handy. These parameters may<br>
be so pre-established in various combinations to give rise to such an<br>
apparatus with a varied time duration in which they can operate<br>
without changing the battery.<br>
Such a time duration, i. e., the hours in which a debugging ap-<br>
paratus as described can operate without changing the battery can be<br>
prolonged in accordance with the present invention by establishing the<br>
current consumption of the motor loaded with the fan so that the ratio<br>
of the operable time duration to the battery capacity has a value of not<br>
less than 5 %, preferably not less than 10 %, and more preferably not<br>
less than 20 %.<br>
For example, if the fan loaded motor current consumption is set<br>
at about 27.4 mA, the apparatus with a battery capacity of about 2300<br>
mA • hr can operate only for a total time duration of about 84 hours,<br>
making the ratio of the operable time duration to the battery capacity<br>
about 3.7 %.<br><br>
However, if the fan loaded motor current consumption is set at<br>
about 20 mA, the apparatus with the same battery capacity can operate<br>
for a total time duration of 115 hours, thus making the ratio 5 %.<br>
Assuming that the apparatus is used for 12 hours a day, it can<br>
be seen that the former with the ratio of 3.7 % allows it to be used for 7<br>
days only and the latter with the ratio of 5 % permits it to be used for 9<br>
days.<br>
Mention is next made of specific examples of the third form of<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
With the use of various types of the fan and motor in an appa-<br>
ratus as shown in Fig. 5, the time duration of the apparatus until it<br>
becomes inoperative was measure, however, without using the active<br>
ingredient impregnated body or mass 54. The test results are shown in<br>

1 with Comparative Test 1, it is seen that between those tests using the<br>
same battery capacity of 2300 mA . hr (corresponding to two unit 3 type<br>
alkaline cells connected in series) there is a difference in fan operating<br>
time as many as 24 hours. And, if the battery capacity is raised to 23000<br>
mA • hr (corresponding to two unit 1 type alkaline cells connected in<br>
parallel), the difference in fan operating time duration becomes as many<br>
as 220 hours, thus manifesting a significant economical difference.<br>
Comparison of Test No. 1 with Comparative Test 1 manifests even more<br>
the economical difference between the inventive apparatus and the pri-<br>
or art.<br>
Comparison of Test Nos. 3 and 4 with Comparative Test 2 has<br>
the same or similar results.<br>
Next, compare test results of Test No. 5 with those of Compara-<br>
tive Test 3. Comparative Test 3 used a current consumption of the motor<br>
unloaded and an index of air resistance of the fan each within the<br>
corresponding requirement of the present invention but, having the re-<br>
sult of a poor operating time duration, represents an example showing<br>
that economy is not attainable depending on a certain combination of<br>
them. Using a battery capacity of 2300 mA • hr (corresponding to two<br>
unit 3 type alkaline cells connected in series), it is seen that Test No. 5<br>
had a fan operating time duration longer than Comparative Test 3 by as<br>
many as 47 hours. And, if the battery capacity is raised to 23000 mA •<br>
hr (corresponding two unit 1 type alkaline cells connected in parallel),<br>
the difference in fan operating time duration becomes as many as 471<br>
hours.<br>
Comparison of Test No. 6 with Comparative Test 4 has the<br>
same or similar results.<br>
Next, compare the test results of Test No. 3 with those of Com-<br>
parative Test 5. These tests used the same fan index of air resistance<br>
(not meaning that they used the same fan). Comparative Test 5 had a<br>
current consumption of the motor unloaded that is outside of the range<br>
the present invention requires. Comparison of these tests makes the<br>
difference manifest.<br>
It should be noted that Comparative Test 6 which satisfied<br>
none of the requirements evidences uneconomicalness of the prior art.<br>
From the foregoing test results, it will be evident that satisfy-<br>
ing all of the requirements according to the present form of embodiment<br>
of the invention provides a prolonged fan operating time duration.<br>
A fan type debugging apparatus according to this form of the<br>
present invention allows a motor to be driven and thus a fan to send air<br>
to and ventilate a body or mass impregnated with an active ingredient,<br>
over a prolonged total number of hours without changing the battery,<br>
thereby permitting the active ingredient to volatilize over such an ex-<br>
tended time period without requiring a battery change.<br>
There is also provided a portable or handy debugging appara-<br>
tus for repelling and exterminating noxious or harmful insects.<br>
An explanation is next given in respect of a fourth form of em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, an apparatus according to the forth form of<br>
embodiment of the invention comprises an apparatus body or body por-<br>
tion 51 provided with an electric motor 52, a fan 53, a body or mass 54<br>
impregnated with an active ingredient and a battery 55.' The battery 55<br>
can be replaced for by putting a cover 56 out of place.<br>
The motor 52 and the fan 53 constitute a fan type blower which<br><br>
sends air to and ventilates the active ingredient impregnated body or<br>
mass 54 to volatilize the active ingredient.<br>
The apparatus body portion 51 also incorporates a current con-<br>
trol circuit unit 57 such as a timer that controls power to the motor 52.<br>
By manipulating an operating member 58 such as a dial provided there-<br>
for, the power control circuit unit 57 is designed to turn the energizing<br>
current to the motor 52 on and off alternately.<br>
For example, the operating member 58 as shown in Fig. 7 may<br>
have graduations 58a and a knob or button 58b such that setting the<br>
button 58b to a given graduation 58a establishes a particular current on<br>
and off time as desired.<br>
The current control circuit unit 57 may have an operating and a<br>
halting time period pre-established therein so that with a power switch<br>
turned on, the motor 52 may be driven for the pre-established operating<br>
time period and may be halted for the pre-established halting time<br>
period with the cycle repeated.<br>
The operating and halting time periods have the following rela-<br>
tionship.<br>
The halting time period is here defined as a time period that in<br>
the length of time is not greater than 9 (nine) times as long as the op-<br>
erating time period and in which the amount of electric current<br>
(quantity of electricity) not lost is greater than the amount of electric<br>
current (quantity of electricity) which is consumed when the motor<br>
commences to be driven and which is in excess of a stable electric cur-<br>
rent that appears thereafter.<br>
Mention is made more specifically of the halting time period.<br><br>
The electric current rises to a value I, when the motor com-<br>
mences to be driven. A lower stable value of electric current I2 appears<br>
with a certain lapse of time t0 after the current begins to flow.<br>
The amount of electric current (quantity of electricity) S1 that<br>
is consumed after the motor starts to be driven and within the lapse of<br>
time t0 until the current becomes stable is greater than the amount of<br>
electric current (quantity of electricity) S2 that is consumed within the<br>
same length of time t0 after the current becomes stable. And, there is an<br>
excess current consumption (consumed quantity of electricity): S1-S2.<br>
If the motor is driven or operated for a time period t1 and halt-<br>
ed for a time period t2, then the amount of electric current (quantity of<br>
electricity) S3 not consumed during the halting time period t2 is ex-<br>
pressed by t2 X I2 (stable electric current magnitude).<br>
If the amount of electric current (quantity of electricity) S3<br>
that is not consumed in the halting time period t3 is less than the excess<br>
current consumption (consumed quantity of electricity) S1 - S2 that oc-<br>
curs when the motor starts to be driven, then it does not make sense to<br>
apply an electric current intermittently because the total current con-<br>
sumption (consumed quantity of electricity) when the current is applied<br>
intermittently becomes greater than the total current consumption<br>
(consumed quantity of electricity) when the current is applied continu-<br>
ously. Accordingly, the halting time period t2 must be a time period as<br>
mentioned above in which the amount of electric current (quantity of<br>
electricity) S3 not consumed in the time period t2 is greater than the<br>
excess current consumption (consumed quantity of electricity): S1 - S2<br>
when the motor starts to be driven.<br><br>
Such a halting time period t2 is expressed by the inequity: t2 &gt;<br>
(S1-S2) / I2.<br>
The operating time period and the halting time period can be<br>
pre-established, depending on purposes, in various manners, e. g., in<br>
units of days, hours, minutes and seconds. For example, the motor (fan)<br>
may periodically be operated or driven for one day and halted for one<br>
day, driven for 1 hour and halted for 2 hours, driven for 10 minutes and<br>
halted for 50 minutes, and/or operated for 30 seconds and halted for 20<br>
seconds.<br>
A halting time period of any length of time is sufficient unless<br>
it is less than 9 times as long as the operating or driving time period. It<br>
should, of course, be established with due consideration taken for room<br>
active ingredient richness at the halting time period, and a reduction in<br>
room active ingredient richness per unit of time.<br>
Also, the operating time period must be a time period that is<br>
efficacious and enough to exterminate a particular noxious or harmful<br>
insect or insects to be exterminated. For example, for female stegomyia<br>
mosquitoes it is a time period required for their 50 % to be knocked<br>
down or for them to refrain from taking bloodsucking behavior. For<br>
clothes moths it is a time period needed for their 50 % to be knocked<br>
down or for them to refrain from taking food harming behavior. The<br>
operating time period is determined with a combination of a particular<br>
noxious or harmful insect, a particular active ingredient and a particu-<br>
lar motor taken into account.<br>
For the fan in the fan type blower for use in the present inven-<br>
tion, use may, if air is to flow from the axial direction to the radial di-<br><br>
rection, be made of a centrifugal fan in which a centrifugal force is ap-<br>
plied to impart an energy to the flow. If air is to flow in the axial direc-<br>
tion, use may be made of an axial fan in which a lift force of the blade is<br>
used to impart energy to the flow.<br>
Illustrative of the centrifugal fan are, for example, a turbo fan,<br>
an airfoil fan, a limited load fan, a radial fan, a multi-blade fan and so<br>
on.<br>
Here, preferred are centrifugal funs and more preferred is a<br>
multi-blade fan.<br>
It is also preferable that a centrifugal fan as mentioned above<br>
be placed in a volute, spiral or scroll casing designed to bring together<br>
efficiently winds produced by rotating the fan and then to let them out.<br>
Also, illustrative for the battery or cell used to power driving<br>
the fan type blower are, for example, a primary cell or battery such as<br>
an alkaline dry cell, a manganese dry cell, a button type cell, an air cell<br>
or lithium ion cell, and a secondary cell or battery such as a nickel cad-<br>
mium battery or a lithium ion cell.<br>
A suitable choice of a particular cell or battery may be made in<br>
conjunction with its kind (e. g., either alkaline or manganese, or unit 1<br>
or unit 2 type), its number and its manner of connection (parallel or<br>
series) in consideration of its use conditions and period, the kind of the<br>
motor and fan used.<br>
The active ingredient impregnated body should preferably have<br>
a shape or configuration which besides a honeycomb form having an air<br>
or gas rectifying function is a form of material that is large in effective<br>
area which is at least one material selected from the group that consists<br><br>
of a mass of granules, a mass of strips and a mass of strings, filaments<br>
or threads. It is also preferable from the standpoints of retention and/or<br>
release of the active ingredient that the particulate material forming<br>
the active ingredient impregnated body be composed of at least one ma-<br>
terial selected from the group which consists of a cellulose, a polymeric<br>
water absorptive agent, a polymeric oil absorptive agent and a gel.<br>
The active ingredient is preferably an insecticide or a growth<br>
control agent that is effective to one or more kinds of insecticides but is<br>
not harm to men and beasts.<br>
The insecticides should preferably be pyrethroid insecticides of<br>
which at least one chemical selected from the group which consists of<br>
terallethrin, prallethrin, furamethrin, allethrin, and empenthrin is<br>
particularly advantageous.<br>
For growth control (inhibiting) agents, at least one chemical is<br>
preferred which is selected from the group consisting of pyriproxyfen,<br>
methoprene and hydroprene.<br>
Also, compounding an anti-oxidizing agent and/or an ultravio-<br>
let absorbing agent into the active ingredient impregnated body and/or<br>
compounding an ultraviolet absorbing agent into a casing for the active<br>
ingredient impregnated body will enable an implementation of the pre-<br>
sent invention to be used stably for a prolonged period of time. It also<br>
enables use in the outdoors.<br>
End point marking methods which are essential to the prepara-<br>
tion of a chemical include a method of using a lipophilic anthraquinone<br>
dye for the impregnated body if hydrophilic and utilizing the phe-<br>
nomena that the color of the dye if dissolved in the chemical is recogni-<br><br>
zable and that when the chemical is evaporated out the dye gets into the<br>
body to make its color unrecognizable. Also included is a method of<br>
utilizing a color changeable pigment made of a color changeable electron<br>
releasing organic compound and a desensitizer, or a color changeable<br>
electron releasing organic compound, a desensitizer and a color devel-<br>
oper. Further included is a method in which the rate of sublimation of a<br>
subliming agent is made substantially equal to the rate of volatilization<br>
of the chemical. While any one of these methods may be used singly, the<br>
use of a change in color and a subliming agent in combination will make<br>
one feel the use actually and thus would be preferred.<br>
The rate of sublimation can be adjusted at a value as required<br>
by adjusting the area of a vent opening that may be provided for a<br>
casing containing the subliming agent.<br>
Also for the active ingredients described, there is no limitation<br>
imposed in using the insecticides and/or rejectants (insect repellents)<br>
listed below, in any combination with a proportion as desired.<br>
For example, in killing insects, any one or more of a variety of<br>
volatile insecticides so far used may be utilized. Illustrative are pyre-<br>
throid insecticides, carbamate insecticides and organophosphorus in-<br>
secticides. Pyrethroid insecticides are known to be high in safety and<br>
have been used well. Specific examples of the pyrethroid insecticides,<br>
the organophosphorus insecticides the oxadiazol insecticides and chloro<br>
nicotine insecticides have been listed hereinbefore in connection with<br>
the first form of embodiment of the present invention.' Also, specific<br>
examples of growth control agent, specific examples of the repellent and<br>
its components, and specific examples of natural volatile oil and its<br><br>
components have been listed hereinbefore in connection with the second<br>
form of embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In addition to an anti-oxidizing agent and an ultraviolet ab-<br>
sorbing agent for preventing degradation of the active ingredient de-<br>
scribed, there may be incorporated an inhibitor, depressor and/or retar-<br>
dant for adjusting the amount of volatilization of the active ingredient,<br>
a substance or substances having a function or functions of giving out<br>
fragrance, deodorizing and/or sterilizing as desired in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
Mention is next made of tests and their results.<br>
Using a fan type debugging apparatus as shown in Fig. 6, tests<br>
were conducted as for bloodsucking by female stegomyia mosquitoes.<br>
The motor used in the fan type debugging apparatus was an<br>
motor of model RF-330TK made by Mabuchi Motor Co., Ltd.<br>
The battery consisted of two unit 3 type alkaline cells connect-<br>
ed in series.<br>
The chemical used was terallethrin and the impregnatable or<br>
carrier body was a mass of granules or particles made of a cellulose.<br>
Conditions of the tests were as follows:<br>
¦ The tests were carried out in 4.5, 8, 10 and 12 straw mat<br>
(7.4, 13.2, 16.5 and 19.8 m2) living rooms.<br>
¦ One of the four walls of each room had a ventilating window<br>
of 1 m X 1 m size which was left open in all the times.<br>
¦ A room temperature of 25 °C was held substantially con-<br>
stant.<br>
¦ The period of each of the tests was for half a year (180<br><br>
days).<br>
¦ Ones of which use periods are less than half a year was re-<br>
placed each time.<br>
¦ The days of measurement were 1st, 15th, 30th, 60th, and<br>
120th days.<br>
¦ In each of the rooms an air permeable cage was placed in<br>
which one (1) female mouse was loosed together with<br>
twenty (20) female stegomyia mosquitoes and its blood-<br>
sucking was checked after 24 hours.<br>
¦ The amount of charge of the chemical was set up for each<br>
number of straw mats (area).<br>
¦ The test results were marked with ® if the rate of knock-<br>
down is 90 % or more, with O if it is 50 % or more and with<br>
A if it is less than 50 %, and with X if there was blood-<br>
sucking.<br>
The results of the test in the 4.5 straw mat (7.4 m2) room are<br>
shown in Table 4 below.<br>
The results of the test in the 8 straw mat (13.2 m2) room are<br>
shown in Table 5 below.<br>
The results of the test in the 10 straw mat (16.5 in2) room are<br>
shown in Table 6 below.<br>
The results of the test in the 12 straw mat (19.8 m2) room are<br>
shown in Table 7 below.<br>
Table 7<br>
Results of Tests in a 12 Straw Mat Room<br>
Test Nos. 1 to 3 were longer in days of use than Comparative<br>
Test 1 in which electric current is applied continuously, but were able to<br>
achieve efficacy equivalent to that achieved by Comparative Test 1. Test<br>
No. 1 allowed days of use three times longer than the case of continuous<br>
use but had the efficacy substantially equal to that achievable by the<br>
latter. Test No. 2 allowed days of use six times longer than the case of<br>
continuous use and had no bloodsucking although it saw some drop in<br>
efficacy towards the end of the days. Test No. 3 failed to achieve an<br>
eminent knock-down, but were so efficacious enough to prevent blood<br>
sucking and allowed days of use 10 times longer than the case of con-<br>
tinuous use.<br>
Comparative Test 2 was long in days of use but had bloodsuck-<br>
ing by mosquitoes.<br>
Comparative Test 3 was enough in efficacy, but became short in<br>
days of use in spite of the fact that current is turned on and off, evi-<br>
dently because of the failure to satisfy the requirement: t2 &gt; (S1-<br>
S2) /I2.<br>
It has thus been shown that a fan type debugging apparatus<br>
according to the present invention if used in a living space achieves<br>
sufficient efficacy and maintains the same for a prolonged period of<br>
time.<br>
It will be appreciated that any of the second to fourth forms of<br>
embodiment of the present invention as described is applicable indi-<br>
vidually in a combination to the first form of embodiment of the inven-<br>
tion described.<br>
An explanation is next given in respect of a fifth form of em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
In order to resolve Problem (1) mentioned hereinbefore in the<br>
discussion of the Background Art, a chemical impregnated or carrier<br>
body (an active ingredient impregnated or carrier body) is made granu-<br>
lar or particulate, i. e., made in the form of a mass of particles or gran-<br>
ules, and these chemical impregnated or carrier particles or granules<br>
are themselves agitated. This has been found to make even the amounts<br>
of wind or air flows which the carriers receive, thereby preventing the<br>
amount of the chemical that remained in the chemical impregnated par-<br>
ticulate mass or body from varying depending on a local site in air flow<br>
direction. The effects have been demonstrated from the tests conducted<br>
of which methods and test results are stated below.<br>
A test apparatus was made on placing in a square wind blow<br>
outlet of 8 cm side an impregnated body receptacle made of a cylinder of<br>
8 cm inner diameter and 10 cm height and with nets put up to cover its<br>
top and bottom. The receptacle accommodated therein a mass of 2 grams<br>
i<br>
in weight of granules having a diameter of 4 mm and impregnated with<br>
a chemical of 300 milligrams in weight. Local variations were measured<br>
of the amount of the chemical that remained in that mass after a run of<br>
three (3) full (24 hours) days.<br>
As a comparative, local variation were also measured of the<br>
chemical that remained in a monolithic immobile body of honeycomb<br>
shape impregnated with the chemical placed in a same square wind blow<br>
outlet of 8 cm side. Test results are shown in Table 8 below.<br>
Numeric values in the table indicate amounts that remain for 100 of charge of the chemical. Each<br>
site of measurement is indicated by the distance from the blow outlet of the chemical impregnated<br>
mass or body.<br>
In Table 8, the numeric values each indicate an amount that remains<br>
for 100 of charge of the chemical. Each site of measurement is indicated by the<br>
distance from the blow outlet of the chemical impregnated granular mass or<br>
monolithic body.<br>
When use is made of a chemical impregnated monolithic body, it is<br>
seen that a chemical tends to volatilize more at sites closer to the fan blow out-<br>
let , and very little at sites remote from it where 90 % or more of the chemical<br>
tends to remain. In contrast, if use is made of a granular or particulate mass im-<br>
pregnated with the chemical, it is shown that there is substantially no difference<br>
in the amount than remains between locally different sites by virtue of the fact<br>
that the chemical impregnated granular or particulate mass while being con-<br>
stantly agitated acts to volatilize the chemical.<br>
Also, in order to resolve Problem (2) mentioned previously in the dis-<br>
cussion of the Background Art, a measure as mentioned below has been taken.<br>
Thus, the chemical impregnated body is made in the form of a mass of particles<br>
or granules whose number in a given space is increased. This makes smaller each<br>
individual chemical carrying particle or granules and in turn makes shorter the<br>
distance of travel of the chemical. As a result, the chemical as it volatilizes from<br>
the outer surfaces of the chemical impregnated particulate mass is more quickly<br>
replenished from the interior into those outer surfaces, thereby making the den-<br>
sity or concentration of the chemical in the mass even over its entire volume. A<br>
state of stabilized volatilization of the chemical is thus established. Further, it is<br>
also conceivable to add any of various kinds of solvents as a measure to promote<br>
evenness in distribution of the chemical on each individual chemical carrying<br>
particle or granule. This is found to be an effective measure for a chemical that<br>
is high in viscosity and low in mobility.<br>
Tests were also conducted to investigate patterns of volatilization of a<br>
chemical from a chemical impregnated particulate mass according to the present<br>
invention and a chemical impregnated monolithic body in the prior art. Each of<br>
these chemical carriers had an identical kind and amount of chemical impregnat-<br>
ed therein, and was run for fifteen (15) consecutive days. On each of the fifth,<br>
tenth and fifteenth day a measurement is made of the amount of the chemical that<br>
remained, from which the amount of volatilization of the chemical per unit time<br>
is estimated. Test results are shown in Table 9 below and also in the graph of Fig.<br>
From the test results shown in Table 9 above and the graph of<br>
Fig. 9, it is seen that in the monolithic body the rate of volatilization is<br>
lowered substantially proportionally from the start of running while in<br>
the particulate mass the amount of volatilization is stably maintained.<br>
This stabilized amount of volatilization over a prolonged time period is<br>
thought to be attributable to the fact that agitating or stirring the<br>
chemical carrier particles used to form the chemical impregnated mass<br>
makes even the concentration of the chemical over its entire volume and<br>
causes the chemical to flow or move dynamically on each individual car-<br>
rier particle. It is also thought to be attributable to the fact that a re-<br>
duction in weight as a result of volatilization of the chemical causes<br>
lowering the specific gravity of each of the mass and the impregnant<br>
chemical, which in turn increases the mobility of the chemical carrier<br>
particles; as a result, the increased mobility still maintains the amount<br>
of volatilization of the chemical substantially at a given level though<br>
the concentration of the chemical is lowered.<br>
Also, as for the effective rate of volatilization which is the pro-<br>
portion of the amount of chemical that is its initial charge amount mi-<br>
nus the amount that remains on the 15th day to its initial charge amount<br>
shown in Table 9, it is seen that the value of 89.46 % in the case of the<br>
particulate mass compared with the value of 72.58 in the case of<br>
monolithic body indicates that the particulate mass allows a highly<br>
efficient volatilization of the chemical.<br>
Further, in order to resolve Problem (3) mentioned hereinbe-<br>
fore in the discussion of the Background Art, a measure as stated below<br><br>
has been taken. Thus, effective utilization of energy is attained by<br>
causing chemical carrier particles as the chemical impregnated mass to<br>
receive both types of winds, i. e., winds from the fun and winds created<br>
when they are themselves rotated. This makes the total required sur-<br>
face area of the mass as a whole smaller than that of a conventional<br>
body, and reduces the loss of a wind force. Table 10 shows results of<br>
tests using a chemical impregnated particulate mass according to the<br>
present invention and a chemical impregnated monolithic body of hon-<br>
eycomb shape in the prior art in which both the particulate mass and<br>
monolithic body had an identical real volume, and a wind force was<br>
measured at each of sites 5 cm upper and 10 cm upper, respectively, of<br>
the chemical volatilizing outlet. The test results, here again, show that<br>
the particulate porous mass is more favorable than the monolithic po-<br>
rous body, by evidencing that the former produces a greater wind speed,<br>
and is lesser in the loss of wind force, than the latter.<br>
lowing: Thus, in order to maintain the amount of volatilization of a<br>
chemical over a prolonged time period by preventing local variation of<br>
volatilization in the chemical impregnated particulate mass while effec-<br>
tively utilizing wind force energy of the fan, it is desirable that the<br>
chemical carrier particles forming the particulate mass be stirred or<br>
agitated moderately or to a proper extent. To this end, it has been found<br>
that certain requirements as mentioned below be met.<br>
First, there is a requirement that relates to the configuration<br>
of the chemical carrier particles. It is desirable that the chemical carri-<br>
er particles have a shape that minimizes their mutual frictional drag or<br>
resistance leading to a loss of energy when they are agitated, i. e., a<br>
shape of particles such that the maximum area of contact of one particle<br>
with another be not in excess of one half of its total surface area. Spe-<br>
cifically, it is desirable that the chemical carrier particles be each in<br>
the form of a sphere which should be the shape that provides a minimum<br>
friction.<br>
A second requirement for the chemical carrier particles re-<br>
quires that the particles as a particulate mass have an appropriate set<br>
of abilities for the chemical, i. e., the ability to be loaded (impregnated)<br>
with the chemical, the ability to unload (release) the chemical, and the<br>
ability to promote the chemical to be made even quickly in the particu-<br>
late mass. The ability to be loaded with chemical depends on the real<br>
volume of the particulate mass, and the ability to unload the chemical<br>
and the ability to promote the chemical to be quickly made even depend<br>
on the density and thus the porosity of the particulate mass.<br>
The real volume of a particulate mass required for this aspect<br>
of the present invention can be derived from its porosity and apparent<br>
volume, and can be adjusted as desired in a range as mentioned below<br>
with the properties of the chemical such as its vapor pressure and vis-<br>
cosity taken into account. The real volume of a chemical carrier par-<br>
ticulate mass, as expressed by [apparent volume X (1- porosity /<br>
100)], should desirably range, for each particle, from 5 X 10"5 to 5 X<br>
105 mm3, preferably from 5 X 10-3 to 5 X 103 mm3, more preferably<br>
from 5 X 10-2 to 5 X 10-1 mm3. And, the amount of volatilization and<br>
the number of days in which efficacy is to last can be adjusted by the<br>
number of the chemical carrier particles and the concentration of the<br>
chemical to be carried thereby.<br>
A third requirement for the chemical carrier or impregnated<br>
particulate mass requires that it have a specific gravity in a range from<br>
0.005 to 0.5 when the air flow per unit time of the wind that passes<br>
through a receptacle which accommodates the chemical carrier par-<br>
ticulate mass ranges between 0.01 and 1.0 m3/min. If, however, a large<br>
fan having an air flow of 1.0 m3 / min or more is used, the chemical car-<br>
rier particulate mass can be used even if it has a specific gravity of 0.5<br>
or more.<br>
A fourth requirement may further be included that requires<br>
that either or both of the chemical carrier particulate mass or its recep-<br>
tacle be processed for an antistatic. For there is a possibility that an<br>
electrostatic if it develops may act to impede agitation between the<br>
chemical carrier particles or between the chemical carrier particles and<br>
their receptacles.<br>
In view of the foregoing, a chemical volatilizing apparatus is<br><br>
provided in accordance with the present invention, characterized in<br>
that a mass of a particulate material or particles is accommodated in a<br>
receptacle and is impregnated therein with a chemical to serve as a<br>
carrier therefor, the carrier particles being ventilated with winds from<br>
a fan and, while being agitated or stirred by wind forces, permitting the<br>
chemical impregnated in the particulate mass to volatilize.<br>
A chemical volatilizing apparatus according to the present in-<br>

Next, mention is made of usable materials for chemical carrier<br>
or impregnable particles or particulate mass. Illustrative are, for ex-<br>
ample, viscose, linter and inorganic substances such as calcium silicate.<br>
Alternatives may be porous bodies formed as row materials synthetic<br>
fibers such as of polypropylene and they may also be activated carbon.<br>
Among them, a plant derived material such as pulp, viscose or linter is<br>
most preferred as a raw material for chemical carrier or impregnable<br>
particle or particulate material in view of their specific gravity and<br>
chemical carrying capacity. Such materials which are commercially<br>
available include foamed cellulose beads made of pulp and viscose as<br>
main raw materials and supplied from Rengo, K. K. under the trade<br>
name of Viscopar (spelled phonetically).<br>
Promoting agitation of the chemical impregnated carrier parti-<br>
cles as mentioned above requires them to be light weighted being lower<br><br>
in specific gravity. Their receptacle is preferably made of plastic which<br>
is by nature electrically nonconductive, light weighted and also eco-<br>
nomical. However, plastic by frictional or rubbing contact tends to bear<br>
electrostatic charges and once charged to be hard to set them free.<br>
Therefore, it is possible for the chemical carrier particles which are<br>
lower in specific gravity, when stirred to impede the agitation and thus<br>
to become detrimental to energy efficiency. It is thus desirable to apply<br>
an anti-static treatment to the chemical carrier particles and preferably<br>
to their receptacle as well. A typical plastic anti-static treatment widely<br>
method is by an additive and to this end makes use of a surface active<br>
agent. In such methods, an anti-static agent may be coated on the sur-<br>
faces of a plastic (surface coating method) or alternatively be mixed into<br>
a plastic body (mixing method). Such agents are anionic, cationic, non-<br>
ionic or bipolar ionic active agents suitably adapted to the methods. A<br>
variety of chemicals having a surfactant as their principal ingredient<br>
are commercially available. Examples are "Sanstat AA", "Sanstat<br>
2012A" and "Sanstat 249" made by Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd. , and<br>
"Colcoat SP-2001" and "Colcoat SP-2002" featuring the transparency as<br>
nonductive coating" made by Colcoat, K. K (all spelled phonetically).<br>
For purposes of the present invention, it is also possible to use<br>
one or more of an anti-oxidizing agent, an ultraviolet absorbing agent,<br>
an aromatic, a deodorant and so forth to add a stability enhancing effi-<br>
cacy, synergistic efficacy and bells and whistles.<br>
Where it is desired for a chemical which is less volatile to be<br>
volatilized effectively, a method is conceivable which is designed to<br>
promote volatilization by heating the carrier particle receptacle, the fan<br><br>
itself or any peripheral member.<br>
Example 1<br>
On the side to the square blow outlet of 8 cm side of a DC<br>
brushless axial fan motor made by K. K. Siko Giken, there was placed a<br>
chemical containing cylindrical cartridge of 18 cm inner diameter and<br>
10 cm high with its top bottom covered with nets. The cartridge accom-<br>
modated therein a mass of 2 grams in weight of particles of 2 mm<br>
diameter constituted by foamed cellulose beads, impregnated with 300<br>
milligrams of prallethrin. The apparatus in operation was cyclically<br>
turned on and off with an on time of 12 hours and an off time of 12 hours<br>
and with the cycle repeated 30 times. Changes with time in the amount<br>
of volatilization measured of the chemical and are plotted in the graph<br>
shown in Fig. 10. The knock-down potency against common house<br>
mosquitoes also measured is shown in Table 4. It should be noted here<br>
that the amount of volatilization is indicated by a value per unit time<br>
(hour) calculated from the chemical residue that was extracted from the<br>
chemical impregnated particulate mass and measured at a given time<br>
interval. The potency or efficaciousness is represented by results of<br>
tests conducted in a 8 straw mat (13.2 m2) size closed space at a con-<br>
stant temperature of 25 °C .<br>
The apparatus used in this Example had a fan motor mounted<br>
therein and a construction in which as shown in Fig. 11 a body portion<br>
61 had a blow outlet (not indicated in the Figure) top-open on which a<br>
particulate mass accommodating receptacle 63 was mounted with its top<br>
and bottom covered with nets 62a and 62b. In operation, as the fan is<br>
rotated, winds blow up from the net 62b of the bottom of the receptacle<br><br>
63 to fluidize the particulate mass, indicated by discrete particles 64,<br>
accommodated therein and in the meantime to permit the chemical im-<br>
pregnated in the mass to volatilize and then to diffuse through the up-<br>
per net 62a into the outside together with the winds.<br>
Example 2<br>
Using the same apparatus, a test was conducted in which the<br>
particulate mass was again a mass of 2 grams in weight of foamed cel-<br>
lulose beads of 2 mm diameter which in this example was impregnated<br>
with 1200 milligrams of allethrin. Under the same test conditions as in<br>
Example 1, changes in the volume of volatilization of the chemical and<br>
the knock-down potency for common house mosquitoes were measured.<br>
Results of the test are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 11.<br>
Example 3<br>
Using the same apparatus, a test was conducted in which the<br>
particulate mass was a mass of 2 grams in weight of foamed cellulose<br>
beads of 4 mm diameter which in this example was impregnated with<br>
1000 milligrams of terallethrin. Under the same test conditions as in<br>
Example 1, changes in the volume of volatilization of the chemical and<br>
the knock-down potency for common house mosquitoes were measured.<br>
Results of the test are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 11.<br>
Example 4<br>
Using the same apparatus, a test was conducted in which the<br>
particulate mass was a mass of 2 grams in weight of foamed cellulose<br>
beads of 4 mm diameter which in this example was impregnated with<br>
2000 milligrams, of empenthrin. Under the same test conditions as in<br>
Example 1, changes in the volume of volatilization of the chemical and<br>
the knock-down potency for common house mosquitoes were measured.<br>
Results of the test are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 11.<br>
As mentioned previously, an apparatus according to the pre-<br>
sent invention permits a volatile chemical having insecticide, rejectant<br>
or growth control function to be diffused and dispersed stably by a wind<br>
force over a prolonged period of time for a variety of noxious or harmful<br>
insects, regardless of the vapor pressure the chemical possesses and the<br>
amount of volatilization the chemical is aimed for.<br>
