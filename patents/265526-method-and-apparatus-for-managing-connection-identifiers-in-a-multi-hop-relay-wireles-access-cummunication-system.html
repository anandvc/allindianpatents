METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING CONNECTION<br>
IDENTIFIERS IN A MULTI-HOP RELAY WIRELESS ACCESS<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates generally to a multi-hop relay cellular system. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for managing<br>
Connection Identifiers (CIDs) in a multi-hop relay Broadband Wireless Access (BWA)<br>
communication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Provisioning of services with different Quality of Service (QoS) levels at about<br>
l00Mbps to users is an active study area for a future-generation communication system<br>
called a 4 Generation (4G) communication system. Particularly, active research is on<br>
going in the area of mobility and high-speed, high-Quality of Service (QoS) services in<br>
BWA communication system such as Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and<br>
Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN). The Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a major driving force in this area as exemplified by<br>
802.16d and IEEE 802.16e.<br>
[3]	The IEEE 802.16d and IEEE 802.16e communication systems adopt Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing/Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access<br>
(OFDM/OFDMA) for physical channels. IEEE 802.16d considers only fixed<br>
Subscriber Stations (SSs), i.e. a single-cell structure with no regard to mobility of SSs.<br>
In contrast, IEEE 802.16e supports the SS' mobility to the IEEE 802.16d com-<br>
munication system. Hereinafter, a Mobile SS is called an MS.<br>
[4]	FIG. 1 illustrates the configuration of a typical BWA communication system.<br>
[5]	Referring to FIG. 1, the BWA communication system is configured in a multi-cell<br>
structure. Specifically, it is comprised of cells 100 and 150, BSs 110 and 140 for<br>
managing cells 100 and 150, respectively, and a plurality of MSs 111,113,130,151<br>
and 153. Signaling is carried out in OFDM/OFDMA between BSs 110 and 140 and<br>
MSs 111, 113, 130,151 and 153. Among MSs 111, 113,130,151 and 153, MS 130 is<br>
located in a cell boundary area between cells 100 and 150, i.e. in a handover region.<br>
When MS 130 moves to cell 150 managed by BS 140 during signal transmission/<br>
reception to/from BS 110, the serving BS of MS 130 changes from BS 110 to BS 140.<br>
[6]	In the above BWA communication system (i.e. IEEE 802.16), the ranging channel<br>
is used as an uplink random access channel. Initial ranging, periodic ranging, and<br>
bandwidth request ranging are performed through the ranging channel. Particularly, the<br><br>
initial ranging is performed during network entry or when system information is lost,<br>
with the aim to acquire uplink synchronization. In the initial ranging, a BS calculates<br>
the Round Trip Delay (RTD) between the BS and an MS by accurately measuring the<br>
time of arrival of a ranging signal from the MS and notifies the MS of a timing offset<br>
corresponding to the RTD. The BS also allocates a primary management CID and a<br>
basic CID to the ranging-requesting MS, for use in network entry and control message<br>
transmission/reception.<br>
[7]	In the initial ranging process in which the BS allocates the CIDs to the ranging-<br>
requesting MS, upon power-on, the MS first acquires system synchronization by<br>
receiving a downlink preamble from the BS. Being synchronized to system timing, the<br>
MS receives DL(Downlink)-MAP and Downlink Channel Descriptor (DCD) messages<br>
and acquires downlink channel characteristic information from the received messages.<br>
The MS then receives Uplink MAP (UL-MAP) and Uplink Channel Descriptor<br>
messages from the BS and acquires initial ranging opportunity information, uplink<br>
channel characteristic information, and initial ranging-associated parameters.<br>
[8]	Once the MS acquires minimum uplink and downlink channel information required<br>
for communicating with the BS in this way, it performs a basic access procedure, i.e.<br>
ranging to the BS based on the acquired information. That is, the MS sends a Ranging<br>
Request (RNG-REQ) message to the BS and the BS replies with a Ranging Response<br>
(RNG-RSP) message.<br>
[9]	Since this initial ranging process precedes registration to the BS, neither the BS nor<br>
the MS has connection-associated information. Therefore, the MS uses an initial<br>
ranging CID as its CID. The initial ranging CID is preset to a value (e.g. 0x0000),<br>
common to all MSs and thus it is not managed separately.<br>
[10]	Besides the initial ranging CID, the BWA communication system uses a plurality<br>
of other CIDs listed in Table 1 below.<br><br>
[11]	Referring to Table 1, the initial ranging CID is used for the MS to attempt an initial<br>
access to the BS during the initial ranging process, as stated before.<br>
[12]	The CIDs other than the initial ranging CID can be classified into two types<br><br>
according to their allocation processes and meanings: management CID and data<br>
transport CID.<br>
[13]	The basic CID and the primary management CID are management CIDs and the<br>
transport CID is a data transport CID. The management CIDs are allocated to the MS<br>
from the BS without complicated service negotiations or requirements during reg-<br>
istration since the management CIDs are basically allocated to the MS for registration<br>
to the BS irrespective of the service that the MS uses.<br>
[14]	The transport CID is allocated to the MS from the BS whenever the MS needs a<br>
new connection. The transport CID allocation takes place when specific service class<br>
requirements are fulfilled by negotiations. Now a description will be made of the<br>
functions of the CIDs illustrated in Table 1.<br>
[15]	The basic CID is MS-speciflc. As long as a connection is maintained between the<br>
BS and the MS, the basic CID can be used instead of the Media Access Control<br>
(MAC) address of the MS. After the initial ranging, the MS and the BS exchange<br>
control messages using the basic CID.<br>
[16]	The primary management CID is used during network entry. The network entry<br>
process, which starts with the initial ranging process, can be defined as a series of<br>
processes in which the MS registers its information with the BS, inclusive of MS reg-<br>
istration, service negotiation, and Internet Protocol (IP) address allocation. The BS<br>
identifies the MS by the primary management CID during the network entry process<br>
and significant control messages are sent/received using the primary management CID<br>
during communications between the BS and the MS. As with the basic CID, the<br>
primary management CID is kept for the MS as long as the connection is maintained<br>
between the MS and the BS.<br>
[17]	The transport CID is used for actual service data transmission/reception. Upon<br>
completion of the network entry, the MS requests a service to the BS and the BS<br>
allocates the transport CID to the MS for use in transmission/reception of service data.<br>
The connection of the service is identified by the transport CID as long as the service<br>
continues. Unlike the primary management CID and the basic CID, the transport CID<br>
is allocated on a service basis each time the MS requests a service. Hence, in the case<br>
where the MS requests a plurality of services simultaneously, such as voice call, video,<br>
and Internet browsing, the MS can be allocated a plurality of transport CIDs. On the<br>
other hand, the primary management CID and the basic CID are allocated to the MS on<br>
a one-to-one basis.<br>
[ 18]	The multicast CID is used to multicast the same data to a plurality of MSs simul-<br>
taneously. When the BS sends data using the multicast CED, the MSs to which the<br>
multicast CID was allocated receive the data, considering that the data are for them.<br>
[19]	A description will be made of messages involved in the initial ranging process.<br><br>
[20]	Table 2 below illustrates the structure of the RNG-REQ message sent from the MS<br>
to the BS.<br><br>
[21]	As noted from Table 2, the RNG-REQ message includes a plurality of Information<br>
Elements (IEs). Management Message Type is set to 4, indicating that the transmitted<br>
message is RNG-REQ. SS MAC Address is the MAC address of the MS, identifying<br>
the MS. Downlink Channel ID indicates the downlink channel on which the MS has<br>
received the UCD message providing uplink channel information. Requested<br>
Downlink Burst Profile is divided into bits 0 to 3 and bits 4 to 7. A Downlink Interval<br>
Usage Code (DIUC) is written in the bits 0 to 3 to request formats for transmission/<br>
reception of physical channel signals (e.g. a modulation type and an error correction<br>
type), and four Least Significant Bits (LSBs) of Configuration Change Count in the<br>
UCD message referred to in order to request ranging is filled in the bits 4 to 7. That is,<br>
the BS sends a predefined physical channel signal to the MS referring to the in-<br>
formation provided in the bits 0 to 3 of Requested Downlink Burst Profile. MAC<br>
Version indicates a MAC version that the MS will use. Ranging Anomalies indicates<br>
whether the MS transmits at a maximum power level or at a minimum power level to<br>
attempt an access to the BS. Besides, Ranging Anomalies can be used to carry a<br>
response to an instruction regarding the increase or decrease of transmit/reception<br>
power to correct the transmit/reception power and time information of the MS during<br>
the initial ranging. AAS broadcast capability indicates whether the MS can receive a<br>
broadcast message or not.<br>
[22]	Table 3 illustrates the structure of the RNG-RSP message sent from the BS to the<br>
MS.<br><br><br>
[23]	Referring to Table 3, the RNG-RSP message includes a plurality of IEs.<br>
Management Message Type is set to 5, indicating that the transmitted message is<br>
RNG-RSP. SS MAC Address is the MAC address of the MS to receive RNG-RSP.<br>
Downlink Operational Burst Profile is a response to the MS-requested downlink burst<br>
profile, i.e. a DIUC to be used in the BS. Primary Management CID and Basic CID are<br>
CIDs that are allocated to the MS and kept for connection management between the BS<br>
and the MS while the MS receives a service after ranging. Ranging Status (1 to 4) is a<br>
response to the MS's ranging request If Ranging Status is 1, this implies that the BS<br>
directs the MS to continue ranging. If Ranging Status is 2, this implies that the BS<br>
directs the MS to discontinue ranging. If Ranging Status is 3, this implies that the<br>
ranging is successful. If Ranging Status is 4, this implies that the BS directs the MS to<br>
retry ranging. Timing adjust provides information for correcting the timing of the MS<br>
and Power level adjust provides information for correcting the transmit/reception<br>
power of the MS. Downlink frequency override indicates the frequency of another<br>
channel on which the MS will attempt initial ranging, if Ranging Status is set to 2,<br>
indicating abort.<br>
[24]	As noted from Table 3, the MS is allocated the primary management CID and the<br><br>
basic CID during the initial ranging process.<br>
[25]	Since signaling is carried out between the BS and the MS via a direct link, a highly<br>
reliable radio communication link can be established between them in the typical BWA<br>
communication system illustrated in FIG. 1. However, due to the fixedness of the BS, a<br>
wireless network cannot be configured with flexibility. As a result, the BWA com-<br>
munication system is not effective in providing communication services under a radio<br>
environment experiencing fluctuating traffic distribution and great change in the<br>
number of required calls.<br>
[26]	This drawback may be overcome by applying a multi-hop relay data transmission<br>
scheme using fixed Relay Stations (RSs), mobile RSs, or general MSs to general<br>
cellular wireless communication systems such as the IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system.<br>
[27]	The multi-hop relay wireless communication system can rapidly reconfigure a<br>
network according to a changing communication environment and can enable efficient<br>
operation of the whole wireless network. It can expand cell coverage and increase<br>
system capacity. In the case where the channel status between the BS and the MS is<br>
poor, an RS is installed between them so that the resulting establishment of a multi-hop<br>
relay path through the RS renders the available radio channel to the MS better. With<br>
the use of the multi-hop relay scheme at a cell boundary where the channel status is<br>
poor, high-speed data channels become available and the cell coverage is expanded.<br>
[28]	The configuration of a multi-hop relay BWA communication system designed to<br>
expand the coverage area of the BS will be described below.<br>
[29]	FIG. 2 illustrates the configuration of a multi-hop relay BWA communication<br>
system designed to expand the coverage area of the BS.<br>
[30]	Referring to FIG. 2, the multi-hop relay BWA communication system includes a<br>
BS 210 for managing a cell 200, a plurality of MSs 211 and 212 within cell 200, a<br>
plurality of MSs 221,222 and 223 managed by BS 210 but located in an area 230<br>
outside cell 200, an RS 220 for providing a multi-hop relay path between BS 210 and<br>
MSs 221,222 and 223. Signaling is performed in OFDM/OFDMA among BS 200, RS<br>
220, and MSs 211, 212, 221, 222 and 223.<br>
[31]	Although MSs 211 and 212 within cell 200 and RS 220 can communicate directly<br>
with BS 210, direct communication is not available between BS 210 and MSs 221, 222<br>
and 223 outside cell 200. Therefore, RS 220 covering area 230 relays signals between<br>
BS 210 and MSs 211, 222 and 223. Thus MSs 221, 222 and 223 exchange signals with<br>
BS 210 via RS 220.<br>
[32]	However, individual transmission of a transport CID and data from the BS to each<br>
of MSs through the same RS requires as many management messages.<br>
[33]	Accordingly, a CID management apparatus and method are needed which reduces<br><br>
the management messages sent through the RS for data transmission to the MSs via the<br>
RS and thus saves bandwidth.<br>
[34]	That is, there is a need for a CID management apparatus and method that ef-<br>
ficiently manage data destined for the RS and data to be relayed to the MSs through the<br>
RS by use of a CID during communications between the BS and the RS in the multi-<br>
hop relay BWA communication system.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[35]	An aspect of the present invention is to address at least the problems and/or dis-<br>
advantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an<br>
aspect of of the present invention provides an apparatus and method for sending data<br>
destined for a plurality of MSs in one payload through an RS in a multi-hop relay<br>
BWA communication system.<br>
[36]	Another aspect of the present invention provides an apparatus and method for<br>
sending data destined for a plurality of MSs in one payload through an RS by use of a<br>
CID indicating inclusion of data with different destinations in one payload in a multi-<br>
hop relay BWA communication system.<br>
[37]	In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a data<br>
transmission method of a source in a multi-hop relay network, in which a CID of a<br>
destination of at least one packet is detected, it is determined from the CID if the<br>
destination is connected to an RS, a payload including at least one packet is generated,<br>
if the destination of the one packet is connected to the RS, a relay packet is generated<br>
by attaching a relay CID as a header to the payload, the relay CID indicating that the<br>
payload includes a packet for at least one destination, and the relay packet is sent.<br>
[38]	In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a CID<br>
management method of an RS in a multi-hop relay wireless access communication<br>
system, in which a CID of received data is detected, it is then determined whether the<br>
CID is a relay CID. The relay CID indicates that a payload includes a packet destined<br>
for at least one destination; data is separated from the payload of the received data with<br>
respect to each CID included in the payload. If the CID of the received data is the relay<br>
CID, CIDs of the separated data are checked, and if the checked CIDs include a CID of<br>
a destination to which the RS is to relay, separated data corresponding to the CID of<br>
the destination is sent to the destination.<br>

header to the payload, the relay CID indicating that the payload includes a packet for at<br>
least one destination, and sends the relay packet to the RS.<br>
[40]	In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an RS<br>
in a multi-hop relay wireless access communication system. In the RS, a CID manager<br>
detects the CID of received data, determines if the CID is a relay CID, the relay CID<br>
indicating that a payload includes a packet destined for at least one destination. The<br>
CID manager separates data from the payload of the received data with respect to each<br>
CID included in the payload. If the CID of the received data is the relay CID, the CID<br>
manager checks the CIDs of the separated data, and if the checked CIDs include a CID<br>
of a destination to which the RS is to relay, sends the separated data corresponding to<br>
the CID of the destination to the destination.<br>

Best Mode<br>
[48]	The matters such as detailed construction and elements defined in the description<br>
are provided to assist in a better understanding of the invention. Accordingly, those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various changes and modifications of the<br>
embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the scope and spirit<br>
of the invention. Also, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are<br>
omitted for clarity and conciseness.<br>
[49]	As an example, a multi-hop relay BWA communication system operates in OFDM/<br>
OFDMA. As a physical channel signal is delivered on a plurality of subcarriers, the<br><br>
OFDM/OFDMA operation enables high-speed data transmission. Also, the MS's<br>
mobility is supported because the multi-hop relay BWA communication system is<br>
configured in a multi-cell structure.<br>
[50]	While the following description is made in the context of the BWA communication<br>
system, it is to be clearly understood that the present invention is applicable to any<br>
multi-hop relay cellular communication system.<br>
[51]	Referring to FIG. 3, the frame includes a relay CID 313 and payload 315.The<br>
following description is made with the understanding that BS 210 sends packets to<br>
MSs 221, 222 and 223 outside cell 200 via RS 220 in FIG. 2.<br>
[52]	Relay CID 313 has been allocated to the RS by the BS, for use in indicating that<br>
payload 315 contains data destined from the BS to a plurality of MSs.<br>
[53]	Payload 315 includes transport CIDs identifying the MSs and data to be sent to the<br>
MSs. For example, CID 100 denoted by reference numeral 300 is the transport CID of<br>
a first MS and DATA 303 is data to be sent to the first MS. CID 101 denoted by<br>
reference numeral 305 is the transport CID of a second MS and DATA 307 is data to<br>
be sent to the second MS. CID 102 denoted by reference numeral 309 is the transport<br>
CID of a third MS and DATA 311 is data to be sent to the third MS.<br>
[54]	If the BS sends three data to the three MSs in the BWA communication system as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3, it sends them to the RS in one payload. In relation to the payload,<br>
the BS sends one management message to the RS, thus saving bandwidth, as compared<br>
to sending as many management messages as individual transmissions of the three<br>
data. That is, one management message suffices for the transmission of the three data<br>
in the single payload, resulting in bandwidth saving.<br>
[55]	The RS is allocated the relay CID from the BS during network entry or Dynamic<br>
Service Addition (DSA) in the BWA communication system.<br>
[56]	In accordance with the present invention illustrated in FIG. 4, the RS can be<br>
allocated a relay CID during registration in the network entry process. In accordance<br>
with an alternative embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 5, the RS<br>
can be allocated a relay CID during basic capabilities negotiation in the network entry<br>
process.<br>
[57]	Referring to FIG. 4, the RS sends a Registration Request (REG-REQ) message to<br>
the BS, requesting registration of relay capability in step 411. By the REG-REQ<br>
message, the RS may send a parameter or Type, Length, Value (TLV) indicating that it<br>
will support the relay capability and request allocation of the relay CID.<br>
[58]	In step 412, the BS replies to the RS with a Registration-Response (REG-RSP)<br>
message confirming the support of the relay capability. At the same time, the BS may<br>
allocate the relay CID to the RS.<br>
[59]	Referring to FIG. 5, the RS requests support of relay capability to the BS when it<br><br>
negotiates about basic capabilities by sending a Subscriber Basic Capability (SBC)<br>
Request (SBR-REQ) message in step 413.<br>
[60]	The BS confirms the support of the relay capability and allocates the relay CID to<br>
the RS by an SBC Response (SBC-RSP) message in step 414.<br>
[61]	In this way, when the RS requests the support of the relay capability to the BS by<br>
the SBC-REQ message during the basic capabilities negotiation, the BS confirms or<br>
rejects the support of the relay capability by the SBC-RSP message. If the BS confirms<br>
the relay capability support, it may allocate the relay CID to the RS.<br>
[62]	In one embodiment, the BS can manage a CID table by adding the relay CID to the<br>
existing Table 1, as follows.<br><br>
[63]	Referring to Table 4, the initial ranging CID is used for the RS to attempt an initial<br>
access to the BS during an initial ranging process. The basic CID is a CID specific to<br>
the RS, allocated from the BS. The primary management CID is used during network<br>
entry. The relay CID indicates inclusion of data destined for a plurality of MSs in one<br>
payload. The transport CID is used for transmission/reception of actual service data.<br>
The multicast CID is used to multicast the same data to a plurality of MSs simul-<br>
taneously.<br>
[64]	In other embodiment, the BS can choose the relay CID from other CEDs such as the<br>
transport CID or Multicast CED in the existing Table 1.<br>
[65]	It has been described above that the RS is allocated the relay CID from the BS<br>
during the REG-REQ/RSP process or the SBC-RREQ/RSP process.<br>
[66]	Referring to FIG. 6, the RS requests a connection setup for new data transmission<br>
to the BS by a DSA Request (DSA-REQ) message in step 511. At the same time, the<br>
RS requests allocation of the relay CED to the BS by the DSA-REQ message. Inde-<br>
pendently of the process in which the RS requests the relay capability support to the<br>
BS and the BS confirms the relay capability support, the RS is allocated the relay CED<br>
instead of a transport CED during a DSA process in which typically, the transport CED<br>
is allocated. The DSA process is for initiating a service request to the BS for data com-<br><br>
munication after the registration of the RS with the BS.<br>
[67]	In step 512, the BS sends, for example, a DSx Received (DSX-RVD) message to<br>
the RS informing it that it has received the DSA-REQ message.<br>
[68]	The BS then sends a DSA Response (DSA-RSP) message in response to the DSA-<br>
REQ message in step 513. The DSA RSP message contains the relay CID allocated to<br>
the RS.<br>
[69]	Upon receipt of the DSA-RSP message, the RS detects the relay CID and ac-<br>
knowledges the DSA-RSP message to the BS by a DSA Acknowledgement<br>
(DSA-ACK) message in step 514.<br>
[70]	Referring to FIG. 7, the BS forms the first packet by assembling downlink data in<br>
step 601. The data assembly is performed on an MS-by-MS basis.<br>
[71]	The BS checks the CID of the MS to receive the first packet in step 602, locates the<br>
MS in step 603, and determines if the MS is connected to any RS in step 604.<br>
[72]	If the MS is not connected to any RS, the BS sends the first packet to the MS in<br>
step 609.<br>
[73]	On the other hand, if the MS is connected to an RS, the BS identifies the RS to<br>
receive the first packet, i.e. the RS connected to the MS in step 605.<br>
[74]	The BS then determines if there is any other packet to be sent through the RS. The<br>
BS checks the presence of such packets until no packets remain to be sent through the<br>
RS. This operation involves steps 601 to 605 in which the BS detects the CIDs of MSs<br>
and identifies RSs connected to the MSs to receive the packets.<br>
[75]	In the presence of a plurality of packets to be sent to the RS, the BS combines the<br>
packets in one payload in step 607. For example, the payload is formed by combining<br>
data packets with the CIDs of MSs in their headers, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[76]	The BS attaches a header with the relay CID of the RS to the payload in step 608<br>
and sends the payload with the relay CID to the RS in step 609.<br>
[77]	In the case where data for a plurality of MSs are combined in one payload, a<br>
plurality of payloads may be formed each including data for an MS depending on the<br>
size of a frame sent from the BS to the RS.<br>
[78]	The relay CID may be a management CID allocated to the RS for communicating<br>
with the BS during registration, or a data transport CID allocated to the RS by the BS<br>
on request when needed. The RS is an infrastructure RS which is fixed or a client RS<br>
which is an MS acting as an RS.<br>
[79]	Referring to FIG. 8, upon receipt of data from the BS in step 701, the RS detects<br>
the CID of the data in step 702.<br>
[80]	In step 703, the RS determines whether the CID is its relay CID. If the CID is not<br>
the relay CID, the RS processes the data in step 709.<br>
[81]	On the contrary, if the CID is the relay CID, the RS detects the payload of the data<br><br>
in step 704 and separates data on a CID basis in step 705. The RS checks the CIDs of<br>
the separated data in step 706 and determines whether the CIDs are for MSs to which<br>
the RS is to relay data in step 707.<br>
[82]	For CIDs identifying MSs connected to the RS, the RS sends data with the CIDs<br>
set in their headers to the MSs in step 708.<br>
[83]	For a CID identifying the RS, the RS processes data with the CID in its header in<br>
step 709.<br>
[84]	The relay CID may be a management CID allocated to the RS for communicating<br>
with the BS during registration, or a data transport CID allocated to the RS by the BS<br>
on request when needed. The RS is an infrastructure RS which is fixed or a client RS<br>
which is an MS acting as an RS.<br>
[85]	In the above-described preferred embodiments of the present invention, the BS<br>
forms a payload with data to be sent to a plurality of MSs through the same RS and<br>
sends the payload to the RS. While not shown, however, the BS may include a BS CID<br>
manager for forming the payload and attaching the relay CID of the RS to the payload,<br>
for transmission to the RS.<br>
[86]	When receiving data including the relay CID, the RS separates data from the<br>
payload with respect to each CID included in the payload, for relaying the separated<br>
data to MSs. While not shown, however, the RS includes an RS CID manager for<br>
performing the data separation and for sending the separated data to the MSs if the<br>
CIDs of the separated data are for the MSs connected to the RS.<br>
[87]	In both the BS and the RS, the relay CID may be a management CID allocated to<br>
the RS for communicating with the BS during registration, or a data transport CID<br>
allocated to the RS by the BS on request when needed. The RS is an infrastructure RS<br>
which is fixed or a client RS which is an MS acting as an RS.<br>
[88]	While transmission of downlink data to be sent to a plurality of MSs via the same<br>
RS in one payload in the BWA communication system has been described in the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be clearly understood that the<br>
present invention is also applicable to the uplink.<br>
[89]	As described above, the present invention provides an apparatus and method for<br>
managing a relay CID when a BS communicates with a plurality of MSs via an RS in a<br>
multi-hop relay BWA communication system. The relay CID includes data destined<br>
for the RS. Data to be relayed through the RS can be managed separately. Therefore,<br>
required management messages are reduced, bandwidth is saved, and efficient commu-<br>
nications is enabled. Also, the BS and the RS can be configured to include the relay<br>
CID management apparatus and to perform the CID management method.<br>
[90]	While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled<br><br>
in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as further defined by the<br>
