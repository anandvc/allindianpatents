				<td>ANTENNA RADIATOR STRUCTURES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[1] Some active array apertures are under stringent weight and space constraints. For example, space-based arrays need to be delivered into space, and so there are stringent weight and space limitations imposed by the launch vehicle capabilities. Another exemplary application involves stowing an array for battlefield deployment, e.g., when such an array is carried by a weight-sensitive transport such as a soldier.<br>
[2] There is a need for an array aperture that is relatively light weight. It would be an advantage to provide an array aperture which can be stored in a relatively small space.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[3]      A foldable radiator assembly includes a thin, flexible dielectric substrate structure having a radiator conductor pattern formed therein. The flexible substrate structure is flexible for movement between a folded position and a deployed position. An excitation circuit excites the radiator conductor pattern with RF energy. [4]      Strips of the radiator assemblies can be used to form an array aperture.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[22]    In the following detailed description and in the several figures of the drawing, like elements are identified with like reference numerals.<br>
[23] Embodiments of a thin lightweight wide band radiating element and array structure are described. Exemplary applications for these embodiments include space based active array antennas. The radiator is foldable or reliable into a stored configuration for low volume storage within a rocket, for example, to increase the amount of antenna aperture that can be stored within a fixed volume, e.g. in the rocket prior to launch. When the antenna is unfolded or unrolled during deployment, the radiator may be configured to pop-up by itself to the proper operating shape and configuration, or to be deployed by a dielectric line. In other embodiments, the antenna can be fixed in position.<br>
[24]    In an exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, a radiator structure 20 includes radiator elements 30 similar to the flared dipole radiator described in U.S.<br>
5,428,364, but with a coplanar strip transmission line (CPS) 40 comprising conductor strips 40-1 and 40-2 feeding the flared dipole section (including flared dipole elements 30-1 and 30-2) that incorporates a 90 degree H-plane bend 42, forming a CPS to microstrip transition 50. In an exemplary embodiment, the 90 degree H-plane bend is realized using thin, e.g. less than 4 mils thick, flexible dielectric circuit material such as polyimide, liquid crystal polymer (LCP), polyester, or duroid to form the dielectric substrate 22. The flexible circuit board material is copper cladded with the shape of the flared dipole etched onto the copper, e.g., using conventional circuit fabrication processes. A flexible dielectric layer can optionally be formed on the flexible circuit board, e.g. to add stiffness or prevent shorting if needed for a particular application.<br>
[25] Incorporating the 90 degree H-plane bend 42 into the CPS transmission line<br>
portion 42 of the radiator 20 allows the radiator to be easily installed into a planar<br>
multilayer active array panel antenna assembly. FIGS. 2-5A illustrate an exemplary<br>
embodiment of an exemplary assembly 100. The radiator structure 20 is mounted<br>
onto a dielectric insulator layer 110 that is laid' over the antenna aperture<br>
groundplane structure 120. The groundplane structure 120 comprises a top<br>
groundplane layer 122, e.g. fabricated of a copper layer on a top surface of a top ..<br>
dielectric layer 126A. A lower groundplane layer 124 is formed on a bottom surface<br>
of a dielectric layer 126B. An air strip line layer 127 is assembled between the<br>
groundplane layers 122, 124 by z-axis anisotropically conductive adhesive layers<br>
125.	"~".<br>
[26] In this exemplary embodiment, the input of the coplanar strip transmission line section is orthogonally transitioned through the dielectric insulator layer 110 using plated through vias 90, 92 (FIG. 5) in the form of a 2-wire transmission line 94, as illustrated in FIG. 5A, which has a similar E-field configuration to that of the CPS transmission line. Thus, the strips 40-1, 40-2 of the CPS line are connected to respective conductive vias 90, 92. An opening or clearout 122A in the top groundplane Iayer122 allows the 2-wire transmission line above the groundplane to continue through and connect to a corresponding 2-wire transmission line including<br>
stripline conductor trace 130 (FIG. 4), which" then transitions orthogonally to the "balance" arms of a balun circuit, described below.<br>
[27]    A balun circuit 160 is used to transform single ended or "unbalanced" transmission  lines,  typically used for many RF devices,  to double ended or "balanced" transmission lines, as illustrated in FIG. 3.   Examples of unbalanced transmission lines include coaxial, microstrip, coplanar waveguide and stripline. Examples of balanced transmission lines include twin lead, 2-wire, coplanar strip and slotline. Balun circuits suitable for the purpose can be constructed by those skilled in the art.   Examples of balun circuits are described, for example, in "Electromagnetic Simulation of Some Common Balun Structures," K.V. Puglia,  IEEE Microwave Magazine, Application Notes/pages 56-61, September 2002; and "Review of Printed Marchand and Double Y Baluns: Characteristics and Application," Velimir Trifunovic and Branka Jokanovic, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. 42, No. 8, August 1994, pages 1454-1462.<br>
[28]    Physical and microwave interconnect attachment of the radiator 20 to the planar  antenna  assembly  comprising  the  dielectric  insulator  layer  110  and groundplane structure  120 is achieved using anisotropically conducting z-axis adhesive films  170,  172 (FIG. 4).    Exemplary suitable commercially available anisotropically conducting z-axis adhesive films include the adhesive films marketed by 3M as part number 7373 "and 9703.   Catchpads 90A, 112A, 1128, 128A at the ends of the plated vias, e.g. vias 90, 112, 128 of each board layer make contact with the  metal  particles  within the  adhesive  films  to  form   a   continuous  DC/RF interconnect from the coplanar strip transmission line on the radiator to the stripline conductor 130 to the balun circuit 160 underneath the groundplane. [29]    The flared dipole radiator is a combination of the flared notch radiator and dipole radiator, resulting in a wider operating frequency for a short height.  An RF signal is excited across the coplanar strip at the input port of the coplanar strip transmission line. The RF signal travels across the coplanar strip at the input port of the coplanar strip transmission line.  The RF signal travels along the coplanar strip across an ever increasing gap until it radiates into free space at the end of the<br>
element. The upper frequency band is limited only by the balun design. The flare dipole overcomes the lower frequency limits by having its outer conductor edge shaped in the form of a dipole. At the low frequency band edge, the flared dipole functions as a conventional dipole which is much shorter than the conventional flared notch radiator operating for the same frequency band., The 90 degree H-plane bend can be incorporated into both the conventional dipole and flared notch radiators with little impact on RF performance.<br>
[30]    A feature of one exemplary embodiment of the radiator is its ability to fold down for low volume storage and later spring ("pop-up") to the proper operating position during deployment.  In an exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 6A, for example, the 90 degree H-plane bend is realized using thin 2 mil thick flexible circuit board material such as polyimide, LCP, polyester or duroid. The 90 degree H-plane bend in the radiator acts both as a spring and a hinge.    Other angular deployed positions (i.e. other than 90 degree) of the radiator may also be used, depending on the requirements of a specific application. When folded at the H-plane bend, the radiator flexible material exerts an opposing force to return it to its original flat shape.   In an exemplary embodiment, slots.28 are formed in the flexible circuit board material at the hinge or fold line 25 to control the springback force, leaving areas 26 of the flexible circuit board material between the slots. Thin dielectric stiffener layers 48A, 48B are attached to the circuit board material, e.g. by non-conductive film adhesives, and provide stiffness and environmental protection. In an exemplary embodiment, the stjffener layers are 4 mil fiberglass reinforced circuit board material.  Gussets 24 are used to control the radiator H-plane bending to the desired 90 degree position while the thin stiffeners also control the radiator shape. The gussets in combination with the stiffener layers are thus used to shape the radiator to the proper operating configuration.<br>
[31J The embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 is of a panel 10 fabricated from a thin sheet of flexible circuit board material, on which a plurality of flared dipole radiators 30 have been formed. Although in this example there are four radiators 30<br><br>
shown, it will be appreciated that a panel with a greater number or a fewer number of radiators can be employed.<br>
[32] While a continuous sheet of flexible dielectric material can be used as a gusset to constrain the radiator strip, as depicted in FIG. 6, thin strips 24A-24D (FIG. 5) of flexible circuit material can also be used as gussets to position the radiator and thus eliminate potential excess material and weight. Further weight reduction can be achieved by using discrete pieces 110A, 11 OB, 110 C, 11OD of insulating dielectric material as a spacer layer beneath the radiators, and allowing air space between the pieces, instead of a continuous dielectric layer. The feature of using thin flexible circuit board material, gussets and stiffeners for the flared dipole radiators can also be applied to the conventional discrete flared notch and dipole radiators.<br>
[33] FIGS. 7A-7D illustrate the radiator panel 10 in several positrons. In FIG. 7A, the panel is in a folded position for storage. In FIG. 7B, the panel has started popping up, and is in a partially opened position. FIG. 7C shows the panel has moved further toward a fully deployed position. FIG. 7D shows the panel in a fully opened, deployed state, in an operating position. The stiffener and tie straps have controlled the movement of the radiator panel as it pops up from the folded position to the deployed, operating position.<br>
[34] FIG. 8 illustrates in an isometric cutaway view an embodiment of a panel array 180, which comprises an array of flared dipole radiator structures 20, fabricated on flexible dielectric substrates. The radiator structures 20 are supported on a laminated RF feed assembly 184, similar to the planar antenna assembly comprising the dielectric insulator layer 110 and groundplane structure 120 of FIG. 4, which includes balun circuits 186. Instead of folding, the radiator structures 20 in this embodiment are in fixed position relative to the feed assembly 184. An aperture dielectric foam encapsulant 188 encapsulates the radiator strips at edges of and between strips of the radiator assemblies to support the radiators feed structures 20 in a fixed operating position. Orthogonal strips of dielectric material can also be used to form an "egg-crate" structure to support the radiator feed structures 20 in a<br><br>
fixed operating position.   A dielectric radome structure 190 fits over the radiator structure.<br>
[35]    Another embodiment of a foldable antenna structure is shown in FIG. 9.  The radiator strip 200 is fabricated as a thin single layer flexible circuit 210 folded in the shape of a tear drop, as illustrated in the edge view of FIG. 9A.   The conductor pattern 220, located on the inside of the fold, is flared such that its width is widest at the radiator output while its conductor width narrows at the input port where the radiator interfaces to the RF feed or balun circuit. Likewise, the separation between the two conductor halves is widest at the radiator output while the separation narrows at the input port.   The folded arch 202 at the radiator output forms and sustains the radiator shape.  Since the folded arch comprises thin flexible dielectric circuit material, it has little or no impact on the RF performance of the radiator and is considered relatively invisible at microwave frequencies.   The combination of the physical tear drop shape by the flexible circuit board when folded along with the flared conductor shape thus results in the realization of a wide band TEM flared horn radiator.  The exemplary radiator structure 200 as illustrated in FIG. 9 has five TEM flared horn radiators 230 formed by the conductor pattern 220, although it will be understood that a greater number or a fewer number of horn radiators can be implemented in a folded radiator structure.<br>
[36] FIG. 9 further illustrates how a plurality of radiator strips 200 can be positioned in a side-by-side arrangement along the E-plane to provide an two dimensional aperture of TEM flared- horn radiators. This is shown in further detail in FIG. 11, showing three radiator strips 200' arranged along the E-plane, each having three horns 230 defined therein to provide a 3x3 array. Each horn radiator has an RF feed port 232' at the radiator base 234'.<br>
[37] In an exemplary embodiment, the radiator assembly is fabricated using thin (e.g. 
 <br>
[38]    One exemplary technique for feeding microwave energy into the radiator is illustrated in FIGS. 10A-10D.  A coaxial probe 212 excites a voltage across the two halves 230-1, 230-2 of the radiator at its input port 232. The coaxial outer conductor 214 is electrically connected to one half, e.g. 230-1 using either conductive epoxy or solder while the center pin penetrates through a clearance hole 236 in the one half 230-1 to contact the opposite half 230-2 of the radiator using either conductive epoxy or solder.    The back of the radiator is open circuited at its base to force the microwave signal to flow between the flare conductor patterns to the radiator output. Shielded strip line can also be used in place of the coaxial cable to excite a voltage potential across the two halves of the radiator. A groundplane 238 is positioned 1/4 8 below the base 234 of the radiator 230.   Alternative techniques for driving the radiator include a balun circuit as discussed above, e.g. with respect to FIGS. 3 and. 4.<br>
[39] As shown in FIGS. 9 and 11, a single tear drop fold of a large flexible circuit board can form several horn radiators along the H-plane. Note that this differs from conventional printed flared notch radiator strips which are formed along the E-plane. As noted above, a two dimensional array antenna aperture can be formed by arranging several radiator strips together along the E-plane as shown in FIGS. 9 and 11. This differs from the conventional printed flared notch radiator strips in which a two dimensional array antenna can be formed by arranging several radiator strips together along the H-plane.<br>
[40] If the sheet of flexible circuit board material is large enough, then a two dimensional array antenna aperture can be formed by incorporating several tear drop folds to realize several radiator strips along the E-plane on a single sheet. FIG. 12 illustrates an alternate embodiment of a TEM horn radiator structure 250 forming a 3x3 array of horn radiators. In this embodiment, the array is fabricated from a continuous sheet 260 of flexible circuit material, in contrast to each radiator strip being fabricated from a separate sheet of material as with the embodiment of FIG. 10. The sheet 260 has formed on an interior surface the conductor pattern 220" which defines the TEM horn radiators. The sheet is folded in such a way as to<br><br>
provide the folded dielectric arches 202" and the RF feed points 232" adjacent the radiator base 234".   A similar spacing between strip portions along the E-plane is provided by the folding arrangement.   The base 234" formed by the continuous sequential bending of horn radiator strip forms a flat/conformal surface that can mounted onto a multilayer print circuit board  panel assembly containing T/R modules, circulators, storage capacitors and microwave, digital and power manifolds. The combined aperture and panel assembly thus realizes a 2-D active array antenna.  An exemplary embodiment of active array antenna 300 is shown in FIG. 13, in which an array 310 of printed circuit flexible TEM horn radiators fabricated from a continuous sheet of flexible circuit material is mounted on a multilayer printed circuit board assembly 400, which functions as an RF feed, a digital and power manifold circuit. Circulators are embedded within the printed circuit assembly, and T/R modules and storage capacitors (not shown) can be mounted on the back of the assembly 400.<br>
[41] Because this exemplary embodiment of the radiator is constructed as a folded<br>
assembly, the radiator generates an E-plane polarization perpendicular to the plane<br>
of the base assembly 400.	"	~ ' "<br>
[42] Using thin flexible circuit material to form the radiator aperture allows the aperture to bend and flatten for low volume storage prior to deployment as illustrated in FIGS. 14A-14C, e.g. for a payload in a rocket. FIG. 14A shows the aperture 310 in a compressed, folded condition for storage. FIG. 14B shows the radiators of the aperture 310 bent to one side, and FIG. 14C shows the radiator of the aperture in a fully deployed, open state wherein the radiators are essentially perpendicular to the plane of the base. One method of controlling the radiator shape and position during the fold down and deployment is to attach fibers to the flexible circuits to push and pull the thin walls of the radiator as illustrated in FIG. 15. Here, fibers or lines 410 are bonded to the top of the arch of the radiator strips, and are fabricated of a dielectric material. The fibers 410 can be pushed/pulled to move the TEM horns from the array aperture edge, and thereby control the radiator position. Other fibers<br><br>
or lines 412 can be bonded to the top of the arch and to the radiator base to control the radiator shape once deployed.<br>
