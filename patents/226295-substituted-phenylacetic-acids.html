BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]    Diabetes mellitus, commonly called diabetes, refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose, referred to as hyperglycemia. See, e.g., LeRoith, D. et al., (eds.), DIABETES MELLITUS (Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA U.S.A. 1996), and all references cited therein. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes mellitus is estimated to affect approximately 6% of the world population. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature mortality due to an increased risk for microvascular and macrovascular diseases, including nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease. Therefore, control of glucose homeostasis is a critically important approach for the treatment of diabetes. [0005]    There are two major forms of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes (formerly referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes or EDDM); and Type 2 diabetes (formerly referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes or NIDDM).<br>
[0006]    Type I diabetes is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. This insulin deficiency is usually characterized by 0-cell destruction within the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, which usually leads to absolute insulin deficiency. Type 1 diabetes has two forms: Immune-Mediated Diabetes Mellitus, which results from a cellular mediated autoimmune destruction of the 0 cells of the pancreas;<br><br>
and Idiopathic Diabetes Mellitus, which refers to forms of the disease that have no known etiologies.<br>
[0007]    Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterized by insulin resistance accompanied by relative, rather than absolute, insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes can range from predominant insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to predominant insulin deficiency with some insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistant individuals, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect. When inadequate amounts of insulin are present to compensate for insulin resistance and adequately control glucose, a state of impaired glucose tolerance develops. In a significant number of individuals, insulin secretion declines further and the plasma glucose level rises, resulting in the clinical state of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes can be due to a profound resistance to insulin stimulating regulatory effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues: muscle, liver and adipose tissue. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secietion in liver. In Type 2 diabetes, free fatty acid levels are often elevated in obese and some non-obese patients and lipid oxidation is increased. [0008]    Premature development of atherosclerosis and increased rate of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases are characteristic features of patients with diabetes, with hyperlipidemia being an important precipitating factor for these diseases. [0009]    Hyperlipidemia is a condition generally characterized by an abnormal increase in serum lipids in the bloodstream and, as noted above, is an important risk factor in developing atherosclerosis and heart disease. For a review of disorders of lipid metabolism, see, e.g., Wilson, J. et al., (ed.), Disorders of Lipid Metabolism, Chapter 23, Textbook of Endocrinology, 9lh Edition, (W.B. Sanders Company, Philadelphia, PA U.S.A. 1998; this reference and all references cited therein are herein incorated by reference). Serum lipoproteins are the carriers for lipids in the circulation. They are classified according to their density, chylomicrons; very low -density lipoproteins (VLDL); intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL); low density lipoproteins (LDL); and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Hyperlipidemia is usually classified as primary or secondary hyperlipidemia. Primary hyperlipidemia is generally caused by genetic defects, while secondary hyperlipidemia is generally caused by other factors, such as various disease states, drugs, and dietary factors. Alternatively, hyperlipidemia can result from both a combination of primary and secondary<br><br>
causes of hyperlipidemia. Elevated cholesterol levels are associated with a number of disease states, including coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, carotid artery disease, strokes, cerebral arteriosclerosis, and xanthoma.<br>
[0010]    Dyslipidemia, or abnormal levels of lipoproteins in blood plasma, is a frequent occurrence among diabetics, and has been shown to be one of the main contributors to the increased incidence of coronary events and deaths among diabetic subjects (see, e.g., Joslin, E. Ann. Chim. Med. (1927) 5: 1061-1079). Epidemiological studies since then have confirmed the association and have shown a several-fold increase in coronary deaths among diabetic subjects when compared with nondiabetic subjects (see, e.g., Garcia, M. J. et al., Diabetes (1974) 23: 105-11 (1974); and Laakso, M. and Lehto, S., Diabetes Reviews (1997) 5(4): 294-315). Several lipoprotein abnormalities have been described among diabetic subjects (Howard B., et al., Artherosclcrosis (1978) 30: 153-162).<br>
[0011 j    What is needed in the art are new compounds and methods useful for the treatment of insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hyperuricemia. The present invention fulfills this and other needs by providing such compounds, compositions and methods for alleviating insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hyperuricemia.<br>

[0047]    For each of the definitions above, the term "di-alkylamino" refers to an amino<br>
moiety bearing two alkyl groups that can be the same, or different.<br>
[0048]    As used herein, the term "carboxylic acid surrogate" refers to those moieties that are<br>
used as surrogates for a carboxylic acid moiety. Such groups are generally known to one of<br>
skill in the art (see, for example, THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY; Wermuth, C.G.,<br>
ed., Academic Press, New York, 1996, page 203). Suitable isosteres or surrogates include -C(O)NHSO2R wherein R can be alkyl, haloalkyl, heteroalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, aryloxy, alkylamino, haloalkylamino, dialkylamino, dihaloalkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, arakylamino, diarakylamino or other groups to provide an overall acidic character to the moiety; sulfonic acids; sulfinic acids; phosphonic acids; phosphinic acids; activated sulfonamides (e.g., -SC^NHX wherein X is an electron withdrawing group relative to an alkyl group, such as an acyl group or aryl group; activated carboxamides (e.g., -C(O)NHCN); hydroxamic acids (-C(O)NHOH); acidic heterocycles or substituted heterocycles (e.g., tetrazoles, triazoles, hydroxypyrazoles, hydroxyoxazoles, hydroxythiadiazoles); and acidic alcohols (e.g., -C(CF3)2OH or -CH(CF3)OH). [0049J    Compounds (hat have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "isomers". Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers". Stercoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereomers" and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed "enantiomers". When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Calm and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixHue containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a "racemic mixture".<br>
|OOSO|    The compounds ot this invention may exist in stereoisomeric form if they possess one or more asymmetric centers or a double bond with asymmetric substitution and, therefore, can be produced as individual stereoisomers or as mixtures. Unless otherwise indicated, the description is intended to include individual stereoisomers as well as mixtures. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992). [0051]    "Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" of a compound means a salt that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound.

[0054]    "Prodrugs" means any compound which releases an active parent drug according to Formula la or Ib in vivo w'nen such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of a compoun j of Formula la or Ib are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compoun d of Formula la or Ib in such a way that the modifications may be cleaved I'M vivo to rcle ase the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of Formula la or Ib wherein a b   ,'ioxy, amino, or sulfhydryl group in a compound of Formula la or Ib is bonded to any gi
[0055]    "Protecting group" refers to a grouping of atoms that when attached to a reactive group in a molecule masks, reduces or prevents that reactivity. Examples of protecting groups can be found in T.W. Greene and P.O. Wuts, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, (Wiley, 2nd ed. 1991) and Harrison and Harrison et al., COMPENDIUM OF SYNTHETIC ORGANIC METHODS, Vols. 1-8 (John Wiley and Sons. 1971-1996).

pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor<br>
otherwise undesirable, and includes a carrier or excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use<br>
as well as human pharmaceutical use. A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient"<br>
as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such carrier or<br>
excipient.<br>
[0057]    With reference to the methods of the present invention, the following terms are used<br>
with the noted meanings:<br>
[0058)    The terms "treating" or "treatment" of a disease includes:<br>
10059J    (1)    preventing the disease, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to<br>
develop in a mammal that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet<br>
experience or display symptoms of the disease,<br>
[0060]    (2)    inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the<br>
disease or its clinical symptoms, or<br>
|0061 ]    (3)    relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical<br>
symptoms.<br>
[0062)    The term "thcrapeutically effective amount" means the amount of the subject<br>
compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or<br>
human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br>
"A therapeutically effective amount" includes the amount of a compound that, when<br>
administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the<br>
disease. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary depending on the compound, the<br>
disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated.<br>
[0063[    The term "mammal" includes, without limitation, humans, domestic animals (e.g.,<br>
dogs or cats), farm animals (cows, horses, or pigs), monkeys, rabbits, mice, and laboratory<br>
animals.<br>
[0064)    The term "insulin resistance" can be defined generally as a disorder of glucose<br>
metabolism. More specifically, insulin resistance can be defined as the diminished ability of<br>
insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations producing less than the expected biologic effect, (see, e.g., Reaven, G. M., /. Basic &amp; Clin. Phys. &amp; Pharm. (1998) 9: 387-406 and Flier, J. Ann Rev. Med. (1983) 34: 145-60). Insulin resistant persons have a diminished ability to properly metabolize glucose and respond poorly, if at all, to insulin therapy. Manifestations of insulin resistance include insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in liver. Insulin resistance can cause or contribute to polycystic ovarian syndrome, Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT), gestational diabetes, hypertension, obesity, atherosclerosis and a variety of other disorders. Eventually, the insulin resistant individuals can progress to a point where a diabetic state is reached. The association of insulin resistance with glucose intolerance, an increase in plasma triglyceride and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, high blood pressure, hyperuricemia, smaller denser low-density lipoprotein particles, and higher circulating levels of plaminogcn activator inhibitor-1), has been referred to as "Syndrome X" (see, e.g., Reaven, G. M., P/IP iol. Rev. (1995) 75: 473-486).<br>
[0065]    The term "diabetes mellitus" or "diabetes" means a disease or condition that is generally characterized by metabolic defects in production and utilization of glucose which result in the failure to ni;unlain appropriate blood sugar levels in the body. The result of these defects is elevated bloo d r.lucose, referred to as "hyperglycemia." Two major forms of diabetes are Type 1 di abct'-s and Type 2 diabetes. As described above, Type 1 diabetes is generally the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. Type 2 diabetes often occurs in the face of normal, or even elevated levels of insulin and can result from the inability of tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Most Type 2 diabetic patients are insulin resistant and have a relative deficiency of insulin, in that insulin secretion can not compensate for the resistance of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin. In addition, many Type 2 diabetics are obese. Other types of disorders of glucose homeostasis include Impaired Glucose Tolerance, which is a metabolic stage intermediate between normal glucose homeostasis and diabetes, and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, which is glucose intolerance in pregnancy in women with no previous history of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes,<br>
[0066]    The term "secondary diabetes" is diabetes resulting from other identifiable etiologies which include: genetic defects of 0 cell function (e.g.. maturity onset-type diabetes of youth, referred to as "MODY," which is an early-onset form of Type 2 diabetes with autosomal inheritance; see, e.g., Fajans S. et al, Diabet. Med. (1996) (9 Suppl 6): S90-5 and<br>
Bell, G. et al.,Annu. Rev. PhysioL (1996) 58: 171-86; genetic defects in insulin action; diseases of the exocrine pancreas (e.g., hemochromatosis, pancreatitis, and cystic fibrosis); certain endocrine diseases in which excess hormones interfere with insulin action (e.g., growth hormone in acromegaly and cortisol in Gushing's syndrome); certain drugs that suppress insulin secretion (e.g., phenytoin) or inhibit insulin action (e.g., estrogens and glucocorticoids); and diabetes caused by infection (e.g., rubella, Coxsackie, and CMV); as well as other genetic syndromes.<br>
[0067]    The guidelines for diagnosis for Type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and gestational diabetes have been outlined by the American Diabetes Association (see, e.g., The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Care, (1999)Vol2(Suppll):S5-19).<br>
[0068]    The term "hyperinsulinernia" refers to the presence of an abnormally elevated level of insulin in the blood. Similarly, the term "hyperuricemia" refers to the presence of an abnormally elevated level of uric acid in the blood. The term "hyperlipidemia" refers to the presence of an abnormally elevated level oflipids in the blood. Hyperlipidemia can appear in at least three forms: (1) hypercholesknolemia, i.e., an elevated cholesterol level; (2) hypertriglyceridemia, i.e., an elevated triglyceride level; and (3) combined hyperlipidemia, i.e., a combination of hypercholestr;rolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, [0069]    The term "secretagoguc" means a substance or compound that stimulates secretion. For example, an insulin secretagogue is a substance or compound that stimulates secretion of insulin.<br>
[0070]    The term "hemoglobin" or "Hb" refers to a respiratory pigment present in erythrocytes, which is largely responsible for oxygen transport. A hemoglobin molecule comprises four polypeplide subuni ts (two a chain systems and two /3 chain systems, respectively). Each subunit is fon ned by association of one globin protein and one heme molecule which is an iron-protop* jrphyrin complex. The major class of hemoglobin found in normal adult hemolysale is adult hemoglobin (referred to as "HbA"; also referred to HbAo for distinguishing it from glycated hemoglobin, which is referred to as "HbAi," described infra) having a.$i subunits. Trace components such as HbAz (0362) can also be found in normal adult hemolysate.<br>
[0071]    Among classes of adult hemoglobin HbAs, there is a glycated hemoglobin (referred to as "HbAi," or "glycosylated hemoglobin"), which may be further fractionated into HbAiai, HbAiaz, HbAib, and HbA|C with an ion exchange resin fractionation. All of these subclasses have the same primary structure, whiich is stabilized by formation of an aldimine (Schiff<br>
base) by the amino group of N-terminal valine in the /3 subunit chain of normal hemoglobin HbA and glucose (or, glucose-6-phosphate or fructose) followed by formation of ketoamine by Amadori rearrangement.<br>
[0072]    The term "glycosylated hemoglobin" (also referred to as "HbA|c&gt;", "GHb", "hemoglobin - glycosylated", "diabetic control index" and "glycohemoglobin"; hereinafter referred to as "hemoglobin A|C") refers to a stable product of the nonenzymatic glycosylation of the (3-chain of hemoglobin by plasma glucose. Hemoglobin AIC comprises the main portion of glycated hemoglobins in the blood. The ratio of glycosylated hemoglobin is proportional to blood glucose level. Therefore, hemoglobin A)C rate of formation directly increases with increasing plasma glucose levels. Since glycosylation occurs at a constant rate during the 120-day lifespan of an erythrocyte, measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin levels reflect the average blood glucose level for an individual during the preceding two to three months. Therefore determination of the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin HbAic can be a good index for carbohydrate metabolism control. Accordingly, blood glucose levels of the last two months can be estimated on the basis of the ratio of HbA|C to total hemoglobin Hb. The analysis of the hemoglobin A], in blood is used as a measurement enabling long-term control of blood glucose level (see, e.g., Jain, S., etal., Diabetes (1989) 38: 1539-1543; Peters A., et ai.JAMA (1996) 276: 1246-1252).<br>
(0073]    The term "symptom" of diabetes, includes, but is not limited to, polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia, as used herein, incorporating their common usage. For example, "polyuria" means the passage of a large volume of urine during a given period; "polydipsia" means chronic, excessive thirst; a.nd "polyphagia" means excessive eating. Other symptoms of diabetes include, e.g., increased susceptibility to certain infections (especially fungal and staphylococcal infections), nausea, and ketoacidosis (enhanced production of ketone bodies in the blood).<br>
[0074]    The term "complication" of diabetes includes, but is not limited to, microvascular complications and macrovascular complications. Microvascular complications are those complications which generally result in small blood vessel damage. These complications include, e.g., retinopathy (the impairment or loss of vision due to blood vessel damage in the eyes); neuropathy (nerve damage and foot problems due to blood vessel damage to the nervous system); and nephropathy (kidney disease due to blood vessel damage in the kidneys). Macrovascular complications are those complications which generally result from large blood vessel damage. These complications include, e.g., cardiovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease. Cardiovascular disease refers to diseases of blood vessels of the<br>
heart. See. e.g., Kaplan, R. M., et al., "Cardiovascular diseases" in HEALTH AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR, pp. 206-242 (McGraw-Hill, New York 1993). Cardiovascular disease is generally one of several forms, including, e.g., hypertension (also referred to as high blood pressure), coronary heart disease, stroke, and rheumatic heart disease. Peripheral vascular disease refers to diseases of any of the blood vessels outside of the heart. It is often a narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood to leg and arm muscles. [00751    The term "atherosclerosis" encompasses vascular diseases and conditions that are recognized and understood by physicians practicing in the relevant fields of medicine. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease), cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vessel disease are all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis and are therefore encompassed by the terms "atherosclerosis" and "atherosclerotic disease".<br>
[0076]    The term "antihyperlipidemic" refers to the lowering of excessive lipid concentrations in blood to desired levels. Similarly, the term "antiuricemic" refers to the lowering of excessive uric acid concentrations in blood to desired levels. |0077)    The term "modulate" refers to the treating, prevention, suppression, enhancement or induction of a function or condition. For example, the compounds of the present invention can modulate hyperlipidemia by lowering cholesterol in a human, thereby suppressing hyperlipidemia.<br>
[0078]    The term "triglyceride(s)" ("TGs"), as used herein, incorporates its common usage. TGs consist of three fatty acid molecules esterified to a glycerol molecule and serve to store fatty acids which are used by muscle cells for energy production or are taken up and stored in adipose tissue.<br>
10079]    Because cholesterol and TGs are water insoluble, they must be packaged in special molecular complexes known as "lipoproteins" in order to be transported in the plasma. Lipoproteins can accumulate in the plasma due to overproduction and/or deficient removal. There are at least five distinct lipoproteins differing in size, composition, density, and function. In the cells of the small of the intestine, dietary lipids are packaged into large lipoprotein complexes called "chylomicrons", which have a high TG and low-cholesterol content. In the liver, TG and cholesterol esters are packaged and released into plasma as TG-rich lipoprotein called very low density lipoprotein ("VLDL"), whose primary function is the endogenous transport of TGs made in the liver or released by adipose tissue. Through enzymatic action, VLDL can be either reduced and taken up by the liver, or transformed into intermediate density lipoprotein ("IDL"). IDL, is in turn, either taken up by the liver, or is<br>
further modified to form the low density lipoprotein ("LDL"). LDL is either taken up and<br>
broken down by the liver, or is taken up by extrahepatic tissue. High density lipoprotein<br>
("HDL") helps remove cholesterol from peripheral tissues in a process called reverse<br>
cholesterol transport,<br>
[0080]    The term "dyslipidemia" refers to abnormal levels of lipoproteins in blood plasma<br>
including both depressed and/or elevated levels of lipoproteins (e.g., elevated levels of LDL,<br>
VLDL and depressed levels of HDL).<br>
10081]    Exemplary Primary Hyperlipidemia include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
(0082]    (1) Familial Hyperchylomicronemia, a rare genetic disorder which causes a<br>
deficiency in an enzyme, LIP Hpase, that breaks down fat molecules. The LP lipase<br>
deficiency can cause the accumulation of large quantities of fat or lipoproteins in the blood;<br>
[0083]    (2) Familial Hypercholesterolemia, a relatively common genetic disorder caused<br>
where the underlying defect is a series of mutations in the LDL receptor gene that result in<br>
malfunctioning LDL receptors and/or absence of the LDL receptors. This brings about<br>
ineffective clearance of LDL by the LDL receptors resulting in elevated LDL and total<br>
cholesterol levels in the plasma;<br>
[0084]    (3) Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia, also known as multiple lipoprotein-type<br>
hyperlipidemia; an inherited diso rder where patients and their affected first-degree relatives<br>
can at various times manifest high cholesterol and high triglycerides. Levels of HDL<br>
cholesterol are often moderately decreased;<br>
[0085J    (4) Familial Defective Apolipoprotein B-100 is a relatively common autosomal<br>
dominant genetic abnormality. The defect is caused by a single nucleotide mutation that<br>
produces a substitution of glutamine for arginine which can cause reduced affinity of LDL<br>
particles for the LDL receptor. Consequently, this can cause high plasma LDL and total<br>
cholesterol levels;<br>
[0086]    (5) Familial Dysbetaliproteinemia, also referred to as Type III<br>
Hyperlipoproteinemia, is an unc( &gt;mmon inherited disorder resulting in moderate to severe<br>
elevations of sevum TG and chol esterol levels with abnormal apolipoprotein E function.<br>
HDL levels are usually normal; and<br>
[0087]    (6) Familial Hypertriglyceridemia, is a common inherited disorder in which the<br>
concentration of plasma VLDL is elevated. This can cause mild to moderately elevated<br>
triglyceride levels (and usually not cholesterol levels) and can often be associated with low<br>
plasma HDL levels.<br>
[0088]    Risk factors in exemplary Secondary Hyperlipidemia include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) disease risk factors, such as a history of Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, hypothroidism and certain types of renal failure; (2) drug risk factors, which include, birth control pills; hormones, such as estrogen, and corticosteroids; certain diuretics; and various 0 blockers; (3) dietary risk factors include dietary fat intake per total calories greater than 40%; saturated fat intake per total calories greater than 10%; cholesterol intake greater than 300 mg per day; habitual and excessive alcohol use; and obesity. [0089]    The terms "obese" and "obesity" refers to, according to the World Health Organization, a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 27.8 kg/m2 for men and 27,3 kg/m2 for women (BMI equals weight (kg)/height (m2). Obesity is linked to a variety of medical conditions including diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Obesity is also a known risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes (See, e.g., Barrett-Conner, E., Epidemol. Rev, (1989) 11: 172-181; and Knowler, et al.,^m../. Clin. Nutr. (1991) 53:1543-1551). [0090]    The terms "optional" or "optionally" as used throughout the specification means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may but need not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "heteroeyclo group optionally mono- or di- substituted with an alkyl group" means that the alkyl may but need not be present, and the description includes situations where the heterocy -'o group is mono- or disubstituted with an alkyl group and situations where the heteroeyclo group is not substituted with the alkyl group.<br>
General<br>
[0091]    The present invention derives from the discovery that compounds of Formula la or Ib are useful in treating or controlling a number of diseases associated with glucose metabolism, lipid rnetuboUsm and insulin secretion. More particularly, the compounds of the invention aie useful in treating insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperurit omia and obesity. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is considered that the compounds of Formula la or Ib operate via modulation of receptor interactions associated with o ne or more isoforms of PPAR. As a result, the compounds will likely have utility in treating other diseases states or conditions associated with PPAR.<br>

General Synthetic Routes to Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0116]    The compounds of the present invention can be prepared using methods generally outlined in Schemes 1-5.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br>
[0117]    According to Scheme 1, sa.'licylic acids of formula i (either commercially available or prepared according to known m.ethods) are condensed with suitably substituted 2-aminophenols (ii) to provide a 2 (benzoxazol-2-yl)phenol (Hi). Treatment of iii with a suitably substituted ethyl 2-brornophenylacetate (vi-a), generally in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, provides the target compound vii. Alternatively, 2-fluorobenzoic acids (iv) can be converted to the corresponding derivatives v which can then be converted to iii and carried on through the scheme as noted, or, in certain embodiments, compounds of formula v can be converted d irectly into target compounds vii using 2-hydroxyphenylacet ic acid derivatives (vi-b). The latter route is particularly useful for the compounds of formula vii in which R1 substituents increase the reactivity of the ring toward fluorine displacement. Additionally, in the above Scheme as well as in Formulae II and III, below, each R4 (the subscript s being an integer of from 0 to 4), is meant to include any of the HAr substituents provided above.<br><br>
[0118]    Structural isomers, having the benzoxazolyl ring attached at either the 3-position or<br>
the 4-position relative to the phenolic hydroxy group in compound iii can be prepared from<br>
the corresponding 3-hydroxybenzoic acids and 4-hydroxybenzoic acids.<br>
(0119}    In a similar manner, compounds of formula la wherein X is NH can be prepared as<br>
follows.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br>
(0120]    Here, a 2-fluo robenzoic acid or benzoyl chloride (viii) serves as the starting<br>

fluorides, ix. Treatment of ix with the suitably substituted ethyl 2-aminophenylacetate (vi-c)<br>
provides the target compound x.<br>
[0121]    Still further, the general schemes outlined in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 can be used to<br>
prepare compounds of Formula la in which HAr is benzothiazolyl. To obtain these<br>
compounds, the 2-aminophenols (ii) are replaced by the corresponding 2-aminothiophenols.<br>
More specific details are provided in the examples below.<br>
[0122]    Preparation of compounds of Formula la in which HAr is a suitably substituted<br>
benzimidazole can be prepared according to the general methods outlined in Scheme 3.<br>

[0124]    In each of Schemes 1, 2 and 3, the position of the heteroaryl ring portion can be changed depending on the starting benzoic acids i and viii.<br>
[0125]    Related compounds can be prepared in a similar manner beginning with, for example, appropriately substituted 2-(5-isoxazolyl)phenols, many of which are available from commercial sources or can be prepared according to literature methods (see Scheme 4).<br><br>

Conversion of each of these groups in <u the corresponding alcohols ethers or aldehydes can be accomplished using methods genera ly known to one of skill in art. several for reduction oxidation are provided below as illustrative processess used preparing additional compounds invention.></u>
Conversion of carboxylic acids into aldehydes, carbinols and carbinol esters, [0129]    The carboxylic acids of this invention can be converted into the corresponding aldehydes, carbinols and carbinol esters by a number of methods, including the routes A-E shown in Scheme 6. The method to be used in a given case depends on the nature of R, and<br>
the substituents thereon. A variety of useful methods are described in Larock, COMPREHENSIVE ORGANIC TRANSFORMATIONS, VCH Publishers Inc. New York (1989). In particular, methods are described for converting acyl chlorides 2 to aldehydes 3 (p 620), aldehydes 3 to carbinols 4 (p 528ff), esters 5 to aldehydes 3 (p 621), esters 5 to carbinols 4 (p 549), carboxylic acids 1 to carbinols 4 (p 548), carbinols 4 to aldehydes 3 (p 604) and carbinols 4 to esters 6 (p 966).<br>
[0130]    In method A, Scheme 6, the carboxylic acid 1 is first converted into the corresponding acid chloride 2. This transformation is effected by reacting the acid 1 with oxalyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloridc, or, preferably, thionyl chloride. The reaction is conducted in an aprotic solvent such as dichloi muethane, tetrahydrofuran or, preferably, 1,2-dichloroethane. The acid chloride 2 is then converted into the aldehyde 3 by chemical reduction, such as by the use of sodium borohydride in DMF at -70°C, as described in Tetrahedron Lett. 22:11 (1981), or, more pre ferably by hydrogenation using 5% palladium on barium sulfate as catalyst (see, for example., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 108:2608 (1986)). The reaction is conducted in an iiprotic solvent such as toluene or, preferably, xylene.

[0142]    The compositions of the invention can include compounds of Formula la or Ib, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or a hydrolyzable precursor thereof. In general, the ompound is mixed with suitable earners or excipient(s) in a therapeutically effective imount. By a "therapeutically effective dose", "therapeutically effective amount", or, nterchangeably, "pharmacologically acceptable dose" or "pharmacologically acceptable imount", it is meant that a sufficieni amount of the compound of the present invention and a )harmaceutically acceptable carriei, will be present in order to achieve a desired result, e.g., alleviating a symptom or complies lion of Type 2 diabetes.<br>
[0143]    The compounds of Form ula la or Ib that are used in the methods of the present invention can be incorporated into a variety of formulations for therapeutic administration. More particularly, the compounds of Fonnula la or Ib can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by combination w ith appropriate, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, and can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, dragees, gels, slurries, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols. As such, administration of the compounds can bo achieved in various ways, including oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intradermai, transdermal, intratracheal administration. Moreover, the compound can be administered in a local rather than systemic manner, in a depot or sustained release formulation. In addition, the compounds can be administered in a liposome. [0144]    The compounds of Formula la or Ib can be formulated with common excipients, diluents or carriers, and compressed into tablets, or formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration, or administered by the intramuscular or intravenous routes. The compounds can be administered transdermally, and can be formulated as sustained release dosage forms and the like. Compounds of Formula la or Ib can be administered alone, in combination with each other, or they can be used in combination with other known compounds (see Combination Therapy below).<br>
[0145J    Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company (1985) Philadelphia, PA, 17th ed.), which is incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, for a brief review of methods for drug delivery, see, Langer, Science (1990) 249:1527-1533, which is incorporated herein by reference. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be manufactured in a manner that is known to those of skill in the art, i.e., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.<br>
[0146]    For injection, the c
[0147]    For oral administration, ihe compounds of Formula la or Ib can be formulated read' iy by combining with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that are well known in the ai I   Such carriers enable the com pounds to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, emu Isions, lipophilic and hydrophilic suspensions, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions an^1 the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by mixing the compounds with a solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents can be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. [0148J    Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions can be used, which can optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments can be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.<br>
[0149]    Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds can be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers can be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration.<br>
(0150]    For buccal administration, the compositions can take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
[01511    For admins stration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifiuoroniethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas, or from propellant-free, dry-powder inhalers. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit can be determined by providing a valve to deliver a meterecl amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch<br>
[0152]    The compounds can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, 
[01531    Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds can be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions can contain<br>
substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension can also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. (0154]    The compounds can also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes, polyethylene glycols or other glycerides, all of which melt at body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.<br>
[0155]    In addition to the fonnu'iations described previously, the compounds can also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the comsiounds can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, )'
[0158]    The pharmaceutical compositions also can comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
[0159)    Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in a therapeutically effective amount. The amount of composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. Determination of an effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.<br>
[0160]    For any compound used in the method of the present invention, a therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from celt culture assays or animal models. 0161]    Moreover, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compounds described herein can jc determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the LD50, (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED so (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is (he therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio between LDso and ED.so. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell L uliure assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a dosage rant'e (hat is not toxic for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably v\ ithin a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDso with little or no toxicity. The' dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage c;sn be chosen by dhe individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See, e.g.,F\\\f:,let al. 1975 In;  The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Ch. 1). [0162]    The amouin of active compound that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the disease treated, the mammalian species, and the particular mode of administration. However, as a general guide, suitable unit doses for the compounds of the present invention can, for example, preferably contain between 100 ing to about 3000 mg of the active compound. A preferred unit dose is between 500 mg to about 1500 mg. A more preferred unit dose is between 500 to about 1000 mg. Such unit <ioses can be administered more than once a day for example or times but preferably per so that the total daily dosage kg adult is in range of to about mg weight subject administration. preferred administration and such therapy extend number weeks months some cases years. it will understood however specific dose level any particular patient depend on variety></ioses>
factors including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the individual being treated; the time and route of administration; the rate of excretion; other drugs which have previously been administered; and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy, as is well understood by those of skill in the area.<br>
10163]    A typical dosage can be one 10 to about 1500 mg tablet taken once a day, or, multiple times per day, or one time-release capsule or tablet taken once a day and containing a proportionally higher content of active ingredient, The time-release effect can be obtained by capsule materials that dissolve at different pH values, by capsules that release slowly by osmotic pressure, or by any other known means of controlled release. [0164]    It can be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases as will be apparent to those skilled in the an. Further, it is noted that the clinician or treating physician will know how and when to interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient response<br>

The condenser was cooled with 4°C water. The mixture was heated to an internal temperature of 55-60"C. Gas evolution was observed and the solids dissolved us the internal temperature rose to 55-60°C over 45 min.. The mixture was then stirred at 55-60°C for 45 min.. Bromine (33.0 mL (102.4 g), 0.65 mole) was charged and the mixture maintained at 55-60°C for 18 h. The internal temperature was then raised to 80-85°C over 1.5 h and heating continued for 18h (based on other runs, the reaction is complete after 6-7h). The mixture was cooled to 20-25°C and anhydrous dichloromethane (500 mL) added. In a separate flask was place 2-acetylethanolamine (190 mL (213 g), 2.07 mole) and anhydrous dichloromethane (500 mL) under argon and the mixture cooled to 2.8°C. To this<br>
was added the acyl halide solution at such a rate as to keep the internal temperature below 21 °C (caution: exothermic). After the addition was complete (approx. 20 min.), the mixture was stirred in the cold bath for 0.5h, at which time the internal temperature was 4.8 °C. This mixture was carefully added to 1.5 L water containing sodium bicarbonate (148 g, 1.8 mole) at such a rate that frothing was moderate. The pH at the end of the addition (15 min.) was 7, by pH paper. Sodium thiosulfate (18.7 g, 0.12 mole) was added in portions and gas evolution was observed. Bromine was found to be absent at this time by testing with a Peroxid 100 (quantifix) strip. The layers were then partitioned in a separatory funnel (100 mL dichloromethane used in transfer), and the organic phase extracted with 250 mL water, dried over magnesium sulfate (17 g), and filtered. The filter cake was washed with dichloromethane (150 mL). Rotary evaporation and pumping at high vacuum afforded an oil, which was slurried in 100 mL hexane: ethyl acetate (70:30). Additional hexane (300 mL) was added until a white color formed in the top layer of the biphasic mixture. Vigorous agitation afforded a solid, which was filtered away from the supernatant to yield crude (2-acetamidoethyl)-4-chlorophenylbromoacetate SBr-14 (147g) as a light tan solid.<br>

Animals were housed (4-5 mice/cage) under standard laboratory conditions at 22 ± 3°C temperature and 50 ± 20% relative humidity, and were maintained on a diet of Purina rodent chow and water ad libitum. Prior to treatment, blood was collected from the tail vein of each animal. Mice that had non-fasting plasma glucose levels between 250 and 500 mg/dl were used. Each treatment group consisted of 8-10 mice that were distributed so that the mean glucose levels were equivalent in each group at the start of the study. Mice were dosed orally by gavage once a day for 1-4 days with vehicle and one or more dose of test compound at a dose ranging from 5 to 125 mg/kg. Compounds were delivered in a liquid formulation containing 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1% (v/v) Tween 80® and 0.9% (w/v) methylcellulose. The gavage volume was 10 ml/kg, Blood<br>
samples were taken at 6 hours after the each dose and analyzed for plasma glucose. Food intake and body weight were measured daily. Plasma glucose concentrations were determined colorimetrically using a commercial glucose oxidase method (Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO, USA). Significant difference between groups (comparing drug-treated to vehicle-treated) was evaluated using the Student unpaired t-test.<br>
