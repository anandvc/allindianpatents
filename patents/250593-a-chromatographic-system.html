				<td>Prior Application<br>
[0001] This application claims priority benefits under 35 U.S.C.<br>
§119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/521179, filed<br>
March 4, 2004, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in<br>
their entirety.<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to systems and methods for<br>
measuring the integrity of a sorbent tube that can be used, for example, in<br>
chromatographic systems. More specifically, the invention relates to methods<br>
and systems that include a measurement of a geometric characteristic of the<br>
sorbent tube.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
[0003] Sorbent tubes have many different applications, and include a<br>
packing material that can be used for adsorption. One application for sorbent<br>
tubes includes gas chromatography. Gas chromatography is essentially a<br>
physical method of separation in which constituents of a test sample in a<br>
carrier gas are adsorbed or absorbed and then desorbed by a stationary<br>
phase material in a column. A pulse of the sample is introduced into a steady<br><br><br>
flow of carrier gas, which carries the sample into a chromatographic column.<br>
The inside of the column is lined with a liquid, and interactions between this<br>
liquid and the various components of the sample—which differ based upon<br>
differences among partition coefficients of the elements—cause the sample to<br>
be separated into the respective elements. At the end of the column, the<br>
individual components are more or less separated in time. Detection of the<br>
gas provides a time-scaled pattern, typically called a chromatogram, that, by<br>
calibration or comparison with known samples, indicates the constituents, and<br>
the specific concentrations thereof, which are present in the test sample. An<br>
example of the process by which this occurs is described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,545,252 to Hinshaw.<br>
[0004] One common application of chromatographic analysis is the use<br>
of thermal desorption units to determine the constituents of a particular<br>
environment. For example, it is often desired to detect the amount of volatile<br>
organic compounds (VOCs) present in a certain sample of air. One way of<br>
doing this is by first transporting a tube packed with an adsorbent material into<br>
the environment to be tested, and allowing the VOCs in the air to migrate into<br>
the tube through natural diffusion, typically termed "diffusive" or "passive<br>
sampling." Alternatively, the VOCs may be collected by drawing a sample of<br>
gas (typically ambient air) through such a tube using a small vacuum pump,<br>
commonly referred to as "pumped sampling." In each case, the analytes to be<br>
measured (i.e., the VOCs) are retained by and concentrated on the adsorbent<br><br><br>
as the air passes through the tube. As is briefly described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,649,129 to Neal, once the VOCs are first collected in this fashion, and then,<br>
the tube is subsequently heated in a thermal desorption instrument, and a<br>
flow of inert gas, such as Helium or Nitrogen, is applied to the tube to sweep<br>
the VOCs out of the tube and into the chromatographic column for separation<br>
and analysis.<br>
[0005] Regardless of what particular application is being used, it is also<br>
often desired to pre-concentrate the analytes in the sample, and occasionally,<br>
remove moisture therefrom, prior to introducing the sample into the<br>
chromatographic column. Accordingly, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,792,423 and 6,395,560 to Markelov, these systems will typically include<br>
some kind of "trap" for this purpose, which retains the analytes as they are<br>
carried through the trap, and which are later released from the trap, usually by<br>
heating, and swept into the chromatographic column. One example is an<br>
adsorbent trap, which typically includes a tube packed with a suitable<br>
adsorbent material, which adsorbs the analytes as the sample gas first<br>
passes through the tube, and from which the analytes are subsequently<br>
desorbed into the chromatographic column, such as the arrangements<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,932,482 to Markelov and U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,652,625 to Tipler.<br>
[0006] However, one problem that exists in these various systems is<br>
that the sorbent tubes serving as the traps, as well as the sorbent tube<br><br><br>
serving as initial sampling tubes when dealing with applications involving the<br>
traditional thermal desorption units discussed above, is that the integrity of<br>
these tubes is sometimes compromised. Several causes of this problem are<br>
illustrated in Figures 1A-B. For example, in order for thermal desorption to<br>
work successfully, the adsorbent 10 must be properly packed inside the tube<br>
12. However, sometimes this does not occur, and voids 14 are formed in the<br>
adsorbent, as shown in Figure 1A. These voids will channel some of the gas<br>
flow, thereby degrading the adsorption and desorption efficiency of the<br>
adsorbent packing.<br>
[0007] Similarly, occasionally, the adsorbent becomes damaged as a<br>
result of improper packing or thermal shock, thereby producing small<br>
fragments (fines) 16 that occlude the interstices between the packing<br>
particles, as shown in Figure 1B. As a result, the flow of gas is partially<br>
blocked during adsorption and desorption, again degrading the efficiency of<br>
the sorbenttube.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
[0008] Accordingly, the present teachings provide systems and<br>
methods for determining a geometric measure of a sorbent tube ("tube")<br>
based on determining a differential pressure across the tube and relating the<br>
same to a flow rate at a tube outlet. Although the illustrated embodiments<br>
include applications directed to gas chromatography systems and methods, it<br><br><br>
can be understood that the present teachings can be equally applied to other<br>
sorbent tube applications.<br>
[0009] In an embodiment, the present teachings include methods that<br>
include providing a vessel having an adsorbent disposed therein, the vessel<br>
having an inlet and an outlet for communicating a carrier gas through the<br>
vessel, determining a differential pressure between the inlet and the outlet for<br>
a known flow rate at the outlet; and, determining a geometric measure for the<br>
vessel based on a ratio of the known flow rate and the differential pressure.<br>
In determining a differential pressure, the methods can include providing at<br>
least one sensor to provide measurements related to the differential pressure.<br>
Determining a geometric measure can also include factoring a viscosity of the<br>
carrier gas in the ratio. In embodiments, the vessel may include an adsorbent<br>
trap or a sample tube. The methods can further include one or more of<br>
determining a flow rate at ambient pressure using a factor based on a ratio of<br>
a gas pressure at the output and ambient pressure, and, determining a flow<br>
rate at ambient temperature using a factor based on a ratio of a temperature<br>
at the output and ambient temperature.<br>
[0010] In some embodiments, the present teachings relate to a<br>
chromatographic method that includes providing a vessel in a carrier gas flow<br>
path to a chromatographic column, where the vessel includes a gas inlet, a gas<br>
outlet, and, an adsorbent disposed in the vessel. The chromatographic<br>
methods also include measuring a differential pressure along the length of the<br><br><br>
adsorbent, determining a flow rate at the outlet, and, determining a unit flow<br>
per unit pressure based on a ratio of the flow rate and the differential pressure.<br>
In some embodiments, the methods can include adjusting the unit flow per unit<br>
pressure based on a viscosity of the gas. In embodiments, the<br>
chromatographic methods include determining (i) a flow rate at ambient<br>
pressure using a factor based on a ratio of a gas pressure at the output and<br>
ambient pressure, and/or, (ii) a flow rate at ambient temperature using a factor<br>
based on a ratio of a temperature at the output and ambient temperature.<br>
[0011] In an embodiment, the present teachings thus comprise a<br>
chromatographic system, including a carrier gas inlet for supplying carrier gas,<br>
a chromatographic column for receiving the carrier gas, a flow path through<br>
which the carrier gas is communicated from the carrier gas inlet to the<br>
chromatographic column, a vessel disposed in the flow path, the vessel having<br>
an adsorbent disposed therein, wherein the vessel includes an inlet and an<br>
outlet for communicating the carrier gas through the vessel, and, at least one<br>
sensor in communication with said flow path, the at least one sensor providing<br>
at least one measurement for determining a differential pressure along the<br>
adsorbent material which when related to a flow rate at the vessel outlet and a<br>
viscosity of the carrier gas, provides a unit flow per unit pressure for said<br>
carrier gas in said vessel. The sensor(s) can include at least one sensor for<br>
measuring a pressure at the vessel inlet and a pressure at the vessel outlet.<br><br><br>
[0012] In an embodiment, the invention comprises a method of<br>
performing a chromatographic analysis, including providing a carrier gas inlet<br>
for supplying carrier gas, providing a chromatographic column for receiving the<br>
carrier gas, providing a vessel having an adsorbent disposed therein for<br>
adsorbing and desorbing analytes to be measured, the vessel having an inlet<br>
and an outlet for communicating carrier gas through the vessel, communicating<br>
carrier gas from the carrier gas inlet, into the vessel through the vessel inlet,<br>
and out of the vessel through the vessel outlet, and determining the impedance<br>
of the gas communicated through the vessel.<br>
[0013] In one embodiment, the invention comprises a chromatographic<br>
system, including a carrier gas inlet for supplying carrier gas, a<br>
chromatographic column for receiving the carrier gas, a flow path through<br>
which the carrier gas is communicated from the carrier gas inlet to the<br>
chromatographic column, a vessel disposed in the flow path, the vessel having<br>
an adsorbent disposed therein for adsorbing and desorbing analytes to be<br>
measured, wherein the vessel includes an inlet and an outlet for<br>
communicating the carrier gas through the vessel, and at least one sensor in<br>
communication with the flow path adjacent at least one of the vessel inlet and<br>
the vessel outlet for measuring at least one characteristic of the gas<br>
communicated through the vessel.<br><br><br>

Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
[0028] The basic components of one embodiment of a chromatographic<br>
system that verifies the integrity of a sorbent tube in accordance with the<br>
present teachings are illustrated in Figures 2A-B. As used in the description,<br>
the terms "top," "bottom," "above," "below," "over," "under," "above," "beneath,"<br>
"on top," "underneath," "up," "down," "upper," "lower," "front," "rear," "back,"<br>
"forward" and "backward" refer to the objects referenced when in the<br><br><br>
orientation illustrated in the drawings, which orientation is not necessary for<br>
achieving the objects of the invention.<br>
[0029] The chromatographic system typically includes a sample<br>
container, such as sample tube 20, canister 22, or headspace vial 24, from<br>
which a sample containing the analytes to be measured is supplied to the<br>
system, though, in some applications, a sample of the surrounding atmosphere<br>
is pumped directly into the system via an inlet 26. The sample is usually<br>
extracted from the sample container or placed in a flow path of carrier gas, and<br>
the gas carries the sample through the system, as is further described below.<br>
As shown in Figure 2A, the sample is typically first carried through an analyte<br>
pre-concentrator, which, in some embodiments, comprises a vessel 30, such<br>
as a tube, with an adsorbent 32 disposed therein, often referred to as an<br>
adsorbent trap. As shown in Figure 2B, after the adsorbent 32 adsorbs the<br>
analytes and the remainder of the gas mixture passes through the vessel 30<br>
and vents from the system, the vessel 30 is heated by a heating element 34<br>
and the analytes are desorbed into a chromatographic column 40.<br>
[0030] A system utilizing a thermal desorption unit for testing samples<br>
collected in sample tubes is shown in detail in Figure 3. In these systems, a<br>
vessel, such as the sorbent tube 100, is transported to a location from which a<br>
sample is to be collected. Depending on the particular application, the sample<br>
may be collected in the vessel 100 in different ways, such as, for example, by<br>
pumping the sample into the vessel 100, or, in a particular environment to be<br><br><br>
tested, by allowing components in the air to simply migrate into the vessel 100<br>
through natural diffusion. The vessel 100 is then transported to the thermal<br>
desorption device, where it may be placed in fluid communication with a<br>
separate adsorbent trap 102 for further concentration of the analytes prior to<br>
desorption into the chromatographic column 104.<br>
[0031] The operation of this system is illustrated stepwise in Figures 3-5.<br>
A sample vessel dry purge step is illustrated in Figure 3. As shown therein, a<br>
rotary valve 106 is positioned such that a carrier gas inlet 108, the sample<br>
vessel 100, and the trap 102 are in fluid communication. Carrier gas flows<br>
from the inlet 108 to the first end 120 of the sample vessel 100. The gas<br>
enters the vessel 100 through the first end 120, flows through the adsorbent<br>
110, flows out of the vessel 100 via the inlet 130 of conduit 132, and exits<br>
through the vent 112, indicated by arrows A. In this way, moisture in the<br>
vessel 100 is purged therefrom. In certain embodiments, a valve 160 is also<br>
provided in the event a split flow is desired.<br>
[0032] A sample vessel desorption and trap load/purge step is illustrated<br>
in Figure 4. As shown therein, a diverter valve 114 directs carrier gas from the<br>
inlet 108 to the second end 122 of the sample vessel 100. The carrier gas<br>
flows into the vessel 100 via the outlet 134 of the conduit 136, through the<br>
adsorbent 110, out through the first end 120 of the vessel 100, and into the<br>
trap 102, indicated by arrows B. In this way, the carrier gas, sweeps up the<br>
analytes as they are desorbed from the adsorbent 110 and carries them into<br><br><br>
the trap 102. The adsorbent 140 in the trap 102 adsorbs the analytes, and the<br>
carrier gas flows out of the trap 102 via the inlet 150 of the conduit 152 and<br>
exits through the vent 142, also indicated by arrows B.<br>
[0033] A trap desorption step is illustrated in Figure 5. As shown<br>
therein, the rotary valve 106 is rotated and the valve 144 is opened. Carrier<br>
gas flows from the inlet 146, through the conduit 148, and into the trap 102 via<br>
the outlet 154. The gas then flows through the adsorbent 140, sweeping up<br>
the analytes as they are desorbed, and carries them out of the trap 102 and<br>
into the chromatographic column 104, indicated by arrows C.<br>
[0034] Because the sample tube 100 and the trap 102 each comprise a<br>
vessel packed with an adsorbent, either one of them, or both, could have<br>
undesired formation of channels or fines, as previously discussed. The<br>
presence of these channels and/or fines will alter the pneumatic impedance of<br>
the trap, and therefore, the system described herein checks for alterations in<br>
this impedance in order to determine whether the results of any<br>
chromatographic analysis have been degraded as a result of the integrity of<br>
the tube and/or trap being compromised.<br>
[0035] This impedance measurement can be achieved by elevating the<br>
pressures in the internal flow paths of the system, as can be seen by<br>
referencing Figure 7 and measuring characteristics of the gas flowing through<br>
the vessel 100 and/or 102 and comparing the measured characteristics with<br><br>
expected values of such characteristics. Expected values of some<br>
characteristics are provided herein as examples, and it can be understood that<br>
other characteristics and/or ways of computing such expected characteristics<br>
can be varied without departing from the scope of the present teachings.<br>
[0036] For example, in one embodiment, the sorbent tubes 100, 102 can<br>
be understood to be the geometric equivalent of a short, packed, gas<br>
chromatographic column, and therefore, the permeability of the sorbent tube<br>
can be represented according to the following equation:<br><br>
The inter-particle porosity of the packing € may, in turn, be represented<br>
according to the following equation:<br><br><br>
The gas velocity at the tube outlet u0 can be represented by rearranging<br>
Equation 1 as follows:<br><br>
Because pi ≈ po, Equation 3 may be further simplified as follows:<br><br>
Accordingly, it is established that the velocity through the sorbent tube is<br>
proportional to the pressure difference across it. <br>
[0037] The volumetric flow rate at the tube outlet can be represented<br>
according to the following equation: <br><br>
Where Ai, is the inter-particle area. The inter-particle-to-open-tube-area ratio<br>
should be the same as the volumetric ratio (which, according to Equation 2, is<br>
equal to the packing porosity), as shown in the following equation:<br><br><br>
Where Ac is the cross sectional area of the empty tube. Therefore, the inter-<br>
particle area Ai can be represented as follows:<br><br>
Thus, the substitution of Equation 7 into Equation 5 yields the following<br>
representation of the volumetric flow rate:<br><br>
Because the cross-sectional area of a cylindrical tube Ac is equal to <br>
Equation 8 becomes:<br><br>
[0038] Substituting the gas velocity at the tube outlet u0 of Equation 4<br>
into Equation 9 yields the following representation of the volumetric flow rate:<br><br>
For a given tube at constant temperature, B°, dc, η and L should all be<br>
constant, which can collectively be represented by the constant k, yielding the<br>
following equation:<br><br><br>
Where k is a constant and equal to . Accordingly, expressing<br>
equation 11 in terms of k allows for a characterization of the tube in terms of<br>
unit flow per unit pressure drop for a given temperature, k can thus be<br>
understood to be a geometric measure of the tube rather than the ambient<br>
conditions to which the tube is exposed. With further reference to Equation<br>
11, once a differential pressure of the adsorbent material is obtained using, for<br>
example, one or more sensors, such differential pressure can be related to<br>
the flow rate at the output of the tube to characterize the tube based on a unit<br>
flow per unit pressure drop.<br>
[0039] The value of Fo in Equation 11 would represent the flow rate at<br>
pressure po. Normally, flow rates are expressed assuming ambient conditions<br>
(e.g. Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure at 25°C and 100kPa).<br>
Accordingly, a correction may be made in accordance with the following<br>
equation:<br><br><br>
Accordingly, Equation 11 becomes the following equation:<br><br>
[0040] As provided herein, the constant k is a geometric measure of the<br>
tube as it is based on the geometry of the particular tube (L and dc) and<br>
specific permeability of the packing therein (S°). Therefore, constant k may be<br>
called the "permeability factor "of a sorbent tube. Once the value of k is known<br>
for a given tube, the flow rate for a given pressure drop across the tube, or the<br>
pressure drop for a given flow rate, may be calculated according to Equation<br>
13.<br>
[0041] Accordingly, there are several ways that an alteration in the<br>
impedance of the tubes 100, 102 can be determined, some of which are<br>
illustrated in Figures 6A-F. For example, in some embodiments, this<br>
determination is made by measuring the pressure drop across the tube while<br>
carrier gas flows through the tube at a known flow rate. Typical flow rates<br>
employed for this purpose fall in the range of about 20 mL/min to about 200<br>
mL/min, and in some embodiments, more specifically around 50 mL/min,<br>
although such example flow rates are provided for illustration and not<br>
limitation.<br>
[0042] As illustrated in Figure 6A, in some embodiments, a flow<br>
controller 200, such as an electronic mass flow controller, is placed in the flow<br><br><br>
path of the carrier gas in order to control the flow rate of the gas, and a<br>
differential pressure transducer 202 is placed in communication with the flow<br>
path to provide pressure measurements to measure the pressure drop across<br>
the tube 102, which in some embodiments can include sensors at the inlet or<br>
outlet of the tube to derive the pressure drop by subtraction. A forward<br>
pressure regulator 230 can be used to deliver carrier gas at a known and<br>
consistent pressure to the tube. A pressure transducer 206 can be included in<br>
the circuit either upstream (as shown) or downstream of the tube to provide the<br>
absolute or gauge pressure of the gas within the tube to allow calculation of<br>
the gas flow rate at the tube exit at the applied pressure. In instances where<br>
the measurement is being made at a temperature other than ambient, a<br>
temperature sensor 233 held proximal to the tube is used to calculate the gas<br>
flow rate at the tube exit at the temperature applied there. While in certain<br>
embodiments, the flow controller 200 is placed downstream of the vessel 102,<br>
in some embodiments, as illustrated in Figure 6B, a flow controller 204 is<br>
placed upstream of the vessel 102. As also shown therein, in some<br>
embodiments, a first transducer 206 is placed approximate the vessel inlet,<br>
and a second transducer 208 is placed approximate the vessel outlet, to<br>
provide measurements associated with the absolute or gauge pressure at the<br>
that point and the pressure difference across the vessel, although it can be<br>
understood that the positioning of such transducers 206, 208 may vary based<br>
on the transducer type, the application, and other design choices. As<br>
illustrated in Figure 6C, in still other embodiments, only pressure transducer<br><br><br>
206 is used, and a valve 220 is provided to vent the gas exiting the vessel<br>
outlet to the atmosphere at atmospheric pressure. A single gauge pressure r !transducer 206 is used to provide a measure of both the pressure inside the <br>
tube and the pressure drop across it.<br>
[0043] In some embodiments, however, the pressure drop is known,<br>
controlled, and applied, and the flow rate is instead detected in order to<br>
measure the impedance of the vessel 102. For example, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 6D, in some of these embodiments, a forward pressure regulator 230 is<br>
placed in the flow path between the carrier gas inlet and the vessel inlet, and a<br>
back pressure regulator 232 is placed in the flow path between the vessel<br>
outlet and the chromatographic column in order to establish the pressure drop<br>
across the vessel 102. A flow sensor 240 is then positioned at a convenient<br>
point within in the flow path in order to measure the flow rate of the gas. In<br>
embodiments, as shown in Figure 6E, only the forward pressure regulator 230<br>
is employed, and the valve 220, which is positioned between the vessel outlet<br>
and the chromatographic column, vents the gas to atmosphere at atmospheric<br>
pressure. As shown in Figure 6F, in some of these embodiments that use<br>
pressure regulators to establish the pressure drop, a differential pressure<br>
transducer 202 is placed in communication with the flow path adjacent the<br>
vessel inlet and outlet in order to verify the pressure drop established by the<br>
pressure regulator 230 and the regulator 232 or valve 220.<br><br><br>
[0044] In these ways, changes in the pneumatic impedance of sorbent<br>
tubes can be detected as part of the chromatographic analysis, both for tubes<br>
employed as adsorbent traps, where the aging effects on the integrity of the<br>
packing is of particular concern, and for sample tubes used to collect and<br>
supply the sample for analysis, where variations from tube to tube can<br>
otherwise prove problematic. In embodiments, the specific method of<br>
measurement is standardized so that meaningful results can be obtained so<br>
that the tube impedance can be tracked over the life of the tube. Further, in<br>
embodiments, the tube is kept at ambient temperature (typically in the range of<br>
about 20 to about 25 degrees Celsius) during measurement in order to reduce<br>
error.<br>
[0045] It should be understood that the foregoing is illustrative and not<br>
limiting, and that obvious modifications may be made by those skilled in the art<br>
without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, throughout the<br>
entirety of the present disclosure, use of the articles "a" or "an" to modify a<br>
noun can be understood to be used for convenience and to include one, or<br>
more than one of the modified noun, unless otherwise specifically stated.<br>
Further, although the illustrated examples include a sorbent "tube", it can be<br>
understood that the present teachings are not limited to a vessel having a<br>
particular cross section, and the methods and systems are applicable to<br>
different size and shaped vessels having an adsorbent material contained<br>
and/or disposed therein. Accordingly, reference should be made primarily to<br><br>
