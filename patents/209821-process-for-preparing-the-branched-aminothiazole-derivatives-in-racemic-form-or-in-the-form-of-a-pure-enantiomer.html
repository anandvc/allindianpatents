"PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE BRANCHED AMINOTHIAZOLE DERIVATIVES IN RACEMIC FORM OR IN THE FORM OF A PURE ENANTIOMER"<br>
SANOFI-SYNTHELABO, of 174, Avenue de France, F-75013 Paris, France<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
Original          17-10-2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel branched aminothiazole derivatives, to a process for preparing them and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. These novel thiazole derivatives have antagonist activity towards CRF (corticotropin releasing factor) and can thus constitute active principles for pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a peptide whose sequence of 41 amino acids was characterized by W. Vale et al. in 1981 (Science, 1981, 213, 1394-1397). CRF is the main endogenous factor involved in regulating the hypothalamo-hypophyso-adrenal axis (release of adrenocorticotropic hormone: ACTH) and its pathologies, as well as in the depressive syndromes arising therefrom. CRF also brings about the secretion of p-endorphin, p*-lipotropin and corticosterone. CRF is thus the physiological regulator of the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and more generally of peptides derived from propiomelanocortin (POMC). Besides its location in the hypothalamus, CRF is also widely distributed in the central nervous system, as well as in extra-neuronal tissues such as the adrenal glands and the testicles. The presence of CRF has also been demonstrated in the course of inflammatory processes.<br><br>
Numerous animal experiments have shown that the central administration of CRF causes various anxiogenic effects such as modification of the behaviour in general: for example neophobia, reduction in sexual receptivity, decrease in food consumption and in slow-wave  sleep in rats. The intracerebroventricular injection of CRF also increases' the excitation of the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus which is often associated in animals with a state of anxiety. In rats, the central or peripheral administration of CRF or of similar peptides (for example urocortine or sauvagine) induces, in addition to central effects such as heightening consciousness and emotional reactivity towards the environment, modifications in gastric drainage, in acid secretion, in intestinal transit and in faecal excretion, as well as tension effects. CRF is also involved in the complex regulation of inflammatory responses, firstly with a pro-inflammatory role in certain animal models, and secondly as an inhibitor of the effects induced by increasing the vascular permeability following inflammation.<br>
The use of a peptide antagonist, alpha-helical CRF(9-41) (a-CRF) or of specific antibodies (Rivier J. et al., Science, 1984, 224, 889-891) confirms the role of this peptide in all of these effects. These experiments also confirmed the important role of CRF in man in the integration of the complex<br><br>
responses observed during a physiological, psychological or immunological stress both in neuroendocrinal and visceral as well as behavioural terms (Morley J.E. et al., Endocrine Review, 1987, 8, 3, 256-287; Smith M.A. et al., Horm. Res., 1989, 31, 66-71). In addition, clinical data argue in favour of the effective involvement of CRF in the many disorders resulting from a condition of stress (Gulley L.R. et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry, 1993, 54, 1, (suppl.), 16-19), for example:<br>
-	the existence of the CRF test (i.v. administration) in man has made it possible to demonstrate the modification of the ACTH response in depressive patients (Breier A. et al., Am. J. Psychiatry, 1987, 144, 1419-1425),<br>
-	the discovery of a hypersecretion of endogenous CRF in certain pathologies, for example an elevated level of CRF in the cephalorrachidian fluid in non-medicated patients who are depressed or suffering from a dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (Nemeroff C.B. et al., Science, 1984, 226, 4680, 1342-1343; Regul. Pept., 1989, 25, 123-130), or a decreased density of CRF receptors in the cortex of suicide victims (Nemeroff C.B. et al., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 1988, 45, 577-579),<br>
-	the dysfunctioning of CRF-dependent neurons is even suggested in severe pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and<br><br><br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (De Souza E.B., Hospital Practice, 1988, 23, 59).<br>
The central administration of CRF in many animal species produces behavioural effects similar to those obtained in man under stress conditions. When they are repeated over time, these effects may result in various pathologies such as: fatigue, hypertension, cardiac and tension disorders, modification of gastric drainage or of faecal excretion (colitis, irritable bowel), modification of acid secretion, hyperglycaemia, retarded growth, anorexia, neophobia, migraines, reproductive disorders, immunosuppression (inflammatory processes, multiple infections and cancers) and various neuropsychiatric disorders (depression, anorexia nervosa and anxiety).<br>
The intracerebroventricular injection of the reference peptide antagonist, a-CRF, prevents the effects obtained either by administration of exogenous CRF or by the use of stress-inducing agents (ether, restraint, noise, electric shock, ethanol withdrawal symptoms or surgery) which are capable by themselves of inducing an increase in the level of endogenous CRF. These results are confirmed by the study of many antagonist peptide molecules that are structurally similar to CRF and that have a prolonged duration of action relative to a-CRF (Rivier J. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1993, 36, 2851-2859; Menzaghi F. et al., J.<br><br><br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1994, 269, 2, 564-572; Hernandez J.F. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1993, 36, 2860-2867).<br>
Such CRF-antagonist peptide compounds are described, for example, in US patents 5 109 111,    5 132 111 and 5 245 009 and in patent applications WO 92/22576 and WO 96/19499.<br>
In addition, preliminary studies have shown that tricyclic antidepressants can modulate the level of CRF as well as the number of CRF receptors in the brain (Grigoriadis D.E. et al.,<br>
Neuropsychopharmacology, 1989, 2, 53-60). Similarly, benzodiazepine anxiolytic agents are capable of reversing the effect of CRF (Britton K.T. et al., Psychopharmacology, 1988, 94, 306), although the mechanism of action of these substances has not been entirely elucidated. These results reinforce, if necessary, the growing need for non-peptide antagonist molecules for CRF receptors.<br>
It is also important to point out three possible consequences of conditions of chronic stress, namely immunodepression, fertility disorders and the development of diabetes.<br>
CRF exerts such effects by interacting with specific membrane receptors which have been characterized in the pituitary gland and the brain of many species (mice, rats and man) as well as in the<br><br><br><br>
heart, the skeletal muscle (rats and mice) and in the myometrium and the placenta during pregnancy.<br>
A large number of 2-aminothiazole derivatives are already known, patent application EP 462 264 describes 2-aminothiazole derivatives, in which the tertiary amine in position 2 comprises two substituents each containing at least one hetero atom including an amine derivative. These compounds are platelet activation factor antagonists (PAF-acether) and find their applications in the treatment of asthma, certain allergic or inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and various renal pathologies, or alternatively as contraceptive agents.<br>
Patent application GB 2 022 285 describes compounds with regulatory activity on the immune<br>
response and with anti-inflammatory properties. These<br>
are thiazole derivatives substituted in position 2 with<br>
secondary amine groups.<br>
Certain 2-acylaminothiazole derivatives have<br>
been described in patent application EP 432 040. These<br>
compounds are antagonists of cholecystokinin and<br>
gastrin.<br>
2-Amino-4,5-diphenylthiazole derivatives with<br>
anti-inflammatory properties are also known (patent<br>
application JP-01 75 475) .<br>
2-Amino-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)thiazole<br>
derivatives which are useful as synthetic intermediates<br><br><br>
for the preparation of 2,2-diarylchromenothiazole derivatives are also known (patent application EP 205 069) .<br>
2-(N-Methyl-N-benzylamino)thiazole derivatives are also described in J. Chem. Soc. Perkin, Trans. 1, 1984, 2, 147-153 and in J. Chem. Soc. Perkin, Trans. 1, 1983, 2, 341-347.<br>
Patent application WO 94/01423 describes 2-aminothiazole derivatives. These compounds are used as insecticides; .they carry no substitution in position 5 of the heterocycle.<br>
Similarly, patent application WO 96/16650 describes compounds derived from 2-aminothiazole. These compounds are used as antibiotics.<br>
Patent application EP 283 390 describes, among other thiazole derivatives, 2-(N-alkyl-N-pyridylalkylamino)thiazole derivatives in which the amine in position 2 is substituted with an unbranched pyridylalkyl radical.<br>
These compounds in particular have stimulatory activity on central cholinergic transmission. They can thus be used as muscarine receptor agonists and find their applications in the treatment of memory disorders and senile dementias.<br>
2-Aminothiazole derivatives in which the amine in position 2 is a tertiary amine bearing a branched alkyl or aralkyl substituent have been<br><br><br>
described in EP 576 350 and in EP 659 747 as having affinity for the CRF receptors. None of these compounds carries a substituted phenyl as a substituent of the tertiary amine in position 2 of the thiazole nucleus.<br>
US patent 5 063 245 describes CRF antagonists which allow the in  vitro  displacement.of the binding of CRF to its specific receptors at a concentration in the region of one micromole. Numerous patent applications regarding non-peptide molecules have since been published, for example patent applications WO 94/13643, WO 94/13644, WO 94/13661, WO 94/13676, WO 94/13677, WO 94/10333, WO 95/00640, WO 95/10506, WO 95/13372, WO 95/33727, WO 95/33750, WO 95/34563, EP 691 128 or EP 729 758.<br>
It has now been found according to the present invention that certain branched aminothiazole derivatives, which are the subject of the present invention, have excellent affinity towards CRF receptors. Furthermore, given their structure, these molecules have good dispersibility and/or solubility in solvents or solutions commonly used therapeutically which gives them pharmacological activity, and also allow the easy preparation of oral and parenteral pharmaceutical forms.<br>
This is surprising and unexpected, since the compounds of the invention are more active in  vivo  than compounds of similar structure, in particular by a more<br><br><br>
significant inhibition of the response induced by CRF in the hypothalamo-hypophyso-adrenal axis.<br>

The compounds of the invention in free form generally have weakly basic properties. However, depending on the nature of the substituents, some of them may show acidic properties.<br>
The salts of the compounds of formula (I) with pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases (when this is possible) are the preferred salts, but those which may allow the compounds of formula (I) to be isolated, in particular to be purified or to obtain pure isomers, also form a subject of the invention.<br>
Among the pharmaceutically acceptable acids for the preparation of the addition salts to the compounds of formula (I), mention may be made of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, sulphuric acid, ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulphonic acid, lactobionic acid, gluconic acid, glucaric acid, succinic acid, sulphonic acid and hydroxypropanesulphonic acid.<br>
Among the pharmaceutically acceptable bases for the preparation of the addition salts to the compounds of formula (I), when these compounds have<br><br><br><br>
acidic properties, mention may be made of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide.<br>
The compounds according to the invention and the intermediates which are useful for preparing them are prepared according to methods that are well known to those skilled in the art, in particular according to EP 576 350 and EP 659 747.<br>
The reaction scheme below illustrates one preparation process for synthesizing the compounds (I).<br><br>
According to another of its aspects, a subject of the present invention is also a process for preparing compounds of formula (I), characterized in that an alpha-halo derivative, preferably an alpha-bromo or alpha-chloro derivative, of formula (III)<br><br><br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined for (I) and Hal represents a halogen atom, preferably bromine or chlorine, is reacted with a thiourea of formula:<br><br>
in which R6 and R7 are as defined for (I), to give a compound of formula (II)<br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3, R4, R6 and R7 are as defined for (I), in order then to subject it to an alkylation reaction to give the compound (I).<br>
The alkylation reactions used in the above process are carried out under the usual conditions known to those skilled in the art, by the action of a<br><br><br>
suitable alkylating agent such as, for example, an alkenyl or alkynyl halide in the presence of a base, preferably sodium hydride.<br>
The derivatives of formula (III) can be obtained from the correponding non-halogenated ketones of formula<br><br>
in which Ri R2, R3 and R4 are as defined for (I) , either (i) by the action of bromine in a suitable organic solvent, such as acetic acid, carbon tetrachloride or diethyl ether, or (ii) by the action of quaternary ammonium tribromides according to the method described in Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 1987, 60, 1159-1160 and 2667-2668, or (iii) alternatively by the action of cupric bromide in an organic solvent, such as a mixture of chloroform and ethyl acetate, according to J. Org. Chem. 1964, 29, 3451-3461. As a variant, the compounds of formula (III) can be obtained by the action of 2-bromopropionyl bromide on a substituted benzene of formula:<br><br><br><br>
in which R1, R2 and R3 are as defined for (I) , by a Friedel-Crafts reaction.<br>
The ketones mentioned above are generally known products or commercially-available products. These compounds can be prepared by Friedel-Crafts reaction, in the presence of a Lewis acid, according to methods that are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The thiourea derivatives (IV) are obtained from protected thiourea derivatives (V)<br><br>
in which Prot represents a protecting group, for example benzoyl or pivaloyl, R6 and R7 being as defined previously for (I) , either by a basic treatment, preferably using aqueous ammonia, sodium hydroxide or hydrazine at a temperature ranging from room temperature to the reflux point of the reaction mixture, or by means of an acid treatment preferably using hydrochloric acid.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (V) are prepared by-reacting, according to known methods, an isothiocyanate, for example a benzoyl isothiocyanate or a pivaloyl isothiocyanate, with the corresponding amines of formula (VI):<br>
H2N-CHR6R7	(VI)<br>
in which R6 and R7 are as defined for (I) .<br>
The preparation of the optically active aminothiazoles, i.e. the products in the form of pure enantiomers, is carried out starting with optically active primary amines according to Scheme 2 below by a process which is identical to that described above.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) above also comprise those in which one or more hydrogen or carbon acorns have been replaced with their radioactive<br><br>
isotope, for example tritium or carbon-14. Such labelled compounds are useful in research, metabolism or pharmacokinetic studies, or alternatively in biochemical assays as receptor ligands.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have undergone biochemical and pharmacological studies. They show highly advantageous pharmacological properties. The compounds of the invention displace, at concentrations of less than 10 \M,   the binding of CRF or of related iodinated peptides (urotensine, sauvagine) , for example 125I-tyrosine CRF, to the receptors present on brain membranes or on cells in culture, according to the method described by E.B. De Souza (J. Neurosci., 1987, 7, 1, 88-100).<br>
The antagonist activity of the compounds according to the invention was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit certain activities associated with CRF. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) are capable of inhibiting the secretion of<br>
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) induced by CRF. The study on the secretion of ACTH induced by CRF was carried out, in vivo  on conscious rats, according to a method adapted from C. Rivier et al., Endocrinology, 1982, 110 (1), 272-278.<br>
CRF is a neuropeptide which controls the activity of the hypothalamo-hypophyso-adrenal axis.<br><br><br>
The invention also extends to pharmaceutical compositions containing, as active principle, a compound of formula (I) or one of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, optionally in combination with one or more inert and suitable excipients.<br>
In each dosage unit, the active principle of formula (I) is present in amounts that are suited to the daily doses envisaged. Each dosage unit is appropriately adjusted according to the dosage and the type of administration envisaged, for example tablets, gel capsules and the like, sachets, ampoules, syrups and the like, drops, transdermal or transmucosal patches, such that such a dosage unit contains 0.5 mg to 80D mg of active principle, preferably 0.5 mg to 200 mg.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in combination with another active principle which is useful for the desired treatment, such as, for example, anxiolytic agents, antidepressants or anorexigenic agents.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are relatively non-toxic; their toxicity is compatible with their use as medicinal products for treating the above disorders and diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions for<br><br><br>
administration to mammals, including man, for the treatment of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions thus obtained are advantageously in various forms such as, for example, injectable or drinkable solutions, sugar-coated tablets, tablets or gel capsules. The pharmaceutical compositions containing, as active principle, at least one compound of formula (I) or one of the salts thereof are useful in particular for preventively or curatively treating stress-related conditions and more generally in the treatment of any pathology involving CRF, such as, for example: Cushing's disease, neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, panic, obessive compulsive disorders, mood disorders, post-traumatic stress, behavioural disorders, aggressiveness, anorexia, bulimia, hyperglycaemia, premature labour, at-risk pregnancy, retarded growth, sleeping disorders, epilepsy, and all types of depression; Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; vascular, cardiac and cerebral disorders; sexual activity disorders and fertility disorders; immunodepression, immunosuppression, inflammatory processes, multiple infections, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, uveitis, psoriasis and diabetes; cancers; gastrointestinal functional disorders and inflammations<br><br><br>
arising therefrom (irritable and inflammatory bowel, diarrhoea); pain-perception disorders, fibromyalgias which may or may not be associated with sleeping disorders, fatigue or migraine;, symptoms associated with (alcohol) dependency and withdrawal from drugs.<br>
The dosage can vary widely as a function of the age, weight and state of health of the patient, the nature and seriousness of the complaint, as well as the route of administration. This dosage comprises the daily administration of one or more doses of approximately from 0.5 mg to 800 mg, preferably approximately from 0.5 mg to 200 mg.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, transmucosal, local or rectal administration, the active principle can be administered in unit forms of administration, as a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical supports, to animals and to human beings. The appropriate unit forms of administration comprise oral-route forms such as tablets, gel capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, sublingual and buccal administration forms, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal or intraocular administration forms and rectal administration forms.<br>
When a solid composition is prepared in the form of tablets, the main active principle is mixed<br><br><br>
with a pharmaceutical vehicle such as gelatin, starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arabic or the like. The tablets can be coated with sucrose or other suitable materials, or alternatively they can be treated such that they have sustained or delayed activity and such that they continuously release a predetermined amount of active principle.<br>
A preparation as gel capsules is obtained by mixing the active principle with a diluent and pouring the mixture obtained into soft or hard gel capsules. A preparation in  syrup or elixir form can contain the active principle together with a sweetener, preferably a calorie-free sweetener, methyl paraben and propyl paraben as antiseptic agents, as well as a flavour enhancer and a suitable colorant.<br>
The water-dispersible powders or granules can contain the active principle as a mixture with dispersants or wetting agents, or suspending agents, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, as well as with sweeteners or flavour enhancers.<br>
For rectal administration, use is made of suppositories which are prepared with binders that melt at the rectal temperature, for example cocoa butter or polyethylene glycols.<br>
Aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions or sterile, injectable solutions which contain pharmacologically compatible dispersants and/or<br><br><br><br>
wetting agents, for example propylene glycol or butylene glycol, are used for parenteral, intranasal or intraocular administration.<br>
For transmucosal administration, the active   principle can be formulated in the presence of a promoter such as a bile salt, a hydrophilic polymer such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran,   polyvinylpyrrolidone, pectins, starches, gelatin, casein, acrylic acids, acrylic esters and copolymers thereof, vinyl polymers or copolymers, vinyl alcohols, alkoxy polymers, polyethylene oxide polymers, polyethers or a mixture thereof.<br>
The active principle can also be formulated in the form of microcapsules, optionally with one or more supports or additives.<br>
The active principle can also be in the form of a complex with a cyclodextrin, for example a-, p4- or y-cyclodextrin, 2-hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin or methyl-P-cyclodextrin.<br>
The examples which follow, which are given in a non-limiting manner, illustrate the invention.<br>
The methods for synthesizing the various intermediates for obtaining the compounds of the invention are described in the preparations. These<br><br><br>
intermediates are all obtained according to methods that are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The melting points were measured according to the Micro-Kofler technique and are expressed in degrees Celsius.<br>
The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were acquired in CDCI3 except where otherwise mentioned, at 200 MHz or at 300 MHz. The chemical shifts are expressed in p.p.m. and the coupling constants are expressed in Hertz.<br>
The enantiomeric excesses (ee) are evaluated from the chromatograms obtained either by chiral-phase HPLC chromatography or by supercritical fluid chiral (SFC) chromatography.<br>
The optical rotations of the optically active products are characterized by their [α]toD (the concentrations c of the solutions analysed are expressed in grams per 100 ml).<br>

EXAMPLE 25<br>
[4-(2-Chloro-4-methoxy-5-methylphenyl)-5-methylthiazol-2-yl]-[(1R)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methoxyethyl]prop-2-ynylamine<br>
A solution of 2.5 g (5.9 mmol) of Compound II'.1  in 30 ml of dimethylformamide is stirred at 0°C and 260 mg (6.5 mmol) of sodium hydride in 60% in oil are added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 20 minutes at 0°C, followed by addition of 0.83 ml (7.5 mmol) of an 80% solution of propargyl bromide in toluene. The reaction mixture is stirred for one hour at 10°C, followed by addition, at 0°C, of 2 ml of ethanol and then 5o ml of water. The mixture is extracted with 200 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water and then with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and then evaporated to dryness. The crude residue is chromatographed on a column of silica gel, eluting with 9/1 (v/v) cyclohexane/ethyl acetate.<br>
2.14	g of a gummy pure product are obtained;<br>
