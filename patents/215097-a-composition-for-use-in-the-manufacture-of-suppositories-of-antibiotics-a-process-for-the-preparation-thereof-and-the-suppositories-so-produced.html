COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; rule 13)<br>
"A COMPOSITION FOR USE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SUPPOSITORIES OF ANTIBIOTICS, A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF AND THE<br>
SUPPOSITORIES SO PRODUCED"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Roads, Ahmedabad - 380 015, Gujarat, India,<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the,invention and the manner in<br><br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacture of suppositories of ^<br>
i antibiotics, and the suppositories so produced. Suppositories of the present invention are   j<br>
i<br>
useful for rectal administration of antibiotics. More particularly, the invention relates to a   I process   for   manufacture   of  third   generation   antibiotics   suppositories   such   as    | Cephalosporins. Background of the invention:<br>
Cefotaxime Sodium and other associated third generation Cephalosporins are not absorbed orally and therefore, these antibiotics at present are administered only by injection. This route of administration may not be acceptable or feasible to all patients due to a variety of reasons. The present invention describes a process to make suppositories of such third generation Cephalosporins and thereby solve the problems associated with the injection based administration. Object of the invention:<br>
Suppositories for systemic administration have the following advantages: they require no medical assistance when administered as in the case of injections; they can be easily administered even in case of emergency at night, they give no pain when administered and can be given easily and safely even to infants; they undergo no drug inactivation action by gastric juices, unlike oral dosage and they exert no irritation action on Gastro Intestinal tracts; they can be administered to patients to whom oral administration is impossible; they will be very useful in the rural areas where no medical facilities are available.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition as well as method of producing Cefotaxime and other associated third generation Cephalosporins in the form of suppositories which make it possible to achieve the effective absorption of antibiotics without relying on the disadvantageous administration method as mentioned above. Summary of the Invention:<br>
Suppositories for administration of various medicines are known in the prior art. The present invention provides a novel composition as well as process for producing suppositories of Cefotaxime and other associated third generation Cephalosporins which comprises combining the said antibiotic with dispersing agent and moulding into suppository.  Preferably, the antibiotic may be mixed with diluents, disintegrating agents,<br>
2<br><br>
lubricating  agents  and  compressed  and  coated into  a pharmaceutically  acceptable antibiotic suppository. Detailed Description:<br>
Suppositories of Cefotaxime or any other third generation Cephalosporins can be prepared by either the molding or compression method. Cephalosporins that comprises combining the said antibiotic are mixed with dispersing agent and then molded into suppository. Preferably, the antibiotic may be mixed with diluents, disintegrating agents, lubricating agents and compressed and coated into a pharmaceutically acceptable antibiotic suppository. The fatty base used in the present invention includes fats and oils such as cocoa butter, olive oil, which may be used singly or in combination or semiÂ¬synthetic bases which are glycerides of hydrogenated fatty acids derived from palm-seed oils such as coconut &amp; palm kernel oils.<br>
The dispersing agents include lecithins, sodium lauryl sulphate, dioctylsodiumsulphosuccinate or polysorbates. The diluents include those usually used such as lactose, starch, dicalciumphosphate, celluloses. The distintegrating agents such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose, sodium starch glycolate, starch, crosspovidone may be used.<br>
The lubricating agents include those usually used such as stearic acid or stearates, polyethylene glycols, talc, aerosil and hydrogenated vegetable oil. Coating agents include suitable waxes such as cetyl alcohol or polyethylene glycols in suitable polymer such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or polyvinylpyrrolidene dissolved in suitable organic solvents such as isopropyl alcohol or specially denatured spirit or methanol.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a method of producing suppository of Cefotaxime of various strengths. The following examples are by of disclosure (for 500 mg &amp; 1000 mg strength) only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the claims or the invention in any manner.<br>
