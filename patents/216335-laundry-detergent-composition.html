DETERGENT COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/111175<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/(MKi0K3<br><br>

Technical Field<br><br>
5  The present inventi detergent compositi granules, anionic dissolution across<br>
on relates to a granular laundry on containing a combination of soap and nonionic surfactants giving improved a range of water hardnesses.<br><br>
10  Background of the Invention<br>
Soap is a common ingredient of detergent powder compositions.  It may be included as a detergent active, a builder or a foam suppresser.  It may be added to a slurry<br>
15  which is subsequently spray-dried, or in-situ neutralised from the fatty acid and/or dry-mixed with other particulate ingredients, including composite particles which are themselves the product of a spray-drying process or other granulation process.<br>
20<br>
To formulate most flexibly, it is more advantageous to dry-mix soap with the rest of the ingredients, without intermediate processing.  When supplied as a raw material for incorporating in such compositions, soap is often in the<br>
25  form of a fine dusty powder.  As well as being difficult to handle, such powders have a tendency to cause respiratory tract irritation in those working with them.  It is known to incorporate extruded or flaked soap "noodles" in detergent compositions, which have a "particle" size much greater than<br>
30  found.in the aforementioned dusty powders.  However, this is often done purely to create a visual effect, for example<br><br>
WO 2004/1111:<br><br>
PCT/EP2O04/O0Mt83<br><br>
-   ?   -<br>
when such noodles are deliberately coloured' as indictia of certain benefits.  The noodle format is also not a very cost- effective means of supplying the soap, especially when formulating dry mixed powders.<br>
Laundry detergent compositions have for many years contained anionic surfactants together with nonionic surfactants.<br><br>
It is well known that many anionic surfactants form calcium<br>
precipitates, that adhere to clothes. like sodium linear<br>
10  precipitates, that reduces their effectiveness and that may<br>
Especially much used anionic surfactants alkyl benzene sulphonate (NaLAS), and sodium primary alcohol sulphate (NaPAS).  Similarly it is know that soaps are also sensitive to calcium precipitation 15  and that it in fact soap precipitates very strongly.  It is therefore common to include builders in laundry 'formulations.<br>
Common builders are1 phosphates and zeolites.  However, 20  phosphates are not favoured because possible eutrification of waterways.  Zeolites are insoluble and might leave residues to clothes.<br><br>
25<br><br>
Mixtures of anionic and non-ionic surfactants are less prone to form calcium precipitates, and these mixtures are applied in many European Countries.  However, common nonionic surfactants are more liquid-like and are consequently more difficult to process into solid, non-sticky laundry products.4<br><br>

ingredients at the granule and in the<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that although the soap and the anionics precipitate very strongly on their own, and they also precipitate when the anionic and the soap are combined together.  When soaps, anionics and nonionics are used in the specific levels and in the specific format detailed in the invention, for example the addition of the majority of the soap granules to the rest of the detergent<br>
anionic surfactant combination.  This<br>
post dosing stage as a dry-mix soap form of highly concentrated granules, this results in the tendency to precipitate in hard .water being lower than for formulations containing only the<br>
, only the soap	or the anionic and soap in<br>
advantageously	enables the reduction of<br>
nonionic and builder requirements	in such a composition for<br>
the prevention of precipitates.<br><br>

The soap (i)<br>
According to the in'vention-from 5 to 85 wt I, preferably 7<br>
i to 60 wt %, more preferably 10 to 35 wt % of the surfactant<br>
5  system comprises from 20 to 50 wt % of a soap.  Preferably<br>
the surfactant system comprises from 30 to 40 wt % of a<br>
soap.<br>
In a preferred emboaiment of the invention from 80 wt % to 10  100 wt %, preferably from 85 to 95.wt % of the soap is present in the form of granules.<br>
The laundry detergent compositions of the current invention comprise a soap granule which has a concentration of soap of 15  at least 75 wt % based on the weight of the composition.  In<br>
a preferred embodiment of the invention the soap granule has<br>
i<br>
a concentration of|soap of from 80 to 95 wt %, preferably<br>
i<br>
from 85 to 90 wt V.     Preferably the soap granules contain more than 90 wt % soap, less than 10 wt % moisture and less<br><br>
20  than 1 wt % sodium<br><br>
hydroxide.<br><br>
Useful soap compounds include the alkali metal soaps such as<br>
the sodium, potass (for example monoe<br>
;ium, ammonium and substituted ammonium :thanolamine) salts or any combinations of 25  this, of higher fatty acids containing from about 8 to 24 carbon atoms.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention he fatty acid soap has a carbon chain length of from Cio to C22. more<br>

Suitable fatty acids can be obtained from natural sources such as plant or animal esters e.g. palm oil, coconut oil, babassu oil, soybean oil, caster oil, rape seed oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, tallow, fish oils, grease lard and mixtures thereof.  Also fatty acids can be produced by synthetic means such as the oxidation of petroleum, or hydrogenation of carbon monoxide by the Fischer Tropsch process.  Resin acids are suitable such as rosin and those resin acids in tall oil.  Naphthenic acids are also suitable.  Sodium and potassium soaps can be made by direct saponification of the fats and oils or by the neutralisation of the free fatty acids which are prepared in a separate manufacturing process.  Particularly useful are the sodium and potassium salts and the mixtures of fatty acids derived from coconut oil and tallow, i.e. sodium tallow soap, sodium coconut soap, potassium tallow soap, potassium coconut soap. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the soap is a fatty acid soap.  In a further preferred embodiment of the invention the fatty acid soap is' a lauric soap.  For example Prifac 5908 .a fatty acid from Uniqema which was neutralised<br><br>
with caustic soda.<br><br>
This soap is an example of a fully<br><br>
hardened or saturated lauric soap, which in general is based<br><br>
on coconut or palm<br><br>
kernel oil.<br><br>
In preferred embodiment of the invention the soap is saturated.  Also hardened or unsaturated lauric soaps based on coconut or palm kernel oil can be used.  These soaps consist mainly of laurate with 12 carbon atoms, and myristate with 14  carbon atoms.  Also mixtures of coconut or palm kernel oil and for example palm oil, olive oil, or tallow can be used.  In this case more paimitate with 16<br><br>

Preferably the soap does not stand out from the rest of the ingredients.  It therefore needs to be whitish, and more or less round namely with an aspect ratio of less than 2. This ensures that the laundry powder in its final format is 10  free-flowing and cDntaining a soap granule means that it is<br><br>
congruent with the<br><br>
rest of the composition.<br><br><br><br>
0 to 650 g/litre, and the bulk density of ed powders are from 400 to 900 g/litre.<br>

In a preferred embodiment he soap has a particle size of from 400 to 1400 pm, preferably 500 to 1200 um.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the soap granule has a bulk density of from 40 the fully formulat<br><br>
20  Fabric washing powders containing major quantities of soap are favoured by some consumers because of good detergency, and the tendency to leave clothes feeling softer than those washed with powders based on synthetic detergent-active compounds.  Soap also has environmental advantages in that<br>
25  it is fully biodegradable, and is a natural material derived from renewable raw( materials.<br>
Saturated sodium soaps have high Krafft temperatures and consequently dissolve poorly at low temperatures, which are 30  applied by some consumers.  It is well known that certain mixtures of saturated and unsaturated soaps have much lower<br><br>

properties.  The stability of the soap is enhanced when it<br><br>
is concentrated in<br><br>
granules; compared to soap that is<br><br>
incorporated at low, concentration into composite granules.<br>
The soap may be used in combination with a suitable antioxidant for example ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and/or ethane-1-hydroxy-l', 1-diphosphonic acid.  Also preservatives may be present to prevent degradation of the soap with can result in malodour or discolouration for ex-ample sodium hydrpxyethlidene disphosphonic acid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the soap granule is post dosed.<br>
The anionic surfactant (ii)<br><br>
Anionic surfactants are well known to those skilled in the art.  Examples include alkylbenzene sulphonates, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl<br>
chain length of C8-C15; primary and secondary alkylsulphates,<br>
particularly C8-C20<br>
primary alkyl sulphates; alkyl ether<br>
sulphates; olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and fatty acid ester sulphonates. Sodium salts are generally preferred.<br><br>

■ - 19 -Form of the composiition<br>
The compositions of the invention may be.of any suitable physical form, for ;example, particulates (powders, granules, 5  tablets), liquids, pastes, gels or bars.<br>
Preferably the detergent composition is in granular form.<br>
The composition can be formulated for use as hand wash or 10  machine wash detergents.<br>
Preparation of the compositions<br>
Soap can be made in several ways and is well known.  For 15  example it can be made by neutralising fatty acid with caustic.  The excess water is then dried by for example spray-drying or flash-drying.  Most processes result in dusty powders or flakes of neutralised soap.  To transform the powder to granules with appropriate particle size and 20  form, an additional step is required.  This could be<br>
granulation with or without a binder in high shear or low shear granulators., It could also be done by extrusion, complemented by rounding off the particles.  Flakes could be milled and sieved,i or also extruded and rounded.  Soap 25  granules that are made on a VRV flash-drier are suitable. This equipment combines drying and granulation in one step. Commercial soap granules made on VRV equipment is available from Uniqema under the name Prisavon.<br>
30  The compositions of the invention may be prepared by any suitable process.<br><br>
WO 20(14/111175<br><br>
PCT/EP2<mu></mu><br>
- 20 -<br>
Suitable processes for the production of compositions in powder form include:<br>
(1)	drum drying of principal ingredients, optionally<br>
5       followed by granulation or postdosing of additional ingredients;<br>
Dry mixing is a common process in powdery laundry products. Generally, several ingredients in granule or particulate<br>
10  form, including separately prepared granules, base powders and otherwise encapsulated ingredients are added to a low shear mixer (e.g. rotating drum mixer), where the ingredients are well mixed. Some ingredients may be sprayed on at this stage (e.g. perfumes).  The mixture is then ready<br>
15  for packaging (powders) or tabletting (tablets).  Other<br>
possible alternative is granulating the soap with some other ingredients in an intermediate step before dry-mixing, but this is not preferred.  This last method is common practice (fatty acid is commonly granulated with other surfactants,<br>
20 builder etc. in a base powder, and is in-situ neutralized with caustic soda (or sodium carbonate to soap), but this reduces the flexibility to formulate.<br>
(2)	non-tower granulation of all ingredients in a high-<br>
25  speed mixer/granulator, for example, a Fukae (Trade Mark) FS series mixer, preferably with at least one surfactant in paste form so that the water in the surfactant paste can act as a binder;<br><br>
WO 20(14/111175<br><br>
PCT/EP20IU/006IIX3<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
(3)  non-tower granulation in a high speed/moderate speed<br>
i granulator combination, thin film flash drier/evaporator or<br>
fluid bed granulator<br>
5  Powders of low to moderate bulk' density may be prepared by spray-drying a' slurry, and optionally postdosing (dry-mixing) further ingredients.  "Concentrated" or "compact" powders may be prepa'red by mixing and granulating processes, for example, using a high-speed mixer/granulator, or other 10' non-tower processes<br>
Tablets may be prepared by compacting powders, especially "concentrated" powders.<br>
15  Liquid detergent compositions may be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients in any desired order to provide compositions containing the ingredients in the requisite concentrations.<br>
20  The choice of processing route may be in part dictated by the stability or heat-sensitivity of the surfactants involved, and the form in which they are available.<br>
In all cases, ingredients such as enzymes, bleach 25  ingredients, sequestrants, polymers and perfumes may be added separately.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention there is providec<br>
the use of a laundry detergent composition as claimed in an;<br>
30  preceding claim, ^herein the water hardness is from 10 to 4(<br><br>
WO 2004/111175<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/006083<br><br>
degrees of French hardness, preferably 16 to 32 degrees of French hardness.<br>
Examples<br>
5<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated by the following, non-limiting examples, in which parts and percentages are bv weiaht.<br>
10  In the table below, ithe turbidity of several surfactant<br>
f mixtures was measured, at different water hardnesses. The<br>
!<br>
soap was a fully saturated lauric soap granule based on Prifac 5808 from Uniqema, LAS was the anionic surfactant and Neodol 23 5E.from Shell, namely a C12 to C15 poly (1 to 6)<br>
15  ethoxylate with an average degree of ethoxylation of 5, was the nonionic surfactant.  Turbidity is a measure of how many precipitates are formed by the surfactant mixture when calcium ions are present. ■ The turbidity should be lower than 0.1.<br>
20<br>
The  turbidity of a (surfactant  solution  is measured by the<br>
i<br>
absorption of light1 when passing through the solution.  Here<br>
i<br>
the absorption was 'measured with a spectrophotometer<br>
i<br>
{Labsystem Multiscanb MS) at 1 wavelength (540 nm).  The 25  equipment was calibrated with millipore water (turbidity = 0) and no light transmittance (turbidity = 1).  The solutions were made by dissolving the surfactants in millipore water.  The hardness was provided by CaC1.2H20 and MgC1.6H20, such that the ratio of calcium to magnesium ions 30  was 4:1.  In all cases, 1.008 g/1 surfactant, was present. The solutions werei well stirred.  The experiments were<br><br>
WO 2004/111175	PCT/EP2004/1MI6083<br>
- 23 -<br>
carried out at room temperature, and the final values for<br>
i turbidity are an average of 4  repeats.<br>
As can be seen, formulations that fall within the limits 5  indicated according to the invention, examples 1 to 7 show' little turbidity.  Formulations that fall outside the invention, comparative examples A to D, especially those that contain more than more than 50 wt % total anionic show high turbidity.<br><br>
