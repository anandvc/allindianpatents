WINDSCREEN WIPER SYSTEM. PARTICULARLY FOR A MOTOR VEHICLE<br>
Prior Art<br>
The invention emanates from a windscreen wiper system, particularly for a motor vehicle according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Innumerable windscreen wiper systems for motor vehicles, which have a propulsion element that is affixed to the car's body, have already been established. Such types of propulsion elements are, typically, screwed on tightly to the car's body which is, however, very complex and requires many parts such as screws, nuts and washers etc. This is logistically elaborate and, moreover, complex during installation. Over and above this, a windscreen wiper is established in DE 100 62 617 A1 that is stuck to the motor vehicle, whereby the adhesive exhibits muting characteristics.<br>
A windscreen wiper unit for vehicles, particularly for motor vehicles, that enables execution that is free of screw joints and is thus simple and quick, is established in DE 198 33 404 A1. The windscreen wiper unit exhibits a supporting construction for a drive device to this effect. A number of first fixing elements are provided at the supporting construction that project in a first direction from the supporting construction. A number of second fixing elements project in a second direction that runs at an angle of between 45 and 135 degrees to the first direction, preferably at an angle of 90 degrees. The fixing elements are designed as cylindrical plug-in pins that are connected at one end to the supporting construction and has its other free end is inserted into a receiving port of a rubber-elastic muting element. This is inserted in the assembly port of the car's body. The assembly port can be located in an angled or deep drawn mounting link that is welded on to the car's body. The free end of the plug-in pin can have a preferred conical thickening in order to be able to fix the same firmly into the<br><br>
muting element through slots. Since the assembly directions of the first and second fixing elements run at an angle, it is not impossible that the supporting construction is subject to stress after assembly, which is then transmitted to the neighbouring parte of the car's body.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the invention, the fastening blocks that function as muting elements are made from a rubber-elastic material. They are affixed at the propulsion element and located in such a manner that they can be inserted into the receiving ports in a first assembly direction and overlap the rim of the receiving ports with slots through a movement in a second assembly direction, at a right angle to the first. The slots of all fastening blocks and the receiving ports lie at one level or at levels that are parallel to one another, displaced in a first assembly direction. The fastening blocks hold the propulsion element firmly in the receiving ports with its slots while an arresting element secures the final position of the fastening blocks in the second assembly direction and thus prevents the fastening blocks from moving back after assembly in the second assembly direction and coming loose. The receiving port can be formed directly by an opening in the car body's sheet metal or in a bracket that is placed on the car body i.e., welded.<br>
The second assembly direction runs at a level that is diagonal to the first assembly direction. In order that the output shaft of the propulsion element basically retains its position during this movement, it is advisable that the same also runs in the first assembly direction and that the fixing elements are basically located tangential to a circle or to a concentric circle around the output shaft or at an axis that is basically parallel to the output shaft. The movement in the second assembly direction is then a rotary motion around the output shaft or around the parallel axis.<br><br>
The arresting element is a bolt that is oblong in cross-section and that has a muting layer at its periphery. When in the assembled condition, the bolt is inserted in an elongated hole in the propulsion element and in an assembly port of the car's body. The elongated hole and the assembly port respectively extend at a right angle to the second assembly direction i.e., essentially radial to the output shaft, when the movement in the second assembly direction is a rotary motion around the output shaft. The muting layer lies at the rims of the elongated hole and of the assembly opening respectively in the second assembly direction, so that the propulsion element is de-linked from the car's body in accordance with vibration engineering when in an assembled condition and is fixed in this position. Clearance can be provided for tolerance equalisation in a direction diagonal to the second assembly direction.<br>
The muting layer is composed of a rubber-elastic material that is sprayed onto a harder base material of the arresting element or is placed, clipped on and, if required, affixed in any other manner as an independent component.<br>
In accordance with a design of the invention, it is proposed that the arresting element lies adjacent to the propulsion element with a flange at one end when in the assembled condition and tapers step-wise in the direction towards its other end, so that the larger cross-section that connects to the flange is plugged into the elongated hole while a narrow end engages with the assembly port of the car's body. The step lies frontally against the rim of the assembly port in the car's body. As a result, the propulsion element maintains a safe distance to the car's body in the region of the arresting element, thus avoiding the danger of a sound bridge. The muting layer of the arresting element's base material in the area of the elongated hole as well as in the area of the assembly port can thus provide cover towards the outside. It is, however, sufficient if the layer is present only in the area of the assembly port at the arresting element and provides vibration de-linking, whereas in the area of the elongated hole, the arresting<br><br>
element lies directly against the rims of the elongated hole with the base material that is advantageously an appropriate firm synthetic material. The end with the narrower cross-section is sheathed by the muting layer that, advantageously, exhibits two headings. The arresting element is thus held in the assembly port of the car's body in the manner of a clip connection and frontally covers the car body sheet metal at the rim region of the assembly port. The beadings can be pre-formed in an advantageous manner by thickening the base material. The thickenings simultaneously ensure a secure fit for the muting layer.<br>
In the case of another design of the invention, the arresting element has a spring clamp that is closed in the first assembly direction, that has a muting layer inside as well as outside and engages with the assembly port of the car's body with its closed end. At its open end, the spring clamp is connected to the propulsion element through an angled handle. Together with the spring clamp, the handles form such an angle that they compress the spring clamp in the first assembly direction during assembly of the propulsion element and that the inner muting layers lie against one another. In the second assembly direction, the outer muting layers are pressed towards the rim of the assembly opening. The closed end can form a beading that locks with the rim of the assembly opening.<br>
While several fixing elements are usually required, one arresting element is sufficient for a windscreen wiper system. This can be located separate from the fixing elements. The arresting element is combined in an advantageous manner with a fixing element, in accordance with the invention, in that the arresting element bridges over the buffer space between a fastening block and the rim of the receiving port, when in the assembled condition, at that side of the fixing element that lies at the rear when seen in the second assembly direction. This cuts down on and/or simplifies components.<br><br>
The arresting element can, in principle, be a separate component that is essentially unyielding and is placed in the buffer space, whereby the elastic fastening block slackens. The arresting element is appropriately tied to the fastening block. In accordance with a design of the invention, it is proposed that the arresting element be shaped as a locking block that, in the first assembly direction, can be located offset, relative to the fastening block or can be shifted the moment the fastening block has reached its end position. The locking block can be connected to the fastening block by shear ribs that either yield elastically, tear off or break up when the locking block is pushed relative to the fastening block. In another design, the locking block is connected to the fastening block by means of a linear track, for example, a dovetail guide.<br>
During assembly, the locking block is located offset to the fastening block in the first assembly direction so that the block is inserted into the receiving port and can be moved in the second assembly direction. As soon as the final position has been reached, the locking block is pushed in the first assembly direction around the offset piece so that it henceforth fills up the buffer space in the receiving port. The locking block is appropriately arrested at the rim of the receiving port by locking elements so that it can not come loose from the receiving port.<br>
Another possibility is that the arresting element is a bolt that yields against the first assembly direction. During the first part of assembly, the bolt gives way opposite the first assembly direction and locks in place into the receiving port with a latching hook at the end of the second assembly movement of the fastening block. The bolt advantageously exhibits a stopper at its free end that lies adjacent to the rim of the receiving port when in the assembled state and borders the latching movement. When in the assembled state, the bolt runs approximately parallel to the receiving port. The bolt is thus essentially loaded in<br><br>
the longitudinal direction, whereby the bending moments and buckling forces are few.<br>

Description of the Exemplary Embodiments<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a windscreen wiper system 10 of a rear-window windscreen wiper of a motor vehicle.   The invention is naturally not<br><br>
restricted only to rear-window windscreen wipers but can be used without any trouble on the front-window windscreen wiper. The windscreen wiper system 10 comprises of an electro motor 12 and a gear 14 that together form a propulsion element 16. The propulsion element 16 has a casing 18 that is partially made of a cast material and has brackets 20. Fixing elements 22 are located at the ends of two brackets 20 while an arresting element 30 is provided at the end of another bracket 20.<br>
The fixing elements 22 essentially consist of a fastening block 76 (Fig. 8), 90 (Fig. 10), 96 (Fig. 14), that is affixed at the respective bracket 20 and is manufactured from vibration-muting, rubber-elastic material. Receiving ports 24 are provided at the car body 26 of the vehicle for the fastening elements 22. These are usually openings in the car body's sheet metal or in a holding device that is fixed firmly to the car body's sheet metal.<br>
The receiving ports 24 lie at a level that is diagonal to the first assembly direction 64. They can also be located distributed at several levels that run parallel to one another. The fastening blocks 76, 90, 96 are inserted in the receiving ports 24 in the first assembly direction 64 and subsequently moved at right angles to this in a second assembly direction 32, whereby a slot 78 sheaths the car body 26 at the rim of the assembly port 24. The first assembly direction 64 lies advantageously axially parallel to an output shaft 28 of the propulsion element 16. The second assembly direction 32 can then be a rotary motion around the output shaft 28, whereby the receiving ports 24 and the fastening blocks 76, 90, 96 with their slots 87, lie tangential to circles around the output shaft 28. In this kind of design, the arrangement and position of the output shaft 28 are essentially retained during assembly and the openings for the output shaft 28 in the car's body 26 can simply be sealed.<br><br>
After the fastening blocks 76, 90, 96 have reached their final position in the second assembly direction 32, this position is fixed by an arresting element 30, 52, 66, 92, 98. Only one arresting element 30, 52, 66, 92, 98 is required for a windscreen wiper system. Figure 1 displays arresting element 30 that is located independent of the fastening element 22 and an arresting element in the form of a locking block 92 that can be used in combination with the fastening element 22. All arresting elements 30, 52, 66, 92, 98 can be used individually or in combination.<br>
The arresting element 30 (Fig. 2) has a core 38 made of a firm material e.g. synthetic material. It has a longitudinal cross-section that is executed radial to the output shaft 28 in the design according to Figure 1. The arresting element 30 has a flange 40 with which it supports itself at the bracket 20 when in the assembled state. A stepped part, whose larger cross-section is inserted in an elongated hole 48 of the bracket 20 and whose end 50 with a smaller cross-section is inserted into an assembly port 34 of the car's body 26, connects at the flange 40 in the direction towards the car's body 26. The rims of the ports 34 of the car's body 26 are beaded over in the first assembly direction 64 to a flange 36. The core 38 of the arresting element 30 is provided with a vibration-muting layer 44 from the end 50 with the smaller cross-section up to flange 40 so that the bracket 20 is de-linked from the car's body 26 in accordance with vibration engineering. The layer 44 can be sprayed onto the firmer core 38 or can be made of a separate component that is pushed over the firmer core 38. Since the firmer core 38 exhibits a step 42 in the first assembly direction 64, the layer 44 too is correspondingly designed with a step so that the step lies at the rim of the assembly port 34 in the assembled state (Fig. 3) and ensures distance 46 between the bracket 20 and the car body 26.<br>
The arresting element 52 according to Figures 4 and 5 has a design that is similar to arresting element 30. The larger cross-section of the core 38, however,<br><br>
hereby lies directly without a vibration-muting layer, at the elongated hole 48, while the vibration-muting layer 54 extends only to the region of step 42. The end 50 with the reduced cross-section exhibits a thickening 60 in the region of the step 42 and a thickening 62 towards the outside. Thickenings 60, 62 cause the vibration-muting layer to form beadings 56, 58 in these regions. The distance between the beadings 56, 58 is measured in such a manner that the arresting element 52 is clipped into the assembly port 34 of the car's body 26 and ensures a sufficient distance 46 between the car's body 26 and the bracket 20. In addition, thickenings 60, 62 ensure a firm fit of the vibration-muting layer 54 even if the same is designed as a separate component.<br>
The arresting element 66 according to Figures 6 and 7 has a spring clamp 68 with a curved end 75. Angled handles 70 that are connected to the bracket 20, in a manner not illustrated here in detail, are attached to the free ends of the spring clamp 68. The spring clamp 68 has a vibration-muting layer 72 inside and vibration-muting layer 74 outside that surrounds the curved end 75. This is thickened opposite the assembly port 34 so that the arresting element 66 locks in place at the flange 36 of the assembly port 34. During assembly of the arresting element 66 in the first assembly direction 64, the handles 70 cross over in a stretched position, whereby they press the spring clamp 68 together and the inner vibration-muting layers 72 against one another.<br>
Arresting elements 80, 92, 98 are combined with fastening element 76, 90, 96 in designs according to Figures 8 to 16. In the design according to Figures 8 and 9, the arresting element, which is designed as a locking block 80, is connected to the fastening block 76 by shear ribs 82 and in fact displaced against the first assembly direction 64 to such a degree that the fastening block 76 that is affixed to the bracket 20 is first inserted into the assembly port 34 and can be pushed in the second assembly direction 32 so that slot 78 can grasp the car body 26 at the rim of the assembly port 24.   In this position, the locking block 80 in the first<br><br>
assembly direction 64 is pushed into the assembly port 24, whereby the shear ribs 82 tear off, break up or get so elastically deformed that the locking block 80 can fill up the buffer space between the fastening block 76 and a rim 88 of the receiving port 24 (Fig. 9). The arresting block is thereby held and secured at rim 88 by a stopper 86 and a latching hook 84.<br>
Figures 10 to 13 illustrate a similar design. A locking block 92 can, hereby, be guided into a fastening block 90 by being pushed over a linear track 94 in the first assembly direction 64. The fastening block 90 is affixed at the bracket 20 and has a slot 78. In a first assembly step (Fig. 11), the fastening block 90 is inserted into the assembly port 24 till the upper flange 104 of the slot 78 lies against that side that faces the car body 26. In another process step, the fastening block 90 with the locking block 92 is turned in the second assembly direction 32 till the end position (Fig. 12) is reached and the slot 78 grasps the car body 26 at the rim of the receiving port 24. In another assembly step, the locking block 92 is pushed in the linear track 94 in the first assembly direction 64 till the stopper 86 lies against the car body 26 and one of the latching hooks 84 secures the position from the opposite side of the car's body 26.<br>
In designs according to Figures 14 to 16, the arresting element serves as a bolt 98 that is located at that side of the fastening block 96 that faces away from the slot 78, yielding against the first assembly direction 64. The bolt 98 can, thereby, be firmly inserted in the fastening block 96 made of an elastic material and the resilience can be produced by the elasticity of the fastening block 96. Another possibility is for the bolt 98 itself to exhibit a satisfactory elasticity in the first assembly direction 64 or to be connected in an articulated manner to the fastening block 96. The fastening block 96 is inserted into the receiving port 24 of the car body 26 in the first assembly step in the first assembly direction till the upper flange 104 of the slot 78 lies against that side facing the car body 26. Bolt 98, which lies at the car body 26 with an angled latching hook 100, thereby yields<br><br>
against the first assembly direction 64. In another assembly step in the second assembly direction, the rim of the assembly port 24 is pushed into slot 78. When the fastening block reaches its end position in the second assembly direction 32 (Fig. 16), the bolt 98 snaps onto the receiving port 24 with a latching hook 100, whereby a stopper 102 at the free end of the bolt 98 comes into contact with the &gt; car body 26. In this position, the bolt 98 bridges the distance between the fastening block 96 and the rim 88 of the receiving port 24. It is, thus, convenient that the bolt 98 lie at a level that is as ctase to the receiving port 24 as possible so that the bolt 98 is not loaded in the longitudinal direction by any appreciable bending moments.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
