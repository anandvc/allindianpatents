				<td>This  invention relates to a  welding  torch. Sped-fically this invention relates to a semi  automatic, welding torch.<br>
The construction o-f known welding torches are known in the art, and not discussed herein -for the purposes o-f brevity. However several disavantage are associated with the known construction of the welding torch.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a welding torch which is compact.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a welding torch which does not require any power •for a feed.<br>
Still another object o-f this invention is to propose a welding torch and wherein the variations in the -ft?ed rate can be obtained by a change of wheels.<br>
Yet another object o-f this invention is to propose a welding torch and wherein the feed of the electrode depends exclusively an the travel o-f the torch.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a welding torch comprising a body intruding at the upper end to a handle provided to drag the torch, a pair<br><br>
of support rolls being disposed in the front, and back portion of said body such that to hold an electrode movably disposed in the said body, means being provided in the front, portion of said body such that to feed said electrode for welding upon dragging said torch on the workpiece to be welded, a metallic: tip being provided at. the front, end of said body such that to maintain the electric contact from the source to the electrode, an electric cable being provided in the upper portion of said body so as to connect said tip to the electric source.<br>
In accordance with this invention welding torch has a body provided at the upper- end of a handle. A pair of support rolls is provided at the front portion and in the rear portion of the body for supporting an electrode disposed in the said body for welding purposes. Means comprising driver roll and driven roll are provided in the front portion of the body such that to feed said electrode for welding purposes upon dragging the torch with a help of a handle on the surface to the welder. The metallic, tip is disposed in the front end of the body such. that to maintain the electric contacts between the electric source and the electrode directly after the flux is melted during the welding.<br><br>
The  welding torch according to  a preferred ecnfoodi merit  is herein described and illustrated  in  the accompanying drawings whereins-Fig.l      shows the semi automatic welding torch.<br>
Referring to the drawing Fig.i the torch i o-f the present invention comprises, a body 2 intruding at the upper end to a handle 3. Body 2. may be way of example be made of metal or hard fiber which is highly heat resistant. Handle 3 allows torch .1. to be dragged conveniently. The upper end of body 2 has a housing 4 for a current input connector 5 so as to connect current cable 6 to be connected to a. power source for providing power to a tungsten tip 9 at the working end of electrode 8. Tungsten tip 9 aids in maintaining the electric contact from the source to the electrode directly after the flux is melted during welding. This tip is positioned in such a manner that it doesn't touch the base metal. Body 2 has support rolls 7 in contact with an electrode 8. Electrode; 8 further has a driven roll 10 and a removably held feed roll 11. A driver roll 12 is contact with a workplace 14, and iss a metallic: roller with teeth along the circumference such that no slip occurs between base metal and this. This is held by a bearing in body 2. Feed roll 11 is a<br><br>
compound roller with same module as the drive roll on one wheel and the other channeled roughly (ie, lined with rubber) to feed the electrode. Electrode 6 has a •feed adjustment, slot 15 to provide support for feed roll 11. Feed roll 11 is held by a bracket, through a lock nut. 17. Such a mechanism aids in accommodating the adjustment wheels. This feed adjustment, can be done- by opening the hard glass door 16 provided for changing the wheels. Support rolls 7 are disposed in an overhanging portion o-f the electrode 8,<br>
When torch i is dragged along the weld gap, the drive wheel's 12 motion is transferred to the -feed roll 11 and ultimately to the electrode. In order to atart. the work, the tungsten tip 9 is contacted to the base metal and then distanced. The -feed rate can be adjusted by the suitable change wheel assembly. On complete1 consumption of one electrode, the next one ia inserted, the required electric contact is maintained by the tungsten tip.<br><br><br>
Claims<br>

driver  roll  is a metallic, roller having  teeth?:,  along<br>
circumference so as to avoid slippage on the work piece-,<br>
5.	A welding torch as claimed in claim i wherein said<br>
tip is made of preferably tungsten,<br>
6.	A welding torch  as claimed in claim 1 wherein  a<br>
glass  door being provided in the front portion of  said<br>
body for adjusting the moment o-f said feed roll by means<br>
of adjustirig means.<br>
