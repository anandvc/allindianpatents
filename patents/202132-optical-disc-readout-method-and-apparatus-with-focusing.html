BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a multibeam type optical disc read apparatus, and more particularly to a multibeam type optical disc read apparatus in which different light beams are applied at the same time to a plurality of adjacent tracks of an optical disc, such CD-ROM, CD-WO, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, MO, and tD and data recorded on the tracks applied with the light beams are read with a record data read system in accordance with a detected output of each reflected light beam.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
A multibeam method is one of the methods of reading record data from a CD-ROM at high speed. With this method, different light beams are applied at the same time to a plurality of adjacent tracks of an optical disc formed with a spiral track, data recorded on the tracks applied with the light beams are read with a record data read system for each track in accordance<br><br>
with a detected output of each reflected light beam, and the read data is sequentially output in the record order by preventing the read data from being duplicated or omitted.<br>
Each of a plurality of light beams of such a multibeam optical disc read apparatus is required to be correctly focussed onto an optical disc signal plane. If not, record data cannot be read with a light beam in an out of focus state.  If a focussing optical system is provided for each of a plurality of light beams, it is possible to focus all the light beams onto the optical disc signal plane by independently controlling these focussing optical systems.   However, provision of a plurality of focussing optical systems is not practical from both the technical and economical viewpoints. From this reason, a single focussing optical system is generally used.  An optical system is associated with aberration. Even if the center of an optical axis is in an in-focus state, a point spaced apart from the center of the optical axis is in an out of focus state.  In order to solve this problem, a plurality of light sources for generating a plurality of light beams are disposed in line and adjusted so as to make a light source spaced apart from the optical axis be shifted toward the optical axis.<br>
However, such adjustment is not easy and it is not preferable to use a plurality of light sources (laser<br><br>
diodes) In order to realize a cost effective system. As a plurality of light beams are focussed on a signal plane of an optical disc, the focus states of the light beams are different. Therefore, in order to compensate for the high frequency compoaent attenuation to be caused by the spatial frequency characteristics (MTF) of a detection output of each light beam, a waveshape equalizer circuit is used for raising a gain of the high frequency components of the detection output and suppressing inter-code interference. It is not economical that a plurality of different waveshape equalizer circuits are used for a plurality of light beams.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a multibeam optical disc read apparatus of this invention, an optical system including an objective lens applies n light beams at the same time to respective n tracks on a signal plane of an optical disc in an in-focus state near at the signal plane,  and signal processing means generates an RF signal for each light beam from a detection output of the light beam reflected from the signal plane, and reads data recorded on the tracks to which the light beams were applied, basing upon the detection output of the light beam, wherein the optical system is set so that the signal plane of the optical disc is positioned at the middle of respective<br><br>
in-focus points of the n light beams as viewed along an optical axis direction of the objective lens.<br>
It is therefore possible to avoid a poor in-focus state of each of the n light beams relative to the signal plane and to reliably read record data from an optical disc.<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention, grading means diffracts a light beam generated from a single laser diode light source and generates 0 order, +/- first order,,.,, +/- m-th order diffraction light beams. The i-th order diffraction light beams are symmetrical relative to the 0 order diffraction light beam. Therefore, the focus states of the i.-th order diffraction light beams are identical and the spatial frequency characteristics are also identical, so that the waveshape equalizer circuits of the same characteristics can be used.<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention, first and second focus control operations are executed by first determining a control amount necessary for focussing the 0 order diffraction light beam onto the signal plane of an optical disc, and then modifying the control amount so that the signal plane of the optical disc is positioned at the middle of the in-focus points of the 0 order, +/- first order,—, +/- m-th order diffraction light beams.<br><br>

DETRlIiED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Next, an embodiment of a multibeam type CD-ROM read apparatus will be described with reference to Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 represents a CD-ROM formed with a spiral track recorded with data (the outer and inner circumference sides of CD-ROM are indicated by arrows in Fig. 1) .  CD-ROM 1 is rotated at a constant linear velocity with an unrepresented spindle motor. Reference numeral 2 represents an optical pickup of a multibeam type capable of radiating five light beams. The optical pickup 2 moves from an inner circumference to an outer circumference as record data read advances, while CO-ROM 1 rotates.  The optical pickup 2 applies different light beaias 31 to Sg at the same time to n = 5 adj acent tracks of CD-ROM 1, and each reflected light beam is detected (received) with photodetectors PD1 to PDj which output photocurrents as detection signals.<br>
In the optical pickup 2,  reference numeral 4 represents a laser diode for radiating a laser beam 3.<br><br>
Reference numeral 5 represents a grating (diffraction grating) disposed perpendicular to the optical axis of the laser diode 4 for diffracting the laser beam to form a -2 order diffraction light beam 31, a -1 order diffraction light beam 31, a 0 order diffraction light beam 33, a +1 order diffraction light beam 31, and a +2 order diffraction light beam 31. Reference numeral 6 represents a beam splitter made of two rectangular prisms glued together. Reference numeral 7 represents a collimator lens for converting each diffused light beam into a collimated light beam. Reference numeral 8 represents an objective lens for focussing the light beams 31 to 85 passed through the beam splitter 6 and collimator lens 7 onto a signal plane 1 of CD-ROM 1. The optical axis of the objective lens 8 intersects at a right angle with the signal plane 1.<br>
Reference numeral 9 represents a focus actuator for moving the objective lens 8 along a direction perpendicular to the signal plane 1 of CD-ROM 1 to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, in order to maintain an in-focus state of each light beam 31 to 31 relative to the signal plane 1 irrespective of surface vibrations of CD-ROM 1. Reference numeral 10 represents a tracking actuator for moving the objective lens 8 along a radial direction of the signal plane 1 of CD-ROM 1 to follow a center deviation of CD-ROM 1, in order to make each light beam 3,1 to 31 correctly trace a<br><br>
corresponding track. The focus actuator 9 and tracking actuator 10 are Independently driven by a servo circuit to be described later.<br>
The photodetectors PD1 to PD5 are provided In correspondence with the light beams 3, to 31, and each outputs a photocurrent proportional to a received light amount. The light beams 31, 31, 31, and Sj reflected from the signal plane 1 of CD-ROM 1 pass through the objective lens 8 and collimator lens 7 and are reflected by the beam splitter 6. Thereafter, they pass through an optical system (not shown) including a cylindrical lens, a detector lens and the like and become incident upon the corresponding photodetectors PD1 to PD5.<br>
The optical axis of the optical system constituted of a cylindrical lens, a detector lens and the like is made coincident with the optical axis of the light beam 83 of the 0 order diffraction light, and the light beam is made vertically incident upon the signal plane 1 of CD-ROM 1.<br>
The light beams 3, and 31 (3s and 3i&gt; are the +1 order diffraction Light and -1 order diffraction light (+2 order diffraction light and -2 order diffraction light) of the laser beam 3 made vertically incident upon the grating 5, are formed in perfect line symmetry with the light beam 3 of the 0 order diffraction light, and applied to the signal plane 1 in perfect symmetry with the light beam 31 vertically incident upon the signal<br><br>
plane 1 of CD-ROM 1. Therefore, In-focus points P1 and P; (P5 and PJ of a pair of light beams 31 and 31 (S1 and 3j) aire at the same position as viewed along the optical axis Of the objective lens 8, and in-focus points of the light beams 31 to 31 are generally on an arc line. Therefore, even if the light beam 33 is in a perfect in-focus state relative to the signal plane 1, the other light beams are not in the perfect in-focus state although they are focussed near the signal plane 1.<br>
The photodetectors PD1, PD;, PD1, and PD1 output photocurrents 11, I1, I1, and I5 proportional to received light amoiuits. The photodetector PD3 is a four-division photodiode similar to that used for an optical pickup of the ordinary one beam type, and outputs photocurrents I3-A, Ij-B, I3-C, and I3-D proportional to received light cunounts of respective division diodes.<br>
Reference numeral 11 represents a sled motor for moving the optical pickup 2 in the radial direction of CD-ROM 1 during a read or search operation. The sled motor is driven with the servo circuit and moves the optical pickup 2 to a desired position along a forward or reverse direction during the search operation, or gradually moves the optical pickup 2 along the forward direction during the read operation as the read operation of CD-ROM 1 advances.<br>
Reference numeral 20 represents a record data read system which reads at the same time the record data<br><br>
recorded on the tracks applied with the light beams 3j to 35, basing upon the light reception outputs of the photodetectors PDj to PD5 of the optical pickup 2, and serially outputs the read record data in the record order of CD-ROM 1 by preventing the read record data from being duplicated or omitted. A focus bias adjustment at the start of the data read operation is performed once before and after an unreadable system judgement. In the record data read system 20, current/voltage converters (l/V) 21;1, 21 j, 211, and 211 convert the photocurrents l1, l1, 11, and I5 output from the photodetectors PD1, PDj, PD1, and PD5 into RF voltage signals RF1, RF1, RF1, and RF5 corresponding to the light beams 31, 31, 31, and 31 and output them. Current/voltage converters (I/V) 21j-A, 2I3-B, 2I3-C, and 2I3-D convert the photocurrents I3-A, I3-B, I3-C, and I3-D output from the photodetector PD3 into voltage values V1, V1, V,,, and Vj, and output them.<br>
Reference numeral 22 represents a computation section which performs an arithmetic operation of (V1 + Vg + V(, + Vj,) to output an RF signal BF3 corresponding to the light beam 33, an arithmetic operation of (V1 + V1,) -(Vg + Vp) to output a focus error signal, and an aritlmetic operation of (V1 + V1) - (V1. + V1) to output a tracking error signal. A specific structure of the computation section 22 is shown in Fig. 2. In the computation section, an adder 221 performs an arithmetic<br><br>
operation of (V1+ V1+ V1+ VJ to output the RF signal RF3 corresponding to the light beam 33. An adder/subtractor 221perfoirms the arithmetic operation of (1A + Vp) - {Vg + Vjj) to output the focus error signal, and an adder/subtractor 223 performs the arithmetic operation of (v1+ Vg) - (V1+ v1) to output the tracking error signal.<br>
Reference numeral 23 represents the servo circuit for performing a focus servo control, a tracking servo control, and a sled servo control. In accordance with the focus error sigpnal FE input from the computation section 22, the focus actuator 9 is driven so as to make FE zero and focus the light beams 31to 31upon the signal plane 1, and in accordance with the tracking error signal TE input from the computation section 22, the tracking actuator 10 is driven to make TE zero and make (on-track) the light beams 31to 31trace the corresponding tracks.<br>
Because of variation of optical characteristics of the optical pickup 2 and variation of electrical characteristics of the current/voltage converters 213-a to 21j-D and the adder/subtractor 22 , the focus error signal output from the adder/subtractor 221does not become zero but has an offset value specific to the apparatus, even if the light beam 33 is in a perfect in-focus state relative to the signal plane 1 of CD-ROM 1. The focus servo system controls to make zero the focus<br><br>
error signal FE input from the servo circuit 23. Therefore, if the focus error signal output from the adder/subtractor 221 is supplied directly to the servo circuit 23, the light beam Sj does not enter the in-focus state relative to the signal plane 1 because of the offset value, an error rate of data read from CD-ROM 1 may become too large and data read becomes impossible in some cases.<br>
To  solve  this  problem,  an  offset  adjustment function has been supplied to the focus servo system. Specifically, the computation section 22 is provided with a focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 for generating a variable focus bias voltage V1 under the control of a system controller to be described later, and an adder 221 for adding the focus bias voltage Vf to the focus error signal output from the adder/subtractor 22; to form the focus error signal FE. By supplying the focus bias voltage V1 suitable for each apparatus to the focus bias system, offset errors of the optical system and electrical system are cancelled out to make the light beam 33 be focussed on the signal plane 1.<br>
Reverting to Fig. 1, reference numerals 241 to 245 represent waveshape equalizers for increasing the high frequency components of the RF signals RF1 to RF5 to thereby compensate for high frequency attenuation to be caused by the spatial transmission frequency (MTF) characteristics of the light beams 31 to 31 and suppress<br><br>
the generation of inter-code interference. The RF signal RF3 input to the waveshape equalizer 243 or the RF signal RF3 output from the waveshape equalizer 243 is input to the servo circuit 23. The servo circuit 23 activates the focus servo control upon judgement of a timing when the value of the focus error signal FE enters a negative feedback region of the focus servo control during a focus search operation. The servo circuit 23 activates the tracking servo control upon judgement of a timing, by using the RF signal RF3, when the light beam 83 enters the negative region of the tracking servo control.<br>
Reference numerals 261 to 261 represent first signal processing circuits for performing binarization, clock recovery using PLL circuits, bit demodulation, frame sync  detection,  EFM  demodulation,  and  sub-code demodulation, by using the RF signals RF1 to RF5, and outputting data DflTA1 to DftTAg  (inclusive of P,  Q parities) after the EFM demodulation on the basis of one block unit (unit of 98 frames completing one sub-code frame), together with corresponding ft-time {fibsolute-time) data ftT1 to ATg of the sub-code Q channel.  The first signal processing circuits 261 to 265 serially output the demodulated data DATA1 to DATAg one symbol (8 bits) after another. The A-time data AT3 output from the first signal processing circuit 263 is input to a system controller to be described later.  The first signal<br><br>
processing circuit 263 for the RF signal RF3 has a built-in CLV control circuit (not shown) for making frame sync signals be detected at a constant time interval, fl CLV control is performed for an unrepresented spindle motor to thereby rotate CD-ROM 1 at a constant linear velocity.<br>
Upon detection of the frame sync, the first signal processing circuits  261  to  265  output  frame  sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 of H level to the system controller.   For example, these frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 are used for judging whether a track jump is completed or not.  The first signal processing circuit 263 has a built-in jitter amount measuring circuit (not shown) for measuring a jitter amount of the binarized RF signal, and has a function of outputting the measured jitter amount data JD3 to the system controller.  The jitter amount data JD3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 is used for focus bias adjustment.<br>
Reference numeral 30 represents a parallel-to-serial converter (P/S) for receiving in parallel data of one block unit output from the first signal processing circuits 28i to 285 and serially outputting them in the record order by preventing the data from being duplicated or omitted. The specific structure of the P/S converter 30 is shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, reference numerals 32i to 325 represent memories each<br><br>
having two storage areas, a first area and a second area, and provided in correspondence with a corresponding one of the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265. The data DATa1 to DATA5 output from the first signal processing circuits 26i to 265 are stored in ones of the first and second areas. Each of the first and second areas has a capacity allowing the data DATA1 to DATA1 of a sufficient number of block units to be stored therein. Reference numerals 33i to 385 represent memories each having two storage areas, a first area and a second area, and provided In correspondence with a corresponding one of the first signal processing circuits 261 to 261. The A-tlme data ATi to AT5 output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 261 are stored in ones of the first and second areas, together with start addresses A11 to Agg (or a11 to ag,) and end addresses Ri1 *° 15* 1°1 1le *o 1se1 indicating the location of the corresponding data DATAj to DATA5 in the memories 321 to 325. Each of the first and second areas has a capacity allowing the A-time data ATj to AT5 of a sufficient number of data sets to be stored therein.<br>
Reference niimerals Sl1 to 311 represent write controllers provided in correspondence with the first signal processing circuits 261 to 261. The write controllers Slj to 3I5 control to write the data DATA1 to DATAg output from the first signal processing circuits<br><br>
26i to 265 in the first or second areas of the memories 321 to 321, and to write the a-time data RT1 to RT5 in the first or second areas of the memories 321 to 321, together with the start addresses a1s to R1s (or a11 to a1J and end addresses a11 to H11 (or a11 to a1J indicating the location of the corresponding data DaTA1 to DATRj in the memories 321 to 325.<br>
The contents of memories 321 and 331 (where f = 1 to 5) are shown in Fig. 4.   in this example, a write controller 311 controls to write 15 blocks of each set of data DaTAf (1) to DaTAf (15) in the first area, and to write 15 blocks of each set of data DRTRj. (16) to DRTR1 (30) in the second area.   In the first area of the memory 331, the a-time data for each block of the data oaTa1 (1) to DRTa1 (IS) are written as, for example, frames of 23:40:60 to 23:40:74, together with a start address Afg (1) and an end address a11 (1) to a start address a1g (15) and an end address a11 (15) indicating the location of the corresponding data DaTa1 (1) to DaTa1 (15) in the first area of the memory 32(.  In the second area of the memory 33(, the a-time data for each block of the data DRTRf (16) to DRTRf (30) are written as, for example, frames of 23:41:48 to 23:41:62, together with a start address a1g (1) and an end address a11 (1) to a start  address  a,s(16)  and  an  end  address  a,, (15) indicating the location of  the corresponding data DaTA,(16) to DaTa,(30) in the second area of the memory<br><br>
32f.<br>
Reference numeral 34 represents a read controller. With reference to the ft-time data and the start addresses Ajs to h11 (or a11 to a11) and end addresses Aj11 to 651 (or a1, to a11) stored in the memories 33i to 331, the read controller 34 reads the data DATA, to DATA5 stored in the memories 33i to BSg by preventing the data from being duplicated or omitted, and serially outputs the data one symbol after another in the record order (A-time order) of CD-ROM 1. Specific operations of the write controllers 311 to 311 and read controller 34 will be later described.<br>
Returning back to Fig.  1, reference numeral 40 represents a second signal processing circuit.   The second signal processing circuit 40 receives the data serially output from the P/S converter 30, descrambles the data in the unit of one block, and thereafter demodulates Lch and Rch data in conformity with the CD-DA specification through error detection/correction based on CIRC codes (error detection/correction with p parities, deinterleaveing, error detection/correction with Q parities).  The second signal processing circuit 40 then demodulates the CD-ROM data from the Lch and Rch data by performing sync detection, descrambling, header detection, and error detection/correction with EDO and ECC codes in accordance with the CD-ROM specification, and thereafter outputs the CD-ROM data to an external<br><br>
host computer.<br>
Reference numeral 50 represents a system controller made of a microcomputer.  For the search operation, the system controller 50 operates to supply a search command to the servo circuit 23, and to drive the sled motor 11 for the search operation to thereby move the optical pickup 2 along the forward or reverse direction of CD-ROM 1 to a desired position.  For the read operation, the system controller 50 operates to supply various servo-on commands to the servo circuit 23, and to focus the light beams 31 to 85 upon the signal plane 1 of CD-ROM 1 to thereby trace adjacent five tracks.  Each time record data is read from each track during a proper number of rotations of one or two or more, the system controller 50 supplies the servo circuit 23 with a track jump  command  of  jumping  the optical  pickup  by a predetermined number of tracks in the forward direction, at the start of a read operation,  the system controller 50 monitors the jitter amount data JD3 Input from the first signal processing circuit 263 to control the focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 and change the focus bias voltage V1 and fix the V1 value when the jitter auaount data becomes minimum, or monitors the frame sync detection signals FSj to FS1 input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265, during one rotation of CD-ROM 1, to check whether or not any system of the light beams 31 to 31 cannot read record data<br><br>
because of a track pitch variation, center deviation and the like of CD-ROM 1. If all the frame sync detection signals FSi to FS1 are H and there is no system unable to read record data, the system controller supplies a general read/write command to the P/S converter 30 to thereby read/write data output from the first signal processing circuit 261 to 261 to and from the memories 3211 to 325.<br>
If the frame sync detection signal for one or a plurality of light beams is L for a predetermined time (e.g., 1/75 sec or longer) and data cannot be read, light beams 31, 3j, 31,... to be used for the data read are selected from the light beams 3i to 31, and a specific read/write command including read system information "i, j, k,..." indicating the light beam systems to be used for the data read is supplied to the P/S converter 30 to thereby read/write data DATAj, DATflj, DATAi1, . . . output from the first signal processing circuit 261, 26j, 26),, ... among the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265 to and from the memories 32j1 to 325.<br>
The general read/write command or specific read/write coinifland output from the system controller 50 is input to the read controller 34 of the P/S converter 30 and transferred from the read converter 34 to the write controllers Slj to 3I5. Upon reception of the general read/write command at the start of the data read, the write controllers 311 to 3I5 control to write<br><br>
the data DRTfl1 to DATa1 output from all the first signal processing circuits 261 to 261 first in the first areas of the memories 321 to 325. Upon reception of an intercept command from the read controller 34, the read operation is intercepted until a resume command is received, and then the data is written in the second areas, Similarly, when the intercept command is received thereafter, the read operation is intercepted, and when the resume command is received, data is written in the areas not used at the preceding time.<br>
If the write controllers Sl11 to 311 receive the specific read/write command at the start of the data read,  only the write controllers 311,  31j,  3111,... indicated by the read system information "i, j, k,..." operate to write the data DRTA1, DflTAj, DATA,,,... output from the first signal processing circuits 26j1, 26j, 26(j, . .. first in the first areas of the memories 321, 32j, 321,....  Upon reception of the intercept command from the  read  controller  34,  the  read  operation  is Intercepted until the resume command is received, and then  the  data  is  written  in  the  second  areas. Similarly,  when the intercept command is received thereafter, the read operation is intercepted, and when the resume command is received, data is written in the areas not used at the preceding read cycle.<br>
After receiving the general read/write command (specific read/write command) from the system controller<br><br>
50, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311 to Slg (311, 31., 311,...) and a jump command to the system controller 50, when all A-time data become continuous without omission in the areas among the memories 331 to 335 {331, 331, 33)1, .. .) where data were written by the write controllers 31i to 3I5 (31j, 31j, 31,,,...) at the present read cycle. With reference to the A-tirae data and the start and end addresses stored in the areas among the memories 331 to 335 (331, 331, 3311,...) where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read and output record data in the order of A-tirae starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the areas among the memories 331 to 331 (331, 33j, 331, - - - ) where data were written at the present read cycle.<br>
Thereafter, upon reception of a jump completion notice from the system controller 50, the read controller 34 supplies the resume command to the write controllers 311 to 3I5 (31i, 311, 311,...)- Thereafter, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers Sl1 to 311 (31t, 31j, 311,...) and the jump command to the system controller 50, when all R-time data become continuous without omission in the areas among the memories 331 to 331 (331, 331, 33,1,...) not used at the preceding read cycle. With reference to the A-tlme data and the start and end addresses stored<br><br>
in the areas among the memories 331 to 331 (331, 331, 33i,, . . .) not used at the preceding read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read and output record data in the order of fl-time starting from the A-time next to the A-time corresponding to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the areas among the memories 321 to 321 (321, 32j, 32i1, . . .) not used at the preceding read cycle. Similar operations are repeated thereafter.<br>
The operation of the embodiment will be described. Fig. 5 is a flow chart illustrating the overall process to be executed by the system controller 50 at the start of data read. Fig. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a first focus bias adjustment process to the executed by the system controller 50,  Figs.  7(1)  to 7(3)  are diagrams illustrating a focus bias adjustment operation. Figs. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 21 are diagrams illustrating motion positions of the optical pickup 2 relative to CD-ROM 1, and Figs. 10, 12, 15, and 20 are diagrams showing the data contents in. the memories 331 to 331.<br>
It is herein assumed that CD-ROM 1 rotates at a constant linear velocity under CLV control and the focus servo is turned on, and that different five light beams 3i to 35 are applied at the same time to respective n = 5 adjacent tracks of CD-ROM 1.<br><br>
(1)  First Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
When an unrepresented host computer designates a read start point of CD-ROM 1 as a frame having A-time, for  example,  23:41:0,  the  system  controller  50 determines the position of the track containing the read start A-time frame of CD-ROM 1, the read start point being represented by x (refer to Figs. 8, 9, 11, 13-15, 17-19, and 21). The system controller 50 first supplies the search command to the servo circuit 23 to move the optical pickup 2 so that the light beam 31 reaches the position of the track (x-B) (Step S30 shown in Fig, 5&gt;. Thereafter, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to initialize V1 as V1 = 0 V (Step S31). Thereafter, the system controller 50 supplies a tracking servo-on command and a sled servo-on conmiand to the servo circuit 23 to activate the tracking servo and sled servo (Step S32).  Therefore, the light beams 31 to 31 radiated from the optical pickup 2 are focussed on the tracks (x-8) to (x-4) in an track-on state (refer to I in Figs. 8, 9, 11, 13-15, 17-19, and 21).   In this state, all the light beams 31 to 31  are not in an optimum in-focus state because the focus bias adjustment Is not stilL performed.<br>
The light beams 3 1 to 31 reflected by the signal plane 1 are received by the photodetectors PD1 to PD1 which output photocurrents i1 to I5. Of these photocurrents, the photocurrents 11, l1, l1,  and I5 output<br><br>
from the photodetector s PD1, PD1, pD1, and PD1 are converted into RF signals RF1, RF1, RF1, and RF1 by the current-to-volt age converters 211, 21j, 211, and 211 which are waveshape equalized by the waveshape equalizers 241, 24;, 24,, and 241 and input to the first signal processing circuits 26i, 262, 261, and 265. Photocurrents l1-R to I3-D from the photodetector PD3 are converted into voltage values V1 to Vp by the current-to-voltage converters 21j-A to 2I3-D and added together by the adder 221 of the computation section 22 to generate an RF signal RF3. The RF signal RF, is waveshape equalized by the waveshape equalizer 24, and input to the first signal processing circuit 263.<br>
The optical axis of the optical system constituted of the beam splitter 6, collimator lens 7,    objective lens 8, cylindrical lens, a detector lens and the like is made coincident with the optical axis of the light beam 31 of the 0 order diffraction light, and the light beam is made vertically incident upon the signal plane 1 of CD-ROM 1.  When the light beam 31  is in the perfect in-focus state relative to the signal plane 1, the in-focus points of the other light beams 3i, 31, 34, and 31 are not in the perfect in-focus state although they are near the signal plane 1.<br>
The light beams 3, and 31 (31 and Sj) are the +1 order diffraction light and -1 order diffraction light {+2 order diffraction light and -2 order diffraction<br><br>
light) of the laser beam 3 made vertically incident upon the grating 5, are formed in perfect line syinmetry with the light beam 31 of the 0 order diffraction light, and applied to the signal plane 1 in perfect symmetry with the light beam 31 vertically incident upon the signal plane 1 of CD-ROM 1. Therefore, a pair of light beams 31 and 31 (35 and 31) has the same cross sectional area on the signal plane and the same spatial transmission frequency characteristics.<br>
The waveshape equalizers 241 to 241 increase the high frequency components of the RF signals RF1 to RF5 to thereby compensate for high frequency attenuation to be caused by the spatial  transmission frequency  (MTF) characteristics of the light beams 31 to 31 and suppress the generation of inter-code interference. As described above, since the light beams 31 and 31 have the same spatial transtaission frequency characteristics (MTF), the waveshape equalizers 241 and 241 are made to have the same waveshape equalizing characteristics.  Similarly, since the light beams 32 and 31 have the same spatial transmission  frequency  characteristics  (MTF),  the waveshape equalizers 243 and 24, are made to have the same waveshape equalizing characteristics.  Therefore, three types of waveshape equalizing characteristics are designed for the five waveshape equalizer circuits 241 to 245.<br>
The first signal processing circuits 26i to 265 make<br><br>
the input RF signals RFj to RF1 be subjected to binarlzation, clock recovery using PLL circuits, bit demodulation, frame sync detection, EFM demodulation, and sub-code demodulation, and output data DATA1 to DATAg (inclusive of P, Q parities) after the EFM demodulation on the basis of one block unit, together with corresponding A-time data AT1 to RT5 of the sub-code Q channel. The first signal processing circuits 261 to 261 serially output the demodulated data DATA1 to DATAg one symbol (8 bits) after another. The A-time data AT3 is input to the system controller 50. Upon detection of the frame sync signals, the first signal processing circuits 261 to 261 output the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS1 of H level to the system controller 50. The first signal processing circuit 263 measures a j itter amount of the binarized RF signal and supplies the jitter amount data JDj to the system controller.<br>
In this state, the system controller 50 executes a first focus bias adjustment process during approximately one rotation of CD-ROM 1 (Step S33) in accordance with the sequence shown, in the flow chart of Fig, 6. At Vj = 0 V, the system controller 50 reads the jitter amount data JD3 measured by the first signal processing circuit 2G3 and stores it in its memory (not shown) as J d (0) (Step SIC). Next, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to Increase V1 by AV (positive value) from 0 V and the jitter amount data JD, is read<br><br>
and stored in the memory as jd{+l). The voltage V1 is decreased by AV (negative value) from 0 V and the jitter amount data JD3 is read and stored in the memory as jd(-1) (Step Sll).<br>
The values jd(+l), Jd(0), and jd(-l) are compared and if jd(+l) &gt; jd(0) <jd at step s12 the j itter amount is minimum vj="D" v and it can be considered that focus offset was initially approximately therefore bias voltage generator circuit controlled to set v1 s13></jd>
If jd(+l)  jd(+l) <jd at step s17 the jitter amount is minimum v1="(+1)" av and it can be considered that focus offset output of adder was initially approximately therefore bias voltage generator circuit controlled to set s18></jd>
If not jd(+2) &gt; jd(+l) <jd at step s17 the value k is incremented to s19 and flow returns s16 repeat above operations. if jd> jd{+(k-l)i <jd at step sl7 the jitter amount is minimum v and it can be considered that focus offset was initially></jd><br>
and approximately {+(k-l)) • (-AV). Therefore, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to set Vf to {+(k-l)&gt; • AV (Step Sl8).<br>
If not jd(-i-l)  jd(-l) 
If not jd(-2) &gt; jd(-l) -ijdCO) (NO at Step S22), the value k is incremented to 3 (Step S24) to repeat the above operations. If jd(-k) &gt; jd{-(k-l)) <jd at step s22 the jitter amount is minimum v1="{-(k-1)}" and it can be considered that focus offset output of adder was initially approximately therefore bias voltage generator circuit controlled to set s23 .></jd>
In this focus bias adjustment set state, only the light beam 33 is in the perfect in-focus state relative to the signal plane 1 (in Fig. 7(1), the in-focus point P3 of the light beam 31 is coincident with the signal plane 1), and the other light beams Sj, 31, 31, and 21  are<br><br>
not in the perfect in-focus state and the in-focus points Pj and P1 at the outermost circumference are greatly spaced from the signal plane.<br>
According to the invention, after Step S13, Sl8 or S23, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 224 is controlled to change the value V1 by a predetermined amount W1 to move the objective lens 8 by IAJI remotely from the signal plane, where L1 is a distance (refer to Fig. 7(1)) between the in-focus point P3 of the light beam Sj and the in-focus point P1 (P5) of the light beam 31 (85) along an optical axis direction of the objective lens 8. Namely, at Step S25 or S26, V1 is set to V1 + W1. The signal plane 1 of CD-ROM is therefore positioned at the middle of the in-focus point Pj of the light beam 31 and the in-focus point p1 (p1) of the light beam 3i (31) (refer to Fig. 7(2)), and all the in-focus points Pj to P5 are near at the signal plane 1 and are not greatly spaced from the signal plane 1.<br>
After Step E13, SlB or S23, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 may be controlled to change the value V( by a predetermined amount W1 to move the objective lens 8 by L;/2 remotely from the signal plane, where L1 is a distance (refer to Fig. 7(1)) between the in-focus point P3 of the light beam Sj and the in-focus point P; (P1) of the light beam 31 (31) along an optical axis direction of the objective lens 8. The signal plane 1 of CD-ROM is therefore positioned at the middle<br><br>
of the in-focus point P1 of the light beam 3, and the in-focus point P; (PJ of the light beam 31 (31) (refer to Fig. 7(3)). As will be later described, this operation is performed (Steps S38 and S39) during a second focus bias adjustment if the light beam systems 31 and 31 are unreadable.<br>
(2)  Judgement of System Unable to Read<br>
After the system controller 50 performs the first focus adjustment at Step S32 shown in Fig. 5 to set the positional relation of the in-focus points P1 to Pg of the light beams 31 to 31 as shown in Fig. 7(2), the system controller 50 monitors the frame sync detection signals FSi to FS5 input from the first signal processing circuits 2611 to 265, during further one rotation of CD-ROM 1, to check whether or not any system of the light beams 31 to 31 continues to take L level for a predetermined time or longer (e.g., one block = 1/75 second or longer) and cannot read record data (Steps S34 to S36).<br>
(3) General Read/write Operation (refer to Fig- 8, all systems of the light beams 31 to 31 can read record data)-<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there is no record data  unreadable  system,  the  system  controller  50<br><br>
allocates all the five light beams 31 to 31 as the read systems of h light beams. A continuous read rotation number i is set as 1=1, and a read track jump number J is set as J = (n-2) = 3 (Step S35). The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or 31 is included in the h = 5 read light beams 31 to 85 (Step S36). In this example, since the light beams 31 and 31 are included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from V1 + W1.<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest F3 and the nearest P1 (P1) along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points P1 to P5 of the five read light beams 31 to 35, so that P1 and P1 are very near to the signal plane 1.  Since the in- focus points P1 to P5 are originally disposed regularly on generally on an arc line and the position distribution of the in-focus points P1 to P5 along the optical axis direction of the objective lens is limited in a narrou area, P1, P3, and P5 are also very near to the signal plane 1 as shown in Fig. 7(2). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, any of the in-focus points Pj to P5 of the light beams 31 to 31 does not move greatly spaced from the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 31 to 31 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1.<br><br>
(3-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the a-time data representative of the latest R-time data fiT1 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A.-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 5 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the ft-time.<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 8 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 85 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) to (x+3) (refer to III In Fig. 8).  Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) to (x+3) at the same time starts, by using five systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 26;, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263, photodetector PD4 to first signal processing circuit 2641, and photodetector PD5 to first signal processing circuit 261.  When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS5 of H level are input from<br><br>
the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265, the general read/write command is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Upon reception of the general read/write command, the P/S converter 30 writes the data DaTAj to DATA5 output from the first signal processing circuits 26i to 265, into the memories 32i1 to 325. After CD-ROM 1 rotates by generally one rotation {in actual, slightly longer than one rotation) and it is confirmed that there Is no omission of record data read with the light beam 31 to 31 systems (refer to IV in Fig. 8), record data write into the memories 321 to 321 is intercepted, and the record data is serially read from the memories 321 to 321 in the fi-tlme order by preventing the record data from being duplicated or omitted, to supply the read record data to the second signal processing circuit 40 and supply a track jump command to the system controller 50.  The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls the servo circuit 23 to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 by the track jump number J = 3 in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to Sg are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+3&gt; to (x+7) (refer to V in Fig. 8).<br>
When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS1 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 265, a track jump completion notice is supplied to the P/S converter 30.  The P/S converter 30<br><br>
received the track jump completion notice writes the data  DATAi  to  DATfl1  output  from  the  first  signal processing circuits 26i to 265, again into the memories 32i to 325.  After CD-ROM 1 rotates by generally one rotation (in actual, slightly longer than one rotation) and it is confirmed that there is no omission of record data read with the light beam 31 to 31  systems (refer to VI in Fig. 8), record data write into the memories 321 to 325 is intercepted, and the record data is serially read from the memories 3211 to 321 in the A-time order, starting from the data corresponding to the A-time next to the A-time corresponding to the data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, by preventing the record data from being duplicated or omitted, to supply the read record data to the second signal processing circuit 40 and supply a track jump command to the system controller 50.<br>
The system controller 50 received the track jximp command controls the servo circuit 23 to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 by the track jump number J = 3 in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 35 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+7) to (x+11) (refer to Vll in Fig. 8).<br>
The second signal processing circuit 40 receives the data serially output from the P/S converter 30, descrambles the data in the unit of one block, and thereafter demodulates Lch and Rch data in conformity<br><br>
with the CD-DA specification through error detection/correction based on CIRC codes (error detection/correction with P parities, deinterleaveing, error detection/correction with Q parities). The second signal processing circuit 40 then demodulates the CD-ROM data from the Lch and Rch data by performing sync detection, descrambling, header detection, and error detection/correction with EDC and ECC codes in accordance with the CD-ROM specification, and thereafter outputs the CD-ROM data to an external host computer.<br>
(4) First Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam system 31, refer to Figs. 9 and 10) (4-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment Process<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record<br>
data unreadable system shows that there is one record<br>
data unreadable system of the light beam 31   at the<br>
outermost  circumference,  the  system  controller  50<br>
allocates M light beams 31 to 31 as the read systems of<br>
h light beams.  M is the maximum number of adjacent<br>
light beam systems usable, which is "4" or a combination<br>
of light beams 31 to 31 and M a 3.  The continuous read<br>
rotation number I Is set as X = 1, and the read track<br>
jump number J is set as J = (M-2) = 2 (Step S34).  The<br>
second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed<br>
to check whether the light beam 31 or 31  is included in<br>
the h = 4 read light beams 31 to 31 (Step S36).  in this<br><br>
example, since the light beam 31 is included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing Vj from Vf + W1.<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest Pj and the nearest P,1 along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points Pj to P1 of the four read light beams 31 to 31, so that P; and P1 are very near to the signal plane 1.  P1, and P3 are also very near to the signal plane 1 as shown in Fig. 7(2).  Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, any of the in-focus points Pi to P4 of the light beams Sj to 31 does not move greatly spaced from the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 31 to 3, systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (4-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-tlme data AT, input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 311 at the innermost circumference among the h = 4 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-l) one track inner than the track jc containing the read start point of the A-tlme (Step<br>
S35 <br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 9 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 3, are focused in the track-on state on the tracks (x-l) to {x4-2). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) to (x+ 2) at the same time starts, by using four systems including the photodetector PDj to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PDj to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PDj to first signal processing circuit 263, and photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261. When all the frame sync detection signals FSj to FS1 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 261, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3, 4" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controllers 31i to 311 indicated by the read system information "1, 2, 3, 4" write one block after another the data Dotted to DATAj output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 261, into the first areas of the memories 321 to 321, and writes the A-tirae data AT1 to AT1 corresponding to the data DATA1 to DATA1 and the pairs of start addresses A11 to A11 and end addresses A11 to A11 in the<br><br>
memories 32i to 321, into the first areas of the memories 33i1 to 331. In the example shown in Fig. 9, in the first areas of the memories 331 to 331, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:40:60, 23:41:00, 23:41:15, and 23:41:30 (refer to Fig. 10).<br>
The read controller 34  received the  specific read/write command checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the first areas of the memories 331 to 331 indicated by the read system information "1, 2, 3, 4" and used at the present read cycle to confirm that the fi-time one frame before the start R-time data in the first area of the memory 331 is contained in the first area of the memory 333, that the   one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory 331, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 332 11 contained in the first area of the memory 331.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = one rotation (in actual, slightly more than one rotation) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig. 9, the contents of the first areas of the memories 331 to 334 become as shown in Fig. 10 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the<br><br>
write controllers 311 to 31, to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. with reference to the a-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the first areas among the memories 3311 to 33, where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 32j to 32, where data DATA1 to DATA, were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:41:44 is output.<br>
The write controllers 31i to 31, received the intercept command intercepts the read operation of the memories 321 to 321 and 33i to 33,. The system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a track jump by J = 2 tracks in the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 9.  After the light beams 3i to 3, axe focused in the track-on state on the tracks (x+2) to (x+5), reading record data resumes.  When all the frame sync detection signals FiS to FS, of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 26,, the track jump completion notice is read and<br><br>
supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The  controller  34  received  the  track  jump<br>
completion notice supplies the resume command to the<br>
write controllers 311 to 311, and the write controllers<br>
311 to 3I4 received the resume command write the data<br>
DATAi to DATA1 output from the first signal processing<br>
circuits 261 to 261 after the track jump, this time into<br>
the second areas of the memories 321 to 321, and writes<br>
the A-time data ATj to AT, corresponding to the data DATA1<br>
to DATA1 and the pairs of start addresses a1g to a,g and<br>
end addresses Sj1 to a,1 in the memories 321 to 321, into<br>
the second areas of the memories 331 to 331.   In the<br>
example shown in Fig. 9, in the second areas of the<br>
memories 33,1 to 331, the A-time data is written from the<br>
frames of 23:41:33, 23:41:48, 23:41:63, and 23:42:03<br>
(refer to Fig. 10).<br>
After the read controller 34 supplies the resume command, the read controller 34 checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the second areas of the memories 331 to 33, used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-tlme one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 331 is contained In the second area of the memory 333, that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 331 is contained in the second area of the memory 331, and that the R-time one frame before the start R-ttme<br><br>
data in the second area of the memory 331 is contained in the second area of the memory 331.      After the read operation  by  the  optical  pickup  2  is  performed approximately I = one rotation (in actual, slightly more than one rotation) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 9, the contents of the second areas of the memories 331 to 33, become as shown in Fig. 9 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems "1,  2,  3,  4".   Therefore,  the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 31,1 to 311 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 331 to 384 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the A-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the second areas among the memories 32i to 324 where data DATA1 to DATA4 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40.  In this example, the data from the frame 23:41:45 to the frame 23:42:17 is output.<br>
The write controllers Slj to 31, received the intercept command intercepts the read operation.  The<br><br>
system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 9. After the light beams 31 to 34 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+5) to (x+8), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FSj to FS4 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 26,, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the four beams 31 to 34 and by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(5) Second Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam system 31, refer to Figs. 11 and 12) (5-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record<br>
data unreadable system shows that there is one record<br>
data unreadable system of the light beam 31, the system<br>
controller 50 allocates M = 3 light beams 3i to 31  as the<br>
read systems of h light beams, where M is the laaxirauia<br>
number of adjacent light beam systems usable, which is<br>
"3" or a combination of light beams 311 to 31  and M a 3.<br>
The continuous read rotation number l is set as X = 1,<br>
and the read track jump number J is set to J = {M-2) =<br>
1 (Step S35). The second focus bias adjustment shown in<br><br>
Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 311 or 35 is included in the h = 3 read light beams 31 to 31 {Step S36). In this example, since the light beam 31 is included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from V1 + W1.<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest P3 and the nearest P1 along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points Pi to P3 of the three read light beams 31 to 31, so that P2 is very near to the signal plane 1. P1 and P3 are also very near to the signal plane 1 as shovm in Fig. 7(2). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, any of the in-focus points P1 to P3 of the light beams 31 to 31 does not move greatly spaced from the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 31 to 31 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (5-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data ATj input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the Innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focussed in the track-on<br><br>
state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the R-time (Step S35).<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position ir shovm. in Fig.  11 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 3j are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1) (refer to III in Fig. 11). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD; to first signal processing circuit 261, and photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS3 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263, the specific read/write command including the read system infonnation "1, 2, 3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controllers 31i to 3I3 indicated by the read system information "1, 2, 3" write one block after another the data DRTRi to DATA3 output from the first signal processing circuits 26i to 263, into the first areas of the memories 32i1 to 324, and writes the R-time data AT1 to AT3 corresponding<br><br>
to the data DflTAj to DaTflj and the pairs of start addresses A11 to R11 and end addresses A,, to H11 in the memories 32j to 323, into the first areas of the memories 331 to 333. In the example shown in Fig. 11, in the first areas of the memories 33i to 331, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:40:60, 23:41:00, and 23:41:15 (refer to Fig. 12).<br>
The read controller 34 received the specific read/write command checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the first areas of the memories 33j to 331 indicated by the read system information "1, 2, 3" and used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory 33;, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 33; is contained in the first area of the memory 331.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = one rotation (in actual, slightly more than one rotation) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig. 11, the contents of the first areas of the memories 3311 to 334 become as shown in Fig, 12 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 31i to 311    to intercept the write<br><br>
operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the fl-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the first areas among the memories 33j to 331 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 321 to 323 where data DATAi to DATA3 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:41:29 is output.<br>
The write controllers 311 to 3I3 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation.  The system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a track jump by J = 1 track in the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 11. After the light beams 3; to 31  are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+1) to (x+3), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FSi to FS3 of B level are output from the first signal processing circuits 26,1 to 261, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The  controller  34  received  the  track  jump<br><br>
completion notice supplies the resume command to the write controllers 31j to 313, and the write controllers 31i to 3I3 received the resume command write the data DATRi to DRTAj output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263 after the track jump, this time into the second areas of the memories 32i to SZj, and writes the A-time data AT1 to RT3 corresponding to the data DRTRi to DftTfij and the pairs of start addresses a1g to 833 and end addresses a11 to a11 in the memories 32j to 323, into the second areas of the memories 331 to 33,. In the example shown in Fig. 11, in the second areas of the memories 331 to 331, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:41:18, 23:41:33, and 23:41:48 (refer to Fig. 12).<br>
After the read controller 34 supplies the resume command, the read controller 34 checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the second areas of the memories 331 to 333 used at the present read cycle to confirm that the R-time one frame before the start a-t±me data in the second area of the memory 333 is contained in the second area of the memory 331, and that the a-time one frame before the start R-time data in the second area of the memory 331 is contained in the second area of the memory 33i.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately 1 = one rotation (in actual,<br><br>
slightly more than one rotation) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 11, the contents of the second areas of the memories 331 to 333 become as shown in Fig. 12 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems "1, 2, 3".  Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311 to 311 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the R-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 331 to 333 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of R-time starting from the fi-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the second areas among the memories 321 to 321 where data DATA1 to DATAj were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40.  In this example, the data from the frame 23:41:30 to the frame 23:41:62 is output.<br>
The write controllers Slj to 3I3 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation. The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 by the jump track number J = 1 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 11.  After the light beams 31 to Sj are<br><br>
focussed in the track-on state on. the tracks (K+3) to (x+5), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FSj to FS3 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 26i1 to 263, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the three beams 31 to 3, and by preventing the record data froia being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(6) Third Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by<br>
the light beam systems 34 and 31, refer to Figs. 13 and<br>
12)<br>
(6-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are two record data unreadable systems of the light beams 3, and 31, the system controller 50 allocates M = 3 light beams 31 to 3, as the read systems of h light beams, where M is the maximum number of adjacent light beam systems usable, which is "3" or a combination of light beams 31 to 33 and Mas.  The continuous read rotation number I is set as 1 = 1, and the read track jump number J is set to J *= (M-2) = 1 (Step S35&gt;.  The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or 31 is included in the h = 3 read light beams<br><br>
3i "to 33 (Step S36). In this example, since the light beam 3j1 is included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from V1 + W1.<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest P3 and the nearest Pi along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points Pj to P1 of the three read light beams 31 to 33, so that P2 is very near to the signal plane 1. Pi and P3 are also very near to the signal plane 1 as shown in Fig. 7(2). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follou a surface vibration of CD-HOM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, any of the in-focus points Pi to P3 of the light beams 3i to 33 does not move greatly spaced from the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 3i to S1 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (6-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is<br>
completed,  in  accordance  with  the  A-time  data<br>
representative of the latest A-time data RTj input from<br>
the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read<br>
start point A-time designated by the host computer, the<br>
track Jump direction and number are determined so that<br>
the light beam 3i at the innermost circimference among<br>
the h = 3 read light beams is focussed In the track-on<br>
state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track<br>
X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step<br><br>
S35) .<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 13 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 3; to S1 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1) (refer to III in Fig. 13). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit ZG1, photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit ZB1, and photodetector PDj to first signal processing circuit 263. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS, of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 26i to 263, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, quite similar to the case shown in Fig. 11, an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately one rotation, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number a = 1, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately one rotation, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 1 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 13) to read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and<br><br>
omitted,<br>
(7) Fourth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam systems 31 and 35, refer to Fig. 14) (7-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment Process<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are two record data unreadahle systems of the light beams 31 and 31, the system controller 50 allocates M = 3 light beams 31 to 84 as the read systems of h light beams, where M is the maximum number of adjacent light beam systems unable, which is "3" or a combination of light beams 3; to 84 and M £ 3.  The continuous read rotation number I is set as 1=1, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (M-2) = 1 (Step S35).  The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or Sg is included in the h = 3 read light beams 3; to 3, (Step S36) .  In this example, since the light beam 31 or 85 is not included, the second focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to change V1 frcMB the value of Vj = V, + W1 to the value of Vf = Vf + Wj (Wj 
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest P3 and the nearest Pj along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points P2 to P1 of the three read light beams 81 to<br><br>
31, so that all the in-focus points P1 to P1 are very near to the signal plane 1 (refer to Fig. 7(3)), Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, all the in-focus points P1 to P, are maintained very near to the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 3; to 3, systems can more reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1 than, the case of Fig. 7(2). (7-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest R-time data RTj input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step S35) .<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 14 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jijmped from the position II by three tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 31 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1) . Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) to<br><br>
(x+1) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 26;, photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 263 and photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 26,. When all the frame sync detection signals FS; to FS, of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 26; to 261, the specific read/write command including the read system information "2, 3, 4" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, nearly similar to the case shown in Fig. 11 (in the case of Fig, 14, the write controllers 31; and 3I4 control to write the data DftTA1 and DATR1 and A-time data AT1 and AT, output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 26,, into the memories 321 and 32, and 33; to 331, and with reference to the the A-time data and start and end addresses stored in the memories 332 111   314, the read controller 34 controls to read record data stored in the memories 331 and 331 in the order of At-time by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted), an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately one rotation, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J ■= 1,  again  reading  record  data  from  CD-ROM  1  by approximately one rotation, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number 3 = 1 Is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 14) to sequentially read record<br><br>
data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(8) Fifth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beams 31 and 31,   refer to Figs. 15 and 16) (8-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If a judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are two record data unreadable systems of the light beams 3; and 35, then only two light beams 33 and 31 are adjacent each other among the remaining three light beams 31, 33, and 31. In reading at high speed record data of CD-ROM 1 by repetitively performing continuous record data read by approximately two rotations and track jump, it is necessary to read record data only with adjacent light beams. High speed read is possible even for a combination of read light beams not completely adjacent each other, if continuous record data read of CD-ROM 1 during a plurality of rotations and track jump by predetermined tracks are repeated.<br>
Specifically, continuously reading record data with data readable light beams during approximately (R+1) rotations and track jump by (Q-1) tracks in the forward direction can be repeated if Q is 2 or larger and R is 0 or larger, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the record data readable<br><br>
light beam systems, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams.<br>
In the example shown in Figs. 15 and 16, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 31 and the outermost light beam is the light beam 3, so that Q = 3.  In the adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the light beams 311 and Sj, the ma.ximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is "1" because there is only the light beam 31. As the h read light beam systems, all the three record data readable light beam systems 31, Sj, and 31 are allocated.   The continuous read rotation number I is set as I = (R + 1) =2, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (Q - 1) = 2 (Step S35).  The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or 35 is included in the h = 3 read light beams 31, 83, and 31 (Step S36).  In this example, since the light beam 31 is Included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from V1 + W1.<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest P3 and the nearest P1 along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points Pj, P3, and P1 of the three read light beams 3i, 83, and 31, so that the in-focus point P, is very near<br><br>
to the signal plane and also the in-focus points Pj and Pj are also near the signal plane 1 (refer to Fig. 7(2)). Thereafter, the obj ective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, all the in-focus points P1, P3, and P, are maintained very near to the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 31, 3-1, and 31 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (8-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step S35).<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 15 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31, 33, and 31 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), and (x+2).  Then, reading the record data on the<br><br>
1<br>
tracks (x-1) to (x+2) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD11 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263 and photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 264. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1, FS3, and FS4 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 26i, 263, and 261, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 3, 4" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
V3pon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controllers 31i, 3I3, and 311 indicated by the read system information "1, 3, 4" write one block after another the data DATA1, DATA3, and DATA1 output from the first signal processing circuits 261, 263, and 261, into the first areas of the memories 321, 323, and 32,, and writes the A-time data flTi, AT3, and AT, corresponding to the data DATAj, DATA3, and DATA4 and the pairs of start addresses B1s, A33, and Aj3 and end addresses Aj11, R11,  and A1, in the memories 32i1, 323, and 32,, into the first areas of the memories SS1, 333, and 33,.  In the example shown in Fig. 15, in the first areas of the memories 331, 383, and 33,, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:40:60, 23:41:15, and 23:41:30 (refer to Fig. 16).<br>
The read controller 34 received the  specific read/write command checks whether there is no omission<br><br>
of record data read with each read system, by referring ■to the first areas of the memories 331, 333, and 331 indicated by the read system information "1, 3, 4" and used at the present read cycle to confirm that the fl-time one frame before the start fl-time data in the first area of the memory 331 is contained in the first area of the memory 333, and that the fi-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory 33i1.<br>
after the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig. 15, the contents of the first areas of the memories 33j1, 333, and 331 become as shown in Fig. 16 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems.  Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311, Slj, and to 3I4 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50.  With reference to the A-tirae data and the start and end addresses stored in the first areas among the memories 331, SSg, and 331 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of fi-time starting from the oldest fi-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 321, 323, and 321 where data DfiTAj, DATAj, and DATA1 were written at<br><br>
the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:41:59 is output.<br>
The write controllers 311, 3I3, and 311 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation.  The system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a track jump by J = 2 tracks in the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 15. After the light beams 31.   31.   and 31 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+3), (x+5), and (ic+6) , reading record data resumes.  When all the frame sync detection signals TS1,   FS3, and FS1 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261, 263, and 261,     the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The controller 34 received the track jump completion notice supplies the resume command to the write controllers Sl1, 3I3, and 311, and the write controllers 31i, 3I3, and 311 received the resume command write the data DATAj, DATfl3, and DATA1 output from the first signal processing circuits 261, 263, and 261 after the track jump, this time into the second areas of the memories 32i, 323, and ZZj, and writes the A-time data ATi, AT3, and BT1 corresponding to the data DRTA1, DRTA3,<br><br>
and DATA3 and the pairs of st1rt addresses a1g, 331, and a1s and end addresses a11, 331, and a11 in the memories 3211 to 323, into the second areas of the memories 331, 331, and 334. In the example shown in Fig. 15, in the second areas of the memories 331, 331, and 33,, the fi-time data is written from the frames of 23:41:48, 23:42:03, and 23:42:18 (refer to Fig. 16).<br>
after the read controller 34 supplies the resume command, the read controller 34 checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the second areas of the memories 331, 333, and 33, used at the present read cycle to confirm that the fl-time one frame before the start R-time data in the second area of the memory 33, is contained in the second area of the memory 333, and that the a-time one frame before the start a-time data in the second area of the memory 333 is contained in the second area of the memory 331.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately 1 ■= two rotations (In actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 15, the contents of the second areas of the memories 33i, 33,, and 33, become as shown in Fig. 16 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems "1, 3, 4". Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311, 3I3, and 311 to<br><br>
intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the fl-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 33j, 333, and 33, where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of fl-time starting from the fl-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the second areas among the memories 321, 321, and 321 where data DATfl1, DflTflj, and DATfl1 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:41:60 to the frame 23:42:47 is output.<br>
The write controllers Sl1, 3I3, and 311 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation.  The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 by the jump track number j = 2 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 15.  After the light beams 31, Sj, and 3« are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+7), (x+9),  and  (x+10),  reading  record  data  resumes. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the three beams 3j, Sj, and 31   and by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br><br>
For example, in order to read the record data from the 9 tracks from the track (x-1) to the track (x+7) shown in Fig. 15, only reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during four rotations and one track jump are required. Therefore, the record data can be read more rapidly than data is read with one light beam from CD-ROM 1 during 9 rotations.<br>
(9) Sixth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beams 31, 31, and 3,, refer to Fig, 17) (9-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment Process<br>
If a judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are three record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31, 31 and 34, it is impossible to read record data with three adjacent light beam systems.  However, similar to the case shown in Fig. 15, continuously reading record data with data readable  light  beams  during  approximately  (R+1) rotations and track jiamp by (Q-1) tracks in the forward direction can be repeated if Q is 2 or larger and R is 0  or  larger,  where  Q  is  the  number  of  tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the record data readable light beam systems, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams.<br><br>
In the example shown in Fig. 17, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 31   and the outermost light beam is the light beam 31  so that Q = 2. In the adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the light beams 31  and 3s, the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is "1" because there is only the light beam 31. as the h read light beam systems, all the two record data readable light beam systems 31  and 31  are allocated. The continuous read rotation number 1 is set as I = (R + 1) = 2, and the read track j ump number J is set to J =  (Q - 1)  =1 (Step S35) .   The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or 85 is included in the h = 2 read light beams 33 and 35 (Step S36).  In this example, since the light beam 35 is included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the two in-focus points P3 and the nearest P5 of the two read light beams 83 and 85 along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, so that the in-focus points P3 and P5 are very near to the signal plane (refer to Fig. 7(2)). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, all the in-focus points P3 and P5 are maintained very near to the signal<br><br>
plane 1, and all the light beam 31 and 31   systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (9-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the fl-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 26j and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 2 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step S35) .<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig.  17 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by two tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31  and 31  are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) and (x+1) , Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) and (X4-2) at the same time starts, by using two systems including  the  photodetector  PD3  to  first  signal processing circuit 261 and photodetector PD5 to first signal processing circuit 265,  When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 and FS1 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 and 261, the<br><br>
specific read/write command Including the read system information "3, 5" is supplied to the P/S converter 30. Thereafter, nearly similar to the case shown in Fig. 15 (in the case of Fig. 17, the write controllers 3I3 and 3I5 control to write the data DfiTfij and DBTftj and A-time data AT3 and AT5 output from the first signal processing circuits 263 and 265, into the memories 823 and 325 and 333 to 385, and with reference to the the A-time data and start and end addresses stored in the memories 333 and 335, the read controller 34 controls to read record data stored in the memories 383 and 885 in the order of At-time by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted), an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately 1  =  2 rotations, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 1, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately I = two rotations, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 1 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 17) to sequentially read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
For example, in order to read the record data from the 7 tracks from the track (x-1) to the track (x+5) shown in Fig. 17, only reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during four rotations and one track jump are required and the record data can be read more quickly than record data is read with one light beam during 7 rotations of<br><br>
CD-ROM 1.<br>
(10) Seventh Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam 31, refer to Fig, 18) (10-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment Process<br>
If a judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there is one record data unreadable systems of the light beam 31, it is possible to read the record data with the three light beam systems 3i to 31 as described with the case (5) above (refer to Fig. 11). However, if the case shown in Fig. 15 is incorporated, the record data can be read at higher speed.<br>
In the example shown in Fig, 18, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 31 and the outermost light beam is the light beam 85 so that Q = 4. In the adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the light beams 31 and 31, the maximum number R of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is "1". As the ij read light beam systems, all the four record data readable light beam systems 31 to 33, and 3g are allocated. The continuous read rotation number I is set as I = (R + 1) = 2, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (Q - 1) = 3 (Step S35). The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 Is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or 31 is included in the h = 4 read light beams 3j to 3,, and Sg<br><br>
(Step S36). In this example, since the light beams 31 and 31 are included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from V1 + W1.<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest P3 and the nearest P1 (P5) along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points P1 to P3, and p1 of the four read light beams 31 to 33, and 35, so that the in-focus points are very near to the signal plane (refer to Fig. 7(2)). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, all the in-focus points P1 to P1, and P1 are maintained very near to the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 3i1 to 33, and 31 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (10-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
fifter the second focus bias adjustment process is completed,  in  accordance  with  the  fl-time  data representative of the latest A-time data aT3 Input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 4 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track jc containing the read start point of the A-time (Step S35) .<br><br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in. Fig. 18 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 31, and 31 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) to (x+l) , and {x+3) (refer to HI in Fig. 18) . Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) to (x+l) and (x+3) at the same time starts, by using four systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 262, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263, and photodetector PD5 to first signal processing circuit 261. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS3, and FS5 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 26,1 to 263, and 265, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3, 5" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, nearly similar to the case shown in Fig. 15 (in the case of Fig. 18, the write controllers 3I1 to 3I3 and 31s control to write the data DATRi to DATAj and DATA5 and A-time data AT1 to ATj and AT5 output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263 and 265, into the memories 321 to 323 and 325 and 33i to SSj and 33s, and with reference to the the A-tlme data and start and end addresses stored in the memories 331 to 333<br><br>
and 335, the read controller 34 controls to read record data stored in the memories 331 to SSj and 335 in the order of At-time by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted), an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately 1 = 2 rotations, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approKimately I = two rotations, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. IB) to sequentially read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
For example, in order to read the record data from the 11 tracks from the track x to the track (x+10) shown in Fig. 18, only reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during four rotations and one track jump are required. In contrast, the case shown in Fig. 11 requires reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during four rotations and three track jumps.<br>
(11) Eighth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable<br>
by the light beams S1, 31, and Sg, refer to Pigs. 19 and<br>
20)<br>
(11-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are three record data unreadable systems of the light beams 3,1, 31, and 31,<br><br>
record data is omitted if It is read with the remaining two adjacent light beam 31 and 31 by repetitively performing data read of CD-ROM 1 during one rotation or more and track jump in the forward direction. In this case, record data is continuously read from CD-ROM 1 by using the record data readable one light beam system.<br>
Specifically, as the h read light beam system, the record data readable light beam 31 near at the center is allocated among the record data readable light beams 31 and 33. The continuous read rotation number I is set infinite, and the read track jump number J is set to J = 0.<br>
The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or 31 is included in the h = 1 read light beam 3-1 (Step S36). In this example, since the light beams 31 and 85 are not included, then it is checked whether the light beam 31 or Sj is included (Step S38). In. this example, since the light beam is included, the focus vias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to change the value V, from the value of V, + W1 to the value of V1 + W1 (W1 
The signal plane 1 becomes therefore coincident with the in-focus points Pj and P3 of the read light beams 31 and 33 (refer to Fig. 7(3)).  Thereafter, the<br><br>
objective lens B moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, the record data of CD-ROM 1 can be reliably read with the light beam 3j system. (11-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the a-time data representative of the latest a-time data RT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point a-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 1 read light beam is focussed in the track-on state on the track x   (Step S35).<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig.  19 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by two tracks in the forward direction so that the light beam Sj is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) (refer to III in Fig. 19).  Then, reading the record data on the track x, by using one system including the photodetector PDj to first signal processing circuit 263.   When the frame sync detection signal FS3 of H level is input from the first signal processing circuit 263, the specific read/write coramand including the read system information "3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br><br>
Upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controller 3I3 indicated by the read system information "3" writes one block after another the data DATA3 output from the first signal processing circuits 26j, into the first areas of the memories 323, and writes the A-time data RT3 corresponding to the data DATA, and the pairs of start addresses R.-11 and end addresses R11 in the memory 323, into the first areas of the memory 333. In the example shown in Fig. 19, in the first areas of the memory 331, the A-time data is written from the frame of 23:40:60 (refer to Fig. 20).<br>
Since only one record data read light beam is used as indicated by the read system information "3", the read controller 34 received the specific read/write command refers to the first areas of the memory SSj indicated by the read system information "3" and used at the present read cycle to read the data in the A-time order starting from the oldest A-tlme from the first area of the memory 323 and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40, without outputting the  intercept  command  and  track  jump  command. Therefore, the optical pickup 2 will not be jumped, and as CD-ROM rotates, the record data from the track (x-1) is sequentially read with the optical beam 31  and output to  the  second  signal  processing  circuit  40,  by preventing the record data from being omitted.<br><br>
(12) Ninth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beams 31, 31, 3,, and 31, refer to Fig. 21) (11-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system at Step S33 shown in Fig. 5 shows that there are four record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31, 31, 3,, and 85, record data is omitted if it is read with only one remaining light beam Sj by repetitively performing data read of CD-ROM 1 during one rotation or more and track jump in the forward direction. Also in this case, record data Is continuously read from CD-ROM 1.<br>
Specifically, as the h read light beam system, the record data readable light beam 31 is allocated among the h record data readable light beam. The continuous read rotation number I is set infinite, and the read track jump number J is set to J = 0 (Step S35).<br>
Thereafter, quite similar to the case shown in Fig. 19, the second focus bias adjustment process is performed to change the value V, by - W1 (Step S40), and the optical pickup is jumped in the forward direction to make the light beam 31 in the track-on state on the track (x-l) to read record data from the track (x-1) with the light beam 83. In this case, V1 = (Vf+W1) - W1 = V,, and the light beam 3, is in the perfect in-focus state as shown in Fig. 7(1).<br>
In the above embodiments, if all the five light<br><br>
beam systems 31 to 31   can read the record data, the signal plane of CD-ROM 1 is set at just the middle of the remotest in-focus point and nearest in-focus point and at the center of the five in-focus points P1 to P1 of the light beams 31 to 31  along the optical axis direction of the objective lens 8,  If some of the five light beam systems 31 to 31  cannot read the record data, the signal plane of CD-ROM 1 is set at just the middle of the remotest in-focus point and nearest in-focus point and at the center of the h read light beams along the optical  axis  direction  of  the  objective  lens  8. Therefore, if all the five light beam systems 3j to 31 can read the record data, it is possible to avoid a poor in-focus state on the signal plane of the five light beams 31  to 31 and reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1.  Similarly, even if some of the five light beam systems 3i to 31 cannot read the record data, it is possible to avoid a poor in-focus state on the signal plane 1 of the h read light beams and reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1.<br>
If all the five light beam systems 3j to 31, can read the record data, the system controller 50 performs the focus bias adjustment so that the signal plane of CD-ROM 1 is positioned at the center of the in-focus points P1 to P5 of the five light beams 31 to 31 along the optical axis direction of the objective lens 8. If some of the five light beam systems 31 to 31  cannot read the record<br><br>
V<br>
data, the signal plane of CD-ROM 1 is set at the middle of the in-focus points of the allocated h light beams. Therefore, if all the five light beam systems 3;1 to 31 can read the record data, it is possible to avoid a poor in-focus state on the signal plane of the five light beams 31 to 31 and reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1, regardless of the surface vibration of CD-ROM 1. Similarly, even if some of the five light beani systems 3i to 31 cannot read the record data, it is possible to avoid a poor in-focus state on the signal plane 1 of the h read light beams and reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1, regardless of the surface vibration of CD-ROM 1.<br>
In the above embodiments, the number of light beams is set as n = 5.  The number of light beams may be set to other values such as 7 and 9.  For example, as shown in Fig. 22, if nine light beams 3j to 39 are used (focus error signal and tracking error signal are generated by using the light beam 31  reflected from the signal plane of CD-ROM), the first focus bias adjustment process makes the signal plane 1 be positioned Just at the midst of the remotest in-focus point P1 and nearest in-focus point P1 (Pg) along the optical axis direction of the objective  lens  8  (refer  to Fig.  22(1)) .    If  the Judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there is no record data unreadable system, the light beams 31 to 31 are allocated<br><br>
as the h read light beams, and it is set that 1=1 and J = 7. The second focus bias adjustment process does not change the value V1 and retains the state of Fig. 22(1).<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are two record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31 and 31, the light beams 31 to 3g are allocated as the h read light beams, and it is set that 1=1 and J = 5. The second focus bias adjustment process changes the value Vj so that the signal plane is positioned at the middle of the remotest in-focus point p1 and nearest in-focus point Pj (Pg) along the optical direction of the objective lens 8 among the in-focus points of the seven read light beams (refer to Fig. 22(2)).<br>
Different from the above, if the light beam systems 3, and Sg cannot read record data, then Q = 8 and R = 2. Seven light beam systems 31 to 31 and 3, are allocated as the h read light beams. The continuous read rotation number I is set as 1 = (R+1) =3 and the track jump number J is set as J = (Q-1) = 7. The second focus bias adjustment process does not change the value V1 and retains the state of Fig. 22(1).<br>
The first signal processing circuits 26i, 261, 261, and 265 may be added with measuring circuits for measuring jitter amounts of the binarlzed RF signals and outputting jitter amount data JD1, JD1, JV1,   and JD5, and<br><br>
the second focus bias adjustment process shown in Fig. 5 may be changed as illustrated in Fig. 23.<br>
Referring to Fig, 23, first the system controller 50 stores the value V1 set at the first focus bias adjustment process at Step S3 of Fig. 5 in its memory (not shown) as E (Step S109), Of the jitter amount data JD1 to JD5 measured by the first signal processing circuits 26,1 to 261, jitter amount data JDj1, JD,1, , . . of the h read light beam systems are read and its average jd(0)" is stored in the memory (Step SllO).<br>
Next, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to increase V1 by AV (positive value) from E (V) and the jitter amount data JD1, JD,,, . . . of the h read light beams systems are read and an average value thereof is stored stored in the memory as jd(+l)".  The voltage Vj is decreased by AV (negative value) from E (V) and the jitter amount data JD1, JD1, . . . of the Ij read light beams systems are read and an average value thereof is stored stored in the memory as jd(-l)" (Step Sill).<br>
The values jd(+l)", jd(0)", and jd(-l)" are compared and if jd(+l)" &gt; jd(0)"<jd at step s112 the average jitter amount is minimum vj="E" and it can be considered that signal plane of cd-rom positioned middle ln- points pj1 pj p1 .. . h read light beams along optical axis objective lens all></jd><br>
the h read light beams are in an optimum state of perfect in-focus, and that there is no light beam in a state far from the perfect in-focus state. Therefore, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to set V1 to E (V) (Step S113).<br>

the in-focus points p1, p.,   P1, . . . of the h read light beams 31, 31, 31,, . . . are in an optimum state of perfect in-focus.  Therefore, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 224 is controlled to set Vf to to E + {+(k-l)) ■ (AV) (Step S118).<br>

 <br>
AV (Step S123).<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment is completed in the above manner, all the h read light beams 311, 3,, Sj,, .. . can enter the perfect in-focus state relative to the signal plane 1, and the in-focus state of the h read light beams relative to the signal plane can be optimized with ease. Thereafter, since the objective lens 8 moves to follow the surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, any of the h read light beams will not become far from the perfect in-focus relative to the signal plane 1, and any of the h read light beam systems can reliably read record data from CD-ROM 1.<br>
In the second focus bias adjustment processes illustrated in Fig. 6 (Fig. 23), the bias voltage value Vj is determined so that the jitter amount data JDj (average jitter amount data JD1, JD1, JD;1, . . ,) measured by the first signal processing circuit 263 (circuits 261, 26j, 261,...) becomes minimum to thereby make the light beam 33 temporarily enter the in-focus state.  Instead, the first signal processing circuit 263 (circuits 261 to 265) may be provided with error detection/correction circuits which descramble the EFM demodulated data in the   unit   of   one   block,    perform   error detection/correction  based  on  CIRC  codes  (error detection/correction with P parities, delnterleaveing, error detection/correction with Q parities), measure error rates detected through error detection with P<br><br>
parities, and output error rate data ED3 (EF1 to ED5) . JD3 (JDi1, JDj, JDj,,...) in Fig, 6 {Fig. 23) are replaced by ED3 (EDj1, EDj, ED1,...), and the bias voltage value Vj is set so that the value ED1 (ED11, ED1, ED,,,...) becomes minimum and the light beam 31 is focussed onto the signal plane 1. In this manner, the second focus bias adjustment may be performed.<br>
Measuring the error rate for each light beam system may be performed by the second signal processing circuit.   Specifically, the second signal processing circuit    40    is    provided    with    an    error detection/correction circuit which measures an error rate detected through error detection with P parities when perform error detection/correction based on CIRC codes  (error  detection/correction with  P  parities, deinterleaveing,  error  detection/correction  with  Q parities) is performed, and outputs the measured error rate.  For the focus bias adjustment, the data DATA3 (data DftTAi to DATA5)  output from the first signal processing circuit 263 (261 to 261) are supplied via the P/S converter 30 to the second signal processing circuit 40 which measures the error rate for each light beam system and outputs error rate data ED3 (ED1 to ED1) of the light beam system 33 (light beam systems 31 to 31)   and sets the bias voltage value V1 which minimizes the value<br>
ED3 (ED,, EDj, ED,	).<br>
In  the  processes  of   Fig.   23   and  their<br><br>
modifications, if there is no record data unreadable light beam system, the bias voltage value V1 is set so that the average jitter amount (average error rate) of all the five light beams becomes iftinimum. Instead, even if there is no record data unreadable light beam system, the jitter amount of the binarized RF signal or the error rate of read record data may be measured for predetermined two or more light beam systems among the n = 5 light beams 31 to 31, such as two systems of the light beams 31 and 31, two systems of the light beams 3j and 31, and three systems of the light beams 31, 33, and 35. The averages of these measured j itter amounts or error rates are used for the focus bias adjustment. Also in this case, it is possible to avoid a poor in-focus state of a light beam on the signal plane 1, irrespective of the surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, and record data can be reliably read from CD-ROM 1.<br>
Instead of measuring the error rate of data symbols read from CD-ROM 1, an error rate of sub-codes read from CD-ROM 1 may be measured to perform the focus bias adjustment.<br>
Also in the above embodiments, although CD-ROM is rotated at a constant linear velocity, it may be rotated at a constant angular velocity (CfiV). Other optical discs with a spiral track of the type different from CO-ROM may also be used such as CD-WO, DVD, DVD-ROM and DVD-RAM, or other optical discs with a concentric track<br><br>
may also be used such as LD and MO. The number of light beams for reading record data on tracks at the same time may be 3, 7 or the like instead of 5.<br>
system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig, 9. After the light beams 31 to 31 are focused in the track-on state on the tracks (x+5) to (x+8), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS1 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 261  the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the four beams 31 to 34 and by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(5) Second Specific Read/write Operation {read unable by the light beam system 31, refer to Figs. 11 and 12) (5-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there is one record data unreadable system of the light beam 31, the system controller 50 allocates M = 3 light beams 31 to 83 as the read systems of h light beams, where M is the maximum number of adjacent light beam systems usable, which is "3" or a combination of light beams 3i to 31 and M 2 3. The continuous read rotation number I is set as I = 1, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (M-2) = 1 (Step S35). The second focus bias adjustment shown in<br><br>
Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or Ss is included in the h = 3 read light beams 31 to 31 (Step S36). In this example, since the light beam 31 is included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from V1 + W1.<br>
The vicinal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest P3 and the nearest Pj1 along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points Pi to P3 of the three read light beams 31 to 33, so that Pj is very near to the signal plane 1. P1 and P3 are also very near to the signal plane 1 as shown in Fig. 7(2). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to folio a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, any of the in-focus points P1 to P3 of the light beams 31 to 31 does not move greatly spaced from the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 31 to 33 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (5-2)  Data Head Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data RT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track limp direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focused in the track-on<br><br>
state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step S35).<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 11 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 33 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-l) to (x+1) (refer to III in Fig. 11), Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-l) to (x+1) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, and photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263. When all the frame sync detection signals FS, to FS3 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controllers 3I1 to 3I3 indicated by the read system information "1, 2, 3" write one block after another the data DATA1 to DATA3 output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263, into the first areas of the memories 321 to 321, and writes the A-time data AT1 to ATj corresponding<br><br>
to the data DRTA1 to DflTA1 and the pairs of start addresses A1g to R11 and end addresses A11 to A31 in the memories 321 to 321, into the first areas of the memories 331 to 333. In the example shown in Fig. 11, in the first areas of the memories 331 to 331, the R-time data is written from the frames of 23:40:60, 23:41:00, and 23:41:15 (refer to Fig. 12).<br>
The read controller 34 received the specific read/write command checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the first areas of the memories 331 to SSj indicated by the read system information "1, 2, 3" and used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory SSj, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 33; is contained in the first area of the memory 331.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = one rotation (in actual, slightly more than one rotation) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig- 11, the contents of the first areas of the memories 331 to 384 become as shown in Fig. 12 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 311 to 3I3 to intercept the write<br><br>
A Operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the first areas among the memories 331 to 331 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of a-time starting from the oldest a-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 321 to 323 where data DATAj1 to DftTA1 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:41:29 is output.<br>
The write controllers 31-1 to 3I3 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation. The system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a track jump by J = 1 track in the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 11. after the light beams 31 to 33 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+1) to (x+3), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FSj1 to FS3 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 261, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34,<br>
The  controller  34  received  the  track  jump<br><br>
completion notice supplies the resume command to the write controllers 311 to 3I3, and the write controllers 311 to 3I3 received the resume command write the data DATAj to DftTAg output from the first signal processing circuits 26i to 263 after the track jump, this time into the second areas of the memories 321 to 321, and writes the A-time data AT1 to AT1 corresponding to the data DATA1 to DATAj and the pairs of start addresses a11 to 333 and end addresses a11 to a11 in the memories 32j to 323, into the second areas of the memories 331 to 333. In the example shown in Fig. 11, in the second areas of the memories 33i to 331, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:41:18, 23:41:33, and 23:41:48 (refer to Fig. 12).<br>
After the read controller 34 supplies the resume command, the read controller 34 checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the second areas of the memories 331 to 333 used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 333 is contained in the second area of the memory 331, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 331 is contained in the second area of the memory<br>
33i.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = one rotation {in actual,<br><br>
slightly more than one rotation) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 11, the contents of the second areas of the memories 331 to 333 become as shown in Fig. 12 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems "1, 2, 3". Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 31 j1 to 3I3 to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 3311 to 333 where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the A-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the second areas among the memories 3211 to 323 where data DATA1 to DATA3 were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:41:30 to the frame 23:41:62 is output.<br>
The write controllers Sl1 to Slj received the intercept command intercepts the read operation. The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 by the jump track number J = 1 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 11.  After the light beams 31 to 31   are<br><br>
focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-t-3) to (x+5), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FSj1 to FS1 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the three beams 31 to 33 and by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(6) Third Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by<br>
the light beam systems 31 and 31, refer to Figs. 13 and<br>
12)<br>
(6-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a fecord data unreadable system shows that there are two record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31 and 31, the system controller 50 allocates M = 3 light beams 31 to 33 as the read systems of h light beams, where M is the maximum number of adjacent light beam systems usable, which is "3" or a combination of light beams 31 to 33 and M &gt; 3. The continuous read rotation number I is set as 1=1, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (M-2) = 1 (Step S35). The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or 31 is included in the h = 3 read light beams<br><br>
3i to 33 (Step S36). In this example, since the light beam 31 is included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from V1 + W;1.<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest Pj and the nearest P;1 along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points Pj1 to P3 of the three read light beams 31 to 33, so that Pj is very near to the signal plane 1. P1 and P3 are also very near to the signal plane 1 as shown in Fig. 7(2). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, any of the in-focus points P1 to P3 of the light beams 31 to 33 does not move greatly spaced from the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 31 to 33 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (6-2)  Data Head Operation<br>
after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 311 at the innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step<br><br>
S35).<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig- 13 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 83 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1) (refer to III in Fig. 13). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, and photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS3 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, quite similar to the case shown in Fig. 11, an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately one rotation, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 1, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately one rotation, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 1 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 13) to read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and<br><br>
omitted.<br>
(7) Fourth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam systems 3j1 and 31,   refer to Fig. 14) (7-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment Process<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are two record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31 and 35, the system controller 50 allocates M = 3 light beams 3j to 31 as the read systems of h light beams, where M is the maximum number of adjacent light beam systems unable, which is "3" or a combination of light beams 31 to 31 and M &gt; 3. The continuous read rotation number I is set as 1=1, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (M-2) = 1 (Step S35). The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 3i or 35 is included in the h = 3 read light beams 3; to 31 (Step S36). In this example, since the light beam 3;i or 35 is not included, the second focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to change V1 from the value of V1 = V1 + W1 to the value of V1 = Vj + Wj (Wj 
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest P3 and the nearest P1 along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points Pj to P1 of the three read light beams S2  to<br><br>
31, so that all the in-focus points P1 to P1 are very near to the signal plane 1 (refer to Fig. 7(3)). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, all the in-focus points P1 to P1 are maintained very near to the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 31 to 31 systems can more reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1 than the case of Fig. 7(2). (7-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT1 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 3; =** "111 innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step S35) .<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 14 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by three tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 31 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1). Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) to<br><br>
(x+1) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 261 and photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1 to FS1 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 263 to 26,, the specific read/write conunand including the read system information "2, 3, 4" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, nearly similar to the case shown in Fig. 11 {in the case of Fig. 14, the write controllers 3I2 and 311 control to write the data DATA1 and DATA1 and a-tiine data AT1 and AT1 output from the first signal processing circuits 262 to 26,, into the memories 321 and 32, and 331 to 33,, and with reference to the the B-time data and start and end addresses stored in the memories 332 31*1 114" *11 read controller 34 controls to read record data stored in the memories 33; and 33, in the order of At-time by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted), an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately one rotation, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 1, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately one rotation, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 1 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 14) to sequentially read record<br><br>
data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
(8) Fifth Specific Read/write Operation {read unable by the light beams 31 and 35, refer to Figs. 15 and 16) (8-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If a judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are two record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31 and 35, then only two light beams 33 and 31 are adjacent each other among the remaining three light beams 3-1, 33, and 31. In reading at high speed record data of CD-ROM 1 by repetitively performing continuous record data read by approximately two rotations and track jump, it is necessary to read record data only with adjacent light beams. High speed read is possible even for a combination of read light beams not completely adjacent each other, if continuous record data read of CD-ROM 1 during a plurality of rotations and track jump by predetermined tracks are repeated.<br>
Specifically, continuously reading record data with data readable light beams during approximately (R+l) rotations and track jump by (Q-l) tracks in the forward direction can be repeated if Q is 2 or larger and R is 0 or larger, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the record data readable<br><br>
light beam systems, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams.<br>
In the example shown in Figs. 15 and 16, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 3j and the outermost light beam is the light beam 31 so that Q = 3. In the adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the light beams 311 and 31, the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is "1" because there is only the light beam 32- As the h read light beam systems, all the three record data readable light beam systems 3;1, 33, and 31 are allocated. The continuous read rotation number I is set as I = {R + 1) =2, and the read track jump number J is set toJ= (Q-1) =2 (Step S35). The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or 35 is included in the h = 3 read light beams 31, 31, and 31 (Step S36) . In this example, since the light beam 31 is included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing Vj from V1 + W1.<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest Pj and the nearest P1 along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points Pj, P3, and P, of the three read light beams 3,1, 33, and 3,, so that the in-focus point P1 is very near<br><br>
to the signal plane and also the in-focus points P1 and P3 are also near the signal plane 1 (refer to Fig. 7(2)). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, all the in-focus points P1, Pj, and P4 are maintained very near to the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 31, 31, and 31 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (8-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 3i at the innermost circumference among the h = 3 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step S35) .<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 15 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31, 3.,, and 34 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1), (x+1), and (x+2).  Then, reading the record data on the<br><br>
tracks (x-1) to (x+2) at the same time starts, by using three systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263 and photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1, FS3, and FS4 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 261, 263, and 261, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 3, 4" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controllers 31i, 3I3, and 311 indicated by the read system information "1, 3, 4" write one block after another the data DRTAj, DATA3, and DATA4 output from the first signal processing circuits 26i1, 26j, and 261, into the first areas of the memories 321, 323, and 321, and writes the A-time data AT1, AT3, and AT1 corresponding to the data DATA1, DATA3, and DATA1 and the pairs of start addresses h11, A3S, and fijg and end addresses R11, R11, and R11 in the memories 321, 323, and 321, into the first areas of the memories 331, 333, and 331. In the example shown in Fig. 15, in the first areas of the memories 3311, SSj, and 384, the fl-time data is written from the frames of 23:40:60, 23:41:15, and 23:41:30 (refer to Fig. 16).<br>
The  read  controller  34  received  the  specific read/write command checks whether there is no omission<br><br>
of record data read with each read system, by referring to tJie first areas of the memories 331, 333, aftd 331 indicated by the read system information "1, 3, 4" and used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 331 is contained in the first area of the memory SSj, and that the A-time one frame before the start A-time data in the first area of the memory 333 is contained in the first area of the memory 331.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations {in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position IV shown in Fig. 15, the contents of the first areas of the memories 33j1, 333, artd 331 become as shown in Fig. 16 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems. Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers 31;1, 3I3, and to 31, to intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the first areas among the memories 331, 333, and 33, where data were written at the present read cycle, the read contiroller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the oldest A-time, relative to the data stored in the first areas among the memories 321, 323, and 32, where data DATA1, DATA3, and DATA, were written at<br><br>
the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:40:60 to the frame 23:41:59 is output.<br>
The write controllers 311, 311, and 311 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation. The system controller 50 received the track jump command supplies the servo circuit 23 with the track jump command indicating a track jump by 3=2 tracks in the forward direction to thereby jump the optical pickup 2 from the position IV to a position V shown in Fig. 15. After the light beams 31, 33, and 34 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+3), (x+5), and (x+6), reading record data resumes. When all the frame sync detection signals FS1, FS3, and FS1 of H level are output from the first signal processing circuits 261, 261, and 264, the track jump completion notice is read and supplied to the controller 34.<br>
The controller 34 received the track jump completion notice supplies the resume command to the write controllers 311, 3I3, and 311, and the write controllers 311, 3I3, and 311 received the resume command write the data DATAj1, DATA3, and DATA1 output from the first signal processing circuits 261, 263, and 264 after the track jump, this time into the second areas of the memories 321, 323, and 323, and writes the A-time data AT1, fiTj, and AT, corresponding to the data DATAi1, DfiTft3,<br><br>
and DATflj and the pairs of start addresses a1g, a11, and a1g and end addresses a11, a11, and a11 in the memories 321 to 323, into the second areas of the memories 3311, BSj, and 331. In the example shown in Fig. 15, in the second areas of the memories 33i1, 333, and 331, the A-time data is written from the frames of 23:41:48, 23:42:03, and 23:42:18 (refer to Fig. 16).<br>
After the read controller 34 supplies the jresume command, the read controller 34 checks whether there is no omission of record data read with each read system, by referring to the second areas of the memories 331, 333, and 331 used at the present read cycle to confirm that the A-time one frame before the start A-tirae data in the second area of the memory 33, is contained in the second area of the memory 333, and that the A-tinie one frame before the start A-time data in the second area of the memory 333 is contained in the second area of the memory 33j1.<br>
After the read operation by the optical pickup 2 is performed approximately I = two rotations (in actual, slightly more than two rotations) and the optical pickup 2 reaches a position VI shown in Fig. 15, the contents of the second areas of the memories 331, SSj, and 331 become as shown in Fig. 16 and there is no omission of record data read with the read systems "1, 3, 4". Therefore, the read controller 34 supplies the intercept command to the write controllers Sl1j, 3I3, and 3I4 to<br><br>
intercept the write operation, and supplies the track jump command to the system controller 50. With reference to the A-time data and the start and end addresses stored in the second areas among the memories 33;i, 383, and 33, where data were written at the present read cycle, the read controller 34 controls to read record data in the order of A-time starting from the A-time next to the one block data lastly output to the second signal processing circuit 40 at the preceding read cycle, relative to the data stored in the second areas among the memories 32,, 321, and 32, where data DATAj1, DATA3, and DATA, were written at the present read cycle, and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40. In this example, the data from the frame 23:41:60 to the frame 23:42:47 is output.<br>
The write controllers 311, 3I3, and 311 received the intercept command intercepts the read operation. The system controller 50 received the track jump command controls to jump the optical pickup 2 by the jump track number J = 2 from the position VI to a position VII shown in Fig. 15. After the light beams 31, 83, and 3, are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x+7), (x+9), and (x+lO), reading record data resumes. Thereafter, similar operations are repeated to read at high speed desired record data from CD-ROM 1 by using the three beams 31, 31, and 31 and by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br><br>
For example, in order to read the record data from the 9 tracks from the track (x-1) to the track (x+7) shown in Fig. 15, only reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during four rotations and one track jump are required. Therefore, the record data can be read more rapidly than data is read with one light beam from CD-ROM 1 during 9 rotations.<br>
(9) Sixth Specific Read/write Operation {read unable by the light beams 31, 31,   and 31, refer to Fig. 17} (9-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment Process<br>
If a judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are three record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31, Sj and 3,, it is impossible to read record data with three adjacent light beam systems. However, similar to the case shown in Fig. 15, continuously reading record data with data readable light beams during approximately (R+1) rotations and track jump by (Q-1) tracks in the forward direction can be repeated if Q is 2 or larger and R is 0 or larger, where Q is the number of tracks representing a distance between the innermost light beam and outermost light beam among the record data readable light beam systems, and R is the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the innermost and outermost record data readable light beams.<br><br>
In the example shown in Fig. 17, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 31 and the outermost light beam is the light beam 3g so that Q = 2. In the adjacent record data lanreadable light beams between the light beams 31 and 31, the maximum number of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is "1" because there is only the light beam 31. fts the h read light beam systems, all the two record data readable light beam systems 31 and 31 are allocated. The continuous read rotation number I is set as I = (R +1) =2, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (Q - 1) =1 (Step S35). The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 31 or 31 is included in the h = 2 read light beams 31 and 31 (Step S36). In this example, since the light beam 35 is included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the two in-focus points P3 and the nearest P5 of the two read light beams 33 and 31 along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, so that the in-focus points P3 and P5 are very near to the signal plane (refer to Fig. 7(2)). Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, all the in-focus points P3 and P5 are maintained very near to the signal<br><br>
plane 1, and all the light beam 3, and 31 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (9-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the ft-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT, input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 31 at the innermost circumference among the h = 2 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step S35) .<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shoun in Fig. 17 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by two tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 3, and 3g are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) and (x+1) . Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) and (x+2) at the same time starts, by using two systems including the photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 26, and photodetector PD5 to first signal processing circuit 265. When all the frame sync detection signals FS, and FSj of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 263 and 261, the<br><br>
specific read/write command including the read system information "3, 5" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, nearly similar to the case shown in Fig. 15 (in the case of Fig. 17, the write controllers 3I3 and 3I5 control to write the data DflTAj and DATfls and A-time data AT1 and ATj output from the first signal processing circuits 263 and 261, into the memories 323 and 321 and 333 to SSj, and with reference to the the A-time data and start and end addresses stored in the memories 333 and 335, the read controller 34 controls to read record data stored in the memories 331 and 331 in the order of At-time by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted), an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately 1 = 2 rotations, jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 1, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately I = two rotations, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 1 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 17) to sequentially read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
For example, in order to read the record data from the 7 tracks from the track (x-l) to the track (x+5) shown in Fig. 17, only reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during four rotations and one track jump are required and the record data can be read more quickly than record data is read with one light beam during 7 rotations of<br><br>
CD-ROM 1.<br>
(10) Seventh Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beam 31, refer to Fig. 18) (10-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment Process<br>
If a judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there is one record data unreadable systems of the light beam 3,, it is possible to read the record data with the three light beam systems 31 to 31 as described with the case (5) above (refer to Fig. 11). However, if the case shown in Fig. 15 is incorporated, the record data can be read at higher speed.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 18, of the record data readable light beam systems, the innermost light beam is the light beam 31 and the outermost light beam is the light beam 31 so that Q = 4. In the adjacent record data unreadable light beams between the light beams 311 and 35, the maximum number R of adjacent record data unreadable light beams is "1". fts the h read light beam systems, all the four record data readable light beam systems 31 to 3,, and 3,= are allocated. The continuous read rotation number I is set as I = (R -1- 1) = 2, and the read track jump number J is set to J = (Q - 1) =3 (Step S35). The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 3,1 or 31 is included in the h = 4 read light beams 31 to 33, and 31<br><br>
(Step S36). In this example, since the light beams 31 and Sj are included, the second focus bias adjustment process is terminated without changing V1 from V1 + W1.<br>
The signal plane 1 is therefore positioned at the middle of the remotest P3 and the nearest P1 (P5) along the optical direction of the objective lens 8, among the in-focus points Pi to P1, and P5 of the four read light beams 31 to 31, 3nd 31, so that the in-focus points are very near to the signal plane (refer to Fig. 7{2) ) . Thereafter, the objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, all the in-focus points Pj1 to P3, and P5 are maintained very near to the signal plane 1, and all the light beam 3j to 31, and 31 systems can reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. (10-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 3i at the innermost circumference among the h = 4 read light beams is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) one track inner than the track X containing the read start point of the A-time (Step S35) .<br><br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 18 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by four tracks in the forward direction so that the light beams 31 to 31, and 31 are focussed in the track-on state on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1), and (x + 3) (refer to III in Fig. 18) . Then, reading the record data on the tracks (x-1) to (x+1) and (x+3) at the same time starts, by using four systems including the photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 261, photodetector PDj to first signal processing circuit 261, and photodetector PD1 to first signal processing circuit 265. When all the frame sync detection signals FSj1 to FS3, and FS5 of H level are input from the first signal processing circuits 261 to 263, and 265, the specific read/write command including the read system information "1, 2, 3, 5" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br>
Thereafter, nearly similar to the case shown in Fig. 15 (in the case of Fig. 18, the write controllers 3I1 to 3I3 and 3I5 control to write the data DRTA1 to DATA3 and DATA, and A-time data AT11 to AT3 and ATg output from the first signal processing circuits 2611 to 263 and 265, into the memories 321 to 323 and 321 and 3311 "to 333 and 335, and with reference to the the A-time data and start and end addresses stored in the memories 331 to 333<br><br>
and 335, the read controller 34 controls to read record data stored in the memories 331 to 333 and 335 in the order of At-time by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted), an operation of reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately 1 = 2 rotations, jumping the optical pickup by the tracK jump number J = 3, again reading record data from CD-ROM 1 by approximately I = two rotations, and jumping the optical pickup by the track jump number J = 3 is repeated (refer to III to VII in Fig. 18) to sequentially read record data at high speed in the record order by preventing the record data from being duplicated and omitted.<br>
For example, in order to read the record dat1 from the 11 tracks from the track x to the track (x+10) shown in Fig. 18, only reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during four rotations and one track j ump are required. In contrast, the case shown in Fig. 11 requires reading the record data of CD-ROM 1 during four rotations and three track j umps.<br>
(11) Eighth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable<br>
by the light beams 3j, 31, and 31, refer to Figs. 19 and<br>
20)<br>
(11-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are three record data unreadable systems of the light beams 3;1, 31, and 31,<br><br>
record data is omitted if it is read with the remaining two adjacent light beam 31 and 31 by repetitively performing data read of CD-ROM 1 during one rotation or more and track jump in the forward direction. In this case, record data is continuously read from CD-ROM 1 by using the record data readable one light beam system.<br>
Specifically, as the h read light beam system, the record data readable light beam 33 near at the center is allocated among the record data readable light beams 31 and 33. The continuous read rotation number I is set infinite, and the read track jump number J is set to J = 0.<br>
The second focus bias adjustment shown in Fig. 5 is executed to check whether the light beam 311 or 35 is included in the h = 1 read light beam 33 (Step S36) . In this example, since the light beams 31 and 35 are not included, then it is checked whether the light beam 31 or 31 is included {Step S38). In this example, since the light beam is included, the focus vias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to change the value V1 from the value of Vj + Wj1 to the value of V1 + W1 (W1 
The signal plane 1 becomes therefore coincident with the in-focus points P1 and P3 of the read light beams 31 and 3, (refer to Fig. 7(3)).  Thereafter, the<br><br>
objective lens 8 moves to follow a surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, under the control of the focus servo system, the record data of CD-ROM 1 can be reliably read with the light beam 31  system. (11-2)  Data Read Operation<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, in accordance with the A-time data representative of the latest A-time data AT3 input from the first signal processing circuit 263 and the read start point A-time designated by the host computer, the track jump direction and number are determined so that the light beam 33 at the innermost circumference among the h = 1 read light beam is focussed in the track-on state on the track x (Step S35).<br>
If the optical pickup 2 is at a position II shown in Fig. 19 after the second focus bias adjustment process is completed, the optical pickup 2 is jumped from the position II by two tracks in the forward direction so that the light beam 31 is focussed in the track-on state on the track (x-1) (refer to III in Fig. 19). Then, reading the record data on the track x, by using one system including the photodetector PD3 to first signal processing circuit 263. When the frame sync detection signal FS3 of H level is input from the first signal processing circuit 263, the specific read/write command including the read system information "3" is supplied to the P/S converter 30.<br><br>
Upon reception of the specific read/write command via the read controller 34, only the write controller 3I3 indicated by the read system information "3" writes one block after another the data DATA3 output from the first signal processing circuits 263, into the first areas of the memories 323, and writes the A-time data AT3 corresponding to the data DATA3 and the pairs of start addresses A33 and end addresses Aj1 in the memory 323, into the first areas of the memory 333, In the example shown in Fig. 19, in the first areas of the memory 333, the A-time data is written from the frame of 23:40:60 (refer to Fig. 20).<br>
Since only one record data read light beam is used as indicated by the read system information "3", the read controller 34 received the specific read/write command refers to the first areas of the memory 333 indicated by the read system information "3" and used at the present read cycle to read the data in the A-time order starting from the oldest A-time from the first area of the memory 323 and outputs the read data to the second signal processing circuit 40, without outputting the intercept command and track jump command. Therefore, the optical pickup 2 will not be jumped, and as CD-ROM rotates, the record data from the track (x-1) is sequentially read with the optical beam 33 and output to the second signal processing circuit 40, by preventing the record data from being omitted.<br><br>
(12) Ninth Specific Read/write Operation (read unable by the light beams 31, 31, 31,   and 31, refer to Fig, 21) (11-1) Second Focus Bias Adjustment<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a jrecord data unreadable system at Step S33 shown in Fig. 5 shows that there are four record data unreadable systems of the light beams 31, 31, 31, and 35, record data is omitted if it is read with only one remaining light beam 33 by repetitively performing data read of CD-ROM 1 during one rotation or more and track jump in the forward direction. Also in this case, record data is continuously read from CD-ROM 1,<br>
Specifically, as the h read light beam system, the record data readable light beam Sg is allocated among the h record data readable light beam. The continuous read rotation number I is set infinite, and the read track jiamp number J is set to J = 0 (Step S35) .<br>
Thereafter, quite similar to the case shown in Fig. 19, the second focus bias adjustment process is performed to change the value V1 by - W1 (Step S40), and the optical pickup is jumped in the forward direction to make the light beam 31 in the track-on state on the track (x-1) to read record data from the track (x-1) with the light beam 31. In this case, V1 = (V1+WJ - W1 = Vf, and the light beam 31 is in the perfect in-focus state as shown in Fig. 7(1).<br>
In the above embodiments, if all the five light<br><br>
beam systems 31 to 31 can read the record data, the signal plane of CD-ROM 1 is set at just the middle of the remotest in-focus point and nearest in-focus point and at the center of the five in-focus points P1 to Pg of the light beams 31 to 31 along the optical axis direction of the objective lens 8. If some of the five light beam systems 31 to 31 cannot read the record data, the signal plane of CD-ROM 1 is set at just the middle of the remotest in-focus point and nearest in-focus point and at the center of the h read light beams along the optical axis direction of the objective lens 8. Therefore, if all the five light beam systems 31 to 31 can read the record data, it is possible to avoid a poor in-focus state on the signal plane of the five light beams 31 to 35 and reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1. Similarly, even if some of the five light beam systems 31 to 31 cannot read the record data, it is possible to avoid a poor in-focus state on the signal plane 1 of the h read light beams and reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1.<br>
If all the five light beam systems 31 to 31 can read the record data, the system controller 50 performs the focus bias adjustment so that the signal plane of CD-ROM 1 is positioned at the center of the in-focus points P1 to P5 of the five light beams 31 to 85 along the optical axis direction of the objective lens 8. If some of the five light beam systems 31 to 31 cannot read the record<br><br>
data, the signal plane ot CD-ROM 1 is set at the middle of the in-focus points of the allocated h light beams. Therefore, if all the five light beam systems 31 to 31 can read the record data, it is possible to avoid a poor in-focus state on the signal plane of the five light beams 31 to 31 and reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1, regardless of the surface vibration of CD-ROM 1. Similarly, even if some of the five light beam systems 31 to 31 cannot read the record data, it is possible to avoid a poor in-focus state on the signal plane 1 of the h read light beams and reliably read the record data from CD-ROM 1, regardless of the surface vibration of CD-ROM 1.<br>
In the above embodiments, the number of light beams is set as n = 5. The number of light beams may be set to other values such as 7 and 9. For example, as shown in Fig. 22, if nine light beams 3. to 3, are used (focus error signal and tracking error signal are generated by using the light beam 31 reflected from the signal plane of CD-ROM), the first focus bias adjustment process makes the signal plane 1 be positioned just at the midst of the remotest in-focus point P5 and nearest in-focus point P1 (Pg) along the optical axis direction of the objective lens 8 (refer to Fig. 22(1)). If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there is no record data unreadable system, the light beams 31 to 3, are allocated<br><br>
as the h read light beams, and it is set that 1=1 and 3=7. The second focus bias adjustment process does not change the value V1 and retains the state of Fig, 22(1).<br>
If the judgement of a presence/absence of a record data unreadable system shows that there are two record data unreadable systems of the light beams 3j and 3g, the light beams 31 to Sg are allocated as the h read light beams, and it is set that 1=1 and J = 5. The second focus bias adjustment process changes the value V1 so that the signal plane is positioned at the middle of the remotest in-focus point P1 and nearest in-focus point P1 (Pg) along the optical direction of the objective lens 8 among the in-focus points of the seven read light beams (refer to Fig. 22(2)),<br>
Different from the above, if the light beam systems 3, and Sg cannot read record data, then Q = 8 and R = 2. Seven light beam systems 31 to 31 and Sg are allocated as the h read light beams. The continuous read rotation number I is set as I = (R+1) =3 and the track j ump number J is set as J = (Q-1) = 7. The second focus bias adjustment process does not change the value V1 and retains the state of Fig. 22(1).<br>
The first signal processing circuits 26i, 26;, 261, and 265 may be added with measuring circuits for measuring jitter amounts of the binarized RF signals and outputting jitter amount data JD-, JD1, JD,, and JD5, and<br><br>
the second focus bias adjustment process shown in Fig. 5 may be changed as illustrated in Fig. 23.<br>
Referring to Fig. 23, first the system controller 50 stores the value V1 set at the first focus bias adjustment process at Step S3 of Fig. 5 in its memory {not shown) as E (Step S109). Of the jitter amount data JD1 to JDj measured by the first signal processing circuits 26i to 265, jitter amount data JD1, JD1, . . . of the h read light beam systems are read and its average jd(0)" is stored in the memory (Step SllO).<br>
Next, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 22, is controlled to increase V1 by AV (positive value) from E (V) and the jitter amount data JD1, JDj,, . . . of the h read light beams systems are read and an average value thereof is stored stored in the memory as jd(+l)". The voltage Vj is decreased by AV (negative value) from E (V) and the jitter amount data JD1, JDj,, . . . of the h read light beams systems are read and an average value thereof is stored stored in the memory as jd(-l)" (Step Sill).<br>
The values jd(+l)", jdCO)", and jd(-l)" are compared and if jd( + l)" &gt; jd(0)"<jd at step s112 the average jitter amount is minimum v1="E" and it can be considered that signal plane of cd-rom positioned middle in-focus points></jd>
Pi, Pj, P1"--- of the h read light beams 31, 3j, 31,	<br>
along the optical axis of the objective lens 8, that all<br><br>
the h read light beams are in an optimum state of perfect in-focus, and that there is no light beam in a state far from the perfect in-focus state. Therefore, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to set V1 to E (V) (Step S113).<br>
If jd(+l)"  jd(0)" <jd at step s114 it is set that k="2" s115 and v1="E" av the jitter amount jd1 . of h read light beams are stored as jd s116 if> jd(+l) " <jd at step s117 the average jitter amount is minimum v1="E" au and it can be considered that signal plane of cd-rom positioned middle in-focus points p1 p ... h read light beams . along optical axis objective lens all are in an optimum state perfect there no beam a far from state. therefore focus bias voltage generator circuit controlled to set vj e av s118></jd>
If not jd(+2)" &gt; jd(+l)" <jd at step s117 the value k is incremented to s119 and flow returns s116 repeat above operations. if jd> jd{+(k-l)}" <jd at step s117 the average j itter amount is minimum vf="{+(k-l)}" and it can be considered that all></jd><br>
the in-focus points P1, P1, P1, . . . of the h read light beams 31, 31, 31,-.. are in an optimum state of perfect in-focus.  Therefore, the focus bias voltage generator circuit 221 is controlled to set V1 to to E + {+(k-l)} ■ (AV) (Step S118).<br>
If not jd(+l)"  jd(-l)" <jd at step s122 the average jitter amount is minimum u1="E" av and it can be considered that all in-focus points p pj p11 . of h read light beams are in an optimum state perfect relative to signal plane therefore focus bias voltage generator circuit controlled set vj e s123></jd>
If not jd(0)" &gt; jd(-l)" <jd step s122 the value k is incremented to s124 and flow returns s121 repeat above operations. if jd> jd{-(k-l)}" <jd at step s122 the average jitter amount is minimum v1="E" and it can be considered that all in-focus points p1 pj p of h read light beams are in an optimum state perfect relative to signal plane therefore focus bias voltage generator circuit controlled set e></jd><br>
AV (Step S123).<br>
After the second focus bias adjustment is completed in the above manner, all the h read light beams 31, 31, 3j,, . . . can enter the perfect in-focus state relative to the signal plane 1, and the in-focus state of the h read light beams relative to the signal plane can be optimized with ease. Thereafter, since the objective lens 8 moves to follow the surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, any of the h read light beams will not become far from the perfect in-focus relative to the signal plane 1, and any of the h read light beam systems can reliably read record data from CD-ROM 1.<br>
In the second focus bias adjustment processes illustrated in Fig. 6 {Fig. 23), the bias voltage value Vf is determined so that the jitter amount data JD3 (average jitter amount data JD., JD1, JDj1, . . , ) measured by the first signal processing circuit 263 (circuits 261, 26, 26;,,...) becomes minimum to thereby make the light beam 33 temporarily enter the in-focus state. Instead, the first signal processing circuit 263 (circuits 261 to 265) may be provided with error detection/correction circuits which descramble the EFM demodulated data in the unit of one block, perform error detection/correction based on CIRC codes (error detection/correction with P parities, deinterleaveing, error detection/correction with Q parities), measure error rates detected through error detection with P<br><br>
parities, and output error rate data ED3 (EF1 to ED5) . JD3 (3D,, JDj, JD1,...) in Fig. 6 (Fig. 23) are replaced by ED3 (ED1, EDj, ED1,, . . .) , and the bias voltage value U1 is set so that the value ED1 (ED., EDj, ED1,, . . .) becomes minimum and the light beam 31 is focussed onto the signal plane 1. in this manner, the second focus bias adjustment may be performed.<br>
Measuring the error rate for each light beam system may be performed by the second signal processing circuit. Specifically, the second signal processing circuit 40 is provided with an error detection/correction circuit which measures an error rate detected through error detection with P parities when perform error detection/correction based on CIRC codes (error detection/correction with P parities, deinterleaveing, error detection/correction with Q parities) is performed, and outputs the measured error rate. For the focus bias adjustment, the data DATA3 (data DATRi to DATA5) output from the first signal processing circuit 263 (261 to 265) are supplied via the P/S converter 30 to the second signal processing circuit 40 which measures the error rate for each light beam system and outputs error rate data ED3 (EDj1 to ED5) of the light beam system 31 (light beam systems 31 to 31) and sets the bias voltage value Vj which minimizes the value ED3 (ED,, ED., ED1, ...).<br>
In  the  processes   of  Fig.   23  and  their<br><br>
modifications, if there is no record data unreadable light beam system, the bias voltage value V1 is set so that the average jitter amount (average error rate) of all the five light beams becomes minimum.  Instead, even if there is no record data unreadable light beam system, the jitter amount of the binarized RF signal or   the error rate of read record data may be measured for predetermined two or more light beam systems among the n = 5 light beams 3, to 31, such as two systems of the light beams 31  and 31,   two systems of the light beams 31 and 31, and three systems of the light beams 31, 31,   and Sg.  The averages of these measured jitter amounts or error rates are used for the focus bias adjustment, also in this case, it is possible to avoid a poor in-f ocus state of a light beam on the signal plane 1, irrespective of the surface vibration of CD-ROM 1, and record data can be reliably read from CD-ROM 1.<br>
Instead of measuring the error rate of data symbols read from CD-ROM 1, an error rate of sub-codes read from CD-ROM 1 may be measured to perform the focus bias adjustment.<br>
Also in the above embodiments, although CD-ROM is rotated at a constant linear velocity, it may be rotated at a constant angular velocity (CRV). Other optical discs with a spiral track of the type different from CD-ROM may also be used such as CD-WO, DVD, DVD-ROM and DVD-RAM, or other optical discs with a concentric track<br><br>
may also be used such as LD and MO. The number of light beams for reading record data on tracks at the same time may be 3, 7 or the like instead of 5.</jd></jd></jd></jd></jd></jd></jd></td>
