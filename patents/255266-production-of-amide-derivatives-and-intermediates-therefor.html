These intermediate compounds can be used not only for the production of the above-mentioned compound [XVI] but also for the production of various other compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The above-mentioned compound [XVI] useful as an HIV protease inhibitor is known as described in W095/09843. This compound [XVI] has been conventionally produced from serine as a starting material by increasing carbon and through numerous other steps inclusive of stereoselective reduction of carbonyl group.

difficult. Moreover, this US patent does not suggest production of a specific enantiomer of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for stereoselectively and extremely efficiently producing the above-mentioned compound [XVI] useful as an HIV protease inhibitor upon solution of the above-mentioned problems. Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel intermediate compound useful for producing said compound, and a production method thereof.<br>
