COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10 and rule 13]<br>
Title: “METHOD FOR SPECIFYING AND VALIDATING UNTIMED NETS”<br>
Name and address of the Applicant:<br>
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION, 1, North Castle<br>
Drive, Armonk, New York 10504, USA<br>
Nationality: United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.<br>
2<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
This invention was made with United States Government support under<br>
Agreement No. HR0011-07-9-002 awarded by DARPA. The Government has certain<br>
rights in the invention.<br>
Integrated circuits may typically be designed using two basic design stages.<br>
The first design stage, known as the Register Transfer Level (RTL), describes the<br>
behavior of a circuit in terms of logical functions using registers and combinational<br>
logic, e.g., logic gates. The RTL may be verified against a higher level specification,<br>
such as for example, an instruction architecture. The verification of the RTL entails<br>
simulation and other means to ensure that the RTL design performs its intended<br>
functions. The second design stage is the Physical Design (PD). This stage represents<br>
the same circuit design in what will be its actual layout using physical components,<br>
e.g., transistors. The PD is conventionally tested in two separate ways. The first test<br>
uses Static Timing Analysis (STA) to verify that the PD of the circuit can correctly<br>
operate at a target frequency. The second test is a Boolean equivalence test between<br>
the RTL and the PD. It should be noted that a verification of the RTL is independent of<br>
the PD, whereas the Boolean equivalence test relies on both the RTL and the PD.<br>
Certain parts of a circuit may not be required to operate at the target frequency for a<br>
variety of reasons, and thus may be bypassed during STA and may be considered<br>
“untimed.” These untimed sections may typically be manually denoted in the PD for<br>
the STA to recognize. Manually denoting untimed sections of a circuit is tedious and<br>
may not directly translate to the RTL from the PD. As such the conventional method of<br>
denoting untimed sections of a circuit in the PD is not versatile in the event of a circuit<br>
redesign.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an example circuit design system 100, which includes an RTL<br>
102 and a PD 104. Once a circuit is designed in RTL 102, the circuit design then<br>
undergoes a synthesis 106 to produce PD 104. Of course synthesis is not required. In<br>
some example circuit design systems, a PD may be custom designed.<br>
More specifically, RTL 102 contains the functional design of the circuit. The<br>
synthesis process 106 refines this design into PD 104, thereby maximizing some aspect<br>
of the circuit’s performance or design; i.e. speed, or type of components. PD 104 still<br>
performs the expected function, within its respective embodiment. The internal design<br>
3<br>
of PD 104 however, does not necessarily mirror RTL 102. This will be described in<br>
more detail with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram example of a design process 200, which<br>
includes an RTL 202 and a PD 204. RTL 202 contains a circuit 208, which includes<br>
macros 210, 212, and 214 connected by net 222. A macro is a block of circuit<br>
components that can be designed independently of other macros and iterated. Circuit<br>
208 has one input 216 and two outputs 218 and 220. PD 204 is synthesized from RTL<br>
202 via synthesis process 106. PD 204 contains circuit 224, which corresponds to<br>
circuit 208 of RTL 202. Circuit 224 includes three macros 226, 228, and 230<br>
connected by net 223, which correspond to macros 210, 212, and 214 connected by net<br>
222, respectively. Circuit 224 has one input 225 and two outputs 229 and 231. Circuit<br>
208 inputs example test values 232 and outputs values 234. Likewise, circuit 224<br>
inputs example signals 236 and outputs signals 238.<br>
In operation, circuit 208 in the RTL 202 should input test value stream 232 on<br>
input pin 216 and output the value streams in output 234 on output pins 218 and 220.<br>
After synthesis 106, PD 204 will contain circuit 224 that will input the test signal<br>
stream 236 on pin 225 and output the signal streams in output 238 on pins 229 and 231.<br>
[0007] Using a Boolean verification test, the input tests 232 and 236 should match in<br>
value within their respective embodiments. Likewise, output tests 234 and 238 should<br>
also match in value, respectively. The existence of a discrepancy in either input values<br>
or output values between RTL 202 and PD 204 might indicate a design flaw or process<br>
flaw.<br>
While macros 210, 212 and 214 may correspond to macros 226, 228 and 230,<br>
respectively, macros 210, 212 and 214 are internally different from macros 226, 228<br>
and 230, respectively, due to the synthesis process 106. This is because synthesis 106<br>
changes the design of circuit 224 based on a desired performance/design aspect while<br>
maintaining its overall input/output function. Therefore, Boolean verification only<br>
checks for the equivalence of input and output values of both layers.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a more detailed example of a circuit design within a RTL. In<br>
the figure, circuit 300 has three macros 302, 304 and 306. Each macro is designed to<br>
4<br>
perform a specific function. In this example, each macro consists of combinational<br>
logic and latches designed to manipulate signals according to a desired function.<br>
[0010] Macro 302 includes AND gate 316, AND gate 318, OR gate 320 and a latch<br>
322. Macro 302 has four inputs 308, 310, 312 and 314. Inputs 308 and 310 feed AND<br>
gate 316, whereas inputs 312 and 314 feed AND gate 318. The output of AND gate<br>
316 and the output of AND gate 318 feed OR gate 320. The output of OR gate 320<br>
feeds the input of latch 322. The output of latch 322 is the output of Macro 302.<br>
Macro 304 includes AND gate 326 and a latch 328. Macro 304 has a first input<br>
from a net 323 and a second input 325. First input from node 323 and second input 325<br>
feed AND gate 326. The output of AND gate 326 feeds the input of latch 328. The<br>
output of latch 328 is the output 329 of Macro 304.<br>
Macro 306 includes AND gate 332 and a latch 330. Macro 306 has a first input<br>
from a net 323 and a second input 334. First input from node 323 and second input 334<br>
feed AND gate 332. The output of AND gate 332 feeds the input of latch 330. The<br>
output of latch 330 is the output 336 of Macro 306.<br>
In operation, input signals are provided to inputs 308, 310, 312 and 314 of<br>
macro 302. The signals are passed through combinational logic of gates 316, 318 and<br>
320. A resulting signal is provided to net 321. A clock signal from clock 324 enables<br>
latch 322 to sample the data on net 321 and to output the data to net 323. The clock<br>
signal from clock 324 may enable a latch by any known method, non-limiting examples<br>
of which include on the rising edge of a clock signal pulse, on the falling edge of a<br>
clock signal pulse, etc.<br>
From net 323, the data is then passed to macro 304 and macro 306. The logic<br>
of macro 304 is output at output 329, whereas the logic of macro 306 is output at output<br>
336. The data at each of output 329 and output 336 is known as the “state” of the<br>
latches therein, and may be changed on each clock pulse from of clock 324.<br>
Boolean verification may be performed on the output data for each macro or<br>
even on the inputs for each individual latch within each macro. As such, there should<br>
be latch correspondence between the RTL and PD. At the RTL, each macro, each latch<br>
and each gate is presumed to transmit data ideally in each clock cycle. Therefore, time<br>
delay based on specific physical parameters is not considered. Because the circuitry in<br>
5<br>
RTL is designed without consideration given to the time delays inherent in the<br>
electronic components, STA is not performed on the RTL.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a more detailed example of a circuit design within a PD that<br>
has been synthesized from RTL in FIG. 3, wherein the synthesis was set to produce a<br>
circuit that used only NAND gates and inverters. In FIG. 4, circuit 400 has three<br>
macros 402, 404 and 406.<br>
Macro 402 includes NAND gate 420, NAND gate 418, NAND gate 422 and a<br>
latch 424. Macro 402 has four inputs 408, 410, 412 and 414. Inputs 408 and 410 feed<br>
NAND gate 420, whereas inputs 412 and 414 feed NAND gate 418. The output of<br>
NAND gate 420 and the output of NAND gate 418 feed NAND gate 422. The output<br>
of NAND gate 422 feeds the input of latch 424. The output of latch 424 is the output of<br>
Macro 402.<br>
Macro 404 includes NAND gate 428, NOT gate 430 and a latch 432. Macro<br>
404 has a first input from a net 423 and a second input 426. First input from node 423<br>
and second input 426 feed NAND gate 428. The output of NAND gate 428 feeds the<br>
input of NOT gate 430. The output of NOT gate 430 feeds the input of latch 432. The<br>
output of latch 432 is the output 434 of Macro 404.<br>
Macro 406 includes NAND gate 438, NOT gate 440 and a latch 442. Macro<br>
406 has a first input from a net 423 and a second input 444. First input from node 423<br>
and second input 444 feed NAND gate 438. The output of NAND gate 438 feeds the<br>
input of NOT gate 440. The output of NOT gate 440 feeds the input of latch 442. The<br>
output of latch 442 is the output 446 of Macro 406.<br>
In some instances, the PD might include actual physical components as<br>
exemplified in circuit 403, which corresponds to NAND gate 418. In this example,<br>
circuit 403 includes a resistor 448, a transistor 450, a transistor 452, a resistor 454 and a<br>
resistor 456. For the sake of simplicity, circuit 400 is illustrated with a lower level<br>
logic symbol for each component.<br>
In operation, input signals are provided to inputs 408, 410, 412 and 414 of<br>
macro 402. The signals are passed through combinational logic of gates 420, 418 and<br>
422. A resulting signal is provided to latch 424. A clock signal from clock 436 enables<br>
latch 424 to sample the data from gate 422 and to output the data to net 423. The clock<br>
6<br>
signal from clock 436 may enable a latch by any known method, non-limiting examples<br>
of which include on the rising edge of a clock signal pulse, on the falling edge of a<br>
clock signal pulse, etc.<br>
From net 423, the data is then passed to macro 404 and macro 406. The logic<br>
of macro 404 is output at output 434, whereas the logic of macro 406 is output at output<br>
446. The data at each of output 434 and output 446 is known as the “state” of the<br>
latches therein, and may be changed on each clock pulse of clock 436.<br>
In operation, PD circuit 400 would operate much like RTL circuit 300.<br>
However, note that the internals of the macros are different due to synthesis. For<br>
example, macro 402 consists of a combinational logic of two NAND gates 420 and 418<br>
that are fed into NAND gate 422 to create a circuit of NAND gates that is identical in<br>
logical function to the combinational circuit of macro 302 in FIG. 3.<br>
Since the components in a PD are physical, inherent delays are present and must<br>
be considered in the design. If each NAND gate has a delay of X picoseconds, each<br>
latch has a total delay of 2X picoseconds, and each inverter with a delay of X/2<br>
picoseconds; then the longest path a signal would take would be from latch 424 through<br>
NAND gate 428, inverter 430 and to latch 432. Therefore the clock period of CLK 436<br>
must be larger than 2X + X + X/2 + 2X for a signal to be properly sampled into the<br>
latch 432. In addition to a signal’s total path delay being a concern in circuit design,<br>
the separate set-up and hold requirements inherent in every latch must be considered.<br>
So a STA on each latch is required to verify that all sequential storage elements of the<br>
circuit operate within the target clock frequency.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a wave diagram of set-up and hold times inherent in a latch.<br>
In the figure, clock signal 502 sends out a pulse train having a period 504. Included in<br>
clock signal 502 are a rising edge 506 and falling edge 508. A DATA signal 510<br>
includes a valid data portion 512, which is transmitted over a period 514. Included in<br>
period 514 is a set-up period 516 and a hold period 518.<br>
In operation, a clock signal 502 will pulse with period 504. Rising edge 506<br>
will trigger a sample action of DATA signal 510 into a latch. The data input into the<br>
latch must be valid data portion 512 before rising edge 506 arrives at the latch in order<br>
for the data to be properly sampled into the latch. This is known as the “set-up” time or<br>
7<br>
set-up period 516. The data must also still be valid for hold period 518, which is the<br>
period after the rising edge 506 has arrived. Set-up period 516 and hold period 518<br>
combine for a total time of period 514 that the data must be valid for proper sampling<br>
into a latch.<br>
During STA, an STA tool performs a set-up and hold test on each latch. A set<br>
up and hold test is a comparison of arrival times of clock and data on the latch input<br>
pins. The STA applies a “phase tag” to each clock signal, which it propagates to each<br>
clock input of each latch. The phase tag is a marker of which clock is clocking the<br>
latch. The STA also applies a phase tag to the output of each latch, based on which<br>
phase tag was propagated to the latch’s clock input. Such a phase tag is a marker of<br>
which edge of which clock is responsible for launching a transition from the output of<br>
the latch. The STA tool propagates the phase tag through each net in the path from the<br>
latch output to each other latch’s input, keeping track of arrival times at each point<br>
relative to the phase tag. If the difference is outside the time constraints of a target<br>
clock period, then a circuit redesign is possibly needed.<br>
It is sometimes desirable for the STA to ignore certain sections of a circuit for<br>
various reasons. For example, if macro 404 in FIG. 4 is used only for test purposes,<br>
then it would not need to follow the constraints of normal operation. Therefore, its<br>
timing would not matter. In this situation its phase tag at net 431 might be renamed to<br>
be “don’t-care.” In some cases, this is performed through a control file known as a<br>
“DCADJ” or “don’t-care and adjust” file. This effectively makes the circuit of net 431<br>
an “untimed” circuit, thus preventing STA from testing propagations through the<br>
specified circuit.<br>
There are problems with the use of the DCADJ file however. It is a<br>
specification of the untimed nets in a circuit; but it is essentially a human-written text<br>
file, making it tedious to create and maintain. Because it generally uses regular<br>
expressions to specify named nets to be untimed nets, the regular expressions may over<br>
specify nets. Also, any change to the design requires a rewrite of the DCADJ file as<br>
well. Because the nets do not necessarily correspond to the RTL design, it is also<br>
manual and tedious to locate the corresponding nets for change. Because the DCADJ<br>
file only specifies nets on the PD, there is no mapping of the corresponding nets<br>
between both the PD and RTL. This allows the check to become an “open-loop”<br>
8<br>
process where, an error on either side may go undetected until the manufacture of the<br>
unit.<br>
What is needed is a method of specifying untimed nets on both the RTL and PD<br>
of a system allowing for the automation of verification of the RTL and phase renaming<br>
in the STA of the PD.<br>

instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the invention, untimed nets are determined in<br>
the RTL to properly account for untimed nets in the verification of the RTL. One<br>
manner of verification of the RTL includes driving indeterminate values on untimed<br>
nets during simulation of the RTL. In some example embodiments, certain parts of a<br>
circuit in the RTL are annotated with a timing parameter, which is carried through to<br>
the PD. In some example embodiments, untimed nets within the RTL are annotated<br>
with an “untimed” parameter, which is carried through to the PD. Accordingly, all<br>
untimed nets developed in the PD, which originated from untimed nets in the RTL, will<br>
always have correct untimed annotations, even when modifications in the PD occur.<br>
11<br>
Example methods of designing an integrated circuit in accordance with an<br>
aspect of the invention will now be described with reference to FIGs. 1-6.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an example process 600 of designing an<br>
integrated circuit in accordance with an aspect of the invention.<br>
After process 600 starts (S602), the RTL of the integrated circuit is designed.<br>
Using the design process as illustrated in FIG. 1, a timing parameter may be associated<br>
with any untimed nets within RTL 102 (S604). After RTL 102 is created, a synthesis<br>
process 106 generates PD 104 (S606). At this point STA is then performed on PD 104<br>
(S608). Further, a verification process may be performed on RTL 102 (S610). It is<br>
then determined whether there are any failures in the STA on PD 104 or whether there<br>
are any failures in the verification of RTL 102 (S612). If there are any failures, then<br>
the RTL 102 is modified (S614) and the designing continues. If there are no failures, a<br>
Boolean equivalence test is performed between RTL 102 and PD 104 (S616). It is then<br>
determined whether there is Boolean equivalence between PD 104 and RTL 102 based<br>
the outcome of the Boolean equivalence test (S618). If there is Boolean equivalence<br>
between PD 104 and RTL 102, then the process stops (S620) and the circuit design is<br>
functionally acceptable. If there is not Boolean equivalence between PD 104 and RTL<br>
102, then the RTL 102 is modified (S614) and the designing continues.<br>
12<br>
The timing parameter that is associated with untimed nets within RTL 102 will<br>
carry through synthesis process 106 to PD 104. Nets in PD 104 that correspond to<br>
untimed nets within RTL 102 are untimed nets. Accordingly, any untimed nets<br>
developed in PD 104 that originated from untimed nets in RTL 102 will always have<br>
the correct untimed annotations associated therewith. RTL 102 and PD 104 may be<br>
developed by any method, i.e., drafted on paper, coded in a hardware description<br>
language (HDL) program, etc. Whatever the development method, an aspect in<br>
accordance with the invention may be applied, e.g., adding a timing parameter to<br>
untimed nets in the RTL, which will carry through synthesis and into the PD.<br>
In the more detailed illustration of FIG. 2, take the example that net 222 of RTL<br>
202 is untimed. Net 222 would then be attributed with a timing parameter with an<br>
untimed value in RTL 202. After RTL 202 undergoes synthesis process 106 to create<br>
PD 204, corresponding net 223 will have a timing parameter associated therewith,<br>
which indicates that net 223 is untimed. Therefore, in any case in which PD 204 is to<br>
be modified, it is known that any net that corresponds to net 222 will have an untimed<br>
timing parameter associated therewith.<br>
Assigning a timing parameter to untimed nets in the RTL in accordance with an<br>
aspect of the invention method automatically and accurately correlates untimed nets<br>
between the RTL and PD. Contrary to conventional design methods, in accordance<br>
with an aspect of the invention, a net in the PD that corresponds to an untimed net in<br>
the RTL will not be incorrectly labeled as a timed net, even if the PD is modified. In<br>
conventional systems, such a net in the PD may incorrectly be labeled as a timed net<br>
because of the conventional manual nature of correlating the named nets.<br>
In an example embodiment, an RTL may be written in a HDL, a non-limiting<br>
example of which includes the VHSIC HDL (VHDL). VHDL contains an “attribute”<br>
shell that can be applied to annotate parts of a circuit design. Using this construct, the<br>
attribute can then be used to specifically influence the processing of the circuit design.<br>
The attribute may be assigned to nets disposed in between macros or to the input of a<br>
macro that is connected to such a net. For example, if an attribute type named<br>
“TIMING_TYPE” were defined, one of its values could be “UNTIMED.” Returning to<br>
FIG. 3, if an element such as net 323 in FIG. 3 were named NET1_DC using VHDL,<br>
net 323 could be attributed with:<br>
13<br>
ATTRIBUTE TIMING_TYPE OF NET1_DC : SIGNAL IS UNTIMED.<br>
This attribute would indicate to the STA that all transitions through net 323<br>
would receive a phase rename causing its value to be don’t-care. This effectively<br>
causes net 323 into macros 304 and 306 to be untimed. On the other hand, taking the<br>
earlier example of using macro 404 in FIG. 4 to be instead used for testing purposes<br>
only, an attribute could be placed on input 331 of macro 304 of FIG. 3 if input 331<br>
were named pin “A” as follows:<br>
ATTRIBUTE TIMING_TYPE OF A : SIGNAL IS UNTIMED.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the attribute associated with input<br>
331 would map to input 433 in FIG. 4 of PD 400, causing input 433 to be untimed.<br>
An advantage of attributing in a timing parameter to untimed nets in the RTL is<br>
that any human error in syntax will be caught upon compilation of the RTL. Other<br>
advantages also stem from the general efficiencies of programming. For example, if a<br>
particular macro is needed multiple times, a simple macro iterative copy will carry any<br>
timing parameter attributes such that each copy will be untimed. Further, any macro<br>
having an untimed timing parameter associated therewith will maintain the untimed<br>
timing parameter independent of renaming of the macro or its instances.<br>
Not every untimed net specified in the RTL may have a timing parameter<br>
associated therewith, in accordance with one aspect of the invention. Because of<br>
synthesis, nets inside a given macro in the PD may not directly correspond to nets<br>
within a corresponding macro in the RTL. Therefore, in accordance with another<br>
aspect of the invention, untimed nets that exist outside a macro in the RTL may be<br>
attributed with a timing parameter. For example, as discussed above, timing<br>
parameters may be associated with untimed nets in the RTL, which carry over to the<br>
PD. However, there may be situations where further design is performed at the PD.<br>
All untimed specification may be done in the RTL. If a net within a macro has no<br>
corresponding net in the PD, then the attribute would not get carried over to PD, and<br>
the net would be timed in the normal manner, likely resulting in a setup time failure.<br>
Such a setup time failure provides feedback to the designer that the untimed net<br>
specification failed to work due to changes by synthesis. Such a failure can be rectified<br>
by moving the attribute to a different net for which there is a PD counterpart, or by<br>
14<br>
instructing synthesis to preserve the original net (e.g., apply a "no modification"<br>
attribute to the net).<br>
In general, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, timing parameters<br>
may be attributed to untimed nets in the RTL at the input and output of macros, at nets<br>
which are outside (e.g, run between) macros, and at nets inside macros, which have<br>
corresponding nets in the PD.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, timing parameters may be<br>
attributed to untimed nets in the RTL within macros. Specifically, nets within a given<br>
macro at the RTL may have timing parameters attributed thereto if such nets are<br>
directly connected to latches. Because of the verification process, where each latch in<br>
the RTL must be verified against its corresponding latch in the PD, all latches<br>
correspond through synthesis and do not change in design. Therefore, in accordance<br>
with this aspect of the invention, a timing attribute may also be placed on any untimed<br>
net directly connected to a latch in the RTL, such as net 327 in FIG.3 for example.<br>
Because timing parameters may be attributed in the RTL, in accordance with<br>
aspects of the invention, identification of untimed nets for driving onto them<br>
indeterminate values may be performed using a hierarchical RTL netlist, as opposed to<br>
the physical netlist of the PD referred to by a DCADJ file. Therefore, in accordance<br>
with the invention, there is no longer any need to match physical net names with those<br>
named in the RTL. This allows much more freedom for change and redesign without<br>
need for respecification of untimed nets. Also, there is no danger that some nets, which<br>
are untimed by STA, would fail to be verified due to lack of mapping at the RTL. An<br>
example of driving values to untimed nets is described in published US. patent<br>
application having publication number US 2008/0016480, the entire disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The above discussed embodiments and aspects of the invention discuss<br>
attributing timing parameters to untimed nets. In accordance with other embodiments<br>
and aspects of the invention, timing parameters may additionally be attributed to nets<br>
that are not untimed, but timed at a slower period than the driving clock cycle. In an<br>
example embodiment, using a DCADJ file, such a change may include an adjustment in<br>
the DCADJ file in addition to the change in the original design. By attributing a timing<br>
parameter to a net in the RTL, the net could be annotated as a “slow net” thus<br>
15<br>
signifying the STA should automatically adjust the net’s arrival time by a designated<br>
amount and the simulation of the RTL should drive the indeterminate value for the<br>
designated duration.<br>
Example aspects and embodiments in accordance with the invention as<br>
discussed above are drawn to a method of modeling an integrated circuit design. Other<br>
aspects and embodiments in accordance with the invention, may be similar in purpose<br>
and function, but drawn to somewhat different subject matter as discussed below.<br>
Additional example aspects and embodiments in accordance with the invention<br>
are drawn to a device operable to model an integrated circuit design. Non-limiting<br>
examples of such a device include a computer having a data input portion, a user<br>
interface and a data processing portion. For example, referring to FIG. 1, an<br>
embodiment of the invention may include a system wherein the data processing portion<br>
includes a register transfer level design portion, a synthesis portion and a physical<br>
design portion. The register transfer level design portion may be operable to create a<br>
register transfer level design of the integrated circuit. The physical design portion may<br>
be able to create a physical design of the integrated circuit. The synthesis portion may<br>
be able to convert the transfer level design into data for use by the physical design<br>
portion. Further, an example system in accordance with the invention may include a<br>
Boolean verification portion operable to perform a Boolean verification between the<br>
register transfer level design of the integrated circuit and the physical design of the<br>
integrated circuit. Still further, an example system in accordance with the invention<br>
may include a static timing analysis portion operable to perform static analysis on the<br>
register transfer level design of the integrated circuit.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the system includes a separate device<br>
for at least one of the register transfer level design portion, the synthesis portion and the<br>
physical design portion. In some embodiments of the invention, the system includes a<br>
single device for the register transfer level design portion, the synthesis portion and the<br>
physical design portion. Similarly, in some embodiments of the invention, the system<br>
includes a separate device for at least one of the register transfer level design portion,<br>
the synthesis portion, the physical design portion, the Boolean verification portion and<br>
the static timing analysis portion. In some embodiments of the invention, the system<br>
includes a single device for the register transfer level design portion, the synthesis<br>
16<br>
portion, the physical design portion, the Boolean verification portion and the static<br>
timing analysis portion.<br>
Additional example aspects and embodiments in accordance with the invention<br>
are drawn to a data processing system program product for executing instructions in a<br>
data processing system, wherein the data processing system program product includes a<br>
data processing system-readable storage medium having data processing systemreadable<br>
program code embodied in the medium, and wherein the data processing<br>
system-readable program code is operable to instruct the data processing system to<br>
perform a method of modeling an integrated circuit design. For example, referring to<br>
FIG. 1, an embodiment of the invention may include a data processing system having a<br>
media therein wherein the media has program code operable to instruct the data<br>
processing portion to create a register transfer level design of the integrated circuit and<br>
create a physical design of the integrated circuit. Further, an example system in<br>
accordance with the invention may include program code operable to instruct the data<br>
processing portion to perform a Boolean verification between the register transfer level<br>
design of the integrated circuit and the physical design of the integrated circuit. Still<br>
further, an example system in accordance with the invention may include program code<br>
operable to instruct the data processing portion to perform static analysis on the register<br>
transfer level design of the integrated circuit.<br>
There is also interest in verifying that attributed untimed nets do not actually<br>
toggle in certain modes of operation. With designation held in the RTL, it becomes<br>
easily possible to develop a checker program within the RTL to check that a signal does<br>
not transition in such a net.<br>
Further creating the closed-loop process is the before mentioned ability to<br>
correlate latch points. If an error caused by the STA over-applying phase renames due<br>
to a programming error, some paths might go untimed that should be timed. Because<br>
the latch points correlate, a latch for which a setup and hold test is not performed due to<br>
a phase rename as reported by the STA could be mapped back to the RTL latch name.<br>
This list of names could then be verified against the list of latch names that can receive<br>
indeterminate values resulting from untimed nets as can be determined from<br>
verification of the RTL. A discrepancy could indicate inconsistencies in interpretation<br>
17<br>
of untimed specifications between the STA and verification processes, thus, closing the<br>
loop between the two processes.<br>
