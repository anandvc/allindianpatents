				<td>RE-KEYABLE LOCK CYLINDER<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to lock cylinders and more particularly to<br>
lock cylinders that can be re-keyed without the use of a master key.<br>
When re-keying a cylinder using a traditional cylinder design, the user is required<br>
to remove the cylinder plug from the cylinder body and replace the appropriate<br>
pins so that a new key can be used to operate the lockset. This typically requires<br>
the user to remove the cylinder mechanism from the lockset and then<br>
disassemble the cylinder to some degree to remove the plug and replace the pins<br>
as necessary. This requires a working knowledge of the lockset and cylinder<br>
mechanism and is usually only performed by locksmiths or trained professionals.<br>
Additionally, the process usually employs special tools and requires the user to<br>
have access to pinning kits to interchange pins and replace components that can<br>
get lost or damaged in the re-keying process. Finally, professionals using<br>
appropriate tools can easily pick traditional cylinders.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In one form, the present teachings provide a lock with a lock cylinder body and a<br>
plug assembly. The lock cylinder body has a wall member that defines an interior<br>
cavity and a first groove that is generally parallel to a longitudinal axis of the<br>
interior cavity. The plug assembly is at least partially received in the lock cylinder<br>
body and includes a plug, a lock bar, a guide bar, a plurality of first pin members<br>
and a plurality of second pin members. The plug has a central cavity, a keyway<br>
that is generally aligned to a longitudinal axis of the centra) cavity, a lock bar slot<br>
that intersects the central cavity, and a guide bar slot that intersects the central<br>
cavity and which is located opposite the lock bar slot. The lock bar is movable<br>
along a first axis between a first position and a second position. At least a portion<br>
of the lock bar extends outwardly of the plug into the first groove when the lock<br>
bar is in the first position. The lock bar includes at least one lock element that<br>
travels from the lock bar slot into the central cavity when the lock bar is moved<br>
from the first position to the second position. The guide bar is received in the<br>
guide bar slot and is movable relative to the plug between a radially inward<br>
position and a radially outward position. The first pin members are disposed in<br>
the central cavity and bound an upper side of the keyway. The first pin members<br>
are individually movable in a first direction that is generally transverse to the first<br>
axis. The first pin members also coupled to the guide bar so as to be collectively<br>
movable with the guide bar when the guide bar is moved into the radially outward<br>
position. Each of the second pin members is received in the central cavity,<br>
includes a mating lock element and is coupled to a respective one of the first pin<br>
members when the guide bar is in the radially inward position. Each of the<br>
second pin members is uncoupled from the respective one of the second pin<br>
members when the guide bar is in the radially outward position. Insertion of a<br>
mating key into the keyway causes the first and second pin members to translate<br>
in a direction that is generally transverse to the first axis such that the mating lock<br>
elements are aligned to the at least one lock element on the lock bar so that the<br>
lock bar may translated to the second position to permit the plug assembly to be<br>
rotated relative to the lock cylinder body. The mating key may be removed from<br>
the plug assembly when the guide bar is positioned in the radially outward<br>
position.<br>
In another form, the teachings of the present invention provide a method for rekeying<br>
a lockset that includes: providing a lockset having a lock cylinder body and<br>
a plug assembly, the plug assembly including a plurality of first pin members and<br>
a plurality of second pin members, each of the first pin members being coupled to<br>
an associated one of the second pin members to inhibit relative translation<br>
therebetween along a first axis; positioning trie second pin members in a<br>
predetermined orientation; uncoupling the first pin members from the second pin<br>
members to permit relative translation therebetween along the first axis; inserting<br>
a key with a desired key profile to the plug assembly, the desired key profile<br>
being operable for repositioning at least one of the first pin members relative to a<br>
respective one the second pin members along the first axis; and re-coupling each<br>
of the first pin members to the associated one of the second pin members to<br>
thereby inhibit relative translation therebetween along the first axis.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS<br>
With reference to Figure 1 of the drawings, a lock cylinder constructed i n<br>
accordance with the teachings of the present invention is generally indicated by<br>
reference numeral 10. The lock cylinder 10 is disposed about a longitudinal axis<br>
12 and may include a lock cylinder body 14, a plug assembly 16 and a "matched"<br>
key 18. With additional reference to Figures 2 and 3, the lock cylinder body <br>
may include a generally cylindrical body portion 30 with a wall member 32 that<br>
defines an interior cavity 34. First and second grooves 36 and 38, respectively,<br>
are formed in the interior surface 40 of the wall member 32. Arcuate earn<br>
surfaces 44 may be formed on one or both of the opposite sides of the first and/or<br>
second grooves 36, 38. The cylindrical body portion 30 may include a bridge<br>
member 48 that may intersect the second groove 38. In the particular example<br>
provided, the bridge member 48 has a radially inward surface that extends further<br>
into the interior cavity 34 than the deepest part of the second groove 38.<br>
Returning to Figure 1, the plug assembly 16 may include a plug 50, a plurality of<br>
bottom pins 52, a guide bar 54, a first guide bar spring 56, a second guide bar<br>
spring 58, a cover 60, a plurality of racks 62, a plurality of pin springs 64, a spring<br>
cap 68, a locking bar 70, a lock bar spring 72, one or more drill-resistant<br>
elements, such as ball bearings 74, and a retainer 76.<br>
With additional reference to Figures 4, 5 and 7, the plug 50 may include a plug<br>
body 90 and a plug face 92. The plug body 90 may be sized to be received<br>
through the interior cavity 34 of the lock cylinder body 14 and may include a<br>
central cavity 94 that may include one or more first rack slots 96 for receiving a<br>
portion of the racks 62. The first rack slots 96 may extend generally transverse to<br>
a longitudinal axis 98 of the plug body 90. A lock bar slot 100 may extend<br>
-5-<br>
longitudinally along the plug body 90 and may intersect the first rack slots 96. A<br>
guide bar slot 102 may extend longitudinally along the plug body 90 and may<br>
intersect the central cavity 94. The lock bar slot 100 and the guide bar slot 102<br>
may be generally diametrically opposed from one another. Retainer slots 106<br>
may be formed in the plug body 90 for receiving the retainer 76. In the particular<br>
example provided, the retainer 76 is a conventional C-shaped spring clip that is<br>
received into the retainer slots 106 and which engages the portion of the plug<br>
body 90 that extends through the lock cylinder body 14 to thereby inhibit<br>
withdrawal of the plug body 90 from the lock cylinder body 14. Those skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate from this disclosure that the plug 50 and the lock cylinder<br>
body 14 may be rotatably coupled to one another in any appropriate manner.<br>
A keyway 110 extends through the plug face 92 and into the central cavity 94.<br>
The plug face 92 may include a re-keying tool opening 112, which may be offset<br>
somewhat from the guide bar slot 102. Cavities 114 may be formed in the plug<br>
face 92 and/or the plug body 90 for receiving the drill resistant elements. In the<br>
particular example provided, the cavities 114 are formed in both the plug face 92<br>
and the plug body 90 and are positioned such that the drill resistant ball bearings<br>
74 are located axially in-line with the lock bar slot 100 and the guide bar slot 102.<br>
With reference to Figures 1, 6 and 7, each bottom pin 52 may include a keyengaging<br>
portion 120, a first securing portion 122 and a coupling portion 124.<br>
The key-engaging portion 120 may include an upper surface 130 and a contact<br>
member 132. The contact member 132 provides the lockset 10 with improved<br>
resistance to the wear that is normally encountered through the insertion of the<br>
key to and withdrawal of the key from the keyway 110. The contact member 132<br>
may be unitarily formed with the remainder of the bottom pin 52, or may comprise<br>
one or more discrete elements that are associated with the remainder of the<br>
bottom pin 52. In the particular example provided, the contact member 132 is a<br>
conventional hardened ball bearing and is disposed in a slotted aperture 134 that<br>
is formed in the remainder of the bottom pin 52.<br>
The first securing portion 122 is configured to slide against and engage an<br>
associated one of the racks 62. In the particular example provided, we employed<br>
one or more teeth 140 which are coupled to and extend from the key-engaging<br>
portion 120. The teeth 140 are illustrated as being generally V-shaped and<br>
aligned along an axis that is generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
bottom pin 52, but those skilled in the art will appreciate from this disclosure that<br>
the tooth or teeth 140 may be formed and/or oriented differently from that which<br>
is shown and described.<br>
The coupling portion 124 may be coupled to the key-engaging portion 120 on a<br>
side opposite the first securing portion 122 and is configured to couple the bottom<br>
pin 52 to the guide bar 54. In the particular example provided, the coupling<br>
portion 124 is generally L-shaped, having an arm 146, which may be generally<br>
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bottom pin 52, and a leg 148 that may be<br>
generally perpendicular to the arm 146. The leg 148 is spaced apart from the<br>
key-engaging portion 120 so as to form a guide receiving aperture 150.<br>
With reference to Figures 1, 7 and 8, the guide bar 54 may be a longitudinally<br>
extending member that may be disposed between the cover 60 and the plug<br>
body 90 and may be slidable relative to the plug body 90 in a first direction, which<br>
is generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the plug body 90, and a second<br>
direction, which is generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the plug<br>
body 90. The guide bar 54 may include one or more coupling apertures 160, a<br>
setting cam 162, and a setting tab 164. Each coupling aperture 160 may be<br>
formed through the guide bar 54 so as to form a wall member 168 that is sized to<br>
engage the coupling portion 124 of an associated one or ones of the bottom pins<br>
52. In the particular example provided, the guide bar 54 includes five coupling<br>
apertures 160, one for each of the bottom pins 52. More specifically, in the<br>
particular example provided the guide bar 54 is received into the guide receiving<br>
aperture 150 in the coupling portion 124 of each bottom pin 52 such that the leg<br>
148 is disposed in an associated one of the coupling apertures 160 to thereby<br>
"lock" the guide bar 54 to the bottom pins 52 in a lateral direction. The coupling<br>
apertures 160 may be sized relatively wider than the bottom pins 52 so as to<br>
permit translation of the guide bar 54 relative to the bottom pins 52 in a direction<br>
generally parallel to the longitudinal axis 98 of the plug body 90. Those skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate from this disclosure, however, that one or more of the<br>
coupling apertures 160 may be sized in the alternative to receive a plurality of the<br>
bottom pins 52.<br>
The setting cam 162 may extend from a lateral side of the guide bar 54 opposite<br>
the coupling apertures 160 and may be configured to cooperate with one or more<br>
other elements, such as the lock cylinder body 14, to permit the setting cam 162<br>
to engage and/or disengage the bottom pins 52 to the racks 62. In the particular<br>
example provided, alignment of the setting cam 162 to the radially inward surface<br>
of the bridge member 48 (Fig. 3) maintains engagement between the bottom pins<br>
52 and the racks 62, whereas alignment of the setting cam 162 to the second<br>
groove 38 (Fig. 3) permits the guide bar 54 to be shifted radially outwardly so that<br>
the bottom pins 52 disengage the racks 62.<br>
The setting tab 164 provides a location on the guide bar 54 at which a user may<br>
apply a force to shift the guide bar 54 relative to the lock cylinder body 14. The<br>
setting tab 164 may be offset somewhat from the setting cam 162 so that the<br>
setting cam 162 may be positioned behind a drill resistant ball bearing 74. In the<br>
particular example provided, the setting tab 164 is generally L-shaped and<br>
extends above the setting cam 162 so as to be aligned with the re-keying tool<br>
opening 112.<br>
With reference to Figures 1, 5, 7 and 17, the first guide bar spring 56 biases the<br>
guide bar 54 toward the plug face 92 in the first direction (i.e., in a direction<br>
generally parallel to the longitudinal axis 98 of the plug body 90), while the<br>
second guide bar spring 58 biases the guide bar 54 in the second direction (i.e.,<br>
in a direction outwardly from the plug body 90 away from the racks 62). In the<br>
example provided, the first guide bar spring 56 is a compression spring that is<br>
disposed in a spring aperture 190 that is formed in the plug body 90, while the<br>
second guide bar spring 58 includes a pair of leaf springs 58a, each of which<br>
being disposed in a spring slot 194 that is formed in the plug body 90 and which<br>
intersects the guide bar slot 102.<br>
With reference to Figures 1, 7, 9 and 10, the cover 60 may include a plurality of<br>
pin slots 200, a plurality of second rack slots 202, and a plurality of guide tabs<br>
204. The cover 60 may also include a longitudinally extending aperture 206 that<br>
may form a portion of the keyway 110. The pin slots 200 may have a first portion<br>
210, which may be generally transverse to the longitudinal axis and vertically inline<br>
with the keyway 110, and a second portion 212. In the particular example<br>
provided, the second portion 212 of each the pin slot 200 is generally normal to<br>
an associated first portion 210 of the pin slot 200 and extends sufficiently through<br>
the cover 60 as to intersect an associated one of the second rack slots 202. The<br>
first portion 210 of each pin slot 200 is sized to receive therein an associated one<br>
of the pin springs 64, while the second portion 212 is sized to receive an<br>
associated one of the bottom pins 52. The pin springs 64 are configured to bias<br>
the bottom pins 52 downwardly in the pin slots 200. In the particular example<br>
provided, each pin spring 64 is a compression spring that is disposed between<br>
the spring cap 68 and the upper surface 130 of the key-engaging portion 120 of<br>
the bottom pin 52. Each of the second rack slots 202 may be generally parallel to<br>
the first portion 210 of an associated one of pin slots 200. The first and second<br>
rack slots 96 and 202 cooperate to define a cavity into which an associated one<br>
of the racks 62 may be received.<br>
The guide tabs 204 may extend from the opposite ends of the cover 60 and may<br>
be employed to secure the cover 60 to the plug body 90. In the particular<br>
example provided, each guide tabs 204 includes a longitudinally extending tab<br>
member 220 that may be received into an associated tab member cavity 222<br>
(Fig. 5) in the plug body 90. An aperture may be formed through each tab<br>
member 226 to receive therethrough a rivet, pin or threaded fastener to secure<br>
the tab member 220 to the plug body 90. In the particular embodiment illustrated,<br>
the rearward guide tab 204 also includes a cross-tab 228, which may be<br>
disposed generally perpendicular to the tab member 220 and which may be sized<br>
to engage an associated cross-tab cavity 230 (Fig. 5) formed in the plug body<br>
90.<br>
With reference to Figures 1, 7 and 11, each rack 62 may be an elongated<br>
member that is slidingly disposed in an associated pair of the first and second<br>
rack slots 96 and 202 (Fig. 9). Each rack may have a second securing portion<br>
240 and a mating lock element 242. The second securing portion 240 is<br>
configured to cooperate with the first securing portion 122 of an associated one of<br>
the bottom pins 52 so that when the first and second securing portions 122 and<br>
240 are engaged to one another, the key-engaging portion 120 of the bottom pin<br>
52 may be maintained at a desired position relative to the rack 62. In the<br>
particular example provided, the rack 62 includes a plurality of rack teeth 248 that<br>
are spaced apart along a portion of the length of the rack 62 and that have a<br>
tooth geometry that is compatible with the tooth geometry of the teeth 140 of the<br>
first securing portion 122 on the bottom pins 52. The upper end 250 of the rack<br>
62 may be contoured so as not to contact the interior surface 40 of the lock<br>
cylinder body 14 during the operation of the lock cylinder 10.<br>
The mating lock element 242 is formed in a surface 254 of the rack 62 that abuts<br>
the locking bar 70. In the particular example provided, the mating lock element<br>
242 is an aperture in the abutting surface 254 having the shape a cylindrical<br>
segment that passes through the rack 62 in a direction that is generally<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the rack 62.<br>
The spring cap 68, which is optional, provides a wear-resistant barrier between<br>
the pin springs 64 and the wall member 32 of the lock cylinder body 14.<br>
Accordingly, the spring cap 68 may comprise one or more elements that are<br>
interposed between the pin springs 64 and the wall member 32 and retain the pin<br>
springs 64 within the first portion 210 of the pin slots 200 that are formed in the<br>
cover 60. The spring cap 68 may be coupled to the cover 60 via fasteners, such<br>
as rivets or threaded fasteners, or utilize a geometrical shape (e.g., a pair of<br>
longitudinally extending grooves into which the opposite lateral edges of the<br>
spring cap 68 are received) that permits the spring cap 68 to be received into and<br>
locked to the cover 60. In the particular example provided, the spring cap 68 is<br>
unitarily formed and is sized to cover the first portion 210 of each pin slots 200 in<br>
the cover 60. Additionally, rivets, pins and/or threaded fasteners (not shown)<br>
may be employed to couple the opposite ends of the spring cap 68 to the cover<br>
60 and the plug body 90 (i.e., the rivets, pins and/or threaded fasteners may be<br>
employed to secure both the spring cap 68 and the cover 60 to the plug body 90).<br>
With reference to Figures 1, 7 and 12, the locking bar 70 is an elongate member<br>
that is sized to be at least partially received into the lock bar slot 100. The<br>
locking bar 70 may include a cam follower 300 and one or more lock elements<br>
302. In the particular example provided, the cam follower 300 extends the length<br>
of the locking bar 70 and is arcuate in shape. Also in the particular example<br>
provided, the lock element 302 is sized to be slidably received into the mating<br>
lock elements 242 that are formed in the racks 62 and may be somewhat shorter<br>
than the locking bar 70 so that the cam follower 300 forms a pair of ears 306, with<br>
each ear 306 being located adjacent an opposite end of the lock element 302.<br>
The lock bar spring 72 may be disposed between the locking bar 70 and the plug<br>
body 90 to bias the locking bar 70 outwardly from the racks 62 toward the interior<br>
surface 40 of the wall member 32 of the lock cylinder body 14. In the example<br>
provided, the lock bar spring 72 comprises a pair of compression springs, each of<br>
which being disposed in a recess 310 that is formed on an inside surface 312 of<br>
an associated one of the ears 306.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 7, the pin springs 64 bias the bottom pins 52<br>
downwardly in the keyway 110, while the lock bar spring 72 biases the locking<br>
bar 70 radially outwardly from the plug body 90 into the first groove 36 in the wall<br>
member 32 of the lock cylinder body 14.<br>
With additional reference to Figures 13 and 14, the key 18 that is associated with<br>
the lock cylinder 10 has a lateral cross-sectional shape that matches or is<br>
compatible with that of the keyway 110 and a key profile 18a. Insertion of the key<br>
18 into the keyway 110 brings the key profile 18a into contact with the contact<br>
member 132 of each bottom pin 52, causing the bottom pins 52 and the racks 62<br>
(since each of the bottom pins 52 is engaged to an associated one of the racks<br>
62) to move "upwardly" in the example provided.<br>
If the key 18 is "matched" to the current keying of the lock cylinder 10, each of the<br>
racks 62 will be moved relative to the plug body 90 such that the mating lock<br>
elements 242 are aligned to the lock element(s) 302 on the locking bar 70.<br>
Rotation of the key 18, which causes rotation of the plug assembly 16 relative to<br>
the lock cylinder body 14, causes the cam follower 300 of the locking bar 70 to<br>
ride against the cam surface 44 on the first groove 36 so that the locking bar 70 is<br>
pushed radially inwardly toward the plug body 90. Since the key 18 is matched to<br>
the lock cylinder 10, the lock element 302 will at least partially engage the mating<br>
lock element 242 so that the cam follower 300 may move inwardly by a sufficient<br>
amount so as to permit the plug body 90 to rotate in an unimpeded manner within<br>
the interior cavity 34 of the lock cylinder body 14. If the key 18 were not matched<br>
to the lock cylinder 10, the lock element 302 would move inwardly in response to<br>
rotation of the plug assembly 16 relative to the lock cylinder body 14 and would<br>
contact the abutting surface 254 of at least one of the racks 62. Such contact<br>
would effectively inhibit inward movement of the cam follower 300 so that the<br>
locking bar 70 would remain in the first groove 36 and thereby inhibit further<br>
rotation of the plug assembly 16 relative to the lock cylinder body 14.<br>
One method for re-keying the lock cylinder 10 will be described in conjunction<br>
with Figures 15 through 18. To re-key the lock cylinder 10, a key 18 that is<br>
matched to the lock cylinder 10 may be inserted into the keyway 110 and the plug<br>
assembly 16 rotated relative to the lock cylinder body 14 through a<br>
predetermined angle, such as 45°, to align the guide bar 54 to the second groove<br>
38 in the lock cylinder body 14. Contact between the setting cam 162 and the<br>
radially inward surface of the bridge member 48 maintains the guide bar 54 in a<br>
position wherein the bottom pins 52 are engaged to their respective racks 62. A<br>
re-keying tool 400 is inserted into the re-keying tool opening 112 and is employed<br>
to exert a force onto the setting tab 164 (Fig. 8) that pushes the guide bar 54 in<br>
the guide bar slot 102 (Fig. 5) away from the re-keying tool opening 112 so that<br>
the setting cam 162 rides across the bridge member 48. When the bridge<br>
member 48 is aligned to the second groove 38 (i.e., has ridden over the bridge<br>
member 48 as shown in Fig. 17), the second guide bar spring 58 urges the guide<br>
bar 54 in an outward direction. As the bottom pins 52 are coupled to the guide<br>
bar 54 for movement in a direction generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis<br>
12 of the lock cylinder 10, movement of the guide bar 54 in an outward direction<br>
causes the first securing portion 122 of the bottom pins 52 to disengage the<br>
second securing portion 240 of the racks 62.<br>
At this point, the key 18 may be removed as shown in Figure 19 and another,<br>
differently configured key 18' may be inserted into the keyway 110, as shown in<br>
Figure 20, which causes the bottom pins 52 to move "upwardly" in the keyway<br>
110 in an amount that corresponds to the configuration of the key 18'. Force on<br>
the re-keying tool 400 (Fig. 16) may be reduced or eliminated to permit the first<br>
guide bar spring 56 (Fig. 17) to push the guide bar 54 in the guide bar slot 102<br>
(Fig. 21) toward the re-keying tool opening 112 (Fig. 16). As the guide bar 54<br>
moves toward the re-keying tool opening 112 (Fig. 16), the setting cam 162 rides<br>
up onto the bridge member 48, which forces the guide bar 54 inwardly. Since the<br>
bottom pins 52 are coupled to the guide bar 54 for movement in a direction<br>
generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 12 of the lock cylinder 10,<br>
movement of the guide bar 54 in an inward direction causes the first securing<br>
portion 122 of the bottom pins 52 to engage the second securing portion 240 of<br>
the racks 62 as shown in Figure 22. The engagement of the bottom pins 52 to<br>
the racks 62 while the locking bar 70 is engaged to the racks 62 "matches" the<br>
new key 18' to the lock cylinder 10.<br>
With reference to Figure 23, a method for re-keying a lock in accordance with the<br>
teachings of the present invention is illustrated schematically in flow chart form.<br>
The methodology includes the steps of: inserting a "matched" key 18 to the plug<br>
assembly 16; rotating the plug assembly 16 relative to the lock cylinder body 14<br>
through a predetermined angle of rotation; disconnecting the bottom pins 52 from<br>
the racks 62; removing the key 18 from the plug assembly 16; inserting a new<br>
key 18' to the plug assembly 16; re-coupling the bottom pins 52 to the racks 62;<br>
and removing the new key 18'.<br>
