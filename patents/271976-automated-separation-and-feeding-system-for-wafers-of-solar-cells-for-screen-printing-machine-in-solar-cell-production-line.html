				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a Solar Cell Separation and Feeder Device<br>
adaptable in the manufacturing systems of solar cells, made from thin<br>
silicon wafers of around 200 micron thickness and 125mm x 125mm<br>
square size.<br>
The invention particularly applies to the specific method for automatically<br>
separating the wafers from stacks and feeding to a screen-printing<br>
machine replacing the manual separation and feeding followed so far.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Solar cells are manufactured using 125mm x 125mm or 156mm x<br>
156mm size mono / multi crystalline silicon wafers. Typically, each 125-<br>
mm solar cell generates a power output of 2.2 to 2.3 watts. Presently 36<br>
number of these cells are interconnected in series to get PV Modules of 75<br>
to 85-watts power output (12-V application) and 72 numbers of cells are<br>
interconnected in series to get PV Modules of 150 to 170-watts power<br>
output (24-V application).<br>
 <br>
In Solar Cell Production the 'wafers' go through a series of processes like<br>
pre-cleaning, texturisation, chemical cleaning, diffusion, junction removal,<br>
etching, anti reflection coating, printing, drying, firing and testing.<br>
Metalisation on solar cells is carried out by means of screen printing metal<br>
pastes on them. Screen printing is carried out in three stages i.e. i) silver-<br>
aluminium busbar on back surface ii) Aluminium paste in rest of the area<br>
super-imposing the busbars on the back surface and iii) Fine-line grid<br>
pattern on the front surface. It is required to manually separate the wafers<br>
from coin-stack and feed to the screen printing machine by a dedicated<br>
operator.<br>
The process of manual separation is found difficult since the wafers have<br>
an inherent property of sticking to each other when stacked together due<br>
to its high smoothness and flatness of surface. This was causing strain to<br>
the operator and also result in breakage of wafers as the wafers are thin<br>
(200 microns thick) and delicate.<br>
The present invention overcomes the above-mentioned drawback of the<br>
prior art.<br>
 <br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an automated Solar Cell Wafer<br>
Separation and Feeding device adaptable to the printing machine used in<br>
the manufacturing systems of Solar Cells of 125mmx125mm, from coin-<br>
stacks.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a method for automatic<br>
separation of wafers in place of manual separation to increase the<br>
production throughput.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a method of automatic<br>
feeding to eliminate the strain involved and avoid breakage in the manual<br>
handling.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a method for automatic<br>
picking of wafers and placing them on positioning table.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a method for automatic<br>
centering of the wafers using pre-aligning system.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, an automatic solar wafer separation and feeding system has<br>
been designed and developed and interfaced to the printing machine in the<br>
manufacturing line of solar cells. The system incorporates a PLC<br>
(programmable logic controller) based electronic control for the logics<br>
needed for the various movements to ensure error free functioning. A<br>
vacuum system is employed to pick up the cell from the separation point<br>
place to the feeder point. A set of thin air jets is used to separate the<br>
wafers from sticking to each other. A pre-aligning system equipped with<br>
pneumatic cylinders position the cells so that the cells are fed to the<br>
printing machine precisely in orientation to the print screen. Two numbers<br>
of magazines are used to facilitate bulk loading of wafers up to 1400<br>
numbers of wafers at a time. Also two numbers of servomotors are<br>
employed to position the wafers in the magazine to enable the vacuum<br>
cups pick up the wafers at a fixed height consistently.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a device and a method for<br>
solar cell wafer separation and feeding to the screen printing machine<br>
used for screen printing the silver-aluminum busbars at the rear side of<br>
the solar wafer (125mmx125mm size) which is the first stage in printing<br>
the cells.<br>
The device is incorporated with a PLC-based electronic system for<br>
sequencing the various movements of the pick and place device (403) and<br>
servo system (406).<br>
Also the PLC provides the necessary interlocks during the steps of<br>
separating and feeding of the wafers in the device. The PLC controller is<br>
interfaced to the operator push-button control mounted on the side of the<br>
equipment for easy operator access.<br>
As shown in figure 1, the sequential steps of Solar Cell Production process<br>
comprises various steps like pre-cleaning, texturisation, chemical<br>
cleaning, diffusion, junction removal, etching, anti reflection coating,<br>
printing, drying, firing and testing.<br>
 <br>
In Fig. 4 the invented automatic feeder device and its principle parts are<br>
diagrammatically shown. The parts comprises of a Magazine Loading<br>
Device (401) for loading bulk of wafers, an Air Separation Device (402) for<br>
separating each wafer from stack, a Pick and Place Device (403) for picking<br>
one cell from the stack and transfer to the positioning table (33) and a<br>
positioning device (404) for orienting the wafer in line with the printing<br>
screen.<br>
Details of various features of the new machine are described below.<br>
MAGAZINE LOADING STATION<br>
Magazine loading station comprises of two magazines (401) side by side<br>
for bulk loading of wafers to the extent of about 700 numbers of wafers<br>
in each basket. The magazines are to be removed for loading the wafers<br>
and to be inserted back and secured with locking pins. Initially when the<br>
machine is started, emptiness or fullness of the magazines (401) are<br>
sensed by a sensor and accordingly the moving platform (405) operated by<br>
two servomotors (406) which are independently fitted for each magazine<br>
(401) and connected with ball-screw and ball-nut arrangement (407).<br>
Apart from facilitating loading of wafers, the mechanism of servomotor<br>
(406) and screw (407) also constantly interacts with the sensor and keep<br>
the top level of the top layer of the loaded wafers.<br>
 <br>
When the wafers get exhausted in any one magazine (401) the machine<br>
stops and the moving platform (405) of that magazine descends to enable<br>
the magazine (401) to be removed for filling the wafers.<br>
AIR SEPARATION DEVICE<br>
Air separation device (402) plays a very vital role in the whole operation.<br>
This device consist of four numbers of air nozzles fitted at the side of each<br>
magazine (401) which continuously blows pressurized air in thin jet so as<br>
to detach the wafers on the top of the magazine in a pre-determined<br>
height. Virtually the top few wafers keep floating in air when<br>
the air jet is continuously administered. This method allows the vacuum<br>
cups (408) to pick up only one wafer from each magazine at a time.<br>
PICK AND PLACE STATION<br>
The purpose of the pick and place device (403) shows the various elements<br>
of the pick and place unit which functions to pick the top wafer from the<br>
two magazines (401) and move them to the positioning table (33). The pick<br>
and place device (403) consists of mainly a linear cylinder (409) for<br>
longitudinal movement of the vacuum cups (408) between the magazine<br>
point (401) and the positioning table (33). To the linear cylinder (409) is<br>
fitted arm (410) as to reach the centre of the positioning table (33). The<br>
vacuum cups (408) which are fitted to the short air cylinder helps to pick<br>
 <br>
the wafers from the magazines (401) and place them on the positioning<br>
table (33). The linear slide (411) fitted with linear bearings smoothly slides<br>
the sliding arm (410) over the ground guide rods (413) smoothly without<br>
noise and friction.<br>
POSITIONING STATION<br>
The positioning station (404) consists of a base frame (31) over which a<br>
universal table (32) is mounted. This table has been built for adjustments<br>
in different axes like x, y and θ. The universal table (32) is kept next to the<br>
pick and place device (403) and used as the picking point for the collection<br>
arm of the printing machine. At the positioning table (33) the two wafers<br>
coming from magazines (401) are pre-positioned such that it matches to<br>
the print screen of the printing machine. The universal table (33) has to be<br>
adjusted and locked to match the printing screen whenever a new screen<br>
is fitted in the printer.<br>
The thin fingers fitted to the table (33) which are operated by the<br>
pneumatic cylinders are used to orient the wafers as the cylinders open<br>
and close in the logical sequencing. The top surface of the table (33) is<br>
coated with Teflon to avoid aberration between the wafers and metal.<br>
 <br>
