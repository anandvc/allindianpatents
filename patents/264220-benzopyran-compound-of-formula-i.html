				<td>DESCRIPTION BENZOPYRAN COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to benzopyran compounds having the prolongation effect on the refractory period, which are used for the treatment of arrhythmia in mammals including human being.<br>
Background Art<br>
As benzopyran derivatives, 4-acylaminobenzopyran derivatives exemplified by Cromakalim have been known (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho 58-67683). These 4-acylaminobenzopyran derivatives exemplified by Cromakalim are known to open ATP sensitive K+ channel so as to be effective for the treatment of hypertension and asthma, but there has not been any mention as to the treatment of arrhythmia based on the prolongation effect on the refractory period.<br>
At present, conventional anti-arrhythmic agents having the prolongation effect on the refractory period as a main mechanism (such as Class I drugs of anti-arrhythmic agent classification according to Vaughan Williams, or d-sotalol or dofetilide belonging to Class III) have the therapeutic problems in inducing highly dangerous arrhythmia leading to the sudden death from such as torsades de pointes among others due to prolongation of action potential in ventricular muscle correlated to the prolongation effect on the refractory period.   Thus, treating agents with less adverse effect have been highly desired.<br>
Disclosure of invention<br>
The inventors have eagerly investigated benzopyran compounds, and surprisingly found that the compound of formula (I) has the prolongation effect on the refractory period selective for atrium muscle without any influence on the refractory period and action potential in ventricular muscle.   Thus, the present invention has been accomplished.<br>

Syntheses of optically active compounds among the compounds of formula<br>
(I) can be attained by utilizing optical resolution methods (Japanese Patent Laid-<br>
open No. Hei 3-141286, U.S. Patent No. 5097037 and European Patent No. 409165).<br>
Furthermore, syntheses of optically active compounds of formula (2) can be attained by utilizing asymmetric synthetic methods (PCT Japanese Translation Patent Publication No. Hei 5-507645, Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos.

As described above, the inventors of the present invention found that the compound of formula (I) has a strong prolongation effect on the refractory period. The prolongation effect on the refractory period is one of mechanisms of anti-arrhythmic action and is an important indicator that can be taken in judging the effectiveness in clinical arrhythmia.   Conventional anti-arrhythmic agents having the prolongation effect on the refractory period as the main mechanism (such as d-sotalol belonging to Class III of the antiarrhythmic agent classification according to Vaughan Williams) have been the therapeutic problems In inducing highly dangerous arrhythmia leading to the sudden death from such as torsades de pointes among others due to prolongation of action potential in ventricular muscle correlated to the<br>
prolongation effect on the refractory period, and thus becoming the therapeutic problem in arrhythmia mainly of atrial muscle (such as supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation and the like).<br>
In order to solve the problems, the inventors of the present invention carried out the investigation of compounds having the prolongation effect on the refractory period selective for atrium muscle than for ventricular muscle, and found that the compound of formula (I) has a prolongation effect on the refractory period selective for atrium muscle without any influence on the refractory period and action potential in ventricular muscle.   The difference between the findings by the inventors and the prior art is in providing the prolongation effect on the refractory period selective for atrium muscle to these compound group, which may be shown by the facts that there is no influence on the action potential duration period of isolated ventricular muscle and there is no influence on QT in the electrocardiogram of anesthetized animal. From above, the compounds of the present invention sho1-6no inducing action of arrhythmia in ventricular muscle, thus they can contribute to much safer use in arrhythmia mainly of atrial muscle in comparison with the prior art.   The present technical knowledge is beneficial for therapeutic or preventive uses as anti-atrial fibrillation agents, anti-atrial flutter agents and anti-atrial tachycardia agents relating to paroxysmal, chronic, preoperative, intraoperative or postoperative atrial arrhythmia, prevention in the progression leading to embolus due to arrhythmia of artial nature, prevention in the progression leading to ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia from atrial arrhythmia or tachycardia, and averting the life threatening prognosis due to preventive action on atrial arrhythmia or tachycardia leading to ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia.<br>

 [Pharmacological Test Example] Effects on the effective refractory period Method<br>
Beagles were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and thoracotomy was done along the median line under a respirator and the incision was made on the pericardium to expose the heart.   An electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded using bipolar electrodes attached to the surface of the right atrial free wall, right atrial auricle, and right ventricular free wall.   The vagal nerves were stimulated using an electrostimulation device with Nichrome wires inserted into the vagal nerves in the neck bilaterally.   The conditions for electrostimulation to the vagal nerves were set such that the RR intervals on ECG were prolonged by about 100msec compared with those before the stimulation was started.<br>
Atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods were determined by S1-S2<br>
extrastimulus technique at basic cycle length of 300 msec during bilateral vagal nerve stimulation, using programmable electric stimulator.   A train of 10 basic stimuli(SI) was followed by a premature extrastimulus(S2) at 2 times diastolic threshold. The S1-S2 interval was successively decreased by 2 msec, and the effective refractory period was defined as the point at which S2 failed to produced a propagated response.<br>
For evaluation of drug effects, the atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods were determined before drug administration, then respective compound was administrated intravenously at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg, and the atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods were determined from 5 min after the administration.<br>
The results were shown as the prolongation time on the atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods, i.e. [effective refractory period after drug administration] -[effective refractory period before drug administration] (msec).<br>
Results<br>
The compounds of the present invention exhibited the prolongation effect on the effective refractory period selective for atrium as shown in Table 60.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The compounds according to the present invention exhibit the prolongation effect on the effective refractory period selective for atrium, thus can be used as an anti-atrial fibrillation agents and an supraventricular antiarrhythmic agent, and are useful as Pharmaceuticals.   Further, since the compounds according to the present invention have small influence on ventricle, they can contribute to safe treatments of aforementioned arrhythmic conditions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
