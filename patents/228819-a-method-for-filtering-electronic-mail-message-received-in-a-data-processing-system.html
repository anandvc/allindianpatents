SYSTEM, METHOD, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR FILTERING ELECTRONIC MAIL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed,  in general,  to electronic mail management.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Unsolicited commercial email (UCE), commonly known as "spam," has become an increasingly great problem for virtually all users of electronic mail. "Spammers" send millions of emails every day to vast lists of email addresses, and users then receive dozens or even hundreds of daily "spam" emails, many containing offensive content. Because email is extremely inexpensive to send, even the smallest customer response can make the practice worthwhile to the spammer.<br>
Most computer users are forced to read each email in turn before they can determine whether or not it is spam and can be deleted. Other users take advantage of spam-filtering systems that attempt to identify and eliminate spam using ' a rules-based lexical analysis. These systems have proven unsuccessful at completely eliminating spam.<br>
There is, therefore, a need in the art for an improved system, process and computer program product for filtering electronic mail.<br><br>

One embodiment of the present invention uses an intro-word in the subject line of a received email as a keyword to verify that the sender is a valid sender and that all email from that sender should be delivered. Further, user-specified authorized addresses and domains are used to validate other email for delivery.<br>
In addition, one embodiment provides a means for automatically responding to suspect email to allow a sender to verify that the email comes from a valid user who can communicate with the recipient.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the filtering is performed by the email recipient's mail server.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a flowchart of a process in accordance with a preferred embodiment.<br>
First, an email is received by the recipient's mail server (step 205) . The mail server then performs a series of checks on the email.<br>
If the subject line includes that receiver's intro-word (step 210), then the sender's email address is added to the "white list" (step 250), which is a list of all valid senders, that message is accepted into the recipient's inbox (step 255) , and any messages currently stored in the unconfirmed mailbox from that sender are delivered to the recipient's inbox (step 260).<br>
If the message comes from anyone listed on the whitelist as an authorized sender (step 215) , then that message is accepted into the recipient's inbox (step 255).<br><br>

Dear  Sir/Madam,<br>
***This is an automated response***<br>
In order to eliminate Spam I reject all messages from people who have not sent me e-mail before and that do not have my intro-word (see below) in the subject. I have just received a message from your e-mail address with the subject above. Your message has not been deleted but to confirm that your e-mail is not Spam either reply to this e-mail with my intro-word in the subject line or click on the link below.<br>
http: //<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1661616138736e777b667a733875797b295064797b2b7774755672737038717e7f">[email&#160;protected]</a>?To=xyz8tko.mno<br>
Sincerely. ..<br>
Note: My intro-word is the second word in the next sentence. The<br>
convoluted way of describing my intro-word is to prevent Spam<br>
computers from harvesting it and subjecting me to unwanted Spam.<br>
If you would also like 100% guaranteed Spam protection click on:<br>
http: //www. example. com/.<br><br>
If that message comes from an authorized domain (e.g., any address at example.com) (step 220), then the message is accepted into the  inbox   (step 255) .<br>
If none of the previous conditions have been met, the message  is  placed in  the  unconfirmed mailbox   (step  225) .<br>
For unconfirmed messages, an e-mail is sent back to the sender asking them to click on a link in order to confirm that the message was sent from a real person and not a spam computer (step 230) . Following is an exemplary confirmation email:<br>
At this point, the sender can simply reply to the email,    including   the   intro-word   in   the   subject.       When   the<br><br>
^     ,v'0 vOf)'-;/0:S'«3-i	f'CT/i/S/M* i/0.:&gt;S()7 I<br>

Jf<br>
response email including the intro-word is received (step 240), then the sender's email address is added to the 'white list" (step 250), which is a list of all valid senders, that message is accepted into the recipient's inbox (step 255), and any messages currently stored in the unconfirmed mailbox from that sender are delivered to the recipient's inbox (step 260) .<br>
In a preferred embodiment, users of this system will be required to set a timeout period so that if a response is not received within a certain timeout period then the message will be deleted.<br>
If the sender chooses to activate the Internet web link from the confirmation email, the server system will receive the request, and transmit to the sender a confirmation word or code and a request that the sender respond by typing in that word or code.<br>
Preferably, the word or code transmitted to the user is in  a  non-computer  harvestable  form.     This  can  be accomplished as in the exemplary note above, where the word is simply chosen from others on the screen, and the text of the message instructs the sender on h.ow to locate the word. Alternately, the word can be transmitted and displayed as an image  that  has  been  manipulated  -to  discourage  optical character recognition.   Figure 3 shows an exemplary word manipulated in such a fashion; while it is easy for a person to read, it is not in a form that a computer system can readily decipher.<br>
If the intro word is typed in correctly via the web page (step 235), then the sender's email address is added to the "white list" (step 250) , which is a list of all valid<br><br>
M<br>
senders, chat message is accepted into the recipient's inbox (step  255),  and any messages  currently  stored  in  the unconfirmed mailbox from that sender are delivered to the recipient's inbox (step 260).<br>
If none of the above conditions have been met, including if the correct word was not received (in steps 235 or 240) , the email is presumed to be spam and is left in the unconfirmed mailbox for a predefined period of time, then is typically deleted.<br>
This process therefore provides a means that will effectively eliminate 100% of received spam before it is delivered to the recipient. Indeed, preferably the spam is never seen by the recipient at all.<br>
One particular feature of at least some disclosed embodiment involves getting confirmation that senders unknown to the receiver are real people and is performed by getting the person to type in or send a special word. As described above, this word will be given to the sender in a form unreadable to computers. One way of doing so is by using descriptive text such as: "My intro-word is the third word in the following sentence. The quick brown fox../' Another approach is transmitting the word as an obscured image, as described above.<br>
Preferably, all of the processing above is performed on the recipient's email server - generally a server owned by the internet service provider supplying their e-mail service. In alternate embodiments, some or all received e-mail can be downloaded to the client data processing system to perform the processing described herein. Also, according to other embodiments,  the "unconfirmed" mailbox is on a<br><br>
■
 <br>
&gt;Z<br><br>
r'C'i"/i;;-;.&gt;f)0 UDV.WU<br><br>
different mail server than the recipient's local email store. Further, according to some embodiments, the server system that handles the confirmation response and web interface is a different system than the recipient's mail server.<br>
In some embodiments, the intro-word, or multiple intro-words, are user selectable to ensure that specific types of emails, such as mailing-list messages, are received into the inbox.<br>
Another feature of some embodiments includes a web site that allows access to all e-mails that are unconfirmed. After registering for a mailserver, the user can check all unconfirmed e-mails and add any senders to the valid senders list.<br>
Those skilled in the art will  recognize that,  for simplicity and clarity, the full structure and operation of all data  processing systems  suitable  for  use with  the present invention is not being depicted, or described herein. Instead, only so much of a data processing system as is unique  to  the  present  invention ox  necessary  for  an understanding of the present invention  is depicted and described.  The remainder of the construction and operation of data processing system 100 may conform to any of the various current implementations and practices known in the art.<br>
It is important to note that while the present invention has been described in the context of a fully functional system, those skilled in the art will appreciate that at least portions of the mechanism of the present invention are capable of being distributed in the form of<br><br>
