				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an imployed boom for use with a crane. In particular, this invention relates to a power pinned manual extension member of said boom.<br>
Cranes presently known in the art have normally a boom of fixed length. Due to such a fixed<br>
length of the boom, hooks are provided at different lengths of the boom depending upon the weight of the<br>
load to be lifted by the crane. Such hooks are held to the boom through hook plates rigid1y he1d to the boom<br>
at  said different lengths.<br>
The disadvantage associated with such a known construction is that the boom is of a fixed length and some time it. is difficult to lift a particular weight.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a boom for use with a crane,<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to propose  a boom having a power pinned  manual  extension member„<br>
Still another object of this invention is  to propose  a  boom  of  an  adjustable  length  which   is efficien t.,,<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved boom for use with a crane comprising a mother boom having first and second extensions disposed therein a manual extension member being provided with the last hydraulic operating extension member of the main jib of a crane, characterised by a push rod having its distal end secured to said manual extension member and the proximal end to said hydraulic operated extended member being provided to stop the retracting/backward movement of said manual extension so as to adjust the height of the boom.<br>
Specifically in according with this invention a manually operated extension member is provided with the first hydraulic operating extension member and is locked by means of a locking pin provided with said hydraulic operated extension member. In operation, the hydraulic operated member is extended outwardly. A locking pin is provided in a hole provided at the distal end of the hydraulic operated extension member and is adapted to be removed so as to lock the manually operated extension member with the hydraulic extension member. The boom further comprises<br>
a  push rod secured to  the distal end to  the  manually<br>
operated extension member and at the proximal end to the hvdraulic operated extension member. The push rod<br>
has a plurality of spaced holes for accommodating the locking pin in any one of said holes,, When the<br>
hydraulic operated extension member is retracted within the main lib or boom,, the pin strickes the boom and<br>
allows the manual extension member to be remained outwardly,, The snatch block is secured to the distal<br>
end of the manual extension member.<br>
A  boom for use with a crane according  to  a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated<br>
in the e acompanying drawinqs wherein ;...<br>
Fig,, 1 shows the boom in retractecl/unextended position;<br>
Fiq,, 2 shows the boom having first and second extensions in extended position ;<br>
Fiq,,  3  shows the boom having manual extension  in  the extended positionsand<br>
Fiq.  4  shows  the  boom  havinq  manual  extension  in extended  position but first extension  in  the u n e x p e n d e d / r e t r a c ted  p o s i t ion <br>
Referring to t h e  drawinqs particular1y fig •<br>
1 the boom comprises a mother boom B secured with the frame of the crane. A first extension X1 is disposed<br>
within the mother boom B such that to be extended outwardlv bv the hydraulic means provided for expending<br>
and retracting/unexpending the booms „ A sencond extension is disposed within the first extension such<br>
that to be extended outwardly by the hydraulic means. These features are as such known in the art and do not<br>
constitute inventive features „<br>
Specifically,  according to this invention  a<br>
power pinnecl manual extension and is provided with the second extension X2 such that to be extended by means of<br>
the hydraulic means in the same way as herein described above. For' this purpose a push rod R is secured with<br>
the front/distal end of the manual extension M with the help of nut and bolts M B and the rear end of the rod<br>
is secured with the proximal/rear end of the hyciraulical 1 y operated 2nd extension. A pin P is<br>
provided at the distal end of the first extension XI such that to be replaced as and when required to fit in<br><br>
the  holes HI, H2,, H3 etc. provided in the push  rod   R<br>
for  stopping  the  retracting  movement  of  the  manua1 extension  M during the retracting/backward movement  of<br>
the first and second extension XI. and X2.<br>
Thus during the operation of the crane  first<br>
and  second extension XI and X2 are  extended  outwardly with  the help of the hydraulic means provided with  the<br>
crane.  The manual extension is extended outwardly; from the  second  extension manually and the power pin  P  is<br>
removed  from the first extension and is placed  in  any one of the holes H1, H2, H3 etc,, of the push rod  as  per<br>
the requirements  now the first and second  extensions are  retracted   to  fix the height  of  the  crane  and<br>
retracting  movement of the manual extension is  stopped as  the power pin P butted/strickes aqainst  the  distal<br>
end  of the respective ex tenstion and thus  remain  out, even   if   the  respective   extension   is   retracted<br>
completely„<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	An improved boom for use with a crane comprising a mother boom<br>
having   first   and   second   extensions   disposed   therein   a   manual<br>
extension member being provided with the last hydraulic operating<br>
extension member of the main jib of a crane, Characterised by a push<br>
rod having its distal end secured to said manual extension member<br>
and the proximal end to said hydraulic operated extended member<br>
being provided to stop the retracting/backward movement of said<br>
manual extension so as to adjust the height of the boom.<br>
2.	An improved boom as claimed in claim 1 wherein the push rod is<br>
provided with a plurality of holes to receive a pin provided at the distal<br>
end of the first extension of the boom.<br>
3. An  improved  boom  for use  with  a  crane  substantially  as  herein described and illustrated.<br></td>
