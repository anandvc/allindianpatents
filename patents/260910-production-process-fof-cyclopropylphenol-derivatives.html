DESCRIPTION<br>
PRODUCTION PROCESS OF CYCLOPROPYLPHENOL DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing cyclopropylphenol derivatives useful as intermediates of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and functional materials. BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
Cyclopropylphenol derivatives of the present invention are useful as intermediates of pharmaceuticals/ agrochemicals and functional materials.  For example, a 3-phenoxy-4-pyridazinol derivative having herbicidal activity is produced using a cyclopropylphenol derivative as an intermediate (Patent Document 1).  Examples of known process for producing cyclopropylphenol derivatives include a process for synthesizing from styrenes by a Simmons-Smith reaction (Non-Patent Document 1), a process in which a 5-phenyl-pyrazoline is heated to reduce ring size (Non-Patent Document 2), a process in which an allyl phenol ether is subjected to an intramolecular ring closure by photoreaction (Non-Patent Document 3), a process for condensing a vinyl phenol ether and diazomethane using a palladium catalyst (Non-Patent Document 4), a process for coupling a hydroxy(cyclopropyl)boron complex, obtained by dihydroboronation of propagyl bromide followed by treatment with an alkaline aqueous solution, with a phenyl bromide using a palladium catalyst (Non-Patent Document 5), a process for synthesizing via an intramolecular ring closure by reacting l-allyloxy-2-bromobenzene and t-butyl lithium (Non-Patent Document 6), a process for condensing cyclopropyl borate with a phenyl bromide in the presence<br><br>
of a palladium catalyst (Non-Patent Document 7), a process for synthesizing from (1,3-dibromopropyl)benzene by an intramolecular ring closure reaction using zinc (Non-Patent Document 8) and a process for reacting chloroform with a styrene in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst and sodium hydroxide (Non-Patent Document 9).<br>
[0003]<br>
However, Simmons-Smith reagent, palladium catalyst and boron complexes are expensive reagents, and since intramolecular ring closure reactions by photoreaction or using t-butyl lithium, reactions for reducing ring size of pyrazoline using heat, cyclization reactions of dibromophenols using zinc or the like result in the formation of large amounts of by-products, the yield of the desired compound is generally low. Moreover, since Simmons-Smith reagent, diazomethane, boron complexes, t-butyl lithium and palladium catalysts and the like are unstable reagents, they have shortcomings such as problems with ease of the reaction procedure.  In addition, in Non-Patent Document 8, a 4-(1,3-dibromopropyl)phenyl acetate derivative is synthesized by reacting a cinnamyl alcohol derivative and acetyl bromide, and then followed by an intramolecular ring closure reaction with zinc to synthesize a desired cyclopropylphenol derivative. However, cinnamyl alcohol is not acquired easily.  In addition, in Non-Patent Document 9, dichloromethylcarbene is generated from chloroform by a styrene derivative to synthesize a dichlorocyclopropylphenol derivative. However, chloroform is highly toxic and it is difficult to acquire styrene derivatives.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention [0004]<br>
The inventors of the present invention conducted extensive studies to develop a simple synthesis process in consideration of the importance of cyclopropylphenol derivatives as synthesis intermediates of pharmaceuticals/ agrochemicals and functional materials.

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
Title: Production process for cyclopropylphenol derivatives.<br>
An object of the present invention is to find a method for easily synthesizing cyclopropylphenol derivatives. The object of the present invention is to find a process for producing a cyclopropylphenol derivative represented by general formula (10):<br><br>
[wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or the like; Z represents a hydrogen atom or the like; and Y1, Y2 and Y3 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or the like];<br>
and solved by the process comprising reacting a compound represented by general formula (7): <br>
[wherein each of the symbols are the same as previously defined; X represents a halogen atom; and V represents a hydrogen atom or the like],<br>
with a metal, metal salt or organometallic compound represented by general formula (8): M2 to obtain a compound represented by general formula (9):<br><br>
[wherein each of the symbols are the same as previously defined] and obtaining a compound represented by general formula (10) by hydrolysis in the case V represents the group, -W-R5.</td>
