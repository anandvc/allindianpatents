DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, the environmental pollution with a variety<br>
of chemical substances have been grasped as a global-scale<br>
 problem, and the intensified social demand exists for<br>
suppressing the release of chemical substances into the<br>
environment to a minimum level. In the filed of agriculture,<br>
also, diverse studies have been conducted to exploit a method<br>
for controlling harmful and injurious organisms, or pests,<br>
without use of chemical substances, such as the creation or<br>
generation of genetically modified crops, the control of pests<br>
with their natural enemies and the physical control of pests,<br>
etc.<br>
However, such methods for controlling pests without use<br>
of chemical substances are encountered with numerous problems,<br>
such as their uniquely limited, sole use in controlling specific<br>
diseases or insect pests, instability of the effect, and the<br>
like, and the need for controlling pests with chemical<br>
substances therefore has not yet been reduced.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
The present inventors, with a specific view to reduction<br>
in application rate of agricultural chemicals or pesticides<br>
from the standpoint of prevention of the environmental<br><br>
pollution, etc., conducted repeated intensive research, and as<br>
a result, found that a mixture of a compound represented by the<br>
general formula [I] with a neonicotinoid compound represented<br>
by the general formula [II] can produce a greater effect than<br>
would be expected when both of the compounds individually are<br>
applied solely, thus enabling a reduction in the rate or number<br>
of application of agrochemicals or pesticides to be realized.<br>
Also, it was found that such mixtures, even when applied to<br>
locations other than the sites on which insect pests inflict<br>
injuries directly, such as seeds, seed potatoes or soils of<br>
nursery beds or farms on wich crops are grown, and the like,<br>
can control insect pests in an extremely effective manner. Such<br>
findings, followed by continued intensive investigation, led<br>

fumigants, smokes, stick preparations for drenching of crops,<br>
or oil preparations, etc. If necessary, these agrochemical<br>
preparations may suitably be incorporated with ointment bases,<br>
emulsifiers, suspending agents, spreaders, penetrants,<br>
wetting agents, dispersing agents, stabilizers, binders,<br>
fluidizing auxiliary agents, flocculants, antioxidants,<br>
floating agents, anti-foaming agents, anti-freezing agents,<br>
 preservatives, dehydrating agents, UV absorbers, UV scattering<br>
agents, coloring agents or suspension stabilizers, etc., and<br>
can be prepared by the procedures known per se. Namely, such<br>
preparations can be manufactured by mixing uniformly the<br>
compound [I] or its salt and the neonicotinoid compound [II]<br>
with a liquid or solid carrier as well as the above-described<br>
various additives, etc.<br>
For example, an emulsion or emulsifiable concentrate can<br>
be manufactured by mixing for dissolution uniformly the<br>
compound [I] or its salt and the neonicotinoid compound [II]<br>
as well as an emulsifier and an organic solvent, etc. For<br>
example, a granule, a granular wettable powder and the like can<br>
be manufactured by mixing uniformly the compound [ I ] or its salt<br>
and the neonicotinoid compound [II], as well as a dispersing<br>
agent (surfactant), binder and extender (or solid carrier),<br>
etc., followed by granulation. For example, a dust (e.g. a DL<br>
dust, etc.) can be manufactured by mixing for pulverizing<br>
uniformly the compound [I] or its salt, the neonicotinoid<br>
compound [II] and an extender (or solid carrier), etc. For<br><br>
example, a flowable preparation can be manufactured by mixing<br>
for dispersion the ingredients, such as the compound [I] or its<br>
salt and the neonicotinoid compound [II], a dispersing agent,<br>
etc. with use of a stirring machine, followed by wet<br>
pulverization with Dyno-Mill, etc. For example, a Jumbo<br>
preparation can be manufactured by mixing uniformly the<br>
compound [I] or its salt, the neonicotinoid compound [II], and<br>
a dispersing agent (surfactant), binder, floating agent and<br>
extender (or solid carrier), etc., followed by granulation.<br>

one or two or more kinds (preferably not less than one but not<br>
more than three kinds) in appropriate ratios.<br>
As the solid carrier (i.e., diluents and extenders),<br>

three kinds) of them in suitable ratios.<br>
As the binder, use is made of dextrin, alpha-starch,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, gum arable, sodium alginate,<br>

etc., and these can suitably be used by mixing one or two or<br>
more kinds (preferably not less than one but not more thant three<br>
kinds) of them in appropriate ratios.<br>

auxiliary agent (e.g., isopropyl acid phosphate), talc, etc.,<br>

one or two or more kinds (preferably, not less than one but not<br>
more than three kinds) of them in appropriate ratios.<br>
As the flocculant, use is made of liquid paraffin, ethylene<br>
glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol or isobutylene<br>
polymer (e.g., IP Solvent), etc., and these can suitably be used<br>
by mixing one or two or more kinds (preferably, not less than<br>

1 (preferably 1 to 0.5), and the like. The said powdered bases<br>
 are pref erably exemplified by those withr a particle size of not<br>
more than 600 µm, preferably 600 µm to 10 µm; the inorganic ones<br>

substances" which are in the solid state at ambient temperature,<br>
such as stearic acid and palmitic acid, as well as higher<br>
alcohols, such as stearyl alcohol, paraffin wax and the like.<br>
Since such waxy substances are water-repellent and resistant<br>
to water-penetration, there develops the likelihood that the<br>
active ingredients of agrochemicals tend to be entrapped in such<br>
waxy substances over an extended period of time and get<br>
difficult to be dispersed into water, and consequently, such<br><br>
active ingredients are preferably used by mixing with the<br>
above-described glassy or vitreous hollow materials.<br>

one or two or more kinds (preferably, not less than one but not<br>
more than three kinds) of them in appropriate ratios.<br>
As the UV scattering agent, use is made of titanium dioxide,<br>
etc., and these can suitably be used by mixing one or two or<br><br>
more kinds (preferably, not less than one but not more than three<br>
kinds) of them in appropriate ratios.<br>
As the coloring agent, use is made of Cyaningreen G,<br>
Eriogreen B400, etc., and these can suitably be used by mixing<br>
one or two or more kinds (preferably, not less than one but not<br>
more than three kinds) of them in appropriate ratios.<br>

powder, wettable powder, etc. may be used after being packed<br>
as divided in 20 to 200 g unit portions in bags made of a<br>
water-soluble film in order to simplify their application. The<br>
said water-soluble film is exemplified by polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, starch, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylic acid and its salts, Pullulan<br>
(tradename: starch-based polysaccharides) or Paogen<br>
(tradename: water-soluble thermoplastic polymer), etc.<br>
In manufacturing the composition preparations according<br>
to the present invention, it is possible to control the release<br>
of both or either one of the active ingredients, as the case<br>
may be, to thereby sustain its or their insecticidal effect(s)<br>
over a prolonged period of time.<br>
The compound [I] or its salt and the neonicotinoid compound<br>
[II] as combined are normally contained in the composition of<br>
the present invention at the rate of about 0.1 to 80% by weight<br><br>
based on the total weight of the composition. In cases where<br>
they are utilized in the form of, for example, emulsifiable<br>
concentrate, soluble liquid, wettable powder (e.g., granular<br>
wettable powder), aqueous suspension preparation or<br>
mlcroemuision, etc., they are suitably incorporated into such<br>
formulations at the rate in the range of normally about 1 to<br>
80% by weight, preferably about 10 to 50% by weight. In cases<br>
where they are utilized in the formulations forms, such as oil<br>
solution, dust, etc., they are suitably formulated into such<br>
formulations at the rate in the range of normally about 0.1 to<br>
 50% by weight, preferably about 0.1 to 20% by weight. When they<br>
are used in the formulations forms, such as granule, tablet,<br>
jumbo preparation, etc., they are incorporated into such<br>
formulations at the rate in the range of normally about 0.5 to<br>
50% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to 10 %by weight.<br>
The compound [I] or its salt and the neonicotinoid<br>
compound [II] are preferably contained in the composition of<br>
the present invention at the rate of 1:0.1 to 1:20 on a weight<br>
ratio, more preferably 1:0.2 to 1:10 on a weight ratio.<br>
The contents of additives other than the above-mentioned<br>
active ingredients are usually in the range of about 0.001 to<br>
99.9% by weight, preferably about 1 to 99% by weight, though<br>
they vary depending upon the type or content of the active<br>
ingredients of agrochemicals, or the formulation of<br>
agrochemical preparations, etc. More particularly, it is<br>
preferred to add, on the basis of the total weight of the<br>
composition, a surfactant at rates In the range of normally<br>
about 1 to 30% by weight, preferably about 1 to 15% by weight,<br>
a fluidizing auxiliary agent at rates in the range of about 1<br><br>
to 20% by weight, and a carrier at rates in the range of about<br>
1 to 90% by weight, preferably 1	about 1 to 70% by weight,<br>
respectively. Specifically, in the case of manufacture of a<br>
liquid preparation, it is preferable to add a surfactant at<br>
rates in the range of normally about 1 to 20% by weight,<br>
preferably 1 to 10% by weight, and water at rates in the range<br>
of about 20 to 90% by weight, respectively. In cases where an<br>
emulsifiable concentrate is produced, it is desirable to add<br>
a surfactant at rates in the range of normally about 1 to 30%<br>
by weight, preferably about 2 to 15% by weight, and an organic<br>
 solvent. In the case of production of a granular wettable powder<br>
it is desired to add a surfactant at rates in the range of<br>
normally about 0.1 to 10% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to<br>
5% by weight, and a binder at rates in the range of about 0.1<br>
to 15% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to 5% by weight,<br>
respectively, as well as an extender, such as lactose, ammonium<br>
sulfate or clay, etc. In cases where a granule is manufactured,<br>
it is desirable to add a surfactant at rates in the range of<br>
normally about 0.1 to 10% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to<br>
5% by weight, and a stabilizer at rates in the range of about<br>
0.1 to 10 % by weight, preferably about 0.5 to 5% by weight,<br>
respectively, as well as an extender, such as clay, etc. In<br>
the case of production of a jumbo preparation, it is desired<br>
to add a surfactant at rates in the range of normally about 0.1<br>
to 15% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to 5% by weight, a binder<br>
at rates in the range of about 0.5 to 10% by weight, preferably<br>
about 0.5 to 5% by weight, and a floating agent at rates in the<br>
range of about 0.5 to 40% by weight, preferably about 1 to 20%<br>
by weight, respectively, as well as an extender, such clay, etc.<br><br>
A wettable powder (e.g., a granular wettable powder) and<br>
the like, on the occasion of use, are desirably applied or<br>
sprayed after being suitably diluted (e.g., about 100- to<br>
5,000-fold dilution) with water, etc.<br>
Moreover, the composition of the present invention can<br>
suitably be used after being incorporated with the active<br>

The above-mentioned "other active ingredients of<br>
agrochemicals" all are the known active ingredients of<br>
agrochemicals. The other active ingredients of agrochemicals<br><br>
may be contained in one or two or more kinds (preferably, not<br>
less than one but not more than three kinds) in the compositions.<br>
The compositions of the present invention exhibit an<br>
improved degree of safety to mammals and crops, while they<br>
possess enhanced insecticidal action against many species of<br>
insect pests (inclusive of arthropods other than the class<br>
Insecta).<br>
When not less than two kinds of insecticidal compounds are<br>
mixed in aiming at an intensified efficacy or a broadened scope<br>
of the targeted insect pests to be controlled, generally,<br>
investigation is carried out into a novel application by simply<br>
adding the application rates determined for their single<br>
applications, whereby there is incurred an increased risk of<br>
causing chemical injuries. In the combined treatment according<br>
to the present invention, the compounds [I] themselves are<br>
almost free from their risk of causing chemical injuries, and<br>
consequently, the risk of causing chemical injuries to be<br>
incurred by such treatment is substantially negligible, in<br>
contrast with the treatment through single application of the<br>
compound [II]. Because the compositions can produce the<br>
synergistic effect, additionally, the application rates of<br>
either one or both of the compounds [I] and [II] can be reduced<br>
from the ones specified for single uses of these compounds,<br>
thereby leading to a by far reduced risk of causing chemical<br>
injuries.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are specifically<br>
applicable, for example, to the control of the below-described<br>
insect pests:<br>
Namely, they are especially effective for controlling the<br><br>

Also, the compositions of the present invention can find<br>
application in the field of treatment of livestock diseases and<br>
in the industry of animal husbandry as well as in maintenance<br>
of the public hygiene by exterminating arthropoids and parasite<br>
insects living in and/or on the bodies of the class Vertebrate,<br>
such as humans, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, poultry, dogs, cats<br>
and fishes. Examples of the said parasites include Aedes spp.,<br>
Anopheles spp., Culex spp., Culicodes spp., Musca spp.,<br>
Hypoderma spp., Gasterophilus spp., Haematobla spp., Tabanus<br>
spp., Simullum spp., Trlatoma spp., Phthiraptera (e.g..<br><br>
Damalinla spp.,Linognathus spp..Haematopinus spp.), fleas<br>
(e.g., Ctenocephalides spp., Xenosylla spp., etc.) or<br>
monomorium pharaonis, and the like.<br>
The compositions of the present invention show an extremely<br>
low toxicity and can be used as an excellent agrochemical<br>
composition.<br>
For example, the compositions of the present invention can<br>
be sprayed over paddy fields, fields, fruit tree orchards,<br>
non-cultivated waste lands, houses, etc. by use of the per se<br>
known methods to thereby exterminate the above-mentioned living<br>
insect pests (injurious insects)by allowing such insect pests<br>
to contact with or ingest them. In another embodiment of the<br>
present invention, for example, the compositions of the present<br>
invention can be administered to vertebrates internally (in the<br>
body) or externally (on the body surface) to thereby exterminate<br>
the arthropods parasitic on such vertebrate or parasites.<br>
With reference to the particular application method for<br>
the combination preparations comprising the composition of the<br>
present invention, use can be made of the same methods as the<br>
ordinary agrochemical application methods. Also, the<br>
preparations each containing a single different active<br>
ingredient can find application through blending on the<br>
occasion of use. The application method for such agrochemical<br>
preparations can be exemplified by the foliage application,<br>
trunk or bark application, ULV application, granule<br>
foliar-application, land or soil application, soil drenching,<br>
water-surface application, soil Incorporation, nursery bed<br>
incorporation, seedling-raising box treatment, nursery bed<br>
treatment, plant foot treatment, planting furrow treatment.<br><br>
planting row treatment, side row treatment, trunk or bark<br>
drenching, trunk or bark spreading, seed coating or dressing,<br>
seed immersion or soaking, poison bait, fertilizer<br>
incorporation or water blending or mixing for irrigation, etc.,<br>
but are not understood to be limited to them. The application<br>
time for the combination preparations comprising the<br>
composition of the present invention or mixtures of the<br>
preparations each containing a single different active<br>
ingredient may be any arbitrary occasions in advance of planting<br>
in the case of treatment of seeds, seed potatoes or bulbs, etc.;<br>
and may be the occasions of sowing, seedling raising or seedling<br>
planting for the improved efficacy, although it can be any<br>
occasion during the vegetation period after seedling planting,<br>
in the case of treatment of the soil; and may be any occasions<br>
during the seedling raising period and during the vegetation<br>
period on the farm field in the case of foliar application or<br>
spraying.<br>
In cases where sowing is effected on the nursery soil for<br>
seedling raising into which the combination preparations<br>
comprising the composition of the present invention or mixtures<br>
of the formulations each comprising a single different active<br>
have been incorporated, when provisional planting is done with<br>
use of the said nursery bed soil, or in cases where the soil<br>
is treated through solution drenching or granule application<br>
during the seedling raising period, all the insect pests<br>
appearing during the seedling raising period can also be<br>
exterminated.<br>
As the application method on the occasion of seedling<br>
planting, treatment can be conducted through soil incorporation<br><br>
on the whole surface of the field or on furrows in advance of<br>
planting, while treatment can also be done by granule<br>
application or solution drenching into planting holes. After<br>
planting, furthermore, treatment can be effected by immediately<br>
applying a granule or drenching a solution at plant foots.<br>
The crop to be raised by seedling in the farm field is able<br>
to be subjected not only to seed treatment, but also soil<br>
incorporation treatment on the whole surface of the field or<br>
on the furrows in advance of planting.<br>
The compositions of the present invention, through their<br>
mixed use with natural-enemy microbial formulationsr their<br>
combined utilization with natural-enemy organisms (e.g.,<br>
natural enemy insects, such as parasitic bees and predacious<br>
beetles, predacious acarides, parasitic nematodes,<br>
insect-pathogenic microbes, etc.), their combined use with<br>
insect pheromones, their combined employment with genetically<br>
modified crops, their combined utilization with attractants<br>
and repellents, and the like, can contribute to promotion of<br>
the IMP (Integrated Pest Management).<br>
Taking for example the control of diamond-back moths by<br>
way of the disturbance in signal communication through use of<br>
the pheromones or with utilization of the natural enemies in<br>
the cultivation of cabbages, such controlling methods are known<br>
to be less effective or entirely ineffective, when the<br>
population density of the injurious insect to be controlled<br>
becomes high. In the farm filed where the population density<br>
of diamond-back moths is suppressed to an extremely lower level<br>
through soil treatment with the composition of the present<br>
invention conducted on the occasion of planting of cabbages,<br><br>
at the point of time when the compound [I] or its salt, or the<br>
neonicotinoid compound [II] starts to lose its residual effect,<br>
the disturbance in signal communication or the utilization of<br>
the natural enemies can be employed to thereby secure by far<br>
the originally intended effect of such signal communication<br>
disturbance or the natural-enemy utilization, thus ensuring<br>
that the pest control would keep on working over a prolonged<br>
period of time. In controlling insect pests by way of the<br>
disturbance in signal communication through use of the<br>
pheromones or with utilization of the natural enemies, moreover,<br>
the problem arises with proliferation of injurious insects<br>
other than the targeted one to be controlled. Under these<br>
circumstances, the compositions of the present invention can<br>
be applied to thereby suppress the proliferation of injurious<br>
insects other than the targeted one, which proliferation has<br>
been the problem of great concern in the control of insect pests<br>
by way of the disturbance in signal communication or with<br>
utilization of natural enemies, and can therefore provide the<br>
by far improved integrated pest control.<br>
The application rate of the compositions of the present<br>
invention can be varied over a widened range, depending for<br>
example upon the time, location and method of application, etc.<br>
but the application is desirably effected at rates of about 0.3<br>
to 3,000 g, preferably about 50 to 1,000 g, of the active<br>
ingredient (the total sum of the amounts of the compound [I]<br>
or its salt and the neonicotinoid compound [II]) per hectare.<br>
In cases where the composition of the present invention is<br>
formulated into the form of wettable powder, it is desirable<br>
to make application after being diluted to a final concentration<br><br>
of the active ingredient (the total sum of the concentrations<br>
of the compound [ I ] or its salt and the neonicotinoid compound<br>
[II]) of about 0.1 to 1,000 ppm, preferably about 10 to 200 ppm,<br>
for foliage application, and about 1 to 10,000 ppm, preferably<br>
about 100 to 2,000 ppm, for drenching into the soil.<br>

Test Example 1: Insecticidal effect against Spodoptera litura<br>
by soaking treatment of a bait crop plant:<br>
A test compound was dissolved by addition of acetone<br>
containing 5 % of Tween 20 (tradename) at the rate of 0.1 ml<br>
per 1 mg of the test compound, and after the solution is diluted<br>
with aqueous 5,000-fold diluted DAIN solution to a<br>
predetermined concentration, soybean leaves after complete<br>
development of primary leaves were treated through soaking in<br>
the insecticide solution for several seconds. After the<br>
insecticide solution was dried, four primary leaves were cut<br>
off and placed in an ice-cream cup (with a capacity of 180 ml),<br>
in which 10 heads of 3-instra larvae of Spodoptera litura were<br>
released. The ice-cream cup was kept in a breeding room<br>
controlled at a constant temperature (25°C), and the number of<br>
dead larvae was counted three days later. The death rate of<br>
larvae was calculated by the following equation, and the results<br>
were shown in Table 1.<br>
[Equation 1]<br>
Death rate of larvae =( Number of larvae dead)/(Number of larvae<br><br><br>
When the effect obtained by combination of two kinds of<br>
the active compounds exceeds the expected value E as calculated<br>
by the below-described equation of Colby et al., the synergistic<br>
effect is deemed to exist.<br>
[Equation 2]<br>
E = X + Y - X • Y/100<br>
wherein<br>
E = the death rate of larvae obtained when the active compounds<br>
A and B are used at the dose of m and n, respectively;<br>
X = the death rate of larvae when the active compound A is<br>
used at the dose of m;<br>
Y = the death rate of larvae when the active compound B is<br>
used at the dose of n.<br>
As is indicated in Table 1, the Compound (I-2), when used<br><br>
as a mixture with clothianidin, was found to produce a greater<br>
insecticidal effect than would be expected when individually<br>
used alone.<br>
Test Example 2: Insecticidal effect against Spodoptera litura<br>
through soaking treatment of roots of a bait crop plant<br>
A test compound was dissolved by adding acetone<br>
containing 5 % of Tween 20 (tradename) at the rate of 0.1 ml<br>
per 1 mg of the test compound, and the insecticide solution<br>
prepared by diluting the solution with ion-exchange water to<br>
a predetermined concentration was charged into a light-shielded<br>
Erlenmeyer flask (100 ml), into which the root portion of a<br>
soybean plant in the stage of development of primary leaves was<br>
soaked after being washed with running water to remove soil.<br>
Five days after root soaking, two primary leaves were cut off<br>
and placed in an ice-cream cup (with a capacity of 180 ml), into<br>
which 10 heads of 3-instar larvae were released. The ice-cream<br>
cup was kept in a breeding room controlled at a constant<br>
temperature (25°C), and 5 days later, the number of dead larvae<br>
was counted. The death rate of larvae was calculated by the<br>
following equation, with the results being tabulated in Tables<br>
2 and 3.<br>

containing 5 % of Tween 20 (tradename) at the rate of 0.1 ml<br>
per 1 mg of the test compound, and the insecticide solution<br>
prepared by diluting the solution with ion-exchange water to<br>
a predetermined concentration was drenched onto the surface of<br>
the soil for raising rice seedlings (5 to 6 seedlings /plant as<br>
 planted in a paper pet)in the 2.5- to 3-leaf stage at the rate<br>
of 1 ml per plant. Two days later, the stalks about 2 cm higher<br>
above the soil surface were cut and placed in a test tube, into<br>
which 10 heads of 3-instar larvae of Chilo suppressalis were<br>
released. The test rube was kept in a breeding chamber<br>
controlled at a constant temperature (25°C), and the number of<br>
living larvae was counted 4 to 5 days later. The death rate of<br>
larvae was calculated by the following equation, and the results<br>
were shown in Tables 4 and 5.<br>

solution:<br>
A test compound was dissolved by adding acetone<br>
containing 5 % of Tween 20 (tradename) at the rate of 0.1 ml<br>
per 1 mg of the test compound, and the solution was diluted with<br>
 ion - exchange water to a total volume of 3 ml. Each of the<br>
insecticide solutions prepared was drenched onto the surface<br>
of the plant root soil for a cabbage plant grown in a cell tray<br>
(with a soil capacity of 24 ml). Four days later, the<br>
above-ground part of the plant was cut and placed in a plastic<br>
cup, into which 10 heads of 2-instar larvae of Plutella<br>
xylostella were released. The cup was kept in a breeding chamber<br>
controlled at a constant temperature (25°C), and the number of<br>
living larvae was counted 4 days later. The death rate of larvae<br>
was calculated by the following equation, and the results were<br>

INSECTICIDE COMPOSITIONS<br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>
Insecticide compositions which comprise one or not less<br>
than two kinds of compounds being selected from a compound<br>
represented by the formula [I]:<br><br>
or a salt thereof, and a neonicotinoid compound represented by<br>
the formula [II]:<br><br>
The insecticide compositions can produce higher insecticidal<br>
effects than would be expected when each of the active<br>
ingredients is used singly, namely a synergistic effect, thus<br>
enabling reductions in the rate or number of application of<br>
agrochemicals and pesticides to be realized.</td>
