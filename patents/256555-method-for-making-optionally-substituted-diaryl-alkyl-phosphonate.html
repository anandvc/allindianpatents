3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/700,581 entitled "Method for Preparing Diaromatic Alkylphosphonates" filed July 19, 2005, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/747,892 entitled "Method for Preparing Diaromatic Alkylphosphonates" filed May 22, 2006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Various methods for the synthesis of diaromatic alkylphosphonates are known. Methods for making diaromatic alkylphosphonates are described in U.S. Patents 4,152,373 and 4,377,537, for example. In U.S. Patent No. 4,152,373, diaromatic alkylphosphonates are prepared by the reaction of a triaromaticphosphite specifically triphenylphosphite and methanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of methyl iodide. The reaction temperatures are higher than the boiling point of methanol (~65°C), and consequently require a relatively slow addition of methanol in order to keep it from boiling out of the reactor. In this reaction, phenol is a by-product that is distilled from the product in a separate step.<br>
, U.S. Patent No. 4,377,537 describes a method of synthesiszing diaromatic methylphosphonates by the reaction of a triarylphosphite (specifically triphenylphosphite) and trialkylphosphite (specifically trimethylphosphite) in the presence of a catalytic amount of methyl iodide. The reaction typically involves heating the components to a final temperature of about 230°C for up to 1 hour. Exothermic reactions for this process occur in two temperature regions, the first around 100°C, and the second near 210°C. Due to the exothermic (even explosive) nature of these reactions when used in a batch process the<br><br>
reaction scheme described in U.S. Patent No. 4,377,537 is limited to small scale production of diaromatic alkylphosphonates<br>
Although some diaromatic alkylphosphonates (e.g. diphenyl methylphosphonate (Registry number 7526-26-3) are commercially available, they are relatively expensive.<br>

, One of the embodiments of the present invention provides a method for making optionally substituted diaryl alkylphosphonates, diaryl alkylphosphonates prepared using the method, and compositions related to the method. The method includes preparing a mixture having an optionally substituted arylol, a phosphorus trihalide and an optionally substituted alkanol. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, an optionally substituted arylol may be introduced into a flask and heated. A phosphorous trihalide may then be added over a period of time. The time may vary depending upon the amount of material to be produced. Additional heating steps at various temperatures may be performed to drive the reaction and aid in the removal of generated acids and excess arylol. An optionally substituted alkanol may be added over a second period of time and the reaction may be heated.  The reaction may proceed without addition of a catalyst. Alternatively, a<br><br>
catalyst (e.g. an alkylating agent) may be added along with the alkanol or after addition of the alkanol. The temperature may then be increased. The reaction may continue until the reaction has gone to completion. The optionally substituted diaryl alkylphosphonate product of the reaction may than be analyzed by GC/MS. In certain embodiments, the method described above is used to make diphenylmethylphosphonate.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides for a composition having an optionally substituted arylol, a phosphorous trihalide, and an optionally substituted alkanol that may be useful for making diaryl alkylphosphonates. In other embodiments, the composition may comprise the product from reacting phosphorous trihalide and optionally substituted arylol, and optionally substituted alkanol. In another embodiment, the composition comprises an optionally substituted arylol, a phosphorous trihalide, an optionally substituted alkanol, and a catalyst.<br>
In another embodiment, an optionally substituted arylol, an optionally substituted alkanol, phosphorous "trihalide or any combination of these are combined in a vessel to form a diaryl alkylphosphonate without an exogenous catalyst. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed in this embodiment an in situ catalyst is formed by the reaction.<br>
In one embodiment, the diaryl alkylphosphonates of the present invention may be prepared in a single reaction vessel providing, as part of the present invention, a method for a one-pot synthesis of diaryl alkylphosphonate.<br>
The diaryl alkylphosphonates or optionally substituted diaryl alkylphosphonates encompassed by embodiments of the current invention may be of general formula (1):<br><br>
fyO-<br><br>
-OR.,<br><br>
R2<br>
0)<br>
where Ri may be an aromatic or aryl group, or a substituted aryl group of formula (2):<br><br>
where R3, R4, R5 R6, and R7 may independently be any substituent including but not limited to hydrogen, C1-C20 alkyl, aromatic or aryl group, trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, halide (F, CI, Br, I), C1-C20 alkyl ether, benzyl halide, benzyl ether, aromatic or aryl ether, or optionally substituted versions of these, and R3, R4, R5, R6, and R7 are essentially unaffected by the reaction.<br>
Phosphorus trihalides may be of general formulas PX3, or XaP(Oaryl)b, or other suitable phosphorous containing compounds. In some embodiments, X may be a halide such as F, CI, Br or I; and a and b may be either 1 or 2 where a and b combined equals 3. In certain embodiments, the phosphorous trihalide may be phosphorous trichloride.<br>
Optionally substituted arylol may be of general formula (3):<br><br><br>
where R3, R4, R5, R5, and R7 may independently be any substituent including but not limited to hydrogen, C1-C20 alkyl, aromatic or aryl group, trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, halide (F, CI, Br, I), C1-C20 alkyl ether, benzyl halide, benzyl ether, aromatic or aryl ether, or optionally substituted versions of these, and R3, R4, R5, R6, and R7 are essentially unaffected by the reaction. In certain embodiments of the present invention, an optionally substituted arylol may be phenol or naphthol or an optionally substituted phenol or naphthol derivative.<br>
Various molar ratios of the reactants, the optionally substituted arylol and alkanol relative to the phosphorus trihalide, may be used. In embodiments of the invention, the molar ratio ranges from about 2 to about 4 molar equivalents for the optionally substituted arylol and from about 1 to about 3 molar equivalents for the alkanol and, in some embodiments, less than 2 molar equivalents. In some embodiments, the amount of catalyst may range from about 0 (i.e. no catalyst) to about 10 % by weight of phosphorus trihalide, and in others, the catalyst ranges from about 0 to about 5% by weight of phosphorus trihalide, and in still others, the catalyst may range from about 0 to about 0.4 % by weight of the phosphorous trihalide.<br>
The method of the present invention is not limited by how the reactants are combined or their order of addition. For example, phosphorous trihalide may be added to an optionally substituted arylol followed by an optionally substituted alkanol. A catalyst may optionally be added thereto. Alternatively, several reactants can be combined in a single step. For example, a mixture of an optionally substituted arylol and an optionally substituted alkanol may be added to a phosphorus trihalide. A catalyst may, optionally, be introduced at any stage in the reaction or may be added in combination with one or more of the other reactants.<br><br>
In some embodiments, one or more of the reactants and or catalysts may be added to the mixture via an addition funnel in an overhead method wherein the one or more reactants and/or catalysts are added onto the upper surface of the reaction mixture, and in others, one or more reactants and/or catalyst may be pumped into the reaction mixture thereby adding the constituent underneath the upper most surface of the reaction. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the addition of one or more reactants and/or catalysts to the reaction mixture underneath the reaction surface may provide longer contact time with the reaction mixture thereby allowing the chemical reaction to have more time to occur before the alkanol turns to vapor. Using this approach, a constant stream of alkanol (and, optionally, a catalyst) may be provided under the surface of the reaction product of an optionally substituted arylol and phosphorous trihalide. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the resulting increased contact time may improve reaction efficiency, conversion time and product yield. It may also allow for an increased feed rate of alkanol, thereby reducing the reaction time compared to the dropwise overhead addition method.<br>
No catalyst is necessary in the present invention. However, one or more catalysts, including, but not limited to, alkylating agents may be used. Other catalysts would be known to one skilled in the art. Catalysts may be added to the reaction mixture as an individual component, or in some embodiments of the present invention, the catalyst may be combined with one or more of the reactants prior to the addition of this combination to the reaction mixture.<br>
.In some embodiments, the catalyst may include, but are not limited to, alkyl chlorides, alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides in which the alkyl groups may carry one or more of a variety of substituents. In other embodiments, methyl iodide is included in the catalyst. Other known alkylating catalysts that may be used in combination with the present invention include, but are not limited to, sulfonic acid esters, sulfuric acid esters, and sultones. Strong<br><br>
acids such as, but not limited to, trifiuoromethane sulfonic acid, perfluorobutane sulfonic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid may also serve as catalysts in this reaction. In embodiments where a catalyst is added below 100 °C, an exotherm may be observed during heating, and in certain embodiments, the exotherm may be minor. In embodiments where the catalyst is added above 200 °C no exotherm may be observed.<br>
The temperature of the reaction may range from about 20 °C to about 260 °C. In some embodiments, the temperature at which the alkanol is added is about 150 °C, followed by cooling, adding the catalyst and heating again to about 250 °C.<br>
In a certain embodiment, methanol (along with the catalyst) may be added to the reaction product of phenol and phosphorous trichloride (PCI3) which may be heated to temperatures of from about 200 °C to 250 °C.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory in some embodiments of the present invention, the synthesis of diaryl alkylphosphonate may occur in two steps as illustrated in scheme (I):<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In a first step, an optionally substituted arylol may react with a phosphorous trihalide to form<br>
a triarylphosphite. The triarylphosphite may than react with an optionally substituted alkanol<br>
to form an alkyl-diaryl phosphite and an arylol.  The alkyl-diaryl phosphite may then be<br>
converted to diaryl alkylphosphonate. This may occur in the absence of a catalyst. In some<br>
embodiments, a catalyst may be added to facilitate the conversion of alkyl-diaryl phosphite to<br>
diaryl alkylphosphonate. In an alternative embodiment, phosphorous trihalide may react with<br><br>
an arylol to form diaryl halophosphite. Diaryl halophosphite may then be exposed to an alkanol (e.g. methanol) to form diaryl alkylphosphite, which may then be converted to diaryl alkylphosphonate.<br>
j Advantageously, reactants such as triaryl phosphites and trialkyl phosphites may not be required to form the diaryl alkyphosphonates, so there may be no need to isolate or purify intermediates such as triaryl phosphite. Additionally, by-products such as dialkyl arylphosphite, triarylphosphite, arylols, methoxyaryls, diaryl alkylphosphates, diaryl methylphosphite may be minimized or eliminated, so one or more separation steps in which by-products are removed or intermediates are isolated may not be necessary. In certain embodiments, triarylphosphite may be avoided as a by-product. The diaryl alkyphosphonates produced by the present invention may, therefore, be easier to purify or produce at a level of purity sufficient for subsequent reactions.<br>
A wide variety of diaromatic alkylphosphonates may be produced using the present invention, and these may be used as monomers in the synthesis of polymers such as but not limited to polyphosphonates and copolymers of carbonates and phosphonates. These polymers have exceptional fire resistance and are useful in a wide variety of applications encountered in everyday life.<br>
     Having generally described the invention, a more complete understanding thereof may be obtained by reference to the following examples that are provided for purposes of illustration only and do not limit the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 PCl3/Phenol/Methanol: 1.0/2.0/1.0<br>
All glassware was oven dried overnight at 110°C and assembled under a nitrogen purge. A 250 ml 3 neck round bottom flask was equipped with an overhead stirrer, addition funnel, thermometer, water condenser, and nitrogen by-pass. The flask was charged<br><br>
with 28.23 grams (0.30 moles) of phenol and heated, using an oil bath, to 150°C with stirring. The addition funnel was charged with 13.09 ml (0.15 moles) of phosphorous trichloride, and the phosphorous trichloride was added dropwise to the hot phenol over a 50 minute period. HC1 was evolved during the addition. When the addition was complete the temperature was increased to 180°C and stirred until HC1 evolution ceased (about one hour). The reaction mixture was subsequently cooled to 150°C, and 6.08 ml (0.15 moles) of methanol was added over a 10 minute period, HC1 evolved during the addition.  The mixture was then heated to 180°C for one hour and, subsequently, cooled to 20°C. 0.6 grams of methyl iodide was then added in one portion, and the mixture was heated to 250°C for one hour. There was a small exotherm at about 125°C. After stirring at 250°C for the hour, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
33.6 grams of crude diphenyl methylphosphonate was produced. Analysis of the product by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) showed that 55% of the product was diphenyl methylphosphonate while 35 % was phenol believed to be unreacted starting material. Based on this analysis (28.23g - 11.90g = 16.33 g = 0.174 mole), 0.174 mole of phenol were consumed in the reaction, and the theoretical yield of on diphenyl methylphosphonate, based on phenol consumption was 21,6g (0.174 mole = 2 x 248= 21.6g). Therefore, the yield of the reaction based on GC/ /MS analysis was 18.5g or 86 % of the theoretical yield.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 PCl3/Phenol/Methanol:1.0/3.5/1.3 (No Additional Catalyst)<br>
' Phenol (331g, 3.525 moles) was placed in a three neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a vacuum/gas port and an addition funnel and heated to 65-70 °C under nitrogen. Phosphorus trichloride (137.3g. 1.0 mole) was added to the heated phenol dropwise via the addition funnel over a three hour period under nitrogen. Following<br><br>
the complete addition of the phosphorous trichloride, the reaction mixture was stirred at 70°C for an additional hour. The temperature was then increased to 250 °C under nitrogen until all of the excess phenol had distilled off. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature under nitrogen. The next day the temperature was raised to 260 °C and methanol was slowly added. During the addition of methanol the temperature varied from 260 °C to 204 °C. After the methanol addition was complete, the reaction temperature was maintained between 210 °C to 215 °C and the reaction was stirred. An aliquot was removed and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) every hour until no trace of triphenylphosphite could be detected. After 1 hour, the GC analysis indicated that 2.031 % triphenylphosphite remained in the reaction mixture. After 2 hours, no triphenylphosphite was detected by GC.<br>
The results of the GC analyses on the crude reaction product are presented in the table below. The by-products include anisole (methoxybenzene) and dimethylphenylphosphite (DMPP(i)).<br>

 Additional experiments were performed to determine the effect of varying the ratio of reactants on the product composition and purity. The following examples (3-15) were prepared according to the following general reaction procedure. In a few examples there are slight differences in the reaction conditions as noted in the respective table entry.<br>
 Phosphorus trichloride was added dropwise to phenol heated to and maintained at 65-70°C over a 2 to 3 hour period with stirring. After the addition was complete, this temperature was maintained for an hour with stirring. The temperature was subsequently increased to about 250°C and excess phenol was distilled off. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature and left under a nitrogen atmosphere for about 12 to 16 hours.<br>
    The temperature was subsequently increased to 250°C and a methanol/methyl iodide solution or, in the examples where no catalyst was used, methanol alone was added to the stirring reaction mixture. The temperature varied from about 250°C to about 210°C during this addition. After the addition was complete, the temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained at about 210°C to about 250°C for an additional hour with stirring. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the crude reaction product was analyzed by GC-MS. The results are presented in the following tables.<br>

In summary, when the reaction temperature is only from 200 °C to 210 °C, somewhat less PCl3 is converted to product. Consequently, lower yields of the desired product (diaryl alkylphosphonate) and higher quantities of DMPP(i) are obtained. However, if the reaction temperature is from 210 °C to 250 °C, higher yields of high purity product and significantly less DMPP(i) are obtained. We have found that reaction temperatures above 250°C are less desirable because undesirable degradation of the product may occur.<br>
Preferable results were obtained in reactions with PCl3 to phenol molar ratios of 1.0/2.5-4.0, and PCl3 to methanol molar ratios of 1.0/1.2-1.3. Acceptable results were obtained with no catalyst or a relatively low concentration of catalyst (0.1 to about 1.0 mole percent relative to 1.0 mole of phosphorus trichloride).<br>
EXAMPLE 16 PCl3/Phenol/Methanol: 1.0/3.5/1.3 (Methanol added under the surface)<br>
  Phenol (330g, 3.5 moles) was placed in three neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a vacuum/gas port and an addition funnel and heated to 65-70 °C under nitrogen. To the heated phenol, phosphorus trichloride (137.3g. 1.0 mole) was added dropwise via the addition funnel over a three hour period. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was stirred at 70°C for an hour. The addition funnel was removed and replaced with a side arm consisting of a collection flask and a thermometer, and the temperature was increased to 250°C under nitrogen until all of the excess phenol had<br><br>
distilled off. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was then heated to 250 °C and a mixture of methanol (41.65g, 1.3 moles) and methyl iodide (0.70g, 0.005 moles) was slowly added underneath the surface of the reaction mixture using an electric micro-pump. Adding the methanol underneath the reaction surface provides for longer contact time with the reaction mixture allowing for the chemical reaction to have more time to occur before the methanol turns to vapor. This approach provides a constant stream of methanol with increased contact time for improved reaction efficiency, conversion time and product yield. It also allows for an increased feed rate of methanol that reduces the reaction time by one-half compared to the dropwise addition method. During this addition process, the reaction temperature was in the range of 210 to 250 °C. The crude yield of product was 342.1 g. Analysis of the crude product is provided in the table below.<br>

     The reaction resulted in 84.0% PCl3 conversion with a product (diphenylmethylphosphonate) yield of 92.86% and 7.14% DMPP(i). After 1 additional hour of reaction at 210 °C to 250 °C, only 1.518% of TPP(i) remained. After reacting for yet one additional hour, no detectable TPP(i) remained in the crude product.<br>
EXAMPLE 18 <br>
Comparative example: Commercially pure Triphenylphosphite as starting material and low catalyst concentration<br>
          Triphenylphosphite (310g, 1.0 moles) was placed in a three neck round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a nitrogen inlet and an addition funnel and heated in an oil bath to 260°C under nitrogen. A mixture of methanol (41.65g, 1.30 moles) and methyl iodide (0.35g, 0.0025 moles) was added using a microfeed pump. Initially a slight reflux was observed, but as the methanol concentration increased, refluxing was accompanied by a rapid drop in the reaction temperature to 235°C. At this point the addition was stopped to allow the temperature to return to 250-260°C. However, the temperature did not increase even after halting the methanol addition for over 30 minutes. Addition of methanol/catalyst solution was started again, and the intensity of the reflux increased notably. After the addition was complete, the reaction temperature had dropped to 135°C, and heating for an additional 3<br><br>
hours did not affect significant change. The reaction was allowed to cool and the crude product was analyzed by GC. The reaction resulted in the following mixture: triphenylphosphite 91.81%; phenol 8.19% and diphenyl methylphosphonate 0%.<br>
Example 18 shows that the desired product is not formed when commercially pure triphenylphosphite is used as the starting material and a low concentration of an alkylation catalyst is employed. In fact, the reaction results in the recovery of starting material indicating that little or no reaction occurred. This is in sharp contrast to the method described above and in Examples 1-17. Even in the examples where no catalyst is used, a high yield of the desired product (diphenylmethylphosphonate) is obtained. Additionally, the product is largely free of phosphorus contaminants.<br>
