Supporting Ring for the bedding of a Rotor on an open end Spinning<br>
Machine and Process for its manufacture<br>
Description: Technical Part<br>
The invention relates to a supporting ring made of a carrier ring and a bearing ring provided on the outer circumference of the carrier ring made of an elastic polymer material for the bedding of a rotor on an open end spinning machine. Supporting rings for the bedding of rotor on open end spinning machines are subjected to very stringent requirements as they are dynamically highly loaded / stressed and should also have a high temperature resistance.<br>
The energy requirement of spinning machine is also assuming more and more significance, because of its considerable influence on the operating cause of a spinning machine. Consequentially the endeavour is to maintain the wear and tear of supporting rings as minimum as possible inspite of enhanced RPM of the rotor, which fact equally concerns also the energy requirement.<br><br>
State-of-the-Art of Technology<br>
In patent document DE m 45 A1, the drive of a rotor of an open end spinning machine is shown over a pair of supporting rings as well as the principal structure/assembly of a supporting ring. The supporting rings have carrier rings on the outer circumference of which bearing rings made of polymer material are arranged. For improved heat dissipation, the bearing ring is equipped with a cooling groove in its central area.<br>
Another possible of heat dissipation is shown in Patent Document DE 100 036 C2. There, the supporting ring is made of minimum two part rings which contact each other axially, which limits the hollow space through partial axial interval/gap, using spacer, which extend up to the outer circumference of the bearing ring. At least one of these part rings has an axial cross-links ?? through which by rotation the supporting ring air is sucked in the hollow space, which is let out after flowing through the hollow room radially at the circumference. Through this measure, the thermal stress of the supporting ring and the rotor is reduced. Such a supporting ring however has relatively high manufacturing cost and there is the danger that dirt and lint get collected in the hollow room, leading to a noisy run of the supporting ring, and damage to the product and/or to the spinning machine.<br><br>
Illustration of the Invention<br>
The basic objective of the invention lies therein to avoid the disadvantages of the hitherto known supporting rings, and to bring out an improved supporting ring, which can be manufactured, cost-effectively and which allows a significantly highly RPM, than was possible so far.<br>
The solution to the set objective is achieved with the characteristics of the Claim 1 and 16. The sub-claims 2 to 15 represent advantages further design of the object of the invention.<br>
The new supporting ring exemplifies itself thereby that the carrier ring is provided with a side ring on at least one of the sides of its outer edge, which is arranged with a distance to the outer edge, connected to the carrier ring through the carrier, and on its outer circumference has similarly a supporting ring. Under this design form a supporting ring is obtained which has somewhat a one side hollowed carrier ring, which is connected with the carrier ring firmly through the carrier, which however has in the areas between the individual carriers slits, through which during the rotational movement of the supporting ring cool air is conveyed. The carrier can be accordingly designed for this purpose.<br>
In the simplest form, the outer edge of the carrier ring is designed in the form of a crown and is located on this outer edge of the side ring. In this process, the side ring together with the carrier ring and the carriers builds a uniform component made from identical material. This part can be manufactured for instance in pressure die casting process, injection moulding or extrusion.<br><br>
The carriers themselves are arranged in identical angular intervals. In so doing, three carriers are minimum used. In the simplest form, the carriers are made of the outer edge of the carrier ring with the spacer connecting the side ring. It is also possible to design the carrier in the form of stub supports, which emerge from the carrier ring itself or even from the bottom side of the outer edge of the carrier ring. The ideal design form however visualizes that the carriers have the form of wheel blades which extends up to the hub of the carrier ring. Independent of the fact whether the carriers are designed as spacer, stub supports or wheel blades, their surface must be so designed and provided with curves that air in the desired direction is conveyed through the slits. In this process, not only the supporting ring itself cooled from inside, but also components which lie in the vicinity such as the rotor, roller bearings, breaking shoes, and such other items. The flow effect leads to lower temperatures in the total aggregate and provide prevention against a over-heating, and thus extends the life time of the machine components. Depending upon the chosen design form of the carrier, the air flow can be deflected from the space below the side ring of the supporting ring radially towards the outer, or vice-versa. Moreover, in the event of a pair-wise arrangement of the supporting rings, normal flow or counter flow of the air can be generated.<br>
Both the carrier ring as well as the side ring are equipped with supporting ring which per say can be jointed with the carrier ring or side ring in an already known manner. Such a joint can be either a positive clamping or a non-positive clamping. Moreover, the supporting rings on their radial air surfaces can be provided with profiles such as groove. It is advantageous if the carrier ring is made of plastic and on its hub a bush made of metal is inserted. This has an improved seating on the bearing neck as a consequence. Generally it should be pointed out however that the carrier ring including the side ring can also be<br><br>
manufactured completely from the plastic or metal. The advantages pf the new supporting ring are in the good heat dissipation and also especially a good cleaning possibility, because all hollow spaces are easily accessible from outside, and visible.<br>
The manufacture of the supporting ring can be as follows:<br>
A carrier ring on at least one of its dies of its outer edge is produced with an axially protruding crown, which is connected through the carrier with the carrier ring, where the carrier ring and the crown on their outer circumferences are provided with a supporting ring. Following hereon, the crown is separated from the carrier ring, in that the transition area between the carrier ring and the crown is cut across such that an open ring groove is created between the carriers to the space underneath the crown. The crown then creates the side ring. In the case of a supporting ring provided with two side rings, a corresponding groove is provided on both the sides of the carrier rings. The groove form is maintained in the carrier sections.<br>
Short description of the Drawings<br>
Based on the design examples illustrated in the drawing, the invention is explained as follows:<br>
The figures show:<br>
Figure 1        Supporting ring in section from a carrier ring with a side ring jointed<br>
through a spacer in perspective view Figure 2        A supporting ring in section with stub support Figure 3        A supporting ring in section in which the side ring is fastened at the<br>
carrier ring through the wheel blades<br><br>
Design of the Invention<br>
In the following examples, the supporting rings 1 are shown each in section and in perspective view. They consist of a carrier ring 2 with bearing ring 3 made of a polymer material and the side ring 7 which has similarly a bearing ring 10. Carrier ring 2 and side ring 7 are a uniform component, manufactured under injection moulding process. They are connected to each other through carrier 9, designed as spacers 4. For the supporting ring 3 and 10, polyurethane is chosen with a hardness of more than 90° shore A. Both the supporting rings 3 and 10 are distanced through the ring groove 20. The ring groove 20 can extend till up to the spacer 4 or even into it. Between the outer edge 6 of the carrier ring 2 and the side ring 7 as well as the individual spacer 4, slit type openings 21 are available which opens the space 22, positioned radially below the side ring 7, radially towards the outer. As a result of this, during the rotation movement of the supporting ring 1, air from space 22 is conveyed upwards. The air flow can be predetermined through a corresponding form of the spacer 4 in its quantity and direction. The spacers 4 themselves are arranged in identical angular intervals 11.<br>
In figure 2, the supporting ring 1 is from the carrier ring 2 which on its outer circumference is provided with the supporting ring 3, made of an elastic polymer material. The supporting ring 3 is jointed on the carrier ring 2 chemically and is anchored to a head shaped ring groove 14. On its right side, shown in the illustration in the figure, of the outer edge 6 the carrier ring 2 has the side ring 7. This side ring 7 is arranged with a distance 8 to the outer edge 6 of the carrier ring 2. The side ring 7 on the carrier ring 2 is held over the carrier 9 designed as stub supports 15. The carrier ring 2, side ring 7 and the carrier 9 are manufactured uniformly from the same material. The side ring 7 on its outer circumference is similarly provided with a support ring 10, which has identical<br><br>
form as the supporting ring 3 of the carrier ring 2. The carriers 9 are arranged in e'qual angular intervals 11. The openings 21 are produced through introduction of the snap ring groove 20.<br>
In figure 3, a design form of the supporting ring 1 is shown in which the carriers 9 have the structure of the wheel blades 16. Here the carriers 9 join the hub 13 of the carrier ring 2 directly. The hub 13 is axially extended. Otherwise, the design form as per figure 3 corresponds to the design form as per figure 2. These supporting ring 2 and 10 are even here connected with the carrier ring 2 in a non-positive manner. The carrier ring 2 is made of a plastic and has in its hub 13 a bush 17 made of metal.<br>
Advantageous manufacturing of the supporting ring is thereby achieved that the carrier ring 2 on at least one of its sides is provided with an axially protruding crown, which is connected to the carrier ring 2 through the carrier 9. Carrier ring 2 and crown are provided on the outer circumference with a supporting ring. Connected to it a snap ring groove 20 is included from the outside between the crown and the carrier ring 2, which separates the crown from the carrier ring 2 in sections lying between the carriers 9. The groove 20 is extended or continued so long till the free space 22 below the side ring 7 is reached, or, in case of spokes type carriers 9 the free s[ace 23 between the spokes and/or the wheel blade 16 is reached. In this manner, the slit type openings 21 between the carriers 9 are created through which the air, depending upon the shape of the carrier 9, is diverted from the inner to the outer and/or vice-versa.<br><br><br><br>
