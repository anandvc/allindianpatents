BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Patent document 1 proposes, as a light-blocking material<br>
used in window materials and the like, a black-pigmentcontaining<br>
light-blocking film, which includes carbon black,<br>
titanium black, and other inorganic pigments having lightabsorbing<br>
characteristics that range from the visible light<br>
region to the near infrared region; and aniline black and<br>
other organic pigments having strong light-absorbing<br>
characteristics for light solely in the visible light region.<br>
Patent document 2 proposes a half-mirror light-blocking<br>
material on which aluminum or another metal has been deposited.<br>
[0003]<br>
In patent document 3, a heat-blocking glass is proposed<br>
in which a composite tungsten oxide film is disposed as a<br>
first layer on a transparent glass substrate, with the film<br>
containing at least one type of metal ion selected from the<br>
group consisting of Group Ilia, Group IVa, Group Vb, Group VIb,<br>
and Group Vllb in the periodic table of the elements; a<br>
transparent dielectric film as a second layer is disposed on<br>
the first layer; a composite tungsten oxide film is disposed<br>
as a third layer on the second layer, with the film containing<br>
at least one type of metal ion selected from the group<br>
consisting of Group Ilia, Group IVa, Group Vb, Group VIb, and<br>
Group Vllb in the periodic table of the elements; and the<br>
index of refraction of the transparent dielectric film of the<br>
second layer is less than the index of refraction of the<br>
composite tungsten oxide film of the first and third layers.<br>
The heat-blocking glass can therefore be advantageously used<br>
in locations that require high visible-light transmittance and<br>
good heat-blocking performance.<br>
[0004]<br>
In patent document 4, a heat-blocking glass is proposed<br>
in which a first dielectric film is disposed as a first layer<br>
on a transparent glass substrate, a tungsten oxide film as<br>
second layer is disposed on the first layer, and a second<br>
dielectric film as a third layer is disposed on the second<br>
layer, using the same method as that in patent document 3.<br>
[0005]<br>
In patent document 5, a heat-blocking glass is proposed<br>
in which a composite tungsten oxide containing the same metal<br>
element as that in patent document 3 is disposed as a first<br>
layer on a transparent glass substrate, and a transparent<br>
dielectric film as second layer is disposed on the first layer,<br>
using the same method as that in patent document 3.<br>
[0006]<br>
In patent document 6, a sunlight-controlling glass sheet<br>
having sunlight-shielding characteristics is proposed in which<br>
a metal oxide film is formed by CVD or spraying, and the film<br>
is thermally decomposed at about 250°C. The metal oxide film<br>
has one more components selected from the group consisting of<br>
tungsten trioxide (WO3), molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), niobium<br>
pentoxide (Nb2O5), tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5), vanadium<br>
pentoxide (V2O5), and vanadium dioxide (VO2), and contains<br>
hydrogen, lithium, sodium, potassium, or other additive<br>
materials.<br>
10007]<br>
In Patent document 7, a solar light-varying/dimming,<br>
heat-blocking material is proposed that can undergo rapid<br>
coloration/decoloration reactions when exposed to the solar<br>
light and that, when colored, has an absorption peak at 1250<br>
nra in the near-infrared region, resulting in the ability to<br>
block solar light in the near-infrared region. This material<br>
uses a tungsten oxide obtained by hydrolysis of tungstic acid.<br>
An organic polymer having a specific structure and referred to<br>
as polyvinylpyrrolldone is added to the tungsten oxide. When<br>
the material is exposed to the solar light, UV rays in the<br>
solar light are absorbed by the tungsten oxide, and excited<br>
electrons and holes are generated. A small dose of UV<br>
irradiation can markedly increase the amount of pentavalent<br>
tungsten that is generated, which accelerates the coloring<br>
reaction, and the material shields light as the color density<br>
of increases. The pentavalent tungsten is thereby extremely<br>
rapidly oxidized to hexavalent tungsten and the discoloring<br>
reaction is accelerated.<br>
[0008]<br>
In patent document 8, the inventors have proposed a way<br>
to obtain a powder composed of tungsten trloxide, a hydrate of<br>
tungsten trioxide, or a mixture of tungsten trioxide and a<br>
hydrate of tungsten trioxide by dissolving tungsten<br>
hexachloride in an alcohol and directly evaporating the<br>
solvent, or by heating and refluxing the mixture and then<br>
evaporating the solvent, and thereafter heating [the residue]<br>
at 100°C to 500°C. The inventors have also proposed that<br>
nanoparticles of such a tungsten oxide can be used to obtain<br>
an electrochromic element, and that a multilayered laminate<br>
can be formed. When protons are Introduced into the film, the<br>
optical characteristics of the film can be changed.<br>
[0009]<br>
In recent years, the need for transparent electrodes has<br>
Increased in association with the development of various types<br>
of display elements. Since numerous free electrons are<br>
retained in the material of transparent electrodes and the<br>
electrical conductivity is high, ITO (Indium-Tin-Oxide)<br>
obtained by doping indium oxide with several molar percent of<br>
tin is mainly used (see patent document 9). In2O3/ which is an<br>
ITO matrix, is an oxide semiconductor, and carrier electrons<br>
are supplied from oxygen defects contained in the crystals.<br>
The substance is therefore a transparent electroconductive<br>
substance. It is believed that when Sn is added to In203, the<br>
amount of carrier electrons is greatly increased and high<br>
electrical conductivity is exhibited. The transparent<br>
electroconductive film related to the particle dispersion of<br>
the present invention is currently used in the transparent<br>
electrodes of display elements, plasma display elements, solar<br>
cells, and the like, as well as in infrared-absorbing and<br>
reflecting films, defogglng films, electromagnetism-shielding<br>
films, and other films.<br>
[0010]<br>
Recent display apparatuses are in a downward trend in<br>
relation to costs. There is need to improve the performance<br>
of transparent electrodes, particularly to reduce the sheet<br>
resistance and improve the visible-light transmittance in<br>
order to obtain a high quality display element that is devoid<br>
of display defects, and it is extremely important to reduce<br>
the cost of the transparent electrode itself. Improvements<br>
are being made in ITO deposition technology, sputtering<br>
targets, and other aspects. Therefore, improvements are being<br>
made in the physical properties of transparent<br>
electroconductive films, and progress is being made in<br>
reducing costs. However, there is a limit to reducing the<br>
costs of ITO, and it has become difficult to respond to the<br>
recent wider range of needs.<br>
[0011]<br>
On the other hand, known as a particle-dispersed<br>
transparent electroconductive film is a fine particle film<br>
(see patent document 10) in which an aqueous solution (A)<br>
containing silver bromide and palladium salt, and an aqueous<br>
solution (B) containing citric acid ions and ferrous ions are<br>
mixed in an atmosphere essentially devoid of oxygen to<br>
precipitate Ag-Pd fine particles, and a coating solution<br>
containing the Ag-Pd fine particles in water and/or an organic<br>
solvent are applied to a base material. Also known is a<br>
transparent electroconductive film (see patent document 11) in<br>
which secondary particles having an average secondary particle<br>
diameter of 120 to 200 nm are formed from ITO particles having<br>
an average primary particle diameter of 10 to 60 nm, and an<br>
ink composition in which the secondary particles are dispersed<br>
is used to form the film.<br>
[0012]<br>
In patent document 12, a method is proposed for producing<br>
various tungsten bronzes expressed by the formula MXWO3 (where<br>
M is an alkali metal, an alkaline-earth metal, a rare earth<br>
element, or another metal element, and 0 
uses an ammonium meta tungstate and various water-soluble<br>
metal salts as starting materials and involves heating the dry<br>
solids obtained from a mixed aqueous solution of the starting<br>
materials at about 300 to 700°C, and supplying a gaseous<br>
hydrogen containing an inert gas (added amount: about 50 vol%<br>
or greater) or water vapor (added amount 15 vol% or less) to<br>
the solid material. Also proposed is a method in which the<br>
same operation is performed on the carrier to manufacture<br>
various compound materials coated with tungsten bronze.<br>
However, the tungsten bronzes are intended as solid materials<br>
to be used in the electrode catalyst material of fuel cells<br>
and the like, and no consideration is given to transparency<br>
and electrical conductivity.<br>
[0013]<br>
On the other hand, transparent electroconductlve films<br>
are used in the transparent electrodes of liquid crystal<br>
display elements, plasma display elements, solar cells, and<br>
the like, as well as in Infrared-absorbing and reflecting<br>
films, defogglng films, electromagnetism-shielding films, and<br>
other films.<br>
[0014]<br>
Liquid crystal display apparatuses in particular are<br>
actively being adopted in recent years in personal computers,<br>
word processors, and other OA equipment, leading to greater<br>
demand for transparent electrodes. Transparent electrodes for<br>
liquid crystal display elements have numerous conduction<br>
electrons (free electrons) in the material, electrical<br>
conductivity is high, and patterning by etching is relatively<br>
simple. Therefore, ITO (Indium-Tin-Oxide) obtained by doping<br>
indium oxide with several molar percent of tin is mainly used<br>
(see patent documents 13 and 14). In2O3, which is an ITO<br>
matrix, is an oxide semiconductor, and carrier electrons are<br>
supplied from oxygen defects contained in the crystals. It is<br>
believed that when Sn is added to In2O3/ the amount of carrier<br>
electrons is greatly increased and high electrical<br>
conductivity is exhibited.<br>
[0015]<br>
In patent document 14, a high-transmittance transparent<br>
electroconductive film is proposed in which an In oxide is<br>
used as the main component, Ge is added, and the visible-light<br>
transmlttance is 90% or greater.<br>
[0016]<br>
In patent document 16, a transparent electroconductive<br>
film is proposed that exhibits good resistivity and greater<br>
visible-light transmlttance than ITO. The film is composed of<br>
a composite oxide which has a defect-fluorite crystal<br>
structure and whose three main constituent elements are indium<br>
(In), antimony (Sb), and oxygen (O). The film is a<br>
transparent electroconductive film expressed by the general<br>
formula In3Sbi-xO7.fi (which satisfies the ranges -0.2 £ X £ 0.2<br>
and -0.5 a; b * 0.5) and doped, in a ratio of 0.1 to 20 at%,<br>
with at least one element selected from the high-valence metal<br>
elements Sn. Si, Ge, Ti, Zr. Pb, Cr, Mo, W, Te, V, Nb, Ta, Bi,<br>
As, and Ce, and from the halogen elements F, Br, and I. The<br>
film is subjected to reduction annealing to generate oxygen<br>
holes, and carrier ions are thereby injected.<br>

[DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[PRIOR-ART PROBLEMS]<br>
[0018]<br>
The black pigment described in patent document 1 has<br>
considerable light absorbing characteristics in the visible<br>
region, and when the pigment is used in a window material or<br>
the like, the window material tends to have dark colors, and<br>
•*<br>
therefore the application is limited.<br>
A window material or the like to which the metaldeposited<br>
film described in patent document 2 has been applied<br>
has a half-mirror appearance, and such a half-mirror tends to<br>
reflect brightly, which is a problem from the standpoint of<br>
aesthetics.<br>
[0019]<br>
The heat-blocking materials described in patent documents<br>
3 to 5 are mainly manufactured using sputtering, vapor<br>
deposition, ion-plating, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and<br>
other dry vacuum deposition methods. For this reason, large<br>
manufacturing apparatuses are required and costs are increased.<br>
Also, the base materials used for these heat-blocking<br>
materials are exposed to high-temperature plasma and require<br>
heating after film deposition. Thus, when films and other<br>
resin materials are used as base materials, facilities and<br>
film deposition conditions must be separately considered.<br>
[0020]<br>
In the case of the sunlight-controlling glass sheet<br>
described in patent document 6, the starting materials are<br>
formed as a coating on glass by the joint use of thermal<br>
decomposition and CVD or spraying, but since the starting<br>
material precursors are costly, thermally decompose at high<br>
temperature, and have other drawbacks, the film deposition<br>
conditions must be separately considered when a film or<br>
another resin is used as the base material.<br>
[0021]<br>
The solar light-varying/dimming, heat-blocking material<br>
and electrochromic element proposed in patent documents 7 and<br>
8 have a complicated film structure because the color tone of<br>
the material is varied using UV rays or electrical potential<br>
n<br>
difference, and application to fields in which color tone<br>
changes are not desired is difficult.<br>
[0022]<br>
The ITO electroconductive film described in patent<br>
document 9 is an expensive film because iridium is used, and<br>
there is a commercial demand for an inexpensive transparent<br>
electroconductive thin film.<br>
The noble metal particles described in patent document 10,<br>
and the ITO particles described in patent document 11 can be<br>
deposited by coating, and a bulky apparatus is therefore not<br>
required. Deposition costs can be reduced, but the particles<br>
themselves are expensive and lack wide applicability.<br>
[0023]<br>
The present invention was contrived in order to solve<br>
such problems, and an object of this invention is to provide<br>
an infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion that<br>
sufficiently transmits light in the visible region, has lightshielding<br>
characteristics in the near-infrared region, and<br>
does not require the use of a bulky manufacturing apparatus<br>
when the film is formed on the base material; to provide an<br>
infrared-shielding body manufactured using the infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion; to provide a method for<br>
manufacturing infrared-shielding nanoparticles used in the<br>
infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion; and to provide<br>
Infrared-shielding nanoparticles manufactured using the method<br>
for manufacturing the infrared-shielding nanoparticles.<br>
Another object is to provide an infrared-shielding body of<br>
high visible transmittance using a transparent and<br>
electroconductive body.<br>
[0024]<br>
The ITO electroconductive film described in patent<br>
documents 9 and 12 are expensive films because iridium is used,<br>
and there is a commercial demand for an inexpensive<br>
transparent electroconductlve thin film.<br>
The noble metal particles described in patent document 10<br>
and the ITO particles described in patent document 11 can be<br>
deposited by coating, and a bulky apparatus is therefore not<br>
required. Deposition costs can be reduced, but the particles<br>
themselves are expensive and lack wide applicability.<br>
[0025]<br>
The present invention was contrived in view of the abovedescribed<br>
situation, and an object of the present Invention is<br>
to provide an Inexpensive visible light transmitting particledispersed<br>
electrical conductor that has excellent electrical<br>
conductivity and visible light-transmission characteristics.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
electroconductive particles used in the visible light<br>
transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor described<br>
above.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a visible-light-transmitting electroconductive article that<br>
uses an inexpensive visible light transmitting particledispersed<br>
electrical conductor having excellent electrical<br>
conductivity and visible light-transmission characteristics.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an electroconductive particle manufacturing method<br>
wherein a simple technique can be used to manufacture<br>
electroconductive particles that are used to obtain an<br>
inexpensive visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor that has excellent electrical<br>
conductivity and visible light-transmission characteristics.<br>
[0026]<br>
The ITO electroconductive film described in patent<br>
documents 12 and 13, and the electroconductive film described<br>
in patent documents 14 and 15, in which In oxide is the<br>
primary component, have excellent visible-light transmittance<br>
and film surface resistance (sheet resistance), but these are<br>
expensive films because iridium is used, and there is a<br>
commercial demand for an inexpensive transparent<br>
electroconductive film.<br>
[0027]<br>
The present invention was contrived in view of the abovedescribed<br>
situation, and an object of this invention is to<br>
provide an inexpensive transparent electroconductive film that<br>
has excellent electrical conductivity and visible lighttransmission<br>
characteristics.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
transparent electroconductive film manufacturing method for<br>
manufacturing in a simple manner an inexpensive transparent<br>

conductivity and visible light-transmission characteristics.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a transparent electroconductive article that uses an<br>

[MEANS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEMS]<br>
[0028]<br>
Tungsten trioxide is a wide-bandgap oxide, absorbs very<br>
little visible light, does not contain free electrons<br>
(conduction electrons) in the structure, and therefore does<br>
not exhibit electrical conductivity. Tungsten trioxide having<br>
somewhat reduced oxygen, and so-called tungsten bronze<br>
obtained by adding Na or other electropositive elements to<br>
tungsten trioxide. are known to generate free electrons and to<br>
have electrical conductivity. It is acknowledged that<br>
tungsten trioxide having somewhat reduced oxygen, and tungsten<br>
bronze obtained by adding Na or other electropositive elements<br>
to tungsten trioxide, absorb visible light. Therefore, these<br>
products are not used as particle-dispersed transparent<br>
electroconductive materials.<br>
[0029]<br>
The inventors discovered that it is possible to form a<br>
visible-light-transmitting transparent electroconductive film<br>
because the above-described tungsten trioxide having somewhat<br>
reduced oxygen, and tungsten bronze obtained by adding Na or<br>
other electropositive elements to tungsten trioxide, have<br>
strong absorbency of light having a wavelength of about 800 nm<br>
or greater, but the light absorption of these compounds in the<br>
wavelength region of about 380 nm to 780 nm (visible light<br>
region), which can be perceived by humans, is weak in<br>
comparison with the former (light having a wavelength of about<br>
800 nm or greater).<br>
[0030]<br>
The inventors, based on the wide bandgap of tungsten<br>
trioxide, used the backbone structure of tungsten trioxide,<br>
reduced the oxygen content of the tungsten trioxide or added<br>
positive ions to generate conduction electrons (free<br>
electrons), controlled the particle diameter and shape of the<br>
tungsten oxide particles and the composite tungsten oxide<br>
particles, manufactured particles that had electrical<br>
conductivity while allowing light in the visible region to<br>
pass, and used the manufactured particles to obtain a visible<br>
light transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor.<br>

electroconductive particles.<br>
[0047]<br>
Tungsten trioxide is a wide band gap material that<br>
transmits visible light, but the material is not<br>
electroconductive. The inventors used the backbone structure<br>
of tungsten trioxide, reduced the oxygen content of the<br>
tungsten trioxide or added positive ions to generate<br>
conduction electrons (free electrons), and manufactured a<br>
transparent electroconductive film that retains electrical<br>

Similar to tungsten oxide, oxides of element A have the same<br>
structure as so-called tungsten bronze, which contains<br>
electropositive elements in the crystal. In view of this fact,<br>
the inventors arrived at the idea of combining element A and<br>
tungsten oxide, or employing an electroconductive film based<br>
on a so-called tungsten bronze structure in which an element A<br>
is used, and manufactured electroconductive films.<br>

[0065] A material containing free electrons is commonly known to<br>
reflect/absorb electromagnetic waves in the vicinity of the<br>
region of solar light having a wavelength of 200 nm 2,600 nm<br>
produced by plasma vibrations. It is known that when a powder<br>
of such a material is formed into nanoparticles that are<br>
smaller than the wavelength of light, geometrical scattering<br>
in the visible light region (wavelengths from 380 nm to 780 nm)<br>
is reduced and transparency in the visible light region can be<br>
obtained. In the present specification, "transparency" is<br>
used in the sense that scattering of visible light is low and<br>
transmission characteristics are high.<br>
[0066]<br>
On the other hand, so-called tungsten bronze, which is<br>
obtained by adding Na or another electropositive element to<br>
tungsten trioxide, is an electroconductive material and is<br>

having the same properties as those described above. Similar<br>
to tungsten oxide, oxides of element A are known to have a socalled<br>
tungsten bronze structure that contains electropositive<br>
elements in the crystal. An analysis of a single crystal or<br>
the like of these materials suggests that electroconductive<br>
characteristics are present and that free electrons respond to<br>
visible light.<br>
The inventors arrived at the present invention upon<br>
discovering that it is possible to manufacture an effective<br>
visible-light-transmitting near-infrared-shielding body and a<br>
visible-light-transmitting electroconductive infraredshielding<br>
body by increasing the amount of free electrons<br>
contained in composite oxide nanoparticles that contain<br>
tungsten or an element A.<br>
[0067]<br>
The Inventors have also discovered that a film obtained<br>
by dispersing composite oxide nanoparticles in a suitable<br>
medium can more effectively absorb solar light, particularly<br>
in a near-infrared region, and can at the same time transmit<br>
visible light without the use light interference, and that<br>
these properties are superior to those of a film fabricated by<br>
spraying or a film fabricated by sputtering, vapor deposition,<br>
or ion-plating, as well as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or<br>
another dry vacuum deposition method. These findings<br>
ultimately led to the present invention. The inventors also<br>
discovered that this dispersion itself exhibits electrical<br>
conductivity when these nanoparticles make contact with each<br>
other in the dispersion, because the composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles are electroconductive.<br>

[Effects of the Invention]<br>
 [0081]<br>
The visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor of the first to tenth aspects has<br>
excellent transmittance of light in the visible region and<br>
excellent electrical conductivity because the electrical<br>
conductor has electroconductive particles in which the oxygen<br>
content of tungsten trioxide is reduced to cause conduction<br>
electrons to be generated, and/or electroconductive particles<br>
that include a composite tungsten oxide that is made to<br>
generate conduction electrons by adding positive ions to<br>
tungsten trioxide.<br>
The electroconductive particles of the eleventh aspect<br>
have excellent electrical conductivity and excellent<br>
transmittance of visible light, and can therefore be<br>
advantageously applied to the visible light transmitting<br>
particle-dispersed electrical conductor of the first to tenth<br>
aspects.<br>
The visible-light-transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electroconductive article of the twelfth aspect has excellent<br>
electrical conductivity and excellent transmittance of visible<br>
light.<br>
In accordance with the method for manufacturing<br>
electroconductive particles of the thirteenth to sixteenth<br>
aspects, the electroconductive particles can be manufactured<br>
at low cost by using a simple method because the particles can<br>
be obtained by heat treating a tungsten compound, which is a<br>
starting material of the electroconductive particles, in an<br>
atmosphere of a reducing gas and/or inert gas.<br>
[0082]<br>
In accordance with the seventeenth to twenty-seventh<br>
aspects, the backbone structure of a tungsten trioxide that<br>
transmits light in the visible range but does not have<br>
electrical conductivity, or a composite oxide of tungsten and<br>
an element A is used, and since conduction electrons are<br>
generated in the tungsten trioxide or composite oxide of<br>
tungsten and an element A, an inexpensive transparent<br>
electroconductive film that has excellent electrical<br>
conductivity and transmlttance to visible light can be<br>
obtained. The film has a tungsten oxide in which the oxygen<br>
content is reduced or a composite tungsten oxide in which<br>
conduction electrons are generated by adding positive ions.<br>
Also, a transparent electroconductive article that uses the<br>
transparent electroconductive film can be provided with<br>
electrical conductivity via the conduction electrons, and can<br>
transmit light in the visible range at the same time.<br>
[0083]<br>
In accordance with the twenty-eighth to thirty-second<br>
aspect, the transparent electroconductive film can be obtained<br>
by a simple method in which a starting tungsten material<br>
solution is applied to a base material and then heat treated<br>
in an atmosphere of a reducing gas and/or inert gas.<br>
Therefore, the method is useful because the film can be easily<br>
manufactured using inexpensive materials in comparison with a<br>
conventional indium compound.<br>
[0084]<br>
The infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion of the<br>
thirty-third to forty-first aspects is an infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion obtained by dispersing infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticles in a medium, wherein the infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticles include composite oxide nanoparticles<br>
expressed by the general formula MEAGW(i-G)Oj (where M is one or<br>
more elements selected from H, He, alkali metals, alkalineearth<br>
metals, rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co,<br>
Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn. Cd, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge,<br>
Sn, Pb. Sb, B, F, P, S, Se, Br, Te, Ti, Nb. V, Mo, Ta, Re, Be,<br>
Hf, Os, Bi, and I; A is one or more elements selected from Mo,<br>
Nb, Ta, Mn, V, Re, Pt, Pd, and Ti; W is tungsten; O is oxygen;<br>
0 
electrons in these composite oxides is increased, and this<br>
film can more effectively absorb and shield solar light,<br>
particularly in a near-infrared region, and can simultaneously<br>
retain transmlttance in the visible light region in comparison<br>
with a film fabricated by spraying, or a film fabricated by<br>
sputtering, vapor deposition, or ion-plating, as well as<br>
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or another dry method vacuum<br>
deposition method.<br>
[0085]<br>
Since these infrared-shielding nanoparticles have<br>
electrical conductivity, the dispersion itself can function as<br>
an electroconductive material by causing the particles to make<br>
contact with each other in the infrared-shielding nanoparticle<br>
dispersion. The dispersion can also be used as an infraredshielding<br>
body that transmits visible-light and has electrical<br>
conductivity.<br>
[0086]<br>
The infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion has<br>
industrial utility in that the body can be manufactured at low<br>
cost without the use of a vacuum apparatus or other bulky<br>
equipment.<br>

[0089]<br>
The visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor of the present Invention has a tungsten<br>
oxide expressed by the general formula WyOz (where W is<br>
tungsten, O is oxygen, and 2.2 s z/y £ 2.999), and/or a<br>
composite tungsten oxide expressed by the general formula<br>
MxWyOz (where M is one or more elements selected from H, He,<br>
alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare earth elements, Mg,<br>
Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh. Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd,<br>
Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge, Sn. Pb, Sb, B, F, P, S, Se, Br, Te, Ti,<br>
Nb, V, Mo, Ta, Re, Be, Hf, Os, Bi, and I; W is tungsten; O is<br>
oxygen; 0.001 s: x/y s 1.1; and 2.2 £ z/y s 3.0), wherein the<br>
particle diameter is 1 run or greater, the particles have<br>
visible light transmitting characteristics, and the pressed<br>
powder resistance of the particles measured under a pressure<br>
of 9.8 MPa is 1.0 Q-cm or less. The resulting<br>
electroconductive particles are aggregated to bring the<br>
particles into contact with each other and to form an<br>
electroconductive body.<br>
[0090]<br>
When the electroconductive particles Include acicular<br>
crystals or are entirely composed of acicular crystals, the<br>
ratio of the major and minor axes (major axis/minor axis) in<br>
the acicular crystals is 5 or greater, and the length of the<br>
major axis ranges from 5 nm or greater to 10,000 [im. When the<br>
electroconductive particles include tabular crystals or are<br>
entirely composed of tabular crystals, the thickness of the<br>
tabular crystals ranges from 1 nm or greater to 100 nm or less,<br>
the maximum diagonal length of the tabular surfaces in the<br>
tabular crystals ranges from 5 nm or greater to 500 \m or less,<br>
and the ratio of the maximum diagonal length and the thickness<br>
of the tabular crystals (maximum diagonal length/thickness) is<br>
5 or greater.<br>
The visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor and the electroconductive particles used<br>
in the electrical conductor are described in detail below.<br>
[0091]<br>
1. Electroconductive particles<br>
Tungsten trioxlde (WO3) generally has excellent visiblelight<br>
transmittance, but since effective conduction electrons<br>
are not present, tungsten trioxlde is not an effective<br>
electroconductive material. It is known that free electrons<br>
can be generated in W03 by reducing the ratio of oxygen to<br>
tungsten in the WO3 to less than 3. The inventors discovered<br>
that, in specific areas of the tungsten/oxygen composition<br>
range, there is a uniquely effective range in which the<br>
composition acts as an electroconductive material.<br>
[0092]<br>
In the tungsten oxide described above, the<br>
tungsten/oxygen composition range is one in which the<br>
composition ratio of oxygen to tungsten is less than 3, and<br>
the range 2.2 £ z/y s: 2.999 Is preferred when the<br>
electroconductive particles have the formula WyOz. When the<br>
value of z/y is 2.2 or greater, formation of an unwanted WO2<br>
crystal phase in the electroconductive material can be avoided<br>
and the material can be provided with chemical stability, and<br>
can therefore be used as an effective electroconductive<br>
material. When the value of z/y is 2.999 or less, the<br>
required amount of free electrons can be generated to produce<br>
an electroconductive material.<br>
[0093]<br>
In the above-described composite tungsten oxide,<br>
conduction electrons (free electrons) are generated in the W03<br>
and an effective electroconductive material is obtained by<br>
adding an element M (where M is one or more elements selected<br>
from H, He, alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare earth<br>
elements, Mg, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu,<br>
Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, B, F, P, S,<br>
Se, Br, Te, Ti, Nb. V, Mo, Ta, Re, Be, Hf, Os, Bi, and I) to<br>
tungsten trloxlde (WO3).<br>
[0094]<br>
In other words, the electroconductive material must be a<br>
composite tungsten oxide expressed by the general formula<br>
MxWyOz (where M is one or more elements selected from H, He,<br>
alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare earth elements, Mg,<br>
Zr, Cr, Mn. Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd,<br>
Al, Ga, In, Tl. Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, B, F, P, S, Se, Br, Te, Ti,<br>
Nb, V, Mo, Ta, Re, Be, Hf, Os, Bi, and I; W is tungsten; O is<br>
oxygen; 0.001 s x/y £ 1.1; and 2.2 s z/y £ 3.0). From the<br>
standpoint of stability, the element M is preferably one or<br>
more elements selected from alkali metals, alkaline-earth<br>
metals, rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh,<br>
Ir, Ni, Pd. Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si. Ge, Sn,<br>
Pb, Sb, B. F, P, S, Se, Br, Te, Ti, Nb, V, Mo, Ta, Re, Be, Hf,<br>
Os, Bi, and I.<br>
[0095]<br>
In relation to the oxygen content and the added amount of<br>
the element M, the material is preferably one in which the<br>
ranges 0.001 * x/y * 1.1, and 2.2s; z/y £ 3.0 are satisfied<br>
when the electroconductive particles have the formula MxWyOz<br>
(where M is as described above, W is tungsten, and O is<br>
oxygen). As the addition amount of the element M is Increased,<br>
the supply amount of conduction electrons tends to Increase as<br>
well. This is due to the fact that, as noted above, MxWyOz<br>
has the crystal structure of so-called tungsten bronze. In<br>
stoichiometric terms, the addition amount of the element M per<br>
mole of tungsten, for example, is preferably no more than<br>
about 0.33 mol in the case of a hexagonal tungsten bronze<br>
crystal structure, preferably no more than about 0.5 mol in<br>
the case of a tetragonal tungsten bronze crystal structure,<br>
and preferably no more than about 1 mol in the case of a cubic<br>
tungsten bronze crystal structure. However, since the abovedescribed<br>
crystal structures can occur in various modes, the<br>
addition amount of the element M is not necessarily limited to<br>
the addition amounts described above.<br>
[0096]<br>
Next, the value of z/y, which is used to control the<br>
oxygen content, in the composite tungsten oxide expressed by<br>
MxWyOz, is described below. In addition to the fact that<br>
conduction electrons (free electrons) are produced in the same<br>
range (2.2 2; z/y a 2.999) as the tungsten oxide WyOz described<br>
above, the value of z/y preferably satisfies the range 2.2 s<br>
z/y £ 3.0, and more preferably satisfies the range 2.72 s z/y<br>
£ 3.0, because conduction electrons are supplied by the<br>
addition of the above-described element M even when z/y = 3.0.<br>
[0097]<br>
Also, the electroconductive particles of the present<br>
embodiment preferably have a particle size of 1 nm or greater.<br>
The electroconductive particles absorb a considerable amount<br>
of light in the vicinity of the wavelength 1,000 nm, and the<br>
transmission color tone is often between a blue' color and a<br>
green color. The size of the particles can be selected based<br>
on the intended use. First, when the particles are to be used<br>
in applications in which transparency is to be retained, the<br>
particle diameter is preferably 800 nra or less. This is due<br>
to the fact that particles having a diameter of less than 800<br>
nm do not perfectly shield light by scattering the light,<br>
visibility is retained in the visible light region, and<br>
transparency can be retained at the same time with good<br>
efficiency. In the particular case that importance in placed<br>
on transparency in the visible light region, the scattering<br>
produced by the particles is preferably given further<br>
consideration.<br>
[0098]<br>
When importance is placed on reducing scattering produced<br>
by the particles, the particle diameter is 200 nm or less, and<br>
more preferably 100 nm or less. The reason for this is that<br>
if the particle diameter is too small, the scattering of light<br>
in the visible light wavelength region of 380 nm to 780 nm is<br>
reduced due to geometrical scattering or Mie scattering.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to avoid a situation in which the<br>
film becomes similar to clouded glass and clear transparency<br>
cannot be obtained. In other words, when the particle<br>
diameter is 200 nm or less, the geometrical scattering or Mie<br>
scattering is reduced and a Rayleigh scattering region is<br>
formed. This is due to the fact that the scattered light is<br>
reduced in an inverse proportion to the particle diameter by a<br>
factor of 6 in this Rayleigh scattering region, and the<br>
scattering is reduced as the particles are made smaller and<br>
the transparency is enhanced. When the particle diameter is<br>
100 nm or less, the amount of scattered light is very low, and<br>
such a situation is not preferred. From the standpoint of<br>
avoiding the scattering of light, the particle diameter is<br>
preferably small. Also, if the particle diameter is 1 nm or<br>
greater, the particles are easy to handle and manufacture on a<br>
commercial scale.<br>
[0099]<br>
To improve the electrical conductivity of the<br>
electroconductive particles, the shape of the<br>
electroconductive particles used in the present invention is<br>
preferably acicular or tabular. This is because the<br>
electrical conductivity of the electroconductive body is<br>
reduced due to the contact resistance between the particles,<br>
the number of contact points between the particles can<br>
therefore be reduced as long as the particle dispersion is<br>
composed of acicular or tabular electroconductive particles,<br>
and an electroconductive body that has higher electrical<br>
conductivity can be obtained.<br>
Therefore, when the electroconductive particles used in<br>
the present invention include tabular crystals or are entirely<br>
composed of tabular crystals, the thickness of the tabular<br>
crystal particles ranges from 1 nm or greater to 100 JA or less,<br>
the maximum diagonal length of the tabular surfaces in the<br>
tabular crystals ranges from 5 ran or greater to 500 yon or less,<br>
and the ratio of the maximum diagonal length and the thickness<br>
of the tabular crystals in the tabular plane is 5 or greater.<br>
[0100]<br>
When measured under a pressure of 9.8 MPa, the pressed<br>
powder resistance of the electroconductive particles used in<br>
the present invention and obtained in this manner is 1.0 Q-cm<br>
or less. If the pressed powder resistance is 1.0 Q-cm or less,<br>
an effective electrical conductor film can be obtained and the<br>
range of application can be expanded, resulting in an<br>
advantageous situation.<br>
[0101]<br>
The tungsten oxide particles constituting the<br>
electroconductive particles of the present embodiment<br>
preferably has a Magneli phase having a composition ratio<br>
expressed by the general formula WyOz (where W is tungsten, O<br>
is oxygen, 2.45 £ z/y a 2.999). A Magneli phase is chemically<br>
stable and is advantageous as an electroconductive material.<br>
[0102]<br>
Here, the electrical conduction mechanism of the<br>
transparent electroconductive film of the present invention is<br>
briefly described with reference to the drawings. FIGS. 1A to<br>
ID are schematic drawings showing the crystal structure of<br>
tungsten oxide and a composite tungsten oxide, wherein FIG. 1A<br>
is the crystal structure of Wi8O49 ((010) projection); FIG. IB<br>
is the crystal structure of cubic tungsten bronze ((010)<br>
projection); FIG. 1C is the crystal structure of tetragonal<br>
tungsten bronze ((001) projection); and FIG. ID is the crystal<br>
structure of hexagonal tungsten bronze ((001) projection).<br>
The structure of tungsten trioxide has an octahedral<br>
structure composed of WOs, and may be regarded as a single unit.<br>
W atoms are positioned in the octahedral structure, and oxygen<br>
is positioned at the apexes of the octahedral structure. In<br>
all octahedral structures, the apexes are shared with an<br>
adjacent octahedral structure. In this case, conduction<br>
electrons are not present in the structure. On the other hand,<br>
the Magneli phase expressed by WO2.9 or another composition<br>
ratio is a structure in which the octahedral structure of WO6<br>
shares edges and apexes in an orderly fashion. Wi8O49 (WO2.?2)<br>
having the structure shown in FIG. 1(A) has an orderly<br>
structure in which the octahedral structure of WO6 and the<br>
decahedral structure of WOio as a single unit share edges and<br>
apexes. Tungsten oxide having such a structure is believed to<br>
be provided with electrical conductivity via the contribution<br>
of electrons released by oxygen as conduction electrons.<br>
The above-described structure of tungsten trioxide<br>
produces conduction electrons in a completely uniform,<br>
nonuniform, or amorphous structure, and electroconductive<br>
characteristics can be obtained.<br>
[0103]<br>
The composite tungsten oxide expressed by the formula<br>
MxWyOz preferably has an amorphous structure or a cubic,<br>
tetragonal, or hexagonal tungsten bronze structure.<br>
[0104]<br>
With this composite tungsten oxide, the element M is<br>
positioned in gaps resulting from the sharing of apexes by an<br>
octahedral structure, as shown in FIGS. IB to ID. It is<br>
believed that conduction electrons are generated by adding<br>
such elements M. The structure of a composite tungsten oxide<br>
is typically cubic, tetragonal, or hexagonal, and a structural<br>
example of each is shown in FIGS. IB, 1C, and ID. These<br>
composite tungsten oxides have a structure-based upper limit<br>
to the amount of addition element, and the maximum addition<br>
amount of the element M per mole of W is as follows: 1 mol in<br>
the case of a cubic system, about 0.5 mol in the case of a<br>
tetragonal system (this varies depending on the addition<br>
amount, but 0.5 mol can be easily produced on a commercial<br>
scale), and 0.33 mol in the case of a hexagonal system.<br>
However, these structures are difficult to define in a simple<br>
manner, and the range of maximum addition amounts of the<br>
addition element M described above is an example that<br>
particularly shows a basic preferred range. This invention is<br>
not limited to this range. Several types of structures may be<br>
adopted in the crystal structure by compositing materials.<br>
The above-described structure is a representative structure,<br>
and no limitation is imposed by the structure.<br>
 [0105]<br>
In a composite tungsten oxide, the optical<br>
characteristics vary depending on the above-described<br>
structure. Hexagonal systems in particular tend to have a<br>
light absorption region based on conduction electrons in the<br>
near-infrared region having longer wavelengths, and absorption<br>
in the visible light region is also low. Next, tetragonal<br>
systems and cubic systems tend to absorb light having shorter<br>
wavelengths by means of conduction electrons, and absorption<br>
in the visible light region is also high. Accordingly, a<br>
composite tungsten oxide, which has a hexagonal structure, is<br>
preferred for the above-stated reasons as the transparent<br>
electroconductive film capable of transmitting more visible<br>
light.<br>
[0106]<br>
It is commonly known that a hexagonal system is formed<br>
when an element M having a large ion radius is added to a<br>
composite tungsten oxide. Specifically, when any of the<br>
elements Cs, K, Rb, Tl, Ba, In, Li, Ca, Sr, Fe, and Sn are<br>
added, a hexagonal system is readily formed, and such a<br>
situation is preferred. However, as long as the added element<br>
M is present in the gaps of the hexagonal structure, as shown<br>
in FIG. ID, for example, a WO6 unit can be formed using an<br>
element other than those noted above, and no limitation is<br>
imposed by these elements. Also, a composite tungsten oxide<br>
having these hexagonal structures may be a uniform crystal<br>
structure or an irregular crystal structure.<br>
In this case, it is possible to use both methods, i.e.,<br>
to limit the above-described oxygen content and to add an<br>
element M for generating conduction electrons to the tungsten<br>
trioxide (WO3). Also, when the transparent electroconductive<br>
film described above is used as an infrared-shielding film, a<br>
material that is suitable for the desired purpose, e.g., an<br>
element M, may be selected at an appropriate time.<br>
[0107]<br>
When electroconductive particles of a composite tungsten<br>
oxide having a hexagonal structure are formed in a uniform<br>
structure, the addition amount of the element M is preferably<br>
0.1 or more and 0.4 or less, and is more preferably 0.33.<br>
This is because the value theoretically calculated from the<br>
crystal structure is 0.33, and desirable electroconductive<br>
characteristics can be obtained using similar addition amounts.<br>
[0108]<br>
The shape of the electroconductive particles of the<br>
present embodiment may be one or more shapes selected from<br>
granular, acicular, or tabular shapes. The tungsten oxide<br>
particles and composite tungsten oxide particles constituting<br>
the electroconductive particles can be easily formed into<br>
acicular shapes (e.g., refer to FIGS. 4A and 4B showing SEM<br>
Images of the acicular crystals of Wi8O49 (W2.72) of Example 1<br>
described later), and better electroconductive characteristics<br>
can be obtained when a dispersed body is formed. The abovedescribed<br>
tungsten bronze can form tabular shapes (e.g., refer<br>
to FIGS. 6A and 6B showing SEM images of the tabular crystals<br>
of hexagonal tungsten bronze Cso.3sWO3 (W2.72) of Example 4<br>
described later), and is effective for obtaining excellent<br>
electroconductive characteristics when a dispersed body is<br>
formed.<br>
[0109]<br>
The electroconductive particles of the present invention<br>
do not require the use of expensive starting materials such as<br>
In and noble metals in comparison with the case in which ITO<br>
particles and noble metal particles are used. Therefore, the<br>
visible light transmitting particle-dispersed electrical<br>
conductor described below can be obtained at low cost.<br>
[0110]<br>
2. Method for manufacturing electroconductive particles<br>
The electroconductive particles composed of a tungsten<br>
oxide expressed by the general formula WyOz (where W is<br>
tungsten, O is oxygen, and 2.2 a z/y s: 2.999), and/or the<br>
electroconductive particles composed of a composite tungsten<br>
oxide expressed by the general formula MxWyOz (where M is one<br>
or more elements selected from H, He, alkali metals, alkalineearth<br>
metals, rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co,<br>
Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge,<br>
Sn, Pb, Sb, B, F, P, S, Se, Br, Te, Ti, Nb, V, Mo, Ta, Re, Be,<br>
Hf, Os, Bi, and I; W is tungsten; O is oxygen; 0.001 ^ x/y s;<br>
1.1; and 2.2 * z/y s; 3.0) are obtained by heat treating a<br>
tungsten compound (hereinafter referred to as "tungsten<br>
compound starting material"), which is a starting material of<br>
the electroconductive particles, in an atmosphere of an inert<br>
gas and/or reducing gas. The electroconductive particles can<br>
be obtained at low cost by using a simple method.<br>
[0111]<br>
Preferably used as the tungsten oxide starting material<br>
of the above-described electroconductive particles is one or<br>
more compounds selected from tungsten trioxide; tungsten<br>
dioxide; tungsten oxide hydrate; tungsten hexachloride;<br>
ammonium tungstate; tungsten oxide; tungsten oxide hydrate<br>
obtained by dissolving tungsten hexachloride in an alcohol and<br>
then drying the solution; tungsten oxide hydrate obtained by<br>
dissolving tungsten hexachloride in an alcohol, adding water<br>
to the solution to form a precipitate, and drying the<br>
precipitate; a tungsten compound obtained by drying an aqueous<br>
solution of ammonium tungstate; and a metal tungsten powder.<br>
[0112]<br>
When the tungsten oxide electroconductive particles are<br>
produced, it is further preferable from the standpoint of<br>
facilitating the production step to use tungsten trioxide,<br>
tungsten oxide hydrate powder, tungsten oxide, or an aqueous<br>
solution of ammonium tungstate. When the composite tungsten<br>
oxide electroconductive particles are produced. It Is<br>
preferable to use an aqueous solution of ammonium tungstate or<br>
an aqueous solution of tungsten hexachloride from the<br>
standpoint of producing a uniform mixture of the elements when<br>
the tungsten compound starting materials are in a solution.<br>
When the starting materials are not in a liquid state,<br>
tungsten oxide or the like is preferably used.<br>
[0113]<br>
The tungsten compound starting materials are heat treated<br>
at a temperature ranging from 100° C or greater to 850° C or<br>
less in an atmosphere of a reducing gas, and subsequently heat<br>
treated as required at a temperature ranging from 550° C or<br>
greater to 1,200'C or less in an atmosphere of an inert gas,<br>
whereby the tungsten oxide particles and composite tungsten<br>
oxide particles having the above-described diameters (from 1<br>
nm or greater to 10,000 \m or less) can be obtained.<br>
[0114]<br>
The heat treatment conditions for manufacturing tungsten<br>
oxide particles are described below.<br>
The heat treatment conditions in a reducing atmosphere<br>
preferably Include, first, heat treating the tungsten compound<br>
starting material in a reducing atmosphere of from 100°C or<br>
greater to 850°C or less. A temperature of 100" C or greater<br>
is preferred because the reductive reaction progresses more<br>
adequately. A temperature of 850° C or less is preferred<br>
because reduction does not progress excessively. The reducing<br>
gas is not particularly limited, but H2 is preferred. When H2<br>
is used as the reducing gas, H2 as a component of the reducing<br>
atmosphere is preferably present in a volume ratio of 0.1% or<br>
greater and, more preferably, in a volume ratio of 2% or<br>
greater. Reduction can progress with good efficiency when H2 is<br>
present in a volume ratio of 0.1% or greater.<br>
[0115]<br>
Next, the resulting particles may be further subjected to<br>
heat treatment as required at a temperature ranging from 550°C<br>
or greater to 1,200°C or less in an atmosphere of an inert gas<br>
in order to improve the crystallinity and to remove adsorbed<br>
reducing gas. The heat treatment in the atmosphere of an<br>
inert gas is preferably carried out at 550°C or greater.<br>
Tungsten compound starting materials that are heat treated at<br>
550°C or greater exhibit sufficient electrical conductivity.<br>
Ar, N2, or another inert gas may be used.<br>
A tungsten oxide expressed by the general formula WyOz<br>
that satisfies the range 2.2 £ z/y * 2.999 and has a Magneli<br>
phase can be obtained.<br>
[0116]<br>
The heat treatment conditions for manufacturing composite<br>
tungsten oxide particles are as follows.<br>
A powder is manufactured by mixing compounds or simple<br>
substances composed of the above-described tungsten compound<br>
starting material and the element M (where M is one or more<br>
elements selected from H, He, alkali metals, alkaline-earth<br>
metals, rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh,<br>
Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge, Sn,<br>
Pb, Sb, B, F, P, S, Se, Br, Te, Ti, Nb, V, Mo, Ta, Re, Be, Hf,<br>
Os, Bi, and I); or a powder is obtained by mixing a solution<br>
or liquid dispersion of the tungsten compound starting<br>
material and a solution or liquid dispersion of the compound<br>
containing the element M and drying the solution. The mixture<br>
ratio of the element M and the tungsten oxide starting<br>
material is one in which the composition ratio of element M<br>
and tungsten in the composite tungsten oxide is a prescribed<br>
value that satisfies the range 0.001 s x/y s; 1 when the<br>
composite tungsten oxide has the formula MxWyOz.<br>
[0117]<br>
Here, the starting materials are preferably mixed in a<br>
solution in order to manufacture a tungsten compound starting<br>
material in which the components are uniformly mixed at the<br>
molecular level. A tungsten compound starting material that<br>
has an element M is preferably soluble in water, an organic<br>
solvent, or another solvent. Examples include M-containing<br>
tungstates, chlorides, nitrates, sulfates, oxalates, oxides,<br>
carbonates, and hydroxides, but no limitation is imposed<br>
thereby, and a tungsten compound capable of forming a solution<br>
is preferred. Since evaporating a solvent from a dissolved<br>
state is complicated from the commercial standpoint, the<br>
mixing and reaction may be carried out in a solid state. In<br>
this case, the material that is used is preferably a carbonate<br>
or a hydroxide of an element M and tungstic acid because the<br>
emission of toxic gases or the like from the starting material<br>
compounds is not preferred from the commercial standpoint.<br>
[0118]<br>
The heat treatment conditions are the same as the heating<br>
conditions for manufacturing the tungsten oxide particles<br>
described above. The following heat treatment conditions can<br>
be proposed to manufacture a composite tungsten oxide having<br>
good crystallinity. However, the heat treatment conditions<br>
differ depending on the starting material and the type of<br>
desired compound, and are not limited by the following methods,<br>
When manufacturing a composite tungsten oxide having good<br>
crystallinity, the heat treatment conditions are preferably<br>
high, and the reduction temperature differs depending on the<br>
starting material and the temperature of H2 during reduction,<br>
but 600°C to 850°C is preferred. The heat treatment<br>
temperature maintained in the subsequent inert gas environment<br>
is preferably 700°C to 1,200°C.<br>
[0119]<br>
3. Visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor<br>
The electroconductive particles of the present embodiment<br>
can be provided with visible-light transmittance by<br>
controlling the composition, grain size, and shape of the<br>
electroconductive particles as described above, and a visible<br>
light transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor can<br>
be formed at low cost in comparison with the case in which ITO<br>
particles and noble metal particles are used by bringing<br>
together and causing contact between a plurality of<br>
electroconductive particles to form an electrical conductor.<br>
A method for applying these electroconductive particles<br>
entails suitably dispersing the electroconductive particles in<br>
a medium by using any of the dispersing methods described<br>
below, and forming an electrical conductor on a desired base<br>
material. This method entails dispersing electroconductive<br>
particles baked at a high temperature in advance in a base<br>
material, or binding the particles to the base material<br>
surface using a binder, whereby application can be made to<br>
resins and other base materials that have a low heatresistance<br>
temperature. An electrical conductor can be<br>
manufactured at low cost without the use of a vacuum apparatus<br>
or other bulky equipment.<br>
[0120]<br>
The visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor of the present embodiment can be formed<br>
into the shape of a film, and the electroconductive particles<br>
pre-baked at a high temperature can be bonded and formed on<br>
the surface of a base material by using a binder. No<br>
limitation is imposed by this binder, but a transparent resin<br>
or a transparent dielectric is preferred.<br>
[0121]<br>
 (a) Method for dispersing electroconductive particles in<br>
a medium and forming a film on the surface of a base material<br>
A visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor film in which electroconductive particles<br>
are dispersed in a medium can be formed by suitably dispersing<br>
the electroconductive particles of the present embodiment in a<br>
medium, adding a resin medium as required, applying the<br>
resulting dispersion to the surface of a base material, and<br>
vaporizing the solvent to cure the resin by a prescribed<br>
method. The coating method is not particularly limited as<br>
long as the resin containing the electroconductive particles<br>
can be uniformly applied to the surface of a base material.<br>
Examples include bar coating, gravure coating, spray coating,<br>
and dip coating.<br>
[0122]<br>
The medium may be selected from, e.g., a UV-curable resin,<br>
a thermosetting resin, an electron beam-curable resin, a room<br>
temperature-curable resin, a thermoplastic resin, or another<br>
resin in accordance with the purpose. Specific examples of<br>
the resin Include polyethylene resin, polyvinyl chloride resin,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride resin, polyvinyl alcohol resin,<br>
polystyrene resin, polypropylene resin, ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer, polyester resin, polyethylene terephthalate resin,<br>
fluorine resin, polycarbonate resin, acrylic resin, and<br>
polyvinyl butyral resin. A binder that uses a metal alkoxide<br>
may also be used as the medium. Typical examples of metal<br>
alkoxides include those of Si, Ti, Al, and Zr. Binders that<br>
use these metal alkoxides may be subjected to hydrolysis and<br>
then heated to form an oxide film.<br>
[0123]<br>
A visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor film in which electroconductive particles<br>
are dispersed on a base material surface can be formed by<br>
dispersing the electroconductive particles of the present<br>
embodiment in a suitable solvent, applying the resulting<br>
dispersion to the surface of a base material, and vaporizing<br>
the solvent. However, since the electrical conductor film by<br>
itself has poor strength, a solution containing a resin or the<br>
like is preferably applied to the electrical conductor film,<br>
and the solvent is vaporized to form a protective film. The<br>
coating method is not particularly limited as long as the<br>
resin containing the electroconductive particles can be<br>
uniformly applied to the surface of a base material. Examples<br>
include bar coating, gravure coating, spray coating, and dip<br>
coating.<br>
[0124]<br>
The method for dispersing the electroconductive particles<br>
is not particularly limited, and ultrasonic irradiation, a<br>
bead mill, a sand mill, or the like can be used, for example.<br>
Additives may be added to obtain a uniform dispersed body, and<br>
the pH may be adjusted.<br>
[0125]<br>
The shape of the base material is not limited, and the<br>
base material may be formed in the shape of a film or board as<br>
desired. PET, acryl, urethane, polycarbonate, polyethylene,<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, vinyl chloride, fluorine<br>
resin, or the like may be used as the transparent base<br>
material in accordance with the intended purpose. Apart from<br>
resins, glass may be used.<br>
[0126]<br>
(b) Method for dispersing particles in a base material<br>
Another method that may be used for applying the<br>
electroconductive particles of the present embodiment is to<br>
disperse the electroconductive particles in a base material.<br>
In order to disperse the electroconductive particles in a base<br>
material, the electroconductive particles may be allowed to<br>
permeate from the surface of the base material, or the<br>
temperature of the electroconductive particles may be<br>
increased above the melting temperature of the base material,<br>
and the particles may then be melted and mixed with resin.<br>
The resulting resin containing the electroconductive particles<br>
may be molded into a film or a board by a prescribed method<br>
and used as an electroconductive material.<br>
[0127]<br>
An example of a method for dispersing the<br>
electroconductive particles in a PET resin entails mixing PET<br>
resin and a liquid dispersion of the electroconductive<br>
particles, vaporizing the dispersion solvent, thereafter<br>
heating the material to about 300°C, which is the melting point<br>
of PET resin, to melt and mix the PET resin, and then cooling<br>
the material to produce a PET resin in which the<br>
electroconductive particles are dispersed.<br>
[0128]<br>
(4) Particle shape<br>
The electroconductive particles of the tungsten oxide and<br>
the electroconductive particles of the composite tungsten<br>
oxide may be formed into acicular crystals such as those shown<br>
in FIG. 4 by using a suitable heat treatment. Acicular<br>
crystals have the effect of improving the electrical<br>
conductivity of the visible light transmitting particledispersed<br>
electrical conductor film in comparison with very<br>
fine-grained particles. The reason for this is that the<br>
resistance of the film is degraded in comparison with a bulk<br>
configuration due to the contact resistance between the<br>
particles, but when acicular crystals are used in the visible<br>
light transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor<br>
film, each of the acicular crystals becomes a current-carrying<br>
path. Therefore the contact resistance is low in comparison<br>
with cases in which the very fine-grained particles are linked<br>
to each other, and electron transport can be carried out with<br>
good efficiency. Accordingly, electrical conductivity is<br>
improved.<br>
[0129]<br>
The electroconductive particles of hexagonal tungsten<br>
bronze, which are electroconductive particles of a composite<br>
tungsten oxide, can be formed into the tabular crystals shown<br>
in FIG. 6. Tabular crystals are particularly easy to form<br>
when the element M is added in an amount that is greater than<br>
0.33. The resulting tabular crystals readily improve<br>
electrical conductivity because the surface resistance per<br>
unit surface area can be reduced in comparison with dispersed<br>
nan opar tides.<br>
[0130]<br>
However, the acicular and tabular crystals described<br>
above have about the same size, light is therefore easily<br>
scattered, and transparency may be reduced. When transparency<br>
is to be improved, the acicular and tabular crystals must be<br>
pulverized into very small shapes, and the particle shapes are<br>
preferably changed in accordance with the intended purpose.<br>
The pulverizing method may be an ordinary pulverizing method.<br>
[0131]<br>
5. Optical characteristics of the visible light<br>
transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor<br>
The optical characteristics of the visible light<br>
transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor of the<br>
present embodiment were measured using a spectrophotometer (U-<br>
4000 manufactured by Hitachi Ltd.), and the visible-light<br>
transmittance was calculated (based on JIS R3106).<br>
[0132]<br>
FIG. 2 shows, as an example of the transmittance<br>
measurement results, a transmission profile of a visible light<br>
transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor formed<br>
from WiaO49 electroconductive particles. FIG. 2 is a graph in<br>
which the wavelength of the transmitted light is plotted along<br>
the horizontal axis, and the transmittance (%) of the light is<br>
plotted along the vertical axis. It is apparent from FIG. 2<br>
that a visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor formed from the Wi8O49 electroconductive<br>
particles transmits light having a wavelength of 380 nm to 780<br>
run, which is the visible light region (e.g., the transmittance<br>
of visible light having a wavelength of 500 nm is 60%).<br>
[0133]<br>
FIG. 3 shows a transmission profile of Cs0.33WO3 as an<br>
example of a transmission profile of a visible light<br>
transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor formed<br>
from electroconductive particles composed of hexagonal<br>
composite tungsten oxide. FIG. 3 is a graph in which the<br>
wavelength of the transmitted light is plotted along the<br>
horizontal axis, and the transmittance (%) of the light is<br>
plotted along the vertical axis. It is apparent from FIG. 3<br>
that a visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor composed of Cs0.33WO3 transmits light<br>
having a wavelength of 380 nm to 780 nra, which is the visible<br>
light region, and transmittance in the visible light region is<br>
excellent.<br>
 [0134]<br>
The visible light transmitting particle-dispersed<br>
electrical conductor has industrial utility in that a visible<br>
light transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor can<br>
be formed at low cost by coating or the like without the use<br>
of sputtering, vapor deposition, or ion-plating, as well as<br>
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or another dry method vacuum<br>
deposition method that uses a vacuum apparatus or other bulky<br>
equipment.<br>
[0135]<br>
[2] Transparent electroconductive film and method for<br>
manufacturing the same, transparent electroconductlve article,<br>
and Infrared-shielding article<br>
[0136]<br>
The best mode for carrying out the present invention is<br>
described below.<br>
Generally, tungsten trioxide (WO3) does not have effective<br>
conduction electrons and therefore has no electrical<br>
conductivity, although visible light is transmitted. The<br>
inventors discovered that by using the backbone structure of<br>
tungsten trioxide, a tungsten oxide in which conduction<br>
electrons are generated in the WO3 by reducing the ratio of<br>
oxygen to tungsten to less than 3, or a composite tungsten<br>
oxide in which conduction electrons are generated by adding<br>
positive ions, can be provided with electrical conductivity by<br>
way of these conduction electrons while simultaneously<br>
transmitting visible light.<br>
[0137]<br>
Elements A described above can be used as elements having<br>
the same properties as the above-described tungsten. Similar<br>
to tungsten oxide, oxides of these elements A have a so-called<br>
tungsten bronze structure composed of electropositive elements<br>
in the crystals. As a result, the inventors also discovered<br>
that even when some tungsten sites are substituted with an<br>
element A and are composited with tungsten oxide, or an<br>
electroconductive film is formed having the so-called tungsten<br>
bronze structure by using an element A in place of tungsten,<br>
the film can be provided with electrical conductivity by way<br>
of these conduction electrons while simultaneously<br>
transmitting visible light.<br>
[0138]<br>
The inventors also discovered that the transparent<br>
electroconductive film can be obtained using a simple method<br>
in which a solution composed of a tungsten compound, which is<br>
a starting material of the subsequently described tungsten<br>
oxide and/or composite tungsten oxide, or a solution composed<br>
of an element A compound is used as the starting material<br>
solution, the starting material solution is applied to a base<br>
material, and the base material coated with the starting<br>
material solution is heat treated in an atmosphere of a<br>
reducing gas and/or inert gas to manufacture the transparent<br>
electroconductive film.<br>
[0139]<br>
1-(A). Tungsten oxide and composite tungsten oxide<br>
The transparent electroconductive film of the present<br>
embodiment includes a tungsten oxide expressed by the general<br>
formula WyOz (where W is tungsten, O is oxygen, and 2.2 £ z/y<br>
£ 2.999), and/or a composite tungsten oxide expressed by the<br>
general formula MxWyOz (where M is one or more elements<br>
selected from H, He, alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals,<br>
rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni,<br>
Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb,<br>
B, F, P, S, Se, Br, Te, Ti, Nb, V, Mo, Ta, Re, Be, Hf, Os, Bi,<br>
and I; W is tungsten; O is oxygen; 0.001 £ x/y s 1, and 2.2s:<br>
z/y s 3.0), wherein the maximum transmittance in the region of<br>
400 run or greater to 780 nm or less ranges from 10% or greater<br>
to less than 92%, and the surface resistance of the film is<br>
1.0 x 1010 Q/square or less.<br>
[0140]<br>
In the tungsten oxide expressed by the general formula<br>
WyOz (where W is tungsten, O is oxygen, and 2.2 * z/y s 2.999),<br>
the tungsten/oxygen composition range is one in which the<br>
composition ratio of oxygen to tungsten is less than 3, and<br>
the range 2.2 s z/y s 2.999 is preferred when the transparent<br>
electroconductive film have the formula WyOz. When the value<br>
of z/y is 2.2 or greater, formation of an unwanted WO2 crystal<br>
phase in the film can be avoided and the material can be<br>
provided with chemical stability, and can therefore be used as<br>
an effective transparent electroconductive film. When the<br>
value of z/y is 2.999 or less, the required amount of free<br>
electrons can be generated to produce a transparent<br>
electroconductive film.<br>
[0141]<br>
In the transparent electroconductive film of the present<br>
Invention, the maximum transmittance measured in the<br>
wavelength region of 400 run or greater to 780 nm or less<br>
ranges from 10% or greater to less than 92%. When the maximum<br>
transmittance is 10% or greater, the range of application in<br>
visible light-transmitting applications is broad. When the<br>
maximum transmittance is 92% or less, the technical aspects of<br>
manufacturing are facilitated. The optical measurements were<br>
carried out based on JIS R3106 (light source: A light) to<br>
calculate the visible-light transmittance.<br>
[0142]<br>
The surface resistance of the transparent<br>
electroconductive film of the present invention is 1.0 x 1010<br>
Q/sguare or less. When the surface resistance is as described<br>
above, the electroconductive film can be advantageously used<br>
in a broad range of applications. The surface resistance was<br>
measured using a surface resistance measuring device (Loresta<br>
MP MCP-T350) manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical.<br>
[0143]<br>
In the transparent electroconductive film of the present<br>
embodiment, the tungsten oxide preferably has a Magneli phase<br>
having a composition ratio expressed by the general formula<br>
WyOz (where W is tungsten, O is oxygen, and 2.45 s z/y s<br>
2.999).<br>
[0144]<br>
Here, the electrical conduction mechanism of the<br>
transparent electroconductive film of the present invention is<br>
briefly described.<br>
Tungsten trioxide has an octahedral structure composed of<br>
WO6, and may be regarded as a single unit. W atoms are<br>
positioned in the octahedral structure, and oxygen is<br>
positioned at the apexes of the octahedral structure. In all<br>
octahedral structures, the apexes are shared with an adjacent<br>
octahedral structure. In this case, conduction electrons are<br>
not present in the structure. On the other hand, the Magneli<br>
phase expressed by WO2.9 or another composition ratio is a<br>
structure in which the octahedral structure of WO6 shares edges<br>
and apexes in an orderly fashion. Wi8O49 (WO2.?2) having the<br>
structure shown in FIG. 1(A) has an orderly structure in which<br>
the octahedral structure of WO6 and the decahedral structure of<br>
WOio as a single unit share edges and apexes. Tungsten oxide<br>
having such a structure is believed to be provided with<br>
electrical conductivity via the contribution of electrons<br>
released by oxygen as conduction electrons.<br>
[0145]<br>
The above-described structure of tungsten trioxide<br>
produces conduction electrons in a completely uniform,<br>
nonuniform, or amorphous structure, and electroconductive<br>
characteristics can be obtained.<br>
[0146]<br>
Conduction electrons are generated in the WO3 and<br>
electrical conductivity is obtained by adding an element M<br>
(where M is one or more elements selected from H, He, alkali<br>
metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr,<br>
Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga,<br>
In, Tl, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, B, F, P, S, Se, Br, Te, Ti, Nb, V,<br>
Mo, Ta, Re, Be, Hf, Os, Bi, and I) to the tungsten trioxide<br>
(WO3). In other words, the ranges are preferably 0.001 £ x/y £<br>
1, and 2.2 z z/y a 3.0 in a composite tungsten oxide expressed<br>
by the general formula MxWyOz (where M is one or more elements<br>
selected from H, He, alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals,<br>
rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni,<br>
Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb,<br>
B, F, P. S. Se, Br, Te, Ti, Nb, V, Mo, Ta, Re, Be, Hf, Os, Bi,<br>
and I; W is tungsten; 0 is oxygen; 0.001 2 x/y s 1, and 2.2 £<br>
z/y a 3.0).<br>
[0147]<br>
When the above-noted ranges are satisfied, good<br>
electrical conductivity is obtained by the generation of<br>
conduction electrons. In the particular case that the ratio<br>
(z/y) of O to W is 2.2 or greater, application as a lighttransmitting<br>
film can be facilitated without increasing light<br>
absorption in the visible light region, and such a situation<br>
is preferred.<br>
[0148]<br>
The composite tungsten oxide expressed by the formula<br>
MxWyOz preferably has an amorphous structure, or a cubic,<br>
tetragonal, or hexagonal tungsten bronze structure.<br>
The term "cubic structure" used in this specification is<br>
used as a representative of tungsten bronze structures<br>
classified as a cubic tungsten bronze structure type or a<br>
perovskite tungsten bronze structure type in the general<br>
classification of the tungsten bronze structure. The term<br>
"tetragonal structure" used in this specification is used as a<br>
representative of the tungsten bronze structures classified as<br>
a tetragonal tungsten bronze structure type in the general<br>
classification of the tungsten bronze structure. The term<br>
"hexagonal structure" used in this specification is used as a<br>
representative of the tungsten bronze structures classified as<br>
a hexagonal tungsten bronze structure type in the general<br>
classification of the tungsten bronze structure.<br>
[0149]<br>
With this composite tungsten oxide, the element M is<br>
positioned in the gaps formed between shared apexes of an<br>
octahedral structure, as shown in FIGS. IB to ID. It is<br>
believed that conduction electrons are produced by the<br>
addition of the elements M. The structure of a composite<br>
tungsten oxide is typically cubic, tetragonal, or hexagonal,<br>
and these structures are shown in FIGS. IB, 1C and ID,<br>
respectively. These composite tungsten oxides have a<br>
structure-based upper limit to the amount of addition element,<br>
and the maximum addition amount of the element M per mole of W<br>
is as follows: 1 mol in the case of a cubic system, about 0.5<br>
mol in the case of a tetragonal system (this varies depending<br>
on the addition amount, but 0.5 mol can be easily produced on<br>
a commercial scale), and 0.33 mol in the case of a hexagonal<br>
system. However, these structures are difficult to define in<br>
a simple manner, and the range of maximum addition amounts of<br>
the addition element M described above is an example that<br>
particularly shows a basic range, and this Invention is not<br>
limited to this range. Several types of structures may be<br>
adopted in the crystal structure by compositing materials.<br>
The above-described structure is a representative structure,<br>
and no limitation is imposed by the structure.<br>
[0150]<br>
In a composite tungsten oxide, the optical<br>
characteristics vary depending on the above-described<br>
structure. Hexagonal systems in particular tend to have a<br>
72<br>
light absorption region based on conduction electrons in the<br>
near-infrared region having longer wavelengths, and absorption<br>
in the visible light region is also low. Next, tetragonal<br>
systems and cubic systems tend to absorb light having shorter<br>
wavelengths by means of conduction electrons, and absorption<br>
in the visible light region is also high. Accordingly, a<br>
composite tungsten oxide, which has a hexagonal structure, is<br>
preferred for the above-stated reasons as the transparent<br>
electroconductive film capable of transmitting more visible<br>
light. However, as long as the oxide has the basic<br>
configuration described above, electrical conductivity and<br>
infrared-shielding characteristics can be obtained even if the<br>
structure is an amorphous structure.<br>
[0151]<br>
It is commonly known that a hexagonal system is formed<br>
when an element M having a large ion radius is added to a<br>
composite tungsten oxide. Specifically, when any of the<br>
elements Cs, K, Rb, Tl, Ba, In, Li, Ca, Sr, Fe, and Sn are<br>
added, a hexagonal system is readily formed, and such a<br>
situation is preferred. However, as long as the added element<br>
M is present in the gaps of the hexagonal structure, as shown<br>
in FIG. ID, for example, a WO6 unit can be formed using an<br>
element other than those noted above, and no limitation is<br>
imposed by these elements. Also, a composite tungsten oxide<br>
having these hexagonal structures may be a uniform crystal<br>
structure or an irregular crystal structure.<br>
 [0152]<br>
In this case, It Is possible use both methods. I.e., to<br>
limit the above-described oxygen content and to add an element<br>
M for generating conduction electrons to the tungsten trioxide<br>
(WO3). Also, when the transparent electroconductive film<br>
described above is used as an infrared-shielding film, a<br>
material that is suitable for the time and purpose, e.g., an<br>
element M, may be selected.<br>
[0153]<br>
1-(B). Composite oxide nanoparticles that Include element<br>
A<br>
In addition to the tungsten oxide and composite tungsten<br>
oxide described in 1-(A), there is also a composite oxide<br>
expressed by the general formula MEAGW(i-G)Oj (where M is one or<br>
more elements selected from H, He, alkali metals, alkalineearth<br>
metals, rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co,<br>
Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd. Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge,<br>

Hf, Os, Bi, and I; A is one or more elements selected from Mo,<br>
Nb, Ta, Mn, V, Re, Pt, Pd, and Ti; W is tungsten; O is oxygen;<br>
0 
the result is a composite oxide in which tungsten is not used<br>
and that is primarily composed of an element A.<br>
[0154]<br>
Since effective free electrons are generally not present<br>
in WO3 or in MoO3, Nb2Os, Ta2O5, V2O5, TiO2, and MnO2, these<br>
compounds have no or minimal electrical conductivity, and have<br>
no or minimal absorption (reflection) of light in the nearinfrared<br>
region by conduction electrons. However, when<br>
element M is added to these substances, and composite tungsten<br>
oxide nanoparticles expressed by the general formula MEAGW(i-G)Oj<br>
(where M is one or more elements selected from H, He, alkali<br>
metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr,<br>
Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga,<br>
In, Tl, Si. Ge, Sn, Pb. Sb, B, F, P, S, Se, Br, Te, Ti, Nb, V.<br>
Mo, Ta, Re, Be, Hf, Os, Bi, and I; A is one or more elements<br>
selected from Mo, Nb, Ta, Mn, V, Re, Pt, Pd, and Ti; W is<br>
tungsten; O is oxygen; 0 
are used, the element M releases conduction electrons in the<br>
oxide structure of W or the element A, and the element M<br>
itself acts as a positive ion.<br>
[0155]<br>
The released conduction electrons have the effect of<br>
absorbing (reflecting) light in the near-infrared region, and<br>
contribute to the electrical conductivity of the composite<br>
oxide nanoparticles. It is apparent that PtOx, PdOx, ReO3, and<br>
the like exhibit electrical conductivity even without the<br>
addition of an element M, and adding the element M further<br>
Increases the number of conduction electrons and improves<br>
conduction characteristics and absorption (reflection) in the<br>
near-Infrared region.<br>
[0156]<br>
The matrix structure obtained using an element A,<br>
tungsten, and oxygen may be constructed using oxygen and one<br>
element selected from tungsten and an element A, or may be<br>
constructed using oxygen and a plurality of elements. When an<br>
element M is added to the gaps of a structure composed of<br>
oxygen, tungsten, and the element A, conduction electrons are<br>
generated, and this approach is effective for conduction<br>
characteristics and near-infrared absorption.<br>
[0157]<br>
In the formula MEAGW(i-G)Oj, the range of E is preferably 0<br>0, conduction electrons are generated by<br>
the element M, and effective near-infrared absorption and<br>
conduction characteristics are demonstrated. If the value of<br>
E is 1.2 or less, the generation of impurities contained in<br>
the element M is avoided, degradation of the characteristics<br>
can be prevented, and such a situation is therefore preferred.<br>
[0158]<br>
In the formula MEAGW(i-6)Oj, the range of 6 is preferably 0<br>
conduction electrons are generated and effective near-infrared<br>
absorption and conduction characteristics are demonstrated.<br>
An element A other than tungsten is present in the composite<br>
oxide, whereby the optical characteristics of the composite<br>
oxide can be varied and conventionally unavailable features<br>
can otherwise be demonstrated. Therefore, G is preferably<br>
greater than 0. The preferred addition amount of the element<br>
A varies in accordance with the intended use, but 1 or less is<br>
preferred. When G s; 1, impurities contained in the element A<br>
are not generated due to the presence of excessive element A,<br>
and degradation of the composite oxide characteristics can<br>
therefore be prevented.<br>
[0159]<br>
The case of G 
When the composite oxide nanoparticles of the composition<br>
MEAGW(i-G)Oj described above have a hexagonal crystal structure,<br>
the transmission characteristics of the composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles with respect to visible light are improved and<br>
the absorption characteristics of light in the near-Infrared<br>
region are also improved. This will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. ID, which is a schematic diagram of the<br>
hexagonal structure. In FIG. ID, six octahedrons formed by W<br>
(or an element A) O6 units are brought together and provided<br>
with hexagonal gaps. An element M is disposed in the gaps,<br>
constituting a single unit. A large number of these units are<br>
brought together to form a hexagonal crystal structure. This<br>
structure is referred to as a so-called tungsten bronze<br>
structure.<br>
[0160]<br>
In order to achieve the effect of improving transmission<br>
characteristics in the visible light region and improving<br>
absorption characteristics in the near-infrared region, the<br>
composite oxide nanoparticles should at least contain some of<br>
the unit structures described in FIG. ID (a structure in which<br>
six octahedrons formed by W (or an element A) O6 units are<br>
brought together and provided with hexagonal gaps, and element<br>
M is disposed in the gaps), and the tungsten oxide composite<br>
nanoparticles may be either crystalline or amorphous.<br>
[0161]<br>
Introducing positive ions of the element M into the<br>
hexagonal gaps is preferred because transmission<br>
characteristics of visible light are improved in comparison<br>
with other crystal structures, and absorption characteristics<br>
of light in the near-infrared region are also improved. From<br>
the standpoint of electroconductive applications, since the<br>
absorption of visible light by the composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles is low, visible-light transmittance is reduced<br>
only slightly even when a large amount of the nanoparticles is<br>
used, and this approach is effective for improving electrical<br>
conductivity in a visible-light-transmitting electroconductive<br>
material. Generally, when the element M having a large ion<br>
radius is added, a hexagonal crystal is formed. Specifically,<br>
when one or more elements selected from Cs, Rb, K, Tl, In, Ba,<br>
Li, Ca, Sr, Fe, and Sn are added, a hexagonal system is<br>
readily formed. As long as an element M is present in the<br>
hexagonal gaps formed by the W (or element A) O6 units, another<br>
element may naturally be used and no limitation is imposed by<br>
the element.<br>
 [0162]<br>
When the composite tungsten oxide nanoparticles having a<br>
hexagonal structure have a uniform crystal structure in the<br>
tungsten bronze structure, the addition amount of the element<br>
M is preferably 0.2 or more and 0.5 or less, and more<br>
preferably about 0.33. It is believed that the element M is<br>
inserted into all of the hexagonal gaps in a tungsten bronze<br>
structure by setting the addition amount of the element M to<br>
be 0.33. In this case, the tungsten sites of the tungsten<br>
bronze structure are substituted with the element A, and the<br>
bronze structures of tungsten and element A may be present<br>
together or may be independent of each other.<br>
[0163]<br>
In addition to the above-described hexagonal tungsten<br>
bronze structure, tetragonal and cubic tungsten bronze<br>
structures are also effective as infrared-shielding materials.<br>
The absorption position of light in the near-infrared region<br>
tends to vary depending on the crystal structure. The<br>
absorption position of a cubic structure has a greater<br>
tendency to move toward the longer wavelengths than does a<br>
tetragonal structure, and a tetragonal structure has a greater<br>
tendency to do so than a hexagonal structure. Also, hexagonal<br>
structures have the lowest absorption characteristics for<br>
visible light, and tetragonal and cubic structures have<br>
increasingly greater absorption characteristics in the<br>
indicated order. Therefore, a hexagonal tungsten bronze<br>
structure is preferably used in applications in which more<br>
visible light is to be transmitted and more light in the nearinfrared<br>
region is to be shielded. In this case, the tungsten<br>
sites of the tungsten bronze structure may be substituted<br>
using an element A, or a bronze structure of an element A may<br>
be also present. However, the tendencies of the optical<br>
characteristics described above will vary depending on the<br>
type and amount of added elements. The optimal solution may<br>
therefore be determined by experimentation, and the present<br>
invention is not limited thereby.<br>
[0164]<br>
The case of G - 1 is described next.<br>
When G - 1 in composite oxide nanoparticles having a<br>
composition expressed by the formula MEAGW(i-G)Oj described above,<br>
the composition becomes MeAOj and does not contain tungsten.<br>
However, electrons are generated when an element M is added<br>
even in a material that does not include tungsten. Conduction<br>
characteristics can be provided by the generation of<br>
conduction electrons via the same mechanism as the case of<br>
MEAoWd-GjOj (where G 
near-Infrared region is shielded. Therefore, the composition<br>
can be handled in the same manner as in the case in which<br>
tungsten is included in the composition (when G

2-(A). Method for manufacturing transparent<br>

for manufacturing transparent electroconductive film that uses<br>
composite tungsten oxide<br>
A transparent electroconductive film composed of a<br>
tungsten oxide expressed by the general formula WyOz (where W<br>
is tungsten, O is oxygen, and 2.2 £ z/y £ 2.999), and/or a<br>
composite tungsten oxide expressed by the general formula<br>
MxWyOz (where M is one or more elements selected from H, He,<br>

oxygen; 0.001 * x/y j£ 1, and 2.2 s z/y ^ 3.0) can be obtained<br>
by using, as a starting tungsten material solution, a solution<br>
that contains a tungsten compound, which is a starting<br>
material of the tungsten oxide and/or the composite tungsten<br>
oxide; applying the tungsten compound starting material<br>
solution; and thereafter heat treating the base material<br>
coated with the tungsten compound starting material solution,<br>
in an atmosphere of an inert gas and/or reducing gas.<br>
[0166]<br>
A preferable approach is to add a surfactant to the<br>
starting material solution and then apply the solution to a<br>
base material to uniformly form a thin film on a base material.<br>
Nonionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric, or other surfactants<br>
may be used. In the particular case that an aqueous solution<br>
such as that of ammonium metatungstate is used, the surface<br>
tension of the water is considerable. Therefore, a surfactant<br>
must be added to reduce the surface tension so that the<br>
solution can be uniformly applied to a base material.<br>
[0167]<br>
One or more solutions selected from aqueous solutions of<br>
ammonium tungstate and solutions obtained by dissolving<br>
tungsten hexachlorlde in an alcohol are preferably used as the<br>
tungsten compound starting material solution. If the starting<br>
material is a tungsten starting material, the material is<br>
easily dissolved in water or alcohol, and coating on a base<br>
material can be easily performed using an inexpensive coating<br>
method.<br>
[0168]<br>
Preferably used as the tungsten compound starting<br>
material solution of the transparent electroconductive film is<br>
a mixed solution composed of a tungsten compound starting<br>
material solution (one or more solutions selected from aqueous<br>
solutions of ammonium tungstate and solutions obtained by<br>
dissolving tungsten hexachloride in an alcohol, or a solution<br>
obtained by adding a surfactant to this starting material) as<br>
a composite tungsten oxide starting material solution and an<br>
element M (where M is one or more elements selected from H, He,<br>
alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare earth elements, Mg,<br>
Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Nl, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd,<br>

[0169]<br>
Examples of the starting material of the addition element<br>
M include M-containing tungstates, chlorides, nitrates,<br>
sulfates, oxalates, oxides, carbonates, and hydroxides, but no<br>
limitation is imposed thereby as long as the material can form<br>
a solution.<br>
[0170]<br>
The transparent electroconductive film of the present<br>
embodiment may be obtained by applying a tungsten compound<br>
starting material solution to a base material, and then heat<br>
treating the material in an atmosphere of an inert gas<br>
atmosphere and/or reducing gas. In this manner, when a<br>
tungsten compound starting material solution is applied to a<br>
base material, and the material is then heat treated in an<br>
atmosphere of an inert gas atmosphere and/or reducing gas, the<br>
heat treatment is preferably carried out in an atmosphere of a<br>
reducing gas at a temperature ranging from 100° C or greater to<br>
800°C or less, and then carried out as required in an<br>
atmosphere of an inert gas at a temperature ranging from 550° C<br>
or greater to 1,200"C or less. The reducing gas is not<br>
particularly limited in this case, but H2 is preferred. When<br>
Ha is used as the reducing gas, H2 as a component of the<br>
reducing atmosphere is preferably present in a volume ratio of<br>
0.1% or greater and, and more preferably in a volume ratio of<br>
2% or greater. Reduction can progress with good efficiency<br>
when Ha is present in a volume ratio of 0.1% or greater. N2 or<br>
argon gas is used as the inert gas.<br>
[0171]<br>
The transparent electroconductive film of the present<br>
embodiment may be formed by vapor deposition or sputtering,<br>
and any manufacturing method may be used as long as the<br>
resulting film is a tungsten oxide or a composite tungsten<br>
oxide. When the transparent electroconductive film of the<br>
present embodiment is obtained by sputtering or vapor<br>
deposition, starting materials that are suitable for each<br>
method may be used. For example, vapor deposition pellets and<br>
a target suited for the desired transparent electroconductive<br>
film composition may be used.<br>
[0172]<br>
2-(B). Method for manufacturing transparent<br>
electroconductive film that uses composite tungsten oxide<br>
nanoparticles that contain an element A<br>
The composite oxide expressed by the general formula<br>
MEAcWd-GjOj may be obtained by heat treating the starting<br>
material in an atmosphere of an inert gas and/or reducing gas.<br>
The starting material of element A and tungsten is not<br>
particularly limited as long as tungsten or element A is<br>
included. Examples that may be used Include one or more<br>
compounds selected from oxides, hydrated oxides, chlorides,<br>
ammonium salts, carbonates, nitrates, sulfates, oxalates,<br>
hydroxides, peroxides, and simple metals. Organic compounds<br>
or compounds containing two or more types of metal elements<br>
(e.g., sodium tungstate) may also be used. An advantageous<br>
commercial manufacturing method is one in which water or a<br>
solvent are mixed using various types of salts.<br>
[0173]<br>
In the composite oxide nanoparticles expressed by the<br>
general formula MEAoWd-oOj, the starting material of the<br>
element M may include the element M, and the starting material<br>
of the element A may include the element A. No particular<br>
limitations are imposed. Preferred examples include one or<br>
more compounds selected from chlorides, ammonium salts,<br>
carbonates, nitrates, sulfates, oxalates, hydroxides, and<br>
peroxides. Also, organic complexes, or compounds containing<br>
two or more types of metal elements (e.g., sodium tungstate)<br>
may be used. An advantageous commercial manufacturing method<br>
is one in which Impurities are not produced during heat<br>
reduction when carbonates, hydrates, or the like are used.<br>
[0174]<br>
The starting materials of the tungsten W, element A, and<br>
element M that can form a solution (chlorides, nitrates, and<br>
the like) are preferably formed into a solution and mixed to<br>
obtain a starting material, whereby sufficient mixing can be<br>
achieved.<br>
 [0175]<br>
Here, the heat treatment condition maintained after the<br>
starting material of the element M, as well as tungsten and<br>
the starting material of the element A, have been mixed is<br>
preferably 250°C or greater. A film obtained by heat<br>
treatment at 250°C or greater has sufficient electrical<br>
conductivity and near-infrared absorbency.<br>
Ar, N2, or another inert gas may be used as the heat<br>
treatment atmosphere. Ammonia or hydrogen gas may be used as<br>
the reducing gas.<br>
When hydrogen gas is used, hydrogen gas as a component of<br>
the reducing atmosphere is preferably present in a volume<br>
ratio of 0.1% or greater and, and more preferably in a volume<br>
ratio of 1% or greater. Reduction can progress with good<br>
efficiency when hydrogen gas is present in a volume ratio of<br>
0.1% or greater.<br>

3. Transparent electroconductive article and infraredshielding<br>
article<br>
The transparent electroconductive film of the present<br>
embodiment is formed on a base material to obtain a<br>
transparent electroconductive article. The base material of<br>
the transparent electroconductive film is not particularly<br>
limited, but transparent glass and transparent resin film are<br>
common base materials.<br>
[0177]<br>
The thickness of the transparent electroconductive film<br>
of the present embodiment can be varied in accordance with the<br>
intended use, but from 1 nm or greater to 5,000 nm or less is<br>
preferred. If the film thickness is 1 nm or greater,<br>
effective conduction characteristics can be achieved. If the<br>
film thickness is 5,000 nm or less, the transmittance of<br>
visible light is not reduced, and such a situation is<br>
preferred.<br>
[0178]<br>
The transparent electroconductive film of the present<br>
embodiment exhibits absorbency and reflectivity from the nearinfrared<br>
to infrared regions by conductive electrons. The<br>
film therefore has infrared- and near-infrared-shielding<br>
functions, and is advantageous as a visible-light-transmitting<br>
infrared-shielding article.<br>

infrared-shielding nanoparticles of the present embodiment do<br>
not contain tungsten when G «= 1, resulting in composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles that are primarily composed of the element A.<br>
[0181]<br>
1. Composite oxide nanoparticles<br>
Since effective free electrons are generally not present<br>
in WO3 or in MoO3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, V2O5, TiO2, and MnO2, these<br>
compounds have no or minimal electrical conductivity, and have<br>
no or minimal absorption (reflection) in the near-infrared<br>
region due to conduction electrons. However, when an element<br>
M is added to these substances, and composite tungsten oxide<br>
nanoparticles expressed by the general formula MEAaWd-cjOj<br>
(where M is one or more elements selected from H, He, alkali<br>
metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare earth elements, Mg, Zr, Cr,<br>

tungsten; O is oxygen; 0 
are used, the element M releases conduction electrons in the<br>
oxide structure of W or the element A, and the element M<br>
Itself acts as a positive ion.<br>
[0182]<br>
The released conduction electrons have the effect of<br>
absorbing (reflecting) light in the near-infrared region, and<br>
contribute to the electrical conductivity of the composite<br>
oxide nanopartlcles. It is apparent that PtOx, PdOx, ReO3, and<br>
the like exhibit electrical conductivity even without the<br>
addition of an element M, and adding an element M further<br>
increases the number of conduction electrons and improves<br>
conduction characteristics and absorption (reflection) in the<br>
near-infrared region.<br>
[0183]<br>
The matrix structure obtained using an element A,<br>
tungsten, and oxygen may be constructed using oxygen and one<br>
element selected from tungsten and an element A, or may be<br>
constructed using oxygen and a plurality of elements. When an<br>
element M is added to the gaps of a structure composed of<br>
oxygen, tungsten, and the element A, conduction electrons are<br>
generated, and this approach is effective for conduction<br>
characteristics and near-infrared absorption.<br>
[0184]<br>
89<br>
In the formula MEAGW(i-G)Oj, the range of E is preferably 0<br>
E £ 1.2. If E &gt; 0, conduction electrons are generated by<br>
the element M, and effective near-infrared absorption and<br>
conduction characteristics are demonstrated. If the value of<br>
E is 1.2 or less, the generation of impurities contained in<br>
the element M is avoided, degradation of the characteristics<br>
can be prevented, and such a situation is therefore preferred.<br>
[0185]<br>
In the formula MuAcWd-oOj, the range of G is preferably 0<br>
conduction electrons are generated and effective near-infrared<br>
absorption and conduction characteristics are demonstrated.<br>
An element A other than tungsten is present in the composite<br>
oxide, whereby the optical characteristics of the composite<br>
oxide can be varied and conventionally unavailable features<br>
can otherwise be demonstrated. Therefore, G is preferably<br>
greater than 0 depending on the intended use. The preferred<br>
addition amount of the element A varies in accordance with the<br>
Intended use, but 1 or less is preferred. When G s 1,<br>
impurities contained in the element A are not generated due to<br>
the presence of excessive element A, and degradation of the<br>
composite oxide characteristics can therefore be prevented.<br>
[0186]<br>
The case of G 
When the composite oxide nanoparticles of the composition<br>
MEAGW(i-G)Oj described above have a hexagonal crystal structure,<br>
the transmission characteristics of the composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles with respect to visible light are improved and<br>
the absorption characteristics of light in the near-infrared<br>
region are also improved. This will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 10, which is a schematic diagram of the<br>
hexagonal structure. In FIG. 10, six octahedrons formed by W<br>
(or an element A) O6 units are brought together and provided<br>
with hexagonal gaps, wherein W is Indicated by the reference<br>
numeral 1. An element M, indicated by the reference numeral 2,<br>
is disposed in the gaps, constituting a single unit. A large<br>
number of these units are brought together to form a hexagonal<br>
crystal structure. This structure is referred to as a socalled<br>
hexagonal tungsten bronze structure.<br>
[0187]<br>
In order to achieve the effect of improving transmission<br>
characteristics in the visible light region and improving<br>
absorption characteristics in the near-infrared region, the<br>
composite oxide nanoparticles should at least contain some of<br>
the unit structures described in FIG. 10 (a structure in which<br>
six octahedrons formed by W (or an element A) O6 units are<br>
brought together and provided with hexagonal gaps, and element<br>
M is disposed in the gaps), and the composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles may be either crystalline or amorphous.<br>
[0188]<br>
Introducing positive ions of the element M into the<br>
hexagonal gaps is preferred because transmission<br>
characteristics of visible light are improved in comparison<br>
with other crystal structures, and absorption characteristics<br>
of light in the near-infrared region are also improved. From<br>
the standpoint of electroconductive applications, since the<br>
absorption of visible light by the composite oxide<br>
nanopartides is low, visible-light transmittance is reduced<br>
only slightly even when a large amount of the nanoparticles is<br>
used, and this approach is effective for improving electrical<br>
conductivity in a visible-light-transmitting electroconductive<br>
material. Generally, when the element M having a large ion<br>
radius is added, a hexagonal crystal is formed. Specifically,<br>
when one or more elements selected from Cs, Rb, K, Tl, In, Ba,<br>
Li, Ca, Sr, Fe, and Sn are added, a hexagonal system is<br>
readily formed. As long as an element M is present in the<br>
hexagonal gaps formed by the W (or element A) 06 units, another<br>
element may naturally be used and no limitation is imposed by<br>
the element.<br>
[0189]<br>
When the composite tungsten oxide nanoparticles having a<br>
hexagonal crystal structure have a uniform crystal structure<br>
in the tungsten bronze structure, the addition amount of the<br>
element M is preferably 0.2 or more and 0.5 or less, and more<br>
preferably about 0.33. It is believed that the element M is<br>
inserted into all of the hexagonal gaps in a tungsten bronze<br>
structure by setting the addition amount of the element M to<br>
be 0.33. In this case, the tungsten sites of the tungsten<br>
bronze structure are substituted with the element A, and the<br>
bronze structures of tungsten and element A may be present<br>
together or may be independent of each other.<br>
[0190]<br>
In addition to the above-described hexagonal tungsten<br>
bronze structure, tetragonal and cubic tungsten bronze<br>
structures are also effective as infrared-shielding materials.<br>
The absorption position of light in the near-infrared region<br>
tends to vary depending on the crystal structure. The<br>
absorption position of a cubic structure has a greater<br>
tendency to move toward the longer wavelengths than does a<br>
tetragonal structure, and a tetragonal structure has a greater<br>
tendency to do so than a hexagonal structure. Also, hexagonal<br>
structures have the lowest absorption characteristics for<br>
visible light, and tetragonal and cubic structures have<br>
increasingly greater absorption characteristics in the<br>
Indicated order. Therefore, a hexagonal tungsten bronze<br>
structure is preferably used in applications in which more<br>
visible light is to be transmitted and more light in the nearinfrared<br>
region is to be shielded. In this case, the tungsten<br>
sites of the tungsten bronze structure may be substituted<br>
using an element A, or a bronze structure of an element A may<br>
be also present. However, the tendencies of the optical<br>
characteristics described above will vary depending on the<br>
type and amount of added elements. The optimal solution may<br>
therefore be determined by experimentation, and the present<br>
invention is not limited thereby.<br>
[0191]<br>
The case of G - 1 is described next.<br>
When G = 1 in composite oxide nanoparticles having a<br>
composition expressed by the formula MEAGW(i-G)Oj described above,<br>
the composition becomes MEAOJ and does not contain tungsten.<br>
However, electrons are generated when an element M is added<br>
even in a material that does not include tungsten. Absorption<br>
in the near-infrared region occurs via the same mechanism as<br>
in the case of MEAGW(i-G)Oj (where G 
Therefore, the composition can be handled in the same manner<br>
as in the case in which tungsten is included in the<br>
composition (when G 
[0192]<br>
The infrared-shielding nanoparticles that Include<br>
composite oxide nanoparticles of the present embodiment absorb<br>
a considerable amount of light in the near-infrared region,<br>
and particularly in the vicinity of the wavelength 1,000 run.<br>
Therefore, the transmission color tone is often between a blue<br>
color and a green color. The diameter of the infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticles can be selected based on the intended<br>
use. First, when the particles are to be used in applications<br>
in which high transparency is to be retained, the particle<br>
diameter is preferably 800 nm or less. This is due to the<br>
fact that particles having a diameter of less than 800 nm do<br>
not perfectly shield light by scattering the light, visibility<br>
is retained in the visible light region, and transparency can<br>
be simultaneously retained with good efficiency. In the<br>
particular case that importance is placed on transparency in<br>
the visible light region, the scattering produced by the<br>
particles is preferably given further consideration.<br>
[0193]<br>
When importance is placed on reducing scattering produced<br>
by the particles, the particle diameter of is 200 nm or less,<br>
and more preferably 100 nm or less. The reason for this is<br>
that if the diameter of the composite oxide nanoparticles is<br>
small, the scattering of light in the visible light wavelength<br>
region of 400 nm to 780 nm is reduced due to geometrical<br>
scattering or Mie scattering. Therefore, it is possible to<br>
avoid a situation in which the infrared-shielding nanoparticle<br>
dispersion becomes similar to clouded glass and clear<br>
transparency cannot be obtained. In other words, when the<br>
particle diameter of the composite oxide nanoparticles is 200<br>
nm or less, the geometrical scattering or Mie scattering is<br>
reduced and a Rayleigh scattering region is formed. This is<br>
due to the fact that the scattered light is reduced in an<br>
inverse proportion to the particle diameter by a factor of 6<br>
in this Rayleigh scattering region, and the scattering is<br>
reduced as the particles are made smaller and the transparency<br>
is enhanced. When the particle diameter is 100 nm or less,<br>
the amount of scattered light is very low, and such a<br>
situation is even more preferred. From the standpoint of<br>
avoiding the scattering of light, the particle diameter is<br>
preferably small. Also, if the particle diameter is 1 nm or<br>
greater, the particles are easy to manufacture on a commercial<br>
scale.<br>
[0194]<br>
To improve the weather resistance of the infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticles , the surfaces of the composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles constituting the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticles of the present embodiment are preferably covered<br>
by an oxide having one or more elements selected from Si, Ti,<br>
Zr, and Al. However, when the nanoparticles are to be used in<br>
electroconductive applications, resistance is increased due to<br>
higher contact resistance between the particles when the<br>
surface of the particles is covered by the oxide. Therefore,<br>
the nanoparticles are preferably not used in cases in which<br>
lower resistance is desired.<br>
[0195]<br>
2. Method for manufacturing infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticles<br>
The composite oxide nanoparticles expressed by the<br>
general formula MEAGW{i-G)Oj may be obtained by heat treating the<br>
starting material in an atmosphere of an inert gas and/or<br>
reducing gas.<br>
The starting material of the element A and tungsten is<br>
riot particularly limited as long as tungsten or element A is<br>
Included. Examples that may be used include one or more<br>
compounds selected from oxides, hydrated oxides, chlorides,<br>
ammonium salts, carbonates, nitrates, sulfates, oxalates,<br>
hydroxides, peroxides, and simple metals. Organic compounds<br>
or compounds containing two or more types of metal elements<br>
(e.g., sodium tungstate) may also be used. An advantageous<br>
commercial manufacturing method is one in which impurities<br>
that are difficult to remove during heat reduction are not<br>
produced when oxides, carbonates, hydrates, or the like are<br>
used.<br>
[0196]<br>
In the composite oxide nanoparticles expressed by the<br>
general formula MEAGW(i_G)Oj, the starting material of the<br>
element M may include the element M, and the starting material<br>
of the element A may include the element A. No particular<br>
limitations are imposed. However, preferred examples include<br>
one or more compounds selected from oxides, hydrates of oxides,<br>
chlorides, ammonium salts, carbonates, nitrates, sulfates,<br>
oxalates, hydroxides, peroxides, and simple metals. Also,<br>
organic complexes, or compounds containing two or more types<br>
of metal elements (e.g., sodium tungstate) may be used. An<br>
advantageous commercial manufacturing method is one in which<br>
impurities are not produced during heat reduction when oxides,<br>
carbonates, hydrates, or the like are used.<br>
 [0197]<br>
The starting materials of the tungsten W, element A, and<br>
element M that can form a solution (chlorides, nitrates, and<br>
the like) are preferably formed into a solution, mixed, and<br>
dried into a powder to obtain a starting material of composite<br>
oxide nanoparticles, whereby sufficient mixing can be achieved.<br>
It is apparent that even if the starting material cannot be<br>
formed into a solution, the powder may be directly mixed to<br>
obtain a starting material of the composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles.<br>
[0198]<br>
Here, the heat treatment condition maintained after the<br>
starting material of the element M, as well as tungsten and<br>
the starting material of the element A, have been mixed is<br>
preferably 250°C or greater. Infrared-shielding material film<br>
nanoparticles obtained by heat treatment at 250°C or greater<br>
have sufficient electrical conductivity and near-infrared<br>
absorbency.<br>
Ar, N2, or another inert gas may be used as the heat<br>
treatment atmosphere. Ammonia or hydrogen gas may be used as<br>
the reducing gas.<br>
When hydrogen gas is used, hydrogen gas as a component of<br>
the reducing atmosphere is preferably present in a volume<br>
ratio of 0.1% or greater and, and more preferably in a volume<br>
ratio of 1% or greater. Reduction can progress with good<br>
efficiency when hydrogen gas is present in a volume ratio of<br>
0.1% or greater.<br>
[0199]<br>
From the standpoint of improving the weather resistance,<br>
the surface of the composite oxide nanoparticles obtained in<br>
the above-described step is preferably covered by an oxide<br>
having one or more metals selected from Si, Ti, Zr, and Al.<br>
The covering method is not particularly limited, but it is<br>
possible to cover the surfaces of the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticles by adding an alkoxide of the above-noted metals<br>
to the solution in which the Infrared-shielding nanoparticles<br>
have been dispersed.<br>
[0200]<br>
3. Infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion and<br>
infrared-shielding body<br>
A method for using the infrared-shielding nanoparticles<br>
of the present embodiment entails dispersing infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticles in a suitable medium to obtain an<br>
infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion, and forming a film<br>
on the surface of a desired base material. It is possible to<br>
pre-bake the infrared-shielding nanoparticles at a high<br>
temperature, and knead the resulting infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticles into a base material or bind the particles to<br>
the base material surface using a medium. Application can<br>
therefore be made to resins and other base materials that have<br>
a low heat-resistance temperature. For this reason, such a<br>
body can be manufactured at low cost without the use of bulky<br>
equipment when the film is formed on a base material.<br>
Also, since the composite oxide nanoparticles that<br>
include the infrared-shielding nanoparticles of the present<br>
embodiment are composed of an electroconductive material,<br>
application can be made to optical and electroconductive uses<br>
when the material is used as a continuous film (dispersed<br>
body).<br>
[0201]<br>
(a) Method for dispersing infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticles in a medium and forming a film on base material<br>
surfaces<br>
A thin film in which the infrared-shielding nanoparticles<br>
are dispersed can be formed by dispersing the infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticles of the present embodiment in an<br>
appropriate solvent, adding a resin medium, applying the<br>
resulting dispersion to the surface of a base material, and<br>
vaporizing the solvent to cure the resin by a prescribed<br>
method. The coating method is not particularly limited as<br>
long as the resin containing the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticles can be uniformly applied to the surface of a<br>
base material. Examples include bar coating, gravure coating,<br>
spray coating, and dip coating. Films in which the infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticles are directly dispersed in a resin<br>
medium are environmentally and commercially preferred because<br>
the solvent does not have to be vaporized after the film has<br>
been applied to the surface of a base material.<br>
[0202]<br>
Resin or glass may be used as the above-described medium.<br>
The medium may be selected from, e.g., a UV-curable resin,<br>
a thermosetting resin, an electron beam-curable resin, a room<br>
temperature-curable resin, a thermoplastic resin, or another<br>
resin in accordance with the purpose. Specific examples of<br>
the resin include polyethylene resin, polyvinyl chloride resin,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride resin, polyvinyl alcohol resin,<br>
polystyrene resin, polypropylene resin, ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer, polyester resin, polyethylene terephthalate resin,<br>
fluorine resin, polycarbonate resin, acrylic resin, and<br>
polyvinyl butyral resin. A medium that uses a metal alkoxide<br>
may also be used as the medium. Typical examples of metal<br>
alkoxides include those of Si, Ti, Al, and Zr. Media that use<br>
these metal alkoxides may be subjected to hydrolysis and then<br>
heated to form an oxide film.<br>
The shape of the base material is not limited, and the<br>
base material may be formed in the shape of a film or board as<br>
desired. PET, acryl, urethane, polycarbonate, polyethylene,<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, vinyl chloride, fluorine<br>
resin, or the like may be used in accordance with the Intended<br>
purpose. Apart from resins, glass may be used.<br>
 [0203]<br>
(b) Method for dispersing infrared-shielding<br>
iianoparticles in a base material<br>
The infrared-shielding nanoparticles of the present<br>
embodiment may be dispersed in a based material. In order to<br>
disperse the infrared-shielding nanoparticles in a base<br>
material, the infrared-shielding material particles may be<br>
allowed to permeate from the surface of the base material, or<br>
the temperature of the particles may be Increased above the<br>
melting temperature of the base material, and the particles<br>
may then be melted and mixed with resin. The resulting resin<br>
containing the infrared-shielding nanoparticles may be molded<br>
into a film or a board by a prescribed method and used as an<br>
infrared-shielding nanoparticle-molded body.<br>
An example of a method for dispersing the infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticles in a PET resin entails mixing PET<br>
resin and a liquid dispersion of the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticles, vaporizing the dispersion solvent, thereafter<br>
heating the PET resin to about 300°C, which is the melting<br>
point of PET resin, to melt and mix the PET resin, and then<br>
cooling the material to produce a PET resin in which the<br>
infrared-shielding nanoparticles are dispersed.<br>
The method for dispersing the Infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticles is not particularly limited, and ultrasonic<br>
irradiation, a bead mill, a sand mill, or the like can be used.<br>
for example. Additives may be added to obtain a uniform<br>
dispersed body, and the pH may be adjusted.<br>
[0204]<br>
(c) Infrared-shielding body<br>
The infrared-shielding nanoparticles of the present<br>
embodiment may be formed into an infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion by applying the nanoparticles to a<br>
base material as described above and kneading the<br>
nanoparticles into the base material, or by using another<br>
method.<br>
An infrared-shielding body can be obtained by forming the<br>
infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion into the form of a<br>
plate, film, or thin film.<br>
The infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion contains<br>
electroconductive composite oxide nanoparticles, and when the<br>
dispersion is applied to a base material using the same method<br>
as that described above and kneaded into the base material,<br>
the electrical conductivity of the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion spreads two-dimensionally or threedimensionally<br>
via the contact of the composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles. As a result, the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion is provided with electrical<br>
conductivity. A visible light-transmitting, electroconductive,<br>
infrared-shielding body can be obtained by forming the<br>
infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion into the form of a<br>
plate, film or thin film.<br>
 [0205]<br>
4. Optical and electroconductive characteristics of the<br>
infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion and infraredshielding<br>
body.<br>
Since the infrared-shielding nanoparticles of the present<br>
invention have the above-described infrared-shielding ability,<br>
the infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion can be formed<br>
into a plate, film, or thin film to produce an infraredshielding<br>
body. It is possible to obtain an infraredshielding<br>
body that has an infrared-shielding function in<br>
which the V value is 10% or greater when the maximum<br>
transmittance of all light rays in the wavelength region of<br>
400 nm to 700 nm is set to the V value, and the minimum<br>
transmittance of all light rays in the wavelength region of<br>
700 nm to 2,600 nm is equal to or less than the value V, and<br>
is 65% or less.<br>
[0206]<br>
The Infrared-shielding function is described in further<br>
detail below using as an example the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle (Rb0.33MoO3) dispersion film of example 24<br>
described below.<br>
FIG. 11 is a transmission profile of light in an<br>
Infrared-shielding film, which is the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle (Rb0.33MoO3) dispersion of example 24. It was<br>
determined that the value V, which is the maximum<br>
transmittance of light in the wavelength region of 400 nm and<br>
700 nm, is 80.25% and that visible light is adequately<br>
transmitted, as shown in FIG. 11. It was also determined that<br>
the minimum transmittance of all light rays in the wavelength<br>
region of 700 nm to 2,600 nm is 22.65%, which is the V value<br>
or less, and that light in the near-infrared region is<br>
adequately shielded.<br>
[0207]<br>
The infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion contains<br>
electroconductive composite oxide nanoparticles, and when the<br>
dispersion is applied to a base material using the same method<br>
as that described above and kneaded into the base material,<br>
the electrical conductivity of the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion spreads two-dimensionally or threedimensionally<br>
via the contact of the composite oxide<br>
nanoparticles. As a result, the infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion is provided with electrical<br>
conductivity. A visible light-transmitting, electroconductive<br>
infrared-shielding body can be obtained by forming the<br>
infrared-shielding nanoparticle dispersion into a plate, film,<br>
or thin film. It is possible to obtain a visible lighttransmitting,<br>
electroconductive, infrared-shielding body in<br>
which the maximum transmittance of all light rays in the<br>
wavelength region of 400 nm to 700 nm is set to the V value or<br>
greater (defined as the V value), and the surface resistance<br>
is 1 x 1010 Q/square.<br>
 [0208]<br>
When transparency is required, the particle diameter must<br>
be 800 nm or less, as described above. The contact resistance<br>
per unit of volume increases when the particle diameter is<br>
made very small, and this situation is not preferred for<br>
reducing resistance. Also, the shape of the particles may be<br>
granular, tabular, or acicular (fibrous). In order to improve<br>
electrical conductivity, tabular or acicular shapes that can<br>
reduce the contact resistance are preferred.<br>
[Examples]<br>
[0209]<br>
The present invention is described in greater detail<br>
below using examples, but the present Invention is not limited<br>
by the examples.<br>
[0210]<br>
Examples 1 to 13, and Comparative Example 1 are<br>
principally related the above-described [1] visible light<br>
transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor,<br>
electroconductive particles, visible-light-transmitting<br>
electroconductive article, and method for manufacturing the<br>
same. The optical characteristics of the visible light<br>
transmitting particle-dispersed electrical conductor were<br>
measured using a spectrophotometer (U-400 manufactured by<br>
Hitachi Ltd.), and visible-light transmittance (based on JIS<br>
R3106) was calculated. The haze value was measured based on<br>
JIS K 7105 using a measuring apparatus HR-200 manufactured by<br>
Murakami Color Research Laboratory. The average dispersion<br>
particle diameter was measured using a measuring apparatus<br>
(ELS-800 (Otsuka Denki, K.K.)) that uses dynamic light<br>
scattering. The average of three measurements was used as the<br>
mean dispersion particle diameter. The evaluation of the<br>
conduction characteristics was performed by measuring the<br>
surface resistance of the fabricated films. The surface<br>
resistance of the films was measured using Hiresta IP MCPHT260<br>
manufactured by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co.<br>
The pressed powder resistance was carried out using the<br>
van der Pauw method (see Jikken Kagaku Koza 9: Electricity and<br>
Magnetism, Fourth edition, June 5, 1991, Ed.: The Chemical<br>
Society of Japan, Publisher: Maruzen.) The samples were<br>
pressed pellets shaped as discolds having a diameter of 10 mm,<br>
and four terminal electrodes were disposed at 90° intervals on<br>
the disk surface. A current was allowed to flow between two<br>
adjacent terminals while applying 9.8 MPa of pressure, the<br>
voltage at the other two terminals was measured, and the<br>
resistance was calculated.<br>
[0211]<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Tungsten hexachloride was dissolved in ethanol, and the<br>
solution was dried at 130°C to obtain a hydrate of tungsten<br>
oxide. This starting material was heated at 550°C for one hour<br>
in a reducing atmosphere (volume ratio: argon/hydrogen - 95/5),<br>
cooled to room temperature, and then heated at 800°C for one<br>
hour in an argon atmosphere, thus producing the target<br>
tungsten oxide powder.<br>
As a result of determining the crystal phase via X-ray<br>
diffraction, the resulting powder was determined to be a socalled<br>
Magnell phase Wi8O49 (WO2.72). FIGS. 4A and 4B show the<br>
result of viewing the shape of the powder via SEM. In this<br>
case, FIG. 4A is an SEM image of Wi8O49 at a magnification of<br>
10,000. and FIG. 45 is an SEM image at a magnification of<br>
3,000.<br>
At this time, acicular crystals were observed, as shown<br>
in FIGS. 4A and 4B. Also, the pressed powder resistance of<br>
the particles measured under a pressure of 9.8 MPa was 0.085<br>
Q-cm, and good electrical conductivity was confirmed.<br>
[0212]<br>
Next, 20 parts by weight of the powder of the WO2.72<br>
electroconductlve particles, 79 parts by weight of toluene,<br>
and 1 part by weight of a dispersing agent were mixed and<br>
irradiated with ultrasonic waves in order to disperse acicular<br>
crystals while allowing the crystals to retain their shape. A<br>
liquid dispersion was thus obtained. Next, 10 parts by weight<br>
of this liquid dispersion, and 0.1 parts by weight of a UVcuring<br>
resin as a hard coat were mixed. This solution was<br>
applied to glass using a bar coater to form a film. This film<br>
was dried for 30 seconds at 60°C, the solvent was allowed to<br>
evaporate, and the film was then cured using a high pressure<br>
mercury lamp to obtain a visible light transmitting particledispersed<br>
electrical conductor film (hereinafter simply<br>
abbreviated as "electrical conductor film").<br>
[0213]<br>
The following results were obtained when the optical<br>
characteristics of the electrical conductor film were measured.<br>
The visible-light transmittance was 63%,, and light in the<br>
visible region was adequately transmitted. The haze value was<br>
3.5%, transparency was high, the transmitted color tone was a<br>
beautiful blue color, and the surface resistance was 7.6 x 108<br>
Q/square.<br>
[0214]<br>
(Example 2)<br>
An aqueous solution of ammonium metatungstate was dried<br>
at 130°C to obtain a compound composed of tungsten oxide in the<br>
form of a powder. This starting material was heated at 550°C<br>
for one hour in a reducing atmosphere (volume ratio:<br>
argon/hydrogen - 97/3), cooled to room temperature, and then<br>
heated at 800°C for one hour in an argon atmosphere to prepare<br>
tungsten oxide powder. As a result of determining the crystal<br>
phase via X-ray diffraction, a crystal phase Wi8O49 (WO2.72) was<br>
observed. In this manner, the same electroconductive<br>
particles as in Example 1 were successfully fabricated even<br>
when ammonium metatungstate was used as the tungsten compound<br>
starting material. The pressed powder resistance of the<br>
powder electroconductive particles measured under a pressure<br>
of 9.8 MPa was 0.089 Q-cm, and good electrical conductivity<br>
was confirmed.<br>
[0215]<br>
(Example 3)<br>
Cesium carbonate and tungstic acid were mixed using a<br>
mortar in a Cs/W molar ratio of 0.33. This starting material<br>
was heated at 600°C for two hours in a reducing atmosphere<br>
(volume ratio: argon/hydrogen - 97/3), cooled to room<br>
temperature, and then heated at 800°C for one hour in an argon<br>
atmosphere to prepare a powder composed of Cs0.33WO3<br>
electroconductive particles. As a result of determining the<br>
crystal phase via X-ray diffraction, this Cs0.33WO3 was found to<br>
be hexagonal tungsten bronze. The resulting powder form of<br>
the ©lectroconductive particles was viewed using an SEM. The<br>
results are shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 5 is an SEM image of<br>
Cs0.33WO3 at a magnification of 10,000.<br>
At this time, crystals shaped as hexagonal pillars were<br>
observed, as shown in FIG. 5. The pressed powder resistance<br>
of the electroconductive particle powder measured under a<br>
pressure of 9.8 MPa was 0.013 Q-cm, and good electrical<br>
conductivity was confirmed.<br>
 [0216]<br>
Next, 20 parts by weight of the powder of the Cs0.33WO3<br>
electroconductive particles, 79 parts by weight of toluene,<br>
and 1 part by weight of a dispersing agent were mixed and<br>
dispersed using a media-agitating mill to prepare a liquid<br>
dispersion in which the average dispersion particle (*6) was<br>
100 nm. Next, 10 parts by weight of this liquid dispersion,<br>
and 0.1 parts by weight of a UV-curing resin (solid content:<br>
100%) as a hard coat were mixed. This solution was applied to<br>
glass using a bar coater to form a film. This film was dried<br>
for 30 seconds at 60°C, the solvent was allowed to evaporate,<br>
and the film was then cured using a high pressure mercury lamp<br>
to obtain an electrical conductor film.<br>
[0217]<br>
The following results were obtained when the optical<br>
characteristics of the electrical conductor film were measured.<br>
The visible-light transmittance was 77%, and light in the<br>
visible region was adequately transmitted. The haze value was<br>
0.2%, transparency was high, and the internal state could be<br>
clearly viewed from the exterior. The transmitted color tone<br>
was a beautiful blue color, and the surface resistance was 2.8<br>
x 109 Q/square.<br>
[0218]<br>
(Example 4)<br>
Cesium carbonate and tungstlc acid were mixed using a<br>
mortar in a Cs/W ratio of 0.35. This starting material was<br>
heated at 600°C for two hours in a reducing atmosphere (volume<br>
ratio: argon/hydrogen = 97/3), cooled to room temperature, and<br>
then heated at 800°C for one hour in an argon atmosphere to<br>
prepare a powder composed of Cso.3sWO3 electroconductive<br>
particles. As a result of determining the crystal phase via<br>
X-ray diffraction, this Cso.3sWO3 was observed to have a<br>
hexagonal crystal phase. The resulting powder was viewed<br>
using an SEM. The results are shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B. FIG.<br>
6A is an SEM image of Cs0.3sWO3 at a magnification of 5,000, and<br>
FIG. 6B is an SEM image at a magnification of 10,000.<br>
At this time, tabular crystals were observed, as shown in<br>
FIG. 6. In this manner, it was determined that tabular<br>
crystals are generated by Increasing the Cs addition amount<br>
above 0.33. The pressed powder resistance of the powder<br>
measured under a pressure of 9.8 MPa was 0.0096 Q-cm, and good<br>
electrical conductivity was confirmed.<br>
[0219]<br>
(Example 5)<br>
Cesium carbonate and tungstic acid were mixed using a<br>
mortar in a Cs/W molar ratio of 0.33. This starting material<br>
was heated at 600°C for two hours in a reducing atmosphere<br>
(volume ratio: argon/hydrogen - 97/3) to prepare a powder<br>
composed of Cso.3aWO3 electroconductive particles. As a result<br>
of determining the crystal phase via X-ray diffraction, this<br>
Cs0.33WO3 was observed to have a hexagonal crystal phase. The<br>
pressed powder resistance of the particles measured under a<br>
pressure of 9.8 MPa was 0.013 Q-cm, and good electrical<br>
conductivity was confirmed.<br>
[0220]<br>
Next, 20 parts by weight of the powder of the Cs0.33WO3<br>
electroconductive particles, 79 parts by weight of toluene,<br>
and 1 part by weight of a dispersing agent were mixed and<br>
dispersed using a media-agitating mill to prepare a liquid<br>
dispersion in which the average dispersion particle (*6) was<br>
120 nm. Next, 10 parts by weight of this liquid dispersion,<br>
and 0.1 parts by weight of a UV-curing resin (solid content:<br>
100%) as a hard coat were mixed. This solution was applied to<br>
glass using a bar coater to form a film. This film was dried<br>
for 30 seconds at 60°C, the solvent was allowed to evaporate,<br>

solution. The film-forming solution was applied by<br>

Examples 24 to 35 and Comparative Examples 3 to 5 are<br>
principally related the above-described [3] infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion, infrared-shielding body, method for<br>
manufacturing infrared-shielding nanoparticles, and infraredshielding<br>
nanoparticles. Optical measurements were carried<br>
out based on JISA 5759 (1998) (light source: A light) for<br>
window glass films used in construction, and the visible-light<br>
transmittance and solar light transmittance were calculated.<br>
However, the measurement samples were not applied to glass and<br>
the film samples themselves were used.<br>
The haze value was measured based on JISK 7105.<br>
The average dispersion particle diameter was measured<br>
using a measuring apparatus (ELS-800 (Otsuka Denki, K.K.))<br>
that uses dynamic light scattering, and the average value was<br>
used.<br>
The conduction characteristics were evaluated by<br>
measuring the surface resistance of the fabricated films using<br>
Hiresta IP MCP-HT260 manufactured by Mitsubishi Petrochemical<br>
Co.<br>
The optical characteristics of the base material PET film<br>
were as follows: The HPE-50 (Teijin) used in the examples had<br>
a visible-light transmittance of 88%, a solar light<br>
transmittance of 88%, and a haze value of 0.9 to 0.8%.<br>
[0277]<br>
(Example 24)<br>
Starting materials Rb2CO3 and MoO3-H2O were mixed using a<br>
mortar to obtain the desired composition Rbo.33MoO3. The<br>
composition was reduced for one hour at 450°C in an atmosphere<br>
(flow) of hydrogen and nitrogen in a volume ratio of 3:7, and<br>
thereafter heat treated for one hour at 800°C in an N2<br>
atmosphere to obtain an Rb0.33MoO3 powder.<br>
Next, 20 parts by weight of this powder, 75 parts by<br>
weight of toluene, and 5 parts by weight of a dispersing agent<br>
were mixed and dispersed to prepare a liquid dispersion in<br>
which the average dispersion particle diameter was 80 run.<br>
Next, 10 parts by weight of this liquid dispersion, and 100<br>
parts by weight of a UV-curing resin (solid content 100%) as a<br>
hard coat were mixed to obtain a liquid infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion. This liquid Infrared-shielding<br>
nanoparticle dispersion was applied to a PET resin film (HPE-<br>
50) using a bar coater to form a film. This film was dried<br>
for 30 seconds at 60°C, the solvent was allowed to evaporate,<br>
and the film was then cured using a high pressure mercury lamp<br>
to obtain an infrared-shielding film.<br>
 [0278]<br>
The optical characteristics of the infrared-shielding<br>
film are shown in TABLE 2. The transmittance peak in TABLE 2<br>
shows the maximum transmittance of all light rays in the<br>
wavelength region of 400 nm to 700 nm, and the transmittance<br>
bottom is the minimum transmittance of all light rays in the<br>
wavelength region of 700 nm to 2,600 nm.<br>
The resulting infrared-shielding film had very high<br>
transparency, and the internal state could be clearly viewed<br>
from the exterior. The transmitted color tone was a beautiful<br>
blue color. It is apparent from FIG. 11, which is a<br>
transmission profile of light in the infrared-shielding film,<br>
that the value V, which is the maximum transmittance of light<br>
rays in the wavelength region of 400 nm to 700 nm as described<br>
above, was 80.25%, and that the visible light was adequately<br>
transmitted. The minimum transmittance of all light rays in<br>
the wavelength region of 700 nm to 1,200 nm was 22.65% below<br>
the V value. The average value (solar light transmittance)<br>
was 57.0%, and the near-infrared-shielding performance was<br>
high.<br>
However, the above-described visible-light transmittance<br>
and solar light transmittance vary depending on the amount of<br>
infrared-shielding material dispersed per unit of surface area.<br>
Therefore, the visible-light transmittance and solar light<br>
transmittance both vary in relation to the dispersed amount of<br>
Infrared-shielding material. The same applies in the<br>
following examples and comparative examples.<br>

(Comparative Example 3)<br>
The optical characteristics of PET films which had a<br>
thickness of 50 \m and in which the base materials of Examples<br>
24 to 35 were used were measured. The visible-light<br>
transmlttance was 88.1%, and visible light was adequately<br>
transmitted, but the solar light transmlttance was 88.1%.<br>

The resulting infrared-shielding film had very high<br>

as an infrared-shielding material. Also, the surface<br>
resistance was 101S Q/square or greater, and the material did<br>
not have electrical conductivity.<br>

hydrogen and nitrogen in a volume ratio of 3:7, and thereafter<br>
heat treated for one hour at 800°C in an N2 atmosphere. Many<br>
unintended compounds composed of Na and O were generated in<br>
the resulting powder in addition to the intended compound<br>
composed of Na, Mo, W, and O (Nao.sMoo.osWo.gsCh). Therefore,<br>
subsequent measurements were not made.<br>
