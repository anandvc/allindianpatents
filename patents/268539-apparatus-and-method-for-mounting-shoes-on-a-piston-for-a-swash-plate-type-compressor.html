				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MOUNTING SHOES ON A PISTON FOR A SWASH PLATE TYPE COMPRESSOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for mounting shoes on a piston for a swash plate type compressor, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for mounting a lower shoe and an upper shoe on a piston fed along a guide rail.<br>
Background Art<br>
A swash plate type compressor is used for an air conditioning apparatus of an air conditioning system for vehicles. FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic cross-section of the swash plate type compressor. Shoes 11 and 12 are rotatably mounted on the lower and upper portions, respectively, of a swash plate insertion space 15 of a piston 10, and a swash plate 2 is inserted between the two shoes 11 and 12 so that the shoes 11 and 12 can slide with respect to the swash plate 2. As a result, as the swash plate 2 fixed with a predetermined slope with respect to a rotation shaft 3 rotates, the piston 10 moves up and down, performing compression.<br>
Manufacturing such a swash plate type compressor .requires a process of inserting the swash plate 2 between the loweT shoe 11 mounted at a lower shoe mount portion 13 and the upper shoe 12 mounted at an upper show mount portion 14. The lower shoe 11 and the upper shoe 12 face each other upward and downward, respectively, and have a hemisphere shape. Accordingly, it is not easy to manually and stably dispose the lower and upper shoes 11 and 12 at the lower and upper shoe mount portions 13 and 14, respectively, and insert the swash plate 2 therebetween.

Best mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, in an apparatus for mounting shoes on a piston for a swash plate type compressor, according to a first type of a first embodiment of the present invention, a first insertion unit 110 and a second insertion unit 210 have a circular table shape. The apparatus of the first type includes a guide rail 20, a piston feeder 30, the first insertion unit 110, and the second insertion unit 210.<br>
The guide rail 20 serves to stably keep a lower shoe 11 and an upper shoe 12, which will be mounted on the piston 10, in the lower shoe mount portion 13 and the upper shoe mount portion 14, respectively. Accordingly, it is preferable that the thickness of the guide rail 20 is the same as a distance between the lower shoe 11 and the upper shoe 12 when they are mounted on the lower and upper shoe mount portions 13 and 14, respectively, i.e., the thickness of a peripheral portion of the swash plate 2. The guide rail 20 includes a first receiving space 21 for receiving the first insertion unit 110, a second receiving space 22 for receiving the second insertion unit 210, and a swash plate receiving space 23 receiving the swash plate 2 so that the lower and upper shoes<br>
11 and 12 can be mounted on the piston 10 and then the piston 10 can be continuously moved with the mounted lower and upper shoes 11 and 12. The first and second receiving spaces 21 and 22 and the swash plate receiving space 23 are formed by recessing the guide rail 20. In FIG. 2, the guide rail 20 is discontinued at the first and second receiving spaces 21 and 22. However, as far as the guide rail 20 does not hinder an operation of mounting the lower and upper shoes 11 and 12, the guide rail 20 may be continued at a narrow width at the opposite side to the first and second insertion units 110 and 210. The guide rail 20 does not go beyond the swash plate receiving space 23 so that the piston 10 can be inserted into the swash plate 2.<br>
To insert a predetermined number of pistons 10 into the swash plate 2, the piston 10 is moved around the swash plate 2. Here, it is preferable to use a means for guiding the inserted pistons 10 not to escape from the swash plate 2. In the first embodiment of the present invention, the means is implemented by a circular guide 29 surrounding the swash plate 2 and being concentric with the swash plate 2.<br>
While moving along the guide rail 20, the piston feeder 30 supports the piston 10 until the swash plate 2 is inserted between the lower and upper shoes 11 and 12 mounted on the piston 10. In FIG. 2, the piston feeder 30 supports and feeds a single piston 10. However, the piston feeder 30 may include a plurality of piston holders, support and feed a plurality of pistons 10, and processes of mounting the lower and upper shoes 11 and 12 on each piston 10 and inserting the piston 10 into the swash plate 2 may be continuously performed.<br>
Hereinafter, structures and functions of the first insertion unit 110 and the second insertion unit 120 will be described.<br>
A first mounting unit includes a slider 160 and a first actuator 170, and a second mounting unit includes an elevator 260 and a second actuator 270. Each of the first and second actuators 170 and 270 is implemented by an actuator such as a pneumatic cylinder, a hydraulic cylinder, or a linear motor, which enables a linear motion. In the first<br>
embodiment, each of the first and second actuators 170 and 270 is implemented by a pneumatic cylinder.<br>
The first mounting unit is installed in the first insertion unit 110, as shown in FIG. 3. The first mounting unit may be designed such that the first actuator 170 and the slider 160 are installed through a receiving space formed in a lower surface of the first insertion unit 110 and then supported by a cover (not shown) covering the bottom of the receiving space. A space allowing the slider 160 to move back and forth is formed in the first insertion unit 110.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, when the piston 10 is moved by the piston feeder 30 to the first insertion unit 110 in the first receiving space 21, the slider 160 which has supported a lower shoe 11 by blocking a lower shoe drop-hole 130, as shown in FIG. 3, is moved backward by the first actuator 170, as shown in FIG. 4, so that the lower shoe 11 is dropped and mounted on the lower shoe mount portion 13. The lower shoe drop-hole 130 has an appropriate size and depth for receiving the lower shoe 11 and has open top and bottom.<br>
After the lower shoe 11 is mounted on the lower shoe mount portion 13, the piston 10 is moved by the piston feeder 30 to the second insertion unit 210 in the second receiving space 22 to mount an upper shoe 12 on the upper shoe mount portion 14. To mount a lower shoe 11 on another piston 10, the slider 160 moves forward and blocks the lower shoe drop-hole 130 in the first insertion unit 110. The lower shoe 11 is supplied onto the slider 160 by a first supply unit 120.<br>
In FIG. 2, the first insertion unit 110 has a circular table shape. In this case, it is preferable that a first supply unit 120 is separately disposed from the first receiving space 21 and supplies a lower shoe 11 to the first mounting unit by dropping the lower shoe 11 onto the slider 160 through the lower shoe drop-hole 130.<br>
In addition, the first insertion unit 110 is rotated by a rotation shaft 180 to repeat the above-described operations. A unit rotation angle of the first insertion unit 110 is not limited to 90° shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Moreover, the unit rotation angle of the first insertion unit 110 does not need to be the same as that of the second insertion unit 210 having a circular table shape.<br>
The second mounting unit including the second actuator 270 and the elevator 260 is inserted and fixed to a cylindrical support 280, as shown in FIG. 5. The cylindrical support 280 is made separately from the second insertion unit 210 and is coupled to the bottom surface of the second insertion unit 210 to support and rotate the second insertion unit 210. After the second mounting unit is installed in a receiving space formed in the cylindrical support 280, the second insertion unit 210 having a passage allowing the elevator 260 to move up and down is coupled to the cylindrical support 280.<br>
When the piston 10 mounted with the lower shoe 11 reaches the second insertion unit 210 received in the second receiving space 22, the elevator 260 which has supported an upper shoe 12 in an upper shoe receiving portion 230, as shown in FIG. 5, is lifted up by the second actuator 270, as shown in FIG. 6, so that the upper shoe 12 is pushed up and mounted on the upper shoe mount portion 14. Here, the top surface of the elevator 260 is on the same level as or a little higher than the top surface of the guide rail 20. Unlike when the lower shoe 11 is mounted, the elevator 260 remains at the above-described lifted position until the piston 10 leaves the second receiving space 22 so that the upper shoe 12 is prevented from escaping from the upper shoe mount portion 14. The upper shoe receiving portion 230 has an appropriate size and depth for receiving the upper shoe 12, and at least upper portion of the upper shoe receiving portion 230 is open.<br>
After leaving the second receiving space 22, the piston 10 is moved by the piston feeder 30 to the swash plate 2. In order to mount an upper shoe 12 on another piston 10, the elevator 260 is moved downward in the second insertion unit 210 so that the upper shoe 12 can be supplied to the upper shoe receiving portion 230 by a second supply unit 220.<br>
In FIG. 2, the second insertion unit 210 has a circular table shape. In this case, it is preferable that a second supply unit 220 is separately disposed from the second receiving space 22 and supplies an upper shoe 12 to the second mounting unit by dropping the upper shoe 12 onto the elevator 260 through the upper shoe receiving portion 230.<br>
In addition, the second insertion unit 210 is rotated by the cylindrical support 280 to repeat the above-described operations. A unit rotation angle of the second insertion unit 210 is not limited to 90° shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, in an apparatus for mounting shoes on a piston for a swash plate type compressor, according to a second type of the first embodiment of the present invention, a first insertion unit 310 and a second insertion unit 410 have a bar shape. Features different from the first type will be described, and features, which are the same as those of the first structure or which those skilled in the art can easily achieve by modifying the first structure, will not be described.<br>
The guide rail 20 has the first receiving space 21, the second receiving space 22, and the swash plate receiving space 23 (not shown in FIG. 7). Unlike the first structure, the first and second receiving spaces 21 and 22 are formed to have a rectangular shape to receive the first and second insertion units 310 and 410 having the bar shape. Since the first insertion unit 310 has the rectangular bar shape, the first insertion unit 310 moves back and forth to be supplied with and mount a lower shoe 11. In other words, the first insertion unit 310 mounts the lower shoe 11 on the lower shoe mount portion 13 through a lower shoe drop-hole 330 and is then moved out from the first receiving space 21 by a first linear driving unit 380. Next, the lower shoe drop-hole 330 is blocked by a slider 360, and a first supply unit (not shown) supplies a lower shoe 11 onto the slider 360. Then, the first insertion unit 310 is re-inserted into the first receiving space 21 to mount the lower shoe 11 to a next piston 10.<br>
When the piston 10 reaches the second receiving space 22, the<br>
second insertion unit 410 having the rectangular bar shape moves in the same manner as the first insertion unit 310 and mounts the upper shoe 12 on the piston 10 using an elevator 460 in the same manner as the second insertion unit 210 of the apparatus of the first type.<br>
In the first embodiment of the present invention, both of first and second insertion units have a circular table shape or a rectangular bar shape. However, the first insertion unit may have a circular table shape while the second insertion unit has a rectangular bar shape, or the first insertion unit may have a rectangular bar shape while the second insertion unit has a circular table shape.<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9 show a second embodiment of the present invention which has the same structure (not shown) for mounting the lower shoe 11 as the first embodiment but has a different structure for mounting the upper shoe 12 therefrom. Thus, description of mounting the lower shoe 11 will be omitted.<br>
In the second embodiment of the present invention, a second insertion unit 510 has a circular table shape that includes a second insertion unit slope 560 in a peripheral portion such that the second insertion unit slope 560 leads to the guide rail 20, and the upper shoe 12 is pushed upward along the second insertion unit slope 560. In other words, when the piston 10 reaches the second insertion unit 510 received in the second receiving space 22, an upper shoe receiving portion 530 is supporting the upper shoe 12, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. Then, a support plate 575 is interposed between a wall 574 at an end of the second insertion unit slope 560 and the piston 10, and the second insertion unit slope 560 continues to a guide rail slope 25 of the guide rail 20. In this situation, when the support plate 575 is moved upward along the slopes 560 and 25 together with the piston 10, the upper shoe 12 on the upper shoe receiving portion 530 gradually goes upward along the slopes 560 and 25 and is mounted on the upper shoe mount portion 14 when the upper shoe 12 reaches an end of the guide rail slope 25. The second insertion unit 510 is not rotated until the support plate 575 and<br>
the piston 10 leave the second insertion unit 510.<br>
After the support plate 575 leaves the second insertion unit 510, the second insertion unit 510 rotates by a unit rotation angle to mount an upper shoe 12 on a next piston 10, and the upper shoe receiving portion 530 is supplied with an upper shoe 12 by a second supply unit 520.<br>
A support plate driver 576 is provided to move the support plate 575 in a piston feed direction. The support plate driver 576 may be coupled to the piston feeder 30, may be movably coupled to the guide rail 20, or may be separately installed.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a third embodiment of the present invention in which a first insertion unit and a second insertion unit are combined. Features different from the first embodiment will be described, and features, which are the same as those of the first embodiment or which those skilled in the art can easily achieve by modifying the first embodiment, will not be described.<br>
In the third embodiment of the present invention, a first insertion unit and a second insertion unit are integrated into a single insertion unit 610. Hereinafter, a lower shoe drop-hole 631 and a first mounting unit which mounts a lower shoe 11 on the lower shoe mount portion 13 through the lower shoe drop-hole 631 are together referred to as a first mounting set. An upper shoe receiving portion 632 and a second mounting unit which mounts an upper shoe 12 in the upper shoe receiving portion on the upper shoe mount portion 14 are together referred to as a second mounting set.<br>
The first and second mounting sets are alternately inserted into the swash plate insertion space 15 in the piston 10 and mount the lower and upper shoes 11 and 12, respectively, on the piston 10. In the third embodiment, since both of the upper and lower shoes 11 and 12 are mounted using the single insertion table 610, it is preferable that both of a first supply unit 621 and a second supply unit 622 are provided in the insertion table 610 in order to supply the lower and upper shoes 11 and 12. However, only one supply unit which alternately supplies the lower<br>
and upper shoes 11 and 12 may be provided.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a fourth embodiment of the present invention in which a first insertion unit and a second insertion unit are combined like the third embodiment.
