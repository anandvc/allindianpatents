"Protection disks for breastfeeding mothers"<br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
5 The invention relates to an "improvement in the disks used for protecting<br>
the breasts of breastfeeding mothers, whose milk is used for feeding a newborn<br>
baby and for absorbing the flow of milk, which spontaneously comes out<br>
therefrom.<br>
10 Background of the invention<br>
The feeding of a baby is essential for its correct development and for<br>
good nutrition it is strongly advised by paedlatricians, midwives and other<br>
experts in breastfeeding. It is a practice, which contributes many benefits, apart<br>
from the nutritional ones. in both mother and child.<br>
15 Nevertheless, the practice of breastfeeding causes milk leakage after the<br>
sucking, as well as pain and hypersensitivity therein.<br>
Different mechanisms exist which adapt to the breasts so as to avoid<br>
milk leakage and protect them from knocks and chafing. The embodiment<br>
consisting of two disks, one for each breast, is very widespread and is<br>
20 adaptable fo the latter and made of absorbent and resistant material.<br>
The same experts also advise, both for the mother and child's benefit,<br>
that for each feed, the baby is breastfed with both breasts and starting with the<br>
breast last used in the previous feed.<br>
One must bear in mind that caring for a baby requires an effort of both<br>
25 concentration and serenity and that, faced with a series of stimuli and situations<br>
such as: hygiene, controlling the feeding schedule, the length of time with each<br>
breast, etc., it may be that the person responsible for doing it (the mother),<br>
especially it she iS starting, needs a period of adaptation and a range of outside<br>
resources to make her job easier, in practice, for instance, the fact of having to<br>
30 remember which was the last breast used for feeding the baby, may cause<br>
problems to the person responsible for doing it.<br>
Just as different embodiments exist which help in several of the<br>
aforementioned aspects, so there continue to be difficulties in other aspects. It is<br>
the case of said example, when the mother starts a feed with breast milk, she<br>
35 has to stop to think which breast she ended the previous one with. Having said<br>
that, provided that one wants to do it in a way which is most beneficial to both.<br><br>
WO 2004/054495 PCT/EP2003/014749<br>
-2-<br>
Explanation of the invention.-<br>
With the aim of providing a solution to the previously described problems<br>
stemming from the lack of resources which help in following the guidelines<br>
recommended for the feeding of a newborn baby by breast milk, always giving<br>
5 milk first from the breast with which the previous feed ended, a new protection<br>
has beart created for the breast at the secretion of milk stags for the feeding of a<br>
newborn baby, which at the same time complies with all the technological<br>
requirements for permitting all the aforementioned functions.<br>
The protection disks for breastfeeding mothers object of the invention<br>
10 are characterised in that they comprise two Kinds of disk clearly differentiated<br>
from each other, of which the disks of the first kind have an appreciably different<br>
configuration from those of the second and/or are provided with at least one<br>
differentiating tactile and/or optical marking, in high relief or in low relief,<br>
enabling them to be differentiated from other disks of the second kind, intended<br>
15 for applying to the other breast which are devoid of said marking or have<br>
another different marking.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, the differentiating<br>
tactile and/or optical marking is removable, so that its application in one of the<br>
disks of the second Kind convert said disk into one of the first kind.<br>
20 The protection disks object of the invention are also characterised in that<br>
the disks of the first kind and of the second kind can comprise a small deposit, <br>
in the fonn of a bag or inflatable bubble, which constitutes the differentiating<br>
marker, capable of being burst or easily deflated.<br>
25 Brief description of the drawings<br>
Represented in the drawings of this specification is an example of an<br>
embodiment of one of the protection disks for breastfeeding applicable to a<br>
mother's breast ready to give milk, to protect it and absorb the flow of milk that<br>
spontaneously comes out therefrom, object of the present invention. In said<br>
30 drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a plan view of an embodiment example of the protection disk;<br>
Fig. 2 is a profile view of the disk;<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the same disk;<br>

Detailed description of the drawing.-<br>
The description which follows refers to the above described drawings,<br>
which make it possible to appreciate in detail an embodiment example of the<br>
5 protection disks of the present invention.<br>
As can be appreciated in Figs., 1 to 3, the protection disk represented<br>
comprises an optical and tactile marking 1 that makes it possible to distinguish it<br>
from other disks that do not have it.<br>
In Fig. 4 we can observe an example of the thickness of the protection<br>
10 disk as regards the marking in low or high relief, so that the latter is small in<br>
order not la show on the dotting superimposed on it and at the same time<br>
being enough to be noticeable by touch.<br>
The protection disks object of the present invention consist of an<br>
improvement on the absorbent disks currently existing on the market, adaptable<br>
15 to breasts which are at the breast milk secretion stage.<br>
In accordance with Figs. 1 to 5, the protection disks comprise two kinds<br>
of disks 2-2', clearly differentiated from each, other. The disks are differentiated<br>
from each other because the disks of the first kind 2 are of a different<br>
configuration from the first kind 2'. Obviously, the different configuration of the<br>
20 disks 2-2' in themselves constitute art optical and tactile differentiating marking.<br>
In any case, the disks can also be differentiated from each other because the<br>
disk in the first kind 2 is provided with a differentiating optical and/or tactile<br>
marking 1, in high relief or in low relief, whereas the disk of the second kind 2'<br>
similar to this one, placed on the other breast, lacks said marking 1 or has<br>
25 another different marking 1'. Arranged on the breasts with differentiating<br>
markings and at the same time protecting and absorbing the flow of milk<br>
spontaneously coming out of them, helps the mother to identify the breast with<br>
which to start the next feed for the baby.<br>
The differentiating marking 1-1' is situated in a noticeable area of the<br>
30 corresponding kind 2-2' to differentiate, so that visually and/or by touch, whether<br>
in a lit up or dark place, it is possible to recognize the breast with which to start<br>
the feed at that time. The marking 1-1' can be of high relief or low relief with a<br>
determined shape, but it has to be discrete in such a way that it does not show<br>
through clothing and have an non-aesthetic effect, Said marking 1-1' can be just<br>
36 the one or they can be several, different and/or repetitive, for example a disk of<br>
we colour/shape/feel and the other of another colour/shape/feel.<br><br>
WO 2004/054495 PCT/EP2003/014749<br>
-4-<br>
The marking 1-1' can be incorporated into the product (printed,<br>
engraved, patterned, etc.) in the production process or constitute a removable<br>
accessory which, by means of an adhesive or similar system, the consumer<br>
uses at the time of use, fixing it to the disk that she wants to differentiate,<br>
5 Also provided for is the possibility of both disks 2-2 being the same and<br>
that those that have to be differentiated comprise a small deposit (not<br>
represented), in the form of a bag or inflatable bubble, full of a fluid or plastically<br>
deformable material, designed so that the user may with relative ease at the<br>
time of use, burst, deflate, or press, the aforementioned deposit of one of the<br>
10 disks being permanently deformed, thus differentiating which is the next breast<br>
to start with in the next feed.<br>
In accordance with Fig, 5, the protection disks comprise a first kind 2 of<br>
disks with an appreciate rounded configuration; and a second kind 2' of disk<br>
with an appreciably hexagonal configuration. Obviously, me configuration of the<br>
15 disks 2-2' may consist of any other geometric; shape. In the case represented it<br>
is also envisaged that the two kinds 2-2' of disks can also be differentiated by a<br>
differentiating tactile and/or optical marking 1-1' which consists of providing, the<br>
disks of the first kind 2 with a smooth surface, and the disks of the second kind<br>
2' with a rough surface.<br>
20 If one makes use of the protective disks of the present invention with two<br>
kinds 2-2' of disks clearly differentiated from each other by their different<br>
configuration and/ or by an optical and/or tactile marking 1 -1', the first disk 2 can<br>
he applied to the breast that has been used last to feed the baby and the<br>
second 2' for the other, or vice-versa, but obviously one will have to keep the<br>
25 criteria for identifying the breast and avoid confusion. Therefore, the next time a<br>
feed is started, just by looking at or touching the protective disks one will<br>
immediately know which breast to start with. In addition, for this it may be a<br>
good idea for the marking to be a meaningful icon for the person using it; a drop<br>
of milk, lips, an "OK", a star, etc.<br><br>
