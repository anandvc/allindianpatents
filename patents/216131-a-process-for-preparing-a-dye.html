				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing a dye.<br>
GB-A-1283771 discloses a range of reactive diamine dyes of the formula (A)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Where D is napthylazo-phenylene or naphthalene containing at least 3 sulphonic acid groups, R is H or an optional substituted Ci-4 alkyl group and X is specifically a phenylene, diphenylene or naphthalene nucleus. They offer a degree of fixation over a wide range of liquor to goods ratios and provide shades of very good light fastness.<br>
US-A-5149789 discloses a range of dyestuffs some of which have two or three halotrizine rings interconnected by an aromatic diamine unit or two aromatic diamine units respectively. In one such dye (Example 53), the linking diamine unit carries a phenylazo group. The dye has the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
However, in contrast to the range of dyes disclosed in GB-A-1283771 above, neither substitution on the respective halotriazinylamino groups is a chromophore as such. Accordingly such a dye does not have a particularly high dyeing strength.<br>
We have found surprisingly that if, in a dyestuff of the formula (A), the linking diamine additionally carries an arylazo group, then excellent build up properties can be achieved, as well as excellent light fastness and aqueous solubility. Moreover the dyes still offer a degree of fixation over a wide range of liquor to goods ratios. These properties manifest themselves especially when the dyes are used to exhaust dye cotton.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for preparing a dye of the formula<br>
(1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>

The arylazo diamine of the formula (XV) may be prepared by diazotising an amine of the formula (XVIII)<br>

Preferred diazotizable amines of the formula (XVIII) are any of those given for the first diazotizable amino component (1) for A2 or A3 in formula (X), remote from the triazinylarnino group. Especially preferred are p-(fi-sulphatoethylsulphonyl)aniline, 2-amlnonaphthalene-4,3-disulphonic acid and 2-aminb-3,6,8-trlsulphonfc acid.<br>
Preferred diamines of the formula (XIX) are        m-phenylendiamine, p-phenylenediamine,4-chloro-1,3-phenylenediaminÂ«, 3,5-diaminobenzenesulphonic acid, 4-methoxy-1,3-phenyIenediamine, 2,6-diaminotoluene-4 sulphonic acid, 2,4-diaminoacetanilide, 2,3-diaminonaphthalene-4,8-disulphonic acid, 2,5-diaminobenzoic scid and 3,5-dianiinobenzoic acid.<br>
Although in this specification, dye formulae have been shown in the form of their free acid, the invention also includes dyes and processes using dyes in the salt form, particularly their salts with alkali metals such as the potassium, sodium, lithium or mixed sodium/lithium salt.<br>
The dyes may be used for dyeing, printing or ink-jet printing, for example of textile materials and paper.<br>
The process for colouration is preferably performed at a pH of 7.1<br>
to 13, more preferably 10 to 12. pH levels above 7 can be achieved by performing the process for colouration in tie presence of an acid-binding agent.<br>
The substrate may be ary of a textile material, leather, paper, hair or film, but is preferably a natural or artificial textile material containing anino or hydroxyl groups, for example textile material such as wool, silk, pojyarnides and modified, polyacrylonltrile fibres, and more preferably a cellule sic textile material,, especially cotton, viscose and regenerated cellulese, for example, that commercially available as Tencel. For this purpose the dyes can be applied to the textile materials at a pH above 7 by, for example, exhaust dyeing, padding, or printing. Textile materials are coloured bright shades and possess gcod fastness to light and wet treatments such as washing.<br>
The new dyes are, particularly valuable for colouring cellulosic<br>
cellulosic textile material at a pH above 7 in conjunction with a treatment with an acid-binding agent.<br>
Preferred acid-binding agents include a'kali metal carbonates, bicarbonates, hydroxides, metasilicates and mixtures thereof, for example sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium metasilicate, sodium hydroxide and the corresponding potassium salts. The dyes benefit from excellent build-up and hiigh fixation.<br>
At least for cellulosic materials, dyeing may be carried out at a somewhat higher temperature of about 90Â°C, as compared with dyeing carried out with conventional monochlorotriazine  exhaust dyes which are generally dyed at temperatures of about 30Â°C.  Although more energy is required, particularly improved migration is obtained.<br>
The new dyes can be applied to textile materials containing amine groups, such as wool and polyamide textile materials, from a neutral to mildly alkaline dyebath. The dyeing procsss can be carried out at a constant or substantially constant pH, that is to say the pH of the dyebath remains constant or substantially constant during the dyeing process, or if desired the pH of the dyebath can be altered at any stage of the dyeing process.<br>
The dyes may be in liquid or solid form, for example in granular or powdured form.<br>
We find surprisingly that such dyes provide the following advantageous properties:<br>
a)	excellent build-up;<br>
b)	very strong dyeing;<br>
c)	good robustness ':o changes in dyeing conditions, especially<br>
temperature;<br>

Especially preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated. Although preparation and dyeing with any single dye is exemplified, particular advantages can be seen when dyeing with mixtures of dyes.<br>
2N Sodium nitrite (27.5 mis) was added dropwise to a slurry of para-aminoben:?.ene-li-su!phatoethylsulphone (14,05g, 0.05 mo!) in ice wate- (30 mis) containing cone. HCI (6mls) maintained below 10Â°C. After<br>
1 hr, excess nitrous acid was destroyed by the addition of sulphamic acid, leaving a solution of a diazonium salt.<br>
Meta-phenylenediamine (5.4g, 0,05 mol) was dissolved in water (lOOrnls) at pH4 and the above solution of the diazonium salt was added portiomvise maintaining the pH at 4. After complete addition the mixture was stirred for a further 1hr. The resulting precipitate was filtered off and dried to give a rnonoazo dye (7) containing a linking diamine (17.5g). Analytical data were in full agreement with the expected structure (7).<br>
An aqueous solution of a yellow dye (6) (0,03 mol) and the dye (7) containing 'the, diamine (0.015 mo!) in water (400 mis) was adjusted to pH Â£ and heated at 50Â°C maintaining pH6 by the addition of 2N NaaC03 for 48 hrs. The mixture was then concentrated in  vacuo arid the dye precipitated by the addition of methylated spirits. The precipitate was filtered off and dried to give a reactive dyestuff (1} (24.6g); Arnax = 426nm   e = 75000.<br>
