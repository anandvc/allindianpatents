METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ANTIBODIES IN IMMUNODEFICIENT ANIMAL INJECTED WITH HUMAN FETAL LIVER STEM CELLS;<br>
F. HOFFMANN-LA ROCHE AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS GRENZACHERSTRASSE 124, CH-4002 BASEL, SWITZERLAND<br><br><br><br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br><br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
The present invention relates to methods for the production of antibodies, compositions of antibody producing cells, methods for their production and uses thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Monoclonal antibodies (MAB) have long been considered as magic bullets in immunotherapy of cancer, infection or autoimmune disease etc. However, the first generation of murine antibodies which were used in humans was rather unsuccessful due to human anti-mouse immune responses.<br>
Human antibodies have been mostly either derived from transgenic mice harboring a restricted set of human Ig genes or selected from large artificial antibody libraries using phage display, yeast display or similar recombinant technologies. These strategies have been designed to eliminate any immune reaction against the monoclonal antibody in the human background. Human antibodies can be produced in transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line transgenic mice result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge (see, e.g., van Dijk, M.A. and van de Winkel, J.G., Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 5 (2001) 368-374; Jakobovits, A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 (1993) 2551-2555; Jakobovits, A., et al., Nature 362 (1993) 255-258; Bruggemann, M., et al., Year Immunol. 7 (1993) 33-40). Human antibodies can also be produced in phage display libraries (Hoogenboom, H.R. and Winter, G., J. Mol. Biol. 227 (1992) 381-388; Marks, J.D., et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222 (1991) 581-597). The techniques of Cole et al. and Boerner et al. are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al.t Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); and Boerner, P., et al., J. Immunol. 147 (1991) 86-95). However such transgenic mice are only capable to provide antibodies wih a restricted set of human Ig genes - those which result from the transfected immunoglobulin gene array.<br>
The methodologies based on mice transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes have allowed the generation of antibodies derived from human germ line sequence, which has reportedly reduced the immunogenicity of the resulting antibody drugs<br>
2<br><br>
compared to murine or mouse-human chimeric antibodies. However, transgenic mouse-derived human antibodies are limited in their diversity, affinities and specificities compared to natural human immune repertoires.<br>
Similarly, a major drawback of phage or yeast display-based combinatorial library approaches is the random pairing of the antibody heavy and light chains. The dissociation of the original antibody heavy and light chain pairing, non-cognate pairing, necessitate the screening of a large number of clones in order to identify heavy and light chain pairs of high affinity. In addition, such non-cognate pairs may display unwanted cross-reactivity to human self-antigens. Finally, the genetic diversity of target-specific antibodies identified by selection and screening of combinatorial libraries is commonly limited due to inherent selection biases.<br>
Traggai, E. et al., Science 304 (2004) 104-107 describe a method for the development of a human immune system in human cord blood cell-transplanted Rag 2-/-yc-/-mice, which can be used as a preclinical model to evaluate responses to vaccines or live infectious pathogens and to pharmacological compounds that target the human immune system. It was shown that reconstituted and subsequently pathogen vaccinated mice can produce tetanus toxoid specific antibody responses at low levels.<br>

The term immortal cell refers to a hybridoma cell or a cell immortalized by other means, like EDV transformation, telomerase replacement or retroviral immortalizaton.<br>
The term animal as used herein refers to a non human animal, preferably a rodent and especially preferred a mouse or rat<br>
Preferably said non-human animal is a rodent and more preferably a mouse, rat or rabbit. It is further preferred that the mouse is a Rag2-/-γc-/-, nude Rag 2-/-, NOD or SCID beige mouse and the rat is a nude rat.<br>
SCID beige is a double mutant mouse carrying the scid mutation which causes a lack of both T and B lymphocytes due to a defect in V(D)J recombination. It also carries the beige mutation which results in cytotoxic T cell and macrophage defects as well as selective impairment of NK cell functions. SCID beige mice are potentially an improved model for receipt of human hematopoietic cells.<br>
Preferred NOD mice are NOD.Cg-RagI,m]Mom Prfl^'/SzJ, NOD.Cg-Prkdcscia 112rgm1w1/szj,NODA29S7{B6)-Ragl"n,Mom/h NOD.Cg-Prkdcscia B2mtmlUnc/) and NOD.CB17-Prkdcscia/Sz]. Every strain lacks mature T and B cells and has no detectable NK cytotoxic activity. The strains support enhanced engraftment with<br>
9<br><br>
human hematopoietic cells has a relatively longer lifespan and is significandy more resistant to irradiation.<br>
Rag2 is essential for the V(D)J gene rearrangements that generate functional antigen receptors in T and B cells; homozygous Rag2-/- mutants have no mature, functional T and B cells. The common gamma (yc) KO mouse lacks functional receptors for many cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. As a consequence lymphocyte development is greatly compromised. The mouse lacks Natural Killer (NK) cells and produces only a small number of T and B cells.<br>
The term human antibody, as used herein, includes antibodies having variable and constant regions (domains) which can be assigned to defined human germ line immunoglobulin sequences because of their high sequence similarity or identity with these germ line sequences. A human antibody encompasses the various forms of antibodies, preferably monoclonal antibodies including but not being limited to whole antibodies, single heavy or light chains, antibody fragments, class-altered antibodies, and genetically engineered antibodies (variant or mutant antibodies) as long as the characteristic properties according to the invention are retained. Especially preferred are recombinant human antibodies. The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to a preparation of antibody molecules all having substantially the same amino acid sequence.<br>
The term "recombinant human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies isolated from a host cell such as a NSO, HEK 293 or CHO cell comprising a recombinant expression vector capable of expessing heavy and/or light chain(s) of said antibody and being transfected into such a host cell. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions in a rearranged form. The recombinant human antibodies according to the invention have been subjected to in vivo somatic hypermutation. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that can be assigned to defined human germ line VH and VL sequences, but may not naturally exist within the human antibody germ line repertoire in vivo.<br>
The "variable region" (variable region of a light chain (VL), variable region of a heavy chain (VH)) as used herein denotes each of the pair of light and heavy chains which is involved directly in binding the antibody to an antigen. The domains of variable human light and heavy chains have the same general structure and each<br>
10<br><br>
domain comprises four framework (FR) regions whose sequences are widely conserved, connected by three "hypervariable regions" (or complementarity determining regions, CDRs). The framework regions adopt a β(beta)-sheet conformation and the CDRs may form loops connecting the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held in their three-dimensional structure by the framework regions and form together with the CDRs from the other chain the antigen binding site. The antibody heavy and light chain CDR3 regions, preferably the heavy chain CDR3, play a particularly important role in the binding specificity/affinity of the antibodies according to the invention and therefore provide a further object of the invention.<br>
The terms "hypervariable region" or "antigen-binding portion of an antibody" when used herein refer to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from the "complementarity determining regions" or "CDRs". "Framework" or "FR" regions are those variable domain regions other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. Therefore, the light and heavy chains of an antibody comprise from N- to C-terminus the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. CDR and FR regions are determined according to the standard definition of Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th ed., Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991).<br>
The "constant domains" are not involved directly in binding of an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chains, antibodies or immunoglobulins are divided in the classes: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g. IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, IgAl and IgA2. The heavy chain constant regions that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called μ,δ, γ, α, and є, respectively. The following examples, references, sequence listing and figures are provided to aid the understanding of the present invention, the true scope of which is set forth in the appended claims. It is understood that modifications can be made in the procedures set forth without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
Isolating of the antibody from the antibody producing cell, ascites, and/or the supernatant can be performed according to the methods known in the state of the art like chromatography Or dialysis. For example the antibody can be purified using one or more of a   method selected from immunoaffinity purification, ammonium<br>
11<br><br>
sulphate precipitation, protein A/G purification, ion exchange chromatography, gel<br>
filtration and/or ammonium sulphate precipitation. Such methods are described in<br>

Instead of hybridoma generation alternative methods can be used for the production of an antibody according to the invention. Suc methods are e.g. based on the identification of the nucleic acid sequence of the antibody. Usually it is sufficient to identify the sequence of the variable regions, the CDR regions or even only the heavy chain CDR3 region. Preferably mRNA is isolated from a pool of antibody producing cells and is used to construct a cDNA-bank coding such region(s) in an appropriate expression vector. The cDNA-library is transfected into the host cells such as NSO or CHO and screened for specific antibody production and specific clones are identified and isolated and used for the antibody production without hybridoma generation.<br>
FL cells are stem cells that are capable of developing into various blood cell types e.g., B cells, T cells, granulocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes. Human hematopoietic fetal liver stem cells commonly express the surface antigen(s) CD31, CD34, CD117 (c-kit) and/or CD 133. According to the invention there is used preferably a FL cell expressing CD133. As FL cell also a precursor cell (i.e. embryonic stem cell) can be used which develops after treatment with cytokines into a FL cell.<br>
FL cells expressing CD133 can be isolated from human fetal liver and are further separated by CD 133 lineage, preferably by an immunomagnetic separation procedure e.g. Miltenyi "MACS® separation system". Another preferred method of isolating FL cells includes the additional steps of labeling the monocytes with a biotin-conjugated CD133 antibody and recovering a CD133 positive stem cell population.<br>
Mice carrying a null mutation of cytokine receptor common gamma chain (γc) on the X chromosome have been described by DiSanto, J.P. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 (1995) 377-381. yc1' females can be crossed with males homozygous for a mutation disrupting the RAG2 gene (Shinkai, Y. et al., Cell 68 (1992) 855-867). Fl males heterozygous for RAG2 deletion and hemizygous for γc deletion can be backcrossed onto γc*'-RAG2+'+females.  The RAG2  genotype of the resulting<br>
12<br><br>
offspring can be determined by tail DNA PCR (Horton, R.M. et al., BioTechniques 19 (1995) 690-691). RAG2 heterozygotes are bred to produce the yc*/*RAG2"/' female and yc"/yRAG2'/" male mice (yc7RAG2). These mice have a mixed background of 129 Ola, Balb/c and C57BL/6.<br>
Immunoreconstitution according to the invention occurs by transplantation of appropriate amounts of human FL cells into the liver of newborn and pre-irradiated immu no deficient animals e.g. mice or rat.<br>
The human monoclonal antibodies according to the invention can be produced by immunizing an immunoreconstituted non-human animal according to the invention, preferably an immunoreconstituted rodent, most preferably an immunoreconstituted rat or mouse, with a purified or enriched preparation of the antigen, nucleic acid encoding said antigen and/or cells expressing said antigen. B cells (e.g. splenic B cells) of the animal are then obtained and fused with an appropriate human fusion partner, like a myeloma cell to form immortal, hybridoma cells that secrete human monoclonal antibodies against the antigen via fusion with an appropriate human fusion partner, like a myeloma cell or by immortalization of said cells with e.g. EBV. For example, soluble antigens or fragments thereof are optionally conjugated to other molecules, and used as immunogens for generating antibodies. For transmembrane molecules, such as receptors, fragments of these (e.g. the extracellular domain of a receptor) can be used as the immunogen. Alternatively, cells expressing the transmembrane molecule can be used as the immunogen. Such cells can be derived from a natural source (e.g. cancer cell lines) or may be cells which have been transformed by recombinant techniques to express the transmembrane molecule. Other antigens and forms thereof useful for preparing antibodies will be apparent to those in the art.<br>
Preferably, the immunoreconstituted non-human animal will be 6-16 weeks of age upon the first immunization. For example, a purified or enriched preparation of DNA encoding the antigen ofinterest (e.g. CD20 or HER3 antigen) can be used to immunize the immunereconstituted non-human animal according to the invention intramuscular. The immune response can be monitored over the course of the immunization protocol with plasma samples being obtained by retroorbital bleeds. The plasma can be screened by ELISA , and immunoreconstituted non-human with sufficient titers of antibodies against said antigen can be used for immortalization of corresponding B cells. Mice can be boosted intravenously with the antigen of<br>
13<br><br>
interest before sacrifice and removal of the spleen and lymph nodes and peripheral blood. It was found that 2-3 fusions for each antigen may need to be performed. Several mice will be immunized for each antigen.<br>
The mouse lymphocytes can be isolated and fused with a human- or heteromyeloma cell using PEG or electrofusion based on standard protocols to generate hybridomas. Electrofusion is based upon a reversible structural change of the cell membranes, which is caused by the effects of an electrical field and is applicable for a wide spectrum of cells for fusion of two or more cells of the same or different origins, including their complete structures (nucleus, membranes, organelle, cell plasma) to create a new, viable cell.<br>
The resulting hybridomas are then screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. For example, single cell suspensions of splenic and lymph node-derived lymphocytes from immunized mice are fused to K6H6/B5 nonsecreting heteromyeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1823). Cells are plated at approximately 2 x 105 in flat bottom microtiter plate, followed by about two weeks incubation in selective medium.<br>
Individual wells are then screened by ELISA for human monoclonal antibodies against the antigen (e.g. IgG). Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium is analyzed, usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas are replated, screened again, and if still positive for human monoclonal antibodies against the antigen, can be subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones are then cultured in vitro to produce antibody in tissue culture medium for characterization.<br>
The antigen may be introduced into the animal by any suitable means. Preferably, the animal is immunised intrasplenically, intravenously, intraperitoneally, intradermally intramuscular, subcutaneously alone or in combination with appropriate immunomodulate agents (e.g. CFA). Dose of each antigen should referably be in the range of between 1 -500 ug.<br>
Preferably, the method of the invention comprises the additional step of supplying the animal with a booster dose of the antigen 1-500 ug a booster 7-28 days after the last injection. Preferably, the animals are boosted 1 to 5 times.<br>
Immunisation of the animal may be carried out with or without pharmaceutical carriers. Suitable carriers are e.g. IFA, A13(0H)4, Abisco.<br>
14<br><br>
Additionally, these carriers may function as immunostimulating agents ("adjuvants"). Immunisation of the animal may be carried out with or without adjuvants in addition to the pharmaceutical carriers.<br>
Preferred adjuvants to enhance effectiveness of the composition include, but are not limited to: e.g. CFA, IFA, Al3(OH)4, Abisco.<br>
Preferred antibody-producing cells for use in the invention include B cells. These antibody- producing cells for use in the invention may be recovered by removal of any suitable cellular components of the immune system from the animal. Preferably, antibody-producing cells are recovered from the animal by removal of the spleen, lymph nodes, peripheral blood or bone marrow or portions thereof.<br>

Braunschweig, Germany) at 2 Gy/min., a dose that was titrated to be sublethal At 4-12 hours post irradiation, mice were transplanted with e.g. CD133+ FL cells alone or in combination with non hematopoietic CD133' liver cells in25ul PBS or in combination with growth factors into the liver (i.h.) using a 30-gauge needle (Hamilton Bonaduz AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland). Newborns always received cells from single donors. Mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age. Analysis of mice: to obtain peripheral blood cells and plasma, mice were bled from retroorbital venous sinus under ether anesthesia.<br>
Flow cytometric analysis and cell sorting. For FACS analysis and cell sorting monoclonal antibodies, biotinylated or conjugated with either FITC, PE, or APC against the following antigens were used: CD3 (UCHT1), CD4 (13B8.2), CD8(B9.11), CD40 (MAB89), CD80 (MAB104), CD83 (HB15a), CD86 (HA5.2B7) (all Imunotech/Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France), CD19 (HIB19), CD20 (2H7), CD34(581), IL-3Ra/CD123 (9F5), CDllc (B-ly6) CD14 (M5E2) (all BD Pharmingen, SanDiego, CA), CD45 (HI30), CD45RA (MEM56), HLA-DR (TU36) (all Caltag, Burlingame, CA), TLR2 (TL2.1), TLRR4 (HTA125), TCRab (IP26), (alleBioscience, San Diego, CA), BDCA-1, BDCA-2, BDCA-4, CD25 (4E3) (allMiltenyi Biotec), IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), CCR7 (3D12, provided by M. Lipp, Berlin, Germany). The IOTest Beta Mark was used for Vbanalysis (Imunotech/Beckman Coulter). Streptavidin conjugated FITC, PE, or APC(all BD Pharmingen) were used for visualization of biotinylated antibodies. Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide staining. Appropriate isotype-matched, irrelevant control mAbs were used to determine the level of background staining. Cells were analyzed using a FACS calibur and sorted using a FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View, CA).<br>
