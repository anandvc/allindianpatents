FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The objective of the present invention relates to optically pure 1-alkyl/aryl-l-phenyl-2-methylaminopropanols and their preparation by addition of alkyl/aryl Grignard reagents to chiral l-phenyl-2-methylamino-l-propanone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
l-Alkyl/aryl-l-phenyl-2-methylaminopropanols are a class of organic compounds belonging to the category of phenylaminoalcohols. These phenylaminoalcohols are widely used in pharmaceutical industry as decongestants, analgesics, bronchodilators and mydriatics. Ephedrine, (lR,2S)-(-)-l -phenyl-2-aminomethylpropanol is one such compound in this group with decongestant activity. Except ephedrine, no other optically pure l-alkyl/aryl-l-phenyl-2-methylaminopropanols are reported in the literature.<br>
In the prior art, the preparation of racemic l-alkyl-l-phenyl-2-methylaminopropanols from racemic 2-methylaminopiopiophenone through Grignard reactions is reported in J.Am.Chem.Soc, Vol. 64, pp. 2451-2452, pp. 533-536. The study of physiological properties of these compounds revealed that the presence of alkyl group in the a-position of l-phenyl-2-methylaminopropanols lowers the toxicity without significant loss of therapeutic activity. For this study, the starting material, racemic-2-methylamino- propiophenone was synthesized from phenacylbromide and hexamine. Racemic means a mixture of 50% d-isomer and 50% /-isomer with an optical rotation of 0Â°.<br>
In yet another prior art, Patent no: 302,940 (France) describes a method for the preparation of ephedrine by synthetic process via 2-methylaminopropiophenone from propiophenone by bromination and condensation with methylamine followed by reduction. The 2-methylaminopropiophenone obtained from this process is also a racemic mixture.<br>
In the synthesis of chiral molecules, especially in drugs, it is extremely important to isolate the compound with high optical purity as presence of other isomer is regarded as an undesirable impurity. This is because, in some cases, enantiomers differ widely in their therapeutic properties. For example, dextro-propoxyfene is an analgesic agent while levo-propoxyfene is devoid of any analgesic properties but is an effective antitussive agent. The development of a chiral molecule requires multiple skills and expertise since their preparation depends primarily on the nature and properties of the molecule. The possible approaches are based on two basic concepts of either introducing chirality in the synthetic route or by appropriate resolution of racemic mixtures.<br>
Resolution of racemic mixtures using chiral reagents including acids and bases is a well known and much-used method. A number of commercially important products have been developed, such as S-naproxen, S-ibuprofen, S-omeprazole, R-fluoxetine etc. by employing the resolution procedure. In this method the synthesis of racemic molecules and their resolution to single enantiomers affords the advantage of evaluating<br><br>
both isomers for therapeutic activity.     At the same time the processes are often ineffective, particularly, when kinetic resolution is not possible.<br>
The best possible way of introducing chirality in a synthetic sequence would be to use either a natural product or a product derived from inexpensive fermentation/microbial synthesis with the desired chiral characteristics which can then be chemically modified. It has the advantage that the conversions can result better yields with little loss of material since the unwanted isomer is not involved. Asymmetric induction on aminoketones is possible through Grignard reactions.<br>
The Grignard reaction is an organometallic chemical reaction involving alkyl- or aryl-magnesium halides (also referred as Grignard reagents) as electrophiles. These reactions are versatile tools in organic chemistry to increase the number of carbons in the molecules. Alkylation at the carbonyl caibon of a ketone leads to a tertiary alcohol through a Grignard reaction. When the a-carbon with respect to the carbonyl group of a ketone is asymmetric, a new chiral centre can be formed at the reaction site during Grignard reaction.<br>
J.Am.Chem.Soc, Vol. 75, pp. 4458-4461, discloses asymmetric induction during Grignard synthesis of the P-dialkylaminopropiophenones and a-alkyl-P-dialkylamino-propiophenones using benzylmagnesium chloride to give the tert-carbinol viz., 4-dialkyl-amino-l,2-diphenyl-2-butanols predominantly as one diastereoisomer, either a or p. The optical purities of the compounds isolated are not mentioned in the report.<br>
In J.Organomet.Chem., Vol. 88, No. 3, pp. 303-314, correlation of the structure of Grignard reagents and the stereochemistry of the addition reaction with a variety of a-aminoketones is revealed. The study inferred that the stereoselectivity decreased with increasing size of the halide ion and also depends on the degree of solvation or aggregation of the Grignard reagent by the solvent. But the products obtained are racemates with the same configurations at both asymmetric carbons or with opposite configuration at asymmetric carbons.<br>
Acta.Chim.Acad.Sci.Hung., Vol. 68, No. 3, pp. 253-259; Chem.Abstr., 75: 20720 . decsribes a method for preparation of 3-substituted-3-tropanols by Grignard reactions of the corresponding aminoketones. All the phenylketo bases yield only one of the two possible diastereoisomeric 1-phenyl-l-methyl-3-aminopropan-1-ol while the corresponding methylketo bases yield the other diastereoisomer. The ratios of mixture of diastereoisomers are determined and the steric configurations assigned.<br>
Tetrahedron Lett., Vol.13, pp. 2329-2332, provides the synthesis of several pure erythro-and threo-aminoalcohols by reduction of the corresponding a-aminoketone with lithium aluminium hydride as well as by the treatment of the corresponding a-aminoaldehydes with Grignard reagents. The erythro/threo product ratio is dependent on<br>
the size of the NR2 group.<br>
Tetrahedron, Vol. 25, pp. 4211-4216 describes a study on the stereospecific synthesis of (+) or (-)-l-phenyl-l,2-dimethyl-3-dimethylaminopropanols using suitable<br><br>
Grignard reagents with phenylketo base (1) or methylketo base (II). The stereochemistry of Mannich keto bases is reported in order to clarify the stereochemistry of reactions between a-substituted P-aminoketones and Grignard reagent. The absolute configuration of (+)-a-methyl-p-dimethylaminopropiophenone is found to be S by chemical correlation with (R)-(-)-a-methyl-P-alanine.<br>
In Tetrahedron Lett., Vol. 31, No. 38, pp. 5479-5482, 1990, a selective synthesis of either enantiomer of tertiary alcohol starting from the same chiral carbonyl compound by a suitable choice of organometallic reagent has been reported. In this method, the unique affinity of sulfur atom to metals has been exploited.<br>
Cram and Elhafez in 1952, describe in detail (J.Am.Chem.Soc, Vol.74, pp. 5828-5835) the "Cram's rule" of steric control of asymmetric induction applicable in correlating and predicting the stereochemistry of asymmetric induction in reactions of acyclic systems in which a new asymmetric centre is created adjacent to an old one.<br>
Tetrahedron Lett., Vol. 32, No. 25, pp. 2919-2922, 1991 discloses that the reaction of chiral 2-acyloxazolidines, derived from S-prolinol, with organometallics was found to be diastereoselective giving rise to S-or R-tertiary alcohols depending on the organometallic reagent used.<br>
Further in the Angew.Chem.Int.Ed., 2004, Vol. 43, pp. 284-287, a method for synthesis of a variety of chiral tertiary alcohols by catalytic enantioselective addition of unreactive zinc reagents to poorly electrophilic ketones in presence of a chiral ligand is described in excellent diastereoselectivity.<br>
Thus in the prior art, chiral tertiary alcohols are prepared using Grignard and organometallic reagents. The application of the Crams rule is used to predict the stereochemistry of the resultant alcohols. Excellent enantioselectivity was observed only when chiral catalysts were employed. But no reports were found on optically pure 1 -alkyl/aryl-1 -phenyl-2-methylaminopropanol hydrochlorides and their method of preparation.<br>
The present invention relates to the compounds of the Structural formula -1<br><br>
namely optically pure l-alkyl/aryl-l-phenyl-2-methylaminopropanol hydrochloride wherein R is alkyl and aryl group.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (1) in which the compound corresponding to structural formula (2)<br><br><br>
namely chiral l-phenyl-2-methylamino-l-propanone are subjected to treatment with aiyl/alkyl Grignard reagent in the presence of organic solvents leading to only one of the diastereomer either erythro/threo in high optical purity (99-100%) and yield (65-75%) as the first crop<br>
Specifically, the object of the present invention is to provide a new process for optically pure alkyl/aryl-1 -phenyl-2-methylaminopropanol hydrochlorides by stereospecific addition of aryl/alkyl Grignard reagent to the chiral 1-phenyl-2-methylamino-1-propanone after liberating the base from the corresponding hydrochloride salts, in the presence of organic solvents<br><br><br>

Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process to isolate optically alkyl/aryl-l-phenyl-2-methylaminopropanol hydrochlorides in 65-75% yield as the first crop.<br>

To this, n-pentyl bromide (46g, 0.3 mol) dissolved in diethyl ether was added slowly in 2 h to initiate the reaction. After complete addition, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 4 h. To the n-pentylmagnesium bromide, (2R)-(+)-l -phenyl-2-methylamino-1 -propanone (lOg, 0.0613 mol) dissolved in diethyl ether was added slowly in 1 h at 30-35 Â°C. The reaction products were further stirred for 8 h. The completion of the reaction was monitored using thin layer chromatography [ethyl acetate 2, hexane 8].<br><br>
The reaction was quenched in saturated aq. NH4CI (5g in 15 mL of water) and was extracted in 50 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether. The ether layer was dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated under vacuum. To the concentrated mass, diethyl ether (25 mL) was added and dry HC1 was passed till it became acidic to a pH of 3.0. Pale white precipitate was obtained was filtered and recrystallised by using acetone. Pure white solid of eiythro-(lS,2R)-(+)-l-w-pentyl-l-phenyl-2-methylaminopropanol hydrochloride was obtained.<br><br>
