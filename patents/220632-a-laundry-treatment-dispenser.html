COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
FOAM AND/OR MIST DISPENSER<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,      165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
,WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
FOAM AND/OR MIST DISPENSER<br>
The present invention concerns a device and method of treating a laundry fabric with a foam or mist dispenser, in <br>
5   which a colour change is associated with a function of the treatment product.<br>
Treatment specific areas of fabrics, textiles etc is often carried out by consumers to remove tough stains and soils, <br>
10  and this may precede a main washing process.<br>
Devices for the treatment e.g. pretreatment prior to a xmain wash' hand washing of laundry are known and include e.g. solid detergent bars, detergent liquids.  Some devices which <br>
15  have trigger or aerosol spray devices for spraying the liquid on fabric.<br>
However, solid bars and abrasive tools can be too harsh for treatment of delicate fabrics.  Further, these types of<br>
20  devices often require a generally flat working surface to support fabrics whilst they are scrubbed.  Many consumers have limited space so  that treatment of fabrics on a flat surface in not possible.  Consumers often therefore resort to resting the garment on a knee or tummy, and with many<br>
25  known devices this carries the risk of applying the laundry composition to there body or their clothing, which is undesirable.<br>
A further problem is that some fabric items, e.g. due to <br>
30  their construction, may not be easily flattened for treatment / washing on a flat surface.<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
A particular problem is that pretreatment products are often difficult to apply precisely and so are common applied indiscriminately.  This often leads to more product being applied than is actually necessary to remove a particular <br>
5	  stain.  Such over dosing is environmentally undesirable (especially as pretreatment products can be highly concentrated)  and results in the pretreatment product running out quicker than expected.  As a result, the consumer perceives the product to be overly expensive for <br>
10   the amount of usage provided and may not buy the product<br>
  again.  This is, of course, undesirable to the manufacturer.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a pretreatment device and method, which overcomes or at least alleviates <br>
15    the above problems.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention provides a laundry treatment dispenser in combination with a laundry liquid, for dispensing a mixture of the laundry liquid and a <br>
20   gas gas (preferably air), as a coloured foam and/or mist, the dispenser comprising:<br>
a flexible container for the fluids including a conduit having first and second end portions, the first end portion terminating in an opening in the container <br>
25	  through which the foam and /or mist is expelled from the container and the second open end portion being close to the base of said container, wherein the conduit includes a third open end portion which is located close to the top of the container and laterally inclined or opposed to <br>
30     the second open end portion;<br>
  and the laundry liquid comprising:<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
(i)   a pH dependent chromophore, the pH dependent<br>
chromophore having a UV-vis spectrum that changes with<br>
pH in the range 1 to 14; and,<br>
(ii)	a pH changing means. <br>
5<br>
In a second aspect the invention provides a method of treating a fabric, by applying a coloured laundry foam and/or mist to a selected region of a fabric such as a stained or soiled region using the combination of the first<br>
10   aspect of the invention.<br>
The foam and/or mist may undergo a colour change following application.<br>
15  Accordingly, the method of treatment of the second aspect of the invention may incorporate the steps of waiting until the foam, as applied, has changed colour from its originally applied colour followed by rinsing the portion of the fabric to which the foam has been applied with water; and then<br>
20  drying the textile and/or carrying out a further washing process or processes.<br>
Such further washing processes main include e.g. a â€˜main' wash e.g. in an washing machine whereby the method of the <br>
25  second aspect acts as a pretreatment for stain removal on specific areas of the fabric.<br>
In a third aspect the invention provides a kit for treating fabric, the kit comprising the combination of device and <br>
30  laundry liquid according to the first aspect, together with<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCTYEP2004/013961<br><br>
4   -<br>
instructions for use according to the second aspect of the invention.<br>
In a fourth aspect, the invention provides a method of <br>
5  treating a fabric according to the second aspect of the<br>
invention, the method comprising an initial step of mixing a concentrated laundry composition comprising:<br>
(i)	a pH dependent chromophore, the pH dependent chromophore having a UV-vis spectrum that changes with <br>
10     pH in the range 1 to 14; and, <br>
       (iii) a pH changing means.<br>
    with a solvent such as water in the device to form a liquid for formation of the coloured foam/mist. <br>
15<br>
The laundry concentrate may be a liquid, gel, paste or solid concentrate.<br>
1.	In a fifth aspect, the invention provides a kit for <br>
20      treating fabric, the kit comprising a laundry treatment dispenser and a laundry concentrate, for dispensing a mixture of a laundry liquid and a gas (preferably air) as a coloured foam and/or mist, the dispenser comprising: a flexible container for the mixture including a conduit <br>
25	  having first and second end portions, the first end portion terminating in an opening in the container through which the foam and /or mist is expelled from the container and the second open end portion being close to the base of said container, wherein the conduit includes <br>
30     a third open end portion which is located close to the<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   5   -<br>
top of the container and laterally inclined or opposed to<br>
the second open end portion;<br>
and the laundry concentrate comprising:<br>
(i)	a pH dependent chromophore, the pH dependent <br>
5	     chromophore having a UV-vis spectrum that changes with pH in the range 1 to 14; and, <br>
(ii)	a pH changing means together with instructions for use according to the method according to the fourth aspect of the invention. <br>
10<br>
The various kit instructions referred to herein may comprise any one or any combination of, visual indicia e.g. text, on the pack, in supplementary / separate materials e.g. leaflets, coupons and which may be sold separately or e.g. <br>
15      in TV commercials.<br>
If a solid-solvent mixture is used to form the laundry liquid, it may be desirable to include filters preferably on the first and second free ends of the conduit to prevent <br>
20    undissolved solid matter being dispensed on to the fabric.<br>
 By the term "solid" it is intended to include powder, granules, agglomerates, crushed tablets or tablet like objects or the like or any combination thereof.<br>
25<br>
The combination of the device with its arrangement of openings together with a coloured foam and / or mist, provides an elegant, inexpensive foam treatment device which can be used to dispense the coloured foam to allow precise<br>
30  treating of a selected region of a fabric, with minimal waste and expense for the consumer and environment.<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
The device can be used independently of a work surface and accurately.  This is due to the combination of a device which can function in any orientation, upright (top above base)or inverted (since the openings are at the top and <br>
5	bottom i.e. opposed ends of the device), or tilted sideways due to the orientation of the the openings (since the second and third conduit openings are mutually laterally inclined or opposed); and the coloured foam and/or mist produced to allow targeting in precise registration with a selected<br>
10   area.  The user can simply suspend the item (away from their body) and spray the foam/mist solution to difficult to reach parts from below or above or a side as  necessary, accurately and without having to maintain the dispenser upright and without having to guess where the spray has been applied due<br>
15  to the colour.<br>
The invention also provides a highly cost effective foam dispenser which does not require complicated or expensive foaming elements in the flow path of the liquid or pump<br>
20  mechanisms.  This greatly simplifies the device and reduces cost.  No aerosol propellant is required reducing the environmental impact of the device.  A coloured foam can be ejected from the container simply by squeezing the container body.<br>
25<br>
The laundry Fluid / Composition<br>
The colour cue of the present invention is provided by a pH dependent chromophore; the colour of the pH dependent <br>
30  chromophore is dependent upon the acidity or the alkalinity of its environment.<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
The colour is apparent when the compostion is present in an aqueous medium or exposed to the atmosphere.  Therefore the composition may be provided in a coloured state or require dissolution in an aqueous medium preferably water or <br>
5  exposure to the atmosphere.<br>
Laundry treatment compositions for stain removal preferably comprise a detergent composition.  Detergent compositions are formulated to a high pH and the colour may also serve to <br>
10  indicate that the detergent product is functioning at the optimum pH.<br>
The pH dependent chromophore may be maintained at a different pH during storage of the product than when the<br>
15  product is in use.  An example of this would be maintaining phenolphthalein, a pH dependent chromophore, at a pH below 8 in a detergent product comprising sodium carbonate so that the phenolphthalein is colourless.  Upon addition of the detergent product to water the phenolphthalein is released<br>
20  into the aqueous medium whilst the basic sodium carbonate<br>
raises, upon dissolution, the pH of the water environment in the range 8.2 to 10.0 causing the water to take a pink hue. Thus, a colourless detergent powder containing phenolphthalein could be mixed with water by the user,<br>
25  within the dispenser of the invention to create a coloured solution which is then applied to the fabric as  a coloured foam and/or mist for accurate treatment of the fabric so as to focus on specific stains, areas (collars cuffs).<br>
30  The amount of the basic component in the laundry detergent may be such that the acidity of the cloth dirt (e.g., sebum)<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
serves to shift the pH of the wash liquor during use such that the phenolphthalein loses its pink colour giving an indication of completeness of the treatment process to the consumer.  Alternatively, a time release component is added <br>
5   to the laundry such that the colour changes or is removed during treatment or a subsequent wash as the pH changes.<br>
It is preferred that the pH dependent chromophore is segregated from the bulk of the material when the commercial<br>
10  product is a solid.  However, it is also envisaged that in certain circumstances that the pH dependent chromophore may be encapsulated when the commercial product is a liquid, for example as a coacevated particle. The environment of the pH dependent chromophore may be controlled by the use of a<br>
15  coacevated particle.  The internal surface of the coacevated particle may be neutral, acidic or alkaline wherein the pH dependent chromophore is located.  During dispensing of the product by the consumer, the coacevated particle can be ruptured (e.g. by a appropriately sized nozzle on the outlet<br>
20  of the device) bringing the pH dependent chromophore into<br>
contact with the remainder of the product resulting in a pH change to the pH dependent chromophore.  Alternatively, the pH dependent chromophore is segregated as a particle/granule that is coated with a wax or paraffin.<br>
25<br>
The segregation of the pH dependent chromophore as  described above serves to protect the pH dependent chromophore from oxidising materials, if present, and alkaline/acidic conditions.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
In contrast to the pH changes discussed above, another way of changing the pH is to use a pH jump liquid formulation. It is preferred that the pH dependent chromophore when used in a pH jump liquid is not encapsulated. <br>
5<br>
The pH dependent composition may absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at dispensing, which results in a pH change which in turn results in the foam changing colour.  In this aspect segregation of the pH dependent chromophore is not <br>
10  necessary.<br>
In one embodiment, the laundry composition comprises a pH dependent chromophore that has a different pH environment to the bulk of the formulation in a solid format.  The<br>
15   different pH environment may be provided by a binder or environment thereof.  Upon dissolution of the composition the pH dependent chromophore is subjected to a pH environment different to that prior to use.  In this regard, the bulk may be alkaline and the pH dependent chromophore<br>
20    present in a neutral or acidic environment; this is the<br>
preferred format.  Alternatively, the bulk may be acidic and the pH dependent chromophore present in an alkaline or neutral environment.<br>
25   The pH dependent Chromophore<br>
Many pH dependent chromophores are commonly referred to as indicators.  However, it is not essential that the pH dependent chromophore is reversible in its colour change. In this regard, pH dependent chromophores other than an <br>
30  indicator may be used. Below is found a Table in which<br><br>
WO 2005/058712	PCT/EP2004/013961<br>
-   10   -<br>
examples of various pH dependent chromophores (indicators) are found.  There are many standard texts available that give lists of pH dependent chromophores (indicators).<br><br>

pH Dependent Fluorescent Indicator<br>
  Some fluorescent indicators would not be suitable for use in the present invention because of their toxicity and as a <br>
10  result any fluorescent indicator chosen need meet the<br>
criteria of being biologically acceptable to the environment and humans. The following are examples that may be employed for use with the present invention.<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
Quinine is a fluorescent indicator changing in the pH range 3.0 to 5.0 from blue to weak violet and further changing in the pH range 9.5 to 10.0 from weak violet non-fluorescent. Salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone is a fluorescent indicator 5  changing in the pH range 8.4 from non-fluorescent to fluorescent yellow.<br>
Acridine orange is a fluorescent indicator changing in the pH range 8.4 to 10.4 from non-fluorescent to fluorescent yellow/Green. 10<br>
There are many standard texts available that give lists of fluorescent indicators.<br>
A mixture of pH dependent chromophores and/or fluorescent 15  indicators may be used in the present invention.<br>
The amount of the pH dependent chromophores and/or fluorescent indicators present in the composition will vary depending on the extinction coefficient/colour intensity of<br>
20  the indicator required.  The amount of pH dependent<br>
chromophore having a UV-vis spectrum that changes with pH in the range 1 to 14 required is that sufficient for a discernable change in colour/fluorescence to be observable by the human eye.  Suitably, the pH dependent chromophores<br>
25  and/or fluorescent indicator, or mixtures thereof, is<br>
present in the composition in the range 0.0001 to 0.5 wt %, preferably 0.001 to 0.4 wt %, most preferably 0.002 to 0.3 wt %.<br><br>

Suitable polymers which meet the above criteria and are therefore particularly useful in the present invention, include those having the following empirical formula I<br><br>
wherein X is 0 or CH2; Y is a comonomer or comonomer mixture; Rl and R2 are bleach-stable polymer-end groups; R3 is H, OH or Cl-4 alkyl; M is H, and mixtures thereof with<br>

Polymers according to formula I are known in the field of laundry detergents, and are typically used as chelating agents. Preferred polycarboxylate polymers fall into several<br>
20  categories.  A first category belongs to the class of<br>
copolymeric polycarboxylate polymers which, formally at least, are formed from an unsaturated polycarboxylic acid such as maleic acid, citraconic acid, itaconic acid and mesaconic acid as first monomer, and an unsaturated<br>
25  monocarboxylic acid such as acrylic acid or an alpha -C1-C4 alkyl acrylic acid as second monomer. Referring to formula I, therefore, preferred polycarboxylate polymers of this<br><br>
WO 2005/058712	PCT/EP2004/013961<br>
-   17   -<br>
type are those in which X is CHO, R3 is H or Cl-4 alkyl, especially methyl, p is from about 0.1 to about 1.9, preferably from about 0.2 to about 1.5, n averages from about 10 to about 1500, preferably from about 50 to about <br>
5    1000, more preferably from 100 to 800, especially from 120  to 400 and Y comprises monomer units of formula II<br><br>
10  Such polymers are available from BASF under the trade name SokalanÂ® CP5 (neutralised form) and SokalanÂ® CP45 (acidic form).<br>
A second category belongs to the class of polycarboxylate <br>
15  polymers in which referring to formula I, X is CH2, R3 is OH, p is from 0 to 0.1, preferably 0 and n averages from about 50 to about 1500, preferably from about 100 to 1000.<br>
Y, if present, can be a polycarboxylic acid such as II <br>

A third category belongs to the class of acetal polycarboxylate polymers in which, referring to formula I, X is (OR4)2, where R4 is C1-C4 alkyl, R3 is H, p is from 0 to <br>
25  0.1, preferably 0 and n averages from 10 to 500. If present, Y again can be a polycarboxylic acid such as II above or an ethyleneoxide moiety.<br><br>

A fourth category belongs to the class of polycarboxylate polymers in which referring to formula I, X is CH2, R3 is H or Cl-4 alkyl, p is 0 and n averages from about 10 to 1500, preferably from about 500 to 1000. <br>

A fifth category of polycarboxylate polymers has the formula I in which X is CH2, R3 is H or Cl-4 alkyl, especially methyl, p is from 0.01 to 0.09, preferably from 0.02 to 0.06, n averages from about 10 to about 1500, preferably <br>
10  from about 15 to about 300 and Y is a polycarboxylic acid<br>
formed from maleic acid, citraconic acid, mitaconic acid or mesaconic acid, highly preferred being maleic acid-derived comonomers of formula II above.<br>
15  Suitable polymer end groups in formula I suitably include alkyl groups, oxyalkyl groups and alkyl carboxylic acid groups and salts and esters thereof.<br>
In formula I above, M is H or mixtures thereof with alkali 20  metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium or substituted<br>
ammonium. The proportion of M which is H is such as to ensure that the polymer meets the pH criteria described herein above.<br>
25  In the above, n, the degree of polymerization of the polymer can be determined from the weight average polymer molecular weight by dividing the latter by the average monomer molecular weight.  Thus, for a maleic-acrylic copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 15,500 and<br>
30  comprising 30 mole % of maleic acid derived units, n is 182 (i.e. 15,00/(116 x 0.3 + 72 x 0.7).<br><br>

15  preferably at least 120, and a low molecular weight<br>
component having an n value of less than 100, preferably from 10 to 90, more preferably from 20 to 80. Such mixtures are optimum from the viewpoint of providing excellent bleach stability and anti-incrustation performance in the context<br>
20  of a zerophosphate detergent formula.<br>
In mixtures of this type, the weight ratio of high molecular weight component to low molecular weight component is generally at least hi, preferably from about 1:1 to about <br>
25  20:1, more preferably from about 1.5:1 to about 10.1, especially from about 2:1 to about 8:1.<br>
Preferred polycarboxylate polymers of the low molecular weight type are polycarboxylate polymers of the fourth <br>
30  category (homopolyacrylate polymers) listed above.<br><br>

10  EP 351 629.<br>
Air as the pH changing means<br>
The dispensed foam or mist may interact with the <br>
15	environment.  Foam has a high surface area to volume ratio and rapidly absorbs air from the atmosphere resulting in a pH change of the foam.  If the foam is alkaline the pH of the foam decreases as carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere.  When the appropriate pH dependent chromophore <br>
20   is present a colour change is observed providing a visual colour change.<br>
In this case the foam dispenser itself provides the pH changing means by dispensing the foam to a carbon dioxide<br>
25  containing environment (the atmosphere).  However, the foam needs to be coloured as soon as possible, so as to allow application of a coloured foam to a predetermined fabric area, rather than wait for the foam to colour after application. Preferably, the bulk within the foam dispenser<br>
30  is in contact with atmospheric gases for fast colouring of<br><br>

Anionic Surfactant, Non-ionic surfactant and Amphoteric 5  Surfactants or mixtures thereof may be used in this<br>
embodiment.  Examples of suitable surfactants systems that may be used for the foam are as follows: sodium lauryl slkyl sulphate (LAS), sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) and coco amidopropyl betaine (CAPB); sodium<br>
10  lauryl alkyl sulphate (LAS) non-ionic (NI) and coco<br>
amidopropyl betaine (CAPB); primary alcohol sulphate (PAS), sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) and coco amidopropyl betaine (CAPB); primary alcohol sulphate (PAS), sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) and non-ionic (NI); and sodium<br>
15  lauryl alkyl sulphate (LAS) and non-ionic (NI).<br>
pH Jump Compositions<br>
The present invention may be used as a liquid format where <br>
20  the pH of the commercial product is substantially different to that in use.<br>
Sorbitol/borate compositions are known from EP 381 262. In a concentrated solution the borate is complexed with the<br>
25  vicinal diol of the sorbitol; upon dilution of the<br>
sorbitol/borate composition the borate is liberated from its interaction with the sorbitol resulting in a pH jump. Other pH Jump formulations are disclosed in US 6,509,308 and US 5,484,555.<br>

-   22   -<br>
The composition preferably comprises a surfactant and optionally other conventional detergent ingredients. It is most preferred that the detergent composition is alkaline. <br>
5    This alkalinity is preferably provided for by sodium<br>
carbonate. The invention in its second aspect provides an enzymatic detergent composition which comprises from 0.1 -50 % by weight, based on the total detergent composition, of one or more surfactants. This surfactant system may in turn<br>
10  comprise 0 - 95 % by weight of one or more anionic<br>
surfactants and 5 to 100 % by weight of one or more nonionic surfactants. The surfactant system may additionally contain amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds, but this in not normally desired owing to their relatively high cost.<br>
15  The enzymatic detergent composition according to the<br>
invention will generally be used as a dilution in water of about 0.05 to 2%.<br>
In general, the nonionic and anionic surfactants of the 20  surfactant system may be chosen from the surfactants<br>
described "Surface Active Agents" Vol. 1, by Schwartz &amp; Perry, Interscience 1949, Vol. 2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, Interscience 1958, in the current edition of "McCutcheon1s Emulsifiers and Detergents" published by Manufacturing <br>
25	Confectioners Company or in "Tenside-Taschenbuch", H. Stache, 2nd Edn., Carl Hauser Verlag, 1981. Suitable nonionic detergent compounds which may be used include, in particular, the reaction products of compounds having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen atom, for <br>
30   example, aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone<br><br>

or with propylene oxide. Specific nonionic detergent compounds are C6-C22 alkyl phenol-ethylene oxide condensates, generally 5 to 25 EO, i.e. 5 to 25 units of ethylene oxide per molecule, and the condensation products of aliphatic C8-<br>
5   C18 primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 5 to 40 EO.<br>
Suitable anionic detergent compounds which may be used are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic<br>
10  sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl radicals containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term alkyl being used to include the alkyl portion of higher acyl radicals. Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates, especially those<br>
15  obtained by sulphating higher C8-C18 alcohols, produced for example from tallow or coconut oil, sodium and potassium alkyl C9-C20 benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl C10-C15 benzene sulphonates; and sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the<br>
20  higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and<br>
synthetic alcohols derived from petroleum. The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium Cu-Cis alkyl benzene sulphonates and sodium C12-Ci8 alkyl sulphates. Also applicable are surfactants such as those described in<br>
25  EP-A-328 177 (Unilever), which show resistance to<br>
salting-out, the alkyl polyglycoside surfactants described in EP-A-070 074, and alkyl monoglycosides.<br>
Preferred surfactant systems are mixtures of anionic with <br>
30  nonionic detergent active materials, in particular the groups and examples of anionic and nonionic surfactants<br><br>

pointed out in EP-A-346 995 (Unilever). Especially preferred is surfactant system that is a mixture of an alkali metal salt of a C16-C18 primary alcohol sulphate together with a C12-C15 primary alcohol 3-7 EO ethoxylate. <br>
5	The nonionic detergent is preferably present in amounts greater than 10%, e.g. 25-90% by weight of the surfactant system. Anionic surfactants can be present for example in amounts in the range from about 5% to about 40% by weight of the surfactant system. <br>

The detergent composition for preparing the solution may take any suitable physical form, such as a powder, granular composition, tablets, a paste or an anhydrous gel.<br>
15  Peroxygen Bleach or Source Thereof<br>
The composition of the present invention may also comprise a peroxygen bleach or source thereof. However the pH dependent chromophores and bleach should be selected for compatability <br>
20  so that he bleach does not impair the colour of the composition at the treatment stage.<br>
Phenolphthalein is a robust chromophore and will colour in most bleach enviroments.<br>
25  The peroxy bleaching species may be a compound, which is capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. Hydrogen peroxide sources are well known in the art.  They include the alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxides such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalts, such as the alkali<br>
30  metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates persilicates<br><br>

and persulphates.  Mixtures of two or more such compounds may also be suitable.<br>
  Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate <br>
5	and, especially, sodium perborate monohydrate.  Sodium perborate monohydrate is preferred because of its high active oxygen content.  Sodium percarbonate may also be preferred for environmental reasons and the fact that it contributes to the alkalinity when dissolved in water.  The<br>
10   amount thereof in the composition of the invention usually will be within the range of about 1-35% by weight, preferably from 5-25% by weight.  One skilled in the art will appreciate that these amounts may be reduced in the presence of a bleach precursor e.g., N,N,N'N'-tetraacetyl<br>
15  ethylene diamine (TAED).<br>
Another suitable hydrogen peroxide generating system is a combination of a C1-C4 alkanol oxidase and a C1-C4 alkanol, especially a combination of methanol oxidase (MOX) and <br>
20  ethanol.  Such combinations are disclosed in International Application PCT/EP 94/03003 (Unilever), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

15  Peroxyacid bleach precursors, used in combination with<br>
peroxygen bleach sources, are known and amply described in literature, such as in the British Patents 836988; 864,798; 907,356; 1,003,310 and 1,519,351; German Patent 3,337,921; EP-A-0185522; EP-A-0174132; EP-A-0120591; and U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>

25<br>
Non-limiting embodiments of the invention are outlined below with reference to the drawings attached hereto.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of one embodiment of the 30      invention.<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   41   -<br>
Referring to figure 1, there is shown a dispenser 1 for dispensing a mixture of two or more fluids 2,4,e.g. laundry solution 2 (which may be any one of foam examples A to J described above) and gas i.e. air 4 as a foam and/or mist. <br>
5    The dispenser 1 comprises a flexible container 6 for<br>
containing the liquid and includes a conduit 8 comprising a dip tube 8a having first and second end portions 11,12 the first end portion 11 terminating in an opening in the container 6 through which the mixture 2,4 is expelled from<br>
10   the container and the second open end portion 12 being close to the base 14  of said container 6, wherein the conduit 8 includes a third open end portion 13 which is located close to the top 16 of the container 6 and laterally inclined or opposed to the second open end portion 12.<br>
15<br>
As the second and third conduit openings 12,13 are both longitudinally and laterally opposed the dispenser 1 operates when it is inverted and tilted sideways.<br>
20  The conduit is kinked or bent (at Y) generally in its upper section 18,  so as to incline the second open end portion 12 approximately 20 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the container 6. The third open end portion 13 extend from an upper section<br>
25	18(ie. Toward the top of the container when it is orientated upright) of the conduit 8, e.g. at right angles. The conduit may have tee (T-shaped) configuration at the top, wherein the third open end portion branches off orthogonally from a main section of the conduit, preferably generally <br>
30   longitudinally aligned.<br><br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   42   -<br>
The conduit comprises a dip tube in co-operation with the screw-on container closure 20 having dispensing opening 22.<br>
The container is flexible by means of a generally flexible <br>
5  body portion 24.  However certain sections e.g. the base 26 and optionally corner portions may have increased rigidity e.g. for increasing strength.<br>
 The dispenser parts may be made of any material suitable for<br>
10  the purpose.  A majority, if not all, of the parts are suitably made from polymeric material.<br>
In use, the dispenser 1 is opened by unscrewing and removing the closure 20 and then filled with between 20 and 70 of<br>
15  laundry detergent powder (as in the Detergent Powder example above but also with the addition of 2.5 g of granules from Example 3) and approximately 150-180 ml water, this is then mixed by shaking the device to form a solution 2 to leave a head space of air 4.<br>
20<br>
The device, as it is to be used with a powder and water solutions, includes a simple filter comprising a mesh covering attached to the first and second ends of the conduit to prevent passage of any undissolved powder<br>
25   therethrough.<br>
After a period of at least 30 seconds, and preferably 1-5 minutes so that the foam has had sufficient time to change colour (to pink).<br>
30 <br>
WO 2005/058712<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013961<br><br>
-   43   -<br>
The container is then simply compressed by squeezing the body portion 24 to expel the coloured foam / mist from the container.  The container can be used in any orientation e.g. inverted, due to the conduit arrangement to e.g.<br>
5  pretreat difficult to reach areas of garments and other<br>
laundry items without need for a support surface or having to maintain the device upright. The colour of the expelled foam/mist allows precise targeting in registration with stains and soiled regions and keeps overdosing to a minimum.<br>
10<br>
The pink colouration can be removed in the following washing operation either by relying on dilution or by additional components in a laundry detergent used in the main wash which increase acidity. Such additional components may<br>
15  comprise e.g. citric acid, polycarboxylates which may be present as coacervated or wax coated particles which break up in the wash.<br>
It is of course to be understood that the invention is not <br>
20  intended to be restricted to the details of the above embodiments which are described by way of example only.<br><br>
