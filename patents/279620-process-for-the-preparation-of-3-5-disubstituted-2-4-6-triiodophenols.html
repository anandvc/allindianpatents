				<td>PROCESS FOR THE IODINATION OF AROMATIC COMPOUNDS<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of iodinated aromatic compounds. In particular, it relates to a process including the electrochemical iodination of 3,5-disubstituted phenols to the corresponding 3,5-disubstituted-2,4,6-triiodophenols, which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of x-ray contrast media, and to the preparation of the contrast media themselves.<br>
<br>
Background<br>
<br>
Lodinated contrast media are well-known compounds widely used in x-ray imaging diagnostic techniques. Suitable examples of the said compounds include, for instance, diatrizoate, iothalamate, ioxithalamate, metrizoate, iohexol, iomeprol, iopamidol, iopentol, iopromide, ioversol, ioxilan, iodixanol, iosarcol, iogulamide, ioglunide, iogluamide, acetrizoate, iodamide, iocetamide and metrizamide, which are all monomeric; while, for example, ioxaglate, iotrolan, iotasul, iodipamide, iocarmate, iodoxamate, iotroxate, iotrolan, and the like, are dimers. Other examples of iodinated contrast agents are described, for instance, in WO 94/14478 (Bracco). As a common feature, their chemical structure shares a triiodinated aromatic nucleus which provides the enhanced contrast effect.<br>
<br>
The said compounds may be prepared by a variety of routes, some of which comprise the aromatic iodination of given substrates, in particular suitable anilines, so as to provide the corresponding 2,4,6-triiodoaniline derivatives, to be further converted and processed to the final compounds.<br>
<br>
Useful precursors for the preparation of the above compounds are also 3,5-disubstituted phenols, which undergo triiodination on the available 2, 4 and 6 positions, at first, so as to give rise to the corresponding 3,5-disubstrtuted-2,4,6-triiodophenols. These Jatter, in turn, may be further converted and processed through the so-called Smile's rearrangement, to the expected final compounds.<br>
<br>
For a general reference to the above synthetic route and Smile's rearrangement see, for instance, WO 88/09328, WO 97/05097 and WO 00/32561 (Bracco). Iodination on the phenol ring may occur at the ortho and para free positions, i.e. at the 2, 4 and 6 positions, according to the well-known electrophilic substitution mechanism, thus leading to the triiodinated ring.<br>
<br>
The iodination step, in particular, may be performed according to several methods known in the art.<br>
<br>
For instance, it can be carried out by using solutions of iodine chloride (ICI) in concentrated hydrociiloric acid (HCI) or, aiternatively, by means of analogous lodinating agents such as, for instance, KICI2 or NalCla in aqueous solution; see, for a genera! reference, WO 92/14695 (Guerbet) or US 5,013,865 (Maliincrodt). The above methods suffer from major drawbacks due to the limited storage life of the iodinating agents and to their corrosive properties. In addition, the presence of chlorine atoms may lead to side-reactions and, thus, to the undesired formation of chlorine side-products, which may affect reaction yields and purity of the final compounds. The above problems may be well addressed according to an alternative path comprising electrochemical iodination of suitable aromatic nuclei. Electrochemical iodination involves, in particular, the anodic formation of T ions from an iodine source, for instance I2 itself, in an electrolytic cell, substantially as per the following Scheme:<br>
and the thus formed T cations may then act as iodinating agents on the aromatic<br>
nucleus of the targeted compound.<br>
<br>
Apart from molecular iodine, a variety of iodides such as alkali metal iodides and even hydriodic acid or their mixtures may be employed as well to electrochemically originate<br>
 species.<br>
<br>
Remarkably,  however, electrochemical  iodination from  I2 source advantageously<br>
provides for two moles of iodinating species originating from 1 mole of iodine source.<br>
In addition, another main advantage offered by said method is that the iodinating<br>
specie may be generated on need, thus avoiding the storage of corrosive reagents.<br>
Moreover, as no chlorine source is present, no chlorination by-products affecting the<br>
purity of the final compound may be thus obtained.<br>
<br>
The electrochemical iodination of aromatic substrates is known in the art as reported, for instance, in J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol. 98, No. 6, 1976, pages 1515-1519; and EP 828705 (Nycomed Imaging As).<br>
According to EP 828705, in particular, it is disclosed a process for the preparation of monomeric   or  dimeric  triiodoaniline  compounds   comprising  the  electrochemical iodination of 3,5-disubstituted anilines or 3,3'-disubstituted-5,5'-linked disinclines. As far as phenols and derivatives thereof are concerned, instead, US 3,833,490 discloses a process for the preparation of herbicides comprising the electrochemical iodination of 4-hydroxybenzonitrile in the presence of 10" ions, so as to provide the corresponding mono- or di-iodinated derivatives bearing iodine atoms in positions 3 and/or 5.<br>
<br>
Remarkably, the above iodination process is directly carried out within the electrolytic cell, that is under the oxidizing conditions existing at the anodic compartment, as the presence of a substituent (e.g. cyano group) in para position with respect to the phenolic hydroxy group may render the above substrate less susceptible of oxidative degradation.<br>
<br>
However, by even carrying out the iodination step outside the electrolytic cell, the iodination of phenol with a iodinating specie electrochemically generated, did not provide the expected results as mixtures of byproducts were instead obtained. Experimental evidence for the same can be found in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 of the following experimental section.<br>
<br>
Despite these major drawbacks concerning the electrochemical iodination of phenols, however, we have unexpectedly found that the electrochemical iodination of given 3,5-disubstituted phenols enabled for the preparation of the corresponding triiodinated compounds.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
<br>
The present invention thus provides a process for the electrochemical iodination of 3,5-di-substituted phenols and, also, a method for the preparation of x-ray contrast agents including the above electrochemical iodination step.<br>
It is therefore a first object of the present Invention a process for the preparation of 3,5-disubstituted-2,4,6-triiodophenols of formula (2), which process comprises:<br>
(a)	electrochemically generating T cations from a suitable iodine source; and<br>
(b)	iodinating 3,5-disubstituted-phenols of formula (1) in the presence of the above r cations of step (a):<br>
<br>
wherein<br>
R and R' represent, the same or different from each other, a group selected from carboxy -COOH, carboxyester -COOR and carboxamido -CONH2, -CONHR or –CONR2 R3 wherein R1 R2 and R3  represent, the same or different from each other, a straight or branched CrCe alkyl group which is optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from hydroxy, amino, sulphydryl, d-Ce alkoxy or carboxy, and/or optionally interrupted by one or more divalent groups selected from -NH-, -O-, &gt;C=O, -(C=O)O-, -O(C=O)-, -NH(C=O)-, -(C=O)NH-, &gt;SO or &gt;SO2 groups.<br>
<br>
The present process enables,  advantageously, the recovery of triiodinated 3,5-disubstituted phenols of formula (2) in high yields and purity.<br>
<br>
In the present description, uniess othenwise provided, with the term straight or<br>
branched C1-C6 alkyl group we intend a linear or branched alkyl chain with from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Suitable examples for the said alkyl groups may thus comprise methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, and the like.<br>
<br>
The above alkyl groups may be further substituted and/or interrupted by a variety of moieties as set forth above.<br>
<br>
Within them, with the term C1-C6 alkoxy we intend any alkyl-oxy group wherein the alkyl moiety just represents any of the above straight or branched Ci-Ce alkyl groups.<br>
<br>
Suitable examples of alkoxy groups of the invention may thus comprise methoxy,<br>
ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-pentyloxy, and the like.<br>
<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, within the<br>
compounds of formula (1) and (2), R and R' represent, the same or different from each other,   a  group  selected  from   carboxy   (-COOH),   carboxyester   (-COOR^)   and carboxamido (-CONH2, -CONHR^ or-CONR^R^) wherein R\ R^ and R^ are, the same or different from each other, a straight or branched C1-C4 alkyl group optionally substituted by one or more hydroxy groups.<br>
Even more preferably, within the compounds of fomiula (1) and (2), R and R'<br>
represent, the same or different fomn each other, a group selected from:<br>
-COOH,<br>
-COOCH3,<br>
-COO(CH2)3-CH3,<br>
-CONH2,<br>
-CONHCH3,<br>
-CONHCH2-CH(OH)-CH2(OH),<br>
-CONHCH[CH2OH]2<br>
<br>
From all of the above, as both R and R' groups do not take direct part to the reaction step, as per the details below, it is clear to the skilled person that optional substituents or groups, anyway present within the meanings of R and R' and which may undergo unwanted side reactions, need to be suitably protected before reaction takes place. Protection and subsequent deprotection of the said groups can be accomplished by a variety of methods widely known in the art and conventionally adopted in organic synthesis techniques. For a general reference to protective groups in organic chemistry see, for instance, T. W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (Wiley, N.Y. 1981).The electrochemical generation of T, as per step (a) of the process of the invention is performed in an electrolytic cell, hence in the presence of an anode and a cathode othenvise referred to as anodic and cathodic compartments. Suitable anodes are those conventionally known in the art and may comprise graphitic carbon anodes, vitreous carbon anodes, platinum anodes or even platinum alloys anodes which alloys may include other metals such as, for instance, iridium, titanium or conductive titanium dioxide. Particularly preferred are platinum and graphitic carbon anodes.<br>
<br>
As the cathode, conventional ones may be employed as well including, for instance, carbon, platinum, palladium, lead, copper or stainless steel cathodes as well as mixtures thereof. Carbon and steel cathodes in particular, are the most preferred. Cathode and anode are electrochemicaliy interconnected according to conventional means, by a porous barrier or diaphragm, for instance consisting of a porous frit or of any other permeable membrane material known in the art for the intended purpose. According to the process of the invention, the iodinating specie is represented by iodine cations (r) that are generated in situ from any surtable iodine source, for instance comprising molecular I2 or suitable iodide derivatives iike the alkaline salts Nai or KI or even hydriodic acid, or any mixture of them.<br>
<br>
Within the present invention, molecular iodine (I2) is particularly preferred. Because of the stoichiometry of the reaction the present process refers to, at least 3 moles of the reactive (r) specie are required for each mole of aromatic substrate of fomnula (1) to be triiodinated to the corresponding compound of formula (2).<br>
<br>
 <br>
Preferably, a slight excess of the iodinating agent to the phenolic substrate will be employed so that the equivalent ratio between them may vary from 1:1 to 3:1 or, even more preferably, from 1:1 to 2:1. semicelle contenuti diversi<br>
<br>
The anodic reaction is carried out in the presence of an organic solvent, preferably a poiar and/or protic solvent such as, for instance, acetonitrile, lower alcohols C1-C4 and mixtures thereof.<br>
<br>
Preferably, the process is carried out in the presence of lower alcohols wherein<br>
methanol is even more preferred.<br>
<br>
Hydroalcoholic solvent systems comprising relevant amounts of water, for instance water: methanol mixtures in a weight ratio of 1 :1 or with an even lower water content,<br>
for instance of 1 :4, should be preferably avoided.<br>
To this extent, particularly when generating the reactive (r) specie in step (a) from<br>
molecular iodine, either alone or together with any suitable iodide, the presence of<br>
amounts of water that may impair its solubility in the solvent medium, appears to<br>
negatively affect the reaction outcome.<br>
As per Comparative example 3, in fact, when the electrochemical oxidation of iodine,<br>
as per step (a) of the process, is carried out with the given water : alcohol  mixture,<br>
major amounts of unreacted iodine are recovered at the end of the process.<br>
As far as the cathodic compartment is concerned, instead, the above limitations on the<br>
choice of the solvent system are not needed and, hence, varying amounts of water<br>
may be successfully employed.<br>
Typically, polar and/or protic solvents such as acetonitrile, lower alcohols and water<br>
admixtures thereof, may be employed.<br>
Among them, methanol-water mixtures are particularly preferred.<br>
The reaction medium is usually kept to an acidic pH, i.e. below 7, through acid addition,<br>
for instance of concentrated nitric or suifuric acid, e.g. 97% H2S04.Preferably, pH is<br>
kept between O and 4 and, even more preferably, between 1 and 2.<br>
Alternatively, step (a) may be performed in the presence of known compounds suitable<br>
to maintain conductivity within the electrolytic cell, and thus used for the above<br>
purpose.<br>
<br>
 <br>
For the electrochemical generation of I* cations at the anode, a voltage across the<br>
electrodes may be applied, so sis to have an anode potential from about 1 to about 3 V<br>
versus SCE (Saturated Calomel Electrode as the reference electrode).<br>
Preferably, the reaction is carried out with an anode potential comprised from about 1.2<br>
to about 1.8 V VS. SCE.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, the electrolytic process according to the present invention may be<br>
performed in a galvanostatic mode, i.e. a constant current is passed through the<br>
solution during the process, for instance corresponding to 1-500 mA/cm^.<br>
The temperature during the process is kept constant, for instance between 15°C and<br>
25°C by operating according to conventionai methods. Typically, as the heat generated<br>
during the process may lead to a partia! evaporation of the soivent, particularly when<br>
employing lower boiling solvents like methanol, additional amounts of fresh soivent<br>
may be added so as to keep steady both temperature and soivent volume.<br>
The resulting solution containing the iodinating specie is then contacted with the<br>
aromatic substrate (1), or a suitable solution thereof, as fomnerly indicated.<br>
Typically, as reported in the experimental section, the iodination of the aromatic<br>
substrate of formula (1) is carried out in a separate reactor, wherein both the iodinating<br>
solution from step (a) and the substrate (1), either as such or suitable dissolved in a<br>
selected soivent, for instance including those previously indicated,  are properly<br>
contacted.<br>
Preferably, a solution of the substrate (1) in a lower alcohol, like methanol, is<br>
employed.<br>
Subsequent work-up of the reaction mixture may be then accomplished according to<br>
conventionai techniques widely known in the art so as to isolate and obtain the final<br>
compound of fomiula (2).<br>
As an example, when using molecular iodine to generate (r) cations, at the end of the<br>
reaction any excess of (r) or la could be easily removed according to conventionai<br>
methods by adding suitable amounts of alkali iodide, for instance KI, so as to fonn I2<br>
and, then, Kis complex. Likewise, excess of iodine could be also removed through the<br>
addition of sodium sulfite or bisulfite, up to discolouration of the reaction medium.<br>
The compounds of fomriula (1) as starting materials of the process of the invention areknown and, rf not commercially available per se, may be all prepared according to known methods.<br>
<br>
 <br>
For a general reference to the compounds of formula (1) see, for instance, the<br>
aforementioned WO 88/09328, WO 97/05097 and WO 00/32561.<br>
Likewise, any other reactant and/or solvent being employed in the instant process is known and readiiy available.<br>
<br>
Details  concerning the process of the invention  are  reported  in the following<br>
experimental section for the electrochemical iodination of 3,5-disubstituted phenols according to the present invention, which is however shortly reported below.<br>
<br>
A melting pot, otherwise referred to as crucible, is placed inside a crystallizer put on a magnetic stirrer system. A platinum anode is then suspended and placed between the porous frit constituting the bottom of the melting pot, and the inner bottom of the crystallizer.<br>
<br>
A suitable amount of an alcoholic solution of the selected iodine source, for example a solution of I2 in methanol, is poured into the crystallizer so that its volume is such to provide the electrochemical contact with the porous frit, and an amount of acid is then added. A suitable amount of an alcohol-water mixture is then poured into the melting pot, foliowed by the addltion of an acid. When the melting pot with its content is dipped into the iodine alcoholic solution, a graphite cathode is introduced into the melting pot and the system is then electrically connected. A constant electrical flow is maintained, then hydrogen forms at the cathode and the iodine solution turns brown to yellow-orange. During the reaction, a suitable amount of fresh methanol is added portionwise to the anodic compartment so as to compensate evaporation and to keep a permanent contact between the glass frit of the melting pot and the surrounding iodine solution. After a suitable time, for instance of about three hours, the solution is yellow-pale. Then, electric power is stopped and the iodinating solution in the crystallizer is transferred into a one-neck flask. A suitable amount of the selected compound of fomriula (1) or of a solution thereof is then added, either as such or portionwise, and the mixture is heated under reflux. The reaction is monitored by TLC and heating is continued up to quantitative conversion. The final solution thus obtained is lead cooling to room temperature.<br>
Then, any excess of 1+ and I2 may be eliminated by addition of suitable solutions of KI and of a saturated solution of NaSOs being added up to decolourisation. <br>
The solvent is then evaporated and the residue is extracted with a suitable solvent, for instance ethyl acetate. The solution is dried, filtered and evaporated to residue. The crude is purified by flash chromatography onto silica gel or by elution onto a hydrophobic polymeric resin column, starting elution with water to eliminate iodine salts and then with a surtable solvent, for instance acetone, to elute the product.<br>
<br>
Once obtained, the compounds of formula (2) may be then easily converted into the corresponding x-ray contrast agents of interest having formula (5) below.<br>
Hence, it is a further object of the present invention a process for the preparation of the compounds of fomnula (5) below which process comprises:<br>
(a)	electrochemically generating l cations from a suitable iodine source; and<br>
(b)	iodinating 3,5-disubstituted-phenols of formula (1) in the presence of the above I cations of step (a):<br>
 <br>
wherein R and R' have the meanings above reported, so as to obtain the compounds of formula (2);<br>
(c) reacting the compound of fomnula (2), either as such or wherein the hydroxy group on the benzene ring is present as alkali or ail<ali-earth metal salt with a compound of formula></ali-earth>
R4HN(C=0)CH(R5)Z        (3) wherein R4 and R5 are, the same or different from each other, hydrogen or a straight or branched C1-C6 alkyl group optionally substituted by one or more hydroxy or C1-C6 alkoxy groups and Z is a halogen atom or any suitable leaving group; so as to obtain a compound of formula (4)<br>
<br>
wherein R, R', R4 and R5 have the above reported meanings; and<br>
<br>
 <br>
(d) subjecting the compound of formula (4) to Smile's rearrangement in the presence of bases, so as to obtain the final compound of formula (5)<br>
According to the present process for preparing x-ray contrast agents, the electrochemical iodination of steps (a) and (b) is carried out as formerly reported whilst steps (c) and (d), comprehensive of experimental conditions and optional variants thereof, are known in the art as reported, for instance, in the aforementioned patent applications WO 88/09328, WO 97/05097 and WO 00/32561. Preferably, within the compounds of fomnula (3), Z is a bromine or chlorine atom. Even more preferably, the instant process may be applied to the preparation of widely known x-ray contrast agents like iopoamidol (wherein, respectiveiy, R and R' both represent a -C0NH-CH(CH20H)2 group, R4 is hydrogen and R5 is methyl; see The Merck Index, XIII Ed., 2001, No. 5073) or iomeprol (wherein, respectiveiy, R and R' both represent a -CONH-CH2-CH(OH)CH20H group, R4 is methyl and R5 is hydrogen; see The Merck Index, XIII Ed., 2001, No. 5071).<br>
<br>
Therefore, it is an additional object of the invention a process for the preparation of iopamidol or iomeprol by starting from the compounds of formula (2a) or (2b), respectiveiy, the said compounds of formula (2a) and (2b) being obtained through the electrochemical iodination of compounds (la) or (1b), respectiveiy, as per steps (a) and (b) of the process of the invention.<br>
 <br>
According to an additional aspect of the invention, the instant process may be convenientiy employed also for the preparation of suitably substituted anilines bearing given carboxy or carboxyester groups, substantially as set forth below. Hence, according to an additional embodiment of the invention, it is herewith provided a process for the preparation of 3,5-disubstituted-2,4,6-triiodoanilines of fonnula (7), which process comprises:<br>
<br>
(a)	electrochemically generating 1* cations from a suitable iodine source; and<br>
(b)	iodinating 3,5-disubstituted-aniiines of formula (6) in the presence of the above 1* cations of step (a):<br>
 <br>
R" and R'" represent, the same or different from each other, a carboxy -COOH or carboxyester group -COOR1 wherein R1 is a straight or branched C1-C6 alkyl group which is optionaily substituted by one or more groups selected from hydroxy, amino, sulphydryi, C1-C6 alkoxy or carboxy, and/or optionaily interrupted by one or more divalent groups selected from -NH-, -O-, &gt;C=O, -(C=O)O-, -O(C=O)-, -NH(C=O)--(C=O)NH-, &gt;SO or &gt;SO2 groups.<br>
<br>
In the present description, uniess otherwise provided, within formula (6) and (7) the definitions of R" and R'" and, hence, of R1 are those previously reported.<br>
Preferably, within the above process for preparing the compounds of formula (7), R" and R'" are the same and both represent a group -COOH or -GOOR^ wherein R1 is-a straight or branched C1-C4 alkyl group.<br>
<br>
The above process is carried out by first generating the iodinating source I* as formerly reported that, in subsequent step (b), allows for the complete triiodination of the aromatic ring in high yields and purity.<br>
<br>
Also in this case, the starting materials of fomriula (6) are known or can be easily<br>
prepared according to known methods, for instance by suitably hydrogenating or<br>
anyway reducing the corresponding nitroisophthalic acid, optionaily to be subsequently functionalized according to conventionai techniques for the conversion of carboxy to carboxyester groups.<br>

Comparative Example 3<br>
<br>
Electrochemical qeneration of l in a hvdroalcoholic medium<br>
The eiectrochemical iodination apparatus consisted of a cell composed of:<br>
-	an anode compartment with a piatinum anode (foil, 3 cm2) and a magnetic stirring bar;<br>
 -	a cathode compartment with a stainless steel cathode (piate, 8 cm^).<br>
The two compartments were separated by a porous glass frit (average pore size 6 nm). In the anode compartment it was placed a 0.15 M solution of NaBF4 in methanol/water (50/50, 40 mL) and iodine (762 mg, 3 mmol) was added therein with vigorous stirring. Owing to the low solubility of iodine in the mixture, a large portion of it was still present, as a precipitate, at the bottom of the anode compartment; the mixture showed a pale orange colour. pH was adjusted to 1.5 by using a 40% aqueous solution of HBF4. In the cathode compartment, it was placed a 0.15 M solution of NaBFa in methanol/water (50/50,15 mL).<br>
<br>
A constant current of 400 mA was applied. After about 30 minutes, the current began to decrease and after about 40 minutes the current dropped to -60 mA at the maximum power supply voltage of 31.6 V. The solution was yellow and the major portion of the starting iodine was still present at the bottom of the anolyte compartment. The solid iodine was recovered by filtration, washed with water and dried, weighing 678 mg (89% recovery of unreacted iodine).<br>
