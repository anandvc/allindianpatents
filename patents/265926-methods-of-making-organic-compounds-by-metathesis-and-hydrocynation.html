				<td>METHODS OF MAKING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS BY METATHESIS<br><br>
AND HYDROCYANATION<br><br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br><br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application having Serial No. 60/851,367, filed October 13, 2006, and entitled METHODS OF MAKING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS BY METATHESIS AND CATALYTIC MODIFICATION, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND<br><br>
It is desirable to use renewable feedstocks (e.g., natural oil-derived fatty acids or fatty esters) as a source material for synthesizing industrially important organic compounds that have been conventionally manufactured from petroleum feedstocks. One useful reaction for modifying the structure of natural oil-derived feedstocks is metathesis. Metathesis is a catalytic reaction involving the rupture and reformation of carbon-carbon double bonds. When metathesis is applied directly to many natural oil-derived feedstocks, a mixture of products results. For example, when metathesis is applied to a mixture of fatty acid esters, the resulting metathesis products include a mixture of monoesters and diesters of various chain lengths. Due to the similarity in molecular weight and functionality of the products, it is difficult to separate the desired product (e.g., a particular chain length diester) from the other metathesis products. In view of the foregoing, what is desired is a method by which organic compounds may be readily synthesized from natural oil-derived feedstock materials. SUMMARY<br><br>
The invention is directed to methods of making organic compounds by metathesis and hydrocyanation. Hydrocyanation functions to introduce a nitrile group into the organic compound. The nitrile group may be converted into an amine group, an aldehyde group, an alcohol group, or a carboxylic acid group. The methods of the invention may be used to make industrial important organic compounds, for example, dicarboxylic acids (diacids), diesters, acid-amines, acid- alcohols, acid-nitriles, ester-amines, ester-alcohols, ester-nitriles, and acid-esters. <br><br>
Advantageously, the method of the invention makes use of a cross- metathesis step with a short-chain olefin to chemically modify the starting composition and to produce a functionalized alkene intermediate that has a predetermined carbon-carbon double bond position. Upon separation of the functionalized alkene intermediate, the carbon-carbon double bond is modified by hydrocyanation in order to introduce a nitrile group into the molecule. The cross- metathesis step allows the use of starting compositions that contain multiple unsaturated species (e.g., including polyunsaturated species) to produce desired organic acid compounds. Accordingly, starting compositions comprising multiple unsaturated species may be used directly in the method without prior purification.<br><br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method of making organic compounds by metathesis and catalytic modification. The method of the invention comprises the steps of:<br><br>
(a) providing a starting composition comprising an unsaturated fatty acid, an unsaturated fatty ester, a salt of unsaturated fatty acid, or a mixture thereof;<br><br>
(b) cross-metathesizing the starting composition of step (a) with a short- chain olefin in the presence of a metathesis catalyst to form cross-metathesis products comprising:<br><br>
(i) one or more olefin compounds; and (ii) an acid-, ester-, or salt-functionalized alkene having at least one carbon-carbon double bond;<br><br>
(c) separating at least a portion of the acid-, ester-, or salt-functionalized alkene from the cross-metathesis products; and<br><br>
(d) catalytically modifying the carbon-carbon double bond of the acid-, ester, or salt-functionalized alkene by hydrocyanation in order to introduce a nitrile group.<br><br>
Useful starting compositions include unsaturated compounds (e.g., unsaturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty esters, and carboxylate salts of unsaturated fatty acids) that are typically derived from natural oils such as vegetable oils or animal fats. In many embodiments, the starting composition comprises an unsaturated polyol ester. <br><br>
When derived from a vegetable oil, useful vegetable oils include soybean oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, safflower oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, linseed oil, castor oil, olive oil, peanut oil, and mixtures thereof. In the methods of the invention the starting composition is cross- metathesized with a short-chain olefin in the presence of a metathesis catalyst. In some embodiments, the short-chain olefin has the structure:<br><br>
R7R8C=CR9R10 where R7, R8, R9, and R10 are each, independently, hydrogen or an organic group, with the proviso that at least one of R7 or R8 is an organic group. In many embodiments, the short-chain olefin is a short-chain internal olefin. For example, the short-chain internal olefin may have the structure:<br><br>
R7R8C=CR9R10 where R7, R8, R9, and R10 are each, independently, hydrogen or an organic group, with the proviso that at least one of R7 or R8 is an organic group, and at least one of R9 or R10 is an organic group. Useful short-chain internal olefins may be symmetric or asymmetric. When symmetric, the short-chain internal olefin may have the structure:<br><br>
R7CH=CHR9 where R7 and R9 are the same organic group. Examples of symmetric short- chain internal olefins include 2-butene, 3-hexene, and 4-octene. Examples of asymmetric short-chain internal olefin include 2-pentene, 2-hexene, 2-heptene, 3- heptene, 2-octene, 3-octene, 2-nonene, 3-nonene, and 4-nonene. In some embodiments, the short-chain olefin is an a-olefin having the structure: CH2=CH-R10 where -R10 is an organic group. Examples of a-olefin include 1-propene, 1- butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, and 1-nonene.<br><br>
After cross-metathesis, at least a portion of the acid-, ester-, or salt- functionalized alkene is separated from the other cross-metathesis products. Useful separation processes include distillation, reactive distillation, chromatography, fractional crystallization, membrane separation, liquid/liquid extraction, or a combination thereof. <br><br>
After separation, the carbon-carbon double bond of the separated acid-, ester, or salt-functionalized alkene is catalytically modified by hydrocyanation in order to introduce a nitrile group. After introduction of the nitrile group, the nitrile may be further reacted in order to modify the functionality of the compound. For example, in some embodiments, the nitrile group is reduced in order to convert the nitrile group into an aldehyde group or an alcohol group. In other embodiments, the nitrile group is subjected to hydrolysis in order to convert the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. In yet other embodiments, the nitrile group is subjected to hydrogenation in order to convert the nitrile group into an amine. In many embodiments, the organic compounds produced according to the present invention have chain lengths ranging from about 8 to 16 carbon atoms, for example, 12 carbon atoms.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention is directed to methods of making organic compounds by metathesis and hydrocyanation. The method of the invention may be used, for example, to make industrial important organic compounds such as diacids, diesters, acid-amines, acid-alcohols, acid-nitriles, ester-amines, ester-alcohols, and ester- nitriles.<br><br>
Starting Composition (Step (a)): As a starting composition, the method of the present invention uses unsaturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty esters, salts of unsaturated fatty acids, or a mixture. As used herein the term "unsaturated fatty acid" refers to compounds that have an alkene chain with a terminal carboxylic acid group. The alkene chain may be a linear or branched and may optionally include one or more functional groups in addition to the carboxylic acid group. For example, some carboxylic acids include one or more hydroxyl groups. The alkene chain typically contains about 4 to about 30 carbon atoms, more typically about 4 to about 22 carbon atoms. In many embodiments, the alkene chain contains 18 carbon atoms (i.e., a Cl 8 fatty acid). The unsaturated fatty acids have at least one carbon-carbon double bond in the alkene chain (i.e., a monounsaturated fatty acid), and may have more than one double bond (i.e., a polyunsaturated fatty acid) in the alkene chain. In exemplary <br><br>
embodiments, the unsaturated fatty acid has from 1 to 3 carbon-carbon double bonds in the alkene chain.<br><br>
Also useful as starting compositions are unsaturated fatty esters. As used herein the term "unsaturated fatty ester" refers to a compounds that have an alkene chain with a terminal ester group. The alkene chain may be linear or branched and may optionally include one or more functional groups in addition to the ester group. For example, some unsaturated fatty esters include one or more hydroxyl groups in addition to the ester group. Unsaturated fatty esters include "unsaturated monoesters" and "unsaturated polyol esters". Unsaturated monoesters have an alkene chain that terminates in an ester group, for example, an alkyl ester group such as a methyl ester. The alkene chain of the unsaturated monoesters typically contains about 4 to about 30 carbon atoms, more typically about 4 to 22 carbon atoms. In exemplary embodiments, the alkene chain contains 18 carbon atoms (i.e., a Cl 8 fatty ester). The unsaturated monoesters have at least one carbon-carbon double bond in the alkene chain and may have more than one double bond in the alkene chain. In exemplary embodiments, the unsaturated fatty ester has 1 to 3 carbon- carbon double bonds in the alkene chain.<br><br>
Also useful as a starting composition are metal salts of unsaturated fatty acids (i.e., carboxylate salts of unsaturated fatty acids). The metal salts may be salts of alkali metals (e.g., a group IA metal such as Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs); alkaline earth metals (e.g., group HA metals such as Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba); group IHA metals (e.g., B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl); group IVA metals (e.g., Sn and Pb), group VA metals (e.g., Sb and Bi), transition metals (e.g., Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Cd), lanthanides or actinides. In many embodiments, the unsaturated fatty acid, ester, or carboxylate salt has a straight alkene chain and can be represented by the general formula:<br><br>
CH3-(CH2)nl-[-(CH2)p3-CH=CH-]x-(CH2)n2-COOR where: R is hydrogen (fatty acid), an aliphatic group (fatty ester), or a metal ion<br><br>
(carboxylate salt); <br><br>
nl is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 0 to 15; more typically 0, 3, or 6); n2 is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 2 to 1 1; more typically 3, 4, 7, 9, or 1 1); n3 is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 0 to 6; more typically 1); and x is an integer equal to or greater than 1 (typically 1 to 6, more typically 1 to 3).<br><br>
A summary of some unsaturated fatty acids and esters is provided in TABLE A. <br><br><br>
TABLE A: Unsaturated Fatty Acids/Esters<br><br><br>
Unsaturated monoesters may be alkyl esters (e.g., methyl esters) or aryl esters and may be derived from unsaturated fatty acids by esterification, or unsaturated glycerides by transesterifying, with a monohydric alcohol. The monohydric alcohol may be any monohydric alcohol that is capable of reacting with the unsaturated free fatty acid or unsaturated glyceride to form the corresponding unsaturated monoester. In some embodiments, the monohydric alcohol is a Cl to C20 monohydric alcohol, for example, a Cl to C 12 monohydric alcohol, a Cl to C8<br><br>
10 monohydric alcohol, or a Cl to C4 monohydric alcohol. The carbon atoms of the monohydric alcohol may be arranged in a straight chain or in a branched chain structure, and may be substituted with one or more substituents. Representative <br><br>
examples of monohydric alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol (e.g., isopropanol), and butanol.<br><br>
Transesterification of an unsaturated triglyceride can be represented as follows.<br><br>
1 Unsaturated Triglyceride + 3 Alcohol — »¦ 1 Glycerol + 3 Monoesters<br><br>
Depending upon the make-up of the unsaturated triglyceride, the above reaction may yield one, two, or three moles of unsaturated monoester. Transesterification is typically conducted in the presence of a catalyst, for example, alkali catalysts, acid catalysts, or enzymes. Representative alkali transesterification catalysts include NaOH, KOH, sodium and potassium alkoxides (e.g., sodium methoxide), sodium ethoxide, sodium propoxide, sodium butoxide. Representative acid catalysts include sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulfonic acids. Heterogeneous catalysts may also be used for transesterification. These include alkaline earth metals or their salts such as CaO, MgO, calcium acetate, barium acetate, natural clays, zeolites, Sn, Ge or Pb, supported on various materials such as ZnO, MgO, TiO2, activated carbon or graphite, and inorganic oxides such as alumina, silica-alumina, boria, oxides of P, Ti, Zr, Cr, Zn, Mg, Ca, and Fe. In exemplary embodiments, the triglyceride is transesterified with methanol (CH3OH) in order to form free fatty acid methyl esters.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the unsaturated fatty esters are unsaturated polyol esters. As used herein the term "unsaturated polyol ester" refers to compounds that have at least one unsaturated fatty acid that is esterified to the hydroxyl group of a polyol. The other hydroxyl groups of the polyol may be unreacted, may be esterified with a saturated fatty acid, or may be esterified with an unsaturated fatty acid. The fatty acids in the polyol ester may be linear or branched and may optionally have functional groups other than the carboxylic acid such as one or more hydroxyl groups. Examples of polyol include glycerol, 1, 3-propanediol, 1, 2- propenediol, ethylene glycol, 1, 4-butanediol, 2, 3-butanediol, 1, 6-hexanediol, 1, 5- pentanediol, trimethylolpropane, erythritol, pentaerythritol, and sorbitol. In many embodiments, unsaturated polyol esters have the general formula: <br><br>
R (O-Y)m (OH)n (O-X)b<br><br>
where R is an organic group having a valency of (n+m+b); m is an integer from 0 to (n+m+b- 1), typically 0 to 2; b is an integer from 1 to (n+m+b), typically 1 to 3; n is an integer from 0 to (n+m+b- 1), typically 0 to 2; (n+m+b) is an integer that is 2 or greater; X is -(O)C-(CH2)n2-[-CH=CH-(CH2)n3-]x-(CH2)nl-CH3;<br><br>
Y is -(O)C-R';<br><br>
R' is a straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl group; nl is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 0 to 15; more typically 0, 3, or 6); n2 is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 2 to 1 1 ; more typically 3, 4, 7, 9, or 1 1); n3 is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 0 to 6; more typically 1); and x is an integer equal to or greater than 1 (typically 1 to 6, more typically 1 to 3).<br><br>
In many embodiments, the unsaturated polyol esters are unsaturated glycerides. As used herein the term "unsaturated glyceride" refers to a polyol ester having at least one (e.g., 1 to 3) unsaturated fatty acid that is esterified with a molecule of glycerol. The fatty acid groups may be linear or branched and may include pendant hydroxyl groups. In many embodiments, the unsaturated glycerides are represented by the general formula:<br><br>
CH2A-CHB-CH2C<br><br>
where -A; -B; and -C are selected from -OH; <br><br>
-O(O)C-(CH2)n2-[-CH=CH-(CH2)n3-]x-(CH2)nl-CH3; and -0(O)C-R'; with the proviso that at least one of -A, -B, or -C is<br><br>
-O(O)C-(CH2)n2-[-CH=CH-(CH2)n3-]x-(CH2)nl-CH3 In the above formula:<br><br>
R' is a straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl group; nl is an integer equal to or greater than O (typically O to 15; more typically O, 3, or 6); n2 is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 2 to 1 1; more typically 3, 4, 7, 9, or 1 1); n3 is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 0 to 6; more typically 1); and x is an integer equal to or greater than 1 (typically 1 to 6, more typically 1 to 3).<br><br>
Unsaturated glycerides having two -OH groups (e.g., -A and -B are -OH) are commonly known as unsaturated monoglycerides. Unsaturated glycerides having one -OH group are commonly known as unsaturated diglycerides. Unsaturated glycerides having no -OH groups are commonly known as unsaturated triglycerides.<br><br>
As shown in the formula above, the unsaturated glyceride may include monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and saturated fatty acids that are esterified to the glycerol molecule. The main chain of the individual fatty acids may have the same or different chain lengths. Accordingly, the unsaturated glyceride may contain up to three different fatty acids so long as at least one fatty acid is an unsaturated fatty acid.<br><br>
In many embodiments, useful starting compositions are derived from natural oils, such as plant-based oils, animal fats, or algae oils. Representative examples of plant-based oils include canola oil, rapeseed oil, coconut oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, olive oil, palm oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, linseed oil, palm kernel oil, tung oil, castor oil, tall oil, and the like. Representative <br><br>
examples of animal fats include lard, tallow, chicken fat (yellow grease), and fish oil.<br><br>
In many embodiments, the plant-based oil is soybean oil. Soybean oil comprises unsaturated glycerides, for example, in many embodiments about 95% weight or greater (e.g., 99% weight or greater) triglycerides. Major fatty acids making up soybean oil include saturated fatty acids, for example, palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid) and stearic acid (octadecanoic acid), and unsaturated fatty acids, for example, oleic acid (9-octadecenoic acid), linoleic acid (9, 12-octadecadienoic acid), and linolenic acid (9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid). Soybean oil is a highly unsaturated vegetable oil with many of the triglyceride molecules having at least two unsaturated fatty acids.<br><br>
The method of the invention can be used to produce multiple organic acid compounds. As discussed below, the position of the carbon-carbon double bond closest to the carboxylic acid, ester, or carboxylate salt group dictates the chain length of the organic acid compound that is formed by the method of the invention. ?9 Starting Compositions:<br><br>
In many embodiments, the starting composition comprises a ?9 unsaturated fatty acid, a ?9 unsaturated fatty ester (e.g., monoesters or polyol esters), a ?9 unsaturated fatty acid salt, or a mixture of two or more of the foregoing. ?9 unsaturated starting materials have a carbon-carbon double bond located between the 9th and 10th carbon atoms (i.e., between C9 and ClO) in the alkene chain of the unsaturated fatty acid, ester, or salt. In determining this position, the alkene chain is numbered beginning with the carbon atom in the carbonyl group of the unsaturated fatty acid, ester, or salt. ?9 unsaturated fatty acids, esters, and salts include polyunsaturated fatty acids, esters, or salts (i.e., having more than one carbon-carbon double bond in the alkene chain) so long as one of the carbon-carbon double bonds is located between C9 and ClO. For example, included within the definition of ?9 unsaturated fatty acids, esters, or salts are ?9, 12 unsaturated fatty acids, esters or salts, and ?9, 12, 15 unsaturated fatty acids, esters or salts. In many embodiments, the ?9 unsaturated starting materials have a straight alkene chain and may be represented by the general structure: <br><br>
CH3-(CH2)nl-[-(CH2)n3-CH=CH-]x-(CH2)7-COOR where<br><br>
R is hydrogen (fatty acid), an aliphatic group (fatty monoester) or a metal ion (carboxylate salt); nl is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 0 to 6; more typically 0, 3, 6); n3 is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 1); and x is an integer equal to or greater than 1 (typically 1 to 6, more typically 1 to 3).<br><br>
In exemplary embodiments, the ?9 unsaturated starting materials have a total of 18 carbons in the alkene chain. Examples include<br><br>
CH3-(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7-COOR; CH3-(CH2)4-CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH-(CH2)7-COOR; and<br><br>
CH3-CH2-CH-CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH-(CH2)7-COOR.<br><br>
where R is hydrogen (fatty acid), an aliphatic group (fatty monoester) or a metal ion (fatty acid salt);<br><br>
?9 unsaturated fatty esters may be monoesters or polyol esters. In many embodiments, the ?9 unsaturated polyol esters have the general structure:<br><br>
CH2A-CHB-CH2C<br><br>
where -A; -B; and -C are independently selected from -OH;<br><br>
-0(O)C-R'; and<br><br>
-O(O)C-(CH2)7-[-CH=CH-(CH2)n3-]x--(CH2)nl-CH3; with the proviso that at least one of -A, -B, or -C is<br><br>
-O(O)C-(CH2)7-[-CH=CH-(CH2)n3-]x--(CH2)nl-CH3. In the above formula: <br><br>
R' is a straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl group; nl is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 0 to 6; more typically 0, 3, 6); n3 is an integer equal to or greater than 0 (typically 1); and x is an integer equal to or greater than 1 (typically 1 to 6, more typically 1 to 3).<br><br>
In exemplary embodiments, the starting composition comprises one or more Cl 8 fatty acids, for example, oleic acid (i.e., 9-octadecenoic acid), linoleic acid (i.e., 9, 12-octadecadienoic acid), and linolenic acid (i.e., 9, 12, 15-octadecatrienoic acid). In other exemplary embodiments, the starting composition comprises one or more Cl 8 fatty esters, for example, methyl oleate, methyl linoleate, and methyl linolenate. In yet another exemplary embodiment, the starting composition comprises an unsaturated glyceride comprising ?9 fatty acids, for example, Cl 8 ?9 fatty acids. ?9 starting compositions may be derived, for example, from vegetable oils such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, safflower oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, linseed oil, castor oil, olive oil, peanut oil, and the like. Since these vegetable oils yield predominately in glyceride form, the oils are typically processed (e.g., by transesterification) to yield unsaturated fatty esters, unsaturated free fatty acids, or carboxylate salts thereof. ?9 starting materials may also be derived from tung oil which typically contains oleic acid, linoleic acid, and elostearic acid (C 18; ?9, 1 1, 13) in glyceride form. ?9 starting materials may also be derived from tall oil, fish oil, lard, and tallow. ?5 Starting Compositions: Also useful as a starting composition in the methods of the present invention are ?5 unsaturated fatty acids, esters, or salts. As used herein "?5" refers to unsaturated fatty acids, esters, or salts having a carbon-carbon double bond located between the 5th and 6th carbon atom in the alkene chain of the unsaturated fatty acid, ester, or salt. In some embodiments, ?5 unsaturated fatty acids, esters, and salts have the general structure:<br><br>
CH3-(CH2)nl-[-(CH2)n3-CH=CH-]x-(CH2)3-COOR <br><br>

A summary of some useful starting compositions is provided in TABLE B. <br><br><br>
TABLE B<br><br><br>
Cross-Metathesis (Step (b?):<br><br>
In the method of the present invention, the starting composition is cross- metathesized with an alpha olefin, an internal olefin, or a mixture thereof, to form cross-metathesis products comprising: (i) one or more olefins; and (ii) one or more acid-, ester-, or salt-functionalized alkenes.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the internal olefin is a short-chain olefin ("SCO"). Short-chain olefins are short-chain length organic compounds that have at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Typically, the short-chain length internal olefins have between about 4 and about 9 carbon atoms. Short-chain olefins can be represented by the structure (II): <br><br>
R7R8C=CR9R10 (H)<br><br>
where R7, R8, R9, and R10 are each, independently, hydrogen or an organic group, with the proviso that at least one of R7 or R8 is an organic group.<br><br>
The organic group may be an aliphatic group, an alicyclic group or an aromatic group. Organic groups may optionally include heteroatoms (e.g., O, N, or S atoms), as well as functional groups (e.g., carbonyl groups). The term aliphatic group means a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, hydrocarbon group. This term is used to encompass alkyl groups. The term alkyl group means a monovalent, saturated, linear, branched, or cyclic hydrocarbon group. Representative examples include of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl (n-propyl or i-propyl) butyl (n- butyl or t-butyl), and heptyl. An alicyclic group is an aliphatic group arranged in one or more closed ring structures. The term is used to encompass saturated (i.e., cycloparaffins) or unsaturated (cycloolefins or cycloacetylenes) groups. An aromatic or aryl group is an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon having a conjugated ring structure. Included within aromatic or aryl groups are those possessing both an aromatic ring structure and an aliphatic or alicyclic group.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the short-chain olefin is a short-chain internal olefin. Short-chain internal olefins may be represented by structure (II) where R7, R8, R9, and R10 are each, independently, hydrogen or an organic group, with the proviso that at least one of R7 or R8 is an organic group, and at least one of R9 or R10 is an organic group.<br><br>
Short-chain internal olefins may be symmetric or asymmetric. Symmetric short-chain internal olefins having one carbon-carbon double bond may be represented by structure (H-A):<br><br>
R7CH=CHR9<br><br>
(H-A) <br><br>
where -R7 and -R9 are same organic group.<br><br>
Representative examples of symmetric short-chain internal olefins include 2- butene, 3-hexene, and 4-octene. In some embodiments, the short-chain internal olefin is asymmetric. Representative examples of asymmetric short-chain internal olefins include 2-pentene, 2-hexene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, 2-octene, 3-octene, 2- nonene, 3-nonene, and 4-nonene.<br><br>
In many embodiments, symmetric short-chain internal olefins are preferred for cross-metathesis because the cross-metathesis products that result will include fewer products than if an asymmetric short-chain internal olefin is used for cross- metathesis. For example, as shown below, when a first double-bond containing compound (i.e., A=B) is cross-metathesized with a symmetric short-chain internal olefin (i.e., represented by C=C), two cross-metathesis products are produced. By contrast, when the same double-bond containing compound is cross-metathesisized with an asymmetric short-chain internal olefin (i.e., represented by C=D), four cross-metathesis products are produced.<br><br>
Metathesis of Symmetric Short-chain Internal Olefin (C=C)<br><br>
A=B + C=C  A=C + B=C<br><br>
Metathesis of Asymmetric Short-chain Internal Olefin (C=D): A=B + C=D - A=C + B=C + A=D + B=D<br><br>
In some embodiments, the short-chain olefin is an a-olefin. Alpha olefins are included in general structure (II) when R7, R8, and R9 are all hydrogen. Representative a-olefin are shown in general structure (H-B):<br><br>
CH2=CH-R10<br><br>
(H-B)<br><br>
where -R10 is an organic group. <br><br>
Representative -R10 groups include -CH3 and - (CH2)n-CH3, where n ranges from 0 to 6. Exemplary alpha olefin compounds include 1-propene, 1-butene, 1- pentene, 1 -hexene, 1 -heptene, 1 -octene, and 1 -nonene. Metathesis Catalysts: The metathesis reaction is conducted in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a metathesis catalyst. The term "metathesis catalyst" includes any catalyst or catalyst system which catalyzes the metathesis reaction.<br><br>
Any known or future-developed metathesis catalyst may be used, alone or in combination with one or more additional catalysts. Exemplary metathesis catalysts include metal carbene catalysts based upon transition metals, for example, ruthenium, molybdenum, osmium, chromium, rhenium, and tungsten. Exemplary ruthenium-based metathesis catalysts include those represented by structures 12 (commonly known as Grubbs's catalyst), 14 and 16, where Ph is phenyl, Mes is mesityl, and Cy is cyclohexyl.<br><br><br>
12 14 16<br><br>
Structures 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28, illustrated below, represent additional ruthenium-based metathesis catalysts, where Ph is phenyl, Mes is mesityl, py is pyridine, Cp is cyclopentyl, and Cy is cyclohexyl. Techniques for using catalysts 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28, as well as additional related metathesis catalysts, are known in the art. <br><br><br>
18 20 22<br><br><br>
Catalysts C627, C682, C697, C712, and C827 are additional ruthenium- based catalysts, where Cy is cyclohexyl in C827.<br><br><br><br>
C627<br><br>
C712<br><br><br>
C697 C682<br><br>
Additional exemplary metathesis catalysts include, without limitation, metal carbene complexes selected from the group consisting of molybdenum, osmium, <br><br>
chromium, rhenium, and tungsten. The term "complex" refers to a metal atom, such as a transition metal atom, with at least one ligand or complexing agent coordinated or bound thereto. Such a ligand typically is a Lewis base in metal carbene complexes useful for alkyne or alkene-metathesis. Typical examples of such ligands include phosphines, halides and stabilized carbenes. Some metathesis catalysts may employ plural metals or metal co-catalysts (e.g., a catalyst comprising a tungsten halide, a tetraalkyl tin compound, and an organoaluminum compound).<br><br>
An immobilized catalyst can be used for the metathesis process. An immobilized catalyst is a system comprising a catalyst and a support, the catalyst associated with the support. Exemplary associations between the catalyst and the support may occur by way of chemical bonds or weak interactions (e.g. hydrogen bonds, donor acceptor interactions) between the catalyst, or any portions thereof, and the support or any portions thereof. Support is intended to include any material suitable to support the catalyst. Typically, immobilized catalysts are solid phase catalysts that act on liquid or gas phase reactants and products. Exemplary supports are polymers, silica or alumina. Such an immobilized catalyst may be used in a flow process. An immobilized catalyst can simplify purification of products and recovery of the catalyst so that recycling the catalyst may be more convenient.<br><br>
The metathesis process can be conducted under any conditions adequate to produce the desired metathesis products. For example, stoichiometry, atmosphere, solvent, temperature and pressure can be selected to produce a desired product and to minimize undesirable byproducts. The metathesis process may be conducted under an inert atmosphere. Similarly, if a reagent is supplied as a gas, an inert gaseous diluent can be used. The inert atmosphere or inert gaseous diluent typically is an inert gas, meaning that the gas does not interact with the metathesis catalyst to substantially impede catalysis. For example, particular inert gases are selected from the group consisting of helium, neon, argon, nitrogen and combinations thereof. Similarly, if a solvent is used, the solvent chosen may be selected to be substantially inert with respect to the metathesis catalyst. For example, substantially inert solvents include, without limitation, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, etc.; halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene; aliphatic solvents, including pentane, hexane, heptane, <br><br>
cyclohexane, etc.; and chlorinated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, etc.<br><br>
In certain embodiments, a ligand may be added to the metathesis reaction mixture. In many embodiments using a ligand, the ligand is selected to be a molecule that stabilizes the catalyst, and may thus provide an increased turnover number for the catalyst. In some cases the ligand can alter reaction selectivity and product distribution. Examples of ligands that can be used include Lewis base ligands, such as, without limitation, trialkylphosphines, for example tricyclohexylphosphine and tributyl phosphine; triarylphosphines, such as triphenylphosphine; diarylalkylphosphines, such as, diphenylcyclohexylphosphine; pyridines, such as 2,6-dimethylpyridine, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine; as well as other Lewis basic ligands, such as phosphine oxides and phosphinites. Additives may also be present during metathesis that increase catalyst lifetime.<br><br>
Any useful amount of the selected metathesis catalyst can be used in the process. For example, the molar ratio of the unsaturated polyol ester to catalyst may range from about 5: 1 to about 10,000,000: 1 or from about 50: 1 to 500,000:1.<br><br>
The metathesis reaction temperature may be a rate-controlling variable where the temperature is selected to provide a desired product at an acceptable rate. The metathesis temperature may be greater than -40°C, may be greater than about -20°C, and is typically greater than about O0C or greater than about 20°C. Typically, the metathesis reaction temperature is less than about 150°C, typically less than about 12O0C. An exemplary temperature range for the metathesis reaction ranges from about 2O0C to about 12O0C.<br><br>
The metathesis reaction can be run under any desired pressure. Typically, it will be desirable to maintain a total pressure that is high enough to keep the cross- metathesis reagent in solution. Therefore, as the molecular weight of the cross- metathesis reagent increases, the lower pressure range typically decreases since the boiling point of the cross-metathesis reagent increases. The total pressure may be selected to be greater than about 10 kPa, in some embodiments greater than about 30 kP, or greater than about 100 kPa. Typically, the reaction pressure is no more than about 7000 kPa, in some embodiments no more than about 3000 kPa. An exemplary pressure range for the metathesis reaction is from about 100 kPa to about 3000 kPa. <br><br>
In some embodiments, the metathesis reaction is catalyzed by a system containing both a transition and a non-transition metal component. The most active and largest number of catalyst systems are derived from Group VI A transition metals, for example, tungsten and molybdenum. Separation Step (step (c?):<br><br>
After cross-metathesis with the short-chain olefin, at least a portion of the acid-, ester-, or salt-functionalized alkene is separated from the remaining cross- metathesis products. Useful techniques for separating the acid-, ester-, or salt- functionalized alkene include, for example, distillation, reactive distillation, chromatography, fractional crystallization, membrane separation, liquid/liquid extraction, or a combination thereof. Catalytic Modification (step (d)):<br><br>
According to the method of the invention, after separation, the carbon-carbon double bond of the separated acid-, ester-, or carboxylate salt-functionalized alkene is catalytically modified by hydrocyanation in order to introduce a nitrile group into the molecule. In some embodiments, the nitrile group is then further reacted to form an amine group, a carboxylic acid group, an aldehyde group, or an alcohol group.<br><br>
Hydrocyanation is a catalytic process where hydrogen cyanide is added to an alkene having n carbon atoms, to produce a nitrile having n+1 carbon atoms, with n=l . In many embodiments, prior to hydrocyanation, the internal functional ized alkene is isomerized to form a terminal functionalized alkene. Isomerization and hydrocyanation of an exemplary acid-, ester-, or salt-functionalized compound is shown below:<br><br>
R'OOC-(CH2)n-CH=CH-CH3 ? ROOC-(CH2)n-CH2-CH=CH2<br><br>
R'OOC-(CH2)n-CH2-CH=CH2 + HCN/catalyst ? R'OOC-(CH2)n-CH2-CH(- C=N)-CH3<br><br>
+ R'OOC-(CH2)n-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=N<br><br>
where -R' is hydrogen (acid), an aliphatic group (ester), or a metal ion (salt). <br><br>
As shown above, hydrocyanation may result in the formation of branched or linear species depending upon the location of the carbon-carbon double bond and whether isomerization of the double bond occurs before the hydrocyanation reaction. Typical hydrocyanation catalysts include low valent nickel phosphite catalysts. Optionally, the nitrile group may be hydrogenated to convert it into a primary amine group as shown below:<br><br>
ROOC-(CH2)n-CH2-CH(C=N)-CH3 + H2/catalyst ? ROOC-(CH2)n-CH2-CH(- CH2-NH2)-CH3<br><br>
ROOC-(CH2)n-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=N + H2/catalyst ? ROOC-(CH2)n-CH2-CH2- CH2-CH2-NH2<br><br>
where -R' is hydrogen (acid), an aliphatic group (ester), or a metal ion (salt). Examples of hydrogenation catalysts include Ru, Pt, Pd, Rh, and Re catalysts.<br><br>
The method of the invention can be employed to synthesize various organic compounds. The organic compounds produced in accordance with the method of the present invention will depend upon the starting composition that is chosen and the catalytic modification. For example, an ester-functionalized starting composition can be catalytically modified using hydrocyanation to produce an ester- nitrile compound. In similar fashion, an acid-functionalized starting composition can be catalytically modified by hydrocyanation to produce an organic compound having carboxylic acid functionality and nitrile functionality. The nitrile group may also be modified to an aldehyde, alcohol, carboxylic acid, or amine group. Additional examples are summarized in TABLE C. <br><br>
TABLE C<br><br><br>
The length of the product organic made in accordance with the method of the invention can be varied depending upon the starting composition that is chosen and the position of the carbon-carbon double bond in the starting composition. Typically, the organic compounds will have a chain length of about 8 to 16 carbon atoms. For example, when ?9 starting compositions are used, the method of the invention produces organic compounds having a chain length of 12 carbon atoms (C 12) when 3-hexene is used as the short chain alkene in the cross-metathesis reaction.. A summary of the starting composition and the chain length of the resulting organic compound is provided in TABLE D. <br><br><br>
