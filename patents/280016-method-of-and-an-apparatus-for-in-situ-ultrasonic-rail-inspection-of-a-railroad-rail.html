				<td>Method of and an Apparatus for In Situ Ultrasonic Rail Inspection of a Railroad<br>
Rail<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates, in general, to a non-destructive testing<br>
method and apparatus for certain predetermined types of undesirable flaws or defects<br>
which may be present in the rails of a railroad track. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to a mobile and durable type apparatus that will ultrasonically detect<br>
flaws in the rail, identify the location of the flaw when detected, and record the<br>
location of the detected flaws for possible future repair, or more likely, rail<br>
replacement. More specifically, the present invention relates to a relatively fast and<br>
sensitive method and apparatus for detecting, identifying, and recording the location<br>
of the flaws that are detected by the apparatus as the apparatus travels over the rail in<br>
situ.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] It is well recognized in the railway industry that, either through<br>
manufacturing processes or through natural environmental processes and normal use,<br>
rails of a railroad track develop certain detrimental flaws. The flaws may include<br>
both non-critical and critical defects, for example, transverse defects, vertical sheer or<br>
split head defects, and horizontal sheer or split head defects.<br>
[0003] Safe operation on a rail may continue as long as the flaws remain non-<br>
critical. However, in time, even non-critical flaws may abscess or degrade into<br>
critical defects, and new flaws will arise. If the flaws are left unattended, the resulting<br>
defects could lead to a range of problems including catastrophic failure and train<br>
derailment. Catastrophic or even lesser failures present a financial, health and safety<br>
risk to the railway industry, transported goods and personnel, as well as surrounding<br>
homes and businesses. Such failures can be prevented, or at least decreased in<br>
frequency through routine inspection and maintenance. Further, routine maintenance<br>
can be made more cost-effective through selective repair, which is in turn facilitated<br>
by flaw detection.<br>
[0004] To detect rail flaws or defects, ultrasonic testing has been employed.<br>
Vehicles and rail car-mounted inspection apparatus have been built to travel along the<br>
track and continuously perform ultrasonic inspection of the rails of the railroad track<br>
in situ.<br>
[0005] In general, the inspection apparatus has taken the form of carriage-<br>
mounted sleds and wheels. A sled design, such as shown in US Patent 4,700,574,<br>
employs an ultrasonic transducer on a sled that is pulled along a rail coated with water<br>
to create an acoustic bridge. A wheel design, such as shown in US Patent 6,055,862,<br>
employs an ultrasonic transducer contained within a small, thin-walled tire that rolls<br>
along a rail. The tire is filled with fluid, such as a water-antifreeze solution, to create<br>
an ultrasonic bridge between the transducer and rail.<br>
[0006] The prior art designs have a number of disadvantages. For example,<br>
sled designs require a large amount of water for adequate sled-to-rail coupling and<br>
reduced wear from long-distance travel. Additionally, sleds are more sensitive to<br>
imperfections and flaws on the running surface of the rail. Wheel designs suffer from<br>
acoustic reverberation (noise) caused by acoustic reflections from the surface walls of<br>
the tire. The noise reduces the sensitivity of the apparatus following each acoustic<br>
emission.<br>
[0007] Further, both designs suffer from the limitations of known transducer<br>
technologies and configurations. Some acoustic transducer designs emit ultrasonic<br>
beams in a substantially vertical direction, which identifies some flaws in the web of<br>
the rail while lacking sensitivity to flaws in the internal portions of the head of the<br>
rail. In other designs, such as U.S. Patent No. 4,700,574 and U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,055,862, transducers are positioned to emit ultrasonic beams at angles to the<br>
transverse and longitudinal planes of the rail. The axis of the beam intersects the rail<br>
at one side of the central vertical longitudinal plane of the rail and extends across the<br>
longitudinal plane of the rail to the other side. The designs identify some additional<br>
flaws in the rail, particularly in the side of the head of the rail. Still other acoustic<br>
transducer designs include more elaborate transducer assemblies with additional beam<br>
paths, but still have limited ability to identify flaws in the internal portion of the head<br>
of the rail.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0008] The present invention, in one aspect thereof, provides a system for<br>
inspecting and detecting the location of certain types of defects in a rail of a railroad.<br>
The system includes a carriage capable of travelling on a railroad rail. A wheel<br>
assembly is suspended from the carriage and has a fluid-filled tire for rolling contact<br>
with a head of an underlying rail of the railroad rail on which the carriage travels.<br>
The tire forms a contact patch with the head of the underlying rail. An ultrasonic<br>
transducer is supported within the tire for transmitting an ultrasonic beam along a<br>
beam axis through the fluid and the tire into the head of the underlying rail. The beam<br>
axis passes into the rail at a first angle greater than 0 (zero) degrees to a vertical<br>
longitudinal median plane of the rail and a second angle greater than 0 (zero) degrees<br>
to a vertical transverse plane of the rail. The transducer is supported with the beam<br>
axis intersecting the head of the rail within the contact patch at a position offset from<br>
the vertical longitudinal median plane of the rail to the same side of the head<br>
penetrated and inspected by the ultrasonic beam.<br>
[0009] In another aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for<br>
inspecting and detecting the location of certain types of defects in a rail of a railroad.<br>
The apparatus includes a wheel assembly for making rolling contact with an<br>
underlying rail of a railroad rail. The wheel assembly includes a flexible tire for<br>
contact with the head of the underlying rail, the tire being filled with a fluid. At least<br>
one ultrasonic transducer is supported within the wheel assembly for transmitting an<br>
ultrasonic beam along a beam axis through the fluid and tire into the head of the<br>
underlying rail at a first angle greater than 0 (zero) degrees to a vertical longitudinal<br>
median plane of the rail and a second angle greater than 0 (zero) degrees to a vertical<br>
transverse plane of the rail. The transducer is supported within the wheel assembly to<br>
cause the beam axis to intersect the head of the rail at a position offset from the<br>
longitudinal median plane to the same side of the head penetrated and inspected by<br>
the ultrasonic beam.<br>
[0010] In a third aspect, the present invention provides a method of ultrasonic<br>
inspection of a head of a railroad rail. The method comprises the step of directing an<br>
ultrasonic beam along a beam axis into an upper surface of the head of a rail at a first<br>
angle greater than zero (0) degrees to a vertical longitudinal median plane of the rail<br>
and a second angle greater than zero (0) degrees to a transverse-plane of the rail. The<br>
beam axis is directed to intersect the upper surface of the head of the rail at a point<br>
offset from the vertical longitudinal plane to the same side of the head of the rail<br>
penetrated and inspected by the ultrasonic beam.<br>
[0011] In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for<br>
inspecting and detecting the location of certain types of defects in a rail of a railroad.<br>
The apparatus includes a wheel assembly for rolling contact with a railroad rail<br>
including an axle, a wheel hub rotatably mounted on the axle and a flexible tire<br>
mounted on the hub for rotation on the axle. The tire establishes a contact patch<br>
between a portion of the tire and a portion of the upper surface of the head of an<br>
underlying rail during an inspection. At least one ultrasonic transducer has a beam<br>
transmitting/receiving head. The transducer is mounted within the wheel assembly<br>
and is suspended from the axle with the transmitting/receiving head disposed at a<br>
predetermined distance no greater than 3 inches from the tire in the unflexed state. A'<br>
fluid disposed within the wheel assembly provides the sole ultrasonic transmission<br>
medium between the transmitting/receiving head of the transducer and the portion of<br>
the tire forming a contact patch between the tire and an underlying rail.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0013] Figure 1 shows an ultrasonic railroad rail inspection system 10 that<br>
inspects a railroad rail 12 for internal structural flaws or defects. The rail has a<br>
typical, known rail design with a base 14, a central web 16, and head 18. The head is<br>
shaped with a gauge side 20, a field side 22, and a upper running surface 24. For<br>
purposes of orientation, the directional axes of the railroad rail 12 are defined as the<br>
vertical longitudinal plane which extends vertically along the path of travel on the rail<br>
at the center or median of the rail, the horizontal longitudinal plane which extends<br>
horizontally along the path of travel on the rail, and the transverse plane which<br>
extends vertically and perpendicular to the path of travel on the rail.<br>
[0014] The system 10 includes flaw detector or sensor 26 containing one or<br>
more ultrasonic transducers 28, which are generally transmitter-receiver transducers,<br>
that are controlled by a central processing unit 30 connected to the transducer by a<br>
cable 32 to transmit and receive ultrasonic beams. In accordance with the present<br>
invention, when the central processing unit 30 sends a signal to the transducer 28, the<br>
transducer generates and transmits an ultrasonic beam 34 along a beam axis 36 toward<br>
the head 18 of the rail such that beam axis intersects the upper surface 24 of the rail at<br>
one side of the vertical longitudinal plane of the rail. After a slight refraction, the<br>
beam propagates through the head until beam is reflected off of a flaw F embedded in<br>
the head, in the illustrated case, an oval transverse flaw located on the same side of<br>
the vertical longitudinal plane penetrated by the beam. Some of the ultrasonic beam<br>
is reflected back from the flaw along the beam axis, and propagates through the head<br>
18 of the rail 12, through the upper surface 24 of the rail to the transducer 26 where<br>
the reflected beam is detected. The transducer converts the reflected beam into a<br>
reflection signal which the transducer sends to the central processing unit 30 through<br>
the cable 32. The central processing unit analyzes the reflection signal in comparison<br>
to the transmitted signal, and through a time scan identifies the existence, type, and<br>
location of the flaw F. The results can be stored for later analysis, or displayed in real<br>
time on the screen 35 of the central processing unit.<br>
[0015] Referring now to FIG. 2, a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
utilizes a carriage 40 which in an inspection operation is suspended by links 43 under<br>
a railcar or inspection vehicle (not shown) which travels along the rails for in situ rail<br>
flaw detection and identification. The carriage 40 includes a set of four flanged<br>
carriage wheels 42 connected to the four corners respectively of a rectangular chassis<br>
44 to guide the carriage along the rails in a substantially centered position when the<br>
carriage is lowered onto the rails in an inspection operation.<br>
[0016] The carriage 40 may be equipped with a number of known railroad rail<br>
inspection devices and inspection accessories that operate independently or in<br>
conjunction with the present invention. For instance, the carriage may be equipped<br>
with an induction sensor assembly 46 and associated current induction brushes 48.<br>
The carriage may also be equipped with one or more known ultrasonic rail inspection<br>
wheels 50, 52, which utilize transducers set at various angles to detect flaws ahead of<br>
and behind the wheels relative to the direction of travel, as well as defects below the<br>
carriage in the web of the rails. In addition, the carriage may also be equipped with a<br>
plurality of rail cleaners 54 to remove debris from the rails in advance of the sensors<br>
and flaw detectors.<br>
[0017] In accordance with the present invention, the carriage 40 includes<br>
freely rotatable wheel assemblies 60 that are somewhat larger in diameter than the<br>
conventional inspection wheels 50, 52, but also for in situ rail inspection. The wheel<br>
assemblies 60 are positioned between the wheels 50 and 52, but can be positioned<br>
anywhere on the carriage so as to be lowered with the other detectors into contact<br>
with the rails 12 during an inspection operation. The two wheel assemblies 60 are of<br>
the same construction and operate the same way, but on the different rails. Hence<br>
only one of the wheel assemblies 60 is described below.<br>
[0018] Figs. 3 and 4 show the wheel assembly 60 in different degrees of<br>
detail. As shown in the sectional view of Fig. 3 the assembly is supported from the<br>
carriage by a bifurcated frame 62 with removable legs 64, 66 that straddle the wheel<br>
assembly. A pair of stub axles 68, 70 are releasably secured to the legs by collars 71,<br>
72 so that the wheel assembly can be mounted in the frame 62. Once installed in the<br>
legs 64,66, the axles are fixed and secured in a non-rotatable fashion to the frame.<br>
[0019] As shown in Figs. 3, 4, and 5, the wheel assembly 60 includes two<br>
hubs 76, 78 freely rotatable on the axles 68,70 by wheel bearings 80, 82 respectively,<br>
a flexible tire 84 mounted on the hubs for rotation, and a set of ultrasonic transducers<br>
86, 88 suspended from a stationary transducer support 90 attached to the stub axles<br>
68, 70.<br>
[0020] The tire 84 is made of a flexible material, such as polyurethane, and is<br>
filled with a fluid 100 under a slight pressure, for example 10 -15 psi. Seals 102, 104<br>
in the hubs ride on the axles 68,70, and prevent the fluid 100 from escaping from the<br>
tire. The fluid 100 is preferably a mixture of water and antifreeze, such as ethylene*<br>
glycol, to prevent freezing.<br>
[0021] The fluid 100 serves as an ultrasonic transmission medium, and in the<br>
illustrated embodiment is the only transmission medium between the ultrasonic<br>
transducers and the tire 84. No accessory blocks as in the prior art are needed as long<br>
as the transducers are supported in close proximity to the tire to increase the signal-to-<br>
noise ratio in the transducer signals. In the preferred embodiment, tire 84 has an<br>
outside diameter of not less than eight (8) inches, and the transducers are positioned<br>
so that the transmitting/receiving head is no more than 3 inches from the outer<br>
circumference of the tire in the unflexed state. A preferred outside diameter of the tire<br>
is about 9 inches and the transducer is preferably placed not more than 2 inches from<br>
the circumference of the tire in the unflexed state.<br>
[0022] The tire 84 with the hubs 76,78 rotates freely on the axles 68,70 when<br>
the carriage 40 is lowered and travels along the rails 12, such that the outer<br>
circumferential surface of tire makes rolling contact with the running surface 24 of the<br>
rail head 18. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the tire rests on the rail head under a slight<br>
pressure or the weight of the carriage, which causes the tire to bulge and create a<br>
contact patch with the running surface. In the preferred embodiment with an outside<br>
tire diameter of 9 inches, the contact patch with rail head 18 along the vertical<br>
longitudinal plane of the rail should be about 4 inches to assure a high transmission<br>
coupling of the ultrasonic beams between the transducers 86,88 and the rail head 18.<br>
[0023] The ultrasonic transducers 86,88 are positioned within the tire 84 by<br>
the support 90 to project ultrasonic beams along axes into the rail head 18 at specified<br>
angles most favorable for detecting flaws in the rail head. Two transducers are used<br>
because each transducer is placed and oriented to optimally inspect half of the rail<br>
head, for example, either the gauge side or the field side of the head. The results of the<br>
inspection may be further improved by having four transducers, two facing forward<br>
and two facing backward, to detect flaws which are more likely to be exposed by<br>
beams aimed in one direction or the other. For purposes of simplicity only one<br>
forward-seeking transducer 88 and one rearward-seeking transducer 86 are shown.<br>
Additionally only the positioning and operation of the transducer 86 is discussed<br>
hereafter since the positioning and operation of the transducer 88 facing in the<br>
opposite direction are similar.<br>
[0024] As shown in Figs. 3, 4, and 5, the ultrasonic transducer 86 projects a<br>
beam B downward through the fluid 100 and tire 84 to intersect the upper running<br>
surface 24 of the head 18 of the underlying rail 12. In accordance with the present<br>
invention, the transducer is positioned so that the axis 36 of the beam intersects the<br>
running surface within the contact patch between the tire and rail, and at a position<br>
offset from the vertical longitudinal plane of the rail by not less than 0.2 inches to the<br>
same side of head through which the refracted beam propagates. In other words, the<br>
axis of the refracted beam does not cross over the vertical longitudinal plane as shown<br>
for example by beams 51, 52 in the prior art US Patent 6,055,862. After intersecting<br>
the running surface, the refracted beam passes downward into the rail head along a<br>
beam axis such that the refracted beam in the head propagates through the head at an<br>
angle of about 18 ±10 degrees to the vertical longitudinal plane, observable in FIG. 3,<br>
and at an angle of about 60 ±10 degrees to the transverse plane, observable in FIG. 4.<br>
The stated angles are preferred, and are determined by the positioning of the<br>
transducer in the wheel assembly 60. However, it has been found that penetration of<br>
the rail by the beam at a location offset to the same side of the head as inspected by<br>
the refracted beam produces significantly improved results in that more imperfections<br>
or flaws are detected than with the prior art devices.<br>
[0025] As the beam B propagates through underlying rail head 18, the beam is<br>
reflected by deflects or flaws F, such as transverse flaws, which cause a portion of the<br>
beam to be reflected, the reflection sometimes being referred to as an echo. The echo<br>
propagates along a plurality of paths back to the running surface 24 of rail head 18,<br>
through the tire 84 and fluid 100 such that a portion of the echo reaches the transducer<br>
86, if the transducer is an emitter/receiver transducer, or another ultrasonic detector.<br>
The received echo is converted by the transducer into a signal which is transmitted<br>
back to the processor 30 (Fig. 1) where it is analysed to determine the type and<br>
magnitude of the flaw. By pulsing the ultrasonic beam projected from the transducer<br>
86 at a known rate, for example, 2.25 MHz, and utilizing a time scan synchronized<br>
with the carriage speed, the processor can also give the location of the flaw in the rail.<br>
All of the data can also be viewed and stored at the processor.<br>
[0026] As illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7, the refracted beam with axis 36 may not<br>
encounter, or "see" a flaw F upon entry into the rail head 18 due to the orientation or<br>
position of the flaw relative to the beam, until after the beam has been reflected from<br>
the bottom side 110, gauge side 20, or field side 22 of the head. The flaw F shown is<br>
tilted at an angle which is approximately parallel to the axis 36 of the refracted beam<br>
immediately after the beam enters the rail head. Therefore, the flaw does not<br>
effectively intercept the beam at the entry angle. However, after reflection of the<br>
beam from the bottom side 110, the axis 36 of the beam is generally perpendicular to<br>
the flaw, and the flaw presents a target and discontinuity in the metal structure from<br>
which a strong beam echo will be reflected along the beam axis 36 back to the<br>
ultrasonic transducer 86 for further processing and detection. Because the beam is a<br>
pulsed beam, the processing of the reflected echo in a time scan will reveal that the<br>
flaw was detected after reflection. Therefore, flaw location can still be accurately<br>
defined.<br>
[0027] While the present invention has been described in several<br>
embodiments, it will be understood that numerous various and substitutions can be<br>
had without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, the wheel<br>
assembly can be utilized in combination with or independently of other flaw<br>
inspection sensors and equipment. The suspension of the transducer within the wheel<br>
assembly can take various forms as long as the position of the transducer relative to<br>
the rail can be fixed. The tire can be made of flexible materials other polyethylene as<br>
long as the ultrasonic beams can pass between the tire and the rail head. Accordingly,<br>
the invention has been disclosed in a preferred embodiment by way of illustration<br>
rather than limitation.<br>
