METHOD FOR DYNAMIC MASS AIR FLOW<br>
SENSOR MEASUREMENT CORRECTIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a mass air flow system of an<br>
internal combustion engine, and more particularly to systems and methods for<br>
correcting a mass air flow sensor measurement of the system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Mass Air Flow (MAF) can be measured using hotwire or<br>
hotfilm anemometer type sensors. These types of sensors are used in engine<br>
control systems for gasoline engines and diesel engines. MAF<br>
measurements are used to control the proportion of fuel to air in the engine.<br>
MAF sensors convert air flowing past a heated sensing element into an<br>
electronic signal. The strength of the signal is determined by the energy<br>
needed to keep the element at a constant temperature above the incoming<br>
ambient air temperature. As the volume and density (mass) of airflow across<br>
the heated element changes, the temperature of the element is adjusted to<br>
maintain the desired temperature of the heating element. The varying current<br>
flow parallels the particular characteristics of the incoming air (hot, cold, dry,<br>
humid, high/low pressure). A control module monitors the changes in current<br>
to determine air mass and to calculate precise fuel requirements.<br>
[0003] During transient engine operations, MAF sensor reading<br>
delays, or phase shifts can adversely affect control of the air fuel ratio, engine<br>
smoke control systems, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems. Many<br>
attempts have been made to overcome the transient delay of MAF sensor<br>
readings. One approach applies digital averaging software and filtering<br>
functions to artificially shift MAF sensor signals. Another method applies a<br>
manifold volume filling model.<br><br>
2<br>
[0004] These methods were developed to correct MAF sensor over<br>
predictions of fresh air mass per cylinder. The methods do not correct severe<br>
under predictions of fresh air mass per cylinder. Under predictions can occur<br>
during transient operations of the engine. An under prediction of air flow can<br>
severely penalize the vehicles driveability. The methods also fail to take into<br>
account engine speed change effects. The methods are not applicable to<br>
initial vehicle launch conditions of a diesel engine with a turbocharger where<br>
manifold pressure changes are small due to turbo lag, but rapid changes in<br>
engine speed are present.<br>
[0005] Speed-density calculations or multi-zoned Dyna-Air<br>
algorithms are also used instead of MAF sensors. These methods can be<br>
complicated and require the availability of large sets of test data<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Accordingly, a mass airflow sensor measurement correction<br>
system for a turbocharged diesel engine operating under transient conditions<br>
includes a signal input device that generates an engine speed signal based<br>
on an engine speed of a turbocharged diesel engine. A control module<br>
receives the engine speed signal and calculates a correction value of mass<br>
airflow from a differential of the engine speed signal and a constant<br>
[0007] In other features, the constant is determined from at least<br>
one of a displacement volume of the engine, a volumetric efficiency of the<br>
engine, a temperature of an intake manifold, and a gas constant. The<br>
constant can be adjusted based on delays of the signal input device and<br>
delays of control module processing.<br><br>
3<br>
[0008] In another feature, the control module determines a<br>
differential of the engine speed signal and calculates a correction value from<br>
the constant and the differential according to the following equation.<br><br>
[0009] In another feature, the mass airflow sensor measurement<br>
correction system includes a second signal input device that generates a<br>
manifold absolute pressure signal based on a pressure of an intake manifold<br>
coupled to the engine. The control module receives the manifold absolute<br>
pressure signal and calculates a correction value of mass airflow from the<br>
engine speed signal, the manifold absolute pressure signal, and the constant<br>
according to the following equation:<br><br>
[0010] In still other features, the control module determines a<br>
differential of the engine speed signal, determines a differential of the<br>
manifold absolute pressure signal, and calculates a correction value based on<br>
the differential of the engine speed, the differential of the manifold absolute<br>
pressure signal, the constant, and a second constant according to the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
[0011] In yet another feature, the control module determines a<br>
differential of the manifold absolute pressure signal and calculates the<br>
correction value based on the differential of the manifold absolute pressure<br>
signal and the first constant according to the following equation:<br><br><br>
4<br>
[0012] In yet another feature, the control module determines a mass<br>
airflow per cylinder value from the correction value. The control module<br>
controls a fuel injector of the engine based on the mass airflow per cylinder<br>
value.<br>
[0013] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>

[0014] The present invention will become more fully understood<br>
from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0015] Figure 1 is a functional block diagram illustrating a<br>
turbocharged diesel engine system;<br>
[0016] Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a cylinder of a diesel<br>
engine;<br>
[0017] Figure 3 is a flowchart illustrating the steps of a method<br>

[0018] Figure 4 is a graph illustrating the results of the MAF sensor<br>
correction method.<br><br>
5<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify the same elements. As used herein, the<br>
term module and/or device refers to an application specific integrated circuit<br>
(ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and<br>
memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a<br>
combinational logic circuit and/or other suitable components that provide the<br>
described functionality.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 1, a turbocharged diesel engine<br>
system 10 includes an engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to<br>
produce drive torque. Air enters the system by passing through an air filter<br>
14. After passing through the air filter, air is drawn into a compressor 16 The<br>
compressor 16 compresses the air entering the system 10. The greater the<br>
compression of the air generally, the greater the output of the engine 12<br>
Compressed air then passes through an air cooler 18 before entering into an<br>
intake manifold 20. Cooling the air makes the air denser. The air cooler 18<br>
then releases the air into an intake manifold 20. Air within the intake manifold<br>
20 is distributed into cylinders 22. Although a single cylinder 22 is illustrated,<br>
it can be appreciated that the dynamic mass airflow measurement correction<br>
system of the present invention can be implemented in engines having a<br>
plurality of cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12<br>
cylinders.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 2, an intake valve 24 of the engine<br>
selectively opens and closes to enable the air to enter the cylinder 22 The<br>
intake valve position is regulated by an intake camshaft (not shown). A fuel<br>
injector 26 simultaneously injects fuel into the cylinder 22. The fuel injector 26<br>
is controlled to provide a desired air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio within the cylinder 22<br>
A piston 28 compresses the A/F mixture within the cylinder 22. The<br>
compression of the hot air ignites the fuel in the cylinder 22, which drives the<br><br>
6<br>
piston 28. The piston 28, in turn, drives a crankshaft 30 to produce drive<br>
torque. Combustion exhaust within the cylinder 22 is forced out an exhaust<br>
port when an exhaust valve 32 is in an open position. The exhaust valve<br>
position is regulated by an exhaust camshaft (not shown). Although single<br>
intake and exhaust valves 24, 32 are illustrated, it can be appreciated that the<br>
engine 12 can include multiple intake and exhaust valves 24, 32 per cylinder<br>
22.<br>
[0022] Referring back to Figure 1, combustion exhaust within the<br>
cylinder is forced out of the exhaust port into an exhaust manifold 33.<br>
Whereupon, exhaust can be returned to the intake manifold 20 and/or treated<br>
in an exhaust system (not shown) and released to the atmosphere. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system (shown in<br>
phantom) can also be included in the system. The EGR system includes an<br>
EGR cooler 35 and an EGR valve 37 that regulates exhaust flow back into the<br>
intake manifold 20. The mass of exhaust air that is recirculated back into the<br>
intake manifold 20 also reduces the combustion temperature in the engine<br>
cylinder, and affects engine torque output.<br>
[0023] A mass airflow (MAF) sensor 40 senses the mass of the<br>
intake airflow and generates a MAF signal 42. An intake manifold<br>
temperature (IMT) sensor 44 senses a temperature of the intake manifold and<br>
generates an intake manifold temperature signal 46. A manifold absolute<br>
pressure (MAP) sensor 48 senses the pressure within the intake manifold 20<br>
and generates a MAP signal 50. An engine speed sensor 52 senses a<br>
rotational speed of the crankshaft 30 of the engine 12 and generates an<br>
engine speed signal 54 in revolutions per minute (RPM).<br>
[0024] A control module 60 receives the above mentioned signals<br>
42, 46, 50, and 54. The control module 60 controls the engine system 10<br>
based on an interpretation of the signals and the mass airflow sensor<br>
correction method of the present invention. More specifically, the control<br>
module 60 interprets the signals and calculates a mass airflow correction<br>
value from the signals during transient engine operations using fundamental<br><br>
7<br>
engine airflow physics. The correction value is then applied to an air per<br>
cylinder calculation. An air per cylinder value is then used to control the fuel<br>
injector 26 of the cylinder 22. The air per cylinder value can also be used to<br>
control the EGR system and/or a smoke control system (not shown)<br>
[0025] A description of the mass airflow sensor correction method<br>
follows. Real engine airflow verses theoretical airflow for a four stroke engine<br>
can be related with the volumetric efficiency ηv of the engine by the following<br>
equation:<br>
simplified as <br>
Where, MAF is the mass air flow of the system in grams per second The<br>
control module 60 determines this value from the MAF signal 42. Vdisp is the<br>
engine displacement volume in liters. Vdisp can vary according to the size and<br>
number of cylinders 22 of the engine 12. Dividing Vdisp by two calculates the<br>
actual displacement of a cylinder 22 for a four stroke engine operating with<br>
two revolutions per cycle. RPM is the engine speed in revolutions per<br>
minute. The control module 60 determines this value from the engine speed<br>
signal 52. Dividing by sixty converts the equation to seconds.<br>
[0026] ρcharge is the charge density of the air in kilograms per meters<br>
cubed. The control module 60 calculates ρcharge from the following equation<br><br>
Where, MAP is the intake manifold absolute pressure in kilopascals<br>
determined from the MAP signal 48. Rcharge is a gas constant and IMT is the<br>
intake manifold temperature in Kelvin determined from the IMT signal 44<br><br>
8<br>
[0027] To clarify mass airflow dependency on the inputs, the<br>
equation can be arranged into an explicit form:<br><br>
[0028] In the above relation, engine displacement volume Vdisp and<br>
gas Rcharge are nearly constant. ηv is the volumetric efficiency that measures<br>
how well a cylinder 22 is breathing. The variation of ηv can be moderate,<br>
ranging from ten to twenty percent. The variation of IMT can also be<br>
moderate, averaging near twenty percent in some cases. The parameters<br>
with large variations in value are RPM and MAP. RPM and MAP can<br>
experience percentage changes as large as two hundred to three hundred<br>
percent. For example, an RPM range can be from 600 RPM at idle to a high<br>
of 3200. A MAP range can be from nearly 100 kPa at idle for operation at sea<br>
level to a high of 275 kPa. While exemplary ranges are disclosed, other<br>
values may be used.<br>
[0029] By grouping small variation parameters into a constant K, the<br>
major changes in MAF can be predicted from changes in RPM and MAP by<br>
the following equation:<br><br>
The constant K can be selectable based on the displacement volume,<br>
manifold temperature, gas constant and volumetric efficiency of the system<br>
The constant can also take into account system delays from sensor readings<br>
or controller processing and/or time differences due to varying lengths and<br>
volumes of the components of the engine system 10.<br><br>
9<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 2, steps executed by the control<br>
module according to the MAF sensor correction method is shown. Control<br>
interprets signals from sensors of the system in step 100. The interpreted<br>
signals are used in a calculation of a differential of MAF. In step 110, control<br>
may choose to neglect interactions between RPM and MAP and calculate a<br>
MAF differential in step 120 from a constant K1, an RPM, a constant K2, a<br>
MAP differential, and an RPM differential. The constants K1 and K2 can be<br>
selectable. The relation can be illustrated by the following equation:<br><br>
[0031] Otherwise, in step 130, control may choose to neglect the<br>
MAP signal and calculate a MAF differential in step 140 from a constant K3<br>
and an RPM differential. The constant K3 can be selectable. The following<br>
equation shows the relationship:<br><br>
[0032] Alternatively, in step 150, control may choose to neglect<br>
RPM and calculate a MAF differential in step 160 from a constant K4 and a<br>
MAP change. The constant K4 can be selectable. The following equation<br>
shows the relationship:<br><br><br>
10<br>
[0033] Otherwise, control calculates a MAF differential by taking into<br>
account interactions between MAP and RPM, an RPM differential, a MAP<br>
differential, and a constant K0 in step 170. The constant K0 can be selectable.<br>
The following equation shows the relationship:<br><br>
[0034] Based on the MAF differential, an air per cylinder value can<br>
be calculated. In step 180, control adds the MAF differential to a calculated<br>
MAF per cylinder (MAFPC) value. The MAFPC is calculated from the MAF,<br>
the RPM and a constant value. The constant value is determined from the<br>
number of revolutions per cycle and the number of cylinders per engine. For<br>
a four stroke, two revolutions per cycle, eight cylinder engine, the constant<br>
value is 15. Where 60 minutes per second is multiplied by 2 revolutions per<br>
cycle and divided by 8 cylinders per engine The equation for MAFPC with the<br>
constant value 15 is shown as:<br><br>
[0035] Referring now to Figure 4, a graph plotting example results<br>
of the correction method applied to a four stroke eight cylinder engine is<br>
shown. Time of execution in seconds is displayed along the x-axis at 200.<br>
MAF per cylinder per RPM is displayed along the left side y-axis at 210.<br>
Throttle position in percent is displayed along the right side y-axis at 220.<br>
Throttle position values plotted in percent illustrate a transient condition of the<br>
engine at 230. Speed density values calculated from traditional regressive<br>
test data is shown at 240. MAF per cylinder values without the inclusion of<br>
the correction method is shown at 250. The effectiveness of the new MAF per<br>
cylinder correction calculation is shown at 260 where the plotted calculated<br>
MAF per cylinder value including the correction term nearly matches the<br>
values for the traditional speed density calculation.<br><br>

29.	The method of claim 26 further comprising calculating a mass<br>
airflow per cylinder value based on said correction value.<br>
30.	The method of claim 29 further comprising controlling fuel of<br>
said engine based on said mass airflow per cylinder value<br>
31.	The method of claim 29 further comprising controlling an<br>
exhaust gas recirculation system based on said mass airflow per cylinder<br>
value.<br>
32.	The method of claim 29 further comprising controlling a smoke<br>
control system based on said mass airflow per cylinder value.<br><br>
A mass airflow sensor measurement correction system for a<br>
turbocharged diesel engine operating under transient conditions includes a<br>
signal input device that generates an engine speed signal based on an engine<br>
speed of a turbocharged diesel engine. A control module receives the engine<br>
speed signal and calculates a correction value of mass airflow from a<br>
differential of the engine speed signal and a constant.<br></td>
