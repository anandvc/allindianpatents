TITLE<br>
A PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL FROM SUGAR BEET<br>
APPLICANT<br>
PRAJ INDUSTRIES LIMITED of Praj House, Bavdhan, Pune - 411021, Maharashtra, India, an Indian company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for production of ethanol from sugar beet. PRIOR ART<br>
Production of ethanol has been done by the fermentation of sugars. All beverage ethanol and most of the industrial ethanol as well as fuel ethanol are made even today by this process. A type of raw materials which are used for ethanol production by fermentation are sugar bearing substances such as molasses - a by-product of sugar industry, sugar cane juice, sugar beet juice etc. These raw materials contain sugars that can be directly fermented. Another type of raw materials which are used for ethanol production by fermentation are starch bearing substances (Canadian patent 1143677, WO 0242483, US 5677154) which include grains such as sorghum, rice, wheat, barley, corn etc. and tubers such as cassava or potato etc. These starches are polymers of hexose sugars and need to be broken down to simple sugars either by enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis. Still another type of raw materials which are used for ethanol production by fermentation are cellulosic materials (US 5258293, US 4612286, WO 0218610, US 5677154, US 6258175, US 6090595, US 5932456) which include lignocellulosic substances like straw, corncobs, wood wastes, bagasse and waste paper etc. These have been used mainly on lab and pilot scales although work on commercial scales has been initiated. They contain cellulose and hemicellulose, which have to be chemically and/or enzymatically hydrolyzed to obtain sugars used by yeast for the fermentation to ethanol. The yeast cells can ferment only hexoses such as D-glucose, D-fructose and D-mannose etc. but not pentose sugars.<br>
Thus, in the conventional methods, fermentation processes for the production of ethanol at industrial scales mainly use substances containing sugar and starch. The fermentation process can either batch, feed batch or continuous fermentation (US 4562154, US 4310629, US 3737323, US 3705841, US 3940492). The limitation of using starchy substances is that pretreatment is essential for conversion of starch to Glucose. The limitation of using molasses is that it contains many inhibitory substances which reduce the extraction of sugar from sugar cane. The conventional extraction of sugars from sugar beet root for sugar production is focused on extraction of sugars in the form of sucrose (RU 2186113, PL 287522, PL 289774). The extraction of sugars for ethanol fermentation can become more simple process by way of extractive hydrolysis, where sucrose along with glucose, fructose and additional sugar from cellulosic pulp and other non-fermenting solids e.g. proteins can be safely extracted to use it as a fermentation medium. One of the limitations of using sugar beet juice and juice from other sources is that these contain 12-16% fermentable sugars,<br><br>
increasing its susceptibility to microbial spoilage and lowering its keeping quality. Higher the concentration of sugar and solids, better is the keeping quality of the juice / syrup, since microbial activity is inhibited.<br>
Another major problem associated with conventional alcohol fermentation is the generation of large amounts of effluents that need to be treated before disposal, adding substantially to the operational cost of the entire process and also the capital investment required for building such plants. Most conventional processes are operated in the batch or semi-continuous mode and require long fermentation times of 35-60 hours. STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process for production of ethanol from sugar beet comprising steps of:<br>
(a)	cleaning sugar beet roots in a rotary drum type cleaner with fresh water or with recycled condensate water followed by size reduction by a beet shredder;<br>
(b)	subjecting the shredded sugar beet as obtained by step(a) to extractive hydrolysis involving passing of the shredded sugar beet through a countercurrent hydrolysis reactor containing a liquid medium and an enzyme or a combination of enzymes, with a residence time ranging from 60 minutes to 150 minutes, wherein the liquid medium is selected from fresh water and a combination of fresh water, distillery effluent obtained after distillation, hot condensate obtained from the step of juice concentration as herein described and dewatered juice and wherein further liquid medium constitutes 80 to 130% by weight of sugar beet and the pH of the liquid medium is maintained between 2.0 to 8.0 by addition of an acid/alkali and the temperature of the liquid medium is maintained in the range of 40 to 85Â°C and wherein further an enzyme is selected from cellulases, pectinases, invertases and a combination thereof, and wherein said enzyme or combination of enzymes is added in dosage of 0.005 to 0.2% by weight of feedstock;<br>
(c)	separating out the primary juice and primary pulp from the hydrolysed mixture obtained by step (b) by means of screw press;<br>
(d)	subjecting the primary juice obtained by step (c ) to filtration, clarification and concentration to a final solid ranging from 18% to 72% and wherein said concentration is carried out by evaporation in falling film, forced circulation, corrugated tube or fluidized bed single or multiple effect evaporation system;<br><br>
(e)	subjecting the primary pulp obtained by step(c) to dewatering by dewatering mill, recycling the dewatered juice to hydrolysis reactor for extractive hydrolysis and drying the dewatered pulp to obtain dried pulp;<br>
(f)	subjecting the concentrated juice obtained by step(d) to fermentation by using yeast and by feeding the concentrated juice into the fermentation system in a continuous mode, wherein yeast used is Saccharomyces cerevasiae and wherein said fermentation is carried out at a temperature of 30 to 33Â°C over a period of 10 to 22 hours, obtaining fermented mash;<br>
(g)	introducing the fermented mash obtained by step (f) into yeast gravity settler wherein the yeast clumps together to form floes and settles under the influence of gravity which is recycled into the fermentation system whereas the supernatant is subjected to distillation to obtain ethanol and the effluent generated from the distillation is used for pre-heating the fermented medium and the cooled effluent is recycled into the fermentation system as well as into extractive hydrolysis reactor.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>
In the accompaning diagrams:<br>
Diagram  1:  Shows  schematic  drawing  of extractive  hydrolysis  and juice<br>
preparation with condensate, dewatered juice and distillery effluent recycle;<br>
Diagram 2: Shows schematic representation of fermentation plant.<br>
Diagram 3: Shows layout of the plant.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The detailed invention explained in diagram No 1 comprises of the following<br>
steps, size reduction / shredding the roots to appropriate small size, extractive<br>
hydrolysis,   separation   of  sugar  containing  juice,   evaporation   of juice  to<br>
concentrated syrup suitable for ethanol fermentation. The invention also features<br>
new concepts such as extractive hydrolysis and recycling condensate water and<br>
effluent to reduce effluent to be treated and disposed thereby reducing water and<br>
energy requirements of the plant.<br>
For producing ethanol from sugar beet root, sugar beet roots are first cleaned in<br>
a rotary drum type cleaner to remove dirt and soil.   Process condensates are<br>
used to minimize the fresh water requirement (as shown in diagram 1).   Mud<br>
water after filtration is recycled and the dirty water is sent for irrigation.<br>
The sugars are present within the cellular part of the sugar beef root tissue.<br>
Normal crushing and thereby juice separation which is done in case of sugarcane<br>
does not help to extract the juice from sugar beet root. For extracting the sugar<br>
containing juice from sugar beet it is necessary to carry out size reduction of<br>
beet.    The size and the physical condition of the cossettes are of great<br>
importance for counter current extractive hydrolyser.<br><br>
In general coarser cossettes require more heat and longer time for diffusion / extraction of sugar. Whereas, the short cossettes and fine pulp seriously interfere with the Hydrolysis operation by plugging Hydrolyser screen. The shredding of sugar beet is done in such a way so that maximum surface area should be available for extractive hydrolysis without hindering the performance of process. Clean sugar beet root are conveyed to beet shredder for size reduction. The resultant mass coming out of size reducer / shredder has size suitable for extractive hydrolysis.<br>
Extractive hydrolysis is the process in which part of sucrose molecules present in the juice undergo partial or complete hydrolysis in to glucose and fructose which thereby due to smaller in size they come out easily from the cells. The said enzymes like cellulases, pectinases and invertases help in increasing the yield of fermentable sugars. The use of enzymes helps to extract more sugar in the form of glucose and fructose from the cellulosic part of sugar beet root. The application of pectinases, Cellulases and invertases (individually or in combination of different enzymes) is done at appropriate dosage levels on the basis of sugar beet root.<br>
Water requirement for extracting sucrose and other reducing and non-reducing sugar from sugar beet varies from 80% to 130% on beet weight. The water required for extractive hydrolysis can be individual or a combination of distillery effluent, condensate, dewatered juice and fresh water (as shown in diagram 1). Due to the colloidal substances present in the different water streams, care has to be taken to minimize the colloidal substances in the different water streams. Some of the water streams like pulp water and distillery effluent contains 0.5<br><br>
to 1.5% sugar. Therefore, it should be returned to a point within the hydrolyser where the juice solids concentration is about equal to that of incoming water stream.<br>
Optimum temperature for extractive hydrolysis is normally in the range of Temperature 40 to 85Â°C. The temperature selection is mainly selected on the basis of following factors: Denaturation of enzyme, extraction of sugar, the thermal behaviour of cell wall specially of its pectic component, enzymatic reactions, bacterial activity and pressability of the pulp. This is further supported by the pH. Which is normally in the range between 2.00 to 8.00 and temperature. pH is generally adjusted by suitable acid / alkali. The shredded beet passes in the countercurrent hydrolysis reactor with an appropriate residence time ranging between 60 minutes to 150 minutes.<br>
A specially designed equipment similar to conventional diffuser concept, but with modified designs and process operation is used for extractive hydrolysis of sugars for ethanol fermentation.<br>
The liquid containing dissolved solids is separated out from primary pulp by screw press / Dewatering mill. The dewatered juice is filtered from extraneous matters by rotary screen and preheated before sending it as imbibition water for extractive hydrolysis.<br>
The primary juice obtained during extractive hydrolysis is filtered and clarified in settlers. This clean Juice is further concentrated by evaporation in falling film, forced circulation, corrugated tube or fluidized bed single or multiple effect evaporation system. The concentration of beet juice so produced can be done to different final<br><br>
solid ranging from 18% to 72% w/w depending upon the requirement of immediate processing or storage of the same for using as raw material for processing in to ethanol as and when required.<br>
The concentration of juice helps to store the same for Itfng periods of time without causing damage to the sugar content due td its towâ.w.ater activity and can be used as a substrate for a fermentation proces|"to' produce ethanol. Concentrated Beet syrup so produced is used as raw material for fermentation.<br>
Beet syrup (preferably with 18-78 % solids) is introduced into the fermentation system at a defined and slow rate (as shown in diagram 1). The process is to be operated in the continuous mode. A battery of 2-6 fermentors or more is used depending on the plant capacity. The final sugar concentration to be maintained is preferably between 14-20%, as per requirement.<br>
Flocculating strain of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevasiae) are inoculated<br>
right from the start i.e. when syrup is being added and being diluted.<br>
This has certain advantages over addition of yeast after the syrup has<br>
been diluted viz.:<br>
Yeast starts fermenting sugars immediately leading to better utilization of sugar. Continuous conversion of sugar leads to higher concentration of alcohol (preferably 9-11% by volume) as compared to conventional systems wherein 7-8% by volume alcohol is generated.<br>
Yeast ferments sugars to alcohol. Thus sugars as well as alcohol is present at low concentrations right from the start of the<br><br>
fermentation. The yeast is therefore adapted by the time alcohol concentration increases. High concentrations of alcohol are detrimental to yeast.<br>
The fermentation is carried out at a temperature of 30-33Â° C over a. period of 10-22 hours, depending on the requirement of final alcohol concentration.<br>
After the fermentation process is completed, the fermented mash is introduced into a yeast gravity settler. Here, in the absence of any agitation or turbulence, the yeast clumps together to form floes. These settle under the influence of gravity. This yeast can then be separated and recycled for the next fermentation cycle. The recycling of yeast helps to reduce the time involved in inoculum build-up, saves the sugars incurred for preparing the yeast during the process and speedens up the entire process (reduced lag phase).<br>
The supernatant from the yeast settling plant is distilled to form the product, ethanol. The wastewater generated after distillation is called effluent. Effluent generated from distillation system as shown in Diagram 2 is cooled and heat is reused for pre-heating the fermented medium. This cooled effluent is introduced into the fermentation system (as shown in diagram 2) for diluting the syrup to desired sugar concentration, which can be fermented by yeast. The cooled effluent is also recycled to extractive hydrolysis section (As shown in diagram 1) as per requirement.<br>
This reduces considerably the effluent that needs to be treated before it is finally disposed off. Up to a minimum value of 2.5 to 5 liters<br><br>
instead of the normal / conventional 10 to 14 liters of effluent per liter of alcohol produced. The low quantity of effluent thus produced, also has very low organic load (BOD/ COD), making it suitable for further waste treatment. This can be further reduced to 0.5 to 1 liters of effluent per liter of alcohol produced by mean of evaporation. Which then be sold as cattle feed by mixing it with dried pulp.<br><br>
