Background of the invention The latest trend that has, of late, crept into the pharmaceutical industry is the studies on polymorphism in drugs and the difference in the activity of different polymorphic forms of a given drug. By the term polymorphism we mean to mclude different physical forms, crystal forms, crystalline / liquid crystalline / non-crystalline (amorphous) forms. This has especially become very<br><br>
interesting after observmg that many antibiotics, antibacterials, tranquilizers etc., exhibit polymorphism and some/one of the polymorphic forms of a given drug exhibit superior bio-availability and consequently show much higher activity' compared to other polymorphs. Sertraline, Frentizole, Ranitidine, Sulfathiazole. Indomethacme etc. are some of the important examples of pharmaceuticals, which exhibit polymorphism. Polymorphism in drugs is a topic of current mteresi and is evident from the host of patents being granted. To cite a few, US 5700820 discloses six polymorphic forms of Troglitazone, US 5248699 discusses about five polymorphic forms of Sertraline hydrochloride while EP 014590 describes four polymorphic forms of Frentizole. EP 490648 and EP 022527 also deal with the subject of polymorphism in drugs.<br>
Several references discloses the structure of 5-[4-[[3-methyl-4-Qxo-3.4-<br>
dihydroquinazolin-2-yi]methoxyJbenzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione potassium salt<br>
but no such reference touch upon the possibility / observation that 5-[4-[[3-<br>
methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl]methoxy]benzyi]thiazo!idine-2.4-<br>
dione potassium salt exists m different polymorphic Forms. There is no<br>
published literature regarding such an observation till date. Polymorphism in<br>
drugs is a topic of current interest and is evident from the host of patents bemg<br>
granted to cite a few US 5,248,699 discusses about five polymorphic forms of<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride while EP 014590, describes four polymorphic forms of<br>
Frentizole EP 490648 and EP 022527, six polymorphic forms of Troglitazone<br>
WO 97/27191 also deal with the subject of polymorphism in drugs. The fact that<br>
polymorphism	in	5-[4-[[3-M ethyl-4-0X0-3,4-dih ydroquinazo lin-2-<br>
yl]methoxy]henzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione potassium salt has not been studied earlier coupled with the current interest in the field of polymorphism in drugs prompted us to take-up this investigation. Our observations and results form the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
With a view to prevent/cure the chronic complications of diabetes, research is being conducted round the world in recent times. 5-[4-[[3-methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl]methoxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione<br><br>
potassium salt is being considered as one of the effective anti-diabetic drugs<br>
having multi-purpose activity not only acting on diabetes itself but also on the<br>
reduction of the triglycerides and also on the accompanying complications<br>
mentioned above. Indeed the said 5-[4-[[3-methyi-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-<br>
2-yI]methoxy]benzyl]thtazolidine-2,4-dione     potassium     salt	is     under<br>
development for the treatment of diabetes and related disorders.<br>

solvates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them or their mixaires having enhanced activities, without toxic effect or with reduced toxic effect.<br>

On the other hand, solid state techniques like Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Powder X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD) and Infra Red spectroscopy (IR) revealed the difference among these Forms,<br>
Brief Description of the Figures<br>
X-ray powder diffraction paftem has been obtained on a Rigaku D/Max 2200 model diffractometer equipped with horizontal gonimometer in 0/2 0 geometry. The copper K a ( &gt;.=1.5418A) radiation was used and the sample was scanned between 3-45 degrees 20,<br>
Differential scanning calorimeter was performed on a Shimadzu DSC-50 equipped with a controller. The data was collected on to a Pentium PC using a Shimadzu TA-50 software. The samples weighed in aluminum cells were heated from room temperature to 350 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C /mm. The empty aluminum cell was used as a reference. Dry nitrogen gas was purged through DSC cell continuously throughout the analysis at a flow of 30 ml/min. Fig. 1 is a characteristic X-ray powder diffraction pattern of novel crystalline<br>

The novel crystalline Form of the formula (I) as defined above are clinically administered to mammals, including man, via either oral, nasal, pulmonary, ffansdermal or parenteral, rectal, depot, subcutaneous, intravenous, mtraurethrai. mtramusciilar, intranasal, ophthalmic solution or an omtmenr. Administration by the oral route is preferred, being more convenient and avoiding the possible pain and irritation of injection. However, in circumsiances where the patient cannot swallow the medication, or absorption following oral administration is impaired, as by disease or other abnormality, it is essential that the drug be administered parenterally. By either route, the dosage is in die range of about O.OI to about 100 mg / kg body weight of the subject per day or preferably about 0.01 to about 30 mg / kg body weight per day administered singly or as a divided dose. However, the optimum dosage for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for treatment, generally smaller doses being administered initially and thereafter increments made to determine the most suitable dosage.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous or organic solutions. The active ingredient will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in the amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage in the range as described above. Thus, for oral administration, the polymorphic form can be combined with a suitable solid or liquid carrier or diluent to form capsules, tablets, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions, may, if desired, contain additional components such as flavourants, sweeteners, excipients and<br><br>
the like. For parental administration, the novel crystalline Form can be combined with sterile aqueous or organic media to form injectable solutions or suspensions. For example, solutions in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and the like can be used, as well as aqueous solutions of water-soluble pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts or salts with base of die compounds. Aqueous solutions whh the active ingredient dissolved in poly hydroxy lated castor oil may also be used for injectable solutions. The injectable solutions prepared in this manner can then be administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneous ly, or intramuscularly, with intramuscular administration being preferred ui humans.<br>
For nasal administration, the preparation may contam the novel crystalline Form of the present invention dissolved or suspended in a liquid carrier, in particular an aqueous carrier, for aerosol application. The carrier may contain additives such as solubilizing agents, such as propylene glycol, surfactants, absorption enhancers' such as lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) or cyclodextrin or preservatives such as parabenes.<br>
Tablets, dragees or capsules having talc and / or a carbohydrate carried binder or the like are particularly suitable for any oral application. Preferably, carriers for tablets, dragees or capsules include lactose, com starch and / or potato starch. A syrup or elixir can be used in cases where a sweetened vehicle can be employed.<br>
A typical tablet production method is exemplified below :<br>
Tablet Production Example :<br>
a) 1) Active mgredient	30 g<br>
2)	Lactose	95 g<br>
3)	Com starch	30 g<br>
4)	Carboxymethyl cellulose       44 g<br>
5)	Magnesium stearaie	1 g<br>
200 g for 1000 tablets<br><br>
The ingredients 1 to 3 are uniformly blended with water and granulated after drying under reduced pressure. The ingredient 4 and 5 are mixed well with the granules and compressed by a tabletting machine to prepare 1000 tablets each<br><br>
The ingredients 1-4 are uniformly moistened with an aqueous solution of 5 and granulated after drying under reduced pressure. Ingredient 6 is added and granules are compressed by a tabletting machine to prepare 1000 tablets containing 30 mg of ingredient 1.<br>
The invention is explained in detail in the examples given below which are provided by way of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
