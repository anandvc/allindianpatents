Metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is the technique, which is commonly employed for the deposition of thin films of compound semiconductors on to a substrate such as silicon. MOCVD technique is also being used in electronic industries for coating or doping a substrate. The important criteria for effective reagent i.e. precursor to be used in MOCVD are the volatility of the precursor, clear decomposition without rendering impurities into the grown film. The electrical properties of the film, depends upon the purity of the precursors. For the preparation of compound semiconductors by MOCVD method the precursors of purity better than 99.999% is required.<br>

SUMMARY:<br>
The invention relates to An electronic grade Di-isopropyl telluride (DIPTe) of atleast 99.9999%<br>
purity.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for preparation of an electronic grade Di-isopropyl<br>
telluride (DIPTe) of atleast 99.9999% purity. By reduction of elemental tellurium with sodium<br>
borohydride, reacting of the resulting monotelluride with isopropylbromide followed by<br>
extraction of DIPTe.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION:<br>
Di-isopropyl telluride (DIPTe) is synthesized by reducing tellurium metal to Te2- followed be subsequent reaction with isopropyl bromide. The synthesis of DIPTe is optimized in such a way so that the formation of Di-isopropyl ditelluride (DEPDTe) is avoided. Distillation of the product mixture under reduced pressure yield pure DIPTe.<br>
Tellurium slurry is prepared by adding finely divided tellurium powder in a solvent. The solvent is selected from isopropyl alcohol and diethyl ether and the kind. Solvents are purified by conventional procedures in quartz assemblies under argon atmosphere. A three necked flask equipped with a gas inlet, double wall cooled condenser and pressure equalizing funnel is flame<br>
dried and flushed with argon gas. Tellurium slurry is taken in the reaction flask and argon gas is bubbled through it to create inert atmosphere. A freshly prepared sodium hydroxide is added into the slurry of tellurium in the reaction flask followed by the addition of a solution of sodium borohydride.<br>
The temperature rises to 85 to 90 degree C accompanied with evolution of gas. The temperature is maintained preferably at 90 degree C by an oil bath. Sodium hydroxide maintains the pH of the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture should be basic in nature and pH from 8 to 10 is maintained. Sodium borohydride solution is prepared in degassed water; and is added slowly to the reaction mixture with constant stirring. The slurry of gray tellurium starts turning purple being the characteristic of disodium ditelluride of the formula Na2Te2.<br>
When the evolution of gas stops the remaining half of sodium borohydride solution is added drop wise. The reaction mixture is re-fluxed for more than 24 hours at 90 degree C. At this stage the whole of the tellurium slurry is concentrated and becomes colorless indicating the formation of disodium telluride Na2Te.<br>
The reaction mixture is cooled to 0 degree C and to this is added isopropyl bromide drop wise with constant stirring. The reaction mixture turns yellow as the alkylation proceed. The reaction mixture is heated to 60 degree C with continuous stirring for more than 6 hours in inert atmosphere to complete the reaction. The yellow oily layer is separated from the aqueous layer by extracting with diethyl ether. The ethereal layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and diethyl ether and excess isopropyl bromide are removed by vacuum filtration yellow crude layer is recovered as filtrand. DIPTe is then purified by fractional vacuum distillation of crude layer.<br>
Organotellurium compounds such as dimethyl telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride and methyl allyl telluride are used as precursors for MOVPE growth of II-VI compound semiconductors. Diisopropyl telluride (DIPTe) is employed as the preferred precursor<br>
for achieving the low temperature growth of CdHgTe by MOVPE. DIPTe is used to grow II-VI compound semiconductors by MOVPE.<br>
