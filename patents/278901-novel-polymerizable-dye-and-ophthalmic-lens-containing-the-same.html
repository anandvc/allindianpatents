DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL POLYMERIZABLE DYE AND OPHTHALMIC LENS CONTAINING<br>
THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel polymerizable dye<br>
and its production method, and an ophthalmic lens containing the dye.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Hereinbefore, against a disease caused by a crystalline<br>
lens, such as cataract, a remedial method by an intraocular lens and a<br>
contact lens has been adopted. However, while a natural crystalline<br>
lens has a property that an UV ray and visible lights in a blue range of<br>
about 380 to 500 nm are not transmitted, a polymethyl methacrylate,<br>
etc. which has conventionally most widely been used as a lens material<br>
can transmit visible lights and an UV ray, and thus there has been<br>
such a problem that wearing an ophthalmic lens made of this material<br>
causes dazzling and bluish sight as compared with a natural eye.<br>
Further, it has been considered that retina is damaged by using a<br>
conventional lens material permeating an UV ray.<br>
Hereinbefore, as a material for an ophthalmic lens having<br>
absorption property of an UV ray and visible lights having specific wave<br>
length range (about 380 to 500 nm), a benzophenone type<br>
polymerizable UV-absorbable dye has been known (Japanese Patent<br>
Publication No. H2-232056A). Specifically, the compound has been<br>
obtained by reacting 2,4-dihydroxy-5-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl) phenylazo)<br>
 <br>
- 2 -<br>
benzophenone (UV-PEP) and the like with a compound having a<br>
polymerizable group such as methacryloyl chloride. However, the<br>
pigment disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. H2-232056A<br>
contains no urethane group, and thus when it is used in a large<br>
amount in a foldable intraocular lens made of a soft acrylic acid resin<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a soft foldable intraocular lens), there have<br>
been observed such problems that the implant becomes hard and the<br>
function of the said intraocular lens of inserting into an eye under<br>
bending is prohibited or lowered.<br>
Further, when UV-PEP is reacted with methacrylic acid<br>
according to the disclosure of the patent publication, such a problem<br>
has been accompanied that a product produced by reacting with a<br>
phenolic hydroxyl group is produced as well as the desired product<br>
produced by reacting with a primary hydroxyl group, because UV-PEP<br>
contains one primary hydroxyl group and two phenolic hydroxyl<br>
groups, and thus yield of the desired product is reduced remarkably,<br>
and production in an industrial scale is very difficult because of<br>
difficulty in separation and purification.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>

preferable.<br>
The compound shown by the general formula (4) includes<br>
2-isocyanate ethyl methacrylate, 4-isocyanate butyl methacrylate,<br>
2-isocyanate ethyl acrylate, and the like. Among them, 2-isocyanate<br>
ethyl methacrylate is preferable in a case of using the dye of the<br>
present invention together with other polymerizable UV absorber.<br>
As the compound shown by the general formula (3)<br>
contains one primary hydroxyl group and two phenolic hydroxyl<br>
groups, a large amount of byproducts produced by reaction with the<br>
phenolic hydroxyl group are produced in a case of introducing a<br>
polymerizable double bond into the compound shown by the general<br>
formula (3). And, a polymerizable double bond can selectively be<br>
introduced into the primary hydroxyl group of the compound shown by<br>
the general formula (3) when the compound shown by the general<br>
formula (4) and specific catalyst are used.<br>
In a case of reacting the compound shown by the general<br>
formula (3) with the compound shown by the general formula (4), use<br>
of an additional catalyst is preferable in order to accelerate a reaction<br>
 <br>
- 11 -<br>
speed selectively.<br>
The catalyst used in the present invention includes a base<br>
such as triethylamine, pyridine and sodium acetate, an inorganic salt<br>
such as aluminum chloride, an organic metal compound such as<br>
R2SnCl2 and R2Sn(OCOR')2 (wherein R and R' are respectively and<br>
independently a alkyl group), an acethyl acetonate complex of Fe, Ni,<br>
Mn, Zn, Cu and Al, and the like, and the organic metal compound and<br>
the metal complex are preferable from a viewpoint of suppressing<br>
production of byproducts, among the catalysts, dibutyl tin (IV)<br>
dilaurate and tris(2,4-pentane dionate) iron (III) are still preferable<br>
because they show high selectivity and effective for acceleration of a<br>
reaction rate.<br>
The reaction between the compound shown by the general<br>
formula (3) and the compound shown by the general formula (4) is<br>
generally conducted in a solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform,<br>
dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, benzene,<br>
toluene, carbon tetrachloride, 1,4-dioxan and moldthyl ether.<br>
A ratio of the compound shown by the general formula (3)<br>
to the compound shown by the general formula (4) in 1 L of the solvent<br>
is that 1 to 10 mole, preferably 1 to 2 mole of the compound shown by<br>
the formula (4) to 1 mole of the compound shown by the general<br>
formula (3). When it is less than 1 mole, the compound shown by the<br>
general formula (3) does not react and remains in the system, and thus<br>
purification tends to be difficult, and when it is over 10 mole,<br>
byproducts tend to produce.<br>
An amount of the catalyst to be incorporated is preferably<br>
0.03 to 0.1 mole, still preferably 0.03 to 0.05 mole, relative to 1 L of the<br>
 <br>
- 12 -<br>
solvent. When it is less than 0.03 mole, the reaction rate tends to<br>
slow remarkably, and when it is over 0.1 mole, purification for<br>
removing the catalyst tends to be difficult.<br>
Purification of the object compound after the reaction can<br>
be conducted by a conventional method such as using a column, and<br>
also can be conducted by a simple method such as recrystallization<br>
from an alcohol because the object compound shows high purity. As<br>
the alcohol, a conventionally used one such as methanol and ethanol<br>
is used, and ethanol is preferable because an amount of the solvent<br>
can be reduced.<br>
The polymerizable dye of the present invention contains an<br>
UV absorption and absorption of visible lights having a specific wave<br>
length (about 380 to 500 nm), and shows excellent resistance against<br>
light and chemicals, and further shows high fastness and shows no<br>
elution even when it is polymerized with other monomer, and thus it<br>
can be used as a material of an ophthalmic lens and also as coating<br>
agent, building materials and the like.<br>
The ophthalmic lens of the present invention is obtained<br>
by copolymerizing the above benzophenone type polymerizable dye with<br>
other polymerizable monomer, etc.<br>
As the polymerizable monomer used in the present<br>
invention, there is no specific restriction and one generally used as an<br>
ophthalmic lens material can be used. The examples are as follows:<br>

above are selected and polymerized to give a macromonomer, and this<br>
macromonomer is used as a lens ingremoldnt (monomer for forming a<br>
lens).<br>
The polymerizable dye of the present invention can also be<br>
used for an ophthalmic lens. For example, it can be used in such a<br>
way as the intraocular lens disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 1999-56998A and Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-144538A<br>
and the contact lens disclosed in International Publication No.<br>
2004/06379A, Japanese Patent Publication No. 1994-121826A,<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. S60-142324A and Japanese Patent<br>
Publication No. 1990-196809A.<br>
Herein, "(meth) acrylate" means "acrylate" or<br>
"methacrylate", and this is same in (meth) acryl derivative.<br>
For instance, in a case of obtaining an ophthalmic lens<br>
excellent in oxygen transmittance, a silicone-containing monomer such<br>
as a silicone-containing (meth) acrylate and a silicone-containing<br>
styrene derivative and a fluorine-containing alkyl (meth) acrylate can<br>
be selected, and in a case of controlling hardness of an ophthalmic<br>
lens, an alkyl (meth) acrylate, a styrene derivative including styrene or<br>
(meth) acrylic acid can be selected.<br>
In a case of giving anti-lipid-staining property, a<br>
 <br>
- 16 -<br>
fluorine-containing monomer such as a fluorine-containing alkyl<br>
(meth) acrylate and a fluorine-containing styrene derivative can be<br>
selected. Further, in a case of giving hydrophilic property to a lens or<br>
obtaining a hydrous flexible ophthalmic lens, a monomer containing<br>
hydrophilic group such as a hydroxyl-containing (meth) acrylate,<br>
(meth) acrylamide, an amino alkyl (meth) acrylate, (meth) acrylic acid<br>
and N-vinyl lactum can be selected.<br>
Still further, in order to obtain a lens material having high<br>
refractive index, a monomer containing an aromatic ring such as a<br>
styrene type monomer and a (meth) acrylate containing an aromatic<br>
ring can be selected.<br>
As a material for an ophthalmic lens, a cross-linking agent<br>
or a macromonomer containing two or more polymerizable groups in a<br>
molecule can be used. The monomer is exemplified by ethylene glycol<br>
di (meth) acrylate, moldthylene glycol (meth) acrylate, triethylene glycol<br>
di (meth) acrylate, propylene glycol di (meth) acrylate, dipropylene<br>
glycol di (meth) actrylate, allyl (meth) acrylate, vinyl (meth) acrylate,<br>
trimethylolpropane tri (meth) acrylate, methacryloyloxy ethyl acrylate,<br>
divinyl benzene, diallyl phthalate, diallyl adipate, triallyl isocyanurate,<br>
a-methylene-N-vinyl pyrrolidone, etc. By using these monomers, a tri<br>
dimensional cross-linking structure in the resulting polymer, whereby<br>
physical properties of the material become tough and mechanical<br>
strength and hardness can be increased, and further a homogeneous,<br>
transparent, non-strained, and optically excellent ophthalmic lens can<br>
be obtained. Further, it is also possible to impart durability (chemical<br>
resistance, heat resistance, solvent resistance) to an ophthalmic lens<br>
and to suppress elution of a monomer after polymerization.<br>

The polymerizable dye of the present invention is<br>
preferably used together with an UV ray absorber and/or other dye<br>

2-[2'-hydroxy-5'-(-rnethacryloyloxypropoxy-3'-t-butylphenyl]-5-methyl-<br>
2H-benzotriazole (UV2) in a case of n=3.<br>
The dye other than the polymerizable dye of the present<br>
invention is exemplified by an azo type, an anthraquinone type, a nitro<br>
type or a phthalocyanine type polymerizable dye containing a<br>
polymerizable group such as an acryloyl group, a methacryloyl group,<br>

The object ophthalmic lens (a contact lens, an intraocular<br>
lens, etc.) is obtained by incorporating the above monomer together<br>
with the benzophenone type polymerizable dye of the present invention<br>
in an optional ratio, followed by mixing homogeneously and<br>
copolymerizing.<br>
A ratio of the benzophenone type dye of the present<br>
 <br>
- 27 -<br>
invention is, though depending upon a thickness of a lens, preferably<br>
0.001 to 1 part by weight, still preferably 0.005 to 0.5 part by weight,<br>
more preferably 0.06 part by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of<br>
the total polymerizable monomer mixture constituting an ophthalmic<br>
lens. When the incorporating ratio is less than 0.001 part by weight,<br>
suitable coloring tends to be impossible, and when it is over 1 part by<br>
weight, a color tends to be too dark, and transparency tend to be<br>
reduced, and also the physical properties (for instance strength) tends<br>
to be reduced and further the polymerizable dye tends to be eluted<br>
easily after polymerization.<br>
Further, a ratio of a cross-linking agent to be incorporated<br>
is preferably within a range of 0.01 to 10 parts by weight relative to<br>
100 parts by weight of the total monomer mixture constituting an<br>
ophthalmic lens. When it is less than 0.01 part by weight, its effect<br>
tends to be difficult to obtain, and when it is over 10 parts by weight,<br>
the resulting lens tends to be fragile.<br>
The production of an ophthalmic lens can easily be<br>
conducted by blending homogeneously the polymerizable dye of the<br>
present invention and other ingremoldnts for a lens and if necessary a<br>
polymerization initiator, followed by a method so far been generally<br>
conducted in the technical field. For instance, to a mixture of a<br>
monomer for forming a lens, a polymerizable dye, and the like is added<br>
homogeneously a radical polymerization initiator optionally and the<br>
like, and the resultant is gradually heated within a range of a room<br>
temperature to about 130°C, or irradiated with an electromagnetic<br>
wave such as a micro wave, an UV ray and a radial ray (gamma ray) to<br>
conduct polymerization, whereby a lens material can be formed. The<br>
 <br>
- 28 -<br>
polymerization may be a bulk polymerization or a solution<br>
polymerization using a solvent, etc., and in a case of heat<br>
polymerization, a temperature may be increased in stepwise, and other<br>
various manners can also be applied.<br>
The specific examples of the radical polymerization<br>
initiator are azobisisobutylonitrile, azobisdimethyl valeronitrile, benzoyl<br>
peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, benzoyl<br>
peroxide, etc., and one or two or more thereof is selected to use. An<br>
amount to be used is preferably about 0.01 to 1 part by weight relative<br>
to 100 parts by weight of the total monomer mixture to be polymerized.<br>
In a case of polymerizing with the use of a light, etc., it is preferable to<br>
add further a photo polymerization initiator and a sensitizer.<br>
In a case of molding as an ophthalmic lens such as a<br>
contact lens and an intraocular lens, a molding method so far generally<br>
been conducted by a skilled person can be applied, and, for instance,<br>
there can be applied such a manner that polymerization is conducted<br>
in a suitable mold or container to obtain a stick like, a block like or a<br>
plate like material (polymer), and then the resultant is processed by a<br>
mechanical operation such as a cutting operation and an abrasive<br>
operation, or alternatively a mold having the desired shape is prepared<br>
and polymerization of a monomer is conducted in the mold to obtain a<br>
molded article, and, if necessary, the resultant is subjected to a<br>
mechanical operation.<br>
In a case of molding an intraocular lens, a haptic of the<br>
lens may separately be molded and mounted to the lens, or it may be<br>
molded at the same time (integrated) with the lens.<br>
Further, in order to make a surface of a lens hydrophilic,<br>
 <br>
- 29 -<br>
the lens may be subjected to a plasma treatment, if necessary, and as<br>
a treatment device and method in this case, a so far known<br>
conventional device and method can be applied. Treatment is<br>
preferably conducted under such conditions as in a helium, neon,<br>
argon and other inert gas atmosphere or an air, oxygen, nitrogen,<br>
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other gas atmosphere under<br>
pressure: about 0.0001 to several Torr, discharge: about several to 100<br>
W for several to several ten seconds, and still preferably the gas is air,<br>
oxygen and argon, pressure is about 0.05 to 3 Torr, discharge is about<br>
10 to 60 W and time is several minutes.<br>
In the following, the present invention is explained in more<br>
details referring to Examples, but the present invention is not limited<br>
to those Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Synthesis of 2,4-dihydroxy-5-(4-(2-(N-(2-methacryloyloxyethyl)<br>
carbamoyloxy) ethyl) phenylazo) benzophenone (BMAC) (catalyst:<br>
dibutylstannic (IV) dilaurate, a compound for introducing<br>
polymerizable group: 2-isocyanate ethyl methacrylate)<br>
In a 500 ml three-necked flask, 6.00 g (0.0166 mol) of<br>
2,4-dihydroxy-5-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)	phenylazo)	benzophenone<br>
(UV-PEP) was charged, and 250 ml of dichloromethane was added to<br>
dissolve. To the resultant were added 3.85 g (3.51 mL, 0.0248 mol) of<br>
2-isocyanate ethyl methacrylate and dropped by a syringe two drops of<br>
dibutyl tin (IV) dilaurate. After about 23 hours, the reaction solution<br>
 <br>
- 30 -<br>
was transferred to a 1 L recovery flask and dichloromethane was<br>
evaporated in vacuo. To the residue was added 300 mL of methanol to<br>
give a suspension, followed by stirring and washing for about 2 hours<br>
and filtering in vacuo. The residue on a filter paper was transferred to<br>
a 2L Erlenmeyer flask and 1.5 L of ethanol was added thereto to<br>
dissolve under refluxing by heating with installing a Dimroth<br>
condenser. After keeping standing overnight at room temperature, the<br>
precipitates were recovered by filtration in vacuo, and the resultant<br>
was dried by a vacuum drier at 50°C for about 24 hours to give orange<br>
powder. Yield was 7.81 g (91.1 %).<br>
The resulting compound was analyzed by HPLC to obtain<br>
purity. A column of Finepak SIL C18T-5 250 x 4.6 mm (I.D.) (Nippon<br>
Bunko Kogyo K.K.), and a mobile phase of methanol/distilled<br>
water=80/20 (v/v) were used. Purity was confirmed as 96.8 % from a<br>
peak area ratio at 210 nm.<br>
The *H NMR spectrum of the resulting compound was as<br>
follows:<br>
81.93 (t, 3H, CH3), 2.97-3.01 (2H, CH2), 3.48-3.49 (2H, CH2), 4.20-4.23<br>
(2H, CH2), 4.30-4.33 (2H, CH2), 4.92 (1H, NH), 5.58 (1H, CH=), 6.11<br>
(1H, CH=), 6.57 (t, 1H, Ar-H), 7.26-7.75 (m, Ar-H), 8.21 (t, 1H, Ar-H),<br>
12.89 (t, 1H, Ar-OH), 13.96 (t, 1H, Ar-OH)<br>
From the measurement result, two signals considered to<br>
correspond to a phenolic hydroxyl group were observed at 8 12.89 and<br>
13.96, and thus this compound was confirmed as BMAC wherein a<br>
polymerizable group was introduced into a primary hydroxyl group of<br>
UV-PEP.<br>
An infrared absorption spectrum of the resulting<br>
 <br>
- 31 -<br>
compound was measured by an infrared spectrophotometer (Spectrum<br>
One K.K. Perkinelmer), whereby two absorptions (1688, 1720 cm"1)<br>
considered to be by a carbonyl group other than absorption by a<br>
carbonyl group originated from UV-PEP (1624 cm"1) were observed.<br>
From this, it was confirmed that a polymerizable group was introduced<br>
into the resulting compound.<br>
Further, a UV visible absorption spectrum (280 to 800 nm)<br>
was measured by a UV visible light spectrophotometer (UV-3150 K.K.<br>
Shimazu Seisakusho) (Figure 1). As the result of the measurement,<br>
the resulting compound contained UV ray absorption characteristics at<br>
380 nm or less and visual light absorption characteristics at about<br>
380-500 nm.<br>

2,4-hydroxy-5-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl) phenylazo) benzophenone (UV-PEP)<br>
and 0.420 g (1.19 mmol) of tris(2,4-pentane dionate) iron (III) were<br>
charged, and 700 ml of dichloromethane was added to dissolve. To<br>
the resultant were added 8.80 mL (62.2 mmol) of 2-isocyanate ethyl<br>
methacrylate, followed by stirring with installing a Dimroth condenser.<br>
After about 127 hours, the reaction solution was evaporated in vacuo.<br>
To the residue was added 1 L of methanol to give a suspension,<br>
followed by stirring and washing for about 1 hour and filtering in vacuo.<br>
The residue on a filter paper was dissolved in 200 mL of chloroform.<br>
 <br>
- 32 -<br>
About 50 g of silica gel was suspended in a suitable amount of<br>
chloroform and poured into Hirsch type funnel (60 mm) wherein a<br>
filter paper was equipped to fill the paper. A filter paper was placed<br>
on the silica gel filled and a chloroform solution in which the above<br>
prepared residue was dissolved was poured thereto. The solution was<br>
filtered and additionally about 600 mL of chloroform was gradually<br>
poured to recover all filtered solution, followed by distilling in vacuo.<br>
The resulting residue as suspended in 3 L of ethanol to dissolve under<br>
refluxing by heating and filtered under heating. After keeping<br>
standing overnight at room temperature, the precipitates were<br>
recovered by filtration in vacuo, and the resultant was dried by a<br>
vacuum drier at 50°C for about 23 hours to give crystalline orange<br>
powder. Yield was 19.02 g (88.8 %).<br>
Similarly to Example 1, the resulting compound was<br>
subjected to HPLC to obtain purity. Purity was 98.7 %.<br>
Further, as the result of measurement of the 1H NMR<br>
spectrum of the resulting compound similar to Example 1, the<br>
compound showed the same spectrum as in Synthetic Example 1 and<br>
two signals considered to correspond to a phenolic hydroxyl group were<br>
observed at 5 12.89 and 13.96, and thus this compound was as in<br>
Example 1, confirmed as BMAC wherein a polymerizable group was<br>
introduced into a primary hydroxyl group of UV-PEP.<br>
The infrared absorption spectrum and the UV visual light<br>
absorption spectrum of the resulting compound were the same as in<br>
the compound obtained in Example 1.<br>

in 100 ml of benzene, and to the solution was gradually added a<br>
methacryloyl chloride solution (2.41 g/50 ml benzene) with agitation.<br>
After keeping standing for about 3 hours, the solution was washed<br>

ethyl acrylate and 0.5 part by weight of 2,2'-azobis (2,4-dimethyl<br>
valeronitrile) were blended homogeneously, and the resultant was<br>
poured into a lens mold. Then the blended solution was polymerized<br>
at 80°C for 40 minutes to form a lens. The resulting lens was used as<br>
a sample for measuring light transmittance of a ray having a wave<br>
length of 220 to 800 nm (Figure 2). Further, after the lens was<br>
subjected to elusion treatment by immersing in ethanol at 40°C for 24<br>
hours, the light transmittance was measured again, whereupon no<br>
change in the spectrum before and after the elution treatment. This<br>
shows that the polymerizable dye was chemically bonded in the<br>
material.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A lens was prepared by the same manner as in Example 3<br>

The resulting lens was used as a sample, and after the<br>
same manner as in Example 3, light transmittance of a ray at a wave<br>
length of 220 to 800 nm was measured (Figure 3). As a result, no<br>
change in spectrum of light transmittance before and after elution<br>
treatment, and thus it was confirmed that no elution after<br>
polymerization occurred even co-use of other UV absorber together<br>
with the polymerizable dye of the present invention.<br>

urethane bond of the present invention contains an UV ray absorbing<br>
part and a visible light (about 380 to 500 nm) absorbing part in one<br>
molecule, it shows light transmittance near to a natural crystalline,<br>
and thus it is useful as a material of an ophthalmic lens. Further,<br>
due to the urethane bond contained, the polymerizable dye of the<br>
present invention is more flexible than conventional polymerizable dyes,<br>
particularly even when it is used in a fordable intraocular lens, its<br>
flexible properties are not damaged, and as a chromophore and a<br>
polymerizable group are sterically-separated form each other, it is<br>
valuable also from such a viewpoint that no polymerization<br>
suppression is given. Still further, the said polymerizable dye can be<br>
copolymerized with other material for an ophthalmic lens, and thus the<br>
resulting material for an ophthalmic lens shows remarkably excellent<br>
resistances against light and chemicals, and also excellent fastness<br>
and additionally elution from the ophthalmic lens can be suppressed.<br>
Therefore, it is possible by using the polymerizable dye of the present<br>
invention to obtain an excellent ophthalmic lens having high safety, no<br>
decoloring nor color change due to elution of a dye. Further, it can be<br>
used to coating agent and a building material other than the above<br>
use.<br>
 <br>
- 37 -<br>
Still additionally, according to the method of producing the<br>
benzophenone type polymerizable dye of the present invention, even<br>
when a material such as UV-PEP or others containing one primary<br>
hydroxyl group and two phenolic hydroxyl groups is used, an<br>
isocyanate compound containing a polymerizable double bond can be<br>
reacted selectively with a primary hydroxyl group, and thus the object<br>
compound can be obtained at a high yield. Thus purification can be<br>
simple, and complex working can be reduced, and also it is<br>
advantageous from cost point of view.<br>
