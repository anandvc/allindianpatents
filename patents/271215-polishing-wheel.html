POLISHING WHEEL<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a polishing wheel arranged to polish an article, and more<br>
particularly an optical article, for example, an optical lens. This invention also relates to a<br>
method of manufacturing a polishing wheel, a method for polishing an article, and a<br>
computer program product for polishing an article.<br>
The article according to the invention may be made of, for example, glass, plastic or<br>
metal, such as, for example, a mould. The article of the invention includes any optical<br>
article for either concentrating or diverging light. Said optical article may be part of an<br>
optical system such as, for example, a telescope, a microscope or a camera.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Optical lenses are used in ophthalmic devices such as eyeglasses and contact<br>
lenses and in precision instruments such as cameras, telescopes, microscopes, and range<br>
finders. These lenses are typically made by imparting a specific curvature on a first side<br>
of a transparent material such as mineral glass or plastic, and a different curvature on the<br>
opposite side of the material. By creating a curve on the second side of the lens that is<br>
different than the curve on the first side of the lens, light can be focused to a desired<br>
point.<br>
The process of producing a lens generally begins by first grinding or otherwise<br>
machining a glass or plastic blank to achieve the approximate curvature or curvatures<br>
desired. The grinding process creates surface roughness on the surface of the lens, which<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
tends to undesirably scatter light passing to or from the lens. To reduce this surface<br>
roughness, the lens is polished to obtain a smoother surface. In addition, polishing can<br>
provide a more precise curvature to the lens surface allowing the light exiting the lens to<br>
be more accurately focused.<br>
Blanks used for eyeglasses typically are made by injection molding or casting a<br>
thermosetting polymer such as diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) (CR-39) or<br>
polycarbonate. These blanks typically measure between 70 and 80 mm in diameter and<br>
between 8 and 20 mm in thickness. The blank may also include a base curve that is close<br>
to the desired power of the lens. Once a blank with a base curve is formed, its back is<br>
ground to make a lens of the desired power (e.g. to match the eyeglasses prescription).<br>
Most automated grinding machines have a cutter that is held stationary while<br>
rotating the lens and moving it along two axes with respect to the cutter.   If the lens<br>
requires a curvature in addition to simple spherical and/or cylindrical cuts, the lens can be<br>
ground while tilted to produce an offset optical center (i.e. an induced prism). After the<br>
lens is ground, it is sanded and then polished. Polishing machines typically utilize a lap,<br>
which is an abrasive pad attached to a block having a matching, but reversed, curvature<br>
of the lens. The lap and lens are rubbed together to remove the surface roughness left by<br>
the grinding process and to make any final corrections to the curvature of the lens. This<br>
polishing method has the disadvantage of requiring a  separate lap  for each  lens<br>
prescription.  Thus, a typical lens processing facility will have hundreds if not thousands<br>
of different  laps available to produce eyeglasses conforming to a  wide range of<br>
prescription requirements.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
More advanced polishing machines have recently been developed that utilize a<br>
pivoting head which carries a tool spindle to which a shaping tool, such as a polishing<br>
wheel, is attached. With respect to the lens, the rotating polishing wheel moves along a<br>
first horizontal axis (the "X-axis") having a left-right orientation and along a second<br>
horizontal axis (the "Y-axis") having a front-rear orientation. In addition, the spindle<br>
upon which the wheel is mounted moves vertically along a "Z-axis". The spindle also<br>
moves in a circular direction about a "C-axis". These advanced polishing machines<br>
typically utilizing a positional feed-back system to control the movement of the wheel.<br>
Polishing wheels have a fine abrasive surface that can reduce the surface<br>
roughness of a lens when the abrasive surface contacts and moves across the surface of<br>
the lens. The surface of the wheel is typically curved in order to follow the curved<br>
contour of the lens surface. Thus, polishing wheels typically are of a cylindrical or<br>
spherical shape.<br>
Generally, these polishing wheels have an axis and corresponding axial cavity for<br>
receiving a rotatable motor-driven spindle. The contact surface of the wheel is<br>
symmetrical with respect to this axis in order to allow for continuous contact between the<br>
wheel and lens while the wheel or lens is rotating about an axis.<br>
Conventional polishing wheels typically have a urethane skin that is cut from a<br>
flat sheet and glued onto a spherical natural rubber substrate that surrounds a spherical<br>
aluminum hub. The flat sheet is cut in such a way as to allow it to be folded to conform<br>
to the spherical shape of the substrate. However, this folding technique invariably results<br>
in a discontinuous surface and gaps in the skin tend to form at the junctions of the folds.<br>
These cans are partially responsible for the limited life of the polishing tool because they<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/01421
can catch on the edge of the lens during the polishing process and begin to tear away<br>
from the rubber substrate. Over time, the outer skin can also begin to crack at the<br>
intersection of the gaps.<br>
The urethane skins known in the art are also difficult to replace once they become<br>
worn. Removing a worn urethane skin from the rubber substrate and replacing it with a<br>
new one requires the use of toxic chemicals. The rubber substrate of known wheels also<br>
suffer the tendency of pulling away from their respective aluminum hub. In addition, it is<br>
often difficult to produce and maintain a rubber substrate and outer urethane shell that is<br>
concentric with the aluminum hub. Polishing wheels with substrates, outer shells, or both<br>
that are not concentric to the hub can impart low frequency waves onto the surface of the<br>
lens during the polishing process which, in turn, reduces the accuracy of the polishing<br>
operation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a polishing wheel having a continuous abrasive<br>
layer. More specifically, provided is a polishing wheel having a hub attached to a<br>
polyurethane substrate around which an abrasive layer, with a urethane binder and<br>
polishing grains, is formed. Because the polishing wheel has a continuous polishing<br>
surface without gaps, the likelihood of the abrasive layer splitting or otherwise tearing<br>
during polishing operations is reduced. The substrate layer and abrasive layer of the<br>
present invention also provide the polishing wheel with particularly good characteristics<br>
with respect to vibration, dampening, and rigidity making a gentle abrasive operation<br>
possible. In addition, the urethane substrate is less likely to separate from the hub as<br>
compared to other substrate materials known in the art, thereby extending the useable life<br>
of the polishing wheel.  Finally, polishing wheels according to the present invention are<br>
also much less susceptible to weakening or being destroyed in the event of a machine<br>
malfunction or operator error.<br>
Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention  is a polishing wheel  for<br>
polishing optical lenses comprising a hub having an axial cavity; a polyurethane substrate<br>
that has a spherical outer surface and is affixed to and coaxial with the hub; and a<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
continuous abrasive layer comprising a urethane binder and polishing grains that is<br>
affixed to the outer surface of the substrate layer.<br>
The abrasive layer of the present invention can be formed by coating the<br>
polyurethane substrate with an abrasive composition comprising a urethane binder and<br>
polishing grains. Several coating techniques can be used to apply the abrasive<br>
composition including dip coating, spraying, or casting. Thus, according to another<br>
aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for making a polishing wheel by<br>
providing a polyurethane substrate having a spherical outer surface and being affixed to a<br>
hub having an axial cavity; providing an abrasive composition comprising a urethane<br>
binder and a plurality of polishing grains; and coating the outer surface of the substrate<br>
layer with the abrasive composition to form a continuous spherical abrasive layer on the<br>
outer surface of the substrate layer.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of polishing an optical<br>
lens by contacting the lens with a spherical polishing wheel having a continuous abrasive<br>
layer. This method is especially useful for quick and accurate polishing of both sides of a<br>
lens or a lens having two or more different curvatures, because a single wheel can polish<br>
multiple curvatures thereby eliminating the need to install a different lap for each lens<br>
curve.<br>
A polishing wheel 10 in accordance with the present invention is now described<br>
with reference to Figures 1 - 4. The polishing wheel 10 includes a hub 12 having an axial<br>
cavity 18, a substrate layer 14, and an abrasive layer 16. According to the present<br>
invention, the substrate layer 14 has a spherical outer surface 20. As used hereinafter, the<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
term "spherical" refers to having a shape approximating that of a sphere, including, but<br>
not limited, to spheroids shapes, and semi-spherical shapes such as spherical frustums.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 1 also includes an inner surface 22 at which the<br>
substrate layer 14 is affixed to the hub 12. The continuous abrasive layer 16 is formed<br>
around the spherical outer surface 20 of the substrate layer 14.<br>
While the shape of the polishing wheel 10 may be varied in accordance with its<br>
intended use, the wheel is usually formed with a spherical surface 28 circumscribing the<br>
hub axis 26. In addition, the hub, substrate layer, and abrasive layer are preferably<br>
coaxial to an axis 26.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the hub 12 is made from a metal. Particularly<br>
preferred is aluminum because of its machinability and resistance to corrosion. However,<br>
other metals are also contemplated by the present invention, for example, steel in<br>
particular stainless steel. The hub can also be made from a polymer material like, for<br>
example polycarbonate material or resin material. Advantageously the hub has a modulus<br>
of elasticity bigger than 1000 MPa. The hub 12 may be produced by forging, casting,<br>
machining, or any other suitable manufacturing technique as well known in the art. The<br>
hub 12 can be of any size suitable for polishing lenses and such sizes will be readily<br>
know to those skilled in the art. For example, in certain preferred embodiments, the hub<br>
12 will have a radius from the axis 26 to the outer surface 24 of from about 5 mm to<br>
about 50 mm, more preferably from about 10 mm to about 40 mm, and even more<br>
preferably from about 20 mm to about 30 mm.<br>
The hub 12 preferably has a cavity 18 configured to receive a shaft (not shown) in<br>
any manner as is well known in the art. For example, the cavity 18 may be threaded for a<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
screw-type connection to the shaft or tapered to produce a friction fit with a<br>
complimentary sized shaft. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cavity 18 is<br>
partially threaded and partially smooth, wherein the threaded portion of the shaft is<br>
slightly larger than the smooth portion. In this embodiment, the smooth portion of the<br>
cavity is sized to receive the shaft while the threaded portion is sized to a tool designed to<br>
facilitate removing the wheel from the shaft.<br>
Alternatively, the wheel 10 may be clamped onto the shaft. Such a clamping<br>
arrangement may, for example, involve providing a shaft having an annular flange at one<br>
end and a threaded connection for receiving a bolt at an opposite end, positioning the<br>
shaft through the wheel so that the wheel abuts the flange, and the tightening the nut on<br>
the opposite end of the shaft so that the wheel becomes secured to the shaft.<br>
The shaft on which the hub 12 is mounted can be a rotatable, motor-driven shaft.<br>
Alternatively, the shaft on which the hub 12 is mounted can be a fixed, non-rotating shaft.<br>
In such embodiments, the lens is rotated with respect to the stationary wheel.<br>
Preferably, the hub 12 is constructed with an outer surface 24 that is symmetrical<br>
to the axis 26. Such symmetry will help balance the polishing wheel 10 as it rotates and<br>
will serve to minimize any gyroscopic vibrations that may be created when the wheel is<br>
in contact with the lens.<br>
The substrate layer 14 is made from a polyurethane elastomer that can be affixed<br>
to the hub 12 and that has a Shore A hardness from about 15 to about 35. These<br>
substrates have been found to provide a polishing wheel with particularly good<br>
characteristics with respect to vibration, dampening, and rigidity, which makes a gentle<br>
abrasive operation possible. A wide variety of commercially available castable polyester<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
polyurethanes are suitable for use with the present invention, provided that they have a<br>
Shore A hardness of from about 15 to about 35. One skilled in the art could readily select<br>
a polyurethanes meeting the above criteria. For example, a polyurethane suitable for the<br>
present invention is Cast Urethane Polyester Uniroyal Adiprene 15-20 Shore A with<br>
Santicizer 160 Plasticizer added to increase the compliance of the substrate.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the substrate layer 14 is secured to the hub 12<br>
by casting the polyurethane into an oversized mold around the hub. After the mold is set<br>
and the polyurethane cured, the substrate is precision ground to the desired dimensions.<br>
The substrate can be ground to a size or shape suitable for polishing lenses and such sizes<br>
and shapes will be readily know to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the substrate has a<br>
spherical outer surface 20 that circumscribes and is symmetrical with the axis 26. In<br>
certain preferred embodiments, the substrate will have a thickness as measured radially<br>
from the inner surface 22 to the outer surface 20 from about 3 mm to about 20 mm, more<br>
preferably from about 5 to about 15 mm, and even more preferably from about 5 to about<br>
10 mm.<br>
The abrasive layer 16 functions as the polishing surface of the polishing wheel 10, and<br>
during the polishing process, it is in direct contact with the lens surface. The abrasive<br>
layer contains fine abrasive particles (polishing grains) that when moved across the<br>
surface of the lens, can remove a thin layer from the surface of the lens thereby reducing<br>
the lens' surface roughness. The abrasive layer is typically curved in order to follow the<br>
curved contour of the lens surface.<br>

WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
The abrasive layer 16 is a cured urethane binder in which polishing grains are<br>
embedded. The abrasive layer is formed by coating the substrate layer 14 with an<br>
abrasive composition comprising an uncured liquid urethane binder and a plurality of<br>
polishing grains suspended therein. Any applicable coating technique known in the art<br>
may be used to apply the abrasive composition to the substrate including dip coating,<br>
casting, or spraying.<br>
After the abrasive composition is applied, the urethane is cured to form a hard<br>
shell around the substrate, wherein a portion of the polishing grains are exposed. This<br>
shell is then ground to a size and shape suitable for polishing lenses and such sizes and<br>
shapes will be readily known to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the abrasive layer is<br>
shaped to create a spherical work-engaging surface with a thickness measured radially<br>
from the inner surface to the outer surface of about 0.1 mm to about 2.5 mm, preferably<br>
from 0.2 to 0.8 mm. However, the thickness of the abrasive layer can be more or less<br>
than this, depending on the particular polishing wheel and polishing application.<br>
Preferably, the thickness of the abrasive layer is uniform.<br>
The urethane of the abrasive layer has a Shore A hardness from about 66 to about<br>
96. In order to create a more resilient abrasive surface, the urethane of this layer is harder<br>
than the urethane of the substrate. A wide variety of commercially available urethanes are<br>
suitable for use with the present invention, provided that they have a Shore A hardness of<br>
from about 66 to about 96. One skilled in the art could readily select a polyurethanes<br>
meeting the above criteria.<br>
The polishing grains  used  in  the practice of this  invention  are available<br>
commercially in standard sizes. Preferably, grains are discretely sized from about 0.5 μm<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
to 20.0 μm, with from about 0.5μm to about 1.5 μm being more preferred. In certain<br>
preferred embodiments, the polishing grains are all of one approximate size. The grains<br>
are abrasive materials such as zirconium oxide, diamonds, cesium oxide, cerium oxide,<br>
silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, boron carbide, cubic boric nitrite, emery, garnet, and the<br>
like, but are preferably zirconium oxide or cerium oxide. The grains can be randomly<br>
distributed in the abrasive layer or can form a matrix. In either a random distribution or a<br>
matrix, the grains are preferably evenly distributed throughout the abrasive layer. The<br>
amount of grains used will depend upon the material from which the surface to be<br>
polished is composed.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a novel method for making a<br>
polishing wheel is provided. This method has the steps of (a) providing a polyurethane<br>
substrate having a spherical outer surface and being affixed to a hub; (b) providing an<br>
abrasive composition comprising a liquid urethane binder and a plurality of polishing<br>
grains; (c) coating the outer surface of the substrate with the abrasive composition to<br>
form a continuous spherical abrasive layer on the outer surface of the substrate; and (d)<br>
curing the urethane binder to form a hard outer surface.<br>
The coating is applied to the outer surface of the substrate by any of a number of<br>
coating processes known in the art, including, but not limited to, dip coating, spraying,<br>
and casting.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, an improved method of<br>
polishing an optical lens is provided. This method includes the steps of (a) providing an<br>
optical lens blank having a first side with the first side having surface roughness; (b)<br>
providing a spherical polishing wheel having a continuous urethane abrasive layer; (c)<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
providing a rotating element wherein the element is either the wheel of step (b) or the<br>
lens blank of step (a), or both; and (d) contacting the first side of the lens with the<br>
polishing wheel to reduce the surface roughness. The lens to be polished is preferably<br>
glass or plastic.<br>
The first side of the lens typically has an area having an approximate parabolic or<br>
spherical curvature that was generated by a grinding process. According to certain<br>
preferred embodiments, the method of polishing a lens further comprises the step of<br>
contacting this area with the polishing wheel to remove a portion of the lens so as to<br>
produce a truer parabolic or spherical curvature. This step is typically performed in<br>
unison with step (d).<br>
In certain embodiments, the lens to be polished has two or more different<br>
curvatures, such as a bifocal lens , wherein a portion of the lens has a first curvature for<br>
correcting hyperopia (farsightedness), while a separate portion of the lens has a different<br>
curvature for viewing object at close range. Other examples of lenses with two or more<br>
different curvatures include those for correcting astigmatism. Thus, according to certain<br>
embodiments of this aspect of the present invention, the first side of the lens comprises a<br>
first curvature having a first diopter D1 and a second curvature having a second diopter<br>
D2, wherein D1 #D2.<br>
The lens polishing method of the present invention can be adapted to processes<br>
wherein the lens rotates with respect to a stationary polishing wheel, or the polishing<br>
wheel rotates with respect to a stationary lens, or the polishing wheel and lens rotate with<br>
respect to each other, but in opposite directions.<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
Advanced polishing machines equipped with a polishing wheel according to the<br>
present invention are particularly well suited for polishing lenses having complex angles<br>
and for polishing two sides of a lens with a single machine. For example, in a preferred<br>
method of polishing a lens, the polishing wheel is mounted to a rotating shaft or spindle<br>
of an advanced polishing machine which can control, preferably by computer numerical<br>
control (CNC), the rotational speed of the wheel and the wheel's movement along a first<br>
horizontal axis (the "X-axis") having a left/right orientation and a second horizontal axis<br>
(the "Y-axis") having a front/rear orientation, each axis orientation being relative to the<br>
shaft or spindle.   In addition, the movement of the spindle upon which the wheel is<br>
controlled vertically along a "Z-axis" and rotationally about a "C-axis" the orientation of<br>
each axis also being relative to the shaft or spindle. These advanced polishing machines<br>
typically utilizing a positional feed-back system to control the movement of the wheel.<br>
Such advanced polishing machine control schemes are readily known by those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
The present invention is described in more detail by the following examples<br>
which are not intended to limit the scope of this invention in any way.<br>
Comparative Example 1:<br>
The process for measuring the material removal rate of the polishing process<br>
requires generating a cut surface with a large chamfer on the outside edge. This chamfer<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/066976	PCT/EP2005/014214<br>
will not be touched during the polishing process and it provides a fixed reference for<br>
measurement.<br>
The lens is blocked and the surface is cut. The surface of the blocked lens is then<br>
measured on a profilometer. A profilometer is typically used to measure surface<br>
roughness but in this case it can be used to measure the difference between the cut<br>
surface before and after polishing. The lens surface is then polished with a conventional<br>
polishing wheel for 400 seconds and measured on the profilometer again. The polished<br>
area has had some material removed from it and is lower relative to the chamfered area<br>
which is not touched during the polishing process. The measurement traces taken before<br>
and after polishing are aligned and the differences between them are the resultant rate of<br>
material removal with the chamfered area used as a common reference point.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, approximately 45 microns of material is removed from the<br>
lens surface during the polishing operation.<br>
Example 2:<br>
