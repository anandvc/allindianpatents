				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of novel epoxy resin thermoset material. The present invention particularly relates to epoxy resin thermoset material and methods for preparing them. Accordingly, the curing agent in this invention is polyaniline sulfate and the thermoset matrix may be epoxy resin. The present invention, more particularly relates to a process for preparing epoxy resin - polyaniline sulfate composite using emulsion polymerization process, wherein the epoxy resin - polyaniline sulfate composite is in organic carrier solvent and or as a single component material. The preparation of epoxy resin thermoset material was carried out by evaporating the organic solvent and heating the epoxy resin - polyaniline sulfate composite at high temperature.<br>
Epoxy resins were first introduced commercially in the United States around 1950 and since then their use has grown rapidly. They are the major industrial plastic capable of undergoing a large variety of addition and polymerization reactions leading to numerous thermoplastic and thermosetting forms.<br>
Epoxy resins may be broadly defined as resinous intermediate materials which are characterized by the presence of the epoxy group. Epoxy resin may also be defined as any molecule containing one or more alpha epoxy groups. When treated with the curing agent the thermosetting resins become hard, infusible system having different chemical and physical properties.<br>
Epoxy resins have varied industrial applications. They are used in protective coatings, adhesives for most substrates, body solders and caulking compounds, flooring, tooling compounds for moulds, stamping dies and patterns, forms, potting and encapsulation compound, low pressure molding resins and glass reinforced plastics.<br>
In general, epoxy resins are not used by themselves but rather they require the addition of a curing agent or hardener to convert them into a thermoset material. Depending on the chemical structure of the curing agent and curing conditions, it is possible to obtain toughness, chemical resistance, mechanical properties ranging from extreme flexibility to high strength and hardness, high adhesive strength, good heat resistance and high electrical insulation. Uncured resins range from low viscosity liquids to tack free solids, that along with the curing agents afford the fabricator a wide range of processing conditions.<br>
A relatively large number of chemical reagents are available or known to have utility as the curing agents or hardeners which may be added to epoxy resins to convert them to thermoset materials. It is also known that in the curing process both the epoxy and the hydroxyl groups of the<br>
resin may be involved. With the available curing agents the curing may be accomplished at room<br>
temperature or upon heating. It may take place in general either by a coupling or addition process, or by catalytic polymerization. The known curing agents or hardeners for epoxy resins fall into three categories: (1) the acidic type, for example, acid anhydrides; (2) aldehyde condensation products, for example, phenol-, urea-, and melamine- formaldehyde resins; and (3) amine type, for example, aliphatic and aromatic amines, polyamides, tertiary amines, and amine adducts.<br>
In the present invention, polyaniline is used as the curing agent for curing the epoxy resin. Polyaniline falls under the category of electrically conducting polymers and this field has got Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000.<br>
Electrically conducting polymers are subjected to in-depth research worldwide. These polymers offer the possibility of replacing metallic conductors and semiconductive materials in a variety of applications including batteries, transducers, switches, photocells, circuit boards, heating elements, antistatic protection (BSD) and electromagnetic protection (EMI). Conducting polymers<br>
possess the following advantages over metals: light weight, advantageous mechanical properties, good corrosion resistance and lower cost of synthesis and fabrication.<br>
The benefits of intrinsically conducting plastics include easy modification of their conductivity as a function of doping conditions which is particularly accentuated in conjunction with low conductivities. Exemplifying kinds of intrinsically conducting polymers are polyacetylene, poly-p-phenylene, polypyrrole, polythiophene and polyaniline. The use of most intrinsically conducting plastics in the promising applications mentioned above is, however, limited by the inferior processability and stability properties of these polymers.<br>
A technically and commercially promising intrinsically conducting polymer is polyaniline and its derivatives. Polyaniline is recognized as being chemically stable and electrically conductive in the protonated form. Nevertheless, the use of polyaniline has been limited because it has been considered intractable or unprocessible.<br>
A process has been developed for preparation of processable polyaniline-sulfate salt by emulsion polymerization method (Indian Patent Application NO. 295/DEL/2000 dated 23rd March, 2000 - the cited reference describes the status of preparation of polyaniline salts by aqueous and emulsion polymerization process). In the present process, epoxy resin - polyaniline sulfate composite was prepared using emulsion polymerization process, wherein polyaniline sulfate is used mainly to cure the epoxy resin.<br>
The present method involves a process for preparing epoxy resin - polyaniline composite using emulsion polymerization process, wherein the epoxy resin - polyaniline sulfate composite is in organic carrier solvent. The present method also involves the preparation of epoxy resin thermoset material.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of novel epoxy thermoset material.<br>
The other object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of epoxy resin - polyaniline sulfate composite using emulsion polymerization process, wherein the epoxy resin - polyaniline-sulfate composite is in organic carrier solvent.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of epoxy rising - polyaniline sulfate composite as a single component material, wherein polyaniline sulfate is the curing agent.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of epoxy resin thermoset material using polyaniline as a curing agent.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provide a process for preparation of novel epoxy resin thermoset material which comprises; polymerizing aromatic amine in the mixture of aqueous and hydrocarbon solvents in the presence of anionic surfactant, initiator and epoxy resin 0.45 to 37.5 gram for 2.3 ml of aniline in the temperature range -5 to 40°C for 4 hrs, separating the epoxy resin - polyaniline sulfate composite by conventional method from the reaction mixture, evaporating the solvent and heating the composite at a temperature in the range of 180 to 315°C to get the epoxy thermoset material.<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of epoxy resin - polyaniline sulfate composite in non aqueous organic carrier solvent or a single component material.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a process for the preparation of epoxy resin thermoset material using polyaniline as curing agent.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the aromatic amine used may be aniline.<br><br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention, epoxy resin may be the epoxy resin component having at least one 1,2-epoxy group per molecule. Mixtures of epoxy compounds having one epoxy functionality and two or more epoxy groups are also suitable. The epoxy compounds having two or more epoxy groups per molecule means that the nominal functionality is two or more. Generally, epoxy resins contain a distribution of compounds with a varying number of 1,2-epoxy equivalency. The actual average functionality of these epoxy compounds is about 1.5 or more. The epoxy compounds can be of the glycidyl ether type prepared by reacting epichlorohydrin with a compound containing at least one aromatic hydroxyl group carried out under alkaline reaction conditions. Examples of other epoxy resins suitable for use in the invention include diglycidyl ethers of dihydric compounds and epoxy novolacs.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention, the hydrocarbon solvent used may be<br>
chlorinated solvent selected from chloroform, dichloromethane, aromatic hydrocarbon selected from toluene.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the anionic surfactant used may be selected from sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium octyl sulfate, dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid sodium salt.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, the radical initiator used may be selected from ammonium persulfate, sodium persulfate.<br>
In one of the embodiment of the present invention, the reaction may be carried out in the temperature range 5 to 30CC.<br>
In one of the embodiment of the present invention, the amount of epoxy resin varied from 0.45 g to 37.5 g for 2.3 ml of aniline.<br><br>
