				<td>This invention relates to a pre-assembied front unit for motor vehicles<br>
This invention was developed specifically to satisfy the need of removing heat exchangers (condenser and radiator) from a motor vehicle upwards and separately and the need of adapting the front unit to different models of the same vehicle fitting different powertrain versions. Often, when the powertrain equipping the vehicle is changed, the distance between the heat exchangers of the front module and the chassis must be changed to account for the different clearance requirements and, consequently, the different layout of the components inside the engine compartment. This occurs specifically in the case of versions equipped with manual transmission, automatic transmission and diesel engine.<br>
Scope of this invention is to provide a pre-assembled front unit for motor vehicles of the type described above which can be adapted to vehicles fitting different powertrains without the need of using different supporting structures for the different models.<br>
According to this invention, this scope is attained by means of a pre-assembled front unit which characteristics arc described herein.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a pre-assembled front unit for motor vehicles comprising: a supporting structure destined to be fastened to the front part of a vehicle, a condenser and a radiator connected to the supporting structure and connection devices for fastening the condenser and the radiator to the supporting structure in such a way that the condenser and the radiator is removed separately one respect to the other by means of a movement from the bottom upwards, characterised in that the supporting structure supports a pair of interchangeable lower plates each of which is equipped with positioning and fastening devices engaging the corresponding devices on the condenser and on the radiator which is disengaged by means of a movement from the bottom upwards of the condenser and of the radiator.<br><br>
This invention will be better explained by the following detailed descriptions with reference to the accompanying figure as non-limiting example, whereas:<br>
Figure 1 is an exploded prospective view of a pre-assembled front unit according to<br>
this invention,<br>
Figures 2 and 3 are schematic cross-sections according to the lines IT-II and IlI-III in<br>
figure 1,<br>
Figure 4 is an enlarged scale prospective view of the part indicated by the arrow IV in<br>
figure 2,<br>
Figure 5 is an elevated view according to the arrow V in figure 4,<br>
Figure 6 is a partial view according to the line VI-VI in figure 5 and.<br>
Figure 7 is an exploded prospective view of the detail indicated by the arrow VII in<br>
figure 2.<br>
With reference to figure 1, number 10 indicates a pre-assembled unit for motor vehicles according to this invention. The front unit 10 comprises a supporting structure made of plastic material 12 which supports the various components of the pre-assembled unit and which is destined to be fitted on the front part of a motor vehicle. In figure 1, number 14 schematically indicates the upper front part of a chassis of a motor vehicle to which the supporting structure 12 is fastened in a conventional fashion.<br>
The pre-assembled unit 10 comprises a condenser 16 which is part of an air conditioning system in the motor vehicle and a radiator 18 which is part of the cooling system of the internal combustion engine fitted in the vehicle. Moreover, the pre-assembled unit 10 comprises a manifold (not shown) supporting an electrical fan unit facing the surface of the radiator 18 facing outwards with respect to the engine<br><br>
compartment. The condenser 16 is equipped with a pair of lower pins 20 and a pair of upper pins 22 on a vertical axis - Preferably, the pins 20, 22 are either fastened to, or form an integral part with, the ends of a pair of tubular distributors 24. The radiator 2 8 is also equipped with pair of lower pins 26 and a pair of upper pins 28 on a vertical axis. Preferably, the pins 26, 28 form an integral part with the respective plastic material reservoirs 3 0, Elastomer bushings 32, 34 are preferably inserted on the upper pins 22 and 28 of the condenser 16 and the radiator 18.<br>
With reference to the figures 1, 2 and 4-6, the supporting structure 12 comprises a lower supporting base 36 equipped with a pair of seats 38 in which the respective lower supporting plates 40 are fitted. Each supporting plate 4 0 is equipped with a pair of holes 42 (figure 6) in which an elastomer material block 44 with a hole 46 is inserted. The holes 46 of which plate 40 receive the lower pins 20, 26 of the condenser and the radiator with a slight interference.<br>
Each plate 40 is fastened in either a permanent or removable fashion to the supporting structure 12- In the example shown in the figures, each plate 40 has a groove 48 on the edge which is engaged by the edge of the seat 38. Fastening is achieved by means of a screw which extends through a hole crossing the supporting base 36 and engaging a projecting portion 50 formed on plate 40.<br>
The supporting structure 12 supports two pairs of clips 52, 54 which engage the upper pins 22 and 28 of the condenser 16 and the radiator 18, respectively. As can be seen in particular in figure 7, each clip 52, 54 comprises a base 56 from which two deformable portions 58 project, said portions facing each other and defining a partially open seat 60 in which a respective<br><br>
pin 22, 28 is clipped by interposing the respective elastomer material bushing 32, 34. The base 56 of each clip 52, 54 is equipped with devices for fastening to the supporting structure 12. In the example shown in the figures, said fastening device have a bayonet coupling comprising an engaging portion 62 and a seat 64 formed in the supporting structure 12. The bayonet coupling 62, 64 is configured so to fasten the clip 52 to the supporting structure 12 solely by means of a rotation of 90 degrees after inserting the projecting portion 62 into the corresponding seat 64.<br>
The condenser 16 and the radiator 18 are fastened to the supporting structure 12 by inserting the lower pins 20 into the holes 46 with a movement from the top downwards and then engaging the respective clips 52, 54 by means of a rocking movement. The condenser 16 and the radiator 18 can be removed separately one from the other from the supporting structure 12 by releasing the upper pins 22, 28 from the clips 52, 54 and then removing them with a movement from the bottom upwards.<br>
The pre-assembled front unit according to this invention can be fitted on motor vehicles fitting different powertrains which require a different relative distance between the heat exchangers 16, 18 and the supporting structure 12 according to the different clearance requirements of the powertrain. In order to satisfy this requirement, the structure according to this invention will remain unchanged for the various models with the sole replacement of the plates 4 and the clips 52, 54. This is because the position of the condenser 16 and the radiator 18 can be varied with respect to the supporting structure 12 while maintaining unchanged the shape and dimensions of the supporting structure by changing the position of the  holes  46  and  the  seats  60.  This  entails  a<br><br>
considerable cutting of costs for tooling since different dies for making different supporting structures for vehicle fitting different powertrains are no longer required.<br><br><br>
