				<td>UNDERWATER INSTALLATION<br>
The invention relates to an underwater installation for use in offshore recovery of oil and gas, particularly at large depths of the ocean.<br>
Oil drilling from floating vessels is a well established technique which can be carried out even at large depths of the ocean. Conventionally, production of oil and gas has taken place by means of fixed installation resting on the seabed. It is difficult to build fixed installations at large depths. Therefore, technique has been developed wherein wellhead and valves belonging thereto are placed on the seabed, and where risers carry hydrocarbons to a vessel at the surface.<br>
Seadbed based equipment is to a high degree remote controlled and adapted to the use of a remote control vehicle (a RCV or a ROV) for maintenance, etc. This prior art technique can be used at moderate depths. Using_known technique, large depths are difficult to access, and a finished installation will be very expensive.<br>
From Norwegian patent application No. 924962, it is previously known to dispose wellheads on a submerged buoyancy body, from where conductor pipes extend downwardly to wells on the seabed. From the wellhead, hydrocarbons<br>
are conducted upwardly to a vessel as previously known. Thus, the buoyancy body serves as an artificial seabed, wherein well completion and production are carried out using prior art technique. If the artificial seabed has a sufficient buoyancy, it may in itelf carry a common fixed oil installation.<br>
According to this technique, production wells are drilled in two phases. By means of a floating vessel, a well is drilled to a part of the planned length, e.g. until a 13 3/B inches casing is set, whereafter the well is plugged and left. Thereafter, neighbour wells are drilled in the same manner. The last set casings are, at the upper ends thereof, provided with fasteners in order to be extendable upwardly, e.g. in the form of internal or external threads, to be screwed together with another pipe.<br>
A submerged buoyancy body is anchored above the well area and conductor pipes extend from the buoyancy body and downwardly to the wells, where the conductor pipes are attached to the last set casings. The buoyancy body is positioned at a depth so deep that the wave influence becomes insignificant, the body being attached to the seabed by means of tension struts, such as known from floating tension leg platforms.<br>
On the top of the conductor pipe, within the buoyancy body, a blowout valve is mounted as previously known, risers extending upwardly to a drilling vessel. Drilling of the wells may, thus, continue by means of prior art technique, but now from a substantially less depth than the first phase of the drilling, e.g. one hundred and fifty metres. Second drilling phase which is introduced by drilling out the plug set in the first phase may, thus, be carried out by means of simpler equipment than during the first phase.<br>
Finished drilled wells are completed and put in production as previously known.<br>
Use of a submerged buoyancy body forming an artificial seabed makes it possible to recover oil and gas from substantial depths of the ocean. However, the state of the art, such as represented by said NO 924962, falls unnecessarily expensive, substantially due to a very expensive anchoring.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a reasonable anchoring of submerged buoyancy bodies of the kind serving as bases for wellheads to wells at larger depths of the ocean.<br>
The object is achieved through features as defined in the following claims.<br>
The characteristic features of the invention consist in that the buoyance body is anchored to the seabed by means of conductor pipes extending between one of the casings of the well and the buoyancy body.<br>
The present invention relates to an underwater installation for use in offshore drilling of and production from, respectively, oil and/or gas wells in deep and moderate deep water, comprising an intermediate station in the form of a buoyancy based hollow body tension strut/leg anchored at the seabed and situated at a depth substantially closer to the surface of the sea than the seabed, at least one hydrocabon conveying pipeline extending between the hollow buoyancy body and seabed depth for the transfer of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the hollow buoyancy body, characterized in that the tension strut/leg of the hollow buoyancy body constitutes an extension of a casing pipe from one<br>
.<br>
or more wells.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for the building of an underwater installation comprising a submerged  buoyancy based, tension strut/leg anchored intermediate station in the form of a hollow buoyancy body which is assigned a hydrocarbon  conveying, downwardly extending pipeline for the transfer of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the hollow buoyancy body, which is equipped with a production hose or a similar hydrocarbon conveying hose/pipeline extending upwardly in a position of use, and wherein, in a first phase, from a seabed frame, a template or similar frame, one or more wells are predrilled and thereafter, temporarily, plugged, and  wherein said hollow buoyancy body is submerged and positioned, possibly equipped with further, readily temporary buoyancy units or is ballasted, respectively, the submersion and positioning in relation to the well or a seabed frame comprising several wells, respectively, being effected by means of guys attached to the seabed frame or another anchor on the seabed, characterized in that the last set casing i at  least one of the wells are extended up to the hollow buoyancy body  where the casing is connected and allocated a wellhead including blowout valves, whereafter the well is further drilled and additional casings set through the wellhead.<br>
An example of a diagrammatically shown embodiment of the invention is shown in a perspective view when an underwater installation occupies a production phase.<br>
On the seabed 10, a subsea frame 12 has been installed in an introduction phase, forming an anchor for lines 14 for submerging and lateral positioning of a buoyancy based hollow body 16.<br>
The underwater installation according to the invention is suitable for use at large depths of the ocean, e.g. 400 -4000 metres, and the submerged buoyancy body 16 may e.g. be placed at a depth of e.g. 150 metres, where the influence from the waves is very small, causing a moderate variation in the load on tension struts for the anhoring of the buoyancy body 16 on the seabed.<br>
After e.g. eight wells are predrilled to 13 3/8 inches, casing liner strings 18a, 18b, 18c, 18d, 18e, 18f, 18g, 18h<br>
are lowered from a floating platform (not shown) to be screwed to the upper threaded end of last set casings, during which the liner strings 18a - 18h pass through vertically aligned passages, not shown, in the buoyancy body 16. In the production phase, the buoyancy body 16 is closed uppermost, except for a central opening for a production hose 20. After having been screwed to said upper end of last set casings, these casing liner strings 18a - 18h, the number of which corresponds to the number of wells, are attached to the buoyancy body 16 with the upper end thereof. During this attachment, the temporary anchor lines 14 may be tightened for, thereafter, to be slackened, transferring the tension strain to "the tension struts" 18a - 18h according to the invention which, thus, are tensioned and tightened.<br>
The temporary anchor lines 14 may be removed when the underwater installation is ready for production.<br>
As mentioned, one or more casing-liner strings 18a - 18h have a double function, namely as a casing and a tension strut. In the embodiment shown, the wells upon completion are considered as being continuous from the reservoir up to the buoyancy based, tension leg/strut anchored, submerged hollow body which is positioned at a depth of another order than the seabed. The invention represents large simplifications in relation to known and conventional technique, and enables the utilization of already established technology such as operations associated to drilling at very large depths of the ocean as well as socalled floating production.<br><br><br><br>
