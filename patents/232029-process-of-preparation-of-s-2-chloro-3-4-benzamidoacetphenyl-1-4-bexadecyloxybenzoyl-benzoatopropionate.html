(S)-2-chloro-3-(4-benzamidoacetophnyl-l-(4'-chlorobenzoic acid)-benzoatopropionate was purified by column chromatography through a silica gel column using a mixture of petroleum ether: acetone ( 5: 1 v/v) as eluent. The product was recrystallized from hot dichloromethane solution to get an yield of 1.13 gram (52.64%).<br>

(S)-chloro-3-(4-benzamidoacetophenyl)l-(4'-hexadecyloxybenzoyl)-benzoatopropionate was prepared by mixing together absolute dichloromethane solutions of (S)-2-chloro-3-(4-benzamidoacetophenyl)-l-(4'-chlotobenzoic acid)-benzoatopropionate (2.3 gram/3.8 mmol in 20 ml of dry dichloromethane) prepared as described in step 8 and 1-hexadecanol (1.01 gram/1.2 mmol in 15 ml of dry dichloromethane) under nitrogen atmosphere and the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4h 0.4 ml (3.3 mmol) of triethylamine was added then added to the reaction mixture drop wise and the reaction mixture was refluxed at 60 °C with constant stirring for 6 h. The read coloured solution contained (S)-2-chloro-3-(4-benzamidoacetophenyl)-l-(4'-hexadecyloxybenzoyl)-benzoatopropionate was isolated as red gelly product after removing the excess solvent by vacuum distillation, washed repeatedly with cold benzene solution and dried over vacuuo for 12 h. the crude product was then chromatographed through a silica get column using a mixture of petroleum ther " acetone (5 : 1 v/v) as eluent. The yield obtained was 1.52 gram (49.60 %).<br><br>
The room temperature ferroelectric liquid crystal compound prepared by the process of this invention exhibit characteristic ferroelectric properties in and around room temperatures which is a rare phenomena, as the most of the reported ferroelectric compounds used for the appl icational purrposes are the mixtures of more than one component .<br>
The room temperature ferroelectric liquid crystal compound of the invention is therefore useful for both fundamental as well as applied research aspects including for the no n- linear optical applications. Further, such room temperature ferroelectric liquid crystal compound can be used as host materials for the preparation of other FLC mi xtures.<br>
The need for this type of room temperature ferroelectric materials as strongly felf because the preparation and characterisation of FLC mixtures is time consuming as well as expensive. These<br><br>
compounds   prepared   as   per  the  process  of   this invention  can be  directly used i  the   applicational aspects   such as  polarisation  controllers,  switching attenuators, display devices etc.<br>
The study of the fundamental ferroelectric properties viz., spontaneous polarisation, tilt angle, time response etc., of the present invented compound reveals that he magnitudes of these parameters are found to be of in good agreement with those of commercially available multi-component materials. In fact some of the above properties envisage that this compound showed better physical characteristics tha n the commer c i a 11y available c om pounds.<br><br>
