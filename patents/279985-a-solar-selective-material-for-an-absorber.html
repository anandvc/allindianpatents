A SOLAR ABSORPTIVE MATERIAL FOR A SOLAR SELECTIVE SURFACE<br>
COATING<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention broadly relates to a solar<br>
absorptive material for a solar selective surface coating.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In order to increase the efficiency of solar<br>
absorbers, solar selective coatings are applied to the<br>
solar absorbers. Such coatings increase absorbance of<br>
solar radiation in a spectral range in which the solar<br>
radiation has high intensity and reduce loss of energy in<br>
the infrared spectral range.<br>
Solar selective coatings for solar absorbers<br>
typically comprise a metallic layer on an absorber body, a<br>
solar absorptive coating and a top layer. Alternatively,<br>
the solar absorptive coating may be positioned directly on<br>
a metallic absorber body. The absorptive layer typically<br>
comprises a metallic component and a non-metallic<br>
component, such as a dielectric component. Typically the<br>
metallic material forms islands in the dielectric material<br>
so that a Cermet material is formed. The top layer has a<br>
metal concentration that is lower than that of the solar<br>
absorptive layer or is free of metal. Such a solar<br>
selective coating absorbs solar radiation while the<br>
emission of infrared radiation is reduced compared with,<br>
for example, a uniform metallic coating.<br>
Solar absorptive coatings typically have a non-<br>
uniform metal volume fraction. Figure 1 show plots of<br>
metal volume fraction versus depth from an outer boundary<br>
for an exemplary selection of such solar absorptive<br>
coatings. The figure shows a plot 10 for a coating having<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092028	PCT/AU2006/000288<br>
- 2 -<br>
a graded metal volume fraction, a multilayer structure 12,<br>
and a combination of graded and multilayer profiles 14.<br>
For example, a solar energy reflector array may be<br>
used to collect sunlight which is then focused onto the<br>
absorber coated with the solar selective surface coating.<br>
The collected sunlight heats the absorber and the solar<br>
selective coating locally to relative high temperatures<br>
such as 350Â°C. In order to increase the lifetime of the<br>
solar selective surface coating at such high temperatures,<br>
and to reduce thermal losses of the absorber, the absorber<br>
may be positioned in an evacuated housing.<br>
It is known that the conversion efficiency of the<br>
energy from the collected sunlight is better at even<br>
higher temperatures, but further increase of the<br>
temperature may have a substantial negative impact on the<br>
lifetime of the solar selective coatings.<br>
The positioning of the absorber with solar selective<br>
surface coating in air, which would be advantageous for<br>
some applications, can cause even more problems.<br>
There is a need for technological advancement.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides in a first aspect a<br>
solar absorptive material for a solar selective surface of<br>
an absorber of solar radiation, the solar absorptive<br>
material comprising:<br>
a dispersed metallic material,<br>
a receiving boundary through which the solar<br>
radiation is received,<br>
a first region and a second region, the first region<br>
being located at a position closer to the receiving<br>
boundary than the second region, and the first region<br>
having an average volume fraction of the dispersed<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092028	PCT/AU2006/000288<br>
- 3 -<br>
metallic material that is larger than that of the second<br>
region.<br>
Such a solar absorptive material typically forms a<br>
 part of a solar selective surface coating of an absorber<br>
body and typically is sandwiched between a surface layer<br>
having a lower average metal volume fraction and a<br>
reflective bottom layer (or the absorber body itself)<br>
having a higher average metal volume fraction or being<br>
metallic.<br>
Because the solar absorptive material has a larger<br>
average metal volume concentration in the first region<br>
which is closer to the receiving boundary than the second<br>
region, the solar absorptive material typically has an<br>
increased lifetime at elevated temperatures compared with<br>
conventional solar absorptive materials. Experiments have<br>
shown that embodiments of the solar absorptive material<br>
have reduced molecular diffusion which increases the<br>
lifetime. Further, conventional solar absorptive materials<br>
have a higher concentration of the metallic material at or<br>
near the interface between the solar absorptive material<br>
and the bottom layer or the absorber body. The solar<br>
absorptive material of the present invention may have a<br>
reduced concentration of metallic material near the<br>
interface which typically improves the adhesion of the<br>
solar absorptive material at elevated temperatures.<br>
For example, the solar absorptive material may<br>
comprise a third region positioned at a distance below the<br>
receiving boundary that is further than that of the second<br>
region and having an average metal volume fraction that is<br>
larger than that of the second region.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the solar absorptive<br>
material may comprise a fourth region positioned between<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092028	PCT/AU2006/000288<br>
- 4 - <br>
the first region and the receiving boundary, the first<br>
region having an average metal volume fraction larger than<br>
that of the fourth region.<br>
At least one region of the solar absorptive material<br>
may comprise a dispersion of at least two material<br>
components and at least one of the material components<br>
comprises itself a composition of more than one material.<br>
At least one of the material components typically<br>
comprises the metallic material and at least one other<br>
material. Alternatively, each of the material components<br>
may comprise the metallic material. In another variation<br>
at least one of the material components may comprise a<br>
dielectric material.<br>
Further in at least one of the regions the metallic<br>
material component may be dispersed in a dielectric<br>
material or in another metallic material.<br>
In one specific embodiment the average metal volume<br>
fraction of at least one of the regions is selected so<br>
that diffusion of metallic material from the or each<br>
adjacent region is substantially inhibited for a<br>
temperature range of 300Â°C to 500Â°C.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the solar<br>
absorptive material comprises a higher concentration of<br>
the dispersed metallic material at or near the receiving<br>
boundary than at or near an interface between the solar<br>
absorptive material and the bottom layer or the absorber<br>
body.<br>
At least one of the regions may be a layer. In one<br>
embodiment, the absorptive material comprises a multi-<br>
layered structure. Alternatively or additionally, the<br>
metallic volume fraction of at least one of the regions<br>
may decreases in a direction from the receiving boundary<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092028	PCT/AU2006/000288<br>
- 5 -<br>
into the material in a gradual manner or may be<br>
substantially uniform.<br>
In one particularly advantageous embodiment of the<br>
present invention the absorptive material comprises a<br>
multilayered structure having a large number of very thin<br>
layers. Each layer may have a thickness of typically more<br>
than 20 to 200 Angstrom. This embodiment has the advantage<br>
that the layer thicknesses are small compared to the<br>
wavelength of the solar light. Consequently possible<br>
interference effects due to reflections at layer<br>
interfaces are not problematic.<br>
The dispersed metallic material may comprise any<br>
suitable material, such as any suitable metallic material<br>
including metal alloys, metal nitrides and transition<br>
metals, but typically comprises a silicide material such<br>
as a salicide material. Because of the temperature<br>
stability of the silicide material, the high temperature<br>
suitability of the solar selective material is further<br>
improved. The first component typically has a resistivity<br>
of less than 50 â¦cm, typically less than 10 â¦cm.<br>
The silicide material may comprise any suitable<br>
metallic material including for example a titanium<br>
silicide, a tungsten silicide, a cobalt silicide.<br>
A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the<br>
solar absorptive material according to embodiments of the<br>
present invention has a range of advantages. The concept<br>
of having at least one region which has an average metal<br>
volume fraction that is larger than that of another region<br>
and that is positioned closer to the receiving boundary<br>
than the other region offers significant flexibility for<br>
design optimisation and facilitates fabrication. For<br>
example, the solar absorptive material may comprise multi-<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092028	PCT/AU2006/000288<br>
- 6-<br>
layered or multi-region structures having layers or<br>
regions with different average metal volume fractions and<br>
may be designed having optimised optical properties (i.e.<br>
optical material constants). In addition, relatively thick<br>
structures may be fabricated and typically controlling of<br>
particular parameters is less critical as the metal volume<br>
fraction may increase and also decrease during fabrication<br>
of the structures.<br>
Further, adhesion of a layer or region may be<br>
optimised by selecting an average a metal volume fraction<br>
for the layer or region of the solar absorptive material<br>
in accordance with the first aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In addition, positioning of a layer or region having<br>
a lower average metal volume fraction than immediately<br>
adjacent layers or regions typically reduces inter-<br>
diffusion of metallic material at elevated temperatures<br>
and consequently increases the lifetime of the solar<br>
selective material. Further, relatively thick structures<br>
may be fabricated.<br>
The present invention provides in a second aspect a<br>
solar absorptive material for a solar selective surface of<br>
an absorber of solar radiation, the solar absorptive<br>
material comprising a silicide material for absorptive<br>
solar radiation.<br>
The silicide material typically is a salicide<br>
material.<br>
The present invention provides in a third aspect an<br>
absorber having a solar selective surface coating<br>

first aspect of the present invention, wherein the<br>
absorptive material is sandwiched between an outer layer<br>
and a metallic region.<br>
The absorptive material typically is sandwiched<br>
between an outer layer and a bottom layer positioned over<br>
an absorber body. Alternatively, the absorptive material<br>
may be positioned directly on the absorber body. The outer<br>
layer typically has a lower metallic volume fraction that<br>
the solar absorptive layer (or is non-metallic) . The<br>
bottom typically has a higher average metal volume<br>
fraction than the absorptive material or is metallic. The<br>
absorber body typically is also metallic.<br>
The present invention provides in a fourth aspect a<br>
solar absorptive material for a solar selective surface of<br>
an absorber of solar radiation, the solar absorptive<br>
material comprising:<br>
at least three layers having a dispersed metallic<br>
material, an intermediate one of the at least three layers<br>
having an average volume fraction of the dispersed<br>
metallic material that is lower than that of the adjacent<br>
layers,<br>
wherein the average metal volume fraction of the<br>

metallic material from the adjacent layers is<br>
substantially inhibited for a temperature range of 300Â°C<br>
to 500Â°C.<br>

Detailed Description of Specific Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figs. 2-4, solar absorptive materials<br>
according to specific embodiments of the present invention<br>
are now described. Figs 2-4 show depth profiles of<br>
relative material concentration which typically is closely<br>
related to the electrical conductivity. Consequently, the<br>
relative material concentrations could also be represented<br>
by depth profiles showing the specific electrical<br>
conductivity as a function of depth.<br>

this embodiment the solar absorptive material comprises a<br>
dispersion of two components. A first component is<br>
metallic and typically has a relatively high specific<br>
absorption coefficient for visible solar radiation where<br>
the solar radiation is of relatively high intensity. A<br>
second component is in this example dielectric and at<br>
least in part transmissive for visible solar radiation but<br>
reflective for infrared radiation emitted by the absorber.<br>
The absorptive material has an outer boundary for<br>
receiving the solar radiation and typically is applied to,<br>
or forms the part of, a solar selective surface coating on<br>
an absorber body. For example, the solar absorptive<br>
material may be positioned directly on a metallic absorber<br>
body, or may be positioned on a metallic bottom layer over<br>
the absorber body and may be covered by a top layer having<br>
a low average metal volume fraction (or being<br>
substantially free of metals) .<br>
The effects of the distribution of the first and<br>
second components is shown in plot 20, which identifies<br>
regions of the absorptive material having a different<br>
relative material component distribution. The plot 2 0<br>
shows a depth profile through the solar absorptive<br>
material comprising regions 22, 24, 26, 28 and 29. The<br>
plot schematically shows the metal volume fraction through<br>
the entire thickness of the material.<br>
Region 22 has a relatively small average metal<br>
volume fraction and is positioned just below the surface.<br>
Below region 22 is region 24 which has a slightly higher<br>
average metal volume fraction, region 26 has a lower<br>
average metal volume fraction and regions 28 and 2 9 have<br>
higher average metal volume fractions.<br>

second specific embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
this embodiment the solar absorptive material comprises<br>
regions 32, 34, 36, 38 and 39. Regions 34, 36 and 38 have<br>
a graded metal volume fraction. Region 32, positioned<br>
just below the outer boundary surface (or top surface if<br>
the absorptive material is not coated) , has a relatively-<br>
small average metal volume fraction. Region 3 6 has a<br>
graded metal volume fraction that decreases in a direction<br>
from the surface through the region. Region 38 has a<br>
metal volume fraction that increases in a direction from<br>
the surface through the region. Region 3 9 has a uniform<br>
metal volume fraction.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a plot 40 illustrating a depth profile<br>
through a solar absorptive material according to a third<br>
specific embodiment of the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment the depth profile includes regions with<br>
substantially constant metal volume fraction regions and<br>
also regions with a graded metal volume fraction. The<br>
material comprises regions 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48<br>
and 49. The region 41 is positioned just below the<br>
surface and has a relatively small, uniform metal volume<br>
fraction. The region 42 has a metal volume fraction that<br>
increases in a graded manner from the interface to<br>
region 41 to the interface of the region 43. The<br>
region 45, between two adjacent higher metal volume<br>
fraction regions, can be thought of an insulating region<br>
because it can reduce inter-diffusion of metal atoms. The<br>
regions 44, 45 and 46 have a uniform metal volume fraction<br>
which differ from one another and the region 47 has a<br>
metal volume fraction that gradually increases from the<br>
interface to the region 46 to the interface to the region<br>
48. Region 48 has a uniform metal volume fraction.<br>
A person skilled in the art will appreciate that in<br>

each embodiment the average metal volume fraction of the<br>
material typically is closely related to the optical<br>
properties of the material in the visible solar energy<br>
range. If the average metal volume fraction in a first<br>
region of the material is larger than in a second region,<br>
the absorbance of the first region typically is also<br>
larger than that of the second region. For example,<br>
regions 29, 39 and 49 have a relatively high absorbance.<br>
In each embodiment the materials comprise first<br>
regions which are positioned closer to the top surface<br>
than subsequent regions which have a average metal volume<br>
fraction which is larger than that of at least one of the<br>
subsequent regions. For example, the region 24 has a<br>
average metal volume fraction that is larger than that of<br>
the region 26, the region 36 has a average metal volume<br>
fraction that is larger than that of the region 38, the<br>
regions 43 and 44 have a average metal volume fraction<br>
that is larger than that of region 45 and region 46 has a<br>
average metal volume fraction that is larger than that of<br>
the region 48.<br>
If the metal volume fraction is decreasing in a<br>
direction away from the surface into the material, as in<br>
the above described examples, the integrity of the solar<br>
absorptive material at elevated temperatures is improved.<br>
In each embodiment the regions may have any<br>
thickness, but typically the regions, which may be layers,<br>
have thicknesses of more than 20 Angstrom.<br>
In each embodiment the material that comprises the<br>
regions has different or varying metal volume fractions<br>
dependent on the relative concentrations and combination<br>
of the first and second components. Regions with<br>
predetermined absorption properties can be fabricated by<br>
mixing the two components and then applying the mixed<br>

material to an absorber to form a layer of a multi-layered<br>
structure. Alternatively, the regions or layers may, for<br>
example, be prepared by physical or chemical vapour<br>
deposition methods such as ac or dc sputtering. Two<br>
sputter sources may be used, one for first component (for<br>
example a metallic component) and the other for the second<br>
component (for example a dielectric component). The<br>
relative deposition rate of the two components determines<br>
the relative metal volume fraction and therefore other<br>
characteristics such as the conductivity of the deposited<br>
layer.<br>
Alternatively, each layer may be formed by<br>
depositing very thin layers of the first or second<br>
component, for example dielectric and metal sub-layers<br>
each having a thickness of only a few Angstrom or less.<br>
As the sub-layers are extremely thin, they together have<br>
physical properties which correspond to an average of the<br>
metal volume fraction throughout the layer composed by the<br>
sub-layers.<br>
Furthermore, the optimisation of the absorptive<br>
material is not limited to combining only two components.<br>
The metallic component may comprise any metal,<br>
metallic alloy, metallic nitrite, nitrites of transition<br>
metals, or any other materials. In this embodiment,<br>
however, the solar absorptive material comprises a<br>
silicide material such as a salicide material.<br>
Particularly suitable is a titanium silicide material, a<br>
tungsten silicide material, or cobalt silicide material,<br>
but a salicide material that comprises any other suitable<br>
metal may also be used.<br>
Figure 5 schematically shows a solar absorber 50<br>

absorptive material.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the use of layers or graded sections of the absorbing<br>
material, where the metal volume fraction decreases in a<br>
direction from the top surface (receiving boundary) into<br>
the material, allows the absorptive material to be<br>
optimised for improved efficiency and other<br>
characteristics such as stability in air, adhesion of the<br>
layers, less oxidation, stress relaxation or reduction,<br>
improved resistance of diffusion (particularly heavy<br>
atoms) or permeability. For example a layer or layers<br>
having an increased average metal volume fraction compared<br>
with adjacent layers may be positioned at predetermined<br>
depth from the surface in a manner such that the<br>
efficiency of the solar selective material is improved.<br>
In a further embodiment, the use of one or more<br>
regions where the metal volume fraction decreases in a<br>
direction from the top surface, allows for a larger number<br>
of regions with more variance of properties, such as metal<br>
volume fraction or optical constants, between the regions.<br>
This flexibility leads to improved optimisation of the<br>
material. For example the material can be optimised for<br>
interference effects over a wider wavelength range. From<br>
a manufacturing point of view there is more flexibility.<br>
For example, when using sputtering techniques the present<br>
invention allows for the sputtering to be less sensitive<br>
to deposition parameters compared to conventional<br>
techniques.<br>
In a further embodiment, the larger number of<br>
regions due to the partial reversing of the depth profile<br>
leads to an absorber with more depth of absorbing material<br>
compared to one comprising only two regions or layers.<br>
In a further embodiment, the top region, which may<br>

be a dielectric, extends further into the material.<br>
Although the invention has been described with<br>
reference to particular examples; it will be appreciated<br>
by those skilled in the art that the invention may be<br>
embodied in many other forms. For example, even though the<br>
embodiments illustrated in Figs. 2-4 show multi-layered<br>
structures, it will be appreciated that the absorptive<br>
material according to the present invention may also<br>
comprise only a single layer having a graded metal volume<br>
fraction that decreases from the surface through the<br>
thickness of the material.<br>
Further, it will be appreciated by a person skilled<br>
in the art that the solar absorptive material may comprise<br>
more than one type of the first component (for example<br>
more than one type of a metallic material) and/or more<br>
than one type of the second component (for example more<br>
than one type of a dielectric material). The metal volume<br>
fraction may be substantially uniform throughout a layer<br>
or region and a variation of the conductivity and the<br>
absorbance properties of that layer can be achieved by<br>
using different types of metallic components throughout<br>
the layer which have different electrical conducting and<br>
absorptive properties. Alternatively, the metal volume<br>
fraction may vary throughout a layer or region but the<br>
conductivity and the absorbance properties of that layer<br>
may be substantially uniform throughout the layer or<br>
region.<br>
