				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates to compounds, and<br>
compositions thereof, that are useful as caspase inhibitors.<br>
[00021 This invention also relates to processes for<br>
preparing these compounds.	<br>
[0003] This invention further relates to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising said compounds and to the use of the<br>
compounds and compositions thereof for the treatment of<br>
diseases and disorders related to caspase-mediated conditions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0004] Caspases are a family of cysteine protease enzymes<br>
that are key mediators in inflammation. Caspase-1 (ICE)<br>
processes pre-IIi-lp to produce the active form of IL-ip [WO<br>
99/47545]. ICE has also been linked to the conversion of pro-<br>
IGIF to IGIF and/or to the production of IFN-y [Id.]. Both IL-<br>
1P and IFN-y contribute to the pathology associated with<br>
inflammatory, infectious, and autoimmune diseases (see, e.g.,<br>
WO 99/47545; J. Invest. Dermatology, 120(1), pp. 164-167<br>
(2003); Br. J. Dermatology, 141, pp. 739-746 (1999); Science,<br><br>
282, pp. 490-493 (1998); Schweiz. Med. Wochenschr., 130, pp.<br>
1656-1661 (2000)].<br>
[0005] Caspases are also key mediators in the signaling<br>
pathways for apoptosis and cell disassembly [N.A. Thorriberry,<br>
Chem. Biol., 5, pp. R97-R103 (1998)]. These signaling<br>
pathways vary depending on cell type and stimulus, but all<br>
apoptosis pathways appear to converge at a common effector<br>
pathway leading to proteolysis of key proteins. Caspases are<br>
involved in both the effector phase of the signaling pathway<br>
and further upstream at its initiation. The upstream caspases<br>
involved in initiation events become activated and in turn<br>
activate other caspases that are involved in the later phases<br>
of apoptosis.<br>
[0006] The utility of caspase inhibitors to treat a variety<br>
of mammalian disease states associated with an increase in<br>
cellular apoptosis has been demonstrated using peptidic<br>
caspase inhibitors. For example, in rodent models, caspase<br>
inhibitors have been shown to reduce infarct size and inhibit<br>
cardiomyocyte apoptosis after myocardial infarction, to reduce<br>
lesion volume and neurological deficit resulting from stroke,<br>
to reduce post-traumatic apoptosis and neurological deficit in<br>
traumatic brain injury, to be effective in treating fulminant<br>
liver destruction, and to improve survival after endotoxic<br>
shock [H. Yaoita et al., Circulation, 97, pp. 276-281 (1998);<br>
M. Endres et al., J. Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism, 18,<br>
pp. 238-247, (1998); Y. Cheng et al., J. Clin. Invest., 101,<br>
pp. 1992-1999 (1998); A.G. Yakovlev et al., J. Neurosci., 17,<br>
pp. 7415-7424 (1997); I. Rodriguez et al., J. Exp. Med., 184,<br>
pp. 2067-2072 (1996); Grobmyer et al., Mol. Med., 5, p. 585<br>
(1999)] .<br>
[0007] However, due to their peptidic nature, such<br>
inhibitors are typically characterized by undesirable<br><br>
pharmacological properties, such as poor cellular penetration<br>
and cellular activity, poor oral absorption, poor stability<br>
and rapid metabolism [J.J. Plattner and D.W. Norbeck, in Drug<br>
Discovery Technologies, C.R. Clark and W.H. Moos, Eds. (Ellis<br>
Horwood, Chichester, England, 1990), pp. 92-126]. This has<br>
hampered their development into effective drugs. These and<br>
other studies with peptidic caspase inhibitors have<br>
demonstrated that an aspartic acid residue is involved in a<br>
key interaction with the caspase enzyme [K.P. Wilson et al.,<br>
Nature, 370, pp. 270-275 (1994); Lazebnik et al., Nature, 371,<br>
p. 346 (1994)].<br>
[0008] Accordingly, peptidyl and non-peptidyl aspartic acid<br>
compounds are useful as caspase inhibitors.<br>
[0009] A need nevertheless exists for compounds that have<br>
the ability to act as caspase inhibitors, particularly with<br>
selective activity against certain caspases.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0010] The present invention provides a compound of formula<br>
I: <br>
wherein the variables are as defined herein.<br>
[0011] The present invention also provides processes for<br>
preparing these compounds, compositions, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, and methods of using such compounds and<br>
compositions for inhibiting caspases. These compounds are<br>
particularly useful as selective caspase-l/capase-8<br>
inhibitors.<br><br>

whether those atoms also have atoms bound in a branched<br>
fashion. According to this definition, an ethyl group and a<br>
trifluoromethoxy group each have three straight-chained atoms,<br>
and a methyl group has two straight-chained atoms. In the<br>
above embodiment, R12 has no more than 5 straight-chained<br>
atoms. In two other embodiments, R12 has no more than 4<br>
straight-chained atoms and no more than 3 straight-chained<br>
atoms. In yet other embodiments, R12 has 2 straight-chained<br>
atoms or 1 atom.<br>
[0015] As used herein, a position adjacent to the bond x<br>
refers to a position which is located next to the position at<br>
which x is bound. In an aryl ring, this position is often<br>
called "the ortho position* or, in the case of a phenyl ring,<br>
it may be called "the 2-positiori". By way of example, in the<br>
structures immediately below, R12 is bound to the phenyl,<br>
thiophcne, and pyridine rings at *the position adjacent to<br>
bond x". <br><br><br>

wherein:<br>
a)	R3 is phenyl, thiophene, or pyridine;<br>
b)	each ring is optionally substituted with up to 5<br>

[0022] In another embodiment, R1 is Ci-i2aliphatic or<br>
C3-iocycloalkyl, wherein each R1 is optionally substituted with<br>
1-3 groups selected independently from R8. In yet another<br>

[0058] It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that<br>
certain compounds of this invention may exist in tautomeric<br>
forms or hydrated forms, all such forms of the compounds being<br>
within the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated,<br>
structures depicted herein are also meant to include all<br>
stereochemical forms of the structure; i.e., the R and S<br>
configurations for each asymmetric center. Therefore, single<br>
stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric and<br>
diastereomeric mixtures of the present compounds are within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
[0059] Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein<br>
are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the<br>
presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For<br>
example, compounds having the present structures except for<br><br>
the replacement of a hydrogen t»y a deuterium or tritium, or<br>
the replacement of a carbon by a 13C- or "c-enriched carbon are<br>
within the scope of this invention.<br>
[0060] The compounds of this invention may be obtained by<br>
any method, including general, synthetic methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art for analogous compounds (see e.g., WO<br>
99/47545). For the purposes off illustration, the following<br>
Schemes for the synthesis of the compounds of the present<br>
invention are provided.<br>
[0061] The following abbrevi-ations are used:<br>
BDC is l-(3-dimethylaminopropyL )-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
HOBt is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
THF is tetrahydrofuran<br>
TFA is trifluoroacetic acid<br>
DCM is dichloromethane<br>
DMAP is 4-dimethylaminopyridinei<br>
DIPEA is diisopropylethylamine<br>
DMF is dimethylformamide<br>
TFA is trifluoroacetic acid<br>
Z is benzyloxycarbonyl<br>
1H NMR is nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
TLC is thin layer chromatograph-y<br><br><br>
[0062] Scheme I depicts a general route to prepare the<br>
compounds E and F disclosed in this invention. The amino<br>
group of species A, readily obtained from reduction of the cc-<br>
carboxylic group of aspartic acid (protected with PGi as an<br>
ester), is coupled to the carboxylic acid moiety of species B<br>
(N-protected with PG2) to give species C. PGi and PG2 are<br>
orthogonal protecting groups (i.e., protecting groups where a<br>
protecting group may be selectively removed in the presence of<br>
another protecting group. Ideally, PGi should be able to be<br>
removed without removing PG2 and-vice versa). Here, the<br>
aspartate part of the molecule is then manipulated in an<br>
oxidation/ketalisation/ deprotection/cyclisation sequence to<br>
give species D. The Ring A portion of D is then<br>
functionalized further to give species E which is part of the<br>
disclosed invention. Deprotection of the ketal gives species<br>
F which represent the other part of the disclosed invention.<br>
[0063] In various embodiments of this invention, PG2 is a<br>
suitable amine protecting group, including but not limited to,<br>
the amine protecting groups described in T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M<br>
Wutz, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd Edition,<br><br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1999 and other editions) ("Greene").<br>
A "Z" protecting group (benzyloxycarbonyl) is a particularly<br>
useful N-protecting group for use in connection with this<br>
invention. In compounds wherein PG2 is protecting the nitrogen<br>
of a proline, PG2 is preferably z. it should be understood<br>
that modified Z groups (*Z-type protecting groups") employed<br>
in connection with the compounds and processes of this<br>
invention would also fall within the scope of this invention.<br>
For example, Z could be substituted at the CH2 group or the<br>
phenyl group with R8 (preferably halo or Ci-g straight-chained<br>
or branched alkyl) to provide a Z-type protecting group.<br>
[0064] In various embodiments of this invention, PGi is a<br>
suitable carboxylic acid protecting group, including but not<br>
limited to the acid protecting groups described in Greene. In<br>
certain embodiments, PGi is C1-6 straight-chained or branched<br>
alkyl group. A t-butyl group is a particularly useful acid<br>
protecting group for use in connection with this invention.<br>
[0065] In Scheme I, compound A is a modified aspartic acid<br>
residue. In addition to compound A, other modified aspartic<br>
acid residues, including the following, have been reported:<br><br>
wherein, PG3 and PG4 are appropriate protecting groups. These<br>
modified aspartic acids may be prepared by methods known to<br>
skilled practitioners. See, for example, United States Patent<br>

I and II, wherein. Ring A is unsubstituted proline. Here the<br>
cyclic acetal form of a compound of this invention is depicted<br>
as formula I and the aldehyde form, is depicted as formula II.<br>
Compounds having a Ring A other than unsubstituted proline<br>
could .be substituted in the methods depicted in Scheme I.<br>
[0067] Scheme II depicts the routes utilized to prepare<br>
compounds of formulae I and II. Compounds I can be prepared<br>
from compounds 1 by condensation of the amino group in 1 with<br>
the suitably functionalized carboxylic acid (or derivative).<br>
In this step, standard coupling reagents to form amide bonds<br>
have been depicted; other conditions known in the art to form<br>
amide bonds can also be used.<br>
[0068] As known zo skilled practitioners, a carboxylic acid<br>
(-C(O)OH) can be coupled to the amine under appropriate<br>
conditions for coupling amines and carboxylic acids.<br>
Alternatively, in such couplings, a carboxylic acid derivative<br>
(-C(O)X) may be employed instead of the carboxylic acid. It<br>
should be understood that in the context of coupling an amine<br>
and a carboxylic acid derivative, the derivative would<br>
activate the acid to facilitate coupling to an amine.<br>
Appropriate X groups are essentially leaving groups and are<br>
known to skilled practitioners. 'March's Advanced organic<br>

[0069] Typical conditions for coupling an amine and an acid<br>
include combining a suitable solvent, a carboxylic acid, a<br>
base, and a peptide-coupliny reayenl. Examples of suitable<br>
conditions are described in US2002/C042376 and WO 31/81330,<br>

In some embodiments R is C(=0). Suitable conditions foar using<br>
these appropriate derivatives are known in the art.<br><br>
[0071] Scheme III depicts a possible route to prepare<br>
compounds 7 and compounds 1 described in scheme I. Compound<br>
2, readily obtained from reduction of the a-carboxylic c^roup<br>
of aspartic acid, is coupled to N-protected proline (or other<br>
ring, wherein Ring A is other than unsubstituted proline) to<br>
form 3. Here, the proline is N-protected with a Z<br>
(benzyloxycarbonyl) group. Compounds 3 are then oxidized into<br>
the aldehydes 4 which are acetalized in situ to give the<br><br>
acetals 5. Acetals can be formed in the presence of I^-OH (or<br>
a suitable acetal forming reagent), a protic acid (for<br>
example, TsOH), or a Lewis acid, and a suitable solvent.<br>
Examples of suitable acetal forming reagents that form<br>
compounds wherein R1 is to become ethyl can be considered<br>
ethanol equivalents and include, but are not limited to,<br>
triethylorthoformate or a diethylacetal, such as a<br>
(CH3)2C(0CH2CH3)2. Preferably, the solvent is CH2C12, toluene,<br>
or chlorobenzene. Appropriate protic acids include, but are<br>
not limited to, TEA, p-TsOH. Appropriate Lewis acids<br>
include, but are not limited to TiCl4
[0072] In Scheme III, the oxidation of compounds 3 to<br>
compounds 4 is depicted as being done under Swern conditions.<br>
Other oxidation conditions may also be employed to prepare<br>
compounds of this invention. Preferred oxidation conditions<br>
are those that a mild and relatively quick to minimize<br>
epimerization at the acid side chain of the modified aspartic<br>
acid residue. In one embodiment, the oxidation step is a<br>
TEMPO oxidation (see Example 1-1, Method C, below) . Other<br>
oxidation conditions include a Dess-Martin oxidation and a<br>
tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) oxidation.<br>
[0073] Aldehydes 4 may be isolated but are preferably<br>
carried through directly to 5 without isolation. Deprotection<br>
of the terfc-butyl ester (in 5) is accompanied by spontaneous<br>
ring cyclization to give a mixture of diastereoisomers which<br>
were separated by column chromatography to give the<br>
enantiomerically pure syn ketals 6 and anti ketals (not<br>
represented in this scheme). The deprotection may be done<br>
under protic acid or Lewis acid conditions in an appropriate<br>
solvent. Appropriate solvents include, but are not limited<br>
to, toluene, chlorobenzene, and DCM. Appropriate protic acids<br>
include, but are not limited to, TPA, p-TsOH. Appropriate<br><br>
Lewis acids include, but are not limited to TiCli, MgBr2, and<br>
ZnCl2. For clarity of the scheme, only syn ketals are<br>
represented in the next steps to form compounds 7 and 1 but<br>
the same sequence may be used to form anti ketals. Compounds<br>
6	are submitted to hydrogenolysis and the resulting compounds<br>
7	are reacted with Z-protected aminoacids, using conditions<br>
known in the art to prepare amide bonds, to yield compounds 9.<br>
Compounds 7 may be generated and used in situ. If isolated,<br>
it is preferable to use compounds 7 relatively soon after<br>
generation. Compounds 9 are finally submitted to<br>
hydrogenolysis to give compounds 1, which can be used directly<br>
to prepare compounds I, as depicted in Scheme II.<br>
[0074] Alternatively, compounds 7 can be used to prepare<br>
compounds I, as depicted in Scheme II. In this preparation,<br>
an amino acid residue and the desired N-terminal group is<br>
prepared in one step (see, Scheme II, reaction (b)).<br>
[0075] As described in connection with Scheme I, aspartic<br>
acid derivatives other than compounds 2 can be employed to<br>
obtain compounds of this invention.<br><br>

this invention is depicted as formula III and the aldehyde<br>
form is depicted as formula IV. Scheme IV depicts the routes<br>
utilized to prepare compounds of formulae III and IV.<br>
Compounds III can be prepared from compounds 11 by<br>
condensation of the amino group in 11 under conditions to<br>
provide the desired R group, such as suitably functionalized<br>
carboxylic acid (or derivative), sulfonic acid (or<br>
derivative), chloroformate or carbamoyl chloride (or<br>
isocyanate), for example, under appropriate reaction<br>
condition. In this step, standard coupling reagents to form<br>
CO-NH bonds have been depicted; other conditions known in the<br>
art to form CO-NH (or alkyl-N, or £02-N) bonds can also be used<br>
to provide the desired compound comprising R-N.<br>
Alternatively, compounds I can be prepared from compounds 17<br>
by condensation of the amino group in 17 with the suitably<br>
functionalized carboxylic acid (or derivative), sulfonic acid<br>
(or derivative), chloroformate or carbamoyl chloride (or<br>
isocyanate). In this step, standard coupling reagents to form<br>
CO-NH bonds have been depicted; other conditions known in the<br>
art to form CO-NH bonds can also be used.<br><br>
either commercially available, reported in the literature, or<br>
may be prepared according to methods known in the literature.<br>
[0078] For clarity of the scheme, only syn ketals are<br>
represented in the next steps to form compounds 17 and 11 but<br>
the same sequence may be used to form anti ketals. Compounds<br>
16	are submitted to hydrogenolysis and the resulting compounds<br>
17	are reacted with Z-protected aminoacids, using conditions<br>
known in the art to prepare amide bonds, to yield compounds<br>
19.<br>
[0079] Alternatively, compounds 17 can be used to prepare<br>
compounds III, as depicted in Scheme IV. Compounds 19 are<br>
finally submitted to hydrogenolysis to give compounds 11,<br>
which can be used directly to prepare compounds III, as<br>
depicted in Scheme IV.<br>
[0080] The R3COOH used in Scheme II are either commercially<br>
available, reported in the literature, or prepared according<br>
to methods known in the literature. For compound 11-30, 2-<br>
chloro-3-methoxybenzoic acid was prepared as in J.Org.Chem,<br>
59, 1994, 2939-2944.<br>
[0081] For compound 11-32, 2-chloro-3-<br>

trifluoromethoxybenzoic acid (prepared as in J.Org.Chem, 68,<br>
2003, 4693-4699) using a Sandmeyer replacement of the amino<br>
group by a chloro, according to a method substantially similar<br>
to the one reported in J.Org.Chem, 59, 1994, 2939-2944.<br>

[0*103] In accordance with, this invention, the processes may-<br>
be used alone or in combination to provide a compound of this<br>
invention.<br>
[0104] Certain specific embodiments of this invention<br>
provide processes for preparing compounds 4 from 3 (in<br>
embodiments where compounds 4 are isolated); 5 from 3 (in<br>
embodiments where compounds 4 is not isolated but carried on<br>
directly, e.g., generated in situ); 5 from 4; and 6 from 5<br>
according to the methods disclosed herein. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, compounds 6 are prepared from, compounds 5;<br>
compounds 5 are prepared from compounds 4 (whether isolated or<br>
not); and compounds 4 are prepared from 3 . Preferably,<br>
compounds 6 are used in the preparation of proline containing<br>
caspase inhibitors. Such proline containing caspase<br>
inhibitors include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in<br>
WO 95/35308, WO 99/47545, WO.01/81330, and WO 01/90063 (which<br>
are all incorporated herein by reference) . For example,<br>
compound IA (and stereoisomers thereof) of WO 01/90063 (which<br>
are specifically incorporated herein by reference) could be<br>
prepared as disclosed herein (see, e.g., page 13). For the<br>
avoidance of doubt, it should be understood that such proline<br>
containing compounds could be depicted by formula I except<br>
that Ring A is pyrrolidine (i.e. is derived from<br>
proline) ..<br>
[0105] The processes for converting compounds 6 to proline<br>
containing caspase inhibitors are preferably as disclosed<br>
herein. The processes for preparing compounds 3 are also<br>
preferably as disclosed herein. However other processes known<br>
to skilled practitioners could be used to convert compounds 6<br>
to proline containing caspase inhibitors and/or to prepare<br>
compounds 3.<br><br>
[0106] other embodiments of this invention provide the<br>
compounds of formula 3 to 6, 3-A to 6-A, and 13-16.<br>

compounds of formula 4A:<br><br>
[0108] Another embodiment of this invention provides the<br>
compounds of formula 4:<br><br>
[0109] Another embodiment of this invention provides the<br>
compounds of formula 14:<br><br>
[0110] One embodiment of this invention provides the<br>
compounds of formula 5-A:<br><br>
[0111] Another embodiment of this invention provides the<br>
compounds of formula 5:<br><br><br>
[0112] Another embodiment of this invention provides the<br>
compounds of formula 15:<br><br>
[0113] One embodiment of this invention provic3.es the<br>
compounds of formula 3-A:<br><br>
[0114] Another embodiment of this invention provides the<br>
compounds of formula 3:<br><br>
[0115] Another embodiment of this invention provides the<br>
compounds of formula 13:<br><br><br>
[0116] In all the above embodiments, the variables are as<br>
defined in any of the embodiments herein. In a preferred form<br>
of 3, PG2 is Z and PGi is Ci-s straight-chained or branched<br>
alkyl group (preferably a t-butyl group), either alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
[0117] As would be realized by skilled practitioners<br>
certain process steps may be accomplished in discrete steps or<br>
in situ. For example, deprotection and subsequent reaction of<br>
an amine may be accomplished by step-wise (by isolating the<br>
amine) or in a one step procedure (without isolating trie<br>
amine).<br>
[0118] In certain embodiments, the above processes are<br>
conducted as described herein (e.g., in the schemes, examples,<br>
and accompanying description) .<br>
[0119] Compounds such as 3 could be used in processes for<br>
preparing proline containing compounds, such as caspase<br>
inhibitors. Proline containing caspase inhibitors include,<br>
but are not limited to, those disclosed in WO 95/35308, WO<br>
99/47545, WO 01/81330, and WO 01/90063 (which are all<br>
incorporated herein by reference) . For example, compound IA<br>
(and stereoisomers thereof) of WO 01/90063 (which are<br>
specifically incorporated herein by reference) could be<br>
prepared as disclosed herein (see, e.g., page 13).<br>
[0120] The compounds utilized in the compositions and<br>
methods of this invention may also be modified by appending<br>
appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological<br>
properties. Such modifications are known in the art and<br>
include those which increase biological penetration into a<br>
given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system,<br>
central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase<br><br><br>
Reagent and conditions: (a) EDC, HOBt, DMAP, DIPEA, THF; (b)<br>
Swern; (c) I^OH, 3A sieves, DCM, TsOH; (d) TFA, DCM; (e) H2,<br>
Pd(OH)2, StOAC, DMF, Et3KT; (f) EDC, HOBt, Et3N, EtOAc, DMF; (g)<br>
H2, Pd/C, Citrate Acid.<br>
[0077] Scheme V depicts a possible route to prepare<br>
compounds 17 and compounds 11 described in scheme III.<br>
Compound 2, readily obtained from reduction of the (X-<br>
carboxylic group of aspartic acid, is coupled to N-protected<br>
2-aza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-3-carboxylic acid 10 (prepared as<br>
in Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 13, 2002, 25-28) to form 13.<br>
Compound 13 is then oxidized into the aldehyde 14 which is<br>
acetalized in situ to give the acetals 15. Deprotection of<br>
the fcerfc-butyl ester is accompanied by spontaneous ring<br>
cyclization to give a mixture of diastereoisomers which were<br>
separated by column chromatography to give the<br>
enantiomerically pure syix ketals 16 and anti ketals (not<br>
represented in this scheme) . Alternative Ring A groups are<br><br>
solubility to allow administration by injection, alter<br>
metabolism and alter rate of excretion.<br>
[0121] For example, a carboxylic acid group in a compound<br>
of this invention may be derivatized as, for example, an<br>
ester. Preferred esters would be those derived from:<br>
a Ci-6 straight-chained or branched alkyl, alkenyl,<br>
or alkynyl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl is<br>
optionally substituted with C6-ioaryl, CF3, CI, F, OMe, OEt,<br>
OCF3, CN, or NMe2;<br>
a Ci_6 cycloalkyl, wherein 1-2 carbon atoms in trie<br>
cycloalkyl is optionally replaced with -0- or -NR9-.<br>
[0122] Compounds of this invention having a carbonyl group<br>
may be similarly derivatized as, e.g., an acetal, ketal, oxime<br>
(=N0R9), hydrazine (=NN(R9)2), thioacetal, or thioketal.<br>
[0123] Appropriate derivatives of amines are known in the<br>
art and are also included within the scope of this invention.<br>
[0124] Certain of the above derivatives would include the<br>
protective groups known to skilled practitioners (see, e.g.,<br>
Greene). As would be recognized by a skilled practitioner,<br>
these protective groups may also be employed in the processes<br>
of this invention.<br>
[0125] The compounds of this invention may be assayed for<br>
their ability to inhibit apoptosis, the release of IL-1|3 or<br>
caspase activity directly. Assays for each of the activities<br>
are known in the art. However, as would be recognized by a<br>
skilled practitioner, a prodrug compound of this invention<br>
should be active only in assays where the prodrug moiety would<br>
be cleaved, typically in in vivo assays.<br>
[0126] Assays for caspase activity are described in W0<br>
99/47545.<br>
[0127] According to another embodiment, the present<br>

potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium<br>
and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases, such as<br>
dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl—D-glucamine, and salts with<br>
amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth.<br>
[0129] Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be<br>
guaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as<br>
methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and<br>
iodides; dialkyl sulfates, such as dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl<br>
and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl,<br>
myristyl and stearyl chlorides, brromides and iodides, aralkyl<br><br>
halides, such as benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others.<br>
Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby<br>

glycol and wool fat.<br>
[0131] According to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
compositions of this invention are formulated for<br>
pharmaceutical administration to a mammal, preferably a human<br>
being.<br>
[0132] Such pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by<br>
inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally,<br>
vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term<br>
"parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial,<br>
intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and<br>
intracranial injection or infusion techniques. Preferably,<br>
the compositions are administered orally or intravenously.<br>
[0133] Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of this<br>
invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These<br><br>
suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in<br>
the art using suitable dispersing or wettin.g agents and<br>
suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may<br>
also be a sterile injectable solution or su.spension in a<br>
non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for<br>
example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Ajnong the acceptable<br>
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's<br>
solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition,<br>
sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent<br>
or suspending medium. For this purpose, an.y bland fixed oil<br>
may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides.<br>
Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives<br>
are useful in the preparation of injectable^, as are natural<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor<br>
oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil<br>
solutions or suspensions may also contain a. long-chain alcohol<br>
diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethy-1 cellulose or,<br>
similar dispersing agents which are commonly used in the<br>
formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms<br>
including emulsions and suspensions. Other- commonly used<br>
surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and othar emulsifying<br>
agents or bioavailability enhancers which a.re commonly used in<br>
the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid,<br>
or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of<br>
formulation.<br>
[0134] The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention<br>
may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage<br>
form including, but not limited to, capsule.s, tablets, aqueous<br>
suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral<br>
use, carriers which are commonly used inclu.de lactose and corn<br>
starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are<br>
also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule<br><br>
form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch..<br>
When aqueous suspensions are required ffor oral use, the active<br>
ingredient is combined with emulsifying- and suspending agents.<br>
If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents<br>
may also be added.<br>
[0135] Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
this invention may be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration.. These can be<br>
prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating<br>
excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at<br>
rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to<br>
release the drug. Such materials inclu.de cocoa butter,<br>
beeswax and polyethylene glycols.<br>
[0136] The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention<br>
may also be administered topically, especially when the target<br>
of treatment includes areas or organs rreadily accessible by<br>
topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin,<br>
or the lower intestinal tract. SuitaKLe topical formulations<br>
are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs.<br>
[0137] Topical application for the Lower intestinal tract<br>
can be effected in a rectal suppositoiy formulation (see<br>
above) or in a suitable enema formulati_on.<br>
Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.<br>
[0138] For topical applications, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated in a sui-table ointment<br>
containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one<br>
or more carriers. Carriers for topical, administration of the<br>
compounds of this invention include, bu.t are not limited to,<br>
mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene<br>
glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound,<br>
emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream<br><br>
containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one<br>
or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable<br>
carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil,<br>
sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax,<br>
cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
[0139] For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
may be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH<br>
adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in<br>
isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with our without<br>
a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride.<br>
Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as<br>
petrolatum. In one embodiment, the compositions are as<br>
formulated in, e.g., U.S. Patent 6,645,994 aiid/or U.S. Patent<br>
6,630,473.<br>
[0140] The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention<br>
may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such<br>
compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known<br>
in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared<br>
as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other<br>
suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance<br>
bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional<br>
solubilizing or dispersing agents.<br>

Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), Chronic Infantile<br><br>
Neurological Cutaneous and Articular Syndrome (CINCAS), a.k.a.<br>
Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID),<br>
TNPRl-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), and Hyper-IgD<br>
periodic fever Syndrome (HIDS). The compounds and<br>
compositions are also useful in treating complications<br>
associated with coronary artery bypass grafts. The compounds<br>
and compositions are also useful for decreasing IGIF (also<br>
known as IL-18) or IFN-y production. The compounds and<br>
compositions are also useful in immunotherapy as a cancer<br>
treatment.<br>
[0142] The compounds and compositions may also be used in<br>
methods for preserving cells. These methods would be useful<br>
for preserving organs, particularly those intended for<br>
transplant, or blood products.<br>
[0143] The compounds of this invention are useful as dual<br>
caspase-1 and capase-8 inhibitors. Without being bound by<br>
theory, the R2 and R3 groups of the compounds of this invention<br>
appear to be related to this surprising activity. Bridged A<br>
groups of the compounds of this invention, such as<br>
  also appear to be related to this surprising<br>

of this invention should be sufficient to cause a detectable<br>
decrease in the severity of the disease or in caspase activity<br>
and/or cell apoptosis, as measured by any of the assays known<br>
in the art.<br>
[0146] Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 50 or<br>
about 100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between 0.5<br>
and about 75 mg/kg body weight per day and most preferably<br>
between about 1 and about 25 or about 50 mg/kg body weight per<br>
day of the active ingredient compound are useful in a<br>
monotherapy.<br>
[0147] Typically, a compound or composition of this<br>
invention will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times<br>
per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such<br>
administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The<br>
amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the<br>
carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary<br>
depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of<br>
administration. A typical preparation will contain from about<br>
5% to about 95% active compound (w/w) . Preferably, such<br>
preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active<br>
compound.<br>
[0148] When the compositions of this invention comprise a<br>
combination of a compound of this invention and one or more<br>
additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents, both the<br>
compound and the additional agent should be present at dosage<br>
levels of between about 10% to about 100%, and more preferably<br>
between about 10% to about 80% of the dosage normally<br>
administered in a monotherapy regime.<br><br>
[0149] Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a<br>
maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of<br>
this invention may be administered, if necessary.<br>
Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or<br>
both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a<br>
level at which the improved condition is retained when the<br>
symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment<br>
should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent<br>
treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease<br>
symptoms.<br>
[0150] As the skilled practitioner will appreciate, lower<br>
or higher doses than those recited above may be required. It<br>
should be understood that a specific dosage and treatment<br>
regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety<br>
of factors, including the activity of the specific compound<br>
employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet,<br>
time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination,<br>
the severity and course of the particular disease, the<br>
patient's disposition to the disease being treated, and the<br>
judgment of the treating physician. The amount of active<br>
ingredients will also depend upon the particular compound and<br>
other therapeutic agent, if present, in the composition.<br>
[0151] In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a<br>
method of treating a patient, preferably a mammal, having one<br>
of the aforementioned diseases, comprising the step of<br>
administering to said patient a compound or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable composition described above. In this embodiment,<br>
if the patient is also administered another therapeutic agent<br>
or caspase inhibitor, it may be delivered together with the<br>
compound of this invention in a single dosage form, or, as a<br>
separate dosage form. When administered as a separate dosage<br>
form, the other caspase inhibitor or agent may be administered<br><br>
prior to, at the same time as, or following administration of<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a<br>
compound of this invention.<br>
[0152] The compounds of this invention may also be<br>
incorporated into compositions for coating implantable medical<br>
devices, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular<br>
grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for<br>
coating an implantable device comprising a compound of the<br>
present invention and a carrier suitable for coating said,<br>
implantable device. In still another aspect, the present<br>
invention includes an implantable device coated with a<br>
composition comprising a compound of the present invention and<br>
a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device.<br>
[0153] Another aspect of the invention relates to<br>
inhibiting caspase activity in a biological sample, which &gt;<br>
method comprises contacting said biological sample with a<br>
compound of this invention or a composition comprising said<br>
compound. The term "biological sample", as used herein,<br>
includes, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts<br>
thereof; biopsied material obtained from a mammal or extracts<br>
thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or<br>
other body fluids or extracts thereof.<br>
[0154] Inhibition of caspase activity in a biological<br>
sample is useful for a variety of purposes that are known to<br>
one of skill in the art. Examples of such purposes include,<br>
but are not limited to, blood transfusion, organ-<br>
transplantation, biological specimen storage, and biological<br>
assays.<br>
[0155] The compounds of this invention are useful in<br>
methods for preserving cells, such as may be needed for an<br>
organ transplant or for preserving blood products. Similar<br><br>
uses for caspase inhibitors have been reported [Schierle et<br>
al., Nature Medicine, 5, 97 (1999)]. The method involves<br>
treating the cells or tissue to be preserved with a solution<br>
comprising the caspase inhibitor. The amount of caspase<br>
inhibitor needed will depend on the effectiveness of the<br>
inhibitor for the given cell type and the length of time<br>
required to preserve the cells from apoptotic cell death.<br>
[01563 Without being bound by theory, applicants' cyclic<br>
acetal compounds are believed to be prodrugs. That is, the<br>
acetal portion is cleaved in vivo to provide a corresponding<br>
acid-aldehyde compound. As would be recognized by a skilled<br>
practitioner, chemical compounds may be metabolized in vivo,<br>
e.g., at a site other than the prodrug cleavage site. Any<br>
such metabolites are included within the scope of this<br>
invention.<br>
[0157] In order that this invention be more fully<br>
understood, the following preparative and testing examples are<br>
set forth. These examples are for the purpose of illustration<br>
only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the<br>
invention in any way.<br>

(344nig) in ethyl acetate (20ml)was added palladium<br>
hydroxide/carbon (20% w/w, 74mg) . The mixture was stirred<br>
under an atmosphere of hydrogen until no starting material was<br>
present by TLC. The catalyst was removed by filtration through<br>
celite and the filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure to<br>
give the amine as a brown foam (260mg) . A portion of this<br>
material (153mg) was dissolved in THF and 3-methoxy-2-methyl<br>
benzoic acid (146mg&gt;, diisopropylamine (191jil) ,<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (77mg) and l-(3- ,<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiiird.de hydrochloride (EDC,<br>
109mg) were added. The resulting mixture was stirred at<br>
ambient temperature for 24 hours then diluted with saturated<br>
aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase was removed and<br>
washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride, then brine,<br>
dried (magnesium sulfate) , filtered and concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure. The crude product was purified on silica<br>
gel, eluting with ethyl acetate. This gave the sub-title<br>
compound as a white solid (138mg, 62%) ; analytical data<br>

BIOLOGICAL METHODS<br>
[0180] Compounds of this invention may be tested using the<br>
methods described below. Table 5 lists caspase-1 and caspase-<br>
8 enzyme inhibition data for compounds II-1-II-25. In the<br>
Table, compounds with a Ki of 
compounds with a Ki of 10-20 are assigned category B, and<br>
compounds with a Ki of 21-30 are assigned category C.<br>
Xn Vitro Assays<br>
Enzyme Inhibition<br>
[0181] Ki values for test compounds with caspase-1 and<br>
caspase-8 were obtained by the method of Margolin et al. (J.<br><br>
Biol. Chem., 272 pp. 7223-7228 (1997)). Other caspases may be<br>
assayed simiLarly (see, e.g., WO 99/47545). Assays were<br>
performed in 10 mM Tris (Sigma Corp, St Louis MO) pH 7.5, 1 mM<br>
Dithiothreitol (DTT, Research Organic INC, Cleveland, OH) and<br>
0.1% CHAPS (Pierce, Rockford IL) at 37 °C. For caspase-3, a<br>
solution of 8% glycerol was added to the assay buffer to<br>
improve enzyme stability. A 65 uL aliquot of the assay buffer<br>
and 5 uL alicjuot of the appropriate dilutions of inhibitor in<br>
DMSO where pipetted into a 96 well plate, treated with 10 uL<br>
of caspase, then diluted in assay buffer (0.5-40 nM active<br>
protein by active site titration) . A control containing DMSO<br>
but no compound was included for each determination. The<br>
plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C, before<br>
addition of the appropriate substrate (20 uL, final<br>
concentration 1-4 x KM, final assay volume 100 uli) to initiate<br>
the reaction. Reaction rates were measured at 37°C either by<br>
following the time dependant increase in absorbance at 405 nM<br>
(for the pNA substrates) or in fluorescence (Ex 390, Em 460)<br>
(for the AMC substrates). The rates obtained were plotted<br>
against inhibitor concentration and the data fit to the<br>
Morrison tiglat-binding equation for competitive inhibitors<br>
(Morrison, J. F. , Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 185 pp. 269-286<br>
(1969)). The substrates used for the individual assays were<br>
as follows:<br>
[0182] Caspase-1 Suc-YVAD-pNA (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA)<br>
(final concentration in the assay 80 uM) ;<br>
[0183] Caspase-8 Ac-DEVD-pNA (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA)<br>

PBMC Cell Assay<br>
IL-lp Assay with a. Mixed Population of Human Peripheral Blood<br>
Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) or Enriched Adherent Mononuclear<br>
Cells<br>
[0184] Processing of pre-IL-1^ by ICE may be measured in<br>
cell culture using a variety of cell sources. Human PBMC<br>
obtained from healthy donors provides a mixed population of<br>
lymphocyte subtypes and mononuclear cells that produce a<br>
spectrum of interleukins and cytokines in response to many<br>
classes of physiological stimulators. Adherent mononuclear<br>
cells from PBMC provides an enriched source of normal<br>
monocytes for selective studies of cytokine production by<br>
activated cells.<br>
Experimental Procedure:<br>
[0185] An initial dilution series of test compound in DMSO<br>
or ethanol is prepared, with a subsequent dilution into RPMI-<br>
10% FBS media (containing 2 niM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 50 U<br>
and 50 ug/ml pen/strep) respectively to yield drugs at 4x the<br>
final test concentration containing 0.4% DMSO or 0.4% ethanol.<br>
The final concentration of DMSO is 0.1% for all drug<br>
dilutions. A concentration titration which brackets the<br>
apparent Ki for a test compound determined in an ICE<br>
inhibition assay is generally used for the primary compound<br>
screen.<br>
[0186] Generally 5-6 compound dilutions are tested and the<br>
cellular component of the assay is performed in duplicate,<br>
with duplicate EL.ISA determinations on each cell culture<br>
supernatant,<br><br>
PBMC Isolation and IL-1 Assay:<br>
[0187] Buffy coat cells isolated from one pint human blood<br>
(yielding 40-45 ml final volume plasma plus cells) are diluted<br>
with media to 80 ml and LeukoPREP separation tubes (Becton<br>
Dickinson) are each overlaid with 10 ml of cell suspension.<br>
After 15 min centrifugation at 1500-1800 xg, the plasma/media<br>
layer is aspirated and then the mononuclear cell layer is<br>
collected with a Pasteur pipette and transferred to a 15 ml<br>
conical centrifuge tube (Corning) . Media is added to bring<br>
the volume to 15 ml, gently mix the cells by inversion and<br>
centrifuge at 300 xg for 15 min. The PBMC pellet is<br>
resuspended in a small volume of media, the cells are counted<br>
and adjusted to 6 x 10^ cells/ml.<br>
[0188] For the cellular assay, 1.0 ml of the cell<br>
suspension is added to each well of a 24-well flat bottom<br>
tissue culture plate (Corning), 0.5 ml test compound dilution<br>
and 0.5 ml LPS solution (Sigma #L-3012; 20 ng/ml solution<br>
prepared in complete RPMI media; final LPS concentration 5<br>
ng/ml). The 0.5 ml additions of test compound and LPS are<br>
usually sufficient to mix the contents of the wells. Three<br>
control mixtures are run per experiment, with either LPS<br>
alone, solvent vehicle control, and/or additional media to<br>
adjust the final culture volume to 2.0 ml. The cell cultures<br>
are incubated for 16-18 hr at 37 °C in the presence o£ 5% CO2 ■<br>
[0189] At the end of the incubation period, cells are<br>
harvested and transferred to 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes.<br>
After centrifugation for 10 min at 200 xg, supernatants are<br>
harvested and transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. It may<br>
be noted that the cell pellet may be utilized for a<br>
biochemical evaluation of pre-lL-ip and/or mature IL-1|} content<br>
in cytosol extracts by western blotting or ELISA with pre-IL-<br>
ip specific antisera.<br><br>
Isolation of Adherent Mononuclear cells:<br>
[0190] PBMC are isolated and prepared as described above.<br>
Media (1.0 ml) is first added to wells followed by 0.5 ml of<br>
the PBMC suspension. After a one hour incubation, plates are<br>
gently shaken and nonadherent cells aspirated from each well.<br>
Wells are then gently washed three times with 1.0 ml of media<br>
and final resuspended in 1.0 ml media. The enrichment for<br>
adherent cells generally yields 2.5-3.0 x 10^ cells per well.<br>
The addition of test compounds, LPS, cell incubation<br>
conditions and processing of supernatants proceeds as<br>
described above.<br>
ELISA:<br>
[0191] Quantikiine kits (R&amp;D Systems) may be used for the<br>
measurement of mature IL-1|5. Assays are performed according<br>
to the manufacturer's directions. Mature IL-lp levels of<br>
about 1-3 ng/ml In both PBMC and adherent mononuclear cell<br>
positive controls are observed. ELISA assays are performed on<br>
1:5, 1:10 and 1:2 0 dilutions of supernatants from LPS-positive<br>
controls to select the optimal dilution for supernatants in<br>
the test panel.<br>
[0192] The inb-ibitory potency of the compounds can be<br>
represented by an. IC50 value, which is the concentration of<br>
inhibitor at which 50% of mature IL-ip is detected in the<br>
supernatant as compared to the positive controls.<br>
[0193] The skilled practitioner realizes that values<br>
obtained in cell assays may depend on multiple factors. The<br>
values may not necessarily represent fine quantitative<br>
results.<br>
[0194] Selected compounds of this invention have been<br>
tested for inhibition of IL-lp release from PBMCs with IC50<br>
values between 30 0nM and 4uM.<br><br>
Whole Blood Assay for IL-lft Production<br>
[0195] Whole blood assay IC50 values for compounds of this<br>
invention may be obtained using the method described below:<br>
Purpose:<br>
[0196] The whole blood assay is a simple method for<br>
measuring the production of iL-ip (or other cytokines) and the<br>
activity of potential inhibitors. The complexity of this<br>
assay system, with its full complement of lymphoid and<br>
inflammatory cell types, spectrum of plasma proteins and red<br>
blood cells is an ideal in vitro representation of human in<br>
vivo physiologic conditions.<br>
Materials;<br>
Pyrogen-free syringes (~ 30 cc)<br>
Pyrogen-free sterile vacuum tubes containing lyophilized<br>
Na2EDTA (4.5 mg/10 ml tube)<br>
Human whole blood sample (- 30-50 cc)<br>
1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes<br>
Test compound stock solutions {- 25mM in DMSO or other<br>
solvent)<br>
Endotoxin -free sodium chloride solution (0.9%) and HBSS<br>
Lipopolysacchsride (Sigma; Cat.# L-3012) stock solution at<br>
lmg/ml in HBSS<br>
IL-lp ELISA Kit (R&amp;D Systems; Cat # DLB50)<br>
TNFa ELISA Kit (R&amp;D Systems; Cat # DTA50)<br>
Water bath or incubator<br>
Whole Blood Assay Experimental Procedure:<br>
[0197] Set incubator or water bath at 30 °C. Aliquot<br>
0.25ml of blood into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. Note: be sure<br>
to invert the whole blood sample tubes after every two<br>
aliquots. Differences in replicates may result if the cells<br>
sediment and are not uniformly suspended. Use of a positive<br><br>
displacement pipette will also minimize differences between<br>
replicate aliguots.<br>
[0198] Prepare drug dilutions in sterile pyrogen-free<br>
saline by serial dilution. A dilution series which brackets<br>
the apparent K^ for a test compound determined in an ICE<br>
inhibition assay is generally used for the primary compound<br>
screen. For extremely hydrophobic compounds, prepare compound<br>
dilutions in fresh plasma obtained from the same blood donor<br>
or in PBS-containing 5% DMSO to enhance solubility.<br>
[0199] Add 25 ul test compound dilution or vehicle control<br>
and gently mix the sample. Then add 5.0 ul LPS solution (250<br>
ng/ml stocked prepared, fresh: 5.0 ng/ml final concentration<br>
LPS), and mix again. Incubate the tubes at 30 °C in a water<br>
bath for 16-18 hr with, occasional mixing. Alternatively, the<br>
tubes can be placed in a rotator set at 4 rpm for the same<br>
incubation period. This assay should be set up in duplicate<br>
or triplicate with the following controls: negative control -<br>
no LPS; positive control - no test inhibitor; vehicle control<br>
- the highest concentration of DMSO or compound solvent used<br>
in the experiment. Additional saline is added to all control<br>
tubes to normalize volumes for both control and experimental<br>
whole blood test samples.<br>
[0200] After the incubation period, whole blood samples are<br>
centrifuged for 10 minutes at ~ 2000 rpm in the microfuge,<br>
plasma is transferred to a fresh microfuge tube and<br>
centrifuged at 1000 x g to pellet residual platelets if<br>
necessary. Plasma samples may be stored frozen at -70 °C<br>
prior to assay for cytokine levels by ELISA.<br>
ELISA:<br>
[0201] R&amp;D Systems (614 McKinley Place N.E. Minneapolis,<br>
MN 55413) Quantikine kits may be used for measurement of IL-ip<br>
and TNF-a. The assays are performed according to the<br><br>
manufacturer's directions. IL-ip levels of ~ 1-5 ng./ml in<br>
positive controls among a range of individuals may be<br>
observed. A 1:200 dilution of plasma for all samples is<br>
usually sufficient for experiments for ELISA results to fall<br>
on the linear range of the ELISA standard curves. It may be<br>
necessary to optimize standard dilutions if you observe<br>
differences in the whole blood assay. Nerad, J.L. et al., J.<br>
