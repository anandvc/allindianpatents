				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved screen for uniformly feeding    relatively large coke lumps into a crushing machine.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to a screen in which the metallic rods disposed parallelly along the length of an existing screen are arranged diverging with respect to the central longitudinal line from the receiving end to the delivery end thereof.<br>
Wharf cokes obtained from a coke oven contain coke lumps of various sizes, are carried over conveyor belts and allowed to drop from the delivery end of the belts onto the receiving end of an inclined screen via a chute.    A conventional screen is formed of a number of parallelly disposed metallic rods of typical diameter 40 mm along the length of the same having a typical gap of 80 mm between the adjacent rods,  so that the coke lumps of size smaller than 80 mm fall underneath the screen and those of size larger than 80 mm move downward over the inclined screen and fall from the delivery end of the screen into the gap between the two toothed rolls of a crushing machine which is disposed parallelly to the width of the screen below the delivery end thereof for crushing the same into coke lumps of size smaller than 80 mm.<br>
The chute used for transferring the coke lumps from the delivery end of the conveyor belts to the receiving end of the screen being of width converging towards the screen,  the distribution of coke lumps across the screen width is non-uniform, being concentrated at the central part thereof before<br><br>
the coke lumps are  delivered onto the  crushing machine.     The said rods being parallelly disposed along the  length of the existing screen the  non-uniformity  in the distribution of coke lumps is maintained at  the delivery end of the  screen.     As a result most of the  crushing action on coke lumps  is performed at the  central part only of the  two toothed rolls of the  crushing machine,   causing thereby a rapid wearing of the  teeth there and much reduced wearing of the teeth lying at the two end parts of the  toothed rolls,   requiring replacement of the toothed rolls of the crushing machine after a relatively short period and hence increasing the  cost of maintenance of the crushing machine appreciably.<br>
The objective of the present invention is  to provide a screen by using which the non-uniformity of coke lump distribution across  the width of the screen is removed to a large extent before  delivery of the same into the  crushing machine and thereby the working life  of the  toothed rolls of the crushing machine is extended appreciably because  of uniform wearing of teeth of the rolls over almost the entire length thereof.<br>
Thus  the  invention provides an improved screen for uniformly feeding relatively large coke lumps into  the gap between the  two  toothed rolls of a crushing machine,   the  screen comprising a number of metallic rods lying along the length and a number of parallelly disposed metallic rods lying across the width of the screen,   characterised in that  the  said rods lying along the length are divergent With respect to  the central longitudinal line  from the  receiving end to the delivery end of the screen,  and that all<br><br>
joints of the rods forming the screen are made by welding.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly without restricting its scope in any manner with reference to the accompanying drawings in which -<br>
Figure 1 shows a sketch of a device having an existing screen for crushing relatively large coke lumps;<br>
Figure 2 shows a plan view of the invented screen for use in the device shown in Fig. 1 in replacement of the existing screen.<br>
Referring to Fig.  1, the existing screen (1) comprises parallelly disposed rods (1A) lying along the length and parallelly disposed rods (1B) lying across the width of the screen, and is mounted with its receiving end (1C) lying below the delivery end (2B) of chute (2) and its delivery end (1D) lying above the gap (4A) between the two toothed rolls (4) of a crushing machine.    The receiving end (2A) of chute (2) is placed below the delivery end (3A) of the conveyor belt (3) carrying coke lumps (5) from a coke oven (not shown).    The directions of the movement of coke lumps in the system are indicated by arrows.    The width of chute (2) is convergent from its receiving end (2A) to its delivery end (2B).<br>
Referring to Fig. 2 the invented screen (1â€™) comprises a number of rods (1'A) lying along its length, which are divergent with respect to the central longitudinal line (1'B) from the receiving end (1'C) to the delivery end (1'D) of the screen and a number of rods (1'B) lying along the width of the<br><br>
screen, which are parallel to one another like those of the existing screen.  The constructional parameters of the particular embodiment of the invented screen (11) shown in Fig. 2 are presented in Table I.  The rods used may be of circular, rectangular or square cross section.  In the case of rods of rectangular or square cross section, the sharp corners are rounded off.<br>
Comparative performance of the existing and the invented screens has been studied in a steel plant over a period.  It has been observed that the working life of the toothed rolls of the crushing machine is extended from 3-4 months as obtained by using the existing screen to 5-6 months by using the invented screen.<br>
The proportion by weight of coke lumps of size larger than 100 ram has been found to be around 70% after crushing by using the invented screen as against around 35% by using the existing screen, showing thereby an appreciable increase in the crushing efficiency of the machine attained by using the invented screen.<br><br>

(ii) Width 	 1480 mm<br>
