				<td>PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL DETERMINATION OF CHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
This invention relates to a new method for determining oxygen demand of<br>
water using photoelectrochemical cells. In particular, the invention relates to a<br>
i new photoelectrochemical method of determining chemical oxygen demand of<br>
water samples using a titanium dioxide nanoparticulate semiconductive electrode.<br>
Background To The Invention<br>
Nearly all domestic and industrial wastewater effluents contain organic<br>
compounds, which can cause detrimental oxygen depletion (or demand) in<br>
waterways into which the effluents are released. This demand is due largely to the<br>
oxidative biodegradation of organic compounds by naturally occurring<br>
microorganisms, which utilize the organic material as a food source. In this<br>
process, carbon is oxidised to carbon dioxide, while oxygen is consumed and<br>
reduced to water.<br>
Standard analytical methodologies for the determination of aggregate<br>
properties such as oxygen demand in water are biochemical oxygen demand<br>
(BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). BOD involves the use of<br>
heterotrophic microorganisms to oxidise organic material and thus estimate<br>
oxygen demand. COD uses strong oxidising agents, such as dichromate or<br>
permanganate, to oxidise organic material. BOD analysis is carried out over five<br>
days and oxygen demand determined by titration or with an oxygen probe. COD<br>
measures dichromate or permanganate depletion by titration or<br>
spectrophotometry.<br>
Despite their widespread use for estimating oxygen demand, both BOD and<br>
COD methodologies have serious technological limitations. Both methods are time<br>
consuming and very expensive, costing water industries and local authorities in<br>
excess of $1 billion annually worldwide. Other problems with the BOD assay<br>
include: limited linear working range; complicated, time consuming procedures;<br>
and questionable accuracy and reproducibility (the standard method accepts a<br>
relative standard deviation of Â±15% for replicate BOD5 analyses). More<br>
importantly, interpretation of BOD results is difficult since the results tend to be<br>
specific to the body of water in question', depend on the pollutants in the sample<br>
solution and the nature of the microbial seed used. In addition, the BOD<br>
methodologies cannot be used to assess the oxygen demand for many heavily<br>
polluted water bodies because of inhibitory and toxic effects of pollutants on the<br>
heterotropic bacteria.<br>
The COD method is more rapid and less variable than the BOD method and<br>
thus preferred for assessing the oxygen demand of organic pollutants in heavily<br>
polluted water bodies. Despite this, the method has several drawbacks in that it is<br>
time consuming, requiring 2-4 hours to reflux samples, and utilises expensive (e.g.<br>
Ag2SO4), corrosive (e.g. concentrated H2SO4) and highly toxic (Hg(ll) and Cr(VI))<br>
reagents. The use of toxic reagents being of particular environmental concern,<br>
leading to the Cr(VI) method being abandoned in Japan.<br>
Titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2) has been extensively used in photooxidation of<br>
organic compounds. T1O2 is non-photocorrosive, non-toxic, inexpensive, relatively<br>
easily synthesised in its highly catalytic nanoparticulate form, and is highly efficient<br>
in photooxidative degradation of organic compounds.<br>
Fox MA and Tien, T, Anal. Chem, (60 1988) 2278-2282 investigated the<br>
development of a photoelectrochemical detector by employing an anodically<br>
formed TiO2 electrode for use in high-pressure liquid chromatography. This<br>
photoelectrochemical detector is reported as being sensitive to oxidisable<br>
organics, such as alcohols. The electrode system developed by Fox et al had low<br>
photocatalytic efficiency of the system and is difficult to use as it cannot<br>
discriminate between the respective currents generated from the oxidation of water<br>
and organic matter.<br>
Brown, G.N., etal., Anal. Chem, 64 (1992) 427-434 investigated the use of<br>
a photoelectrochemical detector by employing a thermally formed TiO2 electrode<br>
for use as a detector in flow injection analysis and liquid chromatography. The<br>
detector was found to be non-selective in its response to a variety of organic<br>
analytes. Brown et al found that the response of the detector varied with<br>
temperature, duration of heating, oxidative atmosphere, etching of the titanium<br>
wire electrode, amount of doping on the TiO2 detector and solvents. Similar to Fox<br>
et al this electrode system had low photocatalytic efficiency and cannot<br>
discriminate between the currents generated from the oxidation of water and<br>
organic matter.<br>
Matthews R.W. et ai., Analytica Chimica Acta 233 (1990) 171-179 (also the<br>
subject of Australian patent 597165) utilised a TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation system<br>
to determine total carbon in water samples, by placing T1O2 into a slurry or<br>
suspension, photooxidising the organic material with in the sample to evolve<br>
carbon dioxide (CO2). The evolved CO2 was measured to predict TOC value of<br>
the sample. Matthews found that the total organic carbon can be estimated from<br>
the total amount of carbon dioxide purged from photocatalytic cell.<br>
Jiang D. et al., J. Photochem &amp; Photobio A: Chemistry 144 (2001) 197-204 also<br>
investigated the photoelectrochemica! behaviour of nanoporous TiO2 film<br>
electrodes in the photooxidation of methanol. Jiang found that the photocurrent<br>
response of the electrode was greatly influenced by applied potential, light<br>
intensity, methanol concentration and pH. A linear relationship was found to exist<br>
between the photocurrent produced through the photo-oxidation of methanol and<br>
the concentration of methanol in the sample. However, as concentration of<br>
methano! increased the migration of photoelectrons across the TiO2 film and<br>
therefore photogenerated charge separation becomes a rate-limiting step, thus<br>
limiting the working range in which the linear relationship between photocurrent<br>
and concentration occurs.<br>
Lee Kyong-Hoon et al., Electroanalysis 12, No 16 (2000) 1334-1338,<br>
investigated the determination of COD using a microfabricated Clark-type oxygen<br>
electrode and TiO2 fine particles suspended in a sample solution under<br>
photocatalytic oxidative degradation conditions. The current generated from the<br>
oxygen electrode under -800mV applied potential was used to indicate the oxygen<br>
concentration change before and after the photooxidation. The change in oxygen<br>
concentration was then correlated to COD value of the sample.<br>
Kim, Yoon-Chang, et a!., Anal. Chem, 72 (2000) 3379-3382; Analytica<br>
Chimica Acta 432 (2001) 59-66 and Anal. Chem, 74 (2002) 3858-3864 all relate to<br>
the determination of COD using a photocatalytic oxidative degradation of organic<br>
compounds at a titanium dioxide particles, in Anal Chem, 2000, Kim et al<br>
investigated the use of translucent poly(tetrafluroethylene) (PTFE) membrane<br>
having fine particles of TIO2 absorbed or entrapped onto the surface of the<br>
membrane in combining with a oxygen electrode as a possible COD sensor. The<br>
immobilised TiO2 particles serve as an oxidation reagent and the analytical<br>
signal was based on the oxygen concentration measurements between the<br>
working and reference oxygen electrodes.<br>
Calibration curves where established using sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), prior to<br>
determining COD of analytes. In this study Kim et al reports that the membrane<br>
sensor did not show good reproducibility.<br>
In Anaiytica Chimica Acta 432 (2001) 59-66, Kim et al invest/gated the use<br>
of titanium dioxide (TiO2) beads in a photochemical column and an oxygen<br>
electrode as the sensor in determining dissolved oxygen from the photocatalytic<br>
oxidation of organic compound and thus the COD value of the analyte.<br>
In Anal. Chem, 74 (2002) 3858-3864Kim et a! investigated the use of<br>
0.6mm TiO2 beads in a quartz tube in the determination of oxygen consumption<br>
from photochemical oxidation of organic compounds and subsequent calculation of<br>
COD values from the difference in the currents recorded at the reference and<br>
working oxygen electrodes.<br>
The methods described by Lee et a! and Kim et ai above all utilise TiO2 as<br>
an oxidative reagent to replace the traditional reagent used in COD such as<br>
chromate salts, with the analytical signal being obtained via two traditional oxygen<br>
electrodes. There are many disadvantages of their method, which makes the<br>
practical application of the method very difficult.<br>
To date the COD assay methodologies of the prior art are indirect in their<br>
analysis methods requiring calibration and often suffer from having low sensitivity,<br>
poor accuracy, narrow linear working ranges and/or difficult to operate. More<br>
importantly, these prior art COD assay methodologies are matrix dependent due to<br>
the low oxidation efficiency, it is an object of this invention to overcome these<br>
shortcomings.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
To this end this invention provides a method of determining chemical<br>
oxygen demand of a water sample, comprising the steps of<br>
a) applying a constant potential bias to a photoelectrochemical ce!J, having<br>
a photoactive working electrode and a counter electrode, and containing a<br>
supporting electrolyte solution;<br>
b) illuminating the working electrode with a light source, preferably a UV<br>
light source, and recording the background photocurrent produced at the working<br>
electrode from the supporting electrolyte solution;<br>
c) adding a water sample, to be analysed, to the photoelectrochemical cell;<br>
d) illuminating the working electrode with a UV light source and recording<br>
the total photocurrent produced;<br>
e) determining the chemical oxygen demand of the water sample<br>
according to the type of degradation conditions employed.<br>
The working electrode may be formed from any nanoparticulate<br>
semiconductive material capable of photooxidation of organic compounds. The<br>
nanoparticulate semiconductive electrode may be selected from titanium dioxide,<br>
niobium pentoxide, strontium titanate, indium trioxide, calcium titanate, tungsten<br>
trioxide, barium titanate, ferric oxide, zinc oxide, potassium tantalate, tin dioxide,<br>
cadmium oxide, hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide, tantalum pentoxide, chromium<br>
trioxide or yttrium trioxide. Preferably the semiconductive electrode is titanium<br>
dioxide. More preferably the semiconductive electrode is formed by laying<br>
nanoparticles of titanium dioxide on an inert substrate, such as conducting glass.<br>
This invention is partly predicated on the insight that the methods described<br>
in the prior art, utilising photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 nanoparticle<br>
semiconductive electrodes provide for the direct determination of COD. In the<br>
prior art method, the method relies for accuracy on the two oxygen electrodes,<br>
which have to be identical in responding to the oxygen change. In addition, the<br>
prior art method cannot be used for low COD samples due to the insufficient<br>
sensitivity of the method. Low COD content is important in testing water for<br>
suitability in drinking and cleaning applications. By using this technique the<br>
measurement of milliamperes of current allows much greater sensitivity in the low<br>
COD range.<br>
The method of determining the chemical oxygen demand value of a water<br>
sample may be determined under exhaustive degradation conditions, in which all<br>
organics present in the water sample are oxidised. Under exhaustive degradation<br>
conditions the chemical oxygen demand value can be obtained according to the<br>
steps of;<br>
a) integrating both the background photocurrent and total photocurrent<br>
(ji(1)) to give the background charge and total charge, and subtracting the<br>
background charge from the total charge to determine the net charge Qnet;<br>
for the water sample; and<br>
b) calculating the chemical oxygen demand value utilising formula (I);<br><br>
The method of determining the chemical oxygen demand value of a water<br>
sample may be determined under non-exhaustive degradation conditions, in which<br>
the organics present in the water sample are partially oxidised. Under non-<br>
exhaustive degradation conditions, all photocurrent are measured under the<br>
diffusion controlled conditions and the method of determining oxygen demand<br>
value may further include the steps of;<br>
adding a standard solution, having known organic concentration or chemical<br>
oxygen demand value, to the photoelectrochemical cell containing the water<br>
sample to be analysed;<br>
illuminating working electrode with a UV light source and recording the<br>
limiting photocurrent produced from the partial oxidative degradation of the<br>
standard solution (il(2)); and<br>
determining the chemical oxygen demand value by;<br>
a) calculating the current for the water sample by subtracting the<br>
limiting background photocurrent (iibackgmund)from the limiting photocurrent of the<br>
sample (il(1)) at a predetermined illumination time according to the formula<br><br>
b) calculating the limiting photocurrent for the standard solution by<br>
subtracting the background photocurrent (ibackground) from the limiting photocurrent<br>
of the sample and standard (il(2)) at the predetermined illumination time according<br>
to the formula:<br>
The method steps for both the exhaustive and non-exhaustive degradation<br>
condition may be repeated as many times as required to analyse all necessary<br>
&gt; water samples.<br>
The potential bias applied to the electrodes is preferably between -0.1V and<br>
+0.5V. More preferably the potential difference is between approximately +0.15V<br>
and +0.35V.<br>
A supporting electrolyte is used to determine the background photocurrent<br>
and to dilute the water sample to be tested. The determination of the background<br>
photocurrent measures the oxidation of water and this can be deducted from the<br>
sample reading to give the photocurrent due to the oxidation of organic material in<br>
the sample. This measurement may be made as a separate measurement to the<br>
sample reading or when conducting an exhaustive degradation the final steady<br>
current after the oxidation is completed is a measure of the background photo<br>
current. The supporting electrolyte may be selected from sodium nitrate, sodium<br>
perchlorate or any other electrolytes that are electrochemically and<br>
photoelectrochemically stable under the experimental conditions and do not<br>
absorb UV radiation in the range being used. The dilution of the samples<br>
enables the method to have a wide linear range while still keeping the test duration<br>
to a relatively small period.<br>
The water sample is preferably illuminated by a light source having a photo<br>
intensity of between between 1 and 100 mWcm-2. More preferably the frequency<br>
of the light source is between approximately 6 - 9,5mWcm-2.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a photoelectrochemica)<br>
assay apparatus for determining oxygen demand of a water sample which consists<br>
of<br>
a) a measuring cell for holding a sample to be analysed<br>
b) a photoactive working electrode and a counter electrode disposed in<br>
said cell,<br>
c) a light source, preferably a UV light source, adapted to illuminate the<br>
photoactive working electrode<br>
d) control means to control the illumination of the working electrode, the<br>
applied potential and signal measurement<br>
e) current measuring means to measure the photocurrent at the working<br>
and counter electrodes<br>
f) analysis means to derive a measure of oxygen demand from the<br>
measurements made by the photocurrent measuring means.<br>
Preferably a reference electrode is also located in the measuring cell and the<br>
working electrode is a nanoparticulate semiconductive electrode preferably<br>
titanium dioxide.<br>
In other embodiments the measuring cell may be a stationary cell with different<br>
ceil geometry and volume, or a flow through cell with different cell geometry and<br>
volume, and with a flow rate adjusted to optimise the sensitivity of the<br>
measurements.<br><br>

Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
The preferred assay method of the invention takes advantage of the highly<br>
efficient photochemical properties of TiO2 nanoparticulate fiim electrodes to<br>
develop a new, rapid, cost-effective assay for the determination of aggregate<br>
organic properties, such as oxygen demand and in particular COD.<br>
This embodiment is directed to a method of determining chemical oxygen<br>
demand of water samples utilising a nanoparticulate TiO2 film electrode. It will be<br>
appreciated by the person skilled in the art that other nanoparticulate<br>
semiconductive film electrode may be utilised in the method without departing from<br>
the essence of the invention.<br>
The assay method of the invention allows for easy quantification of electron<br>
transfer at a TiO2 nanoparticle film electrode during photocatalytic oxidative<br>
degradation of organic material. This approach overcomes many of the current<br>
problems with existing oxygen demand techniques.<br>
The photocatalytic oxidation approach for COD determination utilizes TiO2<br>
particles as photocatalyst to replace the traditional oxidizing agent, e.g. dichromate<br>
and permanganate, illumination of TiO2, with photons whose energy is equal to or<br>
greater than the band-gap energy, will result in promotion of an electron from the<br>
valence band to the conduction band (see Fig. 1). This promotes an electron (e-)<br>
to the conduction band and leaves a positive photohole (h+) in the valence band.<br>
The photohole is one of the most powerful oxidizers due to its high bandgap<br>
potential (+3.2V for anatase). The photocatalysis can lead to stoichiometric<br>
mineralization of organic compounds due to the strong oxidation power of<br>
photoholes.<br>
MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION<br>
The method of determining chemical oxygen demand of water samples,<br>
according to the invention, utilises photoelectrochemical current (or charge)<br>
generated from photoeiectrochemical oxidative degradation of organic compounds<br>
as an analytical signal.<br>
The photocatalytic degradation efficiency at TiO2 depends on the degree of<br>
recombination of photoeiectrons and holes. With traditional TiO2 photocatalysis<br>
systems, this relies on how fast the photoeiectrons and holes are consumed by the<br>
adsorbed species.<br>
A TiO2 nanoparticulate film electrode is used as the working electrode in a<br>
three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell. By applying an appropriate potential<br>
bias to the working electrode, it becomes more favourable for the photoelectron to<br>
be transferred to the working electrode rather than to the adsorbed O2. The<br>
photoeiectrons are subsequently forced to pass into the external circuit and to the<br>
counter electrode, where the reduction of oxygen (or other species) takes place.<br>
The photocurrent (or charge) is monitored and gives a direct measure of the<br>
oxidation of organic compounds. In effect the assay shunts photoeiectrons<br>
through the external circuit to quantify the extent of oxidative degradation.<br>
Separation of the oxidative and reductive half-reactions (Eqn.s 1 and 2,<br>
below) by imposing the electrochemical potential suppresses the recombination of<br>
photoelectrons and holes. As a result, the degradation efficiency is enhanced.<br>
In addition it has been found that the rate of degradation of organic materials is<br>
independent of O2 concentration as the rate of reduction at the counter electrode<br>
will never be the rate-limiting step of the overall degradation process. Thus<br>
overcoming the prior art problem of oxygen reduction being a rate-limiting step in<br>
the photooxidation of organic material.<br>
Quantification of analytical signal<br>
The photoelectrochemical system described above can be used for two different<br>
degradation models - exhaustive and non-exhaustive degradation. With<br>
exhaustive degradation, 100% of the organic analyte in the sample is consumed;<br>
with non-exhaustive degradation, only a small fraction of available analyte is<br>
consumed and its concentration in the bulk solution remains essentially<br>
unchanged. The former is analogous to bulk electrolysis in which all of the anaiyte<br>
is electrolysed and Faraday's Law is used to quantify the concentration by<br>
measuring the charge passed; the latter is analogous to amperometric methods<br>
where the analytical signal (i.e. current) is dependent on the rate of mass transfer<br>
to the electrode surface. In our case, however, the charge/current produced is the<br>
result of photoelectrochemical processes.<br>
When the exhaustive degradation mode! is employed, the charge (Q) can<br>
be measured by the integration of photocurrent within the degradation period. The<br>
analytical principle can be established using Faraday's Law:<br>
Q = idt =nFN = nFVC (3)<br>
where: N = number of moles of analyte in the sample,<br>
n = number of electrons transferred during the photo- electrochemical<br>
degradation,<br>
F = Faraday constant,<br>
V= sample volume; and<br>
C = analyte concentration.<br>
Since TiO2 oxidises organic compounds to the fully oxidised form of carbon<br>
(i.e. CO2), the value n for a given compound will be a constant. Eqn 3 can<br>
therefore be used to quantify the anaiyte concentration.<br>
In principal, analytically useful photocurrents (or charge) can be obtained<br>
from any photo-electrochemically degradable species. The TiO2 system proposed<br>
is capable of oxidising nearly any organic or low redox state inorganic species (e.g.<br>
Fe2+, Cl-, NH4+, NO2-) In this respect, the proposed system can be employed as a<br>
"universal" detector capable of detecting any compounds that can be<br>
photoelectrochemically oxidised at a TiO2 electrode. In combination with an<br>
appropriate separation system (e.g. HPLC), the concentration of individual<br>
analytes can be determined.<br>
In terms of general water quality issues and pollution control, the effect and<br>
quantification of aggregate mixtures of organics (such as in COD or BOD analysis)<br>
are often more important than the analysis of single species. The proposed<br>
photoelectrochemical system is capable of determining such aggregate properties<br>
by summing the charge measured from individual photo-electrochemically<br>
degradable compounds within a mixture (Eqn 4).<br><br>
The measured charge, Q, is simply the total amount of electron transfer that<br>
results from the degradation of all compounds in the sample. Given that oxidation<br>
by O2 can be represented as:<br><br>
where one oxygen molecule is equivalent to 4 electrons, the measured Q value<br>
can be easily converted into an equivalent O2 concentration (or oxygen demand)<br>
value:<br><br>
For exhaustive degradation, the equivalent COD value of the sample can<br>
therefore be represented as:<br><br>
in the case of non-exhaustive degradation, the quantitative relationship<br>
between the photocurrent and the concentration of the analyte can be developed<br>
using a well-known semi-empirical treatment of Steady-State Mass Transfer [A. J.<br>
Bard and L R. Faulkner, Electrochemical Methods-Fundamental and Applications.<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York. 2001], Under conditions of forced convection,<br>
the rate of mass transfer (dN/df) to an electrode is directly proportional to the<br>
concentration gradient at the electrode surface.<br><br>
where, Cb, - concentration of analyte in the bulk solution;<br>
Cs = concentration of analyte at the electrode surface;<br>
k = mass-transfer coefficient [A. J. Bard and L. R. Faulkner,<br>
Electrochemical Methods-Fundamental and Applications. John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
Inc. New York. 2001] which is = D/5, where D = diffusion coefficient and 5 =<br>
thickness of stagnant layer.<br>
When sufficient photo intensity and adequate potential bias are employed,<br>
and the overall process is controlled by mass transfer, then, Cs(x=0)
[Cb-Cs(x=0)3ËCb, The maximum rate of mass transfer, (dN/dt)i is achieved and the<br>
rate of overall reaction equals:<br><br>
If we again assume that after photochemical oxidation the analyte is fully<br>
oxidised, then the number of electrons transferred (n) during photoelectrochemical<br>
degradation is a constant, for a given analyte. The limiting photocurrent (il) can,<br>
therefore, be used to represent the rate of reaction:<br><br>
where A = active electrode area.<br>
The development of equation 10, by the current inventors, leads to definition<br>
of the quantitative relationship between the limiting photocurrent and the<br>
concentration of analyte and can be regarded as the principle of analysis.<br>
This analytical principle can again be applied to determine concentrations of<br>
individual analytes (and serve as a "universal" detection system) or to aggregate<br>
mixtures of organics (to determine properties such as COD). Whilst formula 10<br>
above may allow for the general determination of analyte concentration, it is the<br>
application of the findings from formula (10) to the determination of COD that<br>
assists in addressing one or more of the disadvantages in the prior art<br>
methodologies. Standard analytical and mathematical techniques may be used to<br>
calculate the COD of a sample from the limiting photocurrent measured in a<br>
photoelectrochemicai cell utilising a nanoparticulate TiO2 semiconductive electrode<br>
in the manner described in more detail below.<br>
METHOD OF DETERMINING COD<br>
FORMATION OF TiO2 ELECTRODE<br>
A) Synthesis of TiO2 Colloid<br>
A1) A mixture of 12.5ml titanium butoxide and 4ml isopropyl alcohol was added,<br>
drop-wise, to 150ml 0,1 M nitric acid solution under vigorous stirring at room<br>
temperature. After the hydrolysis the slurry was heated to 80Â°C and stirred for 8h<br>
to achieve peptization. The colloid is then filtered to remove the nonpeptized<br>
agglomerates. For better crystallinity of the nanoparticles, the colloid was<br>
hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 200Â°C for 12h. During the autoclaving<br>
sedimentation occurred, and the particles were redispersed by sonication. The<br>
particle size is in the range of 8 to 10nm as characterised by transmission electron<br>
microscopy (TEM). Water was used to adjust the final solid concentration to ca.<br>
6% (wt) and carbowax 20M (Merck) was added to the colloid in a proportion of 1 -<br>
50% of the TiO2 weight. The colloid thus obtained was used for the preparation<br>
T/O2 nanoporous film electrode.<br>
A2) A 16.0 cm3 of isopropanol (Aldrich, AR grade) and 50.0 cm3 of titanium<br>
butoxide (Aldrich, AR grade) were accurately measured into a 150 cm3 dropping<br>
funnel. The resulting solution was added over 15 minutes with vigorous stirring to<br>
600 cm3 of ultrapure deionized water (18.2 M? cm) in a conical flask. On the<br>
completion of the addition, 4.0 cm3 of 70% nitric acid (AR grade) was added into<br>
the solution as a peptizing agent. The solution was immersed in a hot water<br>
bath, heated to 80Â°C and stirred continuously for 10 hours. Approximately 400<br>
cm3 of a white colloidal solution remained and was stored in a dark glass vessel for<br>
use. The sizes of the TiO2 synthesised according to this procedure were in a<br>
range of 8 to 10 nm.<br>
The colloidal TiO2 prepared above was placed in an autoclave reactor (Parr<br>
bomb) and autociaved for 12 hours at 200Â°C before concentrating on a rotary<br>
evaporator to 8% (w/w), resulting in a white semi-viscous colloidal solution. 40%<br>
TiC&gt;2 weight equivalent (e.g. 1.6g in 50.0 cm3 of 8% colloidal solution) of Carbowax<br>
6,000 was added to the solution and stirred for approximately 20 minutes.<br>
B) Immobilisation of TiO2 film on ITO glass<br>
B1) ITO (tin doped iridium oxide) conducting glass slides were used as the<br>
substrate for immobilisation of TiO2 particles. To get a clean surface the ITO glass<br>
slide was pretreated by washing in turn with detergent, water, and ethanol. After<br>
the pretreatment the ITO slide was dip-coated in the above colloidal solution from<br>
Al, above. The coated slides were then calcined in a muffle furnace in air at 500 to<br>
800Â°C for 0.5h to 30h. The-particle size of TiO2 on the films characterised by x-ray<br>
diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEA/I) is in the range of 10nm to<br>
100nm and the rutile/anatase phase ratio is in the range of 0.1 to 50%.<br>
B2) TiOz films were prepared in a clean room environment to minimize<br>
contamination from dust particles. TiO2 colloidal coating solution, from A2 above,<br>
was stirred vigorously and subjected to the ultrasonic treatment for 20 minutes<br>
prior to a dtp coating process to achieve a consistent, reproducible homogeneous<br>
mixture. The ITO slide (conducting glass) was used as the electrode substrate<br>
and was pre-treated by washing in turn with detergent, water, acetone and water,<br>
and finally dried by pure nitrogen. After pre-treatment, the VTO slide was dip-<br>
coated with the TiO2 colloidal coating solution using a dip coating equipment with<br>
withdrawing speeds of 0.5 - 1.5 cm/min. The coated electrodes were then<br>
calcined in a muffle furnace at 450Â°C for 30 minutes in air. The nanoporous TiO2<br>
films with I^rn thickness and anatase crystalline structure were obtained. The<br>
films with different thicknesses can be prepared by controlling the withdrawing<br>
speed during the dip coating.<br>
C) General Setup of the Photoelectrochemical System<br>
Fig. 2 shows the schematic of the instrumental set up of the<br>
photoelectrochemical detection system. Illumination was carried out using a 150W<br>
xenon arc /amp fight source with focusing lenses (HF-200W-95, Beijing Optical<br>
Instruments). To avoid the sample solution being heated-up by infrared light, the<br>
light beam was passed an UV-band pass filter (UG 5, Avotronics Pty, Limited) prior<br>
to illumination of the electrode surface. A light shutter was used to control the ON<br>
and OFF of the illumination.<br>
Generally, photoelectrochemical experiments were performed in a three-<br>
electrode electrochemical cell with a quartz window for illumination. The TiO2 film<br>
electrode was installed in an electrode holder with ca. 0.65cm2 left unsealed to be<br>
exposed to the solution for illumination and photoelectrochemical reaction. A<br>
saturated Ag/AgCI electrode and a platinum mesh were used as the reference and<br>
counter electrodes respectively. A voltammograph (CV-27, BAS) was used for<br>
application of potential bias in steady state photocurrent measurements. Potential<br>
and current signals were recorded using a Macintosh computer (7220/200)<br>
coupled to a Maclab 400 interface (AD Instruments),<br>
D) ThÂ© measurement procedures:<br>
D1) Exhaustive degradation conditions<br>
Step 1: Once the system is set up (see Fig 2 - 6), the supporting electrolyte<br>
solution was pumped through the photoelectrochemical cell (a thin layer cell). A<br>
bias potential of +0.20 Vvs a Ag/AgCI reference electrode was applied. Once the<br>
stable baseline was obtained, the pump was stopped. The photo shutter was then<br>
switched on to allow UV radiation to reach the electrode. The photocatalytic<br>
reaction occurred and the background current-time profile can be measured (see<br>
Fig 10 curve (a)). The background current (iBackground) was resulted from the<br>
photocatalytic oxidation of water. Integrating (Background with time we can obtain the<br>
background charge, QBachkround.<br>
Step 2: After the measurement of QBachkround. the photo shutter was switched<br>
off and a 5Âµl to 200ÂµI of sample solution with appropriate concentration was<br>
injected into the photoeiectrochemical cell (It is to note that the sample volume<br>
injected is depending the volume of the cell and if the concentration of organics in<br>
the sample was too high then an appropriate dilution may be required prior the<br>
injection). Once the sample injection was completed, the pump was stopped and<br>
the photo shutter was switched on. The Current-time profile was measured (see<br>
Fig 10 curve (b)). The current obtained here is the total photocurrent (iTotal) that<br>
resulted from the oxidation of water and organics. Same to the above, by<br>
integrating itotal with time we have the total charge, Qrota.-<br>
Step 3: Since the background charge, QBackgvund, is a constant for the given<br>
experimental conditions and the total charge, QTotal, varied with the concentration of<br>
the sample, therefore, the net charge, Qnet (the shaded area shown in Fig 10) that<br>
resulted from the oxidation of organics can be obtained by subtracting the<br>
background charge from the total charge, that is:<br>
Qnet= QTotal- QBackground<br>
The COD value of the sample can then be calculated according to the equation (7)<br>
since in the equation,<br><br>
F is a constant and V is known sample volume.<br>
Repeating steps 2 and 3 to analysis next sampie.<br>
D2) Non-exhaustive degradation conditions<br>
The system set up was same as described above (see Fig 2-6) except that a<br>
normal flow-through cell was employed to replace the thin layer cell. The<br>
measurement can be done by using a standard addition method or by other<br>
calibration means.<br>
Step 1: The supporting electrolyte solution was pumped through the<br>
photoelectrochemica! cell (a normal flow-through cell with cell volume of 0.5 to 2.5<br>
ml). A bias potential of +0.20 V vs a Ag/AgCl reference electrode was applied.<br>
Once the stable baseline was obtained, the pump was stoped. The photo shutter<br>
was then switched on to allow UV radiation to reach the electrode. The<br>
photocatalytic reaction occurred and the background current-time profile can be<br>
recorded (see Fig 7 curve (a)). The background current (ibackground) was resulted<br>
from the photocatalytic oxidation of water.<br>
Step 2; After the measurement of ibackground, the photo shutter was switched<br>
off and a 0.5ml to 2.5ml of sample solution with appropriate concentration was<br>
injected into the photoelectrochemica! cell (It is to note that the sample volume<br>
injected is depending the volume of the cell and if the concentration of organics in<br>
the sample was too high then an appropriate dilution may be required prior the<br>
injection). Once the sample injection was completed, the pump was stopped and<br>
the photo shutter was switched on. The Current-time profile was recorded (see Fig<br>
7 curve (b)). The current obtained here is the total photocurrent (iTotal) that resulted<br>
from the oxidation of water and organics.<br>
Step 3: Once the measurement of iTotal was completed, the photo shutter was<br>
switched off and a 0.5ml to 2.5ml of sample solution containing an appropriate<br>
concentration of standard was injected into the photoelectrochemical cell. Once<br>
the sample injection was completed, the pump was stopped and the photo shutter<br>
was switched on. The current-time profile was recorded (see Fig 7 curve (c)). The<br>
current obtained here is the photocurrent (istandard) that resulted from the oxidation<br>
of water and the organics in both original sample and the added standard.<br>
Step 4: After the above measurements, the COD of the sample can be<br>
calculated according to the equation (10).<br>
The limiting current for each case (/l background, il(1) and il(2)), can be obtained<br>
by measuring the steady current value from each curve, for example, at 45s (see<br>
Figure 5). The net limiting photocurrents for the sample solution (/;(1)) and for the<br>
sample with added standard (/,(2)) can then be calculated.<br>
Net limiting photocurrents (or current) for the sample solution:<br><br>
Net limiting photocurrents (or current) for the sample with standard:<br><br>
According to equation (10), above, we have:<br>
Repeat the steps 2 to 4 for the next sample.<br>
It will be appreciated by the person skilled in the art that the necessary<br>
computations set out above may be automated with the appropriate programming<br>
of a personal computer.<br>
There are a few operational modes with different photoelectrochemica)<br>
reactor designs (i.e. online thin-layer flow cell, and batch cell) that utilise the assay<br>
methodology and are demonstrated by following examples.<br>
Example 1: Quantification of COD using photocurreni<br>
The photoelectrochemical experiment was performed in a three-electrode<br>
electrochemical batch cell with a quartz window for illumination as shown in Fig. 3<br>
The TiO2 film electrode was placed in an electrode holder with ca. 0.65cm2 left<br>
unsealed to be exposed to the solution for illumination and photoelectrochemical<br>
reaction. 0.1M NaNO3 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte. A potential<br>
bias of +0.2V was applied at the electrode and limiting photocurrents were<br>
obtained for different organic compound concentrations when the current reached<br>
steady state. The limiting photocurrent differences between samples and the<br>
blank 0.1M NaNO3 solution were taken as analytical signals, which are directly<br>
linear to organic compound concentrations within diffusion control, A linear<br>
relationship between the analytical signal and COD value was then acquired after<br>
the concentration was converted into COD value.<br>
Example 2. Quantification of COD using charges<br>
In this case the experiment was carried out in a thin-layer<br>
photoelectrochemical cell as shown in Figures 4 and 5. A potential bias of<br>
+0.20V was applied and 2M NaNO3 was used as supporting electrolyte. Firstly, a<br>
2M NaNO3 electrolyte solution was injected into the thin-layer<br>
photoelectrochemica! cell with a syringe and a blank transient photoelectrolysis<br>
was run as a blank sample. The photocurrent-time profile was recorded until the<br>
photocurrent reached steady state. Then samples containing organic compounds<br>
and 2M NaNO3 were injected into the thin-layer cell and the sample transient<br>
photoelectrolysis was run. The photocurrent-time profile was recorded until the<br>
photocurrent attained steady state, indicating the organic compounds have been<br>
exhaustively photoelectrolysed. The cell was washed with supporting electrolyte<br>
solution between each sample injection. Integrating the photocurrent-time profile<br>
gives the photocatalytic oxidation charge. The charge difference between sample<br>
and blank transient photoelectrolysis was taken as the analytical signal, which is<br>
directly proportional to the COD value. COD value was then determined.<br>
Example 3. Quantification of COD using charges and FIA<br>
Besides the use of the thin-layer photoelectrochemicai cell, a flow injection<br>
analysis (FIA) system was incorporated into the COD determination. With the<br>
combination of FIA, automatic COD determination was realised. In this case, the<br>
injection of samples and cell cleaning was controlled by a FIA controlling system<br>
as shown in Fig. 6 (a). Pump 1 achieves the blank sample (R1) injection and cell<br>
cleaning while Pump 2 does the sample injection (R2). A potential bias of +0.20V<br>
was applied and 2M NaNO3 was used as supporting electrolyte (blank sample). .<br>
Firstly, a 2M NaNO3 electrolyte solution was pumped into the thin-layer<br>
photoelectrochemical cell by Pump 1 and a blank transient photoelectrolysis was<br>
run as a blank sample. The photocurrent-time profile was recorded until the<br>
photocurrent reached steady state. Then samples containing organic compounds<br>
and 2M NaNO3 were pumped into the thin-layer cell by Pump 2 and the sample<br>
transient photoelectrolysis was run. The photocurrent-time profile was recorded<br>
until the photocurrent attained steady state, indicating the organic compounds<br>
have been exhaustively photoelectrolysed. The cell was washed with supporting<br>
electrolyte solution by Pump 1 between each sample. Integrating the<br>
photocurrent-time profile gives the photocatalytic oxidation charge. The charge.<br>
difference between sample and blank transient photoelectrolysis was taken as the<br>
analytical signal, which is directly proportional to the COD value. COD<br>
value was then determined.<br>
Example 4. Quantification of COD using continuous flow mode<br>
Besides the use of the thin-layer photoelectrochemicai cell, a flow injection<br>
analysis (FIA) system was incorporated into the COD determination with a<br>
continuous flow operational mode. With the combination of FIA, automatic COD<br>
determination was realised. In this case, the injection of samples and cell cleaning<br>
was controlled by a FIA controlling system as shown in Fig. 6(b). The blank<br>
sample is continuously pumping through the cell and an injector is employed for<br>
the sample injection. A potential bias of +0.20V was applied and 2M NaNO3 was<br>
used as supporting electrolyte (blank sample). Recording the photocurrent from<br>
the photocatalysis of the blank sample gives a steady baseline. An injection of<br>
sample containing organic compounds through the injector to allow the<br>
photocatalysis of sample takes place. The peak shaped photocurrent-time profile<br>
can be recorded until the photocurrent attained baseline, indicating the organic<br>
compounds have been photoefecfrolysed. The next samp/e can then be injected<br>
for analysis. GOD value of the sample can be determined by measuring either<br>
peak height or peak area (by integrating the peak photocurrent) since both peak<br>
height and peak area are directly proportional to the COD value.<br>
Typical experimental results<br>
Fig 8 shows a typical photocurrent-time curve obtained from a non-<br>
exhaustive photoeiectrochemica! degradation process. Under a constant applied<br>
potential, when the light was switched off, the residual current (dark current) was<br>
approximately zero. Upon illumination, the current increased rapidly before<br>
decaying to a steady state value. This steady state current (limiting photocurrent)<br>
consists of two current components. One is due to mass transfer limited<br>
photoelectrochemicai oxidation (degradation) of the target analyte, which is directly<br>
proportional to the concentration of the analyte. The other is due to the<br>
photoelectrochemicai oxidation (decomposition) of water, which is constant at a<br>
given pH and supporting electrolyte concentration. The net limiting photocurrent,<br>
il, (resulting from analyte oxidation) can be readily obtained by subtraction of the<br>
photocurrent attributed to the oxidation of water from the total photocurrent.<br>
can then be used for analytical purposes (Eqn 10).<br>
Preliminary results obtained from a range of organic compounds indicate<br>
that Equation 10 is applicable to all compounds investigated (see Fig. 9, in which 1<br>
= p-chlorophenol; 2 = potassium hydrogen phthalate; 3 = methanol; 4 = d-giucose;<br>
5 = malonic acid; 6 = succinic acid; 7 = glutaric acid; 8 = glycine). As predicted, //<br>
was found to be directly proportional to the concentration of the organic compound.<br>
The slopes of the il-C curves (sensitivity) are determined by the mass transfer<br>
coefficient (k) and the number of electrons transferred (n) during the<br>
photoelectrochemical degradation.<br>
The photocurrent-time profile of an exhaustive photoelectrochemical<br>
degradation process was found to be similar to that of the non-exhaustive<br>
degradation process except that a steady state photocurrent can only be achieved<br>
when all of the organic compounds were consumed. In this case, the steady state<br>
photocurrent was purely due to the oxidation of water and can be easily subtracted<br>
from the total current (Fig. 10). Figure 10 shows the typical photocurrent - time<br>
profiles obtained from the electrodes during an exhaustive photoelectrochemical<br>
degradation process in phthalic acid and in blank electrolyte solutions. It can be<br>
seen that the photocurrent decayed with time and then reached a steady value,<br>
which was due to the oxidation of water. It is noted that the blank photocurrent<br>
obtained from the blank electrolyte solution was purely due to the oxidation of<br>
water, while the photocurrent obtained from the electrode in phthalic acid solution<br>
consists of two current components, one is due to photoelectrochemical oxidation<br>
of phthalic acid, and the other is due to the oxidation of water, which is the same<br>
as the blank photocurrent. Our experimental results showed that the blank<br>
photocurrent was essentially constant for the given set of experimental conditions.<br>
For a given time period, the charge passed for both cases can be obtained by<br>
integration of the photocurrent and blank photocurrent. The charge difference<br>
between the two cases is the net charge, Q, due to the photoelectrochemical<br>
oxidation of phthalic acid, which is indicated as the shaded area in Fig 10. The net<br>
charge, Q, was measured by integration of net photocurrent within the degradation<br>
period as described in Fig 10. As predicted by Eqn. 3, Q is directly proportional to<br>
concentration (see Fig. 11). In this case, the slopes of the Q-C curves<br>
(sensitivity) were dependent only on the number of electrons transferred (n). The<br>
results in Fig. 9 and 11 (having conformed to theory) demonstrated the possibility<br>
of further developing the proposed system into a "universal" detection system for<br>
individual analytes.<br>
The possibility of applying the proposed method for determining aggregate<br>
properties such as COD was also tested. We chose the APHA COD standard test<br>
solution (potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP)) and a synthetic mixture with known<br>
COD values as our test solutions. Fig 12 shows the correlation between the<br>
experimental COD values (according to equation 7) and standard COD values.<br>
Excellent agreements between the two COD values were obtained in both cases.<br>
Example 5<br>
Real Waste water Samples.<br>
Fourteen (14) different wastewater samples were collected from various<br>
industries in Queensland, Australia. After appropriate dilution, all samples were<br>
subject to the COD analysis using our method and the standard COD method.<br>
The COD values obtained from the two methods for all samples were then<br>
correlated and shown in Fig 13. A correlation coefficient of 0.973 and slope of<br>
0.992 were obtained. This means our method predicts the same COD value as the<br>
standard COD method. This demonstrates that our method is equivalent to the<br>
standard method in predicting the COD values.<br>
Example 6<br>
Determination of COD in Synthetic samples<br>
The use of flow injection (Figures 4 and 5) to determine COD in aqueous solution<br>
was first tested with synthetic samples prepared with pure organic chemicals, i.e.<br>
glucose, glutamic acid, GGA and sucrose. The time required for a single<br>
measurement was 1-2 min. Figure 14 shows the calibration curve of the various<br>
organic compounds in terms of ÂµM and theoretical COD concentration<br>
respectively. Figure 14a shows that the photoelectrochemical detector had<br>
different sensitivities (slope of the calibration curve) to different organics in regards<br>
of ÂµM concentration. The sensitivity decreased in the order of sucrose, GGA,<br>
glucose and glutamic acid. This is because the organic compounds contribute<br>
different number of electrons [n=4y- 2j+m-3k-q) in the exhaustive oxidation<br>
reactions. With the decrease of transferred electrons per mole, i.e. sucrose<br>
(n=48), GGA (n=42), glucose (n=24) and glutamic acid (n=18), the organic<br>
compounds give fewer electrons per mole and hence the sensitivity decreases.<br>
This explained the sensitivity order in Figure 14a. With the transferred electron<br>
number (n), the concentrations of the organic compounds were converted from ÂµM<br>
to theoretical COD value in ppm. The same sensitivities, evidenced with the same<br>
slope, were obtained for the selected organics in Figure 14b. This implied that the<br>
photoelectrochemical detector oxidised the above organics to the same extent, i.e.<br>
the organic compounds have been oxidised indiscriminately and the mineralisation<br>
was achieved. The detection principle was therefore validated. These is shown by<br>
plotting the PECOD values against the theoretical COD values as shown in Figure<br>
14c using glucose trendline as standard calibration curve. The line of best fit has a<br>
slope of 1.0268 and R2 of 0.9984, which directly demonstrated that suitability to<br>
use glucose as a calibration standard to determine COD value for the unknown<br>
sample.<br>
It was found that the detection limit of 0.5 ppm COD with a linear range up to 60<br>
ppm COD can be achieved under the experimental conditions employed using<br>
glucose as testing anaiyte. The detection limit can be extended further by<br>
increasing the sample injection volume while the linear range can be increased by<br>
a further smaller injection volume.<br>
Reproducibility and stability are important parameters for the usefulness of the<br>
detector. The response reproducibility of the sensor to 100 ÂµM glucose was<br>
studied using repeated determinations (n=12) and RSD% was found to be 0.8%.<br>
The detector is relatively stable. Significant baseline shift was observed for the<br>
first two hours when the electrode was brand new due to some of the active TiO2<br>
particles were not attached on the electrode surface enough firmly and was<br>
removed by the carrier. The baseline became almost constant after these non-<br>
stable active sites were removed. In fact all the data reported in this paper was<br>
obtained from the same TiOz electrode. The electrode had experience the change<br>
of pH (from 2 to10), the change of potential (-0.4 to +0.8V), the change of flow<br>
rate, the change of injection volume and analysis of real samples and finished<br>
nearly thousand of the measurements it is stiii relatively sensitive and stable.<br>
When the electrode was not being used, it is filled with Milli-Q water and store in<br>
the light. It is well known that TiO2 surface has merits of self-cleaning and super<br>
hydrophilicity. The fouling of electrode, which is commonly caused by adsorption<br>
of organic compounds and growth of bacteria, was not observed after storage.<br>
Because of this, even after a few days, it needed only about 5 minutes to<br>
regenerate the used electrode to acquire a stable baseline to start the detection of<br>
COD again.<br>
Example 7<br>
PECOD vs COD<br>
The pH of the real samples tested in this example was in the range of 5-9, which is<br>
the pH independent region of the photoelectrochemical detector. Standard<br>
calibration curve method was used to determine the COD value in real sample.<br>
Figure 15 shows the typical response of the flow injection response using glucose<br>
as the standard substance. As shown in the figure, both the charge (peak area,<br>
Fig 15 (a)) and the peak current (peak height, Fig 15 (b)) increased proportionally<br>
with the increase of glucose concentration. The calibration curve (the inserts of<br>
Figure 15) was therefore constructed using the data from the above detection.<br>
At the same time, the standard COD value was determined with conventional COD<br>
method (dichromate method). Figure 16 shows the correlation between the<br>
experimental COD values and standard COD values. Where valid, the Pearson<br>
Correlation coefficient was used as a measure of the intensity of association<br>
between the values obtained from the flow injection photoelectrochemical COD<br>
method and the conventional COD method. This was employed for the data in<br>
Figure 16. A highly significant correlation (r=0.991, P=0.000, n=13) between the<br>
two methods was obtained indicating the two methods agreed very well. More<br>
importantly, the slope of the principle axis of the correlation ellipse of 1.0819 was<br>
obtained. This almost unity slope value suggests both methods were accurately<br>
measuring the same COD value. Given a 95% confidence interval, this slope was<br>
between 1.016 and 1.174. This implies that we can be 95% confident that the<br>
true slope lies between these two values. Consider that there are analytical errors<br>
associated with both the flow injection photoelectrochemical COD and the<br>
standard method measurements and that these errors contribute to scatter on both<br>
axes, the strong correlation and slope obtained provides compelling support for the<br>
suitability of the flow injection photoelectrochemical COD method for measuring<br>
Chemical oxygen demand. The excellent agreements between the two COD<br>
values demonstrates the suitability for the proposed method to measure COD.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The present invention provides a COD analysis method, which is accurate,<br>
sensitive, environmentally friendly, robust, rapid and easy to be automated. This<br>
method in principle measures the theoretical COD value due to the extraordinary<br>
high oxidation power of photogenerated holes. The method described here is a<br>
direct method and independent of sample matrix. Under exhaustive degradation<br>
conditions, the method is an absolute method requires no calibration.<br>
Experimentally, it correlates well with the conventional dichromate method<br>
(Standard method). The electrode has a very good long time-stability, without<br>
showing any decline of photocatalytic activity. The nature of the analytical principle<br>
employed makes the method insensitive to the change of temperature. The<br>
method shows a good tolerance to temperature change in contrast to Karube's<br>
method. During the experiment the temperature did not controlled with the sample<br>
temperature ranging from 10 to 40Â°C, no photocurrent and charge change was<br>
observed.<br>
Whilst the description of the invention utilises a three electrode<br>
photochemical cell it will be appreciated that the photoetectrochemica! cell may<br>
comprise a working electrode (TiO2) and a counter electrode, wherein the counter<br>
electrode may suitable act as both a counter electrode and a reference electrode.<br>
Throughout the specification the aim has been to describe the preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention without limiting the invention to any one embodiment<br>
or specific collection of features.<br>
Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the<br>
word "comprises", and variations such as "comprise" or "comprising", will be<br>
understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers or<br>
steps but not to the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.<br>
