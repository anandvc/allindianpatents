CARBOXAMIDO OPIOID COMPOUNDS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This Application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/571,298, filed May 14, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR<br>
DEVELOPMENT<br>
The research and development of the invention described below was not<br>
federally sponsored.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tramadol hydrochloride, (IRS, 2RS)-2-(dimethyl-amino)-methyl-1-(3-<br>
methoxyphenyl)-cyclohexanol HCI (tramadol), is a centrally-acting analgesic that<br>
has an unexpected distinction from morphine, the prototype pure opioid<br>
analgesic. Although tramadol was introduced into clinical practice in the 1970s<br>
without expectation of mechanistic differences from opiates, the data gathered to<br>
date in preclinical studies, clinical trials, epidemiological reports, and widespread<br>
use in patients indicate that a differentiation is appropriate.<br>
Tramadol is an atypical centrally acting analgesic in that its efficacy appears to<br>
be attributable to multiple mechanisms of action. The compound and its<br>
enantiomers bind with weak affinity to rodent and human µ-opioid receptors and<br>
with less affinity for δ- or κ-opioid receptors. Tramadol's O-desmethyl metabolite<br>
binds with higher affinity than the parent compound, but still with much lower<br><br>
affinity than morphine. Thus, activation of µ-opioid receptors appears to be one<br>
of the components of tramadol's mechanism of action, but insufficient on its own<br>
to explain tramadol's antinociceptive and analgesic potency and efficacy.<br>
A second, non-opioid component is suggested by several observations<br>
that include the incomplete naloxone reversibility in most animal models and in<br>
human trials; and, the attenuation of its antinociceptive or analgesic effect by<br>
non-opioid antagonists. Hence, the results are consistent with dual contributions,<br>
opioid and non-opioid, with the predominant contribution perhaps being<br>
dependent upon the species, route of administration, or particular nature of the<br>
pain. The source of the dual mechanisms has been hypothesized to arise from<br>
the different pharmacologies of the two enantiomers of tramadol, one being more<br>
opioid-like than the other.<br>
Analgesics that operate via the µ-opioid receptor are typically phenols and<br>
phenol ethers. They frequently suffer from the drawback that they are<br>
metabolically inactivated by conversion to glucuronides, which are rapidly<br>
excreted. The carboxamide group has been found to be an effective bioisosteric<br>
surrogate for the phenol group in certain benzomorphans and morphinans, which<br>
has led to a series of opioids with a superior biological lifetime (Wentland, M. P.<br>
et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 11(5), 623-6; Wentland. M. P. etal.<br>
Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 11(13), 1717-1721; Bidlack, Jean M. etal. J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 2002, 302(1), 374-380).<br>
The preparation of certain 1-aryl -(2-dialkylaminomethyl)cycloclohexan-1-<br>
ols is disclosed in PCT application WO 03/080557, issued Oct. 10, 2003<br>
(Sundermann, B. et al, Grunenthal GMBH Assignee.). A genus of tramadol<br>
analogs is disclosed in PCT application WO 03/048113, issued June 12, 2003<br>
(Senanayake, C. H. et al., Seprecor Assignee).<br>
Thus there is a need to address the metabolic inactivation of tramadol that<br>
occurs through the conversion of its hydroxy metabolite to the corresponding<br>
glucuronide. The present invention replaces the methoxy substituent of tramadol<br>
with a carboxamido group.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides carboxamido opioid compounds of<br>

surgery and chronic pain such as caused by neuropathic conditions, diabetic<br>
peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, post-stroke<br>
pain syndromes or cluster or migraine headaches. The utility of the instant<br>
compounds as µ-opioid receptor modulators can be determined according to the<br>
procedures described herein.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Another embodiment is a pharmaceutical<br>
composition made by mixing any of the compounds described above and a<br>

In the method for treating pain modulated by a µ-opioid ligand there is<br>
administered to a subject in need thereof any of the compounds as defined<br><br>
herein in a therapeutically effective dose to modulate the µ-opioid receptor. The<br>
compound may be administered to a subject in need of treatment by any<br>
conventional route of administration including, but not limited to oral, nasal,<br>
sublingual, ocular, transdermal, rectal, vaginal and parenteral (i.e. subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous etc.).<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method of treating pain in a<br>
subject already tolerant to one or more µ-opioid medications other than a<br>
compound or compounds as defined herein, which method comprises<br>
administering to the subject in need thereof any of the compounds as defined<br>
herein in a therapeutically effective dose to modulate the µ-opioid receptor. The<br>
compound may be administered to a subject in need of treatment by any<br>
conventional route of administration including, but not limited to oral, nasal,<br>
sublingual, ocular, transdermal, rectal, vaginal and parenteral (i.e. subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous etc.).<br>
A therapeutically effective dose for use of the instant compounds or a<br>
pharmaceutical composition thereof comprises a dose range of from about 0.001<br>
mg to about 1,000 mg, in particular from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg or, more<br>
particularly from about 1 mg to about 250 mg of active ingredient per day for an<br>
average (70 kg) human. The carboxamido opioids described herein may be<br>
administered in a reduced dose relative to their hydroxy counterparts as<br>
permitted by their improved pharmacokinetic profile.<br>
For oral administration, a pharmaceutical composition is preferably provided<br>
in the form of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5,1.0, 2.5, 5.0,10.0, 15.0, 25.0,<br>
50.0, 100,150, 200, 250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the<br>
symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the subject to be treated.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a<br>
single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses<br>
of two, three or four times daily.<br><br>
It is apparent to one skilled in the art that the therapeutically effective dose<br>
for active compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof will<br>
vary according to the desired effect. Therefore, optimal dosages to be<br>
administered may be readily determined and will vary with the particular<br>
compound used, the mode of administration, the strength of the preparation, and<br>
the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with<br>
the particular subject being treated, including subject age, weight, diet and time<br>
of administration, will result in the need to adjust the dose to an appropriate<br>
therapeutic level.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and dosage regimens or by means of those compositions and<br>
dosage regimens established in the art whenever use of the compounds of the<br>
invention as mu-opioid receptor modulators is required for a subject in need<br>
thereof.<br>

GENERAL SYNTHETIC METHODS<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention can be synthesized in<br>
accordance with the general synthetic methods described above and are<br>
illustrated more particularly in the schemes that follow. Since the schemes are<br>
illustrations, the invention should not be construed as being limited by the<br>
chemical reactions and conditions expressed. The preparation of the various<br>
starting materials used in the schemes is well within the skill of persons versed in<br>
the art.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect'sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by<br>
means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and<br>
T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient<br>
subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention may be synthesized<br>
by the methods illustrated in Scheme A. Cyclohexanone A1 may be elaborated<br>
using a Mannich reaction with formaldehyde and an amine of formula A2 to give<br>
a compound of formula A3, wherein R1 and R2 are as previously defined. A Y-<br>
functionalized aryl-magnesium reagent of formula A4, prepared according to the<br>
literature (Knochel, P. et al. Synlett, 2003, 6, 885-887), may be added to a ketone<br>
of formula A3 to give a compound of formula A5. Treatment of a compound of<br><br>
formula A5 with hydroxide anion provides carboxamido compounds of formula<br>
A6.<br><br>
Scheme B shows an alternative synthetic route to compounds of the<br>
present invention. Starting with a Y-functionalized derivative of a tramadol<br>
metabolite, B1, which may be synthesized using methods known in the literature,<br>
treatment with triflic anhydride provides compounds of formula B2. Compounds<br><br><br>
of formula B2 may be converted into compounds of formula B3 via a<br>
methoxycarbonylation using carbon monoxide gas bubbled through methanol in<br>
the presence of a palladium catalyst and a ligand such as (1,1'-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene. Compounds of formula B3 may be saponified<br>
using hydroxide to form their corresponding carboxylic acid, B4. Compounds of<br>
formula B4 may be further elaborated to compounds of Formula (I) by coupling<br>
the carboxy group with an amine of formula B5 in the presence of an appropriate<br>
coupling agent, such as HATU in an aprotic solvent.<br>
Diastereomers of the present invention may be separated by reverse<br>
phase or normal phase chromatography or by fractional crystallization. Racemic<br>
compounds of the present invention may be separated into their individual<br>
enantiomers using known methods from the literature (EP 786450).<br>
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES<br>
Specific compounds which are representative of this invention were<br>
prepared as per the following examples and reaction sequences; the examples<br>
and the diagrams depicting the reaction sequences are offered by way of<br>
illustration, to aid in the understanding of the invention and should not be<br>
construed to limit in any way the invention set forth in the claims which follow<br>
thereafter. The instant compounds may also be used as intermediates in<br>
subsequent examples to produce additional compounds of the present invention.<br>
No attempt has been made to optimize the yields obtained in any of the<br>
reactions. One skilled in the art would know how to increase such yields through<br>
routine variations in reaction times, temperatures, solvents and/or reagents.<br>
Reagents were purchased from commercial sources. Nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance (NMR) spectra for hydrogen atoms were measured in the indicated<br>
solvent with (TMS) as the internal standard on a Bruker Biospin, Inc. DPX-300 (300<br><br>
MHz) spectrometer. The values are expressed in parts per million downfield from<br>
TMS. The mass spectra (MS) were determined on a Micromass Platform LC<br>
spectrometer or an Agilent LC spectrometer using electrospray techniques.<br>
Stereoisomeric compounds may be characterized as racemic mixtures or as<br>
separate diastereomers and enantiomers thereof using X-ray crystallography and<br>
other methods known to one skilled in the art. Specifically, chiral separations were<br>
performed by preparative HPLC using a Dynamic Axial Compression, type<br>
Prochrom LC50 column. Optical rotations were determined using a Perkin-Elmer<br>
Model 241 polarimeter. Unless otherwise noted, the materials used in the<br>
examples were obtained from readily available commercial suppliers or synthesized<br>
by standard methods known to one skilled in the art of chemical synthesis. The<br>
substituent groups, which vary between examples, are hydrogen unless otherwise<br>
noted.<br>
Procedure A<br>
3-[(2-Dimethylamino)methyl]-1-hydroxycyclohexyl]-benzonitrile<br><br>
Isopropylmagnesium chloride (5.4 mL of a 2M solution in THF, 10.9 mmol) was<br>
added dropwise to a solution of 3-iodobenzonitrile (2 g, 8.7 mmol) in THF (20<br>
mL) at 0°C. After stirring for 30 min, 2-dimethylaminomethyl-cyclohexanone was<br>
added and the ice bath removed. After 1 h, the reaction was quenched with<br>
saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (20 mL) and ethyl acetate (40 mL) was<br>
added. The organic phase was separated and then extracted with an aqueous<br>
solution of 1N hydrochloric acid (2 x 20 mL). The acid extracts were combined<br>
and then made basic with 2N sodium hydroxide solution. The basic solution was<br>
then extracted with chloroform (3 x 20 mL). The organic extracts were combined,<br>
dried (K2CO3), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 3-[(2-<br><br>
dimethylamino)methyl]-1-hydroxycyclohexyl]-benzonitrile as a mixture of four<br>
diastereomers (1.66 g, 73%).<br>
Example 1<br>
3-[(1 -RS, 2-SR)-2-[(Dimethylamino)methyl]-1 -hydroxycyclohexyl]-<br>
benzamide, Cpd 1<br><br>
A sample of 3-[(2-dimethylamino)methyl]-1-hydroxycyclohexyl]-<br>
benzonitrile (Procedure A, 1.66 g, 6.4 mmol) as a mixture of diastereomers was<br>
dissolved in tert-butanol (20 mL), powdered potassium hydroxide (1.8 g, 32.1<br>
mmol) was added, and the reaction was brought to reflux for 1 h. After cooling<br>
the reaction, chloroform (50 mL) and water (50 mL) were added. The organic<br>
layer was separated, dried (K2CO3), filtered, and concentrated to afford 3-[(2-<br>
dimethylamino)methyl]-1-hydroxycyclohexyl]-benzamide as a diastereomeric<br>

acid) / methanol: isocratic mixture 85/15, and washed with pure methanol<br>
between runs.The pure fractions of separated Cpd 2 and the pure fractions of<br>
separated Cpd 1 were separately but identically treated: the solvents were<br>

hydroxycyclohexyl]-phenyl ester<br>
A 1.0 g sample of 60% NaH in oil was placed into a flask and washed with<br>
hexanes. The NaH was suspended in 20 mL of CH2CI2 and cooled in an ice<br>
bath. A sample of 3-[(1 -RS, 2-RS)-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1 -<br>
hydroxycydohexyl]-phenol (6.3 g, 0.024 mol) in CH2CI2 (20 mL) was added.<br>
After stirring for 1 h, a solution triflic anhydride (6 mL in 10 mL CH2CI2) was<br>
added dropwise. The ice bath was removed and the reaction was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 2 h. The reaction was then washed with water, brine, and dried<br>
(Na2SO4). The solvent was evaporated to give 11 g of an oil. The residue was<br>
passed through a silica gel column (4:1, CH2CI2:MeOH) to give 7.9 g (83 %) of<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 3-[(1-RS, 2-RS)-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-<br>

benzoic acid (0.1 g, 0.36 mmol), CH2CI2(5 mL), and diethylamine (0.08 mL, 0.36<br>
mmol) was placed into a flask and stirred for 5 min. To the reaction was added<br>
HATU (0.13 g, 0.36 mmol) and stirring was continued for 2 h. Water was added<br>
and the organic phase was separated, washed again with water, dried (Na2SO4),<br><br>
and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated in vacuo and the residue passed<br>
through a silica gel column (90:10:1, CH2CI2: MeOH: NH4OH) to give 42 mg<br>

Biological Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Rat Brain Mu and Delta Opioid Receptor Binding Assay<br><br>
The activity of compounds of the invention as opioids is demonstrated by the rat<br>
brain mu and delta opioid receptor binding assay as described below.<br>
Procedure<br>
Male, Wistar rats (150-250 g, VAF, Charles River, Kingston, NY) were killed by<br>
cervical dislocation and their brains removed and placed immediately in ice cold<br>
Tris HCI buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The forebrains were separated from the<br>
remainder of the brain by a coronal transection, beginning dorsally at the colliculi<br>
and passing ventrally through the midbrain-pontine junction. After dissection, the<br>
forebrains were homogenized in Tris buffer in a Teflon®-glass homogenizer. The<br>
homogenate was diluted to a concentration of 1 g of forebrain tissue per 100 mL<br>
Tris buffer and centrifuged at 39,000 X G for 10 min. The pellet was<br>
resuspended in the same volume of Tris buffer with several brief pulses from a<br>
Polytron homogenizer. This particulate preparation was used for the opioid<br>
receptor binding assays. Following incubation with the mu opioid selective<br>
peptide ligand [3H]DAMGO or the delta opioid selective ligand [3H]DPDPE at<br>
25°C, the tube contents were filtered through Whatman GF/B filter sheets on a<br>
Brandel cell harvester. The tubes and filters were rinsed three times with 4 mL of<br>
10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and the radioactivity associated with the filter circles<br>
determined using Formula 989 scintillation fluid (New England Nuclear, Boston,<br>
MA) in a scintillation counter.<br>
Analysis<br>
The data were used to calculate a K, value, using GraphPad Prism.<br>
Example 2<br>
[35S]GTPyS Binding Assay in human mu opioid-CHO Cell Membranes<br>
Preparation of Membranes<br><br>
Human mu-CHO cell membranes were purchased from Receptor Biology, Inc.<br>
(Baltimore, MD). About 10 mg/ml of membrane protein was suspended in 10 mM<br>
TRIS-HCI, pH 7.2, 2 mM EDTA, 10% sucrose.<br>
Membranes were maintained at 4-8°C. 1 ml of membranes was added into 15 ml<br>
cold assay buffer, containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCI2, 100 mM<br>
NaCI, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA. The membrane suspension was<br>
homogenized with a Polytron 2 times and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min.<br>
The supernatant was then centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet was<br>
resuspended in 10 ml assay buffer with a Polytron.<br>
Incubation Procedure<br>
The pellet membranes (20 pg/ml) were preincubated with Scintillation Proximity<br>
Assay beads (SPA, 10 mg/ml) at 25°C for 45 min in the assay buffer. The SPA<br>
beads (5 mg/ml) coupled with membranes (10 µg/ml) were then incubated with<br>
0.5 nM [35S]GTPyS in the same HEPES buffer containing 50 µM GDP in total<br>
volume of 200 µl. A range of concentrations of receptor agonists were used to<br>
stimulate [35S]GTPyS binding. The basal binding was tested in the absence of<br>
agonist and non-specific binding was tested in the presence of 10 µM unlabeled<br>
GTPyS. Radioactivity was quantified on a Packard TopCount.<br>
Data<br>
Data were calculated as follows:<br>
% of basal = (stimulated - non-specific) * 100/(basal - non specific)<br>
% Inhibition = (% Basal of 1 µM DAMGO - % Basal of compound)*100<br>
/(% Basal of 1 µM DAMGO -100)<br>
[35S]GTPvS Binding Assay in NG108-15 Cell Membrane<br>
Preparation of Membranes<br><br>
NG108-15 cell membranes were purchased from Applied Cell Sciences<br>
(Rockville, MD). An 8 mg/mL portion of membrane protein was suspended in 10<br>
mM TRIS-HCI. pH 7.2, 2 mM EDTA, 10% sucrose.<br>
Membranes were maintained at 4-8°C. A 1 mL portion of membranes was added<br>
into 10 mL cold assay buffer, containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCfe, 100<br>
mM NaCI, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EGTA. The membrane suspension was<br>
homogenized with a Polytron 2 times and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min.<br>
The supernatant was then centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet was<br>
resuspended in 10 ml assay buffer using a Polytron.<br>
Incubation Procedure<br>
The pellet membranes (75 µg/ml) were preincubated with SPA beads (10 mg/ml)<br>
at 25°C for 45 min in the assay buffer. The SPA beads (5 mg/ml) coupled with<br>
membranes (37.5 µg/ml) were then incubated with 0.1 nM [35S] GTPyS in the<br>
same Tris buffer containing 100 µM GDP in total volume of 200 µl. A range of<br>
concentrations of receptor agonists was used to stimulate [35S] GTPyS binding.<br>
The basal binding was tested in the absence of agonist and non-specific binding<br>
was tested in the presence of 10 µM unlabeled GTPyS. The radioactivity was<br>
quantified on a Packard TopCount.<br>
Data<br>
Calculations were performed as follows:<br>
% of Basal = (stimulated - non specific) * 100/(basal - non specific).<br>
EC50 values were calculated using the Prism program.<br><br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
Rat CFA Radiant Heat model of inflammatory pain<br>
Intraplantar injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) in rodents results in a<br>
strong, long-lasting inflammatory reaction, characterized by a chronic and<br>
pronounced hyperalgesia to both thermal and mechanical stimuli. These effects<br>
peak between 24-72 h following injection, and can last for several days to a few<br>
weeks. To assess the ability of compounds to reverse thermal hyperalgesia,<br>
male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-350 g) were given an intraplantar injection of<br>
CFA (1:1 CFA:saline, 100 µL) into their left hindpaw. Following a 24-h incubation<br>
period, response latencies on the Radiant Heat Paw Stimulator (RH) were<br>
obtained and compared to baseline (pre-CFA) latencies. The RH device<br>
automatically registered lifting of the paw from the surface of the glass. Only rats<br>
that exhibited at least a 25% reduction in response latency from baseline (i.e.<br>
hyperalgesia) were included in further analysis. Following the post CFA latency<br>
assessment, rats were dosed orally (2.5mL/kg) with test compound or vehicle<br>
(hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, HPMC). Percent reversal of hyperalgesia was<br>
calculated for each animal as (Treatment Response - postCFA Response) /<br><br>
(preCFA Response - postCFA Response) x 100. Therefore, a return to normal<br>
pre-CFA thresholds was defined as 100% efficacy, whereas no change from<br>
post-CFA thresholds was 0% efficacy. Average % reversal of hyperalgesia was<br>
then calculated for each treatment group (n=6-8 rats/group). The Compounds 3<br>
and 4 were antihyperalgesic in this model (see Figure 1).<br>
Example 4<br>
Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain<br>
Animals:<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 145 to 165 g (approximately 6 weeks of age)<br>
were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Food and water were provided ad<br>
lib and a 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle were maintained. Animals were group<br>
housed under specific pathogen-free, barrier maintained environment and were<br>
allowed to acclimate for no less than 1 week. Following surgery, animals were<br>
housed individually in solid bottom polycarbonate cages with automatic watering<br>
devices at 22"C and a relative humidity of 60%. All animals received Harland<br>
Tekland Diet #8604.<br>
Surgery:<br>
Anesthesia was induced using isoflurane (IsoVet™) inhalant in an induction<br>
chamber (3-5% in 2 L/min of O2). Once recumbent, the animal was removed and<br>
placed into a nose cone which delivered inhalant isoflurane (0.5-2.5% at 2 L/min<br>
of O2). The dorsal pelvic area was shaved and scrubbed aseptically with<br>
chlorhexidine scrub, 70% alcohol, and a 5% chlorhexidine solution. The animal<br>
was held in ventral recumbency on a heating pad, and the surgical procedure<br>
described by Kim and Chung (1992) was performed. The left paraspinal muscles<br>
were separated from the spinous processes at the level of Lumbar 4 to Sacral 2<br>
(L4-S2). Once the musculature was retracted, the L6 transverse process was<br>
removed using a small rongeur. L4 and L5 spinal nerves could then be<br><br>
visualized. L5 was then isolated and ligated using 6-0 silk suture material. Warm<br>
saline and a dose of long-acting antibiotic was administered immediately post-op<br>
before recovery form anesthesia.<br>
Evaluation of mechanical allodynia:<br>
At least one week following surgery, animals were individually placed in a Lucite<br>
testing chamber with a wire mesh bottom. Mechanical (tactile) allodynia was<br>
measured by recording the pressure at which the affected paw was withdrawn<br>
from graded stimuli (Von Frey hairs ranging from 4.0 to 148.1 mN equivalent to<br>
0.25 to 15g of pressure) applied to the plantar surface of the paw (between the<br>
footpads) according to the procedure of Chaplan et. al (1994) in order to<br>
calculate paw withdrawal threshold (PWT). Normal rats can withstand at least<br>
15g of pressure without responding. SNL rats can respond to as little as 0.25g of<br>
pressure. Rats were included in this study only if their PWT was below 4.0g.<br>
Von Frey testing of compounds:<br>
Animals were used for compound testing between 2 weeks and 8 weeks postµ-<br>
operatively. Animals were always pre-tested for baseline withdrawal threshold<br>
on the day of testing. Following a 16 h fast, PWT was evaluated at 30 min, 1 h, 2<br>
h, and 4 h post-dosing. Dose-response studies were conducted at the time of<br>
peak effect. Studies were conducted in a blinded manner.<br>
Statistical analysis:<br>
Data were normalized and results were presented as % MPE (maximum possible<br>
effect) of the drug.<br><br>
The effect of example compounds is presented in Table 3, and Cpd 3 had an<br>
ED50 value of 17 mg/kg at 2 h (see Figure 2).<br><br><br>
Example 5<br>
Investigation of Tolerance Development<br>
The development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of mu opioid compounds is<br>
well known. The development of tolerance to the antiallodynic effect of the<br>
Compound 3 was investigated by administering the compound to spinal nerve<br>
ligated rats for five days. The antiallodynic effect of the compound was<br>
evaluated on days one and five. Dosing for five days did not diminish the<br>
antiallodynic effect of the compound; compound effect was the same or was<br>
slightly increased by repeated dosing (see figure 3).<br>
In contrast, tolerance to the antiallodynic effect of the typical mu opioid morphine<br>
rapidly developed, little or no antiallodynic effect remaining after five days of<br>
dosing (see figure 4).<br>
Example 6<br>
Metabolic Stability<br>
The metabolic stability of Compound 3 was investigated using several<br>
approaches. The compound was incubated with liver microsomes from mouse,<br>
rat, dog and human and the percent of compound remaining after ten min<br>
quantified. The compound was metabolically robust in all species tested.<br><br>
Notably, no metabolism of the compound was observed under these test<br>
conditions in human liver microsomes.<br><br>
In a follow up study in human liver microsomes, the percent of compound<br>
remaining was determined at several incubation times (30, 60 and 90 min). The<br>
in vitro half life of the compound was determined to be &gt;100 minutes.<br>
In a study using recombinant human P450 isoforms, the compound was only a<br>
weak inhibitor (IC50 &gt; 10 µM) of all isoforms tested, 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, and<br>
1A2.<br>
In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, no glucuronidation of the<br>
compound was detected.<br>
Taken together, these several in vitro metabolism studies point to the unusual<br>
metabolic stability of the compound.<br><br>
