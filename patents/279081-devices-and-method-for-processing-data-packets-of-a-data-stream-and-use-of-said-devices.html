Description<br>
Devices and method for processing data packets of a data stream and use of said devices<br>
The invention relates to devices and a method for processing data packets of a data stream and use of said<br>
devices.<br>
In recent years, the number of video and image-based monitoring systems has steadily increased. In the<br>
process, the data to be transferred are transmitted wirelessly, during which time transmission errors can<br>
occur. These transmission errors are resolved, for example, when faulty or missing data packets are sent<br>
out again. This results in high delay times during data packet transmission. In near-real-time applications,<br>
however, any data packet transmission delay times must be kept low. Consequently, the problem exists<br>
that repeat transfers of data packets cannot occur in near-real-time apphcations, because the real time<br>
requirement cannot be maintained.<br>
Alternatively, by using a forward error correction code that accompanies the data packets to be<br>
transferred, faulty or missing data packets received can be reconstructed. This approach has the<br>
disadvantage that a portion of the transmission bandwidth is used for transmission of the forward error<br>
correction code (= redundancy). In addition, the approach presented will not work satisfactorily in the<br>
following cases during transmission of segments with greatly varying error rates:<br>
(a)	The redundancy is transmitted even though the data packets reached the receiver error-free,<br>
during which time transmission bandwidth was needlessly used.<br>
(b)	The redundancy is transmitted, but based on the high error rate, it is not sufficient to be able to<br>
completely reconstruct the faulty or missing data packets.<br>
Therefore the intent is to provide a method and a device for processing data packets in a data stream that<br>
enables repeat transmission of data packets during near-real-time applications.<br>
This intent is achieved by the features of claims 1, 5,13,17 and 25. The subordinate claims present<br>
alternative embodiments of the invention.<br>
The invention relates in its first embodiment to a device for processing data packets in a data stream with<br>
first data packets that represent received error-free data packets, second data packets that represent<br>
received faulty data packets or missing data packets, and third data packets that are received error-free as<br>
 <br>
<br>
a result of repeat transmission of data packets represented as second data packets, wherein a set of first<br>
data packets and a set of third data packets are disjunctive, and the device includes:<br>
A first unit for processing first and second data packets into fourth data packets;<br>
A control unit<br>
-	To activate a first mode when a second data packet is identified;<br>
-	To generate a copy of the first unit in the form of a second unit when the first mode is activated;<br>
-	To activate a second mode after the corresponding third data packet is present for each of the second<br>
data packets;<br>
The second unit for processing first and third data packets into fifth data packets after activation of the<br>
first mode, wherein until activation of the second mode, the first unit routes fourth data packets, and after<br>
activation of the second mode, the second unit routes fifth data packets to a data sink.<br>
The second data packet is understood to be a data packet that is faulty or not received but expected, that<br>
is, a missing data packet If the data packet has not been received, a second data packet can be generated<br>
that represents the missing data packet, with an empty data field, for example.<br>
The core of the invention is that, in the case of receiving faulty or missing data packets, i.e., second data<br>
packets, the data packets are processed by two independently running units, the first and the second unit<br>
The first unit processes first and second data packets and in the process delivers fourth data packets in real<br>
time, which are transmitted to a data sink. Parallel to that, the second unit processes incoming first and<br>
third data packets into fifth data packets after the appearance of the second data packets. This ensures that<br>
the second unit decodes the data stream error-free, so that initially a longer delay time is acceptable. Only<br>
at the time when all second data packets can be replaced by corresponding third data packets, i.e. at the<br>
time of activation of the second mode, can the second unit provide the data stream to the data sink in real<br>
time. Precisely at this time, the second mode is then activated, at which point instead of fourth data<br>
packets, now only fifth data packets are transmitted to the data sink. It is hereby ensured that the<br>
processed data packets are received by the data sink in real time and after the data stream can be<br>
reconstructed in real time and error-free in the second unit, subsequently processed first data packets can<br>
be transmitted to the data sink.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that the simple mechanism of repeated transmission, such<br>
as today with TCP/IP on the Internet (TCP - Transport Control Protocol, IP - Internet Protocol), can be<br>
used, so that the present device and corresponding method can be integrated at low cost into a<br>
transmission system that exists today.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Moreover, the use of the aforementioned device appears to be advantageous with predictive coding<br>
methods, in which information such as image data is predicated on already coded informatioa In the prior<br>
art, e.g., with the ITU-T H.263 video coding procedure, when transmission errors occur, see second data<br>
packet, it is necessary to code the information without prediction in order to prevent subsequent errors<br>
based on the transmission error. Coding without prediction causes a higher bandwidth requirement The<br>
device, in contrast, enables the avoidance of forced coding without prediction to prevent subsequent<br>
errors when transmission errors occur and therefore saves bandwidth. Through the bandwidth savings, the<br>
rate of information transfer, e.g., the refresh rate, is also kept high, because in contrast to the prior art,<br>
bandwidth is available instead of forced coding without prediction for coding of additional information.<br>
When generating a copy of the first unit in the form of a second unit during activation of the first mode, it<br>
is understood that at the time of activation of the first mode, the first and second units are initialized in<br>
such a way that, when coding one or more identical data packets, e.g. the first data packet, they deliver an<br>
identical coding result If the first and the second unit are implemented in software, for example, then the<br>
copy is generated in such a way that the variable values and program conditions of both units are<br>
identical.<br>
The set of first data packets and the set of third data packets are disjunctive. This means that data packets<br>
in the data stream are represented as either first or third data packets. A given data packet in the data<br>
stream therefore cannot be both a first data packet and a third data packet<br>
The control unit from the first embodiment can be also be such that it clears the first unit after activation<br>
of the second mode. As a result, system resources are freed up for a possible software implementation,<br>
whereby the overall performance of the device can be improved, for example through extra memory that<br>
is made available.<br>
The first embodiment of the device preferably includes a supply unit for routing fourth data packets to the<br>
data sink up until activation of the second mode and for routing fifth data packets after activation of the<br>
second mode. As a result, routing of data packets processed through the first and second unit is controlled<br>
in a simple manner, depending on the mode.<br>
According to the first embodiment, if error concealment is also used in the first unit during processing of<br>
the first and second data packets, then a quality feature, such as image quality, can be improved in the<br>
fourth data packets.<br>
 <br>
<br>
. The invention in its second embodiment also includes a device for processing data packets in a data<br>
stream with first data packets that represent received error-free data packets; second data packets that<br>
represent received faulty or missing data packets; and third data packets that are received error-free as a<br>
result of repeat transmission of data packets represented as second data packets, wherein a set of first data<br>
packets and a set of third data packets are disjunctive, and the device includes:<br>
A first unit for processing first and third data packets into fourth data packets;<br>
A control unit<br>
To activate a first mode when a second data packet is identified;<br>
-	To generate a copy of the first unit in the form of a second unit when the first mode is activated;<br>
To activate a second mode after the corresponding third data packet is present for each of the second<br>
data packets;<br>
The second unit for processing the first and second data packets into fifth data packets after activation of<br>
the first mode, wherein until activation of the second mode, the first unit routes fourth data packets, and<br>
after activation of the second mode, the second unit routes fifth data packets to a data sink.<br>
This second embodiment presents an alternative realization of the first embodiment. Therefore, in general,<br>
the advantages of the first embodiment are also found in the second embodiment The second<br>
embodiment also has the advantage that the first unit always processes the first and third data packets and<br>
therefore can be implemented as hardware, for example. However, in the second embodiment the second<br>
unit is only temporarily used and therefore can be implemented in software, for example.<br>
In a preferred second embodiment, the control unit is also designed to clear the second unit after<br>
activation of the second mode. As a result, system resources are freed up for a possible software<br>
implementation, whereby the overall performance of the device can be improved, for example through<br>
extra memory that is made available.<br>
In the second embodiment, preferably the control unit is also designed<br>
-	To route fourth data packets to the data sink until activation of the first mode and after activation of<br>
the second mode,<br>
To route fifth data packets to the data sink after activation of the first mode and until activation of the<br>
second mode.<br>
As a result, routing of data packets processed through the first and second unit is controlled in a simple<br>
manner, depending on the mode.<br>
 <br>
<br>
In the second embodiment, preferably the second unit is designed for processing first and second data<br>
packets also with the aid of error concealment As a result, the quality, e.g., image quality, of the fourth<br>
data packets can be improved.<br>
It is preferable for the control unit also to be designed so that the second mode can only be activated if a<br>
corresponding third data packet is present for each second data packet and the first unit and second unit<br>
are processing the same first data packet nearly simultaneously. It is thereby ensured that the data sink can<br>
receive fifth data packets instead of fourth data packets without noticeable delay. Nearly simultaneously<br>
is understood to mean that in the first and second units, the same first data packet is being processed at a<br>
given point in time, for example, the first unit has processed 95% of a first data packet and the second unit<br>
has processed 10% of the same first data packet<br>
In a further embodiment, the second unit further includes a memory for caching first and third data<br>
packets and a sorting unit for sorting first and third data packets, wherein the sorting unit ensures a<br>
chronological sequence of first and third data packets for proper processing. As a result, the second unit,<br>
with an identical setup to the first unit, can be used because caching and sorting are performed by the<br>
control unit Thus the second unit can be generated cost-effectively and with low development effort<br>
The data stream preferably features coded multimedia data, especially coded video data, and the first and<br>
second units are preferably each designed as analysis units, especially image or video analysis units, for<br>
analyzing multimedia data. As a result, the invented device is useful in an analysis device, especially<br>
applicable for surveillance.<br>
Alternatively, the data stream features coded multimedia data, especially coded video data, and the first<br>
and second units are each designed as decoding units, especially video decoding units, for decoding coded<br>
multimedia data. As a result, the device is useful in a decoder, especially for decoding of an encoded<br>
video.<br>
The invention in a third embodiment also relates to a method for processing data packets in a data stream<br>
with first data packets that represent received error-free data packets; second data packets that represent<br>
received faulty or missing, i.e. not received, data packets; and third data packets that are received error-<br>
free as a result of repeat transmission of data packets represented as second data packets, where a set of<br>
first data packets and a set of third data packets are disjunctive, and the following steps are carried out:<br>
-	Processing of first and second data packets into fourth data packets by the first unit;<br>
-	Activation of a first mode when a second data packet is identified;<br>
Generation of a copy of the first unit in the form of a second unit when the first mode is activated;<br>
 <br>
<br>
Activation of a second mode after a corresponding third data packet is present for each of the second<br>
data packets;<br>
-	Processing of first and third data packets into fifth data packets by the second unit after activation of<br>
the first mode, wherein, until activation of the second mode, the fourth data packets and, after<br>
activation of the second mode, the fifth data packets are routed to a data sink.<br>
The advantages to this are analogous to those of the device in the first embodiment.<br>
If the first unit is cleared after activation of the second mode, then system resources can be spared for<br>
carrying out the procedure.<br>
Until activation of the second mode, fourth data packets and, after activation of the second mode, fifth<br>
data packets are preferably routed with a supply unit to the data sink. As a result, routing of processed<br>
data packets can be controlled in a simple manner, depending on the mode.<br>
A16: In a further embodiment of the invention, the first unit also processes the first and second data<br>
packets using error concealment As a result, the quality, e.g., image quality, of the fourth data packets<br>
can be improved.<br>
A fourth embodiment of the invention also relates to a method for processing data packets in a data<br>
stream with first data packets that represent received error-free data packets; second data packets that<br>
represent received faulty data packets or missing, i.e. not received, data packets; and third data packets<br>
that are received error-free as a result of repeat transmission of data packets represented as second data<br>
packets, wherein a set of first data packets and a set of third data packets are disjunctive, and the<br>
following steps are carried out:<br>
-	Processing first and third data packets into fourth data packets by a first unit;<br>
Activation of a first mode when a second data packet is identified;<br>
Generation of a copy of the first unit in the form of a second unit when the first mode is activated;<br>
-	Activation of a second mode after a corresponding third data packet is present for each of the second<br>
data packets;<br>
Processing first and second data packets into fifth data packets by the second unit after activation of<br>
the first mode, wherein, until activation of the first mode and after activation of the second mode,<br>
fourth data packets and, after activation of the first mode and until activation of the second mode,<br>
fifth data packets are routed to a data sink.<br>
The advantages to this are analogous to those of the device in the second embodiment.<br>
 <br>
<br>
If, according to the fourth embodiment, the second unit is disconnected after activation of the second<br>
mode, then system resources can be spared for carrying out the procedure.<br>
The fourth embodiment preferably uses a supply unit for routing fourth data packets, until activation of<br>
the first mode and after activation of the second mode, and fifth packets, after activation of the first mode<br>
and until activation of the second mode, to the data sink. As a result, routing of processed data packets<br>
can be controlled in a simple manner, depending on the mode.<br>
In addition, in the fourth embodiment of the invention, the first and second data packets can be further<br>
processed by the second unit using error concealment As a result, an increase in a quality aspect of the<br>
processed data packets, i.e., the fifth data packets, can be achieved.<br>
If the second mode is activated, after the corresponding third data packet is present for each of the second<br>
data packets and the first unit and second unit are processing the same first data packet nearly<br>
simultaneously, then it is ensured that the data sink, without noticeable delay, can receive fifth data<br>
packets instead of fourth data packets starting when the second mode is activated.<br>
Preferably, the control unit caches first and third data packets using a memory and sorts first and third<br>
data packets using a sorting unit, wherein the sorting unit ensures a chronological sequence of first and<br>
third data packets for proper processing. As a result, the second unit, with a setup identical to that of the<br>
first unit, can be used because caching and sorting are performed by the control unit Thus the second unit<br>
also can be generated cost-effectively and with low development effort<br>
The data stream preferably has coded multimedia data, especially coded video data, and the first and<br>
second units are each designed as analysis units, especially image or video analysis units, for analyzing<br>
multimedia data. As a result, the invented device is useful in an analysis device, especially applicable for<br>
surveillance.<br>
Alternatively, the data stream has coded multimedia data, especially coded video data, and the first and<br>
second units are each designed as decoding units, especially video decoding units, for decoding coded<br>
multimedia data. As a result, the device is useful in a decoder, especially for decoding of an encoded<br>
video.<br>
Finally, the invention relates to use of the device according to at least one of the embodiments listed<br>
above, wherein the device is used for analysis of video data in the context of a surveillance installation.<br>
Use of the invention in the context of a surveillance installation enables an improvement of the video data<br>
analysis.<br>
 <br>
<br>
The invention and its further modification are explained in more detail based on the figures. The figures<br>
show:<br>
Figure 1 A sender for transmitting data packets, a device for processing data packets, and a receiver<br>
for reconstructing the compiled data packets;<br>
Figure 2 A monitoring unit including the device for processing data packets;<br>
Figure 3 A flow diagram for implementing a procedure for processing data packets.<br>
Elements with the same function and mode of operation are included in the figures with the same<br>
references.<br>
Figure 1 shows one embodiment of the invention. Here real time image data in a sender SX are captured<br>
by a camera and coded in the form of a data stream S. Coding occurs here by means of a standardized<br>
video coding procedure, for example according to an MPEG-2 or H.264 process (MPEG - Motion Picture<br>
Expert Group). The data stream S is segmented for transmission in data packets D.<br>
The data packets D of the data stream S are transmitted from the sending unit SX via a transmission<br>
channel C to device V. The transmission channel functions, for example, according to the WLAN<br>
standard (WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network), where transmission errors can occur. The transmitted<br>
data packets D are received by the control unit SE of the device V via transmission channel C. Thereby,<br>
the first data packets Dl are understood to be received error-free data packets and the second data packets<br>
D2 are understood to be received faulty data packets or data packets that were not received. The control<br>
unit can therefore recognize, based on a sequence number, for example, that one of the data packets<br>
transmitted by the sender SX through the control unit is missing, whereby the missing data packet is<br>
classified as a second data packet<br>
The control unit SE routes first and second data packets D1, D2 to a first unit E1 for processing. If a data<br>
packet has not been received, then the control unit SE can pass on an empty second data packet D2. In the<br>
present embodiment, the first unit E1 is a first video coding unit that decodes first and second data<br>
packets and from this generates fourth data packets D4. The first unit E1 optionally is equipped with an<br>
error concealment unit that processes missing data packets or faulty data packets, i.e., second data<br>
packets, in such a way that the fourth data packets have only slight visual degradations. The fourth data<br>
packets are routed to a data sink EX, such as a monitor. A supply unit ZE for this is configured as a<br>
switching element in such a way that it initially redirects only fourth data packets.<br>
 <br>
<br>
The control unit SE tests the received data packets and ascertains whether a second data packet exists. For<br>
example, the control unit SE identifies the second data packet based on an error correction code, for<br>
example a CRC test code (CRC - Check Redundancy Code), or based on a missing sequence number that<br>
shows that one of the data packets has gotten lost during the transmission over channel C. When a second<br>
data packet D2 is identified, the control unit SE activates the first mode Ml. At this point in time, a<br>
second unit E2 for processing data packets is configured and possibly also activated. If the first and<br>
second units are generated, for example, with an object-oriented programming language respectively as<br>
unit objects, then the second unit, through creation of a second unit object, e.g., a second video coding<br>
unit, and through copying of all variable values and conditions of the first unit object (= first unit) can be<br>
produced as a quasi-complete copy of the first unit<br>
In addition, the control unit SE requests those second data packets from the sender SX that are received at<br>
the control unit as third data packets error-free. It is important to mention here that these third data<br>
packets D3 are not a subset of the first data packets D1. After the point when the first mode M1 is<br>
activated, the control unit SE transfers first and third data packets to the second unit E2. The second unit<br>
E2 also performs processing, such as decoding first and third data packets into fifth data packets D5.<br>
While the first mode is active, fourth and fifth data packets are created, wherein only fourth data packets<br>
are routed to the data sink. Fourth and fifth data packets are also designated as processed data packets.<br>
After the respective corresponding data packet is present for all second data packets of the second unit E2,<br>
the control unit activates the second mode M2, whereby the first mode Ml is deactivated. At this point,<br>
the supply unit ZE switches such that, from that point on, only fifth data packets D5, instead of fourth<br>
data packets D4, are transferred to the data sink EX, i.e., the receiver. In a further variation, activation of<br>
the second mode M2 then takes place only after the first and second units E1, E2 process the same first<br>
data packet nearly simultaneously. Nearly simultaneously is understood to mean that in the first and<br>
second units, the same first data packet is processed at a given point in time, for example, the first unit has<br>
processed 95% of the first data packet and the second unit has processed 10% of the same first data<br>
packet Because the third data packets reach the control unit SE with a delay, it caches the third data<br>
packets in a cache M using a sorting unit TE and sorts the first and third data packets in such a way that<br>
first and third data packets are routed to the second unit in the correct sequence, e.g. with ascending<br>
sequence numbers. Only after the second unit has processed the same first data packet as the first unit can<br>
the second unit output the subsequent first data packets in real time. Therefore, a switch from fourth to<br>
fifth data packets for routing to the data sink can then occur without a delay being noticed at the data sink<br>
during routing of the processed data packets.<br>
 <br>
<br>
When the second mode M2 is activated, the first unit can be deactivated and/or deleted, because after this<br>
point only processed data packets from the second unit E2, i.e., fifth data packets D5, are routed to the<br>
data sink. Through deletion of the first unit, system resources are freed up for possible implementation via<br>
software.<br>
The device V according to Figure 1 includes, in addition to the control units SE, the first and second units<br>
El, E2 and the supply unit TE.<br>
Figure 2 symbolically portrays the use of the device V in the context of a surveillance installation UE.<br>
Image data are transmitted through the data packets in this example. The first and second units are a<br>
respective analysis unit for testing the image content of image data, as in personal recognition, for<br>
example. The use of first and second data packets allows real-time image analysis, but errors will be taken<br>
into account during the analysis. Through chronologically parallel analysis of first and third data packets<br>
by the second unit, optimal image analysis is ensured, because the second unit works on error-free image<br>
data. After the second mode is attained, image analysis is performed using only the second unit<br>
Therefore, not only is image analysis possible in real time, but also optimal image analysis can be<br>
achieved after routing of all third data packets, and is then also available in real time again.<br>
In addition to the device, the invention also relates to a method with the following steps that are explained<br>
in more detail based on a flow diagram according to Figure 3:<br>
STA: The flow diagram starts with step STA.<br>
S1: In step S1, it is determined whether the just-received data packet is a second data packet or represents<br>
a second data packet, i.e., is faulty itself or can be associated with a non-received data packet If the<br>
answer is no, step S1 follows again; otherwise step S2 follows.<br>
S2: In step S2, the first mode M1 is activated. First and second data packets are processed during the first<br>
mode from the first unit E1. The processed data packets, i.e. fourth data packets, are transmitted to the<br>
data sink. Step S3 follows.<br>
S3: In step S3, the second unit E2 is started up as a copy of the first unit E1. First and third data packets<br>
D1, D3 are processed through the second unit E2 into fifth data packets. Step S4 is run next<br>
S4: In step S4, it is determined whether a respective third data packet D3 has been received for each of<br>
the second data packets. If this is not the case, step S4 is repeated; otherwise it continues to step S5.<br>
 <br>
<br>
S5: In this step S5, the second mode M2 is activated. Instead of fourth data packets, fifth data packets are<br>
transmitted to the data sink. Step END runs next.<br>
END: In this step, the flow diagram ends.<br>
The invention and its further modifications can be implemented and executed in software or hardware or a<br>
combination of software and hardware. In addition to processing in the forms of image analysis and video<br>
decoding, other areas of application are possible, such as audio coding or speech coding.<br>
The invention and its further modifications have been depicted based on the first or third embodiment<br>
example. Implementation and execution of the second or fourth embodiment can be implemented<br>
similarly.<br>

<br>
The invention relates to a device and to a method for processing data packets of a data stream, in which the received<br>
data packets are processed in real-time by a first unit and only data packets that are received error-free are processed by a second<br>
unit. Data packets that are faulty or not received are requested repeatedly and routed to the second unit upon error-free receipt.<br>
A data sink initially receives only the data packets processed by the first unit. Once the second unit and first unit are processing<br>
identical data packets nearly simultaneously, only the data packets processed by the second unit are routed to the data sink.<br>
The invention can be used advantageously in video coding, for example with a video-on-demand service or image analysis within<br>
the framework of a surveillance system.<br>
