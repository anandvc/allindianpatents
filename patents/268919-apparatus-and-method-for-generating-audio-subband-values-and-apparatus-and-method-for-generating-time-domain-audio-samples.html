Apparatus and Method for Generating Audio Subband Values<br>
and Apparatus and Method for Generating Time-domain Audio<br>
Samples<br>
Technical Field<br>
Embodiments of the present invention relate to an apparatus<br>
and method for generating audio subband values, an<br>
apparatus and a method for generating time-domain audio<br>
samples and systems comprising any of the aforementioned<br>
apparatuses, which can for instance be implemented in the<br>
field of modern audio encoding, audio decoding or other<br>
audio transmission-related applications.<br>
Modern digital audio processing is typically based on<br>
coding schemes which enable a significant reduction in<br>
terms of bit rates, transmission bandwidths and storage<br>
space compared to a direct transmission or storage of the<br>
respective audio data. This is achieved by encoding the<br>
audio data on the sender side and decoding the encoded data<br>
on the receiver side before, for instance, providing the<br>
decoded audio data to a listener or to a further signal<br>
processing.<br>
Such digital audio processing systems can be implemented<br>
with respect to a wide range of parameters, typically<br>
influencing the quality of the transmitted or otherwise<br>
processed audio data, on the one hand, and computational<br>
efficiency, bandwidths and other performance-related<br>
parameters, on the other hand. Very often, higher qualities<br>
require higher bit rates, an increased computational<br>
complexity and a higher storage requirement for the<br>
corresponding encoded audio data. Hence, depending on the<br>
application in mind, factors as allowable bit rates, an<br>
acceptable computational complexity and acceptable amounts<br><br>
of data have to be balanced with a desirable and achievable<br>
quality.<br>
A further parameter, which is especially important in real-<br>
time applications such as a bi-directional or a mono-<br>
directional communication, the delay imposed by the<br>
different coding schemes may also play an important role.<br>
As a consequence, the delay imposed by the audio encoding<br>
and decoding poses a further constraint in terms of the<br>
previously mentioned parameters when balancing the needs<br>
and the costs of different coding schemes having a specific<br>
field of application in mind. As such digital audio systems<br>
can be applied in may different fields of applications<br>
ranging form ultra-low quality transmission to a high-end-<br>
transmission, different parameters and different<br>
constraints are very often imposed on the respective audio<br>
systems. In some applications, a lower delay may for<br>
instance require a higher bit rate and, hence, an increased<br>
transmission bandwidth compared to an audio system with a<br>
higher delay, as comparable quality level.<br>
However, in many cases, compromises may have to be taken in<br>
terms of different parameters such as bit rate,<br>
computational complexity, memory requirements, quality and<br>
delay.<br>
Summary<br>

values in audio subband channels comprises an analysis<br>
windower for windowing a frame of time-domain audio input<br>
samples being in a time sequence extending from an early<br>
sample to a later sample using an analysis window function<br>

audio samples comprises a calculator for calculating a<br>
sequence of intermediate time-domain samples form audio<br>
subband values in audio subband channels, wherein the<br>
sequence comprises earlier intermediate time-domain samples<br>
and later intermediate time-domain samples. Moreover, an<br>
embodiment of the apparatus comprises a synthesis windower<br>
for windowing the sequence of intermediate time-domain<br>
samples using a synthesis window function, comprising a<br>

intermediate time-domain samples, wherein the synthesis<br>
window function comprises a first group of window<br>
coefficients comprising a first portion of the sequence of<br>
window coefficients and a second group of window<br>
coefficients comprising a second portion of the sequence of<br>
window coefficients. The first portion comprises less<br>
window coefficients than the second portion and an energy<br>
value of the window coefficients in the first portion is<br>
higher than the energy value of the window coefficients of<br>
the second portion. The first group of window coefficients<br>

stage for processing the windowed intermediate time-domain<br>
samples to obtain the time-domain samples.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
Figs. 1 to 19 show block diagrams and further diagrams<br>
describing the functional properties and features of<br>
different embodiments of apparatuses and methods for<br>
generating audio subband values, of apparatuses and methods<br>
for generating time-domain samples and systems comprising<br>
at least one of the aforementioned apparatuses or methods.<br>
However, before describing a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention in more detail, it should be noted that<br>
embodiments of the present invention can be implemented in<br>
hardware and in software. Hence, implementations described<br>
in terms of block diagrams of hardware implementations of<br>
respective embodiments can also be considered as flowcharts<br>
of an appropriate embodiment of a corresponding method.<br>
Also, a flowchart describing an embodiment of the present<br>
invention can be considered to be a block diagram of a<br>
corresponding hardware implementation.<br>
In the following, implementations of filterbanks will be<br>
described, which can be implemented as an analysis<br>
filterbank or a synthesis filterbank. An analysis<br>
filterbank is an apparatus for generating audio subband<br>
values in audio subband channels based on time-domain audio<br>
(input) samples being in a time sequence extending from an<br>
early sample to a later sample. In other words, the term<br>
analysis filterbank can be synonymously used for an<br>
embodiment of the present invention in the form of an<br>
apparatus for generating audio subband values. Accordingly,<br>
a synthesis filterbank is a filterbank for generating time-<br>
domain audio samples from audio subband values in audio<br>
subband channels. In other words, the term synthesis<br>
filterbank can be used synonymously for an embodiment<br>
according to the present invention in the form of an<br>
apparatus for generating time-domain audio samples.<br>
Both, an analysis filterbank and a synthesis filterbank,<br>
which are also referred to summarizing as filterbanks, may<br><br>
for instance be implemented as modulated filterbanks.<br>
Modulated filterbanks, examples and embodiments of which<br>
will be outlined in more detail below, are based on an<br>
oscillations having frequencies which are based on or<br>
derived from center frequencies of corresponding subbands<br>
in the frequency-domain. The term "modulated" refers in<br>
this context to the fact that the aforementioned<br>
oscillations are used in context with a window function or<br>
a prototype filter function, depending on the concrete<br>
implementation of such a modulated filterbank. Modulated<br>
filterbanks can in principle be based on real-valued<br>
oscillations such as a harmonic oscillation (sine-<br>
oscillation or cosine-oscillation) or corresponding<br>
complex-valued oscillations (complex exponential<br>
oscillations). Accordingly, the modulated filterbanks are<br>
referred to as real modulated filterbanks or complex filter<br>
modulated filterbanks, respectively.<br>
In the following description, embodiments of the present<br>
invention in the form of complex modulated low-delay<br>
filterbanks and real modulated low-delay filterbanks and<br>
corresponding methods and software implementations will be<br>
described in more detail. One of the main applications of<br>
such modulated low-delay filterbanks is an integration into<br>
a low-delay spectral band replication system (SBR), which<br>
currently is based on using a complex QMF filterbank with a<br>
symmetric prototype filter (QMF = Quadrature Mirror<br>
Filter).<br>
As will become apparent in the framework of the present<br>
description, an implementation of low-delay filterbanks<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention will<br>
provide the advantage of an improved trade-off between<br>
delay, frequency response, temporal noise spreading and<br>
reconstruction quality.<br>
The aforementioned improved trade-off, especially between<br>
delay and reconstruction quality, is based on an approach<br><br>
to make use of so-called zero-delay techniques to extend<br>
the filter impulse response of the respective filterbanks<br>
without introducing additional delay. A lower delay at a<br>
predefined quality level, a better quality at a predefined<br>
delay level or a simultaneous improvement of both the delay<br>
and the quality, can be achieved by employing an analysis<br>
filterbank or a synthesis filterbank according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are based on the<br>
finding that these improvements can be achieved by<br>
employing a new window function for any of the two<br>
filterbanks described before. In other words, the quality<br>
and/or the delay can be improved in the case of an analysis<br>
filterbank by employing an analysis window function<br>
comprising a sequence of window coefficients, which<br>
comprises a first group comprising a first consecutive<br>
portion of the sequence of window coefficients and the<br>
second group of window coefficients comprising a second<br>
consecutive portion of the sequence of window coefficients.<br>
The first portion and the second portion comprise all<br>
window coefficients of the window function. Moreover, the<br>
first portion comprises less window coefficients than the<br>
second portion but an energy value of the window<br>
coefficients in the first portion is higher than an energy<br>
value of the window coefficients of the second portion. The<br>
first group of window coefficients is used for windowing<br>
later time-domain samples and the second group of window<br>
coefficients is used for windowed earlier time-domain<br>
samples. This form of the window function provides the<br>
opportunity of processing time-domain samples with window<br>
coefficients having higher energy values earlier. This is a<br>
result of the described distribution of window coefficients<br>
to the two portions and their application to the sequence<br>
of time-domain audio samples. As a consequence, employing<br>
such a window function can reduce the delay introduced by<br>
the filterbank at a constant quality level or enables an<br>
improved quality level based on a constant delay level.<br><br>
Accordingly, in the case of an embodiment of the present<br>
invention in the form of an apparatus for generating time-<br>
domain audio samples and a corresponding method, a<br>
synthesis windower uses a synthesis window function, which<br>
comprises a sequence of window coefficients ordered<br>
correspondingly in a first (consecutive) portion and<br>
(consecutive) second portion. Also in the case of a<br>
synthesis window function, an energy value or an overall<br>
energy value of a window coefficient in the first portion<br>
is higher than an energy value or an overall energy value<br>
of a window coefficient of a second portion, wherein the<br>
first portion comprises less window coefficients than the<br>
second portion. Due to this distribution of the window<br>
coefficients among the two portions and the fact that the<br>
synthesis windower uses the first portion of windower<br>
coefficients for windowing later time-domain samples and<br>
the second portion of window coefficients for windowing<br>
earlier time-domain samples, the previously described<br>
effects and advantages also apply to a synthesis filterbank<br>
or a corresponding embodiment of a method.<br>
Detailed descriptions of synthesis window functions and<br>
analysis window functions employed in the framework of<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
later in more detail. In many embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the sequence of window coefficients of the<br>
synthesis window function and/or of the analysis window<br>
function comprise exactly the first group and the second<br>
group of window coefficients. Moreover, each of the window<br>
coefficients of the sequence of window coefficients belongs<br>
exactly to one of the first group and the second group of<br>
window coefficients.<br>
Each of the two groups comprises exactly one portion of the<br>
sequence of window coefficients in a consecutive manner. In<br>
the present description, a portion comprises a consecutive<br>
set of window coefficients according to the sequence of the<br><br>
window coefficients. In embodiments according to the<br>
present invention, each of the two groups (first and second<br>
group) comprises exactly one portion of the sequence of the<br>
window coefficients in the above-explained manner. The<br>
respective groups of window coefficients do not comprise<br>
any window coefficients, which do not belong to the exactly<br>
one portion of the respective group. In other word, in many<br>
embodiments of the present invention, each of the first and<br>
the second group of window coefficients comprises only the<br>
first portion and the second portion of window coefficients<br>
without comprising further window coefficients.<br>
In the framework of the present description, a consecutive<br>
portion of the sequence of window coefficients is to be<br>
understood as a connected set of window coefficients in the<br>
mathematical sense, wherein the set does not lack window<br>
coefficients compared to the sequence of window<br>
coefficients, which would be lying in a range (e.g. index<br>
range) of the window coefficients of the respective<br>
portion. As a consequence, in many embodiments of the<br>
present invention, the sequence of window coefficients is<br>
divided exactly into two connected portions of window<br>
coefficients, which form each one of the first or the<br>
second groups of window coefficients. In these cases, each<br>
window coefficient comprised in the first group of window<br>
coefficients is either arranged before or after each of the<br>
window coefficients of the second group of window<br>
coefficients with respect to the overall sequence of the<br>
window coefficients.<br>
In yet other words, in many embodiments according to the<br>
present invention the sequence of window coefficients is<br>
divided exactly into two groups or portions without leaving<br>
any window coefficients out. According to the sequence of<br>
the window coefficients, which also represents also an<br>
order of these, each of the two groups or portions comprise<br>
all window coefficients up to (but excluding) or beginning<br>
from (including) a border window coefficient. As an<br><br>
example, the first portion or first group may comprise<br>
window coefficients having indices from 0 to 95 and from 96<br>
to 639 in the case of a window function comprising 640<br>
window coefficients (having indices of 0 to 639). Here, the<br>
border window coefficient would be that corresponding to<br>
index 96. Naturally, other examples are also possible (e.g.<br>
0 to 543 and 544 to 639).<br>
The detailed exampled implementation of an analysis<br>
filterbank described in the following provides a filter<br>
length covering 10 blocks of input samples while causing a<br>
system delay of only 2 blocks, which is the corresponding<br>
delay as introduced by a MDCT (modified discrete cosine<br>
transform) or a MDST (modified discrete sine transform).<br>
One difference is due to the longer filter length covering<br>
10 blocks of input samples compared to an implementation of<br>
a MDCT or MDST that the overlap is increased from 1 block<br>
in the case of MDCT and MDST to an overlap of 9 blocks.<br>
However, further implementations can also be realized<br>
covering a different number of blocks of input samples,<br>
which are also referred to as audio input samples.<br>
Moreover, other trade-offs can also be considered and<br>
implemented.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of an analysis filterbank 100<br>
as an embodiment of an apparatus for generating audio<br>
subband values in audio subband channels. The analysis<br>
filterbank 100 comprises an analysis windower 110 for<br>
windowing a frame 120 of time-domain audio input samples.<br>
The frame 120 comprises T blocks 130-1, ..., 130-T blocks<br>
of time-domain audio (input) samples, wherein T is a<br>
positive integer and equal to 10 in the case of the<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 1. However, the frame 120 may also<br>
comprise a different number of blocks 130.<br>
Both, the frame 120 and each of the blocks 130 comprises<br>
time-domain audio input samples in a time sequence<br>
extending from an early sample to a late sample according<br><br>
to a time line as indicated by an arrow 140 in Fig. 1. In<br>
other words, in the illustration as shown in Fig. 1, the<br>
further the time-domain audio sample, which in this case is<br>
also a time-domain audio input sample, is to the right, the<br>
later the corresponding time-domain audio sample is with<br>
respect to the sequence of the time-domain audio sample.<br>
The analysis windower 110 generates based on the sequence<br>
of time-domain audio samples windowed samples in the time-<br>
domain, which are arranged in a frame 150 of windowed<br>
samples. According to the frame 120 of time-domain audio<br>
input samples, also the frame of windowed samples 150<br>
comprises T blocks of windowed samples 160-1, ..., 160-T.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention each of<br>
the blocks of windowed samples 160 comprises the same<br>
number of windowed samples as the number of time-domain<br>
audio input samples of each block 130 of time-domain audio<br>
input samples. Hence, when each of the blocks 130 comprises<br>
N time-domain input audio samples, the frame 120 and the<br>
frame 150 each comprise T N samples. In this case, N is a<br>
positive integer, which may, for instance, acquire the<br>
values of 32 or 64. For T = 10, the frames 120, 150 each<br>
comprise 320 and 640, respectively, in the case above.<br>
The analysis window 110 is coupled to a calculator 170 for<br>
calculating the audio subband values based on the windowed<br>
samples provided by the analysis windower 110. The audio<br>
subband values are provided by the calculator 170 as a<br>
block 180 of audio subband values, wherein each of the<br>
audio subband values corresponds to one audio subband<br>
channel. In a preferred embodiment, also the block 180 of<br>
audio subband values comprises N subband values.<br>
Each of the audio subband channels corresponds to a<br>
characteristic center frequency. The center frequencies of<br>
the different audio subband channels may, for instance, be<br>
equally distributed or equally spaced with respect to the<br>
frequency bandwidth of the corresponding audio signal as<br><br>
described by the time-domain audio input samples provided<br>
to the analysis filterbank 100.<br>
The analysis windower 110 is adapted to windowing the time-<br>
domain audio input samples of the frame 120 based on an<br>
analysis window function comprising a sequence of window<br>
coefficients to obtain the windowed samples of the frame<br>
150. The analysis window 110 is adapted to performing the<br>
windowing of the frame of time-domain audio samples 120 by<br>
multiplying the values of the time-domain audio samples<br>
with the window coefficients of the analysis window<br>
function. In other words, the windowing comprises and<br>
element-wise multiplying of the time-domain audio samples<br>
with a corresponding window coefficient. As both, the frame<br>
120 of time-domain audio samples and the window<br>
coefficients comprise a corresponding sequence, the<br>
element-wise multiplication of the window coefficients and<br>
the time-domain audio samples is carried out according to<br>
the respective sequences, for instance, as indicated by a<br>
sample and window coefficient index.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention in the form of an<br>
analysis filterbank 100 as shown in Fig. 1, the analysis<br>
window function, as well as the synthesis window function<br>
in the case of a synthesis filterbank, comprises real-<br>
valued windowed coefficients only. In other words, each of<br>
the window coefficients attributed to a window coefficient<br>
index is a real value.<br>
The window coefficients together form the respective window<br>
function, an example of which is shown in Fig. 1 as an<br>
analysis window function 190. As outlined before, the<br>
sequence of window coefficients forming the analysis window<br>
function 190 comprises a first group 200 and a second group<br>
210 of window coefficients. The first group 200 comprises a<br>
first consecutive and connected portion of the window<br>
coefficients of the sequence of window coefficients,<br>
whereas the second group 210 comprises a consecutive and<br><br>
connected second portion of a window coefficient., Together<br>
with the first portion in the first group 200, they form<br>
the whole sequence of window coefficients of the analysis<br>
window function 190. Moreover, each window coefficient of<br>
the sequence of window coefficients belongs either to the<br>
first portion or the second portion of window coefficients<br>
so that the whole analysis window function 190 is made up<br>
by the window coefficient of the first portion and the<br>
second portion. The first portion of window coefficients<br>
is, hence, identical to the first group 200 of window<br>
coefficients and the second portion is identical to the<br>
second group 210 of window coefficients as indicated by the<br>
corresponding arrows 200, 210 in Fig. 1.<br>
The number of window coefficients in the first group 200 of<br>
the first portion of window coefficients is smaller than<br>
the number of window coefficients in the second group of<br>
the second portion of window coefficients. However, an<br>
energy value or a total energy value of the window<br>
coefficients in the first group 200 is higher than an<br>
energy value or total energy value of the window<br>
coefficients in the second group 210. As will be outlined<br>
later, an energy value of a set of window coefficients is<br>
based on a sum of the squares of the absolute values of the<br>
corresponding window coefficients.<br>
In embodiments according to the present invention, the<br>
analysis window function 190 as well as a corresponding<br>
synthesis window function is therefore asymmetric with<br>
respect to the sequence of window coefficients or an index<br>
of a window coefficient. Based on a definition set of<br>
window coefficient indices over which the analysis window<br>
function 190 is defined, the analysis window function 190<br>
is asymmetric, when for all real numbers n a further real<br>
number n0 exists so that the absolute value of window<br>
coefficient corresponding to the window coefficient of the<br>
window coefficient index (n0 - n) is not equal to the<br>
absolute value of the window coefficient corresponding to<br><br>
the window coefficient index (n0 + n), when (n0 - n) and (n0<br>
+ n) belong to the definition set.<br>
Moreover, as also schematically shown in Fig. 1, the<br>
analysis window function 190 comprises sign changes at<br>
which the product of two consecutive window coefficients is<br>
negative. More details and further features of possible<br>
window functions according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention will be discussed in more detail in the context<br>
of Figs. 11 to 19.<br>
As indicated earlier, the frame of windowed samples 150<br>
comprises a similar block structure with individual blocks<br>
160-1, ..., 160-T as the frame 120 of individual time-<br>
domain input samples. As the analysis windower 110 is<br>
adapted to windowing the time-domain audio input samples by<br>
multiplying these values with the window coefficients of<br>
the analysis window function 190, the frame 150 of windowed<br>
samples is also in the time-domain. The calculator 170<br>
calculates the audio subband values, or to be more precise,<br>
the block 180 of audio subband values using the frame 150<br>
of windowed samples and performs a transfer from the time-<br>
domain into the frequency-domain. The calculator 170 can<br>
therefore be considered to be a time/frequency converter,<br>
which is capable of providing the block 180 of audio<br>
subband values as a spectral representation of the frame<br>
150 of windowed samples.<br>
Each audio subband value of the block 180 corresponds to<br>
one subband having a characteristic frequency. The number<br>
of audio subband values comprised in the block 180 is also<br>
sometimes referred to as a band number.<br>
In many embodiments according to the present invention, the<br>
number of audio subband values in block 180 is identical to<br>
the number of time-domain audio input samples of each of<br>
the blocks 130 of the frame 120. In the case that the frame<br>
150 of windowed samples comprises the same block-wise<br><br>
structure as the frame 120 so that each of the blocks 160<br>
of windowed samples also comprise the same number of<br>
windowed samples as the block of these time-domain audio<br>
input samples 130, the block 180 of audio subband values<br>
naturally also comprises the same number as the block 160.<br>
The frame 120 can optionally be generated, based on a block<br>
of fresh time-domain audio input samples 220 by shifting<br>
the blocks 130-1, ..., 130-(T-l) by one block in the<br>
opposite direction of the arrow 140 indicating the time-<br>
direction. Thereby, a frame 120 of time-domain audio input<br>
samples to be processed is generated by shifting the (T-l)<br>
latest blocks of a directly preceding frame 120 of time-<br>
domain audio samples by one block towards the earlier time-<br>
domain audio samples and by adding the fresh block 220 of<br>
fresh time-domain audio samples as the new block 130-1<br>
comprising the latest time-domain audio samples of the<br>
present frame 120. In Fig. 1 this is also indicated by a<br>
series of dashed arrows 230 indicating shifting the blocks<br>
130-1, ..., 130-(T-l) in the opposite direction of the<br>
arrow 140.<br>
Due to this shifting of the blocks 130 in the opposite<br>
direction of the time as indicated by arrow 140, a present<br>
frame 120 to be processed, comprises the block 130-(T-l) of<br>
the directly preceding frame 120 as the new block 130-T.<br>
Accordingly, the blocks 130-(T-l), ..., 130-2 of the<br>
present frame 120 to be processed are equal to the block<br>
130- (T-2), ..., 130-1 of the directly preceding frame 120.<br>
The block 130-T of the directly preceding frame 120 is<br>
discarded.<br>
As a consequence, each time-domain audio sample of the<br>
fresh block 220 will be processed T-times in the framework<br>
of T consecutive processings of T consecutive frames 120 of<br>
time-domain audio input samples. Hence, each time-domain<br>
audio input sample of the fresh block 220 contributes, not<br>
only to T different frames 120, but also to T different<br><br>
frames 150 of windowed samples and T blocks 180 of audio<br>
subband values. As indicated before, in a preferred<br>
embodiment according to the present invention, the number<br>
of blocks T in the frame 120 is equal to 10, so that each<br>
time-domain audio sample provided to the analysis<br>
filterbank 100 contributes to 10 different blocks 180 of<br>
audio subband values.<br>
In the beginning, before a single frame 120 is processed by<br>
the analysis filterbank 100, the frame 120 can be<br>
initialized to a small absolute value (below a<br>
predetermined threshold), for instance the value 0. As will<br>
be explained in more detail below, the shape of the<br>
analysis window function 190 comprises a center point or a<br>
"center of mass", which typically corresponds to or lies<br>
between two window coefficient indices of the first group<br>
200.<br>
As a consequence, the number of fresh blocks 220 to be<br>
inserted into the frame 120 is small, before the frame 120<br>
is filled at least to a point so that portions of the frame<br>
120 are occupied by non-vanishing (i.e. non-zero-valued)<br>
values which correspond to window coefficients having a<br>
significant contribution in terms of their energy values.<br>
Typically, the number of blocks to be inserted into frame<br>
120 before a "meaningful" processing can begin, is 2 to 4<br>
blocks depending on the shape of the analysis window<br>
function 190. Hence, the analysis filterbank 100 is capable<br>
of providing blocks 180 faster than a corresponding<br>
filterbank employing, for instance, a symmetric window<br>
function. As typically the fresh blocks 220 are provided to<br>
the analysis filterbank 100 as a whole, each of the fresh<br>
blocks corresponds to a recording or sampling time, which<br>
is essentially given by the length of the block 220 (i.e.<br>
the number of time-domain audio input samples comprised in<br>
block 220) and the sampling rate or sampling frequency.<br>
Therefore, analysis window function 190, as incorporated<br>
into an embodiment of the present invention, leads to a<br><br>
reduced delay before the first and the following blocks 180<br>
of audio subband values can be provided or output by the<br>
filterbank 100.<br>
As a further option, the apparatus 100 can be capable of<br>
generating a signal or incorporating a piece of information<br>
concerning the analysis window function 190 used in<br>
generating the frame 180 or concerning a synthesis window<br>
function to be used in the framework of a synthesis<br>
filterbank. Thus, the analysis filter function 190 can, for<br>
instance, be a time- or index-reversed version of the<br>
synthesis window function to be used by the synthesis<br>
filterbank.<br>
Fig. 2a shows a block diagram of an embodiment of an<br>
apparatus 300 for generating time-domain audio samples<br>
based on the block of audio subband values. As previously<br>
explained, an embodiment of the present invention in the<br>
form of an apparatus 300 for generating time-domain audio<br>
samples is often also referred to as a synthesis filterbank<br>
300 as the apparatus is capable of generating time-domain<br>
audio samples, which can in principle be played back, based<br>
on audio subband values which comprise spectral information<br>
concerning an audio signal. Hence, the synthesis filterbank<br>
300 is capable of synthesizing time-domain audio samples<br>
based on audio subband values, which can for instance be<br>
generated by a corresponding analysis filterbank 100.<br>
Fig. 2a shows a block diagram of the synthesis filterbank<br>
300 comprising a calculator 310 to which a block 320 of<br>
audio subband values (in the frequency-domain) is provided.<br>
The calculator 310 is capable of calculating a frame 330<br>
comprising a sequence of intermediate time-domain samples<br>
from the audio subband values of the block 320. The frame<br>
330 of intermediate time-domain samples comprises in many<br>
embodiments according to the present invention also a<br>
similar block structure as for instance the frame 150 of<br>
windowed samples of the analysis filterbank 100 of Fig. 1.<br><br>
In these cases, the frame 330 comprises blocks 340-1, ...,<br>
340-T blocks of intermediate time-domain samples.<br>
The sequence of intermediate time-domain samples of the<br>
frame 330, as well as each block 340 of intermediate time-<br>
domain samples comprise an order according to the time as<br>
indicated by an arrow 350 in Fig. 2a. As a consequence, the<br>
frame 330 comprises an early intermediate time-domain<br>
sample in block 340-T and a latest intermediate time-domain<br>
sample in block 340-1, which represent the first and the<br>
last intermediate time-domain sample for the frame 330,<br>
respectively. Also each of the blocks 340 comprises a<br>
similar order. As a consequence, in embodiments of a<br>
synthesis filterbank the terms "frame" and "sequence" can<br>
often be used synonymously.<br>
The calculator 310 is coupled to a synthesis windower 360<br>
to which the frame 330 of intermediate time-domain samples<br>
is provided. The synthesis windower is adapted to windowing<br>
the sequence of intermediate time-domain samples using a<br>
synthesis window function 370 schematically depicted in<br>
Fig. 2a. As an output, the synthesis windower 360 provides<br>
a frame 380 of windowed intermediate time-domain samples,<br>
which may also comprise a block-wise structure of blocks<br>
390-1, ..., 390-T.<br>
The frames 330 and 380 may comprise T blocks 340 and 390,<br>
respectively, wherein T is a positive integer. In a<br>
preferred embodiment according to the present invention in<br>
the form of a synthesis filterbank 300, the number of<br>
blocks T is equal to 10. However, in different embodiments,<br>
also different numbers of blocks may be comprised in one of<br>
the frames. To be more precise, in principle the number of<br>
blocks T may be larger or equal to 3, or larger than or<br>
equal to 4, depending on the circumstances of the<br>
implementation and the previously explained trade-offs for<br>
embodiments according to the present invention comprising a<br><br>
block-wise structure of frames for both a synthesis<br>
filterbank 100 and a synthesis filterbank 300.<br>
The synthesis windower 360 is coupled to an overlap-adder<br>
output stage 400, to which the frame 380 of windowed<br>
intermediate time-domain samples is provided. The overlap-<br>
adder output stage 400 is capable of processing the<br>
windowed intermediate time-domain samples to obtain a block<br>
410 of time-domain samples. The block 410 of the time-<br>
domain (output) samples can then for instance be provided<br>
to further components for further processing, storing or<br>
transforming into audible audio signals.<br>
The calculator 310 for calculating the sequence of time-<br>
domain samples comprised in the frame 330 is capable of<br>
transferring data from the frequency-domain into the time-<br>
domain. Therefore, the calculator 310 may comprise a<br>
frequency/time converter capable of generating a time-<br>
domain signal of the spectral representation comprised in<br>
the block 320 of audio subband values. As was explained in<br>
the context of the calculator 170 of the analysis<br>
filterbank 100 shown in Fig. 1, each of the audio subband<br>
values of the block 320 corresponds to an audio subband<br>
channel having a characteristic center frequency.<br>
In contrast to this, the intermediate time-domain samples<br>
comprised in the frame 330 represent in principle<br>
information in the time-domain. The synthesis windower 360<br>
is capable and adapted to windowing the sequence of<br>
intermediate time-domain samples comprised in the frame 330<br>
using the synthesis window function 370 as schematically<br>
depicted in Fig. 2a. The synthesis window function 370<br>
comprises a sequence of window coefficients, which also<br>
comprises a first group 420 and a second group 430 of<br>
window coefficients as previously explained in the context<br>
of the window function 190 with a first group 200 and a<br>
second group 210 of window coefficients.<br><br>
The first group 420 of window coefficients of the synthesis<br>
window function 370 comprises a first consecutive portion<br>
of the sequence of window coefficients. Similarly, the<br>
second group 430 of coefficients also comprises a second<br>
consecutive portion of the sequence of window coefficients,<br>
wherein the first portion comprises less window<br>
coefficients than the second portion and wherein an energy<br>
value or total energy value of the window coefficients in<br>
the first portion is higher than the corresponding energy<br>
value of the window coefficients of the second portion.<br>
Further features and properties of the synthesis window<br>
function 370 may be similar to the corresponding features<br>
and properties of the analysis window function 190 as<br>
schematically depicted in Fig. 1. As a consequence,<br>
reference is hereby made to the corresponding description<br>
in the framework of the analysis window function 190 and<br>
the further description of the window functions with<br>
respect to Figs. 11 to 19, wherein the first group 200<br>
corresponds to the first group 420 and the second group 210<br>
corresponds to the second group 430.<br>
For instance the portions comprised in the two groups 420,<br>
430 of window coefficients typically each form a<br>
consecutive and connected set of window coefficients<br>
together comprising all window coefficients of the sequence<br>
of window coefficients of the window function 370. In many<br>
embodiments according to the present invention, the<br>
analysis window function 190 as depicted in Fig. 1 and the<br>
synthesis window function 370 as depicted in Fig. 2a are<br>
based on each other. For instance, the analysis window<br>
function 190 may be a time-reversed or index-reversed<br>
version of the synthesis window function 370. However, also<br>
other relations between the two window functions 190, 370<br>
may be possible. It may be advisable to employ a synthesis<br>
window function 370 in the framework of the synthesis<br>
windower 360, which is related to the analysis window<br>
function 190, which was employed in the course of<br>
generating (optionally before further modifications) of the<br><br>
block 320 of audio subband vales provided to the synthesis<br>
filterbank 300.<br>
As outlined in the context of Fig. 1, the synthesis<br>
filterbank 300 in Fig. 2a may optionally be adapted such<br>
that the incoming block 320 may comprise additional signals<br>
or additional pieces of information concerning the window<br>
functions. As an example, the block 320 may comprise<br>
information concerning the analysis window function 190<br>
used for generating the block 320 or concerning the<br>
synthesis window function 370 to be used by the synthesis<br>
windower 360. Hence, the filterbank 300 may be adapted to<br>
isolating the respective information and to provide these<br>
to the synthesis windower 360.<br>
The overlap-adder output stage 400 is capable of generating<br>
the block 410 of time-domain samples by processing the<br>
windowed intermediate time-domain samples comprised in the<br>
frame 380. In different embodiments according to the<br>
present invention, the overlap-adder output stage 4000 may<br>
comprise a memory for temporarily storing previously<br>
received frames 380 of windowed intermediate time-domain<br>
samples. Depending on implementational details, the<br>
overlap-adder output stage 400 may for instance comprise T<br>
different storage positions comprised in the memory for<br>
storing an overall number of T frames 380 of windowed<br>
intermediate time-domain samples. However, also a different<br>
number of storage positions may be comprised in the<br>
overlap-adder output stage 400 as required. Moreover, in<br>
different embodiments according to the present invention,<br>
the overlap-adder output stage 400 may be capable of<br>
providing the block 410 of time-domain samples based on a<br>
single frame 380 of intermediate time-domain samples alone.<br>
Embodiments of different synthesis filterbanks 300 will be<br>
explained in more detail later.<br>
Fig. 2b illustrates a functional principle according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention in the form of a<br><br>
synthesis filterbank 300. The block 320 of audio subband<br>
values is first transferred from the frequency-domain into<br>
the time-domain by the calculator 310, which is illustrated<br>
in Fig. 2b by an arrow 440. The resulting frame 320 of<br>
intermediate time-domain samples comprising the blocks 340-<br>
1, ..., 340-T of intermediate time-domain samples is then<br>
windowed by the synthesis windower 360 (not shown in Fig.<br>
2b) by multiplying the sequence of intermediate time-domain<br>
samples of the frame 320 with the sequence of window<br>
coefficients of the synthesis window function 370 to obtain<br>
the frame 380 of windowed intermediate time-domain samples.<br>
The frame 380 again comprises the blocks 390-1, ..., 390-T<br>
of windowed intermediate time-domain samples, together<br>
forming the frame 380 of windowed intermediate time-domain<br>
samples.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2b of an inventive<br>
synthesis filterbank 300, the overlap-adder output stage<br>
400 is then capable of generating the block 410 of time-<br>
domain output samples by adding for each index value of the<br>
time-domain audio samples of the block 410, the windowed<br>
intermediate time-domain samples of one block 390 of<br>
different frames 380. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the time-<br>
domain audio samples of the block 410 are obtained by<br>
adding for each audio sample index one windowed<br>
intermediate time-domain sample of block 390-1 of the frame<br>
380, processed by the synthesis windower 360 in the current<br>
round and as previously described, the corresponding<br>
intermediate time-domain sample of the second block 390-2<br>
of a frame 380-1 processed immediately before frame 380 and<br>
stored in a storage position in the overlap-adder output<br>
stage 400. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, further corresponding<br>
windowed intermediate time-domain samples of further blocks<br>
390 (e.g. block 390-3 of frame 380-2, block 390-4 of frame<br>
380-3, block 390-5 of frame 380-4) processed by the<br>
synthesis filterbank 300 before may be used. The frames<br>
380-2, 380-3, 380-4 and optionally further frames 380 have<br>
been processed by the synthesis filterbank 300 in previous<br><br>
rounds. The frame 380-2 has been immediately processed<br>
before the frame 380-1 and, accordingly, frame 380-3 was<br>
immediately generated before frame 380-2 and so on.<br>
The overlap-adder output stage 400 as employed in the<br>
embodiment is capable of summing up for each index of the<br>
block 410 of time-domain (output) samples T different<br>
blocks 390-1, ..., 390-T of windowed intermediate time-<br>
domain samples from T different frames 380, 380-1, ...,<br>
380-(T-l). Hence, apart from the first T blocks processed,<br>
each of the time-domain (output) samples of the block 410<br>
is based on T different blocks 320 of audio subband values.<br>
As in the case of the embodiment of the present invention<br>
an analysis filterbank 100 described in Fig. 1, due to the<br>
form of the synthesis window function 370, the synthesis<br>
filterbank 300 offers the possibility of quickly providing<br>
the block 410 of time-domain (output) samples. This is also<br>
a consequence of the form of the window function 370. As<br>
The first group 420 of window coefficients correspond to a<br>
higher energy value and comprise less window coefficients<br>
than the second group 430, the synthesis windower 360 is<br>
capable of providing "meaningful" frames 380 of windowed<br>
samples when the frame 330 of intermediate time-domain<br>
samples is filled so that at least the window coefficients<br>
of the first group 420 contribute to the frame 380. The<br>
window coefficients of the second group 430 exhibit a<br>
smaller contribution due to their smaller energy value.<br>
Therefore, when at the beginning, the synthesis filterbank<br>
300 is initialized with 0, the provision of blocks 410 can<br>
in principle, be started when only a few blocks 320 of<br>
audio subband values have been received by the synthesis<br>
filterbank 300. Therefore, also the synthesis filterbank<br>
300 enables significant delay reduction compared to the<br>
synthesis filterbank having for instance a symmetric<br>
synthesis window function.<br><br>
As indicated earlier, the calculators 170 and 310 of the<br>
embodiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2a can be implemented as<br>
real-valued calculators generating or being capable of<br>
processing real-valued audio subband values of the blocks<br>
180 and 320, respectively. In these cases, the calculators<br>
may for instance be implemented as real-valued calculators<br>
based on harmonic oscillating functions such as the sine-<br>
function or the cosine-function. However, also complex-<br>
valued calculators can be implemented as the calculators<br>
170, 310. In these cases the calculators may for instance<br>
be implemented on the basis of complex exponential-<br>
functions or other harmonic complex-valued functions. The<br>
frequency of the real-valued or complex-valued oscillations<br>
usually depends on the index of the audio subband value,<br>
which is sometimes also referred to as the band index or<br>
the subband index of the specific subband. Moreover, the<br>
frequency may be identical or depend on the center<br>
frequency of the corresponding subband. For instance, the<br>
frequency of the oscillation may be multiplied by a<br>
constant factor, shifted with respect to the center<br>
frequency of the corresponding subband or may be depending<br>
on a combination of both modifications.<br>
A complex-valued calculator 170, 310 may be constructed or<br>
implemented based on real-value calculators. For instance,<br>
for a complex-valued calculator an efficient implementation<br>
can in principle be used for both, the cosine- and the<br>
sine-modulated part of a filterbank representing the real<br>
and the imaginary part of a complex-valued component. This<br>
means that it is possible to implement both, the cosine-<br>
modulated part and the sine-modulated part based on, for<br>
instance, the modified DCT-IV- and DST-IV-structures.<br>
Moreover, further implementations might employ the use of a<br>
FFT (FFT = Fast Fourier Transform) optionally being<br>
implemented jointly for both, the real part and the part of<br>
the complex-modulated calculators using one FFT or instead<br>
using one separate FFT stage for each transform.<br><br>
Mathematical Description<br>
The following sections will describe an example of the<br>
embodiments of an analysis filterbank and the synthesis<br>
filterbank with multiple overlaps of 8 blocks to the part,<br>
which do not cause further delay, as explained above, and<br>
one block to the future, which causes the same delay as for<br>
a MDCT/MDST-structure (MDCT = Modified Discrete Cosine<br>
Transform; MDST = Modified Discrete Sine Transform). In<br>
other words, in the following example, the parameter T is<br>
equal to 10.<br>
First, a description of a complex-modulated low-delay<br>
analysis filterbank will be given. As illustrated in Fig.<br>
1, the analysis filterbank 100 comprises the transformation<br>
steps of an analysis windowing performed by the analysis<br>
windower 110 and an analysis modulation performed by the<br>
calculator 170. The analysis windowing is based on the<br>
equation<br><br>
wherein, z1,n is the (real-valued) windowed sample<br>
corresponding to the block index i and the sample index n<br>
of the frame 150 shown in Fig. 1. The value x1,n is the<br>
(real-valued) time input sample corresponding to the same<br>
block index i and sample index n. The analysis window<br>
function 190 is represented in equation (1) by its real-<br>
valued window coefficients w(n), wherein n is also the<br>
window coefficient index in the range indicated in equation<br>
(1) . As already previously explained, the parameter N is<br>
the number of samples in one block 220, 130, 160, 180.<br>
From the arguments of the analysis window function w(10N-l-<br>
n) can be seen that the analysis window function represents<br>
a flipped version or a time-reversed version of the<br><br>
synthesis window function, which is actually represented by<br>
the window coefficient w(n).<br>
The analysis modulation carried out by the calculator 170<br>
in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, is based on the two<br>
equations<br><br>
for the spectral coefficient index or band index k being an<br>
integer in the range of<br><br>
The values XReal,i,k and Ximag,i,k represent the real part and<br>
the imaginary part of the complex-valued audio subband<br>
value corresponding to the block index i and the spectral<br>
coefficient index k of block 180. The parameter n0<br>
represents an index option, which is equal to<br><br>
The corresponding complex-modulated low-delay synthesis<br>
filterbank comprises the transformation steps of a<br>
synthesis modulation, a synthesis windowing and an overlap-<br>
add as will be described.<br>
The synthesis modulation is based on the equation<br><br><br>
wherein x'i,n is an intermediate time-domain sample of the<br>
frame 330 corresponding to the sample index n and the block<br>
index i. Once again the parameter N is an integer<br>
indicating the length of the block 320, 340, 390, 410,<br>
which is also referred to as transform block length or, due<br>
to the block-wise structure of the frames 330, 380, as an<br>
offset to the previous block. Also the further variables<br>
and parameters have been introduced above, such as the<br>
spectral coefficient index k and the offset no.<br>
The synthesis windowing carried out by the synthesis<br>
windower 360 in the embodiment shown in Fig. 2a is based on<br>
the equation<br><br>
wherein z'i,n is the value of the windowed intermediate<br>
time-domain sample corresponding to the sample index n and<br>
the block index i of the frame 380.<br>
The transformation stamp of the overlap-add is based on the<br>
equation<br><br>
wherein outi,n represents the time-domain (output) sample<br>
corresponding to the sample index n and the block index i.<br>
Equation (8), hence illustrates the overlap-add operation<br>
as carried out the overlap-adder output stage 400 as<br>
illustrated in the lower part of Fig. 2b.<br><br>
However, embodiments according to the present invention are<br>
not limited to complex-modulated low-delay filterbanks<br>
allowing for an audio signal processing with one of these<br>
filterbanks. A real-valued implementation of a low-delay<br>
filterbank for an enhanced low-delay audio coding can also<br>
be implemented. As a comparison, for instance, equations<br>
(2) and (6) in terms of a cosine-part reveals, the cosine-<br>
contribution of the analysis modulation and the synthesis<br>
modulation show a comparable structure when considering<br>
that of a MDCT. Although the design method in principle<br>
allows an extension of the MDCT in both directions<br>
concerning time, only an extension of E ( = T-2) blocks to<br>
the past is applied here, where each of the T blocks<br>
comprises N samples. The frequency coefficient Xi,k of band<br>
k and block i inside an N-channel or N-band analysis<br>
filterbank can be summarized by<br><br>
for the spectral coefficient index k as defined by equation<br>
(4) . Here, once again n is a sample index and wa is the<br>
analysis window function.<br>
For the sake of completeness, the previously given<br>
mathematical description of the complex-modulated low-delay<br>
analysis filterbank can be given in the same summarizing<br>
form as equation (9) by exchanging the cosine-function with<br>
the complex-valued exponential-function. To be more<br>
precise, with the definition and variables given above, the<br>
equations (1), (2), (3) and (5) can be summarized and<br>
extended according to<br><br><br>
wherein in contrast to the equations (2) and (3) , the<br>
extension of 8 blocks into the past has been replaced by<br>
the variable E(=8).<br>
The steps of the synthesis modulation and the synthesis<br>
windowing, as described for the complex case in equations<br>
(6) and (7), can be summarized in the case of a real-valued<br>
synthesis filterbank. The frame 380 of windowed<br>
intermediate time-domain samples, which is also referred to<br>
as the demodulated vector, is given by<br><br>
wherein z'i,n is the windowed intermediate time-domain<br>
sample corresponding to the band index i and the sample<br>
index n. The sample index n is once again an integer in the<br>
range of<br><br>
and ws(n) is the synthesis window, which is compatible with<br>
the analysis window wa(n) of equation (9).<br>
The transformation step of the overlap-add is then given by<br><br>
wherein x'i,n is the reconstructed signal, or rather a time-<br>
domain sample of the block 410 as provided by the overlap-<br>
add output stage 400 shown in Fig. 2a.<br>
For the complex-valued synthesis filterbank 300, the<br>
equations (6) and (7) can be summarized and generalized<br>
with respect to the extension of E(=8) blocks to the path<br>
according to<br><br><br>
wherein j= is the imaginary unit. Equation (13)<br>
represents the generalized from of equation (8) and is also<br>
valid for the complex-valued case.<br>
As a direct comparison of equation (14) with equation (7)<br>
shows, the window function w(n) of equation (7) is the same<br>
synthesis window function as ws(n) of equation (14). As<br>
outlined before, the similar comparison of equation (10)<br>
with the analysis window function coefficient wa(n) with<br>
equation (1) shows that the analysis window function is the<br>
time-reversed version of the synthesis window function in<br>
the case of equation (1).<br>
As both, an analysis filterbank 100 as shown in Fig. 1 and<br>
a synthesis filterbank 300 as shown in Fig. 2a offer a<br>
significant improvement in terms of a trade-off between the<br>
delay on the one hand and the quality of the audio process<br>
on the other hand, the filterbanks 100, 300 are often<br>
referred to as low-delay filterbanks. The complex-valued<br>
version thereof is sometimes referred to as complex-low-<br>
delay filterbank, which is abbreviated by CLDFB. Under some<br>
circumstances, the term CLDFB is not only used for the<br>
complex-valued version but also for the real-valued version<br>
of the filterbank.<br>
As the previous discussion of the mathematical background<br>
has shown, the framework used for implementing the proposed<br>
low-delayed filterbanks utilizes a MDCT- or IMDCT-like<br>
(IMDCT = Inverse MDCT) structure, as known from the MPEG-4<br>
Standard, using an extended overlap. The additional overlap<br>
regions can be attached in a block-wise fashion to the left<br>
as well as to the right side of the MDCT-like core. Here,<br>
only the extension to the right side (for the synthesis<br><br>
filterbank) is used, which works from past samples only and<br>
therefore does not cause any further delay.<br>
The inspection of the equations (1), (2) and (14) has shown<br>
that the processing is very similar to that of a MDCT or<br>
IMDCT. By only slight modifications comprising a modified<br>
analysis window function and synthesis window function,<br>
respectively, the MDCT or IMDCT is extended to a modulated<br>
filterbank that is able to handle multiple overlaps and is<br>
very flexible concerning its delay. As for instance,<br>
equations (2) and (3) have shown the complex version is in<br>
principle obtained by simply adding a sine-modulated to the<br>
given cosine-modulation.<br>
Interpolation<br>
As outlined in the context of Figs. 1 and 2a, both, the<br>
analysis windower 110 and the synthesis windower 360 or the<br>
respective filterbanks 100, 300 are adapted to windowing<br>
the respective frames of time-domain samples by multiplying<br>
each of the respective time-domain audio samples with an<br>
individual window coefficient. Each of the time-domain<br>
samples is, in other words, multiplied by an (individual)<br>
window coefficient, as for instance equations (1) , (7) ,<br>
(9), (10), (11), and (14) have demonstrated. As a<br>
consequence, the number of window coefficients of the<br>
respective window function is typically identical to the<br>
number of respective time-domain audio samples.<br>
However, under certain implementational circumstances, it<br>
may be advisable to implement a window function having a<br>
larger second number of window coefficients compared to the<br>
actual window function having a smaller first number of<br>
coefficients, which is actually used during the windowing<br>
of the respective frame or sequence of time-domain audio<br>
samples. This may for instance be advisable in the case<br>
when memory requirements of a specific implementation may<br><br>
be more valuable than computational efficiency. A further<br>
scenario in which a downsampling of the window coefficients<br>
might become useful is in the case of the so-called dual<br>
rate approach, which is for instance employed in the<br>
framework of SBR systems (SBR = Spectral Band Replication).<br>
The concept of SBR will be explained in more detail in the<br>
context of Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
In such a case, the analysis windower 110 or the synthesis<br>
windower 360 may be further adapted such that the<br>
respective window function used for windowing the time-<br>
domain audio samples provided to the respective windower<br>
110, 360 is derived by an interpolation of window<br>
coefficients of the larger window function having a larger<br>
second number of window coefficients.<br>
The interpolation can for instance be carried out by a<br>
linear, polynomial or spline-based interpolation. For<br>
instance, in the case of the linear interpolation, but also<br>
in the case of a polynomial or spline-based interpolation,<br>
the respective windower 100, 360 may then be capable of<br>
interpolating the window coefficients of the window<br>
function used for windowing based on two consecutive window<br>
coefficients of the larger window function according to a<br>
sequence of the window coefficients of the larger window<br>
function to obtain one window coefficient of the window<br>
function.<br>
Especially in the case of an even number of time-domain<br>
audio samples and window coefficients, an implementation of<br>
an interpolation as previously described, results in a<br>
significant improvement of the audio quality. For instance,<br>
in the case of an even number N T of time-domain audio<br>
samples in one of the frames 120, 330, not using an<br>
interpolation, for instance, a linear interpolation, will<br>
result in severe aliasing effects during the further<br>
processing of the respective time-domain audio samples.<br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an example of a linear interpolation<br>
based on a window function (an analysis window function or<br>
a synthesis window function) to be employed in context with<br>
frames comprising N T/2 time-domain audio samples. Due to<br>
memory restraints or other implementational details, the<br>
window coefficients of the window function itself are not<br>
stored in a memory, but a larger window function comprising<br>
N T window coefficients are stored during appropriate<br>
memory or are available otherwise. Fig. 3 illustrates in<br>
the upper graph, the corresponding window coefficients c(n)<br>
as a function of the window coefficient indices n in the<br>
range between 0 and N • T-l.<br>
Based on a linear interpolation of two consecutive window<br>
coefficients of the window function having the larger<br>
number of window coefficients, as depicted in the upper<br>
graph of Fig. 3, an interpolated window function is<br>
calculated based on the equation<br><br>
The number of interpolated window coefficients ci(n) of the<br>
window function to be applied to a frame having N T/2<br>
time-domain audio samples comprise half the number of<br>
window coefficients.<br>
To illustrate this further, in Fig. 3 window coefficients<br>
450-0, ..., 450-7 are shown in the upper part of Fig. 3<br>
corresponding to a window coefficient c(0), ..., c(7).<br>
Based on these window coefficients and the further window<br>
coefficients of the window function, an application of<br>
equation (15) leads to the window coefficients ci(n) of the<br>
interpolated window function depicted in the lower part of<br>
Fig. 3. For instance, based on the window coefficients 450-<br>
2 and 450-3, the window coefficient 460-1 is generated<br>
based on equation (15), as illustrated by the arrows 470 in<br>
Fig. 3. Accordingly, the window coefficient 460-2 of the<br>
interpolated window function is calculated based on the<br><br>
window coefficient 450-4, 450-5 of the window function<br>
depicted in the upper part of Fig. 3. Fig. 3 shows the<br>
generation of further window coefficients ci(n).<br>
To illustrate the aliasing cancellation achievable by the<br>
interpolated downsampling of the window function, Fig. 4<br>
illustrates the interpolating of the window coefficients in<br>
the case of a sine window function, which can, for<br>
instance, be employed in a MDCT. For the sake of<br>
simplicity, the left half of the window function and the<br>
right half of the window function are drawn over each<br>
other. Fig. 4 shows a simplified version of a sine window,<br>
comprising only 2 4 window coefficients or points for a<br>
MDCT having a length of 8 samples.<br>
Fig. 4 shows four window coefficients 480-1, 480-2, 480-3<br>
and 480-4 of the first half of the sine window and four<br>
window coefficients 490-1, 490-2, 490-3 and 390-4 of the<br>
second half of the sine window. The window coefficient 490-<br>
1, ..., 490-4 corresponds to the window coefficient indices<br>
5, ..., 8. The window coefficients 490-1, ..., 490-4<br>
correspond to the second half of the length of the window<br>
function such that to the indices given N' = 4 is to be<br>
added to obtain the real indices.<br>
To reduce or even to achieve the cancellation of the<br>
aliasing effects as described before, the window<br>
coefficient should fulfill the condition<br><br>
as good as possible. The better relation (16) is fulfilled,<br>
the better the alias suppression or alias cancellation is.<br>
Assuming the situation that a new window function having<br>
half the number of window coefficients is to be determined<br>
for the left half of the window function, the following<br>
problem arises. Due to the fact that the window function<br><br>
comprises an even number of window coefficients (even<br>
numbered downsampling), without employing an interpolation<br>
scheme as outlined in Fig. 3, the window coefficients 480-1<br>
and 480-3 or 480-2 and 480-4 correspond to only one<br>
aliasing value of the original window function or original<br>
filter.<br>
This leads to an unbalanced proportion of spectral energy<br>
and leads to an unsymmetrical redistribution of the center<br>
point (center of mass) of the corresponding window<br>
function. Based on the interpolation equation (15) for the<br>
window coefficient w(n) of Fig. 4, the interpolated values<br>
Ii and I2 fulfill the aliasing relation (16) far better,<br>
and will hence lead to a significant improvement concerning<br>
the quality of the processed audio data.<br>
However, by employing an even more elaborate interpolation<br>
scheme, for instance a spline or another similar<br>
interpolation scheme, might even result in window<br>
coefficients, which fulfill the relation (16) even better.<br>
A linear interpolation is in most cases sufficient and<br>
enables a fast and efficient implementation.<br>
The situation in the case of a typical SBR system employing<br>
a SBR-QMF filterbank (QMF = Quadrature Mirror Filter), a<br>
linear interpolation or another interpolation scheme is not<br>
required to be implemented as the SBR-QMF prototype filter<br>
comprises an odd number of prototype filter coefficients.<br>
This means that the SBR-QMF prototype filter comprises a<br>
maximum value with respect to which the downsampling can be<br>
implemented so that the symmetry of the SBR-QMF prototype<br>
filter remains intact.<br>
In Figs. 5 and 6, a possible application for embodiments<br>
according to the present invention in the form of both, an<br>
analysis filterbank and a synthesis filterbank will be<br>
described. One important field of application is a SBR<br>
system or SBR tool (SBR = Spectral Band Replication) .<br><br>
However, further applications of embodiments according to<br>
the present invention may come from other fields, in which<br>
a need for spectral modifications (e.g. gain modifications<br>
or equalizations) exists, such as spatial audio object<br>
coding, low-delay parametric stereo coding, low-delayed<br>
spatial/surround coding, frame loss concealment, echo<br>
cancellation or other corresponding applications.<br>
The basic idea behind SBR is the observation that usually a<br>
strong correlation between the characteristics of a high<br>
frequency range of a signal, which will be referred to as<br>
the so-called highband signal, and the characteristics of<br>
the lowband frequency range, further referred to as the<br>
lowband or lowband signals, of the same signal is present.<br>
Thus, a good approximation for the representation of the<br>
original input signal highband can be achieved by a<br>
transposition from the lowband to the highband.<br>
In addition to the transposition, the reconstruction of the<br>
highband incorporates shaping of spectral envelope, which<br>
comprises an adjustment of the gains. This process is<br>
typically controlled by a transmission of the highband<br>
spectral envelope of the original input signal. Further<br>
guidance information sent from the encoder control further<br>
synthesis modules, such as an inverse filtering, a noise<br>
and sine addition in order to cope with audio material when<br>
transposition alone might not be sufficient. Corresponding<br>
parameters comprise the parameters "noise highband" for the<br>
addition of noise and the parameter "tonalities highband"<br>
for the sine addition. These guidance information is<br>
usually referred to as SBR data.<br>
The SBR process can be combined with any conventional<br>
waveform or codec by means of a pre-process at the encoder<br>
side and the post-process at the decoder side. The SBR<br>
encodes the high frequency portion of an audio signal at a<br>
very low cost whereas the audio codec is used to code the<br>
lower frequency portion of the signal.<br><br>
At the encoder side, the original input signal is analyzed,<br>
the highband spectral envelope and its characteristics in<br>
relation to the lowband are encoded and the resulting SBR<br>
data is multiplexed with a bitstream from the codec for the<br>
lowband. At the decoder side, the SBR data is first<br>
demultiplexed. The decoding process is organized generally<br>
into steps. First, the core decoder generates the lowband<br>
and, second, the SBR decoder operates as a post processor<br>
using the decoded SBR data to guide the spectral band<br>
replication process. A full bandwidth output signal is then<br>
obtained.<br>
To obtain a coding efficiency as high as possible, and to<br>
keep the computational complexity low, SBR enhanced codecs<br>
are often implemented as so-called dual rate systems. Dual<br>
rate means that the band limited core codec is operating at<br>
half the external audio sampling rate. In contrast, the SBR<br>
part is processed at the full sampling frequency.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a schematic block diagram of a SBR system 500.<br>
The SBR system 500 comprises for instance an AAC-LD encoder<br>
(AAC-LD = Advanced Audio Codec Low-delay) 510 and a SBR<br>
encoder 520 to which the audio data to be processed are<br>
provided in parallel. The SBR encoder 520 comprises an<br>
analysis filterbank 530, which is shown in Fig. 5 as QMF<br>
analysis filterbank. The analysis filterbank 530 is capable<br>
of providing subband audio values corresponding to subbands<br>
based on the audio signals provided to the SBR system 500.<br>
These subband audio values are then provided to a SBR<br>
parameter extraction module 540, which generates the SBR<br>
data as previously described, for instance comprising the<br>
spectral envelope for the highband, the highband noise<br>
parameter and the highband tonality parameter. These SBR<br>
data are then provided to the AAC-LD encoder 510.<br>
The AAC-LD encoder 510 is in Fig. 5 shown as a dual rate<br>
encoder. In other words, the encoder 510 operates at half<br><br>
the sampling frequency compared to the sampling frequency<br>
of the audio data provided to the encoder 510. To<br>
facilitate this, the AAC-LD encoder 510 comprises a<br>
downsampling stage 550, which optionally may comprise a low<br>
pass filter to avoid distortions caused by, for instance, a<br>
violation of the Nyquist-Shannon Theory. The downsampled<br>
audio data as output by the downsampling stage 550 are then<br>
provided to an encoder 560 (analysis filterbank) in the<br>
form of a MDCT filterbank. The signals provided by the<br>
encoder 560 are then quantized and coded in the<br>
quantization and coding stage 570. Moreover, the SBR data<br>
as provided by the SBR parameter extraction module 540 is<br>
also encoded to obtain a bitstream, which will then be<br>
output by the ACC-LD encoder 510. The quantization and<br>
coding stage 570 can, for instance, quantize the data<br>
according to the listing properties of the human ear.<br>
The bitstream is then provided to an AAC-LD decoder 580,<br>
which is part of the decoder side to which the bitstream is<br>
transported. The AAC-LD decoder comprises a decoding and<br>
dequantization stage 590, which extracts the SBR data from<br>
the bitstream and the dequantized or requantized audio data<br>
in the frequency-domain representing the lowband. The<br>
lowband data are then provided to a synthesis filterbank<br>
600 (inverse MDCT filterbank). The inverse MDCT stage<br>
(MDCT"1) 600 converts the signals provided to the inverse<br>
MDCT stage from the frequency-domain into the time-domain<br>
to provide a time signal. This time-domain signal is then<br>
provided to SBR decoder 610, which comprises an analysis<br>
filterbank 620, which is shown in Fig. 5 as a QMF analysis<br>
filterbank.<br>
The analysis filterbank 620 performs a spectral analysis of<br>
the time signal provided to the analysis filterbank 620<br>
representing the lowband. These data are then provided to a<br>
high frequency generator 630, which is also referred to as<br>
a HF generator. Based on the SBR data provided by the AAC-<br>
LD coder 580 and its decoding and dequantization stage 590,<br><br>
the HF generator 630 generates the highband based on the<br>
lowband signals provided by the analysis filterbank 620.<br>
Both, the lowband and the highband signals are then<br>
provided to a synthesis filterbank 640, which transfers the<br>
lowband and highband signals from the frequency-domain into<br>
the time-domain to provide a time-domain audio output<br>
signal form the SBR system 500.<br>
For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that in<br>
many cases the SBR system 500 as shown in Fig. 5 is not<br>
implemented in this way. To be more precise, the AAC-LD<br>
encoder 510 and the SBR encoder 520 are usually implemented<br>
on the encoder side, which is usually implemented<br>
separately from the decoder side comprising the AAC-LD<br>
decoder 580 and the SBR decoder 610. In other words, the<br>
system 500 shown in Fig. 5 essentially represents the<br>
connection of two systems, namely an encoder comprising the<br>
aforementioned encoders 510, 520 and a decoder comprising<br>
the aforementioned decoders 580, 610.<br>
Embodiments according to the present invention in the form<br>
of analysis filterbanks 100 and synthesis filterbanks 300<br>
may for instance be implemented in the system 500 shown in<br>
Fig. 5, as a replacement of the analysis filterbank 530,<br>
the analysis filterbank 620 and the synthesis filterbank<br>
640. In other words, synthesis or analysis filterbanks of<br>
the SBR components of the system 500 may, for instance, be<br>
replace by corresponding embodiments according to the<br>
present invention. Moreover, the MDCT 560 and the inverse<br>
MDCT 600 may also be replaced by low-delay analysis and<br>
synthesis filterbanks, respectively. In this case, if all<br>
the described replacements have been implemented, the so-<br>
called enhanced low-delay AAC codec (codec = coder-decoder)<br>
will be realized.<br>
The enhanced low-delay AAC (AAC-ELD) aims at combining the<br>
low-delay features of an AAC-LD (Advanced Audio Codec -<br>
Low-delay) with a high coding efficiency of HE-AAC (High<br><br>
Efficiency Advanced Audio Codec) by utilizing SBR with AAC-<br>
LD. The SBR decoder 610 acts in this scenario as a post-<br>
processor, which is supplied after the core decoder 580<br>
including a complete analysis filterbank and a synthesis<br>
filterbank 640. Therefore, the components of the SBR<br>
decoder 610 add further decoding delay, which is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5 by the shading of the components 620,<br>
630, 540.<br>
In many implementations of SBR systems 500, the lower<br>
frequency part or lowband ranges typically from 0 kHz to<br>
typically 5-15 kHz and is coded using a waveform coder,<br>
referred to as core codec. The core codec may for instance<br>
be one of the MPEG audio codec family. Additionally, a<br>
reconstruction of the high frequency part or highband is<br>
accomplished by a transition of the lowband. The<br>
combination of SBR with a core coder is in many cases<br>
implemented as a dual rate system, where the underlying AAC<br>
encoder/decoder is operated at half the sampling rate of<br>
the SBR encoder/decoder.<br>
The majority of the control data is used for the spectral<br>
envelope representation, which has a varying time and<br>
frequency resolution to be able to control the SBR process<br>
as best as possible with as little bitrate overhead as<br>
possible. The other control data mainly strives to control<br>
the tonal-to-noise ratio of the highband.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the output from the underlying AAC<br>
decoder 580 is typically analyzed with a 32-channel QMF<br>
filterbank 620. Then, the HF-generator module 630 recreates<br>
the highband by patching QMF subbands from the existing<br>
lowband to the highband. Furthermore, inverse filtering is<br>
done on a per subband basis, based on the control data<br>
obtained from the bitstream (SBR data). The envelope<br>
adjuster modifies the spectral envelope of the regenerated<br>
highband and adds additional components such as noise and<br>
sinusoids are added according to the control data in the<br><br>
bitstream. Since all operations are done in the frequency-<br>
domain (also known as QMF or subband domain) , the final<br>
step of the decoder 610 is a QMF synthesis 640 to retain a<br>
time-domain signal. For instance, in the case that the QMF<br>
analysis on the encoder side is done on a 32 QFM subband<br>
system for 1024 time-domain samples, the high frequency<br>
reconstruction results in 64-QMF subbands upon which the<br>
synthesis is done producing 2048 time-domain samples, so<br>
that an upsampling by a factor of 2 is obtained.<br>
In addition, the delay of the core coder 510 is doubled by<br>
operating at half of the original sampling rate in the dual<br>
rate mode, which gives rise to additional sources of delay<br>
in both, the encoder and the decoder process of a AAC-LD in<br>
combination with SBR. In the following, such delay sources<br>
are examined and their associated delay is minimized.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a simplified block diagram of the system 500<br>
shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 concentrates on delay sources in<br>
the encoder/decoder process using SBR and low-delay<br>
filterbanks for coding. Comparing Fig. 6 with Fig. 5, the<br>
MDCT 560 and the inverse MDCT 600 have been replaced by<br>
delay optimized modules, the so-called low-delay MDCT 560'<br>
(LD MDCT) and the low-delay inverse MDCT 600' (LD IMDCT) .<br>
Moreover, the HF-generator 630 has also been replaced by a<br>
delay optimized module 630' .<br>
Apart from the low-delay MDCT 560' and the low-delay<br>
inverse MDCT 600', a modified SBR framing and a modified HF<br>
generator 630' are employed in the system shown in Fig. 6.<br>
In order to avoid delay by different framing of a core<br>
coder/decoder 560, 600 and the respective SBR modules, the<br>
SBR framing is adapted to fit the framing length of 480 or<br>
512 samples of the AAC-LD. Furthermore, the variable time<br>
grid of the HF generator 630, which implies 384 samples of<br>
delay, is restricted regarding the spreading of SBR data<br>
over adjacent AC-LD frames. Thus, the only remaining<br><br>
sources of delay in the SBR module are the filterbanks 530,<br>
620 and 640.<br>
According to the situation depicted in Fig. 6, representing<br>
a partial implementation of the AAC-ELD codec, some delay-<br>
optimizations have already been implemented including the<br>
use of a low-delay filterbank in the AAC-LD core and the<br>
removal of a previously mentioned SBR overlap. For further<br>
delay improvements, the remaining modules need to be<br>
investigated. Fig. 6 shows the delay sources in the<br>
encoder/decoder process using SBR and the low-delay<br>
filterbanks called LD-MDCT and LD-IMDCT here. Compared to<br>
Fig. 5, in Fig. 6 every box represents a delay source,<br>
wherein the delay optimize modules are drawn in a shaded<br>
manner. The like modules have not been optimized for low-<br>
delay so far.<br>
Fig. 7a illustrates a flowchart comprising a C- or C++-<br>
pseudo code to illustrate an embodiment according to the<br>
present invention in the form of an analysis filterbank or<br>
a corresponding method for generating audio subband values<br>
in audio subband channels. To be even more precise, Fig. 7a<br>
represents a flowchart of a complex-valued analysis<br>
filterbank for 32 bands.<br>
As outlined before, the analysis filterbank is used to<br>
split the time-domain signal, for instance output from the<br>
core coder into N = 32 subband signals. The output from the<br>
filterbank, the subband samples or audio subband values,<br>
are in the case of a complex-valued analysis filterbank<br>
complex-valued and thus oversampled by a factor of 2,<br>
compared to a real-value filterbank. The filtering involves<br>
and comprises the following steps, wherein an array x(n)<br>
comprises exactly 320 time-domain samples. The higher the<br>
index of the samples n into the array is, the older the<br>
samples are.<br><br>
After a start of the embodiments of the method in step<br>
S100, first, the samples in the array x(n) are shifted by<br>
32 positions in step S110. The oldest 32 samples are<br>
discarded and 32 new samples are stored in positions 31 to<br>
0 in step S120. As shown in Fig. 7a, the incoming time-<br>
domain audio samples are stored in positions corresponding<br>
to a decreasing index n in the range of 31 to 0. This<br>
results in a time-reversal of the samples stored in the<br>
corresponding frame or vector so that reversing the index<br>
of the window function to obtain the analysis window<br>
function based on the (equally long) synthesis window<br>
function has already been taken care of.<br>
During a step S130, window coefficients ci(j) are obtained<br>
by a linear interpolation of the coefficients c(j) based on<br>
equation (15). The interpolation is based on a block size<br>
(block length or number of subband values) of N = 64 values<br>
and based on a frame comprising T = 10 blocks. Hence, the<br>
index of the window coefficients of the interpolated window<br>
function are in the range between 0 and 319 according to<br>
equation (15) . The window coefficients c(n) are given in<br>
the table in Annex 1 of the description. However, depending<br>
on implementational details, to obtain the window<br>
coefficients based on the values given in the tables in the<br>
Annexes 1 and 3, additional sign changes with respect to<br>
the window coefficients corresponding to the indices 128 to<br>
255 and 384 to 511 (multiplication with factor (-1)) should<br>
be considered.<br>
In these cases, the window coefficients w(n) or c(n) to be<br>
used may be obtained according to<br><br><br>
for n = 0 to 639, wherein wtable(n) are the values given in<br>
the tables in the Annexes.<br>
However, the window coefficients are not required to be<br>
implemented according to the table in Annex 1 to obtain,<br>
for instance, the already described reduction of delay. To<br>
achieve this reduction of delay, while maintaining the<br>
quality level of the processed audio data, or to achieve<br>
another trade-off, the window coefficients c(n) for the<br>
window coefficient index n in the range between 0 and 639,<br>
may fulfill one of the sets of relations as given in one of<br>
the Annexes 2 to 4. Moreover, it should be noted that also<br>
other window coefficients c(n) may be employed in<br>
embodiments according to the present invention. Naturally,<br>
also other window functions comprising a different number<br>
of window coefficients than 320 or 640 can be implemented,<br>
although the tables in the Annexes 1 to 4 only apply to<br>
window functions having 640 window coefficients.<br>
The linear interpolation according to S130 leads to a<br>
significant quality improvement and aliasing effects<br>
reduction or cancellation in the case of a window function<br>
comprising an even number of window coefficients. It should<br>
further be noted that the complex unit is not j as in the<br>
equations (1), (2) and (16), but is denoted by i =V-1 .<br>
In step S140, the samples of the array x(n) are then<br>
multiplied element-wise by the coefficients ci(n) of the<br>
interpolated window.<br>
In step S150, the windowed samples are summed up according<br>
to the equation given in the flowchart in Fig. 7a to create<br>
the 64-element array u(n) . In step S160, 32 new subband<br>
samples or audio subband values W(k,l) are calculated<br>
according to the matrix operation Mu, wherein the element<br>
of the matrix M are given by<br><br><br>
wherein exp() denotes the complex exponential function and,<br>
as previously mentioned, i is the imaginary unit. Before<br>
the loop of a flowchart ends with step S170, each of the<br>
subband values W(k,l) (= W[k][l]) may be output, which<br>
corresponds to the subband sample 1 in the subband having<br>
the index k. In other words, every loop in the flowchart<br>
shown in Fig. 7a produces 32 complex-valued subband values,<br>
each representing the output from one filterbank subband.<br>
Fig. 7b illustrates the step S150 of collapsing the frame<br>
150 of windowed time-domain audio samples comprising 10<br>
blocks 160-1, ..., 160-10 of windowed time-domain audio<br>
samples z(n) to the vector u(n) by a 5-fold summing of two<br>
blocks of the frame 150 each. The collapsing or retracting<br>
is done on an element-wise basis so that the windowed time-<br>
domain audio samples corresponding to the same sample index<br>
inside each of the blocks 160-1, 160-3, 160-5, 160-7 and<br>
160-9 are added to obtain the corresponding value in the<br>
first blocks 650-1 of the vector u(n). Accordingly, based<br>
on the blocks 160-2, 160-4, 160-6, 160-8 and 160-10 the<br>
corresponding elements of the vector u(n) in block 160-2<br>
are generated in step S150.<br>
A further embodiment according to the present invention in<br>
the form of an analysis filterbank can be implemented as a<br>
64-band complex low-delay filterbank. The processing of<br>
this complex low-delay filterbank as an analysis filterbank<br>
is basically similar to the analysis filterbank as<br>
described in the context of Fig. 7a. Due to the<br>
similarities and basically the same processing as described<br>
in the context of Fig. 7a, the differences between the<br>
described complex analysis filterbank for 32 bands of Fig.<br>
7a and the complex analysis filterbank for 64 subbands will<br>
be outlined here.<br><br>
In contrast to the 32-subband comprising analysis<br>
filterbank as shown in Fig. 7a, the vector of frame x(n)<br>
comprises, in the case of a 64-band analysis filterbank 640<br>
elements having indices from 0 to 639. Hence, the step S110<br>
is modified such that the samples in the array x(n) are<br>
shifted by 64 positions, wherein the oldest 64 samples are<br>
discarded. In step S120 instead of 32 new samples, 64 new<br>
samples are stored in the positions 63 to 0. As shown in<br>
Fig. 7c, the incoming time-domain audio samples are stored<br>
in positions corresponding to a decreasing index n in the<br>
range of 63 to 0. This results in a time-reversal of the<br>
samples stored in the corresponding frame or vector so that<br>
reversing the index of the window function to obtain the<br>
analysis window function based on the (equally long)<br>
synthesis window function has already been taken care of.<br>
As the window c(n) used for windowing the elements of the<br>
vector of frame x(n), comprises typically 640 elements, the<br>
step S130 of linearly interpolating the window coefficients<br>
to obtain the interpolated windows ci (n) can be omitted.<br>
Then, during step S140, the samples of the array x(n) are<br>
multiplied or windowed by use of the sequence of window<br>
coefficients c(n), which are once again based on the values<br>
in the table in Annex 1. In the case of the window<br>
coefficient c(n) are those of the synthesis window<br>
function, the windowing or multiplication of the array x(n)<br>
by the window c(n) is carried out according to the equation<br><br>
for an = 0, ..., 639. Once again, to achieve the low-delay<br>
properties of the window function, it is not required to<br>
implement the window function exactly according to the<br>
window coefficients based on the values given in the table<br>
of Annex 1. For many applications, an implementation in<br>
which the window coefficients fulfill either set of<br>
relations as given in the tables in the Annexes 2 to 4 will<br><br>
be sufficient to achieve an acceptable trade-off between<br>
quality and a significant reduction of the delay. However,<br>
depending on implementational details, to obtain the window<br>
coefficients based on the values given in the tables in the<br>
Annexes 1 and 3, additional sign changes with respect to<br>
the window coefficients corresponding to the indices 128 to<br>
255 and 384 to 511 (multiplication with factor (-1)) should<br>
be considered according to the equations (16a) and (16b).<br>
Step S150 of the flowchart shown in Fig. 7a is then<br>
replaced by a summing of the samples of the vector of frame<br>
z(n) according to the equation<br><br>
to create the 128-element array u(n).<br>
Step S160 of Fig. 7a is then replaced by a step in which 64<br>
new subband samples are calculated according to the matrix<br>
operation Mu, wherein the matrix elements of the matrix M<br>
are given by<br><br>
wherein exp () denotes the complex exponential function and<br>
i is as explained, the imaginary unit.<br>
Fig. 7c illustrates a flowchart according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention in the form of real-valued<br>
analysis filterbank for 32 subband channels. The embodiment<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 7c does not differ significantly<br>
from the embodiment shown in Fig. 7a. The main difference<br>
between the two embodiments is that step S160 of<br>
calculating the new 32 complex-valued subband audio values<br>
is replaced in the embodiment shown in Fig. 7c by a step<br>
S162 in which 32 real-valued subband audio samples are<br><br>
calculated according to a matrix operation Mru, wherein the<br>
elements of the matrix Mr are given by<br><br>
As a consequence, every loop in the flowchart produces 32<br>
real-valued subband samples wherein W(k,l) corresponds to<br>
the subband audio sample 1 of the subband k.<br>
The real-valued analysis filterbank can for instance be<br>
employed in the framework of a low-power mode of a SBR<br>
system, as shown in Fig. 5. The low-power mode of the SBR<br>
tool differs from the high quality SBR tool mainly with<br>
respect to the fact that real-valued filterbanks are<br>
employed. This reduces the computational complexity and the<br>
computational effort by a factor of 2, so that the number<br>
of operations per time unit are essentially reduced by a<br>
factor of 2 as no imaginary part is required to be<br>
calculated.<br>
The proposed new filterbanks according to the present<br>
invention are fully compatible with the low-power mode of<br>
SBR systems. Thus, with filterbanks according to the<br>
present invention, SBR systems can still run both in the<br>
normal mode or high-quality mode with complex filterbanks<br>
and in the low-power mode with real-valued filterbanks. The<br>
real-valued filterbank may, for instance, be derived from<br>
the complex filterbank by using only the real-values<br>
(cosine-modulated contributions) and omitting the imaginary<br>
values (sine-modulated contributions).<br>
Fig. 8a shows a flowchart according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention in the form of a complex-valued synthesis<br>
filterbank for 64 subband channels. As previously outlined,<br>
the synthesis filtering of the SBR-processed subband<br>
signals is achieved using a 64-subband synthesis filterbank<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. The<br><br>
output from the filterbank is a block of real-valued time-<br>
domain samples as outlined in the context of Fig. 1. The<br>
process is illustrated by the flowchart in Fig. 8a, which<br>
also illustrates an embodiment of the present invention in<br>
the form of a method for generating time-domain audio<br>
samples.<br>
The synthesis filtering comprises after a start (step<br>
S200), the following steps, wherein an array v comprises<br>
1280 samples. In step S210, the samples in the array v are<br>
shifted by 128 positions, wherein the oldest 128 samples<br>
are discarded. In step S220, the 64 new complex-valued<br>
audio subband values are multiplied by a matrix N, wherein<br>
the matrix elements N(k,n) are given by<br><br>
wherein exp() denotes the complex exponential function and<br>
i is the imaginary unit. The real part of the output from<br>
this operation is stored in the position 0-127 of array v,<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 8a.<br>
In step S230, the samples, which are now in the time-domain<br>
are extracted from the array v according to the equation<br>
given in Fig. 8a to create a 640-element array g(n) . In<br>
step S240, the real-valued samples in the time-domain of<br>
array g are multiplied by the window coefficient c(n) to<br>
produce an array w, wherein the window coefficients of a<br>
preferred embodiment according to the present invention are<br>
once again the window coefficients based on the values<br>
given in the table in Annex 1.<br>
However, as outlined before, the window coefficients are<br>
not required to be exactly based on the values given in<br>
table of Annex 1. It is in different embodiments according<br>
to the present invention sufficient, if the window<br>
coefficients satisfy one of the sets of relations as given<br><br>
in the tables of Annexes 2 to 4, to achieve the desired<br>
low-delay property of the synthesis filterbank. Moreover,<br>
as explained in the context of the analysis filterbank,<br>
also other window coefficients may be utilized in the<br>
framework of the synthesis filterbank. However, depending<br>
on implementational details, to obtain the window<br>
coefficients based on the values given in the tables in the<br>
Annexes 1 and 3, additional sign changes with respect to<br>
the window coefficients corresponding to the indices 128 to<br>
255 and 384 to 511 (multiplication with factor (-1)) should<br>
be considered.<br>
In step S250, 64 new output samples are calculated by a<br>
summation of samples from the array w(n) according to the<br>
last step and the formula given in the flowchart of Fig.<br>
8a, before one loop of a flowchart ends in step S260. In<br>
the flowchart as shown in Fig. 8a, X[k][l] (= X(k,l))<br>
corresponds to audio subband value 1 in the subband having<br>
the index k. Every new loop as depicted in Fig. 8a produces<br>
64 time-domain, real-valued audio samples as an output.<br>
The implementation as shown in Fig. 8a of a complex-valued<br>
analysis filterbank for 64 bands does not require an<br>
overlap/add buffer comprising several storage positions as<br>
explained in the context of the embodiment shown in Fig.<br>
2b. Here, the overlap-add buffer is "hidden" in the vectors<br>
v and g, which is calculated based on the values stored in<br>
the vector v. The overlap-add buffer is implemented in the<br>
framework of these vectors with these indices being larger<br>
than 128, so that the values correspond to values from<br>
previous or past blocks.<br>
Fig. 8b illustrates a flowchart of a real-valued synthesis<br>
filterbank for 64 real-valued audio subband channels. The<br>
real-valued synthesis filterbank according to Fig. 8b can<br>
also implemented in the case of a low-power SBR<br>
implementation as a corresponding SBR filterbank.<br><br>
The flowchart of Fig. 8b differs form the flowchart of Fig.<br>
8a, mostly with respect to step S222, which replaces S220<br>
of Fig. 8a. In step S222, the 64 new real-valued audio<br>
subband values are multiplied by a matrix Nr, wherein the<br>
elements of the matrix Nr(k,n) are given by<br><br>
wherein the output from this operation is once again stored<br>
in the positions 0-127 of the array v.<br>
Apart from these modifications, the flowchart as shown in<br>
Fig. 8b in the case of a real-valued synthesis filterbank<br>
for the low-power SBR mode, does not differ from the<br>
flowchart as shown in Fig. 8a of the complex-valued<br>
synthesis filterbank for the high quality SBR mode.<br>
Fig. 8c illustrates a flowchart according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention in the form of a downsampled<br>
complex-valued synthesis filterbank and the appropriate<br>
method, which can for instance be implemented in a high-<br>
quality SBR implementation. To be more precise, the<br>
synthesis filterbank as described in Fig. 8c relates to a<br>
complex-valued synthesis filterbank capable of processing<br>
complex-valued audio subband values for 32 subband<br>
channels.<br>
The downsampled synthesis filtering of the SBR-process<br>
subband signals is achieved using a 32-channel synthesis<br>
filterbank as illustrated in Fig. 8c. The output from the<br>
filterbank is a block of real-valued time-domain samples.<br>
The process is given in the flowchart of Fig. 8c. The<br>
synthesis filtering comprises after a start (step S300),<br>
the following steps, wherein an array v comprises 640 real-<br>
valued time-domain samples.<br><br>
In step S310, the samples in the array v are shifted by 64<br>
positions, wherein the oldest 64 samples are discarded.<br>
Then, in step S320, the 32 new complex-valued subband<br>
samples or complex-valued audio subband values are<br>
multiplied by a matrix N, the elements of which are given<br>
by<br>
J <br>
wherein exp()denotes the complex exponential function and i<br>
is again the imaginary unit. The real part of the output<br>
from this operation is then stored in the positions 0-63 of<br>
array v.<br>
In step S330, the samples are extracted from vector v<br>
according to the equation given in the flowchart of Fig. 8c<br>
to create a 320-element array g. In step S340, the window<br>
coefficients ci(n) of an interpolated window function are<br>
obtained by a linear interpolation of the coefficients c(n)<br>
in accordance with equation (15), wherein the index n is<br>
once again in the range between 0 and 319 (N=64, T=10 for<br>
equation (15)). As illustrated before, the coefficients of<br>
a window function c(n) are based on the values given in the<br>
table of Annex 1. Moreover, to achieve the low-delay<br>
property as illustrated earlier, the window coefficients<br>
c(n) are not required to be exactly the figures given in<br>
the table of Annex 1. It is sufficient if the window<br>
coefficients c(n) fulfill at least one set of relations as<br>
given in the Annexes 2 to 4. However, depending on<br>
implementational details, to obtain the window coefficients<br>
based on the values given in the tables in the Annexes 1<br>
and 3, additional sign changes with respect to the window<br>
coefficients corresponding to the indices 128 to 255 and<br>
384 to 511 (multiplication with factor (-1)) should be<br>
considered according to equations (16a) and (16b).<br>
Moreover, also different window functions comprising<br><br>
different window coefficients c(n) can naturally be<br>
employed in embodiments of the present invention.<br>
In step S350, the samples of the array g are multiplied by<br>
the interpolated window coefficient ci(n) of the<br>
interpolated window function to obtain the windowed time-<br>
domain sample w(n).<br>
Then, in step S360, 32 new output samples are calculated by<br>
a summation of samples from array w(n) according to the<br>
last step S360, before the final step S370 in the flowchart<br>
of Fig. 8c.<br>
As indicated earlier, in the flowchart of Fig. 8c,<br>
X([k][l]) (= x(k,l)) corresponds to an audio subband value<br>
1 in the audio subband channel k. Moreover, every new loop<br>
of a flowchart as indicated in Fig. 8c produces 32 real-<br>
valued time-domain samples as an output.<br>
Fig. 8d shows a flowchart of an embodiment according to the<br>
preset invention in the form of a downsampled real-valued<br>
synthesis filterbank, which can for instance be employed in<br>
the case of a low-power SBR filterbank. The embodiment and<br>
the flowchart shown in Fig. 8d differs from the flowchart<br>
shown in Fig. 8c of the downsampled complex-valued<br>
synthesis filterbank only with respect to step S320, which<br>
is replaced in the flowchart shown in Fig. 8d by step S322.<br>
In step S322, the 32 new real-valued audio subband values,<br>
or subband samples are multiplied by the matrix Nr, wherein<br>
the elements of the matrix Nr are given by<br><br>
wherein the output from this operation is stored in the<br>
position of 0 to 64 of array v.<br><br>
Fig. 9a shows a further implementation of an embodiment<br>
according to the present invention in the form of a method<br>
corresponding to a complex-valued analysis filterbank for<br>
64 subbands. Fig. 9a shows an implementation as a MATLAB-<br>
implementation, which provides as an output a vector y and<br>
a vector "state". The function as defined in this script<br>
shown in Fig. 9a is called LDFB80 to which a vector x<br>
comprising fresh audio samples and the vector "state" is<br>
provided to as an input. The name of the function LDFB80 is<br>
an abbreviation for low-delay filterbank for 8 blocks<br>
extending into the past and 0 blocks into the future.<br>
In the MATLAB-programming language, the percent sign (%)<br>
indicates remarks, which are not carried out, but merely<br>
serve the purpose of commenting and illustrating the source<br>
code. In the following description, different segments of<br>
the source code will be explained with respect to their<br>
functions.<br>
In the code sequence S400, the buffer which is represented<br>
by the vector "state" is updated in a way such that the<br>
content of the vector "state" having the indices 577 to 640<br>
are replaced by the contents of the vector x comprising the<br>
fresh time-domain audio input samples. In the code sequence<br>
S410, the window coefficients of the analysis window<br>
function as stored in the variable LDFB80_win is<br>
transferred to the vector win_ana.<br>
In step S420, which assumes that the latest samples are<br>
aligned to the right side of the buffer, the actual<br>
windowing is performed. In block S420, the content of the<br>
vector state is element-wise multiplied (.*) with the<br>
elements of the vector win_ana comprising the analysis<br>
window function. The output of this multiplication is then<br>
stored into the vector x_win_orig.<br>
In step S430, the content of the vector x_win_orig is<br>
reshaped to form a matrix of a size of 128 • 5 elements<br><br>
called x_stack. In step S440, the sign change of the stack<br>
x_stack is performed with respect to the second and fourth<br>
column of the matrix x_stack.<br>
In step S450, the stack x_stack is collapsed or retracted<br>
by summing the elements of x_stack with respect to the<br>
second index and simultaneously inverting the order of the<br>
elements and transposing the outcome before storing the<br>
outcome again to the various x_stack.<br>
In the code segment S460, the transformation from the time-<br>
domain into the frequency-domain is carried out by<br>
computing a complex Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of<br>
the element-wise multiplied content of the stack x_stack<br>
multiplied with the complex exponential function to which<br>
the argument (-i • n • n/128) is provided, with the indices<br>
and in the range from 0 to -127 and the imaginary unit i.<br>
In the code segment S470, a post twiddle is performed by<br>
defining the variable m = (64 + l)/2 and by calculating the<br>
block comprising the audio subband values as a vector y<br>
according to the equation<br><br>
The index k covers the range of integers from 1-64 in the<br>
implementation shown in Fig. 9a. The vector y is then<br>
output as the vector or block comprising the audio subband<br>
values 180 of Fig. 1. The bar above the second factoring<br>
equation (26) as well as the function conj() encode segment<br>
S417 in Fig. 9a refer to the complex conjugate of the<br>
argument of the respective complex number.<br>
In a final code-segment S480, the state-vector is shifted<br>
by 64 elements. The state-vector in its shifted form may<br>
then be provided to the function LDFB80 as an input again<br>
in a further loop of the function.<br><br>
Fig. 9b shows a MATLAB-implementation according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention in the form of a method<br>
corresponding to a complex-valued analysis filterbank for<br>
32 subbands. Accordingly, the function defined is referred<br>
to as LDFB80_32 indicating that the implementation<br>
represents a low-delay filterbank for 32 subbands based on<br>
an additional overlap of 8 blocks into the past and 0<br>
blocks into the future.<br>
The implementation of Fig. 9b differs from the<br>
implementation shown in Fig. 9a, only with respect to a few<br>
code sequences, as will be outlined in the following<br>
description. The code sequences S400, S430, S460, S470 and<br>
S480 are replaced by corresponding code sequences S400',<br>
S430', S460', S470' and S480' taking into account mainly<br>
the fact that the number of subbands, or the number of<br>
subband values output by the function LDFB80_32, is reduced<br>
by a factor of 2. Accordingly, the step S400' relates to<br>
the vector state being updated with respect to the 32 last<br>
entries corresponding to the indices 289 to 320 with the<br>
corresponding 32 time-domain audio input samples of the<br>
fresh block 220 as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
However, the major difference between the implementations<br>
as shown in Figs. 9a and 9b appears in the code sequence<br>
S410 of Fig. 9a, which is replaced by a code sequence S412<br>
in the implementation shown in Fig. 9b. The code sequence<br>
for S412 of Fig. 9b comprises first a copying of the 640<br>
window coefficients comprising windows stored in the vector<br>
LDFB80_win to the local vector win_ana. Then, an<br>
interpolation according to equation (15) takes place, in<br>
which two consecutive window coefficients represented by<br>
the vector elements of the vector win_ana are added and<br>
divided by 2 and then stored back in the vector win_ana.<br>
The next code sequence S420 is identical to the code<br>
sequence S420 as shown in Fig. 9a, which carries out the<br><br>
actual element-wise multiplication (.*) of the windowing of<br>
the values, or elements, of the vector state with the<br>
elements of the vector win_ana comprising the interpolated<br>
window coefficients of the interpolated window function.<br>
The output of this operation is stored in the vector<br>
x_win_orig. However, the difference between the code<br>
sequence S420 of Fig. 9b and the corresponding code<br>
sequence S420 of Fig. 9a, is that in the case of Fig. 9b,<br>
not 640 but only 320 multiplications are carried out in the<br>
framework of the windowing.<br>
In the code sequence S430' replacing the code sequence<br>
S430, the stack x__stack is prepared by reshaping the vector<br>
x_win_orig. However, as the vector X_win_orig only<br>
comprises 320 elements, compared to the corresponding<br>
vector of Fig. 9a comprising 640 elements, the matrix<br>
x_stack is only a matrix of 64 • 5 elements.<br>
The code sequences S440 of the sign change and the code<br>
sequence S450 of collapsing the stack are identical in both<br>
implementations according to the Figs. 9a and 9b, apart<br>
from the reduced number of elements (320 compared to 640).<br>
In the code sequence S460' replacing the code sequence S460<br>
an odd complex Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a window<br>
data is carried out, which is quite similar to the<br>
transform of code sequence S460 of Fig. 9a. However, once<br>
again, due to the reduced number of output audio subband<br>
values, the vector temp is provided with the outcome of a<br>
Fast Fourier Transform, the element-wise multiplication of<br>
the elements of the stack x_stack and the complex<br>
exponential function of the argument (-i •. π . n/64),<br>
wherein the index n is in the range between 0 and 63.<br>
Afterwards, in the modified code sequence S470', the post<br>
twiddling is performed by defining the variable m =(32+1)/2<br>
and by generating the output vector y according to equation<br>
(26) , wherein the index k only covers the range from 1 to<br><br>
32 and wherein the number 128 appearing in the argument of<br>
the complex exponential function is substituted by the<br>
number 64.<br>
In the final code-sequence S480', the buffer state is<br>
shifted by 32 elements in the case of the implementation<br>
shown in Fig. 9b, wherein in the corresponding code<br>
sequence S480, the buffer is shifted by 64 elements.<br>
Fig. 10a shows a MATLAB-script illustrating an<br>
implementation according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention in the form of a method corresponding to a<br>
complex-valued synthesis filterbank for 64 subbands. The<br>
script shown in Fig. 10a defines the function ILDFB80 to<br>
which the vector x representing the block 320 of audio<br>
subband values of Fig. 2a and a state-vector "state" is<br>
provided to as input parameters. The name ILDFB80 indicates<br>
that the function defined is an inverse low-delay<br>
filterbank corresponding to 8 blocks of audio data from the<br>
past and 0 blocks from the future. The function provides a<br>
vector y and a new or redefined state-vector "state" as an<br>
output, wherein the vector y corresponds to the block 410<br>
of time-domain audio samples from Fig. 2a.<br>
In a code sequence S500, a pre-twiddling is performed, in<br>
which a variable m =(64 + l)/2 as well as a vector temp is<br>
defined. The elements temp(n) of the vector temp are<br>
defined according to equation<br><br>
wherein the bar above the element of the vector x(n) and<br>
the function conj() represent the complex conjugate, exp()<br>
represents the complex exponential function, i represents<br>
the imaginary unit and n is an index in the range from 1 -<br>
to 64.<br><br>
In the code sequence S510, the vector temp is expended into<br>
a matrix comprising in the first column the elements of the<br>
vector temp and in the second column, the complex conjugate<br>
of the reversed vector temp with respect to the order of<br>
the elements as defined by the index of the vector. Hence,<br>
in the code sequence S510 an odd symmetry of the matrix<br>
temp is established based on the vector temp.<br>
In a code sequence S520 an odd Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)<br>
is performed based on the matrix temp. in this code<br>
sequence, the real part of the element-wise multiplication<br>
of the outcome of the inverse Fourier Transform of the<br>
matrix temp with the exponential function having the<br>
argument of (i • 7r/128) is performed and outputted to a<br>
vector y_knl, wherein the index n is in the range from 0 to<br>
127.<br>
In the code sequence S530, an extension of the data and an<br>
alternating sign flip is formed. To achieve this, the order<br>
of the elements of the vector y_knl is reversed and at the<br>
same time a sign flip if carried out. Then, a matrix tmp is<br>
defined, comprising the first, third and fifth column of<br>
the vector y_knl, wherein the second and the fourth column<br>
comprise the sign flipped vector y_knl.<br>
In a code sequence S540, the window coefficients as stored<br>
in the vector LDFB80_win are first copied to the vector<br>
win_ana. Then, the synthesis window coefficients are<br>
determined based on the analysis window coefficients as<br>
stored in the vector win_ana by generating a time reversed<br>
version of the analysis window function according to<br>
\ <br>
wherein N • T is the total number of window coefficients<br>
and n is the index of the window coefficients.<br><br>
In a code sequence S550, the synthesis window is applied to<br>
the vector trap by an element-wise multiplication of the<br>
vector with the synthesis window function. In a code<br>
sequence S560, the buffer is updated by setting the<br>
elements of the vector state with the indices 577 to 640 to<br>
0 and by adding the content of the windowed vector tmp to<br>
the state-vector state.<br>
In a code sequence S570, the output vector y comprising the<br>
time-domain audio samples is extracted from the state-<br>
vector by extracting the elements of the state-vector by<br>
extracting the elements of the state-vector with the<br>
indices 1 to 64 .<br>
In a code sequence S580, the final code sequence of the<br>
function as shown in Fig. 10a, the state-vector state is<br>
shifted by 64 elements so that the elements with indices<br>
from 65 to 640 are copied to the first 576 elements of the<br>
vector state.<br>
Fig. 10b shows a MATLAB-script of an implementation<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention in the<br>
form of a complex-valued synthesis filterbank for 32<br>
subband values. The name of the function as defined by the<br>
script shown in Fig. 10b illustrates this as the function<br>
defined is called ILDFB80_32 indicating that the function<br>
defined is an inverse low-delay filterbank for 32 bands<br>
with 8 blocks overlap from the past and 0 blocks overlap<br>
from the future.<br>
As discussed with respect to the comparison of the<br>
implementation shown in Figs. 9a and 9b, the implementation<br>
according to the script of Fig. 10b is also closely related<br>
to the implementation of the 64-subband synthesis<br>
filterbank according to Fig. 10a. As a consequence, the<br>
same vectors are provided to the function and are output by<br>
the function which, however, comprise only half the number<br>
of elements compared to the implementation of Fig. 10a. The<br><br>
implementation for a 32-band synthesis filterbank for 32<br>
bands differs from the 64-subband version illustrated in<br>
Fig. 10a, mainly with respect to two aspects. The code<br>
sequences S500, S510, S520, S531β, S560, S570 and S580 are<br>
replaced with code sequences in which the number of<br>
elements to be addressed and further number of element-<br>
related parameters are divided by 2. Moreover, the code<br>
sequence S540 of generating the synthesis window function<br>
is replaced by a code sequence S542, in which the synthesis<br>
window function is generated as a linearly interpolated<br>
synthesis window function according to equation (15).<br>
In the code sequence S500' replacing the code sequence<br>
S500, the variable m is defined to be equal to m = (32+1)/2<br>
and the vector temp is defined according to equation (27),<br>
wherein the index n only covers the range of 1 to 32 and<br>
wherein the factor of 1/128 is replaced by the factor 1/64<br>
in the argument of the exponential-function.<br>
Accordingly, in the code sequence S510' replacing the code<br>
sequence S510, the index range only covers the indices of<br>
the 32-element comprising the vector temp. In other words,<br>
the index only covers the values from 1 to 32. Accordingly,<br>
in the code sequence S520' replacing the code sequence<br>
S520, the argument of the exponential function is replaced<br>
by (i • π • n/64), wherein the index n is in the range from<br>
0 to 63. In the framework of the code sequence S530', the<br>
index range is also reduced by a factor of 2 compared to<br>
the code sequence S530.<br>
The code sequence S542 replacing the code sequence S540 of<br>
Fig. 10a also copies the window function as stored in the<br>
vector LDFB80_win to the vector win_ana and generates a<br>
time-reversed version win_syn according to equation (28).<br>
However, the code sequence S542 of the implementation shown<br>
in Fig. 10b further comprises an interpolation step<br>
according to equation (15), in which for each element of<br>
the redefined vector win syn comprising the window<br><br>
coefficients of the synthesis window function, a linear<br>
interpolation of two consecutive window coefficients of the<br>
original synthesis window function.<br>
The code sequence S550 of applying the window to the vector<br>
tmp and replacing the elements tmp with the windowed<br>
version thereof is identical in terms of the code as a<br>
direct comparison of the respective code sequences in Figs.<br>
10a and 10b. However, due to the smaller size of the vector<br>
tmp in the implementation of Fig. 10b, during an<br>
implementation, only half the number of multiplications is<br>
carried out.<br>
Also in the framework of the code sequences S560' , S570'<br>
and S580' replacing the code sequences S560, S570 and S580,<br>
respectively, the indices 640 and 64 are replaced by 320<br>
and 32, respectively. Therefore, these three final code<br>
sequences only differ from the code sequences of the<br>
implementation shown in Fig. 10a with respect to the size<br>
of the vector states tmp and y.<br>
As the embodiments described so far have illustrated, the<br>
analysis windower as well as the synthesis windower are<br>
adapted to windowing the respective samples in the time-<br>
domain comprised in the respective frames by multiplying<br>
these on an element-wise basis with window coefficients of<br>
a window function.<br>
Before describing a window function, which can be employed<br>
for instance as a synthesis window function and as an<br>
analysis window function in its time-reversed version more<br>
closely, advantages of embodiments according to the present<br>
invention will be outlined in more detail, especially in<br>
view of an implementation in the framework of a SBR tool or<br>
system as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
Among the advantages, embodiments according to the present<br>
invention and systems comprising more than one embodiment<br><br>
according to the present invention may offer is a<br>
significant reduction of the delay according to other<br>
filterbanks. However, this low-delay property will be<br>
addressed in the context of Figs. 13 and 14 in more detail.<br>
One important aspect in this context is to note that the<br>
length of the window function, in other words, the number<br>
of window coefficients to be applied to a frame or a block<br>
of time-domain samples is independent of the delay.<br>
Moreover, as will be outlined in the context of Figs. 17<br>
and 18 in more detail, in terms of the psychoacoustics,<br>
embodiments according to the present invention often make<br>
use the temporal masking properties of the human ear better<br>
than many other filterbanks. Moreover, as will be more<br>
closely outlined in the context of Figs. 15, 16 and 19,<br>
embodiments according to the present invention offer an<br>
excellent frequency response.<br>
Also, in many filterbanks according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a perfect reconstruction is achievable<br>
if an analysis filterbank and the synthesis filterbank are<br>
interconnected. In other words, embodiments according to<br>
the present invention do not only offer an audibly<br>
indistinguishable output compared to the input of such an<br>
interconnected set of an analysis filterbank and a<br>
synthesis filterbank, but (apart from quantization errors,<br>
computational rounding effects and further effects caused<br>
by the necessary discretization, an identical output<br>
compared to the input.<br>
An integration in the SBR module of filterbanks according<br>
to the present invention can easily be achieved. While<br>
typically SBR modules operate in the dual-rate mode, the<br>
complex-valued low-delay filterbanks according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention are capable of<br>
providing perfect reconstruction in the single-rate mode,<br>
while the original SBR QMF filterbanks are capable of only<br>
providing near-perfect reconstruction. In the dual-rate<br><br>
mode, the 32-band version of the impulse response is<br>
obtained by linear interpolation also referred to as<br>
downsampling of two adjacent taps or window coefficients of<br>
the 64-band impulse response or window function as<br>
explained in the context of Fig. 3.<br>
In the case of a complex-valued implementation of a<br>
filterbank, a significant reduced analyzing (or<br>
synthesizing) delay for critically sampled filterbanks can<br>
be achieved, in which the sampling or processing frequency<br>
corresponds to the border frequency according to the<br>
Nyquist-Shannon Theory. In the case of a real-valued<br>
implementation of a filterbank, an efficient implementation<br>
can be achieved employing optimized algorithms, as for<br>
instance illustrated in the context of the MATLAB-<br>
implementation shown in Figs. 9 and 10. These<br>
implementations may for instance be employed for the low-<br>
power mode of the SBR tool as described in the context of<br>
Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
As outlined in the context of Figs. 5 and 6, it is possible<br>
to achieve a further reduction concerning the delay in the<br>
case of an SBR system by using a complex-valued low-delay<br>
filterbank according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As outlined before, in the SBR decoder 610 as<br>
shown in Fig. 5, the QMF analysis filterbank 620 is<br>
replaced by a complex low-delay filterbank (CLDFB)<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. This<br>
replacement can be done in a computable way by keeping the<br>
number of bands (64), the length of the impulse response<br>
(640) and by using a complex modulation. The delay achieved<br>
by this tool is minimized to such an extent to achieve an<br>
overall delay low enough for a bi-directional communication<br>
without sacrificing an achievable quality level.<br>
Compared, for instance, to a system comprising a MDCT and a<br>
MDST to form a complex-valued MDCT-like system, an<br>
embodiment according to the present invention provides a<br><br>
far better frequency response. Compared	to the QMF<br>
filterbank, for instance, used in the MPEG-4	SBR today, a<br>
system comprising one or more filterbanks	according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention	provides a<br>
significantly lower delay.<br>
Even compared to a low-delay QMF filterbank, embodiments<br>
according to the present invention offer the advantage of a<br>
perfect reconstruction combined with the lower delay. The<br>
advantages arising from the perfect reconstruction property<br>
in contrast to the near-perfect reconstruction of QMF<br>
filterbanks are the following. For near-perfect<br>
reconstruction, a high stopband attenuation is necessary to<br>
attenuate the aliasing to a sufficiently low level. This<br>
restricts the possibility of achieving a very low-delay in<br>
the filter design. In contrast, employing an embodiment<br>
according to the present invention now has the possibility<br>
of independently designing the filter so that no high<br>
stopband attenuation is necessary to attenuate the aliasing<br>
to sufficiently low levels. The stopband attenuation has<br>
just to be low enough to allow reduced aliasing sufficient<br>
for the desired signal processing application. Thus, a<br>
better trade-off towards lower delay can be achieved in the<br>
filter design.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a comparison of a window function 700 as can,<br>
for instance, be employed in an embodiment according to the<br>
present invention along with the sine-window function 710.<br>
The window function 700, which is also referred to as a<br>
"synthesis" CMLDFB-window (CMLDFB = complex modulated low-<br>
delay filterbank), comprises 640 window coefficients based<br>
on the values given in the table in Annex 1. Concerning the<br>
magnitude of the window functions, it should be noted that<br>
general amplification factors or damping factors for<br>
adjusting an amplitude of the windowed signal are not<br>
considered in the following. Window functions can, for<br>
instance, be normalized with respect to a value<br>
corresponding to the center of delay, as outlined in the<br><br>
context of Fig. 13, or with respect to a value n = N, n = N<br>
- 1 or n = N + 1, wherein N is the block length and n is<br>
the index of the window coefficients. In comparison, the<br>
sine-window function 710 is only defined over 128 samples<br>
and is, for instance, employed in the case of an MDCT or an<br>
MDST module.<br>
However, depending on implementational details, to obtain<br>
the window coefficients based on the values given in the<br>
tables in the Annexes 1 and 3, additional sign changes with<br>
respect to the window coefficients corresponding to the<br>
indices 128 to 255 and 384 to 511 (multiplication with<br>
factor (-1)) should be considered according to equation<br>
(16a) and (16b).<br>
Before discussing the differences of the two window<br>
functions 700, 710, it should be noted that both window<br>
functions comprise real-valued window coefficients only.<br>
Moreover, in both cases, an absolute value of the window<br>
coefficient corresponding to an index n = 0 is smaller than<br>
0.1. In the case of a CMLDFB-window 700, the respective<br>
value is even smaller than 0.02.<br>
Considering the two window functions 700, 710 with respect<br>
to their definition sets, several significant differences<br>
are evident. Whereas the sine-window function 710 is<br>
symmetric, the window function 700 shows an asymmetric<br>
behavior. To define this more clearly, the sine-window<br>
function is symmetric as a real-valued value no exists so<br>
that with respect to all real numbers n, so that the window<br>
function 710 is defined for (no+n) and (no-n) , the relation<br><br>
is fulfilled to a desirable margin (e &gt; 0; the absolute<br>
value of the difference of the terms on the two sides of<br>
equation (29) is smaller than or equal to e) , wherein w(n)<br>
represents the window coefficient corresponding to the<br><br>
index n. In the case of the sine-window the respective<br>
index no is exactly in the middle of the two topmost window<br>
coefficients. In other words, for the sine-window 710 the<br>
index is n0 = 63.5. The sine-window function is defined for<br>
indices n = 0, ..., 127.<br>
In contrast, the window function 700 is defined over the<br>
set of indices n = 0, ..., 639. The window function 700 is<br>
clearly asymmetric in the sense that for all real-valued<br>
numbers n0 at least one real number always exists so that<br>
(no+n) and (no-n) belong to the definition set of the<br>
window function, for which the inequality<br><br>
holds to an (almost deliberately) definable margin (ε &gt; 0;<br>
the absolute value of the difference of the terms on the<br>
two sides of equation (29) is greater than or equal to s) ,<br>
wherein once again w(n) is the window coefficient<br>
corresponding to the index n.<br>
Further differences between the two window functions, which<br>
both relate to block sizes of N = 64 samples, is that the<br>
maximum value of the window function 700 are larger than 1<br>
and is acquired for indices in the range of<br><br>
for the synthesis window. In the case of the window<br>
function 700 shown in Fig. 11, the maximum value acquired<br>
is larger than 1.04 acquired at the sample index n = 77. In<br>
contrast, the maximum values of the sine-window 710 is<br>
smaller than or equal to 1, which is acquired at n = 63 and<br>
n = 64.<br>
However, also the window function 700 acquires a value of<br>
approximately 1 at sample indices around n = N. To be more<br>
precise, the absolute value or the value itself of the<br><br>
window coefficient w(N-l) corresponding to the index n = N-<br>
1 is smaller than 1, whereas the absolute value or the<br>
value itself of the window coefficient w(N) corresponding<br>
to the index n = N is larger than 1. In some embodiments<br>
according to the present invention, these two window<br>
coefficients obey the relations<br><br>
which is a result of optimizing the audio quality of the<br>
filterbanks according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention. In many cases it is desirable to have a window<br>
coefficient w(0) comprising an absolute value as small as<br>
possible. In this case, a determinant of the window<br>
coefficients<br><br>
should be as close as possible to 1 to achieve an audio<br>
quality, which is optimized with respect to the possible<br>
parameters. The sign of the determinant as given by<br>
equation (33) is, however, freely choosable. As a<br>
consequence of the window coefficient w(0) being smaller or<br>
approximately 0, the product of w(N-l) • w(N) or its<br>
absolute values should be as close as possible to +/- 1. In<br>
this case, the window coefficient w(2N-l) can then be<br>
chosen almost freely. Equation (33) is a result of<br>
employing the technique of zero-delay matrices as described<br>
in "New Framework for Modulated Perfect Reconstruction<br>
Filter Banks" by G.D.T. Schuller and M.J.T. Smith, IEEE<br>
Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol. 44, No. 8, August<br>
1996.<br>
Furthermore, as will be outlined in more detail in the<br>
context of Fig. 13, the window coefficients corresponding<br>
to the indices N-l and N are comprised in the middle of the<br>
modulation core and therefore correspond to the sample<br><br>
having a value of approximately 1.0 and which coincides<br>
with the delay of the filterbank as defined by the<br>
prototype filter function or the window function.<br>
The synthesis window function 700 as shown in Fig. 11<br>
furthermore shows an oscillating behavior with strictly<br>
monotonic increasing window coefficients from the window<br>
coefficient of the sequence of window coefficients<br>
corresponding to the index (n = 0) used for windowing the<br>
latest time-domain audio sample up to the window<br>
coefficient comprising the highest absolute value of all<br>
window coefficients of the synthesis window function 700.<br>
Naturally, in the case of the time-reversed analysis window<br>
function, the oscillating behavior comprises a strictly<br>
monotonic decrease of the window coefficients from the<br>
window coefficient comprising the highest absolute value of<br>
all window coefficients of a corresponding (time-reverse)<br>
analysis window function to the window coefficients of the<br>
sequence of window coefficients corresponding to an index<br>
(n = 639) used for windowing the latest time-domain audio<br>
sample.<br>
As a consequence of the oscillating behavior, the<br>
development of the synthesis window function 700 starts<br>
with a window coefficient corresponding to the index n = 0<br>
having an absolute value smaller than 0.02 and an absolute<br>
value of the window coefficient corresponding to the index<br>
n = 1 of lower than 0.03, acquiring a value of about 1 at<br>
an index n = N, acquiring a maximum value of more than 1.04<br>
at an index according to equation (31), acquiring a further<br>
value of approximately 1 at an index n = 90 and 91, a first<br>
sign change at the index values of n = 162 and n = 163,<br>
acquiring a minimal value of less than -0.1 or -0.12755 at<br>
an index of approximately n = 3N and a further sign change<br>
at index values n = 284 and n = 285. However, the synthesis<br>
window function 700 further may comprise further sign<br>
changes at further index values n. When comparing the<br>
window coefficients to the values given in the tables in<br><br>
the Annexes 1 and 3, the additional sign changes with<br>
respect to the window coefficients corresponding to the<br>
indices 128 to 255 and 384 to 511 (multiplication with<br>
factor (-1)) should be considered according to equations<br>
(16a) and (16b).<br>
The oscillating behavior of the synthesis window function<br>
700 is similar to that of a strongly damped oscillation,<br>
which is illustrated by the maximum value of about 1.04 and<br>
the minimum value of about -0.12. As a consequence, more<br>
than 50% of all window coefficients comprise absolute<br>
values being smaller than or equal to 0.1. As outlined in<br>
the context of the embodiments described in Figs. 1 and 2a,<br>
the development of the window function comprises a first<br>
group 420 (or 200) and a second group 430 (or 210), wherein<br>
the first group 420 comprises a first consecutive portion<br>
of window coefficients and the second group 430 comprises a<br>
consecutive second portion of window coefficients. As<br>
already outlined before, the sequence of window<br>
coefficients of the window comprises only the first group<br>
420 of window coefficients and the second group of window<br>
functions 430, wherein the first group 420 of window<br>
coefficients exactly comprises the first consecutive<br>
sequence of window coefficients, and wherein the second<br>
group 430 exactly comprises the second consecutive portion<br>
of window coefficients. Hence, the terms first group 420<br>
and first portion of window coefficients as well as the<br>
terms second group 430 and second portion of window<br>
coefficients can be used synonymously.<br>
The more than 50% of all window coefficients having<br>
absolute values smaller than or equal to 0.1 are comprised<br>
in the second group or second portion 430 of window<br>
coefficients as a consequence of the strongly damped<br>
oscillatory behavior of the window function 700. Moreover,<br>
also more than 50% of all window coefficients comprised in<br>
the second group or second portion 430 of window<br><br>
coefficients comprise absolute values of less than or equal<br>
to 0.01.<br>
The first portion 420 of window coefficients comprises less<br>
than one third of all window coefficients of the sequence<br>
of window coefficients. Accordingly, the second portion 430<br>
of window coefficients comprises more than two thirds of<br>
window coefficients. In the case of a total number of<br>
blocks T to be processed in one of the frames 120, 150,<br>
330, 380 of more than four blocks, the first portion<br>
typically comprises 3/2 • N window coefficients, wherein N<br>
is the number of time-domain samples of one block.<br>
Accordingly, the second portion comprises the rest of the<br>
window coefficients or, to be more precise, (T-3/2)N window<br>
coefficients. In the case of T = 10 blocks per frame as<br>
shown in Fig. 11, the first portion comprises 3/2 • N<br>
window coefficients, whereas the second portion 210<br>
comprises 8.5 • N window coefficients. In the case of a<br>
block size of N = 64 time-domain audio samples per block,<br>
the first portion comprises 96 window coefficients, whereas<br>
the second portion comprises 544 window coefficients. The<br>
synthesis window function 700 as shown in Fig. 11 acquires<br>
a value of approximately 0.96 at the border of the first<br>
portion and the second portion at an index of around n = 95<br>
or 96.<br>
Despite the number of window coefficients comprised in the<br>
first portion 420 and the second portion 430, an energy<br>
value or a total energy value of corresponding window<br>
coefficients differ significantly from one another. The<br>
energy value as defined by<br><br>
wherein w(n) is a window coefficient and the index n over<br>
which the sum in equation (34) is evaluated corresponds to<br>
the indices of the respective portions 420, 430, the whole<br><br>
set of window coefficients or any other set of window<br>
coefficients to which the respective energy values E<br>
corresponds. Despite the significant difference of window<br>
coefficients, the energy value of the first portion 420 is<br>
equal to or higher than 2/3 of the overall energy value of<br>
all window coefficients. Accordingly, the energy value of<br>
the second portion 430 is smaller than or equal to 1/3 of<br>
the overall energy value of all window coefficients.<br>
To illustrate this, the energy value of the first portion<br>
420 of the window coefficients of the window function 700<br>
is approx. 55.85, while the energy value of the window<br>
coefficients of the second portion 430 is approx. 22.81.<br>
The overall energy value of all window coefficients of the<br>
window function 700 is approx. 78.03, so that the energy<br>
value of the first portion 420 is approx. 71.6% of the<br>
overall energy value, while the energy value of the second<br>
portion 430 is approx. 28.4% of the overall energy value of<br>
all window coefficients.<br>
Naturally, equation (34) can be stated in a normalized<br>
version by dividing the energy value E by a normalization<br>
factor Eo, which can in principle be any energy value. The<br>
normalization factor E0 may, for instance, be the overall<br>
energy value of all window coefficients of the sequence of<br>
window coefficients calculated according to equation (34).<br>
Based on the absolute values of the window coefficients or<br>
based on the energy values of the respective window<br>
coefficients, also a center point or a "center of mass" of<br>
the sequence of window coefficients can be determined. The<br>
center of mass or the center point of the sequence of<br>
window coefficients is a real number and typically lies in<br>
the range of indices of the first portion 420 of the window<br>
coefficients. In the case of the respective frames<br>
comprising more than four blocks of time-domain audio<br>
samples (T &gt; 4), the center of mass nca based on the<br>
absolute values of the window coefficients or the center of<br><br>
mass nce based on the energy values of the window<br>
coefficients is smaller than 3/2 • N. In other words, in<br>
the case of T = 10 blocks per frame, the center of mass<br>
lies well within the region of indices of the first portion<br>
200.<br>
The center of mass nca based on the absolute values of the<br>
window coefficients w(n) are defined according to<br><br>
and the center of mass nce in view of the energy values of<br>
the window coefficients w(n) are defined according to<br><br>
wherein N and T are positive integers indicating the number<br>
of time-domain audio samples per block and the number of<br>
blocks per frame, respectively. Naturally, the center<br>
points according to equations (35) and (36) can also be<br>
calculated with respect to a limited set of window<br>
coefficients by replacing the limits of the sums above<br>
accordingly.<br>
For the window function 700 as shown in Fig. 1, the center<br>
of mass nca based on the absolute values of the window<br>
coefficients w(n) is equal to a value of nCa « 87.75 and<br>
the center point or center of mass nce with respect to the<br>
energy values of the window coefficients w(n) is nce ~<br>
80.04. As the first portion 200 of window coefficients of<br>
the window function 700 comprises 96 (= 3/2 . N; N = 64)<br>
window coefficients, both center points lie well within the<br><br>
first portion 200 of the window coefficients, as previously<br>
outlined.<br>
The window coefficients w(n) of the window function 700 are<br>
based on the values given in the table in Annex 1. However,<br>
to achieve, for instance, the low-delay property of the<br>
filterbank as outlined before, it is not necessary to<br>
implement the window function as precisely as given by the<br>
window coefficients in the table of Annex 1. In many cases,<br>
it is more than sufficient for the window coefficients of a<br>
window function comprising 640 window coefficients to<br>
fulfill any of the relations or equations given in the<br>
tables of Annexes 2 to 4. The window coefficients or filter<br>
coefficients given in the table in Annex 1 represent<br>
preferred values, which might be adapted according to<br>
equations (16a) and (16b) in some implementations. However,<br>
as indicated, for instance, by the further tables given in<br>
the further Annexes, the preferred values can be varied<br>
from the second, third, fourth, fifth digit after the<br>
decimal point so that the resulting filters or window<br>
functions still have the advantages of embodiments<br>
according to the present invention. However, depending on<br>
implementational details, to obtain the window coefficients<br>
based on the values given in the tables in the Annexes 1<br>
and 3, additional sign changes with respect to the window<br>
coefficients corresponding to the indices 128 to 255 and<br>
384 to 511 (multiplication with factor (-1)) should be<br>
considered according to the equations (16a) and (16b).<br>
Naturally, further window functions comprising a different<br>
number of window coefficients can equally be defined and be<br>
used in the framework of embodiments according to the<br>
present invention. In this context it should be noted that<br>
both the number of time-domain audio samples per block and<br>
the number of blocks per frame as well as the distribution<br>
of the blocks with respect to past samples and future<br>
samples can be varied over a wide range of parameters.<br><br>
Fig. 12 shows a comparison of a complex modulated low-delay<br>
filterbank window (CMLDFB-window) 700 as shown in Fig. 11<br>
and the original SBR QMF prototype filter 720 as employed,<br>
for instance, in the SBR tool according to the MPEG<br>
standards. As shown in Fig. 11, the CMLDFB window 700 is<br>
once again the synthesis window according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
While the window function 700 according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention is clearly asymmetric as defined in<br>
the context of equation (30), the original SBR QMF<br>
prototype filter 720 is symmetric with respect to the<br>
indices n = 319 and 320, as the window function 700 as well<br>
as the SBR QMF prototype filter 720 are each defined with<br>
respect to 640 indices each. In other words, with respect<br>
to equation (29) the "index value" n0 representing the<br>
index of the symmetry center is given by n0 = 319.5 in the<br>
case of the SBR QMF prototype filter 720.<br>
Moreover, due to the symmetry of the SBR QMF prototype<br>
filter 720, also the center point nca and nce according to<br>
equations (35) and (36), respectively, are identical to the<br>
symmetry center no. The energy value of the SBR QMF<br>
prototype filter 720 is 64.00 as the prototype filter is an<br>
orthogonal filter. In contrast, the clearly asymmetric<br>
window function 700 comprises an energy value of 78.0327 as<br>
outlined before.<br>
In the following sections of the description, SBR systems<br>
as outlined in the context of Figs. 5 and 6 will be<br>
considered, in which the SBR decoder 610 comprises<br>
embodiments according to the present invention in the form<br>
of an analysis filterbank as the filterbank 620 and an<br>
embodiment according to the present invention in the form<br>
of a synthesis filterbank for the synthesis filterbank 640.<br>
As will be outlined in more detail, the overall delay of an<br>
analysis filterbank according to the present invention<br>
employing the window function 700 as shown in Figs. 11 and<br><br>
12 comprises an overall delay of 127 samples, whereas the<br>
original SBR QMF prototype filter-based SBR tool results in<br>
an overall delay of 640 samples.<br>
The replacement of the QMF filterbanks in the SBR module,<br>
for instance in the SBR decoder 610, by a complex-valued<br>
low-delay filterbank (CLDFB) results in a delay reduction<br>
from 42 ms to 31.3 ms without introducing any degradation<br>
of audio quality or additional computational complexity.<br>
With the new filterbank both, the standard SBR mode (high-<br>
quality mode) and the low-power mode employing only real-<br>
valued filterbanks, are supported, as the description of<br>
embodiments according to the present invention with respect<br>
to Figs. 7 to 10 has shown.<br>
Especially in the field of telecommunication and bi-<br>
directional communication, a low-delay is of great<br>
importance. While the enhanced low-delay AAC is already<br>
capable of achieving a delay low enough for communication<br>
applications of 42 ms, its algorithmic delay is still<br>
higher than that of the low-delay AAC corecodec, which is<br>
capable of achieving delays of down to 20 ms and that of<br>
other telecommunication codecs. In the SBR decoder 610, the<br>
QMF analysis and synthesis stages still cause a<br>
reconstruction delay of 12 ms. A promising approach to<br>
reduce that delay is to utilize a low-delay filterbank<br>
technique according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention and to replace the current QMF filterbanks by a<br>
respective low-delay version according to the embodiments<br>
of the present invention. In other words, a further delay<br>
reduction is achieved by simply replacing the regular<br>
filterbanks used in the SBR module 610 by a complex low-<br>
delay filterbank according to the embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
For the usage in the SBR module 610, the new filterbanks<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention, which<br>
are also referred to as CLDFBs, are designed to be as<br><br>
similar to the originally used QMF filterbanks as possible.<br>
This includes, for instance, the use of 64 subbands or<br>
bands, an equal length of the impulse responses and a<br>
compatibility with dual-rate modes as employed in SBR<br>
systems.<br>
Fig. 13 illustrates the comparison of the CLDFB window<br>
shape 700 according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention and the original SBR QMF prototype filter 720.<br>
Furthermore, it illustrates the delay of modulated<br>
filterbanks, which can be determined by analyzing the<br>
overlap delay introduced by the prototype filter or window<br>
function in addition to the framing delay of the modulation<br>
core having a length of N samples in the case of a DCT-IV-<br>
based system. The situation shown in Fig. 13 refers once<br>
again to the case of a synthesis filterbank. The window<br>
function 700 and the prototype filter function 720 also<br>
represent impulse responses of the synthesis prototype<br>
filters of the two filterbanks involved.<br>
With respect to the delay analysis for both the SBR QMF<br>
filterbank and the proposed CLDFB according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, in the analysis and<br>
the synthesis only the overlap to the right side and the<br>
left side of the modulation core, respectively, adds delay.<br>
For both filterbanks, the modulation core is based on a<br>
DCT-IV introducing a delay of 64 samples, which is marked<br>
in Fig. 13 as the delay 750. In the case of the SBR QMF<br>
prototype filter 720 due to the symmetry the modulation<br>
core delay 750 is symmetrically arranged with respect to<br>
the center of mass or center point of the respective<br>
prototype filter function 720 as indicated in Fig. 13. The<br>
reason for this behavior is that the buffer of the SBR QMF<br>
filterbank needs to be filled up to a point that the<br>
prototype filter function 720 having the most significant<br>
contribution in terms of the respective energy values of<br>
the prototype filter values will be considered in the<br><br>
processing. Due to the shape of the prototype filter<br>
function 720, this requires the buffer to be filled up at<br>
least to the center point or center of mass of the<br>
respective prototype filter function.<br>
To illustrate this further, starting from an all<br>
initialized buffer of the corresponding SBR QMF filterbank,<br>
the buffer needs to be filled up to a point that a<br>
processing of data will result in a processing of<br>
significant data, which requires the respective window<br>
function or prototype filter function to have a significant<br>
contribution. In the case of the SBR QMF prototype filter<br>
function, the symmetric shape of the prototype filter 720<br>
yields a delay, which is of the order of the center of mass<br>
or center point of the prototype filter function.<br>
However, as the delay introduced by the modulation core of<br>
the DCT-IV-based system of N = 64 for samples is always<br>
present and the system also comprises a delay of one block,<br>
it can be observed that the synthesis prototype for the SBR<br>
QMF introduces an overlap delay of 288 samples.<br>
As indicated earlier, in the case of the synthesis<br>
filterbanks to which Fig. 13 relates, this additional left-<br>
side overlap 760 causes the delay, while the right-side<br>
overlap 770 relates to past samples and therefore does not<br>
introduce an additional delay in the case of a synthesis<br>
filterbank.<br>
In contrast, starting with an all initialized buffer of the<br>
CLDFB according to an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the synthesis filterbank as well as the analysis filterbank<br>
is capable of providing "meaningful" data sooner compared<br>
to the SBR QMF filterbank due to the shape of the window<br>
function. In other words, due to the shape of the analysis<br>
or synthesis window function 700, samples processed by<br>
window functions indicative of the significant contribution<br>
is sooner possible. As a consequence, the synthesis<br><br>
prototype or synthesis window function of the CLDFB<br>
introduces only an overlap delay of 32 samples taking into<br>
account the delay already introduced by the modulation core<br>
750. The first portion 420 or first group 420 of window<br>
coefficients of the window function 700 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention comprises in a<br>
preferred embodiment according to the present invention the<br>
96 window coefficients corresponding to the delay caused by<br>
the left-side overlap 760 together with the modulation core<br>
delay 750.<br>
The same delay is introduced by the analysis filterbank or<br>
the analysis prototype function. The reason is that the<br>
analysis filterbank is based on the time-reverse version of<br>
the synthesis window function or prototype function. Thus,<br>
the overlap delay is introduced on the right side<br>
comprising the same overlap size as for the synthesis<br>
filterbank. Hence, in the case of an original QMF prototype<br>
filterbank, also a delay of 288 samples is introduced while<br>
for an analysis filterbank according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention only 32 samples are introduced as a<br>
delay.<br>
The table shown in Fig. 14a provides an overview of the<br>
delay with different modification stages assuming a frame<br>
length of 480 samples and a sampling rate of 48 kHz. In a<br>
standard configuration comprising an AAC-LD codec along<br>
with a standard SBR tool, the MDCT and IMDCT filterbanks in<br>
the dual-rate mode cause a delay of 40 ms. Moreover, the<br>
QMF tool itself causes a delay of 12 ms. Moreover, due to<br>
an SBR-overlap, a further delay of 8 ms is generated so<br>
that the overall delay of this codec is in the range of 60<br>
ms.<br>
In comparison an AAC-ELD codec comprising low-delay<br>
versions of the MDCT and the IMDCT generate in the dual-<br>
rate approach a delay of 30 ms. Compared to the original<br>
QMF filterbank of an SBR tool, employing a complex-valued<br><br>
low-delay filterbank according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention will result in a delay of only 1 ms<br>
compared to 12 ms of the original QMF tool. By avoiding the<br>
SBR-overlap the additional overlap of 8 ms of a<br>
straightforward combination of an AAC-LD and the SBR tool<br>
can be avoided completely. Therefore, the enhanced low-<br>
delay AAC codec is capable of an overall algorithmic delay<br>
of 31 ms rather than 60 ms for the straightforward<br>
combination previously outlined. Therefore, it can be seen<br>
that the combination of the described delay reduction<br>
methods indeed results in a total delay saving of 29 ms.<br>
The table in Fig. 14b gives a further overview of the<br>
overall codec delay caused by the original and the proposed<br>
filterbank versions in a system as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
The data and values given in Fig. 14b are based on a<br>
sampling rate of 48 kHz and a core coder frame size of 480<br>
samples. Due to the dual-rate approach of a SBR system as<br>
shown and discussed in Figs. 5 and 6, the core coder is<br>
effectively running at a sampling rate of 24 kHz. Since the<br>
framing delay of 64 samples for the modulation core is<br>
already introduced by the core coder, it can be subtracted<br>
from the standalone delay values of the two filterbanks as<br>
described in the context of Fig. 13.<br>
The table in Fig. 14b underlines that it is possible to<br>
reduce the overall delay of the enhanced low-delay AAC<br>
codec comprising the low-delay versions of the MDCT and the<br>
IMDCT (LD MDCT and LD IMDCT). While an overall algorithmic<br>
delay of 42 ms is achievable only by employing the low-<br>
delay versions of the MDCT and the IMDCT as well as the<br>
original QMF filterbanks, by using complex-valued low-delay<br>
filterbanks according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention instead of the conventional QMF filterbanks, the<br>
overall algorithmic delay can be significantly reduced to<br>
only 31.3 ms.<br><br>
To evaluate the quality of the filterbanks according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention and systems comprising<br>
one or more filterbanks, listening tests have been carried<br>
out, from which it can be concluded that filterbanks<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention keep the<br>
audio quality of AAC-ELD at the same level and do not<br>
introduce any degradation, neither for the complex SBR mode<br>
nor for the real-valued low-power SBR mode. Thus, the<br>
delay-optimized filterbanks according to embodiments of the<br>
present invention do not introduce any burden on the audio<br>
quality although they are capable of reducing the delay by<br>
more than 10 ms. For the transient items it can even be<br>
observed that some slight, but not statistically<br>
significant improvements are achievable. The above-<br>
mentioned improvements have been observed during listening<br>
tests of castagnettes and glockenspiels.<br>
In order to further verify that the downsampling in the<br>
case of a 32-band filterbank according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention works equally well for the<br>
filterbanks according to the present invention compared to<br>
QMF filterbanks, the following evaluation was performed.<br>
First, a logarithmic sine sweep was analyzed with a<br>
downsampled 32-band filterbank, wherein the 32 upper bands,<br>
initialized with zeros, were added. Afterwards, the outcome<br>
was synthesized by a 64-band filterbank, downsampled again<br>
and compared to the original signal. Using a conventional<br>
SBR QMF prototype filter results in a signal-to-noise ratio<br>
(SNR) of 59.5 dB. A filterbank according to the present<br>
invention, however, achieves an SNR value of 78.5 dB, which<br>
illustrates that filterbanks according to embodiments of<br>
the present invention also perform in the downsampled<br>
version at least as well as the original QMF filterbanks.<br>
In order to show that this delay-optimized, non-symmetric<br>
filterbank approach as employed in embodiments according to<br>
the present invention does provide additional value<br>
compared to a classical filterbank with a symmetric<br><br>
prototype, asymmetric prototypes will be compared with<br>
symmetric prototypes having the same delay in the<br>
following.<br>
Fig. 15a shows a comparison of a frequency response in a<br>
far-field illustration of a filterbank according to the<br>
present invention employing a low-delay window (graph 800)<br>
compared to the frequency response of a filterbank<br>
employing a sine-window having a length of 128 taps (graph<br>
810). Fig. 15b shows a magnification of the frequency<br>
response in the near-field of the same filterbanks<br>
employing the same window functions as outlined before.<br>
A direct comparison of the two graphs 800, 810 shows that<br>
the frequency response of the filterbank employing a low-<br>
delay filterbank according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention is significantly better than the corresponding<br>
frequency response of a filterbank employing a sine-window<br>
of 128 taps having the same delay.<br>
Also, Fig. 16a shows a comparison of different window<br>
functions with an overall delay of 127 samples. The<br>
filterbank (CLDFB) with 64 bands comprises an overall delay<br>
of 127 samples including the framing delay and the overlap<br>
delay. A modulated filterbank with a symmetric prototype<br>
and the same delay would, therefore, have a prototype of a<br>
length of 128, as already illustrated in the context of<br>
Figs. 15a and 15b. For these filterbanks with 50% overlap,<br>
such as, for instance, the MDCT, sine-windows or Kaiser-<br>
Bessel-derived windows generally provide a good choice for<br>
prototypes. Hence, in Fig. 16a an overview of a frequency<br>
response of a filterbank employing a low-delay window as a<br>
prototype according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention is compared to the frequency responses of<br>
alternative symmetric prototypes with the same delay. Fig.<br>
16a shows, apart from the frequency response of the<br>
filterbank according to the present invention (graph 800)<br>
and the frequency response of a filterbank employing a<br><br>
sine-window (graph 810), as already shown in Figs. 15a and<br>
15b, furthermore two KBD windows based on the parameters a<br>
= 4 (graph 820) and a = 6 (graph 830). Both, Fig. 16a and<br>
the close-up of Fig. 16a shown in Fig. 16b, clearly show<br>
that a much better frequency response can be achieved with<br>
a filterbank according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention having a non-symmetric window function or a<br>
prototype filter function with the same delay.<br>
To illustrate this advantage on a more general basis, in<br>
Fig. 17 two filterbank prototypes with delay values<br>
different from the previously described filterbank are<br>
compared. While the filterbank according to the present<br>
invention, which was considered in Figs. 15 and 16, has an<br>
overall delay of 127 samples, which corresponds to an<br>
overlap of 8 blocks into the past and 0 blocks into the<br>
future (CLDFB 80), Fig. 17 shows a comparison of the<br>
frequency responses of two different filterbank prototypes<br>
with a same delay of 383 samples. To be more precise, Fig.<br>
17 shows a frequency response of a non-symmetric prototype<br>
filterbank (graph 840) according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, which is based on an overlap of 6 blocks<br>
of time-domain samples into the past and 2 blocks of time-<br>
domain samples into the future (CLDFB 62) . Moreover, Fig.<br>
17 also shows the frequency response (graph 850) of a<br>
corresponding symmetric prototype filter function also<br>
having a delay of 383 samples. It can be seen that with the<br>
same delay value a non-symmetric prototype or window<br>
function achieves a better frequency response than a<br>
filterbank with a symmetric window function or prototype<br>
filter. This demonstrates the possibility of a better<br>
trade-off between delay and quality, as indicated earlier.<br>
Fig. 18 illustrates the temporal masking effect of the<br>
human ear. When a sound or a tone appears at a moment in<br>
time indicated by a line 860 in Fig. 18, a masking effect<br>
concerning the frequency of the tone or the sound and<br>
neighboring frequencies arises approximately 20 ms before<br><br>
the actual sound starts. This effect is called pre-masking<br>
and is one aspect of the psychoacoustic properties of the<br>
human ear.<br>
In the situation illustrated in Fig. 18, the sound remains<br>
audible for approximately 200 ms until a moment in time<br>
illustrated by a line 870. During this time, a masker of<br>
the human ear is active, which is also called simultaneous<br>
masking. After the sound stops (illustrated by line 870),<br>
the masking of the frequency in the neighboring frequency<br>
of the tone slowly decays over a period of time of<br>
approximately 150 ms as illustrated in Fig. 18. This<br>
psychoacoustic effect is also referred to as post-masking.<br>
Fig. 19 illustrates a comparison of a pre-echo behavior of<br>
a conventional HE-AAC coded signal and an HE-AAC coded<br>
signal which is based on a filterbank employing a low-delay<br>
filterbank (CMLDFB) according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Fig. 19a illustrates the original time<br>
signal of castagnettes, which have been processed with a<br>
system comprising an HE-AAC codec (HE-AAC = high-efficiency<br>
advanced audio codec). The output of the system based on<br>
the conventional HE-AAC is illustrated in Fig. 19b. A<br>
direct comparison of the two signals, the original time<br>
signal and the output signal of the HE-AAC codec shows that<br>
prior to the beginning of the sound of the castagnettes in<br>
the area illustrated by an arrow 880 the output signal of<br>
the HE-AAC codec comprises noticeable pre-echo effects.<br>
Fig. 19c illustrates an output signal of a system<br>
comprising an HE-AAC based on filterbanks comprising<br>
CMLDFB-windows according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The same original time signals indicated in Fig.<br>
19a and processed using filterbanks according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention show a significantly<br>
reduced appearance of pre-echo effects just prior to the<br>
beginning of a castagnettes signal as indicated by an arrow<br>
890 in Fig. 19c. Due to the pre-masking effect as described<br><br>
in the context of Fig. 18, the pre-echo effect indicated by<br>
the arrow 890 of Fig. 19c will be far better masked than<br>
the pre-echo effects indicated by the arrow 880 in the case<br>
of the conventional HE-AAC codec. Therefore, the pre-echo<br>
behavior of filterbanks according to the present invention,<br>
which is also a result of the significantly reduced delay<br>
compared to conventional filterbanks, causes the output to<br>
be far better fitted to the temporal masking properties and<br>
the psychoacoustics of the human ear. As a consequence, as<br>
was already indicated when describing the listening tests,<br>
employing filterbanks according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention can even lead to an improvement<br>
concerning the quality caused by the reduced delay.<br>
Embodiments according to the present invention do not<br>
increase the computational complexity compared to<br>
conventional filterbanks. Low-delay filterbanks use the<br>
same filter length and the same mode of modulation as, for<br>
instance, QMF filterbanks in the case of SBR systems such<br>
that the computational complexity does not increase. In<br>
terms of memory requirements due to the asymmetric nature<br>
of the prototype filters, the ROM (read-only memory) memory<br>
requirement for the synthesis filterbank increase<br>
approximately by 320 words in the case of a filterbank<br>
based on N = 64 samples per block and T = 10 blocks per<br>
frame. Moreover, in the case of an SBR-related system, the<br>
memory requirement further increases by another 320 words<br>
if the analysis filter is stored separately.<br>
However, as the current ROM requirements for an AAC-ELD<br>
core is approximately 2.5 k words (kilo words) and for the<br>
SBR implementation another 2.5 k words, the ROM requirement<br>
is only moderately increased by about 10%. As a possible<br>
trade-off between memory and complexity, if a low memory<br>
consumption is paramount, a linear interpolation can be<br>
used to generate the analysis filter from the synthesis<br>
filter as outlined in the context of Fig. 3 and equation<br>
(15). This interpolation operation increases the number of<br><br>
necessary instructions by only approximately 3.6%.<br>
Therefore, a replacement of the conventional QMF<br>
filterbanks in the framework of SBR modules by low-delay<br>
filterbanks according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the delay can be reduced in some embodiments by<br>
more than 10 ms without any degradation of audio quality or<br>
noticeable increase in complexity.<br>
Embodiments according to the present invention therefore<br>
relate to an analysis or synthesis window or apparatus or<br>
method for windowing. Moreover, an analysis or synthesis<br>
filterbank or method of analyzing or synthesizing a signal<br>
using a window is described. Naturally, the computer<br>
program implementing one of the above methods is also<br>
disclosed.<br>
Implementation according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention can be carried out as hardware implementations,<br>
software implementations or a combination of both. Data,<br>
vectors and variables generated, received or otherwise<br>
stored to be processed may be stored in different kinds of<br>
memories such as random-access memories, buffers, Read-Only<br>
memories, non-volatile memories (e.g. EEPROMs, flash-<br>
memories) or other memories such as magnetic or optical<br>
memories. A storage position may, for instance, be one or<br>
more memory units required to store or save the respective<br>
amounts of data, such as variables, parameters, vectors,<br>
matrices, window coefficients or other pieces of<br>
information and data.<br>
Software implementations may be operated on different<br>
computers, computer-like systems, processors, ASICs<br>
(application-specific integrated circuits) or other<br>
integrated circuits (ICs).<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of<br>
embodiments of the inventive methods, embodiments of the<br>
inventive methods can be implemented in hardware, software<br><br>
or in a combination of both. The implementation can be<br>
performed using a digital storage medium, in particular a<br>
disc CD, a DVD or another disc having an electronically<br>
readable control signal stored thereon which cooperates<br>
with a programmable computer system, processor or<br>
integrated circuit such that an embodiment of the inventive<br>
method is performed. Generally, an embodiment of the<br>
present invention is, therefore, a computer program product<br>
with a program code stored on a machine-readable carrier,<br>
the program code being operated for performing an<br>
embodiment of the inventive methods when the computer<br>
program product runs on a computer, processor or integrated<br>

inventive methods when the computer program runs on a<br>
