This   invention   relates   to   a   pigment   dispersion for   color filter.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
a)  Field of the Invention<br>
1.        ¦ *                               t _ *¦    *".  dispersions for<br>
the production of color filters (hereinafter called r pigment d* p._r n . r - "o- ;c '   «'lt^rs"), which are ex** cellent m 14.ai
b)  Descript . w . c: ,r.    ,  if....<br>
A ccLcr filter, which is useful for the production of rf liquid crystal color display, an iirage pickup device or the liK ,^ i, ¦  ventionally been rroduc * primarily by spin-coat _&gt;.j a.  color filter subbttdtf ~ i th a pigment, dispersion fur a jolor filter - said pig.r it dispersion containing r i jments of three colors, that is, red (P.) , gre*  \        . . blue (B) dispersed  n a solution of a photosensitive resin - to form a color film, exposing the color film to light through a photomask, and then developing the exposed color film to form the ce  r film into a pattern so that desired pixels are for  d on the color filter substrate.<br>
As primary pigments for use in the production of color filters, pM-v -1&gt; -¦ --nine green, for example, c*I.<br>
- 2 -<br>
pigment green (hereinafter called "P.G.") 36 is generally used as a green color, anthraquinone red, for example, C.I. pigment red (hereinafter called "P.R.") 177 is generally employed as a red color, and phthalo-cyanine blue, for example, C.I. pigment blue (hereinafter called "P.B.") 15:6 is generally used as a blue color.  There are however differences between the hues of these pigments and color characteristics required for liquid crystal displays.  For a green pigment and a red pigment, a yellow pigment is therefore used in combination in a small amount as a complementary color, and for a blue pigment, a purple pigment is also used in combination in a small amount as a complementary color.<br>
A pigment dispersion for a color filter is generally composed of a pigment, a dispersant, a film-forming resin and a liquid medium.  As the film-forming resin, an acrylic resin having an acid value high enough to permit development with an aqueous alkaline solution after the formation of a film is mainly adopted.  However, a pigment dispersion formed of the above-described conventional pigment and the acrylic resin of the high acid value has poor storage stability in many instances.  Flocculation of the pigment therefore takes place so that the viscosity of the pigment<br>
- 3 -<br>
dispersion tends to become higher with time.<br>
When a color filter is produced by using the pigment dispersion accompanied by such difficulties as described above, the pigment dispersion is coated on a color filter substrate by spin-coating.  If the viscosity of the pigment dispersion is high or if pigment particles in the dispersion undergo flocculation and the pigment dispersion exhibits thixotropic viscosity, The pigment dispersion so coated becomes thicker around a central portion of the substrate.  This leads to occurrence of unevenness in color hue and a difference in color density between the resulting color film at the central part of the substrate and that at a peripheral part of the substrate upon production of a large-screen color filter.<br>
Accordingly, a pigment dispersion for a color filter must be in such a stable dispersion state of the pigment as being free from mutual flocculation of its pigment particles and must have a low viscosity of from 5 to 20 centipoises viscosity and excellent storage stability, despite its pigment content is generally in a range of from 5 to 10 wt.%.  With a view to meeting performance requirements for such pigment dispersions for color filters, a variety of dispersants are disclosed in JP 60-237403 A and JP 60-247603 A.  Pigment<br>
- 4 -<br>
dispersions making use of these pigment dispersants (hereinafter simply called "dispersants") are accompanied by a drawback in that they show neither sufficiently low viscosity nor sufficiently high dispersion stability and also by another drawback in that the maximum absorption wavelengths at RGB pixels in color filters produced from these pigment dispersions are caused to shift toward a lower wavelength side or a shorter wavelength side, thereby lowering their color quality as color filters for liquid crystal displays.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To develop a dispersant capable of solving the above-described drawbacks of the conventional dispersants and also of permitting formulation of a pigment dispersion for a color filter, said pigment dispersion being provided with improved color quality and lowered viscosity, the present inventors have proceeded with an extensive investigation.  As a result, it has been found that particular derivatives of triazinyl-aminoanthraquinone dyestuff commonly act as excellent dispersants for a phthalocyanine blue as a primary pigment for a blue color and a purple pigment as a complementary pigment therefor, an anthraquinone red (P.R. 177) and pyrrolopyrrole pigments (P.R. 254, P.O. 71)<br>
- 5 -<br>
and a yellow pigment as a complementary pigment therefor, and a phthalocyanine green (P.G. 36) as a primary pigment for a green color and a yellow color as a complementary pigment therefor and can achieve reductions in the viscosities of pigment dispersions.  It has also been found that the resultant pigment dispersions can be prevented from thickening and gelatinization during storage and have been improved in clarity, a most important property for color filters.  These findings have led to the completion of the present invention.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a pigment dispersion for a color filter, said pigment dispersion being composed of a pigment, a dispersant, a film-forming resin and a liquid medium, wherein said dispersant comprises a compound represented by the following formula (I):<br>
wherein X and X' each independently represent a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, a<br>
- 6 -<br>
primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, or an acylamino group; Y represents an anthraquinonylamino, phenylamino or phenoxy group having a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, or an acylamino group at the 4-position or 5-position thereof; A and B each independently represent an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group or an aryl group, and at least one of A and B has at least one substituent group containing a basic nitrogen atom; and Z represents a hydrogen atom, a cyano group, a halogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a nitro group, a benzoylamino group or a 3-benzoyl group, and said 3-benzoyl group may be fused together with X to form an acridone ring.<br>
The term "at least one substituent group containing a basic nitrogen atom" as used herein may mean a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, a quaternary ammonium group or a pyridinium group, with a tertiary amino group being particularly preferred.<br>
The pigment dispersion according to the present invention for the color filter is characterized in the use of the particular derivative of the triazinylamino-anthraquinone dyestuff as the dispersant for the pigment.  Owing to the use of the dispersant, flocculation of particles of the pigment in the pigment dispersion<br>
- 7 -<br>
for the color filter can be prevented.  As a consequence, the pigment dispersion for the color filter has been lowered in structural viscosity, and has a low viscosity.  The pigment dispersion is prevented from thickening and gelatinization, and is provided with increased storage stability.  Further, the dispersant represented by the formula (I) has by itself a color tone of yellowish red-bluish red-blue.  When this dispersant is used as a dispersant for a blue pigment and a purple pigment as a complementary color pigment for the blue pigment, a green pigment and a yellow pigment as a complementary color pigment for the green pigment, and a red pigment and a yellow pigment as a complementary color pigment for the red pigment, respectively, and the resulting pigment dispersions are used for the formation of pixels of color filters in a liquid crystal color display or the like, the pixels can be formed with desired color quality.<br>
According to the present invention, the use of the specific dispersant makes it possible to prepare the pigment dispersion stably.  Further, eventual use of the pigment dispersion as a pigment dispersion for a color filter results in a color film excellent in spectral curve characteristics, high in vividness and brightness, high in clarity, and also superb in various<br>
- 8 -<br>
fastness such as light fastness, heat resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance and waterproof-hess.  Therefore, color filters can be obtained with these excellent characteristics.<br>

The pigment dispersion according to the present invention for the color filter is formed of the dis-persant, the pigment, the film-forming resin, and the<br>
- 20 -<br>
liquid medium.  To prepare the pigment dispersion according to the present invention for the color filter, the above-described pigment dispersant is used in a proportion of from 0.5 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the pigment.  The effects of the dispersant for use in the present invention are not recognized practically if it is used in an amount smaller than 0.5 part by weight, but, even if it is used in an amount greater than 50 parts by weight, its effects cannot be brought about as much as the amount used.<br>
Examples of pigments suitably usable in the pigment dispersion according to the present invention for the color filter can include C.I. pigment red (hereinafter abbreviated as "P.R.") 177, P.R. 254, P.R. 242, P.R. 209, P.R. 224; C.I. pigment green (hereinafter abbreviated as "P.G.") 36, P.G. 7; C.I. pigment blue (hereinafter abbreviated as "P.B.") 15:6, P.B. 60; C.I. pigment yellow (hereinafter abbreviated as "P.Y.") 138, P.Y. 185, P.Y. 150, P.Y. 139, P.Y. 83; C.I. pigment violet (hereinafter abbreviated as "P.V.") 23; C.I. pigment black (hereinafter abbreviated as "P.BL." 6, P.BL. 7.  To eliminate or reduce a difference between the color hue of one of these pigments and color characteristics required for a liquid crystal<br>
- 21 -<br>
color display, the pigment may be used as an appropriate mixture with one or more of the remaining pigments.<br>
As a method for preparing the pigment dispersion according to the present invention for the color filter, the pigment and the dispersant are added in and premixed with an organic solvent solution or aqueous solution in which an appropriate film-forming resin is contained, and the pigment is then dispersed.  For example, the pigment and dispersant are evenly mixed and ground in a disperser such as a horizontal disperser with tumbling medium contained therein, a vertical disperser with tumbling medium contained therein, a pin mill, an attritor or a ball mill.  The mixture so obtained is thereafter added in and mixed with a solution in which the film-forming resin is contained.  As an alternative, the pigment is uniformly suspended in water or an organic solvent.  A solution with the dispersant contained therein is added to and mixed with the suspension.  Pigment particles with the dispersant adsorbed thereon is added in and mixed with a solution in which the film-forming resin is contained.  As another alternative, the pigment and dispersant are dissolved in sulfuric acid or the like and subsequent to that, the sulfuric acid solution is caused to crystall-<br>
- 22 -<br>
ize in water to separate them as a solid solution. The solid solution is added in and mixed with a solution in which the film-forming resin is contained.<br>
As the solution in which the film-forming resin is contained for dispersing the pigment into the pigment dispersion in the present invention, a solution with the film-forming resin contained therein, said solution being used in conventionally-known pigment dispersions for color filters, can be used.  As the liquid medium, an organic solvent, water, or a mixture of an organic solvent and water is used.  Illustrative of the organic solvent are ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, 3-methoxybutylacetate, cyclohexanone, and ethyl lactate.  Further, conventionally-known additives, for example, additives such as a dispersing aid, a smoothing agent and an adhering agent can /be added to the pigment dispersion.  The proportion of the pigment relative to the film-forming resin in the solution in which the film-forming resin is contained may preferably be in a range of from 5 parts by weight to 500 parts<br>
- 23 -<br>
by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film-forming resin.<br>
As the solution with the film-forming resin contained therein, either a solution with a photosensitive film-forming resin contained therein or a solution with a non-photosensitive film-forming resin contained therein can be used.  Examples of the solution with the photosensitive film-forming resin contained therein can include solutions in which photosensitive film-forming resins usable in ultraviolet curing inks and electron radiation curing inks are contained.  Illustrative of the solution with the non-photosensitive film-forming resin contained therein can be varnishes for use in printing inks such as letterpress inks, lithographic inks, intaglio gravure inks and stencil screen inks, varnishes for use in electrodeposition coating, varnishes for use in toners for electronic printing and electrostatic printing, and varnishes for use in thermal transfer ribbons.<br>
Illustrative photosensitive film-forming resins can include photosensitive resins such as photosensitive cyclizing rubber resins, photosensitive phenol resins, photosensitive polyacrylate resins, photosensitive polyamide resins, photosensitive polyimide resins, unsaturated polyester resins, polyester acrylate<br>
- 24 -<br>
resins, polyepoxy acrylate resins, polyurethane acry-late resins, polyether acrylate resins and polyol acrylate resins.  These resins can be used either singly or in combination.  Preferred resins out of the above-described photosensitive film-forming resins are alkali-developable acrylate resins each of which contains free carboxylic radicals in its molecule.  Further, various monomers can also be added as reactive extenders to solutions which contain these photosensitive film-forming resins.<br>
Further, a photo-curing, photosensitive pigment dispersion can be formed by adding a photopolymeriza-tion initiator such as benzoin ether or benzophenone to a pigment dispersion with a photosensitive resin contained therein and then kneading the resultant mixture by a conventionally-known method.  A heat-curing pigment dispersion can also be obtained by using a thermal polymerization initiator instead of the above-mentioned photopolymerization initiator.<br>
To form a color filter pattern with the above-described photosensitive pigment dispersion, it is necessary to conduct full coating on a transparent color filter substrate such as a glass substrate with the photosensitive pigment dispersion by means of a spin coater, low-speed rotating coater, roll coater,<br>
- 25 -<br>
knife coater or the like or as an alternative, to perform full printing or partial printing for a size somewhat greater than the pattern by one of various printing methods.  Subsequent to provisional drying, a photomask is brought into close contact with the coated surface or the printed surface, which is then subjected to exposure by using an extra-high pressure mercury vapor lamp to bake the pattern.  Development and washing are then conducted and if necessary, post-baking is performed, whereby the color filter pattern can be formed.<br>
Examples of the non-photosensitive film-forming resin can include cellulose acetate resins, nitrocellulose resins, styrene (co)polymers, polyvinyl butyral resins, aminoalkyd resins, polyester resins, amino-resin-modified polyester resins, polyurethane resins, acrylic polyolurethane resins, soluble polyamide resins, soluble polyimide resins, soluble polyamide-imide resins, soluble polyester-imide resins, casein, hydroxyethylcellulose, water-soluble salts of styrene-maleic acid ester copolymers, water-soluble (meth)acrylic acid ester (co)polymers, water-soluble aminoalkyd resins, water-soluble aminopolyester resins, and water-soluble polyamide resins.  These resins can be used either singly or in combination.<br>
- 26 -<br>
To form a color filter patter with the above-described non-photosensitive pigment dispersion, a few methods can be mentioned by way of example.  Namely, the color pattern can be printed directed on a similar color filter substrate with the above-described non-photosensitive pigment dispersion, for example, a printing ink for the color filter by one of the above-described various printing methods.  The color pattern can also be formed on the substrate with a water-base, electrodeposition coating formulation for the color filter.  It is also possible to form the color pattern on a transfer base material beforehand by electron printing, electrostatic printing, one of the above-described methods or the like and then to transfer the color pattern onto a color filter substrate.  Baking, surface-smoothing grinding and/or surface-protecting top coating are then conducted, as needed, by conventional methods.  It is also possible to obtain an RGB color filter by forming a black matrix in a conventional manner.<br>
The present invention will next be described more specifically by Examples and Comparative Examples, in which the designations of "part" or "parts" and "%" are all by weight. Synthesis Example 1<br>
