Separator Drum<br>
The invention relates to a separator drum.<br>
in separators having a vertical rotational axis, product is generally supplied to the separator drum along the machine axis through an intake pipe and radial distribution channels positioned downstream from said pipe; in the separator drum the product enters a disk stack comprised of conical (separator) disks, generally arranged close to one another, and spaced somewhat from one another.  Heavier solids generally settle out on the bottom side of the separator disk and travel toward the outer periphery of the disk stack, while the liquid flows inward (two-phase liquid/solid separation). Solids are frequently removed via nozzles or via solid materia! discharge openings that have piston valves connected upstream.<br>
The drum with a vertical rotational axis generally comprises a lower drum section and an upper drum section or cover section, which are screwed to one another by a separate locking ring. This type of construction is known, for example, from DE 35 11 422 or from DE 39 36 165 Al. A direct insertion of the lower drum section into the upper drum section - see, for example, US 2,369.222 orEP 0 312 233 Bl, can lead to indefinite operating conditions, since the currently customary high operating speeds of up to 10,000 rpm can cause the drum sections to expand too much, which in turn can lead to a lack of precise guidance of the parts in relation to one another. This is also true of the idea of a direct screw connection between a lower drum section and a cover. Constructions of this type are used in the centrifuge of EP 0309 478 Bl and the generic separator of US 1,356,274.<br>
Nevertheless, a functional direct connection between the upper drum section (also called the drum cover) and the lower drum section that does not require a centering ring and is fully functional even at higher rotational speeds would be of great interest.<br>
The object of the invention is a solution to the above-stated problem.<br>
The invention attains this object with the object of claim 1.<br><br>
The invention provides a separator drum for a separator with a vertical rotational axis, with an upper drum section and a lower drum section, wherein a screw connection or threaded connection is formed between the upper drum section and the lower drum section, wherein either the upper drum section is screwed directly into the lower drum section, or the lower drum section is screwed directly into the upper drum section, without a locking ring, and wherein in each case the respective inner drum section in the vicinity' of the screw connection clamps or engages behind the outer drum section on the outside in the vicinity of a clamping .element.<br>
This construction has many pronounced advantages.<br>
The locking ring is eliminated as a separate component, making the solution cost-effective.<br>
The penetration of dirt is reliably prevented by the configuration of the threaded area.<br>
The clamping element counteracts the centrifugal expansion especially of the lower drum section, and ensures a centering and guidance of the load-bearing drum sections in relation to one another.<br>
Advantageous embodiments may be found in the sub-claims.<br>
A centering ring that clamps or engages behind the drum section on the outside is known from PCT/SE/00249, however said publication does not disclose the idea of a direct clamping combined with a screw connection.<br>
The surfaces of the upper drum section and the lower drum section that rest against one another in the vicinity of the clamping element are preferably conical or cylindrical in structure.<br>
fn constructive terms, it is advantageous for<br>
the upper drum section to be screwed into the lower drum section and to have a lower projection, which engages behind an upper ring collar oh the outside of the lower drum section to form the clamping element [connection].<br><br>
wherein the upper drum section is preferably conical in shape on the exterior and the interior, with its lower area transitioning into a segment that is cylindrical at least on its outer periphery and<br>
wherein it is further preferable for the lower drum section to be conical in shape on the exterior and the interior, with its upper area transitioning into a segment that is cylindrical on the exterior and the interior.<br>
With this embodiment, preferably piston valves and/or other discharge systems can be easily used, despite the simplified connection between the lower drum section and the upper drum section.<br>
The structure of the lower drum section can be simplified because it no longer requires a contact point for the drum cover. Based upon the outer diameter of the drum, the outer diameter of the drum seal can also be enlarged. This results in an improved utilization of the space inside the drum.<br>
Below, the invention will be described in greater detail using exemplary embodiments, with reference to the set of drawings of exemplary embodiments [sic]. These show:<br>
Fig. 1	a sectional view of the area of connection between the upper drum section and<br>
the lower drum section of a first separator drum according to the invention; and<br>
Fig. 2	a sectional view of the area of connection between the upper drum section and<br>
the lower drum section of a second separator drum according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the area of connection between the upper drum section 1 and the lower drum section 2 of a separator drum 3 according to the invention, with a vertical rotational axis (not shown here).<br>
The upper drum section 1 and the lower drum section 2 are preferably both conical in shape, with each transitioning, in the area in which its diameter is largest, into a segment 4, 5 that is cylindrical on its outer periphery (upper drum section) or on its outer periphery and its inner periphery.<br><br>
Especially the lower drum section 2 has a cylindrical segment 5 that is somewhat longer axially. in which a piston valve 6 with a circumferential seal 7 is guided so as to be displaceable axially. The piston valve 6 serves to open and seal solid material discharge openings 8 in the lower drum section 2.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the solid material discharge openings 8 in the opened state.<br>
When the solid material discharge openings 8 are in the closed state (not shown here), the piston valve 6 is positioned with its upper annular surface 9 against a lower collar 10 of the upper drum section or on a ring seal 11 in said collar 10.<br>
The segment 4 of the upper drum section 1 that is cylindrical on the exterior and conical on the interior is dimensioned such that it engages axially in the cyJindrical segment 5 of the lower drum section 2.<br>
On the outer periphery of the cylindrical segment 4 of the upper drum section 1 and on the inner periphery of the cylindrical segment 5 of the lower drum section 2 a respective exterior threading or interior threading 12, 13 is formed, so that the upper drum section 1 is screwed into the lower drum section 2.<br>
On the upper rim of the cylindrical segment 5 of the lower drum section 2, a ring collar 14 that projects radially outward as part of the upper drum section 1 rests against the outermost periphery of the lower drum section 2, above the area of the screw connection. This ring collar 14 has, in its outermost area, at least one projection 15 that extends axially downward and encompasses a ring collar 16 on the lower drum section 2 that projects axially upward above the area of the screw connection. The projection 15 can be configured as a continuous ring collar, or can comprise multiple sections or areas that are arranged distributed around the circumference of the upper drum section 1 (not shown here).<br>
As shown in Fig. 2. the penetration depth is limited in an axial direction by the positioning of the two sections in the cone 17a, 17b.<br>
In this manner, a direct screw connection that requires no locking ring is achieved between the lower drum section 2 and the upper drum section I, while problems are effectively prevented.<br><br>
also in a simple manner, from occurring in the area of the screw connection as a result of the expansion of the lower drum section 2 from rotation during operation.<br>
In the construction shown in both Fig. 1 and 2 it is essential that the projection 15 - regardless of whether it is ring-shaped or in sections distributed around the circumference - engage behind the lower drum section 2, preferably its upper ring collar 16, on the outside in the manner of a clamping element.<br>
According to Fig. 1, the projection 15 and the ring collar 16 are conical in structure on their surfaces 17a, b that face one another, which serves to limit the penetration depth, whereas in Fig. 2 in this area, cylindrical surfaces 18, 19 are formed, which extend axially.<br>
Both variants have advantages, with the conical surfaces 17a, b creating a particularly well-sealed rear engagement, since these conical surfaces run up onto one another with expansion.<br>
Ordinarily, the lower drum section 2 and the upper drum section 1 are screwed together on the locking ring. Because said ring is eliminated here, and because there is a large enough surface on the upper drum section for attachment of a corresponding screwing tool (not shown here), it is practical, according to a further improvement, to provide the upper drum section 3 directly with means for attaching a tool of this type. As a means of this type, Fig. 2 discloses a bore hole 20 in the upper drum section 1. In this bore hole 20, and optionally in one or more additional bore holes, corresponding bolts can be used to fasten the tool (for example a type of handle; not shown here) for screwing the two drum sections to one another. During operation, the bore hole can be sealed, for example with a threaded bolt, which is then removed to allow placement and fastening<br>
