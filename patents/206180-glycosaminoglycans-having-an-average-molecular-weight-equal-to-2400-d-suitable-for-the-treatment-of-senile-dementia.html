				<td>GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS   HAVING   AN   AVERAGE   MOLECULAR   WEIGHT EQUAL TO 2400 D SUITABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SENILE DEMENTIA FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present invention  refers to  glycosaminoglycans  having   a  low  molecular weight,   suitable   to   the   treatment   of  senile   dementia   and   of  the   cerebral neurological lesions from ictus and from traumas. PRIOR ART<br>
Senile dementia, particularly in the form of Alzheimer, is principally characterized by cerebral deposits of amyloid substance in plaques, either in the cerebral vessels (vascular amyloid) or in the cerebral substance (cerebral amyloid), both defined as p amyloid or Ap. The other typical characteristic of senile dementia on the physiopathologic level is the presence in the neurons of fibriliary tangles called NFT (neurofibrillary tangles).<br>
It is known that the proteoglycans (PGs), and in particular the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) are involved either in the polymerization of the Ap or in the aggregation of the NFTs as well as also in other pathologic events related to the Alzheimer's disease and generally to senile dementia (Snow AD; Sekiguchi R; Nicholin D et al. "An Important Role of Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan (Perlakan) in a Model System for the Deposition and Persistence of Fibrillar Beta Amyloid in Rat Brain". Neuron 1994; 12: 219-234) and (Perry G; Sieslak SL; Richey P, Kawai M et al. "Association of Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan with Neurofibrillary Tangles of Alzheimer's Disease". J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3679-3683).<br>
Moreover the original paper by Snow (Willmer JP; Snow AD; Kisilevski R. "The Demonstration of Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans in Association with the Amyloidogenic Lesions in Alzheimer's Disease". J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 1986; 45: 340-346) discloses the presence of Pgs and of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the cerebral amyloid plaques of patients suffering from senile dementia. Several studies showed (Kalaria RN; Kroon SN; Grahovak I; Perry G. "Acetylcholinesterase and its Association with Heparan Suifate Proteoglycans in Cortical Amyloid Deposits of Alzheimer's Disease". Neuroscience 1992; 51:177-184) that the association between PGs and amyloid may be caused either by a<br>
CONFIRMATION COPY<br><br>
2<br>
direct linkage with the precursor of the p amyloid (ApPP) or by a linkage with Ap1-<br>
41 or with A 1-43 which include the neurotoxic sequences of the Ap.<br>
The Pgs proved to increase also the polymerization of the Tau-2 protein (Perry G;<br>
Sieslak   SL;   Richey   P,   Kawai   M   et   al.   "Association   of   Heparan   Suifate<br>
Proteoglycan with Neurofibrillary Tangles of Alzheimer's Disease". J. Neurosci.<br>
1991; 11: 3679-3683) which is the cause of the formation of the neurofibrillary<br>
tangles (NFT).<br>
Moreover in a study carried out by Lorens et al. (Lorens SA; Gushawan BS; Van<br>
De Kar L; Waiegnga JM; Fareed J. "Behavioural, Endocrine, and Neurochemical<br>
Effects of Sulfomucopolysaccharide Treatment in the Aged Fischer 344 Male Rat".<br>
Semin Thromb.  Haemost.  17 Suppl.   1993; 2:164-173) aged rats showed an<br>
improvement   of the   behavioural   deficit   following   the   oral   administration   of<br>
glycosaminoglycans having a high molecular weight (GAP or glycosaminoglycans<br>
polysuifated or Ateroid®).<br>
Conti et al. (Conti L; Placidi GF; Cassano GB; "Ateroid® in the Treatment of<br>
Dementia: Results of a Clinical Trial (Eds. Ban E; Lehmann HE) Diagnosis and<br>
Treatment of Old Age Dementias" Mod. Probl. Pharmacopsychiatry. Basel, Larger<br>
1989 vol. 2, pp 76-84) showed that following the treatment with Ateroid® the<br>
patients    suffering   from    senile    dementia    show   an    improvement   of   the<br>
psychopathologic  parameters  performance and   of the  social  behaviour in  a<br>
significantly higher way than the patients treated with placebo.<br>
Parnetti et al. (Parnetti;  Ban TA; Senin U. "Glycosaminoglycan Polysulfate in<br>
Primary Degenerative Dementia". Neuropsychobiology 1995; 31: 76-80) showed<br>
that Ateroid® may significantly improve some biochemical parameters altered in<br>
senile dementia, such as for example the monoamine oxidase B of the blood<br>
plaques and the dopamine and serotonin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.<br>
These observations suggest that Ateroid® may be helpful in the treatment of<br>
senile dementia and already in 1988 U. Cornelli and T. Bann obtained the patent<br>
for the use of this product in the treatment of senile dementia (EP 293974).<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Now we have surprisingly found in an in vivo experimentation  that the fraction of<br><br>
3<br>
glycosaminoglycans obtained from heparin depolymerization, having an average<br>
molecular weight equal to 2,400 D shows an exceptional effectiveness in inhibiting<br>
the formation of the   amyloid and in favouring the neuronal growth.<br>
The fractions having a lower (840 D) average molecular weight or high (4800 D)<br>
molecular weight show a definitely lower or negligible effectiveness.<br>
Therefore the fraction of glycosaminogiycans having an average molecular weight<br>
equal to 2,400 D may be used for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions<br>
suitable for the treatment of senile dementia, in particular for the treatment of<br>
Alzheimer's disease or SDAT (Senile Dementia Alzheimer's Type), and in the<br>
treatment of the cerebral neurologicaS lesions from ictus and from traumas.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 represents the HPLC test of the giycosaminogiycan having an average<br>
molecular weight of 2,400 (± 200) as obtained by the described example.<br>
Figure 2 represents the NMR test of the giycosaminogiycan having an average<br>
molecular weight of 2,400 (± 200) as obtained by the described example.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to the use of a fraction of glycosaminoglycans having<br>
an   average   molecular   weight   equal   to   2400   D   for   the   preparation   of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the treatment of senile dementia, in<br>
particular for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or SDAT (Senile Dementia<br>
Alzheimer's Type) and of the cerebral neuroiogical lesions from ictus and from<br>
traumas.<br>
Said fraction of glycosaminoglycans is obtained by depolymerization of heparin<br>
preferably acting according to a method including the following steps:<br>
a)	an aqueous solution of heparin is treated with gamma radiation from Co 60<br>
according to the U.S.P. 4,987,222 Patent;<br>
b)	the solution obtained from the step a) is fractioned by gel permeation on<br>
Sephadex G/50 Medium resin;<br><br>
c)	the mixture of the fractions having molecular weight from 1,000 to 3,000 D is<br>
)     ultrafiltered at 600 D cut-off, washed and freeze-dried;<br>
d)	the freeze-dried product is dissolved and fractioned by gel permeation on<br><br>
4<br>
Sephadex G/25 Medium resin;<br>
e) the fractions having  a  molecular weight  ranging from   1,920 to 2,560  D,<br>
corresponding to an average molecular weight equal to 2,400 D, are gathered and<br>
mixed.<br>
For the preparation of the fraction of glycosaminoglycans having an average<br>
molecular weight equal to 2,400 D, with the preferred method of the present<br>
invention, a 10% heparin aqueous, solution is first treated with gamma radiation<br>
from Co 60 with an intensity ranging from 120 KGy to 150 KGy, at   subsequent<br>
dosages of 25 KGy with respect to the heparin molecular weight.<br>
The irradiated solution is ultrafiltered at 300 D cut-off, purified, sterilety filtered and<br>
freeze-dried obtaining the "mother depolymerized" heparin.<br>
This "mother depolymerized" heparin is dissolved in a 0.3 M solution of NaCI and<br>
then submitted to fractioning by gel permeation on Sephadex G/50 Medium resin.<br>
The fractions having molecular weight 
raw material of the present invention.<br>
The first treatment of this mixture consists in the ultrafiltration at 600 D cut-off for<br>
the  removal of the molecular fragments  resulting from the depolymerization<br>
process.<br>
The ultrafiltered mixture is washed with 0.3 M NaCI to the disappearance of the<br>
reaction to carbazole in the permeate.<br>
The final mixture, taken to a concentration about equal to 8% in distilled water, is<br>
sterilely filtered on 0.2  . membranes and freeze-dried.<br>
The freeze-dried product is dissolved in a 0.3 M NaCI solution at a concentration<br>
ranging from 10% to 15% (w/v).<br>
In order to obtain the fraction having average molecular weight equal to 2,400 D a<br>
second  treatment of gel   permeation   is  applied  maintaining  about the  same<br>
parameters of the first gel permeation, using however the specific characteristics<br>
of the Sephadex G/25 Medium.<br>
The  used  pilot column  may be  of the  BP  252/15  kind  with the following<br>
characteristics:<br>
o Height	:         105 cm<br><br>
5<br>
o	Resin volume	:	5,200 ml<br>
. Flux	:       1,000 ml/h<br>
The adopted parameters are represented by:<br>
. Ve	        = 17,000 ml<br>
. Ve/Vo	         = 1/R = 1.26<br>
o	R	        = 0.79<br>
. K	        - 0.09 = (Ve - Vo): (Vt - Vo)<br>
wherein:<br>
o	Ve = elution volume<br>
o	Vt = total volume of the resin<br>
o	Vo = dead volume (initial solution in output)<br>
o	R = resolution (peak amplitude)<br>
From the second gel permeation from 10 to 12 fractions are obtained comprising a<br>
series of molecular weights ranging from 3,000 D to about 1,500 D. For the<br>
preparation  of the  fraction   of glycosaminoglycans   according  to  the   present<br>
invention only the fractions having molecular weights ranging from 1,920 D to<br>
2,560 D are gathered and mixed.<br>
The resulting solution is ultrafiltered by cut-off 300 to the removal of the sodium<br>
chloride.<br>
The solution is submitted to concentration to about 10%, filtered at 0.2   and<br>
freeze-dried.<br>
This fraction forms about 80% of the total of the fractions having molecular weight<br>
According to the method of the present invention the desired fraction of glycosaminoglycans is obtained with noteworthy reproducibility index either as far as the process yield is concerned or as far as the constancy of the molecular<br>
composition is concerned.<br>
Below    the characterization of the fraction of the glycosaminoglycans of the<br>
present invention is reported. )      CHEMICO-PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS<br>
Appearance	   : light yellow colour Powder<br><br><br>
The average molecular weight has been determined by HPLC using columns for exclusion chromatography,  in  comparison with  LMW Heparins for Calibration Reference Substance Batch no. 1a (PH.EUR.) at molecular weight = 3,700. SULPHATION PERCENT RATIOS Three samples have been examined with the results of Table 1.<br><br>
The percent values are computed on the sum of two specific areas taken into<br>
consideration from the NMR analysis.<br>
Desulfated uronic acids: area of the signals 102.2 and 106 ppm with respect to the<br>
total uronic acids at 100.5 and 106 ppm;<br>
Glucosamine.NSO3-6-sulfated: area of the signals at 62.5 ppm with respect to the<br>
area of the Glucosamine-6-sulfated at 68 ppm;<br>
Glucosamine.N acetilated: area of the signals at 55.5 ppm with respect to the area<br>
of the signals from 61 to 54 ppm;<br>
Glucosamine.N,3 sulfated: area of the signal at 59 ppm with respect to the area of<br>
the siqnals from 61 to 54 ppm.<br><br>
7<br>
The values of the sulfation in C.8 of the glucosamine turn out to be lower than the<br>
ones of the fractions having 4,500 D (84 average) molecuiar weight.<br>
This is due to the fact that, with the lowering of the molecular weight, the<br>
secondary alcoholic groups present in the reduced terminal units whose signals<br>
fall into the zone of the C6 of the Glucosamines 6 desulfated increase.<br>
STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS<br>
The    Fig.    1    reports    the    plot    obtained    by    HPLC    of   the    fraction    of<br>
glycosarninoglycans with the distribution of the molecular weights ranging for 95%<br>
from 2,560 D to 1,920 D, corresponding to about 4-5 constitutive Disaccharides.<br>
The Fig. 2 reports the NMR plot of the same fraction wherein one notices the<br>
absence of signals from 84 to 85 ppm characteristic of the linkage site which is<br>
removed  by depolymerization with gamma radiation. The  detachment of the<br>
galactosidic   chain   and   its   nitrogenous   components   represents   a   specific<br>
characteristic   of  this   saccharidic   fraction   allowing   to   operate   without   the<br>
interferences, usually of pathological character, deriving from the presence of<br>
peptidic structures having different aminoacidic composition.<br>
The NMR analysis reveals moreover that in the terminal zones there are only<br>
intact rings or eventually consisting of aliphatic "remnants".<br>
The rings of the reducing end are never desusfated.<br>
Glucuronic structures desulfated at the reducing ends are not pointed out because<br>
they are destroyed by the gamma radiation.<br>
In the rings of the not reducing ends the terminal C4s are difficult to distinguish<br>
from the not terminal C4s because they all fall into the same zone; the onfy ones<br>
which are identified in an univocal way are those ones of the NS, 3S glucosamine<br>
exactly adjacent to the glucuronic acid of the active pentamer.<br>
The structural cores correspond to the initial heparin with practically unaltered<br>
sulfation indexes.<br>
The anomeric signals deriving from the GloNSO36SO3 and ldoA2SO3 reducing<br>
groups qualify the fraction of glycosarninoglycans according to the invention as a<br>
substance with terminal units similar to those of the fragments from natural<br>
heparin.<br><br>
8<br>
Particularly suitable for the use according to the present invention is the fraction of<br>
glycosaminoglycans having average  molecular weight equal to 2,400  D with<br>
polydispersion index lower than 1.20, with total absence of peptidic components<br>
and free from desulfated units at the reducing end, obtained without resulfation<br>
treatment and in the absence of catalyzers.<br>
BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS<br>
Ph.E. heparinic activity = absent<br>
USP heparinic activity = absent<br>
Anti Xa activity	= 
Anti lla activity	= 
From the above reported characterization it turns out that the fraction of glycosaminoglycans according to the present invention proves the absence of an heparinic activity towards the parameters of the coagulation notwithstanding the maintainment of the structural characteristics of the heparinic molecule, obviously with much lower molecular weight of the heparin. EXAMPLE<br>
100 g of sodium Heparin from pig intestinal mucosa, having a molecular weight of 14,000 D and an activity of 190 U/mg, are dissolved in 1 1 of distilled and de-aerated water. The solution is poured into pyrex containers which are closed with a glass plug after bubbling of Argon.<br>
The solution is submitted to an overall treatment of 130 kGy at subsequent dosages of about 25 kGy of. gamma radiation from Co 60, obtaining the depoiymerization of the Heparin.<br>
The irradiated solution is ultrafiitered at 300 D cut-off, purified with subsequent passages in 3% NaCI and freeze-dried, after concentration at about 10%. This "mother depolymerized" Heparin is dissolved at 10% in 0.3 M solution of NaCI  and fractioned  by Gel  Permeation column  containing  Sephadex G  50 Medium.<br>
After separating the components having molecular weight &gt; 8,000 D and the aliquots referable to the Heparin of about 4,500 D, the fractions at a molecular weight 
 <br>
9<br>
These fractions are purified by 600 D cut-off ultrafiltration for the removal of the<br>
molecular fragments following the depolymerization process.<br>
After a series of three washings in 0.3 M NaCI to obtain the disappearance of the<br>
reaction to the carbazole in permeate, the mixture is concentrated to about 8%<br>
and the solution passed by 0.2 micrometers filtration is freeze-dried.<br>
The freeze-dried product is dissolved in a solution of 0.3 M NaCI in an amount<br>
such as to obtain a final concentration of 10% (x/v). This solution is fractioned by<br>
Gel Permeation on column containing Sephadex G/25 medium.<br>
The fractions having molecular weight ranging from 1,920 D to 2,560 D are<br>
gathered.<br>
The obtained solution is purified by 300 D cutoff ultrafiltration to the elimination of<br>
the sodium chloride.<br>
The solution is concentrated at about 10% and freeze-dried.<br>
Yield: about 9 g of light yellow colour powder.<br>
Analysis: average molecular weight = 2,400 (± 200); organic sulphur = 9.9%.<br>
Sulfates/carboxyls ratio = 2.5; anti Xa activity = 45 U anti Xa/mg.<br>

For comparison  aim,  with  the  same  method  also the  following  fractions  of<br>
glycosaminoglycans are prepared:<br>
?	Fraction having average molecular weight of 640 D (from 320 to 1,600 D);<br>
?	Fraction having average molecular weight of 4,800 D (from 3,350 to 6,060 D).<br>
Thanks to the pharmaceutical characteristics resulting from the experimentation<br>
reported below, the glycosaminoglycans having average molecular weight equal<br>
to 2,400 D may be used for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions<br>
suitable for the treatment of senile dementia, and in particular of the Alzheimer's<br>
disease or SDAT (Senile  Dementia Alzheimer's Type),  and  of the cerebral<br>
neurological lesions from ictus and from traumas and of the forms of nervous<br>
degeneration.<br>
Said   compositions   comprise   a   pharmaceutically   effective   amount   of   said glycosaminoglycans  in   mixture  with   pharmaceutically   acceptable  diluents  or<br><br>
10<br>
excipients, and they may be prepared in form suitable to the subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous and oral administration.<br>
Said compositions contain an amount of said glycosaminogiycans ranging from 50<br>
to 200 mg per unitary dose.<br>
The present invention also includes a therapeutic method for the treatment of<br>
patients suffering from senile dementia, and in particular from Alzheimer's disease<br>
or SDAT and from cerebral neurological lesions from ictus and from traumas,<br>
consisting in the administration of an amount of glycosaminogiycans having an<br>
average molecular weight of 2,400 D ranging from 10 to 400 mg per day. In<br>
particular, for the subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration is<br>
expected an amount from 10 to 200 mg per day and for the oral administration an<br>
amount from 25 to 400 mg per day is expected.<br>

The model used for the experimentation is based on the effects of an injection of<br>
A  25-35 in the centro-cerebral region of the amygdala.<br>
The aminoacidic sequence of Ap 25-35 is the sequence considered neurotoxic<br>
(Yankner BA; Duffy LK; Kirscner DA; "Neurotrophic and Neurotoxic Effects of<br>
Amyioid-p Protein. Reversal by Tachykinin Neuropeptides". Science 1990: 250-<br>
282) as it produces the lesions tipical of A  1-41 or Ap 1-43.<br>
For the experiments young (3-4 months) male rats have been used, of Fischer<br>
344 strain, which received an intracerebral injection in the right amygdala with 5<br>
nmol/3.0  l of A  25-35 or the respective vehicle (VEH 1).<br><br>
12<br>
The TGSS or the respective VEH2 vehicle were administered 2 times per day by<br>
subcutaneous way from two days before the intracerebral injection of A  and for<br>
32 days after said injection, with the doses specified below.<br>
For the histologicai analysis the animals were anaesthetized with pentobarbital<br>
sodium   and   perfused   by     arterial   (transaortic)  way  with   a   solution   of 4%<br>
formaldehyde.<br>
5 coronal sections (40  n) were carried out spaced with 0.2 mm intervals.<br>
The sections were contacted with antibodies for the Tau-2 protein and for the glial<br>
fibrillary acid protein (GFAP).<br>
The    Fischer   344   rats   were   obtained   from   Harlan    Sprague-Dawley   Inc.<br>
(Indianapolis In).<br>
At the arrival time they weighed 250-300 g and they were from 3 to 4 months old.<br>
The animals were kept in individual cages with a light-darkness cycle equal to 12<br>
hours (light at 7.00 am) in conditions of housing approved according to the<br>
AAALAC (American Association Animal Laboratory and Care).<br>
They had access to food and water ad libitum and they have been kept in these<br>
environmental conditions for 2-3 weeks before the experiment.<br>
The   intracerebral   injection   of A    25-35  was   done   under   anaesthesia   with<br>
pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p.; Butter, Columbus, OH).<br>
On the anaesthetization of the animals, atropine sulfate (0.4 mg/kg; Sigma, St.<br>
Louis, MO) and ampicillin sodium salt (50 mg/kg; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were also<br>
administered  by  intramuscular way.  The  intracerebral   injection   into the  right<br>
amygdala was carried out by the use of a stereotaxic (Kopf) instrument set such a<br>
way that the depth was not greater than 3.3 mm under the interaural line.<br>
The coordinates for the injection have been determined on the basis of the<br>
Paxinos and Watson atlas measured from the cranial bregma with coordinates<br>
AP-3.0, ML-4.6 and DV-8.8.<br>
The anteroposterior (AP) coordinates have been positioned where the structure of<br>
the amygdala is wider.<br>
The medium lateral (ML) coordinates have been centred in relation to the medial<br>
and   basolateral   core   of   the   amygdala   and   finally   the   dorsoventral   (DV)<br><br>
13<br>
coordinates have been centred at the dorsoventra! limina of the amygdala.<br>
The injected volume of 3  1 has been infused in 6 minutes, using a pump for<br>
microsyringes of CMA/100 kind (Carnegie Medici AD, Soln, Sweden). The cannula<br>
remained in situ for 2 minutes after the injection and then it has been carefully<br>
removed.<br>
After the operation the animals stood on a heated plate til! the moment when they<br>
reacquired the righting reflex.<br>
After 35 days of treatment the animals were anaesthetized with pentobarbital<br>
sodium (100 mg/kg  IP.) and  perfused by transaortic way with 250 ml of a<br>
sodium/potassium phosphate 0.1 M buffer at pH 7.4 (PB).<br>
Subsequently formaldehyde at 4% was perfused in 500 ml of PB, at the velocity of<br>
500 ml/hour at room temperature.<br>
Immediately after the   beginning  of the  perfusion   1   U/g   of  heparin  (Upjohn<br>
Kalamzoo. Ml) were injected by transaortic way.<br>
After the perfusion the brain was isolated and fixed with a solution at 20% of<br>
sucrose for in and then it was sectioned in 6 mm blocks around the injection site<br>
and kept at a temperature of 4 °C in a 20% sucrose and 0.1% sodium azide<br>
solution and at 0.01% of bacitracin in PB for 24 hours.<br>
The tissue blocks were on end transferred into a solution at 20% of glycerol and at<br>
2% of dimethyl sulfoxide in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer and therein kept, at a<br>
temperature of 4 °C, till the moment of the section.<br>
The coronal sections of 40  ,m were cut in series of 5 at a distance of 0.2 mm one<br>
from another and historically analyzed for the analysis of the Tau-2 and GFAP<br>
proteins.<br>
HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS<br>
Cresyl violet<br>
The sections were cleaned with xylene and hydrated with alcohol and H2O. The<br>
coloration was carried out putting the section in contact with a solution containing<br>
200 ml of 0.2 M acetic acid, 133 ml of 0.2 M sodium acetate and 67 ml of cresyl<br>
violet acetate at 0.1%. Then the sections were dehydrated with subsequent<br>
passages in ethanol and cleaned with xylene. The thus colored section was<br><br>
14<br>
covered with suitable slide for the microscope reading. Congo Red<br>
The sections were cleaned and hydrated with a series of treatments with ethanol<br>
and water.<br>
The coloration was carried out putting into contact the section with a solution<br>
containing 1% of Congo Red and 50% of ethanol for a period of 1 h.<br>
Then the sections were dipped into a solution saturated with lithium carbonate and<br>
washed under running water for 15 minutes. The counter-coloration was carried<br>
out in Harris hematoxylin for 2 minutes and later on water and a 1% alcoholic acid<br>
solution were added. The sections were washed in water, dipped into an aqueous<br>
solution of ammonium sulfate and again washed with running water. The sections<br>
were finally dehydrated in ethanol and cleaned with xylene. The so coloured<br>
sections were covered with a suitable slide for the reading at the microscope.<br>
Tau-2 Protein<br>
     The 40  m sections were cleaned from the cryoprotector and kept overnight in PBS buffer solution at 4 °C.<br>
In the morning the sections were put into contact for 30 minutes with a 0.3% solution of H2O2 in tris buffer solution at pH 7.6 (PBS) and later on washed 3 times for 10 minutes with a solution at 0.3% of triton X-100 in PBS. The sections were<br>
)     then incubated for 24 hours with Tau-2 (Sigma) antibody 1:500 diluted at room temperature.<br>
The diluent for antibody contained 2% of triton X-100, 0.1% of sodium azide, 0.01% of bacitracin, 2% of seric albumin and 10% of normal horse serum in PBS. On end the tissue was washed 3 times, for 10 minutes, with a solution containing 0.3% of triton X-100 in PBS and subsequently incubated for 1 h with an antibody for imrnunoglobuiin (Vectastain ABC Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories Burlingame CA) diluted 1:200 in a solution at 0.3% of triton X-100 in PBS. After 2 washings with a solution at 0.3% of triton X-100 in PBST for a 15 minutes total, the tissue was incubated for 1 h with horseradish avidin peroxidase (Vector) diluted 1:2,000 with a solution at 0.3% of triton X-100 in PBS. The sections were then washed in PBS for 1 hour and then again for 15 minutes<br><br>
15<br>
with a sodium acetate buffer (0.2 M at pH 6.0). The sections were then reacted<br>
with 3-3 diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochioride (DAB) and with nickel ammonium<br>
sulphate (35 mg of DAB, 2.5 g of ammonium nickel sulphate for 100 ml of sodium<br>
acetate buffer with 0.3% of H2O2).<br>
The sections were then put in sodium acetate buffer and subsequently in PBS at 4<br>
°C and therein maintained overnight.<br>
After this operation the sections were dried and covered with a slide for the<br>
reading at the microscope.<br>
GFAP Protein<br>
The coloration has been done by the method used for the Tau-2 with the<br>
exception that the antibody was diluted in sheep serum rather than in horse<br>
serum.<br>
The GFAP (DAKO, Denmark) primary antibody was used in 1:500 dilution.<br>
The sections coloured with cresyl violet were analyzed measuring the sizes of the<br>
Ap deposits.<br>
The area of the Ap deposits was measured at 0.2 mm intervals. The Ap deposits<br>
were also analyzed for the apple green refractivity, using the polarized light of the<br>
slides coloured with Congo red.<br>
In the context of these histochemicai showings the cells reactive to Tau-2 were<br>
counted in all the coronal sections while the reactive astrocytosis was estimated,<br>
with a score from 0 to 2.<br>
The animals were considered positive if they exhibited positive colorations from 1<br>
to 2.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND RESULTS<br>
For each experiment four different groups of rats have been used:<br>
1.	VEH1 + VEH2 GROUP: rats injected with the VEH1  (TFA) vehicle in the<br>
amygdala   and   injected   with   the  VEH2   (physiological   solution)  vehicle   by<br>
subcutaneous way;<br>
2.	Ap + VEH2 GROUP: rats injected with Ap 25-35 in the amygdala and with the<br>
VEH2 (physiological solution) vehicle by subcutaneous way;<br>
3.	A  +TGSS GROUP: rats injected with Ap 25-35 in the amygdala and TGSS by<br><br>
16 subcutaneous way;<br>
4. VEH1  + TGSS GROUP: rats injected with the VEH1   (TFA) vehicle in the<br>
amygdala and with a TGSS by subcutaneous way.<br>
Each block of experiments was designed for at least 6 animals per group.<br>
Following this treatment scheme three types of TGSS have been used with three<br>
different average molecular weights as follows:<br>
C3-2.400 Dalton, at 2.5 mg/kg s.c. dose<br>
C8-640 Dalton, at 2.5 mg/kg s.c. dose<br>
C7-4.800 Dalton, at 2.5 mg/kg s.c. dose.<br>
Each   TGSS   has   been   studied  with  two  different  experiments  to   have   the<br>
confirmation of the results.<br>
For each type of treatment the following number of animals has been analyzed:<br><br>
The animals treated with VEH1 intra amygdala (controls without amyloid) and with one whatever of the TGSS  (C3 or C8 or C7) have always  showed  results practically identical to the controls of the group 1, treated with the only VEH1 + VEH2 vehicles, a) Reactivity to the Tau-2 protein (number of reactive cells): average values ±<br>
standard deviation.<br><br><br>
17<br><br>
From this series of experiments turns out that C3 and C7 are both active in reducing the reactivity to the Tau-2 protein while C8 which has the lowest molecular weight, corresponding to the disaccharide, shows no activity. The controls not treated with Ap behave in an identical way when they are injected by subcutaneous way either with physiological solution (group 1) or with a TGSS (group 4).<br>
The strong decrease of the reactivity to the Tau-2 protein through the effect of the C3 compound has been confirmed also by tests wherein the C3 has been administered to the rats by oral way.<br>
The experimental model and the screaning methodology have been identical to those   ones   above   described,   with   the   difference   that  the   C3   has   been administered by oral way at a dose of 20 mg/kg rather than subcutaneous way. The C3 administration has been carried out one time a day starting from three days before the injection of the Ap 25-35 to fourteen days after such injection. The rats were sacrified after fourteen days from the injection of the Ap 25-35. The obtained results are reported in the following Table from which one observes that C3 strongly reduces the reactivity to the Tau-2 protein in the rats treated with A  25-35.<br><br><br>
18<br>
b) Reactivity of the astrocytes (% of animals which represented reactivity +1 or +2): average values.<br><br>
As far as the astrocytes reactivity is concerned the only product which shows a<br>
significant activity is C3 (group 3a). The products C8 and C7 (groups 3b and 3c)<br>
have no activity.<br>
From the examination of these results surprisingly emerges that the C3 TGSS,<br>
having an average molecular weight equal to 2,400 D, has a much higher activity<br>
than the TGSS which respectively have   higher and lower molecular weight. In<br>
particular the average molecular weight equal to 2,400 Dalton is optimal for the<br>
reduction of the reactivity pointed out with the Tau-2 protein and for that one<br>
pointed out with the reaction of the astrocytes.<br>
In another experimentation on rats the capacity of the C3 product to overcome the<br>
hematoencephalic barrier following the administration by intravenous way has<br>
been studied.<br>
For that purpose the product marked with tritium (3H) has been used.<br>
The labeling corresponded to 700,000 DPM/mg of 3H-C3.<br>
After a 2.5 mg/kg administration by intravenous way, the rats have been sacrified,<br>
under anaesthesia by pentobarbital sodium, at the fixed time of 45 minutes.<br>
The labeling levels in blood, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and finally in the brain<br>
(after a slow infusion to remove the blood from the vessels) have been analyzed.<br>
The CSF has been taken with a glass capillary from the fourth ventricle (in an<br><br>
19<br>
amount always greater than 200  l, after complete bleeding of the animai).<br>
The DPM have been estimated through scintillation diluting 20  \ of homogenate<br>
(brain) in 5 ml of physiological solution.<br>
The results, reported in the following table, show that 3H-C3 is able to pass the<br>
hematoencephalic barrier in a significant amount.<br><br>
In the control animals  the DPM/ml values were always lower than 41 in all the<br>
analyzed tissues.<br>
Following on these results a control of the presence of the anti Xa activity in<br>
serum, in CSF and in the brain has been carried out.<br>
It is known that the Xa factor (coagulation X factor) is inhibited only by the sulphur<br>
oligosaccharidic fractions containing more than four saccharides.<br>
In a series of rats treated as in the previous point, it has been observed that, after<br>
45 minutes since the treatment with C3 at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg by intravenous<br>
way, the anti Xa activity is present in a significant way in plasma, in CSF and in<br>
the cerebral tissue.<br>
This is   a further confirmation that the product passing the hematoencephalic<br>
barrier consists of C3 and not of inactive degradation products such as the<br>
disaccharides or the tetrasaceharides.<br>
In the rats submitted to injection of Ap 25-35 either treated with C3 or without<br>
active treatments the neuronal growth has been analyzed too.<br>
For the purpose the Rapid Goigi coloration method has been used which, owing to<br>
its complexity, has been applied only to a limited number of animals.<br>
As already previously specified the C3 has been administered at a dose of 2.5<br>
mg/kg by subcutaneous way, twice a day starting from two days before the<br>
intracerebral injection of Aj3 25-35 and for 32 consecutive days.<br>
The cerebral neurones of the V layer of the cingulate gyrus of the brain have been<br><br>
20<br>
analyzed.<br>
The test implied the measurement of the dendrites length and the ratio between<br>
the number of end branches and the number of the primitive branches (T/B ratio).<br>
The higher the T/B ratio the greater is the complexity and the number of<br>
connections of the neuron.<br>
The results are reported in the following Table.<br><br>
* p
** p
The Table shows that the A  creates a damage to the neuronal growth and that<br>
the C3 remedies the created damage. Moreover one notices that C3 has a<br>
neurotrophic kind activity useful in case of nervous degeneration or traumas<br>
implying a neurona! damage.<br><br>
