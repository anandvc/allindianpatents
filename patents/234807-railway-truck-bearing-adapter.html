RAILWAY TRUCK BEARING ADAPTER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a railway freight car truck and, more particularly, to an improved bearing adapter for use in the pedestal jaw opening of the sideframe of a railway freight car truck.<br>
In a railway freight car truck, two axles are held in a pair of laterally spaced sideframes, with a bolster extending laterally between and supported on each sideframe. The wheels are press fit on the axles, with the ends of the axles also fitted with a roller bearing assembly. The roller bearing assembly itself is fit into a bearing adapter that is fit into a pedestal jaw opening at the longitudinal end of each sideframe. The ends of the bolsters are themselves supported on spring groups, which are supported on the lower portion of the center openings of the sideframes.<br>
US Patent Number 5,562,045 discloses an adapter and pad assembly useful in the fitting of the bearing assembly into the pedestal jaw opening of each sideframe. The bearing adapter, which is itself fit on top of the bearing assembly, is comprised of a unitary cast steel piece. This piece includes shoulders that are laterally spaced to form a receiving opening at each longitudinal edge of the bearing adapter. An elastomeric adapter pad is fitted on top of the bearing adapter. The adapter pad itself is disclosed to be comprised of an injection molded polymer or a castable polyurethane. The adapter pad itself includes depending legs which extend from opposite longitudinal edges of the adapter pad. The depending legs are spaced laterally at each longitudinal edge of the adapter pad such that the depending legs are received in openings between the laterally spaced shoulders of the bearing adapter.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved bearing adapter and pad assembly for use in a railway truck sideframe pedestal opening.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A railway freight car truck of the so-called three piece standard design, is comprised of two laterally spaced, unitary cast steel sideframes and a laterally extending bolster, also of a unitary cast steel structure. The ends of the bolster are received and supported on spring groups that themselves are supported on the bottom section of a bolster opening in each sideframe.<br>
The wheel axle assemblies themselves are received in openings, commonly referred to as pedestal jaw openings, at longitudinal ends of each sideframe. The wheel axle assemblies themselves extend laterally between the sideframes, and hence, also laterally between the two spaced railway tracks. For improved performance of the railway freight car truck, it is desirable to receive the bearings press fit on each axle end into a bearing adapter assembly.<br>
In one embodiment, the improved bearing adapter assembly is comprised of a cast steel, unitary bearing adapter. This bearing adapter includes lateral edges themselves having arcuate cutouts to be placed over the bearing assembly. The bearing adapter further comprises depending shoulders that extend from each longitudinal edge of the bearing adapter. The shoulders at each longitudinal edge of the bearing adapter themselves are laterally spaced to form an opening there between. Further, the bearing adapter embodiment may include depressions that extend laterally and are spaced longitudinally across the top section of the bearing adapter. It should be understood that the top section of such bearing adapter is generally rectangular in structure, such that the depressions are near each longitudinal edge of the bearing adapter. These depressions can be of a general v-shape, formed by acute angle cuts into the top section of the bearing adapter, or they could be of an arcuate nature as well.<br>
In one embodiment, the improved adapter pad is comprised of an improved elastomer or polymer, usually polyurethane.    Such improved adapter pad is usually formed in a casting<br><br>
operation, although recent improvements have allowed the improved adapter pad to also be formed in an injection molding operation. The adapter pad itself is seen to be comprised of a generally rectangular top section, with depending legs extending from each longitudinal edge thereof. The depending legs are spaced laterally on each longitudinal edge. Such depending legs are fit downwardly into the opening in the bearing adapter and abut the shoulders of the bearing adapter to provide lateral support for the adapter pad. Further lateral support is provided by raised projections extending from the top of the bearing adapter that abut lateral edges of the adapter pad.<br>
Further, the adapter pad may include laterally extending projections extending downwardly from the top section of the adapter pad. Such projections are received in the complementary depressions in the top section of the bearing adapter itself. These projections will correspond to the depressions in the bearing adapter, so it is seen that such projections may be of a general v-shape, formed by two wall sections extending downwardly at an acute angle from the lower surface of the top section. It is also seen that such projections could be of an arcuate nature, extending into complementary arcuate depressions in the top section of the bearing adapter.<br>
The bearing adapter pad may include a recess extending laterally across the top surface of the pad. This recess may be generally rectangular in cross-section and extend across the lateral width of the bearing adapter pad.<br>
The pedestal opening of the sideframe may include a recess extending laterally across the downwardly facing roof section of the pedestal opening. This recess may be generally rectangular in cross-section and extend across the lateral width of the pedestal opening.<br><br>
The bearing adapter pad may include laterally extending projections extending upwardly into complementary depressions in the pedestal opening roof of the sideframe.<br>
The bearing adapter pad may include a top surface that is concave when viewed in a lateral cross-section.<br>
The bearing adapter pad may include a top surface that is depressed in an angled manner from   each   side   edge   toward   the   center   when   viewed   in   a   lateral   cross-section.<br>
The bearing adapter pad may be comprised of two sections, each section extending from a side edge toward a lateral center line of the pedestal opening. A space is left laterally between each adapter pad section.<br>
The bearing adapter pad may be comprised of two sections, each section extending from a side edge to a lateral center line of the pedestal opening.<br>
The bearing adapter pad may include inserts near each lateral side; such inserts extending downwardly to form part or all of the depending legs of the bearing adapter pad. The inserts would be comprised of a higher durometer or stiffer material than the rest of the bearing adapter pad.<br>
The bearing adapter pad may include laterally extending projections extending downwardly from the top section of the adapter pad; such projections would be relatively larger in cross-section than the complementary depressions in the top section of the bearing adapter. Such relative sizing would cause the majority of contact between the pedestal opening lower surface and the top of the bearing adapter pad to occur along lateral paths near the side edges of the bearing adapter pads.<br><br>
