				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of trans-alkenoic acids. The present invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of trans-alkenoic acids of general formula CH3-(CH2)R-CH=(CH2)Ri CC^H wherein R=4-9 Ri=8-16, and more particularly to /raMs-tetracos-15-enoic acid, bioactive constituents possessing dose related hepatoprotective activity.<br>
The acids possess hepatoprotective activity comparable to/better than known formulations. Moreover herbal preparations in use as antihepatotoxic/hepatoprotective ones are unstandardised both from biological and chemical aspects. Here are a few constituents possessing all the promise for use in therapeutics as liver protecting drugs. First report about natural occurrence of an acid of this type viz., fr-aws-tetracos-lS-enoic acid [Wang Huiying, Yu Xuefian, Yi Yuanfen &amp; Ding Jingkai. Yunnan Zhiwu Yanjiu, 1989 11 (1), 60-4 (Ch.)] as a constituent of Jojoba oil ex Simmondsia chinensis seeds (0.62-1.11%) was based on GLC analysis. Both nervonic acid from the brain cerebrosides of cattle &amp; man [Klenk, Z. Physiol Chem. 1925,145,244; 1926,157, 283; 1927,166, 268] &amp; selacholeic acid from shark &amp; ray-liver oils [Tsujimoto, J.Soc. Chem. Ind., Japan 1927, 30, 868] were formulated as cis-tetracos-15-enoic acids.The two identical natural products have been synthesized by malonate chain extension of cw-docos-13-enoic acid [J.B. Hale, W.H. Lycan &amp; Roger Adams. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1930, 52, 4536; Muller &amp; Benzer, Ber., 1939, 72, 615]. In the process tetracos-15-enoic acid was prepared in six steps i.e., (a) Esterification of erucic yield (yield 93%). (b) Reduction of methylerucate with Na metal in n-butyl alcohol (yield 55%), (c) Conversion of erucyl alcohol to erucyl bromide by the action of PBra (yield 50%) (d) Condensation of erucyl bromide with malonic ester over a period of forty eight hours (yield 78%). (e) Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of irucyl malonic ester to tetracos-15-enoic acid (yield 50%) (f)<br>
Isomerization of cis product to trans form (yield 90%), in an overall yield of 9.05%. Another publication [D.G. Bounds, R.P. Linstead &amp; B.C.L. Weedon, Journal of Chemical Society, 1954, 448] reported synthesis of cis &amp; trans-tetracos-15-enoic acid by anodic chain extension of oleic &amp; elaidic acids respectively. In the report electrolysis of oleic &amp; elaidic acids in the presence of excess of methyl hydrogen suberate gave the expected mixture of three products by both symmetrical and unsymmetrical coupling of the two compounds. By distillation and hydrolysis of the unsymmetrical products, mixture of cis &amp; trans-tetracos-15-enoic acids were obtained in 30-35% overall yield.<br>
All the reported synthetic procedures for trans-alkenoic acids till date are lengthy, nonspecific i.e., yielding mixture of cis &amp; trans isomers and end up with very poor yields.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a synthetic method for the production of trans-alkenoic acids, hepatoprotective constituents of natural origin. Another object is to report an economic high yielding synthesis, where the end product i.e., trans-alkenoic acids are obtained up to 70% in overall yield.<br>
In the accompanying specifications general formula of t-alkenoic acid has been described and when R=7 and Ri=13 it represents t-tetracos-15enoic acid.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for synthesis of trans - alkenoic acids of formula CH3-(CH2) R- CH=CH-(CH2)RiCOOH wherein R is 4 to 9, RI is 8 to 16 which comprises (i) reducing bis noralkenoic acids as herein described to corresponding alkenol in the presence of metal hydride 40 to 70% by wt in a conventional manner, (ii) reacting alkenol compound obtained above with brominating agent at a temperature in the range of -10 to 25Â°C for 1 to 4 hrs, recovering bromoalkene by known methods (iii) condensing bromoalkene with carboxylic acid ester 60% by wt. of bromo alkene in presence of alkali metal alkoxide to give dicarbalkoxyalkene, iv) hydrolysing the said dicarbalkoxy alkene to corresponding dicarboxylic acid, (v) decarboxylating by thermal decomposition the<br>
dicarboxylic acid obtained above partially to trans- alkenoic acid, vi) purifying the product by crystallization using solvent such as herein described to obtain trans-alkenoic acid, the said process characterized in the steps of direct reduction of bisnoralkenoic acid to alcohol in presence of metal hydride and use of brominating agent.<br>
In the embodiment of present invention, an improved and high yielding process for the synthesis of trans-alkenoic acids of general formula CH3-(CH2)R-CH=(CH2)RiCO2CO2H where R=4-9 and RI= 8-16, has been described.<br>
&gt;	In another embodiment of the present invention the process particularly for trans-<br>
tetracos-15-enoic acid has been mentioned.<br>
&gt;	In yet another embodiment of the present invention trans-tetracos-15-enoic acid<br>
has been shown to have dose related hepatoprotective activity.<br>
&gt;	In yet another embodiment of the present invention the bis noralkenoic acid used<br>
may be such as trans-henicos-12-enoic acid, trans-docos-14-enoic acid and trans-<br>
icos-12-enoic acid, trans-tetradec-8-enoic acid, trans-docos-13-enoic acid.<br>
&gt;	In another embodiment the brominating agent used may be such as PBrs, PhaP-<br>
Br2 complex.<br>
&gt;	In yet another embodiment the decarboxylation may be carried out by heating the<br>
dicarboxylic acid in a dry state or by heating in wet dimethyl sulphoxide<br>
containing NaCl, NaaPC^ or some other simple salt.<br>
The present invention provides an improved high yielding process for the synthesis of trans-alkenoic acids particularly trans-tetracos-15-enoic acid, bioactive constituents possessing dose related hepatoprotective activity, which is based on malonate, acetoacetate or cyanoacetate chain extension of bis noralkenoic acids which comprises of:<br>
(i)       Reduction of bis noralkenoic acids to corresponding alkenol using complex metal<br>
hydrides in the presence of catechol and/or an organic acid in ether medium, (ii)       Conversion of the alkenol to bromoalkene. (iii)      Condensation of the bromoene with dialkyl malonate or ethylacetoacetate or ethyl<br>
cyanoacetate in presence of alkali metal alkoxide. (iv)      Hydrolysis of 1,1 -dicarbalkoxyalkene or 1 -acetyl-1 -carbalkoxyalkene or 1 -cyano-<br>
1-carbalkoxyalkene to the corresponding dicarboxylic acid, (v)      Partial decarboxylation of the dicarboxylic acid to /raws-alkenoic acid . vi)       Crystallisation of the final product from an organic solvent having 1-4 C atoms by<br>
chilling at subzero temperatures.<br>
Complex metal hydride used in step (i) may be chosen from LiAlHj NaBFLt or the like. Organic acid used in step (i) may be chosen from CbCCOOH, FsCCOOH and the like. Ether medium employed in step (i) may be chosen from diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or methyl cellosolve. Conversion of enol to bromocompound in step (ii) may be carried out with PBrs or PHaP-B complex. Alkyl malonate used in (iii) may be chosen from dimethylmalonate and diethylmalonate, acetoacetate may be ethyl acetoacetate or methyl acetoacetate and cyanoacetate may be ethyl cyanoacetate or methyl cyanoacetate. Alkali metal alkoxide employed in (iii) may be selected from Na/K methoxide and ethoxide. Hydrolysis of diester in step (iv) may be carried out using aqueous or methanolic NaOH or KOH or (CH3)3 COK (1.5M-2.5M). Partial decarboxylation in step (v) is carried out by dry heating of the diacid at 170-200Â°C in an oil bath or by heating in wet dimethyl sulphoxide containing NaCl, NasPCv or some other simple salt at 120-130Â°. The solvent<br>
employed for crystallization of the final product may be chosen from methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropanol or ethyl acetate.<br>

Advantages of the synthetic procedure over the earlier ones:<br>
a).       The number of steps have been reduced, one such step being direct reduction of<br>
acid to alcohol without using esterification route, b).       Use of modified reagents viz., PhsP-B^ in place of PBrs has resulted in higher<br>
yields, c).       Even in malonate condensation and hydrolysis steps, reaction time has been<br>
appreciably reduced, e).       The product obtained is mainly the desired trans isomer, which could be attributed<br>
to thermodynamic control, f).        The procedure can be effectively and economically employed for the synthesis of<br>
/ram-alkenoic acids from corresponding 6/s-noralkenoic acids.<br><br><br><br><br>
