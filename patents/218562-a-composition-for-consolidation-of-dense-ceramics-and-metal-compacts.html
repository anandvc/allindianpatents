				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for consolidation of particulate slurries<br>
including dense oxide, non-oxide ceramic and metal compacts. In particular, the invention<br>
relates to consolidation of ceramic or metallic materials involving saccharides selectively<br>
monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides in combination<br>
with one or more of water-soluble polymerizable, other organic binders and gel forming<br>
materials.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Advanced ceramic or metallic materials have a large number of existing as well as<br>
emerging applications in areas that span a wide range including chemical, structural,<br>
electrical, electronic, wear resistant, thermal. Fabrication of advanced ceramic or metallic<br>
components from powders requires preparation of dense green compacts of various<br>
shapes. There are a number of well-known processes of fabrication of dense ceramic or<br>
metallic bodies that are based on use of aqueous slurries. The most common ones being<br>
slip casting [Ratan K. Govila, "Strength of Slip-cast, Sintered Silicone Nitride", J. Am.<br>
Ceram. Soc, 73 [6] 1744-51 (1990) ; Andrew J. Ruys and Charles C. Sorrell, "Slip<br>
Casting Alumina with Na-CMC", Am. Ceram. Soc. Bull., 75 [11] 66-69 (1996)],<br>
gelcasting [O. O. Omatete, M.A. Janney and R.A. Strehlow, "Gel casting - A new ceramic<br>
forming process", Am. Ceram. Soc. Bull., 70 [10] 1641-49 (1991); M. A. Janney, S. D.<br>

Editor, Marcel Dekker, 1998; M. A. Janney and O. O. Omatete, "Method for Molding<br>
Ceramic Powders Using a Water-Based Gelcasting," U. S. Pat. No. 5,028,362, July 2,<br>

"Method for Molding Ceramic Powders, " U. S. Pat. No. 4,894,194, Jan. 16, 1990] and<br>
the recently invented direct coagulation casting [Wenjie Si, Thomas J. Graule, Felix H.<br>
Baader and Ludwig J. Gauckler, "Direct Coagulation Casting of Silicon Carbide<br>
Components", J. Am. Ceram. Soc, 82 [5] 1129-36 (1999); F. Filser, P. Kocher, L. J.<br>
Gauckler, H. Luthy, P. Sharer, "Aggregation and Gelation of Concentrated Colloidal<br>
Suspensions", A patent application for this method was filed with the Swiss Institute of<br>
Intellectual Property on 27 February 2000 under number 200 0335/00 ; T. J. Graule,<br>
J. Gauckler, F. H. Badder, "Direct Coagulation Casting-A New Green Shaping<br>
Technique Part I: Processing Principles ", Industrial Ceramics, 16 [1] 31-35 (1996)].<br>
Slip casting has been used for a long time and has many limitations including the<br>
constraint of using porous molds, results in low green strength and non-uniform<br>
shrinkage. While gelcasting has many advantages over most of the well-known ceramic<br>
fabrications processes there are a number of aspects, which make the process<br>
unfavourable for large-scale use.<br>
Gelcasting depends on in-situ polymerization of the water-soluble monomer-crosslinker,<br>
which requires homogeneous mixing of small amount of initiator and catalyst into large<br>
volume of slurries. Also the free radical polymerization is significantly inhibited in<br>
presence of air (oxygen) thus requiring the use of inert environment. If inert environment<br>
is not used, gelation (polymerization) remains incomplete and the unreacted monomer<br>
migrates during drying and crystallizes on the exposed surface. The crystals of the<br>
unreacted monomer can be a source of defects in sintered samples. It must be noted that<br>
specifically the surface of the gelcast parts does not undergo complete gelation as it is<br>
directly exposed to air. This incomplete gelation of the surface leads to surface spallation<br>
and associated defects [J. Ma, Z. Xie, H. Miao, L. Zhou and Y. Huang, "Elimination of<br>
surface Spallation of Alumina Green Bodies Prepared by Acrylamide-Based Gelcasting<br>
via Poly(vinylpyrrolidone)", J. Am. Ceram. Soc, 86 [2] 266-72 (2003)]. The sample<br>
surface often does not thus have a good finish.<br>
The gelcast parts are very sensitive to drying conditions. Thus, the use of closed molds<br>
becomes almost essential. When open molds are used, during gelation non-uniform<br>
drying is unavoidable leading to defects. Unless extreme care is taken, the gelcast parts<br>
often develop curvature and/or cracks during drying. When casting large parts the<br>
restraint to shrinkage due to weight of the samples itself leads to cracking. Casting of<br>
complex shapes that involve use of a core or otherwise where the mold feature restrain<br>
the drying shrinkage, cracking of gelcast parts occurs easily.<br>
Direct coagulation casting is a recently invented process, which is based on developing a<br>
green body by uniform coagulation of particles through manipulation of the ionic<br>
or changing pH. The green body produced by manipulation of ionic strength hits plasticity<br>
im.1 YP<br>
but involves shrinkage during drying. While the green body produced by attaining change<br>
in pH has no plasticity but has zero shrinkage. Though the above processes of direct<br>
coagulation casting have some advantages but they do not involve the use of binder,<br>
which makes the green bodies/weaker. The change in ionic strength or pH is achieved by<br>
heating the slurry after having been poured in the molds. Thus, the use of the above<br>
process is restricted to use of the molds that are stable during heating.<br>
Another known process involves use of aqueous ceramic slurries based on use of proteins<br>
to make dense ceramic compacts [O. Lyckfeldt, J. Brandt, S. Lesca, "Protein Forming - a<br>
Novel Shaping Technique for Ceramics" J. Eur. Ceram. Soc. 20 [14-15] 2551-2559<br>
(2000); Patent EP767154 Al]. A study of similar process based on use of ovalbumin in<br>
fabrication of dense ceramic components has shown several limitations with the process.<br>
The ceramic loading in the slurries has to be limited to 45 — 50 volume % due to increase<br>
in viscosity in presence of ovalbumin. The poor fluidity due to polymeric nature of<br>
ovalbumin when the slurry is kept at rest makes elimination of air bubbles difficult. The<br>
constraint of maintaining low solids loading results in large shrinkage during drying. The<br>
samples are sensitive to the drying rate and have to be dried under controlled humidity<br>
conditions. During drying, the samples suffer from migration of binder to the exposed<br>
surface, which sometimes leads to lamination cracks [S. Dhara, P. Bhargava, "Egg White<br>
as an Environment Friendly Low-Cost Binder for Gelcasting of Ceramics", J. Am.<br>
Ceram. Soc, 84 [12] 3048-50 (2001)].<br>
For all of the above processes, the cast samples do not possess sufficient strength and thus<br>
may pose problems during unmolding.<br>
In case of some specific commercially important ceramics, like silicon carbide, the<br>
preparation of aqueous suspension involves dispersion of particles under basic pH<br>
conditions created by use of a base like tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH).<br>
Under basic pH conditions, the free silicon often present with the silicon carbide powder<br>
reacts to produce hydrogen gas, which causes defects in the green body. Also, during<br>
gelcasting of the above aqueous silicon carbide suspensions, the initiator ammonium<br>
persulphate (APS) also react with free silicon to produce nitrogen gas, which may again<br>
result into defects in green bodies.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide composition for<br>
consolidation of participate slurries such as dense oxide, non-oxide ceramic and metal<br>
compacts which would avoid the prior art limitations of providing such dense<br>
ceramic/metal compacts.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to make the cast bodies significantly less<br>
sensitive to drying conditions.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to induce plasticity in cast samples such that the<br>
samples are less prone to cracking.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to improve the surface finish of the as cast<br>
ceramic or metal compacts.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to increase the green strength of the ceramic or<br>
metal compacts utilizing the synergistic effect of the organic binders and the saccharides.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a simple environment friendly<br>
process for fabrication of dense ceramic and metal compacts, which obviates the<br>
drawbacks of presently known process of fabrication of dense ceramic/metal compacts as<br>
detailed above.<br>
Another object is to make selective use of saccharides including monosaccharides,<br>
disaccharides (e.g., sucrose), oligosaccharides and polysaccharides in combination with<br>
water-soluble polymerizable, other organic binders and gel forming materials not limited<br>
to but inclusive of methacrylamide (MAM)-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAM), phenol-<br>
formaldehyde resin, water soluble proteins such as egg white (ovalbumin), bovine serum<br>
albumin, gelatin, whey protein concentrate, collagen etc.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to improvement in processes<br>
involving casting of aqueous suspensions.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to selectively provide monosaccharides<br>
(glucose, fructose), disaccharides (especially sucrose) and oligosaccharides as the<br>
dispersing agent for ceramic and metal powder particles.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide aqueous slurries with reduced<br>
viscosity and yield stress to enable easy pouring and easy removal of air bubbles.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to enable preparation of highly loaded aqueous<br>
slurries that have low viscosity and yield stress.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to make possible gelling and drying as a single<br>
step and carry out drying of the samples while still contained in the molds.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to reduce drying shrinkage of cast body such<br>
that even very large components can be fabricated free of defects such as cracks,<br>
curvature etc.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to minimize binder migration during drying of<br>
cast samples.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided composition for<br>
consolidation of particulate slurries such as dense oxide, non-oxide ceramic, metal<br>
compacts comprising a selective/synergistic combination of one or more saccharides<br>
including monosaccharide, disaccharide, oligosaccharide and polysaccharide and atleast<br>
one of water soluble polymerizable, organic binders and gel forming materials.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided dense<br>
ceramic/metal compacts from aqueous particulate slurries involving anyone or more of<br>
monosaccharide, disaccharide, oligosaccharide and polysaccharide in combination with<br>
water soluble polymerizable, other organic binders and gel forming materials.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided improvement in<br>
process of manufacture of dense ceramic/metal compacts from aqueous particulate<br>
slurries involving one or more saccharides including monosaccharide, disaccharide,<br>
oligosaccharide and polysaccharide in combination with one or more of water soluble<br>
polymerizable, organic binders and gel forming materials.<br>
Importantly, the invention disclosed above is directed to offer tremendous unprecedented<br>
advantages in ceramic processing by way of advantageous selective application of ability<br>
of sucrose to hold water. These benefits by use of sucrose are almost impossible to<br>
achieve by most other known methods or compositions.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that addition of monosaccharides,<br>
disaccharides, oligosaccharides or polysaccharides, preferably sucrose, to the composition<br>
for consolidation of particulate slurries offers many advantages including, but not limited<br>
to:<br>
• Shrinkage in ceramic compacts derived from such aqueous slurries can be<br>
controlled.<br>
• Gelation and drying can be effected simultaneously without any risk of cracking the<br>
samples. Samples prepared from sucrose containing slurries experienced significantly<br>
reduced drying shrinkage consequently making the samples less sensitive to drying<br>
conditions. Since sucrose has inherent property of retaining moisture, the drying rate was<br>
naturally slowed down, making the sample less sensitive to drying conditions in turn.<br>
• The migration of binder can be minimized which helps in obtaining homogenous<br>
samples. Comparison of the interrupted binder burnout runs of sample without and with<br>
sucrose indicated significantly reduced binder migration in latter samples. The reduced<br>
binder migration was clear form the almost uniform color attributed to the binder in the<br>
interrupted binder burnout samples.<br>
• The saccharides added reduce the viscosity of the aqueous slurry.<br>
• The said reduction in viscosity due to saccharide addition has a latent beneficial<br>
effect on control of entrapped air bubble population in the aqueous slurry.<br>
• Induced plasticity: Samples containing sucrose were not only resistant to cracking<br>
but the induced plasticity enabled shaping of sucrose containing foams simply by<br>
deformation without leading to any cracking.<br>
• Homogenous microstructure and High strength: Addition of sucrose resulted in<br>
lowering of viscosity indicative of greater steric hindrance, which resulted in slurries with<br>
little or no entrapped air bubbles. The samples thus obtained had higher strength and<br>
elastic modulus.<br>
The invention therefore provides for a saccharide-based composition for consolidation of<br>
particulate slurries including non-oxide ceramic, metal compacts and the non-oxide<br>
ceramic, metal compacts obtained involving the same.<br>
It was further seen that addition of sucrose or polysaccharides had beneficial effects on<br>
particularly egg white based alumina slurries and also on the compacts obtained form<br>
such slurries. Further experiments were conducted with increasing amount of<br>
polysaccharides or sucrose in the 55% by volume alumina slurries and also for 15% by<br>
volume alumina slurries. It was seen that there existed an optimum amount of sucrose for<br>
both low and high solids loading slurries. This optimum amount of sucrose yielded the<br>
highest green, sintered strength and the best surface finish, the amount of sucrose on the<br>
higher side being limited by sample deformation, due to melting of sucrose during heating<br>
and due to the difficulties during binder burn out for either of the low or high solids<br>
loading. The amount of sucrose added was limited on the lower side by only a marginal<br>
decrease in viscosity. Thus, the composition described above is not a mere admixture and<br>
would not be an obvious derivative to a person skilled in the art in terms of the known use<br>
of saccharides and its purpose in the composition.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the saccharide used is preferably<br>
sucrose. Sucrose is unique among saccharides as it is the most easily available naturally<br>
occurring polyhydroxyl aldehyde. Sucrose results in the lowest yield stress as compared o<br>
other saccharides like mono, di, oligo and poly saccharides etc. the drastic influence of<br>
sucrose addition for ovalbumin based slurries is clearly visible from the fact that in<br>
absence of sucrose, it becomes difficult to obtain high ceramic loading. The addition of<br>
even a small amount of sucrose to the slurries makes it easier to obtain high solids<br>
loading.<br>
The consolidation composition described above can be further made storage stable by<br>
addition of commercially available biocides or by keeping the slurries under slight<br>
agitation. The storage stable composition thus obtained can be used directly when<br>
required for obtaining the compact.<br>
The compacts of the proposed compositions could be consolidated by any of the casting<br>
routes that involve pouring or injecting the slurries in open or closed molds followed by<br>
gelation of the ceramic slurries simply by heating. Thin sheets of ceramic could be<br>
obtained by tape casting. With manipulation of composition such that a paste like mixture<br>
is obtained, dense ceramic compacts could be produced through extrusion also. It would<br>
be evident to a person skilled in the art that many such other variations of the composition<br>
described herein are possible, which are hereby intended to be within the scope and ambit<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The process for forming of dense ceramic components from aqueous particulate slurries<br>
is, therefore, based on water-soluble polymerizable, other organic binders and gel forming<br>
materials in combination with one or all of the saccharides including monosaccharides,<br>
disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, the water-soluble polymerizable<br>
organic binder and gel forming material being preferably selected from Acrylamides,<br>
methacrylamide/methylenebis acrylamide, Carrageenan, Starch, Urea-formaldehyde<br>
resin, Phenol formaldehyde resin, Phenol urea resin, Hydroxymethacrylamide, any<br>
protein and gelatin etc. Urea and formaldehyde are soluble in water and phenol is partly<br>
soluble. Accordingly, the components used may be individually soluble in water, if the<br>
resin becomes insoluble, it may still be used in the present invention.<br>
The proposed process is capable of forming simple to complex ceramic or metallic<br>
components with wide range of sizes. The aqueous ceramic slurries containing<br>
ovalbumin-sucrose may be used to obtain bullet proof grade dense alumina tile, various<br>
types of ceramic nozzles for high speed water jets, pouring of molten metals etc.,<br>
threaded bolts, specialized ceramic crucibles, ceramic knife, ceramic tubes and large area<br>
ceramic compacts such as SiC space mirror etc. .<br>
The proposed process involves addition of controlled amount of the saccharides to the<br>
above-mentioned organic binder containing aqueous ceramic or metal particulate slurries.<br>
Ceramic or metal powder, dispersant, water, any of the above mentioned organic binders<br>
and one of the saccharides are mixed/milled in a ball mill in presence of hard ceramic<br>
milling media. A typical slurry composition may consist of 15 - 80 volume % ceramic or<br>
metal powders, a prior optimized amount of dispersant, and the rest is water, any of the<br>
above mentioned binders and any one of the saccharides. The organic binder-water ratio<br>
could be adjusted to obtain the desired viscosity. The saccharides could be added upto<br>
about 85-wt % of the ceramic or metal powder. With increasing amount of sucrose the<br>
shrinkage of the dense body reduced eventually approaching zero.<br>
While a much broader composition range could be used in forming dense ceramic/metal<br>
compacts as previously described, the preferred slurry composition could be in the<br>
following range — Ceramic loading 45 — 60 volume %, ovalbumin 1-100 volume % and<br>
1 - 80% sucrose on a dry powder weight basis.<br>
In the most preferred embodiment, the ceramic solid loading can be varied from 10 — 60<br>
volume %, the binder, which may be preferably ovalbumin, amount may range from 10 -<br>
30 volume % based on amount of premix used and saccharide, which is preferably<br>
sucrose, may be varied from 1-5 weight % on dry powder weight basis.<br>
Importantly, selective additions of saccharides specifically sucrose resulted in lowering of<br>
the yield stress thus enabling easy pouring of the highly loaded slurries. Also, the use of<br>
saccharides prevented binder migration in the cast parts. Presence of polyhydroxy groups<br>
in saccharides was responsible for holding water molecules, which made the drying rate<br>
slower as well as induced plasticity in the cast parts. The reduced shrinkage due to<br>
presence of saccharides made the parts significantly less sensitive to drying rate and<br>
conditions. Also the reduced shrinkage was a great advantage when casting complex<br>
components particularly with curvature, thin-thick sections or the ones that involved use<br>
of cores. Heavy sections which typically cracked due to resistance to drying shrinkage<br>
under the weight of the part can be made easily due to minimal shrinkage. Gelation and<br>
drying could be done in a single step. The parts are not likely to crack regardless of the<br>
drying rate or conditions. For the above process aqueous slurries were also made without<br>
using the dispersant where sucrose also served the purpose of dispersing the ceramic or<br>
metal powder particles. The plasticity of the parts due to presence of saccharid<br>
the mold removal easy and also resulted in improved surface finish.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The invention, its objects and advantages are explained in greater detail in relation to<br>
following non-limiting exemplary illustrations.<br>
Example 1<br>
An improved process for forming of dense ceramic components from ovalbumin-based<br>
slurries is proposed. The proposed process is capable of forming simple to complex<br>
ceramic components with wide range of size.<br>
The proposed improved proce.ss involves addition of controlled amount of sucrose to<br>
ovalbumin based aqueous slurries. Ceramic powder, water, ovalbumin and sucrose are<br>
mixed/milled in a ball mill in presence of hard ceramic milling media and antifoaming<br>
agent with or without addition of dispersants. A typical slurry composition may consist of<br>
15-80 volume % ceramics or metal powder or combination of both, a prior optimized<br>
amount of dispersant and the rest is water, ovalbumin and sucrose. The ovalbumin-water<br>
ratio could be adjusted to obtain the desired viscosity. Sucrose could be added upto 65-wt<br>
% of ceramic powder. With increasing amount of sucrose, the shrinkage of the dense<br>
body reduced eventually approaching zero.<br>
The resulted slurry is cast in desired mold followed by temperature-induced gelation and<br>
drying to form green compacts. The green compacts formed are subjected to binder<br>
burnout and sintering to get the final components.<br>
The reduced shrinkage made the parts significantly less sensitive to drying rate and<br>
conditions. Also the reduced shrinkage has a great advantage when casting complex<br>
components particularly with curvature, thin-thick sections or the ones that involved use<br>
of cores. Heavy sections, which typically cracked due to resistance to drying shrinkage<br>
under the weight of the part, can be made easily due to minimal shrinkage. Gelation and<br>
drying can be done in a single step. The parts are not likely to crack regardless of the<br>
drying rate or conditions.<br>
The beneficial role of sucrose in lowering slurry viscosity could also be utilized is highly<br>
loaded alumina slurries. Without the addition of sucrose, it would not have been possible<br>
to prepare ceramic compacts samples from some of the highly loaded alumina slurries. A<br>
slurry composition containing 55-volume % alumina (d50 =7 micrometer, surface area<br>
7m2/gm), with 20-volumes % ovalbumin in ovalbumin-water mix, could not even be<br>
prepared easily due to very high viscosity. All of the above problems were addressed by<br>
replacing part of the ovalbumin with sucrose. Addition of 1.7-wt % sucrose to the above<br>
slurry resulted in lowering of viscosity.<br>
Example 2<br>
An improved process for forming of dense ceramic, metal compacts using any of the<br>
polymerizable materials (such as MAM-MBAM, phenol-formaldehyde or phenol-urea)<br>
based slurries is proposed. The proposed process is capable of forming ceramic simple to<br>
complex components with wide range of size.<br>
The proposed improved process involves addition of controlled amount of sucrose to any<br>
of the polymerizable materials based aqueous slurries. Ceramic powder, water,<br>
polymerizable binders (such as MAM-MBAM, phenol-formaldehyde or phenol-urea) and<br>
sucrose are mixed/milled in a ball mill in presence of hard ceramic milling media and<br>
antifoaming agent with or without addition of dispersants. A typical slurry composition<br>
may consist of 15 - 80 volume % ceramic or metal powder or combination of both, a prior<br>
optimized amount of dispersant and the rest is water, polymerizable binders monomer and<br>
sucrose. Sucrose could be added upto 65-wt % of ceramic powder. With increasing<br>
amount of sucrose the shrinkage of the dense body reduced eventually approaching zero.<br>
The resulted slurry is cast in desired mold followed by temperature-induced gelation and<br>
drying to form green compacts. The green compact formed are subjected to binder<br>
burnout and sintering to get the final components.<br>
The reduced shrinkage made the parts significantly less sensitive to drying rate and<br>
conditions. Also the reduced shrinkage has a great advantage when casting complex<br>
components particularly with curvature, thin-thick sections or the ones that involved use<br>
of cores. Heavy sections, which typically cracked due to resistance to drying shrinkage<br>
under the weight of the part, can be made easily due to minimal shrinkage. Gelation and<br>
drying can be done in a single step. The parts are not likely to crack regardless of the<br>
drying rate or conditions.<br>
The beneficial role of sucrose in lowering slurry viscosity could also be utilized in highly<br>
loaded alumina slurries. Without the addition of sucrose, it would not have been possible<br>
to prepare ceramic or metal compacts samples from some of the highly loaded slurries.<br>
Controlled addition of sucrose increase moisture holding tendency resulted in plasticity of<br>
the samples thus green compacts are less prone to crack during drying. The compacts are<br>
relatively stronger due to use of this combination of the binders. Association of the<br>
sucrose molecules with polymerizable binder materials reduces binder migration and<br>
inhibits crystal growth of the ungelled monomer.<br>
Example 3<br>
An improved process for forming of dense silicon carbide and silicon nitride components<br>
from ovalbumin-based slurries is proposed. The proposed process is capable of forming<br>
simple to complex ceramic components with wide range of sizes.<br>
The proposed improved process involves addition of controlled amount of sucrose to<br>
ovalbumin based aqueous slurries. Silicon carbide powder, water, ovalbumin and sucrose<br>
are mixed/milled in a ball mill in presence of hard ceramic milling media and antifoaming<br>
agent with or without addition of dispersants. A typical slurry composition may consist of<br>
15 - 80 volume % silicon carbide or silicon nitride powder without use of any dispersant<br>
and the rest is water, ovalbumin and sucrose. The ovalbumin-water ratio could be<br>
adjusted to obtain the desired viscosity. Sucrose could be added upto 65-wt % of ceramic<br>
powder. With increasing amount of sucrose, the shrinkage of the dense body reduced<br>
eventually approaching zero.<br>
The resulted slurry is cast in desired mold followed by temperature-induced gelation and<br>
drying to form green compacts. The green compact formed are subjected to binder<br>
burnout and sintering to get the final components.<br>
As sucrose act as dispersant, the reaction of free silicon present in the ceramic powder<br>
surface with basic medium is prevented. Thus green compacts of the SiC, Si3N4 can be<br>
produced without much of defects. More over, the sucrose helps in dispersion of the SiC,<br>
Si3N4 and SiO2 powders.<br>
The reduced shrinkage made the parts significantly less sensitive to drying rate and<br>
conditions. Also the reduced shrinkage has a great advantage when casting complex<br>
components particularly with curvature, thin-thick sections or the ones that involved use<br>
of cores. Heavy sections, which typically cracked due to resistance to drying shrinkage<br>
under the weight of the part, can be made easily due to minimal shrinkage. Gelation and<br>
drying can be done in a single step. The parts are not likely to crack regardless of the<br>
drying rate or conditions. The beneficial role of sucrose in lowering slurry viscosity could<br>
also be utilized in highly loaded slurries.<br>
Example 4<br>
An improved process for forming of dense metal compacts using any of the<br>
polymerizable materials (such as MAM-MBAM, phenol-formaldehyde or phenol-urea) or<br>
water-soluble protein based slurries is proposed. The proposed process is capable of<br>
forming ceramic simple to complex components with wide range of size.<br>
It is difficult to make stable dispersed slurry using metal powder owing to high specific<br>
gravity. Use of sucrose with combination of water-soluble protein and/ any other<br>
poymerizable binders (monomer-cross linker) resulted in increase in specific gravity of<br>
the liquid mix. Preparation of slurry using metal powders and sucrose-binders mix (such<br>
as ovalbumin, MAM-MBAM) resulted in stable suspensions due to decrease in difference<br>
specific gravity of both powder and mix of binder-saccharides. The slurry is prepared<br>
using different amount of metal powders, water, binders and sucrose with dispersant.<br>
The resulted slurry is cast in desired mold followed by temperature-induced gelation and<br>
drying to form green compacts. The green compact formed are subjected to binder<br>
burnout and sintering to get the final components.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above invention to achieve significantly reduced<br>
shrinkage with appropriate amount of addition of sucrose. Moreover, the reduced drying<br>
shrinkage coupled with pseudoplasticity and binding properties of sucrose ensure crack<br>
free samples each and every time. For the above reasons it is possible by way of the<br>
above invention to achieve layered ceramics as the drying rate is reduced thus minimizing<br>
any mismatches between sequentially cast layers.<br>
Also, the samples can be dried without controlling humidity. If required gelation and<br>
drying could be done in a single step or the samples could be dried at above ambient<br>
temperature (about 50°C) soon after casting. Slurries could be dried by stirring under low<br>
vacuum without fearing for loss of significant amount of water which would raise the<br>
viscosity of the slurries. It would also be possible, due to the present invention, to use<br>
open molds. Importantly, large sized parts can be made without defects during post-<br>
processing. Importantly, casting and drying defects can be minimized following the<br>
teachings of the present invention. Addition of sucrose to MAM-MBAM or other<br>
polymerizable binders can achieve reduced drying rate and shrinkage, which helps in<br>
minimization of defects. The above mentioned use of the combination of sucrose and the<br>
binders is also directed to increase in green strength and inhibit the binder migration due<br>
to association of sucrose with the binders.<br>
The other further advantages in the selective combination of ovalbumin and sucrose<br>
include the possibility of the use of high molecular weight binder (ovalbumin) with high<br>
ceramic loading and yet maintaining high flowability of the slurries. Selective use of<br>
sucrose is found to reduce the slurry viscosity and yield stress. The association of sucrose<br>
with protein (ovalbumin) inhibits binder migration. A homogeneous green body with high<br>
green strength is produced. Besides the large number of advantages, the combination of<br>
sucrose and ovalbumin is a commonly available, naturally occurring, low cost,<br>
environment friendly alternative for ceramic processing.<br>
