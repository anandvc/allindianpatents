				<td>With the cover mounting and the distance between the mountings, in the<br>
same manner. Such a new adjustment of the flexible bend is expensive.<br>
Besides that, the geometry of the flexible bend is dependent on the number<br>
of the adjusting screws. For this purpose lateral card elements, for example,<br>
drive, suction and also the cover rod are to be mounted time and again in<br>
the stand-still condition. This is fraught with substantial erection expenses.<br>
Besides, that, through the standstill position and running production<br>
operation of the card is interrupted. The Invention therefore, makes the<br>
problem as the basis, to arrange for a device of the nature described in the<br>
beginning, which avoids the mentioned disadvantages, which renders<br>
possible especially a change of the intensity of carding in a simple manner,<br>
preferably during the running of the operation.<br>
The solution of this problem takes place through the characteristic features<br>
as described herein under.<br>
It is possible through the measures, in accordance with the Invention, to<br>
change as reaction on alterations of technological magnitude, for example,<br>
Nissen-digit and/or fibre damage, which change the intensity of the carding<br>
in a simple manner. A further special advantage exists therein, that after<br>
successful displacement of the sliding guide the uniform distance between<br>
the cover mountings and the drum mounting at all the stages through the<br>
circumference remains retained, whereby a substantial improvement of the<br>
generated fibre band is achieved. The position of the convex outer surface<br>
of the sliding guide is radially shifted. The flexibility (elasticity) of the<br>
sliding guide ensures, that the bend form of the outer surface of the sliding<br>
guide is matchable, so that thereby the uniformity of the distance between<br>
the cover and the drum fitting is ensured at all positions throughout the<br>
circumference. A further advantage existing therein, that the shifting can<br>
take place continuously, for example, in operation also. That can take place<br>
automatically or on "button press" without delay, whereby each time-<br>
consuming erection expenses and each production interruption can be<br>
avoided. It is specially further advantageous, that the convex outer surface<br>
of the sliding guide-on which the convering head lies on each case - is<br>
shifted on both the sides of the machine concentrically for the drum<br>
circumference (drum shell) in radial direction. In this manner it becomes<br>
possible to shift endlessly many supporting points for the cover-heads<br>
continuously.<br>
It is provided functionally that the distance between the convex outer<br>
surface of the sliding guide and of the concave inner surface of the sliding<br>
guide in the circumferential direction decreases rather increases and the<br>
distance between the convex bearing surface of the flexible bend and<br>
between the axle of the drum accordingly increases rather decreases, so that<br>
the total of both the distances at all positions through the circumference is<br>
constant. According to a further advantageous development, in case of<br>
which the distance between the curved (arched) convex outer surface of the<br>
sliding guide and the concave inner surface of the sliding guide is constant,<br>
is realized, that between the sliding guide and the bearing surface of the<br>
flexible bend an intermediate layer is existent and the distance between the<br>
concave out surface of the intermediate layer of the convex inner surface of<br>
the intermediate layer in the circumferential direction decreases rather<br>
increases and the distance between the convex bearing surface of the<br>
flexible bend and of the axle of the drum accordingly increases or<br>
decreases, so that the total of both the distances at all the positions through<br>
the circumference is constant. Preferably it is provided, that between the<br>
sliding guide and the bearing surface of the flexible bend an intermediate<br>
layer is existent and the distance between the convex outer surface of the<br>
sliding guide and of the concave inner surface of the sliding guide in the<br>
circumferential direction decreases rather increases and the distance<br>
between the convex outer surface of the intermediate element and the axle<br>
of the drum accordingly increases and decreases, so that the total of both<br>
the distances at all the positions through the circumference is constant.<br>
According to a further preferred development in case of which the distance<br>
between the curved convex outer surface of the sliding guide and the<br>
concave inner surface of the sliding guide is constant, is realized, that<br>
between the sliding guide and the bearing surface of the flexible bend two<br>
intermediate layers are existent and the distance between the convex outer<br>
surface and the concave inner surface of the first intermediate layer<br>
decreases rather increases in the circumferential direction and the distance<br>
between convex outer surface of the second intermediate layer and the axle<br>
of the drum accordingly increases rather decreases, so that the total of both<br>
the distances at all the positions through the circumference is constant<br>

whereby the convex outer surface of the sliding guide is displaceable<br>
concentrically in the radial direction locally The displacement of the sliding<br>
guide in the circumferential direction on a bend (arch) renders possible a<br>
bending - stable cross section for the sliding guide. The sliding guide in<br>

opposite.<br>

intermediate layer is rather are displaceable with advantage in the<br>
circumferential direction, for example, shiftable, whereby the convex outer<br>
surface of the sliding guide is displaceable concentrically in the radial<br>
direction locally. Both the intermediate layers are preferably displaceable<br>
in the circumferential direction, for example, shiftable, whereby the convex<br>
outer surface of the sliding guide is displaceable concentrically in the radial<br>
direction locally. Functionally during the displacement there glides, for<br>
example, during shifting, in each case, two wedge-shaped developed<br>
elements on one another. Preferably the sliding guide shows the form of a<br>
bent wedge (key). With advantage the intermediate layer shows rather the<br>

surface of the sliding guide increases rather decreases, uniformly. With<br>
advantage the convex outer surface of the sliding gnide is displaceable<br>
concentrically for the shell surface of the drum. It is preferred that the<br>
convex outer surface of the sliding guide is bent in a circular manner.<br>
Functionally, there lies the concave inner surface of the sliding of the shell<br>
surface of the flexible bend. Preferably there lies at a device, in a case of<br>
which the flexible bend has a clearance, (recess), for example, groove for<br>

sliding guide is appropriately fabricated through machining for<br>
example grinding etc. Preferably the form of the concave bearing surface of<br>

convex outer surface 23a and the axle M of the drum 4 increases<br>
accordingly from h1 to h2, so that the total of both the distances g and h is<br>
constant at all the positions through the circumference. The central-point of<br>
the convex outer surface 20 a and the central point of the convex outer<br>
surface 17a correspond with the central-point M of the drum 4. The central-<br>

constant in all the positions through the circumference. The central points<br>
of the convex outer surface 20a, of the concave inner surface 20b of the<br>
convex outer surface 17a correspond with the central point M of the drum<br>

(elastic), slidable synthetic material is according to Fig. 7b inserted in the<br>
groove 25 in the process of which, a part is existent in the groove 25 and<br>
the other part projects over the convex outer surface 17a. The sliding guide<br>
20 is shiftable within the groove in the direction of the arrow-head A, B, in<br>
the process of which, the concave inner surface 20b and the groove 25a<br>
glides along. The lateral surfaces 25b and 25c build lateral glides for the<br>
sliding guide 20. The development corresponds functionally, for example,<br>
with Fig. 3.<br>

surface 20b and the groove base 25a a shiftable intermediate layer 23 is<br>

functionally with, for example, Fig. 4.<br>
In the Figures 9a and 9b the shifting of the sliding guide 20 on the flexible<br>
bend 17 in the direction of the arrow-head A is represented. Through the<br>
shifting, for example, by around 50 mm, the distance b between the cover<br>
top 14c and the drum mounting 4a i.e. the distance b between pointed<br>
circles 21 and 22 enlarges from b1 (Fig. 9a), for example, 0.30 mm to b2<br>
(Fig. 9b), for example, 0.5 mm. The covering bars 13 are moved slowly<br>
between the cover guide roller 13a and the cover guiding roller 13b b<br>
