				<td>TLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Amorphous Transformer ICKGROUKD OF THE Inventions Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an amorphous transformer and more particularly, to an  improvement of an inner frame arranged inside a window part of an amorphous goop core of an amorphous transformer. Description of the prior art<br>
A conventional amorphous transformer has a pair )f coils 1, 2 arranged side by side as indicated in Fig. lA. A first and a second U-shaped frame elements 3, 4 are fitted from opposite directions at facing parts la, 2a of the coils 1, 2, whereby engagement parts 3a, 4a are engaged with each other to form a coupling part 5, thus constituting an inner frame 6 as shown in Figs. 4A, 5 and 6. Cut end parts 7a, 7b of a rectangular loop amorphous core 7 are inserted in holes lb, 2b of the coils 1, 2 and, coupled at a joint part 7c after passed through the coils 1, 2. In the constitution, the inner frame 6 is located along an inner periphery of the core 7 thereby to reinforce the core 7. The first frame element 3 of the inner frame 6 is formed of stainless steel {referred to as SUS hereinafter) and the second frame element 4 is formed of cold rolled steel plate (referred to as SPCC hereinafter)<br><br>
so as not to form a closed magnetic path. The amorphous loop core 7 has a pair of confronting leg parts 7d, 7e and a pair of confronting yoke parts 7f, 7g and is formed rectangular. The joint part 7c mentioned earlier is provided at the yoke part 7g.<br>
The amorphous loop core 7 in the conventional amorphous transformer as above is obtained by layering amorphous metallic bands of a nominal thickness of 0.025mm. Because of the thin material of the amorphous loop core 1, the core is easily deformed when a stress is applied thereto. A stress strain worsens excitation characteristics of the amorphous material, and therefore it is necessary to prevent the deformation as much as possible.<br>
From the reason as depicted above/ the inner frame 6 is installed in the amorphous loop core 7 to prevent the deformation.<br>
However, the conventional amorphous transformer adopting the inner frame 6 of the first and second frame elements 3, 4 has disadvantages as follows.<br>
(a) The inner frame 6 is constituted of two parts, i.e., first and second frame elements 3 and 4, and the engagement parts 3a, 4a of the first and second frame elements 3, 4 are engaged with each other. That is, an additional process of blanking, press working, etc. is<br><br>
required for the engagement parts 3a, 4a.<br>
(b)	The coupling part 5 is increased in thickness<br>
than other parts, and therefore does not fit the coll 2.<br>
(c)	When the cut end parts 7a,  7b of the<br>
amorphous loop core 7 are passed through the holes lb, 2b<br>
of the coils 1, 2, the first frame element 3 is easy to<br>
detach from the coupling part 5 in the case of Fig. 6.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
r<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore to provide an amorphous transformer which is simplified in structure of an inner frame and reduced in cost.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an amorphous transformer having an inner frame in a structure fit to a coil.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide an amorphous transformer having an inner frame in a structure not detached when each cut end part of an amorphous loop core is passed through a hole of a coil.<br>
An improved amorphous transformer is provided according to the present invention, which is in such structure that coils are wound around leg parts of a rectangular amorphous loop core consisting of a pair of confronting leg parts and a pair of confronting yoke parts, and an inner frame is arranged along an inner periphery of a window part of the amorphous loop core to wholly surround<br><br>
the coils in the window part.<br>
In the amorphous transformer claimed in claim 1, the inner frame is formed in a one-piece structure of a yoke-faced part at the side of an inner face of one yoke part, leg-faced parts bent from both ends of the yoke-faced part to the same side to be coupled with each other at inner faces of the leg parts, and block parts forraed by bending front ends of the leg-faced parts in a direction to<br>
w<br>
face each other and engaged with end parts of confronting parts of the coils in the window part of the amorphous loop core.<br>
Since the inner frame is formed in a one-piece structure in the amorphous transformer of the present invention, the structure is simplified and costs are reduced as compared with the prior art.<br>
The inner frame has no coupling part which is larger in thickness than other parts, and therefore fits to the coils.<br>
Further, the inner frame is provided with block parts obtained by bending front ends of the leg-faced parts in a direction to face each other and, the block parts are engaged with end parts of confronting parts of the coils in the window part of the amorphous loop core. Therefore, cut end parts of the amorphous loop core are not detached when passed through holes of the coils.<br><br>
According to an amorphous transformer of claim 2, the yoke-faced part of the inner fi-ame is arranged at ^e side of the joint part of the amorphous loop core.<br>
When the yoke-faced part of the inner frame is at the side of the joint part of the amorphous loop core, even the inner frame in the one-piece structure with one end opened can effectively reinforce the joint part of the amorphous loop core by the yoke-faced part.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an amorphous fransformer comprising a rectangular amorphous loop core of a pair of confronting leg parts and a pair of confronting yoke parts, with coils being wound around said leg parts, an inner frame is arranged along an inner periphery of a window pat of said amorphous loop core to wholly surround said coils in the window part characterized in that said inner frame being a one-piece structure consisting of a yoke-faced part arranged at the side of an inner face of said one yoke part, leg faced parts bent from both ends of said yoke-faced part to the same side to be coupled with each other at the side of inner faces of said leg pats and block parts formed by bending front ends of said leg-faced parts in a direction to face each other and engaged with end parts of confronting parts of said coils in the window part of said amorphous loop core. .<br>

Fig. 6 is a longitudinal sectional view of the conventional amorphous transformer. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The  preferred  embodiments  of  the  present invention are described below with reference to the accompanying figures. Embodiment<br>
Figs. lA, IB and 2 indicate an embodiment of an amorphous transformer according to the present invention.<br>
In the amorphous transformer in the example, an inner frame 6 is constituted in one piece of a yoke-faced part 6a positioned at the side of an inner face of one yoke part 7g, leg-faced parts 6b, 6c bent from both ends of the part 6a to the same side to be connected with each other and positioned at the side of inner faces of leg parts 7d, 7e, and block parts 6d, 6e formed by bending front ends of the parts 6b, 6 c in a direction to face each other and engaged with end parts lat, 2at of confronting parts la, 2a of coils If 2 inside a window part 7h of an amorphous loop core 7. In this case, the yoke-faced part 6a of the inner frame is arranged at the side of a joint part 7c of the core 7. Although the inner frame 6 is formed of SPCC in the embodiment,  the inner frame 6 may be molded of<br><br>
synthetic resin.<br>
The inner frame 6 is fitted to the coils 1, 2 in a manner as will be discussed below with reference to Figs. 3A-3C.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 3A, the inner frame 6 is disposed at one side in an axial direction of the coils 1, 2 arranged in parallel, so that the block parts 6d, 6e face the holes lb, 2b of the coils 1, 2.<br>
In Fig. 3B, front ends of the block parts 6d, 6e of the leg-faced parts 6b, 6c of the inner frame 6 are opened and inserted into the corresponding holes lb, 2b of the coils 1, 2.<br>
After the front ends of the block parts 6d, 6e of the parts 6b, 6c are inserted in the holes lb, 2b of the coils 1, 2 and the block parts 6d, 6e are passed through the holes lb, 2b of the coils 1, 2, ends of the leg-faced parts 6b, 6c are automatically closed by the elasticity of the inner frame 6, whereby the block parts 6d, 6e are engaged with the end parts lat, 2at of the confronting parts la, 2a of the coils 1, 2 in the window part 7h of the amorphous loop core 7.  The inner frame is thus fixed.<br>
According to the amorphous transformer of claim 1, the inner frame is formed in the one-piece structure of the yoke-faced part at the side of the inner face of one yoke part, leg-faced parts bent from both ends of the yoke-<br><br>
faced part to the same side to be coupled with each other at the side of inner faces of the leg parts, and block parts formed by bending front ends of the leg-faced parts in a direction to face each other and engaged with end parts of confronting parts of the coils in the window part of the amorphous loop core. Because of the one-piece structure, the amorphous transformer of the present invention is simplified in structure and reduced in cost as compared with the prior art. The inner frame has no coupling part which is larger in thickness than other parts, and therefore fits to the coils. Further, the inner frame is provided with block parts obtained by bending front ends of the leg-faced parts in a direction to face each other and, the block parts are engaged with end parts of confronting parts of the coils in the window part of the amorphous loop core. Therefore, it is advantageous that cut end parts of the amorphous loop core are not detached when passed through holes of the coils.<br>
According to the amorphous transformer of claim 2, the yoke-faced part of the inner frame is arranged at the side of the joint part of the amorphous loop core. Therefore, even the inner frame in the one-piece structure with one end opened can effectively reinforce the joint part of the amorphous loop core by the yoke-faced part.<br>
The invention being thus described, it will be<br><br>
obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br><br>
