				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS TO MONITOR A FLOW MANAGEMENT<br>
VALVE OF AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention relates to control systems for electro-mechanical<br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output. One exemplary<br>
transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, for example an internal combustion engine, and<br>
an output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to a<br>
vehicle driveline. Electric machines, operable as motors or generators,<br>
generate a torque input to the transmission, independently of a torque input<br>
from the internal combustion engine. The electric machines may transform<br>
vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical<br>
energy potential that is storable in the electrical energy storage device. A<br>
control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and<br>
provides operational control of the powertrain system, including controlling<br>
transmission gear shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and<br>
 <br>
regulating the electrical power interchange between the electrical energy<br>
storage device and the electric machines.<br>
[0004] The exemplary electro-mechanical transmission is selectively<br>
operative in a low range and a high range, which are descriptive of relative<br>
input/output speed ratios between the torque-generative devices and the<br>
output, i.e., the driveline. The low range and high range both preferably<br>
include continuously variable operation and fixed gear operation, the operation<br>
being controlled through selective application and release of torque-transfer<br>
clutches, via a hydraulic circuit. Fixed gear operation occurs when rotational<br>
speed of the transmission output member is a fixed ratio of rotational speed of<br>
the input member from the engine, due to application and release states of one<br>
or more torque transfer clutches. Continuously variable operation occurs<br>
when rotational speed of the transmission output member is variable based<br>
upon operating speeds of one or more of the electric machines.<br>
[0005] The transmission is controlled in either the low range or the high<br>
range using a flow management valve, which transitions between a first<br>
position and second position in response to a command to shift operation to<br>
the low or high range. Anomalous operation in the hydraulic circuit or the<br>
flow management valve which results in the valve not transitioning can affect<br>
transmission operation, including a potential unintended application or release<br>
of one of the clutches.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A multi-range electro-mechanical transmission includes a flow<br>
management valve having a first position enabling a first range and a second<br>
 <br>
position enabling a second range. The flow management valve to transition<br>
from the first position to the second position and an output of a pressure<br>
monitoring device adapted to monitor the flow management valve is<br>
monitored. Proper operation of the flow management valve is determined<br>
when the output of the pressure monitoring device detects the transition within<br>
a predetermined period of time. A fault in the flow management valve is<br>
detected when no transition is detected in the output of the pressure<br>
monitoring device within the predetermined period of time.<br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an<br>
engine 14, transmission 10 including electric machines 56 and 72, a control<br>
system, and hydraulic control circuit 42. The exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system is configured to execute the control scheme depicted hereinbelow with<br>
reference to Fig. 5. Mechanical aspects of the exemplary transmission 10 are<br>
disclosed in detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409. The<br>
exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission<br>
embodying the concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1. The<br>
transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12 having an input speed, Nithat is<br>
preferably driven by the internal combustion engine 14, and an output shaft 64<br>
having an output rotational speed, No.<br>
[0014] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission via shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or a<br>
compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 has a crankshaft having<br>
characteristic speed NE which is operatively connected to the transmission<br>
input shaft 12. The output of the engine, comprising speed NE and output<br>
torque TE can differ from transmission input speed NI and input torque TI when<br>
a torque management device (not shown) is placed therebetween.<br>
[0015] The transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and<br>
28, and four torque-transmitting devices, i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
and C4 75. An electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by<br>
 <br>
transmission control module (TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states.<br>
Clutches C2 62 and C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-actuated rotating<br>
friction clutches. Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise<br>
hydraulically-applied 56 stationary devices grounded to the transmission case<br>
68. Each clutch is preferably hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid from a pump via the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0016] The first and second electric machines 56, 72 preferably comprise<br>
three-phase AC motor/generator devices, referred to as MG-A 56 and MG-B<br>
72, which are operatively connected to the transmission via the planetary<br>
gears. Each of the electric machines includes a stator, a rotor, and a resolver<br>
assembly 80, 82. The motor stator for each machine is grounded to outer<br>
transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings<br>
extending therefrom. The rotor for MG-A 56 is supported on a hub plate gear<br>
that is operably attached to an output shaft via carrier 26. The rotor for MG-B<br>
72 is attached to a sleeve shaft hub. The motor resolver assemblies 80, 82 are<br>
appropriately positioned and assembled on MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. Each<br>
resolver assembly 80, 82 may be a well known variable reluctance device<br>
including a resolver stator, operably connected to the stator for each machine,<br>
and a resolver rotor, operably connected to the rotor for each machine<br>
described above. Each resolver 80, 82 comprises a sensing device adapted to<br>
sense rotational position of the resolver stator relative to the resolver rotor, and<br>
identify the rotational position. Signals output from the resolvers are<br>
interpreted to provide rotational speeds for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, referred<br>
to as NA and NB. Transmission output shaft 64 is operably connected to a<br>
vehicle driveline 90 to provide an output torque, To to vehicle wheels. There<br>
 <br>
is a transmission output speed sensor 84 adapted to monitor rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output shaft 64. Each of the vehicle wheels is<br>
preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed, the<br>
output of which is monitored by one of the control modules of the control<br>
system to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds for<br>
braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0017] The transmission 10 receives the engine input torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, as a<br>
result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device ('ESD') 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to a transmission power inverter module ('TPIM') 19 via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27.<br>
[0018] The TPIM 19 includes power inverters and two motor control<br>
modules, and is an element of the control system described hereinafter with<br>
regard to Fig. 2. The first motor control module transmits electrical energy to<br>
and from MG-A 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the second motor control<br>
module similarly transmits electrical energy to and from MG-B 72 by transfer<br>
conductors 31. Electrical current is transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in<br>
accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. The<br>
motor control modules receive motor control commands and control inverter<br>
states therefrom to provide motor drive or regeneration functionality. The<br>
inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics<br>
devices. The inverters comprise controlled insulated gate bipolar transistors<br>
(IGBT) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC power for powering<br>
one of the electrical machines MG-A 56, MG-B 72, by switching at high<br>
 <br>
frequencies. There is typically one pair of IGBTs for each phase of the three-<br>
phase electric machines, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72.<br>
[0019] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the exemplary<br>
control system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is<br>
shown. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system<br>
control of the powertrain system described herein. The control system is<br>
operable to synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control targets, including<br>
such parameters as fuel economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A 56 and MG-<br>
B 72. The distributed control module architecture includes engine control<br>
module ('ECM') 23, transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack<br>
control module ('BPCM') 21, and TPIM 19. A hybrid control module<br>
('HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of the<br>
aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface ('UP) 13 operably<br>
connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator typically<br>
controls or directs operation of the powertrain including the transmission 10.<br>
The devices include an operator torque request ('TO_REQ') operator brake<br>
('BRAKE'), a transmission gear selector, and a vehicle speed cruise control.<br>
[0020] Each of the aforementioned control modules communicates with<br>
other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN')<br>
bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of control<br>
parameters and commands between the various control modules. The specific<br>
communication protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and<br>
 <br>
appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module<br>
interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and other control<br>
modules providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and<br>
vehicle stability.<br>
[0021] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: the operator torque request output to driveline 90, the<br>
engine input torque TI, clutch torque ('TCL_N') for the N various torque-transfer<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10; and motor torques<br>
TAand TBfor MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The TCM 17 is operatively connected<br>
to the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, including monitoring various<br>
pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and executing control<br>
signals for various solenoids to control pressure switches and control valves<br>
contained therein.<br>
[0022] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine input torque, T1, to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. Various other parameters that may be sensed by<br>
ECM 23 include engine coolant temperature and engine input speed, NE, to<br>
shaft 12, manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure.<br>
 <br>
Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors,<br>
ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0023] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques (TCL_N) for each of the N clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62,<br>
C3 73, and C4 75, and rotational output speed, No, of the output shaft 64.<br>
Other actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional information<br>
from the TCM to the HCP for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs<br>
from hydraulic pressure switch devices PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 which are<br>
depicted with reference to Fig. 3. The TCM 17 selectively actuates and<br>
controls pressure control solenoids and flow management valves to apply and<br>
release various clutches to control the transmission to specific operating<br>
ranges and operating range states.<br>
[0024] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, amp-hour throughput, battery voltage and<br>
available battery power.<br>
[002S] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory ('ROM'),<br>
random access memory ('RAM'), electrically programmable read only<br>
memory ('EPROM'), high speed clock, analog to digital ('A/D') and digital to<br>
analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices ('I/O') and<br>
 <br>
appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has<br>
a set of control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and<br>
calibrations stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of<br>
each computer. Information transfer between the various computers is<br>
preferably accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0026] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing<br>
engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in<br>
response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Fig. 3, the exemplary two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission operates in one of several operating range<br>
states comprising fixed gear operation and continuously variable operation,<br>
described with reference to Table 1, below.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0028] The various transmission operating range states described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 are applied<br>
for each of the operating range states. A first mode, i.e., Mode I, is selected<br>
when clutch C1 70 only is applied in order to "ground" the outer gear member<br>
of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine 14 can be either on or off. A<br>
second mode, i.e., Mode II, is selected when clutch C2 62 only is applied to<br>
connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. Again, the<br>
engine 14 can be either on or off. For purposes of this description, Engine Off<br>
is defined by engine input speed, NE, being equal to zero revolutions per<br>
minute ('RPM), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. Other factors<br>
outside the scope of the invention affect when the electric machines 56,72<br>
operate as motors and generators, and are not discussed herein.<br>
[0029] Modes I and II refer to circumstances in which the transmission<br>
functions are controlled by one applied clutch, i.e., either clutch C1 62 or C2<br>
70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electric machines MG-A 56<br>
 <br>
and MG-B 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
fixed gear ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be the unapplied one of clutch C1 70 or clutch C2 62 or clutch C3<br>
73 or C4 75, as depicted in Table 1, above. When the additional clutch is<br>
applied, fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed of the transmission, i.e.,<br>
NI/No, is achieved. The rotations of machines MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, i.e.,<br>
NAand NB, are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by<br>
the clutching and proportional to the input speed measured at shaft 12.<br>
[0030] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the HCP<br>
control 5 and one or more of the other control modules determine the operator<br>
torque request to be executed at shaft 64. Final vehicle acceleration is<br>
affected by other factors, including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle<br>
mass. The operating mode is determined for the exemplary transmission<br>
based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This<br>
includes an operator demand for torque, typically communicated through<br>
inputs to the UI 13 as previously described. Additionally, a demand for output<br>
torque is predicated on external conditions, including, e.g., road grade, road<br>
surface conditions, or wind load. The operating mode may be predicated on a<br>
powertrain torque demand caused by a control module command to operate of<br>
the electric machines in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque<br>
generating mode. The operating mode can be determined by an optimization<br>
algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum system efficiency based<br>
upon operator demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy<br>
efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The control system<br>
<br>
 <br>
manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based<br>
upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system<br>
optimization occurs to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy<br>
and manage battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be controlled based<br>
upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric<br>
states of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the<br>
transmission required to arrive at the desired torque output, as described<br>
hereinbelow. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates<br>
over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator<br>
demand.<br>
[0031] As should be apparent from the description above, the energy storage<br>
system and electric machines MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are electrically-<br>
operatively coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine,<br>
the electric machines, and the electro-mechanical transmission are<br>
mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power therebetween to generate<br>
a power flow to the output. In Mode I operation, the transmission operates as<br>
an input-split EVT. In Mode II operation, the transmission operates as a<br>
compound-split EVT. While operating in either of these two modes, the<br>
control system performs closed loop control on an engine speed which<br>
optimizes fuel economy while still meeting the torque request and given<br>
power constraints. It then commands motor speeds to vary the input-to-output<br>
speed ratio to accelerate the vehicle, in response to the operator torque request.<br>
Through use of the two additional clutches, the transmission also has the<br>
capability of achieving one of four fixed gear ratios. While operating in a<br>
<br>
 <br>
fixed gear, the vehicle acts as a parallel hybrid and the motors are used only<br>
for boosting and braking/regeneration the vehicle.<br>
[0032] Referring to Fig. 4, a schematic diagram providing a more detailed<br>
description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic system for controlling flow of<br>
hydraulic fluid in the exemplary transmission is shown. A main hydraulic<br>
pump 88, driven off the input shaft 12 from the engine 14, and an auxiliary<br>
pump 110, operatively electrically controlled by the TPIM 19, provide<br>
pressurized fluid to the hydraulic control circuit 42 through valve 140. The<br>
auxiliary pump 110 preferably comprises an electrically-powered pump of an<br>
appropriate size and capacity to provide sufficient flow of pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic system when operational. Pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid flows into hydraulic control circuit 42, which is operable to<br>
selectively distribute hydraulic pressure to a series of devices, including the<br>
torque transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, active cooling<br>
circuits for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, and a base cooling circuit for cooling and<br>
lubricating the transmission 10 via passages 142,144, including flow<br>
restrictors 148, 146 (not depicted in detail). As previously stated, the TCM 17<br>
controls the various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes<br>
through selective control of pressure control solenoids ('PCS') PCS1 108,<br>
PCS2 112, PCS3 114, PCS4 116 and solenoid-controlled flow management<br>
valves X-valve 119 and Y-valve 121. The circuit is fluidly connected to<br>
pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4 via passages 124, 122, 126, and<br>
128, respectively. There is an inlet spool valve 107. The pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS1 108 has a control position of normally high and is operative to<br>
modulate magnitude of fluidic pressure in the hydraulic circuit through fluidic<br>
<br>
 <br>
interaction with controllable pressure regulator 109. Controllable pressure<br>
regulator 109, not shown in detail, interacts with PCS1 108 to control<br>
hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic circuit 42 over a range of pressures,<br>
depending upon operating conditions as described hereinafter. Pressure<br>
control solenoid PCS2 112 has a control position of normally low, and is<br>
fluidly connected to spool valve 113 and operative to effect flow therethrough<br>
when actuated. Spool valve 113 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS3<br>
via passage 126. Pressure control solenoid PCS3 114 has a control position of<br>
normally low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 115 and operative to<br>
effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 115 is fluidly connected<br>
to pressure switch PS1 via passage 124. Pressure control solenoid PCS4 116<br>
has a control position of normally low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve<br>
117 and operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 117<br>
is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS4 via passage 128.<br>
[0033] The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 each comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by solenoids 118,120, respectively, in the exemplary<br>
system, and have control states of High (T) and Low ('0'). The control states<br>
refer to positions of each valve with which to control flow to different devices<br>
in the hydraulic circuit 42 and the transmission 10. The X-valve 119 is<br>
operative to direct pressurized fluid to clutches C3 73 and C4 75 and cooling<br>
systems for stators of MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 via fluidic passages 136, 138,<br>
144, 142 respectively, depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is<br>
described hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is operative to direct pressurized fluid<br>
to clutches Cl 70 and C2 62 via fluidic passages 132 and 134 respectively,<br>
<br>
 <br>
depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter.<br>
The Y-valve 121 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS2 via passage 122.<br>
[0034] An exemplary logic table to accomplish control of the exemplary<br>
electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is provided with reference to Table 2,<br>
below.<br>
 <br>
[0035] Selective control of the X-valve 119 and Y-valve 121 and actuation<br>
of the solenoids PCS2 112, PCS3 114, and PCS4 116 facilitate flow of<br>
hydraulic fluid to selectively apply clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 and<br>
provide cooling for the stators of MG-A 56 and MG-B 72.<br>
 <br>
[0036] The X-valve 119 controls operation in one of either the fixed gear or<br>
continuously variable operating range states, depending upon the operating<br>
position.<br>
[0037] The Y-valve 121 controls operation of the transmission in one of the<br>
Low Range or the High Range, depending upon the operating position. Thus,<br>
in the Low Range, the Y-valve 121 is in the low position, or '0', and the<br>
transmission is selectively operative in Mode I, first gear (FG1) and second<br>
gear (FG2), depending upon the actuation of the clutch solenoids. In the High<br>
Range, the Y-valve 121 is in the high position, or' 1', and the transmission is<br>
selectively operative in Mode II, third gear (FG3) and fourth gear (FG4),<br>
depending upon the actuation of the clutch solenoids. As depicted with<br>
reference to Fig. 3, operation of the transmission in the low range results in a<br>
relatively low output speed, No, in relation to input speed, NI, and operation of<br>
the transmission in the high range results in a relatively high output speed, No,<br>
in relation to input speed, NI. A transition in the position of the Y-valve 121<br>
changes the transmission output between the Low Range and the High Range,<br>
the change depending upon the direction of the transition.<br>
[0038] In operation, an operating mode, i.e., one of the fixed gear and<br>
continuously variable operating range states, is determined for the exemplary<br>
transmission based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the<br>
powertrain. This includes an operator torque request, typically communicated<br>
through inputs to the UI 13 as previously described. Additionally, a demand<br>
for output torque is predicated on external conditions, including, e.g., road<br>
grade, road surface conditions, or wind load. The operating mode may be<br>
predicated on a powertrain torque demand caused by a control module<br>
<br>
 <br>
command to operate of the electric machines in an electrical energy generating<br>
mode or in a torque generating mode. The operating mode can be determined<br>
by an optimization algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum<br>
system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery state of<br>
charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72.<br>
The control system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A 56<br>
and MG-B 72 based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine,<br>
and system optimization occurs to optimize system efficiencies to improve<br>
fuel economy and manage battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be<br>
controlled based upon a fault in a component or system.<br>
[0039] Referring now to the transmission described with reference to Figs. 1<br>
through 4, and Tables 1 and 2, specific aspects of the transmission and control<br>
system are described herein. The control system selectively actuates the<br>
pressure control devices and the flow management valves based upon a<br>
demand for torque, presence of a fault, and temperatures of the electric<br>
motors. The control system selectively commands one of the operating range<br>
states, in either the low range or the high range, by selective actuating the Y-<br>
valve 121 flow management valve to low ('0') state or to high (' 1') state.<br>
Other operation can be commanded and controlled, including actuation of the<br>
stator cooling system for the electric machines and actuation of the clutches<br>
C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 based upon selective actuation of the pressure<br>
control devices.<br>
[0040] As previously stated, fluid output from each of the second, third and<br>
fourth pressure control devices (i.e., PCS2 112, PCS3 114, and PCS4 116) is<br>
selectively mapped to one of the four hydraulically-actuated clutches and<br>
<br>
 <br>
stator cooling systems for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based upon commanded<br>
positions of the first and second flow management valves. Therefore,<br>
selective actuation of PCS2 112 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide<br>
cooling to the stator of MG-B 72, when both the X-valve 119 and the Y-valve<br>
121 are commanded to Low. Selective actuation of PCS2 112 effects flow of<br>
hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C2 62 when either of the X-valve 119 and the<br>
Y-valve 121 are commanded to High. Selective actuation of PCS3 114 effects<br>
flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C1 70 when both the X-valve 119 and<br>
the Y-valve 121 are commanded to Low. Selective actuation of PCS3 114<br>
effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of MG-B 72<br>
when the X-valve 119 is commanded to Low and the Y-valve 121 is<br>
commanded to High. Selective actuation of PCS3 114 effects flow of<br>
hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C1 70 when the X-valve 119 is commanded to<br>
High and the Y-valve 121 is commanded to Low. Selective actuation of PCS3<br>
114 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C3 73 when both the X-<br>
valve 119 and the Y-valve 121 are commanded to High. Selective actuation of<br>
PCS4 116 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to provide cooling to the stator of<br>
MG-A 56 when the X-valve 119 is commanded to Low, regardless of the<br>
position to which the Y-valve 121 is commanded. Selective actuation of<br>
PCS4 116 effects flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutch C4 75 when the X-<br>
valve 119 is commanded to High, regardless of the position to which the Y-<br>
valve 121 is commanded.<br>
[0041] Referring now to the flowchart 500 depicted in Fig. 5, with reference<br>
to the exemplary transmission 10 described with reference to Figs. 1 through<br>
4, and Tables 1 and 2, controlling and monitoring operation of the Y-valve<br>
<br>
 <br>
121 is described. The Y-valve 121 flow management valve is operative to<br>
control the transmission in one of the low range and the high range. The<br>
operation includes commanding the flow management valve to transition from<br>
a first position to a second position, and monitoring an output of one of the<br>
pressure monitoring devices, specifically PS2. Proper operation of the Y-<br>
valve 121 is detected when the output of the monitored pressure monitoring<br>
device detects a corresponding transition in fluidic pressure within a<br>
predetermined period of time after the commanded transition. A fault is<br>
detected when no transition is detected in the output of the pressure<br>
monitoring device within the predetermined period of time subsequent thereto.<br>
[0042] Monitoring the Y-valve 121 preferably comprises executing one or<br>
more algorithms in the control modules during ongoing operation. Operation<br>
of the transmission is monitored, including hydraulic pressures in the<br>
hydraulic circuit. During ongoing operation, the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission is commanded by one of the control modules to shift operation<br>
between the low range operation and the high range operation, through<br>
positional control of the Y-valve 121 (Step 502). Output of pressure switch<br>
PS2 is monitored (Step 504), to detect a change in the output within an elapsed<br>
period of time after the commanded change in position of the Y-valve 121.<br>
The period of time is dependent upon factors related to response times,<br>
including, e.g., ambient temperature, transmission operating time, and<br>
transmission fluid temperature. When there is a change in output of PS2<br>
corresponding to the commanded change in position of the Y-valve 121 within<br>
the elapsed period of time, then it is presumed that the Y-valve 121 is<br>
functioning properly (Step 506), and the transmission is commanded to<br>
<br>
 <br>
operate normally (Step 507). When the output of PS2 does not correspond to<br>
the commanded change in position of the Y-valve 121 within the elapsed<br>
period of time, then a fault in the Y-valve 121 is determined (Step 508). The<br>
Y-valve 121 fault is identified as either a Stuck-High fault (Step 510), or a<br>
Stuck-Low fault (Step 520), depending upon whether the commanded change<br>
in operation is from High to Low, or from Low to High, respectively.<br>
[0043] When the Y-valve 121 fault is identified as the Stuck-High fault (Step<br>
510), operation of the transmission is limited, including specifically inhibiting<br>
actuation of PCS2 112 to prevent inadvertent and unintended actuation of<br>
clutch C2 62, and specifically inhibiting actuation of PC S3 114 to prevent<br>
inadvertent and unintended actuation of clutch C1 70 and operation in a fixed<br>
gear, i.e., FG1, when operation in continuously variable mode is commanded,<br>
and prevent operation in FG2 (clutches C1 70 and C2 62 actuated) when FG4<br>
operation (clutches C2 62 and C3 73 actuated) is commanded. Thus, cooling<br>
of the stator of MG-B 72 is inhibited in this operation (Step 512). A retest<br>
command is subsequently executed, wherein the valve is commanded to low<br>
position and output of PS2 is monitored, to determine whether the output of<br>
PS2 transitions to low position (Step 514). The retest command is preferably<br>
executed repetitively during ongoing operation to attempt to force the spool<br>
valve to become unstuck. A fault is identified when the output of PS2 does<br>
not transition to the low position. When a fault continues being detected for a<br>
predetermined quantity of iterations of the test during ongoing operation, or<br>
during retests occurring during successive operations of the vehicle (Step<br>
516), a fault code is set in the control module, and the vehicle operator is<br>
notified by illuminating a malfunction indicator lamp ('MIL') (Step 518).<br>
<br>
 <br>
When the outcome of a retest of the Y-valve 121 indicates that the fault is no<br>
longer occurring, i.e., the output of PS2 transitions to the low position when<br>
the Y-valve 121 is commanded low, the control module commands the system<br>
to resume normal operation (Step 530), which includes discontinuing the<br>
limited operation previously described.<br>
[0044] When the Y-valve 121 fault is identified as the Stuck-Low fault (Step<br>
520), operation of the transmission is limited, including specifically inhibiting<br>
actuation of PC S3 114 to prevent inadvertent actuation of clutch C1 70 and<br>
operation in low range when operation in the high range is intended. This<br>
includes specifically inhibiting actuation of PCS4 116 to prevent inadvertent<br>
or unintended actuation of clutch C4 75 and to prevent operation in one of the<br>
fixed gears, i.e., FG4, when continuously variable mode operation is<br>
commanded. Thus, cooling of the stator of MG-A 56 is inhibited in this<br>
operation (Step 522). A retest command is subsequently executed, wherein<br>
the valve is commanded to high position and output of PS2 is monitored, to<br>
determine whether the output of PS2 transitions to high position (Step 524).<br>
Again, the retest command is preferably executed repetitively during ongoing<br>
operation to attempt to force the spool valve to become unstuck. A fault is<br>
identified when the output of PS2 does not transition to the high position.<br>
When a fault continues being detected for a predetermined quantity of<br>
iterations of the test during ongoing operation, or during tests occurring during<br>
successive operations of the vehicle (Step 526), a fault code is set in the<br>
control module, and the vehicle operator is notified by illuminating the<br>
malfunction indicator lamp ('MIL') (Step 528). When the outcome of a<br>
subsequent one of the retests of the Y-valve 121 indicates that the fault is no<br>
<br>
 <br>
longer occurring, i.e., the output of PS2 transitions to the high position when<br>
the Y-valve 121 is commanded high, the control module commands the<br>
system to resume normal operation (Step 530), which includes discontinuing<br>
the limited operation.<br>
