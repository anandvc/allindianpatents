				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cartridge shell and a corresponding cartridge for blast holes for the purpose of fracturing hard materials. The invention further relates to a method of use of such a cartridge and in particular a method of charging blast holes with the cartridge.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A typical cartridge shell for a blast hole is in the form of a cylindrical tube closed at both ends. Some cartridges may contain only an energetic substance while others may contain both an energetic substance and an initiator. The cartridge will be inserted to reside near the toe of a blast hole drilled or otherwise formed in a rock or other hard material to be fractured. The hole may then be stemmed with a particulate stemming material. When the energetic material in the cartridge is initiated there is a rapid generation of gas and thus a rapid build up of gas pressure near the toe of the hole. Provided that the gas generated is contained for a short period of time the resulting gas pressure may cause fractures to be propagated from the hole through the hard material.<br>
The efficiency and effectiveness of this process is largely determined by factors such as the provision and quality of a gas seal formed on the side of the cartridge nearest the collar of the blast hole and the ability to hold the seal in position. Clearly if the seal is poor, gas will escape around the seal thereby reducing gas pressure as well as the rate of gas pressure increase. Further, the escaping gas has adverse effects in terms of ejecting stemming from the blast hole, generation of recoil and producing flyrock. However, even if the seal is one of high integrity, if the seal is not held firmly hi place and is able to be pushed back toward the collar of the hole then the physical volume of the confined space within the hole in which the gas acts increases, thereby decreasing the gas pressure.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Figures 1-5 depict a first embodiment of the cartridge shell 10. The cartridge shell comprises a main body 12 defining a volume 14 for holding an energetic material (not shown). The main body 12 has a first end 16 and an opposite second end 18. The first end 16 is generally planar and in effect forms a planar base for the shell 10. The second end 18 however is tapered to form a point or wedge-like member 20.<br>
The tapering of the second end 18 is configured so that an area of the second end 18 measured in a plane transverse to a longitudinal axis of the main body 12 reduces in a direction to the first end 16 to the second end 18. Thus, with reference to Figures 4 and 5. the area of the second end 18 in plane P2 is reduced in comparison to the area measured in plane P,.<br>
The second end 18 can take one of a number of different specific shapes. In Figures 1, 4 and 5 it is seen that the second 18 is in the form of two inclined surfaces 22 and 24 thai converge toward each other. However, in an alternate embodiment the second end 18 car.<br>
be in the form of a conical frustum. This is depicted in Figures 6 and 7 which illustrate a transverse section of the second end 18 through planes P1 and P2 respectively. In yet a further embodiment depicted in Figure 8, the second end 18 is in the form of a chisel point. Of course other shapes are possible such as, but not limited to, three, four or five sided prisms.<br>
Ideally the main body 12 and the second end 18 would be formed integrally and from a plastics material. However it is possible for the second end 18 to be made separately from the main body 12 and if so, the two components can then be attached together. The main body 12 will conveniently be in the form of a cylindrical tube as depicted in Figure 3 showing section A-A of Figure 1.<br>
Main body 12 has an opening 26 at the first end to allow filling of the shell 10 with an energetic material. A closure in the form of a cap 28 is provided for insertion into and closure of the opening 26.  The cap 28 is press/interference fitted into the opening 26. This forms a line or zone of weakness at the first end 16:<br>
An aperture 30 is formed centrally through the cap 28 to allow an initiator such as an electric match 32 (see Figure 9) to be pushed into the main body 12. A lead 34 from the match 32 passes through aperture 30 for coupling with an electric power source.<br>
In an alternate embodiment depicted in Figure 10 the outer surface 36 of the shell 10 near the first end 16 is provided with a recess 38 for seating the initiator lead 34. The recess includes a first length 40 provided on the main body 12 and a second length 42 provided in the cap 28. The cap 28 is orientated when inserted into the main body 12 so that the lengths 40 and 42 of the recess 38 are in alignment. When the electric match 32 is inserted through the aperture 30 the lead 34 can be seated in the recess 38 to provide it with some protection from accidental damage or cutting when the shell 10 is inserted into a blast hole. In a further variation the length 40 of the recess 38 can be extended along the main body 12 to at least a point where the wedge-like member 20 commences.<br>
In a further variation depicted in Figure 11, the aperture 30 is placed in the point or wedge-<br>
like member 20 rather than in cap 28. In this embodiment the shell 10 can also be provided with an internal passageway 35 through which the lead 34 passes to deposit the initiator 32 near the first end 16 inside the main body 12.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates one method of use of the shell 10. The volume 14 of the shell 10 is filled with an energetic substance such as a propellant to form a cartridge l0c. The cartridge l0c is inserted into a blast hole 46 formed in hard material 47 with first end 16 first so that the first end 16 is adjacent a toe 48 of the hole. Accordingly the second end 18 faces or is directed toward a collar 50 of the hole. Next, a quantity of paniculate stemming material 52 is placed in the hole 46. Typically this will be done by blowing. The stemming material 52 is blown into the hole 46 to a level below the free face 54 of the hard material 47 in which the hole 46 is formed. The stemming 52 is then mechanically held in the hole 46.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 12 the mechanical holding is achieved by inserting a stemming bar 56 into the hole 46 so that one end 58-.of the stemming bar rests on the stemming 52 and an opposite end 60 of the stemming bar extends from the free face 54. A cup 62 is placed over and cradles end 60. An opposite side of the cup 64 is formed with a planar base and supports an acrow prop 66. The acrow prop 66 is extended in length or otherwise jacked so that its opposite end 68 abuts a wall 69 disposed opposite the free face 54.<br>
By connecting lead 34 with an electrical power source, the initiator 32 generates a high temperature flame to initiate the propellant or other energetic material within the cartridge lOc. The gas generated upon initiation initially bursts through the main body 12 about the line of weakness formed by the coupling of the cap 28 to the main body 12. The increase in gas pressure can tend to force the cartridge lOc toward the collar 50 of the hole 46. As this occurs, the point or wedge-like member 20 acts on the stemming 52 to increase the radial compressive forge on the stemming material in an annular-Iike region between the peripheral of the second end 18 and the adjacent portiongf the surface of hole 46 thereby increasing the sealing effect of the stemming material 52. The stemming material 52 is prevented from blowing out of the hole 46 by action of the mechanical retention provided<br>
by the stemming bar 56 and acrow prop 66.<br>
The sealing effect of the stemming material 52 is enhanced by forming the stemming material 52 from a mixture of a dry binding agent, fines, and coarse material. It has been found that fly ash is a particularly beneficial binding agent and the mixture containing fly ash has a tendency to set when blown under pressure into the hole 46. The binding agent and fines comprises participate solids of mesh size less than about 1mm. The coarse material within the stemming aggregate contains particles of mesh size up to about 6mm. Binding agents other than fly ash can be used in the stemming material such as waste products from smelters, or fines containing cementitious material.<br>
In an alternate method for stemming the hole 46, after the cartridge l0c has been inserted into the hole a volume of a liquid or gel 70 is inserted into the hole 46 to fill any space between the outer surface of the cartridge l0c and the surface of the hole 46 and provide a liquid or gel layer 72 between the particulate stemming material 52 and the cartridge l0c. The gel 70 assists in sealing the hole 46 to prevent the escape of gases upon initiation of the energetic material held within the cartridge l0c. In all other respects, the method depicted in Figure 13 is the same as that depicted in Figure 12.<br>
The use of the stemming material 52 either by itself or in conjunction with the liquid/gel 70 provides a seal of high integrity that substantially limits the escape of gas. The mechanical retention of the stemming by use, in these embodiments, of the stemming bar 56 and the acrow prop 66 prevents the stemming 52 being displaced toward the collar of the hole 50 thus maintaining relative constant the volume of the hole 46 within which the gas operates.<br>
Figures 14 and 15 depict a shell 10' and corresponding cartridge l00c in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention. The cartridge l00c is in effect a stackable cartridge comprising a shell 10 in substantial accordance with that depicted in Figure 1, although with a body 12 of shorter length, and two secondary cartridges 102a and 102b (hereinafter referred to in general as "secondary cartridges 102"). Different embodiments<br>
of the cartridge l00c can include either a single secondary cartridge 102 or more than two secondary cartridges 102. The shell 10, when containing energetic material constitutes primary cartridge l0c.<br>
Each secondary cartridge 102 contains a quantity of energetic material (not shown) and is formed so as to be connectable in an end to end fashion with the first end 16 of the main body 12 and with each other. In this way, the total quantity of energetic material contained by the cartridge lOOc can be varied by connecting one or more secondary cartridges 102 to the main body 12. This has substantial ramifications in terms of transportation and storage of energetic materials. For example, by forming the body 12 and the secondary cartridges 102 to contain no more than 10 gm of energetic material, a 50 gm cartridge can be constructed by connecting together a single body 12 and four secondary cartridges 102. However the individual body 12 and cartridges 102 can be transported separately as "10 gm cartridges" potentially under less stringent requirements than a single 50 gm cartridge under the UN Safety Classification regarding the transportation of such goods.<br>
Each secondary cartridge 102 has a first engaging means 104 at one end and a second complimentary engaging means 106 at a second opposite end. This enables the first engaging means of one secondary cartridge (e.g. engaging means 104 of secondary cartridge 102b) to engage with the second engaging means of an adjacent secondary cartridge (e.g. second engaging means 106 of booster cartridge 102a).<br>
Each secondary cartridge 102 has an outer shell 108 which includes a substantially cylindrical body 110 with the first engaging means 104 being in the form of an axial extension 112 at the first end of the cartridge 102. The extension 112 is formed with an outer diameter less than the outer diameter of the cylindrical body 110. The second engaging means 106 is in the form of a recess 114 formed at an opposite end of the cylindrical body 110.<br>
The outer surface of the axial extension 112 is circumscribed by two axially spaced protrusions 116. The protrusions 116 have a saw tooth like profile, as can be seen most<br>
clearly in Figure 15.<br>
The inside surface of each recess 114 is likewise circumscribed by two axially spaced-apart ridges or ribs 118.<br>
As is further apparent from Figure 15, the inner diameter of the recess 114 is greater than the inner diameter of the cylindrical body portion 110 of the shell 108 creating an annular seat 120 therebetween. The recess 114 is created by inserting a closure disc 322 into the end of the shell 108 to sit against the annular seat 120. A further ridge or rib 124 is formed about the inside surface of the recess 114 at locations spaced from the annular seat 120 by a distance approximately equal to the thickness of the periphery of the disc 122. Further, the ridge 124 and disc 122 are dimensionally related so that the ridge 124 sits behind the disc 122 and effectively holds the disc 124 against the seat 120. The disc 122 is made from a combustible material such as plastics, paper or cardboard.<br>
When assembling the cartridge l00c, the shells 108 are held in a vertical disposition with axial extension 112 down, and energetic material poured in through recess 114 to maximum level up to the annular seat 120. The closure disc 122 is then inserted past ridges 118 and 124 to be held against the annular seat 120.<br>
To connect two secondary cartridges 102 together, the axial extension 112 of one cartridge is pushed into the recess 124 of an adjacent cartridge. During this process, the protrusions 112 click past the ridges 118 until the forward end of the extension bears against the disc 120. In this position, the ridges 118 are effectively seated with a snap fit behind respective protrusions 116. The end most second cartridge 102b of the cartridge 1 OOc is closed with an end cap 28 identical to that described in relation to Figures 1 and 10.<br>
A passageway, such as a longitudinal groove 126, is formed along the outside surface of<br>
cartridge lOOc/shell 10 having a separate length on each of shell 10 and shells 108 of<br>
cartridges 102a and 102b. The groove 126 seats initiator lead 34 provided with an initiator,<br>
such as an electric match 32, which is inserted into the end cap 28. Prior to the insertion of<br>
the end cap 28, a hole is pierced through the disc 122	<br>
in cartridge 102b through which the match 32 can be inserted.<br>
In order to assist in the alignment of the separate lengths of groove 126 on both the shell 10 and shells 108, the outside surface of each extension 112 and the inside surface of each recess 114 is provided with a flat. The flat is depicted as item 128 on the axial extensions 112 in Figure 14. Corresponding flats (not shown) are provided on the inside surface of each recess 114.<br>
In order to allow insertion of the closure disc 122 into the recess 114, the disc 122 is also provided with a flat 130.<br>
To facilitate coupling of the primary cartridge l0c with the booster cartridge 102a, shell 10 is also modified in comparison to that depicted in Figure 1 by the incorporation of a recess 114 to receive the extension 112 of secondary cartridge 102a. The recess 114 in the primary cartridge l0c is of the same form and configuration as that described and depicted in relation to the secondary cartridges 102 and is closed -by a disc 122,<br>
Now that embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art that numerous modification and variations may be made without departing from the basic inventive concepts. For example in the method depicted by Figures 12 and 13, instead of mechanically holding the stemming 52 within the hole 56 by use of an acrow prop 66, different mechanical devices can be used such as for example, a weight or massive object, or placing say the bucket of an excavator over the collar 50. In a further variation, second end 18 of the shell 10 can be formed with a circumferential rebate 74 as depicted in Figure 14 for seating one end of a sleeve or tube 76. The tube 76 is filled with the stemming material 52. Tube 76 ideally would be made from a thin walled easily frangible and/or pliable material such as paper, thin plastics, rubber or cardboard. Indeed the shell 10 could also be made of such materials. In this event the tube 76 and/or shell 10 can be radially expanded to press against the wall of hole 46 and eliminate any free volume within the hole when subjected to axial compression forces provided by the acrow prop 66 or other mechanical retention device. End 58 of stemming bar 56 can be press fit into the opposite end of the tube 76 to allow one step insertion of the cartridge l0c, stemming material 52 and stemming bar.<br>
Also, end 58 of the stemming bar can be formed with a point, taper or wedge-like member 78 as shown in phantom in Figures 12 and 13 to assist in the radial spreading and compaction of the stemming material 52 against the sides of the hole 46 thereby increasing the sealing effect.<br>
With reference to the embodiment shown in Figures 14-16, as an alternative to the snap type fit between the primary cartridge l0c and secondary cartridges 102, other types of couplings can be used. For example, in the simplest form, the axial extension 112 and recesses 114 can be relatively configured to provide an interference fit. In other alternatives, complimentary screw threads can be formed on the outer surface of the extension 112 and the inner surface of the recess 114. In yet a further variation, a bayonet type coupling can be provided.<br>
In addition, the closure discs 122 can be replaced by a frangible and/or combustible webs. In addition, it is possible for the closure disc 122 or web to be placed at the end of shell 108 distant the axial extension 112. In order to then allow for engagement of an adjacent cartridge 102, the cartridges 102 will be filled with a quantity of energetic material less than their volume providing an ah" space to accommodate the inserted axial extension 112.<br>
Also, in Figure 14, a single electric match 32 is shown at the end of lead 34 for insertion into the end cap 28. However, it is possible for multiple electric matches or other initiators to be incorporated. For example, one or more additional electric matches can be coupled with a lead 34 via branch leads and sandwiched between the closure disc 122 and axial extension 112 of adjacent coupled primary shell and secondary shell, or to adjacent coupled secondary shells.<br>
All such modifications and variations are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention the nature of which is to be determined from the above description and the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
