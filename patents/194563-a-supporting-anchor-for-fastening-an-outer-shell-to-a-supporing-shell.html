				<td>Supporting anchor for fastening an outer shell to a supporting shell<br>
The invention relates to a supporting anchor for fasten¬ing an outer shell to a supporting shell, having anthor-ing zones that are separated by sealing rings and that can be filled with a hardenable compound.<br>
A supporting anchor according to the preamble is known from DE-OS 25 56 493 that has on its outer surface plurality of sealing rings, spaced apart from one another, for delimiting anchoring zones.   The rubber-like sealing rings are set in circumferential grooves of the supporting anchor and are positioned there secutely. As a result, the length of the anchoring zones and also the position thereof on the supporting anchor are already determined unalterably during manufacture of the supporting anchor.   Since both the wall thickness of the outer shells and the distance of the outer shells from the supporting shell may differ according to the apbli-cation in question, the scope of application of the known supporting anchor is limited.   Matching the supporting anchor to the prevailing conditions in a building project involves the entire supporting anchor Since the sealing rings must be attached to and post tioned on the supporting anchor during production.<br><br>
The manufacturing and operations costs are thus in¬creased, especially in the case of renovation projects.<br>
The problem underlying the invention is to provide a supporting anchor for fastening an outer shell to a supporting shell, which anchor is easy to install, can be produced economically and covers a wide range of appli¬cations as a result of being easily matched to different conditions.<br>
That problem is solved by the features given in claim 1.<br>
The delimiting of the anchoring zones by sealing rings which are arranged on a plastics part that can be placed over the supporting anchor makes it possible to alter the position of the anchoring zones on the supporting anchor, matching them to the object in question, by displacing the plastics part on the supporting anchor.   Supporting anchors are usually used for securing and maintaining cladding constructions that have already been installed. In order to Install the supporting anchor, a drilled hole is made through the outer shell into the supporting shell, the diameter of which drilled hole corresponds to the outer diameter of the sealing rings.   A hardenable compound is fed into the drilled hole in the supporting shell.   The supporting anchor having the plastics part placed over it is then inserted sufficiently far into the drilled hole for the first sealing ring to be inside the drilled hole In the supporting shell.   Pushing the plastics part in by a greater or lesser distance ensures that the front anchoring zone that is likewise delimited by sealing rings is also inside the drilled hole of the outer shell.  That anchoring zone is then likewise filled with the hardenable compound so that once the compound has hardened stress-free anchoring of the supporting and outer shells is achieved.   The supporting anchor thus<br><br>
takes up the shearing and te'nsi'le forces acting on the outer shell.<br>
If, in individual cases, the scope of adjustment of the supporting anchor by displacement of the plastics part on the supporting anchor is not sufficient, all that is required is to place a different plastics part over the supporting anchor, the sealing rings of which different plastics part are fixed, spaced apart at a different distance from one another, by means of the webs and/or sleeves.<br>
In a further construction of the invention, adjustment of the distance between sealing rings can be effected also by way of webs and/or sleeves of the plastics part that can be telescopically pushed together and interlocked. As a result, both the length of the anchoring zones and the distance between the anchoring zones can be altered, being matched to the thickness of, and distance between, the outer shell and supporting shell, by one and the same plastics part.<br>
The rear anchoring zone in the supporting shell and the front anchoring zone in the outer shell are advantageous¬ly filled separately.   whilst the rear anchoring zone is filled by rising of the compound from the base of the drilled hole towards the mouth of the drilled hole as the supporting anchor is pushed into the drilled hole that has been partially filled with the compound, the front anchoring zone  is filled by injecting the compound through a filling hole in the front portion of the supporting anchor.   As a result of the separate and different filling processes in the two anchoring zones, it is possible to dispense with a filling channel that passes right through the supporting anchor and that is difficult to produce especially in a supporting anchor<br><br>
made of high-grade steel. As a result of the shorter filling channel that opens only into the front anchoring zone, it is possible to use a compound that has a relatively high viscosity and thus a relatively short hardening time.<br>
In order to monitor the filling of the rear anchoring zone, it is advantageous to provide on the supporting anchor a connecting channel that starts from the rear anchoring zone and runs to the end of the supporting anchor. Advantageously the connecting channel is provided in the form of a longitudinal groove along the inside of a web and along the inside of the sleeve.<br>
Finally, in a further construction of the invention, the plastics part may have a closure disk that is located on the end of the supporting anchor and has an injection hole that is aligned with a filling hole in the supporting anchor, which filling hole opens into the front anchoring zone. As a means of monitoring filling, openings which are connected to the anchoring zones are provided in the edge region of the closure disk. Futhermore, the closure disk has an axially projecting grip by which the plastics part can be rotated on the supporting anchor and aligned.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a supporting anchor for fastening an outer shell to a supporting shell, having anchoring zones, separated by sealing rings, that can be filled with a hardenable compound, characterized in that a plastics part is placed over the supporting anchor, which plastics part has sealing rings that delimit the anchoring zones and that are fixed, spaced apart from one another, by means of webs and/or sleeves.<br>
Embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1        is a view of the supporting anchor according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2        is a view of the plastics part;<br>
Figure 3        shows the installed supporting anchor with filled, rear anchoring zone;<br><br>
Figure 4    shows the installed supporting anchor<br>
according to Figure 1 during the filling of the front anchoring zone;<br>
Figure 5    shows a modified construction of the supporting anchor; and<br>
Figure 6     shows the plastics part according to<br>
Figure 2 having an interlocking connection.<br>
The supporting anchor 1 illustrated in Figure 1 consists of a bolt 2, over which there has been placed a plastics part 3 according to Figure 2.   The plastics part 3 has a plurality of sealing rings 5, spaced apart from one another, that are fixed by means of the webs 9 and/or sleeves 5.   The distance between the sealing rings 5 and/or sleeves is adjustable.   Furthermore, the plastics part 3 is provided with a channel 8.   On the end of the supporting anchor 1 there is a closure disk 4 that is provided with an injection hole 13a and openings 6, 11, The injection hole 13a is aligned with the filling hole 13 of the supporting anchor 1, as shown in Figure 4. The closure disk 4 is provided also with grips 7 for the radial and axial alignment of the supporting anchor. Once the supporting anchor 1 has been inserted into the drilled hole 24 in the supporting shell 17, which drilled hole has been filled with the hardenable compound 25, as shown in Figure 3,   the compound is displaced by the bolt 2 and will fill the rear anchoring zone 23 that is delimited by the sealing ring 5.   The surplus compound 25 rises through the connecting channel 8 via the insulation zone 19 towards the mouth of the drilled hole and emerges from the opening 6 that is located at the edge of the closure disk 4.   The emergence of the compound means that the person installing the anchor can be sure that the rear anchoring zone 23 has been com-<br><br>
 pletely filled.  The connecting channel 8 is  provided i the form of a longitudinal groove on the inside of the web 9 and on the inside of the sleeve 5.<br>
The front anchoring zone 22 arranged in the outer shell iS is filled in a separate process illustrated in Figure 4.   The hardenable compound 25 is injected through the Injection hole 13a that is located in the closure disk 4 and that is aligned with the filling hole 13.   The injected compound 25 flows first to the bottom of the drilled hole, fills the anchoring zone 22 that is delimited by the sealing ring 5 and rises towat the mouth of the drilled hole.   The emergence of the compound 25 through the openings 11 provided in the closure disk 4 indicates that the front anchoring zone 22 has been filled.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the filling of the rear anchoring zone 23 of the supporting anchor 1, the connecting channel 8 being provided in the form of a longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the supporting anchor 1<br>
The detail illustrated in Figure 6 shows the plastics portion 3 that consists of two sleeves 5 that are connected to one  another by way  of an   interlocking connection 27.   As a result of that modified construe tion of the supporting anchor, it is possible, by displacing the sleeves 5, for the plastics part 3 to b matched, as required, to the object that is to be renovated-<br><br><br>
