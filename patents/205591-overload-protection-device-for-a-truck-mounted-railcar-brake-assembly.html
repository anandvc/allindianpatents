"OVERLOAD PROTECTION DEVICE FOR A TRUCK MOUNTED/BRAKE<br>
ASSEMBLY"	/.<br>
WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, of 1001 Air Brake Avenue, Wilmerding, Pennsylvania 15148, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention arid'thernanner in which it is to be performed:-	•     '<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an overload protection device for a truck-mounted railcar brake assembly<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prior to the present invention, the brakes on a truck-mounted brake assembly operate through the brake rigging either pneumatically, in response to the supply and release of compressed air at, a brake cylinder device, or manually, in response to the operation of the railway car handbrake wheel. As illustrated in Figure 3, the assembly consists of truss-type brake beams, with one beam having an expansible b:pake actuator in the form of a brake cylinder miounted thereon. The brake rigging operates in-response to the supply and release of compressed air from the brake cylinder. Having .its fixed-- end secured to the left-hand side of the compression member of the brake beam, the brake cylinder responds to the supply of compressed air by an axial expansion of its free end relative to its fixed end. Being corihected to an equalizing lever by a force transmitting member, the free<br><br>
end of the brake cylinder effects rotation of the equalizing lever about a pivot pin in a counterclockwise direction, as the brake cylinder expands axially with the supply of compressed air. This counterclockwise rotation of the equalizing lever results in the force-transmitting member being moved in the direction of the right hand, to effect counterclockwise rotation of the equalizing lever about its pivot pin. A portion of the force-transmitting member is secured to the fixed end of the brake cylinder, where resistance to movement is encountered at the end of the equalizing lever connected to the force-transmitting member by the pin, so that this lever acts as a second-class lever. The force exerted at the other end of the equalizing lever from the force-transmitting member causes the equalizing lever to pivot about its connection with the force-transmitting member and thereby move the brake beam in the direction of the right hand through the connection of the equalizing lever with the strut bar, thereby bringing the brake shoes of the brake head and brake shoe assemblies associated with the brake beam into engagement with the wheel treads of the wheel/axle unit. Once this brake shoe engagement occurs, the connection of equalizing lever with the force-transmitting member becomes  solid,  and the  equalizing<br><br>
lever becomes a second-class lever. Thus, the continued expansion of the free end of the brake cylinder causes a counterclockwise rotation of the equalizing lever to take place by pivotal rotation about the pin connection of the equalizing lever with the force-transmitting member. Accordingly, the force of expansion of the brake cylinder acts through the pin of the equalizing lever and the strut bar to force the brake beam in the direction of the left-hand, thereby bringing the brake shoes of the brake head and the brake shoe assemblies associated with the other brake beam into engagement with the wheel treads of the second wheel/axle unit.<br>
An example of this type of truck-mounted brake assembly is taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,613,016. The teachings of this reference are incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
Similarly, rotation of the end of the actuating lever in a counterclockwise rotation, when the handbrake chain is taken up in a well-known manner, affects the same result. An example of this type of truck-mounted brake assembly is taught in U.S. Patent No. 5,069,312. The teachings of this reference are incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br><br>
A common practice in the railway industry is to activate the pneumatic, and then the manual brake systems on a single railcar as a precaution against unwanted or unexpected movement of the car. This multiplies the forces on the brake assembly; therefore the brake beams may be subjected to a force exceeding their ultimate load capacity, thus causing deflection and premature failure. The present invention is designed with a preloaded compression member to absorb the excess force before deflection and possible failure of the brake beam occurs.<br>
