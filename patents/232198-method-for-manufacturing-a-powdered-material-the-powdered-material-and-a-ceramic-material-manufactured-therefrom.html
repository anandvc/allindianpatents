METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING A POWDERED MATERIAL, THE POWDERED MATERIAL AND A CERAMIC MATERIAL MANUFACTURED THEREFROM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a radiopaque and chemically bonded ceramic material, the binder phase of which consists mainly of a cement-based system. The invention also relates to a powdered material that has the capacity to form said ceramic material when it is saturated with a liquid reacting with the binder phase, and a method of manufacturing this powdered material. The invention has been developed primarily with a view to dental and orthopaedic purposes, but can also be applied in other application areas.<br>
PRIOR ART AND PROBLEMS<br>
The present invention relates to binding agent systems of the cement system type, in particular the system CaO-Al203-(Si02)-H20. Studies carried out according to the invention and earlier works (SE 463 493, SE 502 987 and SE 514 686) have produced results that indicate great potential for the system for strong and acid-resistant materials such as dental filling material. No other dental filling material existing today meets all the requirements in respect of biocompatibility, aesthetics and function that can be posed by patients and dental service staff.<br>
A description is given below of the practical demands that should generally be made on a dental filling material. Good handling ability with simple applicability in a cavity, moulding that permits good modellability, hardening/solidification that is sufficiently rapid for filling work and provides serviceability directly following a visit to the dentist. Furthermore, high strength and corrosion resistance exceeding that of earlier filling materials, good biocompatibility, radiopacity for X-ray purposes, good aesthetics and safe handling for staff without any allergy-provoking or toxic additives in the material are required. Good long-term attributes as regards dimensional stability are also demanded.<br>
In SE 463 493 it was described how a chemically bonded ceramic material, e.g. for dental purposes, can be caused to exhibit increased strength characteristics in that a powder body consisting of one or more hydraulic binding agents and possible ballast material is compacted at such a high external pressure and at so low a temperature that a well held-together raw compact is obtained without sintering reactions on compacting. The filling<br><br>
density in this raw compact has increased to at least 1.3 times the initial filling density, which is defined as the filling density attained through shaking, vibration and/or light packing of the loose powder into a container. The user of the material prepares the same by saturating the raw compact with a hydration liquid prior to application of the material or in situ in a cavity, e.g. a tooth cavity.<br>
More recently it has been shown in SE 502 987 that for cement systems complete hydration (which was regarded as reducing the risk of dimensional changes) can take place if complete soaking and subsequent compaction of the cement system takes place with the aid of a specially designed stopper.<br>
More recently still it has been shown in SE514 686 that a cement system of the type referred to in SE 463 493 or SE 502 987 can be caused to exhibit dimensionally stable long-term attributes if the material includes one or more expansion-compensating additives.<br>
Materials that are produced according to SE 463 493, SE 502 987 or SE 514 686 have certainly proved to satisfy most of the demands that can be made according to the above on dental filling material. However, it has proved to be the case that the aesthetics of the material suffer, in spite of a colour similar to natural tooth colour, due to the fact that the material is opaque, which means that the material does not have adequate optical attributes to appear natural. Natural tooth transmits light, especially enamel. The manner in which the light is diffused through the tooth is described as translucent, which is to be differentiated from transparent. A definition of a translucent material reads: "A material that reflects, transmits and absorbs light. Objects cannot be seen clearly through the material when the material is placed between the object and the observer." (Lemire, Burk, Color in dentistry, J.M. Ney Company (1975)). One method of measuring translucence is to determine the ratio between the quantity of reflected light with a white background and with a black background (ISO 9917). A material is described as translucent if it has opacity of between 35 and 90%, as opaque above 90% and transparent below 35%. Natural dentine has an opacity of approx. 70%, while natural enamel has an opacity of around 35%. The ability of a filling material to imitate the appearance of the natural tooth depends to a large extent on the material being translucent.<br><br>
Tn the abstract to JP 57209871 it is stated that translucence can be attained in a material of Portland cement and water glass.<br>
In JP 51111828, a method is described for the production of 3CaOAl203'6H20. In the method, the raw materials for the binder phase are mixed with a surplus of water for 1 -20 hours, with gradual heating from room temperature to 100Â°C. It is stated that hydrated calcium aluminate in the form of 3CaOAl2036H20 is formed thereby. This hydrated calcium aluminate is heated to between room temperature and 100Â°C and compressed at the same time at 50-800 MPa for 10-60 minutes, possibly following the addition of further water, to form a ceramic that is then dried at 60-250Â°C without the water of crystallization being evaporated. In the method described in JP 51111828, the mechanical compression of already hydrated material is thus executed.<br>
A related problem is that of achieving radiopacity at the same time as translucence, the former being required in a filling material in order for it to be able to be distinguished clearly from natural tooth and the onset of decay respectively in X-raying. The problem is due to the fact that the X-ray contrast aids that are common nowadays, e.g. ZrC&gt;2 and Sn02, interfere with the translucence. Even in an orthopaedic context or other non-biological context it is often desirable to have radiopacity, even if the need for translucence does not exist in this case.<br>
Yet another problem is that of achieving the highest possible mechanical strength and hardness in the ceramic material formed. It is also desirable here, especially in connection with dental purposes, primarily fillings, for hardness to develop rapidly. Increased chemical stability is also an aspect, in which the share of Al3+ in the material influences stability. It is desirable for the quantity Al    to be minimized.<br>
ACCOUNT OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a ceramic material of the type stated in the introduction, which material exhibits radiopacity, high mechanical strength and rapid hardness development. The material shall preferably exhibit translucence at the same time, at least if the material is intended for dental purposes. The invention also aims to provide a powdered material that has the capacity following saturation with a liquid reacting with the binder phase to hydrate to a chemically bonded ceramic material of the type intended<br><br>
according to the invention. The invention also aims to offer a method for the manufacture of such a powdered material. The invention also aims to offer a ceramic filler material.<br>
The desired objects and others are achieved according to the invention in that the binder phase of the powdered material mainly consists of CaO-Ala03 (ss) and/or SCaOAbCh (ss) and in that the powdered material and thus the ceramic material contain an atom type with a density above 5 g/cm3, expressed as the density of the element that corresponds to the atom type.<br>
In product terms, this means that the binder phase of the ceramic material formed has a mol ratio AI2O33H2O (ss) to 3CaOAl203'6H20 (ss) of a maximum of 2:1, preferably of less than 1:5 and even more preferredly less than 1:10,<br>
The designation (ss) here means "solid solution". As will be described in greater detail later, this means that the binder phase can, but does not have to, contain other atom types that are present in solid solution in the binder phase, these replacing Ca and/or Al in full or in part. In the quantity ratios that are indicated, these other atom types are counted as Ca or Al.<br>
The term binder phase is taken here to mean a cement content in the material, regardless of whether the powdered material or the hydrated ceramic product is in question.<br>
In method terms, the object of the invention is achieved in that the method for the manufacture of the powdered material comprises the stages of:<br>
a)	Mixing raw materials for the binder phase containing Ca and Al in a ratio Ca: Al greater than or equal to 1:2.4, preferably greater than or equal to 1:2.2 and most preferredly greater than or equal to 1:2, but no greater than 3:2.<br>
b)	Physically reducing diffusion paths between atoms in the various raw materials,<br>
c)	Sintering the material at an increased temperature to form said binder phase, which consists mainly of CaOAhCh (ss) and/or SCaOAbCh (ss), the material in stage a) and/or following stage c being brought to contain one or more heavy atom types with a density of over 5 g/cm3, expressed as the density for the element of the atom type.<br>
Â»<br><br>
On hydration, two final phases, 3CaOAl203"6H20 and Al20y3HaO will always be formed from conventional cement mixtures containing calcium aluminates of the phases CaO* AI2O3 and CaO-2Al203. The invention is based on the knowledge that AI2O33H2O is not desirable as it can have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of the ceramic product. To have more than one phase also affects the refraction of light by the ceramic material, since Al203*3H20 and 3CaO'Al203*6H20 have different refractive indices. It is therefore desirable to be able to manufacture a material that has only one phase, namely 3CaO- AI2O36H2O, in the hydrated state, or at least to be able to manufacture a material that has a minimized content of AI2O33H2O. By using only 3CaOAl2C&gt;3 as the binder phase, the hydrated material can be controlled to contain only 3CaO*Al203-6H20 . 3CaOAl203'6H20 has a higher mechanical strength than AI2O33H2O and the refraction is also reduced, resulting in lower opacity, i.e. increased translucence. It is also the case that the hydration time is shortened, as fewer phases are formed, and that several stages in the hydration process are shorter. By instead using only CaO AI2O3 as the binder phase, the hydrated material can be controlled to contain SCaO-AWVSHaO to AI2O33H2O in the ratio 1:2, which signifies a considerably greater proportion of 3CaO-Al203*6H20 than if conventional powder mixtures containing calcium aluminates of the phases CaOAhCh and CaO2AJ203 are used. Naturally mixtures of CaOAkCh and 3CaOAl2C&gt;3 can also be used for a reduced formation ofAliOySHiQ, However, the binder phase's content of CaO*2Al203 should be minimized and preferably omitted completely.<br>
Yet another advantage of the ceramic material according to the invention is that it contains a lower proportion of Al ions than conventional calcium aluminate compositions, which ought to be an advantage in biological systems, especially in orthopaedic applications.<br>
With a view to achieving radiopacity, the powdered material, and thus also the ceramic product, contains at least one heavy atom type with a density of over 5 g/cm , preferably Zr, La, Ta, Zn, Ba and/or Sr. It is preferred that this/these atom type(s) form part of one or more compounds that also contain fluoride.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the powdered material and thus also the ceramic product contains in addition to the binder phase one or more additives that contain the heavy atom type or atom types and that have a refractive index in visible light that deviates by a maximum of 15%, preferably a maximum of 10% and even more preferredly a<br><br>
maximum of 5% from the refractive index of the binder phase when the binder phase is hydrated. It is preferred that the additive is a glass, i.e. amorphous phase, most preferredly a silicate glass.<br>
Examples of additive materials that satisfy one or more of the stated requirements are: silicate glass, barium aluminium borosilicate glass, barium aluminium fluorosilicate glass, barium sulphate, barium fluoride, zirconium-zinc-strontium-borosilicate glass, apatite, fluorapatite and similar materials. In these materials barium can be exchanged for strontium and the materials can also contain fluoride. The additive materials can also have any morphology or form, including: spheres, regular or irregular forms, whiskers, plates or the like. Particles of the additive material should be smaller than 50 jam, preferably smaller than 20 (j.m and even more preferredly smaller than 10 \xm. The size of the particles is measured by laser diffraction and calculated as the volume mean value D[4,3]. Additive materials of this type can be present in total quantities of at least 3% by volume, preferably at least 5% by volume and even more preferredly at least 10% by volume, but at most 55% by volume, preferably at most 50% by volume and even more preferredly at most 45% by volume in the powdered material.<br>
According to the above, according to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the heavy atom type or atom types can instead be included in the actual binder phase in such a way that they replace Ca and go into the solid solution (ss) in the binder phase, or alternatively form a compound that is close chemically and/or structurally. Apart from Ca positions (where Ba, Sr etc. can replace Ca), solid solution (ss) in e.g. 3CaOAl203*6H20 is possible in H2O positions (where oxides of Si, Ti, Zr etc. or fluorides can replace H2O) and in Al positions (where Fe, V, Sn, Bi and P etc. can replace Al), it being possible to influence properties apart from radiopacity, such as dimensional stability, chemical resistance etc. positively. To manufacture the binder phase, raw materials are preferably used in this case that contain a heavy atom type in the same group as Ca in the periodic system, suitably Ba and/or Sr, and in addition possibly fluoride. The advantage of this is that the actual binder phase is radiopaque, and that the atoms that provide radiopacity do not interfere with translucence.<br><br>
The two variants can naturally also be combined, additives with a heavy atom type being mixed into the powdered material together with the binder phase, which binder phase also contains heavy atom type(s).<br>
In the same way as Ba and/or Sr can be used to replace Ca in the binder phase, with a view to achieving radiopacity and translucence at the same time, silicon in the form of fine crystalline silica (microsilica) and/or Portland cement (OPC) can be caused to go into solid solution (ss) in the binder phase, with a view to achieving dimensional stability of the ceramic product.<br>
Solid solution (ss) in e.g. SCaO-AChIO can be produced in such a way that the solid solutions - with increased radiopacity- are non-hydrating. In these cases, these can be used advantageously as an inert phase to analogue solid solutions that are hydrating. This considerably increases the degree of freedom as regards the choice of raw materials and manufacturing criteria.<br>
The powdered material shall further satisfy the requirements indicated above for mouldability and durability, and be easy to handle in connection with its wetting and application in a cavity, e.g. a tooth cavity. The ceramic material formed should also, for dental applications, meet the demands made on such a material according to the above. It is especially preferred that the material exists in the form of a raw compact that has a degree of compaction of 40-80% by volume solid phase, preferably 50-70% by volume solid phase and even more preferredly 55-65% by volume solid phase prior to hydration, in a manner such as described in SE 463 493. However, the invention is also fully applicable in connection with a wet-moulded material that exists in powder form prior to hydration, such as the material described in SE 502 987. The material can also contain one or more expansion-compensating additives suitable for giving the ceramic material dimensionally stable long-term attributes, such as described in SE 514 686. It is generally the case that said binder phase consists at least chiefly of calcium aluminate cement. However, the addition of one or more other cement binder phases to a total amount of less than 30% by volume can be used, preferably 1-20% by volume and even more preferredly 1-10% by volume. Admixtures of ordinary Portland cement (OPC cement) or fine crystalline silica, which according to the above can possibly be included in solid solution in the binder phase, are used advantageously. Furthermore, it is desirable for the material to have a hardness of<br><br>
at least 50 HV in the hydrated state, preferably at least 100 HV and even more preferredly at least 140 HV.<br>

It is preferred from the translucence viewpoint that the raw materials for the binder phase have a high whiteness, the whiteness value preferably exceeding 70, preferably exceeding 74 according to ASTM E313. The content of transition metals in the powder mixture should for the same reason be under 0.5% by weight, preferably under 0.4% by weight.<br><br>
The translucence can be improved further by a low level of porosity of the finished ceramic material, preferably a porosity level of less than 20%, even more preferredly of less than 10% and still more preferredly of less than 5%.<br>

A series of experiments was carried out to study the effect of different process parameters in the manufacture of calcium aluminate, 3CaOAl2C&gt;3, and its influence on the material's translucence and mechanical properties, without regard to radiopacity.<br>
Description of raw materials<br>
Calcium aluminate of the phases CaOAhCh and CaO2Al203 forming part of e.g. calcium<br>
aluminate cement (Alcoa or alternatively Lafarge) CaO, Ca(OH)2, Al(OH)3, AI2O3 (Merck).<br>
Examples a) - d) below describe<br>
a)	Manufacture of 3CaOAl203 at high temperature from CaO and AI2O3<br>
b)	Manufacture of 3CaO*Al203 at low temperature from CaO and AI2O3<br>
C)   Manufacture of 3CaOAl203 at high temperature from Ca(OH)2 and Al(OH)3 d&gt;   Manufacture of 3CaO-Al203 at low temperature from Ca(OH)2 and Al(OH)3<br>
The raw materials were mixed in such proportions that the mol ratio Ca:Al was 3:2.<br><br>
Following mixing, the powder was subjected to cold isostatic pressing in examples a) - d) at 250 MPa for a green body. Following pressing, the green bodies were ground into small granules. The powder mixtures in examples a) - d) were then sintered according to the following cycles;<br>
a)	1000Â°C for 1 hour followed by 1480Â°C for 8 hours then cooling to room temperature for 1 hour.<br>
b)	1000Â°C for 1 hour followed by 1350Â°C for 12 hours then cooling to room temperature for 1 hour.<br>
c)	1000Â°C for 1 hour followed by 1480Â°C for 4 hours then cooling to room temperature for 1 hour.<br>
d)	1000Â°C for 1 hour followed by 1350Â°C for 6 hours then cooling to room temperature for 1 hour.<br>
Verification (X-ray diffraction) of the resulting phase composition in examples a-d) following sintering showed that all the original powder has been converted to 3CaOAl2C&gt;3<br>
The powders in examples a-d) were ground in a ball mill with inert grinding balls of silicon nitride with a filling level of 35%. Isopropanol was used as the grinding liquid. Following grinding, all the powder had a grain size of less than 20 urn. Following evaporation of the solvent, cylindrical raw compacts were made with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 1 mm, which were wetted with water. The material was then kept moist at 37Â°C for a week prior to measurements of translucence. The measurements of translucence were carried out according to ISO 9917 (100 means opaque and 35 to 90 means translucence). The hardness (Vickers method) of the material was measured after one week. The material was compared with a calcium aluminate cement containing the phases CaO'AhOs and CaO*2Al203 (LaFarge). The phase composition following hydration was also verified (X-ray diffraction (XRD)). The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
The results show that a material with increased hardness and improved translucence can be obtained by manufacturing the raw material for the material in a controlled manner with controlled phase composition.<br>

The powders in examples a-c) were ground in a ball mill with inert grinding balls of silicon nitride with a filling level of 35%. Isopropanol was used as the grinding liquid. Following grinding, all the powder had a grain size of less than 20 ym. Following evaporation of the solvent, cylindrical raw compacts were made with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 1 mm, which were wetted with water. The material was then kept moist at 37Â°C for a week prior to measurements of radiopacity. The measurements of radiopacity were carried out according to ANSI/ADA Specification No. 27 (1 mm sample body as opaque as 2 mm Al). The material was compared with a calcium aluminate cement containing the phases CaOAl203 and CaO2Al203 (LaFarge). The results are shown in Table 4.<br><br>

Experiments were carried out to study the effect of the phase composition of the binder<br>
phase on the development of hardness with time for the material, without regard to<br>
radiopacity.<br><br>
Description of raw materials<br>
Calcium aluminate of the phases CaOAhCh and CaO2Al203 forming part of e.g. calcium aluminate cement (Alcoa or alternatively Lafarge). Calcium aluminate cement of the phase 3CaOAl203 manufactured according to Example 1 and calcium aluminate of the phase CaOAhOs manufactured according to Example 2.<br>

CaO-AI203<br>
o)    The hardness as a function of time for calcium aluminate consisting of the phase 3CaOAl203.<br>
The powders in examples a-c) were ground in a ball mill with inert grinding balls of silicon nitride with a filling level of 35%. Isopropanol was used as the grinding liquid. Following grinding, all the powder had a grain size of less than 20 jam. Following evaporation of the solvent, cylindrical sample bodies were made with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 1 mm, which were wetted with water. The material was then kept moist at 37Â°C for a week between measurements of hardness (Vickers method load lOOg). Measurements were carried out after 1, 2,4, 8 and 16 days. The results are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
The results show that the hardness is developed more rapidly with time due to the fact that the raw material for the material was manufactured in a controlled manner with controlled composition of the binder phase.<br><br><br><br><br>
The results show that a radiopaque material can be obtained by causing the powdered material according to the invention to contain inert particles.<br>
