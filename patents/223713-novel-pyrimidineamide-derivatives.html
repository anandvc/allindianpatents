Novel Pyrimidineamide Derivatives and the Use Thereof<br>
The invention relates to novel substituted N-(3-benzoylaminophenyf)-4-pyridyl-2-pyrimidinamine derivatives, processes for the preparation thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing same, the use thereof optionally in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active compounds for the therapy of a disease which responds to an inhibition of protein kinase activity, especially a neoplastic disease, and a method for the treatment of such a disease.<br>
Protein kinases (PKs) are enzymes which catalyze the phosphorylation of specific serine, threonine or tyrosine residues in cellular proteins. These post-translational modifications of substrate proteins act as molecular switches regulating cell proliferation, activation and/or differentiation. Aberrant or excessive PK activity has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferative disorders. In a number of cases, It has been possible to treat diseases, such as proliferative disorders, by making use of PK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.<br>
In view of the large number of protein kinase inhibitors and the multitude of proliferative and other PK-related diseases, there is an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as PK inhibitors and thus in the treatment of these PK related diseases. What Is required are new classes of pharmaceutically advantageous PK inhibiting compounds.<br>
The Philadelphia Chromosome is a hallmark for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and carries a hybrid gene that contains N-terminal exons of the bcr gene and the major C-termlnal part (exons 2-11) of the c-abi gene. The gene encodes either a 190 kD, 210 kD, or 230 kD chimeric protein, depending on which of three alternative break points in bcr is involved. The Abl-part of the Bcr-AbI protein contains the Abl-tyrosine kinase which is tightly regulated in the wild type c-AbI, but constitutively activated in the Bcr-AbI fusion protein. This deregulated tyrosine kinase interacts with multiple cellular signaling pathways leading to transformation and deregulated proliferation ot the cells (Lugo et al., Science 247, 1079 [1990]),<br><br>
The p210 Bcr-AbI is expressed in 95% of CML patients and in approximately 33% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Expression of the smaller pi 90 kD protein occurs more frequently in ALL, but rarefy in CML and is characterized clinically by prominent monocytosis. The 230 kD fusion protein is associated with the rare chronic neutrophilic leukemia, whose progression to blast crisis is slow, in advanced stage CML and in ALL in particular, clones frequently emerge in which the kinase domain of the Bcr-AbI protein is mutated. Such mutants include lor example the E225V and M351T transformations (Shah et a!., Cancer Research 2, 117-225 [2002]}.<br>
Mutant ras oncogenes are frequently associated with tumor progression. The Ras proteins are expressed from three different genes, namely, Neuroblastoma (N)-ras, Harvey (Ha)-ras and Kirsten (K)-ras. K-ras mutated most often in solid tumors, such as colon, lung and especially pancreatic cancer, and N-ras in haematopoietic tumors, predominantly acute myelogenous leukemia {Lyons et ai, Endocrine-Related Cancer 8, 219 [2001]). Ras has been shown to regulate several pathways that contribute to cellular transformation, including e.g. the Raf/MEK pathway by binding to and activating Raf kinase.<br>
The N-(3-benzoylaminophenyl)-4-pyridyl-2-pyrimidinamine derivatives of formula 1, described below in more detail, show excellent inhibition of protein kinase activity, especially inhibition of one or more tyrosine kinases, such Bcr-AbI, mutant Bcr-AbI, c-Abl. Raf, the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGF-R, Flt3, VEGF-R, EGF-R, and c-Kit, as well as combinations of two or more of these. In particular, the compounds of the invention show high potency against some of the mutant forms of Bcr-AbI, which have been observed in drug-resistant patients, in view of these activities, the compounds can be used for the treatment of diseases related to especially aberrant or excessive activity of such types of kinases, e.g. for the treatment of particular cases of leukemia and of solid tumors such as colon, lung and pancreatic cancer.<br>

The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of c-AbI, Bcr-AbI, Raf and VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated as follows:<br>
Test for activity against c-AbI protein tyrosine kinase. The test is conducted as a filter binding assay as follows: The Hls-tagged kinase domain of c-AbI is cloned and expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system as described by Bhat etal.,J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16170-5 (1997). A protein of 37 kD (c-AbI kinase) Is purified by a two-step procedure over a cobalt metal<br><br>
chelate column followed by an anion exchange column with a yield of 1-2 mg/L of Sf9 cells. The purity of the c-AbI kinase is &gt;90% as judged by SDS-PAGE after Coomassie blue staining. The assay contains: c-AbI kinase (50 ng), 20 mM Trts-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCIs, 10 fjM NaaVOi, 1 mM DTT and 0,06 ;/Ci/assay [y P]-ATP (5 fjM ATP) using 30 /yg/mL poly-Ala,Glu,Lys,Tyr-6:2:5:1 (Poly-AEKY, Sigma P1152) in the presence of 1% DMSO, total volume of 30 /JL. Reactions are terminated by adding 1D L of 250 mM EDTA, and 3D ;/L of the reaction mixture is transferred onto Immobilon-PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) previously soaked for 5 min with methanol, rinsed with wafer, then soaked for 5 mi'n with 0.5% H3PO4 and mounted on vacuum manifold with disconnected vacuum source. After spotting all samples, vacuum is connected and each well rinsed with 200 //L 0.5 % HaPO*. Membranes are removed and washed on a shaker with 0.5% H3PO4 (4 times) and once with ethano}. Membranes are counted after drying at ambient temperature, mounting in Packard TopCount 96-we!l frame, and addition of 10 /jtVwell of Microscint TM (Packard).<br>
Test for activity against Bcr-Abl. The murine myeloid progenitor cell line 32Dci3 transfected with the p210 Bcr-AbI expression vector pGDp210Bcr/Ab[ (32D-bcr/abl) was obtained from J. Griffin (Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA). The cells express the fusion Bcr-AbI protein with a conststulively active Abl kinase and proliferate growth factor independent. The cells are expanded in RPMI 1640 (AMIMED), 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine (Gibco) („complete medium"), and a working stock is prepared by freezing aliquots of 2 x 10 cells per vial in freezing medium (95% PCS, 5% DMSO (SIGMA)). After thawing, the cells are used during maximally 10-12 passages for the experiments.<br>
For cellular assays, compounds are dissolved in DMSO and diluted with complete medium to yield a starting concentration of 10 ;;M followed by preparation of serial 3-fold dilutions in complete medium. 200'000 32D-Bcr/Abl cells in 50 //L complete medium are seeded per well in 96 well round bottom tissue culture plates. 50 JJL per well of serial 3-fold dilutions of the test compound are added to the cells in triplicates. Untreated ceils are used as control. The compound is incubated together with the cells for 90 min at 37°C, 5% CO2, followed by centrifugation of the tissue culture plates at 1300 rpm (Beckman GPR centrifuge) and removal of the supernatants by careful aspiration taking care not to remove any of the pelleted cells. The cell pellets are lysed by addition of 150 /JL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 2 mM sodium ortho-vanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 50 /vg/mL aprotinin and 80 /g/mL leupeptin) and either used immediately for the ELISA or stored frozen in the plates at -20°C until usage.<br><br>
Black ELISA plates (Packard HTRF-96 black plates) are precoated over night at 4°C with 50 ng/well of the rabbit polyclonal anti-abl-SH3 domain Ab 06-466 from Upstate in 50/JL PBS. After washing 3 times with aOO/yLVwell PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 {PBST) and 0.5% TopBlock (Juro), residual protein binding sites are blocked with 200/vL/well PBST, 3% TopBlock for 4 h at room temperature foilowed by incubation with 50 uL lysates of untreated or compound-treated cells (20 //g total protein per well) for 3-4 h at 4°C. After 3 washings, 50 A/L/well anti-phosphotyrosine Ab PY20(AP) labeled with alkaline phosphatase (Zymed) diluted to 0.2 /jg/mL in blocking buffer is added and incubated over night (4"C). For all incubation steps the plates are covered with plate sealers (Costar). Finally, the plates are washed another three times with washing buffer and once with deionized water before addition of 90 pL/well of the AP-substrate CDPStar RTU with Emerald II. The plates, now sealed with Packard TopSea-A plate sealers, are incubated (or 45 min at room temperature in the dark and luminescence is quantified by measuring counts per second (CPS) with a Packard Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter (Top Count). The difference between the ELISA-readout (CPS) obtained for with the lysates of the untreated 32D-Bcr/Abl cells and the readout for the assay-background (all components, but without cell lysate) is calculated and taken as 100% reflecting the constitutively phosphorylated Bcr-Abi protein present in these cells. The activity of the compound on the Bcr-AbI kinase activity is expressed as percent reduction of the Bcr-AbI phosphorylation. The values for the IC50 and ICgo are determined from the dose response curves by graphical extrapolation.<br>
Test for activity against mutant Bcr-Abli The activity of compounds on the M351T mutant Bcr-AbI kinase activity is assessed as described above, except that 32Dcl3 cells transfected with mutant Bcr-AbI in place of p210 Bcr-AbI are utilised.<br>
c-Raf-1 protein kinase assay: Recombinant c-Raf-1 protein is obtained by triple infection of Sf21 cells with GST-c-Raf-1 recombinant baculovirus together with v-Src and v-Ras recombinant baculoviruses that are required for active c-Raf-1 kinase production (Williams ef a/., PNAS 1992; 89:2922-6). Active Ras (v-Ras) is required to recruit c-Raf-1 to the cell membrane and v-Src to phosphorylate c-Raf-1 to fully activate it. Cells are seeded at 2,5 X 10' cells per 150 mm dish and allowed to attach to a 150 mm dish for 1 hr at RT. Media {SF900II containing 10 % FBS) is aspirated and recombinant baculovirus GST-c-Raf-1, v-Ras and v-Src are added at MCI of 3.0, 2.5 and 2.5, respectively, in a total volume of 4-5 mL.<br><br>
Cells are incubated for 1 hr at RT and then 15 mL of medium is added. Infected cells are incubated for 48-72 hr at 27°C. Infected 5(21 cells are scraped and collected into a 50 mL tube and centhfuged for 10 min at 40 at 1100 g in a Sorvall centrifuge. The cell pellet is washed once with ice cold PBS and lysed with 0.6 mL lysis buffer per 2.5 x 10'cells. Complete lysis of cells is achieved after 10 min on ice with occasional pipetting. The cell lysates are centrifuged for 10 min al 4°C at 14,500 g in a Sorvall centrifuge with SS-34 rotor and the supernatant is transferred to a fresh tube and stored at -80°C. c-Raf-1 is purified from cell lysates using 100 pL of packed glutathione-sepharose 4B beads equilibrated in ice cold PBS per 2.5 x 10' cells. GST-c-Raf-1 is allowed to bind lo the beads at 4°C for 1 hr with rocking. Bound GST-c-Raf-1 with beads is transferred to a column. The column is washed once with lysis buffer and twice with ice cold Tris buffered saline. Ice cold elution buffer is added and column flow is stopped to allow the free glutathione to disrupt the interaction of GST-c-Raf-1 with glutathione sephacose beads. Fractions (1 mL) are collected into pre-chilied tubes. Each tube contains 10 % glycerol (final concentration) to maintain kinase activity during freeze thaw cycles. Purified fractions of GST-c-Raf-1 kinase protein are stored at -80°C.<br>
\KB is used as substrate for the c-Rat-1 kinase. IKB is expressed in bacteria as a His-tagged protein BL21. LysS bacteria containing the IKB plasmid are grown to an OD6Q0 of 0.6 in LB medium, then induced to express the IKB with IPTG (final concentration of 1 mfvl) for 3 hrs at SVC and then bacteria are lysed by sonication (microtip limit setting for 3 times at 1 min each in sonication buffer [50 mlvl Tris pH 8.0, 1 mlwl D7T, 1 mM EDTA] and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant is mixed with ammonium sulfate to give a final concentration of 30 %. This mixture is rocked for 15 min at 4 0 then spun at 10,000 g for 15 min. The pellet is resuspended in binding buffer (Novagen) containing 10 mM BSA. This solution is applied to Ni-agarose (Novagen) and washed according to the Novagen manual. IKB is eluted from the column using elution buffer (0.4 M imidazole, 0.2 fvl NaCI, 8 mfvl Tris pH 7.9). Fractions containing protein are dialysed in 50 mM Tris pH 8,1 mM DTT. The activity of c-Raf-1 protein kinase is assayed in the presence or absence of inhibitors, by measuring the incorporation of P from [yP] ATP into IKB. The assay is carried out in 96-well plates at ambient temperature for 60 min. It contains (total volume of 30 /JL): c-Raf-1 kinase (400 ng), 25 mM TrisHCI, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgClj, 5 mM MnCl2, QpM NajVO., 1 mM DTT and 0.3Ci/assay [y P]-ATP (10/JM ATP) using 600 ng IKB in the presence of 1 % DMSO, Reactions are terminated by adding 10 /L of 250 mM EDTA and 30/yL of the reaction mixture is transferred onto Immobilon-PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA,<br><br>
USA) previously soaked for 5 min with methanol, rinsed with water, then soaked for 5 min with 0.5 % H3PO4 and mounted on vacuum manifold with disconnected vacuum source. After spotting all samples, vacuum is connected and each well rinsed with 200 /JL 0.5 % H3PO4. Membranes are removed and washed 4 x on a shaker with 0.5 % H3PO4, once with ethanol. Membranes are counted after drying at ambient temperature, mounting in Packard TopCount 96-we)l frame, and addition of lOL/weli of Microscint TM (Packard).<br>
Test for activity against VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase. The test is conducted using Flt-1 VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase. The detailed procedure is as follows: 30 nL kinase solution {10 ng of the kinase domain of Flt-1, Shibuya et ai. Oncogenes, 519-24 [1990]) in 20 mM Tns'HCI pH 7.5, 3 mM manganese dichloride (MnCl2), 3 mM magnesium chloride (MgCI), 10 fiM sodium vanadate, 0.25 mg/mL polyethyleneglycoi (PEG) 20000, ImM dithiothreitoi and 3 ng/)jL poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland), 8 M pP]-ATP (0.2 nCi) , 1% DMSO, and 0 to 100 \xM of the compound to be tested are incubated together for 10 minutes at room temperature. Ttie reaction is then terminated by the addition of 10 [iL 0.25 M ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) pH 7. Using a multichannel dispenser (LAB SYSTEMS, USA), an aliquot of 20 )iL is applied to a PVDF (= polyvinyl difluoride) Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, USA), through a Gibco-BRL microtiter filter manifold and connected to a vacuum. Following complete elimination of the liquid, the membrane Is washed 4 times successively in a bath containing 0.5% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and once with ethanol, incubated for 10 minutes each time while shaking, then mounted in a Hewlett Packard TopCount Manifold and the radioactivity measured after the addition of 10 /vL Microscint® (B-scintillation counter liquid). ICso-values are determined by linear regression analysis of the percentages for the inhibition of each compound in at least four concentrations (as a rule 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 nmol). The ICso-values that can be found with compounds of formula 1 are in the range of 1 to lO'OOO nM, preferably in the range of 1 to 100 nM.<br>
The inhibition of VEGF-induced KDR-receptor autophosphorylation can be confirmed with a further in vitro experiment in cells: transfected CHO cells, which permanently express human VEGF receptor (KDR), are seeded in complete culture medium with 10% fetal calf serum (PCS) in 6-well cell-culture plates and incubated at 37°C under 5% C02 until they show about 80% confluency. The compounds to be tested are then diluted in culture medium (without FQS, with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and added to the cells. (Controls comprise medium without test<br><br>
compounds). After two hours of incubation at 37°C, recombinant VEGF is added; the final VEGF concentration is 20 ng/mL). After a further five minute incubation at SC, the cells are washed twice with ice-cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and immediately lysed in 100 ;/L lysis buffer per well. The lysates are then centrifuged to remove the cell nuclei, and tfie protein concentrations of the supernatants are determined using a commercial protein assay (BIORAD). The lysates can then either be immediately used or, if necessary, stored at -20°C.<br>
A sandwich ELISA is carried out to measure the KDR-receptor phosphorylation: a monoclonal antibody to KDR (for example Mab 1495.12.14) is immobilized on black ELISA plates (OptiPlate™ HTRF-96 from Packard). The pfates are then washed and the remaining free protein-binding sites are saturated with 1 % BSA in PBS. The ceil lysates (20 /vg protein per well) are then incubated in these plates overnight at 4°C together with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody coupled with alkaline phosphatase (PY20:AP from Transduction Laboratories). The plates are washed again and the binding of the antiphosphotyrosine antibody to the captured phosphorylated receptor is then demonstrated using a luminescent AP substrate (CDP-Star, ready to use, with Emerald II; TROPIX). The luminescence is measured in a Packard Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter (Top Count). The difference between the signal of the positive control (stimulated with VEGF) and that of the negative control (not stimulated with VEGF) corresponds to VEGF-induced KDR-receptor phosphorylation (= 100 %). The activity of the tested substances is calculated as % inhibition of VEGF-induced KDR-receptor phosphorylation, wherein the concentration of substance that induces half the maximum inhibition is defined as the ED50 (effective dose for 50% inhibition). Compounds of formula 1 here preferably show ED50 values in the range of 0.25 nM to 1000 nM, preferably 0.25 to 250 nM.<br>
A compound of formula 1 or a N-oxide thereof inhibits to varying degrees also other tyrosine kinases involved in signal transduction which are mediated by trophic factors, for example Raf, Bcr-AbI and Abl kinase, Arg, kinases from the Src family, especially c-Src kinase, Lck, and Fyn; also kinases of the EGF family, for example, c-erbB2 kinase (HER-2), c-erbB3 kinase, c-erbB4 kinase; insulin-like growth factor receptor kinase (lGF-1 kinase), especially members of the PDGF-receptor tyrosine kinase family, such as PDGF-receptor kinase, CSF-1-receptor kinase, KH-receptor kinase and VEGF-receptor kinase; and also serine/threonine kinases, all of which play a role in growth regulation and transformation in mammalian cells, including human cells.<br><br>

Derivatives of the acid of formula 2 wherein the carboxy group is in activated form are preferably formed in situ. For example, N,N'-disubstituted amidino esters can be formed in situ by reacting a mixture of the acid of formula 2 and the amine of formula 3 in the presence of a suitable N,N-disubstituted carbodiimide, for example N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Reactive mixed anhydrides of the acid of formula 2 with an organic phosphonic acid may be formed in situ by reaction with e.g. propylphosphonic anhydride or diethylcyanophosphonate in the presence of suitable base, preferably a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine or dimethylaminopyridine.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in a manner known er se, the reaction conditions being dependent especially on whether, and if so how, the carboxy group of the carboxylic acid of formula 2 has been activated, usually in the presence of a suitable solvent or diluent or of a mixture thereof and, if necessary, in the presence of a condensation agent, which, for example when the carboxy group participating in the reaction is in the form of an anhydride, may also be an acid-binding agent, with cooling or heating, for example in a temperature range from approximately -30 °C to approximately +150 "C, especially approximately from 0 "C to +100 °C, preferably from room temperature (approx. +20 "C) to +70 °C, in an open or closed reaction vessel and/or in the atmosphere of an inert gas, for example nitrogen. Customary condensation agents are, for example, carbodiimides, for example N,N'-diethyl-, N,N'-dipropyl-, N,N'-dicyclohexyl- or N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylam)nopropyl)-carbodiimide, suitable carbonyl compounds, for example carbonyldiimidazole, or 1,2-oxazolium compounds, for example 2-ethyi-5-phenyl-1,2-oxazolium 3'-sulfonate and 2-tert-buty(-5-methyl-isoxazolium perchlorate, or a suitable acylamino compound, for example 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline. Customary acid-binding condensation agents are, for<br><br>
example, alkali metal carbonates or tiydfogen carbonates, for example sodium or potassium carbonate or hydrogen carbonate (customarily together with a sulfate), or organic bases, such as, customarily, pyridine or triethylamine, or sterically hindered tri-lower alkylamines, for example N,N-diisopropyl-N-ethyl-amine.<br>
In a preferred variant, the carboxyiJc acid of formula 2 is reacted with an amine of formula 3 in a suitable solvent, such as e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide, in the presence of propylphosphonic anhydride or diethylcyanophosphanate and triethylamine, between 1 and 48 hours at between 0°C and around SOC, preferably at room temperature.<br>
If one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy or amino, are or need to be protected in a compound of formula 2 or 3, because they should not take part in the reaction, these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of amides, in particular peptide compounds, and also of cephalosporins and penicillins, as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.<br>
The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acyiations, etherifications, esterifications, oxidations, solvolysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter.<br>
The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference books for peptide synthesis as cited hereinbefore, and in special books on protective groups such as J. F. W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in "Methoden der organischen Chemie" (Methods of organic chemistry), Houben-Weyl. 4th edition. Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, and in T. W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Wiley, New York.<br>
In the additional process steps, carried out as desired, functional groups of the starting<br><br>
compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected for example by one or more of the protecting groups mentioned hereinabove under "prolecting groups". The protecting groups are then wholly or partly removed according to one of the methods described there.<br>
Salts of a compound of formula 1 with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula 1 may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent.<br>
Salts can usually be converted to free compounds, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carboriates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.<br>
Stereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula 1 itself, Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enaniiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.<br>
In a compound of the formula 1 wherein in a group Ri or R2 hydrogen is attached to a nitrogen or oxygen atom and should be converted to the respective compound wherein hydrogen is replaced by lower alkyl, this may be performed by reaction e.g. with a diazo lower alkyl compound, especially diazomethane. in an inert solvent, preferably in the presence of a noble metal catalyst, especially in dispersed form, e.g. copper, or a noble metal salt, e.g. copper(l)-chloride or copper(ll)-sulfate. Also reaction with lower alkyihalogenides is possible, or with other leaving group carrying lower alkanes, e.g. lower alkyl alcohols esterified by a strong organic sulfonic acid, such as a lower alkanesulfonic acid (optionally substituted by halogen, such as fluoro), an aromatic sulfonic acid, for example unsubstituled or substituted benzenesulfonic acid, the substituents preferably being selected from lower alkyl, such as methyl, halogen, such as bromo, and/or nitro, e.g. esterified by<br><br>
methanesuifonic acid, or p-toluene sulfonic acid. The atkylation takes place under usual conditions (or alkylation of amides, especially in aqueous solution and/or in the presence of polar solvents, typically alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or ethylene glycol, or dipolar aprotic solvents, e.g. letrahydrofuran, dioxane, or dimethylformamide, where applicable in the presence of acidic or basic catalysts, generally at temperatures from about OC to the boiling temperature of the corresponding reaction mixture, preferably between 20°C and reflux temperature, if necessary under increased pressure, e.g. in a sealed tube, and/or under inert gas, typically nitrogen or argon.<br>
It should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the ievel of appropriate intermediates.<br>
All process steps described here can be carried out under known reaction conditions, preferably under those specifically mentioned, in the absence of or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents, preferably such as are inert to the reagents used and able to dissolve these, in the absence or presence of catalysts, condensing agents or neutralising agents, for<br>
example ion exchangers, typically cation exchangers, for example in the H"' form, depending on the type of reaction and/or reactanis at reduced, normal, or elevated temperature, for example in the range from -1 OO'C to about 190°C, preferably from about -80°C to about 150°C, for example at -80 to -60°C, at room temperature, at - 20 to 400 or at the boiling point of the solvent used, under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel, where appropriate under pressure, and/or in an inert atmosphere, for example under argon or nitrogen.<br>
Salts may be present in all starting compounds and transients, if these contain salt-forming groups. Salts may also be present during the reaction of such compounds, provided the reaction is not thereby disturbed.<br>
At ail reaction stages, isomeric mixtures that occur can be separated into their individual isomers, e.g. diastereomers or enantiomers, or into any mixtures of isomers, e.g. racemates or diastereomeric mixtures.<br>
The invention relates also to those forms of the process in which one starts from a compound obtainable at any stage as a transient and carries out the missing steps, or breaks off the<br><br>
process at any slage, or forms a starting material under the reaction conditions, or uses said starting material in the form of a reactive derivative or salt, or produces a compound obtainable by means of ttie process according to the invention and processes the said compound in situ.

The pharmaceutical compositions may be sterilized and/or may comprise excipients, for example preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents and/or emulsifiers, solubilizers, salts for regulating osmotic pressure and/or buffers and are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional dissolving and lyophilizing processes. The said solutions or suspensions may comprise viscosity-increasing agents, typically sodium carboxymethyfcellufose, carboxymethylcellulose, dexlran, pofyvinyfpyrrofidone, or gelatins, or also solubilizers, e.g. Tween 80® [polyoxyethylene(20)sorbitan mono-oleate; trlademark of ICI Americas, Inc. USA].<br>
Suspensions in oil comprise as the oil component the vegetable, synthetic, or semi-synthetic oils customary for injection purposes. In respect of such, special mention may be made of liquid fatty acid esters that contain as the acid component a long-chained fatty acid having from 8 to 22, especially from 12 to 22, carbon atoms, for example lauric acid, tridecylic acid, myrislic acid, pentadecylic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, aracbidJc acid, behenic acid or corresponding unsaturated acids, for example oleic acid, elaidic acid, erucic acid, brassidic acid or linoieic acid, if desired with the addition of antioxidants, for example vitamin E, p-carotene or 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene. The alcohol component of these fatty acid esters has a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and is a monovalent or polyvalent, for example a mono-, di- or trivalent, alcohol, for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or pentanol or the isomers thereof, but especially glycol and glycerol. As fatty acid esters, therefore, the following are mentioned: ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, "Labratii M 2375" (polyoxyethylene glycerol trioleate from Gattefosse, Paris), "Labrafll M 1944 CS" (unsaturated polyglycoiized glycerides prepared by alcoholysis of apricot kernel oil and consisting of glycerides and polyethylene glycol ester; Gattefosse, France), "Labrasoi" (saturated polyglycoiized glycerides prepared by alcoholysis of TOM and consisting of glycerides and polyethylene glycol ester; Gattefosse, France), and/or "Miglyol 812" (triglyceride of saturated fatty acids of chain length OB to C12 from Huls AG, Germany), but especially vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, almond oil, olive oil, castor oil, sesame oil, soybean oil and more especially groundnut oil.<br>
The manufacture of injectable preparations is usually carried out under sterile conditions, as is the filling, for example, into ampoules or vials, and the sealing of the containers.<br><br>
pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained, for example, by combining the active ingredient with one or more solid carriers, if desired granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary, by the inclusion of additional excipients, to form tablets or tablet cores.<br>
Suitable carriers are especially fillers, such as sugars, for example lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations, and/or calcium pfiosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and also binders, such as starches, for example corn, wheat, rice or potato starch, methytcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium carboxymelhylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or, if desired, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxymethyl starch, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Additional excipients are especially flow conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol, or derivatives thereof.<br>
Tablet cores can be provided with suitable, optionally enteric, coatings through the use of, inter alia, concentrated sugar solutions which may comprise gum arable, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coalings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Dyes or pigments may be added to the tablets or tablet coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration also include hard capsules consisting of gelatin, and also soft, sealed capsules consisting of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The hard capsules may contain the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with tillers, such as corn starch, binders, and/or glidants, such as taic or magnesium stearate, and optionally stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquid excipients, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols or fatty acid esters of ethylene or propylene glycol, to which stabilizers and detergents, for example of the polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester type, may also be added.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for rectal administration are, for example, suppositories that consist of a combination of the active ingredient and a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, paraffin hydrocarbons, polyethylene glycols or higher alkanols.<br>
For parenteral administration, aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example of a water-soluble salt, or aqueous injection suspensions that contain viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and, if desired, stabilizers, are especially suitable. The active ingredient, optionally together with excipients, can also be in the form of a lyophilizate and can be made into a solution before parenteral administration by the addition of suitable solvents.<br>
Solutions such as are used, for example, for parenteral administration can also be employed as infusion solutions.<br>
Preferred preservatives are, for example, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, or microbicides, such as sorbic acid or benzoic acid.<br>

Example 19 Soft Capsules<br>
5000 soft gelatin capsules, each comprising as active ingredient 0.05 g oJ one of the compounds of formula 1 mentioned in the preceding Examples, are prepared as follows: 250 g pulverized active ingredient is suspended in 2L Laurogiyko!® (propylene glycol laurate, Gatlefosse S.A., Saint Priest, France) and ground in a wet pulverizer to produce a particle size of about 1 to 3 //m. 0.419 g portions of the mixture are then introduced into soft gelatin capsules using a capsule-filling machine.<br>
Example 20 Pharmacokinetic data<br>
The compound of formula 1 to be tested is formulated for administration to female 0F1 mice from IFACREDO, France, by first dissolving in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP), and then by diluting with PEG300 to a final concentration of 10 % v/v NMP: 90 % v/v PEG300, producing a clear solution of the compound. The concentrations were adjusted to deliver a constant volume of 10 mlVkg body weight. The compound is prepared immediately before use. The formulated compound is administered perora/fy by gavage to provide dosages of 50 mg/kg. At the allotted time points mice (4 at each time) are anesthetized with 3 % isoflurane in medical oxygen and blood samples are obtained by heart puncture into heparinized tubes (ca. 30 lU/mL). The animals are subsequently killed without recovering from the anesthetic. Plasma is prepared from the blood by centrifugation (10,000 g, 5 min) and either analyzed immediately or stored frozen at - 70 °C.<br>
The plasma samples (10 -250/yL) are e.g. spiked with S/j of interna! standard, mixed with 200 /;L 0.1 M NaOH and 500 /JL Chloroform in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and shaken vfgorousiy for 10 minutes on an Eppendorf mixer. Thereafter, the mixture is centrlfuged (3 min at 10'OOOxg), the organic phase transferred to a second Eppendorf tube and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge (Speedvac 5301). The dry residue e.g. is dissolved in 250 /yL of 10 % v/v Acetonitrile in water containing 0.1 % formic acid. Tfie subsequent analysis is carried out e.g. by high-pressure liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry<br><br>
(HPLC/MS-MS) using an Agilent 11 oo Series (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) HPLC system with vacuum degasser, binary pump, and thermostated column compartment combined with a cooled autosampler system (HTS PAL, CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland). The sample (5-15 L) is injected e.g. onto an Ultra Phenyl column (particle size 3/jm, 50 x1 mm; Restek, Beflefonte, USA) with a guard column (4x2 mm) of the same material (Phenomenex, Torrance, USA). After equilibration e.g. with water and a latency period of 1 min the sample is eluted e.g. by a linear gradient of o - 100 % acetonitrile in water containing 0.2 % v/v formic acid over a period of 11 min at a flow rate of 60 /yUmtn. The column is prepared for the next sample e.g. by re-equilibrating for 3 min with 100 % water to the starting conditions. The separation is performed e.g. at a column temperature of 40 °C. The column effluent is introduced e.g. directly into the ion source of a triple stage quadropole mass spectrometer (Quattro Ultima™, Micromass, Manchester, UK) controlled by Masslynx"f' 3.5 software (Micromass, Manchester, UK ) using as ionization technique electrospray ionization positive mode (ESI +). The compound is detected by MS/MS following fragmentation of the parent ions. The limit of quantitation is determined at e.g. 0.002 nmol/L. A calibration curve is constructed with known amounts of compound including a fixed amount of internal standard in plasma which is processed as described above. The concentration of unknown samples is calculated from a plot of the peak area ratio of the selected daughter ion of the analyte to the product of its internal standard (ordinate) against the nominal concentration (abscissa). Regression analysis is performed using Quanlynx ™, Masslynx'' software 3.5 (Micromass, Manchester, UK).<br><br>
