				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a packaging container for a group of cigarette packets, a method and a device for manufacturing the same.<br>
Packaging containers for cigarettes - so-called cigarette cartons - consist of a<br>
group of generally ten cigarette packets which are formed in two rows. Large-<br>
area packet sides, namely front side and rear side, here lie beside one another.<br>
The outer wrapping can consist of paper, (thin) cardboard, or (transparent)<br>
plastic film. Packaging containers for other small packets can be configured in<br>
the same way, for example   	<br><br>
packaging   containers   for   packets   of   paper handkerchiefs.<br>
With packets of this or a similar type, there is often the necessity of conveying information to customers or consumers. This information can frequently be of different content or require different languages.<br>
The purpose underlying the invention is so to configure a packaging container for cigarette packets in particular that, with very little outlay, any kind of information instructions or the like, extensive if necessary, can be given.<br>
In fulfilment of this purpose, the packaging container according to the invention is characterised in that inside the packaging container there is disposed at least one separate blank with printing on it, namely a coupon which extends over at least two adjacent cigarette packets.<br>
According to the invention, there is accordingly added to the packaging container a comparatively large-area print carrier or coupon which can extend inside the packaging container on its outer side, especially where there is a wrapping of transparent material. Alternatively or in addition, the coupon can, on a usual packaging container for cigarettes, be positioned between two rows of packets, preferably in the middle.<br><br>
The coupon here extends preferably over three adjacent cigarette packets and is slightly smaller in height than the height of the cigarette packets. In addition, a coupon or print carrier can be configured U-shaped, i.e. can extend cornerwise, in the region of an end wall of the packaging container or in the centre transversely across the two rows of packets.<br>
When a packaging container with a coupon or a print carrier is manufactured, preferably the group of cigarette packets is first assembled and then the blank or coupon led in. The unit is then surrounded by the outer wrapping. Where the coupon is disposed between the rows of packets, according to the invention a number of cigarette packets of an (upper) row of packets corresponding to the dimension of the coupon is raised up, without the cigarette packets leaving the formation of the row of packets. In this way, a gap is produced into which the coupon can be introduced.<br>
The device according to the invention consists of a magazine for the print carriers. Print carriers are taken out of this device in succession and are conveyed by a coupon conveyor into position on the group of cigarette packets or between the rows of same.<br>
Further details of the invention relate to the design of the packaging container, the method for manufacturing same and to the device for leading in and<br><br>
introducing the print carrier into the packaging container.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a packaging container for a group of cigarette packs which is surrounded by an outer wrapping made of paper, (thin) cardboard, foil or other packaging material, characterized in that there is disposed within the packaging container at least one separate blank with printing, especially a coupon, which extends over at least two adjacent cigarette packets.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of manufacturing packaging containers for a group of cigarette packets which is surrounded by an outer wrapping, the formed group of cigarette packets being movable transversely to a blank of the outer wrapping, taking the latter with them, in such a way that the bland of the outer wrapping is laid, in a first folding operation, U-shaped around the group of cigarette packets, characterized in that the blank or coupon is attached to the group of cigarette packets in a relative position corresponding to the completed packaging container, and then the unit consisting of cigarette packets and coupon is led to the blank of the outer wrapping.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a device for manufacturing containers for a group of cigarette packets which is surrounded by an outer wrapping, a blank for the outer wrapping being held ready in a vertical plane, and a group of cigarette packets, corresponding to the contents of the packaging container, being able to be moved transversely to the outer wrapping, in such a way that said outer wrapping is laid in a U-shape around the group of cigarette packets, characterized by a coupon assembly for transferring individual coupons to the group of cigarette packets, the coupon assembly having a coupon dispenser which leads individual coupons to the groups of packets in a conveying plane which is oriented obliquely downwards.<br><br>

packaging container according to Fig. 12<br>
The drawings relate to so-called cigarette cartons. A group of cigarette packets 10 - in the present case embodied as hinge-lid packets - is surrounded on all sides by an outer wrapping 11. The outer wrapping 11 can, for example, consist of a blank 19 as per Fig. 5.<br><br>
This in turn is formed from (thin) cardboard. Alternatively, the outer wrapping 11 can consist of paper or foil, or also of transparent plastic film,<br>
The cigarette packets 10 are disposed in an ordered formation, namely in two rows of packets 12, 13. Inside the two rows of packets 12, 13, adjacent cigarette packets 10 lie from packet row 12 to packet row 13 with large-area front sides 14 and rear sides 15 against one another. The hinge-lid packets consist of a packet portion 16 and a lid 17. Inside a row of packets 12, 13, the cigarette packets 10 lie with upright narrow side surfaces 18 against one another.<br>
The group consisting of ten cigarette packets 10 - five cigarette packets in each row of packets 12, 13 - is wrapped by the blank 19 in such a way that a front wall 20, rear wall 21, side walls 22, 23 and end walls 24, 25 are produced. In the region of a side wall 22, the outer wrapping 11 is provided with a seal. The latter consists, on the present embodiment, of overlapping the side wall 22 with a connecting flap 26. Side wall 22 and connecting flap 26 are connected to one another by gluing. If a tax mark is to be applied to a base surface 27 of the cigarette packets 10 which face the side wall 22, the side wall 22 is to this end detached from the connecting flap 26 and the outer wrapping 11<br>
opened in this way.   In this case, a corresponding adhesive is used  ('stick-no-stick') ,   On cigarette<br><br>
packets 10 embodied as hinge-lid packets, with a configuration of the packaging container of this kind, the lid 17 faces the opposite closed side wall 23,<br>
On the blank 19 according to Fig. 5, the end walls 24, 25 consist of end wall flaps 28, 29 configured in a special way. The cigarette packets 10 are so positioned that the lids 17 face away from the closing side (side wall 22).<br>
Inside the packaging container there is disposed a print carrier formed from a separate blank, which is referred to below as a "coupon" 30. This is a rectangular thin-walled blank, made especially of paper or (thin) cardboard. The coupon 30 can be provided on one side or on both sides with printing. The printing is particularly information, advertising or even decorative. The coupon 30 can be used as a voucher for participating in competitions.<br>
According to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the coupon 30 is positioned between the front wall 20 of the outer wrapping 11 and the group of cigarette packets 10. The coupon 30 is here of such dimensions that it extends approximately over the height of the packaging container, i.e. over the height of the cigarette packets 10. In the longitudinal direction, the rectangular coupon is greater than an individual cigarette packet 10 or than the front side 14 of same.<br><br>
What is advantageous is a dimension in which the coupon 30 extends approximately over three cigarette packets 10 or over three front sides 14 of same. The coupon 30, in relation to the longitudinal extension of the packaging container, is disposed centrally inside same.<br>
On the design according to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the coupon 30 is disposed between the two rows of packets 12, 13. The relative position is chosen to be such that the coupon 30 is positioned in the middle of a gap between the rows of packets 12, 13, and extends approximately over three cigarette packets 10 at a height which is slightly smaller than the height of the cigarette packets.<br>
The coupon 30 is preferably disposed loose inside the packaging container, i.e. is not glued to the outer wrapping 11 or the cigarette packets 10. When the packaging container is opened, the coupon 30 can be taken out and used as appropriate.<br>
The procedure during the manufacture of the packaging container is expediently such that first of all the cigarette packets 10 are arranged in the formation of the packaging container, then the coupon 30 is applied in the correct position on the cigarette packets 10, and then the unit consisting of cigarette packets 10<br>
and coupon 30 is wrapped in the blank 19.<br><br>
The device according to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 can be used for the manufacture of a packaging container according to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.   The cigarette packets 10 are transported in as a continuous line of packets 31 in two rows of packets lying one above the other 12, 13 -corresponding  to  their  position  in  the  packaging container.  In the region of a platform 32, a group of cigarette packets 10, corresponding to the contents of the packaging container, is expelled by a slide 33 in a transverse  direction.    The  blank  19  is  held  in readiness parallel to the line of packets 31 and thus transversely to the expulsion direction of the slide 33,  in an upright plane.   The group of cigarette packets 10 is conveyed through the plane of the blank 19, said blank being caught up by the cigarette packets 10.  By being inserted into an upper guide 34 and a lower guide 35,  the blank 19 is laid in a U-shape around the group of cigarette packets 10.  The lids 17 of the cigarette packets 10, pointing forwards in the direction of expulsion, are here adjacent to the side wall 23.<br>
Before the group of cigarette packets 10 is expelled transversely, the coupon 30 is led in and placed in the correct position on the upper side of the cigarette packets 10 which are to be expelled. To this end, there is arranged above the platform 32 or above the line 31 of cigarette packets 10, a coupon assembly 36. This consists of a coupon magazine 37 in which the<br><br>
prepared coupons 30 are stacked above one another. On the lower side, the coupons 30 can be taken out individually by a removal conveyor 38 in conjunction with a counter roller 39.<br>
The coupons 30 removed from the coupon magazine 37 are transferred to a coupon dispenser 40.   The latter consists of two conveyer belts 41, 42.  The coupon 30 is transported between facing bights.   The conveyor belts 41, 42 or their hoistways, are inclined downwards in the conveying direction.  The coupon 30 is therefore transported in a plane which is inclined obliquely downwards, in a direction towards the upper side of the cigarette packets 10.   The relative position of the coupon dispenser 40 is chosen to be such that the coupon 30 is laid in the described relative position on the upper side of three adjacent cigarette packets 10. Thereafter, the unit consisting of cigarette packets 10 and coupon 30 is dispelled in the described manner to be wrapped up in the blank 19.<br>
The device according to Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 is specially suitable for positioning coupons 30 in the manner of the embodiment according to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Here, too, the procedure is that the coupon 30 is first applied, in the correct position for the packet, to the group of cigarette packets 10 and then the unit consisting of cigarette packets 10 and coupon 30 is led<br><br>
to the blank which is held in readiness for the outer wrapping 11.<br>
As can be seen especially from Fig. 10, the line of packets 31 is led to an expulsion station 43 in the region of the platform 32. A coupon station 44 is placed in front of the expulsion station 43 in the direction of conveying. In the region of said coupon station, the coupon 30 is in each case applied in the required position, namely between the cigarette packets 10 of the rows of packets 12, 13.<br>
To this end, the cigarette packets 10 in the two rows<br>
12, 13 are moved intermittently away from one another<br>
in the region of the coupon station 44, such that an<br>
insertion gap 45 for the coupon 30 is formed, open at<br>
the side.   To this  end,  the necessary number of<br>
cigarette packets 10 - in the present case three - of<br>
the upper row of packets 12 is lifted from the lower<br>
row of packets 13.  The (three) cigarette packets 10<br>
are here moved into an inclined position, such that a<br>
wedge- or funnel-shaped insertion gap 45 is formed.<br>
The cigarette packets, however, do not here leave the<br>
formation of the line of packets 31 or the row of<br>
packets 12.  Rather, the raised cigarette packets 10<br>
remain  between  the  remaining  horizontally-aligned<br>
packets of the row of packets.<br><br>
Adjacent to the insertion gap 45 thus formed is disposed the coupon assembly 3 6 in the embodiment described. The coupon dispenser 40 is positioned directly adjacent to the rows of packets 12, 13 lying above one another, in a relative position such that a coupon 30 led in reaches the insertion gap 45 and thus the desired position between the two rows of packets 12, 13. The raised cigarette packets 10 of the upper row 12 are moved back into their normal position after the coupon 30 has been inserted.<br>
In the region of the coupon station 44 there is located, above the rows of packets 12, 13, a lifting member, namely a lifting head 46 to which suction air can be applied. This head is of such dimensions that respectively three adjacent cigarette packets 10 within row 12 are grasped and lifted up in one lifting operation. The lifting head 46 is attached to a swivel arm 47, which in turn is connected with a control mechanism 48.<br>
The line of packets 31 formed from the rows of packets 12, 13 is transported on a conveyer, for example on a belt 49. Stationary side guides 50, 51 are disposed at the side. On the side facing the coupon assembly 3 6, the side guide 51 is interrupted or provided with an aperture 52 which makes it possible for the coupon 30 to pass through.<br><br>
A further embodiment for the design of a packaging container for cigarettes arises from Fig, 11 and Fig. 13. A longish rectangular coupon 30 is positioned in the region of an end wall 24 of the elongated container between the outer wrapping 11 and the group of cigarette packets 10, "cornerwise". The coupon 30 is disposed in a U-shape, half-way up or in the centre of the end wall 24. A web 53 extends transversely over the end wall 24, i.e. over side surfaces 18 of two adjacent cigarette packets 10. One leg 54 each of the U-shape is located in the region of a front side 14 or rear side 15 of the end cigarette packets 10.<br>
On the embodiment according to Fig. 12 and Fig. 14, a coupon 30 is positioned on the inner side,  in the region of a long side, i.e. in the region of an (upper) side wall 22 of the outer wrapping 11.   This coupon, also, is folded in rectangular fashion, stretched out and in a U-shape over the two rows of packets 12, 13, A web 56 extends in the region of the side wall 22, i.e. over the base surface or end surface of adjacent cigarette packets 10 of the two rows 12, 13.  Arms 57, 58 are located in the region of the front side 14 or rear  side  15,  pointing  outwards,  of  the  relevant cigarette  packets  10.    A  special  characteristic consists in the fact that, on the embodiment of Fig. 12 and Fig. 14, the coupon 13 is positioned in an inclined<br>
position.  Edges of the coupon 30 are arranged at an (acute) angle to the delimitations or surfaces of the<br><br>
cigarette packets 10.  The coupon is preferably located in the middle of the side wall 22.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
