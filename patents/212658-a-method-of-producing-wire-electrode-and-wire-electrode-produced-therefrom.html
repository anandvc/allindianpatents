				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a wire electrode and to a process for producing a wire electrode, especially for the spark erosion process, with a single-layer or multilayer core, the outer layer of which consists of copper or a copper/zinc alloy having a predominant alpha phase fraction, and with a sheath layer consisting of a zinc or a zinc alloy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wire electrodes for the spark erosion process are produced, as a rule, with a high-strength core which, moreover, should also be a good electric conductor. Cores made from brass or composite cores, in which a steel nucleus is surrounded by the copper or brass layer, have proved appropriate for producing high strength. To increase the cutting capacity of wire electrodes of this type, a sheath layer, which consists, as a rule, of zinc or a zinc alloy, is coated onto these. Very good cutting capacities have been achieved with wire electrodes provided with a pure zinc coating. However, the cutting capacity of these electrodes decreases when tall workpieces are to be cut. The reason for this is that the pure zinc of the sheath layer evaporates rapidly and is therefore consumed in a very short "cirne, so that the wire electrode then cuts with its core material, thus again reducing the cutting capacity as a whole.<br>
Tests have shown that, where tall workpieces are concerned, better cutting capacities are achieved when the zinc of the sheath layer is a constituent of an alloy. It has proved advantageous, here, to produce the sheath layer from a homogeneous beta brass. An electrode of this type has a very good cutting capacity even in the case of tall workpieces. A disadvantage, however, is that such an electrode is relatively cost-intensive to<br>
produce. In this case, on the one hand, an accurate alloy composition of the core must be maintained and, on the other hand, diffusion has to be carried out over a long period of time at high temperature in order to achieve a state of equilibrium. This state subsequently has to be fixed by rapid cooling. It is extremely difficult here, in this known process, to control the phase fractions in the sheath layer accurately. Slight deviations in the production process lead to the presence also of alpha and/or gamma brass in the sheath layer in addition to the beta brass.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
On the one hand, the object on which the invention is based is to design a wire electrode of the type initially mentioned, in such a way that it has an even better cutting capacity than a wire electrode with a sheath layer consisting of a pure beta phase, and, on the other hand, the object on which the invention is based is to propose a process for producing wire electrodes, by which process sheath layers consisting essentially of homogeneous gamma or epsilon brass can be cost-effectively produced.<br>
This object is achieved, as regards the process, by means of the features of claim 1. The wire electrode is defined by the features of claims 7 and 8. The outer sheath layer consists of a gamma or epsilon phase. Advantageously, inert hard phases can also be intercalated into the gamma or epsilon phase, thus affording the advantage that the erosion and discharge behavior of the eroding wire for the eroded materials is further improved.<br>
The choice of a pure gamma phase, to which, where appropriate, hard inert materials are added, has proved even more advantageous than the beta phase in terms of cutting behavior. With conventional processes, that is to say long-time diffusion, it is scarcely possible to produce such a gamma phase in pure form. As a rule, a<br>
mixed structure having fractions of the alpha, beta and/or gamma phase is obtained.<br>
The invention proposes a process for producing homogeneous sheath layers from gamma or epsilon brass, which utilizes states of non-equilibrium as a result of extremely short diffusion times which are caused by a high heating and a high cooling speed and by a comparatively short holding time. Surprisingly, epsilon brass first forms, then gamma brass, the gamma brass in the sheath layer having a considerably higher growth rate than beta brass which, insofar as it forms at all in the short diffusion times proposed by the invention, then experiences merely a fraction of the growth of the gamma phase. The beta phases remain, in practice, below the detection limit and are revealed merely as very small margins which delimit relative to the core region the gamma phase extending over the entire sheath layer. By means of this process according to the invention, it is thus possible to produce pure epsilon or gamma phases even in wire electrodes which, in the case of conventional diffusion annealing, would exhibit a juxtaposition of alpha, beta and gamma phases. Example 1:<br>
Core: CuZn 5; galvanizing 30 µm at l.o mm;<br>
Drawing from 1.0 to 0.40 mm;<br>
Annealing: heating at 200 K/s,<br>
Annealing temperature = 600°C<br>
Cooling speed = 300 K/sec;<br>
Drawing from 0.40 to 0.25 mm Example 2:<br>
Core: CuZn 5; galvanizing 30 µm at 1.2 mm;<br>
Drawing from 1.2 to 0.60 mm;<br>
Annealing: heating at 40 K/s,<br>
Annealing temperature = 800°C<br>
cooling speed =60 K/sec;<br>
Drawing from 0.60 to 0.25 mm<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OP THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is described below with reference to the drawings in which: Figure 1 shows a section through an eroding wire<br>
designed according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2  shows an enlarged representation of the cletail of the sheath layer and of the core according to Figure l;<br>
Figures 3<br>
to 7 show the layers in the edge zone which<br>
form as a function of the annealing time.<br>
Figure 2 represents the starting material. This consists of a core of alpha brass and a sheath layer of zinc (eta zinc) . After heating has taken places and after the shortest possible holding time, an epsilon zinc layer forms in the region between the core, and sheath layer (Figure 3), the etazinc layer transforming into an epsilon zinc layer during an increasing annealing time and therefore increasing diffusion (Figure 4) . It is<br>
possible, in Figure 4, to see at the same time that a<br>
narrow layer, specifically a gamma layer, forms in the<br>
transitional region between the core. and epsilon zinc layer. While continuing annealing time, the gamma/layer<br>
expands, so that the epsilon zinc layer is <br>
transformed into a gamma layer as a result of the<br>
diffusion processes. A arrow beta brass layer forms at a substantially lower growth rate in the transitional region between the gamma brass layer and the alpha brass<br><br>
core (Figure 6).<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the moment, at which the sheath layer is transformed into a gamma brass layer, with the<br>
beta sheath layer growing only slightly larger in the transitional region between the core, and gamma sheath 6 layer with respect to the stage represented in Figure 6.<br>
Figure 7<br>
illustrates the end of the time sequence, in which the n-zinc layer is largely decomposed and beta crystals to form a thin layer around the core.<br>
The constitution according to the invention of epsilon, gamma or beta sheath layers involves utilizing the states of non-equilibrium during the diffusion process and then interrupting  the diffusion process and thus fixing the states of non-equilibrium when the particular sheath layer desired is produced. When this state is reached, the structure must be fixed by rapid cooling.<br>
