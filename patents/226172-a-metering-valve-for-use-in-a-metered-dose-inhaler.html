				<td>A METERING VALVE FOR USE IN A METERED DOSE INHALER<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to medical devices as well as methods of making and using same. The medical<br>
devices are useful in the treatment of respiratory or other disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of aerosols to administer medicaments has been known for several decades. Such aerosols generally<br>
comprise one or more medicaments, one or more propellants and optionally one or more additives, for example a<br>
surfactant or a co-solvent, such as ethanol. Historically the most commonly used aerosol propellants for<br>
medicaments have been propellant 11 (CCl3F), propellant 114 (CF2ClCF2Cl), propellant 12 (CCl2F2) or<br>
combinations of those. However release of those propellants into the atmosphere is now believed to contribute<br>
to the degradation of stratospheric ozone and there is thus a need to provide aerosol formulations for<br>
medicaments which employ so called "ozone-friendly" propellants.<br>
Containers for aerosol formulations commonly comprise a vial body (e.g., can or canister) coupled to a valve.<br>
The valve comprises a valve stem through which the formulations are dispensed. Generally the valve includes<br>
one or more rubber valve seals intended to allow reciprocal movement of the valve stem which prevents leakage<br>
of propellant from the container. Metered dose inhalers comprise a valve which is designed to deliver a metered<br>
amount of an aerosol formulation to the recipient per actuation. Such a metering valve generally comprises a<br>
metering chamber which is of a pre-determined volume and which causes the dose per actuation to be an<br>
accurate, pre-determined amount.<br>
The metering valve in a container is typically coupled to the canister with contact through a sealing gasket to<br>
prevent leakage of propellant and/or drug substance out of the container at the join. The gasket typically<br>
comprises an elastomeric material, for example low density polyethylene, chlorobutyl, acrylonitrile butadiene<br>
rubbers, butyl rubber, a polymer of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), neoprene or chloroprene. Such<br>
elastomeric materials may be carbon-black or mineral filled.<br><br>
Valves for use in MDIs are available from various manufactures known in the aerosol industry; for example<br>
from Valois, France (e.g. DF10, DF30, DF60), Bespak plc, UK (e.g. BK300, BK356, BK357) or 3M-Neotechnic<br>
Limited, UK (e.g. SpraymiserTM). The metering valves are used in association with commercially available<br>
canisters, for example metal canisters, for example aluminium canisters, suitable for delivering pharmaceutical<br>
aerosol formulations.<br>
MDIs incorporating a valve seal or a sealing gasket as described above generally perform adequately with CFC<br>
propellants, such as propellant 11 (CCl3F), propellant 114 (CF2ClCF2Cl), propellant 12 (CCl2F2). However,<br>
as mentioned above, there is a requirement to substitute so-called ozone-friendly propellants for CFC propellants<br>
in aerosols. A class of propellants which are believed to have minimal ozone-depleting effects in comparison to<br>
conventional chlorofluorocarbons comprise fluorocarbons and hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbons. That<br>
class includes, but is not limited to hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs), for example 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane<br>
(HFA134a), 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane (HFA 227) and mixtures thereof. However, various problems<br>
have arisen with pharmaceutical aerosol formulations prepared using HFA propellants, in particular with regard<br>
to the stability of the formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical aerosol formulations generally comprise a solution or a suspension. A mixture of a suspension<br>
and a small amount of dissolved medicament is also possible, but generally undesirable (as described below).<br>
Some solution formulations have the disadvantage that the drug substance contained therein is more susceptible<br>
to degradation than when in solid form. Furthermore, solution formulations may be associated with problems in<br>
controlling the size of the droplets which in turn affects the therapeutic profile. Suspension formulations are<br>
thus generally preferred.<br>
To obtain regulatory approval, pharmaceutical aerosol formulation products must satisfy strict specifications.<br>
One parameter that must generally be satisfied, and for which a level is usually specified, is the fine particle<br>
mass (FPM). The FPM is a measure of the amount of drug that has the potential to reach the inner lungs (the<br>
small bronchioles and alveoli) based on the proportion of drug particles with a diameter within a certain range,<br>
usually less than 5 microns. The FPM of an actuation from an MDI is generally calculated on the basis of the<br>
sum of the amount of drug substance deposited on stages 3,4 and 5 of an Andersen Cascade Impaction stack as<br><br>
determined by standard HPLC analysis. Potential side effects are minimised and a smaller amount of drug<br>
substance is wasted if the FPM constitutes as large as possible a percentage of the total mass of drug.<br>
In suspension formulations, particle size of the emitted dose is generally controlled during manufecture by the<br>
size to which the solid medicament is reduced, usually by micronisation. During storage of some drug<br>
suspensions in an HFA, however, various changes have been found to take place which have the effect of<br>
reducing FPM. A drop in FPM means that the therapeutically effective amount of drug available to the patient is<br>
reduced. That is undesirable and may ultimately impact on the effectiveness of the medication. That problem is<br>
particularly acute when the dose due to be dispensed is low, which is the case for certain potent drugs such as<br>
long acting beta agonists, which are bronchodilators.<br>
Various mechanisms have been proposed by which the reduction in FPM may be taking place: particle size<br>
growth may occur if the suspended drug has a sufficient solubility in propellant, a process known as Ostwald<br>
Ripening. Alternatively, or additionally, small particles may have the tendency to aggregate or adhere to parts of<br>
the inside of the MD1, for example the canister or valve. Small particles may also become absorbed into or<br>
adsorbed onto rubber components of the valve. As adherence and absorption processes are more prevalent<br>
amongst small particles, those processes may lead to a decrease in FPM as a fraction of the administered drug as<br>
well as a reduction in the total drug content (TDC) of the canister available to patient. It has further been found<br>
that the adherence and absorption processes may not only result in loss of available drug, but may also adversely<br>
affect the function of the device, resulting in the valve sticking or orifices becoming blocked.<br>
It is essential that the prescribed dose of aerosol medication delivered from the MDI to the patient consistently<br>
meets the specifications claimed by the manufacturer and complies with the requirements of me FDA and other<br>
regulatory authorities. That is, every dose dispensed from the MDI must be the same within close tolerances.<br>
Therefore it is important that the formulation be substantially homogenous throughout the canister and the<br>
administered dose at the time of actuation of the metering valve and that it remains substantially the same even<br>
after storage.<br><br>
Various approaches have been taken to address the problems mentioned above. One approach is the addition of<br>
one or more adjuvants to me drug suspension; for example adjuvants selected from alcohols, alkanes, dimethyl<br>
ether, surfactants (e.g. fluorinated or non-fluorinated surfactants, carboxylic acids, polyethoxylates, etc.) and<br>
even conventional chlorofluorocarbon propellants in small amounts (at levels intended to keep to a minimum<br>
potential ozone damage) have been shown to have some effect in mitigating the FPM problems. Such<br>
approaches have been disclosed, for example, in EP0372777, WO91/04011, WO91/11173, WO91/11495 and<br>
WO91/14422. WO92/00061 discloses non-fluorinated surfactants for use with fluorocarbon propellants.<br>
Fluorinated surfactants may be used to stabilise micronised drug suspensions in fluorocarbon propellants such as<br>
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (P134a) or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane (P227), see for example US4,352,789,<br>
US5,126.123, US5,376.359, US application 09/580,008, WO91/11173, WO91/14422, WO92/00062 and<br>
WO96/09816.<br>
In WO96/32345, WO96/32151, WO96/32150 and WO96/32099 there are disclosed aerosol canisters coated with<br>
one or more fluorocarbon polymers, optionally in combination with one or more non-fluorocarbon polymers,<br>
that reduce the deposition on the canister walls of drug particles of the pharmaceutical alternative propellant<br>
aerosol formulation contained therein.<br>
In WO 03/049786 it is described that deposition of drag on an elastomeric seal, and several other problems<br>
associated with lubrication, flexibility and sealing ability of an elastomeric seal may be overcome by the<br>
addition of an organotitanium low friction barrier coating to the seal surface. A pre-treatment step in which the<br>
elastomeric seal is treated as follows is also disclosed therein: the elastomeric substrate is provided in a bath<br>
comprising an alcohol and an alkaline material at a bath temperature effective for treatment, ultrasonic energy is<br>
provided to the bath at a treatment effective frequency and power level for a time sufficient to treat the<br>
elastomeric substrate, the treated elastomeric substrate is rinsed with de-ionised water; and the treated and rinsed<br>
elastomeric substrate is dried. The pre-treatment step is said to permit superior adhesion and bonding of the<br>
organotitanium-based coating. In general, however, additional material coating steps add to the expense of<br>
manufacturing the final drug product and the presence of a coating may cause additional toxicity and safety tests<br>
to be necessary.<br><br>
The present invention is concerned with medical devices and portions thereof, such as metered dose inhalers<br>
and/or metering valves, that may provide improved stability of pharmaceutical formulations contained therein.<br>

where appropriate, the one or more medicaments may be used in the form of salts, (e.g. as alkali metal or amine<br>
salts or as acid addition salts) or as esters (e.g. lower alkyl esters) or as solvates (e.g. hydrates). In some<br>
embodiments, the one or more medicaments may be used in the form of salts, esters, or solvates to optimise the<br>
activity and/or stability of the medicament and/or to minimise the solubility of the medicament in the propellant.<br>
Where applicable, the one or more medicaments may be used in the form of racemate (in equal or unequal<br>
proportions) or in the form of a pure isomer, e.g. R-salmeterol or S-salmeterol.<br>
In some embodiments according to the present invention, the pharmaceutical formulation includes two or more<br>
of the medicaments described above, preferably 2,3, or 4 of the medicaments described above, more preferably<br>
2 or 3 of the medicaments described above, and still more preferably 2 of the medicaments described above. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the two or more medicaments are selected from the group consisting of a<br>
bronchodilator, an anti-inflammatory, an anticholinergic, and an antiallergic. In more preferred embodiments,<br>
the medicaments in the pharmaceutical formulation consist of a bronchodilator and an anti-inflammatory. The<br>
bronchodilator is preferably salbutamol (e.g., as the free base or the sulphate salt), salmeterol (e.g., as the<br>
xinafoate salt), or formoterol (e.g., as the fumarate salt). The anti-inflammatory is preferably beclomethasone<br>
(e.g., as the dipropionate ester), fiuticasone (e.g., as the propionate ester) or budesonide. Combinations of<br>
salmeterol xinafoate and fiuticasone propionate or beclomethasone dipropionate, or salbutamol and fiuticasone<br>
propionate or beclomethasone dipropionate are preferred, with salmeterol xinafoate and fiuticasone priopionate<br>
or salbutamol and beclomethasone dipropionate being particularly preferred.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation includes a combination of salmeterol xinafoate and<br>
fluticasone propionate and no further medicament substances are present.<br>
The medicament is preferably present in the pharmaceutical formulation as a particulate medicament. The<br>
particle size of the particulate (e.g. micronised) medicament should be such as to permit inhalation of<br>
substantially all of the medicament into the lungs upon administration of the aerosol formulation and will thus be<br>
less than 100 microns, desirably less than 20 microns, and preferably in the range 1-10 microns, e.g. 1-5<br>
microns.<br>
The concentration of medicament in the formulation will generally be 0.01 -10% such as 0.01 -2%, particularly<br>
0.01-1%, especially 0.03-0.25% w/w. When salmeterol xinafoate is the only medicament, its concentration in<br>
the formulation will generally be 0.03-0.15% w/w.<br>
Aerosol pharmaceutical formulations according to embodiments of the present invention will include a<br>
propellant The propellant may be selected from various propellents suitable for use in aerosol pharmaceutical<br>
formulations as will be understood by those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, chlorofluorocarbon<br>
and hydrofluorocarbon propellents. The propellant is preferably a hydrofluorocarbon propellant selected from<br>
the group consisting of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a), 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafJuoro-n-propane (HFA 227)<br>
and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the propellant is a single propellant selected from HFA 134a and<br>
HFA 227. In other embodiments, the propellant is HFA 134a. While chlorofluorocarbon propellents may be<br>
utilized in aerosol pharmaceutical formulations according to the present invention, it is desirable that the<br>
formulations of the invention contain no components which may provoke the degradation of stratospheric ozone.<br>
In particular it is desirable that the formulations are substantially free of chlorofiuorocarbons such as CC13F,<br>
CC12F2 and CF3CC13. If desired the propellant may additionally contain a volatile adjuvant such as a saturated<br>
hydrocarbon, for example, propane, n-butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane or a dialkyl ether, for example,<br>
dimethyl ether. In general, up to 50% w/w of me propellant may comprise a volatile hydrocarbon, for example 1<br>
to 30% w/w. However, formulations which are substantially free of volatile adjuvants are preferred. In certain<br><br>
cases, it may be desirable to include appropriate amounts of water, which can be advantageous in modifying the<br>
dielectric properties of the propellant.<br>
The formulations according to the present invention may optionally contain one or more further ingredients<br>
conventionally used in the art of pharmaceutical aerosol formulation. Such optional ingredients include, but are<br>
not limited to, taste masking agents, sugars, buffers, antioxidants, water and chemical stabilisers.<br>
Polar adjuvants which may, if desired, be incorporated into die formulations according to the present invention<br>
include, for example, C2-6aliphatic alcohols and polyols such as ethanol, isopropanol and propylene glycol and<br>
mixtures thereof. Preferably, ethanol will be employed. In general only small quantities (e.g. 0.05 to 3.0% w/w)<br>
of polar adjuvants are required and the use of quantities in excess of 5% w/w may disadvantageously tend to<br>
dissolve the medicament. Formulations preferably contain less than 1% w/w, for example, about 0.1% w/w of<br>
polar adjuvant. Polarity may be determined, for example, by the method described in European Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 0327777. In some embodiments, it is desirable that the formulations of the<br>
invention are substantially free of polar adjuvants. "Substantially free" will generally be understood to mean<br>
containing less than 0.01% especially less than 0.0001% based on weight of formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation may include a suitable surfactant. However, it is preferable that the<br>
formulations of the invention are substantially free of surfactant<br>
The formulations for use in the invention may be prepared by dispersal of the medicament in the selected<br>
propellant in an appropriate container, for example, with the aid of sonication or a high-shear mixer. The<br>
process is desirably carried out under controlled humidity conditions.<br>
According to some embodiments of the present invention, a method of making a medicament dispenser includes<br>
filling a sealed container, such as the sealed container 20, with an aerosol pharmaceutical formulation to provide<br>
a medicament dispenser. The filling operation may be performed utilizing conventional bulk manufacturing<br>
methods and machinery well known to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical aerosol manufacture for the<br>
preparation of large scale batches for the commercial production of filled canisters. The particulate medicament<br><br>
is added to a charge vessel and liquefied propellant is pressure filled through the charge vessel into a<br>
manufacturing vessel, together with liquefied propellant containing the surfactant. The drug suspension is mixed<br>
before recirculation to a filling machine and an aliquot of the drug suspension is then filled through the metering<br>
valve into the sealed container.<br>
In an alternative process, an aliquot of the liquefied formulation is added to an open container under conditions<br>
which are sufficiently cold such that the formulation does not vaporise, and then a metering valve crimped onto<br>
the canister.<br>
Typically, in batches prepared for pharmaceutical use, each filled canister is check-weighed, coded with a batch<br>
number and packed into a tray for storage before release testing.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, a sectional view taken along line I-I illustrated in Figure 1 of a lower portion of a<br>
sealed container according to the present invention will be described. A cap 2 covers the open end of a container<br>
20. A cap seal 3 is positioned between the open end of the container 20 and the cap 2. As used herein, the term<br>
"seal" is used interchangeably with the terms "sealing gasket" or "gasket". A- valve body 1 is positioned<br>
adjacent the cap 2. The valve body 1 is formed such that its lower part defines a metering chamber 4, and its<br>
upper part defines a sampling chamber 5, which also acts as a housing for a return spring 6. The words "upper"<br>
and ""lower" are used for the container when it is in a use orientation with the neck of the container 20 and valve<br>
at the lower end of the container which corresponds to the orientation of the valve as shown in Figure 2. The<br>
metering chamber preferably has a volume between 10 and 100 µl, more preferably between 20 and 80 µl. The<br>
valve body may comprise various materials as will be understood by those skilled in the art, including, but not<br>
limited to, plastic and metal materials. Inside the valve body is disposed a valve stem 7, a part 8 of which<br>
extends outside the valve through lower stem seal 9 and cap 2. The upper portion of the valve stem 7 has a<br>
diameter such that it can slide through an opening in an upper stem seal 12 and will engage the periphery of that<br>
opening sufficiently to provide a seal. The valve stem may comprise various materials as will be understood by<br>
those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, plastic and metal materials.<br><br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, the metering valve has an upper stem seal that comprises a<br>
first elastomeric material and a lower stem seal that comprises a second elastomeric material different from the<br>
first elastomeric material. The first elastomeric material may comprise various polymers as will be understood<br>
by those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, low density polyethylene, chlorobutyl, acrylonitrile<br>
butadiene rubbers, butyl rubber, a polymer of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), neoprene, or<br>
chloroprene. The second elastomeric material may comprise various polymers as will be understood by those<br>
skilled in the art including, but not limited to, low density polyethylene, chlorobutyl, acrylonitrile butadiene<br>
rubbers, butyl rubber, a polymer of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), neoprene, or chloroprene.<br>
In some embodiments according to this aspect of the present invention, the first elastomeric material and the<br>
second elastomeric material comprise different polymers. For example, the first elastomeric materiel may<br>
comprise an acrylonitrile butadiene polymer while the second elastomeric material comprises an EPDM<br>
polymer.<br>
In other embodiments according to this aspect of the present invention, the first elastomeric material and the<br>
second elastomeric material comprise the same polymer, but have different extractant profiles. For example, the<br>
first elastomeric material may comprise acrylonitrile butadiene polymer and have a first extractant profile, and<br>
the second elastomeric material may comprise acrylonitrile butadiene polymer and have a second extractant<br>
profile different from the first extractant profile.<br>
As used herein, the term "extractant profile" includes the level of one or more exteactable materials and/or the<br>
gradient of one or more extractable materials taken across the thickness of the seal. Extractable materials<br>
include various compounds typically present in elastomeric gasket materials, which compounds are capable of<br>
being extracted from the materials using an aqeuous or organic solvent. Such compounds include, but are not<br>
i \ limited to, fatty acids, antioxidants, light stabilizing compounds, rubber synthesis byproducts, and other rubber<br>
extractables. More particular examples of such compounds include, but are not limited to, nonylphenol isomers,<br>
2,2'-methylenebis(6-tertbutyl-4-methylpheno]), 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylhept-3-ene, 3'-oxybispropanitrile, oleic<br>
acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. Seals having different extractant profiles may be provided by various<br>
methods as will be understood by those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, the methods described in<br><br>
the co-pending and co-owned U.S. provisional patent application entitled "Pharmaceutical metered dose inhaler<br>
and memods relating thereto" filed August 11,2003 and the methods described in the co-pending and co-owned<br>
U.S. provisional patent application entitled "Pharmaceutical metered dose inhaler and methods relating thereto"<br>
filed July 31,2003. In some embodiments, the level of one or more extrac table materials in the seal is between a<br>
lower limit of 0.001, 0.005, 0.01,0.02,0.03,0.04, 0.05,0.06, 0.07,0.08, 0.09, 0.1,0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35,0.4,<br>

0.07,0.08,0.09,0.1,0.15, 0.2,0.25,0.3,0.35,0.4,0.45,0.5, 0.55,0.6, 0.65,0.7,0.75, 0.8, 0.85,0.9, 0.95,1,2,<br>
3, 4,5,6,7,8,9, or 10 percent (by weight of the seal). In other embodiments, the level of substantially all or all<br>
of the extractable materials in the seal is between these lower and upper limits.<br>
In still other embodiments according to this aspect of the present invention, the first elastomeric material and the<br>
second elastomeric material comprise different polymers and have different extractant profiles.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the cap seal 3 comprises a first elastomeric material and the<br>
lower stem seal 9 and/or upper stem seal 12 comprise a second elastomeric material different from the first<br>
elastomeric material. The first elastomeric material may comprise various polymers as will be understood by<br>
those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, low density polyethylene, chlorobutyl, acrylonitrile<br>
butadiene rubbers, butyl rubber, a polymer of ethylene propylene diene monomer (BPDM), neoprene, or<br>
chloroprene. The second elastomeric material may comprise various polymers as will be understood by those<br>
skilled in the art including, but not limited to, low density polyethylene, chlorobutyl, acrylonitrile butadiene<br>
rubbers, butyl rubber, a polymer of eftylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), neoprene, or chloroprene.<br>
In some embodiments according to this other aspect of the present invention, the first elastomeric material and<br>
the second elastomeric material comprise different polymers. For example, the first elastomeric material may<br>
comprise an acrylonitrile butadiene polymer while the second elastomeric material comprises an BPDM<br>
polymer. As another example, the first elastomeric material may comprise a polymer having a Shore A hardness<br>
of between 45 and 95, preferably between 55 and 85, and more preferably between 60 and 80, while the second<br>
elastomeric material comprises a polymer having a Shore A hardness of between 50 and 95, preferably between<br>
60 and 85, and more preferably between 70 and 75.<br><br>
In other embodiments according to this other aspect of the present invention, the first elastomeric material and<br>
the second elastomeric material comprise the same polymer, but have different extractant profiles. For example,<br>
the first elastomeric material may comprise acrylonitrile butadiene polymer and have a first extractant profile,<br>
and the second elastomeric material may comprise acrylonitrile butadiene polymer and have a second extractant<br>
profile different from the first extractant profile.<br>
In still other embodiments according to this other aspect of the present invention, the first elastomeric material<br>
and the second elastomeric material comprise different polymers and have different extractant profiles.<br>
In some embodiments according to this other aspect of the present invention, the cap seal comprises the first<br>
elastomeric material and the upper stem seal and lower stem seal each comprise the second elastomeric material.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the cap seal comprises an EPDM polymer and the upper stem seal and lower stem<br>
seal each comprise a nitrile polymer, such as acrylonitrile butadiene rubber.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention, the cap seal 3 comprises a first elastametric material,<br>
the lower stem seal 9 comprises a second elastomeric material different from the first elastomeric material, and<br>
the upper stem seal 12 comprises a third elastomeric material different from the first elastomeric material and<br>

have a different extractant profile.<br><br>
In still other embodiments according to this still other aspect of the present invention, the first elastomeric<br>
material, the second elastomeric material, and the third elastomeric material each comprise a different polymer<br>
and have a different extractant profile.<br>
Still referring to Figure 2, the upper stem seal 12 is held in position against a step 13 formed in the valve body 1<br>
between the lower and upper parts by a sleeve 14 which defines the metering chamber 4 between the lower stem<br>
seal 9 and upper stem seal 12. The stem part 8 is formed with an inner axial or longitudinal canal 10 opening at<br>
the outer end of the stem and in communication with a radial passage 11. The valve stem 7 has a passage 15<br>
which, when the stem is in the inoperative position shown, provides fluid communication between the metering<br>
chamber 4 and sampling chamber 5 via orifices 30 and 31, respectively. The sampling chamber 5 is in fluid<br>
communication with the interior of the container 20 via orifice 26 formed in the side of the valve body.<br>
The valve stem 7 is biased downwardly to the inoperative position by the return spring 6 and is provided with a<br>
shoulder 17 which abuts against the lower stem seal 9, In the inoperative position as shown in Figure 2, the<br>
shoulder 17 abuts against the lower stem seal 9 and the radial passage 11 opens below the lower stem seal 9 so<br>
that the metering chamber 4 is isolated from the canal 10 and the pharmaceutical formulation contained within<br>
the container 20 cannot escape.<br>
A ring 18 having a "U" shaped cross section extending in a radial direction is disposed around the valve body<br>
below orifice 26 so as to form a trough 19 around the valve body. As seen in Figure 2, the ring is formed as a<br>
separate component having an inner annular contacting rim of a diameter suitable to provide a friction fit over<br>
the upper part of valve body 1. The ring seats against step 13 below the orifice 26. While the ring 18 is<br>
illustrated in Figure 2 as being separate from the valve body 1, it will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that the ring 18 may alternatively be formed as an integrally molded part of valve body 1. In some<br>
embodiments, the valve stem, the valve body, and/or at least a portion of the metering chamber wall(s) present a<br>
surface to the pharmaceutical formulation to which the one or more medicaments in the pharmaceutical<br>
formulation are non-adherent (e.g., as described in WO99/42154, WO97A6360, and WO99/50156). For<br>
example, the metering chamber (especially when composed of a plastics material) may be surface treated so as<br>
to present a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation. Alternatively the metering chamber (especially<br><br>
when composed of a plastics material) may be surface treated with a siloxane such as dimethyl siloxane. As a<br>
further alternative, the metering chamber presents a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation by virtue<br>
of being composed of a suitable substantially fluorinated material. Suitable metering chambers and surface<br>
treatments for metering chambers are described in WO 02/51483 at page 7, line 15 to page 11, line 18, for<br>
example. Suitable valve stems and surface treatments for valve stems are described in WO 02/51483 at page 11,<br>
line 21 to page 12, line 3, for example.<br>
To use the device illustrated in Figure 2, the sealed container is first shaken to homogenise the suspension<br>
within the container 20. The user then depresses the valve stem 7 against the force of the spring 6. When the<br>
valve stem is depressed, the shoulder 32 on the valve stem 7 comes to rest on a surface 33 of the sleeve 14. The<br>
orifice 30 comes to lie on the side of the upper stem seal 12 remote from the metering chamber 4, thereby<br>
isolating the metering chamber 4 from the sampling chamber 5. The radial passage 11 is moved into the<br>
metering chamber 4, creating fluid communication between the metering chamber 4 and the outlet canal 10 in<br>
the valve stem 7. Thus, the metered dose being held in the metering chamber 4 can exit through the radial<br>
passage 11 and the outlet canal 10.<br>
Releasing the valve stem 7 causes it to return to the illustrated position under the force of the spring 6. The<br>
passage 15 then once again provides fluid communication between the metering chamber 4 and the sampling<br>
chamber 5. Accordingly, at this stage, liquid pharmaceutical formulation passes under pressure from the<br>
container 20 through orifice 26, through orifice 31, through passage 15, through orifice 30, and into the metering<br>
chamber 4 to fill the metering chamber 4.<br>
Metering valves according to embodiments of the present invention may be made by various methods as will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art. According to some embodiments of the present invention, a method of<br>
making a metering valve includes assembling a valve body, a first stem seal that includes a first elastomeric<br>
material, a second stem seal that includes a second elastomeric material different from the first elastomeric<br>
material, and a valve stem to provide a metering valve. The valve body, first stem seal, second stem seal, and<br>
valve stem are preferably similar to or the same as those described above with reference to Figure 2.<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 3, a sectional view of a lower portion of a sealed container according to the present<br>
invention will be described. The elements referred to by reference numerals 102,103,104,105,107,108,109,<br>
111, 112,114,117,120,130,131,132, and 133 are similar to the elements referred to by reference numerals 2,<br>
3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,14,17,20,30,31,32, and 33 described above in Figure 2 and will not be further<br>
described. A valve body 101 is formed such that its lower part defines the metering chamber 104, its upper part<br>
defines the sampling chamber 105, which also acts as a housing for a resilient member 106, and a portion of the<br>
valve body 122 that supports the cap seal 103. The valve body may comprise various materials such as those<br>
described above with reference to the valve body 1 in Figure 1. The resilient member 106 is used to bias the<br>
valve stem 107 towards the upper surface of the lower stem seal 109. The resilient member 106 may comprise<br>
various resilient members as will be understood by those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, a spring,<br>
and a flexible bushing.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, a metered dose inhaler 400 according to embodiments of the present invention will<br>
be described. The metered dose inhaler 400 includes a medicament dispenser comprising a sealed container 410<br>
that is fitted within an actuator housing 440. The sealed container 410 includes a container 420 having an<br>
opening therein with a cap 402 covering the opening in the container 420. A metering valve having a valve stem<br>
408 is positioned within the sealed container 410. The valve stem 408 is engaged with a no2zle block 442,<br>
which is integrally formed with the actuator housing 440. While the nozzle block 442 is illustrated in Figure 4<br>
as being integrally formed with the actuator housing 440, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the<br>
nozzle block may be formed separately from the actuator housing. While the actuator housing 440 is illustrated<br>
as an oral inhalation actuator housing, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that metered dose inhalers<br>
according to the present invention may include other types of actuator housing, such as those designed for nasal<br>
administration, for example. Metered dose inhalers according to embodiments of the present invention are<br>
designed to deliver a fixed unit dosage of medicament per actuation or "puff", for example, in the range of 2.5 to<br>
5000 micrograms of medicament per puff, preferably in the range of from 5.0 to 2500 micrograms per puff.<br>
MDIs taught herein may be prepared by various methods as will be understood by those skilled in the art (e.g.,<br>
see Byron, above and WO/96/32150). According to embodiments of the present invention, a method of making<br>
a metered dose inhaler includes assembling a medicament dispenser according to the present invention, such as<br><br>
the medicament dispenser according to embodiments of the present invention described above, with an actuator<br>
configured to engage the medicament dispenser and dispense a pharmaceutical composition therefrom to provide<br>
the metered dose inhaler. The medicament dispenser may be made by various methods including, but not<br>
limited to, those described above with respect to embodiments of the present invention.<br>
According to some embodiments of the present invention, a method of administering a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a medicament indicated for the treatment of a respiratory disease such as asthma,<br>
rhinitis or COPD to a subject in need thereof includes actuating a metered dose inhaler according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention to administer the pharmaceutical composition to the subject. For example,<br>
referring to Figure 4, a metered dose of the pharmaceutical formulation may be administered from the metered<br>
dose inhaler 400 by the patient placing his/her mouth over the opening in the actuator 444 and pressing the<br>
sealed container 410 into the actuator housing 440 along direction A while inhaling. Pressing the sealed<br>
container 410 into the actuator housing 440 will cause me end of the valve stem 408 to engage the nozzle block,<br>
thus actuating the metering valve in the sealed container 410. A metered dose of the pharmaceutical formulation<br>
will then exit the nozzle block via orifice 443, exit the actuator via a cylindrical or cone-like passage 445<br>
through which medicament may be delivered from the filled canister via the metering valve to the mouth of the<br>
patient along direction B and be drawn into the patient's lungs.<br>
In some embodiments, a method of treating and/or preventing the onset of a respiratory disease includes<br>
administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation to a person in need of treatment or<br>
prophylaxis of the respiratory disease, wherein the effective amount of the pharmaceutical aerosol formulation is<br>
administered from a metered dose inhaler according to embodiments of the present invention. While<br>
embodiments of the present invention have been described for treating or preventing the onset of a respiratory<br>
disease, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that method of the present invention could be used to<br>
treat or prevent any of the various disease or condition for which, the medicaments described above with<br>
reference to embodiments of the medicament dispenser are indicated.<br>
Administration of medicament in a container or MDI in accordance with embodiments of the present invention<br>
may be indicated for the treatment of mild, moderate, severe acute or chronic symptoms or for prophylactic<br><br>
treatment. It will be appreciated that the precise dose administered will depend on the age and condition of the<br>
patient, the particular particulate medicament used and the frequency of administration and will ultimately be at<br>
the discretion of the attendant physician. When combinations of medicaments are employed the dose of each<br>
component of the combination will in general be that employed for each component when used alone.<br>
Typically, administration may be one or more times, for example, from 1 to 8 times per day, giving for example<br>
1,2,3 or 4 puffs each time.<br>
Suitable daily doses, may be, for example, in the range 50 to 200 micrograms of salmeterol or 50 to 2000<br>
micrograms of fluticasone propionate, depending on the severity of the disease. Thus, for example, each valve<br>
actuation may deliver 25 micrograms of salmeterol or 25, 50,125 or 250 micrograms of fluticasone propionate.<br>
An appropriate dosing regime for other medicaments will be known or readily available to persons skilled in the<br>
art. Typically each filled canister for use in a metered dose inhaler contains 60,100,120,160 or 240 metered<br>
doses or puffs of medicament.<br>
According to still other embodiments of the present invention, a drug product includes a metered dose inhaler<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention and a packaging material forming an enclosed volume that<br>
contains the metered dose inhaler.<br>
The packaging material may be various packaging material as will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
including, but not limited to, cartons and flexible wrappers. In some embodiments, the packaging material is a<br>
flexible wrapper that comprises a material that is substantially impermeable to ingress of atmospheric moisture<br>
and, optionally, substantially permeable to egress of propellant gas (e.g., as described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,119,853, 6,179,118,6,315,112, 6,352,152, and 6,390,291). Preferably, the package will also contain within it<br>
a desiccant material as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The desiccant material may be inside the<br>
MDI and/or outside the MDI.<br>
According to yet other embodiments of the present invention, a method of making a drug product includes<br>
packaging a metered dose inhaler according to embodiments of the present invention within a packaging<br>
material to provide the drug product. The packaging operation may be performed by various processes as with<br><br>
be understood by those skilled in the art, including but not limited to, those described in U. S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,119,853,6,179,118,6,315,112, 6,352,152, and 6,390,291.<br>
It has been found that the absolute FPM measurements (before or after storage) are higher in a medicament<br>
dispenser (and/or an MDI) according to embodiments of the present invention than in a conventional<br>
medicament dispenser (and/or an MDI), which utilizes the same elastomeric material for the can seal and the one<br>
or more stem seals. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is, at the time of filing, hypothesised that<br>
embodiments of the present invention provide advantageous stabilisation of the aerosol formulation by one or<br>
more of the following effects: reducing drug deposition, improving stability of FPM even after storage,<br>
decreasing the increase in mean mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) during storage, and/or decreasing the<br>
GSD (Geometric Standard Deviation).<br>
In a further aspect, embodiments of the invention provide a method of prolonging the shelf-life of a metered<br>
dose inhaler comprising assembling a metered dose inhaler that includes a medicament dispenser according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention described above to provide a metered dose inhaler having a shelf-life that<br>
is longer than the shelf-life of a conventional metered dose inhaler that includes a cap seal and a stem seal mat<br>
comprises the same elastomeric material. In some embodiments, the shelf-life is measured by determining the<br>
FPM of the pharmaceutical formulation after storage under conditions such as 25,30 or 40°C and 50,60,75, or<br>
85% relative humidity (RH) (preferred conditions are 25°C/60% RH, 25°C/75% RH, 30°C/50% RH, 30°C/60%<br>
RH, 40°C/75% RH, or 40°C/85% RH) for a time period such as 1,4,12,26, or 52 weeks and comparing the<br>
determined FPM to the initial FPM. In these embodiments, the shelf life will be longer if, at the same or similar<br>
storage conditions, it takes a longer time period before the determined FPM reaches a given level. For example,<br>
if a conventional MDI exhibits a drop in FPM of 20% after storage at 20°C/75% RH for 4 weeks and an MDI of<br>
the present invention exhibits a drop in FPM of 20% after storage at 20°C/75% RH for 26 weeks, the MDI of the<br>
present invention will have a prolonged shelf-life. In some embodiments, the shelf-life is prolonged by at least<br>
1,2,4, 8, or 12 weeks.<br>
According to other embodiments of the present invention, a medicament dispenser comprising a particulate<br>
medicament, such as the medicament dispensers according to embodiments of the present invention described<br><br>
above, is provided in which the FPM of the particulate medicament is maintained within 15%, more preferably<br>
within 10% and especially within 5% of its original level after 4,8, and preferably 12 weeks storage at 40°C and<br>
75% relative humidity,<br>
The chemical and physical stability and the pharmaceutical acceptability of the aerosol formulations according<br>
to the invention may be determined by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Thus the chemical<br>
stability of the components may be determined by HPLC assay, for example, after prolonged storage of the<br>
product. Physical stability data may be gained from other conventional analytical techniques such as by leak<br>
testing, by valve delivery assay (average shot weights per actuation), by dose reproducibility assay (active<br>
ingredient per actuation) and spray distribution analysis.<br>
The suspension stability of the aerosol formulations according to the invention may be measured by<br>
conventional techniques, for example, by measuring flocculation size distribution using a back light scattering<br>
instrument or by measuring aerodynamic particle size distribution by cascade impaction, next generation<br>
impactor, multistage liquid impinger, or by the "twin impinger" analytical process. As used herein reference to<br>
the "twin impinger" assay means "Determination of me deposition of the emitted dose in pressurised inhalations<br>
using apparatus A" as defined in British Pharmacopaeia 1988, pages A204-207, Appendix XVIIC. Such<br>
techniques enable the "respirable fraction" of the aerosol formulations to be calculated. One method used to<br>
calculate the "respirable fraction" is by reference to "fine particle fraction" which is the amount of active<br>
ingredient collected in the lower impingement chamber per actuation expressed as a percentage of the total<br>
amount of active ingredient delivered per actuation using the twin impinger method described above. As<br>
discussed above, the absolute "fine particle mass" (FPM) is an important parameter in relation to the present<br>
invention. The FPM may be assessed using the same apparatus as the fine particle fraction.<br>
According to other embodiments of the present invention, a method of distributing a sealed container includes<br>
transporting a sealed container according to embodiments of the present invention described above over a<br>
distance of at least 1 yard (or 1 meter), preferably at least 1 mile (or 1 kilometer). The transporting operation can<br>
be performed via various processes as will be understood by those skilled in the art including, but not limited to,<br>
transporting via air carrier and/or transporting via ground carrier.<br><br>
While some of the embodiments of the present invention described herein have focused on devices and/or<br>
methods useful for delivery of a medicament to the lungs of a patient, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that the present invention is also useful for delivery of a medicament to the nasal passages of a patient<br>
(e.g., where the medicament dispenser includes a nasal actuator instead of a mouth actuator as shown in Figure<br>
4).<br>
Except as otherwise noted, all references including patent and published patent applications referred to herein<br>
are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
The invention will now be described farther with reference the following Examples which serve to illustrate the<br>
invention but are not intended to be limiting.<br>
Examples<br>
Example I<br>
Sealed containers including an 8 ml aluminium canister (manufactured by Presspart Inc., of Cary, North<br>
Carolina) coated with a PTFE-PES coating supplied by CCL Container of Harrisonburg, Virginia, a neck (or<br>
cap) seal, a cap (or ferule) and a DF60 Mk42 metering valve, item no. 803309, (manufactured by Valois Pharm,<br>
of Le Vaudreuil, France) having a lower stem seal and an upper stem seal were assembled using conventional<br>
techniques known in the art. The materials used for the neck seal, the lower stem seal, and the upper stem seal<br>
in each of the sealed containers were varied according to the following matrix.<br><br><br>
The EPDM seals were model no. 808TS1 and/or 808TS1 EX2 seals obtained from Valois Pharm and had been<br>
extracted with ethanol. The nitrile seals were acrylonitrile butadiene rubber seals, model no. 403B and/or 404B,<br>
obtained from Valois Pharm.<br>
The sealed containers were then filled through the metering valve with a pharmaceutical formulation containing<br>
8 mg fluticasone propionate and 5.8 rag salmeterol xinafoate in 12 grams of 134a propellam. After filling, the<br>
sealed containers were fired and the initial fine particle mass (FPM) of the formulation was determined for each<br>
container using Anderson Cascade Impaction, with the FPM being the sum of the 3,4, and 5 stage values.<br>
After determining the initial FPM, the sealed containers were stored at 40°C/75% RH for 12 weeks. The FPM<br>
was then determined again using the procedure described above. The relative FPM results (with variability) are<br>
illustrated in Chart 1 below:<br><br><br>
As can be seen in Chart 1, sealed containers 2,3, and 4 having a neck seal made of EPDM and at least one stem<br>
seal made of nitrite exhibited improved stability (e.g., lower drops in FPM after storage) when compared to the<br>
conventional sealed container 8 having all nitrile seals.<br>
Example II<br>
The procedures performed in Example I above were repeated using a pharmaceutical formulation similar to that<br>
used in Example I and using sealed containers similar to those used in Example I, with the exception that the<br>
valves were DF60 Mk42 metering valves, item no. 10002715, (manufactured by Valois Pharm, of Le Vaudreuil,<br>
France). The relative FPM results (with variablility) are illustrated in Chart 2 below:<br><br>
* Shown for comparative purposes only. Not part of the present invention.<br>
** Only one initial FPM measurement was obtained for sealed containers 1-4 and only one initial FPM was<br>
obtained for sealed containers 5-8. Container 1 was used to determine the initial FPM for sealed containers 1-4<br>
and Container 8 was used to determine the initial FPM for sealed containers 5-8.<br><br>
As can be seen in Chart 2, sealed containers 2,3, and 4 having a neck seal made of EPDM and at least one stem<br>
seal made of nitrile exhibited improved stability (e.g., lower or no measurable drop in FPM after storage) when<br>
compared to the conventional sealed container 8 having all nitrile seals.<br><br>
