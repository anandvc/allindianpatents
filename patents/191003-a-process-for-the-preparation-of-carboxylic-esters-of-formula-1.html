				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of carboxylic esters of formula (1) for use in perfumes, detergents, fabric softeners for perfuming fabrics<br>
The use of enzymes in fabric detergents, in order to improve their efficiency, has been known for a number of years. Amongst said enzymes, lipases are particularly preferred, as a result of their capacity to hydrolyse the fat materials on the dirty linen and thus to facilitate its cleaning. However, it is known that malodour problems can occasionally occur under certain application conditions. In order to solve these malodour problems there has been proposed a method (see for example EP 430 315) consisting in carefully choosing the perfuming ingredients incorporated in the detergents and which, following the washing, are deposited on the fabrics. Therefore, appropriate perfuming of said detergents appears to be extremely important.<br>
On the other hand, it would be desirable that the detergents and fabric softeners are able to impart to the fabrics a long-lasting odour, such that the user perceives this odour even a long time after the textiles have been washed and subsequently dried. To this end, it has been known to use in the fabric detergents and softeners perfuming ingredients which have a good tenacity on the fabrics, i.e. ingredients whose odour, once imparted to the textiles upon the washing, can then be perceived by the consumer for several days. However, there are many perfuming substances known for their extremely pleasant odours, and namely a quality of "freshness" often associated with the notion of cleanliness, which substances are unfortunately not very tenacious or even not tenacious at all on fabrics such that their perfuming effect can only be perceived very briefly, at the most for a few hours following the washing and drying operations. Clearly, prolonging the fragrance effect of such substances, and thus the "freshness" of the fabrics, would be highly desirable.<br>
The present invention brings precisely a novel solution to this problem. We have now unexpectedly discovered a better process for perfuming textiles washed with detergents containing lipases. We have in fact been able to establish that, by adding particular ingredients to the fabric detergent and/or to the fabric softener that is subsequently applied, one could distinctly improve the odour of the fabrics treated with these<br>
products and prolong in a remarkable way the fragrance of said fabrics after drying.<br>
A first object of the present invention is thus to provide a process for perfuming fabrics washed in the presence of a lipase-containing detergent and, optionally, subsequently treated with a fabric softener, said process being characterized in that said detergent and/or said fabric softener contains a compound of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Wherein<br>
a.	R represents a radical derived from a fragrant alcohol of<br>
formula ROH and Y represents a C7 to C24 linear or branched, saturated<br>
or unsaturated alkyl radical, or a -(CH2-)nCOOR group wherein R is<br>
defined as above and n is an integer from 0 to 6; or<br>
b.	Y represents a C7 to C24 linear or branched, saturated or<br>
unsaturated alkyl radical and R represents a group of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, either R1 represents hydrogen and R2 represents an alkylidene radical derived from a fragrant aldehyde of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or R2 represents an alkylidene radical and R1 an alkyl radical, R1 and R2 being then derived from a fragrant ketone of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
and, optionally, being part of a ring such as indicated by the dotted line which contains 5 to 18 carbon atoms and can be substituted.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of carboxylic esters of formula (1) for use in perfumes, detergents, fabric softeners for perfuming fabrics<br>
wherein<br>
R represents a monovalent radical derived from a fragrant alcohol of formula ROH and Y represents a C7 to C24 linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radical, or a-(CH2)nCOOR group wherein R is defined as above and n is an integer from 0 to 6;<br>
which process comprises<br>
reacting the alcohol of formula ROH, wherein R is defined as above, with YC(0)CI, Y being defined as above, in the presence of (C2H5)3N and chloroform at a temperature of -50°C to 150°C and atmospheric pressure, so as to obtain a compound of formula YCOOR.<br>
By an alkylidene radical derived from a fragrant aldehyde or ketone, it is understood here a radical which, upon the conversion of enol-ester (I) into said aldehyde or ketone, regenerates the corresponding R group which is the substituent of said aldehyde or ketone. Thus, for example, when the fragrant aldehyde is 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal (R is 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenyl), the corresponding alkylidene radical in enol-ester (I) is 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadienyl.<br>
According to a variant of the invention, there is provided a process for perfuming fabrics washed in the presence of a lipase-containing detergent, which process comprises the treatment of said fabrics, after the washing cycle, with a fabric softener containing a compound of formula (I) as defined above.<br>
By "fragrant alcohol", "fragrant aldehyde" or "fragrant ketone" it is meant here any alcohol, aldehyde, respectively ketone, of current use in perfumery, which is capable of imparting an odour to fabrics or textiles, upon the process of washing and/or the treatment with a fabric softener. We have in fact discovered that the perfuming effect of such compounds could be remarkably improved, and namely their diffusion prolonged, if they were replaced by the corresponding compound (I) in the detergent or fabric softener used.<br>
~This-resul-Ms-a!l^£hejn^^	the compounds (I)<br>
are themselves either devoid of odour, or they possess weak and characterless odours, and are thus apparently useless for perfumery. Yet, when used according to the invention, they axe not only capable of imparting to the fabrics the characteristic odour of the corresponding alcohol, aldehyde or ketone, but also of prolonging their effect of diffusion, such that said odour develops itself for much longer periods of time than in the case where said corresponding alcohol, aldehyde or ketone is directly added to the detergents or fabric softeners. Therefore, the use of compounds (I) according to the process of the invention is translated into an enhanced substantivity of the corresponding alcohols, aldehydes and ketones.<br>
The advantages of this process are all the more obvious in the case of the numerous odoriferous alcohols which are known to be weakly tenacious on washed fabrics and the odour of which, although distinctly perceived when the fabrics are removed from the washing machine, does not remain on the linen and can no longer be perceived after 12 to 24 h.<br>
Many examples of such alcohols can be found in the prior art, some of which only contribute to the odour of thejfabrics for a very short<br>
time, and no doubt many others will be discovered in the future. For all these alcohols, the process according to the invention makes it possible to remarkably improve their odoriferous performance on fabrics, by prolonging the diffusion time of their characteristic notes and thus the time during which they contribute significantly to the overall odour. We have in fact established that the use of the corresponding compounds (I) in the detergents and/or fabric softeners made it possible to obtain a perfuming effect equivalent to the one that would have been observed with the prolonged diffusion ("slow-release") of the alcohol, if such a diffusion would have been possible, which is not the case in practice.<br>
Quite clearly, it is impossible to list in an exhaustive manner all the alcohols of formula ROH known to this day, which are capable of imparting pleasant odours to the textiles treated with the laundry products perfumed by way of said alcohols, and the perfuming effect of which can be remarkably improved according to the invention. However, by way of example, one can cite alcohols such as anisic alcohol, cinnamic alcohol, fenchylic alcohol, 9-decen-l-ol, phenethylol, citronellol, 3-methyl-5-phenyl-1-pentanol (origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), Mayol ® (7-p-menthan-1-ol;    origin :    Firmenich    SA,    Geneva,    Switzerland), dihydromyrcenol (2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol), geraniol (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadieiv-T-ol), (Z)-3=hexen-l-ol71-hexanol, 2-hexanpl, 5-ethyl-2-nonanol, 2,6-nonadien-l-ol, borneol, l-octen-3-ol, 4-cyclohexyl-2-methyl-2-butanol (origin:   Firmenich  SA,  Geneva,   Switzerland),  2-methyl-4-phenyI-2-butanol, 2-methyl-l-phenyl-2-propanol, cyclomethylcitronellol, decanol, dihydroeugenol, 8-p-menthanol, 3,7-dimethyl-l-octanol, 2,6-dimethyl-2-heptandl, dodecanol, eucalyptol, eugenol, Florol ® (tetrahydro-2-isobutyl-4-methyl-4(2H)-pyranol; origin:  Firmenich SA, Geneva,  Switzerland), isoeugenol, linalol, Tarragol ® (2-methoxy-4-propyl-l-cylohexanol; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), terpineol, tetrahydromuguol, 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol and Lyral ®  (3 and 4-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-cyclohex-3-ene-l-carbaldehyde;   origin :   International   Flavors   and Fragrances, USA).<br>
It is quite obvious, however, that the process of the invention is perfectly general and can relate to many other alcohols which the skilled person is quite able to choose from the general knowledge in the art and as a function of the olfactive effect it desires to achieve.<br>
Analogous considerations apply to the aldehydes of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and to the ketones of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The process of the invention is advantageous whenever the compounds such as those mentioned above show a weak tenacity on fabrics, and there are many odoriferous aldehydes and ketones whose performance on textiles turns out to be disctinctly improved when these compounds exert their perfuming activity by way of the corresponding enol-esters of formula (I).<br>
Again, although one cannot cite in an exhaustive manner all the fragrant aldehydes and ketones which can be used according to the process of the invention, there can be cited, by way of example, compounds such as C6 to C12 aldehydes, hydratropic aldehyde, methyl nonyl acetaldehyde, phenylpropanoic aldehyde, Acropal ® [3- or 4-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-3-cyclohexene-1-carbaldehyde;    origin-    Givauandure,Vernier— Switzerland], 2-methyldecanal, 4-isopropyl-l-benzeneacetaldehyde, (4-methyl-l-phenyl)acetaldehyde, Z-6-nonenal, citral, citronellal, 9-decenal, 3-(4-isopropyl-l-phenyl)-2-methylpropanal (origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland),   (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal,   (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal,   (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, 5,9-dimethyl-4,9-decadienal, (Z)-6-octenal, Farenal ® (2,6,10-trimethyl-9-undecenal; origin: Givaudan-Roure, Vernier, Switzerland), Foliaver ®     [3-(4-methoxy-l-phenyl)~2-methylpropanal ;    origin : International Flavors  and Fragrances, USA], Heliopropanal ® [3-(l,3-benzodioxoI-5-yI)-2-methylpropanal; origin: International Flavors and Fragrances,  USA],   (Z)-4-heptenal,  le  3,5,5-trimethylhexanal   (origin: International     Flavors     and     Fragrances,     USA),     (4-methyl-l-phenoxy)acetaldehyde,   hydroxycitronellal,   isocyclocitral   (origin: International Flavors and Fragrances, USA), Lilial ®  [3-(4-tert-butyl-l-phenyl)-2-methylpropanal ;    origin :    Givaudan-Roure,    Vernier, Switzerland], le  l-p-menthene-9-carbaldehyde  (origin:  Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), Lyral ® [3- and 4-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-3-cyclohexene-1-carbaldehyde; origin: International Flavors and Fragrances, USA], 2,6-dimethyl-5-heptenal, l-p-menthen-9-al, (E)-2-octenal, (2E,6Z)-2,6-<br>
nonadienai, 3-methyl-5-phenylpentanal, (E)-4-decenal, (E)-2-undecenal, 3,7-dimethyloctanal, Zestover (2,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexene-l-carbaldehyde; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), 3-phenylbutanal, Scentenal ® (octahydro-5-methoxy-4,7-methano-lH-indene-2-carboxaldehyde; origin: Firmenich  SA,  Geneva,  Switzerland),  2,5,9-trimethyl-4,9-decadienal, Intreleven  aldehyde   (undecenal;  origin:  International  Flavors   and Fragrances, USA), 4-methyl-phenyl-propanoic aldehyde, 4-(4-hydroxy-l-phenyl)-2-butanone,   benzylacetone,   the   ionones,   3-(4-tert-butyl-l-phenyl)propanal, carvone, 3/7-dimethyl-l,l-bis(ll-methyldodecyloxy)-2,6-octadiene, muscone, 2-pentyl-l-cyclopentanone, l'ethyl amyl ketone, 1'ethyl pentyl ketone, la 2-heptyl-l-cyclopentanone, geranylacetone, Iralia ® (methylionone; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), Iso E super [l-(octahydro-2,3,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphtalenyl)-l-ethanone ;   origin : International Flavors and Fragrances, USA], 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, methyl   jasmonate,   methyl   hexyl   ketone,   methyl   pentyl   ketone, methylnonyl ketone, cis-jasmone, Hedione ® (methyl dihydrojasmonate; origin :   Firmenich   SA,   Geneva,   Switzerland),   civettone,   4-(l,l-dimethylpropyl)-l-cyclohexanone,   Exaltone ®   (cyclopentadecanone ; origin :    Firmenich   SA,   Geneva,   Switzerland),   2,6,6-trimethyl-2~ en-3-one (origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), 10,10-dimethyl-tricyclo[7.1.1.02'7]undec-2-en-4-one (origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), Vertofix coeur (origine : International Flavors and Fragrances, USA), la perhydro-5,5,8a-trimethyl-2-naphtalenone (origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland) or 5-methyl-exo-tricyclo[6.2.1.02'7]undecan-4-one.<br>
Furthermore, it should be noted that the process of the invention is of much more general use than merely the improved perfuming of textiles treated with laundry products containing lipases. It constitutes, in fact, a general process for washing said textiles which is also advantageous whenever it is desired to improve the activity of certain agents, fragrant or other, currently present in laundry products, i.e. detergents and fabric softeners. It is well-known for instance that said laundry products are often very aggressive media, wherein a great number of perfuming ingredients, and more particularly fragrant aldehydes, turn out to be unstable and cannot therefore be used to perfume those products, nor the textiles washed therewith. The use according to the invention of the corresponding esters and enol-esters of formula (I) can obviate this problem whenever said enol-<br>
esters turn out to be more stable. It is also quite clear that one can make use of the process of the invention to improve and prolong the action of bactericide agents, namely alcohols, whether they are fragrant or not.<br>
Therefore, the process according to the invention is in fact a general process for treating textiles or fabrics upon the washing of the latter with a lipase-containing detergent, which washing can be followed by treatment with a fabric softener, according to which process any alcohol, aldehyde or ketone currently used in fabric detergents or softeners for its perfuming, bactericide or other activity, can be replaced by the corresponding compound (I), so as to improve its activity.<br>
Compounds (I) are novel chemical entities and thus are also the object of the invention. Amongst said compounds, those wherein y represents a C7 to C24 linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl radical are fatty acids esters or enol-esters which do not themselves possess an interesting odour, but which, when used according to the process of the invention, are capable of imparting to the fabrics the fragrances typical of the corresponding alcohols, aldehydes and ketones defined above. Said compounds, in particular the derivatives having 12 to 16 carbon atoms, are preferred according to the invention, owing to the particularly advantageous^esults obtained^up_on_theirjise^_<br>
As regards the compounds (I) wherein Y represents a -(CH2)nCOOR group, R being defined as above and n being an integer from 0 to 6, they are novel diesters, which are either devoid of odour, or possess odours which are not particularly useful for perfumery. However, they showed similar behaviour to that of the compounds (I) cited here-above, when used in the context of the present invention.<br>
The compounds  (I) of the invention can be added to the<br>
detergents and fabric softeners either on their own, or in admixture with<br>
other perfuming ingredients, solvents or adjuvants, of current use in<br>
perfumery. The concentrations in which they can be added  to the<br>
detergents and fabric softeners according to the invention have the values<br>
usual in the art for this type of products. The skilled person is quite able to<br>
select such values as a function of the nature of the product to be perfumed<br>
and of the desired olfactive effect. By way of example, concentrations of the<br>
order of 0.01 to 1%, or even up to 5%, by weight of compound (I), relative to<br>
the weight of detergent or fabric softener composition, can be cited.<br>
The fabric detergents and softeners according to the invention can take the form of powders or granular solids, bars, pastes or yet aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous liquids, and contain the usual ingredients for this type of product Thus, the detergents can typically contain, in addition to the lipase (see, for example, EP 430 315 for a detailed description of the type of lipases that can be used according to the present invention), for example active anionic, cationic, zwitterionic or non-ionic compounds, as well as filling agents, bleaching agents, confining agents and other ingredients of current use in the detergent bases intended for washing linen. A detailed description of the base detergent compositions which are adapted to be used according to the process of the invention is unwarranted here. A great many examples of such compositions can be found in the art and namely in the literature which is cited for instance in the European patent application mentioned above, or yet in European patent application EP 397 245. By way of example, a base detergent of this type, to which there is added the lipase in the desired concentration, can have the following composition (origin : Henkel KGaA, Diisseldorf, Germany):<br>
Ingredients	% by weight<br>
Linear sodium alkyl benzene<br>
sulfonate (average length of the alcane chain (15)	8.0<br>
Ethoxylated tallow alcoho0lI4EO                                                     2.9<br>
Sodium soap<br>
(chain length   C12-6 :13-26%<br>
C18-22 : 74-87%)	3.5<br>
Sodium triphosphate	43.8<br>
Sodium silicate (Si02 : Na20=3.3:l)	7.5<br>
Magnesium silicate	1.9<br>
Carboxymethylcellulose	1.2<br>
Sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate	0.2<br>
Sodium sulfate	21.2<br>
Water	9.8<br>
Total	100.0<br>
Similar considerations apply to the fabric softener bases according to the invention, which will typically contain cationic softening ingredients of the type cited in EP 397 245 or in the literature mentioned in this reference.<br>
The   compounds   of   the   invention   can   be   prepared  by conventional synthetic methods. For example, the derivatives of fragrant<br>
alcohols were prepared by the esterification method summarized in the following reaction scheme :<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of mono-esters<br>
General method<br>
To a stirred solution of the appropriate ROH alcohol (0.064 mole) and triethylamine (7.4 g, 0.073 mole) in CH2C12 (110 ml), there was added dropwise during 20 min, at 15° and under N2 the corresponding YC(0)C1 acyl chloride (0.07 mole), wherein Y is a C7 to C24, linear of branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl radical. After 2 h at room temperature, the mixture was poured on aq. sat. NaHC03 (excess) and the organic phase was separated. Extraction of the aqueous phase with CH2C12 was followed by washing of the combined organic phases with 10% aqueous NaCl. The reaction product was dried over Na2S04, concentrated and distilled to provide the desired ester in a pure state and in 80 to 90% yield.<br>
The following mono-esters were prepared according to the above-described general method.<br>

Example 3<br>
Preparation of enol-esters General method<br>
A 500 ml three-neck flask under argon was charged with 0.162 mole of the appropriate aldehyde of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
2.5 g (26 rrtmole) of anhydrous potassium acetate, 34.45 g (0.34 mole) of triethylamine and 250 ml of acetic anhydride. After heating for 6 h at 120°, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, poured on ice, extracted three times with petroleum ether 30-50°, washed 6 times with 100 ml of saturated NaHCO^, then with water to neutrality. After drying over Na2S04, filtering, concentrating under vacuum and distilling on a Vigreux column, there was obtained the enolacetate corresponding to the starting aldehyde, in the form of a mixture of E and Z isomers. The latter were then separated by preparative gas chromatography. When starting from a ketone of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
there was followed a method analogous to that described by T. Taapken et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1,1994,1439/wherein the ketone is dissolved<br>
in the acetic anhydride and treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid as catalyst,<br>
and the formed acetic acid is eliminated to obtain the corresponding<br>
enolacetate.<br>
The enolacetates thus prepared are then converted into the enol-esters of formula (I) proceeding as follow.<br>
A 500 ml three-neck flask under argon was charged with 0.05 mole of<br>
enolacetate and 75 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was cooled<br>
to -60/-700 (dry ice/acetone bath) and a solution of 6.16 g (0.055 mole) of t-<br>
BuOK in 60 ml of absolute THF was introduced  dropwise  (slightly<br>
exothermic, the reaction mixture becomes strongly yellow). Stirring was<br>
kept for 1 h at -70° and 0.055 mole of the appropriate acyl chloride, in<br>
solution in 25 ml of absolute THF, were added dropwise. After 2 h at -70°,<br>
the cooling bath was removed and 60 mlof a saturated solution of NaHC03<br>
were quickly added (the temperature rises quickly to -10°). The mixture was<br>
extracted twice with sulfuric ether, washed once with saturated NaHCC3,<br>
once with water satured with salt, dried (Na2S04) and concentrated under<br>
vaccum. The product is then purified by flash-chromatography (column<br>
diameter = 9 cm, hexane/ether 98:2) and, after combining the useful layers,<br>
concentrated to dry under absolute vaccum.<br>

Example 4<br>
Test on fabrics<br>
Several tests were carried out on fabrics, under a variety of conditions, said fabrics having been treated according to the following general method.<br>
General method of treatment of textiles<br>
A standard cotton swatch of 32 g was placed in a Linitest ® (origin : Hanau, Germany) type vessel containing 1.3 g of a standard powder detergent base comprising 1% by weight of lipase (Lipolase ® 100T; origin: Novo Nordisk, Denmark) and 260 ml water. The cotton swatch was washed for 30 min at 40°. It was then taken out of the vessel and rinsed with 3x200 ml of water. It was then plunged for 5 min in 200 ml of water co'fttaining 0.6 g of a fabric softener base which contained a certain percehtage"by weights-comprised between 0.05 and 1%, of compound (I) according to the invention or, when applicable, of the corresponding alcohol, aldehyde or ketone. The cotton swatch was then spin-dried without having been rinsed, and dried on a clothes line.<br>
This method is equivalent to a washing in a real machine for washing 5 kg of linen in approximately 201 of water, with a rinsing of 4x201 water, the fabric softener being applied in the last rinsing water. The fabric softener base used had the following composition :<br>
Ingredients	% by weigth<br>
Arquad 2 HT  (75%)	5.00<br>
Formalin (40%)	0.20<br>
Demineralized water	94.69<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
24 H after taking the swatches out of the Linitest ® machines, the nine cotton swatches were submitted for a blind evaluation to a panel consisting ' of ten individuals, whom, after having smelled 9-decen-l-ol on a smelling strip, had to indicate whether they recognized the odour of this alcohol on any one of the swatches. The result of this evaluation is summarized on Table  2 hereaftex(only categorical identifications were taken into account):<br>
TABLE 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In a similar test carried out 48 h after having taken the swatches out of the Linitest ® machine, the members of the panel were still unanimous as regards swatch 1, i.e. they could not recognize the odour of 9-decen-l-ol on this swatch, whereas a majority judged it still very powerful on all the other swatches.<br>
2)     Colanyl Blau AR/10% sol.; origin : Hoechst, Germany<br>
In two separate tests, the cotton swatches were treated according to this general method, using as additive to the fabric softener respectively 9-decenyl hexadecanoate (1% by weight) in test A and 9-decenol (1% by weight) in test B.<br>
The two swatches were submitted for a blind test evaluation 24 h after<br>
having been taken out of the Linitest ® apparatus. The evaluation panel<br>
consisted of eight people, to whom had been given beforehand a smelling<br>
strip which had been dipped in 9-decen-l-ol, so as to render them familiar<br>
with the odour of this compound. The panel was then asked to smell the<br>
two cotton swatches above-mentioned and to indicate if they could identify<br>
the odour of 9-decen-l-ol in either of the swatches. Five amongst the eight<br>
members of the panel recognized the odour of this alcohol in the swatch<br>
treated in test A and indicated that this odour was very powerful, whereas<br>
only one of said members was able to identify the odour on the swatch<br>
treated in test B.<br>
A further, ^evaluation of the two swatches carried'out by the same panel, under identical conditions, 24 h later, i.e. 48 h after taking the s"watcfies~ouT_ of the Linitest ® apparatus, showed that none of the panel members could identify the odour of 9-decen-l-ol on the swatch of test B, whereas six of said members identified it without any hesitation on the swatch coming out of test A.<br>
Similar results were obtained when the two compounds above-mentioned were present in the fabric softener at a rate of 0.5% by weight.<br>
Example 5<br>
Test on fabrics<br>
Nine standard cotton swatches (32 g each), numbered from 1 to 9, were separately treated, and in identical manner, as described in Example 4, the only changing element being the additive incorporated in the fabric softener (at 1% by weight) and described in Table 1 hereinafter.<br>
Example 6 Test on fabrics<br>
Six standard cotton swatches (32 g each), numbered from 1 to 6, were separately treated, and in identical manner, as described in Example 4, the only changing element being the additive incorporated in the fabric softener (at 1% by weight) and described in Table 3 hereinafter.<br>

24 H after taking the swatches out of the Linitest® machines, the two cotton swatches were submitted for a blind evaluation to a panel consisting of eleven individuals, whom, after having smelled (E)-3,7-dimethyl-6-octen-1-ol on a smelling strip, had to indicate whether they recognized the odour of this alcohol on one or the other of the swatches. The result of this evaluation is summarized on Table 9 hereafter (only categorical identifications were taken into account):<br>
TABLE 9<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A similar test carried out with two cotton swatches treated with the same fabric softener base but containing only 0.5% by weight of the compounds reported in Table 8. The panel evaluation showed that none of the panel members-was -able to Jdentify the odiur the al|cohol on swatch 1, whereas 7 of the 11 members of the panel were certain that they could smell it on swatch 2.<br>
Still analogous results were obtained with a dosage of 0.1% by weight of the above-mentioned compounds.<br>
Example 9 rest on fabrics<br>
rhree standard cotton swatches (32 g each), numbered from 1 to 3, were ;eparately treated, and in identical manner, as described in Example 4, the mly changing element being the additive incorporated in the fabric oftener (at 1% by weight) and described in Table 10 hereinafter.<br>

24 H after taking the swatches out of the Linitest ® machines, the three cotton swatches were submitted for a blind evaluation to a panel consisting of ten individuals, whom, after having smelled 3-methyl-5-phenylpentan-l-ol on a smelling strip, had to indicate whether they recognized the odour of this alcohol on any one of the swatches. The result of this evaluation is summarized on Table 11 hereafter (only categorical identifications were taken into account):<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Three standard cotton swatches (32 g each) were treated separately following the general method described in Example 4, two of said swatches (1 et 2) using 9-decen-l-ol as additive to the softener, and swatch 3 using as additive 9-decenyl hexadecanoate, these additives having been added to the fabric softener in a concentration of 0.5% by weight.<br>
The three swatches were evaluated on a blind test by a panel of 12 individuals 24 h after having been taken out of the Linitest ®machines. The members of the panel were asked if they could ascertain any difference amongst the swatches and, if applicable, whether they could qualify this<br>
difference. The panel had previously smelled strips dipped in 9-decen-l-ol and was aware that an evaluation of the three cotton swatches with regard to the particular odour of this compound was expected. As a result of this evaluation, 8 out of the 12 members of the panel chose swatch 3 as being the one olfactively distinct and indicated that it developed the characteristic odour of 9-decen-l-ol, whilst the other two swatches gave off no distinctive odour.<br>
The same test was carried out with 1% of additive in the softener, instead of 0.5%. In this case, 9 of the 12 members of the panel chose once again swatch 3 as being the one developing the odour of the above-mentioned alcohol, and indicated that this odour was even more powerful than in the preceding test. On the other hand, the panel found that the other two cotton swatches still exhaled no distinctive odour.<br>

24 H after taking the swatches out of the Linitest® machines, the two cotton swatches were submitted for a blind evaluation to a panel consisting of twelve individuals, whom, after having smelted 3-methyl-5-phenyl-l-<br>
pentanal on a smelling strip, h^dTo^indicate~whether-they-reeognized-the	<br>
odour of this aldehyde on one or the other of the swatches. The result of this evaluation is summarized on Table 17 hereafter (only categorical identifications were taken into account) :<br>
TABLE 17<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 14<br>
Test on fabrics<br>
Three standard  cotton swatches  (32 g each)  were treated  separately following the general method described in" Example 4, two of said swatches<br>
(1 et 2) using 2-methyl-l-undecanal as additive to the softener, and swatch 3 using as additive 2-methyl-l-undecenyl octanoate, these additives having been added to the fabric softener in a concentration of 0.1% by weight. The three swatches were evaluated on a blind test by a panel of 12 individuals 24 h after having been taken out of the Linitest ®machines. The members of the panel were asked if they could ascertain any difference amongst the swatches and, if applicable, whether they could qualify this difference. The panel had previously smelled strips dipped in 2-methyl-l-undecanal and was aware that an evaluation of the three cotton swatches with regard to the particular odour of this compound was expected. As a result of this evaluation, 10 out of the 12 members of the panel chose swatch 3 as being the one olfactively distinct and indicated that it developed the characteristic odour of 2-methyl-l-undecanal, whereas the other two swatches gave off no distinctive odour.<br>
Example 15<br>
Test on fabrics treated in a washing machine<br>
Two standard batches of cotton textiles, each comprising 30 cotton swatches (32 g each), were put into two separate" washing machines, each containing, in the detergent compartment, 130 g of a standard powder detergent base comprising 1% by weight of lipase (Lipolase ® 100T; origin : Novo Nordisk, Denmark). In the compartment intended for the fabric softener, there was put, in one of the cases, 100 g of a softener base such as described in Example 4, perfumed with 0.1% by weight of 2-methyl-l-undecanal, whereas the softener (100 g) put in the second machine contained 0.1% by weight of 2-methyl-1-undecenyl octanoate. The batches of swatches were then washed with a normal washing cycle, at 40°, without prewash, and air dried. The batches of swatches were evaluated on a blind test, 24 h after liaving-been taken out of the machines, by a panel of 36 individuals. The latter had to indicate if they found any difference at all amongst the three batches of swatches, of which two were identical and had been treated with the softener containing 2-methyl-l-undecanal (batches 1 and 2) and the third had been treated with 2-methyl-l-undecenyl octanoate- (batch 3), without qualifying the nature of the distinctive character. In addition, they were<br><br>
also asked to indicate whether any one of the batches possessed a more<br>
powerful odour.<br>
Of the 36 panellists, 24 identified textile batch 3 as being the one distinct<br>
from the other two, from an olfactive point of view, and indicated that.this<br>
batch possessed a stronger odour than the other two.<br>
An analogous test was carried out but with only two textile batches, batch A<br>
having been treated with a softener containing 0.05% by weight of 2-<br>
methyl-1-undecanal and batch B with a softener containing 0.05% by weight<br>
of the corresponding enol-ester, i.e. 2-mefhyl-l-undecenyl octanoate.<br>
The panel of 36 individuals which evaluated batches A and B, without<br>
knowing the nature of the perfuming ingredients, had to indicate which of<br>
the two batches developed a stronger odour and which was preferred from<br>
the point of view of the perception of freshness and cleanliness of the<br>
linen.<br>
According to the categoric opinion of 32 out of the 36 panellists, the textiles<br>
batch B was far more "perfumed" than batch A and was perceived as being<br>
cleaner, with a more fresh odour.<br>

Two perfuming compositions were prepared with this base composition, by adding thereto 150 parts by weight of geraniol or 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienol (composition A), respectively 150 parts by weight of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienyl hexadecanoate (composition B). These two perfuming compositions were then added, at the rate of 0.6% by weight, to a non-perfumed fabric softener base to prepare two samples, A and respectively B, of a perfumed softener.<br>
In two identical washing machines, there were treated two standard batches of textiles, each formed of 1400 g of varied linen, comprising cotton swatches, cotton textiles and textiles in a cotton/polyester mixture. Each machine was charged with 130 g of a standard unperfumed detergent base containing 1% of lipase (Lipolase ® 100T). One of the machines was also charged with 100 g of sample A of the softener, comprising geraniol, whereas to the second machine there were added 100 g of softener sample B.<br>
The linen was then washed at 40° in a normal washing cycle, without<br>
prewash, and dried to air for 24 h.<br>
Three standard batches of textiles, of which two were identical and had<br>
been treated with sample A and the third with sample B, were then<br>
evaluated on a blind test by a panel of 20 individuals, who had to identify<br>
the batch of textiles possessing a distinct odour from that of the other two,<br>
without qualifying the nature of the distinctive character. The panellists<br>
also had to indicate which of the textile batches was more perfumed.<br>
As a result of this test, 14 panellists perceived a distinction in the odour of<br>
the textile batch treated with the fabric softener sample B, while 10 out of<br>
these 14 indicated that this same batch was the more perfumed.<br>
When the evaluation was repeated after 48 h of drying to air, analogous<br>
results were obtained.<br><br><br>
