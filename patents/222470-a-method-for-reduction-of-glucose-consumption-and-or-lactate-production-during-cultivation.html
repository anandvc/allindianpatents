				<td>The invention provides an improved method for reduction of lactate formation and/or glucose consumption in mammalian cell cultures by the addition of a bi- or tricarbonic acid, e.g. citric acid.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Optimization of cell culture processes is always focussed on the longevity of the cells (Bibila, T.A., and Robinson, D.K., Biotechnol. Prog. 11 (1995) 1-13). The integral of viable cell number over time is often used as a measure of cultivation success and is positively correlated with product formation. In this paper this integral is defined as CTI (CTI = Cell density Time Integral).<br>
Lactate, besides ammonium, is a major waste product formed during the cultivation of mammalian cells. Under typical culture conditions the cells consume glucose in great excess and metabolize it mainly to lactate. The accumulation of lactate affects cell growth, CTI and protein production adversely as a result of pH and/or pH adjustment by alkali (Chang, Y.H.D., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 47 (1995) 319-326); Omasa, T., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 39 (1992) 556-565) and Chen, K., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 72 (2001) 55-62).<br>
There have been a lot of attempts to reduce lactat formation. It was suggested by Glacken, M.W., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 28 (1986) 1376-1389), Hu, W.S., et al., Dev. Biol. Stand. 66(1987) 279-290) andXie, L., and Wang, D.I.C., Cytotechnology 15 (1994) 17-29) to grow mammalian cells at low glucose concentrations with dynamic controlled feeding with glucose. The idea was to achieve a metabolic shift from high glucose/lactate flux to a low glucose/lactate flux. However, such methods require adaptations of the cells and need carefully designed control mechanisms of feeding. They are therefore complicated and difficult to perform (US Patent 6,156,570).<br>
Other methods for reduction of lactate formation are based on genetic engineering means. One method is described by Chen, K., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 72 (2001) 55-62. Chen et al. suggest to manipulate the metabolic pathway for lactate in the mammalian cells by inactivation of at least one copy of lactate dehydrogenase genes in said cells. Another method is described by Irani, N., et al., J. Biotechnol. 66 (1999) 238-246). The authors introduce a pyruvate carboxylase gene into the host cell genome. It is assumed that the conversion of pyruvate to lactate is reduced and therefore the longevity of the cell culture is improved.<br><br>
The aim of this invention is to provide a simple method for reduction of glucose consumption and / or of lactate formation during mammalian cell growth.<br>
The addition of ferric citrate as a substituent for transferrin in serum-free media for the cultivation of mammalian cells has been known for a long time (cf., e.g., Toyoda, K., and Inouye, K., Agric. Biol. Chem. 55 (1991) 1631-1633), Franek, F., and Dolnikova, J., Cytotechnology 7 (1991) 33-38), Kovar, J., and Franek, F., Exp. Cell Res. 182 (1989) 358-369), Schneider, Y J., J. Immunol. Meth. 116 (1989) 65-77) and Kovar, J., Hybridoma 7 (1988)255-263).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the addition of one or more bi- or tricarbonic acids inhibit considerably the consumption of glucose and / or the formation of lactate from glucose and therefore improves cell density and cell viability during mammalian cell cultivation. Based on these findings, the yield of a protein of interest (BOJJ which is        /' produced by such a cell cultivation increases considerably using the methcra according to the present invention. Furtheron the addition of di- or tricarbonic acid reduces the amount of alkali which has to be added to maintain the pH value constant for about 50 % to 70 %.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for reduction of glucose consumption and / or lactate production during cultivation of animal cells in a serum-free medium characterized in that cultivation is performed in the presence of citric acid or a salt thereof at a concentration of about 1 to 50 mmol/1, whereby this amount of said citric acid or citrate is not bound in a chelate complex with iron or another transition metal ion and the medium contains an additional amount of citric acid or citrate in a chelate complex with iron which is added as an iron source of the serum-free medium.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the animal cells are mammalian cells preferably hybridoma or myeloma cells, CHO, NSO, BHK, or HeLa cells which produce monoclonal antibodies or proteinaceous hormones.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the cells are cultivated in a fed batch, batch perfusion, dialysis, solid state, or continuous fermentation, preferably over a time of 10 to 20 days.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
according to the invention, the specific rate of glucose consumption (μg/10 cells x day) is educed to about 40%, preferably more than 40%, i.e., 40 to 60%, in relation to a ermentation process using a method wherein no uncomplexed citrate is present. The pecific rate of lactate production (μg/106 cells x day) is reduced to about 50%, preferably nore than 50%, i.e., 50 to 70%, in relation to a fermentation process using a method vherein no uncomplexed citrate is present.<br>
Accumulation of lactate in the cell culture medium can inhibit cell growth and POI production during cell cultivation. The growth-inhibitory lactate concentration vary with the cell line. The lactate concentration after a certain time in a cultivation process is a result of the production rate of lactate and the CTI. This invention reduces the specific production rate of lactate, so that the period prolongs before the inhibitory concentration take place, or in the best case the lactate stays below the inhibitory concentration. However, this invention results in considerable increase of the CTI during the cultivation.<br>
Cultivation of the cells is performed in a production dimension, i.e., in volumes of 10-10,0001 bioreactors. Such methods are described, for example, in Bibila, T.A., and Robinson, D.K., Biotechnol. Prog. 11 (1995) 1-13.<br>
Preferably, the fermentation medium is a serum-free medium. Such media are widely described in the state of the art (see e.g. Murakami, H., Monoclonal Antibodies: Production and Application (1989) 107-141).<br>
Bi- and tricarbonic acids are added preferably as an alkali metal or alkaline metal salt or as free acid at a concentration of about 1 to 50 mmol/1. This carbon acids amount is preferably not bound in a chelate complex with iron or another transition metal. However, the medium may preferably contain an additional amount of a bi- and tricarbonic acid or a salt thereof of citrate in a chelate complex with iron which is added as an iron source of the serum-free medium. As previously stated, iron citrate is widely known as an additive to serum-free media as iron source should be, for example, transferrin.<br>
The term "complexed bi- and tricarbonic acid " means an aqueous solution of stoichiometric amounts of said acid and iron ions which leads to complex formation within the law of mass action.<br><br>
The term „Protein of interest (POI)" refers to any protein tor which expression is desired<br>
'*<br>
Preferably the term encompasses any recombinant form of a desired protein. Such proteins of interest are for example protein hormones like erythropoietin, or antibodies and the like. Such recombinant proteins are reviewed by, e.g., Hudson, P.J., and Souriau, C, Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 1 (2001) 845-855).<br>
The mammalian cells are preferably recombinant cell lines like CHO cells or hybridoma or which myeloma cells are transformed with expression vectors capable of expressing such a protein of interest. Such methods are well known in the state of the art and reviewed by, e.g., Colosimo, A., et. al„ Biotechniques 29 (2000) 314-331).<br>
Fermentation in fed batch mode is preferably performed in stirred bioreactors for 4 to 10 days. The cell density is preferably between 0.2 to 10 x 106 cells/ml. PO2 is preferably between 15 to 30% and pH between 6.9 to 7.3.<br>
Fermentation in dialysis mode (Comer, M.J., et. al., Cytotechnology 3 (1990) 295-299) can be performed in stirred dialysis bioreactors for 12 to 16 days. The cell density is preferably between 0.2 to 30 x 106 cells/ml, P02 between 15 to 30% and pH between 6.9 to 7.3.<br>
As fermentation medium preferably a common serum-free medium is used and a solution of concentrated nutrients is used for feeding.<br>
The following examples and references are provided to aid the understanding of the present invention, the true scope of which is set forth in the appended claims. It is understood that modifications can be made in the procedures set forth without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
The cells of a myeloma cell line (Sp2/0) was thawed and expanded up to 2 L in spinner flasks over a period of approximately 14 days for the inoculation of a 10 L bioreactor. After 2-4 days the cells were split or transferred to a 100 L bioreactor and further cultivated for 2 - 4 days. The 100 L bioreactor served as inoculum for the 1000 L production bioreactor. For each inoculum step a starting cell density of 0.2 - 0.4 x 106 viable cells per mL was used.<br>
The production bioreactor ran in a dialysis mode. The bioreactor was a stirred tank reactor with a working volume of 900 - 1300 L. Aeration was performed by sparging. The<br><br>
following process parameters were controlled: pH, temperature, pO , pressure and agitation rate. The bioreactor was equipped for dialysis mode with hollow fibre cartridges. The cartridges were connected to an external loop with a dialysis medium reservoir. The dialysis of the culture was started 2-4 days after inoculation. During fermentation the reservoir is repeated filled up with fresh dialysis medium. Some medium components were fed as separate sterile solutions to the bioreactor. These comprise glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and trace elements.<br>
Fermentation was terminated after a maximum of 16 days.<br>
The citrate was added to the fermentation medium and to the dialysis medium.<br>
Results  Example 1<br>
Tables 1 und 2 show the specific consumption rate of glucose and the CTI of runs with and without the addition of citrate (similar results can be found if fumarate is used). The fermentations were performed in the dialysis mode at the 1000 L scale. The addition of citrate to the media reduced the specific consumption rate for glucose about 44 % and increased the CTI about 105 %. At the same time the specific production rate for lactate was reduced about 60 % (Tables 3 and 4).<br>
During fermentation the specific production rate of the POI were nearly constant, therefore the amounts of POI comparatively increased with the CTI.<br><br><br><br>
The addition of citrate to the fermentation medium reduces  the amount of alkali about 66% which is required to adjust the pH during the cultivations (Tables 3 and 4).<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The cells of a myeloma cell line were thawed (Sp2/0) and expanded up to 2 L in spinner flasks for the inoculation of a 10 L bioreactor.<br>
The production bioreactor ran in a fed batch mode. The bioreactor was a stirred tank reactor with a working volume of 9 - 13 L. Aeration was performed by sparging. The following process parameters were controlled: pH, temperature, p02, pressure and agitation rate. The feeding of the culture was started 2-4 days after inoculation. Components were fed as separate sterile solutions to the bioreactor comprise glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and trace elements.<br>
Fermentation was terminated after maximum of 10 days.<br>
The bi- and tricarbonic acids was added to the fermentation medium and the feeding medium.<br>
Results of Example 2<br>
Tables 5 und 6 show the specific production rate and the CTI of runs with and without the addition of citrate. The fermentations were performed in the fed batch mode at the 10 L scale. The addition of citrate to the media reduced the specific consumption rate for glucose about 44% and increased the CTI about 241 %. At the same time the specific formation rate for lactate reduced about 52 %. This demonstrates the inhibition of the ^ metabolic flux from glucose througt the glycolysis by the addition of citrate.<br><br>
