FABRIC SOFTENING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to fabric softening<br>
compositions which provide additional benefits to the<br>
fabric, particularly improved crease reduction and/or ease<br>
of ironing.	<br>
Background and: Prior Art;;<br>
Fabric softener compositions, especially those added in the rinse, are well known.  It is also known to incorporate one or more additional materials such as silicones, to reduce wrinkling of the fabric during the rinsing and drying stages of the wash.  For example WO-A-96/15309 discloses the use of a combination of a silicone and a film-forming polymer for this purpose.  Typical silicones in this application are polydiorganosiloxanes. Nevertheless, there remains a need in fabric softening compositions-' to formulate'with .additives which not only reduce, the .appearance of' wrinkles, or creases before ironing, but also make ironing easier.<br>
In many prior art compositions, the silicones are incorporated in the form of an emulsion, which is a micro-emulsion, that is to say the silicone is present as liquid droplets having a droplet size less than the wavelength of visible light and so the emulsion is substantially transparent.  However, in a few cases, they are macro-emulsions (e.g. WO-A-97/31997 and  98).  The silicones before emulsification are those having relatively low<br><br>
viscosities, because it is assumed that those with higher viscosities are more difficult to handle during the process of manufacturing the product and are less suited for anti-creasing performance.  WO-A-95/24460 discloses a fabric softening composition which contains from about 0.2% to about 2 0% of a polydimethyl siloxane having a viscosity from about 2 to 5,000 centi Stok.es . (cSt.) .<br>
It: has .now been discovered that,, surprisingly, good antl-creas-ingf and/or ease-of ironing,' can-be achieved by formulating with a silicone which is incorporated in the form of a macro-emulsion and which silicone has a viscosity of from 1C,OOOcSt to 1,000,OOOcSt, and/or the emulsified silicone has a median droplet size of at least 0.2μm and is emulsified with at least one cationic surfactant.<br>

Emulsified Silicone<br>
According to .the. first and.third aspects- of. the present-invention, in the emulsified silicone, the silicone droplets are incorporated to be in the form of a macro-emulsion, that is to say the droplets have a median size in the wavelength range corresponding to the visible spectrum, or even larger. Preferably, the emulsion is an oil-in-water emulsion.  The term median size  refers to the number average.  The visible spectrum is 0.39,um to 0.77μm.  In the emulsion, the silicone droplets are then preferably from 0.39μm to 25μm. In the second and fourth aspects of the present invention, in. the emulsion, the silicone droplets have a median, size of at' least 0.2μm, preferably at least 0.25μm.  The droplet size may be determined based on measurements of meaian DV05 using a Malvern X Mastersizer.<br>

Preferably, in'compositions according to the' first and-third aspects of the present invention and certainly in those according to the second and fourth aspects of the invention, emulsification is effected using one or more cationic surfactants, preferably having a non-halogen counter-ion.<br>
The cationic emulsifiers are believed to enhance deposition of the silicone during use of the fabric softening composition.  Preferred counter-ions include methosulphate,<br><br>
ethosulphate, tosylate, phosphate and nitrate.  If a halogen counter-ion is used, it is preferably chloride.<br>
For example, mixtures of one or more cationic and one or more nonionic surfactants can be used, or even nonionic surfactant(s) alone.<br>

Preferably, the weight ratio of silicone to total emulsifying surfactant(s) is from.2.3:1 to 120:1, more preferably 3:1 to 120:1, for example from 3:1 to 30:1. Typical cationic surfactants are alkyl tri-methylammonium methosulphates and derivatives in which at least two of the methyl groups on the nitrogen atom are replaced by (poly)alkoxylated groups.<br><br>
In the final product, the weight ratio of total fabric softening agent to total silicone is from 1:1 to 70:1, more preferably from 1.5:1 to 25:1, more preferably 2.5:1 to 10:1, eg 3:1 to 7:1.<br>
Perfume<br>
The compositions may 'Comprise perfume.  If present, the level of perfumes in "the compositions may be 0.2 5% to 2% by weight, preferably 0.27%, to 2%, such as 0.3% to 1.5%.<br>

The preferred product form is a liquid, more especially an aqueous liquid.  In liquid products, a viscosity control agent may be included.  Any viscosity control agent typically used with rinse conditioners is suitable, for example biological polymers such as Xanthum gum (Kelco ex Kelsan and Rhodopol ex Rhone-Poulenc)-  Synthetic polymers<br><br>
may also be used as viscosity control agents e.g. polyacrylic acid, poly vinyl pyrolidone, polyethylene, carbomers, polyethylene, polyethylene glycols and cellulose-based thickeners such as hydroxy-ethyl cellulose modified to include long chain substituent groups.  Also suitable as viscosity modifiers are decoupling polymers and defloccculating polymers.<br>
It is preferred that the compositions are substantially free of bleaches.<br>

Example 3 (Performance Evaluation)<br>
Compositions comprising by weight 12.1%  of the cationic softener of Examples 1 and 2, 0.7% coconut 2 0 EO nonionic, 0.7% tallow alcohol and 3% polydimethyl-siloxane (% active) obtained from different emulsions containing nonionic emulsifier and 50'%' by weight of the silicone active: ingredient. , To evaluate the first and third aspects-of the present invention, the viscosity and median droplet sizes were varied between these different emulsions.<br>
The nonionic-emulsified silicone emulsion was type HV600, avEiilable ex Dow Corning, but with the silicone viscosity and median aroplet size being varied by the supplier, the other components being per the standard commercial product.<br>
These formulations were evaluated in the rinse cycle as follows:-<br>
White cotton shirts were washed 4 times at 60°C to remove any pre-existing treatments which would distort the results.<br>
Wash/rinse/dry cycles were then carried out.  The conditions were as follows:<br><br>
Machine:	Candy Aguaviva 1000<br>
Temperature:       40°C<br>
Programme:	Programme 5 - Non-fast coloureds<br>
recommended for cotton<br>
Water hardness:     13 °FH (Wirral water)<br>
Main wash product:  150g Persil Bio powder via shuttle Rinse products:     35 gm of a control\ composition<br>
containing 3% PDMS'with a<br>
viscosity of. 60., QOOcSt before<br>
emulsification OR 35 gm of a- test<br>
composition containing 3% PDMS<br>
with viscosities before<br>
emulsification in the range<br>
l,0Q0cSt to 75O,000cSt<br>
Washload:	10 shirts<br>
Drying:	Hung on rails indoors<br>
2 extra shirts were added to the washes so that extraction could be carried out anc;. silicone, deposition estimated.. These were split evenly over the washes.<br>
Desized cotton, poplin monitors were included 'for each product; 3 X 20cm by 20cm and 3 X 50dm by 100cm desized cotton poplin monitors were also included for measurement of fabric physical properties.<br>
The garments were assessed for:<br>
1.	Degree of creasing before ironing<br>
2.	Ease of ironing, Using steam<br><br>
The degree of creasing was assessed by paired comparisons between garments rinsed in the test and control products respectively.  The garments were placed in the viewing cabinet and the assessor was asked Which is the least creased? .  For the ease of ironing comparison, the panellist ironed two shirts using steam and was asked Which is the .easiest to iron? .  The irons used were Philips Azur 50 set at-the. temperature for cotton.  100ml of water was added for each panellist. The steam was set' at: maximum. Separate irons were used for each treatment to avoid possible transfer of rinse conditioner or silicone via the plate of the iron.  The irons were washed and swapped halfway through the exercise to compensate for differences in the irons.  Identical ironing boards were used.<br>
The result obtained are summarised in the following table:-<br><br><br>
Sample (a) does not correspond to the invention, the viscosity being within the prior art range.  All of samples (b)-(h) showed a marked improvement in degree of creasing over sample, (a) -  All except (d) ,, (e.).. and (h), showed a marked improvement .over (a) in terms of ease of ironing.<br><br>

The products were dosed at 110ml to a washing machine rinse cycle and both shirts and T-shirts were evaluated for anti-creasing and ease of ironing.  The cationic and nonionic products were compared as a % of the control (i.e. minus silicone).  Silicone deposition was evaluated by a standard method.  The results obtained were as follows-.-<br><br>
