				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to: a dextran-comprising composition for promoting bacterial proliferation for selectively proliferating Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (hereinafter, abbreviated as "L. casel subsp. casel") which is one species of lactic acid bacteria having a variety of biological activities; and the composition for promoting bacterial proliferation, which further comprises L. casel subsp. casel. More specifically, the present invention relates to: a pharmaceutical composition for enhancing biological activities, which comprises the composition for promoting bacterial proliferation; and a health food and feed for enhancing biological activities, which comprise the composition for promoting bacterial proliferation.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, ingestion of "microorganism formulations" which are referred to as probiotics and consist of useful microorganisms such as living lactic acid bacteria for the purpose of effect of controlling intestinal  function,  prevention  of  infectious  diseases.<br><br>
immunostimulation, or the like has been attracting attraction. However, there is a doubt whether the useful microorganisms can grow and colonize in the intestine of a human being, animal, or the like. If the useful microorganisms cannot grow and colonize in the intestine, expected biological activities of the useful microorganisms cannot be obtained permanently. In order to solve such a problem, the fact is that supplying the microorganism formulation at all times is proposed and performed. On the other hand, oligosaccharides or the like which can be utilized by useful microorganisms in probiotics are referred to as prebiotics, and ones prepared by combining prebiotics and probiotics are referred to as symbiotics. Those are also administered to a human being, animal, or the like for the aforementioned purpose. However, when the prebiotics are utilized by great many enteric bacteria other than intended bacteria, those bacteria scramble for the prebiotics in the intestine, so it is difficult to grow and colonize intended useful microorganisms selectively.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is, after ingestion of useful microorganisms referred to as probiotics to a human being, animal, or the like, to sustain a variety of biological activities originated from the useful microorganisms in a living body by selectively growing proliferating and colonizing the microorganisms in the<br><br>
intestine or by selectively growing and -proliferating useful indigenous microorganisms in the intestine without supplying those useful microorganisms at all times.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found out through an in vitro test that, among many useful microorganisms, L. casei subsp. casei is a species of bacteria capable of growing-proliferating byutilizingadextran. L. casei subsp. casei is classified and named in Approved Lists (1980). The bacterium is Gram positive, indigenous to the intestine of a human being, animal, or the like, and a facultative anaerobic bacillus. The bacterium forms the intestinal bacterial flora together with other bacteria.<br>
Thus, at first, it was confirmed whether or not the bacterium itself has biological activities, for example, an immunostimulating effect in the case of subcutaneous immunization. As a result, the bacterium has been found to enhance and maintain humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Next, L. casei subsp. casei has been administered to a mouse only in the initial administration, and a dextran was then orally ingested permanently, in order to confirm whether L. casei subsp. casei can selectively grow-proliferate and colonize in the intestine of a human being, animal, or the like, and the biological activities of the bacterium can be sustained or not by oral ingestion of a dextran. As a result, the inventors of the present invention have found through an in vivo test that<br><br>
the bacterium grows-proliferates and colonizes in the intestine by utilizing the dextran, and the biological activities of the bacterium such as humoral immunity and cellular immunity are enhanced and maintained.<br>
On the other hand, a dextran itself is also known to have a variety of biological activities, and it has been confirmed that, in the case of administration of a dextran together with L. casel subsp. casel, a higher effect is maintained than that in the case of administration of only a dextran and a synergistic effect is large.<br>
The present invent ion has been accomplished as described above . The gist of the present invention is as follows. {1) A composition for promoting bacterial proliferation for selectively proliferating Lactobacillus    casel    subsp. casel, comprising a dextran.<br>
(2)	The composition for promoting bacterial proliferation according to (1), further comprising Laetobaelllus  casei  subsp. casel.<br>
(3)	The composition for promoting bacterial proliferation according to (1), wherein the dextran has a molecular weight of 2,000 to 40,000,000.<br>
(4)	A pharmaceutical composition comprising the composition for<br>
promoting bacterial proliferation according to any one of (1) to<br>
(3) .<br>
(5} A health food comprising the composition for promoting bacterial<br><br>
proliferation according to any one of {1) to (3). (6) A   feed comprising the composition for promoting bacterial proliferation according to any one of (1) to (3).<br>

Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in more detail by way of examples, but the present invention is not limited thereto . <example> Dextran preparation method using sucrose as principal material<br>
Leuconostocmesenteroides, which is one species of lactic acid bacteria, was inoculated in a medium containing sucrose as a principal material {sucrose-containing enriched medium), and cultured anaerobically at 25oC for 24 hours . Subsequently, methanol was added to the culture supernatant, and the resultant precipitates were dissolved in distilled water. After the insolubles had been removed, methanol was added thereto again, and the resultant precipitates were redissolved in distilled water. The mixture was subjected to spray drying, to thereby yield a dextran. The dextran was further partially hydrolyzed, and the resultant products were subjected to methanol fractionation and spray drying, to thereby yield dex trans having a variety of molecular weights. <example> Test of Dextran-utilizing ability of enteric bacteria<br><br>
A variety of related enteric bacteria were inoculated in a PYF medium (Peptone yeast extract Fildes solution broth) to which a dextran having a molecular weight (number average) of 10,000 (in the following examples, a dextran having such a molecular weight was used unless otherwise defined) was added to 0.5%, and the dextran-utilizing ability was determined. As a result, two strains of L. casei subsp. casei (JCM 1134 and JCM 8129} were confirmed to have the dextran-utilizing ability. However, no dextran-utilizing ability was observed for other lactic acid bacteria such as bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium, and other related enteric bacteria.  (See Table<br><br><br><br><br>
[Table   1-2]   Dextran-utilizing   ability  cf   related  enteric  bacteria<br>
Moreover, using two strains of L. casei subsp. casel, a difference of the utilizing abilities according to dextrans having different molecular weights was determined. As a result, for all tested dextrans, the dextran-utilizing abilities were confirmed. However, a dextran having a smaller molecular weight has a tendency<br><br><br>
Effect of dextran on bacterial number of L.   casei  subsp. casei  in mouse feces<br>
12 eight-week-old BALB/c male mice were divided into two groups of six each. Those groups were referred to as {1) control group and (2) dextran group. Over the test period from the beginning of the test, a conventional feed was given to (1) , while a dextran-added conventional feed (75 rag dextran/kg conventional feed) was given to (2) . Over the period of three days from the beginning of the test, L. casei subsp. casei cells were orally inoculated to both groups (106 cells/mouse) . On 28th day, each mouse was dissected, and the feces were collected from the large intestine.  The feces<br><br>
were serially diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the resultant mixture was smeared on a dextran-added LB medium, followed by culture at 37°C for 48 hours. After colonies had been stained by Gram staining and observed, the bacterial number of L. casei subsp. casei in feces was counted. As a result, the bacterial number of L. casei subsp. ca.sei in the dextran group was significantly larger than that in the control group. (See Fig. 1) <example><br>
