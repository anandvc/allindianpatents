BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Related Application<br>
This patent application is a continuation-in-part of patent application entitled "Stabilizers for High Nitrile Multipolymers", USSN 08/494, 833 and filed on June 26, 195, which is a continuation-in-part of patent application entitled "Stabilizers for Acrylonitrile/Methacrylonitrile Multipolymers", USSN 08/ 171487 and filed on December 21, 1993.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a stabilizer composition for high nitrile multipolymers, in particular an acrylonitrile olefinically unsaturated multipolymer and the like and a method for stabilizing the high nitrile multipolymer. More particularly, the invention relates to the stabilization of an acrylonitrile olefinically unsaturated multipolymer and the like against thermal degradation, melt processing conditions and heat discoloration by the inclusion of maleic acid and its derivatives, salts of maleic acid, maleic<br>
anhydrides, malearnides and its salts and maleates and its salts into the nitrile multipolymer.  It is understood that the term multipolymei includes copolymers, terpolymers and multimonomer polymers throughout this specification.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Nitrile polymers have excellent physical, thermal and mechanical properties such as barrier properties, chemical resistance, rigidity, heat resistance, UV resistance, moisture retention and bacteria resistance. Acrylic polymers are high nitrile polymers that are desirable in the production of fibrous textiles, films, molded objects, packaging applications and the like.<br>
However, acrylic polymers and other high nitrile multipolymers having long repeating sequences of the same nitrile monomer unit, in particular an acrylonitrile monomer unit, are known to degrade when heated and processed by commercial methods. The long sequences of nitrile monomer units make the acrylic polymers non-processable without the use of a solvent because the polymer degrades at an ever increasing rate above 150°C. The acrylic polymer further becomes yellow, orange, red and eventually black as it degrades.<br>
An acrylonitrile olefinically unsaturated multipolymer is disclosed in USSN 08/387,303 entitled "A Process for Making a High Nitrile Multipolymer Prepared From Acrylonitrile and Olefinically Unsaturated Monomers." An acrylonitrile/methacrylonitrile copolymer is disclosed in USSN 08/150,515 entitled "A Process for Making a Polymer of Acrylonitrile, Methacrylonitnle and Olefinically<br>
Unsaturated Monomers" and a multipolymer of acrylonitrile/methacrylonitrile/olefinically unsaturated monomer is disclosed in USSN 08/149,880 entitled "A Process for Making an Acrylonitrile/Methacrylonitrile Copolymer." The acrylonitrile/methacrylonitrile multipolymers are thermally processed without the use of solvents to yield acrylic fibers. However, the multipolymers are subject to thermal degradation albeit not as severely as the commercial acrylic fiber polymer.<br>
Thermoplastic nitrile barrier polymer resins are known in the art and have been described in United States Patent Nos. 3, 426,102; 3,586,737 and 5,106,925. These nitrile polymers are known to have desirable barrier properties and chemical resistance. However, these thermoplastic nitrile polymers while melt-processable are difficult to process.<br>
It is advantageous to reduce the thermal degradation and prevent thermal discoloration of high nitrile multipolymers. There is a need to readily melt process an acrylonitrile olefmically unsaturated multipolymer and the like without thermal degradation, thermal discoloration and decrease of the viscosity of the high nitrile multipolymer.<br>
It has been discovered that maleic acid and its derivatives	<br>
and its salts, maleic anhydrides, malearnides and-ifeg salts and maleates and i|s-salts greatly reduce thermal degradation, thermal discoloration and decrease the viscosity when added to a high nitrile multipolymer, in particular an acrylonitrile olefmically unsaturated multipolymer.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,954,913 entitled "Stabilized Nitrile Polymers" and U.S. Pat. No. 3,984,499 entitled "Thermally Stable High Nitrile Resins and Methods for Producing the Same" both assigned to The<br>
Standard Oil Company relate to nitrile polymers, in particular a Barex® polymer which is a 75:25 acrylonitrile/methyl acrylate polymer containing 5% to 25% of an elastomeric component.  The patents disclose that the nitrile polymer can be stabilized against thermal discoloration by certain derivatives of maleic acid, in particular mono-esters of certain organic polycarboxylic acids.  It has been reported by Faserforschung und Textiltechnik, Volume 21, No. 3 (1970), that maleic acid and some of its derivatives are useful inhibitors against thermal discoloration of a nitrile polymer.  Further, it states that "the complete indifference of the maleic acid esters" for the stabilization of nitrile polymers. U.S. Patent No. 3,520,847 discloses that maleimides and derivatives thereof are thermal and anti-discoloration agents for acrylonitrile polymers and copolymers. The article and the patents do not disclose nor suggest the use of maleic acid and its derivatives, maleic acid and its salts, maleic,, anhydrides, maleamides and  their salts, and maleates and their salts for the reduction of thermal degradation and maintenance of melt processability of a high nitrile polymer.<br>
It is advantageous to reduce the thermal degradation and thermal discoloration of high nitrile multipolymers by the stabilizer composition of the present invention. The stabilizer composition reduces melt viscosity and prevents further increases of viscosity of the high nitrile multipolymer during melt processing.  Further, the stabilizer composition of the present invention reduces crosslinkmg and molecular weight build-up of the high nitrile multipolymer during melt processing. Additionally, color development of the nitrile multipolymer during thermal processing is retarded.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A. stabilizer composition for a high nitrile multipolymer comprises maleic acid and its derivatives, maleic acid and its salts, maleic anhydride, maleamides and their salts, and maleates and their salts. The inclusion of the stabilizer composition in a high nitrile multipolymer reduces thermal degradation, discoloration, molecular weight growth and cross-linking which lead to intractability and increased melt viscosity of the multipolymer.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a composition comprising a melt-processable high nitrile multi polymer being in admixture with a stabilizer composition said stabilizer composition comprising maleic acid and its derivatives, salts of maleic acid, maleic anhydride, maleamides, salts of maleamides, maleates, salts of maleates, and combinations thereof and wherein said stabilizer composition reduces thermal degradation, decreases melt viscosity during thermal processing and reduces thermal discoloration of the high nitrile multipolymer; wherein said stabilizer composition is added in the range of 0.1% to 10% by weight of the said high nitrile multipolymer.<br>
The process of the present invention relates to a composition which is a synergistic mixture having unexpected or surprising properties.<br>
The process of the present invention produces a thermally stable nitrile multipolymer, in particular a thermally stable acrylonitrile olefincally unsaturated multipolymer. The thermally stable nitrile multipolymer may be further processed by spinning into fibers, injection molding, extrusion, blow extrusion, blow molding and the like.<br>

All four applications are assigned to The Standard Oil Company and incorporated herein.<br>
The nitrile multipolymer can be prepared by any known method such as an emulsion, a solution, a suspension or in continuous addition bulk process. The polymerization process is generally carried out as an aqueous emulsion or suspension process in the presence of a multimonomer feed mixture of an acrylonitrile monomer and an olefinically unsaturated monomer; a surfactant or suspending aid; optionally a molecular weight modifier; and a free radical initiator at a temperature in the range of about 40°C to 120°C in the substantial absence of molecular oxygen. The acrylonitrile olefinically unsaturated multimonomer feed mixture contains about 95% by weight to about 20% by weight acrylonitrile monomer, 80% by weight to about 5% by weight olefinically unsaturated monomer. The polymerization process is carried out by continuous or incremental addition of each of the reactants.<br>
The reaction is continued until polymerization has proceeded to the desired extent, generally from about 40% to about 99%<br><br>
conversion and preferably from about 70% to about 95% conversion The high nitrile multipolymer generally contains 50% by weight to about 95% by weight polymerized acrylonitrile and about 5% by weight to about 50% by weight polymerized olefinicaliy unsaturated monomer.<br>
At the conclusion of the polymerization reaction the acrylonitrile olefinicaliy unsaturated multipolymer is isolated as a slurry, or a latex. Any known technique may be used to isolate the acrylonitrile olefinicaliy unsaturated multipolymer such as crumb coagulation, spraying the solution of the multipolymer into a heated and/or evacuated chamber to remove the water vapors, stripping, filtration, centrifugation and the like.<br>
The high nitrile multipolymer has reduced thermal	<br>
degradation, reduced thermal discoloration and exhibited less   MELT viscosity increase in subsequent thermal processing steps due to the presence of the stabilizer composition in the high nitrile multipolymer.<br>
The high nitrile multipolymer with the stabilizer composition may be processed into a wide variety of useful articles by thermal melt spinning, extrusion in the absence of solvent and in the absence of water, injection molding, calendering, vacuum forming, milling, molding, drawing, blowing and the like. The use of the stabilizer reduces thermal degradation, discoloration, cross-linking and melt viscosity increase of the nitrile multipolymer products during the thermoprocessing of the nitrile multipolymer.<br>
SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following examples demonstrate the process and advantages of the present invention.<br>
Multipolymer Preparation<br>
Equipment<br>
A 50 gallon circulating hot water jacketed stainless steel reactor was equipped with a reflux condenser, thermocouple/controller, a turbine agitator, nitrogen gas inlet line, vacuum line, and two monomer feed stream pumps. The two monomer feed mixtures were metered, as separate single solutions, by constant feed pumps.<br>
Procedure<br>
The reactor was initially charged with about 293 lbs. of distilled water, about 2.75 lbs. of Rhofac RE-610, about 0.85 lbs. of N-octyl mercaptan, about 7.04 lbs. of acrylonitrile monomer and about 2.96 lbs. of methacrylonitrile monomer. The reactor was then purged with nitrogen and heated to about 60°C.  After temperature was obtained, a slurry containing 0.47 lbs. of the initiator Vazo 52, about two lbs. of water and about 0.25 lbs. of Rhofac RE-610 was added along with two separate monomer feed streams. The first monomer feed was composed of about 70.4 lbs. of acrylonitrile and about 29.6 lbs. of methacrylonitrile and fed to the reactor at a<br>
uniform rate over a period of about 270 minutes.  The second monomer feed was pure methacrylonitrile which was fed to the reactor at about 0.0222 lbs/min. for about the first 90 minutes, at about 0.0356 lbs/min. from about 90 to about 180 minutes and finally at a rate of 0.113 lbs./min. for about 180 to about 270 minutes.  During the course of the reaction, about 1.19 lbs of N-octyl mercaptan was added at about 90 minutes and at about 180 minutes.<br>
At the end of the reaction (about 270 minutes) the reaction was stripped of unreacted monomer by vacuum stripping at about 60°C for about three hours. The latex was then coagulated with alum solution at about 81°C to about 85°C and washed with water at about 75°C, and dried. The result was a course, free flowing, white polymer powder, designated polymer A. The multipolymer composition of A was 54%(wt.) acrylonitrile and 46%(wt.) methacrylonitrile with a. molecular weight of 143,000.<br>
Preparation of Mono Esters of Maleic Acid<br>
Maleate monoesters were prepared by reacting equal molar quantities of an alcohol and maleic anhydride under anhydrous conditions.  For example, monolauryl maleate was prepared by reacting about 5.27 moles of lauryl alcohol (1-dodecanol), with about 5.27 moles of maleic anhydride. The alcohol was melted in about a 50°C air oven, weighed, and poured into a jacketed glass 2 liter reactor which had been preheated to about 50°C. The crushed maleic anhydride was added to the melted alcohol and stirring was started. The reactor was fitted with a 3" 4-bladed Teflon paddle rotating at about 350 rpm. The reactor was open to the atmosphere<br>
via a port which was fitted with a drying tube containing anhydrous CaS04-  Heat was supplied to the reactor by circulating water, from a thermostatically controlled bath, through the jacket. After about 25 minutes the temperature of the reaction mixture was increased to about 60°C. The appearance of the reactants changed from a slurry to a hazy liquid to, finally, a clear colorless liquid. After another hour the temperature was increased to about 70°C. Thirty minutes later the temperature was raised to about 80°C, where it remained for the balance of the 6 hour total reaction time. The liquid product was poured directly from the reactor, without cooling, into a series of shallow trays, where the liquid was allowed to cool and solidify. The product was broken up and bottled. About 1516.6g product was obtained resulting in about a 99.43% recovery. NMR analysis of the product showed the product consisted of about 94.2% monolauryl maleate, about 3.7% dilauryl maleate, about 1.0% maleic acid, and about 1.1% lauryl alcohol.<br>
Stabilizer Addition Procedure:<br>
Powder Blending:<br>
Finely divided stabilizer is dry blended with polymer powder by any effective mixer.   For example, about 1.04 gms. of the stabilizer that has been ground in a mortar and pestle to a powder is added to about 50.96 gms of polymer. This powder was blended on a roll-mill for 3 hours before being subjected to melt processing evaluation.<br>
Latex Blending:<br>
An aqueous emulsion of the stabilizer is mixed with the polymer latex and the two are co-coagulated to yield an intimately mixed stabilizer/polymer crumb. A stabilizer emulsion was prepared by heating a mixture of about 10 gms lauryl maleate and about 2 gms of Dowfax 2A (emulsifier manufactured by Dow Chem. Co.) to about 60°C until homogeneous. To the mixture was added about 88 gms. of about 60°C water gradually with stirring. The pH of the mixture was then adjusted to 6 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide yielding a low viscosity, translucent emulsion. This stabilizer emulsion can be added in the desired amount to the polymer latex to achieve the needed level.<br>
Testing Procedure:<br>
Brabender Plasticorder:<br>
The Brabender plasticorder is a low shear melt mixing device that measures the torque (m-gms) required to melt stir a molten polymer and is manufactured by the Brabender Instrument Co., S. Hackensack, NJ. The Brabender Plasticorder is routinely used to judge the melt processability of Barex® resins as a quality control measure.  It can easily determine whether a polymer can be melted and processed on normal thermoplastic equipment.  Brabender analyses were run at about 200°C with torque readings taken at about 5 minute intervals to about 30 minutes. This method measures polymer degradation as a function of time, temperature, and physical abrading.<br><br>
Color:<br>
About 1 gram of multipolymer sample with stabilizer is withdrawn from the Brabender after 10 minutes and again after 30 minutes. Each sample is dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) to make a 5.0% by weight solution in the DMF. Each solution is then compared to the Gardner Color Standards for Liquid 1953 Series, made by Gardner Laboratory, Inc., Bethesda, Maryland. The Color Standards for Liquid describes color on a scale of 1 to 18, wherein 1 describes a colorless liquid and 18 describes a beer bottle brown color.<br>
Stabilizer Evaluation:<br>
Example 1: Polymer A<br>
Dry blends were prepared from Polymer A and various maleic<br>
acid derivatives at the 2% (by weight) level. These blends were<br>
subjected to Brabender plastication and torque measurements at     <br>
about 200°C at about 35 rpm. <br>
  The torque<br>
required to masticate the melt, a measure of melt viscosity, was reported in meter-grams (m-gm).<br>
Table I (Table Removed)<br>
The above results demonstrate that the addition of the stabilizer composition in the acrylonitrile/methacrylonitrile multipolymer reduces the initial melt viscosity and retards its growth during the melt processing.  For instance, lauryl maleate and cetyl maleate in the nitrile multipolymer show essentially no viscosity increase in about 30 minutes at about 200°C. The above comparison of stabilizers demonstrate that the maleates are unexpectedly better than the maleimides.<br>
Example 2: Polymer B. Mono Maleate Ester Evaluation:<br>
Polymer B of the same AN/MAN composition as Polymer A but having a molecular weight of 69,000 was dry blended with various maleate mono esters and subjected to Brabender plastication at about 200°C and about 35 rpm.<br>
Dry blends were prepared from the polymer B and various maleic acid derivatives at the 2% (by weight) level.  These blends were subjected to Brabender plastication and torque measurements at<br>
about 200°C at about 35 rpm. The torque required to masticate the melt, a measure of melt viscosity, is reported in meter-grams (m-gm).<br>
TABLE<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The above results demonstrate that mono maleates effectively reduce initial melt viscosity and retard viscosity increases of the nitrile multipolymer during melt processing.<br>
Example 3<br>
A dry polymer comprising about 85% acrylonitrile (AN) and about 15% methyl acrylate (MA) and dry stabilizer were intimately mixed on a roll mill for about 2 hours at room temperature. The torque required to masticate the melt, a measure of melt viscosity was reported in meter-grams (m-gm), color measurements were made and a maleimide stabilizer was compared to the maleates, and the results are set forth in Table III.<br>
Example 4<br>
A dry polymer comprising about 85% acrylonitrile and about 15% ethyl acrylate (EA) and dry stabilizer were intimately mixed on a roll mill for about 2 hours at room temperature. The torque required to masticate the melt, a measure of melt viscosity was reported in meter-grams (m-gm) and color measurements were made, and the results are set forth in Table III.<br><br><br>
Example 5<br>
A dry polymer comprising about 85% acrylonitrile, about 7% methyl methacrylate (MMA) and about 7% methyl acrylate and dry stabilizer were intimately mixed on a roll mill for about 2 hours at room temperature. The torque required to masticate the melt, a measure of melt, viscosity was reported in meter-grams (m-gm) and color measurements were made, and the results are set forth in Table III.<br>
Example 6<br>
A dry polymer comprising about 75% acrylonitrile and about 25% methyl methacrylate and dry stabilizer were intimately mixed on a roll mill for about 2 hours at room temperature. The torque required to masticate the melt, a measure of melt viscosity was reported in meter-grams (m-gm) and color measurements were made, and the results are set forth in Table III.<br>
Example 7<br>
A polymer comprising about 85% acrylonitrile and about 15% methyl acrylate was prepared by a continuous feed emulsion process and recovered as described for polymer A.  Dry stabilizer was added to the polymer and intimately mixed mechanically. The torque required to masticate the melt, a measure of melt viscosity was reported in m-gm and color measurements were made. The results are set forth in Table III and demonstrate lowered final torque values and improved final color.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
"Wherein Ca=calcium, Mg=magnesium and Sr=strontium<br>
The above results demonstrate that the inclusion of the stabilizer into the nitrile multipolymer greatly reduces viscosity of the nitrile multipolymer during melt processing.  Further, the above table demonstrates that the color is better with the inclusion of the stabilizer into the nitrile multipolymer.<br>
Additionally, Example 3 compares the stabilizer lauryl maleate to phenyl maleimide. The data demonstrates that the lauryl maleate is unexpectedly better in color and initial melt torque than the phenyl maleimide. It is unexpected that the lauryl maleate is a better stabilizer for a high nitrile multipolymer than the phenyl maleimide.<br>
