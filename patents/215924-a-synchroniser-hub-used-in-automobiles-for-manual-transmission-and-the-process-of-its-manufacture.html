				<td>A SYNCHRONISER HUB USED IN AUTOMOBILES FOR MANUAL TRANSMISSION AND THE PROCESS OF ITS MANUFACTURE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides for Powder Metallurgy component Synchroniser Hub used in automobiles for manual transmission, comprising a Pearlite microstructure with enhanced level of carbon content on its surface and Pearlite and Ferrite microstructure in the core. The present invention also provides for a process for the manufacture of said Synchroniser Hub.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART REFERENCES<br>
Many powder metallurgy components are used in application where they come in contact with other moving parts. Under these conditions, surface wear resistance is an important property, which the components must possess to perform well during application and with good core toughness.<br>
To achieve the dual properties, generally the PM components are heat treated in equipment such as a Sealed Quench Furnace after sintering the components.<br>
One disadvantage with such a process is the cost involved for the extra operation. The other disadvantage is that, the components are quenched in oil after austenising them and this causes distortion in the component. Hence, such components require further expensive operations such as grinding to meet the final pre-determined dimensions resulting in cost escalation.<br>
An alternative method, which is currently coming in vogue, is Sinter Hardening. In this method, hardening is achieved by increasing the alloying elements such as Ni, Cr, Mo, Mn and Cu in the PM components and forced cooling the parts to room temperature after sintering. The cooling rate is increased by improving heat transfer; either by increasing the volume flow of gas or by having improved cooling through an annular water cooling jacket. The equipment is expensive and addition of metals such as Mo escalates part cost. By this process the parts are hardened throughout the section of the component as against case hardening which is ideally suited for application involving moving parts.<br><br>
In the prior art mentioned above, two separate furnaces are used; one for sintering and other for re-heating and oil quenching the parts.<br>
Patent AppUcation US 4,106,931 deals with an alternative protective gas based on nitrogen based atmospheres to prevent and or minimise surface decarburization, reduce additions of hydrocarbons and methods thereby to sinter products in this atmosphere. The carbon intrusion by this method is in the Hot Zone. This patent application US 4,106,931 uses only general ferrous materials. References:<br>
