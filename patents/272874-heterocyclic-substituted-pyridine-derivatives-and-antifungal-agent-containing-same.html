				<td>HETEROCYCLIC SUBSTITUTED PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES AND ANTIFUNGAL<br>
AGENT CONTAINING SAME<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic substituted pyridine derivatives and to antifungal agents comprising the same.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
In recent years, managements of opportunistic infections have become more and more significant more than ever because of an increase in the number of elderly people and immunocompromised patients as a result of advanced chemotherapies or the like. As demonstrated by the fact that opportunistic infections are occurring one after another by different avirulent pathogen, it is shown that the problem of infectious disease will not ends as long as there are underlying diseases that diminish the immune functions of patients. Consequently, new strategies for infectious diseases control, including the problem of drug-resistant pathogen, will be one of the important issues in the soon-to-come aged society.<br>
In the field of antifungal agents, heretofore, for instance, amphotericine B which is based on a polyene skeleton, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole which are based on an azole skeleton, or the like, have been developed for the treatment of deep seated mycoses. Most of pre-existing drugs already available commercially have similar mechanism of action, and currently, the appearance of azole-resistant fungi or the like has been problems.<br>
In recent years, as a 1,3-0-glucan synthetase inhibitor with a novel mechanism, naturally occurring compound-derived cyclic hexapeptides caspofungin<br>
 <br>
and micafungin or the like, have been developed; however, from the fact that these agents only exist in injectable form, they are not yet sufficient practically as antifungal agents.<br>
Since there have been the situations that the pre-existing antifungal agents are insufficient for treatment of the deep seated mycoses, there is a demand and need for development of agents which are based on a novel mechanism and are of high safety.<br>
As the related art relevant to antifungal agents based on such a novel mechanism, Patent Documents 1 and 2 describe pyridine derivatives which demonstrates effects against the onset, progress, and persistence of infections by inhibiting the expression of cell wall proteins, inhibiting the cell wall assembly and also adhesion onto cells, and preventing pathogens from showing pathogenicity, with the process which transports GPI (Glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchored proteins to the cell wall being inhibited.<br>
However, groups of the compounds disclosed in Patent Document 1 have 2-benzyl pyridine moieties as the common structure, clearly differing structurally from compounds according to the present invention. In addition, the groups of the compounds disclosed in Patent Document 1 bear the problem that, although these compounds demonstrate activities in vitro, they are easily metabolized inside the body. The group of compounds disclosed in Patent Document 2 exhibits excellent antifungal activity, but the group of representative compounds has the structure represented by the following formula:<br>
 <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
<br>
A1 = optionally substituted 3-pyridyl or quinolyl, etc.<br>
X1 = -C(=0)-NH, -NH-C(=0)-, etc.<br>
E = furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, phenyl, pyridyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, or pyrazolyl<br>
Looking only at those having pyridine ring skeletons, this group differs structurally<br>
from the compounds according to the present invention in that the common structure<br>
has a single ring bound via an amidemethylene linker at the pyridine ring 3-position.<br>
Patent Documents 3 to 5 also provide examples of related art with structures<br>
similar to the compounds according to the present invention. Patent Documents 3<br>
and 4 describe pyridine derivatives substituted by a pyrazole ring, which are used as<br>
glycine transporter inhibitors or 5-HT receptor ligands, while Patent Document 5<br>
describes 5-member heterocyclic substituted pyridine derivatives which are used as<br>
an AGE disruptor and inhibitor.<br>
However, Patent Documents 3 to 5 do not disclose the compounds according<br>
to the present invention, and the antifungal effects of the compounds disclosed in<br>
Patent Documents 3 to 5 against Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus and the like<br>
which are common fungi in human fungal disease are not disclosed.<br>

The compounds (I) of the present invention or salts thereof exhibits excellent inhibition activity on the GPI-anchored protein transport procees based on the inhibition of fungal GPI biosynthesis, anti-Cand/da activity and anti-Aspergillus activity, and are also superior in terms of its physical properties, safety and metabolic stability, making it extremely useful as a preventive or therapeutic agent for fungal infections.<br>
[Pharmacological test examples]<br>
In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the compounds (I) of the present invention, the antifungal activity of the compounds (I) of the present invention was measured by measuring 1; anti-Cand/da and anti-Aspergillus activity and 2; activity in the experimental systemic candidal infection model in mice. 1.        Anti-Cand/da activity and ant\-Aspergillus activity<br>
(1)	Preparation of fungal suspension<br>
For the C. albicans CAF2-1 strain, a fungal suspension from a standing culture for 48 hours at 30°C in a Sabouraud dextrose liquid culture medium (SDB) was diluted with RPMI1640 medium to adjust a fungal suspension of 1.2 x 103 cells / mL. For the A. fumigatus Tsukuba strain, -80°C stored strain was diluted with RPMI1640 medium to adjust to a fungal suspension of 4.5 x 103 cells / mL.<br>
(2)	Preparation of an agent dilution plate<br>
Using a U-bottomed 96 well plate, 8 samples / plate (A to H) of sample dilution solutions were prepared. On the 2nd to 12th rows were dispensed 10 uL of dimethyl sulfoxide solution. Weighted sample was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to prepare a 2.5 mg / mL solution, 20 uL of this solution was added to the first row of the prepared plate, and 12 steps of two-foled step dilutions (10 uL of solution + 10 uL of dimethyl sulfoxide solution) were performed on the plate. This sample dilution solution was dispensed in the amount of 1 uL to a flat-bottomed 96 well plate for MIC measurement to prepare a sample dilution plate.<br>
(3)	Inoculation of fungal suspension and culture<br>
The fungal suspension prepared in (1) was used in the amount of 99 uL / well to inoculate the flat-bottomed 96 well plate containing 1 uL / well of the test compound dilution prepared in (2), and a standing culture was carried out aerobically for 42-48 hours at 35°C.<br>
(4)	MIC measurementThe minimum concentration that clearly inhibited fungal growth as compared<br>
to the control by visual inspection was determined as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).<br>
The following representative compounds prepared in the examples were measured for anti-Cand/da activity and ar\t\-Aspergillus activity by the measurement method described in 1. As a result, as shown in Tables 1 to 6, it was found that the compounds according to the present invention clearly had anti-Cand/da and anti-Aspergillus activity.<br>

2.        Experimental systemic candidal infection model in mice<br>
(1)	Preparation of fungal inoculant<br>
A standing culture of C. albicans E81022 strain was carried out for 48 hours at 30°C in sabouraud dextrose agar medium (SDA), the recovered fungal cells were suspended in sterilized physiological saline.  By counting the fungal number on cytometry plate, the suspension was diluted to 2 x 107 cells / mL with sterilized physiological saline to serve fungal inoculum.<br>
(2)	Infection<br>
The fungal inoculum was used in the amounts of 0.2 mL to inoculate 4.5 to 5.5 week-old female ICR mice in the tail vein (4 x 106 cells/mouse).<br>
(3)	Treatment<br>
E0006 UP32-PCT<br>
From 0.5 to 1 hour after fungal inoculation, 0.2 mL of agent solution (dissolved or suspended in sterilized physiological saline containing 6.5% dimethyl sulfoxide and 3.5% Tween 80) was administered into the stomach using a peroral probe, 3 times every 4 hours. The agent concentration was 2.5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, and the number of animals in one group was 5 animals. (4)       Determination of effects<br>
The protective effect was determined by observing life/death until 14 days after infection and calculating the mean survival days.<br>
As a result, as shown in Tables 7 and 8, mice administered with the compounds of the present invention survived for a long time as compared to the untreated group, and the compounds according to the present invention have been also found to demonstrate anti-Cand/c/a activity in vivo.<br>
