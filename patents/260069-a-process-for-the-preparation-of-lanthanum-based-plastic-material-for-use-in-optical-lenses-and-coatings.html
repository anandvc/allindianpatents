				<td>FIELD OF  INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of polymeric materials for use in ophthalmic applications such as polarized lenses, light waveguides, optical fibres and as varnish composition for coating films.<br>
PRIOR ART;<br>
Plastic lenses have become popular in recent years for use in optical elements such as lenses. Resins which are widely used for the production of plastic lenses are diethylene glycol basally carbonate (1.50) and polyacrylates (1.45) Lenses prepared from them have a low refractive index than glass lenses (nd = 1.52). In order to obtain equivalent properties to glass lenses, it is necessary to increase the center thickness, peripheral thickness, and the curvature of the lens as a result of which the lens becomes very thick. Still other disadvantages are poor hardness and low impact strength.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of polymeric materials for use in optical lenses and coatings.<br>
Another   object of this   invention   is to   propose a   process for     the<br>
preparation    of   polymeric    materials for use in optical    lenses    and<br>
coatings which has a higher refractive index in comparison to that of<br>
the known art.<br>
A still another object of this invention  is to  propose a process for   the<br>
preparation    of   polymeric    materials for use in optical    lenses    and<br>
coatings which has a comparatively higher hardness.<br>
Yet  another  object of this   invention  is to  propose a  process for    the<br>
preparation    of   polymeric    materials for use in optical    lenses    and<br>
coatings which has   a higher   impact   strength   in   comparison   to the<br>
known art.<br>
A further   object   of this   invention   is to   propose a   process for    the<br>
preparation    of   polymeric    materials for use in optical    lenses    and<br>
coatings which is efficient.<br>
Further object and   advantages   of this invention will be more apparent<br>
from the ensuing description.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION;<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of plastic material for use in optical lenses and coatings comprising in the steps of :<br>
a)	dispersing   lanthanum oxide   in   acrylic to form a   monomer<br>
mixture;<br>
b)	adding   an   aromatic   carboxylic   acid   selected    from phenyl<br>
acetic acid or cinnamic acid to such a monomer mixture;<br>
c)	adding   a   cross   linking   such as   styrene to the mixture   of<br>
step c, and<br>
d)	and    subjecting    the mixture of      step ( c ) to the step of<br>
polymerization by gamma radiation.<br>
In accordance with this invention the process comprises in dispersing 14 to 17% by weight of lanthanum oxide in acrylic acid. It has been found that if more than 17% by weight of lanthanum oxide is added to acrylic acid, then the mixture is no longer homogenous as some of the metal salt precipitates out. The mixture is stirred at a temperature of 25 to 30Â°C to obtain a<br>
homogenous mixture. The mixture thus prepared is the monomer mixture.<br>
The monomer mixture has a refractive index of 1.461 upon addition of 17% by weight of metal salt with respect to acrylic acid and 1.493 upon addition of 14% by weight of addition of metal salt with respect to acrylic acid in comparison to a refractive index of 1.420 of acrylic acid.<br>
To such a mixture, an aromatic carboxylic acid is added to increase the refractive index. The aromatic carboxylic acid is selected from phenyl acetic acid or cinnamic acid. It has been found that cinnamic acid, a yellow colored substance imparts yellow colour to the material. Thus, in the instance where colour is not desired, such as spectacle lenses, phenyl acetic acid is used for the lense and for applications such as coatings, cinnamic acid is used. It has been found that the presence of metal ions is responsible for a substantial improvement in the impact strength of the polymer, even though the presence of such metal ions increases the refractive index of acrylic acid only marginally.<br>
As described hereinabove, the metal salt is first added and stirred to form a homogenous mixture. However, if the aromatic carboxylic acid is first added followed by addition of metal ions, then the dispersability decreases.<br>
The aromatic carboxylic acid is also added under stirring conditions and at ambient temperature, Phenyl acetic acid is added in an amount of 19 to 21% by weight of acrylic acid and cinnamic acid in an amount of 9 to 11% by weight of acrylic acid. If more than 21% by weight of phenyl acetic acid to acrylic acid or 11% by weight of cinnamic acid to acrylic acid is added to the mixture, there is no increase in the refractive index. However, if less than 19% by weight of phenyl acetic acid or 9% by weight of cinnamic acid is added to the mixture, then there is a reduction in the refractive index.<br>
A cross linking agent such a styrene is finally added to the mixture and in an amount of 0.3 to 0.4 moles. Styrene also assists in improving the cross linking of the monomer units.<br>
Such a mixture is subjected to the step of polymerization by gamma radiation in the presence of cobalt 60 as the radiation source. In the instance, where lenses are required, the mixture is subjected to the step of cast polymerization in glass moulds. The dose employed to achieve complete polymerization is 0.8 to 1.2 megarads.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing examples, which are not intended to impart any restriction on the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
5 gms of mixture containing 13% lanthanum oxide dispersed in acrylic acid and phenyl acetic acid was added to 3.12 gms of styrene. The mixture was poured into a mould made from two glass blanks and a gasket and subjected to gamma radiation in the<br>
presence   of  cobalt 60 at   a   dose   of  0.8 megarads.   The cast lens had the following properties :<br>
Refractive index	1.565<br>
Transmittance	&gt;90%<br>
Shore D-hardness	85<br>
Abbey no	35<br>
Impact strength	Passes FDA standards<br>
Example 2<br>
4.20 gms of   styrene   was added   to   5 gins   of   mixture     containing<br>
lanthanium oxide   dispersed   in acrylic   acid and   phenyl   acetic acid.<br>
Such a mixture    was injected    into glass mould and    subjected    to<br>
gamma    radiation in the presence of   cobalt    60 at a    dose of    1.2<br>
magards. The following properties were obtained:<br>
Refractive index	1.535<br>
Transmittance	&gt;90%<br>
Shore D-hardness	85<br>
Abbey no	35<br>
Impact strength	Passes FDA standards<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 2 was repeated except that cinnamic acid was used instead of phenyl acetic acid. The gamma radiation was carried out at a dose of 0.8 megarods. The polymerized material was yellow coloured which can be used as a coating.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br><br>
