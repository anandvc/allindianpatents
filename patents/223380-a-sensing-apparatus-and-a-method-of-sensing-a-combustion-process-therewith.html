METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE MONITORING AND CONTROL OF<br>
COMBUSTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention is directed tov/ard a method and apparatus for the monitoring<br>
and control of a combustion process, and more particularly toward the use of tunable diode<br>
laser absorption spectroscopy to monitor and control combustion processes.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A large percentage of the electrical power generated in the United States of America<br>
is created in coal combustion power plants.   The bulk of worldwide electricity production<br>
similarly relies on coal as a primary energy source. It is likely that coal will remain a primary<br>
energy source in the foreseeable future given the long term environmental concerns with the<br>
storage of waste from nuclear energy generation operations, and the inefficiencies associated<br>
with solar powered electrical generation.   In addition vast worldwide coal reserves exist<br>
sufficient for at least 200 years of energy production at current rates.<br>
However, there is and will continue to be a high demand to reduce the emissions of<br>
pollutants associated with coal fired electrical energy generation, and to increase the overall<br>
efficiency of the coal fired generation process.   Traditionally, in power plants and other<br>
industrial combustion settings the efficiency of the combustion process and the level of<br>
pollution emission have been determined indirectly through measurements taken on extracted<br>
gas samples with techniques such as non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) photometry. Extractive<br>
sampling systems are not particularly well suited to closed loop control of a combustion<br>
process since a significant delay can be introduced between the time of gas extraction and the<br>
ultimate analysis. In addition, extractive processes generally result in a single point<br>
measurement which may or may not be representative of the actual concentration of the<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
measured species within what can be a highly variable and dynamic combustion process<br>
chamber.<br>
Laser based optical species sensors have recently been implemented to address the<br>
concerns associated with extraction measurement techniques. Laser based measurement<br>
techniques can be implemented in situ and offer the further advantage of high speed feedback<br>
suitable for dynamic process control. A particularly promising technique for measuring<br>
combustion gas composition, temperature and other combustion parameters is tunable diode<br>
laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS). TDLAS is typically implemented with diode lasers<br>
operating in the near-infrared and mid-infrared spectral regions. Suitable lasers have been<br>
extensively developed for use in the telecommunications industry and are, therefore, readily<br>
available for TDLAS applications. Various techniques of TDLAS which are more or less<br>
suitable for the sensing and control of combustion processes have been developed.<br>
Commonly known techniques are wavelength modulation spectroscopy, frequency<br>
modulation spectroscopy and direct absorption spectroscopy. Each of these techniques is<br>
based upon a predetermined relationship between the quantity and nature of laser light<br>
received by a detector after the light has been transmitted through a combustion process<br>
chamber and absorbed in specific spectral bands which are characteristic of the gases present<br>
in the process or combustion chamber. The absorption spectrum received by the detector is<br>
used to determine the quantity of the gas species under analysis plus associated combustion<br>
parameters such as temperature.<br>
For example, Von Drasek, et al., United States Patent Application Serial Number<br>
2002/0031737A1, teaches a method and apparatus of using tunable diode lasers for the<br>
monitoring and/or control of high temperature processes. Von Drasek features the use of<br>
direct absorption spectroscopy to determine the relative concentration of numerous<br>
combustion species, temperature and other parameters. Calabro, United States Patent<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
Number 5,813,767, teaches a similar system for monitoring combustion and pollutants<br>
developed in a combustion chamber. Calabro utilizes an indirect spectroscopy technique<br>
wherein observed Doppler broadening of the shape of an absorption feature serves as the<br>
basis for temperature analysis.<br>
Teichert, Fernholz, and Ebert have extended the use of TDLAS as a known laboratory<br>
analysis technique to a workable field solution suitable for the sensing of certain combustion<br>
parameters within the boiler fireball of a Ml sized coal fired power plant. In their article,<br>
"Simultaneous in situ Measurement of CO, H2O, and Gas Temperature in a Full-Sized, Coal-<br>
Fired Power Plant by Near-Infrared Diode Lasers," {Applied Optics, 42(12):2043, 20 April<br>
2003) the authors present a successful implementation of direct absorption spectroscopy at a<br>
coal fired power plant and discuss certain technical challenges resulting from the extremely<br>
large scale and violent nature of the coal burning process. In particular, typical coal fired<br>
power plants have combustion chamber diameters of 10-20 meters. The plants are fired by<br>
pulverized coal, which results in a combustion process which both obscures the transmission<br>
of laser light because of the high dust load and which is extremely luminous, hi addition,<br>
various strong disturbances are found under power plant combustion conditions. The overall<br>
transmission rate of light through the process chamber will fluctuate dramatically over time<br>
as a result of broadband absorption, scattering by particles or beam steering owing to<br>
refractive-index fluctuations. There is also intense thermal background radiation from the<br>
burning coal particles which can interfere with detector signals. The environment outside of<br>
the power plant boiler also makes the implementation of a TDLAS sensing or control system<br>
problematic. For example, any electronics, optics or other sensitive spectroscopy<br>
components must be positioned away from intense heat, or adequately shielded and cooled.<br>
Even though the implementation of a TDLAS system is extremely difficult under these<br>
conditions, TDLAS is particularly well suited to monitor and control a coal combustion<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/IIS2004/010048<br>
process. The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the TDLAS<br>
implementation problems discussed above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the invention is a sensing apparatus consisting of more than one diode<br>
laser having select lasing frequencies, a multiplexer optically coupled to the outputs of the<br>
diode lasers with the multiplexer being further optically coupled to a pitch side optical fiber.<br>
Multiplexed laser light is transmitted through the pitch side optical fiber to a pitch optic<br>
operatively associated with a process chamber which may be a combustion chamber or the<br>
boiler of a coal or gas fired power plant. The pitch optic is oriented to project multiplexed<br>
laser output through the process chamber. Also operatively oriented with the process<br>
chamber is a catch optic in optical communication with the pitch optic to receive the<br>
multiplexed laser output projected through the process chamber. As used herein, "coupled",<br>
"optically coupled" or "in optical communication with" is defined as a functional relationship<br>
between counterparts where light can pass from a first component to a second component<br>
either through or not through intermediate components or free space. The catch optic is<br>
optically coupled to an optical fiber which transmits the multiplexed laser output to a<br>
demultiplexer. The demultiplexer demultiplexes the laser light and optically couples the<br>
select lasing frequencies of light to a detector with the detector being sensitive to one of the<br>
select lasing frequencies. Optionally, the sensing apparatus may have each diode laser<br>
optically coupled to a distinct corresponding input optical fiber prior to the multiplexer and<br>
the detector optically coupled to an output fiber of the demultiplexer. The pitch side optical<br>
fiber may be a single mode fiber, and the catch side optical fiber may be a multimode fiber.<br>
Optionally, the sensing apparatus may further consist of a pitch side optical routing device<br>
optically coupled to the pitch side optical fiber and routing the multiplexed laser output to<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
more than one pair of pitch and catch optics operatively associated with the process chamber.<br>
The optical routing device may be an optical switch, an optical splitter, or other commonly<br>
available off the shelf telecommunications optical routing apparatus. Optionally, the sensing<br>
apparatus may further consist of a data processing system receiving input from the detector<br>
and employing commonly known laser spectroscopy techniques to determine a combustion<br>
parameter from the detector data. The sensing apparatus may also have means for affecting<br>
the combustion parameter based upon the output of the data processing system. For example,<br>
the sensing apparatus may provide for closed loop control of a combustion input such as air<br>
flow, fuel flow or catalyst or chemical agent addition which control is responsive to the data<br>
processing system in accordance with the combustion parameter determined by the data<br>
processing system.<br>
The sensing apparatus may utilize an echelle grating in the multiplexer or<br>
demultiplexer. Additional components of the multiplexer or demultiplexer may include an<br>
optical wave guide and a collimating focusing optic. The reflective echelle grating coupled<br>
to the collimating/focusing optic will typically have a groove spacing and blaze angle<br>
providing for the simultaneous demultiplexing of a plurality of ranges of widely spaced<br>
wavelengths of light. An appropriate echelle grating will typically be capable of multiplexing<br>
or demultiplexing wavelengths equal to or greater than 670 nm through wavelengths equal to<br>
or less than 5200 nm. To accomplish this, the echelle grating will operate at orders of<br>
detraction from the second order to at least the fourteenth order. Such an echelle grating will<br>
typically have a groove spacing of approximately 171.4 lines per mm and a blaze angle of<br>
approximately 52.75 degrees.<br>
Optionally, the sensing apparatus may have the multiplexer optically coupled to fewer<br>
than all of the diode lasers and further consist of an optical coupler coupled to the output of<br>
the multiplexer and the separate output of any unmultiplexed diode laser. In such an optional<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
embodiment, the optical coupler will optically communicate with the pitch optic through a<br>
select length of transmitting optical fiber. The length of the transmitting optical fiber may be<br>
selected to minimize mode noise. For example, the transmitting optical fiber may be<br>
implemented at a length of equal to or less than 3 meters, and be fabricated of Coming SMF<br>
28 optical fiber which will assure that wavelengths less than 1240 nm, in particular 760 nm,<br>
do not become multi-modal during transmission through the transmitting optical fiber.<br>
The sensing apparatus may also consist of means to mechanically manipulate a<br>
section of the catch side optical fiber to minimize catch side mode noise. One example of an<br>
appropriate means to mechanically manipulate a section of the catch side optical fiber<br>
consists of a motor having a shaft parallel to the longitudinal axis of the catch side optical<br>
fiber which is attached to the fiber and provides a twisting motion around the longitudinal<br>
axis. The twisting motion may consist of a sweep through plus 360 degrees and minus 360<br>
degrees at a rate of at least 10 Hz to effectively average the transmitted signal and thereby<br>
reduce catch side mode noise.<br>
Optionally, the sensing apparatus may further consist of a catch side alignment<br>
mechanism associated with the catch optic providing for the alignment of the catch optic with<br>
respect to the direction of the projection of the mutliplexed laser output. The alignment<br>
mechanism may increase the quantity of laser light received by the catch optic from the pitch<br>
optic and thereby coupled to the catch side optical fiber. The alignment mechanism may<br>
consist of an apparatus which allows the catch optic to tilt along a first axis and a second axis<br>
orthogonal to the first axis with both the first and second axes being substantially orthogonal<br>
to the direction of the projection of the multiplexed laser output. A stepper motor may be<br>
used to tilt the catch optic and a data processing system may be further associated with the<br>
catch side alignment mechanism and receive data from the detector related to the strength of<br>
the multiplexed laser output coupled to the detector and cause the catch side alignment<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
mechanism to align the catch optic. Alternatively, a separate alignment beam may be<br>
projected to the catch optic and used as a reference for alignment purposes. A similar<br>
alignment mechanism may be implemented on the pitch side of the sensing apparatus to<br>
provide for alignment of the pitch optic and adjustment of the direction of the projection of<br>
the multiplexed laser output.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a method of sensing a combustion process<br>
consisting of providing laser light at multiple select lasing frequencies, multiplexing the laser<br>
light, and transmitting the multiplexed laser light in a pitch side optical fiber to a process<br>
location. The process location may be a combustion chamber such as the boiler of a gas or<br>
coal fired power plant. After transmitting the multiplexed laser light to the process location,<br>
the method further consists of projecting the multiplexed laser light through a combustion<br>
process, receiving the multiplexed laser light in a catch side optical fiber, demultiplexing the<br>
multiplexed laser light and transmitting a frequency of the demultiplexed laser light to a<br>
detector. Optionally, the method may further consist of determining a combustion parameter<br>
from an output of the detector and controlling the combustion process in accordance with the<br>
determined combustion parameter.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is an echelle grating based diode laser spectroscopy<br>
gas sensing apparatus consisting of more than one diode laser having select lasing<br>
frequencies optically coupled to an input echelle grating having select line spacing and a<br>
select blaze angle providing for the multiplexing of laser light at the select lasing frequencies.<br>
The apparatus further consists of an optical fiber optically coupled to the output of the echelle<br>
grating and receiving multiplexed laser light from the echelle grating. In addition, a pitch<br>
optic is optically coupled to the distal end of the optical fiber with the pitch optic being<br>
operatively associated with a process chamber which can be a combustion chamber and with<br>
the pitch optic being further oriented to project laser light through the process chamber. The<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
apparatus further consists of an output echelle grating in optical communication with the<br>
pitch optic with the output echelle grating having a select groove spacing and a select blaze<br>
angle to provide for the demultiplexing of laser light at the select lasing frequencies. In<br>
addition, more than one detector sensitive at one of the select lasing frequencies is optically<br>
coupled to the output echelle grating. The apparatus of this aspect of the invention may<br>
further consist of a catch optic in optical communication with the pitch optic and in optical<br>
communication with the output echelle grating. Furthermore, one or more collimating optics<br>
may be optically coupled between the output of the echelle grating and a corresponding<br>
detector. The echelle grating of the diode laser spectroscopy gas sensing apparatus may have<br>
a groove spacing and blaze angle allowing the simultaneous (demultiplexing of a plurality of<br>
ranges of widely spaced wavelengths. An appropriate echelle grating can (de)multiplex<br>
optical channels having wavelengths equal to or greater than 670 nm through wavelengths<br>
equal to or less than 5200 nm. Such an echelle grating would operate from the second to the<br>
fourteenth order of refraction, and may have groove spacing of approximately 171.4 lines per<br>
mm and a blaze angle of approximately 52.75 degrees.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a method of sensing a combustion process<br>
consisting of providing laser light at multiple select lasing frequencies, multiplexing the laser<br>
light with an echelle grating, projecting the multiplexed laser light through a combustion<br>
process, demultiplexing the multiplexed laser light with an echelle grating and transmitting a<br>
frequency of demultiplexed laser light to a detector. This method may further consist of<br>
determining a combustion parameter from an output of the detector and controlling the<br>
combustion process in accordance with the determined combustion parameter.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a pitch side optical system for use in diode<br>
laser spectroscopy consisting of more than one diode laser having select lasing frequencies<br>
with each diode laser being coupled to an end of a distinct input optical fiber. The pitch side<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
optical system further consists of a multiplexer optically coupled to the other end of less than<br>
all of the input optical fibers with the multiplexer outputting multiplexed laser light to a pitch<br>
side optical fiber. Typically, the diode lasers and multiplexer will be housed in a climate<br>
controlled room situated remotely from the combustion process chamber. The pitch side<br>
optical system further consists of a coupler optically coupled to the far end of the pitch side<br>
optical fiber and the far end of an unmultiplexed input optical fiber with the coupler<br>
combining the multiplexed laser light and the unmultiplexed laser light and outputting the<br>
combined light to a transmission optical fiber. Typically, the coupler is located near the<br>
combustion process. The pitch side optical system further consists of a pitch optic coupled to<br>
the transmission optical fiber. Typically, all optical fibers used in the pitch side optical<br>
system are single mode optical fibers. The length of the transmitting optical fiber may be<br>
selected to minimize optical noise. In particular, if laser light of relatively shorter<br>
wavelengths, for example 760 nm, had been multiplexed with laser light of relatively longer<br>
wavelengths, for example 1240 nm - 5200 nm, and such a multiplexed beam had been<br>
transmitted in a suitable commercially available telecommunications optical fiber which did<br>
not exhibit a high rate of bending and other transmission losses over the entire transmitted<br>
spectrum, the relatively shorter wavelengths may have become multimodal over an extended<br>
distance. Thus, the transmission fiber length may be selected to minimize the creation of<br>
mode noise. For example, a transmission fiber length of 3 meters or less, with the<br>
transmission fiber being Coming SMF 28 optical fiber, can transmit laser light with a<br>
wavelength of 760 nm from the coupler to the pitch optic without the introduction of<br>
significant multi-modal behavior.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a catch side optical system for use in diode<br>
laser spectroscopy consisting of a catch side optic optically coupled to a catch side multimode<br>
optical fiber and means to mechanically manipulate a section of the catch side multimode<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
optical fiber to minimize catch side mode noise. The mechanical manipulation may consist<br>
of twisting the catch side multimode optical fiber around its longitudinal axis. The means to<br>
mechanically manipulate the section of the catch side multimode optical fiber in the above<br>
fashion may consist of a motor associated with the catch side multimode optical fiber such<br>
that a section of fiber is held fast relative to a shaft position of the motor and the motor shaft<br>
is repetitively swept through +360 degrees and -360 degrees of motion. The frequency of the<br>
motor shaft sweep may be at least 10 Hz to enable effective averaging of the transmitted<br>
signal and thereby reduce the effect of catch side mode noise.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a diode laser spectroscopy gas sensing<br>
apparatus having a diode laser with a select lasing frequency, a pitch optic coupled to the<br>
diode laser with the pitch optic being operatively associated with a process chamber and<br>
oriented to project laser light along a projection beam through the process chamber. This<br>
aspect of the invention additionally includes a catch optic in optical communication with the<br>
pitch optic to receive the laser light projected through the process chamber and an optical<br>
fiber optically coupled to the catch optic. Li addition, the catch optic is operatively<br>
associated with a catch side alignment mechanism which provides for Hie alignment of the<br>
catch optic with respect to the projection beam to increase a quantity of laser light received<br>
by the catch optic from the pitch optic and coupled to the optical fiber and a detector sensitive<br>
to the select lasing frequency optically coupled to the optical fiber. The catch side alignment<br>
mechanism may consist of means to tilt the catch optic along a first axis and a second axis<br>
orthogonal to the first axis with both the first and second axes being approximately<br>
orthogonal to the projection beam. The means to tilt the catch optic may be a stepper motor.<br>
The diode laser spectroscopy gas sensing apparatus may also consist of an alignment beam of<br>
light projected by the pitch optic and received by the catch optic and a data processing system<br>
operatively associated with the detector and catch side alignment mechanism receiving data<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
from the detector related to the strength of the alignment beam and further causing the catch<br>
side alignment mechanism to align the catch side optic with the projection beam to maximize<br>
the strength of the alignment beam coupled to the detector. The diode laser spectroscopy gas<br>
sensing apparatus of this aspect of the invention may further consist of a pitch side alignment<br>
mechanism providing for alignment of the pitch optic and adjustment of the direction of the<br>
projection beam. The pitch optic may be implemented substantially as described above for<br>
the catch optic.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a method of aligning a diode laser<br>
spectroscopy gas sensing optical system. The method consists of providing an alignment<br>
beam of light, projecting the alignment beam through a process chamber, receiving the<br>
alignment beam with a catch optic, the catch optic being operatively associated with the<br>
process chamber. The method further consists of optically coupling the alignment beam from<br>
the catch optic to a detector through an optical fiber and determining the strength of the<br>
alignment beam coupled from the catch optic to the optical fiber. In addition, the method<br>
consists of aligning the catch optic to maximize the strength of the alignment beam coupled<br>
from the catch optic to the optical fiber. The method of aligning a diode laser spectroscopy<br>
gas sensing optical system may further consist of tilting the catch optic along a first axis and<br>
a second axis orthogonal to the first axis. Alternatively, the alignment beam may be<br>
projected by a pitch optic and the pitch optic may be aligned as well to further maximize the<br>
strength of the alignment beam coupled from the catch optic to the optical fiber.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a method of sensing NO in a combustion<br>
process with tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. The NO sensing method consists<br>
of providing laser light at a wavelength of approximately 670 nm, transmitting the laser light<br>
in a pitch side optical fiber to a combustion location, projecting the laser light through a<br>
combustion process and receiving the laser light in a catch side optical fiber. The method<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
farther consists of transmitting the laser light in the catch side optical fiber to a detector and<br>
generating a signal from the detector related to the laser light transmitted to the detector. In<br>
addition, the method consists of calculating a NO2 concentration from the signal and<br>
determining a NO concentration from the calculated NO2 concentration. The NO sensing<br>
method may be implemented with the provision of laser light at a wavelength of 670 run by<br>
producing laser light with a wavelength of approximately 1340 nm with a diode laser and<br>
frequency-doubling the laser light in a quasi-phase matched periodically polled waveguide.<br>
A suitable waveguide is a quasi-phase matched periodically polled lithium Niobate<br>
waveguide.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
SENSING APPARATUS<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 an embodiment of the present invention is a sensing apparatus 10<br>
suitable for the sensing, monitoring and control of a combustion process. The sensing<br>
apparatus 10 performs tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) using laser light<br>
from a series of tunable diode lasers 12 lasing at select frequencies in the near-infrared or<br>
mid-infrared spectrum. The output of each tunable diode laser 12 is coupled to an individual<br>
optical fiber which may be a single mode optical fiber 14 and routed to a multiplexer 16. As<br>
used herein, "coupled", "optically coupled" or "in optical communication with" is defined as<br>
a functional relationship between counterparts where light can pass from a first component to<br>
a second component either through or not through intermediate components or free space.<br>
Within the multiplexer 16 the laser light of some or all of the frequencies generated is<br>
multiplexed to form a multiplexed probe beam having multiple select frequencies. The<br>
multiplexed probe beam is coupled to a pitch side optical fiber 18 and transmitted to a pitch<br>
optic 20 or collimator operatively associated with a process chamber which, in Figure 1, is<br>
shown as a combustion chamber 22.<br>
The pitch optic 20 is oriented to project the multiplexed probe beam through the<br>
combustion chamber 22. Across the combustion chamber 22 in optical communication with<br>
the pitch optic 20 is a catch optic 24. The catch optic 24 is preferably substantially opposite<br>
the pitch optic 20 and is operatively associated with the combustion chamber 22. The catch<br>
optic 24 is positioned and oriented to receive the multiplexed probe beam projected through<br>
the combustion chamber 22. The catch optic 24 is optically coupled to a catch side optical<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
fiber 26 which transmits the portion of the multiplexed probe beam which is received by the<br>
catch optic 24 to a demultiplexer 28. Within the demultiplexer 28 the portion of the<br>
multiplexed probe beam received by the catch optic 24 is demultiplexed and each wavelength<br>
of demultiplexed laser light is coupled to an output optical fiber 30. Each output optical fiber<br>
30 in turn is optically coupled to a detector 32, which typically is a photodetector sensitive to<br>
one of the select frequencies of laser light generated and multiplexed to form the probe beam.<br>
The detectors 32 generate an electrical signal based upon the nature and quantity of light<br>
transmitted to the detector 32 at the detector frequency. The electrical signal from each<br>
detector 32 is typically digitized and analyzed in data processing system 34. As discussed in<br>
detail below, the digitized and analyzed data can be used to sense physical parameters within<br>
the process chamber including but not limited to the concentrations of various gas species and<br>
the combustion temperature within the combustion chamber 22. The data processing system<br>
34 can further be used to send signals through a feedback loop 36 to combustion control<br>
apparatus 38 and thereby actively control select process parameters. In the case of a<br>
combustion process, the process parameters controlled can include fuel (e.g., pulverized coal)<br>
feed rates; oxygen feed rates and catalyst or chemical agent addition rates. The use of fiber<br>
optic coupling of the electronic and optical components on both the pitch and catch sides of<br>
the sensing apparatus 10 allows delicate and temperature sensitive apparatus such as the<br>
tunable diode lasers 12, detectors 32 and data processing system 34 to be located in a control<br>
room having a stable operating environment. Thus, only the relatively robust pitch and catch<br>
optics 20, 24 need be situated near the hostile environment of the combustion chamber 22.<br>
Figure 2 schematically depicts the overall component placement of a fiber coupled,<br>
multiplexed sensing system 40. The sensing system 40 generally consists of a system rack<br>
42, a breakout box 44, a transmitter head 46 having pitch optics 48, a receiver head having<br>
catch optics 52 and connecting optical fibers.  The system rack 42 is preferably located in a<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
remote control room situated a distance, for example one kilometer, from the combustion<br>
chamber 54. The control room typically will have a moderate environment. The system rack<br>
42 contains the lasers 56, detectors 58, wavelength multiplexers 60 and wavelength<br>
demultiplexers 62. The system rack 42 also houses the system electronics and control<br>
software (not shown on Fig. 2). The system rack 42 may optionally house an alignment light<br>
source 64.<br>
The optical fibers connecting the system rack 42 with the breakout box 44 are<br>
typically standard single-mode telecom optical fiber. This type of fiber is inexpensive, readily<br>
available, low-loss and allows the laser light to be directed to various off-the-shelf telecom<br>
components to manipulate the light, such as optical switches, splitters, and wavelength<br>
division multiplexers. Without optical fiber coupling, the laser light would have to be<br>
directed through free space all the way to the combustion chamber 54, which would be very<br>
difficult to implement or, alternatively, sensitive electronic and optical components would<br>
have to be situated in close proximity to the combustion chamber 54.<br>
Also shown on Fig. 2 is a breakout box 44. The breakout box 44 is a ruggedized<br>
enclosure located close to the boiler. The breakout box 44 contains optical switches, splitters<br>
and couplers (collectively 66) which may be used as discussed below to direct the optical<br>
signals to multiple transmitter-receiver head pairs.<br>
A third group of system components as shown on Fig 2 are the transmitter and<br>
receiver heads 46, 50. The optics and electronics in the transmitter and receiver heads 46, 50<br>
must convert the light in the fiber 68 into a collimated beam, direct the beam accurately<br>
through the combustion chamber 54, capture the beam on the far side of the combustion<br>
chamber 54 and couple the beam into the fiber 70. The choice of optics to accomplish this is<br>
determined by the transmission distance, the turbulence of the combustion zone, its effect on<br>
the transmitted beam's quality, and the core size of the fiber 70. Preferably, the fiber core<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
diameter is 50 microns, which is a compromise: a larger core will capture more of the laser<br>
light but also much more of the background light. Fiber coupling on the catch (receiver) side<br>
has several advantages. In particular, only light in the same location as the laser light and<br>
traveling in the same direction is focused into the fiber 70. This drastically reduces the<br>
amount of background light that is sensed. In an alternative embodiment, light may be<br>
captured into one of several receiver fibers and an optical switch or other optical routing<br>
device can select light from one fiber for routing to the detectors 58.<br>
The use of fiber coupling at the catch side requires that the alignment tolerances of<br>
both the transmitter and receiver optics be precisely maintained (less than 0.5 milliradian for<br>
both the transmitter and receiver pointing). The alignment system discussed below makes it<br>
feasible to meet these tolerances in a harsh power plant environment.   Preferably, both the<br>
pitch and catch optics 48, 52 are custom-designed and aberration-corrected for wavelengths<br>
from 660 nm to 1650 nm so that multiple laser signals can be efficiently transmitted and<br>
received at the same time.<br>
SENSING APPARATUS WITH MULTIPLE SETS OF SENSING OPTICS<br>
Referring again to Fig 1, an embodiment is depicted schematically which features<br>
more than one set of pitch optics 20 and catch optics 24 associated with a single combustion<br>
chamber 22. The multiplexed probe beam can be routed by a routing device which, as is<br>
shown in Fig. 1, may be an optical switch 72 to each set of pitch optics 20. Suitable routing<br>
devices include optical switches which may be implemented to route the probe beam with<br>
minimal attenuation to each set of pitch/catch optics in a predetermined sequence or an<br>
optical splitter which simultaneously routes a fractional portion of the multiplexed probe<br>
beam to each set of optics.<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
A similar optical routing device which, in Figure 1, is shown as a multimode optical<br>
switch 74 can be employed on the catch side of the system to route the portion of the<br>
multiplexed probe beam received by each catch optic 24 to the catch side demultiplexer 28.<br>
Although the embodiment depicted in Figure 1 shows only two sets of pitch and catch optics,<br>
the system can employ any number of pitch and catch optical sets. The use of fiber coupling<br>
and a (de)multiplexed probe beam on both the pitch and catch sides of the system allows<br>
multiple sets of pitch and catch optics to be implemented with one set of lasers 12 and<br>
detectors 32. Without the incorporation of optical multiplexing techniques, separate sets of<br>
lasers, detectors and fiber cables, all requiring calibration, would be needed for each<br>
transmitter/receiver pair.  As discussed in detail below, multiple transmitter/receiver pairs<br>
allow the implementation of one or more two dimensional sensing grids over the entire<br>
combustion chamber 22 or elsewhere, such as for sensing a downstream gas process. A<br>
schematic illustration of two highly simplified sensing grids, a fireball sensing grid 76 and a<br>
downstream sensing grid 78 are shown in Fig. 3.   In addition, the fiber-coupled nature of the<br>
present invention allows readily available telecommunications components to be used to<br>
positive effect. For instance, a fiber-optics switch can be used to route the multiplexed probe<br>
beam to different locations for measurement. 1 X N optical switches with N up to 8 are<br>
readily available as off-the-shelf components from a variety of suppliers. Switches with N up<br>
to 16 can be custom ordered.<br>
A switch and multiple pairs of pitch and catch optics can be used for serial probing of<br>
a gas species at different locations throughout the combustion chamber. For situations in<br>
which averaged results are sufficient, serial probing of different beam paths is acceptable.<br>
However, certain applications require instantaneous probing of an entire sensing grid. For<br>
example, certain combustion process flows exhibits high-frequency fluctuations, or the flow<br>
may only exist for a short period of time, e.g. shock tubes or tunnels. In such a case a 1 X N<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/0J0048<br>
splitter may be used to divide the probe beam into N branches each of which occupies a<br>
different position on the grid. Since the entire grid is illuminated simultaneously, a two<br>
dimensional analysis can be generated very quickly. However, simultaneous two<br>
dimensional analysis may require that each component on the catch side be reproduced for<br>
each beam path including demultiplexers, detectors, electronics such as A/D cards and, to<br>
some extent, computers.<br>
Thus, embodiments featuring switches or splitters facilitate somewhat coarse<br>
tomographic reconstruction of two-dimensional cross sections of the probed region. Using<br>
diode lasers to do tomography of gas concentrations is a known technique, however<br>
significant additional benefit is achieved under the present invention as a result of the use of<br>
a probe beam which is wavelength multiplexed.  The wavelength multiplexed beam allows<br>
for the simultaneous spectroscopic analysis of more than one absorption line. Thus TDLAS<br>
techniques which rely on more than one line, such as temperature determination, as discussed<br>
in detail below, can be performed across the entire sensing grid. Both temperature and gas<br>
species concentrations can be mapped in this way.<br>
SPECIFIC APPLICATION OF TOMOGRAPHY IN SCR AND SNCR<br>
A specific application of coarse tomography as described above is schematically<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3 and concerns the optimization of ammonia injection in SCRs (selective<br>
catalytic reduction) and SNCRs (selective non-catalytic reduction) for the reduction of NOX<br>
from coal or gas fired power generation boiler effluent, m this application, a matrix of<br>
ammonia or urea injectors 80 are placed in the flow of boiler effluent. In order to minimize<br>
the NOX concentration, an excess of ammonia (or urea) may be added to the effluent.   NOX is<br>
a heavily regulated and highly undesirable family of air pollutants. The added ammonia<br>
chemically reduces the NOX and forms harmless nitrogen gas and water as products.<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
However, the amount of excess ammonia (or urea) added must be minimized because these<br>
chemicals themselves are toxic air pollutants and quite expensive. Typically an excess<br>
concentration of 
power plant combustion effluent is not uniform, nor is it temporally stable. In addition, one<br>
or more of the ammonia injectors may foul at any given time causing a local decrease in the<br>
ammonia concentration leading to a local bleed through in the NOX concentration. With the<br>
ability to monitor the spatial concentration of ammonia or NOX with a downstream TDLAS<br>
grid 78 sensing as described above, the present invention allows non-uniform ammonia<br>
distributions to be detected and mitigated. Thus, optimization of the ammonia injection grid<br>
76 with two-dimensional species concentrations and individual control over injectors allows<br>
the optimization of the SCR/SNCR process. The detectors and ammonia injectors may be<br>
linked to a data processing system providing automated feedback control of the ammonia<br>
injectors.<br>
An optimized ammonia slip detection system, such as the one described herein,<br>
should preferably include the ability to monitor NOX concentration. NOX includes both NO<br>
and NO2. Unfortunately, robust NIR diode lasers can only access the second NO overtone<br>
transition occurring in the 1.7-1.8-micron region. This transition is too weak to detect NO<br>
given the relatively low concentrations present in most effluent flows. Therefore it is not<br>
practical to directly monitor NO concentration. However, NO2 is formed by the same<br>
processes that form NO. These processes, known in the power generation industries as the<br>
thermal NOX process produce both NO and NO2 with NO accounting for approximately 95%<br>
of the total NOX concentration and NO2 accounting for the remaining 5 % under typical<br>
conditions. The exact ratio typically depends upon temperature and the oxidizing potential of<br>
the environment. As discussed above, this technique allows for determination of the<br>
temperature of the sampled gas as well. However, it is expected that the NO and NO2<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
concentrations will track each other. Thus NO2 can be used as a surrogate analysis species<br>
for NO. The present invention provides the ability to monitor NO2 at a wavelength of 670<br>
run. This wavelength is produced using a 1340 nni distributed-feedback (DFB) laser<br>
frequency-doubled in a phase-matched periodically poled lithium Niobate waveguide. Even<br>
though the NO2 concentration is only 5% the NO concentration, the NO2 absorption strength<br>
is orders of magnitude stronger. Thus, NO2 can be detected readily at the concentrations<br>
present in boilers to facilitate optimization of NOX reduction processes.<br>
TUNABLE DIODE LASER ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY<br>
The present invention performs TDLAS using techniques known to those skilled in<br>
the art of laser spectroscopy. Generally, TDLAS is performed by the transmission of laser<br>
light through a target environment, followed by the detection of the absorption of the laser<br>
light at specific wavelengths, due to target gases such as carbon monoxide or oxygen.<br>
Spectral analysis of the detected light allows identification of the type and quantity of gas<br>
along the laser path. The details of direct absorption spectroscopy are discussed in Teichert,<br>
Fernholz, and Ebert, "Simultaneous in situ Measurement of CO, H2O, and Gas Temperature<br>
in a Full-Sized, Coal-Fired Power Plant by Near-Infrared Diode Lasers," {Applied Optics,<br>
42(12):2043, 20 April 2003), which reference is incorporated herein in its entirety. The non-<br>
contact nature of laser absorption spectroscopy makes it well-suited for harsh environments<br>
such as the combustion zone of a coal-fired power plant, or flammable or toxic environments<br>
where other probes cannot be used. The use of laser light provides the high brightness<br>
necessary to get detectible transmission in the presence of severe attenuation (typically<br>
greater than 99.9% loss of light) that may be seen in some of these environments. To better<br>
withstand the harsh conditions of the target applications, the laser light may be brought in to<br>
the target environment through armored optical fiber.<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
Effective sensing of temperature or multiple combustion process component gasses<br>
requires the performance of TDLAS with multiple widely spaced frequencies of laser light.<br>
The frequencies selected must match the absorption lines of the transitions being monitored.<br>
For example, as discussed above it is useful to monitor NO2 at a wavelength of 670 run to<br>
approximate emission NO concentrations. It is also quite useful to monitor oxygen, water<br>
(temperature), and carbon monoxide in a coal-fired utility boiler. Suitable absorption lines,<br>
and thus suitable lasing frequencies can be selected based upon an assumption that the laser<br>
probe path length through a combustion chamber is equal to 10 meters and that the mole<br>
fraction of each species is CO (1%), O2 (4%), CO2 (10%), and H2O (10%). For frequency<br>
selection purposes, the process temperature can be assumed to be 1800 K which is slightly<br>
higher than what is typically observed in a coal fired plant, but the cushion serves as a safety<br>
factor in the calculations.<br>
For example, three water absorption lines can be selected for TDLAS that meet the<br>
following criteria:<br>
1.	Lower state energy of ~ 1000, 2000, and 3000 cm"1 respectively<br>
2.	Provides a convenient absorbance of around 0.1 - 0.4 that, in turn, leads to<br>
approximately 20% beam absorption on resonance.<br>
3.	The optimum situation is to utilize transitions in the 1250 to 1650 nm region where<br>
inexpensive, high power, DFB diode telecommunications lasers are available.<br>
4.	The transitions must be well separated to allow for easy multiplexing.<br>
5.	The selected wavelength must be efficiently diffracted by the existing (de)multiplexer<br>
gratings.<br>
Suitable water lines occur at the following wavelengths:<br>

No interference from any other combustion gases is anticipated. The most likely<br>
species to interfere, CO2 was modeled and there are no strong, interfering lines in the 1.3-<br>
1.4 micron region.<br>
Similarly, a suitable carbon monoxide line can be selected based on the work of Ebert<br>
referenced and incorporated above. A suitable carbon monoxide line is found at 1559.562<br>
nm using the R(24) line in a coal-fired utility boiler. Selection of this line avoids interference<br>
from water and carbon dioxide. Known gratings are quite efficient in this wavelength region<br>
since it is in the optical communications C band. The absorbance at this wavelength is<br>
expected to be 0.7%.<br>
In addition, oxygen can be measured at 760.0932 nm. The preferred (de)multiplexing<br>
grating efficiency calculates to be only 40% in this region, however suitable laser power<br>
should be available for reasonable measurement efficiency.<br>
As discussed herein, the use of fiber coupling on both the pitch and catch sides of a<br>
TDLAS sensing apparatus requires critical alignment of the pitch and catch optics. Active<br>
alignment is preferably accomplished with a select alignment wavelength. One possible<br>
alignment wavelength is 660 nm because high power (45 mW) diodes are available at this<br>
frequency and 660 nm would be near the peak of 14th order grating operation. Other<br>
alignment wavelengths may be determined to be equally or more suitable.<br>

noted that this wavelength set is for one embodiment of a TDLAS sensing apparatus suitable<br>
for the sensing and control of a coal fired power plant. Other wavelength sets can be equally<br>

SPECIFIC BENEFITS OF TDLAS USING MULTIPLEXED BEAM<br>
A particular advantage of TDLAS with a wavelength-multiplexed probe beam is<br>
increased accuracy of temperature measurements.   In order to make accurate concentration<br>
measurements with TDLAS, the temperature of the monitored gas must be known. The<br>
strength of a molecular absorption is a function of temperature. Thus, to convert the<br>
amplitude of an absorption feature to concentration, the temperature must be known.   Certain<br>
previous attempts to measure the concentration of combustion species such as CO suffer from<br>
insufficiently accurate temperature measurements leading to errors in quantification. This is<br>
particularly true for diode laser based ammonia slip monitors that have traditionally not<br>
incorporated temperature measurement at all. hi the sensing system of the present invention,<br>
temperature may be determined by measuring the ratio of the intensity of two or more<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
molecular water lines. The ratio of the integrated intensity of two lines is a function of<br>
temperature only (assuming constant total system pressure). Thus, in principle, two lines<br>
provide an accurate temperature. However, in the case of a non-uniform temperature<br>
distribution (as is typically found within an industrial combustion process), two lines do not<br>
suffice to determine the temperature distribution. In such a non-uniform temperature<br>
distribution, two lines can only determine a "path-averaged" temperature. In contrast,<br>
measuring the integrated amplitude of more than two lines (of the same species) allows<br>
temperature non-uniformity to be probed. An example of this technique has been<br>
demonstrated using oxygen as the probe molecule by Sanders, Wang, Jeffries and Hanson in<br>
"Applied Optics" (vol. 40, num. 24, 20 August 2001), which reference is incorporated herein<br>
in its entirety. The preferred technique relies on the fact that the distribution of peak<br>
intensities measured along a line of sight is not the same for a path at an average temperature<br>
of 500 K, for example, as it is where one half of the path is at 300 K and the other half is at<br>
700 K.<br>
In addition to the benefit of more accurate temperature measurement, the use of a<br>
multiplexed probe beam can allow for the simultaneous monitoring of more than one<br>
combustion gas species, allowing for more refined control over the combustion process.<br>
ECHELLE GRATING BASED APPARATUS<br>
The present invention benefits from the use of relatively inexpensive and commonly<br>
available optical components designed for use in the telecommunications industry. The<br>
telecommunications apparatus serve well to fiber couple the pitch and catch sides of the<br>
system. Telecommunications applications typically use optical multiplexers which, accept<br>
multiple light beams at wavelengths which are relatively close spaced and separated by a<br>
constant value (such as 0.8 nm). The light beams are then generally coupled onto a single-<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
mode optical fiber. Demultiplexers perform the inverse process. Telecommunications<br>
equipment is typically designed to perform at wavelengths between 1520 and 1620 run, with<br>
the Optical C-band, 1528 - 1563 nm, being the most utilized.<br>
In the case of (de)multiplexerss the same physical device may be used for either<br>
multiplexing or demultiplexing, depending upon the direction of the light which passes<br>
through it. Consequently, the term "multiplexer" or "mux" as used herein will be understood<br>
to include both multiplexing and demultiplexing functions.<br>
Optical multiplexers may use any of several technologies to accomplish the<br>
mux/demux function. However, echelle grating-based muxes are advantageous in that they<br>
may be incorporated into a very simple and compact design. Echelle gratings are relatively<br>
course diffraction gratings that operate in orders other than the first order with blaze angles<br>
typically greater than 45 degrees. The course line spacing on the grating combined with high<br>
order operation results in a large angular dispersion that allows the device to be compact.<br>
Some telecommunications applications may require that other wavelengths well<br>
outside of the C band be simultaneously serviced by optical multiplexers (for instance 1310<br>
nm). Additionally, applications outside the telecommunications field such as the TDLAS<br>
sensing and control apparatus of the present invention may require the multiplexing of laser<br>
light at widely separated wavelengths, such as separations of approximately 100s of nm. An<br>
example illustrative of the benefits of an echelle grating based multiplexed sensing apparatus<br>
is developed in Figs. 4-7. Fig. 4 illustrates a gas sensing apparatus 82 in which light 84 is<br>
directed through a flame 86 from one side. A sensor 88 on the other side of the flame detects<br>
the transmitted light and determines how much light is absorbed by the gasses in the flame<br>
86. In the device illustrated in Fig. 4, only a single beam of light is passed through the flame<br>
86. The wavelength of the light may be chosen to correspond to the absorption wavelength<br>
of a particular gas. Alternatively, the light may be a white light which, after passing through<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
the flame 86, is spit into various wavelengths, such as by a prism. The absorption at each<br>
wavelength of interest can then be measured.<br>
In a slightly more sophisticated prior art alternative, a device such as that illustrated in<br>
Fig. 5 may be used to pass a number n of separate beams of light 90A - 90n through the flame<br>
92. Each beam of light 90A - 90n is at a different wavelength of interest and sensors 94A -<br>
94n on the other side of the flame 92 measure the absorption at each wavelength, indicating<br>
relative amounts of selected gases of interest. There are several drawbacks to using multiple<br>
separate beams. First, access to the flame may be limited and attempting to project the<br>
multiple beams through the limited space may be awkward, if not impossible. Second, there<br>
is typically turbulence in the flame as well as pockets of non-uniformity. The multiple<br>
beams, even if very closely spaced, may not pass through the same sampling space and<br>
therefore not generate consistent or comparable results. Finally, the projection and sensing<br>
optics and detectors are more complex and costly in a multiple-beam apparatus compared to<br>
those in a single-beam apparatus.<br>
The echelle grating multiplexer based sensing device of the present invention has<br>
significant advantages over the prior art. An echelle grating provides unusual flexibility by<br>
being able to operate in orders other than the first order with blaze angles typically greater<br>
than 45 degrees. For instance, the Zolo Technologies, Inc. Zmux™ is optimized to operate in<br>
a Littrow configuration in the 6th order at 1545 nm with a mechanically ruled grating having a<br>
line spacing of 171.4 lines/mm and a blaze angle of 52.75 degrees. The grating equation for a<br>
Littrow mount is:<br>
mX = 2dsinGb	(1)<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
where m is the order, X is the wavelength, d is the spacing between rulings, and 9b is the<br>
blaze angle.<br>
For a given grating, mX is a constant. For the Zmux grating referenced above, mX =<br>
6(1.545) = 9.27 microns. Such a grating provides optimum efficiency for 1.545 microns in<br>
6th order. However, the grating also provides very high efficiency for other orders as well.<br>
For instance, the 7th order occurs at 9.27/7 = 1.32 microns. Thus, a grating such as the Zmux<br>
can simultaneously multiplex C band light as well as 1310 nm light with high efficiency. Fig.<br>
6 illustrates an echelle grating 96 multiplexing light 98A - 98n to be collimated by a<br>
collimator 100 into a single beam 102.<br>
Of particular relevance to the present invention are applications outside of the<br>
telecommunications field for multiplexing laser light at widely separated wavelengths, often<br>
over 100s of nm.  In applications such as the present TDLAS based gas-sensing apparatus, it<br>
is critical for all wavelength components of a probe beam to sample the same region of space<br>
and many wavelengths may be necessary to detect a single species or to detect multiple<br>
species. For these applications, echelle grating-based mux/demuxes provide a unique<br>
solution. For example, the echelle based de/multiplexer described above is capable of<br>
muxing a substantial wavelength region about the central wavelengths given in Table 3 below<br>
where each wavelength region corresponds to a different grating order.<br>

Higher orders up to and beyond the fourteenth order may also be multiplexed with<br>
correspondingly narrower wavelength ranges. It is noteworthy that single mode transmission<br>
for all of these wavelengths is not possible in readily available optical fiber. One aspect of a<br>
gas-sensing apparatus 104 of the present invention is schematically illustrated in Fig. 7. This<br>
aspect highlights the advantages of TDLAS with a multiplexed laser output has over the prior<br>
art embodiments discussed above. In the Fig. 7 embodiment, a number n of laser sources<br>
106A - 106n operating at widely separated wavelengths are multiplexed by an echelle grating<br>
108 onto a single optical fiber 110. The light from the single fiber 110 is collimated by a<br>
collimator or pitch optic 112 and passed through the sample 114 (such as a flame) to be<br>
analyzed. After passing through the sample 114, the light is demultiplexed by another echelle<br>
grating 116. The transmitted light at each wavelength is detected by a corresponding<br>
photodetector 118A - 118n. The lasers 106A - 106n are tuned over a narrow spectral region<br>
(such as 1-2 urn) and absorption by the sample 114 is monitored over each spectral region<br>
scanned. In this way, the gas under test can be fully identified and quantified. Other<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
parameters such as gas temperature and pressure may be measured as well. In addition to<br>
combustion sensing, widely separated wavelength echelle grating mux/dermix technology<br>
may enable medical devices to measure gases in exhaled breath and homeland defense<br>
devices to detect chemical warfare agents. Other applications are possible in the fields of<br>
display and microscopic vision technology by using the echelle based muxes and<br>
red/green/blue coupler devices.<br>
MODE NOISE<br>
The optical train of the TDLAS system of the present invention, and similar<br>
implementations which require a signal multiplexed from widely spaced wavelengths<br>
presents many design challenges due to the opposing design requirements of the reduction of<br>
mode noise and high efficiency light collection. Mode noise is defined herein as a change in<br>
the signal level of detected light that results from non-uniform time and wavelength varying<br>
light distribution in the core of a fiber used to collect and transport the light to and from the<br>
process chamber being measured.<br>
In a multimode fiber, different modes propagate at different velocities due to<br>
refractive index variations. The intensity distribution in the fiber is then a speckle pattern<br>
resulting from interference of all the propagating modes that have undergone different<br>
effective path lengths. If all light in the speckle pattern is collected and detected, then<br>
constructive and destructive interference cancel exactly and the total transmitted power does<br>
not depend on wavelength or fiber length. If clipping, vignetting or other loss is introduced,<br>
the exact cancellation fails and the detected power changes with wavelength and/or time. A<br>
general expression for the detected power after a length, z, of fiber is:<br>
P = Po + Sjj Cjj EiEjCos[(27w0Anijz)/c + A
30<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
where Po = wavelength independent average power<br>
E; = amplitude of light in the ith transverse mode<br>
cy = overlap integral between the ith and jth transverse mode<br>
Ally = refractive index difference between ith and jth modes<br>
A(j)y = phase shift between ith and jth modes due to temperature and stress<br>
For an orthonormal set of modes and no loss, cy = 0. However, with any beam<br>
clipping or vignetting or any other mode dependent loss will cause some cy ?O.   This will<br>
lead to ripples in the average transmitted power.<br>
For a typical graded-index fiber with a 50 micron core, the total index change, An, is<br>
~1%, but most modes spend the bulk of transmission time close to the fiber core center, and<br>
therefore, Any 
approximately 135 modes, which is sufficiently coarse to produce prominent mode noise<br>
during a wavelength scan given reasonably achievable beam clipping levels.<br>
As a concrete modal noise example, one may consider the simplest possible system<br>
that exhibits mode noise: a rectangular waveguide supporting only the lowest mode in one<br>
dimension and only the two lowest modes in the orthogonal dimension:<br>
Lowest mode: Ei = Ei° [exp i(kz - ©t)]cos 7tx/2a<br>
Next mode:     E2 = E20 [exp i(kz - cot)]sin 7ix/a<br>
The intensity at a point z along the fiber is:<br>
I(x) = |Ei + E2|2 and the total power is P=   jEi + E2|2dx	(3)<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
where the integral must include the effects of clipping and vignetting.<br>
In the absence of clipping, P~ Ei2 + E22 and there is no wavelength dependence.<br>
Adding clipping amounts to changing the limits of the integral. It can be shown that clipping<br>
results in an additional term ~ EiEicosA(|&gt; where A<j akl="27iAnLM,.&lt;br/">
If single-mode fiber could be used in the catch side optical train of the present<br>
invention, mode noise would not be an issue. However, multimode fiber must typically be<br>
used in the catch side optical train of the present invention for two reasons. First, after<br>
traversing the measurement volume (a combustion chamber with a measurement path in<br>
excess of 10 meters), the initially single-mode (Gaussian spatial distribution) beam is<br>
significantly degraded in quality. Thus, the coupling efficiency of this severely distorted<br>
beam into single-mode fiber would be veiy poor. This is an unacceptable situation since the<br>
beam is attenuated by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude when passing through the measurement<br>
volume primarily due to scattering and obscuration by soot and fly ash. The additional<br>
attenuation resulting from using single-mode fiber would preclude measurement. Second,<br>
refractive beam steering effects in the fireball cause the position and pointing of the beam to<br>
be unstable. Given these effects, it would be difficult to "hit" the core of a single-mode fiber<br>
with any regularity.<br>
On the other hand, the core of a multimode fiber presents at least 25 times the target<br>
cross-sectional area of a single-mode fiber. Thus, the effects of beam steering can be<br>
significantly reduced. In addition, since the coupling efficiency into multimode fiber is<br>
independent of the spatial mode of the light, the poor beam quality obtained after passing<br>
through the fireball is not an issue.<br>
However, mode dependent losses occurring in the multi-mode fiber train are a<br>
significant design challenge. The light distribution emanating from the core of a multimode<br>
fiber exhibits a random speckle pattern, i.e. a random pattern of light and dark areas caused<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
by constructive and destructive interference between different modes of the fiber. If the<br>
speckle pattern was totally invariant as a function of time and wavelength, it would not<br>
present a problem. However, slow variations in the speckle pattern particularly as a function<br>
of wavelength can cause mode noise if the beam is clipped anywhere in the multirnode catch<br>
side optical train as described above. This clipping is impossible to avoid; it can only be<br>
reduced. Therefore, additional measures to reduce mode noise must be implemented to<br>
improve the detection sensitivity of the system.<br>
There are several ways in which to mitigate mode noise. From equation 2 above,<br>
mode noise may be reduced by:<br>
1)	reduce mode dependent losses, i.e. reduce clipping thereby keeping the cy small<br>
2)	reduce z, thereby increasing the period of the model noise to be much greater than the<br>
absorption lines of interest<br>
3)	reduce Any by using low dispersion fiber<br>
4)	scramble the modes; but not all mode scrambling techniques are equally effective, as<br>
is described below.<br>
Preferably, the catch optics of the present invention are designed and implemented to<br>
incorporate all of the above in order to reduce modal noise. The optics are designed such that<br>
any beam clipping should occur at a low level given near perfect alignment of the system.<br>
Efforts should be made to keep the length of multimode fiber to a minimum; however, for<br>
some applications z must be long in order to have the control electronics in an<br>
environmentally controlled area. The value of Any may be reduced by using premium low-<br>
dispersion multimode fiber. In addition, excellent results may be obtained by scrambling the<br>
modes by mechanical manipulation of a catch side multimode fiber.<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010(148<br>
The speckle pattern exhibited in a multimode fiber varies as a Sanction of lime and<br>
wavelength and also as a function of the mechanical position of the fiber. Flexing the fiber<br>
and manipulating it in specific ways can cause the speckle pattern to change. If these<br>
mechanical manipulations are performed continuously, over a period of time, the spatial<br>
distribution of light emanating from the fiber averages to a relatively uniform pattern. The<br>
crux of the scrambler of the present invention is to reduce mode noise by mechanically<br>
manipulating multi-mode fiber to produce, on average, a uniform light beam that does not<br>
produce mode noise when subjected to inevitable low-level beam clipping.<br>
Some specific modes of fiber manipulation are more effective at reducing mode noise<br>
than others. In particular, twisting the fiber about its longitudinal (z) axis relative to some<br>
other point on the fiber causes the speckle pattern to change. In particular, the dominant<br>
change obtained is a rotation of the speckle pattern around the z-axis. Of interest is the fact<br>
that the pattern does not rotate as far around the axis as the fiber is mechanically rotated. A<br>
secondary effect is that the actual light distribution is somewhat altered by the rotation. The<br>
rotation of the speckle pattern is not due to stress-induced refractive index changes in the<br>
fiber, although this may explain small changes in the speckle intensity pattern. Rather, the<br>
rotation is due to the light's inability to completely follow the waveguide as it is manipulated<br>
in a torsional motion.<br>
This observation can be used to virtually eliminate mode noise caused by the use of<br>
multimode fiber for the catch side optical train. A highly preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention uses a hollow shaft motor through which the multi-mode fiber is placed and<br>
fastened. A remote section of fiber is held fast relative to the shaft position of the motor, and<br>
the motor is repetitively swept through +360 degrees and then -360 degrees of motion. The<br>
frequency of this motion preferably is greater than or equal to 10 Hertz to enable effective<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
averaging of the transmitted signal, and significantly reduce the effect of catch sids mode<br>
noise.<br>
The pitch side optical train of the present invention also presents a significant design<br>
challenge due to the necessity of producing a single-mode beam for all wavelengths to be<br>
transmitted through the measurement region. If single-mode fiber could be used throughout<br>
the pitch side optical train, mode noise would not be an issue. However, fiber only operates<br>
as a single-mode waveguide over a limited wavelength window. Beyond the short<br>
wavelength cutoff for a particular fiber, light can be transported through the fiber in several<br>
higher order spatial modes. These higher order modes will interfere to produce a speckle<br>
pattern when the light exits the fiber. The speckle pattern is time and wavelength-varying.<br>
Even a small amount of beam clipping then gives rise to noise in the measurement.<br>
On the contrary, if a fiber is selected that has a single-mode cutoff that matches the<br>
shortest wavelength that needs to be transmitted, the longer wavelengths will suffer a<br>
substantial loss when coupled into the fiber and the fiber will exhibit extensive bending losses<br>
for the longer wavelengths.<br>
This problem can be acute in the fiber coupled, wavelength multiplexed TDLAS<br>
sensing and control device of the present invention due to the need to multiplex wavelengths<br>
as long as 1.67 microns with wavelengths as short as 760 nm or 670 nm. There is no known<br>
single commercially available fiber that will provide single mode operation, high coupling<br>
efficiency and low bending losses for such a broad range of wavelengths. Photonic crystal<br>
fiber may in the future provide a solution to this dilemma, but Photonic crystal fiber<br>
technology is currently in its infancy.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the current invention alleviates the problem of multiplexing and<br>
pitching light in a single mode beam from 670 nm or 760 nm to 1.67 microns by utilizing a<br>
very short transmission section of multimode fiber 120 that does not allow the higher order<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
spatial modes for a wavelength shorter than the single mode cutoff to develop. Referring to<br>
equation 2 above, if the length, L, of multi-mode fiber is short, then mode noise will be<br>
minimized. In this case, for example, if 760 run light is coupled to a short section of single<br>
mode fiber with a cutoff wavelength of 1280 nm (e.g. Corning SMF 28), the 760 nm light<br>
remains single-mode for at least a few meters. Therefore a solution to pitch side mode noise<br>
is to couple the 760 nm light into a fiber which is single mode for wavelengths longer than<br>
1280 nm but could be multimode for 760 nm, with only a short distance to go before it is<br>
collimated to be transmitted through the measurement zone.<br>
A schematic diagram of such a system is shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 2. Refemng first to<br>
Fig. 8, multiple diode laser sources 120 lasing at widely spaced lasing frequencies are<br>
coupled to discrete single mode optical fibers 122 A - 122n. The diode lasers lasing at<br>
wavelengths between 1349 nm and 1670 nm are multiplexed with multiplexer 124. The<br>
output of multiplexer 124 is coupled to a pitch side fiber optic 126 having suitable<br>
dimensions for transmitting light with wavelengths ranging from 1349 nm -1670 ;nm, both<br>
without substantial transmission losses and without the introduction of mode noise:. A<br>
suitable fiber optic for these wavelengths is Corning SMF28. However, the 760 nm input, if<br>
multiplexed and coupled to an SMF28 optical fiber would, after transmission over a relatively<br>
short distance, become multimodal. Accordingly, the output of the 760 nm laser is coupled to<br>
a fiber which is single mode for wavelengths less than 1280 nm such as SMF750. The laser<br>
light transmitted in the input fiber 122n and the multiplexed laser light transmitted in the<br>
pitch side optical fiber 126 can be coupled nearby the pitch optic 128. The coupler 130 and<br>
pitch optic 128 are preferably optically connected by a short length of transmission optical<br>
fiber 132 with the transmission optical fiber 132 being selected to transmit all of the coupled<br>
and multiplexed wavelengths without significant loss. A suitable transmission optical fiber<br>
for the system depicted in Fig. 8 would be Corning SMF28. Provided that the transmission<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
optical fiber is relatively short, the 760 run laser light coupled to the transmission optical fiber<br>
132 will not exhibit multimodal behavior. For the system and fibers depicted in Fig. 8, it has<br>
been determined that the transmission optical fiber must be kept to a length of 3 meters or<br>
less to avoid the introduction of significant multimodal noise.<br>
A similar system is shown in Fig. 2 where coupler 136 receives input from both a 760<br>
nm diode laser and a multiplexed beam from diode lasers having substantially longer<br>
wavelengths.<br>
ALIGNMENT SYSTEM<br>
Preferably, the sensing system of the present invention incorporates an auto alignment<br>
feature that allows the pitch and catch optics to maintain optimal alignment even though they<br>
are bolted on to a boiler or other hostile process chamber which is, itself, subject to<br>
movement from thermal effects, wind and vibration. In a highly preferred embodiment of the<br>
present system, both the pitch and catch optics are mounted on feedback-controlled tip/tilt<br>
stages.   The requirement that both pitch and catch optics be mounted on tip/tilt stages results<br>
from the fact that the sensor is totally fiber-coupled. Thus, multiplexed light is launched<br>
across the measurement region by a collimating pitch optic attached directly to an input fiber,<br>
and the catch optic couples the transmitted light directly into an output fiber that typically is a<br>
multimode fiber. Accordingly, the catch optic must be oriented so that it is collinear with the<br>
beam emanating from the pitch optics. This is necessary so that the focused transmitted beam<br>
will arrive within the acceptance cone of the multimode catch fiber.<br>
In order to discriminate transmitted laser light from intense background light (for<br>
example, from the flames in a coal furnace), the field of view and focus of the detector can be<br>
limited to sense only light with the same direction and position as the input laser light. This<br>
may be done conveniently by focusing detected light into an optical fiber coupled to a<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
suitable detector. The basic optical system design of an embodiment of the present invention<br>
is shown schematically in Fig. 9. The transmitter 136 of Fig. 7 consists of a pitch optic 138 or<br>
collimator such as a collimating lens of one or more than one layer and associated mounting<br>
and alignment structures and electronics. Similarly, the receiver 140 of Fig. 7 consists of a<br>
catch optic 142 or collimator of similar or varied construction from the pitch optic and<br>
associated mounting and alignment electronics. The efficiency and background<br>
discrimination of a transmitter-receiver pair are tied to alignment tolerance. For highest<br>
efficiency and discrimination, the alignment tolerances for both the transmitter and receiver<br>
are severe. The transmitter must be pointed accurately enough so that most of the transmitted<br>
light strikes the clear aperture of the catch optic 146, as indicated in Fig. 10. For a typical<br>
system, this amounts to a 1 cm tolerance over a typical transmission distance of 10 meters, or<br>
1 milliradian. (With target distances between 5 and 30 meters and launched spot sizes<br>
between 1 and 3 cm, diffraction is a small contribution.)<br>
As is graphically illustrated in Fig. 11, the receiver's angular acceptance is determined<br>
by the fiber core 148 diameter divided by the catch optic 150 focal length. A shorter focal<br>
length will increase the angular acceptance, but the receiver clear aperture becomes<br>
correspondingly smaller. A compromise having adequate clear aperture and angular<br>
acceptance is to use a 50 mm focal length lens and a 50 micrometer core fiber. This results in<br>
a 2 cm clear aperture and a 1-milliradian cone of angular acceptance.<br>
A preferred alignment system must therefore position two optics to point at each other<br>
with tolerances of 1 milliradian in both tip and tilt, for a total of four degrees of freedom.<br>
These four degrees of freedom might possibly be accomplished by rough alignment of one<br>
side followed by a four-dimensional alignment (tip, tilt, and lateral position in x and y) of the<br>
other side, but this assumes that large lateral motions are permissible. Since access; ports for<br>
target environments may be as small as 1 inch, this is potentially a problematic solution.<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
Alternatively, active pointing alignment at both ends can ensure proper alignment when<br>
limited space is available for lateral movement.<br>
The critical alignment of the pitch and catch optics must be maintained in a harsh and<br>
variable environment. Vibration, wind loading, temperature change and other structural shifts<br>
may all lead to misalignments, as will mechanical creep in the transmitter and receiver<br>
optomechanics. Misalignment can also be expected after periodic maintenance, when the<br>
transmitter and receiver heads are removed for cleaning and then re-mounted. Ideally, the<br>
optical system of the present invention will be able to maintain its 1 milliradian optical<br>
alignment in the face of system misalignments that could approach 50 milliradians. The<br>
alignment system should also retain position during power outages and tolerate total loss of<br>
signal, and be turned off without losing alignment. Finally, the system itself must preferably<br>
be ragged enough to function continuously for an extended period of time in an exposed,<br>
industrial environment.<br>
Fig. 12 schematically illustrates an embodiment of alignable pitch or catch optics.<br>
The transmitter and receiver are similar in design: the transmitter generates a collimated<br>
beam of laser light from light emerging from an optical fiber, and the receiver captures a<br>
collimated beam of laser light and focuses it into a fiber. (It is possible to send light backward<br>
through this optical system, and most of the elements of the transmitter and receiver are<br>
identical.) The transmitter and receiver optics may be mounted in NEMA-4 enclosures to<br>
protect them from the environment. The following description applies to either the: transmitter<br>
or receiver module.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the pre-collimated fiber/lens pair 152 is attached to a kinematic<br>
tilt stage 154 positioned to allow tip and tilt perpendicular to the optical axis. Two direct-<br>
drive stepper motors 156 accomplish tip and tilt. These motors are controlled by computer via<br>
an Ethernet or similar connection. This connection may be through optical fiber in order to<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
avoid electrical interference. The stepper motors 156 hold their position when power is<br>
removed, so the optical alignment is unaffected by electrical power outages.<br>
During periodic or continuous system alignment, the control computer monitors the<br>
amount of laser light that is transmitted and detected. Preferably, a discrete alignment<br>
wavelength may be provided for continuous or periodic alignment proceedings such as the<br>
visible light source 64 of Fig. 3. Any misalignment will reduce this detected signal. In auto-<br>
alignment mode, the computer measures the detected signal, directs one of the two stepper<br>
motors to move a small amount in one direction, then re-measures the detected signal. If the<br>
signal increases, then the computer directs the stepper motor to move again in the same<br>
direction until the signal does not increase. The computer then directs the other stepper motor<br>
to move along the orthogonal axis to maximize the detected signal, then repeats the whole<br>
process for the other sensor head. As the detected signal increases, the detector amplifier<br>
gain automatically decreases so that the auto-alignment process proceeds over several<br>
decades of signal size. The auto-alignment system can function with detected powers from<br>
nanowatts to milliwatts.<br>
This "hill-climbing" algorithm is able to align the system after near-total loss of<br>
signal, in the presence of substantial noise, and is tolerant of beam blockages, power outages,<br>
mechanical shocks and other disturbances that could cause other alignment systems to<br>
misalign to the limits of the control electronics. All that is required for auto-alignment is a<br>
finite signal with a global maximum in position space. Depending on specific installation<br>
conditions, auto-alignment may occur periodically at set intervals such as every hour or as<br>
needed after an extended period such as days of operation. The control computer may<br>
monitor the detected signal and auto-align only when the signal drops below a pre-set<br>
threshold.<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
The transmitter and receiver modules may incorporate several other features useful<br>
for industrial applications. Optional sensors may detect when the modules are moved out of<br>
position for cleaning or maintenance, and all lasers are turned off for safety. As shown on<br>
Fig. 10, All electrical and optical connections may made through a hinge 158 so that all such<br>
connections are undisturbed by maintenance operations. The enclosure 160 protects the<br>
sensitive internal optics from contaminants, and is preferable hosable. The hinge range of<br>
motion may be restricted to avoid operator injury. Preferably, each sensor head will require<br>
less than 10 watts of input electrical power during auto-alignment, and less than 0.1 watt after<br>
auto-alignment is complete.<br>
Alternate designs may be suitable for different applications. Considerable size and<br>
weight reduction are possible if NEMA-4 enclosure rating is not required. Different<br>
transmission distances may allow optics of different focal length and clear aperture to<br>
optimize the captured signal. As an alternative to the stepper motor-driven tilt stage described<br>
above to control pointing by moving the entire fiber-lens assembly, the fiber may be moved<br>
laterally relative to the lens to effect the same pointing change while moving a much smaller<br>
mass. Different electromechanics such as piezoelectric elements or voice coils may also be<br>
used to increase the speed of the auto-alignment system.<br>
In addition to the alignment concerns discussed above, the specific choice of pitch and<br>
catch optics can affect the performance of the TDLAS sensing system of the present<br>
invention in several ways:<br>
(1)	Signal strength coupled to the detectors depends on pitch/catch efficiency.<br>
(2)	The amount of undesirable background emission coupled to the detectors depends<br>
on catch optics etendue.<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
(3)	The effects of few-mode noise at 760 nm are very sensitive to the pitclii/catch<br>
configuration.<br>
(4)	The noise characteristics (small but more steady or larger with wild swings) are<br>
expected to depend on the launched beam size. A larger launch beam is preferable.<br>
(5)	The system misalignment sensitivity is a direct function of pitch and catch focal<br>
lengths and associated fiber sizes.<br>
A very simplistic picture of a typical coal fired power plant combustion zone can be<br>
adopted for optical component selection analysis. The purpose of such analysis is to focus on<br>
the general effects on a laser beam passing through the fireball with as little knowledge of the<br>
fireball details as possible. Traversing the fireball has three effects on a light beam:<br>
(1)	Soot particles absorb some of the light.<br>
(2)	Large-angle refraction or scattering prevents some of the light from reaching the<br>
catch optic.<br>
(3)	Light passes through numerous small thermal gradients and is thus steered<br>
randomly but still reaches the catch optic.<br>
Only the third category of light is available for collection. Assuming that a typical ray<br>
of light undergoes multiple refracting events while traversing the fireball, the direction of the<br>
ray follows a random path, and can drift away from its initial direction. If the ray is part of a<br>
larger beam composed of other rays that undergo similar but not identical drifts, then the<br>
effect of the fireball on the beam causes four distinct types of changes:<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PCT/US2004/010048<br>
(1)	Change in the overall direction of the entire beam<br>
(2)	Change in the position of the centroid of the beam<br>
(3)	Change in the beam size<br>
(4)	Change in beam divergence/wavefront flatness<br>
These four types of changes are parameters which include all the major effects on the<br>
beam that will affect collection efficiency, without regard for the physics leading to these<br>
effects.<br>
If the directions of the rays of light in the fireball are undergoing random drift then the<br>
ray directions may diffuse away from the initial (nominally optimum) direction according to<br>
a standard diffusion dependence. However, the distance of a ray of light from the original<br>
axis depends on its prior directions. Thus, for a given amount of rms beam steering,<br>
determined by the details of the fireball, a directly proportional amount of beam offset can be<br>
expected. If a laser beam traversing the fireball is blown up to several times its original size<br>
then the same relationship will hold between the final beam size and final beam divergence.<br>
Light collection efficiency can be estimated if we know the angle, location and beam<br>
size of the light incident on the catch optics. The estimate assumes simple ray optics, flat-top<br>
intensities and a simple estimate the amount of light incident on the catch optic that is within<br>
the fiber numerical aperture NA and which is boresighted to strike the core of the fiber. The<br>
end result is a "hill" in offset-angle space.   Assuming optimum alignment, collection<br>
efficiency is close to the top of the hill but may be rapidly moving over and around the hill as<br>
beam angle and position fluctuate. Preferably, the collection efficiency lull will be both as tall<br>
and as broad as possible. Several points about the hill are worth noting:<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2004/090496	PC17US2004/010048<br>
(1)	The peak height of the collection efficiency hill (for zero beam offset and tilt) is<br>
proportional to the square of the catch optic etendue (focal length times NA) unless the catch<br>
optic is large enough to capture the entire incident beam, at which point the catch efficiency<br>
is 100%.<br>
(2)	The hill is elliptical, and changing the catch focal length makes one ax::s longer<br>
and the other shorter.<br>
(3)	The fluctuation in light collection efficiency due to beam jitter is a noise source.<br>
Based upon the foregoing analysis techniques, the signal to noise ratio of different<br>
pitch/catch combinations may be compared. Assuming that the multiplicative noisie is the<br>
same, different catch optics differ in final performance only if the fireball background noise<br>
or detector noise are dominant.<br>
