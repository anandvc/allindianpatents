				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a dispersion composition and a process for manufacturing the same. The dispersion composition contains an anthraquinone dye compound having a fluoro sulphonyl group useful for colouring synthetic textile materials, especially materials of aromatic polyester fibre or fibre blends thereof and the invention also relates particularly to a process for preparing such dispersion compositions containing anthraquinone dyes.<br>
JP-A-54-050681 discloses dyes, including anthraquinone dyes, for use as reactive disperse dyes for cellulose. US-A-3952029 discloses the use of certain anthraquinone dyes for use in the colouration of nylon fibres.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a dispersion composition comprising<br>
a dye compound dispersed in an aqueous medium and present in an amount of from 1 to 30% by weight of dye compound and aqueous medium, a dispersing agent of the kind as herein described present in an amount of 10 to 200% by weight of the dye compound and optionally additionally comprising ingredients selected from conventional components such as wetting agents and defoamers of the kind as herein described, which dye compound is free from water solubilizing groups and is of Formula (1) or (2) respectively :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of dispersion composition, comprising mixing homogenously a dye compound of formula (1) or (2), in an amount of from 1 to 30% by weight of the composition, a dispersing agent of the kind as herein described in an amount of 10 to 200% by weight of the dye compound and conventional components such as wetting agents and defoamers of the kind as herein described in an aqueous medium in a manner such as herein described, to obtain a dispersion composition in the form of homogenous mixture.<br>
The dispersion composition is neither a product of chemical reaction nor a mere admixture resulting in the aggregation of the properties of the individual components but is in fact a synergistic composition having improved and unexpected properties in that the respective components of the dispersion cooperate together so as to provide, in application thereof to a textile fabric, a dyed product having surprisingly good wet-fastness and light-fastness properties.<br>
The dye compounds of Formulae (1) and (2) may be mixed or the dye compounds of Formulae (1) and (2) may be mixed with dyes which do not contain an -SO2F group; dispersion compositions containing such mixtures are a feature of the present invention.<br>
The mixtures may be simple physical mixtures or may be mixed crystals formed for example by co-crystallisation. Such mixtures generally show improvement in dyeing properties. Crystalline modifications of dye compounds of Formulae (1) and (2) exist and the present definition includes such crystalline modifications which may for example be formed by heat treatment.<br>
The presence of one or more -S02F groups in a dye molecule generally improves the properties of that dye and confers surprisingly good wet-fastness and light-fastness properties.<br>
The synthetic textile material which may be coloured by a dye compound of Formula (1) or (2) may be selected from secondary cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, polyamide, polyacrylonitrile and aromatic polyester. The synthetic textile material is preferably polyamide or aromatic polyester, such as polyhexamethylene adipamide or polyethylene terephthalate more preferably aromatic polyester and especially polyethylene terephthalate. Fibre blends may comprise mixtures of different synthetic textile materials or mixtures of synthetic and natural textile materials. Preferred fibre blends are those of polyester-cellulose such as polyester-cotton. The textile materials or blends thereof may be in the form of filaments, loose fibres, yarn, woven or knitted fibres.<br>
The dyes of Formulae (1) and (2) have low solubility in water, being free from water solubilising groups' such as -SO3H, -C02H, PO3H and quaternary amino.<br>
The dye of Formula (1) or (2), optionally in conjunction with other disperse dyes, may be applied to the synthetic textile materials or fibre blends thereof by methods which are conventionally employed in dyeing such materials and fibre blends with disperse dyes. For example, the dye of Formula (1) or (2), in the form of an aqueous dispersion may be applied by dyeing, padding or printing processes using the conditions and additives conventionally used in carrying out such processes.<br>
The process conditions may be selected from the following:<br>
i)   exhaust dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 125°C to 140°C for from 10 to 120 minutes and under a pressure of from 1 to 2 bar, a sequesterant being optionally added;<br>
ii)  continuous dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 190°C to 225°C for from 15 seconds to 5 minutes, a migration inhibitor being optionally added;<br>
iii) direct printing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 160°C to 185°C for 4 to 15 minutes for high temperature steaming, or at a temperature of from 190°C to 225°C for 15 seconds to 5 minutes for bake fixation with dry heat or at a temperature of from 120°C to 140°C and 1 to 2 bar for 10 to 45 minutes for pressure steaming, wetting agents and thickeners (such as alginates) of from 5 to 100% by weight of the dye being optionally added;<br>
iv)  discharge printing (by padding the dye onto the textile material, drying and overprinting) at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, migration inhibitors and thickeners being optionally added;<br>
v)   carrier dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 95°C to 100°C using.a carrier such as methylnaphthalene, diphenylamine or 2-phenylphenol, sequesterants being optionally added; and<br>
vi)  atmospheric dyeing of acetate, triacetate and nylon at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of 85°C for acetate or at a temperature of 90°C for triacetate and nylon for from 15 to 90 minutes, sequesterants being optionally added.<br>
In all of the above processes the compound of Formula (1) or (2) is applied as a dispersion comprising from 0.001% to 4% of the compound in aqueous medium.<br>
The present compounds generally provide coloured textile material which shows, good fastness to washing, light and heat.<br>
The ompounds of Formulae (1) and (2), namely .<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
are novel.<br>
Compositions comprising dispersions of the compound of Formula (1) or (2) in aqueous media are also novel.<br><br>
The compositions typically comprise from 1% to 30% of the compound of Formula (1) or (2) and are preferably buffered at a pH from 2 to 7, more preferably at a pH from 4 to 6.<br>
These dispersions comprise dispersing agents, for example lignosulphonates, naphthalene sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensates or<br>
phenol/cresol/sulphanilic acid/formaldehyde condensates, and may further comprise ingredients conventionally used in dyeing applications such as surfactants, wetting agents such as alkyl aryl ethoxylates which may be sulphonated or phosphated, inorganic salts, de-foamers such as mineral oil or nonanol, organic liquids and buffers.<br>
Dispersing agents may be present at from 10% to 200% on the weight of the compound of Formula (1) or (2). Wetting agents may be used at from 0% to 20% on the weight of the compound of the Formula (1) or (2). The dispersions may be prepared by bead milling the compound of Formula (1) or (2) with glass beads or sand in an aqueous medium.<br>
The compounds of Formulae (1) and (2) may be obtained by usual methods for the preparation of anthraquinone compounds such as by oxidation of anthracene or substituted anthracenes with potassium dichromate in sulphuric acid or by reaction of phthalic anhydride with benzene or a substituted benzene in the presence of an aluminium chloride followed by ring closure in hot sulphuric acid.<br>
Fluorosulphonyl groups may be introduced into the compound of Formula (1) or (2) by methods generally available in the literature. For example reaction of such<br>
a precursor of a compound of Formula (1) or (2) free from, fluorosulphonyl with chlorosulphonic acid optionally in the presence of dimethylformamide and thionylchloride at a temperature of from 30°C to 100°C gives the chlorosulphonyl derivative. The chlorosulphonyl derivative may be; reacted in boiling aqueous media with potassium, fluoride to give the fluorosulphonyl derivative.<br>
Alternatively a precursor compound of Formula (1) or (2) free from fluorosulphonyl may be sulphonated with sulphuric acid or oleum to give the sulphonic acid derivative which may be converted to the chlorosulphonyl derivative by reaction, either of the free acid or an inorganic salt thereof, with thionylchloride optionally in the presence of a chlorophosphorus compound such as phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus pentachloride in an organic liquid such as an aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of from 20°C to 11G°C. The chlorosulphonyl derivative may then be converted to the fluorosulphonyl derivative as described above.<br>
The compounds of Formulae (1) and (2) are useful for the coloration of synthetic textile materials particularly polyester textile materials and fibre blends thereof to which they impart colours which have excellent wet and light fastness properties.<br>
The compounds of Formulae (1) and (2) are also useful for the mass coloration of plastics as described above .and impart bright colours generally with good clarity and light fastness.<br>
The preparation of dye compounds for incorporation into a dispersion composition embodying the invention is further illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of l~amino-4-hydroxy-2-(4-<br>
fluorosulphonylphenoxy) anthraquinone<br>
To a. mixture of l-amino-4-hydroxy-2-(4-chlorosulphonylphenoxy) anthraquinone (2 parts) and 1,4-dioxane (25 parts), stirring at ambient temperature, was added a solution of potassium fluoride (0.6 parts) in water (5 parts). The mixture was heated to 60°C and stirred at this temperature for 20 minutes. After cooling to 0-5°C the product was isolated by filtration, washed with water and dried at 50°C to yield: l-amino-4-hydroxy-2-(4-fluorosulphonylphenoxy) anthraquinone (1.6 parts). ΛMAX = 515. Onm (CH2C12) .<br>
Example 2 (Reference Example)<br>
Preparation of 1,5-dihydroxy-2-(4'-hydroxy-3'-<br>
fluorosulphonylphenyi)-4,8-diaminoanthraquinone<br>
Chlorosulphonic acid (11.4 parts) was stirred at room temperature while 1,5-dihydroxy-2~(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-4,8-diaminoanthraquinone (0.5 parts) was added slowly over 30 mins. After stirring for 30 minutes thionyl chloride (2.5 parts) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 40°C for 3 hours. On cooling the reaction mixture was poured into ice/water and the resulting aqueous suspension was filtered to yield the sulphonyl chloride derivative (0.49 parts).<br>
The sulphonyl chloride derivative (1.6 parts) was added to 1,4-dioxane (94 parts) at room temperature before adding potassium fluoride (5.2 parts) in water<br><br>
 (111 parts). After heating at 60°C for 4 hours the mixture was cooled, filtered and dried to yield 1,5-dihydroxy-2-<br>
(4'-hydroxy-3'-fluorosulphonylphenyl) -4 , 8-diaminoanthraquinone (1.02 parts) ΛMAX = 587nm, 629 nm. The dye of Formula (2) above was also prepared by the procedure of Example 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
