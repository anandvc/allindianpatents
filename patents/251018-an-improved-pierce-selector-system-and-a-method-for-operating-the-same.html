PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following Complete specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to pierce selector system used in Press Tools (Dies and Punches) and more particularly relates to pierce selector system by using power and mechanical linkages.<br>
Background of invention:<br>
Conventional pierce selector unit uses, separate power cylinders and related ancillaries for each punch for its operation, which makes the system as a whole more cumbersome and large in size which is shown in fig.lA and IB.<br>
Fig.lA shows a conventional pierce selector unit when punch is in extended position and fig. IB shows a retracted (normal) position.<br>
Referring fig.lA and IB.<br>
The punch "A" moves with the help of wedge "B" which is operated by wedge "D" and in turn the said wedge "D" is powered by a separate power cylinder "C" and springs "E" pushes the punch "A" to its normal position when wedge "D" is pulled back by the power cylinder "C".<br>
The following are the draw backs associated with the above said conventional pierce selector unit:<br>
1.	More space is required to mount the punches on die.<br>
2.	Requires steel stripper for stripping.<br>
3.	Punches can't be removed without disturbing selector unit assembly.<br>
2<br><br>
Brief description of invention:<br>
A pierce selector system consists of power cylinder assembly, cable, wedge, punch, and punch holder, key, rubber stripper. Where the wedge is slidably placed inside the punch holder and connected to the power cylinder assembly with the help of cables and the said wedge has a taper surface on one side and the punch also has a corresponding taper surface at one end on its base to have a sliding movement with respect to wedge. Longitudinal motion of the punch beyond the required stroke and rotational movement is prevented by providing a key in the punch holder and a slot on the punch. A rubber stripper is placed on the punch to strip the component and also to revert back the punch to its normal position.<br>
Reverse Movement:<br>
When power cylinder assembly is operated in reverse direction the cable connected to the cylinder is pulled which in turn pulls the one edge of the wedge, because of wedge movement the punch moves in longitudinal direction.<br>
Forward movement:<br>
When power cylinder assembly is operated in forward direction the cable pulls the other end of the wedge and creates space for accommodation of the punch and the punch is retracted back by rubber stripper.<br>
3<br><br>

Detailed description of invention:<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
6<br><br>
Fig.l A: shows conventional pierce selector unit when punch is in extracted<br>
position.<br>
Fig.1B: shows conventional pierce selector unit when punch is in retracted<br>
(normal) position.<br>
Fig. 2A: shows pierce selector system when the punch is in extended<br>
position.<br>
Fig.2B: shows pierce selector system when the punch is in retracted (normal)<br>
position.<br>
Fig.3: shows exploded view of pierce selector system with power cylinder<br>
assembly when the punch is in extended position.<br>
Fig.4: shows exploded view of pierce selector system with power cylinder<br>
assembly when the punch is in retracted (normal) position.<br>
Now with reference to fig. 2A &amp; 2B, which consist of cylinder assembly (11), cable linkage (13 A &amp; 13 B), and wedge (7), punch holder (4), cable holder (5), rubber rest (3), stripping rubber (1) and key (6). Wherein the wedge (7) is slidably placed inside the said punch holder (4) and connected to the power cylinder assembly (11) with the help of cables (13A &amp; 13B) and the said wedge has a taper surface on one side and said punch also has a corresponding taper surface at one end on its base to have a sliding movement with respect to said wedge. Longitudinal motion of the punch beyond the required stroke and rotational movement is prevented by providing a key (6) in the said punch holder and a slot on the said punch. A rubber stripper (1) is placed on the said punch to strip the piercing component and also to revert back the punch to its normal position.<br>
When power cylinder assembly (11) is operated in reverse direction the cable(13A) connected to the said assembly is pulled while in turn pulls the<br>
7<br><br>
taper end of wedge(7), because of wedge movement the punch moves in extended position.<br>
When power cylinder assembly (11) is operated in forward direction the cable(13B) pulls the other end of the wedge(7) and creates space for accommodation of the punch(2) and the said punch is retracted back by rubber stripper(l).<br>
Now with reference to fig. 3 &amp; 4, this shows an exploded view of additional power cylinder assembly connected with said pierce selector system.<br>
Said power cylinder assembly consists of power cylinders (11), sliding plate (8), fixed plates (16 &amp; 17), spacers (18), tension adjustment screws (9), and locking nuts (10). Wherein sliding plate (8) is fitted to piston rods of the cylinders (11), two fixed plates (16 &amp; 17) are fitted with body of said cylinders by using spacers (18) to maintain the fixed gap between them. Sliding plate(8) has equidistance slots to hold the ends of inner cables, tension adjustment screws (9) are fitted with lock nuts (10) on said fixed plates. One end of cables(13A &amp; 13 B) if single punch and cables(14A&amp;14 B) if more than one , is connected to sliding plate(8) and outer case of said cable ends are held in its position by tension adjustment screws(9) and another end of said cables are connected to wedges(7). All cables connected to the taper end of wedges are fitted on the fixed plates (16) and cables connected to the other end of wedges are connected to the second fixed plate (17).<br>
When power cylinder is operated it moves sliding plate in forward and reveres direction. When air is supplied to port(12A) of cylinder, sliding plate<br>
8<br><br>
moves in reverse direction, it pulls the wedge (7) through inner cable (13A) due to which the punch (2) moves in extended position which is shown in fig.3.<br>
When punch is at extended position, after completion of stroke in press, punch (2) enters in die block (15) resulting in piercing of hole.<br>
When air is supplied to port (12B) of cylinder ,sliding plate moves in forward direction, it pull the wedge (7) through inner cable (13B) which creates a space for accommodation of punch (2).<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br>
