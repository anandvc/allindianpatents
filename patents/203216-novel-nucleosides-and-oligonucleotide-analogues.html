				<td>SPECIFICATION NOVEL NUCLEOSIDE AND OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ANALOGUES<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to novel oligonucleotide analogues, which exhibit antisense or antigene activity having excellent stability, or exhibit excellent activity as a detection agent (probe) for a specific gene or as a primer for starting amplification, and to novel nucleoside analogues which are intermediates for their production.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Oligonucleotide analogues, which have excellent antisense or antigene activity and which are stable in the body are expected to be useful Pharmaceuticals. In addition, oligonucleotide analogues having a high degree of stable complementary chain formation ability with DNA or mRNA are useful as detection agents for a specific gene or as primers for starting amplification.<br>
In contrast, naturally-occurring oligonucleotides are known to be quickly decomposed by various nucleases present in the blood and cells. In some cases, naturally-occurring oligonucleotides may not have sufficient sensitivity for use as detection agents for specific genes or as primers for starting amplification due to limitations on their affinity with complementary base sequences.<br>
In order to overcome these shortcomings, various non-naturally-occurring oligonucleotide analogues have been produced, and have been attempted to be developed for use as pharmaceuticals or detection agents for specific genes. Namely, known examples of such non-naturally-occurring oligonucleotide.analogues include those in which an oxygen atom attached to a phosphorus atom in a phosphodiester bond of an oligonucleotide is replaced with a sulfur atom, those in which said oxygen atom is replaced with a methylene group, those in which said oxygen atom is replaced with a boron atom, and those in which a sugar moiety or base moiety of an oligonucleotide is chemically modified. For example, ISIS Corp. has developed thioate-type oligonucleotide ISIS2922 (Vitravene) as a therapeutic agent for human cytomegalovirus retinitis and ISIS2922 has been put on the open market in the United States.<br>
However, in consideration of the potency of the antisense or antigene activity in<br><br>
the above non-naturally-occurring oligonucleotide analogues, namely the ability to form a stable complementary chain with DNA or mRNA, stability with respect to various nucleases, and the manifestation of adverse side effects due to non-specific bonding with various proteins in the body, there has been a need for a non-naturally-occurring oligonucleotide analogue having even better stability in the body, a low incidence of adverse side effects and a high ability to form complementary chains.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
The inventors of the present invention conducted intensive research over a long period of time on non-naturally-occurring oligonucleotide analogues having excellent antisense or antigene activity, excellent stability in the body and a low incidence of adverse side effects. As a result of that research, they found that oligonucleotide analogues or nucleoside analogues having an ether bond in said molecules are useful as an antisense or antigene pharmaceutical having excellent stability, a detection agent (probe) for a specific gene, a primer for starting amplification or as intermediates for their production, and accomplished the present invention.<br>

The present step is to prepare the compound (lb) by reacting the compound (la) obtained by Step A-4 with a deprotecting reagent in an inert solvent.<br>
The deprotection method varies depending on the kind of protecting group and is not particularly limited unless it causes other side reactions and can be carried out, for example, by a method described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, 1999, Published by A Wiley-Interscience Publication).<br>
Particularly, the deprotection method can be carried out by the following methods in the case where the protecting group is (1) "an aliphatic acyl group or an aromatic acyl group", (2) "a methyl group substituted by from 1 to 3 aryl groups" or "a methyl group substituted by from 1 to 3 aryl groups the aryl ring of which is substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen or cyano group" or (3) "a silyl group".<br>
(1) In the case where the protecting group is an aliphatic acyl group or an aromatic acyl group, the deprotection reaction is usually carried out by treating it with a base in an inert solvent.<br>
The solvent employable here is not particularly limited so long as it is easily mixed with water, does not inhibit the reaction and dissolves the starting material to some extent and may include aqueous or anhydrous amides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane or carbon tetrachloride; and ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and dioxane; preferably ethers, more preferably tetrahydrofuran.<br>

39<br>
hours.<br>
After the reaction, the desired compound (lb) of the present reaction is obtained, for example, by concentrating the reaction mixture, adding an organic solvent immiscible with water such as ethyl acetate, washing with water, separating an organic layer containing the desired compound, drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and distilling off the solvent.<br>
The desired product thus obtained can be further purified, if necessary, by a conventional method, for example, recrystallization, silica gel column chromatography and the like.<br>
(2) In the case where the protecting group is "a methyl group substituted by from one to three aryl groups" or "a methyl group substituted by from one to three aryl groups the aryl ring of which is substituted by a lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen or cyano group", the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent using a reducing agent.<br>
The solvent employable here may preferably include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, benzene and xylene; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane and cyclohexane; esters such as ethyl acetate and propyl acetate; organic acids such as acetic acid; or a mixture of these organic solvents and water.<br>
The reducing agent employable here is not particularly limited so long as it is usually used for a catalytic reduction and may preferably include palladium on carbon, Raney nickel, platinum oxide, platinum black, rhodium-aluminum oxide, triphenylphosphine-rhodium chloride and palladium-barium sulfate.<br>
The pressure is not particularly limited but is usually from 1 to 10 arm.<br>
The reaction temperature is from 0°C to 60°C, preferably from 20°C to 40°C.<br>
The reaction time is from 10 minutes to 24 hours, preferably from one hour to three hours.<br>
After the reaction, the desired compound (lb) of the present reaction is obtained, for example, by removing the reducing agent from the reaction mixture, adding an organic solvent immiscible with water such as ethyl acetate, washing with water, separating an organic layer containing the desired compound, drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and distilling off the solvent. The desired product thus<br><br>
40<br>
obtained can be further purified, if necessary, by a conventional method, for example, recrystallization, silica gel column chromatography and the like.<br>
In the case where the protecting group is "a methyl group substituted by three aryl groups", i.e., a trityl group, the deprotection reaction can be also carried out using an acid.<br>

The reaction temperature is not particularly limited, but is usually from -20°C to 100°C, preferably from 10 to 40°C.<br>
The reaction time varies depending on the starting material, the reagent and the reaction temperature and is usually from 5 minutes to 30 hours, preferably 30 minutes in the case where the reaction is carried out at room temperature.<br>
After the reaction, the desired compound (16) of the present reaction is obtained, for example, by appropriately neutralizing the reaction mixture, removing insolubles by filtration in the case where they exist, adding an organic solvent immiscible with water such as ethyl acetate, washing with water, separating an organic layer containing the desired compound, drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and distilling off the solvent. The desired product thus obtained can be further purified, if necessary, by a conventional method, for example, recrystallization, reprecipitation or chromatography and the like. (Step E-3)<br>
In this step, the target oligonucleotide analogue is produced by an automated DNA synthesizer using at least one compound (16) prepared in step E-2 and commercially available phosphoramidite reagents required for producing an oligonucleotide analogue of a desired nucleotide sequence in accordance with conventional methods.<br>
An oligonucleotide analogue having a desired nucleotide sequence can be synthesized by a DNA synthesizer such as the Perkin-Elmer Model 392 using the phosphoramidite method in accordance with the method described in the literature<br><br>

(Nucleic Acids Research, 12, 4539 (1984)).<br>
In addition, in the case of converting to a thioate as desired, a thioate derivative can be obtained in accordance with the method described in the literature (Tetrahedron Letters, 32, 3005 (1991), J. Am. Chem. Soc, 112, 1253 (1990)) using, besides sulfur, a reagent that forms a thioate by reacting with trivalent phosphoric acid such as tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TETD, Applied Biosystems Inc.) or Beaucage reagent (Millipore Corp.).<br>
The resulting crude oligonucleotide analogue can be purified by OligoPak (reverse phase chromatocolumn) and the purity of the product can be confirmed by HPLC analysis.<br>
The chain length of the resulting oligonucleotide analogue is normally 2 to 50 units, and preferably 10 to 30 units, in nucleoside units.<br>
The complementary chain formation ability and nuclease enzyme resistance of the resulting oligonucleotide analogue can be determined according to the methods described below. (Test Method 1)<br>
The hybrid formation ability of the oligonucleotide analogue of the present invention with respect to complementary DNA and RNA can be determined by annealing the various resulting oligonucleotide analogues with an oligonucleotide analogue composed of naturally-occurring DNA or RNA having a complementary sequence and measuring the melting temperature (Tm value).<br>
A sample solution containing equal amounts of oligonucleotide analogue and naturally^occurring complementary oligonucleotide in sodium phosphate buffer solution was put into a boiling water bath and then slowly cooled to room temperature over the course of time (annealing). The temperature of the solution was then raised little by little from 20°C to 90°C in the cell chamber of a spectrophotometer (e.g., Shimadzu UV-2100PC) followed by measurement of ultraviolet absorption at 260 run. (Test Method 2) Measurement of Nuclease Enzyme Resistance<br>
To the oligonucleotide in a buffer solution was added a nuclease and the mixture was wanned. Examples of nucleases that are used include snake venom phosphodiesterase, endonuclease P1 and endonuclease S1. Although there are no particular restrictions on the buffer solution provided it is a buffer solution suitable for enzymes, Tris-HCl buffer is used in the case of snake venom phosphodiesterase, while<br><br>
59<br>
sodium acetate buffer is used in the case of endonuclease P1. In addition, metal ions are added to the buffer solution as necessary. Examples of metal ions used include Mg   in the case of snake venom phosphodiesterase and Zn2+ in the case of endonuclease. The reaction temperature is preferably 0 to 100°C, and more preferably 30 to 50°C.<br>
Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is added after a predetermined amount of time followed by heating at 100°C for 2 minutes in order to quench the reaction.<br>
Examples of methods used to assay the amount of oligonucleotide remaining include a method in which the oligonucleotide is labelled with a radioisotope, etc. followed by assaying the cleavage reaction product with an image analyzer and so forth, a method in which the cleavage reaction product is assayed by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and a method in which the cleavage reaction product is stained with a dye (such as ethidium bromide) and assayed by image processing using a computer.<br>

In the above cycle 2) when the compound obtained in Example 9 was used the reaction time was 10 minutes and when phosphoramidites were used the reaction time was 25 seconds.<br>
After synthesis of a desired oligonucleotide derivative sequence, the 5'-DTMr group was removed and then the carrier containing the desired product was conventionally treated with concentrated aqueous ammonia solution in order to detach the oligomer from the carrier and to deprotect the cyanoethyl group which is protecting the phosphoric group. The amino protecting group in adenine, guanine and cytosine was removed from the oligomer. The oligonucleotide derivative was purified by reverse-phase HPLC (HPLC: LC-VP: a product of Shimazu Corp.; column : Wakopak WS-DNA: a product of Wako Pure Chemical Industry Ltd.) to afford the desired oligonucleotide.<br>

The sample solution was then heated and measured using a spectrophotometer (UV-3100PC : a product of Shimadzu Corp.). The sample was heated in a cell (cell thickness: 1.0 cm, cylindrical jacket type) by circulating water heated with an incubator (Haake FE2 : a product of EKO Corp.), and the temperature was monitored using a digital thermometer (SATO SK1250MC). The temperature was raised from 20°C to 95°C and the intensity of ultraviolet absorbance at the maximum absorption wavelength in the vicinity of 260 nm was measured for each 1°C increase in temperature. Naturally-occurring DNA (hereinafter referred to as oligonucleotide (4)) having the sequence indicated by the sequence 5'-gcgttttttgct-3' (Sequence No. 2 of the Sequence List), which is the same sequence as oligonucleotide (1) (compound of Example 29), was used as the control, and the same procedure was performed.<br>
The temperature at which the amount of change per 1°C reached a maximum was taken to be Tm (melting temperature), and the complementary chain formation ability of the oligonucleotide analogue was evaluated at this temperature.<br>
The following shows the results of measuring the Tm values of oligonucleotide (4) (naturally-occurring DNA) and oligonucleotide (1) (Compound of Example 29) relative to oligonucleotide (2) (complementary DNA) and oligonucleotide (3) (complementary RNA).<br>

87<br>
invention exhibited a remarkably higher Tm as well as remarkably higher complementary chair formation ability as compared with naturally-occurring DNA.<br>
(Test Example 2)<br>
(Measurement of Nuclease Enzyme Resistance) Exonuclease or endonuclease was mixed into a buffer solution of oligonucleotide held at 37°C for 15 minutes. The mixed solution was then held at 37°C for a predetermined amount of time. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was added to a portion of the mixed solution and the mixture was heated at 100°C for 2 minutes in order to stop the reaction. The amount of oligonucleotide remaining in the mixture was determined by reverse phase high-performance liquid column chromatography, and the time-based changes in the amount of oligonucleotide in the presence of nuclease were measured.<br>
The oligonucleotide analogues of the present invention demonstrate remarkable nuclease resistance.<br>
