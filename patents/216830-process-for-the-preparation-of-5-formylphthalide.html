				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 5-FORMYLPHTHALIDE<br>
The present invention concerns a process for the preparation of 5-<br>
formylphthalide or 1-oxo-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbaldehyde by<br>
hydrogenation of a halide of 5-carboxyphthalide.<br>
The 5-formylphthalide is a known compound of formula<br>
used as an intermediate in various processes of synthesis.<br>
For example, in the European patent application entitled "Process for the<br>
preparation of 5-substituted isobenzofurans", concurrently filed in the name of<br>
the same applicant and incorporated herein by reference, 5-formylphthalide is<br>
employed as starting material in the synthesis of l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-<br>
l-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile, represented by<br>
formula<br>
an active substance known under its International Non-proprietary Name<br>
"citalopram", used in form of its hydrobromide for the preparation of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions indicated for the treatment of depression.<br>
in particular, such an application discloses a process for the preparation of<br>
citalopram consisting of treating 5-formylphthalide with a O-substituted<br>
hydroxylamine, submitting the O-substituted oxime thus obtained, stable in the<br>
conditions of a Grignard reaction, to two subsequent Grignard reactions, one<br>
with a 4-fluorophenylmagnesium halide and the other, on the product thus<br>
obtained, with a [3-(dimethylamino)propyl]magnesium halide.<br>
The O-substituted 3-hydroxymethyl-4-[a-hydroxy-a-3-<br>
(dimethylamino)propyl-4-fluoro benzyl]benzaldoxime thus prepared is<br>
cyclized, the corresponding O-substituted l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbaldoxime is O-deprotected and<br>
the l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbaldoxime thus obtained is finally transformed into<br>
citalopram. Alternatively, the l-[3-(dime1hylaniino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbaldoxime, O-substituted with a<br>
diphenylmethyl or triphenyhnethyl group, can be concurrently deprotected and<br>
converted into citalopram in only one step, by treatment for example with<br>
formic-acetic anhydride.<br>
The only method disclosed in the literature for the preparation of 5-<br>
formylphthalide is that described in J. Chem. Soc. (1925), 127, 2275-2297,<br>
whereby the 5-formylphthalide is obtained, in admixture with 2,4-<br>
diformylbenzoic acid, by chlorination of 2,4-dimethylbenzoyl chloride and<br>
treatment of the resulting mixture with chalk in water. This synthesis, however,<br>
does not allow the desired product to be obtained in satisfactory yields. A<br>
further disadvantage is represented by the difficulties in isolating the desired<br>
product from the complex reaction mixture.<br>
Literature discloses various, generally applicable methods for the<br>
preparation of aldehydes and, in particular, various reduction methods such as<br>
Rosenmund reaction [Encyclopaedia of Organic Reagents for Organic<br>
Synthesis, vol. 6, pages 3861-3865, J. Wiley &amp; Sons (1995)]. Such a reaction<br>
involves the hydrogenation of acyl halides, preferably chlorides, dissolved in<br>
apolar aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene or xylene or in ethers such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, in the presence of partially inactivated catalytic<br>
systems. Inactivation of the catalyst, made for example by addition of solutions<br>
of sulphur dissolved in quinoline or thiourea, is necessary in order to avoid the<br>
further reduction of the aldehyde function to primary alcohol. However, such<br>
classic method cannot be used for the industrial preparation of 5-<br>
formylphthalide. In fact, owing to the partial precipitation of the product and of<br>
the consequent inactivation of the catalyst which occurs under the classic<br>
conditions of Rosenmund, the reaction proceeds more and more slowly, until to<br>
its stopping, before it is completed. In order to bring the conversion yields to<br>
acceptable levels, it becomes therefore necessary to make repeated additions of<br>
fresh catalyst, with consequent increase of costs and greater difficulties in<br>
isolating and wasting the exhausted catalyst. Furthermore, the hydrogenation<br>
carried out in apolar aromatic solvents or in ethers, notwithstanding the partial<br>
inactivation of the catalyst, gives rise to the formation of significant amounts of<br>
alcohol which, beside reducing the yields in desired product, complicates its<br>
purification.<br>
Finally, the formation of a precipitate in the presence of a supported<br>
catalyst renders the final working of the reaction mixture and the recovery of 5-<br>
formylphthalide particularly difficult.<br>
We have now found a new, particularly simple process for preparing 5-<br>
formylphthalide of high purity in good yields, which, in respect of the classical<br>
reaction of Rosenmund, not only solves the above mentioned drawbacks of<br>
poor conversion, of alcohol formation and of difficult working up, but also<br>
makes it possible to avoid the inactivation of the catalyst and the use of<br>
additional basic compounds.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides, a process for the preparation of<br>
5-formylphthalide of formula<br>
which comprises submitting a halide of formula<br>
wherein Hal represents chlorine, bromine or iodine, dissolved in a dipolar aprotic<br>
solvent to hydrogenation,<br>
where the dipolar aprotic solvent is selected from the group consisting of N,<br>
N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N, N-dimeithylacctamide (DMA), Dimethylsulfoxide<br>
(DMSO) and acetonitrile, and<br>
where the hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a hydrogenation<br>
catalyst selected from the group consisting of palladium on charcoal(Pd/C) and<br>
palladium on barium sulphate (Pd/BaSO4).<br>
The halide of formula II, in its turn, can be obtained by treatment of 5-<br>
carboxyphthalide or of an alkaline salt thereof, with a phosphor or sulphur halide such<br>
as phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphor tribromide, phosphoryl<br>
chloride, sulphuryl chloride or, preferably, thionyl chloride, in an organic solvent.<br>
A particularly preferred halide of formula II is the chloride which can be<br>
prepared, for example, as described in J.Chem. Soc, (1931), 867-871.<br>
The 5-carboxyphthalide starting material is known from the literature (US<br>
3,607,884- DE 2.630.097) and can be easily prepared in very good yields for example<br>
as described in Italian patent application MI2000A000050.<br>
Practically, it is preferable to treat 5-carboxyphthalide, optionally dissolved in an<br>
organic solvent, with thionyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amounts of N, N-<br>
dimethyl formamide, heating until the development of hydrogen chloride is no longer<br>
observed. Then, the chloride of formula II is preferably isolated and used in the present<br>
process.<br>
According to the present invention, the halide of formula H, preferably the<br>
5-chloro carbonylphthalide, dissolved in a dipolar aprotic solvent, selected<br>
among N,N-dimethyl formamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile or,<br>
preferably, N,N-dimethylacetamide, is hydrogenated in the presence of a<br>
hydrogenation catalyst, preferably of palladium on a support As a suitable<br>
support, charcoal or barium sulphate are preferably used.<br>
Hydrogenation can be carried out at ambient pressure or under pressure,<br>
practically at a pressure of from 1 to 5 bar, preferably between 2.5 and 3.5 bar.<br>
The reaction temperature may generally vary from room temperature to 120°C,<br>
advantageously between 40 and 80°C, preferably it is of about 60°C.<br>
The concentration of the halide of formula II is generally comprised<br>
between 50 and 90 g/l, preferably between 60 and 80 g/l, Advantageously, it is<br>
of about 70 g/l.<br>
The supported catalyst is generally used in a weight by weight (w : w)<br>
ratio, in respect of the halide of formula II, comprised between 0.4:1 and<br>
0.01:1, advantageously between 0.2:1 and 0.05:1, preferably of about 0.1:1.<br>
After removal of the catalyst, 5-formylphmalide (I) is isolated according to<br>
the known techniques, for example by evaporating the solvent, taking up the<br>
residue with a suitable solvent and crystallizing, or by diluting the reaction<br>
mixture with a suitable solvent and recovering the precipitated product.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, 5-formylphthalide (I) is<br>
prepared in a sufficiently pure state for its use as intermediate, and in<br>
satisfactory global yields, generally higher than 60%.<br>
According to its preferential aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
process for the preparation of the 5-formylphthalide (I) which comprises<br>
submitting the 5-chlorocarbonyl phthalide, dissolved in N,N-<br>
dimethylacetamide, to hydrogenation in the presence of 5% Pd/BaSO4 the<br>
catalyst : 5-chlorocarbonylphthalide (w : w) ratio being of about 0.1:1, at a<br>
pressure of 3 bar and at a temperature of 60°C.<br>
The isolation conditions are those illustrated hereinabove.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without, however, limiting<br>
1H-NMR spectra have been registered by a Varian 300 MHz spectrometer<br>
in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
(a) 5-Chlorocarbonylphthalide<br>
To a mixture of 1800 ml of thionyl chloride and 8.1 ml of N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide, 750 g (4.21 moles) of 5-carboxyphthalide are added under<br>
stirring. The mixture is heated slowly to reach an inner temperature of 60°C in<br>
one hour, then it is kept at this temperature for another hour and finally it is<br>
brought to the reflux. After refluxing for 6 hours, about 600 ml of thionyl<br>
chloride are distilled off at a temperature of 80¸85°C, by replacing them by<br>
addition of toluene. Distillation is continued for a total of 2800 ml with<br>
concurrent replacement of the solvent by addition of 3800 ml of toluene. The<br>
mixture is slowly cooled and, at 80°C, the crystallization of the product begins.<br>
Cool to 10¸15°C by continuing stirring for 15 hours. The hygroscopic product<br>
is filtered, washing with a total of 1500 ml of toluene, then it is dried under<br>
vacuum at 55°C to give 710 g (86%) of 5-chlorocarbonylphthalide with a<br>
purity of 99% (HPLC).<br>
(b) 5-Formylphthalide : hydrogenation in N,N-dimethylacetamide<br>
In a hydrogenator, 23 1 of N,N-dimethylacetamide, 1.65 Kg (8.39 moles) of<br>
5-chloro carbonylphthalide and 200 g of 5% Pd/BaSO4 are charged, then<br>
hydrogen is charged at 3 bar thereinto and the mixture is heated at 60±3oC for<br>
a total of 48 hours. The mixture is cooled and, after removal of the catalyst by<br>
filtration, concentrated under vacuum at 75°C to a solid residue. The product is<br>
treated with 8 1 of deionized water and, at 5¸10°C under stirring, the pH of the<br>
mixture is adjusted to 7.0¸7.5 by addition of 2.3 1 of 10% ammonium<br>
hydroxide solution. After a 30-minute stirring, the product is filtered, washed<br>
with deionized water and dried under vacuum at 50°C to give 885 g (65%) of<br>
desired product having m.p. = 163¸165°C (in J. Chem. Soc. 1925, page 2290 a<br>
m.p. = 159¸160°C is given).<br>
1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) d ppm : 5.51 (s, 2H, CH2O), 8.00¸8.12 (m, 2H,<br>
arom.), 8.18 (s,.lH, arom.), 10-17 (s, 1H, CHO).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
5-Formylphthalide: hydrogenation in N,N-dimethylacetamide<br>
To a solution of 8,58"g (0.043 mole) of 5-chlorocarbonylphthalide in 120<br>
ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide in a hydrogenator 1 g of 5% Pd/BaSO4 is added<br>
and hydrogen at 2.5 bar is charged thereinto. The mixture is heated to 60°C,<br>
kept at this temperature for 40 hours at 2.5¸3 bar, then cooled, filtered to<br>
remove the catalyst and concentrated under vacuum at 75°C. The residue is<br>
taken up with 50 ml of deionized water, then the suspension is neutralized with<br>
10% ammonium hydroxide solution to a pH = 7.5 and the product is filtered to<br>
give 4.4 g (63%) of 5-fomylphthatide with m.p. = 162¸163°C.<br>
The mixture qumoline-sulfur used to partially inactivate the catalyst in the<br>
following comparative examples has been prepared according to Org. Synth.<br>
Coll. 3,627.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Comparative example: hydrogenation in toluene<br>
In a hydrogenator a mixture of 7 g (0.036 mole) of 5-<br>
chlorocarbonylphthalide, 50 ml of toluene, 0.1 ml of the quinoline/sulfur<br>
mixture and 0.7 g of previously reduced 5% Pd/BaSO4 is charged. The mixture<br>
is hydrogenated at 80°C under 3.5 bar for 7 hours. At this point the reaction no<br>
longer proceeds because of the co-precipitation of the formed product. Thus, it<br>
is stopped and the mixture is filtered in the warm in order to put the product<br>
into solution again. A second amount of 0.7 g of 5% Pd/BaSO4 is added to the<br>
filtrate and the hydrogenation starts again under the above described<br>
conditions. After 15 minutes, no more absorption of hydrogen is observed.<br>
Hydrogenation is stopped and the catalyst is filtered off in the warm. After<br>
cooling, the solution is concentrated under vacuum to a residue which is taken<br>
up with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with a 5% aqueous solution<br>
of NaHCO3, concentrated to a little volume and the separated product is<br>
filtered. There is obtained 4.2 g of 5-formylphthaIide with a purity (HPLC)<br>
42% (yield 30%).<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Comparative example: hydrogenation in tetrahydrqfuran<br>
A mixture of 7 g (0.036 mole) of 5-chlorocarbonylphthalide, 50 ml of<br>
tetrahydrofuran, 0.1 ml of the quinoline/sulfbr mixture and 1 g of 10% Pd/C is<br>
hydrogenated at 3.5 bar and 35¸40°C for 3 hours. After 3 hours a stoppage of<br>
the hydrogen absorption is observed. Thus, the mixture is cooled, diluted with<br>
dichloromethane, filtered, and by a HPLC control the presence of equivalent<br>
amounts of alcohol and aldehyde is observed. The mixture is concentrated<br>
tinder vacuum and the residue is taken up with ethyl acetate. The crystalline<br>
product is filtered and dried to obtain 4 g of 5-formylphthalide with a purity<br>
(HPLC) = 44% (yield 30%).<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Comparative example: hydrogenatian in dioxane<br>
In a hydrogenator, 8,2 g (0.042 mole) of 5-chlorocarbonylphthalide, 50 ml<br>
of dioxane and 0.77 g of 5% Pd/BaSO4 are charged and the mixture is<br>
hydrogenated at 4 bar and 70oC for 7 hours. After this period of time, the<br>
reaction no longer proceeds because of the co-precipitation of the formed<br>
product; thus, the hydrogenation is stopped, the mixture is diluted with 120 ml<br>
of tetrahydrofuran and stirred at 40°C for 20 minutes. The solid is filtered off<br>
and the solution is concentrated to a little volume. The crystalline product is<br>
recovered by filtration and dried to give 33 g of 5-formylphthalide with a<br>
purity (HPLC) = 82% (yield 40%).<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Use of 5-formylphthalide for the preparation of citalopram hydrobromide<br>
(a) To a suspension of 35 g (0.216 mole) of 5-formylphthalide in 800 ml of<br>
dichloro methane, 800 ml of a solution of 65.4 g of triphenylmethoxyamine<br>
(0.25 mole) in 350 ml of dichloromethane are added in 45 minutes. After about<br>
2 hours at 25¸27°C, the obtained solution is concentrated under vacuum to a<br>
volume of about 100 ml, whereby the crystallization of the product begins. A<br>
volume of 200 ml of methanol is added to the mixture, which is concentrated<br>
again to a little volume, then it is diluted with further 300 ml of methanol and<br>
let to stand at 20¸25oC for 2 hours to complete the crystallization. A further<br>
volume of 700 ml of methanol is added to the think<br>
methanol and dried under vacuum at 40°C to give 75.2 g of O-triphenylmethyl-<br>
2-oxo-l,3-dihydro-5-isobeanzo furancarbaldoxime with m.p. = 203¸206°C and<br>
purity (HPLC) = 95.1%. From the mother liquors, by concentration to a little<br>
volume, further 10.9 g of product having a purity of 98.2% are recovered Total<br>
yield: 86.1 g (90%).<br>
lH-NMR (CDC13) d ppm : 5.23 (s, 2H, CH2O), 7.22-7.40 (m, 15H, arom.,<br>
triphenylmethyl), 7.58 (m, 1H, arom., phthalide), 7.83 (d, 1H, arom.,<br>
phthalide), 838 (s, 1H, CH=N).<br>
(b) To a solution of 25 g (0.06 mole) of O-triphenylmethyl-2-oxo-l,3-<br>
dihydro-5-isobenzo furancarbaldoxime in 125 ml of tetrahydrofuran, 92.8 ml<br>
of a 14.5% solution of 4-fluoro pnenylmagnesium bromide in tetrahydrofuran<br>
are slowly added in 3 hours and a half, at 15°C and under nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
After a control by HPLC to verify that the unreacted starting material is lower<br>
than 2% (area), the mixture is slowly cooled to 10°C, then 65 ml of a 30%<br>
solution of [3-(dimemylamino)propy]magnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran<br>
are slowly added at 5¸10°C thereinto. After a HPLC control showing that the<br>
content in diol is of 23.1 g, 1400 g of a 15% aqueous solution of ammonium<br>
chloride is added at 5¸10°C to the mixture under stirring. Said mixture is<br>
stirred for 30 minutes, then the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is<br>
extracted with 150+130 ml of toluene, the organic phase is concentrated and<br>
the residue is finally taken up with 200 ml of toluene. The toluene phases are<br>
collected, treated with 200 ml of deionized water and the pH is adjusted to 3.0<br>
by addition of acetic acid. The phases are separated and the organic one is<br>
extracted with a mixture of 120 ml of acetic acid and 190 ml of deionized<br>
water. The aqueous phase containing the diol in form of its salt is collected<br>
and, under stirring, 300 ml of toluene are added thereinto, then the pH of the<br>
mixture is brought to about 10 by addition of 30% aqueous ammonium<br>
hydroxide. The phases are separated, the organic one is collected and the<br>
aqueous phase is extracted with 2 x 60 ml of toluene. The collected toluene<br>
phases are washed with 3 x 60 ml of deionized water. The organic phase is<br>
concentrated under vacuum at about 50°C and 27.2 g (75%) of O-<br>
fluorobenzyl]benzaldoxime as a light yellow product with a purity (HPLC) =<br>
94.5% are obtained.<br>
1H-NMR (CDCl3) d ppm : 1.45¸1.75 (2m, 2H, CH2-CN), 4.07 and 4.31<br>
(2d, 2H, CH2O), 6,92 (pseudo t, 2H, H in ortho to F), 7.20¸7.40 (m, 20H,<br>
arom), 8.22 (s,1H, CH=CN).<br>
(c) To a solution of 23.3 g (0.039 mole) of O-triphenylmethyl-3-<br>
hydroxymethyl-4-[a-hydroxy-a-3-(dimethylamino)propyl-4-<br>
fluorobenzyl]benzaldoxime in 260 ml of dichloro methane, 25.5 ml of<br>
triethylamine are added. The mixture is cooled to 5°C and a solution of 6 ml of<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride in 300 ml of dichloromethane are slowly (in 3 hours)<br>
added thereinto, by keeping the temperature at 5¸7°C. After a control by<br>
HPLC showing a content in diol lower than 2%, 230 ml of 0.1N NaOH are<br>
added to the reaction mixture, by maintaining its temperature at 0¸5°C. The<br>
phases are separated, the organic phase is washed three times with a mixture of<br>
200 ml of deionized water and 25 ml of a 20% solution of sodium chloride.<br>
The aqueous phase is discarded, the organic one is collected and concentrated<br>
under vacuum to a solid residue. Thus, 22.3 g (97%) of O-triphenyhnethyl-1-<br>
[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbaldoxime as a pale yellow product with purity (HPLC) =<br>

(d) A mixture of 640 ml of acetic anhydride and 220 ml of 98% formic acid<br>
is heated one hour at 110°C, then it is cooled to 60°C and 17.6 g (0.03 mole) of<br>
O-triphenyhnethyl-1 -[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l -(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-<br>
dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbaldoxime are added thereinto. The obtained<br>
mixture is heated at 120°C for 5 hours. After a HPLC control showing a<br>
conversion into citalopram of 88.2% (area), the mixture is concentrated under<br>
vacuum at 60°C to an oil which is taken up with 170 ml of ethyl acetate and<br>
addition of about 10 ml of 10% HC1. The phases are separated, the aqueous one<br>
is extracted with 170 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phases are discarded and<br>
the pH of the aqueous phase is brought to 8.5 by addition of about 45 ml of<br>
10% aqueous ammonium hydroxide; 90 ml of toluene are added thereinto and<br>
the mixture is kept under stirring for 2 hours. The phases are separated and the<br>
aqueous one is extracted with 3 x 100 ml of toluene. The toluene phases are<br>
collected and concentrated under vacuum at 50°C to a solid residue which is<br>
taken up with 35 ml of dichloromethane and loaded on a SiO2 column by<br>
eluting with a dichloromethane/methanol = 9/1 mixture. By concentration of<br>
the eluate, 7.1 g (73%) of citalopram base with purity (HPLC) = 98.2% is<br>
obtained.<br>
(e) To a solution of 7.1 g of citalopram base in 35 ml of dichloromethane a<br>
solution of 7 g of sodium metabisulphite in 25 ml of deionized water is added.<br>
The pH of the mixture is brought to 6.0 by addition of 5% aqueous ammonium<br>
hydroxide, then the organic phase is discarded, the aqueous one is brought to<br>
pH = 7.0 by addition of sodium bicarbonate and extracted with 2 x 10 ml of<br>
toluene. The organic extracts are concentrated under vacuum at 50°C to give<br>
6.9 g of citalopram base with purity (HPLC) = 99.8% (area). These 6.9 g of<br>
citalopram base are dissolved in 30 ml of acetone and 48% HBr is added to the<br>
solution to a pH of 4¸5. The obtained solution is evaporated under vacuum at<br>
45°C and the residue is crystallized with acetone to give 5.6 g of citalopram<br>
hydrobromide with purity (HPLC) = 99.4% (area) and m.p. 185¸187°C.<br>
