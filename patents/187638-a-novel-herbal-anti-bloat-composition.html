A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A HERBAL AN1TBLOAT COMPOSITION<br>
Excessive accumulation of gases within the rumen ( bloat, meteorism, hoven) is a major problem of ruminants the world over. Accumulation of gases within the rumen is normally relieved by belching or eructation. Sometimes, the gases cannot escape because they are . imprisoned within the ingesta, the avenue of escape is blocked and or the nonmotile rumen does not aid in eructation. Bloat usually accompanies rumen stasis but it may also occur alone. Severe bloat can lead to rumen stasis from overdistention of the reticulo-ruminal musculature.<br>
Recent work indicates that bloating is a failure to expel gas in a normal manner, rather than a problem of excessive gas production. Gases produced in the rumen are primarily carbon dioxide and methane. Small amounts of other gases, including oxygen, may be present, but the ruminal condition is essentially anaerobic. Some of the ruminal gas is absorbed into the blood stream and eliminated through the lungs, but most ruminal gas is expelled by belching or eructation.<br>
Plants having potent antifiatulent and antibloat properties were selected and screened as per the Indian Pharmacopoeia, 1996. From results of the preliminary screening the most potent plants were short listed and several prototype combinations were developed. Each of these were further evaluated in - vitro using the above cited method as well as using ruminal liquor, in - vitro and the final composition was finally selected . The present invention ( composition) was arrived at by blending the ingredients in a specific ratio so as to obtain maximum synergistic activity, therefore, the novelty of the invention resides not only in the composition itself, but also in the<br><br><br><br><br>
1 ne present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel anti-bloat herbal composition.<br>
Bloat is a common ailment in ruminants and other livestock. It can threaten the life of the animal if left unattended or neglected. It is a matter of major medical and economic concern. A bloat may be either gaseous - in the form of free gas separated from the ingesta, or frothy bloat due to production of stable and persistent foam mixed with the rumen contents followed by non-eructation of the gas. Fatality often results in such cases due to lack of timely effective treatment.<br>
Unsystematic, irregular feeding habits and a drastic change from regular kind of diet also leads to flatulent conditions. The stomach feels bloated and distended and results in a " disturbed, restless, uncomfortable" stage. Indigestion and loss of appetite often accompany it. The present invention counteracts flatus by different routes. The ingredients of the composition are so chosen, that they immediately and actively act against froth/foam formation in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Bloat occurs when gases enter the gastrointestinal tract from three sources, namely swallowed air, gases formed as a result of bacterial action, and gases that diffuse from the blood into the gastrointestinal tract. Most gases in The stomach are generally nitrogen and oxygen. In addition, considerable carbon dioxide often occurs because the reaction between acidic gastric juice and bicarbonate in pancreatic juice is sometimes too rapid for the liberated carbon dioxide to be absorbed.<br>
A very large number of domestic animals are usually met with Tympanitis and this situation is prevalent in all seasons. The animals usually affected are the cows and buffaloes. The disease in live stock can affect the nutrition and economy of a family, a village or a nation. Hence there is an important link between the health of live stock and well being of a country.<br>
Tympanitis or bloat is an emergency condition wherein sometimes the veterinarian or farmer drills hole in the abdomen to release the gas or froth from the stomach of the animal. If not attended immediately to this condition, the animal may die because of excessive pressure on other vital organs like lungs, heart etc.<br>
To meet the needs of the animals and increase the live stock production, a need was felt to develop the present invention comprising a blend of extracts and distillates obtained from certain plants like<br><br>
Mentha spicata and Ferula asqfoelida. A list of most effective plants known for anti-froth, carminative and stomachic activities was prepared and these were then blended in synergistic combinations and ratio and evaluated through clinical trials. These plants were selected after a thorough literature study followed by experiments on individual plants and their extracts under laborites conditions and finally the present invention was arrived. It is found to be effective in conditions like gaseous and frothy bloat. The present invention is highly effective and safe.<br>
Very few synthetic products are available for this condition and more over most of these products are not effective in treating the condition effectively and safely.<br>
The present invention comprises taking exudate of Ferula asqfoetida, cleaning, drying it in the open and powdering it to a sieve size of 20-30. This powder is then subjected to extraction by means of an appropriate technique like percolation, refluxation, soxhlet extraction. The extract obtained is filtered through a filter fabric to obtain extract.<br>
Leaves and dried flowering heads of Mentha spicata are taken, cleaned and extracted by using suitable solvents. The distillate thus obtained is separated from its solvent and then used in this composition..<br>
According to the present invention, the process for preparation of a herbal anti-bloat composition comprises:<br>
a)	taking the exudate of Ferula asqfoetida, cleaning and drying in an open atmosphere and powdering it to a seive size of 20-30 and extracted with suitable solvents to obtain the extract.<br>
b)	taking the leaves and dried flowers of Mentha spicata and extracting it with a suitable solvents to obtain the distillate.<br>
c)	the two concentrated extracts and distillates thus obtained are mixed in the following ratio along with preservatives, emulsifiers and LP. grade water.<br><br>
1.	Distillates from Mentha spicata equivalent to	80-1 OOgm<br>
2.	Extracts from Ferula asafoetida	0.3-0.6 gm<br>
d). suitable preservatives, emulsifiers are added to the above said extracts and distillates resulting in the desired anti-bloat composition.<br><br>
Mentha spicata: is a herb found distributed all over India belonging to the family Labiatae and is commonly called Pudina. Its leaves are bitter and are used for culinary purpose. The leaves and flowering branch contain an essential oil, which contains an active principle called 'Carvone'. It is widely used as an appetiser, digestive, carminative and stimulant. It removes flatulence. Its chemical structure is given in figure 1 (enclosed in drawing sheet)<br>
Ferula asafoetida: the exudate of Ferula asafoetida is commonly used for culinary purposes. . It is a valuable stimulant acting on the organs of circulation and secretion, also a nervine and pulmonary stimulant and powerful anti-spasmodic It is also a carminative, tonic, laxative, diuretic, emmenogogue and anthelmentic. It is recommended in dyspepsia, colic and other gastric affections. It relieves gaseous indigestion. It has been highly recommended for Tympanitis.<br>
Ferulic acid is widely distributed in small amount in plants. But it is found in Asafoetida, the milk sap of the roots of Ferula asafoetida (Umbelliferae).<br>
It occurs in cis and trans form. The cis form is a yellow oily liquid whereas the trans form gives orthorhombic needles from water, which has a melting point of 1740C. It is soluble in hot water, alcohol and ethylacetate. Its chemical structure is given in figure 2 (enclosed in drawing sheet)<br>
It is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-hepatotoxic, anti-oestrogenic and anti-tumor activities. It stimulates phagocytosis and inhibits platelet aggregation in-vitro. It acts as a serotonin antagonist and has anti-yeast activity. It is used as a food preservative.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
a). The present invention comprises taking the distillate of Mentha spicata. The distillates of Mentha spicata is taken in the ratio of 80-100gms and added to the suitable emulsifier in the ratio of 1-4% w/w and mixing it gradually to LP. grade water at 30-35% w/w to obtain the emulsified mixture.<br>
b).

Then it is made up to 100% w/w using I. P. grade water.<br><br>
The present invention is a very potent anti-flatulent, anti-bloat composition, which relieves the suffering animal swiftly from distress, and restores the digestive functions and production. Its mode of action is as follows:<br>
a)	It breaks the froth by reducing viscosity of ruminal fluid and thus relieves frothy bloat.<br>
b)	It reduces surface tension in the froth. This is because of low hydrophobic- lipophilic balance (HLB) value of the product.<br>
c)	Its spasmolytic action alleviates smooth muscle passion precipitated by accumulated gas in the intestinal tract.<br>
d)	Rumenatoric action of the invention accelerates the rumeno-reticular contractions to help eructation of the gas and also relieves impaction.<br>
e)	Its antizymotic properties controls excessive fermentation.<br>
f)	The antacid action of the composition helps overcome acid indigestion and maintains normal ruminal pH. The composition contains potent digestive and carminative ingredients, which help in expulsion of gas from large intestine and rumen thereby relieving flatulent colic.<br>
The present invention therefore offers timely and comprehensive treatment for both frothy and gaseous bloat and restores normal digestion and production quickly.<br><br><br>
