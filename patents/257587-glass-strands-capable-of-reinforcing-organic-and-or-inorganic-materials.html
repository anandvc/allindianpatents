				<td>GLASS STRANDS CAPABLE OF REINFORCING ORGANIC AND/OR<br>
INORGANIC MATERIALS<br>
The present invention relates to glass strands or fibres, especially<br>
those intended for reinforcing organic and/or inorganic materials and able to be<br>
used as textile strands, these strands being able to be produced by a process<br>
consisting in mechanically attenuating streams of molten glass emanating from<br>
orifices placed at the base of a bushing, generally heated by resistance heating.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to glass strands having a<br>
particularly advantageous novel composition.<br>
The field of glass reinforcement strands is one particular field of the<br>
glass industry. These strands are produced from specific glass compositions,<br>
the glass used having to be able to be attenuated into the form of filaments a<br>
few microns in diameter, using the process described above, and having to<br>
allow the formation of strands capable in particular of fulfilling their<br>
reinforcement role. The glass reinforcement strands most commonly used are<br>
thus strands formed from glasses whose composition derives from the eutectic<br>
composition of the SiO2-AI2O3-CaO ternary diagram, the liquidus temperature of<br>
which is 1170°C. These strands are referred to by the name of «E-glass »<br>
strands, the archetype of which is described in the patent publications US-A-2<br>
334 981 and US-A-2 571 074, which strands have a composition essentially<br>
based on silica, alumina, lime and boric anhydride. The latter compound,<br>
present with contents ranging in practice from 5 to 13% in glass compositions<br>
for "E-glass", is added as a replacement for silica so as to reduce the liquidus<br>
temperature of the glass formed and to make it easier for the glass to melt. The<br>
term "liquidus temperature", denoted by T|iq, is the temperature at which, in a<br>
system in thermodynamic equilibrium, the most refractory crystal appears. The<br>
liquidus temperature therefore gives the lower limit at which it is possible to<br>
fiberize the glass. E-glass strands are furthermore characterized by a limited<br>
content of alkali metal oxides (essentially Na2O and/or K2O).<br>
Since the two abovementioned patent applications, glasses comprising<br>
these constituents have undergone numerous modifications with the purpose of<br>
reducing emanations of products liable to pollute the atmosphere, of reducing<br>
the cost of the composition by decreasing the content of the most expensive<br><br>
constituents, of improving the capability of these glasses to undergo fiberizing<br>
(fiberizing or forming corresponding to the operation of attenuating the glass<br>
filaments coming from a bushing using the process described above), especially<br>
by reducing their viscosity at high temperatures and their tendency to devitrify,<br>
or finally of improving one particular property intended to increase their<br>
performance (or to make them suitable) for certain applications.<br>
Solutions for greatly reducing polluting emanations have consisted in<br>
eliminating the most volatile elements from the compositions, these being boric<br>
anhydride and fluorine. Decreasing the boric anhydride content is also a means<br>
of reducing the cost of the compositions. The elimination of boric anhydride and<br>
fluorine in the compositions of these glasses is generally to the detriment of<br>
their fiberizability and their processing in order to obtain reinforcement strands,<br>
which generally becomes more difficult or tricky, possibly requiring modifications<br>
to existing fiberizing installations.<br>
The publication US-A-3 847 626 describes and claims compositions in<br>
which these elements have been replaced with high contents of titanium oxide,<br>
ranging from 3 to 5%, and with magnesia, contents ranging from 1.5 to 4%.<br>
These two oxides make it possible to compensate for the absence of boron and<br>
fluorine, making the glasses formed from these compositions suitable for<br>
fiberizing. However, the yellow coloration conferred by such levels of titanium<br>
tends to exclude this type of composition for certain applications. High titanium<br>
oxide contents, ranging from 2 to 4%, are also recommended in Application US-<br>
A-4 026 715, this constituent generally being added together with divalent<br>
oxides such as SrO, ZnO or BaO, which furthermore have the disadvantage of<br>
being expensive.<br>
Application US-A-4 199 364 describes compositions having high lithium<br>
oxide contents. Apart from its high cost, lithium oxide forms part of the alkali<br>
metal oxides, which are known to degrade the capability of the fibres to<br>
reinforce electronic circuit substrates.<br>
Application WO 96/39362 describes compositions containing neither<br>
boron nor fluorine, which are essentially formed from the SiO2-AI2O3-CaO-MgO<br>
quaternary system, containing small amounts of titanium oxide (less than 0.9%)<br>
and generally containing no additions of expensive oxides such as those<br><br>
described in the aforementioned applications. However, these glasses have a<br>
liquidus temperature and a forming temperature that are relatively high.<br>
In the field of glass strands obtained by mechanical attenuation of<br>
molten glass streams, the term "forming temperature" is the temperature for<br>
which the glass possesses a viscosity of 1000 poise (decipascals.second),<br>
around which viscosity the glass must be fiberized. This temperature, denoted<br>
T|0g3, corresponds more particularly to the temperature of the glass at the<br>
bushing nipples. The temperature of the glass on entering the bushing<br>
corresponds to a viscosity of the order of 102 5 poise, and is denoted by T|0g2.5.<br>
To avoid any risk of devitrification during forming, the "fiberizing range",<br>
denoted by AT and defined as the difference between the forming temperature<br>
and the liquidus temperature, must be positive and preferably greater than<br>
50°C.<br>
High values of these various temperatures require the glass to be<br>
maintained at high temperatures both during the conditioning of the glass and in<br>
the fiberizing device itself.<br>
This drawback results in an additional cost due to the additional supply<br>
of heat needed to condition the glass and to more frequent renewal of the<br>
fiberizing tools, especially the parts made of platinum, the ageing of which is<br>
greatly accelerated by the increase in temperature.<br>
More recently, several applications have also disclosed compositions<br>
for obtaining low-cost glasses, which possess liquidus and forming<br>
temperatures close to those of E-glass, therefore allowing them to be fiberized<br>
more easily.<br>
Thus, Patent Publications WO 99/12858 and WO 99/01393 describe<br>
glass compositions containing small amounts of fluorine or boron oxide. In<br>
WO 00/73232, the lowering of the characteriztic temperatures is achieved by<br>
compositions having a low MgO content (less than 1%) and by the addition of a<br>
certain amount of boron oxide or lithium oxide or zinc oxide or even manganese<br>
oxide, thereby lessening the economic advantage of these compositions.<br>
WO 00/73231 discloses compositions whose liquidus temperature is lowered,<br>
especially thanks to the addition of MgO within a narrow range of contents,<br>
between 1.7 and 2.6%. Most of the compositions exemplified in the above<br>
application furthermore include an oxide chosen from boron oxide, lithium oxide,<br><br><br>
zinc oxide or even manganese oxide. The reduction in characteriztic<br>
temperatures of the process can also be achieved, in WO 01/32576, by the low<br>
silica content (less than 58%) of the compositions, and in WO 02/20419, by<br>
selecting compositions whose silica content/alkaline-earth metal content ratio is<br>
less than 2.35.<br>
The objectives pursued by the various inventions mentioned were<br>
mainly to reduce the cost of the compositions and to reduce the amount of<br>
environmentally harmful materials discharged. The use of fibres for certain<br>
applications has also dictated the choice of very specific compositions. Thus,<br>
three properties may be particularly sought after: acid resistance, resistance at<br>
high temperatures and high mechanical strength, especially tensile strength, of<br>
the fibres. The first property is particularly desired in applications of reinforcing<br>
organic and/or inorganic materials which come into contact with an acid<br>
medium, for example in the chemical industry. The second property is of<br>
paramount importance when the glass strands are used for example in exhaust<br>
systems for motor vehicles. The third property is sought when the materials<br>
reinforced by the glass strands are subjected to high mechanical stresses.<br>
For each of these properties, particular compositions have been<br>
developed.<br>
Publications WO 03/050049 and WO 02/42233 describe glass fibres<br>
such that their composition makes them suitable for being employed in motor<br>
vehicle exhaust systems. In the first application, the objective is achieved<br>
thanks to a glass composition containing very small amounts (less than 1%) of<br>
MgO. These glasses also contain high contents (at least 1.5%) of titanium<br>
oxide. The second application describes glass compositions containing a<br>
particular range of alkaline-earth metal oxide contents. Many examples in this<br>
application are glasses that contain barium oxide or strontium oxide. Document<br>
FR-A-2 804 107 describes fibres having a particular composition, the<br>
high-temperature resistance property of which stems from a treatment of their<br>
surface for the purpose of obtaining an extremely silica-enriched surface<br>
composition.<br>
Application FR-A-2 692 248 describes and claims glass compositions<br>
which behave, during melting and during fiberizing, in a manner similar to<br>
E-glass, but which possess a markedly superior acid resistance, especially<br><br><br>
thanks to the reduction in boric anhydride and alumina contents. Nevertheless,<br>
the glasses claimed do possess a boric anhydride content of greater than 2%.<br>
The above examples show that specific compositions have been<br>
developed in order to meet certain technical, economic or environmental<br>
constraints but that the optimization of a single range of compositions, allowing<br>
all of these constraints to be met, which from the industrial standpoint is highly<br>
desirable, remains to be accomplished.<br>
One object of the present invention is therefore to propose glass<br>
compositions of advantageously low cost which exhibit good formability and<br>
make it possible to obtain glass strands having high-temperature resistance,<br>
acid resistance and mechanical strength properties that are significantly<br>
improved over those of E-glass or over certain currently available glasses.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose glass compositions which,<br>
when they are being melted, give off little emanation liable to damage the<br>
environment.<br>
These objects are achieved thanks to glass strands whose composition<br>
comprises the following constituents in the limits defined below, expressed as<br>
percentages by weight:<br><br>
Silica is an oxide acting as a glass network former, and plays an<br>
essential role in stabilizing the glass. Within the limits defined above, when the<br>
percentage of this constituent is less than 58%, the glass obtained is not<br>
viscous enough and it devitrifies too easily during fiberizing. For contents above<br><br>
63%, the glass becomes very viscous and difficult to melt. Consequently, the<br>
silica content is preferably less than 62% and particularly preferably less than<br>
61%. Since silica plays an essential beneficial role in acid corrosion resistance,<br>
its content is preferably greater than 59%, and even strictly greater than 60%.<br>
Silica contents strictly greater than 60%, but not exceeding 63%, are thus<br>
preferred, in particular, but not exclusively, when there is a non-zero boron<br>
oxide content.<br>
Alumina also constitutes a network former in the glasses according to<br>
the invention and plays a fundamental role in their stability. Within the limits<br>
defined according to the invention, a content of less than 10% causes a<br>
substantial increase in the hydrolytic attack of the glass, whereas increasing the<br>
content of this oxide to above 16% runs the risk of devitrification and an<br>
increase in the viscosity. Owning to its deleterious effect on the acid corrosion<br>
properties, the alumina content is preferably maintained below 15% or even<br>
14%. The greatest resistance to devitrification is obtained for alumina contents<br>
of between 11 and 14%, preferably between 12 and 13%.<br>
Lime and magnesia make it possible to adjust the viscosity and control<br>
the devitrification of the glasses according to the invention. Within the limits<br>
defined according to the invention, a CaO content of 23% or higher results in an<br>
increase in the rates of devitrification to CaSiO3 (wollastonite) prejudicial to<br>
good fiberizing. The CaO content must therefore be maintained at a value<br>
strictly less than 23%. A CaO content of less than 16% results in too low a<br>
hydrolytic resistance. The CaO content is therefore preferably greater than<br>
18%, even greater than 20% or indeed 22% or higher. The MgO content,<br>
together with the lime content, makes it possible to obtain glasses of which the<br>
liquidus temperature is particularly low. This is because the addition of<br>
magnesia in defined contents makes it possible to introduce a competition<br>
between the growth of wollastonite and diopside (CaMgSi2O6) crystals, this<br>
having the effect of reducing the rate of growth of these two crystals, and<br>
therefore of giving good devitrification resistance. The MgO content is<br>
preferably maintained at 3% or lower, especially below 2.5%, but greater than<br>
1%, especially greater than 2%. For contents of 3.2% or higher, especially<br>
3.5%, the rate of crystallization of diopside becomes too great. For this reason,<br>
the MgO content of the glasses according to the invention is strictly less than<br><br>
3.5%, and especially 3.2% or lower. A particularly preferred range of values<br>
corresponds to MgO contents ranging from 2.2 to 2.8%. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the MgO content is more moderate, being particularly between 0.5<br>
and less than 2%.<br>
The alkali metal oxides may be introduced into the compositions of the<br>
glass strands according to the invention in order to limit devitrification and<br>
reduce the viscosity of the glass. However, the alkali metal oxide content must<br>
not exceed 2% in order to avoid an unacceptable increase in the electrical<br>
conductivity for applications in the electronics field and to avoid a detrimental<br>
reduction in the hydrolytic resistance of the glass. The lithium oxide content<br>
must especially be maintained below 0.4% and preferably below 0.1%. The<br>
inventors have demonstrated the extremely deleterious role of alkali metal<br>
oxides in the high-temperature resistance. This role is known in general, but<br>
within this particular context the effect on the reduction in characteriztic<br>
temperatures at which the glass softens, due to very low alkali metal oxide<br>
contents has turned out to be astonishingly great. The total content of alkali<br>
metal oxides therefore preferably does not exceed 1.5%, or even 1%.<br>
TiO2 plays a particularly important role in the glasses according to the<br>
invention. This oxide is known as a flow promoter for the glass and is capable of<br>
reducing the liquidus temperature, and thereby partially replacing boron oxide.<br>
The inventors have also demonstrated its surprising beneficial role as regards<br>
the high-temperature resistance properties, acid resistance properties and also<br>
tensile strength properties. For contents of 1.5% or higher, the yellow coloration<br>
and the additional cost that it generates unfortunately become unacceptable for<br>
many applications. The ultraviolet absorption due to the high titanium contents<br>
may also be unacceptable when the fibres are intended for reinforcing polymers<br>
that are crosslinked by means of UV radiation. Moreover, glasses containing<br>
titanium oxide contents of greater than 1.5% cannot benefit from the name<br>
"E-glass" as defined by the ASTM D578 standard. For these various reasons,<br>
the titanium oxide content of the glasses according to the invention is strictly<br>
less than 1.5% and preferably is equal to 1.4% or lower. To benefit from the<br>
advantages afforded by the presence of titanium oxide in the glasses according<br>
to the invention, its content is necessarily strictly greater than 1%, and<br>
preferably not less than 1.1%.<br><br><br>
Boric anhydride B2O3 may be advantageously added to the<br>
composition of the glasses according to the invention, in a moderate amount so<br>
as to facilitate the melting and forming of the glasses, but to the detriment of the<br>
cost of the composition. Boron may thus be introduced in a moderate amount,<br>
and inexpensively, by the incorporation, as batch material, of glass strand waste<br>
containing boron, for example E-glass strand waste. However, since the<br>
inventors have demonstrated its deleterious role on the acid corrosion<br>
resistance properties and the high-temperature resistance properties, the B2O3<br>
content preferably does not exceed 1%, and even more preferably does not<br>
exceed 0.5%. In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
B2O3 content is even less than 0.1%.<br>
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is used to reduce the viscosity of the glasses<br>
according to the invention and to increase their acid corrosion resistance.<br>
However, owing to the high cost of this oxide, its content is less than 0.4%,<br>
preferably less than 0.1%.<br>
The manganese oxide content is less than 1% and preferably less than<br>
0.3%. Since this oxide is liable to give the glass a very intensive violet<br>
coloration, the MnO content is preferably maintained below 0.1%.<br>
Fluorine may be added in a small amount in order to improve the<br>
melting of the glass, or it may be present as an impurity. However, it has been<br>
discovered that small amounts of fluorine affect the temperature resistance of<br>
the glasses according to the invention very markedly. The fluorine content is<br>
therefore advantageously maintained below 0.5% and especially below 0.1%.<br>
Iron oxide is an unavoidable impurity in the glasses according to the<br>
invention owing to its presence in several batch materials, and its content is<br>
generally less than 0.5%. Given that the coloration effect generally attributed to<br>
titanium is in fact due to electron transfer between Fe2+ and Ti4+ ions, the iron<br>
content in the glasses according to the invention is advantageously less than<br>
0.3%, especially less than 0.2%, thanks to a judicious choice of batch materials.<br>
One or more other components (differing from those already<br>
considered, i.e. different from Si02, Al203, CaO, MgO, Na20, K20, Li20, B203,<br>
Ti02, F, Fe203, ZnO, MnO) may also be present, generally as impurities, in the<br>
composition according to the invention, the total content of these other<br><br>
components remaining less than 1%, preferably less than 0.5%, the content of<br>
each of these other components generally not exceeding 0.5%.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the glass strands according to<br>
the invention contain small amounts of cobalt oxide intended to compensate for<br>
the yellow tint due to the titanium oxide. The preferred content of cobalt oxide<br>
(expressed in CoO form) lies between 10 and 100 ppm, especially between 15<br>
and 60 ppm, and advantageously between 15 and 50 ppm (i.e. between 0.0015<br>
and 0.0050%).<br>
The glass strands according to the invention may be produced and<br>
employed like E-glass strands. They are also less expensive and exhibit better<br>
temperature resistance, acid corrosion resistance and tensile strength.<br>
The glass strands according to the invention are obtained from glasses<br>
with the composition described above using the following process: a multiplicity<br>
of molten glass streams emanating from a multiplicity of orifices dispersed over<br>
the base of one or more bushings are attenuated into the form of one or more<br>
webs of continuous filaments, and then assembled into one or more strands<br>
that are collected on a moving support. This may be a rotating support when the<br>
strands are collected in the form of bound packages, or a support that moves<br>
translationally, when the strands are chopped by a member that also serves to<br>
attenuate them, or when the strands are sprayed by a member serving to<br>
attenuate them in order to form a mat.<br>
The strands obtained, optionally after other conversion operations, may<br>
thus be in various forms, namely continuous strands, chopped strands, braids,<br>
tapes, mats, networks, etc., these strands being composed of filaments with a<br>
diameter possibly ranging from 5 to 30 microns, approximately.<br>
The molten glass feeding the bushings is obtained from batch materials<br>
that may be pure (for example coming from the chemical industry) but are often<br>
natural, these batch materials sometimes containing impurities in trace amount<br>
and being mixed in appropriate proportions in order to obtain the desired<br>
composition, and then melted. The temperature of the molten glass (and<br>
therefore its viscosity) is conventionally set by the operator so as to allow the<br>
glass to be fiberized, while in particular avoiding problems of devitrification, and<br>
so as to obtain the best possible quality of the glass strands. Before they are<br>
assembled in the form of strands, the filaments are generally coated with a<br><br>
sizing composition for protecting them from abrasion and facilitating their<br>
subsequent association with materials to be reinforced.<br>
The composites obtained from the strands according to the invention<br>
comprise at least one organic material and/or at least one inorganic material<br>
and glass strands, at least some of the strands being glass strands according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Optionally, the glass strands according to the invention may have<br>
already been associated, for example during attenuation, with filaments of<br>
organic material so as to obtain composite strands. By extension, the<br>
expression "glass strands whose composition comprises ..." is understood to<br>
mean, according to the invention, "strands formed from filaments of glass<br>
whose composition comprises ...", the glass filaments being optionally<br>
combined with organic filaments before the filaments are assembled as strands.<br>
Owing to their good high-temperature resistance properties, the glass<br>
strands according to the invention may also be used for furnishing motor vehicle<br>
exhaust systems. In this particular application, the glass strands according to<br>
the invention give good acoustic insulation properties, but they are also<br>
exposed to temperatures that may exceed 850°C or even 900°C.<br>
The advantages afforded by the glass strands according to the<br>
invention will be more fully appreciated through the following examples, which<br>
illustrate the present invention without however limiting it.<br>
Table 1 gives four examples according to the invention, numbered 1 to<br>
4, and three comparative examples, numbered C1 to C3. C1 is a standard<br>
E-glass composition and C2 is a composition deriving from Patent Application<br>
WO 99/12858, while C3 is according to the teaching of Application<br>
WO 96/39362.<br>
The composition of the glasses is expressed as percentages of oxides<br>
by weight.<br>
To illustrate the advantages of the glass compositions according to the<br>
invention, Table 1 presents three fundamental properties:<br>
The temperature corresponding to a viscosity of 1025 poise, denoted by<br>
Ti0g2.5 and expressed in degrees Celsius, close to the temperature of<br>
the glass in the bushing;<br><br>
The softening temperature or Littleton softening point, corresponding to<br>
a viscosity of 1076 poise, denoted byT|0g7.6 and expressed in degrees<br>
Celsius, this value being indicative of the temperature resistance of the<br>
fibres, these two temperature values and their respective method of<br>
measurement being well known to those skilled in the art; and<br>
The value of the failure stress in three-point bending of composites<br>
based on vinyl ester resin (sold by Dow Chemical Company under the<br>
name Derakane 411-350) comprising a fibre volume fraction of 50%<br>
after immersion in a hydrochloric acid solution (HCI of 1N<br>
concentration) at room temperature for 100 hours. This stress is<br>
expressed in MPa and characterizes the resistance of the fibres to acid<br>
corrosion.<br><br><br>
As indicated in Table 1, the fibres according to the invention are very<br>
substantially superior to the E-glass fibres (Comparative Example C1) in terms<br>
of temperature resistance (the difference of about 100°C) and of acid corrosion<br>
resistance (a two to three times higher failure stress).<br>
For similar fiberizing conditions, the performance of the fibres<br>
according to the invention is also improved over the comparative examples C2<br>
and C3. The positive role of Ti02 on the thermal and acid resistance<br>
performance is particularly demonstrated by comparing Example 2 according to<br>
the invention with Comparative Example C3, the compositions of which differ<br>
mainly only in their titanium oxide content.<br>
Compared with Example 1, Examples 2, 3 and 4 illustrate the influence<br>
of certain oxides on the acid corrosion resistance of the fibres. For example,<br>
Example 2 illustrates the beneficial role of SiC&gt;2 and prejudicial role of AI2O3,<br>
whereas Examples 3 and 4 demonstrate the deleterious influence of boron<br>
oxide. The impact of the preferred silica contents of strictly greater than 60% is<br>
illustrated by comparing Examples 1 and 2, Example 2 having a markedly<br>
improved acid corrosion resistance.<br>
The glasses according to the invention therefore have significantly<br>
improved properties in terms of temperature resistance and acid corrosion<br>
resistance, while still retaining acceptable fiberizing properties.<br><br>
To illustrate the influence of cobalt oxide on the coloration of the giass<br>
strands according to the invention, and therefore on the coloration of organic<br>
materials reinforced by these strands, respective additions of 20, 40 and<br>
60 ppm of CoO were made in the composition of Example 2.<br>
Table 2 gives the colorimetric results obtained. The chromatic<br>
coordinates L*, a*, and b* were calculated from experimental spectra in<br>
transmission, taking as reference the illuminant D65 and the "CIE 1931"<br>
reference observer, such as defined by the ISO/CIE 10526 and 10527<br>
standards, respectively.<br><br>
A cobalt oxide content of between 20 and 40 ppm therefore makes it<br>
possible to obtain a colorimetric appearance similar to that obtained with the<br>
reference composition C1.<br><br>
