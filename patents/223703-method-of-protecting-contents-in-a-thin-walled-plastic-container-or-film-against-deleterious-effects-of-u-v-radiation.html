Method of Content Protection with Durable UV Absorbers<br>
The present invention relates to the protection of foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, personal care products, shampoos and the like from the deleterious effects of ultraviolet radiation. It has been found that certain highly durable benzotriazoles and tris-aryl-s-triazines are especially effective towards this end when incorporated in the containers or films in which such materials are stored.<br>
Many products such as certain fruit juices, soft drinks, beer, wines, food products, dairy products, cosmetics, shampoos, vitamins and pharmaceuticals are deleteriously affected, i.e. degraded, by the effects of ultraviolet (UV) light when packaged in plastic containers which allow the transmission of such light.<br>
The use of UV absorbers towards protecting bottle and film contents is well known. However there is a trend towards the use of clear or lightly colored containers. More aesthetically pleasing containers may be formed from clear plastics which also allow one to view the contents.  Unfortunately, clear and lightly colored containers and films allow the transmission of significant portions of ultraviolet light, i.e. light in the range of about 280 to about 400 nm. Further, there is a trend towards more light-weight and hence thinner walled containers. Thin-walled containers, by virtue of a shorter path length, will allow more UV light to pass. Due to these trends in packaging there is a need for more efficient UV absorbers for use in this area. UV absorber efficiency is a function of how strongly the molecule absorbs light across the entire UV region as well as its thermal and photostability, i.e. durability.<br>
Many cooking oils and salad oils are now offered in clear PET [poly(ethylene terephthalate}] packaging. Practically all vegetable or seed-based oils such as soybean, olive, safflower, cottonseed and corn oils contain varying levels of unsaturated olefinic acids or esters {e.g. linoleates) which are susceptible to light-induced degradation. Most plant based oils also contain natural chlorophyll or other pigment photosensitizers.  Pascal!, et al., J. FoodSci, 60 (5), 1116 (1995), discuss the UV protecUonof soybean oil with the use o( Tinuvtn® 326 incorporated into coextruded, multi-layered, polypropylene-based containers. Tinuvin® 326 is a benzothazole UV absorber, 5-chloro-2-{2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methyl-phenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp.<br><br>
Milk is packaged in translucent or white pigmented HOPE bottles to reduce the amount of light transmission through the plastic, Fanelli, et al.-, J. Food Protection, 48(2), 112-117 (1985) disclose that Tinuvin® 326 in HOPE packaging is effective at reducing the loss rate of Vitamin A in milk exposed to cool white fluorescent light.  Protection of vitamins is also of importance in fruit juices.  In Tropicana Twists Again," Packaging Worid, Jan. 1999, p,2, it is disclosed that PET bottles containing a "UV inhibitor" are used to protect the shelf life of Vitamin C in fruit drinks.<br>
The use of Tinuvin® 234, 2-(2-hydroxy-3,5-di-a-cumyl)-2H-benzotriazole, Tinuvin® 326, 5-chloro-2-(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, Tinuvin® 327, 5-chloro-2-(2-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, and Tinuvin® 1577, 4,6-diphenyi-2-(4-hexyloxy-2-hydroxyphenyl)-s-triazine, in packaging for content protection is known.  In particular, the combinations of Tinuvin® 234 with either Tinuvin® 327 or Tinuvin® 325 are known.<br>
It is well known that beer is normally bottled in amber or green-tinted glass to protect it from light. A highly efficient UV absorber would allow beer to be packaged in, for example, clear PET bottles,<br>
U.S, Patent Nos, 4,882,412, 4,892,923 and 4,950,732 disclose the use of 7-oxy-2H-1-benzopypran-2-one. 7-oxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-imine, 3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3-one, 3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3-imine and bis-methine moieties as UV absorbing groups to protect the contents of polyester and polycarbonate containers.<br>
U.S. Patent No, 5,948,458 teaches the protection of foods containing unsaturated lipids and fats from spoilage due to exposure to UV radiation by incorporation of calcium phosphate compounds either directly into the food product itself or in the food coatings and package wrap.<br>
It has been found that certain UV absorbers of the class of durable benzotriazoles and tris-aryl-s-triazines are especially effective towards protecting the contents of clear, lightly colored and thin-walled containers and films.<br><br>
The description, preparation and uses of the 2H-ben20triazoIe UV absorbers are described in United States Patent Nos. 3,004,896; 3,055,896; 3,072,585; 3,074,910; 3,189,615; 3,230,194; 4,127,586, 4,226,763; 4,278,589; 4,315,848; 4,383,863; 4,675,352; 4,681,905 and 4,853,471.<br>
United States Patent Nos. 5,319,091 and 5,410,071 described the preparation of benzotriazoles substituted at the 5-position of the benzo ring with alkyl- or aryl-sulfonyl moieties.  It is taught in United States Patent No. 5,280,124 that by introducing a higher alkyl or aryl sulfoxide or sulfone at the 5-position of the benzo ring of the benzotriazole, the resulting benzotriazole exhibits enhanced absorption in the near visible range (over 350 nm). Such sulfone substituted products were shown to be useful in automotive coatings applications.  U.S. Patent No. 5,977,219 teaches that an electron withdrawing moiety at the 5-pcsition of the benzo ring of the benzotriazole is advantageous for similar reasons. Additionally, this patent and copending application teach that such an electron withdrawing group dramatically increases the photostability of these benzotriazole UV absorbers in automotive coatings,  U.S. Patent No, 5,574,166 teaches that benzotriazoles with a cumyl group ortho to the phenol are especially thermally stable.  Surprisingly, these highly durable benzotriazoles are especially well-suited for the instant applications.<br>
,	United States Patent No. 3,218,332 discloses benzotriazoles substituted at the 5-<br>
position of the benzo ring by a lower alkyl sulfonyl moiety.  United States Patent Nos. 5,268,450 and 5,319,091 disclose polymer compositions and a process for the production of substituted aryl thio and aryl sulfonyl benzotriazoles which are covalently bound to polymers, such as poly(phenylene sulfide), RYTON®. Phillips Petroleum.  United States Patent No. 5,280,124 discloses benzotriazoles with only higher alkyl or aryl sulfinyi or sulfonyl moieties at the 5-position of the benzo ring which are useful for protecting thermoset automotive coatings,  U.S. Patent No. 5,977,219 and the copending patent application mentioned above teach the use of certain electron withdrawing groups including some sulfonyl groups at the 5-position of the benzo ring for the stabilization of automotive coatings.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 92-352228 discloses the use of 5-ethylsulfonyt benzotriazoles with the 3-position of the phenyl ring being unsubstituted or substituted by methyl for the UV protection of dust proof poly{vinyl chloride) resin films.<br><br>
The description, preparation and uses of the s-triazine UV absorbers are described for automotive coatings, photographic application, polymeric film coatings and ink jet printing. Automotive coatings are described in British 2,317,174A and 2,317,893A and in United States Patent Nos. 5,354,794;  5,556,973; 5,681,955;  5,726,309 and 5,106,891. Photographic applications are disclosed in United States Patent No, 3,843,371.  Polymenc film coatings are described in United States Patent Nos. 4,619,956 and 4,740,542.  Ink jet printing is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,096,489.  From each of these patents, the s-triazine UV absorbers are revealed as very photostable.<br>
The s-triazine UV absorbers can be prepared by the general synthetic procedures outlined in United States Patent Nos. 5.726,309; 5,681,955 and 5,556,973; British 2,317,714A, WO 96/28431 and EP 941989A2,<br>
It is knovi/n in the art that the concomitant use of a hindered amine light stabilizer with a UV absorbers such as benzotriazoles and s-triazines provide excellent stabilization in many polymer compositions as summarized by G, Berner and M. Rembold, "New Light Stabilizers for High Solids Coatings", Organic Coatings and Science and Technology, Vol. 6, Dekkar, New York, pp 55-85.<br>
Detailed Disclosure<br>
The instant invention pertains to plastic containers or films for content storage which protect the contents therein against the deleterious effects of ultraviolet radiation which comprise<br>
(a)	a clear or lightly colored plastic, and<br>
(b)	an effective stabilizing amount of one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of durable hydroxypheny! benzotriazole and tris-aryl-s-triazine UV absorbers.<br>
The instant invention also pertains to a method of protecting contents from the deleterious effects of ultraviolet radiation which comprises storage in the clear or lightly colored containers or films of the instant invention.<br><br>
Where the plastic of component (a) is lightly colored it is colored with pigments and/or dyes. Plastic containers and films made therefrom transmit significant portions of radiation of the ultraviolet region, i.e. about 280 to about 400 nm, Uftraviolet absorbers (UVA's) that are red-shifted absorb radiation towards the 400 nm region of the spectrum more efficiently than UVA's that are not red-shifted. Many of the present benzotrlazloes and s-triazines, in addition to being highly durable, are also red-shifted.<br>
The clear or lightly colored plastic of component (a) contains an upper limit of about 5 % pigments and/or dyes by weight, in total, based on the weight of the plastic. Preferably, the plastic of component (a) contains an upper limit of about 2 % by weight pigments and/or dyes based on the weight of the plastic.  Most preferably the upper limit of pigments and/or dyes in the plastic is about 1 % by weight.<br>
The UV absorbers of component (b) exhibit excellent compatibility with the plastic containers or films of this invention.  Further, they add little or no color to finished plastic containers or films.<br>
The contents to be protected by the compositions and methods of the instant invention include foodstuffs such as fruit juices, soft drinks, beer, wines, food products and dairy products, and personal care products, cosmetics, shampoos, vitamins, pharmaceuticals, inks, dyes and pigments.<br>
The plastic containers and films are rigid or flexible mono- and/or multi-layered packaging materials. The containers and films may be formed from polyesters, polyolefins, polyolefin copolymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate, polystyrene, poly{vinyl chloride), poly(vinyiic!ene chloride), polyamides, cellulosics, polycarbonates, ethylene-vinyl alcohol, poly(vinyl alcohol), styrene-acrylonitrile and ionomers and mixtures or multi-layers of these polymers.<br>
Typical multi-layer constructions have two or more layer laminates, manufactured either by thermoforming, or extrusion of multi-layer flexible films, or extrusion of bottle "preforms" or "parissons" followed by subsequent blow molding of the preforms into bottles.<br><br>
For both films and hgid packaging (bottles), typically the exterior layer, and innermost layer contacting the contents, are composed of polyesters such as PET or PEN [poly(ethylene naphthalate)], polypropylene, or polyethylene such as HOPE,  The middle layers, often called 'barrier' or 'adhesive' or 'tie' layers, are composed of one or more combinations of either PET, PEN. carboxylated polyethylene ionomer such as Surlyn®, vinyl alcohol homopolymers or copolymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol), partially hydrolyzed poly(vlnyl acetate), poiy{ethylene-co-viny) alcohol) such as EVOH or EVAL, nylons or polyamides such as Selar® (DuPont) or polyamides based on metaxylenediamine (sometimes called nylon MXD-6), or polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), or polyurethanes.  For packaging of meats and vegetables, where a controlled rate of 'respiration' or oxygen and moisture transport is desired, polystyrenes and celluloslcs are used as a packaging component.<br>
Optionally, the stabilizers of component (b) and optional further additives can be incorporated into coatings which are applied to the outer surface of e.g. rigid containers. Examples of exterior coatings include PVDC, or epoxies (such as Bairocace® technology and polyolefins used as "shrink wrap."<br>
The containers and films are primarily polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polyolefins such as polyethylene or polypropylene. Preferably they comprise PET or HOPE,  Where the packaging material is a multi-layer system, layers of any suitable plastic may be employed.<br>
The polyesters which may be used In the compositions of this invention include linear, thermoplastic, crystalline or amorphous polyesters produced by conventional polymerization techniques from one or more diols and one or more dicarboxylic acids. The polyesters normally are molding grade and have an inherent viscosity (I.V.) of about 0.4 to about 1.2. The preferred polyesters comphse at least about 50 mole percent terephthalic acid residues and at least about 50 mole percent ethylene glycol and/or 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol residues.  Particularly preferred polyesters are those containing from about 75 to 100 mole percent terephthalic acid residues and from about 75 to 100 mole percent ethylene glycol residues.<br>
The diol components of the deschbed polyesters may be selected from ethylene<br><br>
glycol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2,2-dimethyi-1,3-propanedio(, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,2-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-cydohexanediol, 1,2-cydohexanedimethanol, 1,3-cycfohexanedimethanol, X,8-bis(hydroxymethyl)-lricycio-[5,2.1.0]-decane wherein X represents 3, 4, or 5; and diols containing one or more oxygen atoms in the chain e.g., diethyiene glycol, triethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol and the like.  In general, these diols contain 2 to 18, preferably 2 tc 8 carbon atoms. Cycloaliphatic diols can be employed in their cis or trans configuration or as mixtures of both forms.<br>
The acid components (aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic dicarboxylic acids) of the linear polyester are selected, for example, from terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 1,3'Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, 1,12-dodecanedioic acid, 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylic acid and the like.  In the polymer preparation, it is often preferable to use a functional acid derivative tl^ereof such as the dimemyi, diethyl, or dipropyl ester of the dicarboxylic acid. The anhydrides or acid halides of these acids also may be employed where practical.<br>
The linear polyesters may be prepared according to procedures well known in the art. For example, a mixture of one or more dicarboxylic acids, preferably aromatic dicarboxylic acids, or ester forming derivatives thereof, and one or more diols may be heated in the presence of esterification and/or poly-esterification catalysts at temperatures in the range of 150° to 300°C and pressures of atmospheric to 0.2 mm Hg.  Normally, the dicarboxylic acid or dehvative thereof is esterified or transesterified with the diol{s) at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature at the lower end of the specified range.  Polycondensation then is effected by increasing the temperature and lowering the pressure while excess diol is removed from the mixture. Solid state polymerization may be employed to achieve final polymer l,V. in a useful range for films and molded containers.<br>
The novel polyester compositions provided by this invention are useful in the manijfacture of containers or packages for comestibles such as beverages and food.  By the use of known heat-setting techniques, certain of the polyesters are, in terms of color, l,V. and heat distortion, stable at temperatures up to about 100°C.  Such stability characteristics are referred to herein as "hot-fill" stability. Articles molded from these polyesters exhibit<br><br>
good thin-wall rigidity, excellent clarity and good barrier properties with respect to moisture and atmospheric gases, particularlv carbon dioxide and oxygen.<br>
Rigid containers may be manufactured by known mechanical processes:<br>
a)	Single-stage blow molding such as performed on Nissei, Aoki, or Uniloy machines,<br>
b)	Two-stage, injection molding of pre-forms such as on Netstal or Husky machines, and pre-forms converted to bottles by blow molding (e.g,, on Sidel, Corpoplast and Krones machines),<br>
c)	Integrated blow molding of pre-forms to bottles, such as processes conducted on Sipa, Krupp Kautex, or Husky ISB machines, and<br>
d)	Stretch blow molding (SBM) of pre-forms to bottles.<br>
The pre-forms may be mono-layer or multi-layer in construction.  The bottles may optionally be post-treated to alter the inner wall properties.  Bottles may optionally be surface treated on the exterior such as by application of surface coatings. UV absorbers and other known stabilizers may be present in such added surface coatings.<br>
The linear polyesters most preferred for use in articles having "hot-fill" stability comprise poIy(et!iyIene terephthalate), pGly(ethylene terephthalate) wherein up to 5 mole percent of the ethylene glycol residues have been replaced with residues derived from 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol and poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate), wherein the polyesters have been sufficiently heat set and ohented by methods well known in the art to give a desired degree of crystallinity.  By definition, a polymer is "hot-flil" stable at a prescribed temperature when less than 2% change in volume of a container manufactured therefrom occurs upon filling the same with a liquid at the temperature. For the manufacture of blow-molded beverage bottles, the most preferred polyesters have an I.V. of 0,65 to 0,85, and a Tg of &gt;70°C, and film sections cut from the bottle have a Water Vapor Transmission Rate of 1.5 to 2.5 g mils/100 in.^-24 hours, a Carbon Dioxide Permeability of 20 to 30 cc. mils/100 in,^-24 hours -atm., and an Oxygen Permeability of 4 to 8 cc. mils/100 in.^-24<br><br>
hours -atm. The Tg is determined by Differentiai Scanning Calorimetry at a scan rate of 20 Centigrade Degrees/min,, the Oxygen Permeability by the standard operating procedure of a MOCON OXTRAN 100 instrument of Modern Controls, Inc., of Elk Riber, Minnesota, and the Carbon Dioxide Permeability by the standard operating procedure of-a MOCON PERMATRANCJI, also of Modem Controls.<br>

1.  Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, polybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HDPE), high density and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE).<br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, preferably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
i} radical polymerization (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature),<br>
ii) catalytic polymerization using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either p- or s-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titan(um(III) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerization medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerization or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyi halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, lla and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips,<br><br>
standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br>

For the following Examples the exposure conditions are as follows;<br>
Samples are exposed under a bank of six (6) cool white fluorescent lamps {40 watts) or under a bank of six (6) UV lamps having a wavelength of 368 nm with the test samples being twelve (12) inches (30.48 cm) below the lamps.<br>
Dye color fade (or color change) is measured by a Macbeth ColorEye Spectrophotometer with a 6 inch integrating sphere.  The conditions are :  10 degree observer;  DBS illuminant and 8 degree viewing angle.<br>
Initial color measurements are taken using the above parameters. The L, a and b values are calculated using the CIE system from the reflectance values,  Yl is calculated from the L, a and b values. Subsequent measurements are taken at specified intervals. Delta L, a, b and Yi values are simply the difference between the initial values and the values at each interval.  Delta (A) E is calculated as follows:  [(A L)^ + (A a)^ + (A b)^]''^ = A E<br>
A low A E indicates less change in color and is highly desirable.<br><br>
