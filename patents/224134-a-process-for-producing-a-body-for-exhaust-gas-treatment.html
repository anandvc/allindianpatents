				<td>Roller seam welded body for exhaust gas treatment<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a body for exhaust gas<br>
treatment, which has a plurality of metallic layers forming passages through which<br>
a gas stream can flow. Bodies of this type are used in particular for purifying the<br>
exhaust gases from mobile internal combustion engines, such as spark ignition or<br>
diesel engines. Primary application areas in this context are passenger automobiles<br>
as well as trucks and motor cycles. It is also known for these bodies to be used in<br>
exhaust systems of portable hand held appliances, such as for example power<br>
saws, lawnmowers, etc.<br>
Bodies of this type have a number of different functions. For example, they are<br>
used as catalyst support bodies, as adsorbers, as filters, flow mixers or mufflers.<br>
The body is usually distinguished by a favorable ratio of surface area to volume,<br>
i.e. it has a relatively large surface area and therefore ensures intensive contact<br>
with the gas stream flowing through it.<br>
With regard to catalyst support bodies, this surface or the body is provided with a<br>
catalytically active coating, which preferably comprises washcoat. The washcoat<br>
has a particularly fissured surface, so that the ratio of surface area to volume can<br>
be improved still further. The washcoat is impregnated with various catalysts, for<br>
example platinum, rhodium or the like.<br>
Adsorbers substantially have a similar basic structure as that selected for bodies<br>
used as catalyst support bodies. However, a different objective is pursued with<br>
regard to the coating, so that consequently different coatings are used. The purpose<br>
of the adsorbers is, for example, to retain nitrogen oxides until suitable reaction<br>
partners and/or temperatures are present to allow these constituents of the exhaust<br>
gas to be converted as fully as possible.<br>
Flow mixers are distinguished by the fact that their bodies have a multiplicity of<br>
passages which are flow-connected to one another. At the same time, guide<br>
surfaces, which allow the partial gas streams to be diverted, are provided in the<br>
interior of the body or of the passages. In this way, the gas stream, is made more<br>
uniform in terms of its pollutant concentration, its flow properties, its temperature,<br>
etc.<br>
A wide range of different structural forms are known for the abovementioned<br>
bodies as catalyst support bodies, adsorbers, mufflers and flow mixers. These<br>
forms include, for example, honeycomb bodies comprising at least partially<br>
structured sheet-metal foils. Compared to known bodies made from ceramic<br>
material, the metallic honeycomb bodies have a considerably greater flexibility in<br>
terms of their intended use and also allow a greater degree of design freedom. It<br>
should also be borne in mind that particularly effective conversion processes with<br>
regard to the pollutant concentration are ensured on account of the good heat<br>
conduction and the extremely low area-specific heat capacity.<br>
A distinction is drawn in particular between two typical designs of metallic<br>
honeycomb bodies. An early design, of which DE 29 02 779 A1 shows typical<br>
examples, is the helical design, in which substantially one smooth and one<br>
corrugated sheet-metal layer are placed on top of one another and wound helically.<br>
In another design, the honeycomb body is constructed from a multiplicity of<br>
alternately arranged smooth and corrugated or differently corrugated sheet-metal<br>
layers, the sheet-metal layers initially forming one or more stacks which are then<br>
intertwined. In this case, the ends of all the sheet-metal layers come to lay on the<br>
outside and can be connected to a housing or tubular casing, producing numerous<br>
connections, which increase the durability of the honeycomb body. Typical<br>
examples of these designs are described in EP 0 245 737 B1 or WO 90/03220. It<br>
has also long been known to equip the sheet-metal layers with additional structures<br>
in order to influence the flow and/or bring about cross-mixing between the<br>
individual flow passages. Typical examples of these configurations include<br>
WO 91/01178, WO 91/01807 and WO 90/08249. Finally, there are also conical<br>
honeycomb bodies, optionally also with further additional structures for<br>
influencing the flow. A honeycomb body of this type is described, for example, in<br>
WO 97/49905. Furthermore, it is also known to leave free a cutout in a honeycomb<br>
body for a sensor, in particular for accommodating a lambda sensor. One such<br>
example is described in DE 88 16 154 U1.<br>
Of course, the designs described above are also suitable for forming filter bodies.<br>
In principle, two different principles are known for these or other filter bodies. One<br>
principle relates to what is known as the "closed particulate filter", in which the<br>
passages formed by the body are closed on alternate sides, therefore forcing the<br>
gas stream to pass through passage walls comprising filter material.. This leads to<br>
the accumulation of particulates or solids contained in the gas stream, which are<br>
burnt and/or oxidized continuously or at predeterminable intervals. An alternative<br>
known design is that of the "open particulate filter", which is not closed on<br>
alternate sides, but rather has flow diversion points in the interior of the passages,<br>
which cause the partial gas streams to be swirled up in such a way that at least 80%<br>
of the partial gas streams pass through the filter wall, preferably a number of times.<br>
The major advantage of the "open particulate filter" is that blockage of the filter<br>
material caused by an excessive accumulation of particulates is avoided. A<br>
particulate filter is described as "open" if particulates can fundamentally flow<br>
completely through it, specifically including particulates which are considerably<br>
larger than the particulates that are actually to be filtered out. As a result, a filter of<br>
this type cannot become blocked even in the event of an agglomeration of<br>
particulates during operation. A suitable method for measuring the openness of a<br>
particulate filter is, for example, to test the diameter up to which spherical particles<br>
can still trickle through a filter of this type. In present applications, a filter is open<br>
in particular if spheres with a diameter of greater than or equal to 0.1 mm can still<br>
trickle through it, preferably spheres with a diameter of over 0.2 mm. One such<br>
example is given in DE 2011783U1 to which reference is made in full for the<br>
purposes of explanation.<br>
In addition to these bodies with wound or intertwined layers, it is also known to<br>
use what are known as plate filters, which comprise a plurality of in particular<br>
sheet-like or substantially planar filter plates which are arranged spaced apart from<br>
one another. Plate filters of this type are usually also constructed in accordance<br>
with the principle of passages that are closed on alternate sides, but it is in<br>
principle also possible to realize an "open particulate filter".<br>
Whereas wound designs and plate designs of this type have the gas stream flowing<br>
through them substantially axially, bodies or filter bodies which the gas stream<br>
flows through radially are also known. Such bodies usually have an inner flow<br>
passage and an outer flow passage which is annular in form and is generally<br>
arranged coaxially with respect to the inner flow passage. The inner flow passage<br>
is generally delimited by an inner tube, which is provided with openings through<br>
which the gas stream to be purified is passed. Layers of a filter material are<br>
arranged around this inner tube. Substantially two different concepts are known in<br>
this respect. The first concept can be described on the basis of a "star shape",<br>
which is realized when the filter plates are viewed in the direction of the inner tube<br>
or a cross section perpendicular to the inner tube. This means in other words that<br>
the filter plates form folds which extend substantially parallel to the axial extent of<br>
the inner tube. Another known concept involves the formation of folds in the<br>
circumferential direction, in which case a plurality of these folds are positioned on<br>
the inner tube, spaced apart from one another in the axial direction. According to<br>
the routing of the flow, the gas stream that is to be purified is fed to the filter<br>
material from the inside (or from the outside), penetrates through this filter<br>
material and is discharged again on the opposite side.<br>
The bodies described above generally comprise a plurality or multiplicity of<br>
different components made from in some cases different materials. Considering the<br>
high thermal and dynamic stresses in the exhaust system of mobile internal<br>
combustion engines, these individual components have to be permanently<br>
connected to one another. Numerous different connection techniques are known<br>
for this purpose, for example brazing and/or welding. With regard to these<br>
connection techniques, it should be noted that they have to be suitable for at least<br>
medium-sized series production. In this respect, cost aspects also play an important<br>
role, such as cycle rates, connection quality, process reliability, etc. Known<br>
processes used to form connections by joining (in particular in the structure<br>
comprising the filter surfaces and/or the layers) require an additional material, such<br>
as, for example braze or weld filler. It is in this case particularly difficult for the<br>
filler to be applied at precisely the location at which a join is subsequently to be<br>
produced. Moreover, it should be noted that increasingly thin-walled materials<br>
need to be used, since such materials very quickly adapt to the temperature of the<br>
exhaust gas and accordingly have highly dynamic reaction properties. To ensure<br>
the long-term functionality of these bodies, however, a spatially tightly delimited<br>
introduction of heat is required to form the connections by joining. Hitherto, this<br>
has not been achievable to a satisfactory extent, and indeed brazing generally<br>
requires heating of the entire body in a high-temperature vacuum furnace, and<br>
welding has hitherto usually also been carried out through the outer housing, and<br>
consequently in this case too considerable temperature gradients have been<br>
realized across a large part of the body.<br>
Working on this basis, it is an object of the present Invention to overcome the<br>
above technical problems of the prior art. In particular, it is intended to provide an<br>
inexpensive, simple, effective and reliable process for producing metallic bodies of<br>
this type for exhaust gas purification. Moreover, the process should as far as<br>
possible be suitable for automation, producing connections by joining which are<br>
distinguished by a particularly long service life. Furthermore, it is intended to<br>
provide a corresponding body for exhaust gas treatment which can be configured<br>
variably and is versatile in use.<br>
These objects are achieved by a process having the features of patent claim 1 and a<br>
body having the features of patent claim. 18 Further advantageous configurations<br>
are described in the respective dependent patent claims, which can be combined<br>
with one another in any desired way.<br>
The process according to the invention for producing a body for exhaust gas<br>
treatment which has a plurality of metallic layers is characterized in that the layers<br>
are brought into contact with one another in a connection region, and a connection<br>
is produced by a continuous resistance welding process, in such a manner that the<br>
layers form passages through which a gas stream can at least partially flow. In<br>
other words, this means in particular that the connection between layers arranged<br>
adjacent to one another is effected by the continuous resistant welding process.<br>
In this context, it should be noted that the term "continuous" may mean that the<br>
welding takes place along one welding track, in which case the weld seam which is<br>
generated is made uninterrupted. However, this need not necessarily be the case;<br>
for example, it is also possible for a plurality of weld seams which axe spaced apart<br>
to be provided along the welding track, in which case the proportion in which the<br>
weld seams are present along the welding track is advantageously significantly<br>
greater than the proportion formed by the interruptions. It is particularly preferable<br>
for the proportion formed by the weld seam, based on the welding track, to amount<br>
to at least 80%, in particular even more than 90%.<br>
With regard to the "passages", it should also be noted that these passages need not<br>
necessarily have a tube-like structure. Rather, this term is to be understood as<br>
meaning a limited flow path which has a spatial boundary. In this case, the<br>
boundary is generally configured in such a way that it encloses the flow path over<br>
at least 60% (in particular 80%) of the circumference, with the length of the flow<br>
path advantageously being greater than the circumference.<br>
In view of the fact that the abovementioned body may also be constructed as a<br>
filter, it will be clear that the passages do not necessarily have to have a gastight<br>
passage wall, i.e. it is also eminently possible for the layers to be configured so as<br>
to be at least partially gas-permeable. In particular in this case, the gas stream does<br>
not flow completely through the passage, in which case although the passage does<br>
have a suitable cross section, the gas stream nevertheless uses a different route.<br>
Therefore, it is considered sufficient for the passage to offer the option of at least<br>
partially allowing a gas stream to flow through it, in particular with open end sides.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration of the process, the continuous<br>
resistance welding process comprises roller seam welding and/or projection seam<br>
welding.<br>
Roller seam welding and the projection seam welding process belong to the<br>
pressure-joining welding processes, in particular resistance pressure welding or<br>
conductive pressure welding. In the resistance pressure welding process, the<br>
heating at the welding location takes place as a result of Joule resistance heating<br>
when current flows and by means of an electrical conductor. The current is<br>
supplied via electrodes with a convex or planar working surface. Two roller-like<br>
(driven) electrodes are used for the roller seam welding. The metal sheets to be<br>
welded are in this case arranged predominantly overlapping. In practice, roller<br>
seam welding is a continuous spot welding, but using roller-like electrodes. Unlike<br>
when using resistance spot welding, the electrodes remain in contact after the first<br>
weld spot has been produced and are then rolled continuously onward. Further<br>
current flows at the locations where a weld spot is to be formed. Depending on the<br>
feed rate of the electrodes and the frequency of the welding current, spot seams or<br>
sealed seams with overlapping weld nuggets or weld spots are produced.<br>
Permanent direct current likewise produces a sealed seam.<br>
The use of this production process to connect the layers has proven particularly<br>
advantageous in particular with a view to series production of these bodies. The<br>
process in which the two layers adjacent or lying on top of one another are passed<br>
through the rotating electrodes is surprisingly well able to withstand the high<br>
thermal and dynamic stresses for example in the exhaust system of automobiles. It<br>
has also been established that even in the case of very thin metal foils which are<br>
connected to one another in this way, sealed weld seams can be produced in very<br>
short working cycles. As a result, it is possible to achieve in particular a cost<br>
benefit, which was unexpected in view of the additional material which is required<br>
for the overlap between the two layers. Roller seam welding is suitable in<br>
particular for connection regions which have a certain length, i.e.. extend over a<br>
predetermined portion. This should generally amount to at least 5 cm, in particular<br>
at least 15 cm, and the work can be carried out at particularly low cost beyond a<br>
length of 25 cm. The roller seam welding makes do without filler. Furthermore, it<br>
is in many cases also possible to do without a step of cleaning the layers, since the<br>
introduction of the electrode force ensures that contact between the electrodes<br>
and/or the layers which is sufficient for the flow of current and the formation of the<br>
weld spot is already ensured to a considerable extent. Moreover, only an<br>
insignificant change in the microstructure of the layer adjacent to the weld nugget<br>
can be established. Accordingly, the use of this manufacturing process offers<br>
numerous advantages and at the same time overcomes all the technical problems<br>
listed in the introduction at once. Moreover, the process can also be applied to each<br>
of the types of bodies mentioned in the introduction.<br>
According to one refinement of the process, it is proposed that at least in part a<br>
weld seam in which there are at least overlapping weld spots is formed. This<br>
applies in particular to the case in which the ends or edge regions of the layers are<br>
to be fixed to one another. These edge regions or edges for example close up flow<br>
paths, so that the exhaust gas to be purified is forced to pass through a filter<br>
material. To ensure the principle of a "closed particulate filter", a sealed seam<br>
should be at least partially present. This is to be understood as meaning that the<br>
welding current pulses take place in succession at such short time intervals that the<br>
respectively adjacent weld spots or weld nuggets merge into one another, i.e. there<br>
are no unconnected locations on the layers between adjacent weld spots. As has<br>
already been stated above, a sealed seam of this type is achieved by virtue of the<br>
frequency of the current pulses being selected to be relatively short, the feed rate<br>
being relatively low or by the presence of direct current, i.e. current flows<br>
continuously between the electrode during the feeding.<br>
According to a refinement of the process, it is also proposed that a feed rate during<br>
roller seam welding in the range from 0.5 cm/s to 30 m/s, in particular in the range<br>
from 0.5 m/min to 30 m/min, is used.<br>
This feed rate is used in particular when connecting metallic foil material which<br>
has a thickness of from 0.03 to 0.1 mm. In this case, the material to be connected<br>
preferably includes the following constituents: from 0.1 to 7.5% by weight of<br>
aluminum, and from 17 to 25% by weight of chromium. Another preferred<br>
material comprises from 12 to 32% by weight of nickel.<br>
Furthermore, it is also proposed that during the welding operation the electrodes<br>
exert a force of from 10 N to 29 kN, in particular from 200 N to 6 kN, on the<br>
layers. This ensures that, for example, any rolling oil or similar impurities adhering<br>
to the layers are forced out of the welding location. The result is both intensive<br>
contact between the components which are to be connected to one another and<br>
between the components and the electrodes. At the same time, this ensures that<br>
when the material is heated, the heated or molten materials are intimately mixed,<br>
so as to achieve a permanent connection.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process, the layers, at least in an edge<br>
region, are laid on top of one another, are welded at least over a portion in this<br>
edge region and are then deformed, so as to form the passages. In other words, this<br>
also means that the weld seam at least partially delimits the passage through which<br>
the exhaust gas can flow. With regard to the preferred magnitudes of the length of<br>
the portion, reference should be made to the statements given above. In principle,<br>
however, it should also be noted that it is customary for the complete edge regions<br>
to be connected to one another, i.e. accordingly the portion corresponds to the<br>
longest extent of the edge region.<br>
In particular, it is proposed that the layers are formed with at least one metallic foil<br>
which is made from a high-temperature-resistant and corrosion-resistant material<br>
and is preferably at least partially structured and/or allows a fluid to flow through<br>
it at least in regions. With regard to the material of the metallic foil, reference<br>
should be made at this point to the composition listed above. Furthermore,<br>
however, a person skilled in the art will be aware of a large number of further<br>
materials which are suitable for use in mobile exhaust gas systems. In this case,<br>
reference should be made to the large number of different materials which are<br>
given in the known prior art. When making a choice, it should also be borne in<br>
mind that this material must in general terms be suitable for resistance welding, i.e.<br>
in particular must also conduct current.<br>
The preferred configuration of the metallic foil with structures or apertures, pores,<br>
holes or the like is in this case predominantly located outside the edge regions<br>
which are used for connection by roller seam welding. Examples of suitable<br>
structures include corrugations, guide vanes, stamped formations or other<br>
structures. They are usually used to guide or swirl up the exhaust gas flowing<br>
along the metallic foil, in order in this way to ensure intimate contact with the<br>
surface of the body. Furthermore, these structures can also be used to make sure<br>
that the layers are at a predeterminable distance from one another. In this case, the<br>
structure represents a type of spacer. The effect of the foil being configured such<br>
that medium can flow through it at least in regions is that gas exchange can take<br>
place through the metallic foil. This usually depends on a forced flow, for example<br>
imposed by diverting vanes, sealing materials, etc. or by pressure differences in<br>
adjacent passages, which are in each case partially delimited by the metallic foil.<br>
According to an advantageous refinement of the process, it is proposed that the<br>
layers are formed with a filter fabric or a supporting structure comprising a filter<br>
material. A filter fabric comprises in particular knitted fabrics, woven fabrics or<br>
similar arrangements of chips, fibers or other particles which are bonded to one<br>
another. The are held together, for example, by sintered connections, brazed<br>
connections, welding connections or combinations thereof. The filter fabrics may<br>
be composed of metallic or ceramic material. Furthermore, it is also possible to<br>
provide a supporting structure on or in which a filter material is provided. Suitable<br>
supporting structures are once again woven fabrics, knitted fabrics, expanded<br>
metals or the like, in particular coarse-mesh formations, in the cavities of which<br>
the filter material is provided. It is this context particularly advantageous for the<br>
supporting structure to be metallic in form, in which case both ceramic and<br>
metallic materials can be used as filter material. The filter material is connected to<br>
the supporting structure by means of sintered connections, diffusion bonds, if<br>
appropriate also using filler materials, or combinations of these connection<br>
techniques. The connection according to the invention between the layers using a<br>
continuous resistance weld seam can also be carried out so as to incorporate this<br>
supporting structure, in particular by the layers being welded to one another<br>
exclusively via the supporting structures.<br>
The filter material itself forms an extremely high surface area with a multiplicity of<br>
pores, openings, flow passages and cavities. As the gas stream flows through the<br>
filter material, the undesired particulates stick to the surface and are converted into<br>
gaseous constituents when heat and/or reaction partners contained in the exhaust<br>
gas are supplied.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process, the layers are of multi-part<br>
structure, the layers being provided with a metallic foil in the connecting region, so<br>
that the metallic foils of layers arranged adjacent to one another are connected by<br>
means of roller seam welding. This means in particular that the foils are provided<br>
only in the edge region of the layers. In this case, for a filter material or a<br>
supporting structure they preferably form a construction which is suitable for roller<br>
seam welding. It is in this way possible to adapt components of the body which<br>
cannot normally be connected by such a process to the requirements of roller seam<br>
welding.<br>
It is in this context particularly advantageous if the layer comprises a filter fabric,<br>
the filter fabric, in the edge region, which subsequently forms the connecting<br>
region, being surrounded, and preferably also flanged, by in each case one metallic<br>
foil, and finally a plurality of layers produced in this way being welded to one<br>
another. In this case, the layers are configured in particular as a filter composite or<br>
filter layer as proposed by DE 101 53 284 and DE 101 53 283. With regard to the<br>
construction of filter layers or filter composites of this type, reference is made to<br>
the above-referenced publications in full, and consequently the descriptions given<br>
therein are used to explain the present situation.<br>
With regard to the above process variant for production of the body, it is<br>
particularly advantageous if the flanging and the roller seam welding are carried<br>
out simultaneously. By way of example, structured rolled electrodes are used for<br>
this purpose, which on the one hand allows the metallic foil to be hooked to the<br>
filter fabric and at the same time, on account of the flow of current, allows a<br>
connection by cohesive joining. In this case, the welding process can also be<br>
carried out in such a way that flanged connections and welded connections<br>
alternate in the welding direction. In the present context, the term flanging is to be<br>
understood in particular as meaning manual or mechanical bending-over of the<br>
edges of sheet-metal parts to remove the sharpness of the edge and/or to reinforce<br>
the workpiece.<br>
According to yet another configuration of the process, it is proposed that the layers<br>
are welded together in such a way that they are connected in the edge regions on<br>
alternate sides to in each case an adjacent layer, so as to in each case form a fold.<br>
The procedure described here for the production of a body is suitable in particular<br>
for producing filter bodies. In this case, the layers, which preferably also comprise<br>
filter fabric or a filter material, are connected to one another at their edge regions,<br>
in order to realize the principle of the "closed particulate filter". After two adjacent<br>
layers have been welded together, the layers can be folded open so that they form<br>
an angle to one another in an edge region. The intermediate space which has<br>
formed between the layers is referred to as a fold. This represents a flows passage<br>
or passage in particular in the case of the radial-flow particulate filters.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that the layers are designed with supporting means,<br>
which are preferably arranged in a passage and/or in a fold. The term supporting<br>
means is to be understood in particular as meaning spacers, reinforcing structures,<br>
spacer pieces or similar means which ensure that the predetermined position of the<br>
layers with respect to one another is retained even during subsequent use in the<br>
exhaust system of mobile internal combustion engines.<br>
It is in this context particularly advantageous if the supporting means are<br>
connected to the layer by the roller seam welding manufacturing process,<br>
preferably at the same time as a connection of the layers to one another is being<br>
executed. By way of example, the supporting means may be formed as a structure<br>
of the metallic foil, which therefore bear against regions of the adjacent layer and<br>
ensure the aperture angle or the spacing of the layers which are spaced apart from<br>
one another. The connection of the layers according to the invention using a<br>
continuous resistance weld seam can also be carried out incorporating these<br>
supporting means; under certain circumstances, the layers are even welded to one<br>
another exclusively via the supporting means.<br>
Moreover, it is also proposed that the welded layers are connected to at least one<br>
housing, preferably by welding or brazing. In the case of axial-flow bodies, direct<br>
connection of the layers to the housing located on the outer side is preferred.<br>
Known brazing or welding techniques can be used for this purpose. If the body<br>
realizes a radial-flow design, a connection to an outer housing is generally realized<br>
only indirectly, i.e. via additional elements. In designs of this type, a housing<br>
which is directly connected to the layers and is arranged on the outer<br>
circumference of the body is usually avoided, since this annular space is usually<br>
required for the incoming and/or outgoing flow of the gas stream. The outer<br>
housing is then fixed via any additional components, such as spacers, cover plates,<br>
collars or the like.<br>
In particular in the context of the radial-flow concept, it is proposed that the<br>
housing is an inner tube with a center axis, to the outer lateral surface of which<br>
inner tube the layers are secured. For this purpose, the inner tube is provided with<br>
holes or flow passages which allow the exhaust gas to flow through the inner tube<br>
without generating a high flow resistance. This makes is easy to connect the cavity<br>
arranged in the interior of the tubular casing toward the folds, which have been<br>
formed by the layers arranged on the outside. The connection of the layers toward<br>
the inner tube can be realized by mechanical connection means or by thermal<br>
joining. In particular with a view to securing using mechanical securing means, it<br>
is to be assumed that the inner tube is preferably of multi-part construction. To<br>
divert the gas stream toward the filter surfaces, the inner tube is usually equipped<br>
with a closed end.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration, the layers are to be arranged in such<br>
a way that the connecting regions or the folds or passages formed by the layers run<br>
in the direction of the center axis. With regard to the words "in the direction of the<br>
center axis", it should be pointed out for clarification that this does not require any<br>
particular accuracy, but rather relatively large tolerances are possible under certain<br>
circumstances. In this case, therefore, there are a plurality of folds which are<br>
arranged adjacent to one another in the circumferential direction and preferably<br>
extend over a large portion of the inner tube. The connection regions between the<br>
individual layers and between the layers and the inner tube in this case run in the<br>
axial direction parallel to the center axis.<br>
In an alternative configuration, the layers are arranged in such a way that the<br>
connecting regions and/or the folds or passages formed by the layers run<br>
perpendicular to the center axis. With regard to the words "perpendicular to the<br>
center axis", it should be pointed out for clarification that this does not require any<br>
particular accuracy, but rather relatively large tolerances are possible under certain<br>
circumstances. The feature means in particular that the fold is designed as an<br>
annular passage extending in the circumferential direction. A plurality of these<br>
annular folds are arranged spaced apart from one another (as seen in the direction<br>
of the center axis). The connection regions between the individual layers and<br>
between the layers and the inner tube run in the circumferential direction.<br>
Another aspect of the invention proposes a body for treating the exhaust gas from<br>
mobile internal combustion engines, which is produced in particular by one of the<br>
processes explained above. The body has a plurality of metallic layers, wherein the<br>
layers are in contact with one another in a connecting region, and a roller seam<br>
welded connection is provided between at least some of the layers, so that the<br>
layers form passages through which a fluid can flow. A body of this type is<br>
suitable for use as a catalyst support body, an adsorber, a filter body of a flow<br>
mixer. It is also possible for the body to be configured in such a way as to form<br>
zones with different functions, for example by having different coatings in<br>
different zones. It is also possible for the layers to be designed differently with<br>
regard to the gas permeability and/or the structuring in these zones, so that<br>
different exhaust-gas purification steps are passed through sequentially in the<br>
direction of flow.<br>
The invention and the technical background will now be explained in more detail<br>
with reference to the figures. The figures show particularly preferred exemplary<br>
embodiments, although the invention is not restricted to these embodiments.<br>
Rather, the production process of roller seam welding can be used for numerous<br>
different designs of bodies for exhaust-gas purification, with in particular the<br>
connection between the layers forming the flow passages being produced using<br>
these manufacturing processes. In the accompanying drawmg:<br>
Fig. 1 diagrammatically depicts the sequence of a configuration of the<br>
process for producing a body for exhaust-gas treatment,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a detail view of a variant embodiment of a body for exhaust-gas<br>
treatment,<br>
Fig 3 shows a further diagrammatic illustration of an exemplary embodiment<br>
of the body,<br>
Fig. 4 shows an exemplary embodiment of a body with longitudinal folds,<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further configuration of a body with coaxial folds, and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further exemplary embodiment of a body with folds in the<br>
circumferential direction.<br>
Fig. 1 diagrammatically depicts the sequence involved in the production process of<br>
roller seam welding, which is used here to produce a body for exhaust gas<br>
treatment. Fig. 1 illustrates two metallic foils 12 which are brought into contact<br>
with one another. The foils 12 resting on top of one another are passed at a feed<br>
rate 7 through two rotating electrodes 8. In the process, the two electrodes 8 press<br>
on the surface of the foils 12 with a force 9. The two electrodes 8 are connected to<br>
one another via a current source 26, with current flowing between the electrodes 8<br>
and therefore also locally through the foils 12 with a predetermined frequency. The<br>
current leads to heating of the foils 12, so that they become at least partially<br>
molten. The foils 12 in this case have a thickness 22 which is, for example, in the<br>
range from 0.02 to 0.1 mm. As a result of Joule resistance heating, a multiplicity of<br>
weld spots 6, which preferably merge into one another so as to form a sealed seam<br>
5, are formed in the contact region between the two foils 12.<br>
Fig. 2 diagrammatically depicts a detailed view of a connecting region 3, which is<br>
formed between two adjacent layers 2. The layers 2 are formed with a filter fabric<br>
13, which is provided near an edge region 10 with a foil 12 that has been flanged.<br>
The foils 12 project beyond the filter fabric 13 and form an edge region 10, which<br>
is finally pushed through the rotating electrodes 8, so that a roller seam welded<br>
connection is produced between the two foils 12. Whereas the filter fabric 13 is of<br>
gas-permeable design, as is indicated by the dashed arrows, the foil 12 itself is in<br>
this case impermeable to gases. The foil 12 in this case serves simultaneously to<br>
fix supporting means 17, ensuring a defined position of the layers 2 with respect to<br>
one another, so that the folds 16 are always of the desired shape.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a body of plate construction, with the layers 2 arranged substantially<br>
parallel to one another. The plate-like layers 2 in the embodiment illustrated<br>
comprise a supporting structure 14 in which a filter material 15 has been<br>
integrated. A connecting region 3 is in each case formed in the edge regions on<br>
alternate sides of the layers 2. The connecting region 3 again comprises roller seam<br>
welded connections. The connection region 3 bears directly against a housing 18<br>
and is connected to it be joining. The supporting means 17 arranged between the<br>
layers 2 are, for example, structured metal foils or structures of the layers 2<br>
themselves, which prevent the layers 2 from bearing directly flat against one<br>
another. It can also be seen that with the body 1 illustrated the principle of a<br>
"closed particulate filter" has been implemented, in which adjacent passages 4 are<br>
provided with a closure 24, so that the gas stream has to pass through the layers 2<br>
in the direction of flow 23.<br>
Fig. 4 shows another variant embodiment of a body 1 for exhaust gas treatment,<br>
which is used in particular as a filter. This figure shows a radial-flow concept, in<br>
which the gas stream that is to be purified first of all enters an inner region in the<br>
direction of the center axis 21 through the cover plate 25. The rear-side cover plate<br>
25 closes off the inner flow passage and therefore forces the exhaust gas to pass<br>
through the layers 2 which form the folds 16. The body 1 illustrated again has<br>
supporting means 17, which ensure the position of the layers 2 with respect to one<br>
another even in the event of pressure fluctuations occurring in the gas flow. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment illustrated, the layers 2 are arranged in such a way that the<br>
connection regions 3 and the folds 16 formed by the layers 2 run in the direction of<br>
the center axis 21. The connection regions 3 are in each case formed over a portion<br>
11.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further variant embodiment of a body 1, in particular a filter body.<br>
In this case, the folds 16 run substantially coaxially with respect to the center axis<br>
21. The layers 2 are mounted on the end sides of a cover plate 25 which at least<br>
partially allows the exhaust gas to flow through it. The connection regions 3 of the<br>
layers 2 arranged adjacent to one another are arranged substantially coaxially to<br>
the center axis 21, once again realizing the principle of a "closed particulate filter".<br>
The layers 2 in this case comprise a supporting structure 14 in which the filter<br>
material 15 is additionally provided.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a body 1 in which the layers 2 are arranged in such a way that the<br>
connection regions 3 and the folds 16 formed by the layers 2 run substantially<br>
perpendicular to the center axis 21. The layers 2 are secured to an outer lateral<br>
surface 20 of an inner tube 19. The inner tube 19 has openings through which the<br>
gas stream can enter radially inward, as indicated by the arrows for the direction of<br>
flow 23. Additional supporting means 17 are arranged between the layers 2 outside<br>
the folds 16 illustrated in dotted form; these supporting means 17 are in this case<br>
connected on one side to the inner tube 19 and on the other side to the layers 2.<br>
Moreover, the entire arrangement is enclosed by a housing 18 spaced apart from<br>
the layers 2. The connection regions 3, which have been generated using the roller<br>
seam welding process, are formed on the outer circumference and the internal<br>
circumference of the layers 2. They in each case produce a connection between the<br>
layers 2 arranged adjacent to one another.<br>
