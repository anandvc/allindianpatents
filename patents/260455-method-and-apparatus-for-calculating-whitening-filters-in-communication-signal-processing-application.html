BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to wireless communication systems, and<br>
particularly relates to interference suppression in wireless communication receivers.<br>
Direct-sequence spread-spectrum modulation is commonly used in CDMA systems<br>
(such as W-CDMA, IS-95, and IS-2000). Data to be transmitted via a spread spectrum<br>
carrier is mapped into information symbols, and each information symbol is transmitted as<br>
a sequence of chips, which gives rise to bandwidth spreading. The sequence of chips used<br>
to spread the transmit symbols is referred to as the spreading code.<br>
At the receiver, the received signal is despread using a despreading code, which<br>
typically is the conjugate of the spreading code. RAKE receivers represent a traditional<br>
approach to demodulating CDMA signals. RAKE receivers capitalize on the multipath<br>
propagation that typically exists between the transmitter and the receiver. Multipath<br>
propagation of the transmitted signal can lead to time dispersion, which causes multiple<br>
resolvable echoes (or rays) of the signal to be received at the receiver. A RAKE receiver<br>
aligns different ones of its "fingers" (correlators) with different ones of the signal echoes,<br>
and each finger outputs despread values at the symbol rate. These despread values are<br>
then weighted by the conjugate of the respective channel coefficient and then summed to<br>
produce a soft estimate of the transmitted symbol. This weighting and summing process is<br>
commonly referred to as RAKE combining.<br>
Combining multipath echoes in the above manner yields an improved Signal-to-<br>
interference Ratio (SIR) when white noise is the dominant received signal impairment<br>
term at the receiver. However, RAKE combining is less than optimal when colored noise<br>
is the dominant impairment term. Colored noise arises from self-interference (Inter-<br>
Symbol Interference or ISI) and Multi-user Access Interference (MAI). As wireless<br>
networks crowd more and more users onto the same spectrum, and as the signal data rates<br>
increase, colored noise may become more problematic.<br>
Thus, receiver structures capable of colored noise suppression represent an area of<br>
increasing interest. Unfortunately, the conventional approaches to interference<br>
suppression in colored noise environments entail potentially significant receiver<br>
complexity. For the typical portable communication device, such as a cellular<br><br>
radiotelephone, Portable Digital Assistant (PDA) or wireless pager, that complexity adds<br>
cost and undesirably affects cost, design time, and battery life.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises a method and apparatus for calculating whitening<br>
filters in communication signal processing applications, such as in wireless<br>
communication receivers. As a simplifying construction, a frequency domain<br>
representation of a whitening filter is made to depend on essentially one unknown,<br>
namely, a scaling factor that is based on an estimated ratio of total base station power to<br>
the power spectral density (PSD) of inter-cell interference plus noise. An exemplary<br>
method reduces the computational complexity of calculating the scaling factor by<br>
computing it based on the modeling terms used in a parametric model of the impairment<br>
correlations for a received communication signal. Preferably, the model comprises an<br>
interference impairment term scaled by a first model fitting parameter, and a noise<br>
impairment term scaled by a second model fitting parameter. Alternatively, the scaling<br>
factor can be computed by direct estimation, for example.<br>
Thus, in an exemplary embodiment, the present invention comprises a method of<br>
generating a whitening filter for a communication signal transmitted from a wireless<br>
communication network base station comprising estimating a ratio of total base station<br>
transmit power to the PSD of inter-cell interference plus noise, calculating a scaling factor<br>
based on the estimated ratio of total base station transmit power to the PSD of inter-cell<br>
interference plus noise, and determining a whitening filter for whitening the<br>
communication signal. That whitening filter determination can be a function of the<br>
scaling factor, a frequency response associated with a transmit pulse shaping filter used at<br>
the base station, and a frequency response of a propagation channel through which the<br>
communication signal is received.<br>
	With the above basis for filter determination, the whitening filter determination can<br>
be made using a stored or calculated value for the transmit pulse shaping filter's frequency<br>
response, the medium channel coefficients calculated for the propagation channel, and the<br>
scaling factor. Because the filter response can be stored at the receiver based on a priori<br>
knowledge and the medium channel coefficient calculation can be made directly from<br>
pilot channel measurements, whitening filter determination reduces to the task of scaling<br><br>
factor determination. Basing scaling factor determination on the model fitting parameters<br>
of a parametric impairment correlation model offers one method of simplifying<br>
determination of the scaling factor. Using individualized signals—i.e., base-station-<br>
specific signals—from each of the base stations contributing to the inter-cell interference,<br>
if such signals are available, represents another simplified approach to calculating the<br>
scaling factor.<br>
In a circuit embodiment, a receiver circuit is configured to generate a whitening<br>
filter for a communication signal transmitted from a wireless communication network base<br>
station. The exemplary receiver circuit comprises a calculation circuit configured to<br>
calculate a scaling factor based on an estimated ratio of total base station transmit power to<br>
the PSD of inter-cell interference plus noise, and a filter circuit configured to determine a<br>
whitening filter for whitening the communication signal as a function of the scaling factor,<br>
a frequency response associated with a transmit pulse shaping filter used at the base<br>
station, and a frequency response of a propagation channel through which the<br>
communication signal is received.<br>
In one embodiment, the whitening filter is implemented as a receiver circuit that<br>
generates a filtered signal for input to a RAKE receiver. In this manner, colored<br>
interference in the communication signal is suppressed in advance of RAKE processing,<br>
which then provides multipath channel compensation and RAKE combining. In another<br>
embodiment, the whitening filter is implemented as part of a chip equalizer filter that also<br>
includes channel compensation filtering. In general, the whitening filter determination can<br>
be separate from, or part of, channel compensation filtering. Likewise, whitening filter<br>
circuit implementations can be separate from, or part of, channel compensation filter<br>
circuits.<br>
Thus, the advantageous whitening filter determination of the present invention may<br>
be practiced as part of two-step signal processing method, wherein whitening is applied to<br>
a received communication signal, and then channel compensation is applied, or a<br>
combined-step method wherein whitening and channel compensation are performed<br>
together. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that because such filtering processes are<br>
linear, the filtering order for channel compensation and whitening may be reversed as<br>
needed or desired.<br><br>
Of course, the present invention is not limited to the above features and<br>
advantages. Those skilled in the art will recognize additional features and advantages of<br>
the present invention upon reading the following detailed description and upon viewing<br>
the accompanying figures, in which like or similar elements are assigned like reference<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention addresses suppression of colored noise, and offers simplified<br>
whitening filter generation. By way of non-limiting example, then, the present invention<br>
can be implemented to significant advantage in the wireless communication device 10 of<br>
Fig. 1. Device 10 comprises a receiver 12, a transmitter 14, one or more antennas 16, a<br>
switch/duplexer 18, a system controller 20, and a user interface 22. Those skilled in the<br>
art will appreciate that the actual architecture of device 10 can be varied without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention, and that the illustrated architecture provides a<br>
non-limiting basis for discussing exemplary receiver operations.<br><br>
With that in mind, Fig. 2 illustrates a fundamental signal flow for the wireless<br>
transmission of data from a remote transmitter 24 to the receiver 12 of device 10.<br>
Transmitter 24 can be, for example, a base station transmitter in a wireless communication<br>
network. The received signal, r(t), comprises the transmitted signal, s(t), but with channel<br>
distortions caused by propagation through the transmission medium channel, G(ω), and<br>
with additive white noise. The medium channel imparts phase and attenuation distortions<br>
that generally must be compensated for at the receiver 12 via some form of channel<br>
compensation filter that applies the conjugate medium channel, represented as G*(ω), to<br>
the received communication signal. However, application of the channel compensation<br>
filter leaves the colored noise problem unaddressed. Colored noise in the received signal<br>
generally arises in the form of ISI and MAI.<br>
Therefore, Fig. 2 illustrates an optimal conceptual implementation of filtering at<br>
receiver 12 that addresses the "matched filter in colored noise" by providing a signal-<br>
whitening step followed by a matching step (matching to the composite of the true channel<br>
and the whitening filter). The whitening filter, W(ω), compensates the received<br>
communication signal for colored noise and the present invention provides an<br>
advantageous method and apparatus for determining it in a computationally efficient<br>
manner.<br>
Fig. 3 broadly illustrates an exemplary receiver circuit 30 that is configured to<br>
determine a whitening filter according to the present invention, and it may be configured<br>
to determine a channel compensation filter, as well. Indeed, the two filters may be<br>
determined together in some embodiments as a composite filter. It should be understood<br>
that receiver circuit 30 can be implemented as part of the receiver processing circuitry<br>
comprising receiver 12 of device 10, and that it can be embodied in hardware, software, or<br>
some combination thereof. For example, receiver circuit 30 may be implemented as a<br>
computer program comprising stored program instructions for execution by a<br>
microprocessor, digital signal processor, or some other digital processor, or the like.<br>
Alternatively, receiver circuit 30 may comprise all or part of an Application Specific<br>
Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Complex<br>
Programmable Logic Device (CPLD), or the like.<br>
Regardless, receiver circuit 30 can be implemented as part of the signal processing<br>
chain for the communication signal(s) received by receiver 12 of device 10. In particular,<br><br>
receiver circuit 30 can be configured to generate a filtered signal from the received<br>
communication signal, wherein the filtered signal serves as the input to a subsequent<br>
demodulation processor that demodulates/decodes the filtered signal to recover transmitted<br>
data bits, for example.<br>
Fig. 4 broadly illustrates exemplary whitening filter determination. While<br>
whitening may be done in either the time or frequency domains, a frequency domain<br>
representation of the desired whitening filter serves as the advantageous basis for reducing<br>
its calculation essentially to the determination of one unknown. In an exemplary Single-<br>
Input-Single-Output (SISO) context, this process is best understood by forming an<br>
exemplary composite filter as,<br><br>
where P(ω) equals the frequency response of the transmit pulse shaping filter associated<br>
with transmission of the received communication signal, P*(ω) equals the conjugate of<br>
that frequency response, i.e., it equals the receiver pulse shaping filter's frequency<br>
response, G(ω) equals the frequency response of the propagation channel through which<br>
the communication signal was received, G*(ω) equals the conjugate of that frequency<br>
response, Ior equals the total transmit power of the transmitter transmitting the<br>
communication signal (e.g., a network base station transmitter in a given cell or other<br>
coverage area), Φ(ω) equals the PSD of inter-cell interference plus noise at the receiver<br>
12, and A: is an arbitrary real constant.<br>
To cast Eq. (1) in terms of the conceptual optimal receiver filtering structure<br>
depicted in Fig. 2, one can rewrite the composite filter H(ω) as the product of the<br>
whitening and channel compensation filters:<br><br>
The form shown in Eq. (2) can be manipulated to provide more than one SISO<br>
embodiment of the invention, and can be simplified based on the assumption that P(ω) is<br>
known a priori by the receiver 12. That assumption is consistent with the practice of<br>
configuring receiver filtering to impart the conjugate response of the transmit pulse<br>
shaping filter. Such filter response information can be embodied in a fixed filter structure<br><br>
at the receiver 12, or can be based on filter response information stored at receiver 12 for use in a<br>
digital filtering algorithm.<br>
A further assumption with respect to Eq. (2) is the existence of a pilot channel (e.g.<br>
common pilot or CPICH in W-CDMA) and a means for estimating channel delays and net<br>
channel coefficients at the receiver 12. In other words, from Eq. (2), the frequency responses for<br>
the transmit and receiver pulse shaping filters, P(ω) and P*(ω) are known a priori at receiver 12,<br>
and the frequency responses for the net propagation channel and its conjugate, G(ω) and G*(ω),<br>
can be calculated directly from the pilot channel estimates. That leaves as unknowns the total<br>
transmit power Ior and the PSD of the inter-cell interference plus noise, Φ(ω).<br>
With the substitution the whitening filter representation is<br><br>
where y may be viewed as a frequency domain scaling factor for the whitening filter expression.<br>
Thus, whitening filter determination reduces to the determination of the y as the ratio of Ior to<br>
Φ(ω).<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates exemplary processing logic for determining the whitening filter, W(ω),<br>
or the time-domain embodiment of it, w(t), based on the scaling factor y. Exemplary processing<br>
begins with estimating Ior and Φ(ω) (Step 100). From there, processing continues with the<br>
calculation of y based on a ratio of the estimates for Ior and Φ(ω) (Step 102). With the scaling<br>
factor y thus determined, and with the transmit filter's frequency response known (or calculated),<br>
and with estimation of the medium channel's frequency response, the whitening filter can be<br>
determined according to Eq. (3) (Step 104).<br>
The above exemplary processing can be applied in the context of specific receiver<br>
structures. For example, Fig. 5 illustrates an exemplary chip-equalization embodiment of<br>
receiver 12. In this embodiment, receiver 12 comprises a receiver front-end 40, a searcher 42, a<br>
delay estimator 44, a channel estimator 46, pilot channel correlators 48, a medium channel<br>
estimator 50, a ratio estimator 52 to estimate the ratio of Ior /Φ(ω), a chip equalizer 54, and a<br>
traffic correlator 56.<br><br>
The chip-equalization filter implemented by chip equalizer 54 can be derived by<br>
rewriting Eq. (2) as<br><br>
Recognizing that P*(ω) represents the receive pulse shaping filter in the received<br>
signal processing path of receiver 12, a primary task for this embodiment lies in the<br>
determination of H'(ω). By modeling the other-cell interference plus noise term as a<br>
white Gaussian noise process with one-sided spectral density of NQ , H'(ω) can be<br>
rewritten as<br><br>
where y is now a real scale factor, and is equal to The magnitude of the scale factor<br>
k does not affect the optimality of the final chip equalizer and is therefore assigned an<br>
arbitrary value (e.g., 1). Thus, the main estimation task for the chip equalizer embodiment<br>
is to compute G(ω) and y.<br>
Considering the computation of G(ω) first, and per the above pilot channel<br>
assumptions, the receiver 12 estimates the channel delays and the net channel coefficients,<br>
which include the transmit/receive signal processing effects, as well as the medium<br>
(propagation) channel effects. Given L channel delays in a multipath propagation channel,<br>
the medium channel coefficients can be obtained from the net channel coefficients via<br><br>
where r1 is the ith channel delay indicated by the delay searcher, ECPICH equals an energy<br>
measurement of a common pilot channel (CPICH), g j equals the jth medium coefficient,<br><br>
c(rk) is the net channel coefficient at delay xk and Rp{x) represents the pulse shape<br>
correlation function given as £° pit + x)p* (x)dr. Eq. (6) can be rewritten in vector-matrix<br>
notation by absorbing the constant factor of ECPICH into the medium channel coefficient as<br><br>
Eq. (7) can be solved by direct matrix inversion or by application of an iterative<br>
technique, such as Gauss-Seidel. The solution yields medium channel coefficients at the<br>
path delays. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) can then be applied to the time domain<br>
medium coefficients to obtain the frequency response G(ω) of the medium channel. Thus,<br>
one or more FFT circuits can be included as part of receiver 12.<br>
In considering the calculation of the scaling factor y, receiver 12 can be<br>
configured to use a pilot channel-based estimation technique that is based on a parametric<br>
model of the received communication signal's impairment correlations. An exemplary<br>
parametric model is disclosed in the co-pending patent application, which is assigned<br>
Serial No. 10/800,167, and which was filed on March 12, 2004. That application is<br>
incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
While the above-identified application includes additional background and<br>
explanatory details, an exemplary parametric model of communication signal impairment<br>
correlations includes one or more impairment terms, each scaled by a model fitting<br>
parameter. The model fitting parameters are then updated on a recurring basis as part of<br>
an ongoing fitting process wherein the model is fitted to impairment correlation estimates.<br>
In more detail, an exemplary parametric model can be expressed as<br><br>
where R? represents an interference correlation term (matrix) scaled by the first model<br>
fitting parameter a and R# represents a noise correlation term (matrix) scaled by the<br>
second model fitting parameter /?. The model fitting parameters are adapted during a<br>
fitting process—e.g., during a Least Squares (LS) fitting process, wherein the model<br>
fitting parameters are adapted to minimize the model error.<br>
It can be shown that a = 1 l(Ec I Ior )CPICH, where (Ec I Ior )CPICH represents the<br>
fraction of the base station energy given to the common pilot channel, and J3 = N0. Thus,<br>
given an estimate of the pilot channel power and the values a and (5, the parameter y can<br>
be determined from<br><br><br>
where E{*} represents statistical expectation, and g represents a scaled medium<br>
coefficient estimate. A statistical approximation can be used to solve the estimation<br>
problem for y. An exemplary method is given as<br><br>
In the above expression, ICPICH(N) is the pilot channel power at time index n (some<br>
multiple of the pilot symbol rate) and X is a value between 0 and 1.<br>
With the above in mind, then, the receiver embodiment illustrated in Fig. 5 may be<br>
configured such that is operative to cany out whitening filter generation in accordance<br>
with the present invention based on a number of exemplary processing steps. Those steps<br>
include these items:<br>
•	estimate channel delays by using searcher 42 and delay estimator 44;<br>
•	estimate net channel coefficients via channel estimator 46;<br>
•	estimate the scaled version of medium coefficients using equations (6) and (7)<br>
as implemented in medium channel estimator 50;<br>
•	estimate a and β using parametric modeling of received signal impairment<br>
correlations in receiver circuit 30, an embodiment of which may be<br>
implemented as part of chip equalizer 54;<br>
•	compute medium coefficients as g = org in chip equalizer 54;<br>
•	compute FFT of g to get G(ω), which may be done in chip equalizer 54;<br>
•	compute y from Eqs. (9) and (10), which may be done in chip equalizer 54;<br>
and<br>
•	compute chip equalizer filter from Eq. (5), which may be done in chip<br>
equalizer 54.<br>
Note that chip equalizer may include one or more processing circuits configured to carry<br>
out the above whitening/composite filter calculations. Further, note that the final filter<br>
obtained from the last step can be implemented in either the time or frequency domain,<br>
and received communication signal filtering as described herein can be carried out in<br>
either the time domain, or the frequency domain.<br><br>
In any case, the single traffic correlator 56 operates on the filtered (whitened and<br>
channel equalized) signal output by chip equalizer 54. More particularly, traffic correlator<br>
56 computes estimates of the transmitted symbols contained in the received<br>
communication signal, r', which is input to the chip equalizer 54 from the receiver front-<br>
end 40. As such, receiver front-end 40 can include low-noise amplifiers, filters, analog-to-<br>
digital-converters, and other circuits as needed or desired to produce a digital samples<br>
representing the received communication signal.<br>
The present invention also can be implemented in an "over-whitening plus RAKE"<br>
embodiment, wherein an over-whitening filter provides a filtered version of the received<br>
communication signal for subsequent processing by a RAKE receiver. The over-<br>
whitening filter suppresses colored noise from the received communication signal before<br>
RAKE processing, thus improving the performance of RAKE combining.<br>
In support of this RAKE-based embodiment of the present invention, Eq. (2) can be<br>
rewritten as<br><br>
Again, P (ω) represents the receive pulse shape filter, and G (ω) represents<br>
channel compensation as implemented in the RAKE receiver circuit. Thus, as with the<br>
chip equalization embodiment of Fig. 5, the primary effort for this embodiment lies in the<br>
determination of W(ω) As before, by modeling the inter-cell interference plus noise term<br>
as a white Gaussian noise process with one-sided spectral density of NQ , the whitening<br>
filter W(ω) can be rewritten as<br><br>
The scale factor k in the numerator does not affect the optimality of the final result,<br>
so it can be assigned a convenient value, such as "1." The same methods for computing<br>
G(ω) and y described above can be used here, and may be implemented in an exemplary<br>
RAKE-based embodiment of receiver 12, such as illustrated in Fig. 6.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, receiver 12 comprises a receiver front-end circuit 60, a<br>
searcher 62, a delay estimator 64, a channel estimator 66, pilot channel correlators 68, a<br><br>
medium channel estimator 70, a ratio estimator 72 to estimate an over-whitening<br>
filter 74, and a RAKE receiver circuit 76, including a plurality of traffic correlators<br>
("fingers") 78, and a RAKE combining circuit 80. Note that the over-whitening filter 74<br>
can be configured to include some or all of the functionality of the earlier-depicted<br>
receiver circuit 30, and thus is adapted to carry out whitening filter determination.<br>
That determination can be carried out according to an overall processing method<br>
similar to that described for the chip equalization embodiment. Specifically, an exemplary<br>
receiver processing method in the RAKE-based embodiment comprises these steps:<br>
•	estimate channel delays by using searcher 62 and delay estimator 64;<br>
•	estimate net channel coefficients via channel estimator 66;<br>
•	estimate the scaled version of medium coefficients using equations (6) and (7)<br>
as implemented in medium channel estimator 70;<br>
•	estimate a and β using parametric modeling of received signal impairment<br>
correlations in receiver circuit 30, an embodiment of which may be<br>
implemented as part of over-whitening filter 74;<br>
•	compute medium coefficients as g = ag in over-whitening filter 74;<br>
•	compute FFT of g to get G(ω), which may be done in over-whitening filter 74;<br>
•	compute y from Eqs. (9) and (10), which may be done in over-whitening filter<br>
74;and<br>
•	compute over-whitening filter from Eq. (12)—note that the final filter can be<br>
implemented in either the time or frequency domain; and<br>
•	RAKE combine over-whitened communication signal to compute estimates of<br>
the transmitted symbols within the received communication signal—i.e.,<br>
despread the over-whitened signal in each of one or more fingers 78<br>
according to multipath delays, and combine the finger outputs to form a<br>
RAKE-combined signal for subsequent demodulation processing.<br>
While the above RAKE-based embodiment, and the earlier described chip-<br>
equalization embodiment, represent exemplary SISO embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the present invention can be readily extended to Single-Input-Multiple-Output<br>
(SIMO) embodiments. Fig. 7 illustrates an exemplary SIMO embodiment, wherein<br>
receiver 12 of device 10 includes M receive antennas (16-1 through 16-M), and the kth<br><br>
antenna receives Sk(t). The antennas 16 are coupled to one or more receiver processing<br>
circuits 82, which may be configured to implement an embodiment of the earlier<br>
illustrated receiver circuit 30 for whitening filter determination.<br>
In operation, each antenna 16-k receives signal Sk(t), which is obtained by passing<br>
the data signal s(t) through propagation channel k. The impulse response of the<br>
propagation channel from the base station (BTS) transmitter to the kth receive antenna at<br>
receiver 12 is denoted by gk(t) with Fourier transform Gk(ω). Therefore, the noise-free<br>
signal at the kth antenna is given by<br><br>
where * denotes convolution. Considering Eq. (13), the total received signal at the kth<br>
antenna can be expressed as<br><br>
Here, vk (t) is a noise that models inter-cell interference and thermal noise at the<br>
kth antenna.<br>
It can be shown that a decision statistic for detecting data symbols has the form<br><br>
where yk it) is the signal at the kth antenna after despreading the received signal rk(t), and<br>
where h(t,k~) is the impulse response of the linear filter with frequency response<br><br>
Noting that Eq. (15) essentially describes a receiver with M parallel sub-channels,<br>
it is advantageous to rewrite (16) in the form<br>
where <br>
One can observe that the over-whitening filter in the above SIMO embodiment is<br>
common across antennas 16, and the receiver structure illustrated in Fig. 8 represents an<br>
exemplary capitalization on that commonality. In Fig. 8, receiver 12 is implemented as a<br><br>
beamformer comprising a RAKE receiver circuit 84-k for each antenna 16-k, each circuit<br>
84-k including a pulse shaping filter P*(ω) and a channel compensation filter Gk*(ω),a<br>
RAKE combining circuit 86 for additively combining the antenna streams (the RAKE<br>
outputs), and an over-whitening filter circuit 88 for over-whitening the RAKE combined<br>
signal output from combiner circuit 86 by applying the over-whitening filter W{ω).<br>
It should be noted that the RAKE receiver circuits 84 can include, or can be<br>
associated with, one or more FFT circuits for converting the received communication<br>
signal to a frequency domain for processing, or the above filters can be transformed into<br>
the time domain for application to the time-domain received communication. Likewise,<br>
the over-whitening filter implemented by circuit 88 can be determined based on the<br>
exemplary frequency domain processing described herein, but applied to the received<br>
communication signal in either the time or frequency domain.<br>
Further, because of the linear nature of the described processing, over-whitening<br>
could be performed in advance of each RAKE receiver circuit 84-1—i.e., the filtering<br>
order could be swapped. While swapping the order might require replication of the over-<br>
whitening filter in each RAKE processing path, such an arrangement may be advantageous<br>
in some design implementations. For example, if the over-whitening-plus-RAKE<br>
embodiment of Fig. 6 is implemented in modular integrated-circuit form, e.g., for<br>
ASIC/FPGA implementation, that basic module could be replicated as many times as<br>
needed for a given SIMO receiver implementation.<br>
For the illustrated SIMO embodiment, the other-cell interference plus noise PSD<br>
term again can be modeled as a white Gaussian noise process with one-sided spectral<br>
density of No. Using this model, Eq. (18) can be rewritten in the form<br><br>
As with the SISO embodiments, the scale factor in the numerator does not affect<br>
the optimality of the final result, so it can be assigned a value of 1, for example. Again,<br>
then, the primary computational task for whitening filter determination lies with<br>
calculation of the scaling factory (and with the computation of Gk {w ) on which<br>
7 depends).<br><br>
An exemplary processing method for whitening filter determination in the SIMO<br>
embodiment is similar to the SISO method(s) described earlier. Such processing includes<br>
these steps:<br>
•	For each antenna 16-k:<br>
o Estimate channel delays;<br>
o Estimate net channel coefficients;<br>
o Estimate scaled version of medium coefficients using Eqs. (6) and (7);<br>
o Estimate ak and pk using parametric modeling (or using direct<br>
estimation);<br>
o Compute medium coefficients as gk = agk;<br>
o Compute FFT of gk to get Gk(ω);<br>
o Rake combine traffic data;<br>
o Compute yk from equations (9) and (10);<br>
•	Compute final estimate of y as the arithmetic mean of the yk, or by selecting<br>
one of the yk;<br>
•	Compute the over-whitening filter from Eq. (19)—note that the final filter can<br>
be implemented in either the time or frequency domain; and<br>
•	Filter the combined signal with over-whitening filter to compute estimates of<br>
transmitted symbols contained in the received communication signal.<br>
Thus, the receiver processing steps for the exemplary SIMO embodiment are<br>
similar to the processing steps for the exemplary SISO embodiments (RAKE, chip<br>
equalizer), with the exception that some of the processing is done on a per-antenna basis<br>
for SIMO. Regardless, those skilled in the art should appreciate that the present invention<br>
provides an advantageous basis for whitening filter computation based on a frequency<br>
domain representation of the whitening filter that reduces essentially to one unknown,<br>
namely, a scaling factor that depends on an estimate of the ratio of total transmitter<br>
power, Ior, to the PSD of other-cell interference plus noise, Φ(ω).<br>
While that ratio can be estimated using the model fitting parameters from a<br>
parametric model of received signal impairment correlations as described herein, it also<br>
can be directly estimated from a direct estimate of total transmit power, and from a direct<br>
estimate of the inter-cell interference plus noise. The direct estimate of total transmit<br>
power can be based on a value received from the base station, or estimated from the pilot<br><br>
power, or based on some configured value. The direct estimate of inter-cell interference<br>
plus noise can be based on signal measurements, such as where each base station is<br>
configured to transmit an individualized signal, much like a training sequence burst, or<br>
other identifying data pattern, from which the device 10 can generate inter-cell<br>
interference measurements based on receiving such signals from each of one or more<br>
neighboring base station transmitters.<br>
However, regardless of whether the ratio used for calculation of the scaling factor y<br>
is indirectly estimated based on parametric modeling, the present invention provides many<br>
advantages with respect to its method of whitening filter determination. For example, the<br>
chip equalizer embodiment of Fig. 5, and the RAKE receiver embodiment of Fig. 6 can be<br>
generally considered as "RAKE plus filter" implementations that can be cleanly realized<br>
in modular chip set-type integrated circuit structures, or embodied as synthesizable library<br>
modules for use in chip design software. For example, a basic chipset would include a<br>
RAKE receiver circuit, and a higher-performance embodiment would add the over-<br>
whitening filter function. Since the over-whitening filter function can be implemented in<br>
hardware or software, or some combination thereof, the present invention provides system<br>
designers with significant design flexibility.<br>
It should be understood, then, that the present invention broadly provides a method<br>
and apparatus for whitening filter determination in the context of received communication<br>
signal processing. While the present invention can be implemented in conjunction with<br>
RAKE receiver structures and chip equalization receiver structures, it is not limited to<br>
those embodiments, nor is it limited to SISO or SIMO systems, as it has broad<br>
applicability across a range of receiver types and system arrangements. Thus, the present<br>
invention is not limited by the foregoing discussion, nor by the accompanying figures, but<br>
rather is limited only by the following claims and their reasonable legal equivalents.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CALCULATING<br>
WHITENING FILTERS IN COMMUNICATION SIGNAL PROCESSING<br>
APPLICATION<br>
A frequency domain representation of a whitening filter is made to depend on essentially one<br>
unknown, namely, a scaling factor that is based on an estimated ratio of total base station<br>
power to the power spectral density (PSD) of inter-cell interference plus noise. In turn, that<br>
scaling factor can be computed based on the modeling terms used in a parametric model of the<br>
impairment correlations for a received communication signal. Preferably, the model comprises<br>
an interference impairment term scaled by a first model fitting parameter, and a noise<br>
impairment term scaled by a second model fitting parameter. Further, the scaling factor can be<br>
computed by directly estimating total base station transmit power and the PSD of inter-cell<br>
interference plus noise. In any case, the whitening filter can be used in whitening a received<br>
communication signal in conjunction with channel equalization processing or RAKE receiver<br>
processing, for example.</td>
