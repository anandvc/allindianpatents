**********************<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of<br>
naphthoquinones, in particular a process for the preparation of 2,3-<br>
disubstituted 1,4-naphthoquinones, in the trans configuration.<br>
2,3-trans-disubstituted 1,4-naphthoquinones are known as therapeutic agents.<br>
EP 77551 and EP 123238 describe 2,3-disubstituted 1,4-naphthoquinones, in<br>
particular 2-(cyclohexyl-substituted)-3-hydroxy in trans configuration which<br>
are prepared by epimerization of the corresponding cis/trans mixture. EP<br>
77551 describes in particular the epimerization with concentrated sulfuric acid<br>
at 50-70°C over a period ranging from 6 hours to several days. In example 5,<br>
EP 77551 reports the results of some epimerization reactions conducted on the<br>
derivative 2-(4-terbutyl-cyclohexyl)-3-hydroxy, at 50°C, 56°C and 70°C over<br>
a period ranging from 4 hours to 4 days; the cis/trans ratio obtained is<br>
specified but not the reaction yields.<br>
The present inventors have ascertained that the above-described reactions<br>
result in a considerable degradation of the product and the corresponding<br>
yields of the required product are consequently very low.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the<br>
preparation of 2-(cyclohexyl-substituted)-3-hydroxy disubstituted 1,4-<br>
naphthoquinones, in the trans configuration, which allows higher yields to be<br>
obtained.<br>
This and further objects of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
below.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, according to one of its aspects, the present invention concerns a process<br>
for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) in the trans configuration<br><br>
wherein R' is hydrogen and R" is selected from hydrogen C1-6-alkyl, C1-6-<br>
alkoxy, aryl-C1-6-alkoxy, C1-6-alkyl-C1-6-alkoxy, halogen, perhalo-C1-6-alkyl<br>
and phenyl optionally substituted with one or two groups chosen from atoms<br>
of halogen and Chalkyl,<br>
which comprises reacting a compound of formula (II), in the cis form or as a<br>
cis/trans mixture,<br><br>
wherein R' and R" are as defined above, and R"' is an atom of hydrogen or a<br>
Pr protecting group hydrolysable in an acid environment with concentrated<br>
sulfuric acid at a temperature below +20°C.<br>
According to the present invention, the term "C1-6-alkyl" designates a linear or<br>
branched alkyl, containing from 1 to 6 atoms of carbon, for example methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, t-butyl, etc.<br>
According to the present invention, the term "C1-6-alcoxy" designates a linear<br>
or branched alkoxyl, containing from 1 to 6 atoms of carbon.<br>
According to the present invention, the term "halogen" designates a halogen<br>
chosen from chlorine, bromine, fluorine or iodine, the chlorine being<br>
preferred.<br>
According to the present invention, the term "perhalo" indicates the<br>
substitution of all the atoms of hydrogen of the alkyl group with atoms of<br>
halogen.<br>
As "compound of formula (I) in the trans configuration" it is intended that the<br>
substituents in positions 1 and 4 of the cyclohexyl, i.e. the naphthoquinone<br>
substituent and R" are in the trans configuration.<br>
As "compound of formula (I) in the cis configuration" it is intended that the<br>
substituents in positions 1 and 4 of the cyclohexyl, i.e. the naphthoquinone<br>
substituent and R" are in the cis configuration.<br>
As "cis/trans mixture" it is intended that a mixture of compounds in the cis<br>
and trans configuration, as defined above, is present, in any relative ratio.<br>
As a consequence, the expression "compound of formula (II), in cis form or in<br>
a cis/trans mixture" indicates, according to the present invention, that the<br>
starting compound of formula (H) is used as a pure cis conformer or as a<br>
mixture of cis/trans conformers in any relative ratio.<br>
According to a preferred aspect, R" is a phenyl group, optionally substituted<br>
with an atom of halogen.<br>
According to a particularly preferred aspect, R" is a 4-chloro-phenyl group.<br>
The compound of formula (I) thus defined is a compound commercially<br>
available and is known under the CNN "atovaquone".<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, R" is a tert-butyl group. The<br>
compound of formula (I) thus defined is a compound commercially available<br>
and is known under the INN "buparvaquone".<br>
The Pr hydrolysable protecting group is a protecting group of the hydroxy<br>
function which can be hydrolysed in an acid environment and is preferably<br>
chosen from the acylic groups, whether aliphatic or aromatic, for example an<br>
acetyl, a benzoyl, etc..<br>
A preferred Pr group is the acetyl group.<br>
The term "concentrated sulfuric acid" here defines a sulfuric acid having a<br>
titer above 90%, for example equal to or higher than 96%.<br>
According to the present invention, the expression "at a temperature below<br>
ambient temperature" indicates a temperature below +20°C preferably below<br>
+15°C.<br>
Advantageously the reaction is conducted at a temperature between -10°C and<br>
+10°C, for example between 0°C and +5°C.<br>
Even when not explicitly indicated, when the sign "-" is not present, the<br>
temperatures are above zero according to the present invention.<br>
In practice, the concentrated sulfuric acid is cooled to the chosen reaction<br>
temperature and the compound of formula (II) is slowly added, maintaining<br>
the temperature below +20°C.<br>
The compound of formula (IT)/concentrated sulfuric acid proportions are not<br>
critical and are preferably between 1/2 and 1/40 (p/w), advantageously<br>
between 1/10 and 1/20, for example approximately 1/18.<br>
Contrarily to the teachings of the prior art referred to previously, it has been<br>
observed that the reaction is complete in a short time, sometimes in only<br>
approximately thirty minutes. A person skilled in the art can follow the course<br>
of the reaction by means of the known methods, verifying the disappearance<br>
of the cis isomer.<br>
Thus, combining a low temperature with a shorter reaction duration,<br>
particularly advantageous reaction yields can be obtained, especially when<br>
compared with the yields obtained according to the known art. In the<br>
experimental section of the present description, comparative examples are<br>
given to demonstrate the significant improvements of the present invention<br>
with respect to the processes of the prior art.<br>
As mentioned, said epimerization reaction must be conducted at temperatures<br>
below 20°C, advantageously below +15°C, to prevent the formation of<br>
excessive reaction by-products.<br>
The experimental section of the present description provides the details of the<br>
comparative reactions conducted to verify the progress of and yields obtained<br>
by the epimerization reactions at temperatures above ambient temperature and<br>
direct alkylation of the non hydroxy-protected Iawsone. The comparative<br>
examples confirm that the process of the invention offers the important<br>
advantages described above.<br>
The compound of formula (I) in trans form thus obtained can be isolated and<br>
purified according to the methods known in the art, for example by extraction<br>
from the reaction environment in an appropriate solvent and purification by<br>
crystallization or chromatography column. Operating examples are provided<br>
in the following experimental section.<br>
The compound of formula (II) in cis or cis/trans form can be prepared<br>
according to the methods known in the art, starling from hydroxy-protected<br>
Iawsone (2-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinone), preferably as also described in EP<br>
77551 and EP 123238.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the invention concerns a process which<br>
comprises:<br>
(a) reacting a compound of formula (III)<br>
The present invention therefore offers a double advantage as it permits the<br>
elimination of a synthesis step and, as a consequence of the elimination of said<br>
step, i.e. epimerizing the protected hydroxy] group, it provides a superior<br>
reaction yield.<br>
The processes of the invention are particularly useful for the preparation of<br>
atovaquone and buparvaquone.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of the 2-Acetoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (Acetyl-Lawsone).<br>
595 g (5.89 moles) of triethylamine are added dropwise in 30 minutes to a<br>
suspension of 500 g (2.87 moles) of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (lawsone)<br>
in 2200 ml of ethyl acetate, cooled to +5°C, maintaining the temperature<br>
below +10°C. At the end of the dripping a dark red solution is obtained. The<br>
solution is kept at +5-10°C for 30 minutes. 550 g (5.39 moles) of acetic<br>
anhydride are added dropwise in 30 minutes, maintaining the temperature<br>
between +5 and +10°C. At the end of the dripping, the mixture is left under<br>
agitation at +5°C for 4 hours. The solid is filtered and washed with a mixture<br>
of 250 ml of ethyl acetate and 250 ml of hexane pre-cooled to +5°C. The<br>
damp product is dried at +40°C at reduced pressure for 6 hours providing 496<br>
g (yield 80%) of 2-acetoxy-l,4-naphthoquinone (acetyl-lawsone) as a yellow<br>
solid with melting point -131°-134°C.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of the 2-[4-(p-chiorophenyl)-cycloliexyl]-3-acetoxy-1,4-<br>
naphthoquinone (CIS/TRANS acetyl-atovaquone).<br>
100 g (0.46 moles) of 2-acetoxy-l,4-naphthoquinone and 88.4 g (0.37 moles)<br>
of 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid are added to 560 ml of<br>
acetonitrile. The mixture is left under agitation at 20-25°C for 10 minutes. A<br>
solution of 20.4 g (0.12 moles) of silver nitrate in 133 ml of deionised water is<br><br>
in which Pr is as defined above, with a group of formula (IV)<br><br>
in which R' and R" are as defined above, in conditions of radical<br>
oxidative coupling, for example in the presence of silver nitrate and<br>
ammonium persulfate;<br>
(b) performing an epimerization reaction as defined above on the<br>
compound of formula (II), in which R'" is a Pr group thus obtained.<br>
It appears clear that another important advantage of the present epimerization<br>
reaction with respect to the prior art derives from the observation that it is not<br>
necessary to eliminate the hydroxy protecting group, essential for correct<br>
performance of the reaction of phase (a) as above, before proceeding with the<br>
epimerization. As said, the epimerization step is successfully performed also<br>
in the presence of the Pr protecting group which, moreover, is eliminated<br>
simultaneously with the epimerization.<br>
This important characteristic of the invention had never been taken into<br>
consideration in the prior art documents which, on the contrary, specified that<br>
hydrolysis of any protecting group present should be performed before<br>
proceeding with the epimerization.<br>
added. The mixture is heated to reflux temperature (78-80°C); a solution of<br>
179 g (0.8 moles) of ammonium persulfate in 600 ml of deionised water is<br>
added dropwise in approximately 1 hour. At the end of the dripping, the<br>
mixture is left under agitation for 2 hours at reflux temperature. It is cooled to<br>
70°C, 1000 ml of toluene are added and the mixture is left under agitation at<br>
60-70°C for 10 minutes. The phases are separated and the organic phase is<br>
washed three times with 500 ml of water for each wash. The organic phase is<br>
filtered and concentrated to 1/3 of the initial volume by distillation of the<br>
toluene at reduced pressure. It is cooled to 20-25°C and left under agitation for<br>
12-14 hours; the temperature is then brought to 0-5°C and maintained for 1<br>
hour. The solid is filtered and washed with 20 ml of toluene pre-cooled to<br>
+5°C and then with 20 ml of acetone. The damp product is dried at 40°C for 6-<br>
8 hours, providing 44 g of acetyl-atovaquone mainly in the CIS configuration<br>
(melting point 197-200°C). 400 ml of acetone are added to the crystallisation<br>
mother liquor and the mixture is left under agitation at 20-25°C for 16 hours.<br>
It is cooled to 0-5°C and left at said temperature for 2 hours. The solid is<br>
filtered and washed with 10 ml of acetone pre-cooled to 5°C. The damp<br>
product is dried at 40°C for 6-8 hours providing 19 g of acetyl-atovaquone<br>
mainly in the TRANS configuration (melting point 150-155°C). The two dried<br>
solids are re-combined to give 63 g of CIS/TRANS acetyl-atovaquone (yield<br>
41.7%).<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of the 2-[trans-4-(p-chlorophenyl)-cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-1,4-<br>
naphthoquinone (atovaquone) by epimerization and deprotection of the<br>
CIS/TRANS acetyl-atovaquone with concentrated sulfuric acid at 0-5°C.<br>
20 g (48.9 mmoles) of CIS/TRANS acetyl-atovaquone are added portionwise<br>
in 15 minutes to 200 ml of sulfuric acid 96% pre-cooled to 0°C. During the<br>
addition the internal temperature is maintained at 0-5°C. At the end of the<br>
addition it is left under agitation at 0-5°C for 30 minutes and the temperature<br>
is then left to rise spontaneously to 20-25°C. The reaction mixture is poured<br>
slowly onto 500 ml of water pre-cooled to +5°C without exceeding the<br>
internal temperature of25°C. 600 ml of methyl ethyl ketone are added and the<br>
mixture is heated to 60°C. The acid aqueous phase is separated and the organic<br>
phase is washed with 100 ml of water, maintaining the temperature at 50-<br>
60°C. The organic phase is concentrated to approximately half the initial<br>
volume by distillation of the solvent at atmospheric pressure. It is gradually<br>
cooled to 0-5°C and maintained cold for 1 hour. The solid is filtered and<br>
washed with 20 ml of cold methyl ethyl ketone. The damp product is dried at<br>
45°C at reduced pressure for 6-8 hours providing 12 g of atovaquone (yield<br>
67%). The raw product is purified by crystallisation from 180 ml of methyl<br>
ethyl ketone obtaining an atovaquone having a melting point of 220-223 °C.<br>

7.2-8.2 (8H, m)<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of the atovaquone by epimerization and deprotection of the<br>
CIS/TRANS acetyl-atovaquone with concentrated sulfuric acid at +15°C<br>
8 g (19.6 mmoles) of CIS/TRANS acetyl-atovaquone are added portionwise in<br>
15 minutes to 80 ml of sulfuric acid 96% at +15°C. At the end of the addition<br>
it is left under agitation at 15°C for 30 minutes and the temperature is then<br>
brought to 20-25°C. The reaction mixture is poured slowly onto 230 ml of<br>
water pre-cooled to 5°C without exceeding the internal temperature of 25°C.<br>
160 ml of toluene are added and the mixture is heated to 70°C. The acid<br>
aqueous phase is separated and the organic phase is washed with a solution of<br>
8 g of sodium chloride in 40 ml of water, maintaining the temperature at 60°C.<br>
The organic phase is concentrated to approximately 1/3 of the initial volume<br>
by distillation of the solvent at atmospheric pressure. It is gradually cooled to<br>
0-5°C and maintained cool for 1 hour. The solid is filtered and washed with 10<br>
ml of cold toluene. The damp product is dried at 45°C at reduced pressure for<br>
6-8 hours, providing 6.08 g of atovaquone (yield 76%) with HPLC purity &gt;<br>
99%.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of the atovaquone by epimerization of the CIS/TRANS<br>
atovaquone with concentrated sulfuric acid at +5°C.<br>
8 g (21.8 mmoles) of CIS/TRANS atovaquone in a ratio of 58/42 are added<br>
portionwise in 15 minutes to 80 ml of sulfuric acid 96% at +5°C. At the end of<br>
the addition it is left under agitation at 5°C for 30 minutes and the temperature<br>
is then brought to 20-25°C. The reaction mixture is poured slowly onto 230 ml<br>
of water pre-cooled to 5°C without exceeding the internal temperature of<br>
25°C. 340 ml of methyl ethyl ketone are added and the mixture is heated to<br>
70°C. The acid aqueous phase is separated and the organic phase is washed<br>
with a solution of 8 g of sodium chloride in 80 ml of water, maintaining the<br>
temperature at 60°C. The organic phase is concentrated to approximately 1/6<br>
of the initial volume by distillation of the solvent at atmospheric pressure. It is<br>
gradually cooled to 0-5°C and maintained cold for 1 hour. The solid is filtered<br>
and washed with 10 ml of water. The damp product is dried at 45°C at reduced<br>
pressure for 6-8 hours, providing 6.5 g of atovaquone (yield 81%) with HPLC<br>

Example 6 (comparative)<br>
Preparation of the atovaquone by epimerization and deprotection of the<br>
CIS/TRANS acetyl-atovaquone with concentrated sulfuric acid at 50°C.<br>

10 g (57 mmoles) of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 20.5 g (85.9 mmoles) of<br>
4-(4-chlorophenyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and 6 g (35 mmoles) of silver<br>
nitrate are added to 150 ml of acetonitrile and 150 ml of water. The mixture is<br>
heated to reflux temperature (75-80°C) and a solution of 18 g (79 mmoles) of<br>
ammonium persulfate in 100 ml of deionised water is then added dropwise in<br>
approximately 1 hour. At the end of the dripping, it is left under agitation for 2<br>
hours at reflux temperature. The reaction mixture is sampled and the HPLC<br>
analysis highlights a very low conversion (5-10%) with significant formation<br>
of by-products. A further 9 g of ammonium persulfate and 3 g of silver nitrate<br>
are added and left at reflux for a further 4 hours. The mixture is sampled again<br>
but the HPLC analysis does not highlight any substantial change in the<br>
previous situation: conversion approximately 10% and presence of by-<br>
products.<br>
