Brief Description of the Figures<br>
FIG. 1 shows HPLC separations of racemic compound 21b (Scheme II)<br>
and the R-enantiomer of compound 21b using Chirobiotic T250 x 4.6 mm, 65%<br>
H2O,35% CH3OH, 20 mM NH4NO3 at 1 mL/min with detection at 250 nm.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that compounds of the<br>
invention having a chiral center may exist in and be isolated in optically active<br>
and racemic forms. Some compounds may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be<br>
understood that the present invention encompasses any racemic, optically-active,<br>
polymorphic, or stereoisomeric form, or mixtures thereof, of a compound of the<br>
invention, which possess the useful properties described herein, it being well<br>
known in the art how to prepare optically active forms (for example, by<br>
resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, by synthesis from<br>
optically-active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic<br>
separation using a chiral stationary phase) and how to determine antitumor<br>
activity using the standard tests described herein, or using other similar tests<br>
which are well known in the art.<br>
A specific value for Y is fluoro.<br>
Another specific value for Y is chloro.<br>
Another specific value for Y is bromo.<br>
Another specific value for Y is methoxy (-OMe)<br>
A specific group of compounds of Formula I are compounds wherein the<br>
carbon bearing the methyl group is in the (S) configuration.<br>
A preferred group of compounds of Formula I are compounds wherein<br>
the carbon bearing the methyl group is in the (R) configuration.<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention are 2-[4-(7-chloroquinolin-2-<br>
yloxy)phenoxy]propanoic acid (compound 21b); 2-[4-(7-bromoquinolin-2-<br>
yloxy)phenoxy]propanoic acid (compound 21c); 2-[4-(7-fluoroquinolin-2-<br>
yloxy)phenoxy]propanoic acid (compound 21a) and the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof (e.g., compounds 22a, 22b and 22c). More preferably,<br>
the compounds of the invention are (R) 2-[4-(7-chloroquinolin-2-<br>
yloxy)phenoxy]propanoic acid (compound 21b), or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof (e.g., compound 22b), and (R) 2-[4-(7-bromoquinolin-2-<br>
yloxy)phenoxy]propanoic acid (compound 21c), or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof (e.g., compound 22c).<br>
In cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable<br>
nontoxic acid or base salts, administration of the compounds as salts may be<br>
appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid<br>
addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion,<br>
for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate,<br>
succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, a-ketoglutarate, and a-glycerophosphate.<br>
Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate,<br>
nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard<br>
procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic<br>
compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically<br>
acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or<br>
alkaline earth metal (for example, calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be<br>
made.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be formulated as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient in<br>
a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or<br>
parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.<br>
Thus, the present compounds may be systemically administered, e.g.,<br>
orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an<br>
inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or<br>
soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be<br>
incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic<br>
administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more<br>
excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches,<br>
capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions<br>
and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The<br>
percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and<br>
may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit<br>
dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful<br>
compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.<br>
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the<br>
following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin;<br>
excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as com<br>
starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium<br>
stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame<br>
or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring<br>
may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in<br>
addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or<br>
a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to<br>
otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance,<br>
tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and<br>
the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose<br>
as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and<br>
flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in<br>
preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and<br>
substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active<br>
compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.<br>
The active compound may also be administered intravenously or<br>
intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or<br>
its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant.<br>
Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols,<br>
triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage<br>
and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of<br>
microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can<br>
include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the<br>
active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile<br>
injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in<br>
liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and<br>
stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or<br>
vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example,<br>
water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid<br>
polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and<br>
suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example,<br>
by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in<br>
the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action<br>
of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thiomersal,<br>
and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for<br>
example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the<br>
injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of<br>
agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active<br>
compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the<br>
other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization.<br>
In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions,<br>
the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying<br>
techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional<br>
desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.<br>
For topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in pure<br>
form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to<br>
administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination<br>
with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.<br>
Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay,<br>
macrocrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers<br>
include water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), alcohols or glycols or water-<br>
alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or<br>
dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants.<br>
Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to<br>
optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be<br>
applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings,<br>
or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.<br>
Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and<br>
esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also<br>
be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments,<br>
soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.<br>
Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to<br>
deliver the compounds of formula I to the skin are known to the art; for example,<br>
see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478),<br>
Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).<br>
Useful dosages of the compounds of formula I can be determined by<br>
comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods<br>
for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans<br>
are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat No. 4,938,949.<br>
The amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof,<br>
required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected<br>
but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being<br>
treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the<br>
discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.<br>
The compound is conveniently administered in unit dosage form; for<br>
example, containing 5 to 1,000 mg/m2, conveniently 10 to 750 mg/m2, most<br>
conveniently, 50 to 500 mg/m2 of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as<br>
divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three,<br>
four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g.,<br>
into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations.<br>
The compounds of the invention are effective anti-tumor agents and have<br>
higher potency and/or reduced toxicity as compared to XK 469. Preferably,<br>
compounds of the invention are more potent and less toxic than (R) XK 469,<br>
and/or avoid a potential site of catabolic metabolism encountered with XK469,<br>
i.e., have a different metabolic profile than XK469.<br>
The present invention provides therapeutic methods of treating cancer in<br>
a mammal, which involve administering to a mammal having cancer an effective<br>
amount of a compound or a composition of the invention. A mammal includes a<br>
primate, human, rodent, canine, feline, bovine, ovine, equine, swine, caprine,<br>
bovine and the like. Cancer refers to any various type of malignant neoplasm,<br>
for example, colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and leukemia, and in general<br>
is characterized by an undesirable cellular proliferation, e.g., unregulated growth,<br>
lack of differentiation, local tissue invasion, and metastasis.<br>
The ability of a compound of the invention to treat cancer may be<br>
determined by using assays well known to the art. For example, the design of<br>
treatment protocols, toxicity evaluation, data analysis, quantification of tumor<br>
cell kill, and the biological significance of the use of transplantable tumors<br>
screens are documented. In addition, ability of a compound to treat cancer may<br>
be determined using the Tests as described below.<br>
In Tests A-H the following general methodologies were employed:<br>
Tumor and animal maintenance<br>
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-03, B16-melanoma, mammary<br>
adenocarcinoma-16/C/Adr, mammary adenocarcinoma-17/Adr, colon<br>
adenocarcinoma-26, and mammary adenocarcinoma-16/C were used in the<br>
studies.<br>
Tumors were maintained in the mouse strain of origin C57B1/6 (for<br>
Panc03, B16), Balb/c (for Colon 26) and C3H (for the mammary tumors).<br>
Tumors were transplanted into the appropriate F1 hybrid (BDF1 = C57B1/6<br>
female X DBA/2 male) or the strain of origin for the chemotherapy trials.<br>
Individual mouse body weights for each experiment were within 5 grams, and all<br>
mice were over 17 grams at the start of therapy. The mice were supplied food<br>
and water ad libitum.<br>
Chemotherapy of solid tumors<br>
Animals were pooled, implanted subcutaneously with 30 to 60 mg tumor<br>
fragments by a 12 gauge trocar on day 0, and again pooled before unselective<br>
distribution to the various treatment and control groups. For early stage<br>
treatment, chemotherapy was started within 1 to 3 days after tumor implantation<br>
while the number of cells was relatively small (107 to 108 cells). For upstaged or<br>
advanced staged trials, the tumors were allowed to grow for five or more days<br>
before treatment was started. Tumors were measured with a caliper twice<br>
weekly. Mice were sacrificed when their tumors reached 1500 mg. Tumor<br>
weights are estimated from two-dimensional measurements:<br>
Tumor weight (in mg) = (a x b2)/2, where a and b are the tumor length<br>
and width in (mm), respectively.<br>
End points for assessing antitumor activity for solid tumors<br>
The following quantitative endpoints were used to assess antitumor<br>
activity:<br>
a) Tumor growth delay (T-C value), where T is the median time<br>
(in days) required for the treatment group tumors to reach a predetermined size<br>
(e.g., 1000 mg), and C is the median time (in days) for the control group tumors<br>
to reach the same size. Tumor-free survivors were are excluded from these<br>
calculations (cures are tabulated separately). This value is an important criterion<br>
of antitumor effectiveness because it allows the quantification of tumor cell kill.<br>
b) Calculation of tumor cell kill For subcutaneously (SC)<br>
growing tumors, the log10 cell kill was calculated from the following formula:<br><br>
where T-C is the tumor growth delay as described above and Td is the tumor<br>
volume doubling time (in days), estimated from the best fit straight line from a<br>
log-linear growth plot of the control group tumors in exponential growth (100 to<br>
800 mg range). The conversion of the T-C values to log10 cell kill is possible<br>
because the Td of tumors regrowing post treatment (Rx) approximates the Td<br>
values of the tumors in untreated control mice.<br>
The issue of conversion of tumor growth delay (T-C value) to log tumor<br>
cell kill is justified in this series because of the large number of cures obtained<br>
with 5 of the agents studied. Cures are a clear indication of tumor cell kill<br>
(rather than stasis of tumor cell replication).<br>
in selected cases, both for historic in vivo evaluation data as well as data<br>
presented here, it is of value to compare log kill numbers from trials of markedly<br>
different testing schedules. For this purpose, an activity table was created, and is<br>
presented below. It should be noted that an activity rating of +++ to +++ is<br>
needed to effect partial regression (PR) or complete regression (CR) of 100 to<br>
300 mg size masses of most transplanted solid tumors of mice. Thus, an activity<br>
rating of + or ++ would not be scored as active by usual clinical criteria. A PR<br>
is a reduction in tumor mass to less than 50% of pretreatment size. A CR is a<br>
reduction in tumor mass to below palpable size (i.e., reduction to zero detectable<br>
mass).<br><br>
The treatment and control groups were measured when the control group<br>
tumors reach approximately 700 to 1200 mg in size (median of group). The T/C<br>
value in percent is an indication of antitumor effectiveness: A T/C = 0% means<br>
no tumor growth. A T/C = 100% means no antitumor activity, i.e., the treated<br>
and control tumors grew equally. A T/C equal to or less than 42% is considered<br>
significant antitumor activity by the Drug Evaluation Branch of the Division of<br>
Cancer Treatment (NCI). A T/C value 
significant antitumor activity, and is the level used by NCI to justify a clinical<br>
trial if toxicity, formulation, and certain other requirements are met (termed DN-<br>
2 level activity). A body weight loss nadir (mean of group) of greater than 20%<br>
or greater than 20% drug deaths is considered to indicate an excessively toxic<br>
dosage in most single course trials.<br>
Drug preparation for injections in mice<br>
Compound 22b (sodium salt) in Tests A-H was prepared in a 1% sodium<br>
bicarbonate solution, dH2O or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), with pH adjusted<br>
to 7.0 to 7.5 with HC1, and administered intravenously (TV) or orally (PO), at<br>
injection volumes of 0.2 ml per injection.<br>
Test A<br>
Evaluation Against Early Stage Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma 03<br>
The pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 03 tumor is highly sensitive to<br>
taxol (++++ activity rating). It is sensitive to adriamycin (+++ activity rating),<br>
moderately sensitive to VP-16, cytoxan, and CisDDPt (+++ activity rating), and<br>
modestly sensitive to 5-FU (+ activity). Female BDF1 mice (obtained from NCI-<br>
Raleigh) (date of birth (hereinafter D.O.B.) March 27,2000; date of arrival<br>
(hereinafter D.O.A.) April 9,2000) were implanted (tumor implant date<br>
(hereinafter D.O.T.) March 17,2000) with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 03<br>
tumor, divided into treatment and control groups. The treatment group was<br>
administered compound 22b each day on days 3-9 IV. The results of Test A are<br>
summarized in Table 1.<br>
Test B<br>
Evaluation Against Early Stage B16 Melanoma<br>
B16 melanoma is a very drug insensitive tumor when implanted<br>
subcutaneously (SC) It is unresponsive to VP-16, vinblastine, and Ara-C<br>
(negative (-) activity rating), marginally responsive to taxol, adriamycin and<br>
camptothecin (+ or +/- activity rating), modestly responsive to 5-FU, cytoxan,<br>
and CisDDPt (++ activity rating). Only BCNU and other nitrosoureas are highly<br>
active (++++ activity rating).<br>
BDF1 female mice (obtained from NCI-CRL-Ral) (D.O.B. January 24,<br>
2000, D.O.A. February 29,2000). The average weight of the mice was 21.6 gm.<br>
Mice were implanted with B16 melanoma cells, passage number 138 (D.O.T.<br>
April 17, 2000). Td (tumor volume doubling time) was 1 day. The mice were<br>
divided into a control group and three experimental groups. The control group<br>
(Cage #1) received no treatment.<br>
Cage #1 reached 1000 mg in 7 days (1.0 day Td), and tumor growth was<br>
as expected.<br>
In Cage #2, compound 22b (racemic) was administered IV at<br>
40 mg/kg/injection, once per day on days 1-4. A total of 320 mg/kg was<br>
administered. This dose was toxic, producing 1/5 drug deaths (occurring on day<br>
7). The cause of death was marrow toxicity, as evidenced by a small spleen size.<br>
Examination of the gastrointestinal tract revealed it was empty, indicating no<br>
food intake prior to death. This dose produced severe weight loss (-20.8%; nadir<br>
occurred on day 7 with full recovery on day 11). A -20% body weight loss is<br>
considered excessively toxic by N.C.I. standards. Here, administration of<br>
compound 22b (racemic) was associated with a slowing of nerve conduction in<br>
the mice. At doses of 50 mg/kg, the toxicity was mild, but lasted for 20 minutes<br>
on day 1, and for 8 minutes on day 4. At high dosages, e.g., 80 mg/kg, the agent<br>
produced a substantial post injection neuromuscular toxicity lasting for over 20<br>
minutes but resolved by two hours. This included a distinctive paralysis of the<br>
hind legs, indicating that the toxicity was related to the conduction velocity,<br>
since the longer the nerves, the more function was affected. As will be discussed<br>
later, this slowing of nerve conduction occurs with the racemic and S-enantiomer<br>
of this series. In all cases, it is absent in the R-enantiomeric forms.<br>
In Cage #3, compound 22b was administered IV at 50 mg/kg/injection,<br>
daily on days 1-5. A total of 250 mg/kg were administered. At this dose, the<br>
percentage of body weight loss was -13% (nadir occurred on day 7, full recovery<br>
on day 11, for a four day host recovery time). This dose was active (T/C =0,2.6<br>
log kill, +++- activity rating).<br>
hi Cage #4, compound 22b was administered IV, at 30 mg/kg/injection<br>
daily on days 1 -6 for a total administration of 180 mg/kg.. This dose produced a -<br>
7.4% body weight loss (nadir occurred on day 5, with a full recovery on day 9).<br>
This dose was active (T/C=15.6%, 1.8 log kill, ++ activity rating).<br>
The results of Test B are summarized in Table 2.<br>
Test C<br>
Evaluation Against Early Stage Mammary Adenocarcinoma-16/C/Adr<br>
Early stage mammary adenocarcinoma-16/C/Adr is a p-glycoprotein<br>
negative multidrug resistant tumor. C3H female mice were obtained from NCI-<br>
Kingston-CRL (D.O.B. April 3,2000; D.O.A. May 16,2000). The average<br>
weight of the mice was 26.3 gm. Mice were implanted with early stage<br>
mammary adenocarcinoma-16/C/Adr passage number 183 and divided into a<br>
control group (Cage #1) and two experimental groups (Cage #2 and Cage #3)<br>
(D.O.T. = June 22,2000). The control animals (Cage #1) received no treatment.<br>
The racemic form of compound 22b (chloro analog) was administered to the<br>
experimental groups as follows:<br><br>
Cage #1 reached 1000 mg in 16 days (1.2 day Td), and tumor growth was<br>
as expected.<br>
In Cage #2, a total administration of 504 mg/kg compound 22b was<br>
administered by IV This treatment produced a modest neuromuscular gait<br>
disturbance lasting for about ten minutes post injection. The toxicity was most<br>
evident the first two days, becoming less evident with subsequent injections.<br>
This dose produced a -15% body weight loss (nadir occurred on day 7, and full<br>
recovery occurred on day 12). Interestingly, the mice gained weight during the<br>
second course of treatment (days 11-13). The agent was active at this dose<br>
(T/C=0%, 2.0 log kill, +++ activity rating).<br>
In Cage #3, a total of 324 mg/kg compound 22b was administered. This<br>
dose produced an insignificant gait disturbance, and a -1.1% loss of body weight<br>
in the Cage #3 animals (nadir occurred on day 7, and full recovery occurred on<br>
day 8). The agent was inactive at this dose schedule (T/C=53%, 0.6 log kill).<br>
The results of Test C of are summarized in Table 3.<br>
Test D<br>
Evaluation of Racemic Compound 22c Against Early Stage<br>
Mammary Adenocarcinoma-17/Adr<br>
A racemic mixture of compound 22c (bromo analog) was evaluated<br>
against a multidrug-resistant mammary tumor (Mam-17/Adr).<br>
Female C3H/HeN (MTV-neg) mice were obtained from N.C.I. Frederick<br>
(D.O.B. was October 9,2000; D.O.A. was November 14,2000). The mice<br>
weighed an average of 29.3 gm. Mice were implanted with Mam-17/Adr/passage-<br>
220 (a p-glycoprotein positive multidrug-resistant-tumor) (I).O.T. was January 2,<br>
2001; Td = 1.0 days). Compound 22c (racemic) was prepared for administration<br>
by suspending in 5% ethanol, 1% POE-80, and 1% sodium bicarbonate to effect<br>
solution. Then, P.B.S. was added, and the pH was adjusted to 7 with HC1. 0.2 ml<br>
per injection was administered IV.<br>
Cage #1 animals received no treatment. Tumor growth as expected,<br>
reaching 1000 mg on day 7 (range 7-9) (Td = 1.0 days).<br>
Animals in cage #3 were administered the racemic preparation of<br>
compound 22c by IV at 50 mg/kg/injection on day 1; 62.5 mg/kg on day 2; and<br>
60 mg/kg/injection on days 3, 6, 7, 8 for a total of 352.5 mg/kg. This dose<br>
produced a modest -5.5% body wt loss. This agent caused a modest slowing of<br>
nerve conduction, lasting approximately 10 minutes at the 60 to 62.5 mg/kg dose.<br>
The symptoms were a mild gait disturbance. This dose had impressive antitumor<br>
activity (T/C = 0,4.2 log kill, ++++ activity rating). The tumors reached 1000 mg<br>
on day 21 (range 19-42). No antitumor agent, standard or investigation has<br>
exceeded this degree of activity against this tumor.<br>
Cage #4 animals were given the racemic preparation of compound 22c by<br>
IV at 30 mg/kg on day 1; 37.5 mg/kg on day 2; and 36 mg/kg/injection on days 3,<br>
6,7, 8 for a total of 211.5 mg/kg. There was no gait disturbance at this dose. This<br>
dose was also highly active (3.0 log kill). The rumors reached 1000 mg on day 17<br>
(range 14-21).<br>
The racemic preparation of compound 22c was found to have the same<br>
type of neuromuscular toxicity observed in testing a racemic preparation of<br>
compound 22b, but it was less severe (see Test B).<br>
Results are presented in Table 4.<br>
Test E<br>
Evaluation of the R-Enantiomer of Compound 22b and Compound 22a<br>
Against Early Stage Mammary Adenocarcinoma-17/Adr<br>
The activity of the R-enantiomer of compound 22b and compound 22a<br>
(fluoro analog) were evaluated for activity against mammary tumor Mam-<br>
17/Adr, which is a p-glycoprotein positive multidrug-resistant-tumor. C3H/HeN<br>
(MTV-neg) female mice were obtained from N.C.I.-Frederick (D.O.B. was<br>
November 20,2000; D.O.A. was January 2,2001). The average weight of the<br>
mice was 25.9 gm. Mice were implanted with Mam-17/Adr/passage-223<br>
(D.O.T. was February 12,2001; Td was 1.2 days) and divided into a control and<br>
treatment groups.<br>
A racemic preparation of compound 22a was suspended in 3% ethanol,<br>
1% POE-80, and 0.25% sodium bicarbonate to effect solution. Then, P.B.S. was<br>
added and the pH adjusted to 7 with HCl. A volume of 0.2 ml per injection was<br>
administered to animals intravenously. The R-enantiomer of compound 22b was<br>
suspended in 3% ethanol, 1% POE-80, and 0.5% sodium-bicarbonate to effect<br>
solution. Then, P.B.S. was added and the pH was adjusted to 7 with HC1. A<br>
volume of 0.2 ml per injection was administered to animals intravenously.<br>
Cage #1, the control group, received no treatment, and reached 1000 mg<br>
in 9.0 days (8.5-10), (1.2 day Td). The tumor growth was as expected.<br>
Cage #3 was administered 36 mg/kg of racemic compound 22a by IV on<br>
day 1, and 48 mg/kg/injection qd-2-7 for a total of 324 mg/kg. Higher individual<br>
dosages could not be given because of severe neuromuscular toxicity (slowing in<br>
nerve conduction resulting in dysfunctional leg movements, both front and rear.<br>
The dysfunction lasted for 15 minutes for the front legs and longer for the rear<br>
legs. This dose was active (T/C = 14%, 1.5 log kill, ++ activity rating).<br>
Although active, this is clearly not an improvement over compound 22b or<br>
compound 22c.<br>
Cages #4 and #5 received lower doses of the racemic compound 22a<br>
preparation than Cage #3. These were inactive.<br>
Cage #6 were administered an R-enantiomer of compound 22b and<br>
neuromuscular toxicity was not produced. In Test B, the racemic form of<br>
compound 22b produced a slowing in nerve conduction. This result implied that<br>
the S- enantiomer is responsible for the neuromuscular toxicity of<br>
compound 22b. The S-enantiomeric form was later synthesized and injected at<br>
80 mg/kg/injection and also at 50 mg/kg/injection, IV, both producing marked<br>
neuromuscular toxicity. hi Cage #6, the R-enantiomer of compound 22b was<br>
injected IV at 83 mg/kg/injection, qd-1-4 for a total of 332 mg/kg. This dose<br>
was toxic, killing all of the 5 mice (on days 7,7,8,9,10). The cause of death was<br>
Gl-epithelial damage producing Gl-epithelial slough resulting in diarrhea. Three<br>
of the mice had slightly enlarged food-filled stomachs, indicating gastroparesis<br>
or paralytic ileus. The spleen sizes for all of the mice were near normal,<br>
indicating that the agent did not produce much marrow toxicity in the mice.<br>
Cage #7 were adrninistered the R-enantiomer of compound 22b by IV at<br>
55 mg/kg/injection, qd-1-4 for a total dose of 220 mg/kg. This dose was<br>
somewhat toxic, producing 1/5 drug deaths and a large body weight loss (-23.4%<br>
nadir day 9 and full recovery on day 14). The one death was from GI-epithelial<br>
damage (diarrhea) complicated with marrow toxicity (small spleen). This dose<br>
was, however, highly active (T/C = 0,3.3 log kill, ++++ activity rating). The<br>
tumors reached 1000 mg on day 22 (18-23).<br>
Cage #8 contained only one mouse, which was used for an initial toxicity<br>
control to evaluate neuromuscular toxicity. It was injected with a single bolus<br>
dosage of the R-enantiomer of compound 22b preparation at 124.5 mg/kg on day<br>
1 only. There was no neuromuscular toxicity. The dose was modestly active and<br>
not toxic (T/C = 35%, 0.8 log kill, + activity rating).<br>
Thus, the data indicated that compound 22a was active (Cage #2). The<br>
R-enantiomer of compound 22b was devoid of the neuromuscular toxicity that<br>
occurs with the racemic form of the agent. The S-enantiomer was made and<br>
tested and found to be responsible for the neuromuscular toxicity.<br>
Results are presented in Table 5.<br>
Test F<br>
Evaluation of the R-Enantiomer of Compound 22b and the R-Enantiomer<br>
of Compound 22c Against Early Staged Mammary Adenocarcinoma-16/C<br>
In this trial, the R-enantiomers of both compound 22c and compound 22b<br>
were compared. Each compound was completely devoid of neuromuscular<br>
toxicity. The lethal dose-limiting toxicities are similar (GI epithelial damage).<br>
C3H female mice were obtained from N.C.I. (D.O.B. was January 22,<br>
2001; D.O.A. was January 27,2001). The mice weighed an average of 19.2 gm.<br>
Mice were implanted SC with mammary adenocarcinoma-16/C passage-170, a<br>
fast growing, highly invasive, highly metastatic tumor (D.O.T. was March 8,<br>
2001; Td was 1.2 days).<br>
The R-enantiomers of both Compound 22c and Compound 22b were<br>
each suspended in 3% ethanol, 1% POE-80,0.5% sodium bicarbonate (by<br>
volume) to effect solution, P.B.S. was then added and the pH adjusted to 7 with<br>
HC1. Adriamycin (ADRIA; lot number 20338c) was suspended in dH20 to effect<br>
solution and the pH was adjusted to 6.0. Mice were administered 0.2 ml per IV<br>
injection.<br>
Cage #1 received no treatment, and tumor growth was as expected. The<br>
tumors reached 1000 mg on day 9.5 (range 7-12) (Td = 1.0 days).<br>
Cage #2 mice were administered the R-enantiomer of compound 22c by<br>
IV at 65 mg/kg/inj qd-1-4 for a total of 260 mg/kg. No neuromuscular toxicity<br>
occurred following the injections. All the mice died 2-3 days following the last<br>
treatment from G.I. epithelial damage.<br>
Cage #3 mice were administered R-enantiomer of compound 22c by IV<br>
at 65 mg/kg/injection every other day (once each on days 1,3,5,7) for a total of<br>
260 mg/kg. In keeping with a very rapid host recovery time for this analog<br>
series, there were no deaths. The mice encountered a -8.3% body weight loss<br>
(nadir day 9 with full recovery day 12), indicating that the total dose on this<br>
intermittent schedule was adequate, but not excessive. Again, there was no<br>
neuromuscular toxicity with this dose-schedule. This dose was active (T/C =<br>
4%; 1.7 Log kill; ++ activity rating).<br>
Cage #4 mice were administered the R-enantiomer of compound 22c by<br>
IV at 40 mg/kg/injection on the same schedule as in Cage#3 (i.e., on days<br>
1,3,5,7) for a total of 160 mg/kg. There was no toxicity and the mice gained<br>
weight during treatment (+6.4% body weight gain). This dose was also active<br>
(T/C = 9%; 1.4 Log kill; and 1/5 cures; ++ activity rating if the cure is not<br>
considered). The tumor free mouse was reimplanted with Maml6/C tumor on<br>
day 155. The implant grew successfully, indicating that immunogenic factors<br>
were not involved in the original cure.<br>
Cage #5 mice were administered the R-enantiomer of compound 22b by<br>
IV at 50 mg/kg/inj qd-1-5 for a total of 250 mg/kg. No neuromuscular toxicity<br>
occurred post injections. This dose caused an excessive weight loss, but no<br>
deaths. The mice regained all the weight within 5 days (-22.9% body weight loss<br>
on day 8, with full recovery on day 13, indicating that some of the weight loss<br>
was from dehydration). This dose was highly active (T/C = 0%; 2.1 Log kill;<br>
+++ activity rating).<br>
Cage #6 mice were administered the R-enantiomer of compound 22b by<br>
IV at 50 mg/kg/injection on days 1,3,5,7 for a total of 200 mg/kg. This dose was<br>
well tolerated, and caused no weight loss. It was active (T/C = 5%; 1.7 Log kill;<br>
++ activity rating). It is likely that a higher dose could be given on this schedule,<br>
considering the lack of weight loss.<br>
Cage #7 mice were administered the R-enantiomer of compound 22b by<br>
IV at 30 mg/kg/injection on the same schedule as in Cage-6 for a total of 120<br>
mg/kg. The mice gained weight. This dose was modestly active (T/C = 32%;<br>
0.8 Log kill; + activity rating).<br>
Cage #11 mice were administered adriamycin as a positive control.<br>
Historically, adriamycin is one of the most active agents against this tumor. 7.5<br>
mg/kg/injection was administered by IV on days 1 and 5, for a total of 15<br>
mg/kg. While no body weight loss was observed, the mice did not begin to re-<br>
gain weight until day 11, and then only modestly. There was one delayed drug-<br>
death in this group. As expected, this agent was highly active (T/C = 0%; 3.6<br>
Log kill; till activity rating, although at a toxic dose).<br>
At dosages that produced less than 10% body weight loss, the R-<br>
enantiomer of compound 22b and the R-enantiomer of compound 22c were<br>
equally active, each with a 1.7 log kill (see Cages 3 and 6). At equal active<br>
dosages, the R-enantiomer of compound 22b had a slightly lower dose<br>
requirement (200 mg/kg - see Cage 6) than the R-enantiomer of compound 22c<br>
(260 mg/kg - see Cage 4).<br>
Results are presented in Table 6.<br>
Test G<br>
Evaluation of the R-enantiomers of Compounds 22c and 22b against Upstaged <br>
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma-03<br>
In this trial, the R enantiomers of Compound 22c and 22b were<br>
compared.<br>
BDF1 female mice were obtained from N.C.I., CRL-Ral (D.O.B. was<br>
February 26,2001; D.O.A. was March 10,2001). The mice weighed an average<br>
of 22.5 gm. Mice were implanted SC with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-03<br>
passage 143. (D.O.T. was May 29,2001; Td was 2.3 days).<br>
The R-enantiomer of compound 22c was suspended in 3% ethanol, 1%<br>
POE-80,0.25% sodium bicarbonate (by volume) to effect solution. dH2O was<br>
then added, and the pH adjusted to 7 with HC1. Mice were administered 0.2 ml<br>
per IV injection. The R-enantiomer of compound 22b was suspended in 3%.<br>
ethanol, 1% POE-80, 0.5% sodium-bicarbonate (by volume) to effect solution.<br>
Then, dH2O was added, and the pH adjusted to 7.5 with HCl. Mice were<br>
injected with 0.2 ml per injection IV or PO. Adriamycin (source ADRIA; lot<br>
2033BC) was suspended in dH2O to effect solution, and the pH was 6.0. Mice<br>
were administered 0.2 ml per IV injection.<br>
Treatment began six days following implant, at which time the tumors<br>
were palpable size (126 mg median). The duration of treatment was prolonged<br>
(18 days) in order to obtain a clear separation in efficacy between the<br>
compounds.<br>
Cage #1 received no treatment, and tumor growth was as expected. The<br>
tumors reached 1000 mg on day 16.5 (range 15-21; Td = 2.3 days).<br>
Cage #2 mice were administered compound 22b (R-enantiomer) by IV at<br>
80 mg/kg/injection on an intermittent schedule (lx/day on days<br>
6,9,12,15,18,21,24) for a total of 560 mg/kg. The regimen was well tolerated<br>
with no weight loss or deaths. The mice were agitated post IV injection, but the<br>
behavior lasted only a few minutes. There is no neuromuscular toxicity with the<br>
R-enantiomer. This dose was active (2.3 log kill, 2/7 PR's, +++ activity rating).<br>
This dose-schedule was clearly inferior to compound 22c (R-enantiomer).<br>
Cage #3 mice were administered compound 22b (R-enantiomer) by IV at<br>
50 mg/kg/inj on an intermittent schedule (lx/day on days 6,9,12,15,18,21,24) for<br>
a total of 350 mg/kg. The regimen was well tolerated with no weight loss or<br>
deaths. This dose was active (1.5 log kill, 1/6 CR's, ++ activity rating).<br>
Cage #4 mice were administered compound 22b (R-enantiomer) by TV at<br>
31 mg/kg/inj on an intermittent schedule (lx/day on days 6,9,12,15,18,21,24) for<br>
a total of 217 mg/kg. The regimen was well tolerated with substantial weight<br>
gain. This dose was not active (0.5 log kill, — activity rating).<br>
Cage #5 mice were administered compound 22b (R-enantiomer) SC at<br>
31.2 mg/kg/inj on a daily schedule (qd 6-24) for a total of 592.8 mg/kg. The<br>
regimen was well tolerated with only minor weight loss and no deaths. The mice<br>
were not agitated post SC injection. This dose was only modestly active (0.9 log<br>
kill, 1/5 CR's, + activity rating). The one tumor free mouse was reimplanted<br>
with 30mg tumor fragments of P03 on day 157. The implant grew, indicating<br>
that immune factors were not involved in the original cure. This SC daily<br>
schedule was clearly inferior to the IV intermittent schedule (compare to cage<br>
#2).<br>
Cage #6 mice were administered compound 22b (R-enantiomer) SC at<br>
19.5 mg/kg/inj on a daily schedule (qd 6-24) for a total of 370.5 mg/kg. The<br>
regimen was well tolerated with no weight loss and no deaths. The mice were<br>
not agitated post SC injection. This dose was not active (0.4 log kill, — activity<br>
rating). This SC daily schedule was clearly inferior to the TV intermittent<br>
schedule (compare to cage #3).<br>
Cage #12 mice were administered compound 22c (R-enantiomer). Only<br>
limited drug supply was available, thus only one dose level IV was tested, and<br>
only 4 mice per group could be used. Compound 22c was administered IV at<br>
80 mg/kg/inj on an intermittent schedule (1x/day on days 6,9,12,15,18,21) for a<br>
total of 480 mg/kg. The day 24 injection was omitted because the drug supply<br>
was exhausted. The regimen was well tolerated with no weight loss and no<br>
deaths. The mice were agitated post IV injection, but the behavior lasted only a<br>
few minutes. There was slightly more agitation with this compound analog than<br>
occurred with compound 22b. There is no neuromuscular toxicity with the R-<br>
enantiomer. This dose was highly active (3.1 log kill, 3/4 complete regressions,<br>
++++ activity rating). This dose-schedule with compound 22c was markedly<br>
superior to compound 22b against this pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.<br>
Cage #13 mice were administered adriamycin as a positive control.<br>
Historically, adriamycin is a highly active agent against this tumor. A dosage of<br>
7.5 mg/kg/injection was given IV days 6,14 for a total of 15 mg/kg (the<br>
approximate maximum tolerated dose). This was well tolerated in this trial, with<br>
no weight loss and no deaths. As expected, this agent was active, (2.3 log kill,<br>
1/5 CR's, -H-+ activity rating).<br>
Compound 22c-R-enantiomer was markedly superior to compound 22b<br>
on an intermittent dose schedule given IV. The intermittent schedule IV was<br>
clearly superior to the daily oral schedule.<br>
Results are presented in Table 7.<br>
Test H<br>
Evaluation of the R-enantiomers of XK-469. Compound 22b, and<br>
 Compound 22c Against Advanced Staged Colon Carcinoma 26 in Female<br>
Balb/c Mice<br>
hi this trial the R-enantiomers of XK-469, compound 22c, and<br>
compound 22b were compared against advanced staged colon carcinoma 26 in<br>
female Balb/c mice. Compound 22c was markedly more active than compound<br>
22b or compound XK469 against this colon carcinoma. Cage #2 was 22b at<br>
400 mg/kg and Cage 4 was 22c at 400mg/kg. Both were toxic and omitted from<br>
this table.<br>
* The "*" asterisk indicates the tumor is highly metastatic and toxic,<br>
causing substantial body weight loss. In the treated groups, the weight loss was<br>
determined at a time before the tumor had a substantial impact.<br>
The XK469-R, 22b, and 22c compound doses were all prepared the<br>
same, using 3% ethanol, 1%POE-80, and 0.5% sodium bicarbonate. The<br>
injection volume was 0.2 mL/mouse IV. Cytoxan was prepared in dH2O and<br>
injected IV in a volume of 0.2 mL per mouse. The mice were Balb/c female<br>
5 mice: DOB 2/12/01; DOA 3/27/01; DOT 8/8/01, with an average body weight of<br>
24.7 grams at the start of Rx administration. The tumor was Colon Carcinoma-<br>
26 passage 141; date of implant 8/8/01, and implanted at 30 to 60 mg fragments<br>
bilaterally SC. All tumors were 63 to 171 mg on day 6, the day of first Rx.<br>
Cage #1: Control: growth as expected, 1.7 day Td.<br>
Cage #3:22b: 50 mg/kg/injection was given IV on days 6,8,10,13, and<br>
15 for a total of 250 mg/kg. This produced 1/6 complete regressions and a 1.4<br>
log kill (++ activity rating).<br>
Cage #5:22c: 50 mg/kg/injection was given IV on days 6, 8,10,13, and<br>
15 for a total of 250 mg/kg. This produced 3/6 complete regressions, and 3/6<br>
tumor free survivors on day 55. These mice remained in excellent condition,<br>
gaining weight and skeletal size. They were reimplanted with 30 mg fragments<br>
of Colon-26 on day 156. The implants grew successfully, indicating that<br>
immune factors were not involved in the original cures (++++ activity rating).<br>
Cage #6: XK469-R: 80 mg/kg/injection was given IV on days 6, 8,10,<br>
14, and 16 for a total of 400 mg/kg (The historic MTD is in the 400 to 450<br>
mg/kg range). There were no regressions. This dosage produced 0.9 log kill (+<br>
activity rating).<br>
Cage #7: XK469-R: 50 mg/kg/injection was given IV on days 6, 8,10,<br>
13, and 15 for a total of 250 mg/kg. This dose was inactive.<br>
Cage #8: Cytoxan was injected IV at 110 mg/kg per injection on days 6,<br>
and 10 for a total of 220 mg/kg. There was no meaningful activity. Historically<br>
Cytoxan is active against this tumor if treatment is started on day 1 (the day after<br>
implant).<br>
The results are presented in Table 8.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting<br>
examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of [4-[(7-Substituted-2-quinolinyl)oxy]phenoxyl-<br>
As shown in Scheme I, a one-pot preparation of trans-3-ethoxyacryloyl<br>
chloride (4) by reaction of ethyl vinyl ether (2) and oxalyl chloride (3), with<br>
subsequent decarboxylation, has been described by Tietze et al., Synthesis. 1079-<br>
1080 (1993). The amidation of the meta-substituted anilines (5a-e) with 4, i.e.,<br>
the conversion to 6a-e, was modeled after the procedure described by Campbell<br>
and Roberts (U.S. Patent Number 4,710,507) for preparation of trans-N-(4-<br>
bromo-3-methylphenyl)-3-ethoxypropenamide. Cyclization of the latter to a<br>
mixture of 5- (8a-3) and 7-substituted quinolin-2-ols (7a-e) was effect in either<br>
concentrated sulfuric or hydrochloric acid (Campbell and Roberts). The mixture,<br>
in turn, was transformed to the corresponding 2-chloroquinoline derivatives (9a-<br>
e) and (10a-e), on refluxing with phosphorous oxychloride (Campbell and<br>
Roberts). The majority of the 7-substituted derivatives (9a-e) separated from the<br>
regioisomer (10a-e) on fractional crystallization. The residue yielded additional<br>
9a-c, following column chromatography over silica gel.<br><br>
As illustrated in Scheme II, the 2-chloroqionolines 9a-e were coupled<br>
with 2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propionic acid (20) using either NaH or K2CO3 in<br>
refluxing DMF followed by acidification to give the acids (21a-e). These acids<br>
can also be converted to their metal salts (22a-e) by reacting with metal<br>
hydroxides. XK469, which possesses a single stereogenic center at C-2 of the<br>
propionic acid moiety, is generally prepared in the form of a racemic mixture.<br>
The R-(+) forms of 21b and 21c were prepared by etherification of commercially<br>
available R-(+)-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propionic acid with 9b and c. Chiral<br>
HPLC of the R-form of 21b and c, indicated that they had both been obtained in<br>
&gt;99% ee (see Figure 2).<br>
HPLC separations of racemic and R 21b were carried out using ASTEC<br>
Chirobiotic T 250 x 4.6 mm, 65% H2O,35% CH3OH, 20 mM NH4NO3 at 1<br>
mL/min with detection at 250 nm.<br>
General Experimental Procedures<br>
To a solution of the 7-substituted-2-chloroquinoliDe and 2-(4-<br>
hydroxyphenoxy)propionic acid (1 eq) dissolved in DMF (5 mL/mmol), 60%<br>
NaH (3 eq) was added in portions and the mixture heated at gentle reflux for 2<br>
hours. After cooling it was concentrated to give a solid to which water was<br>
added and the solution was filtered through Celite, then washed with water. The<br>
filtrate was extracted with ether and the aqueous layer was acidified with 1M<br>
HC1 to pH 3-4. After cooling, the solid was collected, dried, dissolved in AcOEt<br>
and filtered through silica gel. The filtrate was concentrated to a small volume,<br>
the solid was collected and recrystallized from AcOEt-heptane.<br>
The reaction can also be carried out using K2CO3 (2.5 eq) instead of NaH<br>
but the reaction times need to be increased to about 12 hours.<br>
