3.  PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins comprising a large number of similar workstations, which have a large number of components, such as, for example, a thread tensioner or a waxing device, a drive, a thread displacement device, a thread connecting device or the like, which are connected to a machine bus to control the production process, the components and/or workstations each being allocated an identification address.<br>
The invention moreover relates to a component of a workstation of a textile machine according to the preamble of claim 7.<br>
A textile machine comprises a large number of preferably modularly constructed workstations, which in turn have a large number of components, such as, for example, drives for an opening roller, a thread displacement device or the like and a thread clearer or a thread cutting device. The modular structure of the workstations allows, in a simple manner, the exchange of individual components within the workstation or else the exchange of the same components between various workstations of the textile machine. The components of a workstation are furthermore taken to mean, for example, the drives of a thread connecting device, of a thread feeder device or of a thread tensioner of a winding machine. Accordingly, the drives for a draw-in roller, a delivery roller or a spinning means are, for example, the components of the workstations of a spinning machine.<br>
A textile machine of this type is known from EP 0 385 530 Al.   To control the<br>
working processes at its workstations, the latter has a fieldbus system, which<br>
consists of a fieldbus and components of the workstations connected thereto.  The<br>
fieldbus  is  connected  to  a  central control  device  to  communicate  with  the<br>
components of the workstations via command sequences, which are passed to<br>
individual workstation computers.<br><br><br>
All the individual components of the workstations of the textile machine which can be controlled by a central control device are therefore regarded as components in the sense of the present invention. These include the workstations and the components within the workstations which are connected to one another by the fieldbus, in other words including the workstation computers. For a targeted response of individual components and/or the workstations, it is necessary for each component and/or workstation to be allocated a clear identification address. The identification addresses may be stored, for example, in a non-volatile memory of the component and/or the workstations or be set by coding switches of the component.<br>
If two components and/or workstations have an identical identification address, during normal operation both interpret an instruction which is sent to the fieldbus and provided with this identification address as directed to it. The result is that a targeted response of an individual component and/or workstation is no longer possible or a plurality of components and/or workstations of the textile machine erroneously respond together to a command sequence sent to the fieldbus.<br>
If, in a fieldbus, only components of various types are provided, the assignment of addresses can be coupled to the type of component. If, however, a plurality of components or workstations of the same type are present in the fieldbus, the risk is great that two components or workstations of the same type are allocated the same identification address. If an error of this type occurs and a plurality of components and/or workstations with the same identification address are present in the fieldbus, disturbances occur in the bus communication (for example faulty interpretations of commands, command sequences reach the component, which is not to be addressed or commands are not carried out at all), it being difficult to recognise which of the components and/or workstations are responsible for the disturbance.<br>
Thus, for example, a double assignment of the identification address for the<br>
components, drive of the draw-in roller and drive of the delivery roller of the<br><br><br>
workstation of the spinning machine would lead, in a command sequence to increase the drive speed of the draw-in roller to a certain value, to this command being interpreted by the drive of the delivery roller such that said delivery roller is operated at the same speed, which would be linked with corresponding negative results.<br>
It is therefore expedient as far as possible already before commencing normal operation, to prevent the risk of a double address assignment.<br>
The object of the invention is to avoid address conflicts in a fieldbus system of a textile machine, in particular without the requirement of a central authority managing the addresses of the components and/or workstations.<br>
According to the invention this is achieved by a generic textile machine according to either of the independent claims 1 or 2, in which each component and/or workstation has a control device, which during the installation of the component and/or the workstation, before a transfer to normal operation, sends an inquiry message with its pre-set identification address via the machine bus, which is suitable to prompt a component already connected to the machine bus and/or workstation with an identical identification address into a response, in that the control device is set up to investigate a bus communication on the machine bus to establish whether a response message from an already connected component and/or workstation is sent, in that the control device evaluates the bus communication to recognise whether an already connected component and/or workstation with an identical identification address is connected to the machine bus, and that the control device is set up for automatic generation of a new identification address if, during the evaluation, an address collision is established, in order to send an inquiry message with the newly set identification address via the machine bus if it has been established that the originally set identification address has been assigned.<br><br><br>
The checking according to the invention can be carried out when the fieldbus operation is running and also when the fieldbus is started up.<br>
The checking preferably takes place during each new start-up of the textile machine or also only of the workstation after a shutdown period. The checking may also be triggered by a manual start-up of the component and/or workstation for example after its exchange or as a consequence of the switching on of the current supply of the component and/or workstation.<br>
As a reaction to the initiation of the checking, the control device of the component and/or the workstation determines its own pre-set identification address and sends an inquiry message to the fieldbus, which is configured in such a way that another component and/or workstation with the same identification address in normal operation is prompted to a response message. The control device of the component and/or the workstation, which has sent the inquiry message does not itself react with a response message, but monitors the bus communication. The messages read on the fieldbus are then checked as to whether this is the response message to the inquiry message.<br>
If such a response message is received, the control device of the component and/or workstation can recognise from this that its identification address has already been assigned elsewhere in the fieldbus system and accordingly does not transfer to normal operation with this identification address.<br>
If the control device recognises a component and/or workstation with the same identification address already installed at the fieldbus, the control device emits a fault signal, which is displayed by a means at the textile machine. This may be an optical or acoustic fault signal or else a message to the workstation computer or the textile machine.<br><br><br>
Moreover, the control device automatically generates a new address to repeat the process of checking the identification address in order to connect the component and/or workstation to the fieldbus and be able to transfer it to normal operation. For this purpose, the control device of the component and/or workstation may also be allocated a plurality of identification addresses or an identification address area instead of a single identification address, so it begins the method with a first of these identification addresses and on receipt of a response message continues with further identification addresses until it has reached an identification address which has not yet been assigned in the fieldbus system. Alternatively, on the basis of the evaluation of the bus communication, one or more random identification addresses may be generated. According to the independent claim 2, specialist staff react to the triggered fault signal in such a way that the identification address is set manually, for example, by means of coding elements such as DIP-switches or the like directly at the component and/or the workstation. These configurations are particularly advantageous as it is in turn checked with this changed identification address whether an already installed component and/or workstation with the same identification address is present in the fieldbus system.<br>
It proves to be advantageous if the control device can set a limited number of new identification addresses if there is an address conflict to repeat the inquiry. The number of addresses may be limited in a predeterminable manner to keep the process within a reasonable time frame.<br>
Furthermore, means may be provided at the textile machine which show that an<br>
address has already been assigned.    The means provided to signal an address<br>
conflict are preferably provided directly at the component and/or the workstation,<br>
so identification of the incorrectly set component and/or workstation is simple in the<br>
course of starting up the fieldbus.   An optical signal sensor, for example a signal<br>
LED or a signal bulb or a loudspeaker, is regarded as an advantageous embodiment.<br>
The address collision can be indicated via a central control mechanism at the textile<br><br><br>
machine and/or be sent thereby to a remote computer to provide an indication of an address collision there.<br>
In a development of the invention, the control device transfers the component and/or workstation to normal operation if no already connected component and/ or workstation with the same identification address has been recognised at the fieldbus. The absence of a response message ensures that an address conflict and a resulting disturbance of the bus communication are not to be feared. As soon as the new component and/or workstation has transferred to normal operation, it is ready to receive normal operation messages, it being possible for these to also comprise inquiry messages of other components and/or workstations connected to the fieldbus, which for the purpose of transition to normal operation, check the presence of their identification address in the fieldbus system.<br>
An embodiment is regarded as particularly advantageous in which the control device of the component and/or the workstation, after the activation of the inquiry message and before sending it, allows a waiting time to pass which has a randomly selected duration. It is thereby achieved that two control devices of components and/or workstations with an identical identification address do not simultaneously carry out the check despite simultaneous activation or supplying with current and then, as a result of the absence of a response message, transfer to normal operation.<br>
In fieldbus systems, which extend over a large area, as an alternative or in addition, an acoustic fault signal coming from the signal sensor which allows, even with a lack of visual contact, a location of the signalling component and/or workstation, is advantageous.<br>
In a development, a detection period, in which the bus communication by the new component  and/or  workstation is  investigated,  ends,  at  the  latest,  when  a<br>
predetermined maximum period from sending the inquiry message has expired<br><br><br>
and/or at least one other message from an already installed component and/or workstation has been sent to the fieldbus, the priority of which is lower than the priority of the expected response message.<br>
The simplest variant provides a limited detection period, after the expiry of which without the arrival of a response message, the first component and/or workstation transfers to normal operation. The detection period is preferably to be selected to be so large that it is ensured that a possibly already installed component and/ or workstation with an identical identification address has been placed in a position to send a response message to the fieldbus.<br>
As an alternative or in addition, it can be used as a criterion whether, during the checking of the bus communication, other messages are determined, the priority of which is higher than the priority of the expected response message. If this is the case, the first component and/or workstation waits until no further message or a message of lower priority was recognised at the fieldbus. This ensures that the response message does not only fail to appear because it is over-written in the course of an arbitration by messages with higher priority.<br>
The invention also relates to a component according to claim 7, in which the component has a control device, which has a transmission means for sending an inquiry message to the machine bus and a recognition means for reading out the bus communication and for recognising a response message resulting from the inquiry message, the recognition means being configured in such a way that if the response message fails to appear, it recognises the non-ambiguity of the identification address of the component and triggers a transfer of the component to normal operation.<br>
A component of this type is provided for use on the textile machine according to the<br>
invention.  The transmission means preferably comprise a transmitter connected to<br>
the fieldbus and the transmission means comprise a receiver connected to the<br><br><br>
fieldbus as well as a processor for processing the messages recognised in the bus communication. The transmitter and the receiver may also be configured as a unified transmitting and receiving device. The behaviour of the recognition means is preferably determined by a computer program stored in a volatile or non-volatile memory.<br>
In a development of the component, it has a signal sensor, which is preferably an optical or acoustic signal sensor, and the recognition means is configured in such a way that when the response message arrives, the signal sensor is placed in an activated state. The signal sensor can be applied directly on the component or else provided at a central point. The attachment is preferably in the direct vicinity of the component, as the specialist personnel can thus directly see which component has recognised an address conflict. Optical signal means such as signal LEDs or signal bulbs or else acoustic signal means such as a loudspeaker, are possibilities as signal sensors.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention emerge from the following description of the embodiments shown in the drawings.<br>

Fig. 5 shows a flowchart of a second variant of the method according to the invention for avoiding an address conflict.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a side view of a workstation 20a of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the present case a so-called automatic cross-winding machine 1. Such automatic cross-winding machines 1 have a large number of similar workstations 20a, 20b, 20c arranged next to one another in a row as shown in Fig. 2, on which, as known and therefore not explained in more detail, spinning cops 3, which have relatively small yarn volumes, are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 5.<br>
The running thread 16 is moreover monitored during the rewinding, as known, for possible yarn defects, which are cleared out if necessary. Moreover, the thread 16 is waxed during the rewinding process. In other words, the thread 16 is guided via a waxing device 19, which ensures that the coefficient of friction of the thread 16 is reduced.<br>
After their completion, the cross-wound bobbins 5 are transferred by means of an automatically working service unit (not shown) to a cross-wound bobbin transporting device 7 along the machine and transported to a bobbin loading station or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br>
As further indicated in Fig. 1, automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type are often equipped with a bobbin and tube transporting system 6, in which, on transporting plates 11, the spinning cops 3 or the empty tubes revolve. Of a bobbin and tube transporting system 6 of this type, only the cop supply section 24, the<br><br><br>
reversibly drivable storage section 25, one of the transverse transporting sections 26 leading to the winding head 20a and the tube return section 27 are shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The individual workstations 20a to 20c furthermore have various devices, which ensure proper operation of workstations 20a to 20c of this type. Devices of this type are known per se and therefore only indicated in Fig. 1.<br>
One of these known devices is, for example, the winding mechanism 4, which has a creel 8 moveably mounted about a pivot pin 12.<br>
According to the present embodiment, the cross-wound bobbin 5 rests, during the winding process, with its surface on a drive drum 9 and is entrained by frictional engagement by this drive drum 9 driven by a single motor.<br>
The corresponding drive connected via a workstation fieldbus 57 to a workstation computer 22 has the reference numeral 33.<br>
A thread traversing device 10 is provided for traversing the thread 16 during the winding process. A thread traversing device 10 of this type indicated only schematically in Fig. 1 and also known has, for example, a thread guide 13 with a thread displacement lever configured in a finger-like manner.<br>
The thread displacement lever loaded by an electromechanical drive 23 traverses the thread 16 between the two end faces of the cross-wound bobbin 5. The drive 23 of the thread guide 13 is also connected via the workstation fieldbus 57 to the workstation computer 22.<br>
As indicated above, the workstation 20a shown of such automatic cross-winding<br>
machines 1, in the thread running path has a thread tensioner which can be activated<br>
in a defined manner and a thread clearer 15, which is functionally connected to a<br><br><br>
thread cutting device 18. The thread tensioner, the thread clearer 15 and the thread cutting device 18 can also be connected via the workstation fieldbus 57 to the workstation computer 22 to be activated thereby. Directly before the thread traversing device 10 the workstation 20a also has a waxing device 19 which makes it possible to provide the thread 16 with a wax application during the rewinding process. The waxing device 19 is also connected via the workstation fieldbus 57 to the workstation computer 22.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 1, the single drive 31 of the waxing device 19 is also connected via the workstation fieldbus 57 to the workstation computer 22.<br>
Further detailed descriptions of workstations of textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins may be inferred, for example, from DE 199 05 860 Al for a winding machine and from DE 44 04 503 Al and DE 101 39 075 Al for a spinning machine.<br>
The textile machine 1 schematically shown in Fig. 2 has a central computer 59, which is connected to a machine fieldbus 14. Moreover, the textile machine 1 has a direct current voltage supply 60. A large number of workstations 20a to 20c are fitted in the textile machine 1 and are connected in each case to the machine fieldbus 14 and the direct current voltage supply 60. The number of workstations 20a to 20c is not limited to the number shown, but can be extended virtually as desired.<br>
A workstation computer 22 and a transformer 28 are provided in each case in the workstations 20a to 20c, each workstation computer 22 being connected to the machine fieldbus 14 and each transformer 28 being connected to the direct current voltage supply 60. The transformer 28 is used to convert the voltage supplied by the direct current voltage supply 60 to a voltage required for operation and control of the workstations 20a to 20c.<br><br><br>
Moreover, each workstation 20a to 20c, as already described for the automatic cross-winding machine 1, has devices, drives and the like, which are shown schematically in Fig. 2 and designated as components 26a to 26e in a simplifying manner for the following description of the method and can be activated via the workstation fieldbus 57 or the machine fieldbus 14. The number of components 26a to 26e, which corresponds to the already described drives or devices of textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins, can be extended virtually as desired. These components 26a to 26e, in the case of an automatic cross-winding machine, as already stated, may be drives for a thread connecting device including cutting and clamping devices for the thread ends, thread feeders such as a gripper tube for the thread supplied by the cop and a suction nozzle for the thread returned from the cross-wound bobbin, a thread tensioner, a cop changing device or the drive 31 of the waxing device 19 or the drive 23, which controls the displacement of the thread along the cross-wound bobbin 5, as shown in Fig. 1. Other components 26a to 26e may also be connected to the workstation computer 22, such as valves, which control the pressure in suction tubes or splicing channels or the thread cutting device 18 and sensors of various types, such as, for example, the thread clearer 15 or a thread tensile force sensor.<br>
In the case of a spinning machine, the components 26a to 26e may be drives of the draw-in rollers for the fibre band supply, delivery rollers for the spun yarn, drives for the spinning means, a suction nozzle for the thread returned from the cross-wound bobbin, a waxing device and for displacing the thread along the cross-wound bobbin. Valves, for example for the compressed air supply for preparing the thread ends for piecing or sensors may also form one of the components 26a to 26e here.<br>
The components 26a to 26e are each connected to the workstation fieldbus 57, to which the workstation computer 22 is also connected. The textile machine 1 accordingly has a machine fieldbus 14 and a workstation fieldbus 57 in each case per workstation 20a to 20c.<br><br><br>
This hierarchical structure, in which the workstation computer 22 of each workstation 20a to 20c acts as an intelligent converter and control apparatus for the components 26a to 26e, allows a particularly flexible adaptation of the workstation 20a to 20c.<br>
In order to be able to communicate with the individual components 26a to 26e via the machine fieldbus 14 or the workstation fieldbus 57 through the central computer 59 or the workstation computer 22, each component 26a to 26e is allocated an identification address, which is clear for each component 26a to 26e of each workstation 20a to 20c, a clear identification address also being allocated to the individual workstations 20a to 20c. The identification addresses can be preset at the components 26a to 26e and/or the workstations 20a to 20c before their installation or before their start-up after their connection to the machine fieldbus 14 or to the respective workstation fieldbus 57, for example in terms of hardware by a coding element, such as a DIP-switch or the like or in terms of software by a direct input of an identification address into a non-volatile memory of the workstations 20a to 20c or of the components 26a to 26e by means of an input mechanism which can be connected thereto or by automatic generation of an identification address by means of a software algorithm.<br>
The communication of the central computer 59, for example with the component 26c<br>
of the workstation 20b takes place via the machine fieldbus 14 by sending a<br>
command  to  the  identification address  of this  workstation  20b  and/or  the<br>
identification address corresponding to this component 26c.   The communication<br>
within the workstations 20a to 20c takes place in a corresponding manner via the<br>
workstation fieldbus 23, in that the individual components 26a to 26e are addressed<br>
here with the aid of their individual identification address. Thereafter, the command<br>
sequences specific for this can be sent to the identification address of the relevant<br>
components 26a to 26e and converted via a printed circuit board of the components<br>
26a to 26e.<br><br><br>
In a new installation or the exchange of one or more of the components 26a to 26e and/or the entire workstation 20a to 20c, a recognition of the identification address of the exchanged components 26a to 26e or the workstation 20a to 20c is necessary. As the adjustment of the identification address takes place before the installation or the start-up, it is necessary to check whether the preset address is already assigned on one of the fieldbuses 14, 57 for a component 26a to 26e or a workstation 20a to 20c, which is used for direct communication by the central computer 59 or the workstation computer 22. A double assignment of an identification address leads to a command sequence being received and converted by various components 26a to 26e or workstations 20a to 20c so errors in the operating sequence of the textile machine 1 may occur.<br>
Fig. 3 shows newly installed component 26a according to the invention, which is connected to the workstation fieldbus 57. The component 26a has a control device with a main processor 51, a data memory 53 connected to the main processor 51, a transmitting and receiving device 55 connected to the main processor 51 and a signal sensor 17, which generates an optical and/or acoustic signal.<br>
The components 51, 53, 55,17 of the component 26a are supplied with current via a current supply line 56. The data memory 53 is configured as a non-volatile data memory 53. A computer program is stored therein, which is used to initialise the component 26a after the current supply has been switched on. When the component 26a is supplied with current, the main processor 51 starts to execute this program. The mode of functioning of the computer program is explained below with the aid of two variants, shown in Figs 4 and 5.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a first variant for avoiding an address conflict at the textile machine 1.<br>
This method is stored in the form of a computer program in the non-volatile data<br>
memory 53 of the component 26a and is executed after the supply of the installed<br>
component 26a with current.  After the start 30, the main processor 51 produces a<br><br><br>
random number and waits, in a first method step 32, for a timespan corresponding to the random number.<br>
After the expiry of this timespan, an inquiry message is sent, in a following method step 34, to the workstation fieldbus 57, which is suitable to prompt another component 26b to 26e, which is connected to the workstation fieldbus 57 and in an operating state, to a response message. In the simplest case, this may a so-called echo message, which is understood by the receiver specified in the echo message via an identification address to the effect that the latter is sending a response message to signify its readiness to receive. Its own identification address is read by the main processor 51 for this purpose from the data memory 53.<br>
After sending the inquiry message, the control device component 26a, in method step 36, goes into a monitoring mode, in which it merely monitors the communication running on the workstation fieldbus 57. After reading out the bus communication it assesses in a first decision step 37 whether a message has been received. If this is the case, it assesses in a second decision step 38 whether this is a response message as a reaction to its inquiry message. If this is not the case or it has been established in the first decision step 37 that no bus communication has taken place, it checks in a subsequent third decision step 40 whether a predetermined maximum time for passive checking of the bus communication has expired. If this is not the case, the component 26a returns to method step 36 and continues to evaluate the communication.<br>
If, in the second decision step 38, it recognises that a response message was received<br>
to its inquiry message, it proceeds to method step 42, in which it terminates the<br>
initialising method with an optical and/or acoustic fault signal in the form of an<br>
activation of the signal sensor 17. Alternatively, it could also send a corresponding<br>
message to the workstation computer 22. If, on the other hand, it recognises, in the<br>
third decision step 40, that the checking time has expired, without a response<br><br><br>
message having been received to its inquiry message, the control device prompts the component 26a in method step 44 to transfer to normal operation.<br>
By waiting a random time in the method step 32 it is achieved that two components, which are simultaneously supplied with current and which have the same identification address, do not simultaneously send their respective inquiry message, since the two do not respond to this inquiry message according to the invention so that with simultaneous sending of the inquiry message, the two components would erroneously arrive at the result that there is no address conflict.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the flowchart with a second variant. Method steps, which correspond to the method steps of the first variant shown in Fig. 4, are indicated by identical reference numerals.<br>
The second variant differs in that an address area having a large number of possible identification addresses for the component 26a, is predetermined in the data memory 53 of the control device of the component 26a in addition to the computer programme for executing the method, instead of its own identification address.<br>
Following the start 30 of the method, in this second variant, in a first method step 50,<br>
a first identification address is selected from the address area. In method step 34, an<br>
inquiry message characterised with this first selected identification address is sent to<br>
the workstation fieldbus 57. If, in method step 36, a response message was received<br>
at the workstation fieldbus 57 for this specific first identification address and<br>
accordingly the selected identification address has already been assigned, it is<br>
determined in a fourth decision step 52 whether further identification addresses are<br>
available in the address area.    If this is the case, in a method step 54, a new<br>
identification address is selected for the component 26a from the address area and a<br>
new inquiry message with this changed identification address is sent to the<br>
workstation fieldbus 57. Only when all identification addresses in the address area<br><br><br>
have been the subject of an inquiry message and a response message has been received for all the identification addresses, a fault signal is emitted in a method step 42.<br>
The checking can also be carried out in the same manner at the level of the machine fieldbus 14. The procedure is also carried out in a corresponding manner here to avoid an address conflict.<br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
According to the. invention, a textile machine and a component are proposed, which are set up to avoid address conflicts in a fieldbus system (14, 23) of a textile machine<br>
For this purpose, each component (26a, 26b, 26c, 26d, 26e) and/or workstation (20a, 20b, 20c) has a control device, which during the installation of the component (26a, 26b, 26c, 26d, 26e) and/or the workstation (20a, 20b, 20c), before a transfer to normal operation, sends an inquiry message with its pre-set identification address via the machine bus (14, 23), which is suitable to prompt a component (26b, 26c, 26d, 26e) already connected to the machine bus (14, 23) and/or workstation (20a, 20b, 20c) with an identical identification address into a response. If a response message of this type is received, the control device of the component (26a) recognises that it cannot transfer to normal operation with this identification address and reacts accordingly.<br><br></td>
