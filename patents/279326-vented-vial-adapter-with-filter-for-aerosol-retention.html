VENTED VIAL ADAPTER WITH FILTER FOR AEROSOL RETENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention is related generally to vial adapters of the type used in the transfer of<br>
medical fluids between a vial and another medical fluid container, and more particularly to<br>
vented vial adapters useful for safe reconstitution and withdrawal of cytotoxic medicament<br>
from vials.<br>
Background Art<br>
Access ports for injecting fluid into or removing fluid from a container, such as a drug<br>
vial, are well known and widely used. Conventional seals of drug vials generally involve a<br>
pierceable rubber stopper formed of an elastomeric material such as butyl rubber or the like,<br>
placed in the opening of the vial. A closure, typically formed of metal, is crimped over the<br>
rubber stopper and the flange of the vial to positively hold the stopper in place in the opening<br>
of the vial. The closure has an outer size, known as a "finish size." A sharp cannula is<br>
inserted through the rubber stopper to position the distal, open end of the cannula past the<br>
rubber stopper to establish fluid connection with the interior of the vial. In the case of certain<br>
medications, such as those used for chemotherapy or nuclear medicine, the rubber stopper is<br>
made thicker so that increased protection is provided against leakage.<br>
Vial adapters have been found useful in that they can attach the sharpened cannula<br>
that is used to pierce the stopper and move far enough into the vial interior to establish fluid<br>
communication with the vial, to the connection device of another fluid container or fluid<br>
conduction device. For example, the adapter may include a female Luer fitting opposite the<br>
sharpened cannula to receive the male luer of a syringe. The "adapter" therefore adapts the<br>
vial to the syringe, or adapts the sharpened cannula to the male luer of the syringe.<br>
It has also been found useful in some applications to provide a means to attach or<br>
anchor the adapter to the vial to hold it in place while fluid communication between the vial<br>
and another device proceeds so that inadvertent disengagement of the adapter from the vial<br>
does not occur. For example, the adapter may have arms that engage the neck or flange of the<br>
vial and hold the adapter in place on the vial. Other means include a circular slotted housing<br>
that fits around the outside of the vial closure and snaps onto the vial closure under the<br>
crimped retaining cap on the under-surface of the vial's flange thereby grasping the vial neck<br>
flange and the underside of the closure. The circular housing typically has a plurality of claws<br>
 <br>
or other retaining devices that are positioned under the flange of the vial opening thereby<br>
interfering with removal of the adapter from the vial.<br>
It has also been found useful in some applications to have a valve placed in the<br>
adapter to result in a closed system. The valved adapter permits engagement of the sharpened<br>
cannula with the contents of the vial without leakage of fluid from the vial through the adapter<br>
until the valve is purposely opened via a syringe, for example. Then when the second fluid<br>
device has been prepared, it can be connected to the adapter thereby opening or activating the<br>
valve that then permits fluid flow between the vial and second fluid device.<br>
Vials made of glass or polymeric materials, the walls of which are non-collapsible,<br>
require an air inlet when medical fluid is withdrawn to prevent the formation of a partial<br>
vacuum in the vial. Such a partial vacuum inhibits fluid withdrawal from the vial. Typically,<br>
adapters for use with such vials have a sharpened cannula that includes both a medicament<br>
fluid lumen and a vent lumen therein. The vent fluid lumen provides pressure equalization<br>
when fluid is added to the vial or is withdrawn from the vial so that such fluid movement<br>
occurs smoothly.<br>
Many medicaments are prepared, stored,,and supplied in dry or lyophilized form in<br>
glass vials. Such medicaments must be reconstituted at the time of use by the addition of a<br>
diluent thereto. Various methods of adding the diluent to the dry or lyophilized<br>
medicament have been used over the years. One method that is commonly used is the vial<br>
adapter technique in which the diluent that may be contained in a bottle or a syringe is<br>
connected to the vial adapter which has a sharpened cannula. Once connected to the diluent<br>
container, the sharpened cannula is then forced,through the closure and rubber septum of<br>
the vial to communicate the diluent to the dry or lyophilized medicament residing in the<br>
vial. After reconstitution, the liquid is usually withdrawn from the vial into the intravenous<br>
solution bottle or syringe, or other container for administration to the patient through an<br>
intravenous ("IV") administration set or by other means.<br>
For such reconstitution activities, a vented vial adapter is used to avoid any<br>
difficulties with a partial vacuum or high pressure inside the vial, as discussed above. These<br>
are sometimes known as pressure-equalizing vial adapters. However, with some vented vial<br>
adapters this technique is unsatisfactory because both the dry or lyophilized material and the<br>
diluent can be exposed to ambient airborne bacterial contamination during withdrawal of the<br>
reconstituted medical fluid if a filter is not present in the vial adapter.<br>
 <br>
During the reconstitution process of certain medical fluids, such as chemotherapy<br>
fluids or nuclear medicines, it is also desirable to avoid contamination of the surrounding air<br>
resulting from the formation of aerosols or drops in the vial. As used herein, aerosols are<br>
suspensions of solid or liquid particles in a gas, such as air. Contamination is possible during<br>
the injection of the diluent into the vial because more material is being added to the closed<br>
space of the vial and therefore, the vent of the adapter must channel away an equal amount of<br>
air from the vial to make room for the additive. If this air removed from the vial is channeled<br>
to the outside atmosphere, such contamination can lead to problems, among other things, in<br>
the form of allergic reactions in the exposed personnel, especially when the air is contaminated<br>
with cytotoxic drugs, chemotherapeutic drugs, anesthetics, media containing isotopes, and<br>
allergy inducing substances of various kinds.<br>
It would also be desirable to provide a vented vial adapter for use with non-collapsible<br>
containers that is designed to prevent aerosolizing of liquid material into the ambient<br>
atmosphere as reconstitution occurs. It is desirable for the person performing the procedures<br>
to avoid contacting the medications, especially the inhalation of aerosolized medications. A<br>
vial adapter with sufficient venting and filtering is necessary to avoid such aerosolizing.<br>
In prior vented vial adapters, a vent lumen in the sharpened cannula leads to a filter<br>
that opposes the entry of paniculate matter and bacteria into the vial during medicament<br>
withdrawal or aspiration. The filter also opposes venting to the outside atmosphere. A<br>
disadvantage of prior devices is their limited ability to retain aerosols of medicament. Typical<br>
adapters employ a membrane filter formed with a pore size of about 0.2 microns. Aerosols<br>
of many medications are known to pass through such filters.<br>
Hence, those skilled in the art have recognized a need for a pressure-equalizing vial<br>
adapter having a filter for preventing bacteria and other contaminants from reaching the<br>
contents of the vial during withdrawal of the reconstituted contents of the vial contents, and<br>
having improved aerosol retention capability so that reconstituted contents of the vial that<br>
become aerosolized do not escape the vial to the ambient environment. The present invention<br>
fulfills these needs and others.<br>
Briefly and in general terms, the present invention is directed to a system and a<br>
method for use in reconstituting medicaments in rigid vials in which a filter is provided to<br>
inhibit the communication of aerosols of the vial medicament from leaving the vial and<br>
entering the surrounding atmosphere.<br>

Referring now to the drawings in more detail in which like reference numerals refer<br>
to like or corresponding devices among the views, mere is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 a view of<br>
an embodiment of a vial adapter 20 in accordance with aspects of the invention. The vial<br>
adapter comprises a body portion 22, a slotted vial attachment housing 24, a vent arm 26<br>
formed at a ninety degree angle to the longitudinal axis 27 of the body portion in this<br>
embodiment, a filter apparatus 28, a needle-free valve connector 30 having an internal valve<br>
32, external threads 33 for coupling to a male connector, a female luer connection port 34, and<br>
a sharpened cannula 44 for piercing the septa of sealed vials. The needle-free valve connector<br>
30 may take different forms. One form is the SmartSite valve connector from the ALARIS<br>
Products division of Cardinal Health, San Diego, California. Details on the construction and<br>
operation of such a connector are located in U.S. Patent No. 5,676,346 to Leinsing,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Referring in more detail to FIG. 2, a part of a vial 110 is also shown. The vial includes<br>
a rigid wall 112 that does not expand or collapse as fluid is being introduced to the vial or<br>
fluid is withdrawn from the vial, respectively. The vial includes a vial flange 114 with an<br>
opening 116 that permits access the internal chamber 118 of the vial. In this view, the<br>
 <br>
opening of the vial is sealed with a septum 120 that includes a septum flange 122 covering a<br>
portion of the vial flange. Securing the septum in place is a crimped closure 124 that is<br>
formed over the septum on the top of the vial flange, extending around the outer surface 126<br>
of the vial flange, and crimped to the under-surface 128 of the vial flange thereby securely<br>
retaining the septum in position to seal the opening of the vial. The closure includes a port<br>
130 through which a sharpened cannula may be forced to make fluid communication with the<br>
internal chamber of the vial. In the case of FIG. 2, the sharpened cannula 44 of the vial<br>
adapter 20 positioned above the vial 110 may be used. Even though FIG. 2 is not drawn to<br>
scale, it will be noted that the vial attachment housing 24 is sized to fit over the vial flange<br>
114 while the cannula extends into the vial inner chamber 118 for fluid communication. The<br>
slots 36 enable the housing to flex outward thereby expanding to accept the vial flange and<br>
closure 124. For further details on the slotted housing 24 for connecting to vials, see U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,875,205 to Leinsing, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 3 shown in cross-sectJGn, the needle-free<br>
connector 30 includes an elastomeric, resilient piston 37 having a piston head 38 attached to a<br>
spring section 39. The spring section biases the piston head into the closed configuration<br>
shown in FIG. 3. The piston head incfudes a naturally-open bore 35 that is naturally open and<br>
selfopens when the piston head is pushed into the larger diameter 56 section of the body 22.<br>
This action also causes the spring section of the piston to compress, storing energy to return<br>
the piston head to the closed position at which the bore closes.<br>
FIG. 3 also shows the filter apparatus 28 in perspective and is described below in<br>
relation to FIGS. 4, 5, and 10 in greater detail. The filter apparatus has a filter stem 40 that<br>
fits over the side vent arm 26 of the body member 22 and an elongate filter chamber 42<br>
oriented at an angle from the longitudinal axis 27 of the body member. The side vent arm of<br>
the body may be at different angles than that shown and the connection of the filter apparatus<br>
to the side arm may take other configurations than that shown. As shown in FIG. 3, the valve<br>
32 is in fluid communication with the cannula 44 that is oriented along the longitudinal axis<br>
27 within the vial attachment housing 24. The cannula enters the internal space 118 of the vial<br>
110 (FIG. 2) when the housing is pressed onto a vial, as described above. An open channel or<br>
slot 48 is formed in the cannula in this embodiment to guide fluid to the valve 32 and to<br>
permit an acceptable flow rate of the medicament when the valve is in its open orientation.<br>
In the cross-sectional perspective view of FIG. 3 a medicament opening 50 in the<br>
 <br>
sharpened cannula 44 is located adjacent the open channel or slot 48 formed in the cannula.<br>
The medicament opening is part of a medicament lumen 52 extending through the sharpened<br>
cannula and the body portion 22. The medicament lumen is in fluid communication with the<br>
valve 32. Adjacent the valve is an enlarged cylindrical cavity 56 formed in the body portion.<br>
In this cavity, a circular groove 58 is formed to retain one end of the piston 38. Also shown in<br>
FIG. 3 is an anchor device 60 in the form of claws for grasping the underside of a vial flange<br>
114 (FIG. 2) to securely retain the vial adapter 20 to the vial 110.<br>
The cross-sectional view of FIG. 3 permits closer inspection of the medicament<br>
opening 50 and the medicament lumen 52 in the cannula 44. It can be seen that the<br>
medicament opening is approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 27 of the<br>
cannula. To allow enough fluid access to the opening 50 so that an adequate medicament flow<br>
rate can be obtained, the open channel or slot 48 has been formed in the side of the cannula<br>
from the sharp tip 46 to the medicament opening 50 so that more fluid may flow through the<br>
medicament opening.<br>
Although not shown completely, a vent lumen 62 can be seen. The vent lumen is<br>
separate from the medicament lumen 52 in this embodiment. A vent lumen opening 66 on the<br>
cannula 44 is visible at the sharpened tip 46 of the cannula in this embodiment.<br>
FIG. 4 presents a clearer view of the path of the vent lumen 62 through the vial<br>
adapter 20. In this embodiment, the piston and valve have been removed for clarity of<br>
illustration of the vent system. A mounting structure 63 for the needle free connector 30 (not<br>
shown) forms a part of the body portion 22 in this embodiment. The body portion 22 includes<br>
a right angle vent lumen portion 64 leading to a larger vent cavity 70 in the vent arm 26. The<br>
filter apparatus 28 is mounted over the vent arm in a secure fashion so that any fluid that<br>
moves through the vent pathway of the vial adapter must be filtered by the filter apparatus.<br>
The construction and operation of the filter apparatus is described in further detail below.<br>
Continuing with further details of the construction of the vial adapter housing 24 in<br>
this embodiment, FIG. 5 presents a plan view of the bottom of the vial adapter of FIGS. 1 - 4<br>
with the filter apparatus 28 removed for clarity and ease of illustration. Shown on the cannula<br>
44 are the vent opening 66 and the medicament opening 50 in relation to radial centerlines 72<br>
and 74 of the housing. The medicament opening and the vent opening reside on a<br>
!<br>
common centerline 72. The intersection of the cefterlines 72 and 74 marks the longitudinal<br>
axis 27 (FIGS. 1 and 2) extending perpendicular to the plane defined by the two centerlines.<br>
 <br>
It will be noted that the medicament opening resides on the longitudinal axis 27 although in<br>
another embodiment, this may not be the case.<br>
FIG. 6 presents a cross-section view of portions of the medicament lumen 52 and vent<br>
lumen 62. Also visible is the right angle vent lumen portion 64 and the vent cavity 70 located<br>
in the vent arm 26. The figure also shows the centerlines 72 and 74. It will be noted that in<br>
this embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the medicament lumen 52 is circular and is<br>
located on the longitudinal axis 27 although it is not centered on the axis. On the other hand,<br>
the crosssectional shape of the vent lumen 62 is, in; general, a polygon having four sides, one<br>
of which is generally concave, facing toward the medicament lumen, and the opposite of<br>
which is convex, facing away from the medicament lumen. Other shapes and locations of the<br>
vent lumen and the medicament lumen are possible as will become apparent to one of skill in<br>
the art.<br>
FIGS. 7, 8, and 9 are provided to show side views of an embodiment of the cannula<br>
44 with the two lumina of the medicament 52 and the vent 62, and the relatively sharp tip 46<br>
so that the configurations of the openings of the cannula can be seen. FIGS. 7 and 8 show the<br>
vent opening 66 with a rotation of ninety degrees between each figure. The vent opening<br>
leads to the vent lumen 62, which extends adjacent the open channel or slot 48, as shown in<br>
dashed lines in FIG. 8. FIG. 9 shows the cannula rotated another ninety degrees which is one-<br>
hundred and eighty degrees from FIG. 7, so that the open channel or slot 48 formed in the side<br>
of the cannula to provide fluid access to the medicament opening 50 on the medicament lumen<br>
52 can clearly be seen. Other shapes, orientations, and locations of openings, slots and<br>
channels will become apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
Returning now to FIG. 4, the filter chamber 42 of the filter apparatus 28 includes a<br>
first opening 76 and a second opening 78. The second opening serves as a vent port to the<br>
ambient atmosphere outside of a vial secured to the vial adapter 20 during use. The first<br>
opening is adjacent the vent cavity 70 of the vent arm 26 and is in fluid communication with<br>
the vent lumen 62 of the cannula 44.<br>
The filter chamber 42 has an internal diameter substantially greater than the internal<br>
diameter of the vent lumen 62, which allows for greater filtering area and flow capacity.<br>
Thefirst and second openings 76 and 78 are separated by a gap 80 in which is contained a first<br>
filter device 82 and a second filter device 84. The first filter device is disposed between the<br>
first opening 76 and the second filter device, and the second filter device is disposed between<br>
the first filter device and the second opening 78. .<br>
 <br>
The outer periphery of the first filter device 82 is attached to the inner cylindrical<br>
wall 86 of the filter chamber 42 in this embodiment such that fluids cannot pass around the<br>
outer periphery of the first filter device. As used herein, the term "fluid" is used in its<br>
common sense and therefore refers to both liquids and gases. However, the first filter device<br>
is configured to allow gas, including liquid particles dispersed in the gas, to pass in either<br>
direction through the first filter device. The first filter device is further configured to prevent<br>
the passage of non-dispersed liquid, that is liquid not dispersed as small particles in gas. As<br>
such, aerosolized medicament in the form of droplets of liquid suspended in air may pass<br>
through the first filter device while the first filter device blocks larger drops or bodies of liquid<br>
medicament from passage through the first filter device.<br>
Preferably, the first filter device 82 is resistant to absorbing liquid or is hydrophobic,<br>
which prevents it from clogging easily with liquid. In addition, the first filter device is<br>
preferably, though not necessarily, configured to prevent bacteria and other microorganisms in<br>
the ambient atmosphere from passing through the first opening 76 and into the vent lumen 62.<br>
The first filter device can be a thin membrane or pad of porous material such as, but not<br>
limited to, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and other vinyl polymers.<br>
Preferably the first filter device 82 in this embodiment has a relatively small pore<br>
size of at least about 0.2 microns. At about 0.2 microns, pores of the first filter element will<br>
block more liquid dispersed in gas, but may reduce the rate at which air pressure inside an<br>
attached vial equalizes with the ambient air pressure. A larger pore size of up to about 3<br>
microns may be employed to increase the rate of pressure equalization while still blocking<br>
larger sized bacteria, liquid droplets, and other particles. The configuration of the first filter in<br>
which it provides a hydrophobic barrier in combination with a small pore size prevents<br>
wetting out of the second filter. Particles that flow through the first filter device are retained<br>
by the second filter device 84, as described in detail below.<br>
The second filter device 84 is configured to prevent liquid particles dispersed in gas<br>
that pass through the first filter device 82 from venting out of the second opening 78 of the<br>
filter apparatus 82. To retain the dispersed liquid particles, the second filter device preferably<br>
comprises pores having a size smaller than pores of the first filter device. The second filter<br>
device may include more than one pore size so that an aerosol of medicament having a<br>
variety of particle sizes is retained by the filter second device. The pores of the second filter<br>
device may also be sized to trap bacteria and particulate matter in the ambient air that is<br>
drawn into the second opening 78 when medicament in an attached vial is withdrawn.<br>
 <br>
The second filter device 84 may comprise particles, pellets, or beads of desiccant or<br>
molecufar sieve material that retain, absorb, bind, or trap particles of an aerosol coming from<br>
an attached vial. Material for the second filter device includes, but is not limited to, highly<br>
porous amorphous silicon oxide, such as Silica Gel, aluminosilicates, such as zeolites, or<br>
combinations thereof. Advantageously, zeolites have porous structures with a polar surface<br>
that preferentially attract polar molecules with an uneven distribution of electron density,<br>
such as molecules of water and other liquids- Preferably, the desiccant or molecular sieve<br>
material is arranged or packed within the filter chamber 42 to form a network of convoluted<br>
pathways and surfaces that attract and retain liquid particles of medicament.<br>
In FIG. 10 there is shown a second embodiment of a filter apparatus 28 having a third<br>
filter device 88. In this embodiment, the third filter device is disposed between the second<br>
filter device 84 and the second opening 78 of the filter chamber 42, the second opening, also<br>
referred to as the vent opening 78, is exposed to the ambient environment surrounding the vial<br>
adapter 20. The outer periphery of the third filter device is attached to the inner cylindrical<br>
wall 86 of the filter chamber 42 such that fluids cannot pass around the outer periphery of the<br>
third filter device. The third filter device is configured to allow gas to pass in either direction<br>
through it, but prevents, or at least inhibits, bacteria and paniculate matter in the ambient<br>
atmosphere surrounding the vial adapter 20 from reaching the second filter device 84 from the<br>
vent opening 78. Because the second filter device is shielded from external contaminants,<br>
more pores of the second filter device are available to absorb liquid particles of medicament.<br>
The third filter device 88 can be a thin membrane or pad of porous material such as<br>
but not limited to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and other vinyl polymers. The third filter<br>
device may be identical to the first filter device 82 in thickness and material type. However,<br>
the third filter device may have a smaller pore size than the first filter device since the third<br>
filter device is not exposed to liquid particles of medicament that may clog smaller pores.<br>
It will be appreciated that the present invention retains aerosols of medicament when<br>
accessing a vial of medicament. When a diluent is added to a vial to reconstitute medicament<br>
in dry or lyophilized form, air inside the vial is displaced by the added diluent and is vented<br>
without allowing particles of the medicament to contaminate the ambient<br>
atmosphere. When medicament is withdrawn or aspirated from the vial, air from the<br>
ambient atmosphere is drawn through the filter apparatus and into the vial interior, thereby<br>
equalizing air pressure in the vial with the ambient atmosphere without allowing bacteria and<br>
particulate matter in the air to contaminate the vial interior.<br>
 <br>
