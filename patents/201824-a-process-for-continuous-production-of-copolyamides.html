				<td>t Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for continuous production of copolyamides based on a lactam (I), a diamine (ii) and a dicarboxylic acid (HI), which comprises<br>
reacting a mixture (IV) comprising a diamine (II), a dicarboxylic acid (III) and water in a first reaction zone at a pressure in the range from 1.3*105 to 2.5*105 pa in the entry zone of the reaction zone and at a temperature above the melting point of polymer (V) to a conversion, based on the molar amounts of diamine (II) and dicarboxylic acid (III), of at least 80% to form a polymer (V),<br>
reacting a mixture (VI) comprising lactam (I) and water in a second reaction zone at a pressure in the range from 5*105 -^o 40*105 Pa in the entry zone of the reaction zone and at a temperature above the melting point of polymer (VII) to a conversion, based on the molar amount of lactam (I), of at least 80% to form a polymer (VII),<br>
then reacting polymer (V) and polymer (VII) with each other in a third reaction zone at a pressure in the range from 1*105 to 1.5*105 Pa in the entry zone of the reaction zone at temperatures above the melting point of polymer (VIII) to form a polymer (VIII), said polymer (VIII) having a 95°C water extractables content, based on lactam (I), diamine (II) and dicarboxylic acid (III), of not more than 10% by weight, and<br>
then extracting the polymer (VIII) with water to obtain the copolyamide.<br>
The present invention further relates to copolyamides obtainable by this process, to their use for producing fibers, sheetlike structures and shaped articles, and to fibers, sheetlike structures and shaped articles based on the copolyamides.<br>
Processes for continuous production of copolyamides from lactams, such as caprolactam, and equimolar amounts of diamines and dicarboxylic acids, such as hexamethyiene adipate {"66 salt"), are common knowledge.<br><br>
DD 110 507 describes such a process where caprolactam, 66 salt and water are fed to the top of a vertical column reactor (VK tube) and polymerized in the tube at elevated temperature and elevated pressure by passing the reaction material downwardly through the tube, and at the same time removing the corresponding copolyamide at the bottom end of the tube. One disadvantage with this process is that vapors escape at the top of the VK tube; this makes it difficult to obtain a consistent high product quality, since the vapors also carry out diamine and, moreover, precise temperature control in the top region of the VK tube is made difficult. In addition, only a small amount of heat can be introduced into the reaction system via the top of the VK tube, so that only small amounts of diamine and dicarboxylic acid become incorporated in the copolyamide in this process. Another disadvantage of the process is that long residence times of about 19 hours are needed for the reaction mixture in the VK tube in order to obtain economical conversions and copolyamides having marketable product properties.<br>
EP-A-0 098 412 discloses a process for the production of copolyamides. In this process, to avoid the reaction material solidifying as a result of the evaporation of the water of reaction, an aqueous 66 salt solution is continuously added at atmospheric pressure to an appropriate prepolymer melt, the temperature of which should never be less than a certain minimum value, and the water is distilled off at the same time. The continuously removed melt is further condensed at atmospheric pressure in a conventional manner. This process likewise has the disadvantage of the maintenance of a constant temperature in the face of the evaporation of the water of reaction, in addition, the precondensation gives rise to losses of diamine, so that a consistent high product quality is difficult to achieve in this process too.<br>
EP-A-0 393 546 discloses a process wherein an aqueous solution of equimolar amounts of a diamine and of a dicarboxylic acid is passed through a tubular reactor at slightly elevated pressure and with concurrent evaporation of water to form a vapor phase and a prepolymer. The prepolymer melt is subsequently mixed with molten caprolactam and passed downwardly through a VK tube to form a copolyamide. The vapors formed at the entrance to the VK tube are separated in a distillation column by removing water vapor via the top of the column and recycling an aqueous diamine solution into the polymerization. One disadvantage with this process is the low flexibility with regard to the production of copolyamides of different morphologies, ie. the distribution of units based on caprolactam and of, units based on diamine and<br><br>
dicarboxylic acid within the copolyamide/ for the same gross composition. In addition, the process, which requires VK tube residence times of 8 to 14 hours, provides only a low space-time yield.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for continuous production of copolyamides based on lactam, diamine and dicarboxylic acid whereby such copolyamides are producible in a technically simple and economical manner while avoiding the disadvantages mentioned.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the process defined at—fche=-beginning, by ec^olyamides obtainable by this process, by the u^e «f suKh' c'bpolyamides foir prodiicittg^ fibbers, sheetlike s-fcruc'tures and shaped articles, and by fibers, sheetlike structures and shaped articles based on such copolyamides.<br>

based on mixture (VI), Particularly preferably, mixture (VI) does<br>
not additionally include a diamine (II) and a dicarboxylic acid<br>
(III).<br>
It is particularly advantageous for mixture (IV) to additionally include lactam (1) while mixture (VI) does not additionally include diamine (II) and dicarboxylic acid (III).<br><br>
according to the invention, a mixture (IV) is reacted at a pressure in the range from 1.3*105 to 2.5*105 ,Pa, preferably from 1.35*105 to 1.5*105 Pa, in the entrance to the reaction zone and at a temperature above the melting point of polymer (V) in the range from 250 to 350°C, preferably from 255 to 2a5°C, to a conversion, based on the molar amounts of diamine (II) and dicarboxylic acid (III), of at least 80%, especially 86 to 96%, in a first reaction zone.<br>
The reaction times should advantageously be in the range from 40 to 600 seconds.<br>
To this end, mixture (IV) may be reacted in reactors known per se for polymerizations, preferably tubular reactors.<br>
The internal cross sections of the tubular reactors may be round or periodically recurringly round and slot-shaped. Reaction times in such reactors may range in particular from 40 to 120 seconds.<br>
The tubular reactors may contain packings, such as ordered internals or loose beds, for example static mixers, packing elements, Raschig rings. Pall rings, especially woven fabric rings preferably from wire net. Such packings may be used to enlarge the internal surface area of the reactor.<br>
The reaction times in such reactors may range in particular from 180 to 600 seconds.<br>
Generally the first reaction zone produces a two-phase mixture of a liquid phase comprising polymer (V) and a gas phase comprising water. The gas phase is advantageously separated from the liquid phase downstream of the first reaction zone.<br>
Generally the gas phase, as well as water, will include unconverted starting compounds and polymer aerosols. After condensation of the gas phase, preferably after subsequent concentrating of the thusly obtained liquid phase in water and a solution of the starting compounds in a conventional manner, for example by extraction, preferably distillation, advantageously in columns, such as packed columns, bubble cap plate columns or sieve plate columns, the columns advantageously having 5 to 15 theoretical plates, the solution which includes the starting compounds may be reused for preparing polymers, for example by recycling into the first or second reaction zone of the process according to the invention.<br><br>
The polymer (V) obtained downstream of the first reaction zone generally has a water content of not more than 2% by weight, especially not more than 0.5% by weight.<br>
The relative viscosity of polymer (V), determined in 1% solution in 96% sulfuric acid at 23°C, is advantageously from 1.2 to 1.3. The polymer preferably has a carboxyl end group content of from 300 to 350 mmol/kg. The amino end group content is advantageously from 300 to 350 mmol/kg.<br>
According to the invention, a mixture (VI) is reacted in a second reaction zone at a pressure in the range from 5*10^ to 40*10^ pa, preferably 15*10^ to 25*10^ Pa, and at a temperature above the melting point of polymer (VII) to a conversion, based on the molar amount of lactam (I), of at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, especially at least 87%. The reaction times should advantageously be in the range from 0-2 to 3 hours, especially from 0.2 to 2 hours.<br>
To this end, mixture (VI) can be reacted in reactors known per se for polymerizations, preferably tubular reactors.<br>
The tubular reactors may advantageously contain ordered mixing elements, such as Sulzer packings, or random mixing elements, such as packing elements, for example Raschig rings, balls or Pall rings.<br>
The temperature of the reaction mixture should advantageously be such that the reaction mixture forms a single liquid phase during the reaction. At the point of entry of mixture (VI) into the second reaction zone the temperature is advantageously in the range from 230 to 31Q°C, especially from 240 to 290°C.<br>
The usually exothermic reaction of mixture (VI) to form the polymer (VII) may raise the temperature of the reaction mixture, contemplated temperature increases ranging from 10 to 50°C.<br>
The reaction mixture leaving the second reaction zone may then with advantage be adiabatically decompressed, advantageously to a final pressure from 1*10^ Pa to 1.5*10^ Pa, preferably from 1.05*10S Pa to 1.1*105 Pa.<br>
This adiabatic decompression is generally accompanied by the evaporation of the water present in the reaction mixture. This will cool the reaction mixture. The temperature of the reaction<br><br>
mixture following adiabatic decompression is customarily from 22K) to 300°C, preferably from 230 to 270°C.<br>
Generally the water obtained in the course of the adiabatic evaporation includes unconverted starting compounds, polymer aerosols and oligomers. After condensation of the gas phase, preferably after subsequent concentrating of the thuswise obtained liquid phase in water and a solution of the starting compounds, polymer aerosols and oligomers in a conventional manner, for example by extraction, preferably distillation, advantageously in columns, such as packed columns, bubble cap plate columns or sieve plate columns, the columns advantageously having 5 to 15 theoretical plates, the solution which includes the starting compounds, polymer aerosols and oligomers may be reused for preparing polymers, for example by recycling into the first or second reaction zone of the process according to the invention-<br>
The invention comprises reacting polymer (V) and polymer (VII) with each other in a third reaction zone at temperatures above the melting point of polymer (VIll) to obtain a polymer (VIII), said polymer (VIII) having a 95'C water extractables content, based on lactam (I), diamine (II) and dicarboxylic acid (III), of not more than 10% by weight.<br>
The reaction times should advantageously be in the range from 3 to 8 hours, preferably from 5 to 6 hours.<br>
The temperatures should advantageously be in the range from 240 to 285°C, preferably from 250 to 280°C.<br>
Advantageously polymer (V) and polymer (VII) are intensively mixed with each other in a conventional manner, such as by stirring, prior to the reaction.<br>
The reaction of polymer (V) with polymer (Vli) to form polymer (VIII) may be carried out in reactors known per se for polymerizations, preferably tubular reactors, in which case the tubular reactor is preferably disposed vertically.-In this case, the mixture of polymer (V) with polymer (VII) may be fed at the bottom, preferably at the top end of the reactor.<br>
The polymer (VIII) obtained downstream of the third reaction zone has a relative viscosity, determined in 1% solution in 96% sulfuric acid at 23°C, of preferably from 2.0 to 3.0. The amount of 95°C  water extractables is from 3.5 to 10% by weight, preferably from 5 to 8% by weight, based on polymer (VIII). The<br><br>
level of triamines is generally less than 0.06% by weight based on polymer (VIII).<br>
Polymer (VIII) which is liquid downstream of the third reaction zone may be further processed in a conventional manner, for example cast into strands, solidified and pelletized.<br>
According to the invention, polymer (VIII) is subsequently extracted, preferably with water. The temperature range from 80 to 120'C is advantageous for this.<br>
The solution obtained in this extraction generally has an organics content of from 4 to 15% by weight. The organics content may with advantage be subsequently concentrated to 60 to 90% by i weight, especially 75 to 85% by weight, in a conventional manner, for example by distilling the solvent off in a single- or multi-stage distillation plant.<br>
It is advantageous to add lactam (I) to the solution prior to the concentrating. This significantly reduces the precipitation of lactam oligomers during the concentrating.<br>
It is likewise advantageous to add lactam (I) during the extraction of polymer (VIII). This can improve the extraction performance. It is advantageous for the ratio of added amount of lactam to pure extract to be in the range from 0.1 to 4, preferably from 0.5 to 1, based on the extract. Such a process is described in DE-A-25 01 348 for example.<br>
The solution obtained in the extraction may (preferably after concentrating) subsequently be used for polymerization, for example by recycling into the first or second reaction zone of the process according to the invention.<br>
The copolyamide obtained after the extraction is then generally dried in a conventional manner.<br>
Advantageously this may be accomplished using inert gases, such as nitrogen or superheated steam, as heat media, for example in countercurrent. In the process, the desired viscosity, determined in 1% solution in 96% sulfuric acid at 23°C, may be obtained by heat treatment at elevated temperature, preferably at from 150 to IBB-'C.<br>
Furthermore, the process of the invention may also include a step of chain extension, chain regulation or a branching or a combination of two or three such measures. To this end.<br><br>
substances known to one skilled in the art for branching, chain regulating or chain extending polymers, such as monofunctional amines or carboxylic acids or trifunctional amines or carboxylic acids, for example propionic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid or triacetonediamine, or di- or trifunctional isocyanates, such as toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (TDI), toluene 2,6-diisocyanate (TDI), 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDi), 2,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), p-phenylene diisocyanate (PDl), naphthalene 1,5-diisocyanate (NDI), 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), 4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate (Hi2MDI), 1,4-cyclohexane diisocyanate (CHDI), bis(isocyanatomethyl)cyclohexane (HeXDl, DDI), tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate (TMXDI), triphenylmethane triisocyanate, may be used before, in or after the individual reaction stages. Such compounds and their use are described for example in EP-A-0 345 648.<br>
