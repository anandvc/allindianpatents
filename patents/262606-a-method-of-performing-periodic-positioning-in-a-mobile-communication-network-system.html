Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a mobile communications system, and particularly,<br>
to a periodic positioning method in a Secure User Plane Location (SUPL) based<br>
position information system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	In general, a mobile communications system has a function unit related to<br>
calculating of position of a mobile communications terminal (referred to as just a<br>
'terminal1 hereafter) in a mobile communications network, and thus provides location<br>
services for transferring the location (position) of the terminal to a certain entity pe-<br>
riodically or according to a user's request.<br>
[3]	Networks related to the location services have different structures according to an<br>
inner network structure of 3GPP or 3GPP2. The position of the terminal can be<br>
calculated using a cell-ID method for transferring a cell ID to which the terminal<br>
belongs, a method in which a time taken by transferring a radio wave from a terminal<br>
to each base station is calculated and a location (position) of the terminal is then<br>
calculated using a triangulation, a method using a Global Positioning System (GPS),<br>
and the like.<br>
[4]	However, in order to provide location services to a user using the position<br>
calculation (positioning) method, considerable signaling and position information<br>
should be sent and received between the terminal and a location server. The so-called<br>
positioning technologies that have been standardized for providing such location<br>
services, namely, a location service based upon the location (position) of a terminal,<br>
are undergoing rapid widespread dissemination. The technologies can typically be<br>
provided through a user plane and a control plane. A Secure User Plane Location<br>
(SUPL), which is well-known as an example of the positioning technologies, provides<br>
the location services through the user plane<br>
[5]	The SUPL is an efficient method for transferring location (position) information<br>
required for the positioning of a terminal. The SUPL protocol transfers positioning<br>
assistance information such as Global Positioning System (GPS) assistance. The SUPL<br>
employs a user plane data bearer to carry positioning technology associated protocols<br>
between the mobile terminal and a network.<br>
[6]	In general, in a positioning system, a SUPL network related to a location service<br>
roughly includes a SUPL agent, SUPL Location Platform (SLP) and SUPL Enabled<br><br>
Terminal (SET). The SUPL agent denotes a logical service access point using position<br>
information which is actually measured. The SLP denotes a SUPL service access point<br>
within a network portion where network resources are accessed to obtain position in-<br>
formation. The SET denotes a device for communicating with the SUPL network using<br>
a SUPL interface. The SET may denote, for instance, one of a User Equipment (UE) of<br>
UMTS, a Mobile Station (MS) of GSM, an IS-95 MS, a laptop computer having a SET<br>
function, Personal Digital Assistances (PDAs) or the like. The SET may also denote<br>
various terminals which access through a Wideband LAN (WLAN).<br>
[7]	The SET supports various procedures defined by the SUPL by being connected to<br>
the network through the user plane bearer. Here, a network that a user has originally<br>
registered is referred to as a home network. When a user moves and thus is located at<br>
another area which is not in the home network area, the corresponding area is referred<br>
to as a visited network. The SLP within the home network is called as a Home-SLP<br>
(H-SLP), and the SLP within the visited network is called as a Visited-SLP (V-SLP).<br>
Here, upon initiating a SUPL procedure at the network, an SLP to which an external<br>
client is initially connected is referred to as a Requesting SLP (R-SLP). The R-SLP is a<br>
logical entity which may be either the same as the H-SLP or not. In addition, a SET<br>
which is a target for a current positioning (i.e., location tracking) is defined as a target<br>
SET.<br>
[81	The SLP, as a network element, may include a SUPL Positioning Center (SPC)<br>
which is an entity for calculating an actual position, and a SUPL Location Center<br>
(SLC) which manages functions of the SLP other than calculating location (position)<br>
information, for example, functions of roaming and resource management. Therefore,<br>
the SET may calculate the position information (i.e., perform positioning) through a<br>
communication with the SPC via the SLC (i.e., proxy mode), and may calculate the<br>
position information (i.e., perform positioning) by being direcdy connected to the SPC<br>
(i.e., non-proxy mode).<br>
[9]	The SUPL based immediate positioning method has been disclosed in the related<br>
art, however, a SUPL based periodic positioning methods has not been proposed<br>
therein.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>

per each positioning period according to the sent trigger information; and exchanging<br>
(sending and receiving) consecutive messages between the location server and the<br>
target terminal to calculate a position of the terminal, and sending the calculated<br>
position value of the terminal to the client.<br>
[12]	According to another embodiment of the present invention, a periodic positioning<br>
method in a mobile communications system may comprise: receiving in a terminal a<br>

from the location server to terminate the trigger session.<br>
[13]	Preferably, the trigger type information indicates a periodic service type.<br>
[14]	Preferably, the trigger parameters include at least a period for the periodic po-<br>
sitioning and starting time and ending time of the periodic positioning.<br>
[15]	Preferably, the periodic positioning method in the mobile communications system<br>
may further comprise sending a positioning request message including trigger<br>
parameters related to positioning for the target terminal from an agent to the location<br>
server.<br>
[16]	According to still another embodiment of the present invention, a periodic po-<br>
sitioning method in a mobile communications system may comprise: receiving a<br>
session-start message from a terminal; sending a session response message from a<br>
location server to the terminal; receiving a positioning initiating message sent by the<br>
terminal based upon a periodic trigger condition; performing the positioning between<br>
the terminal and the location server; and receiving a report message including the po-<br>
sitioning result from the location server.<br>
[17]	According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a periodic po-<br>
sitioning method in a mobile communications system may comprise: receiving a<br>
session-start message from a terminal; sending a session response message from a<br>
location server to the terminal; receiving a positioning initiating message sent by the<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[33]	Description will now be given in detail of the present invention, with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
[34]	The present invention can be implemented in a SUPL network. However, the<br>
present invention may be employed to radio (wireless) communication systems which<br>
are operated based upon different specifications. Hereinafter, the preferred em-<br>
bodiments of the present invention will be explained.<br>
[35]	The present invention proposes a periodic positioning method in a SUPL based<br>
position information (positioning) system. Especially, the present invention proposes a<br>
method for performing a periodic positioning by allowing each of server and terminal<br>
to manage a trigger generating the periodic positioning.<br>
[36]	In general, location services provided in a SUPL based positioning system may<br>
classified into a service by a network (i.e., Network-initiated case) and a service by a<br>
SET (i.e., SET-initiated case). The location services may be classified into a proxy<br>
mode that the SET performs positioning by directly exchanging messages with a H-<br>
SLP of a home network, and a non-proxy mode that the SET performs positioning by<br>
exchanging messages with a SUPL Location Center (SLP) and a SUPL Positioning<br>
Center (SPC) within the H-SLP.<br>
[37]	In the present invention, a periodic positioning is divided into a Network-trigged<br>
case or a SET-trigged case according to a subject which manages trigger information.<br>
The divided cases will be re-classified into a service by a network (i.e., Network-<br>
initiated case and a service by the SET (i.e., SET-initiated case) to thusly be explained.<br>
[38]	Fig. 1 is a view illustrating a periodic positioning procedure in accordance with a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention. The first embodiment of the present<br>
invention illustrates a Network-trigged case and a Network-initiated case for a Non-<br>
Roaming Proxy mode. Here, the SLP corresponds to a network side, while a target<br>
SET (referred to as SET hereafter) corresponds to a terminal side.<br>
[39]	When an outer LCS client requests a periodic positioning, a SUPL agent requests<br>
the positioning from the SLP using a Mobile Location Protocol (MLP) Trigged<br>
Location Reporting Request (TLRR) message (S10).<br>
[40]	The MLP TLRR message may include parameters such as ms-id, client-id, QoP,<br>
and tlrr_event which is a positioning related trigger parameter. Here, ms-id denotes a<br>
positioning target (SET), QoP denotes an accuracy (e.g., a time delay and a spatial<br>
accuracy) of a result for the positioning (location tracking) desired by the client, and<br>
tlrr_event denotes a definition of the 'periodic', namely, a starting time and ending time<br><br>
of the periodic positioning (e.g., 8 am to 10 am) and a request period for the periodic<br>
positioning (e.g., a one-hour interval). The MLP TLRR message may further include<br>
parameters related to types of the positioning values (which, for example, represent a<br>
current value or a value obtained in the latest time when it is difficult to tracking the<br>
current value), and parameters for setting priorities with respect to each positioning<br>
request for several positioning requests.<br>
[41]	The SLP having received the MLP TLRR message checks whether the SET can<br>
supports the SUPL by using a lookup table, and then checks whether the target SET is<br>
currently SUPL roaming using routing information (S11).<br>
[42]	If it is checked that the SET supports the SUPL and is not roaming, the SLP sends a<br>
SUPL initiating message SUPL INTT to the SET to start a SUPL procedure with the<br>
SET (S12). The SUPL INIT message may include session-id, SLP mode, SUPL mode,<br>
positioning method (posmethod) to be used, and the like. Here, the SLP mode denotes<br>
an operation mode of the SLP (i.e., a Proxy mode or a Non-Proxy mode), the SUPL<br>
mode denotes types of positioning (e.g., immediate, periodic, deferred), namely,<br>
trigger type information. Here, the SUPL mode denotes a periodic service type po-<br>
sitioning.<br>
[43]	Also, the SLP confirms a privacy of the SET prior to performing the step S11. If the<br>
user requires a notification related to location (position) information, the SLP further<br>
includes a notification parameter in the MLP TLRR message.<br>
[44]	Hence, the SLP sends the SUPL INIT message by including periodic trigger in-<br>
formation therein. This parameter may be used to inform of information related to the<br>
periodic positioning and of the corresponding positioning being executed by the SLP<br>
(i.e., Network-trigged case). Here, the SUPL INIT message may be sent in forms of a<br>
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) push, a Short Message Service (SMS) trigger, a<br>
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) push, or the like, for example.<br>
[45]	The SET having received the SUPL INIT message requests a data connection from<br>
a packet data network (i.e., 3GPP or 3GPP2) when any data connection is not currently<br>
set between the SET itself and a certain network (S13). Once setting the data<br>
connection, the SET stores the trigger information sent by the SUPL INIT message,<br>
and then sends a SUPL START message to the SLP (S14). Here, the SET sends SET<br>
capability information by including it in the SUPL START message.<br>
[46]	The SLP sends acknowledgement (i.e., whether the positioning can be performed)<br>
with respect to the corresponding positioning request to the SUPL agent by using a<br>
MLP Trigged Location Reporting Answer (TLRA) message exchanged (S15).<br>
Thereafter, the SLP sends a SUPL RESPONSE message to the SET in response to the<br>
SUPL START message (SI6). Here, the SUPL RESPONSE message may be replaced<br>
with a SUPL TRIGGER message. In this case, the step S16 is not performed.<br><br>
[47]	Afterwards, when a particular event is generated (for every certain period) based<br>
upon the stored trigger information, the SLP sends the SUPL TRIGGER message to<br>
the SET to start a positioning procedure (S17). The SET then sends a SUPL position<br>
initiating message (i.e., SUPL POS INIT) to the SLP so as to start a trigger session<br>
with the SLP (S18). The SUPL POS INIT message may include at least Location<br>
Identifiers lid indicating a session ID, a base station ID, or the like, versions, SET ca-<br>
pabilities, and the like.<br>
[48]	Accordingly, the SLP and the SET exchange (send and receive) consecutive<br>
messages to execute an actual positioning, and then the SLP or SET calculates a<br>
position of the SET by virtue of the consecutive messages (S19). Preferably, the<br>
messages exchanged between the SLP and the SET may include a session ID,<br>
protocols to be used for the positioning (e.g., RRLP, RRC or TIA-801), etc. Here, the<br>
positioning for the SET may be performed by the SLP based upon a positioning<br>
measurement value received from the SET (i.e., SET-assisted mode), or be performed<br>
by the SET based upon assistance obtained from the SLP (i.e., SET-based mode). Fig.<br>
1 illustrates an example that the positioning is performed in the SET-assisted mode.<br>
However, if the positioning is performed in the SET-based mode, the SET sends the<br>
calculated position value (i.e., posresult) to the SLP using a SUPL REPORT message<br>
(S20). Therefore, the SLP sends the position value, which is calculated by the SLP<br>
itself or transferred from the SET, to the SUPL agent using a TLREP message (S21).<br>
[49]	Afterwards, in th&amp;succeeding positioning period, the SLP and the SET perform the<br>
positioning for the corresponding period by using the SUPL TRIGGER message, the<br>
SUPL POS INIT message, the SUPL POS procedure, the SUPL REPORT message,<br>
the MLP TLREP message, and thereafter send a calculated position value of the SET<br>
to the SUPL agent (S22 ~ S26).<br>
[50]	Then, when the series of periodic positioning procedures are all terminated (ended)<br>
(i.e., when a positioning ending time arrives), the SLP sends a SUPL END message to<br>
inform the SET of the termination of the SUPL procedure (or SUPL session) (S27).<br>
The SET then releases an IP connection with the SLP and releases all of the resources<br>
related to the positioning session.<br>
[51]	On the other hand, in Fig. 1, the SUPL START and SUPL RESPONSE may be<br>
omitted. In this case, the MLP TLRA message may be sent following the SUPL POS<br>
INIT message.<br>
[52]	Fig. 2 is a view illustrating a periodic positioning procedure in accordance with a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention, which illustrates an example that a period<br>
for the periodic positioning is relatively longer than that in the first embodiment.<br>
[53]	As illustrated in Fig. 2, for a long period for the periodic positioning, the SLP<br>
terminates (ends) the positioning for one period at the end of every period using a<br><br>
SUPL END message (here, the SUPL connection other than the SUPL session is<br>
released (disconnected)) (S41). The SLP then executes the positioning for the<br>
succeeding period at a starting point of the succeeding period by using the SUPL<br>
TRIGGER again (S43). Here, the steps (S30-S40) are the same as the steps (S10-S20)<br>
of Fig. 1 except their numerals, detailed explanation for which will not be repeated ac-<br>
cordingly.<br>
[54]	That is, when the periodic positioning procedure with respect to one period is<br>
terminated (ended) (S39), the SLP sends a SUPL END message to the SET to release<br>
the SUPL POS connection with respect to one period (S41). The SLP then sends a cor-<br>
responding periodic positioning value to the SUPL agent using the MLP TLREP<br>
message (S42). Afterwards, the SLP connects (opens) the released SUPL POS<br>
connection using the SUPL TRIGGER message, and informs the SET of the<br>
performance of the positioning with respect to the succeeding period (S43).<br>
[55]	Accordingly, when the corresponding event is generated, the SLP and the SET<br>
execute the positioning for the corresponding period using the SUPL POS INIT<br>
message, the SUPL POS procedure, and the SUPL REPORT and MLP TLREP<br>
messages, and then sends the corresponding position value to the SUPL agent<br>
(S44-S47). When the series of the periodic positioning procedures are all terminated<br>
(ended), the SLP sends the SUPL END message to the SET to inform of the<br>
termination of the SUPL procedure (S48).<br>
[56]	Fig. 3 is a view illustrating a periodic positioning procedure in accordance with a<br>
third embodiment of the present invention. The third embodiment of the present<br>
invention illustrates a Network-trigged case and a SET-initiated case for a Non-<br>
Roaming Proxy mode. Here, the SLP corresponds to a home network side, while a<br>
target SET (referred to as SET hereafter) corresponds to a terminal side.<br>
[57]	First, when a SUPL agent requests a periodic positioning, the SET requests a data<br>
connection from a packet data network (e.g., 3GPP or 3GPP2) when any data<br>
connection is not currently set between the SET itself and a certain network (S50).<br>
Once setting the data connection, the SET sends a SUPL START message to the SLP<br>
to start a periodic positioning request procedure (S51).<br>
[58]	The SET includes a report_criteria parameter in the SUPL START message so as to<br>
set a period, a starting time and an ending time of the periodic positioning request. The<br>
SET then sends the set information to the SLP.<br>
■ [59]	The SLP having received the SUPL START message stores the periodic positioning<br>
information, and checks whether the SET is currently SUPL roaming using routing in-<br>
formation (S52). If it is checked that the SET is not SUPL roaming, the SLP sends a<br>
SUPL RESPONSE message in response to the SUPL START message (S53).<br>
[60]	Afterwards, when the corresponding event is generated, the SLP sends a SUPL<br><br>
TRIGGER message to the SET to start the periodic positioning procedure (S54). The<br>
SET sends the SUPL POS INTT message to the SLP so as to start a trigger session with<br>
the SLP (S55). Here, for the initial period positioning generated, the SUPL TRIGGER<br>
message may be replaced with the SUPL RESPONSE message of the step (S53), or the<br>
SUPL RESPONSE message may be replaced with the SUPL TRIGGER message of<br>
the step (S54).<br>
[61]	Accordingly, the SLP consecutively exchanges (sends and receives) positioning<br>
protocols (e.g., RRLP, RRC, TIA-801, etc.) with the SET using the SUPL POS<br>
message for performing the positioning, thereby calculating the position of the SET<br>
(S56). Here, the positioning for the SET can be performed by the SLP based upon a<br>
positioning measurement value received from the SET (i.e., SET-assisted mode), or be<br>
performed by the SET based upon assistance obtained from the SLP (i.e., SET-based<br>
mode).<br>
[62]	If the positioning is performed in the SET-assisted mode, the SLP sends the<br>
calculated position value (i.e., posresult) to the SET using a SUPL REPORT message<br>
(S57). If the positioning is performed in the SET-based mode, the SLP does not send<br>
the SUPL REPORT message to the SET. Hence, the SET sends the position value<br>
calculated by the SET itself or the position value received from the SLP to the SUPL<br>
agent.<br>
[63]	Afterwards, in the succeeding positioning period, as aforementioned, the SLP and<br>
the SET performs the positioning for die corresponding period using the SUPL<br>
TRIGGER message, the SUPL POS INIT message, the SUPL POS procedure, and the<br>
SUPL REPORT message to thereafter send the calculated position value of the SET to<br>
the SET (S58-S61).<br>
[64]	Then, when the entire periodic positioning procedures are terminated (ended), the<br>
SLP sends the SUPL END message to the SET to inform the SET of the termination of<br>
the SUPL procedure (or the SUPL session) (S62). The SET then releases the IP<br>
connection wititi the SIP and releases all of the resources related to the positioning<br>
session.<br>
[65]	Fig. 4 is a view illustrating a periodic positioning procedure in accordance with a<br>
fourth embodiment of the present invention, which illustrates an example that a period<br>
for the periodic positioning is relatively longer than that in the third embodiment.<br>
[66]	As illustrated in Fig. 4, for a long period for the period positioning, the SLP<br>
terminates (ends) the positioning with respect to one period at the end of every period<br>
using the SUPL END message (i.e., releases or disconnects the SUPL connection)<br>
(S78). The SLP then performs the positioning for the succeeding period at the starting<br>
point of the succeeding period by using the SUPL TRIGGER again (S79). Here, the<br>
steps (S70-S77) are the same as the steps (S50-S57) except their reference numerals,<br><br>
detailed explanation for which will not be repeated accordingly.<br>
[67]	That is, when the periodic positioning procedure for one period is terminated<br>
(ended) (S76), the SLP sends the SUPL END message to the SET and then releases the<br>
SUPL POS connection (or trigger connection) with respect to one period (S78).<br>
[68]	Afterwards, the SLP sends the SUPL TRIGGER message to the SET to inform the<br>
SET of the performance of the positioning with respect to the succeeding period (S79).<br>
Here, when any data connection is set between the SET itself and a certain network,<br>
the SET can request the data connection from a packet data network (e.g., 3GPP or<br>
3GPP2).<br>
[69]	Accordingly, when the corresponding event is generated, the SLP and the SET<br>
perform the positioning for the corresponding period using the SUPL POS INIT<br>
message, the SUPL POS procedure, and the SUPL REPORT message, and, in some<br>
cases, send the corresponding position value to the SET (S80~S82). When the series of<br>
the periodic positioning procedures are terminated (ended), the SLP sends the SUPL<br>
END message to the SET to inform the SET of the termination of the entire SUPL<br>
procedure (or the trigger session) (S83).<br>
[70]	Fig. 5 is a view illustrating a periodic positioning procedure in accordance with a<br>
fifth embodiment of the present invention. The fifth embodiment of the present<br>
invention illustrates a SET-trigged case and a Network-initiated case for a Non-<br>
Roaming Proxy mode. Here, the SLP corresponds to a home network side, while a<br>
target SET (referred to as SET hereafter) corresponds to a terminal side.<br>
[71]	First, when an outer LCS client requests a periodic positioning, the SUPL agent<br>
requests the positioning from the SLP using a MLP TLRR message (S90). The MLP<br>
TLRR message, as aforementioned, may include parameters such as ms-id, client-id,<br>
QoP, tlrr_event, and the like. tlrr_event denotes a definition of the 'periodic', namely, a<br>
starting time and ending time of the periodic positioning (e.g., 8 am to 10 am) and a<br>
request period for the periodic positioning (e.g., a one-hour interval). The MLP TLRR<br>
message may further include parameters related to types of the positioning values<br>
(which, for example, represent a current value or a value obtained in the latest time<br>
when it is difficult to tracking the current value), and parameters for setting priorities<br>
with respect to each positioning request for several positioning requests.<br>
[72]	Upon receiving the MLP TLRR message, the SLP checks whether the SET can<br>
support the SUPL using a lookup table, and checks whether the target SET is currently<br>
SUPL roaming using routing information (S91).<br>
[73]	If it is checked that the SET supports the SUPL and not roaming, the SLP sends a<br>
SUPL INIT message to the SET to start a SUPL procedure (S92). The SUPL INIT<br>
message must at least include parameters such as session-id, posrnethod, SLP mode,<br>
SUPL mode, and the like. The SUPL mode denotes trigger type information, which<br><br>
indicates a periodic service type in the fifth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[74]	The SLP checks a privacy of the SET prior to performing the step S91. If a user<br>
requires a notification related to position information, a notification parameter is ad-<br>
ditionally included in the MLP TLRR message.<br>
[75]	The SLP includes a report_criteria parameter which is a trigger parameter (or<br>
trigger information) in the SUPLINTT message for sending. The SLP uses the<br>
report_criteria parameter to send trigger information related to the periodic positioning<br>
received from the outer LCS client to the SET. That is, the SLP forwards the trigger in-<br>
formation which generates the periodic positioning to the SET (i.e., SET-trigged case)<br>
so as to allow a performance of an actual positioning procedure when the cor-<br>
responding event is generated in the SET. For example, the report_criteria may include<br>
a period, a starting time and an ending time for requiring the periodic positioning<br>
request.<br>
[76]	When any data connection is not set between the SET itself and a certain network,<br>
the SET having received the SUPL INIT message requests the data connection from a<br>
packet data network (e.g., 3GPP or 3GPP2) (S93).<br>
[77]	Upon setting the data connection, the SET stores the trigger information sent<br>
through the SUPL INIT message and thereafter sends a SUPL START message to the<br>
SLP (S94). Here, the SET sends SET capability information by including it in the<br>
SUPL START message.<br>
[78]	The SLP sends acknowledgement with respect to the corresponding positioning<br>
request to the SUPL agent by using a MLP TLRA message (S95). The SLP then sends<br>
a SUPL RESPONSE message in response to the SUPL START message to allow the<br>
SET to start the positioning procedure when the corresponding event is generated<br>
(S96).<br>
[79]	Afterwards, when the corresponding event is generated based upon the stored<br>
trigger information (i.e., per period for the periodic positioning), the SET sends the<br>
SUPL POS INIT message to the SLP to start the positioning procedure with the SLP<br>
(S97). Here, if a TCP/IP connection set between the SLP and the SET is terminated<br>
(released) after sending the SUPL RESPONSE message, the SET must reset the data<br>
connection prior to sending the SUPL POS INIT message.<br>
[80]	Accordingly, the SET consecutively exchanges messages for performing an actual<br>
positioning with the SLP to calculate the position of the SET (S98). Here, the po-<br>
sitioning for the SET may be performed by the SLP based upon a positioning<br>
measurement value received from the SET (i.e., SET-assisted mode), or be performed<br>
by the SLP based upon assistance obtained from the SLP.<br>
[81]	Upon performing the positioning in the SET-based mode, the SET sends the<br>
calculated position value (i.e., posresult) to the SLP using the SUPL REPORT message<br><br>
(S99). Upon performing the positioning in the SET-assisted mode, the SLP does not<br>
send the SUPL REPORT message. Accordingly, the SLP sends the corresponding po-<br>
sitioning value to the SUPL agent using the TLREP message (S100).<br>
[82]	In the succeeding positioning period, the SLP and the SET perform the positioning<br>
of the corresponding period by using the SUPL POS INIT message, the SUPL POS<br>
procedure, the SUPL REPORT message, and the MLP TLREP message, and thereafter<br>
send a calculated position value of the SET to the SUPL agent (S101-S104).<br>
[83]	Afterwards, when the series of the periodic positioning procedures are terminated<br>
(ended) (i.e., at the positioning ending time), the SLP sends a SUPL END message to<br>
the SET to inform the SET of the termination of the SUPL procedure (or SUPL<br>
session). The SET then releases the IP connection with the SLP and releases all of the<br>
resources related to the positioning session.<br>
[84]	In Fig. 5, on the other hand, the SUPL START and SUPL REPORT messages may<br>
be omitted. In this case, the MLP TLRA message may be sent after sending the SUPL<br>
POS INIT message.<br>
[85]	Fig. 6 a view illustrating a periodic positioning procedure in accordance with a sixth<br>
embodiment of the present invention, which illustrates an example that a SET can open<br>
or connect a SUPL session for every period when a period for the periodic positioning<br>
is relatively longer than that in the fifth embodiment.<br>
[86]	As illustrated in Fig. 6, for a long period for the periodic positioning, the SLP<br>
terminates (ends) the positioning for one period at the end of every period using a<br>
SUPL END message (here, the SUPL connection is released (disconnected)) (S120).<br>
The SET then re-sends the SUPL START message to the SLP at a starting point of tfie<br>
succeeding period to perform the positioning for the succeeding period (S122). Here,<br>
the steps (S110-S119) are the same as the steps (S90~S99) except their reference<br>
numerals, detailed explanation for which will not be repeated accordingly.<br>
[87]	That is, when the periodic positioning procedure for one period is terminated<br>
(SI 18), the SLP sends the SUPL END message to the SET to release a SUPL POS<br>
connection for the one period (S120). The SLP thereafter sends the corresponding<br>
periodic positioning value to the SUPL agent using the MLP TLREP message (S121).<br>
[88]	Then, in the succeeding positioning period, the SET performs the positioning for<br>
the corresponding period using the SUPL START, SUPL REPONSE, SUPL POS INTT<br>
messages, the SUPL POS procedure, and the SUPL REPORT and MLP TLREP<br>
messages, and thereafter sends the corresponding position value to the SUPL agent<br>
(S122-S127). Here, the SUPL START message may be used for informing the SLP of<br>
the starting of the positioning for the succeeding period. When the series of the<br>
periodic positioning procedures are terminated (ended), the SLP sends the SUPL END<br>
message to the SET to inform the SET of the termination of the SUPL procedure<br><br>
(S128).<br>
[89]	Fig. 7 is a view illustrating a periodic positioning procedure in accordance with a<br>
seventh embodiment of the present invention. The seventh embodiment illustrates an<br>
example that the SLP sends the report_criteria using a new SUPL TRIGGER<br>
REQUEST message when the SLP can not send the report_criteria using the SUPL<br>
INIT message due to a limitation on the size of the SUPL INIT message.<br>
[90]	That is, the seventh embodiment of the present invention is different from the fifth<br>
embodiment in view of the addition of SUPL TRIGGER REQUEST and SUPL<br>
TRIGGER RESPONSE message, and also in view of the addition of a SUPL mode<br>
(which is a parameter for identifying immediate, periodic, or deferred positioning) to<br>
the SUPL INIT message. Other steps are the same as those in the fifth embodiment<br>
except their reference numerals.<br>
[91]	Hence, upon performing the aforementioned steps (S130~S134), the SLP sends in-<br>
formation related to the periodic positioning to the SET using a SUPL TRIGGER<br>
REQUEST message (S135), so as to make the SET arrange the periodic positioning<br>
according to the corresponding information and to allow the SET to separately perform<br>
a user confirmation. The SET stores the periodic trigger information sent by the SUPL<br>
TRIGGER REQUEST message and thereafter sends a SUPL TRIGGER RESPONSE<br>
message in response to the SUPL TRIGGER REQUEST message (136).<br>
[92]	However, unlike Fig. 5, as illustrated in Fig. 7, the SLP receives the SUPL<br>
TRIGGER RESPONSE message from the SET and then sends a MLP TLRA message<br>
to the SUPL agent (S137). Since the SLP sends to (he SET the SUPL TRIGGER<br>
REQUEST message which includes the trigger information related to the periodic po-<br>
sitioning, and then receives from the SET the SUPL TRIGGER RESPONSE message<br>
in response to the SUPL TRIGGER REQUEST message, only the reception of the<br>
SUPL TRIGGER RESPONSE message can inform that the trigger information related<br>
to the periodic positioning has completely sent to the SET. However, the SUPL<br>
TRIGGER RESPONSE message can be omitted. In this case, the SLP sends the SUPL<br>
TRIGGER REQUEST message and then immediately sends the MLP TLRA message<br>
to the SUPL agent.<br>
[93]	The SUPL INIT message can be sent in a SMS sending manner. Accordingly, when<br>
the report_criteria parameter can not be all included in the SMS, the SUPL TRIGGER<br>
REQUEST message may denote a message for separately sending the report_criteria<br>
parameter, and the SUPL TRIGGER RESPONSE message corresponds to a message<br>
in response to the SUPL TRIGGER REQUEST message. Therefore, both the SUPL<br>
START message and the SUPL RESPONSE message can be omitted in Fig. 5. In Fig.<br>
7, however, for sending the trigger information related to the periodic positioning by<br>
the SUPL TRIGGER REQUEST message and receiving the SUPL TRIGGER<br><br>
RESPONSE, the SET must first send the SUPL START message to the SLP to obtain<br>
an acceptance from the SLP with respect to the periodic positioning included in the<br>
SUPL INIT. Accordingly, only the SUPL RESPONSE message may be Omitted.<br>
[94]	Even in the seventh embodiment of the present invention, for the long period for the<br>
periodic positioning, a procedure can be changed so as to be able to open (connect) the<br>
SUPL session by the SET per every period. In this case, the SUPL START message<br>
and the SUPL RESPONSE message are added for every positioning period prior to<br>
sending the SUPL POS INIT message. If the SUPL REPORT message is not used<br>
(required), the SUPL END message is added following the SUPL POS procedure. If<br>
the SUPL REPORT message is used, the SUPL END message is added following the<br>
SUPL REPORT message.<br>
[95]	Fig. 8 is a view illustrating a periodic positioning procedure in accordance with an<br>
eighth embodiment of the present invention. The eighth embodiment illustrates a SET-<br>
trigged case and a SET-initiated case for a Non-Roaming Proxy mode.<br>
[96]	First, when a SUPL agent requests a periodic positioning, if any data connection is<br>
not set between the SET and a certain network, the SET requests the data connection<br>
from a packet data network (e.g.. 3GPP or 3GPP2) (S150).<br>
[97]	Upon setting the data connection, the SET sends a SUPL START message to the<br>
SLP to start a periodic positioning request procedure (S151). Here, the SET includes a<br>
tlrr_event parameter in the SUPL START message to set a period, a starting time and<br>
an ending time of the periodic positioning request, thereby sending the SUPL START<br>
message to the SLP. That is, the SET is performing the periodic SUPL procedure with<br>
managing trigger information, and accordingly the SET may not send the tlrr_event<br>
parameter to the SLP. However, the sending of the tlrr_event to the SLP is to<br>
previously inform the SLP of information related to resource management and the<br>
periodic positioning.<br>
[98]	The SLP having received the SUPL START message checks whether the SET is<br>
currently SUPL roaming using routing information (SI52). If the SET is not roaming,<br>
the SLP sends a SUPL RESPONSE message in response to the SUPL START message<br>
(S153).<br>
[99]	Afterwards, when a certain event is generated based upon pre-stored trigger in-<br>
formation (at the positioning period), the SET sends a SUPL POS INIT message to the<br>
SLP to start the periodic positioning procedure (S154). Here, the SET can inform the<br>
SLP using an event_trigger parameter that the periodic positioning period has currently<br>
arrived and also can inform the SLP of the remaining period of the entire positioning<br>
period using the event_trigger parameter. Here, if a TCP/IP connection between the<br>
SLP and the SET is terminated after sending the SUPL RESPONSE message, the SET<br>
must reset the data connection prior to sending the SUPL POS INIT message.<br><br>
[100]	Therefore, the SET consecutively exchanges messages for performing an actual po-<br>
sitioning with the SLP to calculate the position of the SET (S155). Here, the po-<br>
sitioning for the SET may be performed by the SLP based upon a positioning<br>
measurement value received from the SET (i.e., SET-assisted mode), or be performed<br>
by the SET based upon assistance obtained from the SLP (i.e., SET-based mode).<br>
[101]	Fig. 8 illustrates the positioning performed in the SET-based mode. However, if the<br>
positioning is performed in the SET-assisted mode, the SLP sends the calculated<br>
position value (i.e., posresult) to the SET using the SUPL REPORT message (S156).<br>
Accordingly, the SET sends the position value calculated by the SET itself or the<br>
position value received from the SLP to the SUPL agent.<br>
[102]	Afterwards, in the succeeding positioning period, the SLP and the SET, as<br>
described above, perform the positioning for the corresponding period using the SUPL<br>
POS FNIT message, the SUPL POS procedure, and the SUPL REPORT message to<br>
thusly calculate the position value of the SET (S157~S159). Then, when the series of<br>
periodic positioning procedures are all terminated (ended), the SLP sends the SUPL<br>
END message to the SET to inform the SET of the termination of the SUPL procedure<br>
(S160). The SET then releases the IP connection with the SLP and also releases all of<br>
the resources related to the positioning procedure.<br>
[103]	Fig. 9 is a view illustrating a periodic positioning procedure in accordance with a<br>
ninth embodiment of the present invention, which illustrates an example that a period<br>
for the periodic positioning is relatively longer than that in the eighth embodiment<br>
[104]	As illustrated in Fig. 9, for a long period for the periodic positioning, the SLP<br>
terminates (ends) the positioning for one period at the end of every period using the<br>
SUPL END message (i.e., releases or disconnects the SUPL connection) (S176). The<br>
SET re-sends the SUPL START message to the SLP at the starting point of the<br>
succeeding period to perform the positioning for the succeeding period (S177). Here,<br>
the steps (S170-S175) are the same as the steps (S150-S155) except their reference<br>
numerals, detailed explanation for which will not be repeated accordingly.<br>
[105]	That is, when the periodic positioning procedure for one period is terminated<br>
(ended) (S175), the SLP sends the SUPL END message to the SET and terminates<br>
(ends) the SUPL POS session for the one period (S176).<br>
[106]	Afterwards, in the succeeding positioning period, the SET re-performs the po-<br>
sitioning for the corresponding period using the SUPL START, SUPL RESPONSE,<br>
SUPL POS INIT, and SUPL POS procedure messages (S177-S180). In this case, the<br>
tlrr_event of the SUPL START message includes a decreased period value. If any data<br>
connection is not set between the SET itself and a certain network, the SET requests<br>
the data connection from a packet data network (e.g., 3GPP or 3GPP2) prior to sending<br>
the SUPL START message.<br><br>
[107]	Accordingly, when the series of periodic positioning procedure is terminated, the<br>
SLP sends the SUPL END message to the SET to inform the SET of the termination of<br>
the SUPL procedure (S181).<br>
[108]	As described above, in the present invention, the periodic positioning method in the<br>
SUPL based position information system can be provided so as to enable a pro-<br>
visioning of various positioning methods to a user.<br>
[109]	As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from<br>
the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the<br>
above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing de-<br>
scription, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its<br>
spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modi-<br>
