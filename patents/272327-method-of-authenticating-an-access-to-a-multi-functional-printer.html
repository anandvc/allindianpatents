				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to the field of printers. Further, this invention relates to a method of confining the usage of printers to only specific users. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and device for restricted access to printers.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The printers which are used in conferences, ad-hoc networks etc need to be utilized judiciously and the usage of the printers is to be restricted to a specific number of users. The existing methods have been explained in figures 1 and 2:<br>
One of the mechanisms to use these printers is to register the user names with the Authentication Print Servers, which will validate the print requests. The user sends a 'print request' to the printer through an authentication server. The authentication server validates this request and if the authentication is successful, then 'print access' is allowed, else print access is denied.<br>
The existing methods which are deployed to provide access to printers for restricted users have some of the limitations as given below:<br>
1.	The existing schemes require an Authentication Server.<br>
2.	A user cannot print from another machine to which some other user has already logged on.<br>
3.	For each user you need an entry in the Authentication Server. This needs more no. of entries in the data base and requires frequent modification to the data base.<br>
Figure 1 shows the existing method of user authentication using Print Authentication Server. The figure shows a user, the authentication server and the printer. Figure shows the user sending a 'print request' to the printer. The request<br>
 <br>
passes through an authentication server. The authentication server validates this request and checks if the user is authorized to perform the said task. If the authentication is successful, then the user is allowed to proceed for the print otherwise print access is denied.<br>
Figure 2 depicts the unsuccessful attempt to print from an unauthorized user using Print Authentication Server. The figure shows a user, the authentication server and the printer. The user first sends a 'print request' to the printer. The request passes through an authentication server. The authentication server validates this request and checks if the user is authorized to perform the said task. If the authentication is unsuccessful, then the user is not allowed to proceed for the print and the access is denied.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is therefore to invent a method and system by which access to printers is confined to specific users wherein users get access to printers through validated / authenticated password.<br>
It is another object of the invention to propose a simple method, for restricted access to printers, which does not need any authentication server.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method for restricted access to printers, which does not need any additional hardware for implementation.<br>
It is another object of the invention to propose a scheme which enables users to access the printers through any of the machines across the network.<br>
The invention pertains to a method which enables access to printers only for specific users.<br>
 <br>
In this invention, user will be provided with a password or a PIN for getting access to the printer/MFP. While submitting a print job, user needs to enter the password/PIN in the Print Application Window. The printer or MFP will validate this, and accept the print job if the password/PIN is configured in the MFP. Administrator can set Password/PIN directly on the MFP using keypad or using network connection from other PC. A single Password/PIN can be shared by multiple users. The user who knows the password/PIN can print from any device which is on the network connected to the MFP. In this method, there is no need for any authentication server. Moreover, this method does not need additional hardware for implementation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention explains a method for restricting access to printer/MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	configuring the password/PIN by the administrator in the printer/MFP;<br>
(b)	requesting for password/PIN by print application when the user selects the print option for a particular document;<br>
(c)	entering the PIN/password in the Print Application Window by the user;<br>
(d)	sending the print job to said printer;<br>
(e)	validating the PIN/password;<br>
(f)	spooling the said print job to the printer if said validation is successful;<br>
(g)	denying the print service to the user if the said validation is unsuccessful; and<br>
(h) notifying the said denial of print service to the user.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further explains a system for restricting access to phnter/MFP comprising:<br>
(a)	a means for configuring the password/PIN by the administrator in the printer/MFP;<br>
(b)	a means for requesting and entering the  password/PIN by phnt application when the user selects the print option for a particular document;<br>
(c)	a means for storing the said password/PIN;<br>
(d)	a means for sending the print job to said printer;<br>
 <br>
(e)	a means for validating the PIN/password;<br>
(f)	a means for spooling the said print job to the printer if said validation is successful;<br>
(g)	a means for denying the pnnt service to the user if the said validation is unsuccessful; and<br>
(h) a means for notifying the said denial of print service to the user.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the<br>
 <br>
claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art on how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
In this invention, users of a particular MFP will be provided with a password or a PIN for getting access to it. In the print application an option for entering the PIN will be provided. While submitting a print job, user needs to enter the PIN in the Print Application Window. The printer or MPF will validate this, and accepts the print job if the password/PIN is configured in the MFP. In case user enters a wrong PIN, user will be notified of this. He can re-enter the PIN and submit the print job.<br>
Administrator can set Password/PIN directly on the MFP using keypad. Administrator can also set the password/PIN using Network Connection from a remote location. A single Password/PIN can be shared by multiple users. The user who knows the password/PIN can print from any device which is on the network connected to the MFP. User can leave this PIN option blank if the MFP is not restricted for its usage. Refer to figures 3 and 4.<br>
Figure 3 depicts the proposed method of using the restricted printers where user enters the PIN in the Print Application Window, which will be validated by the MFP. The user uses a password or a PIN for getting access to the printer/MFP. While opening the print application, user is asked to enter the password/PIN in the Print Application Window. The user enters the password/PIN in the window and submits it along with the print request. The printer or MFP will validate this, and accept the print job if the password/PIN is configured in the MFP.<br>
Figure 4 depicts the unsuccessful scenario where user tries to print with invalid PIN in this new invention. The user uses a password or a PIN for getting access to the printer/MFP. While opening the print application, user is asked to enter the password/PIN in the Print Application Window. The user enters the password/PIN<br>
 <br>
in the window and submits it along with the print request. The printer or MFP will validate this, and If the password is incorrect, denial of service is notified to the user.<br>
Operational Steps of this new Invention:<br>
1.	User selects the print option for a particular document<br>
2.	Print application asks for the password/PIN (if not entered in the step1)<br>
3.	Print request comes to the printer as per existing methods.<br>
4.	The phnt request is submitted to the new authenticator module.<br>
5.	The authenticator module verifies if the specified password is same as the password set by the administrator.<br>
6.	If the password matches the print job is spooled using existing methods.<br>
7.	If the password is incorrect, denial of service is notified to the user.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, mobile communication device, mobile server or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br>
