				<td>The present invention relates in particular to new chemical compounds,<br>
particularly to new substituted indazoles, to compositions comprising them,<br>
and to their use as medicinal products.<br>
More particularly the invention relates to specific new indazoles displaying an<br>
anticancer activity via the modulation of the activity of proteins, and<br>
particularly of kinases.<br>
To date, the majority of the commercial compounds used in chemotherapy<br>
pose substantial problems of side effects and of tolerance on the part of<br>
patients. These effects might be limited insofar as the medicinal products<br>
used act selectively on cancerous cells to the exclusion of the healthy cells.<br>
One of the solutions for limiting the undesirable effects of chemotherapy may<br>
therefore consist in using medicinal products which act on metabolic<br>
pathways or on constituent elements of these pathways that are expressed<br>
primarily in cancerous cells and which would be expressed little or not at all in<br>
healthy cells.<br>
Protein kinases are a class of enzymes which catalyze the phosphorylation of<br>
hydroxyl groups of specific protein residues such as tyrosine, serine or<br>
threonine residues. Such phosphorylations can widely modify the function of<br>
proteins; for instance, protein kinases play an important part in regulating a<br>
wide variety of cell processes, including, in particular, metabolism, cell<br>
proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration or cell survival. Among the<br>
various cell functions in which the activity of a protein kinase is involved,<br>
certain processes represent attractive targets for treating cancerous diseases<br>
and also other diseases.<br>
Accordingly one of the objects of the present invention is to provide<br>
compositions having an anticancer activity, acting in particular with respect to<br>
kinases. Among the kinases for which modulation of the activity is desired,<br>
Aurora2, CDK4, KDR and Tie2 are preferred.<br>
The representation of indazoles among marketed pharmaceutical products is<br><br>
relatively low.<br>
The following documents propose the therapeutic use of indazoles substituted<br>
in position 3 by an amide and in position 6 by a substituted aryl:<br>
Patent application WO 03/078403 discloses indazoles which are substituted<br>
in position 3 by amides and are useful for treating numerous pathologies,<br>
particularly pathologies associated with the central nervous system. An<br>
oncological use, although claimed, is not demonstrated.<br>
Patent application WO 03/051847 discloses indazoles which are substituted<br>
in position 3 by amides and are useful for treating numerous pathologies,<br>
particularly pathologies associated with the central nervous system. An<br>
oncological use, although claimed, is not demonstrated.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that indazoles substituted in position 3 by<br>
a substituent NH-M-R3, where M and R3 are as defined below, and in<br>
position 6 by a substituted heteroaromatic or aromatic substituent exhibit a<br>
substantial inhibitory activity on kinases, and particularly against KDR and<br>
Tie2.<br>
One of the merits of the invention is to have found that the substitution of<br>
indazole in position 6 by an appropriate moiety brings about substantial<br>
inhibition of the kinases KDR and Tie2. Another of the merits of the invention<br>
is to have found the substitution of indazole in position 3 by a substituent<br>
NH-M-R3 where M and R3 are as defined below, is a determinant factor in<br>
obtaining satisfactory activity on the two kinases. Accordingly, a change of<br>
functional group in position 3 of the indazole brings about, systematically, a<br>
drop in the KDR- and Tie2-inhibitory activity.<br>
Moreover, another of the merits of the invention is to have demonstrated that,<br>
even when the indazole is correctly substituted by an appropriate moiety, it is<br>
indispensable for the nitrogen in position 1 of the indazole not to be<br>
substituted, in order to preserve a satisfactory inhibitory activity.<br>

R4, R5 and R7 are advantageously selected from H, F, CI, Br and methyl.<br>
R7 is preferably selected from the group consisting of F, CI, Br and methyl, in<br>
which F is more particularly preferred. This is because it has been found that<br>
the substitution of R7 by a fluorine atom provides a significant improvement in<br><br>
the biochemical activity, especially as regards the inhibitory activity on kinase,<br>
and in particular on Tie2 and KDR.<br>
L-A is advantageously selected from NH2, NH-A, NH-CO-NH-A and<br>

group consisting of bond, CO, CO-NH, and SO2.<br>
R3 is preferably selected from the group consisting of aryl, heteroaryl,<br>
substituted aryl, and substituted heteroaryl. A more particularly preferred R3<br>
is substituted heteroaryl. Among substituted heteroaryls, thienyl, pyrroiyl,<br>
furyl, indolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, imidazolyl, indazolyl,<br>
pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazolyl, and pyridazinyl are heteroaryls of choice.<br>
R4 and R5 are advantageously H. This is because, in this case, a significant<br>
improvement has been observed in the activity with respect to kinases KDR<br>
and/or Tie2, and generally an improvement in the solubility.<br>
Acceptable products corresponding to the required inhibitory activity<br>
conditions may selected from the group consisting of:<br>

radiation treatment. These treatments may be administered simultaneously,<br>
separately or sequentially. The treatment will be adjusted by the practitioner<br>
as a function of the patient to be treated.<br>
The products of the invention are useful as agents for inhibiting a reaction<br>
which is catalyzed by a kinase. KDR and Tie2 are kinases for which the<br>
products of the invention will be particularly useful as inhibitors.<br>
The reasons for which these kinases are selected are given below:<br>
KDR<br>
KDR (Kinase insert Domain Receptor), also known as VEGF-R2 (Vascular<br>
Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2), is expressed only in endothelial cells.<br>
This receptor binds to the angiogenic growth factor VEGF and thus acts as a<br>
mediator to a transduction signal via the activation of its intracellular kinase<br>
domain. Direct inhibition of the kinase activity of VEGF-R2 makes it possible<br>
to reduce the phenomenon of angiogenesis in the presence of exogenous<br>
VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) (Strawn et al., Cancer Research,<br>
1996, vol. 56, p.3540-3545). This process has been demonstrated in<br>
particular using VEGF-R2 mutants (Millauer et al., Cancer Research, 1996,<br>
vol. 56, p. 1615-1620). The VEGF-R2 receptor does not appear to have any<br>
function in adults other than that related to the angiogenic activity of VEGF.<br>
Consequently, a selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of VEGF-R2 should<br>
show only slight toxicity.<br><br>
In addition to this central role in the angiogenic dynamic process, recent<br>
results suggest that the expression of VEGF contributes to the survival of<br>
tumor cells after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, underlining the potential<br>
synergy of KDR inhibitors with other agents (Lee et al. Cancer Research,<br>
2000, vol. 60, p.5565-5570).<br>
Tie2<br>
Tie-2 (TEK) is a member of a class of tyrosine kinase receptors, specific for<br>
endothelial cells. Tie2 is the first receptor possessing tyrosine kinase activity<br>
for which both the agonist (angiopoietin 1 or Ang1) which stimulates<br>
autophosphorylation of the receptor and cell signaling [S. Davis et al (1996)<br>
Cell 87, 1161-1169] and the antagonist (angiopoietin 2 or Ang2) [P.C<br>
Maisonpierre et al. (1997) Science 277, 55-60] are known. Angiopoietin 1 can<br>
act synergistically with VEGF in the final stages of neoangiogenesis [Asahara<br>
T. Circ. Res.(1998) 233-240]. Knockout experiments and transgenic<br>
manipulations of the expression of Tie2 or of Ang1 result in animals which<br>
exhibit vascularization defects [D.J. Dumont et al (1994) Genes Dev. 8, 1897-<br>
1909 and C. Suri (1996) Cell 87, 1171-1180].The binding of Ang1 to its<br>
receptor results in the autophosphorylation of the kinase domain of Tie2<br>
which is essential for neovascularization and also for the recruitment and<br>
interaction of the vessels with pericytes and smooth muscle cells; these<br>
phenomena contribute to the maturation and stability of the newly formed<br>
vessels [P.C. Maisonpierre et al (1997) Science 277, 55-60]. Lin et al (1997)<br>
J. Clin. Invest. 100, 8: 2072-2078 and P. Lin (1998) PNAS 95, 8829-8834],<br>
have shown an inhibition of tumor growth and vascularization and also a<br>
decrease in lung metastases during adenoviral infections or during injections<br>
of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 (Tek) in breast tumor and melanoma<br>
xenography models.<br>
Tie2 inhibitors can be used in situations where neovascularization takes place<br>
inappropriately (i.e., in diabetic retinopathy, chronic inflammation, psoriasis,<br>
Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic neovascularization due to macular degeneration,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, infantile hemoangioma and cancers).<br>
CDK<br>
The progression of the cell cycle is often controlled by cyclin-dependent<br><br>
kinases (CDKs) which are activated by interaction with proteins belonging to<br>
the cyclin class, an activation which ends with the phosphorylation of<br>
substrates and, ultimately, with cell division. In addition, the endogenous CDK<br>
inhibitors which are activated (INK4 and KIP/CIP class) negatively regulate<br>
CDK activity. The growth of normal cells is due to a balance between CDK<br>
activators (cyclins) and endogenous CDK inhibitors. In a number of types of<br>
cancers, the aberrant activity or expression of a number of these cell-cycle<br>
regulators has been described.<br>
Cyclin E activates the Cdk2 kinase, which subsequently acts to phosphorylate<br>
the protein pRb (retinoblastoma protein), resulting in irreversible engagement<br>
in cell division and in a transition to the S phase (PL Toogood, Medicinal<br>
Research Reviews (2001), 21(6); 487-498). Kinase CDK2 and possibly CDK3<br>
are necessary for progression in the G1 phase and entry into S phase. During<br>
the formation of a complex with cyclin E, they maintain the<br>
hyperphosphorylation of pRb so as to aid the progression of the G1 phase to<br>
S phase. In complexes with cyclin A, CDK2 plays a part in the inactivation of<br>
E2F and is necessary for the realization of the S phase (TD. Davies et al.<br>
(2001) Structure 9, 389-3).<br>
The CDK1/cyclin B complex regulates the progression of the cell cycle<br>
between the G2 phase and the M phase. Negative regulation of the<br>
CDK/cyclin B complex prevents normal cells from entering into S phase<br>
before the G2 phase has been properly and completely realized (K.K. Roy<br>
and E.A. Sausville Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2001, 7, 1669-1687).<br>
A level of regulation of CDK activity exists. Cyclin-dependent kinase<br>
activators (CAKs) have a positive regulatory action on CDKs. CAK<br>
phosphorylates the CDKs on the threonine residue so as to render the target<br>
enzyme completely active.<br>
The presence of defects in molecules involved in the cell cycle brings about<br>
the activation of the CDKs and the progression of the cycle; it is normal to<br>
wish to inhibit the activity of CDK enzymes in order to block cell growth in<br>
cancerous cells.<br>
Aurora<br>
Many proteins involved in chromosome segregation and spindle assembly<br><br>
have been identified in yeast and drosophilia. Disruption of these proteins<br>
leads to non-segregation of chromosomes and to monopolar or disorganized<br>
spindles. Among these proteins, certain kinases, including Aurora and Ipl1,<br>
originating respectively from drosophilia and from S. cerevisiae, are<br>
necessary for chromosome segregation and centrosome separation. A<br>
human analog of yeast Ipl1 has recently been cloned and characterized by<br>
various laboratories. This kinase, called aurora2, STK15 or BTAK, belongs to<br>
the serine/threonine kinase class. Bischoff et al. have shown that Aurora2 is<br>
oncogenic and is amplified in human colorectal cancers (EMBO J, 1998, 17,<br>
3052-3065). This has also been exemplified in cancers involving epithelial<br>
tumors such as breast cancer.<br>

The present invention also provides the process for preparing products of<br>
formula (I).<br>
The products according to the invention can be prepared on the basis of<br>
conventional methods of organic chemistry. Scheme 1 below is illustrative of<br>
a method which is used for preparing example 6. In this context it does not<br>
constitute any limitation on the scale of the invention, as far as concerns the<br>
methods of preparing the compounds claimed.<br><br><br>
- Scheme 1 -<br>
It is understood for the skilled worker that, in order to implement the<br>
processes according to the invention that are described above, it may be<br>
necessary to introduce protective groups for the amino, carboxyl, and alcohol<br>
functions in order to avoid side reactions. These groups are groups which can<br>
be removed without affecting the remainder of the molecule. Examples of<br>
protective groups for the amino function include fert-butyl carbamate, which<br>
can be regenerated by means of iodotrimethylsilane; acetyl, which can be<br>
regenerated in an acidic medium (hydrochloric acid, for example). Possible<br>
protective groups for the carboxyl function include the esters (methoxymethyl<br>
ester, benzyl ester, for example). Possible protective groups for the alcohol<br>
function include the esters (benzoyl ester, for example), which can be<br>
regenerated in an acidic medium or by catalytic hydrogenation. Other<br>
protective groups that can be used are described by T.W. Greene et al. in<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, third edition, 1999, Wiley-<br>
Interscience.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are isolated and can be purified by the usual<br>
known methods, such as by crystallization, chromatography or extraction, for<br>
example.<br>
The enantiomers and diastereoisomers of the compounds of formula (I) also<br>
form part of the invention.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) comprising a basic residue may be optionally<br>
converted to addition salts with an organic or inorganic acid, by the action of<br>
such an acid within a solvent, for example an organic solvent such as an<br>
alcohol, a ketone, an ether or a chlorinated solvent.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) comprising an acidic residue may be optionally<br>
converted to metal salts or to addition salts with nitrogenous bases in<br>
accordance with methods which are known per se. These salts can be<br>
obtained by the action of a metal base (alkali metal or alkaline earth metal<br>
base, for example), ammonia, an amine or an amine salt on a compound of<br>
formula (I), in a solvent. The salt formed is separated by customary methods.<br>
These salts also form part of the invention.<br><br>
When a product according to the invention exhibits at least one free basic<br>
function, pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared by reacting said<br>
product with an organic or inorganic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
include chlorides, nitrates, sulfates, hydrogen sulfates, pyrosulfates,<br>
bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogen phosphates,<br>
dihydrogen phosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, acetates,<br>
propionates, acrylates, 4-hydroxybutyrates, caprylates, caproates,<br>
decanoates, oxalates, malonates, succinates, glutarates, adipates, pimelates,<br>
maleates, fumarates, citrates, tartrates, lactates, phenylacetates, mandelates,<br>
sebacates, suberates, benzoates, phthalates, methanesulfonates,<br>
propanesulfonates, xylenesulfonates, salicylates, cinnamates, glutamates,<br>
aspartates, glucuronates, and galacturonates.<br>
When a product according to the invention exhibits at least one free acidic<br>
function, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared by reacting said<br>
product with an organic or inorganic base. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
bases include hydroxides of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cations, such<br>
as Li, Na, K, Mg and Ca, and basic amine compounds such as ammonia,<br>
arginine, histidine, piperidine, morpholine, piperazine, and triethylamine.<br>
The products according to the invention which are prepared in the form of<br>
salts, particularly in a hydrochloride form, may be brought out of the salt form<br>
by the action of an organic or inorganic base in accordance with known<br>
techniques.<br>
The invention is also described by the examples below, which are given by<br>
way of illustration of the invention.<br>
The LC/MS analyses were carried out on a Micromass model LCT instrument<br>
connected to an HP 1100 device. The abundance of the products was<br>
measured by means of an HP G1315A diode array detector over a<br>
wavelength range of 200-600 nm and a Sedex 65 light scattering detector.<br>
The mass spectra were acquired over a range from 180 to 800. The data<br>
were analyzed using the Micromass MassLynx software. Separation was<br>
performed on a Hypersil BDS C18 column, 3 urn (50 x 4.6 mm), eluting with a<br>
linear gradient from 5% to 90% of acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) of<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water containing 0.05% (v/v) TFA over<br><br>
3.5 minutes at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The total analysis time, including the<br>
period for re-equilibrating the column, is 7 minutes.<br>
The MS spectra were carried out using electrospray (ES+) technique on a<br>
Platform II (Micromass) instrument. The principal ions observed are<br>
described.<br>
The melting points were measured using the capillary technique on a Mettler<br>
FP62 instrument, range 30°C to 300°C, with a rise of 2°C per minute.<br>
Purification by LC/MS:<br>
The products can be purified by LC/MS, using a Waters FractionsLynx<br>
system composed of a Waters model 600 gradient pump, a Waters model<br>
515 regeneration pump, a Waters Reagent Manager dilution pump, a Waters<br>
model 2700 auto-injector, two Rheodyne LabPro model valves, a Waters<br>
model 996 diode array detector, a Waters model ZMD mass spectrometer<br>
and a Gilson model 204 fraction collector. The system was controlled by the<br>
Waters FractionLynx software. Separation was carried out alternately on two<br>
Waters Symmetry columns (da, 5 µM, 19 x 50 mm, catalogue reference<br>
186000210), one column undergoing regeneration with a 95/5 (v/v)<br>
water/acetonitrile mixture containing 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid while<br>
the other column was in separation service. The columns were eluted using a<br>
linear gradient from 5% to 95% of acetonitrile containing 0.07 % (v/v) of<br>
trifluoroacetic acid in water containing 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid, at a<br>
flow rate of 10 mL/min. At the exit from the separation column, one<br>
thousandth of the effluent is separated by means of an LC Packing Accurate,<br>
diluted with methyl alcohol at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and sent to the<br>
detectors, in a proportion of 75% to the diode array detector and the<br>
remaining 25% to the mass spectrometer. The remainder of the effluent<br>
(999/1000) is sent to the fraction collector, where the flow is discarded until<br>
the mass of the expected product is detected by the FractionLynx software.<br>
The molecular formulae of the expected products are supplied to the<br>
FractionLynx software, which actuates the collection of the product when the<br>
mass signal detected corresponds to the ion [M+H]+ and/or to [M+Na]+. In<br>
certain cases, depending on the results of analytical LC/MS, when an intense<br>
ion corresponding to [M+2H]++ has been detected, the value corresponding to<br><br>
half the calculated molecular mass (MW/2) is also supplied to the<br>
FractionLynx software. Under these conditions, collection is also actuated<br>
when the mass signal of the ion [M+2H]++ and/or [M+Na+H]++ are detected.<br>
The products were collected in tared glass tubes. Following collection, the<br>
solvents were evaporated in a Savant AES 2000 or Genevac HT8 centrifugal<br>
evaporator and the masses of products were determined by weighing the<br>
tubes following evaporation of the solvents.<br>

Determination of the activity of the compounds - Experimental<br>
protocols<br>
1. KDR<br>
The inhibitory effect of the compounds is determined in an assay of substrate<br>
phosphorylation by the KDR enzyme in vitro using a scintillation technique<br>
(96-well plate, NEN).<br>
The cytoplasmic domain of the human KDR enzyme was cloned in the form of<br>
a GST fusion into the baculovirus expression vector pFastBac. The protein<br>
was expressed in SF21 cells and purified to approximately 60% homogeneity.<br>
The KDR kinase activity is measured in 20 mM MOPS, 10 mM MgCI2, 10 mM<br>
MnCI2, 1 mM DTT, 2.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH = 7.2, in<br>
the presence of 10 mM MgCI2, 100 uM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF. 10 µl of the<br>
compound are added to 70 µl of kinase buffer, containing 100 ng of KDR<br>
enzyme at 4°C. The reaction is triggered by adding 20 µl of solution<br>
containing 2 pg of substrate (SH2-SH3 fragment of PLCγ expressed in the<br>
form of a GST fusion protein), 2 µCi γ33P[ATP] and 2 µM cold ATP. After<br>
1 hour of incubation at 37°C, the reaction is stopped by adding 1 volume<br>
(100 µl) of 200 mM EDTA. The incubation buffer is withdrawn and the wells<br>
are washed three times with 300 µl of PBS. The radioactivity is measured in<br>
each well using a Top Count NXT radioactivity counter (Packard).<br><br>
The background noise is determined by measuring the radioactivity in four<br>
different wells containing the radioactive ATP and the substrate alone.<br>
A control for total activity is measured in four different wells containing all of<br>
the reagents (γ33P-[ATP], KDR and PLCγ substrate), but in the absence of<br>
compound.<br>
The inhibition of KDR activity with the compound of the invention is expressed<br>
in percentage inhibition of the control activity determined in the absence of<br>
compound.<br>
The compound SU5614 (Calbiochem) (1 uM) is included in each plate as an<br>
inhibition control.<br>
2. Tie2<br>
The coding sequence of human Tie2, corresponding to the amino acids of the<br>
intracellular domain 776-1124, was generated by PCR, using the cDNA<br>
isolated from human placenta as a model. This sequence was introduced into<br>
a baculovirus expression vector pFastBacGT in the form of a GST fusion<br>
protein.<br>
The inhibitory effect of the molecules is determined in an assay of PLC<br>
phosphorylation by Tie2 in the presence of GST-Tie2 purified to<br>
approximately 80% homogeneity. The substrate is composed of the SH2-SH3<br>
fragments of PLC expressed in the form of a GST fusion protein.<br>
The kinase activity of Tie2 is measured in a 20 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.2,<br>
containing 10 mM MgCI2, 10 mM MnCI2, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM of glycero-<br>
phosphate. In a 96-well FlashPlate plate, kept on ice, a reaction mixture is<br>
deposited which is composed of 70 µl of kinase buffer containing 100 ng of<br>
GST-Tie2 enzyme per well. Subsequently 10 µl of the test molecule diluted to<br>
a concentration of 10% maximum in DMSO are added. For a given<br>
concentration, each measurement is carried out in quadruplicate. The<br>
reaction is initiated by adding 20 µl of solution containing 2 ug of GST-PLC,<br>
2 µM of cold ATP and 1 µCi of 33P[ATP]. After 1 hour of incubation at 37°C,<br>
the reaction is terminated by adding 1 volume (100 µl) of 200 mM EDTA.<br>
Following removal of the incubation buffer, the wells are washed three times<br><br>
with 300 µl of PBS. The radioactivity is measured on a Wallac<br>
MicroBeta1450.<br>
The inhibition of Tie2 activity is calculated and expressed as a percentage<br>
inhibition relative to the control activity determined in the absence of<br>
compound.<br>
3. Auroral and Aurora2<br>
The inhibitory effect of compounds with respect to the kinases Auroral and<br>
Aurora2 is determined by an enzyme assay employing radioactivity detection.<br>
The kinase activity of Aurora 1 and Aurora 2 is evaluated by the<br>
phosphorylation of the substrate Numa-histidine in the presence of<br>
radiolabeled ATP ([33P]ATP), using 96-well Flashplate plates in which nickel<br>
chelate is fixed to the surface of the microplate. The amount of 33P phosphate<br>
incorporated in the NuMA substrate is proportional to the activity of the<br>
enzyme Auroral or Aurora2.<br>
Proteins:<br>
The proteins are produced in the protein production laboratory of the Sanofi-<br>
Aventis group.<br>
Aurora 1: recombinant complex Aurora-B/INCENP-C3, purified to<br>
approximately 50%, in which the N-terminal end of Aurora-B has been labeled<br>
with histidine.<br>
Aurora 2: whole recombinant protein comprising an N-terminal histidine tail,<br>
expressed in E. coli and purified to more than 82%.<br>
NuMA (nuclear protein that associates with the mitotic apparatus) fragment of<br>
424 amino acids, expressed in E. coli, whose N-terminal end has been<br>
labeled with histidine and used as a substrate for the two Aurora enzymes.<br>
Protocol:<br>
The microplates used are 96-well Flash-Plate plates with nickel chelate<br>
(Perkin Elmer, model SMP107).<br><br>
The products for evaluation are incubated in a reaction volume of 100 µL per<br>
well in the presence of 10 nM of Aurora 1 or Aurora 2, 500 nM of NuMA<br>
substrate in a buffer composed of 50 mM of Tris/HCI (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCI,<br>
5mM MgCI2 (Aurora-B) or 10 mM MgCI2 (Aurora-A) and 1 mM of DTT, at<br>
37°C.<br>
In each well, 80 uL of the enzyme/substrate incubation buffer are distributed,<br>
followed by 10 uL of the product to be evaluated, in variable concentrations.<br>
The reaction is initiated by adding 1µM of final ATP containing 0.2 µCi of<br>
[33P]ATP (10 µL). After 30 minutes of incubation, the reaction is terminated by<br>
simply removing the reaction buffer and each well is washed twice with 300 µl<br>
of the Tris/HCI buffer. The radioactivity is then measured in each well by<br>
means of a scintillation apparatus, Packard, Top count model.<br>
The control enzyme activity of Aurora is expressed by the number of counts<br>
per minute obtained within 30 minutes, after deduction of the background<br>
noise (reaction mixture not containing the enzyme). The evaluation of the<br>
various test products is expressed in percentage inhibition of the Aurora<br>
activity relative to the control.<br>
4. CDK4/cyclin D1<br>
Purification of the CDK4-HA/cyclin D1-(His)6 complex by IMAC (Immobilized<br>
Metal Affinity Chromatography):<br>
Two recombinant baculoviruses carrying the human sequences coding<br>
respectively for CDK4-HA (C-terminal fusion with the Hemagglutinin tag) and<br>
for cyclin D1-(His)6 are used to co-infect S/9 insect cells. Sixty hours after the<br>
beginning of co-infection, the cells are harvested by centrifugation and then<br>
frozen at -20°C until their use. After thawing in buffer A (HEPES 200 mM<br>
pH 7.0, NaCI 50 mM, MgCI2 2 mM, imidazole 25 mM, TCEP 1 mM, glycerol<br>
10% (w/v), NaF 1 mM, Na3VO4 1 mM), stirring at 4°C for 1 h, and<br>
centrifugation, the complex present in the lysis supernatant is purified by<br>
affinity chromatography on nickel (IMAC) and stored at -80°C.<br>
CDK4/cvclinD1 Flashplate assay in 96-well format.<br>
An assay in 96-well "Flashplate" (scintillation plate) plates coated with<br>
streptavidin is used to evaluate the inhibition of the CDK4/cyclin D1 kinase<br><br>
complex by the products of the invention. To perform this test, the biotinylated<br>
peptide substrate, a fragment of the pRb protein, (biotinyl-<br>
RPPTLSPIPHIPRSPYKFPSSPLR-amide), is dissolved at a concentration of<br>
2 mM in kinase buffer (HEPES/NaOH 50 mM, NaCI 1 mM, MgCI2 5 mM, pH =<br>
7.5) to form a stock solution, which is stored at -20°C in the form of 110 µl<br>
aliquots. On the day of the experiment, an aliquot of this solution is thawed<br>
and diluted in kinase buffer containing 1 mM of dithiothreitol, added at the<br>
time of use, so as to give a final peptide concentration of 2.571 µM. seventy<br>
µl of this solution are deposited in each well of the Flashplate plate, to give a<br>
final substrate concentration of 1.8 µM during the enzymatic reaction, which is<br>
performed in a final volume of 100 µl (cf. below). Intermediate dilutions of<br>
inhibitors (products of the invention) at various concentrations are prepared in<br>
DMSO from 10 mM stock solutions in separate tubes. In this way dilutions at<br>
1000 µM, 333.3 µM, 111.1 µM, 37.03 µM, 12.35 µM, 4.11 µM and 1.37 µM<br>
are produced. One µl of each of these solutions (or 1 µl of DMSO for the<br>
controls) is subsequently transferred into the wells of the assay plate. To each<br>
well there is subsequently added 19 µl of a solution of a mixture of adenosine<br>
triphosphate (ATP) and ATPγ33P in the kinase buffer at a concentration of<br>
5.26 µM of total ATP and 78.9 µCi/ml of 33P. The enzymatic reaction is<br>
triggered by adding 10 µl per well of a solution of CDK4/cyclin D1 complex at<br>
250 nM in the kinase buffer, containing 1 mM of dithiothreitol (or 10 µl of<br>
kinase buffer containing 1 mM of dithiothreitol for the reaction blanks). At the<br>
end of the various additions, the final volume in each well is 100 µl, the final<br>
substrate concentration is 1.8 µM, the final inhibitor concentrations are 10 µM,<br>
3.33 µM, 1.11 µM, 0.37 µM, 0.123 µM, 0.041 µM and 0.014 µM (depending<br>
on the concentration of the intermediate dilution), the final ATP concentration<br>
is 1 µM, the final amount of 33P is 1.5 µCi/well, and the final concentration of<br>
CDK4/cyclin D1 complex is 25 nM.<br>
After all of the reagents have been added, the assay plate is incubated at<br>
30°C with orbital stirring at 650 rpm. Following incubation, the plate is washed<br>
three times with 300 pi per well of PBS buffer (phosphate buffered saline,<br>
pH = 7.4 with neither calcium nor magnesium, reference 10010-015, Gibco<br>
BRL). The incorporation of 33P into the substrate peptide is measured by<br>
scintillation counting using a Packard Topcount.NXT instrument. The<br>
inhibitory activity of the products of the invention is evaluated by determining<br>
the concentration of inhibitor resulting in a 50% reduction in the enzymatic<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
