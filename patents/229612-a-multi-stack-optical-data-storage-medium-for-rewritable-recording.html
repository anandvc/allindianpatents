Multi-Stack optical data storage medium and use of such a medium<br>
The invention relates to a multi-stack optical data storage medium for rewritable recording by means of a focused laser-light beam, said medium having a substrate with deposited on a side thereof:<br>
a fu-st recording stack comprisihg a phase-change type recording layer, said first recording stack being present most remote for the focused laser-light beam,<br>
at least one further recording stack comprising a phase-change type recording layer,<br>
a transparent spacer layer adjacent each further recording stack at a side closest to the first recording stack, said transparent layer having a thickness larger than the depth of focus of the focused laser-light beam.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of such a multi-stack optical data storage medium for high data rate recording applications.<br>
An embodiment of an optical data storage medium of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is known from United States patent US 6,190,750, filed by Applicants,<br>
An optical data storage medium based on the phase-change principle is attractive, because it combines the possibilities of direct overwrite (DOW) and high storage density with easy compatibility with read-only optical data storage systems. Data storage, in this context, includes digital video-, digital audio- and software-data storage. Phase-change optical recording involves the formation of submicrpmeter-sized amorphoxis recording marks in a crystalline recording layer using a focused relatively high power laser-light beam. During recording of information, the medium is moved with respect to the focused laser-light beam that is modulated in accordance with the information to be recorded. Marks are formed when the high power laser-light beam melts the crystalline recording layer. When the laser-light beam is switched off and/or subsequently moved relatively to the recording layer, quenching of the molten marks takes place in the recording layer, leaving an amorphous information mark in the exposed areas of the recording layer that remains crystalline in the unexposed areas. Erasure of written amorphoxis marks is realized by recrystallization through heating<br><br>
with the same laser at a lower power level, without melting the recordiiig layer. The amorphous marks represent the data bits, -wiiich can be read, e.g. via the substrate, by a relatively low-power focused laser-light beam. Reflection differences of the amorphous marks with respect to the crystalline recording layer bring about a modulated laser-light beam which is subsequently converted by a detector into a modulated photocurrent in accordance with the recorded information.<br>
One of the most important requirements in phase-change optical recording is a high data rate, which means that data can be written and rewritten in the medium with a user data rate of at least 30Mbits/s. Such a high data rate requires the recording layer to have a high crystallization speed, i.e. a short crystallization time, during DOW. To ensure that previously recorded amorphous marks can be recrystallized during DOW, the recording layer must have a proper crystallization speed to match the velocity of the mediimi relative to the laser-light beam. If the crystallization speed is not high enough the amorphous marks from the previous recording, representing old data, cannot be completely erased, meaning recrystallized, during DOW. This causes a high noise level. A high crystallization speed is particularly required in high-density recording and high data rate optical recording media, such as in disk-shaped CD-RW high speed, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, DVR-red and blue which respectively are abbreviations of the known Compact Disk and the new generation high density Digital Versatile Disk+RW and -RAM, where RW and RAM refer to the rewritability of such disks, and Digital Video Recording optical storage disks, where red and blue refer to the used laser wavelength. For these disks, the complete erasure time (GET) has to be lower than 30 ns. CET is defined as the minimum duration of an erasing pulse for complete crystallization of a written amorphous mark in a crystalline envuonment. The CET is measured with a static tester. For DVD+RW, which has a 4.7 GB recording density per 120 mm disk, a user data-bit rate of 26 Mbits/s is needed, and for DVR-blue said rate is 35 Mbits/s. For high speed versions of DVD+RW and DVR-blue data rates of 50 Mbits/s and higher are required. The data rate for AV-applications is determined by the AV-information stream but for computer-data applications no restrictions in data rate apply, i.e. the larger the better. Each of these data bit rates can be translated to a maximum CET which is influenced by several parameters, e.g. thermal design of the recording stacks and the recording layer materials used.<br>
Another important requirement is to increase the storage capacity of optical recording media like DVD-Rewritable and DVR (Digital Yidto Recorder) on a single-sided disk. This can be achieved by reducing the laser-light wavelength X, and/or increasing tiie<br><br>
numerical aperture (NA) of a recording lens, because the laser-light spot size is proportional to (k/NAf'. Because of a smaller laser-light spot size, the marks, which are recorded, are smaller. Therefore the storage capacity of a disk increases because more marks fit per unit area of the disk. An alternative option is the application of multiple recording stacks. This is called dual- or double-stack recording, when two recording stacks on the same side of the optical disk are used, which are optically accessed from the same side with the same laser-light beam. When more than two recording stacks on the same side of the optical disk are used, it is called multi-stack recordmg.<br>
For double or dual stack recording, the second recording stack, through which tlie laser-light beam enters first, must be sufficiently transmissive to ensure projier read/write characteristics of the first recording stack. Said known medium of US patent l/s 6,190,750 has a I IP^IMaf^ | S | IPiIMil structure for rewritable phase-change recording which has two metal reflective layers Mi and M2, which respectively are relatively thick, with a high optical reflection, and relatively thin, with a relatively high optical transmission. I represents a dielectric layer, I represents a further dielectric layer. Pi and P2 represent phase-change recording layers, and S represents a transparent spacer layer. In tliis structure the laser-light beam enters first through the stack containing P2. The metal layers not only serve as a reflective layer, but also as a heat sink to ensure rapid cooling for quenching the amorphous phase during writing. The Pi layer is present proximate a relatively thick metal mirror layer Ml which causes substantial cooling of the Pj layer during recording while the P2 layer is present proximate a relatively thin metal layer M2 with limited heat sink properties. The cooling behavior of a recording layer determines to a large extent the correct formation of amorphous marks during recording. Sufficient heat sink action is required in order to ensure proper amorphous mark formation during recording.<br>
In the known medium, the metal layer M2 inevitably blocks a substantial pairt of the laser-light causing a reduced recording power at the Pi layer. A fiirther dielectric layer r is used, in combination with the layer M2, in order to increase the transmission of the M2 layer. The metal layer M2is required for sufficient heat sink action. The thermal conductivity of this further dielectric layer alone still appears to be too low, and therefore its ability to rapidly reduce the temperature in the recording layer is insufficient. Because of the partial blocking of the laser-light a substantially higher write power for llie Pi recording layer is required. This means that a relatively large amount of laser-light power is needed in order to successfully write or rewrite data in the optical data storage medium, especially at high data rates which require a larger medium speed relatively to the laser-light beam. At larger write<br><br>
and rewrite speeds, more laser-light power is needed. In most cases, semiconductor lasers are used for generating the laser-light beam. Especially at shorter laser light wavelengths, e.g. lower than 700 nm, tlie maximum laser power of those lasers is limited and poses a barrier for liigh recording powders. Furthermore, large laser-light powers preferably are avoided because further recording stacks adjacent the first recording stack may be undesirably heated by the laser-light beam, which is focused onto the recording layer of the first recording stack. When no metal layer M2 is used the coolmg behavior of the layer P2 is substantially different from the cooling behavior of the layer Pi. Because of this difference the way of writing at a given data rate in the layer P2 substantially differs from the layer Pi. By way of writing, e.g., a pulse or write strategy is meant. It may even be impossible to successfully write in a layer with a relatively slow cooling behavior at a high enough data rate. In other words; the amorphous mark formation is highly counteracted because of the slow cooling rate of the P layer allowing substantial recrystallization.<br>
It is an object of the invention-to provide a multi-stack optical data storage medium of the kind described in the opening paragraph, which has at least one further recording stack that is substantially transparent to a laser-light beam in order to allow relatively low power writing in a subjacent recording stack and tliat has a sufficient heat sink action in order to ensure proper amorphous mark formation in the recording layer of said further recording stack.<br>
This object is achieved in that at least one indium tin oxide (ITO) layer is present in at least one of the recording stacks.<br>
The invention is based on the insight that the transmission of an PIT stack almost solely is determined by the transmission of the P layer. T represents the ITO layer and I and P respectively represent a dielectric layer and a phase-change recording layer. A metal layer, which inevitably blocks a part of the laser-light, is absent. Due to the presence of the ITO layer sufficient heat sink action is present in the recording stack. ITO is a transparent material, which is normally used because of its relatively high electrical conductivity e.g. as a transparent electrode in liquid crystal displays (LCD's). Use of ITO as a material with high thermal conductivity in optical recording stacks is not known. As a result of the invention the laser-light power for writing in subjacent recording stacks is reduced considerably, e.g. by amounts up to about 50%.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the optical data storage medium accordix^ to the invention the ITO layer is present in at least one of the further recording stacks at a side closest to the first recording stack adjacent a transparent spacer layer. Schematically the following structure may represent the embodiment:<br>
1 IPnITn 1 Sn | IPn-iITn-i | Sn-i |	|IPiIl. The lascr-Ught enters first through the n* stack. The<br>
IPiI stack is the first recording stack, Sn is a transparent spacer layer, IPnITn is the n^^ recording stack, and wherein I, P and T have the above mentioned meaning. It should be mentioned that many notations of the order of multi-stack design are possible. Sometimes multi-stack designs are represented by Ln m which n denotes 0 or a positive integer number. The first stack through which the laser-light enters is called LQ, while each deeper stack is represented by Li,. Ln, Deeper is to be understood in terms of the direction of the incoming laser-light beam. In this document another notation is used in which the deepest stack has subscript number 1.<br>
In another embodiment a further ITO layer is present in the further recording stack containing an ITO layer, the further ITO layer being present at a side of the further recording stack opposite firom the side of the ITO layer. Schematically this may be represented by the following structure:<br>
I TnlPnlTn | Sn | Tn-1 IPn-lITn-l | Sn-1 |	[IPlIj.<br>
In such way, a symmetrical stack may be formed witli a heat sink layer on both sides of the recording layer. This has tiie advantage that the cooling behavior is more symmetrically distributed, which results in a more optimal writing and erasing of amorphous marks in the recording layer.<br>
In a favorable embodiment a fiirther ITO layer is present in the first recording stack at a side closest to the further recording stack and a metal reflective layer is present in the recording stack at a side most remote firom the further recording stack. Because the first recording stack is the last stack at which the laser-light arrives a non-transparent metal reflective layer may be present in order to enhance the total reflection of the optical data storage medium. Furthermore, tlie metal layer will act as an excellent heat sink for the first recording stack.<br>
In a refinement of the previous embodiment, the metal reflective layer is replg-ced by an ITO layer. When the P layer has sufficiant reflectivity of itself, the metal layer may be replaced by an ITO layer. The advantage is that the coolmg behavior of the first recording stack is substantially equal to the cooling behavior of a further recording stack in which ITO layers may be present in the same configuration. In this way, the write and erase<br><br>
properties of the first and further recording stacks are substantially eqxial. Furthermore, from an economic viewpoint, the deletion of a metal layer is advantageous. For the metal reflective layer of the first recording stack, metals such as Al, Ti, Au, Ni, Cu, Ag, Rh, Pt, Pd, Ni, Co, Mn and Cr, and alloys of these metals, can be used. Examples of suitable alloys are AlTi, AlCr and AlTa. Ag is preferred because of its high thermal conductivity. The thickness of this metal reflective layer is not critical, but preferably the transmission is zero for obtaining maximal reflection. For practical reasons the thickness is about 100 max.<br>
Preferably, the ITO layer has a thickness in the range of 5 to 200 mn. A too thin layer does not exhibit sufficient heat sink action while a too thick layer may deteriorate the optica] transmission of the recording stacks. Furthermore, a thick layer is more expensive to deposit.<br>
In advantageous embodiments the recording layer is in contact with at least one additional layer comprising a compound selected from the group consisting of AI2O3, SiC, Si3N4, MgO, ZnO and AIN including their non-stoichiometric compositions, said additional layer having a maximum thickness of 10 nm. These layers increase the crystalUzation speed of the amorphous marks during DOW, dkectly resulting in a higher possible data rate. The interface between these layers and the recording layer acts as a nucleation source for crystallization of the amorphous marks. The additional layer has a relatively small thickness. Therefore, the additional layer only has a relatively small influence on the transfer capability of heat in the recording layers to the ITO layers. In other words, the ITO heat sink action is hardly changed by the additional layer.<br>
The recording layers preferably comprise the elements Ge and Te. The recording layers are of the phase-change type. A phase-change material shows a crystalline-amorphous phase transition. Further useful are compounds of In-Sb-Te, Te-Se-Sb, Ag-In-Sb-Te, Ge-Sb-Te, Ge-In-Sb-Te or Ge-Te. Especially useful are the compounds described in the mtemational patent applications WO 01/13370 and WO 97/50084, both filed by Applicants. The compounds in WO 97/50084 have a composition defined in atomic percentages by the formula:<br>

 <br>
The compounds in WO 01/13370 have a composition defined in atomic percentages by the formula:<br>

0<b d and a-f b c>
Preferably, the recording layer of a further recording stack has a thickness between 5 and 25 nm. A thicker layer would result in a too low transmission. The recordmg layer of the first recording stack may be thicker, e.g. between 5 and 50 nm.<br>
In all recording stacks, a dielectric layer at a side of the phase-change recording layer remote from the substrate protects the recording layer from the influence of the generally organic spacer layer and optimizes tlie optical contrast. In view of this optical contrast, the thickness of this layer is preferably limited to (70 + X/ln) nm, wherein X is the wavelength of the laser-light beam, and n is the refractive index of the dielectric layer<br>
In the first recording stack, the dielectric layer between the recording layer and the preferred metal reflective layer is between 10 and 50 nm, preferably between 20 and 40 nm. When this layer is too thin, the thermal insulation between the recording layer and the metal reflective layer is adversely afifected. Therefore, the cooling rate of the recording layer is increased, which leads to a poor crystallization process and possibly a poor cyclability. The cooling rate wall be decreased by increasing the thickness of the dielectric layer. A relatively thick dielectric layer is preferred in order to increase the sensitivity of the recording layer of the first recording stack.<br>
The dielectric layers I are preferably tnade of a mixture of ZnS and Si02, e.g. (ZnS)so(Si02)2o. The layers may also be made of Si02, Ta205, Ti02, ZnS, including their non-stoichiometric compositions.<br>
The transparent spacer layers between the first and fiirther recording stacks have a thickness larger than the depth of focus of the laser-light beam, e.g.lO nm. This thickness ensiires that the fixst and second recording stacks are optically decoupled, i.e. a laser-light beam focused on the recording layer of the first recording stack does not read/write information from/onto fiirther recording stacks, and vice versa. In this way, the<br><br>
storage capacity is increased with respect to a single-layered data storage medium. The material of the spacer layer is e.g. a UV-cured acrylate adhesive, in which servotracks may be provided by a replication process.<br>
The substrate of the data storage medium is at least transparent for the laser wavelength, and is made, for example, of polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), amorphous polyolefin or glass. Transparency of the substrate is only required when the laser-light beam enters the recording stacks via the entrance face of the substrate. In a typical example, the substrate is disk-shaped and has a diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 0.6 or 1.2 mm. The substrate may be opaque when the laser-light beam enters the stack via the side opposite from the side of the substrate.<br>
The surface of the disk-shaped substrate on the side of the recording stacks is, preferably, provided with a servotrack, which can be scanned optically. This servotrack is often constituted by a spiral-shaped groove and is formed in the substrate by means of a mould during injection molding or pressing. These grooves can be alternatively formed in a replication process in the synthetic resin of the spacer layer, for example, a UV light-curable acrylate<br>
Optionally, the outermost layer of the stack is screened from the environment by means of a protective layer of, for example, UV light-cured poIy(meth)acrylate. The protective layer must be of good optical quality, i.e. substantially free from optical aberrations and substantially imiform in thickness, when the laser-light enters the recording stacks via the protective layer. In this case, the protective layer is transparent to the laser-light.<br>
Recording and erasing data in the recording layers of the recording stacks may be achieved by using a short-wavelength laser, e.g. with a wavelength of 660 nm or shorter (red to blue).<br>
Both the metal reflective layer, and the dielectric layers can be provided by evaporation or sputtering.<br>
The ITO layers can be provided by sputtering or by wet chemical means.<br>
The phase-change recording layer can be applied to the substrate by vacuum deposition. Known vacuum deposition processes are evaporation (E-beam evaporation, resistant heat evaporation from a crucible), sputtering, low pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Ion Plating, Ion Beam Assisted Evaporation, Plasma enhanced CVD. Normal thermal CVD processes are not applicable because of too high reaction temperature.<br><br>
The invention will be elucidated in greater detail by means of exemplary embodiments and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>

The optical contrast is 93.5%. The optical contrast is defined above. For the second recording stack 3 the values are Ra=' 4.8%, Rc=16.9% and an optical contrast of 72.0%. The transmission of the second recording stack 3 at a wavelength of 670 nm is 51.0% (Ta) when the recording layer 12 is in the amorphous phase and 37.5% (Tc) when the recording layer 12 is hi the crystalline phase.<br>
In Fig. 3, another embodiment of the multi-stack optical data storage medixmi 20 for rewritable recording by means of a focused laser-light beam 30 is shown. Both recording layers 6 and 12 are m contact with four additional layers 5', 7', IT and 13' made of SiC. The additional SiC layers 5', 7', 11' and 13' all have athickness of 5 nm. Further layers in Fig. 3 are identical to the corresponding layers in the embodiment in Fig, 2, with the exception that tlie thickness of each of the dielectric layers 5, 7, 11 and 13 is reduced by 5 nm. This results in a multi-stack optical data storage medium 20 with the same optical reflectivity and transmission as described with Fig. 2. The presence of the SiC layers 5', 7\ W and 13' in contact with the recording layers 6 and 12 increases the crystallization speed of the recording layers 6 and 12.<br>
In Fig. 4 the result of an amorphous mark 41 formation simulation is shown for an IPIM stack with the respective thicknesses of 130-10-15-120 nm. The I layers are made of conventional (ZnS)8o(Si02)2o. The P layer is a doped eutectic SbTe composition with a high crystal growth velocity, a so-called fast growth material (FGM). M is a metal layer of Ag. In the simulation the amorphous mark 41 is written using a write strategy with laser-light pulse train of 6 write pulses with a power of 6 mW at a linear velocity of the medium of 8.1 mJs. A background erase power level of 2.5 mW for DOW is maintained before and after the pulse train. The laser-Ught wavelength is 405 nm, focused with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.85, which are the DVR-blue conditions. The solid black line 42 indicates the maximum melt-edge while the filled area 41 denotes the final amorphous mark after cooling down. The resulting amorphous mark 41 is nearly as broad as the maximum melt-edge 42. The suppressed heat accumulation due to the presence of the good heat sinlc M minimizes re-crystallization at the leading edge 46 of the mark. The erase power, applied after the pulse train with write pulses, causes a noticeable re-crystallization diwing mark formation at the trailing edge 45 of the mark. This however can be compensated for with an appropriate write strategy.<br><br>
In Fig. 5 tlie result of an amorphous mark 43 formation simulation is shown for an IPI stack with the respective thicknesses of 120-8-80 nm. The write power is 5 mW and the erase power is 1.5 mW. Further, the conditions are the same as described in the description of Fig. 4. Is should be noted that severe re-crystallization during amorphous mark 43 formation is observed due to the absence of a proper heat sink for rapid cool down of the recording layer. It is obvious that the distorted shape of the amorphous mark 43 of Fig. 5 leads to severe distortion of the signal during read-out of the amorphous mark 43,<br>
In Fig. 6 the result of an amorphous mark 44 formation simulation is shown for a TIPIT stack with the respective thicknesses of 115-5-8-5-75 nm. Further, the conditions are the same as described in the description of Fig. 4 with the exception that the laser-light write power is 11 m\V and that the erase power level is 5.2 mW. T is transparent heat sink with a thermal conductivity of 10 W/mK. An important consequence of the heat sinks T is the significant reduction in sensitivity of the stack with respect to write power. Is should be noted that severe re-crystallization during amorphous mark 44 formation is counteracted due to the presence of a the heat sinks T. The shape of the amorphous mark 44 is nearly as big as in the amorphous mark 41 of Fig. 4. The small deviation in size can be compensated for by using an appropriate write strategy during recording. It further should be noted that the thermal conductivity of thin layers may substantially differ from the bulk thermal conductivity of the material of which the thin layer is made. This is due to the structure, which is influenced by the deposition conditions, of the thin layer.<br>
It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiments and simulations illustrate rather than limh the invention, and that those skilled in the art v^ll be able to design many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the appended claims. In the claims, any reference signs placed between parentheses shall not be construed as limiting the claim. The word "comprising" does not exclude the presence of elements or steps other than those hsted in a claim. The word "a" or "an" preceding an element does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage.<br>
