				<td>The invention relates to a precipitation device for producing spinning filaments from an extruded spinning solution containing water, cellulose and tertiary amine oxide, wherein the precipitation device is, at least section-wise, filled with a spinning bath liquid through which the spinning filaments are passed when the precipitation device is operated, and wherein the precipitation device comprises a deflection member deflecting the spinning filaments from an entry direction, in which the spinning filaments enter the precipitation device, into an exit direction, which is different from the entry direction and in which the spinning filaments exit the precipitation device.<br>
A device of this kind is known from EP 0 832 995 A2. In connection with this device, an assemblage of filaments exiting the spinning nozzle is deflected by the deflection member in a spinning bath liquid. The filaments extruded from the spinning solution when passing through the spinning nozzles coagulate in the spinning bath liquid.<br>
The deflection member according to EP 0 832 995 A2 is roller-shaped, with the roller having inwardly inclined flanks.<br>
A drawback in connection with the precipitation device according to EP 0 832 995 A2 is that it requires a large quantity of spinning bath liquid.<br>
On the basis of EP 0 832 995 A2 it is the object of the present invention to improve a precipitation device of the aforementioned kind such that a smaller quantity of spinning bath liquid is required for the production of the spinning filaments.<br>
On the basis of a precipitation device of the above-mentioned kind said object is achieved by constructing the deflection member in the form of a deflection funnel with an entry surface extending essentially transversely to the entry direction and an exit surface extending essentially transversely to the exit direction, whereby, during operation, the spinning filaments are passed through the deflection funnel.<br><br>
From a constructive point of view said solution is quite simple. By constructing the deflection member as a deflection funnel, through which the spinning filaments are passed, less spinning bath liquid has to be provided as the required quantity is limited by the cross-section of the flow and the volume of the deflection funnel.<br>
The deflection funnel according to the invention differs from linear spinning funnels from the prior art, e.g. as disclosed in EP 0 574 870 A1, by its double function as spinning funnel and deflection member. Said spinning funnels exclusively extend in the entry direction. If at all, such spinning funnels were used only in connection with a separate deflection device outside the spinning bath. Said separation of spinning funnel and deflection member was previously necessary due to the attempt to avoid an afterstretching on the deflection member (compare page 5, line 9 ff of EP 0 574 870 A1).<br>
The solution according to the present invention differs from the deflection member disclosed in EP 0 832 995 A2 in that the deflection no longer freely takes place in the spinning bath, but inside the deflection funnel. Consequently, in accordance with the solution underlying the present invention, the quantity of spinning bath liquid has to be supplied only to the extent that must be transported together with the spinning filaments through the deflection funnel.<br>
The deflection from the entry direction into the exit direction in the deflection funnel should take place as gently as possible so as to achieve a high spinning safety and to avoid filament breakages in the deflection funnel. On the basis of an advantageous improvement of the invention this aim can be achieved in that the deflection funnel has a deflection area being essentially continuously curved from the entry direction to the exit direction. According to an advantageous embodiment the deflection area can particularly have an essentially constant curvature. The deflection funnel having a constant curvature is easier to manufacture than alternative deflection funnels where, for instance, the radius of the curvature becomes continuously smaller from the entry direction to the exit direction.<br><br>
*ln order to avoid too large a mechanical load of the spinning filaments in the deflection area it may be provided according to another advantageous embodiment, that the deflection area has an essentially constant cross-section. On the basis of this embodiment the spinning filaments are not accelerated in the deflection area, so that the mechanical load in this area remains limited to the deflection. Furthermore, a more quiet flow can be obtained in the deflection area.<br>
The spinning filament bundles deflected by the deflection funnel may be combined to form a cross-section of any shape. The cross-sectional shape depends on the arrangement of the spinning nozzles, through which the individual spinning filaments are extruded. Given rectangular spinnerets the spinning nozzles are, for instance, arranged on a rectangle, whereas they are arranged on a ring surface when ring nozzles are used. The ring funnel according to the invention may be applied independently of the arrangement of the spinning nozzles by correspondingly adjusting the cross-section thereof.<br>
Thus, it is, for example, an advantage when rectangular spinnerets are used, if the deflection area, in accordance with an improved embodiment of the invention, has an essentially rectangular cross-section. If circular spinnerets are used, the cross-section of the deflection funnel may be round, if ring nozzles are used, it may be annular.<br>
For reducing the geodetic difference in level, i.e. the difference in level in the gravity direction, between the entry surface and the exit surface of the deflection funnel, the deflection area may, according to an advantageous embodiment, be curved by at least 90°, so that the exit direction has a component pointing in opposite direction of the entry direction. Likewise, the exit surface may lie approximately on the same geodetic level as the entry surface.<br>
If the difference in level between the entry surface and the exit surface is as small as possible, an only small static pressure difference prevails between said two surfaces. This entails, on one hand, that the spinning filaments can be transported through the deflection funnel in a more gentle manner and, on the other hand, that a smaller quantity of spinning bath liquid flows through the deflection funnel.<br><br>
* It is moreover an advantage, if the deflection area is in a section where the spinning filaments, after their extrusion, already have gained a sufficient mechanical stability, in other words, if a certain portion of the spinning solution has already been coagulated. This is obtained in that a feeding area of the deflection funnel is directly adjacent the entry surface. Said feeding area may particularly be funnel-shaped, i.e. it tapers in the direction in which the spinning filaments are passed through.<br>
At least the cross-section of the feeding area may section-wise be adopted to the arrangement of the spinning nozzles, i.e. it may be rectangular or round in response to the arrangement of the spinning nozzles. If the deflection area has a cross-section different from that of the feeding area, for example, a rounded, particularly circular or elliptical one, so as to achieve more favorable flow conditions in the deflection area, a continuously changing cross-section may be provided in the change-over section between the feeding area and the deflection area. On the basis of this construction, the feeding area, by exchanging the same and with an otherwise unchanged deflection funnel, is adjusted to the different nozzles.<br>
The deflection funnel can, moreover, have an outlet area ending in the exit surface. Said outlet area, which may be adjacent the deflection area, namely in the direction in which the spinning filaments are passed through the deflection funnel, may have an essentially constant cross-section. According to an improvement the outlet area may also extend along the exit direction in a linear manner.<br>
Conventional spinning funnels, e.g. according to EP 0 574 870 A1, or the deflection member according to EP 0 832 995 A2, entail problems with regard to the piecing or joining, i.e. the initiation of the spinning and precipitation process after a standstill of the plant. On the basis of the device according to EP 0 832 995 A2 the service staff has to grip the spinning filaments by hand for laying them around the deflection member. According to the spinning funnel disclosed in EP 0 574 870 A1 too small a quantity of spinning bath liquid flows through the spinning funnel, so that the spinning filaments are not flushed through the spinning funnel by themselves when the spinning is started.<br>
C<br><br>
According to the deflection funnel underlying the present invention the piecing is facilitated by providing a device for changing the cross-section on the exit surface, by means of which the exit cross-section can be changed. Said device for changing the cross-section may, for instance, be a screen, a pivotable flap or a displaceable slide.<br>
By means of the device for changing the cross-section, for example, the exit surface can be adjusted as large as possible for the piecing, so that a large quantity of spinning bath can flow through the deflection funnel at high speed and can entrain the broken or pieced filaments. In the normal operating state the exit surface can then be reduced, so that just the amount of spinning bath liquid required for the precipitation process with a high extent of spinning safety exits the exit surface. At its inner side, especially in the area of the deflection area where the spinning filaments touch the deflection funnel, the deflection funnel may be coated. The coating can be an abrasion-resistant coating having a low friction coefficient over the spinning filaments. The coating may also be composed such that the formation of a lubricating film between the spinning filaments and the wall of the deflection funnel facing the spinning filaments is enhanced. Thus, the mechanical load of the spinning filaments can be reduced during the deflection.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment the precipitation device may comprise a container, which, at least section-wise, encloses the deflection funnel and in which spinning bath liquid is at least section-wise received during operation. The container may particularly be provided with a supply container or may be constructed as a supply container, in which the entry surface of the deflection funnel is arranged and through which the spinning bath solution is introduced into the deflection funnel. This can easily take place by arranging the entry surface inside the spinning bath in the container.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment the container can comprise a collecting bin, preferably with an outlet, underneath the exit surface of the deflection funnel. By means of the collecting bin the spinning bath liquid exiting the exit surface can be collected and let off for the further processing or recycling thereof.<br><br>
The invention moreover relates to a spinning plant for the production of spinning filaments from a spinning solution containing water, cellulose and tertiary amine oxide, comprising a spinning head with spinning nozzles, through which the spinning solution is extruded to form spinning filaments during the operation, and comprising a precipitation device for precipitating the spinning solution.<br>
In order to reduce the consumption of spinning bath liquid in such a spinning plant, the spinning plant according to the invention comprises a precipitation device according to one of the above-described embodiments.<br>
The spinning plant can especially also serve to produce spinning filament bundles having an essentially rectangular cross-section. This is achieved by arranging the nozzles on an essentially rectangular surface.<br>
In comparison to the conventional spinning methods the quantity of the spinning bath solution can eventually be reduced, if the following process steps are performed: The spinning solution is at first extruded to form spinning filaments and is then introduced into a deflection funnel, where the spinning filaments are deflected.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a precipitation device for producing spinning filaments from an extruded spinning solution containing water, cellulose and tertiary amine oxide, wherein the precipitation device is, at least section-wise, filled with a spinning bath liquid through which the spinning filaments are passed when the precipitation device is operated, and wherein the precipitation device comprises a deflection member deflecting, during operation, the spinning filaments from an entry direction, in which the spinning filaments enter the precipitation device, into an exit<br>
7<br><br>
direction, which is different from the entry direction and in which the spinning filaments exit the precipitation device, characterized in that the deflection member is in the form of a deflection funnel with an entry surface extending essentially transversely to the entry direction and an exit surface extending essentially transversely to the exit direction, whereby, during operation, the spinning filaments are passed through the deflection funnel.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also provides a spinning plant for producing spinning filaments from a spinning solution containing water, cellulose and tertiary amine oxide, comprising a spinning head with spinning nozzles through which the spinning solution is extruded to form spinning filaments during operation, and comprising a precipitation device for precipitating the spinning solution, characterized in that the precipitation device is constructed as described above.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method for producing spinning filaments from a spinning solution containing water, cellulose and tertiary amine oxide, comprising the following process steps: extruding the spinning solution to form spinning filaments; introducing and bundling the spinning filaments in a deflection funnel; deflecting the spinning filaments in the deflection funnel.<br>
In the following the solution according to the present invention will be explained in more<br>
detail by means of two embodiments with reference to the attached drawings, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 shows a first embodiment of a deflection funnel according to the invention comprising<br>
a spinning head,<br>
Fig. 2 shows an alternative construction of an exit area of the deflection funnel according to<br>
fig. 1 in detail,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of a deflection funnel according to the invention<br>
comprising a spinning head.<br><br>
* Fig. 1 shows a cross-section of a spinning plant 1 for the production of spinning filaments from a spinning solution containing water, cellulose, tertiary amine oxide. The spinning plant 1 comprises a spinning head 2 and a precipitation device 3. Through the spinning head 2 spinning solution is fed to a nozzle plate 5 via channels 4. Said nozzle plate 5 is provided with a plurality of nozzles, through which the spinning solution is extruded to form spinning filaments 6, whereby an individual spinning filament is produced by each nozzle (not shown in fig. 1). In the device according to fig. 1 the spinning nozzles in the nozzle plate 5 are arranged on an essentially rectangular surface, so that the bundle 6 formed of spinning filaments has an essentially rectangular cross-section, i.e. it has the form of a rectangular filament package. If the spinning nozzles are arranged differently in the nozzle plate 5, the structure of the spinning plant remains essentially the same.<br>
The spinning filaments 6 are extruded into an air gap 7 and are dipped into a spinning bath liquid 8 received by the precipitation device 3 after having passed through the air gap 7.<br>
In the precipitation device 3 the spinning filaments 6 are passed through a deflection funnel 9 filled with spinning bath solution 8, whereby the deflection funnel 9 serves as spinning funnel and as deflection member at the same time and is filled with spinning bath liquid. The spinning filaments enter the precipitation device in an entry direction 10, are deflected and exit the precipitation device 3 in an exit direction 11.<br>
The deflection funnel 9 serves at the same time as deflection member, so that the entry direction 10 differs from the exit direction 11, and at the same time as spinning funnel, through which the spinning filaments 6 are bundled out of the individual nozzles in the nozzle plate 5 to form a spinning filament bundle 12 which exits the precipitation device 3.<br>
The deflection funnel comprises an entry surface 14 extending essentially transversely to the entry direction 10, as well as an exit surface 15 extending essentially transversely to the exit direction 11. The individual spinning filaments 6 enter the deflection funnel 9 through the entry surface 14, the spinning filament bundle 12 exits the deflection funnel 9 through the exit surface 15, and, according to<br><br>
the embodiment shown in fig. 1, also exits the precipitation device 3. The cross-section of the entry surface essentially corresponds to the surface covered by the spinning nozzles in the nozzle plate 5.<br>
From the entry surface 14 a feeding area 16 tapering in the entry direction 10 extends in the entry direction 10. In the embodiment according to fig. 1 the funnel-shaped feeding area 16 is tapered asymmetrically. The feeding funnel 16 serves the bundling of the spinning filaments 6 to form a spinning filament bundle 12. In the direction in which the spinning filaments 6, 12 are passed through, a deflection area 17 is adjacent the feeding area 16, in which the spinning filaments 6, 12 are deflected from the entry direction 10 into the exit direction 11.<br>
In the deflection area 17 the deflection funnel 9 is steadily curved and, according to the embodiment shown in fig. 1, has a constant curvature. Also a curvature changing in the direction in which the spinning filaments 6, 12 are passed through may be provided instead of the constant curvature. The cross-section of the deflection funnel 9 is essentially constant in the deflection area 17. In the deflection area 17 the deflection funnel 9 is, moreover, coated on the side facing the spinning filaments 6, 12, especially on the side 18 situated towards the center of the curvature. This is where the spinning filaments 6 are adjacent when the deflection takes place. The coating is an abrasion-resistant, friction-reducing coating, which preferably enhances the formation of a lubricating film of spinning bath solution between the spinning filaments 6,12 and the inner wall 18 at the same time.<br>
In the deflection area 17 the spinning filaments 6, 12 are deflected by at least 90°, according to fig. 1 by approximately 135°, namely such that the exit direction 11 has a component pointing opposite the entry direction 10.<br>
The deflection funnel 9 moreover comprises an outlet area 19 which ends in the exit opening 15. The outlet area 19 extends essentially linear essentially along the exit direction 11. In fig. 1 the outlet area 19 is directly adjacent the deflection area 17, namely in the direction in which the spinning filaments 6, 12 are passed through the deflection funnel 9. The cross-section of the outlet area 19 is essentially constant.<br><br>
A device for changing the cross-section 20 is provided on the exit surface 15, by means of which the cross-section of the exit surface 15 can be increased or reduced. In accordance with the embodiment shown in fig. 1 the device for changing the cross-section 20 is designed as a slide 20 displaceable essentially transversely to the exit direction 11.<br>
The geodetic levels of the entry surface 14 and the exit surface 15 of the deflection funnel 9 are essentially identical, or, respectively, the difference in level between said surfaces is as small as possible.<br>
After having exited the precipitation device 3 the spinning filament bundle 12 is transported via a drawing-off device 21 to subsequent non-illustrated process steps. The drawing-off device 21 exerts a tensile stress on the spinning filaments 6, so that the latter are distorted or respectively drafted when passing through the air gap 7 and when passing through the deflection funnel 9. A portion of said tensile stress is absorbed on the inner wall 18 by the friction between the spinning filaments and the deflection funnel 9. By designing and/or coating the inner wall 18 and by choosing suited curvatures of the deflection area 17 the drafting of the spinning filaments in the air gap 7 can be adjusted correspondingly.<br>
The precipitation device 3 moreover comprises a container 22 having a supply container 23 filled with spinning bath liquid. Through said supply container 23, spinning bath solution is introduced through the entry surface 14 into the deflection funnel 9 as is schematically shown by arrows 24, which illustrate the flow of the spinning bath liquid. The supply container 23 is essentially trough-shaped. Alternatively, the spinning bath liquid may also directly be fed into the deflection funnel 9 without a supply container.<br>
The container 22 furthermore comprises a feed container 25 via which the spinning bath liquid is fed to the supply container 23. The level of the spinning bath liquid 8 in the supply container 23 is adjusted by a wall of the supply container designed as an overflow 26. The overflow 26 is arranged on the side of the exit opening 15. The outlet area 19 of the deflection funnel extends through the container wall of the supply container 23 formed as overflow, so that the container wall simultaneously<br><br>
"" "serves as a holding device for the deflection funnel 9. Underneath the exit opening 15 the container 22 forms a collecting bin 27 for collecting the spinning bath liquid 28 exiting the exit surface 15 with the spinning filament bundle 12. According to the embodiment shown in fig. 1 the collecting bin 27 moreover collects the spinning bath liquid 29 from the supply container 23 exiting via the overflow 26. The collecting bin 27 is provided with an outlet not shown in fig. 1, via which the spinning bath liquid may be supplied in a recycled manner to the supply container 23, namely via the feed container 25 and thus the deflection funnel 9.<br>
As is shown by arrows 30, the deflection funnel 9 is completely flown through by the spinning bath liquid.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 1 the feeding area 16, the deflection area 17 and the outlet area 19 all have a rectangular cross-section. The cross-section may, however, also be adopted to any optional other arrangement of the nozzles in the nozzle plate 5 of the spinning head 2. If, for example, the nozzles in the nozzle plate 5 are arranged on a circular surface, the cross-sections of the feeding area 16, the deflection area 17 and the outlet area 19 may be circular.<br>
Moreover, change-overs in the cross-sectional shapes between the individual areas 16, 17, 19 of the deflection funnel 9 are feasible. It is, for example, possible that merely the feeding area 16 has a rectangular cross-section, which, in the entry direction 10, gradually changes into a circular cross-section in the area of the deflection area 17. This allows the improvement of the flow in the deflection area without depending on the cross-section of the entry surface, so that the formation of vortices and turbulences in the deflection area 17 are limited.<br>
In order to allow an easier cleansing of the deflection funnel 9, individual parts such as the feeding area 16, the deflection area 17 and the upper area of the outlet area 19 may be removed. For this purpose, the deflection funnel 9 is composed of several parts.<br>
r A<br><br>
"Fig. 2 shows a modification of the device for changing the cross-section 20, According to the embodiment shown in fig. 2 the device for changing the cross-section 20 is designed as a flap rotatably mounted by means of a hinge 32 on the upper wall 31 of the outlet area 19 located opposite the gravity direction. A construction as a flap 20 is particularly possible with a rectangular or polygonal cross-section. According to this embodiment, also an automatic change in the size and shape of the exit surface may be obtained in an easy manner by means of a force acting on the flap 20, or by a corresponding flap weight. The device for changing the cross-section 20 may also be remotely controlled or automatically actuated by a non-illustrated actuating means.<br>
The remainder of the structure of the precipitation device 3 or, respectively, of the spinning plant 1 according to fig. 2 corresponds to the one according to fig. 1. Therefore, the same reference numbers are being used in fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a second embodiment of a precipitation device 3. The precipitation device 3 according to fig. 3 differs from the embodiment according to figure 1 by a differently designed container 23. In fig. 3, the features, whereof the structure or function correspond to the structure or function of the corresponding features according to fig. 1, are designated by the same reference numbers.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in fig. 3, essentially less spinning bath liquid can, in comparison with the embodiment according to fig. 1, be used when the spinning plant 1 is operated, as the supply container 23 is essentially smaller and essentially only receives the entry opening 14 of the deflection funnel 9 as well as a section of the feeding area 16. The feeding area 16 extends through the bottom of the supply container 23. In container 22, which encloses the supply container 23, also a feed container 25 is provided, which is separated from the supply container 23 by a weir 33.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 3 the container 22 forms a safety container 34 not containing any spinning bath liquid.<br><br>
* The inlet area of the deflection funnel 9 is, according to the embodiment shown in fig. 3, designed as a symmetrically tapering funnel 16 extending in the direction of the bottom of the safety container 34. In the area of the deflection area 17 the deflection funnel 9 penetrates the bottom of the safety container 34 from the inside to the outside. The outlet area 19 penetrates, due to the deflection in the deflection area 17 by more than 90°, both the bottom 34 and the lateral wall 24 of the safety container 34. Thus, the safety container 34 together with the bottom of the supply container 23 also serves the stable fixing of the deflection funnel 9.<br>
Moreover, according to the embodiment shown in fig. 3, the nozzles in the nozzle plate 5 are arranged on a circular surface and produce a spinning filament bundle 6 having a circular cross-section. In correspondence therewith, the cross-section of the deflection funnel 9 is circular.<br>
The rest of the structure of the spinning plant 1 corresponds to the structure of the embodiment shown in fig. 1.<br>
In the following, the function of the invention will be explained by means of an embodiment according to fig. 1. Said function does not differ or does not essentially differ from the function according to the embodiment shown in fig. 3.<br>
The filaments 6 extruded through the nozzle plate 5 are introduced into the spinning bath liquid 8, e.g. water, after they have traversed the air gap 7, and are bundled in the feeding area 16 to form a filament bundle 12. In the deflection area 17 the spinning filaments are deflected by at least 90°, preferably between 90° and 135°, and exit the precipitation device 3 after they have passed through the outlet area 19. The deflection funnel 9 is entirely flown through by spinning bath liquid, whereby, due to the small geodetic difference in level between the entry surface 14 and the exit surface 15, only a small static pressure difference prevails, so that the spinning bath liquid exits the exit surface 15 at an essentially reduced speed in contrast to conventional linear spinning funnel"<br><br>
Thus, according to the invention, only smaller quantities of spinning bath liquid have to be circulated compared to conventional funnels. Moreover, the construction height is smaller than the one of conventional spinning funnels.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, the piecing is considerably facilitated. After a standstill of the spinning plant 1 or after a thread breaking, the thread has to be pieced anew, whereby the front end of a spinning filament has to be safely passed through the deflection funnel 9 and has to be gripped by the draw-off device 21.<br>
According to the present invention this is achieved by arranging the entry surface 14 underneath the nozzle plate 5, so that, during the piecing, the filaments 6 automatically fall into the feeding area 16. By actuating the surface adjustment means 20 the exit surface 15 is increased such that a possibly large flow of spinning bath liquid flows through the deflection funnel and entrains the filaments immersing in the feeding area 16 and flushes them through the exit surface 15, from where they may be picked up automatically or by hand and can be fed to the withdrawing device 21. Thus, the continuous spinning process is started anew in an easy manner.<br>
For the continuous spinning, the surface adjustment means 20 is then so adjusted that the exit surface 15 has a size optimal for the spinning process, so that not too much spinning bath liquid flows through the spinning funnel 9, whereas, however, a good circulation of the spinning bath liquid contained in the deflection funnel 9 can take place at the same time, so that the same does not age.<br><br><br>
