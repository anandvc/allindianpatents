COMBINATION OF A STRAIN OF BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS SUBSPECIES<br>
ISRAELENSIS AND A STRAIN OF BACILLUS SPHAERICUS, A COMPOSITION THEREOF<br>
AND A METHOD OF USE OF THE COMPOSITION"<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention is directed to a method for controlling Dipteran larvae<br>
or a method for inhibiting laryicidal_resisiance n Diptera by introducing a<br>
larvicidally-effective amount of a combination of a strain of Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis subspecies israeiensis and a strain of Bacillus sphaericus<br>
into an environment containing Dipteran larvae; and a composition of the<br>
combination. Preferably, both strains are non-genetically modified.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Mosquitoes and black flies are representative of the order Diptera<br>
which are pests that have plagued humans and animals for generations.<br>
Mosquitoes are the major vectors for a number of human and animal<br>
diseases, including malaria, yellow fever, viral encephalitis, dengue fever<br>
and filariasis.<br>
Various chemical pesticides have been developed with the goal of<br>
controlling Diptera. For example, treatment of a water source with a<br>
water-soluble alcohol in water-miscible form for mosquito abatement is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,077,521. However, more recent<br>
emphasis has been placed on the use of biopesticides. For example,<br>
controlled-release formulations of at leasf one biological pesticidal<br>
ingredient are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,865,842; control of<br>
mosquito larvae with a spore-forming Bacillus ONR-60A is disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,166,112; novel Bacillus thuringiensis isolates with<br>
activity against dipteran insect pests are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,275,315 and 5,847,079; a biologically pure culture of a Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis strain with activity against insect pests of the order Diptera<br>
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,912,162 and a recombinantly derived<br>
biopesticide active against Diptera including cyanobacteria transformed<br>
with a plasmid containing a B. thuringiensis subsp. israeiensis<br>
dipteracidal protein translationally fused to a strong, highly active native<br>
cyanobacteria's regulatory gene sequence is disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,518,897.<br>
Yet even these biopesticides have drawbacks; so the search for new<br>
biopesticides continues. One drawback of certain biopesticides is the<br>
potential build-up of pesticidal resistance.<br>
Resistance is defined by differences in susceptibility that arise<br>
among populations of the same species exposed to a pesticide<br>
continuously over a period of time. These differences are identified by<br>
observing a statistical shift in the lethal dose (LD) either to kill 50% or<br>
95% of the population (LD50 or LD95 respectively). Individual differences<br>
in susceptibility exist within each species, and pests that are<br>
substantially less susceptible may be present, generally at low<br>
frequencies, in at least some of the wild populations. In the presence of<br>
the pesticide, it is these substantially less susceptible pests that survive<br>
and reproduce. Since their ability to survive is a result of their genetic<br>
makeup, their resistant genetic makeup is then passed on to their<br>
offspring, resulting in shifts in the populations' susceptibility via pesticide-<br>
induced selection. Resistance to larvicides has been encountered<br>
among certain Dipteran species.<br>
Specifically, the development of resistance in Culex<br>
quinquefasciatus to Bacillus sphaericus (B.s.) is noted by Rodcharoen et<br>
a/., Journal of Economic Entomology, Vol. 87, No. 5, 1994, pp. 1133-<br>
1140. A method for overcoming this resistance, by combining B.s. with<br>
purified Cyt1A crystals isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp.<br>
israelensis or by combining a recombinant B.t.i. with B.s., is disclosed by<br>
Wirth et a/., Journal of Medical Entomology. Vol. 37, No. 3, 2000, pp.<br>
401-407. However, improved but naturally derived or occurring<br>
biological larvicides and compositions to overcome Culex mosquito<br>
resistance to B.s. applications would be desirable.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is directed to a composition comprising: a combination<br>
of a strain of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis and a strain of<br>
Bacillus sphaericus. The strain of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies<br>
israelensis may be non-genetically modified, or the strain of Bacillus<br>
sphaericus may be non-genetically modified, although a presently<br>
preferred combination includes a non-genetically modified strain of<br>
Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis and a non-genetically<br>
modified strain of Bacillus sphaericus.<br>
The combination may have from about 1:10 to about 10:1 weight ratio<br>
of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis to Bacillus sphaericus;<br>
preferably from about 1:3 to about 3:1 weight ratio of Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis subspecies israelensis to Bacillus sphaericus; more<br>
preferably from about 1:2 to about2:1_weight ratio of Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis subspecies israelensis to Bacillus sphaericus; and most<br>
preferably a 1:1 ratio of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis to<br>
Bacillus sphaericus.<br>
Additional components such as surface active agents, inert carriers,<br>
preservatives, humectants, feeding stimulants, attractants, encapsulating<br>
agents, binders, emulsifiers, dyes, U.V. protectants, buffers, drift control<br>
agents, spray deposition aids, free-flow agents or combinations thereof<br>
may also be utilized in conjunction with the combination in a larvicidal<br>
composition.<br>
The invention is also directed to a method of controlling Dipteran<br>
larvae comprising the step of introducing a larviddally-effective amount of<br>
a combination of a strain of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis<br>
and a strain of Bacillus sphaericus into an environment containing<br>
Dipteran larvae. In this method, Dipteran may be a mosquito such as<br>
Culex pipiens, Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, Culex tarsalis,<br>
Culiseta incidens, Anopheles freeborni or a combination thereof.<br>
The invention is additionally directed to a method for inhibiting<br>
larvicidal resistance in Diptera comprising the step of introducing a<br>
larvicidally-effective amount of a combination of a strain of Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis subspecies israelensis and a strain of Bacillus sphaericus<br>
into an environment containing Dipteran larvae. Preferably, the Diptera is<br>
Culex and larvicidal resistance is developed against Bacillus sphaericus.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention is directed to a method for controlling Dipteran larvae<br>
or a method for inhibiting larvicidal resistance in Diptera by introducing a<br>
larvicidally-effective amount of a combination of a strain of Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis subspecies israelensis and a strain of Bacillus sphaericus<br>
into an environment containing Dipteran larvae; and a composition of the<br>
combination. Preferably both strains are non-genetically modified. A<br>
detailed discussion of the composition, and the methods utilizing the<br>
composition follows.<br>
The Larvicidal Compositions<br>
Biopesticides are a class of naturally occurring pesticides frequently<br>
derived from unicellular or multicellular organisms which have developed<br>
natural defenses against other organisms. The group of microorganisms<br>
pathogenic to insects is varied and diverse. The gram-positive soil<br>
bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis is one of many B.<br>
thuringiensis strains able to produce insecticidal proteins. These<br>
proteins, expressed during the sporulation cycle of the bacterium,<br>
assemble into parasporal crystalline inclusion bodies. The parasporal<br>
crystal produced by B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis is toxic when<br>
ingested by the larvae of Diptera, including mosquitoes and black flies.<br>
Upon ingestion, crystal proteins are solubilized in the larval midgut and<br>
disrupt the epithelium of the larval midgut region. Swelling and/or lysis of<br>
the epithelial cells is followed by larval death from starvation.<br>
Bacillus thuringienesis subspecies israelensis (B.ti.) has been used<br>
successfully in mosquito and blackfly control programs for many years.<br>
B.ti. is utilized in clean to moderately clean organic breeding habitats,<br>
and is most effective on Aedes species. A commercial formulation of<br>
B.ti. is known by the trademark VECTOBAC, available from Valent<br>
BioSciences Corp. Specific commerical formulations available from the<br>
same supplier are VECTOBAC G, VECTOBAC CG, VECTOBAC 12AS<br>
and VECTOBAC WDG. B.t.i. is effective against a broad range of<br>
mosquito species, offers low mammalian toxicity and is easy to apply.<br>
B.t.i. also has a very low susceptibility to the development of resistance,<br>
[because its larvacidal activity is based on multiple toxins. The chances<br>
that individual mosquitoes within a treated population will not be<br>
susceptible to all toxins is extremely small.<br>
Bacillus sphaericus {B.s.) is a rod-shaped, aerobic, spore-forming<br>
bacterium found commonly in soil and other substrates. To date, at least<br>
16 strains have been found to show mosquitocidal properties of various<br>
degrees. Several strains such as 1593M, 2362 and 2297 exhibit high<br>
toxicity to mosquito larvae. B.s. strain 2362, (VECTOLEX, available from<br>
Valent BioSciences Corp.) has been utilized in many countries<br>
successfully. Specific commercial formulations of B.s. available from the<br>
same source are VECTOLEX WDG, SPHERIMOS AS and VECTOLEX<br>
CG. Moreover, this strain was found to perform well in controlling<br>
mosquitoes breeding in various habitats, especially ones with polluted<br>
water.<br>
B. s. is most effective on Culex species. The activity of B.s. is due to<br>
a binary toxin, and repeated use can Jead to development of resistance.<br>
However, various levels of resistance to B.s. by mosquito larvae have<br>
been observed in Culex pipiens and Culex quinquefasciatus.<br>
We have now found that a combination of B.t.i. and B.s. is an<br>
effective larvicidal formulation. Non-genetically modified components are<br>
utilized, which are desirable if the larvicide is to be utilized in an<br>
environment connected with production or harvesting of food sources<br>
such as crops, cattle or swine. Non-genetically modified B.t.i. or B.s. may<br>
be defined as strains which occur naturally, and are not strains resulting<br>
from recombinant DNA techniques.<br>
B.t.i. and B.s. may be combined by mixing the powdered forms of<br>
each of the individual strains, or by mixing the slurries of the fermentation<br>
broths of each strain, in the desired ratio, as illustrated by Examples 1-6<br>
which follow. The ratio of B.t.i. to B.s. may be from about 10:1 to about<br>
1:10; preferably from about 3:1 to about 1:3, more preferably from about<br>
2:1 to about 1:2 and most preferably about 1:1.<br>
The compositions disclosed above may also include additional<br>
components such as a surface active agent, an inert carrier, a<br>
preservative, a humectant, a feeding stimulant, an attractant, a drift<br>
control agent, a spray deposition aid, an encapsulating agent, a binder,<br>
an emulsifier, a dye, a U.V. protectant, a buffer, a free-flow agent, or any<br>
other component which stabilizes the active ingredient, facilitates product<br>
handling and application for the particular target pests, Diptera.<br>
Suitable surface-active agents include anionic compounds such as a<br>
carboxyiate, for example, a metal carboxylate of a long chain fatty acid; a<br>
N-acylsarcosinate; mono or di-esters of phosphoric acid with fatty alcohol<br>
ethoxylates or salts of such esters; fatty alcohol sulphate such as sodium<br>
dodecyl sulphate, sodium octadecyl sulphate or sodium acetyl sulphate;<br>
ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates; ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphates;<br>
lignin sulphonates; petroleum sulphonates; alkyl aryl sulphonates such as<br>
alkyl-benzene sulphonates or lower alkylnaphthalene sulphonates, e.g.,<br>
butyl-naphthalene suiphonate; salts or sulphonated naphthalene-<br>
formaldehyde condensates; salts of sulphonated phenol-formaldehyde<br>
condensates; or more complex sulphonates such as the amide<br>
sulphonates, e.g., the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid and<br>
N-methyltaurine or the dialkyl sulphosuccinates, e.g., the sodium<br>
suiphonate or dioctyl succinate.<br>
Non-ionic agents include condensation products of fatty acid esters,<br>
fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or fatty-alkyl- or alkenyl-substituted<br>
phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers, e.g.,<br>
sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation products of such esters with<br>
ethylene oxide, e.g., polyoxythylene sorbitan fatty acids esters, block<br>
copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, acetylenic glycols<br>
such as 2,4,7,9-tetraethyl-5-decyn-4,7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic<br>
glycols.<br>
Examples of a cationic surface-active agent include, for instance, an<br>
aliphatic mono-, di-, or polyamide as an acetate, naphthenate or oleate;<br>
an oxygen-containing amine such as an amine oxide of polyoxethylene<br>
alkylamine; an amid-iinked amine prepared by the condensation of a<br>
carboxylic acid with a di- or polyamine; or a quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
Examples of inert materials include inorganic minerals such as kaolin,<br>
mica, gypsum, fertilizer, sand, phyllosilicates, carbonates, sulphate, or<br>
phosphates; organic materials such as sugars, starches, or cyclodextrins;<br>
or botanical materials such as wood products, cork, powdered corncobs,<br>
rice hulls, peanut hulls, and walnut shells<br>
The formulation may also contain added drift control agents or spray<br>
deposition aids to control droplet size and to facilitate aerial application.<br>
Examples of suitable compounds for these purposes include<br>
polyvinylalcohol polymer solutions, polyamide copolymer solutions,<br>
polymerized acrylic acid derivatives and blends thereof, vegetable oils<br>
and blends thereof, petroleum oils and blends thereof, as well as natural<br>
and synthetic polymers.<br>
In the formulations, more than one of the additional components<br>
described above may advantageously be utilized.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be applied as a liquid,<br>
an aqueous suspension, an emulsifiable suspension, or a solid by<br>
conventional application techniques for each. Solid formulations are<br>
presently preferred. In general, the application rate of the larvicidally-<br>
effective combination of the present invention will deliver a quantity of<br>
pesticide sufficient to control the population of a target pest.<br>
Solid compositions may be formed by spray drying the B.ti. and B.s<br>
slurries separately and combining the powder or by combining the slurries<br>
and spray drying the combined slurry to form a powder.<br>
The composition of the present invention can be in a suitable form for<br>
direct application or as a concentrate or primary composition which<br>
requires dilution with a suitable quantity of water or other diluent before<br>
application. The pesticidal concentration will vary depending upon the<br>
nature of the particular formulation, specifically, whether it is a<br>
concentrate or to be used directly. The composition may contain from<br>
about 1 to 98% by weight of a solid or liquid inert carrier, and 0.1 to 50%<br>
by weight of a surfactant. These compositions will be administered at the<br>
rate of about 50 mg (liquid or dry) to 20 kg or more per hectare.<br>
The Methods<br>
The combination of the present invention can be treated prior to<br>
formulation to prolong the pesticidal activity when applied to the<br>
environment of a target pest as long as the pretreatment is not<br>
deleterious to the combination. Such treatment can be by chemical<br>
and/or physical means as long as the treatment does not deleteriously<br>
affect the properties of the composition(s). Examples of chemical<br>
reagents include, but are not limited to, halogenating agents; aldehydes<br>
such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde; anti-infectives, such as<br>
zephiran chloride; alcohols, such as isopropanol and ethanol; and<br>
histological fixatives, such as Bouin's fixative and Helly's fixatives.<br>
The compositions of the invention can be applied directly to the<br>
environment to be treated. Ponds, lakes, streams, rivers, still water, and<br>
other areas subject to infestation by dipteran pests are examples of<br>
environments needing such treatment. The composition can be applied<br>
by spraying, dusting, sprinkling, and broadcasting, among others.<br>

The ability of combination of the present invention to inhibit larvicidal<br>
resistance is described in detail hereinafter in the Examples. These<br>
Examples are presented to describe preferred embodiments and utilities of<br>
the invention and are not meant to limit the invention unless otherwise<br>
stated in the claims appended hereto.<br>
Example 1<br>
The combination larvicide of the present invention was formulated<br>
as a mix of two commercially available strains: VECTOBAC CG, a<br>
commercial granular formulation of B.t.i. with a label potency of 200<br>
ITU/mg, and VECTOLEX CG, a commercial granular formulation of B.s.<br>
with a label potency of 50 B.s. ITU/mg. Typically, the spray-dried technical<br>
concentrate of each strain is first incorporated into a known amount of<br>
vegetable oil binder. The amount of vegetable oil binder in the formula will<br>
depend upon the amount of B.t.i. or B.s. spray technical concentrate in the<br>
formula. The typical range may vary between 1% to 15% wt/wt.<br>
depending upon the amount of B.t.i. or B.s. spray dried technical<br>
concentrate, and the type, size and absorptive property of granular carrier<br>
utilized in the formula. In this example, corn cob granules of the size<br>
classification 10/14 Mesh were used. However, other size ranges such as<br>
5/8 Mesh, 10/20 Mesh, 10/40 Mesh are also suitable. The slurry mixture<br>
was sprayed onto the granular carrier while mixing in a suitable blender<br>
and further blended until homogenous product was obtained.<br>
Example 2 ....<br>
A B.t.i. and B.s. granular formulation for enhanced and broad-<br>
spectrum activity was prepared. Pre-formulated granular products of B.t.i.<br>
and B.s., (VECTOBAC CG and VECTOLEX CG), were utilized in<br>
developing the combination formulation. The resultant combination<br>
granular product was targeted to contain B.t.i. at 100 ITU/mg and B.s. at<br>
25 B.s. ITU/mg. The carrier utilized was 10/14 Mesh corn cob.<br>
To prepare the formulation, 5 kg each of VECTOLEX CG and<br>
VECTOBAC CG were charged into a blender and blended. The product<br>
mix was then recovered.<br>
Representative samples were taken for bioassay. Table 1 shows<br>
the amount of the raw materials which were used to form the product<br>
combination<br>
* Commercial B.t.i. granular formulation with a label potency of 200<br>
ITU/mg<br>
** Commercial B.s. granular formulation with a label potency of 50<br>
B.s. ITU/mg<br>
Bioassay results for the B.t.i. and B.s. combination samples when<br>
tested against fourth instar Aedes aegypti and third instar Culex<br>
quinquefaciatus are shown in Table 2 below. ITU stands for international<br>
toxicity units, which are based on a reference material of known specific<br>
B.t.i. potency.<br>
In a preferred formulation, the one to one weight ratio of B.t.i. to B.s.<br>
has a potency of 100 ITU/mg for B.t.i. and 25 ITU/mg for B.s., which is<br>
equivalent to a 4:1 ratio on a potency basis.<br>
Example 3<br>
The larvicidal combination product may also be formulated by<br>
combining the required levels of both B.t.i. and B.s. technical powders in<br>
the same binder liquid, and then impregnating or spraying onto the<br>
granular carrier such as corn cob or any other suitable carriers.<br>
To prepare the formulation, both spray dried technical concentrates<br>
can be slurried in vegetable oil binder liquid and sprayed onto granular<br>
carrier in a suitable blender and mixed until a homogenous product is<br>
obtained. The theoretical components of the combination formulation<br>
containing B.t.i. at 100 ITU/mg and B.s. at 25 B.s... ITU/mg are provided in<br>
Table 3 below.<br>
Example 4<br>
The combined formulation may also be formed by pre-mixing<br>
fermentation beers or slurry concentrates of Bti and Bs at the desired<br>
solids or potency level and spray drying the slurry mixture to produce a<br>
combined technical spray dried powder concentrate. In such a<br>
formulation, the slurry concentrate may contain preservatives, stabilizers,<br>
surfactants, dispersants and other binders. The spray-dried technical<br>
concentrate or powder may then be utilized in formulating a granular<br>
product as in Examples 2 and 3 or as wettable powders, water dispersible<br>
granules, and aqueous or non-aqueous concentrates. These combined<br>
powder concentrates may also be utilized in pellet and/or briquette<br>
formulations. A spray drying experiment was performed combining Bti and<br>
Bs fermentation slurry concentrates at various ratios based on % solids<br>
level in each of the slurry concentrates. A Bti slurry concentrate was first<br>
preserved with 0.12% wt/wt of potassium sorbate and 0.06% wt/wt of<br>
methyl paraben. % solids in the preserved Bti slurry concentrate were<br>
11.3% wt/wt. Similarly, a Bs slurry concentrate with 0.12% wt/wt of<br>
potassium sorbate and 0.06% wt/wt of methyl paraben was preserved.<br>
Per cent solids in the preserved Bs slurry concentrate had a mean %<br>
solids of 10.1% wt/wt. Slurry mixtures prepared and their rations on solids<br>
basis are given in Table 4<br>
The compositions as shown in Table 4 were combined and spray<br>
dried utilizing a Niro spray. Inlet temperature ranged between 180 °C and<br>
190 °C and outlet temperature during drying ranged between 68 °C to 81<br>
°C. The technical powders were sieved through 100-mesh standard sieve<br>
and samples were bioassayed against L4 Aedes aegypti and L3 Culex<br>
quinquefasciatus. Average potency data is represented in Table 5.<br>
Table 5 Potency values of Bti + Bs. spray dried technical powders as<br>
affected by their ratios on solids basis. Mean Bti spray dried technical<br>
powder potency = 7474 ITU/mg. MeanBs spray dried technical powder<br>
potency = 3030 Bs. ITU/mg (All assays are average of initial and 2 month<br>
5 °C stored samples )<br>
Biopotency data presented in Table 5 reveal an interesting but very<br>
synergistic increase in actual potency of both Bti and Bs over theoretical<br>
potencies, which are, based on actual potencies of 100% of either Bti or<br>
Bs spray dried technical powders. The best combination for increased<br>
activity on both Aedes and Culex appeared to be when Bti and Bs slurry<br>
concentrates are combined at 1 part of Bti to 2 parts of Bs on solids basis.<br>
For enhancing the Bs potency, the best combination was when two parts<br>
of Bti solids was combined with 1 part of Bs solids. In this combination, Bs<br>
potency showed 47% increase over theoretical potency. By combining the<br>
Bti and Bs slurry concentrates prior to spray drying, Bti potency on<br>
average showed an increase of 35% over mean theoretical mean potency<br>
while Bs potency showed an increase of 24% over theoretical mean<br>
potency. There appeared to be significant advantage in combining the<br>
slurry concentrates prior to spray drying and further formulating these<br>
powders as granules, wettable powders, water dispersible granules, or<br>
pellet formulations. The best possible explanation for these enhanced<br>
potency values appeared to be due to the fact that each spray dried<br>
particle carries both Bti and Bs toxins and spores. In other words, these<br>
are not physical mixtures as revealed in Example 2 or 3. Thus, these<br>
novel formulation approaches are likely to not only result in broad-<br>
spectrum activity but also will minimize the potential for build up of<br>
resistance. In other words, resistance management can also be achieved<br>
yet by another novel formulation approach.<br>
Example 5<br>
The combination larvicidal formulation may also be prepared in<br>
liquid form by adding, at the desired level, both VECTOBAC WDG (3000<br>
ITU/mg) and VECTOLEX WDG (650 ITU/mg) to water in the spray tank<br>
and mixing until a homogeneous dispersion is obtained. The suspension<br>
so formed may be delivered to the target habitat by various application<br>
methods. A liquid formulation is ideal for spray operations.<br>
Example 6<br>
A liquid formulation may be prepared from liquid formulations of<br>
each individual strain. VECTOBAC 12AS and SPHERIMOS AS (aqueous<br>
suspension product forms marketed by Valent BioSciences Corp.) may<br>
also be mixed in water in the spray tank and applied by various spray<br>
application equipment. Formulating B.t.i. and B.s. as one aqueous<br>
formulation with preservatives, stabilizers, surfactants, dispersants,<br>
diluents is yet another preferred method for delivering both toxins to the<br>
mosquito habitats.<br>
Example 7<br>
The change in susceptibility of Culex quinquefasciatus laboratory<br>
colonies known to be B. s. resistant, in response to selection with a<br>
mixture of B.t.i. and B.s. was determined in the laboratory in the following<br>
manner. Selection refers to treatment at less than LC100 level.<br>
A colony of Culex quinquefasciatus resistant to B.s. was started<br>
from susceptible larvae collected from a waste water lagoon of a dairy in<br>
the western United States. Field collected larvae were subjected to<br>
selection at LC90 every generation for forty generations. At the 40th<br>
generation, the colony shwed a 54.4 and 14.2 fold resistance at LC50 and<br>
LC90 levels respectively. This colony was used for the subsequent tests.<br>
A resistant colony is one which demonstrates a significant decrease<br>
in susceptibility to a particular pesticide over that expected for wild type<br>
insects. Generally, a five-fold or more decrease in susceptibility indicates<br>
resistance. Rodcharoen et al., Journal of Economic Entomology, Vol. 87,<br>
No. 5,1994, pp. 1133-1140 explore the concept of resistance more fully.<br>
A susceptible colony is one which is effectively killed by a particular<br>
pesticide. For example, in Culex quinquifasciatus, if a particular pesticide,<br>
Bacillus sphaericus, has a measured LC50 value of less than 0.1 ppm, the<br>
colony is characterized as susceptible to that pesticide.<br>
Stock suspensions were prepared by mixing 0.2 g of B.t.i. or B.s. in<br>
20 ml of distilled water to make a 1% suspension; mixtures were made by<br>
combining the stock suspensions in the desired ratio. Suspensions were<br>
subsequently diluted as required for test treatments.<br>
The parental colony and the tenth generation were bioassayed by<br>
placing 20 late third or early fourth instar larvae in a 116 ml waxed paper<br>
cup containing 100 ml distilled water. One drop of larval diet (2 g of<br>
ground up rabbit pellets in 20 ml distilled water) was added per cup. The<br>
cups were treated with a range of concentrations of either larvicide alone,<br>
as well as the mixture. Five to seven different concentrations in the range<br>
of 0.0001-0.1 ppm were utilized in each bioassay to yield mortalities.<br>
Each concentration was replicated four to five times in each test. The<br>
treated larvae were held at 82-85 F. To determine LC50 values, the<br>
number of dead larvae were counted at regular intervals from the time of<br>
treatment with the test larvicide. Once all larvae died, the concentration<br>
wherein 50% had been killed could be determined.<br>
Colonies treated individually at the LC80 level with B.s. (Bacillus<br>
sphaericus strain 2362, ABG-6184, VECTOLEX, available from Valent<br>
BioSciences Corp.) or B.t.i. (Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis<br>
(VECTOBAC available from Valent BioSciences Corp.) were compared to<br>
a colony treated with a 1:2 weight ratio of B.s. (VECTOLEX) to B.t.i.<br>
(VECTOBAC) for five generations at the LC50 level, followed by treatment<br>
with a 1:1 weight ratio of B.s. (VECTOLEX) to B.t.i. (VECTOBAC) for five<br>
more generations at the LCso level.<br>
Following the first five generations of these treatments, lower mean<br>
B.s. LC50 values were obtained for the colonies subjected to selection by<br>
the 1:2 combination than for either colony selected by the individual<br>
components, indicating an increased susceptibility and consequently<br>
decreased resistance as illustrated by Table 6. Mean B.s. LC50 values<br>
continued to decline under selection with the 1:1 combination during the<br>
subsequent five generations.<br>
Table 6<br>
This table shows data from the original selection study through F25. One<br>
key change in the selection was that the B.t.i., selected colony was<br>
switched to B.s. selection after F10 to assess stability of susceptibility in<br>
the colony.<br>
Table 6 Change in B.s. Susceptibility in ppm of a B.s. Resistant Colony in<br>
Response to selection with B.t.i., B.s. and mixtures<br>
Example 8<br>
The bioassay procedure described in Example 7 was utilized in<br>
order to assess the susceptibility of B.s. resistant and susceptible Culex<br>
quinquefasciatus colonies to B.t.i., B.s. a 2:1 mixture of B.t.i. to B.s.<br>
Mean LC50 values were determined for each treatment. A lower<br>
mean LC50 value indicates that the particular treatment can be used<br>
effectively at a lower concentration, which indicates that the organisms are<br>
more susceptible to the treatment.<br>
The results are provided in Table 7 below. As expected, the B.s.<br>
treatment gave the highest mean LC50 for the B.s. resistant colony.<br>
However, the 2:1 ratio mixture shows an improved result over the result for<br>
B.t.i. and B.s. alone, both in susceptible and resistant colonies, indicating a<br>
higher susceptibility and possible synergism when the components are<br>
combined.<br>
Example 9<br>
The efficacy of a 2:1 mixture of B.t.i. to B.s. on Culex<br>
quinquefasciatus colonies determined to be susceptible to B.s. was tested<br>
as follows.<br>
A mixed susceptible colony of Culex quinquefasciatus was<br>
established from a combination of egg rafts collected from a site in the<br>
western United States. The collected egg rafts were individually<br>
transferred to 230 ml waxed paper cups each holding 200 ml tap water<br>
and 0.5 g rabbit pellets as larval diet. The larvae were hatched out. Then<br>
pupae were removed into cups with water and placed in screen cages,<br>
where the adults emerged. The adults were provided with 10% sucrose<br>
solution, and on day five after emergence, females were allowed to feed<br>
on restrained chicks. On day 5 subsequent to this blood feeding,<br>
oviposition cups were introduced into the cages to collect eggs. To<br>
maintain the colony in the laboratory, 4-5 egg rafts were placed in an<br>
enamel pan containing 2 liters of tap water and 2 g. of rabbit pellets as<br>
larval diet.<br>
The sample preparation conditions, bioassay method, and LC50<br>
determination were the same as those described in Example 7. The<br>
results are provided in Table 8 below. The results show that over time, the<br>
test colony which was B.s. susceptible, becomes less susceptible by the<br>
fifth generation in response to treatment with B.s. alone, since the LC50<br>
value increases. In contrast, the 2:1 mixture does not show the same<br>
tendency to the same extent. This fact is indicated by the data which,<br>
while showing an increase in LC50 over the parental strain, also show less<br>
of an increase than for the treatment with B.s. alone. Therefore, use of the<br>
2:1 B.t.i. and B.s. mix slowed the resistance over time.<br>
Table 8<br>
Table 8 also shows data from the original selection study through F20.<br>
One key change in the selection was that the mixture-selected colony was<br>
switched from a 2:1 B.t.i./B.s. (VectoBac WDGA/ectoLex WDG) to a 1:1<br>
mixture selection after F5.<br>

to B.t.i and B.s. mixtures.<br>
Example 10<br>
The following experiment was performed to demonstrate the utility<br>
of the mixture for controlling mosquitos of varying species. In this<br>
example, the effectiveness of the mixture and each individual larvicide<br>
were determined on a mixed population of Culex quinquefasciatus and<br>
Aedes aegypti.<br>
Twenty plastic rearing tubs were placed outside in a midwestern<br>
United States location. The tubs were filled with deionized water and<br>
enriched with 2.4 g of ground guinea pig chow. The tubs were then<br>
infested with 100 third instar Culex quinquefasciatus and 100 third instar<br>
Aedes aegypti. One hour after the infestation, and just prior to treatment,<br>
tubs were sampled and the number of larvae in a test sample from each<br>
tub were counted, to obtain a control value.<br>
Test larvicides included VECTOLEX CG (50 B.s. ITU/mg on corn<br>
cob granules), VECTOBAC CG (200 ITU/mg on corn cob granules) and a<br>
1:1 mixture of VECTOLEX CG and VECTOBAC CG, as described in<br>
Example 2. Each tub was treated with an appropriate amount of one of<br>
the three test larvicides, equivalent to a single treatment rate of 5, 10 or 20<br>
lbs/acre.<br>
On the fifth and twelfth day after treatment, 100 third instar Culex<br>
quinquefasciatus and 100 third instar Aedes aegypti were added to each<br>
tub.<br>
Larvae were sampled from the tubs on the second day, the seventh<br>
day and the fourteenth day after treatment to determine how many were<br>
still alive. The numbers were obtained and compared to the number of<br>
larvae alive prior to treatment. 100% reduction indicates that all larvae<br>
were killed. A positive number for percent reduction indicates that the<br>
larvicide does kill. The results are provided in Table 9 below, indicating<br>
that the 1:1 mixture of B.t.i. to B. s. can control Culex quinquefasciatus and<br>
Aedes aegypti larvae, even over a period of several days, at each<br>
application rate tested.<br>
Example 11<br>
Another experiment was performed to demonstrate the utility of the<br>
mixture for killing mosquitos of varying species. In this example, the<br>
effectiveness of the mixture and each individual larvicide were determined<br>
on Culex tarsalis.<br>
The test was performed on mosquitoes in a waste water pond of a<br>
waste water treatment facility in the western United States. The pond was<br>
extremely polluted, and standard tests showed the presence of Culex<br>
tarsalis. Tall reeds covered 80% of the water surface. The edge of the<br>
pond was divided into six plots ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 acres in size, for the<br>
purposes of the test.<br>
Just prior to treatment, each test plot was sampled and the number<br>
of larvae in a test sample from each plot were counted, to obtain a control<br>
value.<br>
Test larvicides were the formulations described in Example 10, and<br>
then each plot was treated with an appropriate amount of one of the three<br>
test larvicides, equivalent to a single treatment rate of 5 or 10 lbs/acre.<br>
Larvae were sampled from the test plots on the second day, the<br>
seventh day and the fourteenth day after treatment, to determine how<br>
many were still alive. The numbers were obtained and compared to the<br>
number of larvae alive prior to treatment. 100% reduction indicates that all<br>
larvae were killed. A positive number for percent reduction indicates that<br>
the larvicide does kill. The results are provided in Table 10 below,<br>
indicating that the 1:1 mixture of B.t.i. to B. s. can control Culex tarsalis<br>
larvae.<br>
Example 12<br>
Another experiment was performed to demonstrate the utility of the<br>
mixture for killing mosquitos of varying species. In this example, the<br>
effectiveness of the mixture and each individual larvicide were determined<br>
on Culexpipiens and Culiseta incidens outdoors in a roadside ditch.<br>
Two sections of a roadside ditch separated by a driveway in the<br>
western United States were the site of the study. The ditches were<br>
vegetated with grasses and aquatic plants and received seepage runoff<br>
from.a septic system as well as rainfall. A drainage swale with similar<br>
hydrology and vegetation was selected as the untreated control. Each site<br>
was populated with Culex pipiens and Culiseta incidens at the time of<br>
treatment.<br>
Just prior to treatment, each test plot was sampled and the number<br>
of larvae in a test sample from each plot were counted, to obtain a control<br>
value.<br>
Test larvicides were of the formulations described in described in<br>
Example 10, and then two of the test sites were treated with an<br>
appropriate amount of one of the two test larvicides, equivalent to a single<br>
treatment rate of 20 lbs/acre. The remaining test site was untreated, to<br>
serve as the control.<br>
Larvae were sampled from the test plots on the fourth day and the<br>
seventh day after treatment. The numbers were obtained and compared<br>
to the number of larvae prior to treatment. 100% reduction indicates that<br>
all larvae were killed. A positive number for percent reduction indicates<br>
that the larvicide does kill. The results are provided in Table 11 below,<br>
indicating that the 1:1 mixture of B.t.i. to B. s. can control Culex pipiens<br>
and Culiseta incidens larvae.<br>
Example 13<br>
The efficacy of a 2:1 mixture B.s. (VECTOLEX) to B.t.i.<br>
(VECTOBAC) was determined in the field in the following manner.<br>
The test field was a rice field in the western United States,<br>
measuring 156 acres. Levees were used a buffer zones between test<br>
plots. At the time of the treatment, Anopheles freeborni larvae were<br>
present at a density of 0.5-3.0 per dip, according to a standard dip test.<br>
Each individual larvicide, and the larvicidal combination were applied at a<br>
rate of 12 lbs/acre by airplane, which applied the granules at a speed of 85<br>
miles per hour and with a swath width of 60 feet.<br>
Larval counts were performed on days 2, 6 and 15 post-treatment,<br>
and measured against the larval count of an untreated control test plot.<br>
The results are shown in Table 12 below, illustrating that a 2:1 mix<br>
effectively kills larvae, as a positive number for percent control of larvae<br>
indicates that the larvicide does kill.<br>
Example 14<br>
The following studies demonstrate the susceptibility of various B.s.<br>
susceptible and non-susceptible mosquitoes to mixtures. They support<br>
the claims of mixtures as a method of controlling mosquitoes, and<br>
controlling B.s. resistant mosquitoes. Three of the studies also support the<br>
method of mixing technical powders prior to formulation of granules.<br>

Resistant Culex quinquefasciatus Field Populations Compared to Each<br>
Formulation Separately.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
A highly resistant population of Culex quinquefasciatus was<br>
identified in Wat Pikul, Bang Yai District, Nonthaburi Province, Thailand.<br>
This population was treated with various doses of VectoBac WDG (3000<br>
Bti ITU) and VectoLex WDG (650 Bs ITU) and a 1:1 mixture of the two<br>
between January and September of 2001. Following each treatment,<br>
population changes were assessed overtime by dipping, and percent<br>
control of late instar larvae and pupae was calculated for post treatment<br>
days.<br>
Results<br>
Doses of VectoLex WDG as high as 200 mg/m2 resulted in little or<br>
no control of this population. VectoBac WDG was found to provide control<br>
at doses as low as 20 mg/m2. A 1:1 mix of the two products was found to<br>
be more effective than either product alone at a dose of 20mg/m2.<br>

pipiens and Culiseta incidens Compared to Standard B.s. Formulation in<br>
Artificial Plots<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Twenty eight artificial test plots were set up using wading pools in<br>
the parking area of Multonomah County Mosquito Control District's facility<br>
at 5235 N. Columbia Blvd, Portland, OR on July 27, 2001. The pools were<br>
set out in four rows with seven pools per row. Each row was designated<br>
as a test series. The pools were filled to a depth of approximately 8" with<br>
tap water from the District's water supply. This depth was. maintained<br>
throughout the study. Each pool had an approximate surface area of .785<br>
M2. Each pool was enriched with straw and rabbit chow (100gr.) to<br>
provide habitat and food for the mosquito larvae.<br>
The pools were left to season the hay/rabbit chow mix, and to allow<br>
natural populations of the local mosquitoes to become established.<br>
Artificial stocking of the test pools was done after the local mosquito<br>
populations failed to produce adequate populations in the pools for the<br>
study. After this initial stocking, populations of Culex pipiens and Culiseta<br>
incidens maintained themselves by natural re-infestation.<br>
Three formulations, designated ABG6185, VBC60015 and<br>
VBC60019 were compared in the study. ABG-6185 consisted of B.s.<br>
technical powder formulated onto corncob and had a potency of 50 B.s.<br>
ITU. VBC-60015 and VBC-60019 were combinations of B.t.i. and B.s.<br>
technical powders formulated onto corncob and had theoretical potencies<br>
of 200B.t.i./50B.s. ITU and 100B.U./50B.S. ITU respectively.<br>
Formulations were tested at application rates of 2.5kg/ha and 5kg/ha<br>
compared to untreated controls. Four replications were done for each<br>
application rate and UTC in a random pattern throughout the test series.<br>
Sampling was done by taking 5 dips per pool using standard<br>
mosquito dippers and concentrating the larval catch with fine mesh<br>
strainers. Composite samples were preserved in alcohol for counting and<br>
species identification. Larval counts were recorded as L1-L2, L3-L4 and<br>
pupae.<br>
Pretreatment counts, and the test product applications were done<br>
on August 20, 2001. The initial post- treatment larval counts were done on<br>
August 23, 2001 approximately 64 hours after the treatment. Follow-up<br>
counts were done on August 27, August 31 and a final count on<br>
September 6, 2001.<br>
Control success was determined by calculating mean numbers of<br>
3rd and 4th stage larvae, and pupae in the pre and post-treatment counts<br>
from the four replicates of each test. Percent control was calculated by<br>
and applying Mulla's formula to the overall population means for each<br>
treatment.<br>
Results<br>
Following treatment, mean populations in all treated plots declined<br>
relative to the untreated control plots, and were significantly lower (P=.05<br>
Student-Newman-Keuls) than the UTC at 7 days post treatment. There<br>
were numerical, but not statistically significant differences between<br>
individual treatments. Initial reductions (3 days post treatment) were<br>
highest overall for the combination formulations, and similar control was<br>
seen from the formulation throughout the duration of the study. Percent<br>
reductions from treatments at 2.5 kg/ha are shown in Table 14.<br>

Small Field Plots<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
The test site was a marsh where a small stream entered the<br>
Yakima River near Yakima, Washington. Natural populations of Culex<br>
tarsalis and Culex pipiens were present. Water was essentially stagnant.<br>
Depth was 6-12 inches and remained constant throughout the experiment.<br>
Water temperature ranged between 72 and 77 throughout the experiment.<br>
Vegetation was primarily grass with scattered broadleaf weeds covering<br>
80% of the surface, plant height was 6-15 inches in height. Cattle<br>
occasionally grazed in the site, but were not present during the test.<br>
Organic matter was very high at the site. Predator populations were<br>
generally low in the plots.<br>
The test was a randomized complete block experiment with three,<br>
1000 square foot plots per treatment. Plots were sampled immediately<br>
prior to the application on 7-19-01 and again 48 hours, 7 and 14 days after<br>
the application. Twenty dips with a standard mosquito dipper were made<br>
in each plot. Larvae instar 1-2, larvae instar 3-4 and pupae were counted<br>
in each dip.<br>
Three formulations, designated ABG6185, VBC60015 and<br>
VBC60019 were compared in the study. ABG-6185 consisted of B.s.<br>
technical powder formulated onto corncob and had a potency of 50 B.s.<br>
ITU. VBC-60015 and VBC-60019 were combinations of B.t.i. and B.s.<br>
technical powders formulated onto corncob and had theoretical potencies<br>
of 200B.t.i./5QB.s. ITU and 100B.t.i../50B.S. ITU respectively.<br>
Formulations were tested at an application rate of 5 lb/acre and compared<br>
to untreated controls. Data were analyzed with Analysis of Variance.<br>
Percent reductions were calculated with Mulia's formula and based on<br>
large larvae and pupae only. Overall population means for each treatment<br>
were used in this calculation.<br>
Results<br>
At two days after treatment, all three formulations provided<br>
significant although not outstanding control. The rate of 5 lbs/A may have<br>
been rather low for this site. Control at 7 and 14 days was not significant<br>
largely because the larval population in replicate two of the UTC had very<br>
low population. Nonetheless, percentage control was higher in all the<br>
treated plots than in untreated plots on day 7 and 14. In comparing the<br>
formulations, there did not appear to be any difference between treatments<br>
at day 2 but both the VBC formulations were better than ABG-6185 at day<br>
7. Corrected percent reductions calculated using overall population<br>
means of L3-pupae are shown in Table 15.<br>
Table 15 Corrected percent reduction of L3-L4 Culex larvae and pupae in<br>
small field plots following application of treatments at 5 lb/acre.*<br>
Efficacy of Four B.t.i./B.s. Combination Formulations for Control of<br>
Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus Compared to Standard B.t.i. Formulation in<br>
Artificial Plots<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Twenty-four artificial test plots located at the John A. Mulrenan, Sr.,<br>
Public Health Entomology Research and Education Center, in Panama<br>
City, Florida were utilized in this study. The plots were filled to a depth of<br>
approximately 6" with 3-5 ppt saline water. This depth was maintained<br>
throughout the study. Each plot had an approximate surface area of 8 ft2.<br>
Emergent grasses and a sandy soil substrate were present in the plots.<br>
Water temperature averaged 75 degrees Fahrenheit during the study.<br>
Artificial infestation of the test plots was done prior to initial<br>
treatment and every other day following the treatments. Approximately<br>
1000 third instar Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus larvae were added to each<br>
plot on each infestation day.<br>
Five formulations, designated ABG6138s, VBC60015, VBC60016,<br>
VBC60018 and VBC60019 were compared in the study. ABG-6138s<br>
consisted of B.t.i.. technical powder formulated onto corncob and had a<br>
potency of 200 B.t.i. ITU. VBC-60015, VBC60016, VBC60018 and VBC-<br>
60019 were combinations of B.t.i. and B.s. technical powders formulated<br>
onto corncob and had theoretical potencies of 200B.ti./50B.s. ITU,<br>
100B.t.i./25S.s. ITU, 200B.t.i./25 B.s. ITU, and 100B.t.i./50B.S. ITU<br>
respectively. Formulations were tested at application rates of 2.8kg/ha<br>
compared to untreated controls. Four replications were done for each<br>
application rate and UTC in a random pattern throughout the test series.<br>
Sampling was done by taking 8 dips per plot, using standard<br>
mosquito dippers. Numbers of larvae collected from each plot were<br>
recorded. Initial sampling was done 1 day following initial infestation and<br>
treatment, and repeated on days 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13 following treatment.<br>
Control success was determined by comparing number of larvae<br>
collected in treated plots to numbers collected in the UTC plots. Percent<br>
mortality was calculated for each treatment using the following formula.<br>
% mortality = (# larvae in control - # of larvae in treatment)/ # larvae in<br>
control<br>
Results<br>
One day after treatment, populations in all treated plots were<br>
significantly lower than in the UTC plots. Mean percent reductions on day<br>
one ranged from 79.7% for VBC60015 to 98.5 % for VBC60018. There<br>
were no significant differences between the treatments on this day. The<br>
materials continued to show efficacy through day 7 of the study, after<br>
which time percent control declined rapidly. Three of the combination<br>
treatments, VBC60015, VBC60018 and VBC60019, provided significantly<br>
higher overall percent reductions through the course of the 13-day study<br>
(LSMEANSSS multiple comparison test p=0.05).. Percent reductions<br>
through day 7 from treatments at 2.8 kg/ha are shown in Table 16.<br>
