DESCRIPTION<br>
HIGH-CONCENTRATION CARBURIZED/LOW-STRAIN QUENCHED<br>
MEMBER AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]      This invention relates to carburizing and quenching<br>
treatment widely used as a reinforcement method for machine<br>
structural members, more specif ically to a super carburized,<br>
quenched member featuring temper softening resistance, high<br>
strength, high contact pressure and the like, especially<br>
to a super carburized, low-distortion quenched member (which<br>
may hereinafter be referred to simply as "member") with<br>
mutually conflicting properties, that is, higher<br>
performance and heat-treatment distortion attained<br>
together and also to its production process.<br>
Prior Art<br>
[0002] Owing to excellent properties such as high fatigue<br>
strength and wear resistance, carburized and quenched<br>
members (hereafter referred to as "case hardened members")<br>
are widely used as various members in transport equipment,<br>
industrial machines and the like. From the viewpoint of<br>
dimensional reductions, weight reductions and/or the like<br>
through further improvements in the performance of such<br>
members, numerous developments have been made on case<br><br>
2<br>
hardened members. Recently, the vacuum carburizing<br>
(low-pressure carburizing) process has been developed.<br>
Compared with the conventional gas carburizing process, the<br>
vacuum carburizing process has excellent characteristic<br>
features such as environmental friendliness, the prevention<br>
of intergranular oxidation, the feasibility of<br>
high-temperature carburizing treatment, and easy control<br>
of carburizing and carbon diffusion, and therefore, is<br>
expected to find still broader utility from the standpoints<br>
of further improvements in the performance and quality of<br>
members and further improvements in their productivity.<br>
[0003] As a method for providing a machine structural member<br>
such as a gear or axle member with improved pitting resistance<br>
by applying carburizing and quenching to the member, there<br>
is carbonitriding treatment. According to this treatment,<br>
carbon and nitrogen are caused to concurrently diffuse into<br>
the matrix of a member such that the member can be provided<br>
with improved temper softening resistance. In addition,<br>
there has also been developed super carburizing treatment<br>
to have carbide precipitated in a surface layer portion of<br>
a member such that the member can be provided with improved<br>
temper softening resistance. Keeping in step with<br>
evolutions in low-pressure carburizing facilities, a great<br>
deal of research has been conducted in recent years.<br>
[0004]      As a representative example of the super carburizing<br>
treatment, Patent Document 1 discloses a carburizing<br><br>
3<br>
treatment process for a member. According to Patent<br>
Document 1, it is proposed to form quasispheroidal or<br>
spheroidal carbide at a volume percentage of 30% or higher<br>
within a range up to a depth of 0.4 mm by conducting<br>
precarburizing to such a carbon content that spheroidal<br>
carbide is caused to precipitate in a surface layer portion<br>
of a steel member and the carbon concentration in the surface<br>
layer portion becomes not higher than Acm but not lower than<br>
a eutectoid concentration between steel and carbon, slowly<br>
cooling or quenching the thus-treated member to convert the<br>
surface layer portion into a bainite, pearlite ormartensite<br>
structure, and then heating the member at a ramp rate of<br>
not greater than 20°C/min from the Ac1 point to a temperature<br>
in a range of from 750 to 950°C to effect carburizing and<br>
quenching.<br>
[0005] According to the above-described process, the member<br>
can be improved in properties such as pitting properties<br>
owing to the precipitation of the carbide in the surface<br>
layer portion of the member. Nonetheless, the resulting<br>
member involves problems such as a deformation and distort ion<br>
by heat treatment, because the process is super carburizing<br>
that causes the precipitation of the carbide as much as 30%<br>
in the surface layer portion.<br>
[0006] As a method for causing carbide to precipitate in an<br>
ultrafine form in a surface layer portion of a member by<br>
super carburizing, many heating and cooling methods have<br><br>
4<br>
been investigated. In Patent Document 1, it is described<br>
to be desirable that subsequent to the precurburizing, air<br>
cooling (which forms a bainite or pearlite structure) or<br>
quenching (which forms amartensite structure) is conducted,<br>
and that in the carbide-forming treatment as the next step,<br>
the member is heated at a slow ramp rate of not greater than<br>
20°C/min from the Ac1 transformation temperature to a<br>
temperature within the range of from 750 to 950°C, and after<br>
direct quenching or air cooling, the member is again heated<br>
and quenched.<br>
[0007]      Further, Patent Document 2 and Patent Document 3<br>
propose, as an optimal method, to conduct slow cooling (or<br>
30°C/hr or less) after precurburizing or primary<br>
carburizing.<br>
[0008]      When the quenching after the precarburizing or primary<br>
carburizing is conducted by air cooling or slow cooling in<br>
the method disclosed in Patent Document 1, 2 or 3, however,<br>
a network of carbide tends to precipitate along grain<br>
boundaries in a surface layer portion of a member. The next<br>
step, that is, the carbide-forming treatment can hardly break<br>
up the network of carbide in a short time to have the carbide<br>
distributed and precipitated within the surface layer<br>
portion. To overcome this shortcoming, heating and<br>
subsequent cooling may be conducted a plurality of times<br>
in some instances.<br>
[0009]      On the other hand, Patent Document 1 also discloses<br><br>
5<br>
quenching with an aim directed toward forming a martensite<br>
structure by increasing the cooling rate of a member<br>
subsequent to its precarburizing. This technique, however,<br>
involves a potential problem that carbide nuclei in a surface<br>
layer portion may dissolve out.  It is also concerned that<br>
the quenching may take place with supersaturated carbon,<br>
and due to high-carbon martensitic transformation, the<br>
member may develop a greater deformation or distortion<br>
through an expansion, shrinkage or the like.<br>
[0010] Patent Document 4 discloses a production process of<br>
a case hardened member by low-pressure carburizing. There<br>
is a reference to the conversion of carbide into an ultraf ine<br>
form such as the control of the carbon concentration at 0.5<br>
to 0.7 wt. % in primary carburizing and at 0.7 to 1 wt. % in<br>
secondary carburizing and the control of primary cooling<br>
at a very slow rate of from 1 to 10°C/min. Concerning<br>
deformation strain, however, this production process is not<br>
expected to be preferred like the above-mentioned Patent<br>
Documents 1, 2 and 3.<br>
[0011] Just for readers' information, a description is now<br>
made of some advantages of low-pressure carburizing, which<br>
is finding wide-spread commercial utility in recent years,<br>
over conventional gas carburizing.<br>
a)	A change from a carburizing step to a diffusion step can<br>
be readily and promptly modified.<br>
b)	High-temperature treatment is feasible so that prompt<br><br>
6<br>
carburizing can be conducted.<br>
c)	No intergranular oxidation takes place in a surface layer<br>
portion of a member, and in the member under treatment,<br>
it is hence possible to inhibit the occurrence of cracks<br>
which would otherwise begin to take place from such a<br>
defect.<br>
d)	No sooting takes place, thereby causing no uneven<br>
carburizing which would otherwise take place as a result<br>
of sooting.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0012]      Even in super carburizing by the conventional<br>
low-pressure carburizing, however, no optimal balance can<br>
be achieved between the progress of formation of carbide<br>
within a surface layer portion of a member under treatment<br>
and the microstructure of the surface layer portion. The<br>
problem of a deformation or strain of the treated member,<br>
therefore, still remains unresolved. As a consequence,<br>
grinding, strain-correcting finishing or the like is<br>
essential for the member after the carburizing step.  Such<br>
additional work has led to a reduction in the inherent ability<br><br>
7<br>
of super carburizing that permits use under higher contact<br>
pressure, a reduction in productivity and an increase in<br>
manufacturing cost, thereby preventing the popularization<br>
of super carburizing treatment.<br>
Means for Resolving the Problem<br>
[0013]      The present invention has resolved the<br>
above-described problem by developing an optimal process,<br>
which makes it possible to use a member under a higher contact<br>
pressure and also to provide the member with a lower strain<br>
whilemaking use of low-pressure carburizing facilities that<br>
permit a variety of control promptly with higher accuracy<br>
as to the concentration of carbon in the member, the<br>
repetition of carburizing treatment/diffusion treatment,<br>
and diverse temperature conditions, heating conditions and<br>
cooling rate (quenching) conditions for heating, soaking,<br>
carburizing, quenching and the like of the member.<br>
[0014]      The above-described problem can be resolved by the<br>
present invention as defined below:<br>
1. A process for producing a super carburized,<br>
low-distortion quenched member, which comprises a primary<br>
treatment of heating a steel member for a machine structure<br>
to a temperature within an austenite region by vacuum<br>
carburizing (low-pressure carburizing) to have carbon<br>
dissolved at least at a eutectoid carbon concentration of<br>
a surface layer portion of the member and then quenching<br>
the member at a cooling rate of from 3 to 15°C/sec from the<br><br>
8<br>
temperature within the austenite region to a temperature<br>
not higher than an A1 transformation point to have at least<br>
one of ultrafine carbide and nuclei of the carbide formed<br>
in the surface layer portion of the member; and a secondary<br>
treatment of subsequently heating and soaking the member<br>
to a temperature within the austenite region and then<br>
conducting rapid quenching to have ultrafine carbide<br>
precipitated in a range of from 10 to 30% in terms of effective<br>
hardened depth percentage in an outermost surface layer<br>
portion.<br>
[0015] 2. A production process as described above, wherein in the<br>
secondary treatment, additional carburizing treatment is<br>
applied to the surface layer portion of the member.<br>
3. A production process as described above, wherein in the<br>
secondary treatment, the ultrafine carbide is caused to<br>
precipitate in the surface layer portion of the member to<br>
form a structure composed primarily of martensite and<br>
containing a mixed structure of troostite and retained<br>
austenite or the like in parts thereof such that the outermost<br>
layer portion (a portion A) of the layer, a layer portion<br>
(a portion B) inner than the portion A and a layer portion<br>
(a portion C) inner than the portion B are in an order of<br>
A≥O≥B in terms of the fineness of austenite grain size.<br>
[0016]    A super carburized, low-distortion quenched member<br>
comprising a surface layer portion of a structure composed<br>
primarily of martensite and containing a mixed structure<br><br>
1<br>
9<br>
of troostite and retained austenite or the like in parts<br>
thereof, wherein in the surface layer, an outermost surface<br>
layer (a portion A), a layer (a portion B) inner than the<br>
portion A and a layer (a portion C) inner than the portion<br>
B are in an order of A≥C≥B in terms of the fineness of austenite<br>
grain size.<br>
Advantageous Effects of the Present Invention<br>
[0017]      The process according to the present invention<br>
performs the treatment of a member in low-pressure<br>
carburizing facilities while making the combined use of the<br>
primary treatment of conducting adequate super carburizing<br>
and quenching at an optimal cooling rate and the secondary<br>
treatment of subsequently causing a fine carbide to simply<br>
and efficiently precipitate; and can minimize the<br>
deformation and strain of the member treated through the<br>
heat treatment. Owing to the adoption of this process, the<br>
greatest concern about the conventional super carburizing,<br>
for example, the cumbersome grinding, strain correction and<br>
the like of the member after the treatment, such as the bending<br>
of an axle or the deformation strain of a tooth profile,<br>
can be substantially relieved, thereby bringing about<br>
advantageous effects that significant improvements can be<br>
made in the productivity, quality and cost of the case<br>
hardened member.<br>
[0018]      According to the process of the present invention,<br>
additional carburizing treatment may be applied to the<br><br>
10<br>
surface layer portion of the member in the secondary<br>
treatment. This additional carburizing treatment makes it<br>
possible to achieve a high hardness of matrix and also to<br>
reduce the crystal grain size of an outermost surface layer<br>
portion of the member to an ultrafine grain size and,<br>
therefore, is also extremely effective for providing the<br>
member with higher strength and higher toughness. By the<br>
process of the present invention, it is possible to readily<br>
achieve higher strength, higher toughness, higher contact<br>
pressure and the like for members such as axles and gears<br>
to which super carburizing has heretofore been hardly<br>
applicable. Therefore, the process according to the<br>
present invention can be widely applied to fields where there<br>
is a high need for such properties, and has an advantageous<br>
effect that it can make significant contributions to<br>
improvements in the performance of a member and also to<br>
reductions in the size and weight of the member.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
[0019]      Based on best modes for carrying out the invention,<br>
the present invention will next be described in further<br>
detail. The followings are the course of technical<br>
endeavors and the findings, which have led to the present<br>
invention.<br>
With a view to developing a super carburizing process<br>
for causing ultrafine carbide to precipitate in a surface<br><br>
11<br>
layer portion of a member by using low-pressure carburizing<br>
facilities, the present inventors carried out a thorough<br>
investigation on possible relations between the<br>
concentration of carbon in the surface layer portion and<br>
various heating and cooling conditions and the precipitation<br>
form of the ultrafine carbide in the surface layer portion<br>
and the microstructure of the matrix. Concerning<br>
improvements or the like in strain by heat treatment while<br>
assuming members such as gears and axles, research and<br>
development was also conducted from many directions. An<br>
aim was then set at the establishment of a novel process<br>
for super carburizing and low-strain quenching, which can<br>
achieve both of mutually-conflicting properties of<br>
providing a member with higher performance by super<br>
carburizing and minimizing a deformation, distortion or the<br>
like of the member while balancing them at high levels.<br>
[0020]      Upon applying super carburizing to a surface layer<br>
portion of steel (member), the most important point is to<br>
have ultrafine carbide precipitated as much as possible in<br>
a surface layer portion of the member through the optimal<br>
combination of the primary treatment and the secondary<br>
treatment.  In the control of the formation of the ultrafine<br>
carbide, carburizing and quenching facilities also play an<br>
important role.  In the present invention, a variety of<br>
developments were conducted while using low-pressure<br>
carburizing facilities that compared with conventional<br><br>
12<br>
carburizing facilities, permit a variety of control promptly<br>
with higher accuracy as to the concentration of carbon in<br>
the member, the repetition of carburizing<br>
treatment/diffusion treatment, and diverse temperature<br>
conditions, heating conditions and cooling rate (quenching)<br>
conditions for heating, soaking, carburizing, quenching and<br>
the like of the member.<br>
[0021]      Described specifically, a variety of investigations<br>
were conducted on the heating, soaking, super carburizing,<br>
diffusion and cooling (quenching) conditions of a member<br>
during the primary treatment to firstly reduce the<br>
deformation or strain of the member at the stage of the primary<br>
treatment.  In the secondary treatment as the next step,<br>
carburizing and quenching (cooling) conditions are<br>
important to permit adjustments or the like in the<br>
precipitation of ultrafine carbide and the grain size of<br>
austenite in the carburized layer.  Specifically, it has<br>
been found that in the secondary treatment, the deformation<br>
or strain of a member by the heat treatment can be minimized<br>
by controlling a range, in which the ultrafine carbide<br>
precipitate in a surface layer portion of the member, to<br>
10 to 30% in terms of effective case depth percentage and<br>
further by converting an outermost surface layer portion<br>
into an ultrafine crystalline structure.<br>
[0022]      The term "effective case depth percentage" as used<br>
herein means a ratio (t/T) of a precipitated depth (t) of<br><br>
13<br>
ultrafine carbide existing in an outermost surface "layer<br>
portion of a member to an effective case depth (T) of the<br>
member after completion of the secondary treatment<br>
(including the tempering treatment at 180°C) . It is to be<br>
noted that the term "effective case depth" means a distance<br>
froma surf ace of a hardened layer, whichis still inaquenched<br>
state or has been tempered at a temperature not exceeding<br>
200°C, to the position of a critical depth of a Vickers<br>
hardness (HV) of 550 as measured by the Method of Measuring<br>
Case Depth Hardened by Carburizing Treatment for Steel (JIS<br>
G0557) .<br>
Next, the term "precipitated depth of ultrafine<br>
carbide" means the maximum depth, where the ultrafine carbide<br>
exists, from the outermost surface layer portion of the<br>
member as determined by an analysis under an optical<br>
microscope or an electron microscope. To facilitate the<br>
discrimination of the ultrafine carbide, the member is<br>
analyzed in a state of being etched with an etching solution<br>
such as 5% nital etching reagent.<br>
[0023]      The vacuum carburizing (low-pressure carburizing)<br>
facilities for use in the present invention are equipped<br>
with a carburizing and heating chamber including a treatment<br>
furnace which is sectionally controllable at different<br>
pressures of from 200 to 2,000 Pa, and are available on the<br>
market. Conventionally-available vacuum carburizing<br>
facilities are all usable in the present invention. As the<br><br>
14<br>
primary treatment in the present invention, the member is<br>
heated and soaked to a predetermined temperature in the<br>
furnace of the facilities, and to raise the concentration<br>
of carbon in the surface layer portion of the member to or<br>
higher than the eutectoid carbon concentration, the member<br>
is then quenched at an appropriate cooling rate. In the<br>
subsequent secondary treatment, the carbide is caused to<br>
precipitate in an ultraf ine form in the surface layer portion<br>
of the member, optionally followed by additional carburizing<br>
treatment as needed.<br>
[0024]      According to the primary treatment in the process of<br>
the present invention, steel to be treated (member) is heated<br>
and soaked to an austenite region of from 900 to l,100°C,<br>
carburizing is conducted such that the carbon concentration<br>
of a surface layer portion becomes preferably 0.8 wt.% or<br>
higher, and from the thus-carburized state, quenching is<br>
then conducted at an optimal cooling rate. Optimal cooling<br>
conditions are to evenly cool the member at a cooling rate<br>
of from 3 to 15°C/sec over a temperature range of from the<br>
carburizing temperature (the temperature in the austenite<br>
region) to the A1 transformation temperature or lower,<br>
preferably to 400°C or lower. By this cooling, ultrafine<br>
carbide is caused to precipitate in the surface layer portion<br>
of the member so that a structure composed primarily of<br>
martensite is formed in the surface layer portion. The term<br>
"ultrafine carbide" means an M23C6 type carbide formed as<br><br>
15<br>
a result of bonding of carbide-forming elements such as Cr<br>
and Mo in Fe3C (cementite) or steel with carbon dissolved<br>
in supersaturation.<br>
[0025]      In the secondary treatment, the non-carburized<br>
portion (interior) of the member is heated and soaked to<br>
a range of from an austenizing temperature to the austenizing<br>
temperature + 80°C, preferably to a range of from 10 to 70°C<br>
above the austenizing temperature, and is then rapidly<br>
quenched to effect precipitation of ultrafine carbide such<br>
that the carbon concentration of the surface layer portion<br>
becomes preferably 0.8 wt.% or higher, more preferably 1.0<br>
to 2.0 wt.%.  It is preferred to apply, in parallel with<br>
the precipitation of the ultrafine carbide in the surface<br>
layer portion, additional carburizing treatment to the<br>
surface layer portion to promote the precipitation of the<br>
ultrafine carbide in the surface layer portion, and from<br>
the state that the carbon concentration of the matrix has<br>
been adequately adjusted, to further conduct rapid<br>
quenching.<br>
[0026]      The temperature of the final quenching after the<br>
secondary treatment varies depending on the pretreatment<br>
conditions, that is, whether the final quenching is after<br>
the heating and soaking or after the heating, soaking and<br>
additional carburizing. The rapid quenching can be<br>
conducted at the temperature after the pretreatment or at<br>
a temperature raised or lowered relative to the temperature<br><br>
16<br>
of the pretreatment. In other words, the temperature of<br>
the final quenching after the secondary treatment can be<br>
set at a level commensurate with the quality of heat treatment<br>
such as the hardness and microstructure required for the<br>
member.<br>
[0027] With a view to establishing optimal conditions for<br>
super carburizing, the present inventors conducted a<br>
detailed investigation on the carbon concentrations upon<br>
heating, soaking and carburizing and diffusion and various<br>
cooling (quenching) conditions with respect to the primary<br>
treatment in which super carburizing is applied to a surface<br>
layer portion of a member in low-pressure carburizing<br>
facilities and the secondary treatment in which ultrafine<br>
grains of carbide are caused to precipitated in the surface<br>
layer portion. As a result, it was succeeded in obtaining<br>
a super carburized, quenched member having a carbon<br>
concentration of preferably 0.8 wt.% or higher, more<br>
preferably from 1.0 to 2.0 wt.% in a range of from 10 to<br>
30% in terms of the percentage of an effective case depth<br>
(t/T) in an outermost surface layer portion and having a<br>
three-layer structure consisting of a superultrafine grain<br>
layer of No. 10 or greater austenite grain size, a fine grain<br>
layer and an ultrafine grain layer in this order from the<br>
outermost surface layer. It has been found that the super<br>
carburized, quenched member is minimized in deformation or<br>
distortion after the treatment and that the correction of<br><br>
17<br>
a strain, which has been unavoidable in the conventional<br>
super carburizing, can be obviated or can be readily<br>
conducted compared with the conventional process.<br>
Examples<br>
[0028]      Based on certain Examples, the present invention will<br>
next be described in further detail.<br>
Machine structural steels (materials) shown in Table<br>
1 were provided. Those materials were subjected beforehand<br>
to normalizing treatment at 900°C and were then machined<br>
to prepare stepped round-bar test pieces of 30/25/20 X<br>
L300mm, respectively. As carburizing and quenching of each<br>
test piece, the primary treatment of the super carburizing<br>
step in the present invention was conducted using facilities<br>
which permitted heating and carburizing at a low pressure<br>
and also permitted oil hardening and high pressure gas<br>
cooling.<br>
[0029]      It is to be noted that steel grades 1 and 2 are<br>
carburizing, quenching steels as specified under the JIS,<br>
steel grade 1 is SCM420, chromium-molybdenum steel, and steel<br>
grade 2 is SCr415, chromium steel. MAC14 as steel grade<br>
3 is a grade for a commercial product developed by a steel<br>
maker, and is steel developed by increasing the Cr content<br>
in comparison with the above-described two steel grades and<br>
further adding Mo element with a view to causing M23C6 type<br>
ultraf ine carbide to precipitate upon super carburizing (the<br><br>
18<br>
primary and secondary treatments).<br>

[0031]      Table 2 summarizes the results obtained by<br>
experimenting in various ways effects of the cooling rate<br>
on the states of carbide to be precipitated in surface layer<br>
portions of test pieces and the deformations of the test<br>
pieces by heat treatment through the primary treatment in<br>
the present invention. As conditions for the primary<br>
treatment, super carburizing of each test piece was conducted<br>
by the heat cycle shown in FIG. 1 such that subsequent to<br>
heating and soaking, an effective case depth of 0. 5 mm would<br>
be achieved. Described specifically, supercarburizingand<br>
diffusion treatment of each test piece were alternately<br>
conducted at 950°C for about 70 minutes, respectively, such<br>
that the carbon concentration of the surface layer portion<br>
of the test piece in its final state would be controlled<br>
at about 1. 5 wt. % . Froma state that the carbon concentration<br>
of the surface layer portion of each test piece was in<br><br>
19<br>
supersaturation, quenching of the test piece was conducted<br>
under the corresponding cooling rate condition shown in Table<br>
2 to investigate the shape and size of the carbide in the<br>
surface layer portion of the test piece and the<br>
microstructure of the surface layer portion of the test<br>
piece.<br>
[0032]     To determine the deformations and strains of the<br>
above-described steel grades by the primary treatment,<br>
stepped round-bar test pieces 30/25/20 X L300 mm) of<br>
the respective steel grades were provided as test pieces.<br>
In a state of being supported at opposite ends, each test<br>
piece was analyzed for a runout at its axial central part<br>
to investigate a relationship between the cooling rate and<br>
the axial of the test piece.<br><br><br><br>
21<br>
[0034]      The signs shown in the table and analysis methods of<br>
the properties shown there will now be described below.<br>
1)	The cooling rate indicates an average cooling rate at<br>
the axial central part of each test piece from the<br>
quenching temperature of 950°C after the completion of<br>
the carburizing and diffusion for the test piece to 400°C.<br>
2)	The shape and size of carbide was observed under a scanning<br>
electron microscope.<br>
3)	Abbreviations for microstructures<br>
F: ferrite, P: pearlite, B: bainite, T: troostite, M:<br>
martensite, y: retained austenite.<br>
4)	The radial runout indicates a runout of a test piece,<br>
which was mounted on a both-end supporting, runout<br>
measuring instrument, as measured at a central part of<br>
the test piece by a dial gauge.<br>
[0035] In each of the comparative examples shown as Test Piece<br>
Nos .1,4 and 6 in Table 2, the cooling rate during the cooling<br>
was as low as l°C/sec so that the carbide precipitated in<br>
the surface layer portion consisted primarily of a network<br>
of carbide formed of carbide flakes bonded together and the<br>
matrix was in the form of an slack quenching structure of<br>
ferrite, pearlite and bainite. As a consequence, those<br>
comparative examples were all large in radial runout and<br>
deformation. The comparative example shown as Test Piece<br>
No. 3, on the other hand, was subjected to rapid cooling<br>
equivalent to conventional oil quenching (20°C/sec).  Its<br><br>
22<br>
surface layer portion contained a very small amount of<br>
precipitated carbide, and had a structure quenched from a<br>
high carbon state that carbon was in supersaturation.  That<br>
comparative example was large in radial runout and<br>
deformation.<br>
[0036]      When the cooling rate was 4 to 12°C/sec as in each<br>
of the examples as Test Piece Nos. 2, 5 and 7 (the present<br>
invention) , ultraf ine carbide precipitated in a large amount,<br>
and moreover, microstructures appeared as nuclei for the<br>
ultrafine carbide, leading to improvements in the<br>
deformation and distortion (runout) of the test piece as<br>
the outstanding serious problems of super carburizing.<br>
Described specifically, compared with slow cooling that<br>
cooling is slow or rapid quenching that cooling is fast in<br>
contrast, the radial runout of each of the test pieces<br>
according to the present invention was of approximately a<br>
half level of the radial runouts in the rest of the examples,<br>
thereby realizing a substantial reduction in radial runout.<br>
From these results, the cooling rate during the quenching<br>
in the primary treatment is optimally 3 to 15°C/sec.<br>
[0037]      Table 3 shows the results obtained by using<br>
representative ones of the test pieces subjected to the<br>
primary treatment shown in Table 2, applying the secondary<br>
treatment in various ways to the representative test pieces<br>
to cause ultrafine carbide to finally precipitate in their<br>
surface layer portions, and investigating the carbon<br><br>
23<br>
concentrations, states of precipitated carbide,<br>
microstructures, crystal grain sizes, etc. in their surface<br>
layer portions and the radial runouts of the test pieces.<br>
As conditions for the secondary treatment, the heat cycle<br>
shown in FIG. 2 was followed, the soaking temperature was<br>
selectively set at three levels of 800°C, 850°C and 900°C,<br>
all above the A1 transformation temperature, and subsequent<br>
to the heating and soaking, additional carburizing was also<br>
conducted at the same time to achieve a carbon concentration<br>
higher than the eutectoid carbon concentration as a technique<br>
for further raising the carbon concentrations in the surface<br>
layer portions and also increasing the amounts of<br>
precipitated ultrafine carbide through the secondary<br>
treatment.<br>
The subscript "n" in (carburizing/diffusion)n or<br>
(additional carburizing/diffusion)n in FIGS. 1 through 3<br>
means the number of repetitions of carburizing or diffusion<br>
in the corresponding step, and is set in commensurate with<br>
the quality required for each member. In the case of Test<br>
Piece No. 2 shown as an example in Table 2, for example,<br>
n was set at 8 (n = 8), and in the case of Test Piece No.<br>
2-2 shown as an example in Table 3, on the other hand, n<br>
was set at 5 (n = 5).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
26<br>
[0039] [Analysis method of carbon concentration surface layer<br>
portion]<br>
Using each of the test pieces (30/25/20 X L300mm),<br>
chips were collected by lathe turning from the surface layer<br>
portion to the 0.05 mm depth of its 25 mm portion, and the<br>
carbon concentration of the surface layer portion was<br>
determined by a chemical analysis.<br>
[0040] From Table 3, the Test Piece No. 2 series indicate<br>
effects on the precipitation form of carbide and others when<br>
the secondary treatment temperature was varied, and the Test<br>
Pieces No. 5 and No. 7 series indicate effects on the<br>
precipitation of ultrafine carbide and the final carbon<br>
concentrations in the surface layer portions depending on<br>
whether or not the additional carburizing was applied in<br>
the secondary treatment.<br>
[0041]      Concerning the secondary treatment temperature<br>
(which may hereinafter be called "the additional carburizing<br>
temperature"), the temperature of 900°C employed for Test<br>
Piece No. 2-1 involves a problem in that the carbide in a<br>
surface layer portion dissolves to lead to a reduction in<br>
the overall precipitation of carbide grains and also to an<br>
increase in the radial runout of the test piece. With the<br>
secondary treatment temperature of 800°C employed for Test<br>
PieceNo. 2-3, carbide flakes precipitate at grainboundaries<br>
in the surface layer portion, and the core portion of the<br>
member is quenched incomplete. Test pieces, therefore,<br><br>
27<br>
develop variations in radial runout. From these results,<br>
the optimal temperature for the treatment that causes<br>
ultrafine carbide to precipitate in a surface layer portion<br>
by the secondary treatment can preferably be a temperature<br>
equivalent to the A3 transformation temperature + 10-70°C,<br>
which is determined by the composition of the member (before<br>
the carburizing treatment).<br>
[0042]      As to whether or not the additional carburizing<br>
treatment is applied in the secondary treatment, the<br>
application of the additional carburizing treatment has been<br>
recognized, as evident from the results of Test Piece Nos.<br>
5-1 and 7-1, to bring about the advantageous effect that<br>
carbide precipitates in an ultrafine form, to say nothing<br>
of an improvement in the concentration of carbon in the<br>
surface layer portion. As a reason for the advantageous<br>
effect, it may be contemplated that, as the carbon in the<br>
surface layer portion precipitate as carbide and the<br>
concentration of carbon in the matrix becomes lean, the<br>
replenishment of carbon to the surface layer portion by the<br>
additional carburizing could promote the new formation of<br>
ultraf ine carbide, such as Fe3C and M23C6, and nuclei thereof.<br>
[0043]      As shown in FIG. 4, it has also been found that in<br>
themember subjected to the additional carburizing treatment,<br>
the austenite grain size of the outermost surface layer<br>
portion is reduced to an ultrafine grain size. The term<br>
"ultrafine grain size" corresponds to an austenite grain<br><br>
28<br>
size of No. 10 or greater as measured by the carburized<br>
grain-size testing method in JIS-G0551, "Method of Testing<br>
Austenite Grain Size for Steel". A significant<br>
characteristic feature has also been discovered in that a<br>
three-layer structure formed of fine grains and ultrafine<br>
grains is formed extending toward the inside.  Paying<br>
attention to a relationship between the austenite grain size<br>
and the carburized layer, the grain sizes of the outermost<br>
surface layer portion greatest in the amount of precipitated<br>
ultrafine carbide, the carburized layer portion (fine grain<br>
portion) located inside the outermost surface layer portion<br>
and the ultrafine grain portion located still inside the<br>
fine grain portion are in a relationship of A&gt;C&gt;B, in which<br>
"A", "C" and"B" stand for the outermost surface layer portion,<br>
the ultrafine grain portion and the fine grain portion,<br>
respectively.  Incidentally, the austenite grain size of<br>
a surface layer portion in conventional carburizing is<br>
generally equivalent to No. 7 or 8 .  In the present invention,<br>
the surface layer portion has a grain structure of the<br>
characteristic three-layer structure which does not appear<br>
in the conventional carburizing treatment.<br>
[0044] As an advantageous effect of such an ultrafine grain<br>
layer, it has a significant characteristic feature in that<br>
the toughness of a hardened surface layer, said toughness<br>
having been a concern about conventional carburized members,<br>
can be improved and high toughness can also be imparted to<br><br>
29<br>
the carburized layer itself in addition to the feasibility<br>
of higher contact pressure as a characteristic feature of<br>
the present invention, and therefore, is extremely effective<br>
for providing carburized members with still higher strength<br>
from now on.<br>
[0045]      Table 4 shows effects of the percentage of an effective<br>
case depth of a carbide layer precipitated in super<br>
carburizing according to the present invention on various<br>
properties. Various test pieces were prepared by providing<br>
SCM420, JIS steel for machine structure, as a material,<br>
subjecting the material to normalizing treatment at 900°C<br>
beforehand, and then machining the resultant material. The<br>
super carburizing of each test piece was conducted by the<br>
heat cycle of primary treatment and secondary treatment shown<br>
in FIG. 3. Each treated test piece was analyzed and<br>
investigated for pitting life, impact strength, distortion<br>
by heat treatment, etc. Concerning effects of the carbon<br>
concentration of the outermost surface layer portion of each<br>
test piece shown in Table 5, the test piece was treated by<br>
the heat cycle shown in FIG. 3 in a similar manner as the<br>
various test pieces in Table 4, and the carbon concentration<br>
and the like of the treated test piece were investigated.<br>
[0046] The adjustment of the precipitation depth of carbide<br>
in Table 4 was effected primarily by the control or the like<br>
of the carburizing time and carbon concentration, and the<br>
adjustment of the carbon concentration of the outermost<br><br>
30<br>
surface layer portion in Table 5 was effected by controlling<br>
the process gas flow, treatment time and the like upon<br>
repeating carburizing and diffusion in the primary treatment<br>
and secondary treatment in accordance With a program<br>
calculated beforehand.  Process gases for low-pressure<br>
carburizing include propane, acetylene, ethylene and the<br>
like. Among these, most popular and economical propane was<br>
used. As an inert gas upon diffusion, on the other hand,<br>
nitrogen gas was used.  Further, the rapid quenching in the<br>
secondary treatment was conducted by oil. As an alternative,<br>
the rapid quenching can also be conducted by high pressure<br>
gas which makes sole or mixed use of gases such as N2, He<br>
and H2.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
33<br>
[0049] 1) The percentage of effective case depth indicates the ratio<br>
(t/T) of the depth (t) of an ultrafine carbide layer to<br>
a case depth (T) of 550 HMV or greater in terms of<br>
micro-Vickers hardness.<br>
2)	The rolling fatigue life indicates the number of<br>
repetitions of rotation until occurrence of pitting under<br>
the below-described conditions.<br>
Contact pressure: 3 GPa, rotation speed: 1,500 rpm,<br>
slipping ratio: -40%, oil temperature: 80°C.<br>
3)	The impact strength indicates destructive energy as<br>
measured using a Charpy test piece.<br>
4)	The roundness indicates the amount of a deformation of<br>
the inner diameter of a ring in the X-Y direction as<br>
measured by a profile measuring instrument while using<br>
as the ring a test piece in a ring form of 100 (80)<br>
X15t.<br>
[0050] A description will now be made about effects of the<br>
percentage of effective case depth on the rolling fatigue<br>
life. When an ultrafine carbide layer was as shallow as<br>
5% in terms of the percentage of effective case depth as<br>
in the comparative example represented by the sign A, it<br>
is considered that the amount of precipitated ultrafine<br>
carbide itself was small and therefore, that the treated<br>
test piece did not have temper softening resistance, which<br>
is characteristic to super carburizing, and was low in<br>
pitting toughness.  In the case of the comparative example<br><br>
34<br>
represented by the sign E in which the percentage of effective<br>
case depth was 40%, the high hardness range was broadened,<br>
resulting in a problem that the impact strength was reduced,<br>
and with respect to a deformation by heat treatment as<br>
determined in terms of roundness, there was also a tendency<br>
toward increased distortion.  From these results, the<br>
percentage of effective hardened depth in a precipitated<br>
carbide layer is optimally in a range of from 10 to 30%.<br>
[0051]      A description will next be made about effects of the<br>
carbon concentration of the outermost surface layer portion<br>
shown in Table 5 on the pitting life.  It is considered that<br>
the signs H, J and K, in each of which the carbon concentration<br>
of the outermost surface layer portion was high, were<br>
superior in pitting life and that in the cases of the signs<br>
G and I in each of which the carbon concentration was 1%,<br>
that is, lower compared with the former signs, they were<br>
somewhat inferior in pitting life. When the carbon<br>
concentration of the outermost surface layer portion is lower<br>
than 0. 8 wt. % as in the sign F shown as a referential example,<br>
the test piece was significantly inferior in pitting<br>
toughness. Namely, the greater the amount of ultrafine<br>
carbide precipitated in the outermost surface layer portion<br>
and the higher the carbon concentration of the outermost<br>
surface layer portion, the better the pitting life.<br>
Accordingly, the carbon concentration of super carburizing<br>
can be set preferably at 0.8 wt. % or higher in the present<br><br>
35<br>
invention.<br>
[0052] Regarding the upper limit to the carbon concentration<br>
through carburizing, no particular problem arose up to 2.0<br>
wt. % . An increase in carbon concentration to a still higher<br>
level in excess of 2.0 wt.% involves a potential concern<br>
that precipitation of carbide flakes may be facilitated and<br>
the impact strength and deformation by heat treatment of<br>
the test piece may tend to become disadvantageous. It is,<br>
therefore, necessary to set the carbon concentration of the<br>
outermost surface layer portion at a level commensurate with<br>
properties required for the member (test piece).<br>
[0053] A description will next be made about effects of the<br>
additional carburizing treatment in the secondary treatment<br>
in the signs I, J and K on the pitching life, impact strength<br>
and deformation (strain) by heat treatment. Compared with<br>
the signs G and H in each of which the carbon concentrations<br>
was similar but the additional carburizing was not applied,<br>
the signs I, J and K varied less in all the properties and<br>
were better. As a reason for this advantage, it can be<br>
contemplated that the additional carburizing treatment may<br>
stabilize the carbon concentration of the matrix and may<br>
also promote the formation of ultrafine carbide in the<br>
outermost surface layer portion, the carburized layer itself<br>
may be converted into a dense and well-balanced structure,<br>
and the quality available through the heat treatment may<br>
be thoroughly stabilized.<br><br>
36<br>
[0054] From the above-described various analysis results,<br>
it is desired, as optimal treatment conditions in the process<br>
of the present invention, to employ machine structural steel<br>
as a member, to conduct super carburizing as a combination<br>
of the primary treatment and the secondary treatment in<br>
low-pressure carburizing facilities to treat the member<br>
under optimal heating and cooling conditions, and then to<br>
control the final step such that the depth of precipitated<br>
carbide falls within the range of from 10 to 30% in terms<br>
of the percentage of effective case depth and the carbon<br>
concentration of the surface layer becomes 0.8 wt.% or<br>
higher.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0055] As appreciated from the above-described series of<br>
results, the present invention can provide an absolutely<br>
novel, super carburized, low-distortion quenched member<br>
and its production process. According to the present<br>
invention, machine structural members such as gears and<br>
axle members can be provided with higher strength and<br>
can be used under higher contact pressure, thereby making<br>
it possible to materialize with low distortion the needs<br>
for various members of higher strength, higher performance,<br>
lighter weight and smaller size, such as members required<br>
to have low distortion, rotary sliding or reciprocal<br>
sliding members equipped with bearing structures, and<br><br>
37<br>
members required to have high contact fatigue resistance<br>
and high abrasion resistance under high contact pressure.<br>
