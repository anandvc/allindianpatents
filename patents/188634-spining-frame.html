				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a spinning frame according to the preamble of the independent claim.<br>
In spinning frames with a drafting system and a device to initiate turning and winding normally a yarn guide is installed between the drafting system and the device, which concentrates the yarn movement to a point in the extension of the axis of the device for the winding. Such an arrangement is for instance shown in the American patent No. 4,332,059. In said example the mentioned device consists of a rotating spindle and a ring-traveller-combination, which is arranged coaxially with the spindle. If the yarn guide can be moved together with the ring in axial direction of the spindle, spinning can be carried out with more or less constant yarn tension, since the yarn balloon between the ring and the yarn guide does not change.<br>
When increasing the capacity of spinning frames of the above defined type, it is noticed, that in particular when manufacturing so  called soft-twisted yarns with a relatively low revolution coefficient, more yarn breaks occur, if a certain spindle speed is exceeded.<br>
It is the object of the present invention, to design a spinning frame, which also allows high operating speeds for soft-twisted yarns.<br>
The task as an object of the invention with a spinning frame is solved according to the features of the independent claim. The dependent claims relate to favourable further developments.<br>
The invention is based on the observation that when arranging a yarn guide that determines the balloon vertex between the spindle and the drafting system, at a greater distance from said yarn guide, enforcing the turning onto the yarn, then a retention of said turning is caused at the yarn guide, so that in the yarn portion between the drafting system and the yarn guide a lower coefficient of twisting prevails than in the yarn<br><br>
portion after the yam guide. This results in the fact that the tension force in the yam between the yam guide and the drafting system can be near its point of maximum, load of the yam, which, under unfavourable conditions can cause yam breakage. The reduction of the distance between the drafting system and the spindle is necessary, so that the yam balloon at the beginning of the winding process of the spindle is not too large, which could result in an unacceptably high tension.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning frame comprising a device to initiate turning and winding, a spindle and a drafting system with several rollers characterized in that the spindle is placed below the delivery side of the roller of the drafting system in such a way, that the axis of the spindle is at a distance (A) of 3 mm maximum from a tangent (T), parallel to axis, the said tangent being laid onto the roller which is in a rectangular position to the spindle, so that the winding zone (B) on spindle reaches up to a minimum space (H) in the range of 50 to 70 mm to the clamping point (P) between the roller and an opposite pressure roller, and that the angle p between the axis and the fibre flow in the drafting system is between 30° and 50°.<br>
In the following the invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which ;<br>
Fig. 1	is a detail view of a part of the drafting system and the spindle;<br>
Fig. 2	is a schematic  partial view  of a  ring  spinning frame  in<br>
lengthwise direction;<br><br>
Fig. 2a        is a detail of the spindle with a bobbin, the spindle drive and the<br>
yarn guide from the drafting system to the bobbin.<br>
Fig. 3	is a changed embodiment in comparisons to fig. 2<br>
In fig. 1 the spindle 22 with axis 21 and a bobbin 24 mounted on to it are illustrated. The yam 6 wound onto the spindle 22 i.e. bobbin 24 forms a yarn winding 7, which extends along a winding zone B. For the winding process of the spindle 22, the device 20 is provided with a ring rail 28, a ring 28J and a traveller 283. The spindie 22 and the device 20 are arranged in such a way that the winding zone B reaches up to a distance H = 50 to 70 mm to the so called clamping point P between a roller 33 and an opposite roll 33a on the discharge side of the drafting system 30. The drafting system 30 includes further rollers of which only roller 32 with its opposite roll 32a is shown. The latter are enclosed by belt 31 to guide the roving 5. By means of the guide elements 35, the belts are lead as close as possible to the roller 33. At the entering side of the roller 33 i.e. the roll 33a a condenser 36 can be arranged, which is of funnel shape and which concentrates the fibre flow. The axis 21 of the spindle 22 can be at a maximum distance A =<br><br>
3 mm from a tangent T parallel to the axis of the roller 33. From fig, 1 it is clear that the axis of the roller 33 and the axis 21 of the spindle 22 are rectangular towards each other. The yarn 6 rotating around axis 21 forms a so called yarn balloon between the roller 33 and the traveller 283. The balloon vertex is on tangent T: balloon limiting ring 29 can be provided in order to limit the diameter of the balloon, if the ring rail 28 is at a greater distance to the roller 33.<br>
While during conventional spinning with a common yarn guide, a so called pig tail guide, for instance with carded cotton, 20 tex, spinning is only possible down to a twisting coefficient of a = 100, with an arrangement according to the invention a minimal twisting coefficient a between 80 and 90 is reached. The spinning of yarns with softer twisting thus can be achieved at higher spindle speeds. For the spinning of short fibres it is recommended to arrange a condensers 36 at the upstream side of the roller 33 according to fig. 1, with said arrangement, better values of resistance and higher evenness in the spun yarn can be achieved.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the major parts of a spinning frame in the same view as in fig. 1 looking in the lengthwise direction of the frame. The spinning frame 1 is supported, by means of a frame 10 on feet 12, a creel 4 in which the sliver feed is located. In the present case the roving 5 is wound onto roving bobbin 3, which is drawn off by way of the drafting system 30. The upper part of the drafting system 30 consists of the so called loading device 34, with the top rollers 32a,33a according to fig. 1 which are pressed against the bottom rollers 32,33 below of them. Within the zone of the drafting system, the roving 5 is guided preferably at an angle β = 30...50° to the vertical, that means to the axis 21 of the spindle 22. Below the drafting system 30 a suction tube 62 is arranged for each spinning unit, said tube leading into a channel 64. The device 20 to initiate the turning and the winding includes, according to fig. 2 i.e. 3 a ring rail 28 with a support 28a, furthermore the spindle 22 with tube 24, whereby the spindle is mounted onto the spindle rail 23. It is fastened pivotably in the bearing 25 on the<br><br>
frame 10. A shifting device 27 is provided for the pivotable movement, consisting according to fig. 2 of a cylinder with a piston, whereby the shifting device at one end is hinged to the frame 10 and at the other end to the spindle rail 23. To drive the spindle 22 a conventional spindle drive 26, consisting of a belt pulley 261, a belt 262 and a tensional 263 can be provided. The belt 262 encloses the lower end of the spindle 22 slightly above spindle rail 23. The tensioner 263 is pretension by a spring and keeps the belt tight. When pivoting the spindle rail 23 by means of the shifting device 27 the tensioner 263 compensates the displacement of the belt 262. Pivoting of the spindle rail 23 is necessary in view of the doffing of the wound bobbins 23 from the spindles 22, since the space between the upper edge of the bobbin 24 and the drafting system 30 would be too small otherwise. After pivoting the spindle rail 23, so that the spindles 22 coincide with axis 21a, the doffing device 50 can start its function. It basically consists of a number of pivotable arms 56 arranged along the spinning frame, with grippers 54 being mounted at their ends for the bobbins 24. By pivoting the lifting device around the bearing support 52 as well as lateral to it, the wound bobbins 24 can be lowered to the transport device 40. It includes a rail 42 with peg trays 44, which are moved by a conveying means 4 6 in the longitudinal direction of the spinning frame 1. By means of the transport device 40 empty bobbin tubes 24 are moved below the spindles 22 and wound bobbins 2 4 are moved away. Since the ring rail 28 moves along the spindle axis 21, a guide i.e. guide rod 232 is necessary which is mounted onto support 231 and which is connected with the spindle rail 23. Likewise on the same guide rod 232 a balloon limiting ring 29 can be moved by means of the support 29a. This is of advantage while the upper range of the winding zone B of the bobbin 24 is wound with yarn 6. The support 28a and the support 29a are to be designed in such a way that the latter is being lifted by the first if spinning takes place in the upper range of the winding zone B. During the winding process a drive 233 with a pulling means 234 provides for the lifting of the ring rail 28 according to the programme in a pilgrim-step motion. To keep yarn tension constant, in particular in the upper range of the<br><br>
winding zone B, it is recommended to increase the spindle speed, since the yarn balloon becomes smaller and smaller at this stage of the process; this applies for the case of the stationary spindle.<br>
An alternative to the concept according to fig. 2 is shown in fig. 3. The supports 28a for the ring rail 28 and the support 29a for the balloon limiting ring 29 are fixedly supported on the frame 10 of the spinning frame. The relative movement between the spindle 22 and the ring rail 28 is carried out by a shifting device 27 according to fig. 3, as indicated with a shaft 271 and a pair of worm gear, whereby the worm gear is mounted on  a vertically arranged spindle 272. The spindle 272 is provided with a thread, on which bushings 273 vertically move the spindle drive 26 with spindle 22 according to fig. 3. The shifting device 27 and the spindle 272, as shown in fig. 3, are stationarily mounted onto the frame 10. For the embodiment according to fig. 3 it is suitable to provide the spindle drive motor 26 for instance with a single drive or with a tangential belt. If the spindle rail 23 is moved from the spinning position into its most distant position from the drafting system 30, a conventional doffer i.e. a conventional lifting device 50 according to fig. 2 for doffing of the wound bobbins 2 4 from spindle 22 can be arranged. With a spinning frame according to the invention not only the aforementioned textile technological advantages, in connection with a relatively small yarn balloon and thus with the resulting better spinning stability arise, but furthermore advantages such as higher capacity of the frame and a lower construction height do result. The advantages justify the extra cost for the additionally necessary lifting device 27, depending on the type of embodiment.<br><br><br>
