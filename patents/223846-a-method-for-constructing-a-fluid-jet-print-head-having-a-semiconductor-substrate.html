				<td>DIRECT IMAGING POLYMER FLUID JET ORIFICE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention generally relates to thermal inkjet printing. More particularly,<br>
this invention relates to the apparatus and process of manufacturing precise polymer<br>
orifices comprising epoxy, polyimide or other negative acting photoresist material<br>
using direct imaging techniques.<br>
Thermal inkjet printers typically have a printhead mounted on a carriage that<br>
traverses back and forth across the width of the paper or other medium feeding<br>
through the printer. The printhead includes an array of orifices (also called nozzles)<br>
which face the paper. Ink (or another fluid) filled channels feed the orifices with ink<br>
from a reservoir ink source. Applied individually to addressable energy dissipation<br>
elements (such as resistors), energy heats the ink within the orifices causing the ink to<br>
bubble and thus expel ink out of the orifice toward the paper. Those skilled in the art<br>
will appreciate that other methods of transferring energy to the ink or fluid exist and<br>
still fall within the spirit, scope and principle of the present invention. As the ink is<br>
expelled, the bubble collapses and more ink fills the channels from the reservoir,<br>
allowing for repetition of the ink expulsion.<br>
Current designs of inkjet printheads have problems in their manufacturing,<br>
operating life and accuracy in directing the ink onto the paper. Printheads currently<br>
produced comprise an inkfeed slot through a substrate, a barrier interface (The barrier<br>
interface channels the ink to the resistor and defines the firing chamber volume. The<br>
barrier interface material is a thick, photosensitive material that is laminated onto the<br>
substrate, exposed, developed, and cured.), and an orifice plate (The orifice plate is<br>
the exit path of the firing chamber that was defined by the barrier interface. The<br>
orifice plate is typically electroformed with nickel (Ni) and then coated with gold<br>
(Au), palladium (Pd), or other precious metals for corrosion resistance. The thickness<br>
of the orifice plate and the orifice opening diameter are controlled to allow repeatable<br>
drop ejection when tiring.). During manufacturing, aligning the orifice plate to the<br>
substrate with barrier interface material requires special precision and special<br>
adhesives to attach it. If the orifice plate is warped or if the adhesive does not<br>
correctly bond the orifice plate to the barrier interface, poor control of the ink drop<br>
trajectory results and the yield or life of the printhead is reduced. If the alignment of<br>
the printhead is incorrect or the orifice plate is dimpled (non-uniform in its<br>
planarization), the ink will be ejected away from its proper trajectory and the image<br>
quality of the printout is reduced. Because the orifice plate is a-separate piece in<br>
conventionally constructed printheads, the thickness required to prevent warping or<br>
buckling during manufacturing requires the height (related to thickness of the orifice<br>
plate) of the orifice bore to be higher than necessary for thermal efficiency. Usually, a<br>
single orifice plate is attached to a single printhead die on a semiconductor wafer that<br>
contains many printheads. It is desirable to have a process that allows for placement<br>
of the orifice plates all at once across an entire semiconductor wafer to increase<br>
productivity as well as ensure accuracy of orifice placement.<br>
The ink within the firing chamber fills the orifice bore up to the external edges<br>
of the orifice plate. Thus, another problem with this increased height of ink in the<br>
orifice bore is that it requires more energy to eject the ink. Additonally, high quality<br>
photo printing requires higher resolutions and thus smaller drops of ink. Therefore, a<br>
need for a thinner orifice plate that is manufacturable exists. Furthermore, as the<br>
quantity of ink expelled in each drop becomes smaller, more orifices are required<br>
within the printhead to create a given pattern in a single passing of the printhead over<br>
the print medium at a fixed print speed. To prevent the printhead from overheating<br>
due to the increased number of orifices, the amount of energy used per orifice must be<br>
reduced.<br>
Additionally, in the past, the lifetime of the printhead was adequate. The<br>
printhead was part of a disposable pen that was replaced after the ink supply ran out.<br>
However, user expectations for quality are driving the need to have a low cost, long<br>
life printhead with multiyear permanence and the present invention helps fulfill this<br>
expectation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A process for creating and an apparatus employing shaped orifices in a<br>
semiconductor substrate is described. A first layer of material is applied on the<br>
semiconductor substrate then a second layer of material is then applied upon the first<br>
layer of material. An orifice image is then transferred to the first layer of material and<br>
a fluid-well image is transferred to the second layer of material. That portion of the<br>
second layer of material where the orifice image is located is then developed along<br>
with that portion of the first layer of material where the fluid well is located to define<br>
an orifice in the substrate.<br>
The volume of the orifice chamber is defined by the orifice image shape and<br>
the thickness of the second layer of material. The volume of the fluid-well chamber is<br>
defined by the fluid-well image shape and the thickness of the first layer of material.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED AND ALTERNATE<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention relates to a novel polymer orifice fabrication process that creates<br>
a multi-material sandwich of photoimagable layers over the substrate and that does<br>
not require a Ni orifice plate or barrier interface material. Each photoimagable layer<br>
has different rate of cross-linking for a given intensity of energy. Additionally, the<br>
invention encompasses a design topology using the photoimagable layers that<br>
produces a top-hat shaped reentrant (directed inwards) profile orifice. The top-hat<br>
orifice can be tailored by varying process parameters to optimize drop ejection<br>
characteristics. This top-hat design topology offers several advantages over straight<br>
walled or linear tapered architectures. The top-hat shaped reentrant orifice chamber,<br>
which ejects the fluid drops, is easily defined by a fluid-well chamber and an orifice<br>
chamber. The area and shape of each chamber, as viewed looking into the orifice, is<br>
defined by using a patterned mask or set of masks. The masks allow for controlling<br>
the entrance diameter, exit diameter and firing chamber volume based on the orifice<br>
layer thickness or height. The height of the orifice chamber and the height of the<br>
fluid-well chamber are independently controlled to allow for optimum process<br>
stability and design latitude. By controlling the shape, area and height of the orifice<br>
and fluid-well chambers, the designer can control the drop size, drop shape, and<br>
dampen the effect of the blowback (that part of the bubble which expels the ink that<br>
expands opposite to the direction of drop ejection) and to some extent the refill speed<br>
(the time required to have ink fill the entire top-hat orifice structure). In addition, this<br>
top-hat topology allows the fluid feed slots, which deliver fluid to the orifice, to be<br>
placed further away from the energy dissipation element used to eject the fluid to<br>
reduce the possibility of the bubble entering the fluid supply path and thus creating a<br>
blockage.<br>
The direct imaging polymer orifice normally comprises two or more layers of<br>
negative acting photoresist materials with slightly different dissolution rates. The<br>
dissolution rates are based on the different materials of each layer having a different<br>
molecular weight, physical composition, or optical density. In an exemplary process<br>
using two layers, a "slow" photoresist that requires 500mJoules/cm2 intensity of<br>
electromagnetic energy for cross-linking is applied on a substrate. In an fluid-jet<br>
printhead this substrate is comprised of a semiconductor material that has had a stack<br>
of thin-film layers applied to its surface. A "fast" photoresist that requires just 100<br>
mJoules/cm2 intensity of electromagnetic energy for cross-linking is applied on the<br>
layer of slow photoresist. After curing, the substrate photoresist layers are exposed<br>
through a mask at a very high intensity of at least 500 mJoules/cm2 to define the fluid-<br>
well chamber. The intensity is high enough to cross-link both the top and lower<br>
layers. The substrate photoresist layers are then exposed through another mask with<br>
low intensity electromagnetic energy of 100 mJoules/cm2 to define the orifice<br>
chamber. It is important that the intensity of the second exposure below enough so<br>
the lower orifice layer of slow photoresist that is beneath the orifice opening is not<br>
cross-linked.<br>
Polymer material is well known in the IC industry for its ability to planarize<br>
over thin-film topographies, Empirical data shows that orifice plate topography<br>
variation canbe kept well within t micron. This feature is important to provide a<br>
consistent drop trajectory.<br>
In addition, many different polymer materials having negative acting<br>
photoresist properties exist. Exemplary polymer materials are polyimide, epoxy,<br>
polybenzoxazoles, benzocyclobutene, and sol gels. Those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that other negative acting photoresist polymer materials exist and still fall<br>
within the spirit and scope of the invention. By adding optical dye (such as Orange<br>
#3, ~2% weight) to transparent polymer material, a slow photoresist can be made from<br>
fast photoresist that has no dye or a small amount of dye. Another embodiment would<br>
be to coat a layer of polymer material with a thin layer of dye. Alternative methods<br>
to create slow photoresist comprise mixing polymers with different molecular<br>
weights, with different wavelength absorption characteristics, with different<br>
developing rates, and using pigments. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
other methods to slow the photosensitivity of polymers exist and still fall within the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Fig. 1A illustrates the top view of a single orifice 42 (also called a nozzle or a<br>
hole) using the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Top orifice layer 34 is<br>
comprised of fast cross-linking polymer such as photoimagable epoxy (such as SU8<br>
developed by IBM) or photoimagable polymer (such as OCG, commonly known in<br>
the art). The top orifice layer 34 is used to define the shape and height of the orifice<br>
42 opening. Hidden within the orifice layer are fluid feed slots 30 and a fluid-well 43.<br>
Fluid, such as ink, flows into the fluid-well 43 through the fluid feed slots 30 and is<br>
heated by energy dissipation element 32 forming a fluid vapor bubble that forcibly<br>
ejects the remaining fluid from the orifice 42. View AA shows the direction of<br>
observation for the cross-sectional views in later figures.<br>
Fig. 1B is an isometric cross-sectional view of the single orifice shown in Fig.<br>
1A of a fully integrated thermal (FIT) fluid jet printhead. Lower orifice layer 35 is<br>
applied on top of a stack of thin-film layers 50, which have been processed by<br>
individual layers and incorporated onto the surface of a semiconductor substrate 20.<br>
An examplary orifice would have an orifice 42 diameter of 16 urn, a fluid-well 43<br>
length of 42 µm, a fluid-well 43 width of 20 µm, a top orifice layer 34 thickness of 6<br>
urn, and a lower orifice layer 35 thickness of 6 µm. Semiconductor substrate 20 is<br>
etched after the stack of thin-film layers 50 have been applied to provide fluid feed<br>
channel 44, which supplies fluid to the fluid feed slots 30 (not shown). Fluid feed<br>
slots 30 are defined within the stack of thin-film layers 50.<br>
Figs. 2A through 2H illustrate the various process steps used to create<br>
alternative embodiments of the invention. Fig. 2A illustrates semiconductor substrate<br>
20 after it has been processed to incorporate the stack of thin-film layers 50, which<br>
includes energy dissipation element 32. The stack of thin-film layers 50 has been<br>
processed such that fluid feed slots 30 extend through its entire thickness.<br>
Fig. 2B illustrates the semiconductor substrate 20 after the lower orifice layer<br>
35, comprised of a slow cross-linking polymer, is applied on top of the stack of thin-<br>
film layers 50. The slow cross-linking polymer is applied using a conventional spin-<br>
coating tool such as those manufactured by Karl Suss KG. The spin-coating process<br>
associated with the spin-coating tool allows for a planar surface to be formed as the<br>
slow cross-linking polymer 35 fills the fluid feed slots 30 and the surface of stack of<br>
thin-film layers 50. An examplary process for spin coating is to spread a layer of<br>
resist on a semiconductor wafer with the spin coating tool set to 70 rpm with an<br>
acceleration of 100 rpm/s and a spread time of 20 secs. The wafer is then stopped<br>
from spinning with a deceleration of 100 rpm/s and rests for 10 secs. The wafer is<br>
then spun at 1060 rpm at an acceleration rate of 300 rpm/s for 30 secs to spread the<br>
resist over the entire wafer. Alternative polymer application processes include roll-<br>
coating, curtain coating, extrusion coating, spray coating, and dip-coating. Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that other methods to apply the polymer layers to the<br>
substrate exist and still fall within the spirit and scope of the invention. The slow<br>
cross-linking polymer is made by mixing optical dye (such as orange #3, ~2% weight)<br>
into either a photoimagable polyimide or photoimagable epoxy transparent polymer<br>
material. By adding the dye, the amount of electromagnetic energy required is greater<br>
than non-dye mixed material to cross-link the material.<br>
Fig. 2C illustrates the result of applying the top orifice layer 34 comprised of a<br>
fast cross-linking polymer on lower orifice layer 35.<br>
Fig. 2D illustrates a strong intensity of electromagnetic radiation 11 being<br>
applied to top orifice layer 34 and lower orifice layer 35. The energy supplied by the<br>
electromagnetic radiation must be sufficient to cross-link both the top orifice layer 34<br>
and lower orifice layer 35 where exposed (shown in Figs. 2D, 2E and 2F as X-out<br>
areas). In an examplary embodiment, this step is done using a SVG Micralign tool set<br>
at 300 mJoules with a focus offset of +9µm. This step defines the shape and area of<br>
the fluid-well 43 in the orifice.<br>
Fig. 2E illustrates the next step of the process in which a lower intensity of<br>
electromagnetic energy 12 is applied to the top orifice layer 34 and lower orifice layer<br>
35. The total energy expended during this step (either by limiting the intensity or time<br>
of exposure or a combination of both) is only sufficient to cross-link the fast cross-<br>
linking polymer in top orifice layer 34. In an examplary embodiment, this step is<br>
done using a SVG Micralign tool set at 60.3 mJoules with a focus offset of +3µm.<br>
This step defines the shape and area of orifice opening 42.<br>
Fig. 2F illustrates the preferred embodiment exposure process. Instead of<br>
using two masks, one to define the fluid-well as in Fig. 2D and one to define an<br>
orifice opening 42 as in Fig. 2E, only one mask is used. This approach reduces the<br>
possible alignment mistakes when using two separate masks. This mask is comprised<br>
of three separate density regions per orifice opening (see Figs. 6A and 6B) forming a<br>
multi-density level mask. One region is essentially non-opaque to the electromagnetic<br>
energy. The second region is partially opaque to the electromagnetic energy. The<br>
third region is completely opaque to the electromagnetic energy.<br>
The first region allows a strong intensity of electromagnetic energy 11 to pass<br>
through the mask to fully cross-link and define the orifice layers where no<br>
photoimagable material is to be removed. Both top orifice layer 34 and lower orifice<br>
layer 35 are cross-linked to prevent removal during developing. The second region is<br>
designed to allow only a lower intensity of electromagnetic energy 12 through to<br>
cross-link the top orifice layer 34 while leaving the material beneath the second region<br>
in lower orifice 35 uncross-linked. The third region (fully opaque) is used to define<br>
the shape and area of the orifice opening 42. Because no electromagnetic energy is<br>
allowed through this third region, the cross-linking polymer beneath the opaque third<br>
region of the mask will not be exposed thus will be removed when developed later.<br>
Fig. 2G illustrates the developing process step where material in the top orifice<br>
layer 34 and lower orifice 35, including the material in fluid-feed slots 30, is removed.<br>
An examplary process is to use a 7110 Solitec developer tool with a 70 sec.<br>
development in NMP @ 1 krpm, and 8 sec mix of IPA &amp; NMP @ 1 krpm, a 10 sec.<br>
rinse with IPA @ 1 krpm, and a 60 second spin @ 2 krpm.<br>
Fig. 2H illustrates the result after a tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide<br>
(TMAH) backside etch process (see U. Schnakenburg, W. Benecke and P Lange,<br>
TMAHW Etchants for Silicon Micromachining, Tech. Dig. 6th Int. Conf. Solid State<br>
Sensors and Actuators (Tranducers '91), San Francisco, CA, USA, June 24-28, 1991<br>
pp. 815-818) is performed to create fluid feed channel 44 which opens into fluid feed<br>
slots 30 to allow fluid to enter fluid-well chamber 43 and ultimately ejected out of<br>
orifice opening 42.<br>
Fig. 3A represents an exemplary printhead 60 which comprises a plurality of<br>
orifice opening 42 found in top orifice layer 34 and lower orifice layer 35. The orifice<br>
layers are applied on a stack of thin-film layers 50, which has been processed on<br>
semiconductor substrate 20.<br>
Fig. 3B illustrates the opposite side of printhead 60 to reveal fluid feed<br>
channels 44 and fluid feed slots 30.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a print cartridge 100, which<br>
uses printhead 60. Such a print cartridge could be similar to HP51626A available<br>
from Hewlett-Packard Co. Printhead 60 is bonded onto a flex-circuit 106 that couples<br>
control signals from electrical contacts 102 to the printhead 60. Fluid is held in the<br>
fluid reservoir 104, which comprises a fluid delivery assemblage of which an<br>
exemplary type, a sponge 108 and standpipe (not shown), is exhibited. The fluid is<br>
stored in sponge 108 and delivered to printhead 60 through the standpipe.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates an exemplary liquid jet recording apparatus 200, similar to a<br>
Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 340 (C 2655 A) using the print cartridge 100 of Fig. 4.<br>
Medium 230 (such as paper) is taken from the medium tray 210 and conveyed along<br>
its length across the print cartridge 100 by the medium feed mechanism 260. The<br>
print cartridge 100 is conveyed along the width of the medium 230 on a carriage<br>
assemblage 240. Medium feed mechanism 260 and carriage assembly 240 together<br>
form a conveyance assemblage for transporting the medium 230. When the medium<br>
230 has been recorded onto, it is ejected on medium output tray 220.<br>
Fig. 6A illustrate a single multi-density level mask 140; this is used to form<br>
the orifice opening 42 in an alternative embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
opaque area 142 is used to define the shape and area of the orifice opening 42.<br>
Partially opaque area 144 is used to define the shape and area of the fluid-well. Non-<br>
opaque area 146 is essentially transparent to the electromagnetic energy and this area<br>
of the mask defines those areas of the top orifice layer 34 and lower orifice layer 35<br>
which will be cross-linked and not removed when developed. The shape of opaque<br>
area 142 matches the geometric shape of partially opaque area 144 in order to<br>
optimize the developing process.<br>
Fig. 6B illustrates the preferred embodiment of the single multi-density level<br>
mask 150 in which the geometric shape of the opaque area 152 is different from the<br>
geometric shape of the partially opaque area 154. This technique is allowed due to the<br>
direct imaging method that allows for separate definition of the fluid-well shape and<br>
orifice opening shape. This technique allows for optimal design of the fluid-well to<br>
allow for fast refill rates, bubble blow back percentage and maximum density of<br>
multiple orifices on a printhead. When a fluid drop is exjected from an orifice, the<br>
drop has a main body shape and a trailing tail, which combined form the drop volume.<br>
The direct imaging method allows for the optimal design of orifice opening 42 to<br>
provide the proper volume of fluid ejected, the tail design of the ejected fluid and<br>
shape of the fluid as it exits the orifice, which allows for minimizing breakup of the<br>
fluid on its flight path to the medium. Non-opaque area 156 is essentially transparent<br>
to the electromagnetic energy and this area of the mask defines those areas of the top<br>
orifice layer 34 and lower orifice layer 35 which will be cross-linked and not removed<br>
when developed. In this embodiment, an examplary mask would have a transmisivity<br>
for non-opaque area 156 of essentially 100%, a transmisivity for partially opaque area<br>
154 is essentially 20%, and the transmisivity for opaque area 152 is essentially 0%.<br>
The ability to have different shapes allows for the fluid feed slots 30 to be<br>
placed further away from the energy dissipation element 32 to reduce the possibility<br>
of gulping the blowback of the bubble thus limiting air injection in through the orifice.<br>
Furthermore, due to the ability to control the thickness of both the lower<br>
orifice layer 35 and the upper orifice layer 34 with the ability to control the individual<br>
shapes of the fluid-well and orifice opening, a general design for an orifice<br>
architecture can be accomplished.<br>
Fig. 7A illustrates the top view of the preferred orifice architecture. Orifice<br>
opening 174 is a circular shape and fluid-well 172 is of a rectangular shape. Fig. 7B<br>
illustrates the side view of the orifice as seen through the BB perspective of Fig. 7A.<br>
The top orifice layer 168 has a top orifice height 162, which along with the area of<br>
orifice opening 174 determines the volume of orifice chamber 176. The lower orifice<br>
layer 170 has a lower orifice height 164, which along with the area of fluid-well 172<br>
determine the volume of the fluid-well chamber 180. The total orifice height 166 is<br>
the sum of both top orifice height 162 and lower orifice height 164. The ratio of the<br>
lower orifice height 164 to the upper orifice height 162 defines a critical parameter,<br>
the height ratio, where:<br>
he ight _ ratio = lower _ orifice _ height / top _ orifice _ height.<br>
This height ratio controls both the overshoot volume of the ejected drop, related to the<br>
length of its trailing tail, and the refill time, the time required for refilling the orifice<br>
with fluid after fluid ejection.<br>
Fig. 8 is a graph that illustrates the effect of the height ratio vs. the refill time<br>
and the height ratio vs. the overshoot volume for an examplary orifice diameter of 16<br>
µm and a fluid-well length of 42 µm and width of 20 µm. Using this graph would<br>
allow the designer of a printhead to choose the layer thickness for a desired ejected<br>
drop shape.<br>
Figs. 9A to 9E illustrate the steps of an alternate embodiment of the invention<br>
which uses a single layer of slow cross-linking polymer and employs an<br>
underexposure and an overexposure of electromagnetic energy to the slow cross-<br>
linking polymer material as a method to form the separate layers.<br>
Fig. 9A illustrates a processed semiconductor substrate 20 which has a stack of<br>
thin-film layers 50 applied on it, which contain energy dissipation element 32 and<br>
fluid feed slots 30.<br>
Fig. 9B illustrates the application of a layer of slow cross-linked material 34<br>
on the stack of thin-film layers 50 and fills in fluid feed slots 30.<br>
Fig. 9C illustrates the exposure of the layer of slow cross-linking polymer 34<br>
with a low dosage of electromagnetic energy 12 to define the orifice opening. The<br>
exposure dosage is just enough to underexpose and cross-link the slow cross-linking<br>
polymer to a desired depth. An examplary exposure would be 60.3 mJoules.<br>
Fig. 9D illustrates the exposure of the layer of slow cross-linking polymer 34<br>
with a high dosage sufficient to overexpose and cross-link all of the layer of slow<br>
cross-linking polymer 34 with a high dosage sufficient to cross-link all of the layer of<br>
slow cross-linking polymer 34 except where the fluid-well chamber is to exist. An<br>
examplary exposure would be 300 mJoules.<br>
Fig. 9E illustrates an alternate process step to that used in Figs. 9C and 9D<br>
using a single mask having multi-density levels to allow different dosages of<br>
electromagnetic energy to be exposed to the layer of slow cross-linking polymer 34.<br>
This technique provides for precision alignment of the orifice opening 42 and fluid-<br>
well chamber 43 while also reducing the number of process steps.<br>
Fig. 9F illustrates the developing process in which the non cross-linked<br>
material is removed from the fluid-well chamber and orifice chamber. The orifice<br>
chamber has a slight reentrant taper due to less cross-linking of material in the depth<br>
of layer of slow cross-linking polymer 34 since the dye or other material mixed within<br>
attenuates the electromagnetic energy as it penetrates.<br>
Fig. 9G illustrates the finished result after the backside TMAH etch process to<br>
create fluid feed channel 44 which opens into fluid feed slots 30.<br>
Fig. 10A to Fig. 10E illustrates results of the process steps used to produce the<br>
multi-density level mask used in the single mask fabrication processes to make the<br>
holes in the orifice layer.<br>
Fig. 10A illustrates a quartz substrate 200 that is transparent to the<br>
electromagnetic energy used to expose the photoimagable polymer used to create the<br>
orifice layers. The quartz substrate 200 must be of a suitable optical quality.<br>
Fig. 10B illustrates quartz substrate 200 with a layer of semi-transparent<br>
dielectric material 210 applied on it. Such an exemplary material is ferrous oxide<br>
(FeO2). On the layer of semi-transparent dielectric material 210 is applied a layer of<br>
opaque material 220, an exemplary material being chromium. Both FeO2 and<br>
chromium can be deposited using a conventional e-beam evaporator. A layer of<br>
negative acting photo-resist is applied on the layer of opaque material 220, exposed to<br>
electromagnetic energy and developed to leave a photoresist area 230 which defines<br>
the shape and size of the fluid-well chamber.<br>
Fig. 10C illustrates the result after the quartz substrate 200 has been<br>
conventionally etched. When the opaque material 220 is comprised of chromium,<br>
then an exemplary etch process is a standard KTI chromium etch bath. The quartz<br>
substrate 200 is then subjected to another conventional etch process to remove the<br>
semi-transparent dielectric material 210 forming semi-transparent layer 212. When<br>
FeO2 is used for the semi-transparent dielectric material 210 an exemplary etch<br>
process is a plasman etch using an SF6 or CF4 plasma. The remaining photoresist<br>
230 is then stripped.<br>
In Fig. 10D another layer of photoresist is then applied to the quartz substrate<br>
200, exposed to define the orifice opening shape and area then developed to create<br>
orifice pattern 240.<br>
Fig. 10E illustrates the result after the quartz substrate 200 is processed in an<br>
etch to remove the opaque layer 222 where the orifice pattern 240 is not located<br>
thereby creating the opaque layer orifice opening pattern 224. For an opaque material<br>
that is chromium, an exemplary etch process is a wet chemical etch so that semi-<br>
transparent dielectric layer 212 is not attacked in the etch process.<br>
The direct imaging polymer orifice process is simple, inexpensive, uses<br>
existing equipment and is compatible with current thermal fluid jet technology. It<br>
provides design flexibility and tight orifice dimension control in allowing for<br>
independent control of the orifice and fluid-well geometry. A multi-density level<br>
mask design allows for using a single exposure to provide inherent alignment of the<br>
orifice and fluid-well to improve yields and consistency.<br>
While different reentrant orifice shapes have been shown, other reentrant<br>
shapes are possible using the aforementioned techniques and fall within the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
The invention addresses the need of tighter fluid jet directional control and<br>
smaller drop volume for finer resolution required for vibrant clear photographic<br>
printing. In addition, the invention simplifies manufacturing of the printhead, which<br>
lowers the cost of production, enables high volume run rates and increases the quality,<br>
reliability and consistency of the printheads. The preferred embodiment, and its<br>
alternative embodiments of the invention, demonstrate that unique orifice shapes can<br>
be created to address additional concerns or to take advantage of different properties<br>
of the fluid expelled from the printhead.<br>
