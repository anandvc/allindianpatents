				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The inventive method for pressing articles from powder materials and mould consists in placing powder material in a mould cavity defined by an active and a passive surface of solid or composite shaping elements of the mould, reciprocally moving the forming elements of the mould along the axis of pressing, a pressing force being transferred from the forming elements of the mould towards the powder material by means of active forming surfaces thereof. The surfaces of a powdered article parallel to the axis of pressing are shaped by means of the passive shaping surfaces of the solid or composite forming elements of the mould. During the shaping of the surfaces of a powdered article parallel to the axis of pressing, the parts of at least one passive shaping surface are used, said parts being disposed on the solid or composite shaping elements which are divided along the axis of pressing. Afterwards, the shaping elements of the mould are displaced in such a way that at least one solid surface of the powdered article parallel to the axis of pressing is formed by means of said parts of at least one passive shaping surface, which is divided along the axis of pressing, belonging to different forming elements, said shaping elements being displaced in the opposite directions. The inventive mould for carrying out said method is also disclosed.</td>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A method for pressing articles from powder materials, comprising:<br>
placing a powder material in a shaping cavity of a mold, the cavity being defined by active and passive shaping surfaces of one-piece or composite shaping members of the mold;<br>
mutually moving the shaping members of the mold along a pressing axis, with the pressing force transferred from the shaping members of the mold to the powder material through the active shaping surfaces; and<br>
forming surfaces of the powder article, parallel to the pressing axis, by the passive shaping surfaces of the onepiece or composite shaping members of the mold, characterized in that the forming of surfaces of the powder article, parallel to the pressing axis, comprises using parts of at least one passive shaping surface, located on the one-piece or composite shaping members and split along the pressing axis;<br>
the shaping members of the mold are moved so that at least one continuous surface of the powder article, parallel to the pressing axis, is formed by said parts of at least one passive shaping surface split along the pressing axis, the parts belonging to different shaping members moving in opposite directions.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the compacting is accomplished by<br>
counter movement of the one-piece or composite shaping members along a straight<br>
pressing axis.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the compacting is accomplished by counter movement of the one-piece or composite shaping members along a curved pressing axis.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the curved pressing axis is a circular arc.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the curved pressing axis is an element of a helical curve with a permanent or variable pitch.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein mechanical oscillations are applied to the one-piece or composite shaping members of the mold in the compacting of powder materials into articles.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the mechanical oscillations are of ultrasonic frequency range.<br>
8.	The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the mechanical oscillations are applied to the one-piece or composite shaping members of the mold, comprising a larger portion of the passive shaping surface.<br>
9.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein when compacting articles having an internal cavity or a developed surface, the shaping members have a minimum difference between areas of the passive shaping surfaces belonging to oppositely directed shaping members of the mold.<br>
10.	A mold for pressing articles from powder materials, comprising:<br>
a pair of one-piece or composite shaping members for forming a shaping cavity defined by active and passive shaping surfaces, the shaping members being arranged so that to mutually move along a pressing axis, with the pressing force transferred from the shaping members to the powder material through the active shaping surfaces, while the passive shaping surfaces serve to form surfaces of the powder article, parallel to the pressing axis,<br>
characterized in that the one-piece or composite shaping members of the mold, split along the pressing axis, comprise a part of at least one continuous passive shaping surface split along the pressing axis, on each of the shaping members located is at least one part of the at least one continuous passive shaping surface split along the pressing axis and intended for forming surfaces of the powder article, parallel to the pressing axis, and a part of at least one active shaping surface intended for transferring the pressing force.<br>
11.	The mold as claimed in claim 10, wherein each of the one-piece or composite shaping members of the mold comprises parts of the passive shaping surfaces and parts of the active shaping surfaces to define a plurality of cavities for compacting a plurality of powder articles.<br>
12.	The mold as claimed in claim 11, wherein the plurality of powder articles have the same shape.<br>
13.	The mold as claimed in claim 11, wherein the plurality of powder articles have different shape.<br>
14.	The mold as claimed in claim 11, wherein an end face of at least one of the one-piece or composite shaping members has at least one groove for filling the powder material into at least one shaping cavity of the mold.<br>
15.	The mold as claimed in claim 11, wherein the shaping members are capable of mutually moving in opposite directions along the pressing axis.<br>
16.	The mold as claimed in claim 15, wherein the pressing axis is selected from the group consisting of a straight pressing axis, a curved pressing axis and a circular arc and an element of a helical curve with a permanent or variable pitch.<br>
17.	The mold as claimed in claim 10, having means for preventing an off-axis displacement of the one-piece or composite shaping members.<br>
18.	The mold as claimed in claim 17, wherein the means for preventing an off-axis displacement of the one-piece of composite members is a structural clement selected from the group consisting of a shroud, a fixture, a pivot of the common axis of mutual movement of the shaping members, a spline engagement of the one-piece or composite members with one another, a bayonet engagement of the one-piece or composite shaping members, an elastic enclosure.<br>
19.	The mold as claimed in claim 17, wherein the means for preventing an off-axis displacement of the one-piece of composite members is at least one of the one-piece or composite shaping members.<br>
20.	The mold as claimed in claim 10, wherein the one-piece or composite shaping members have at least one groove to form a supplemental cavity for collecting gas or liquid forced out when the powder material is compacted.<br>
21.	The mold as claimed in claim 20, wherein the supplemental cavity is capable of increasing its volume at mutual movement of the one-piece or composite shaping members of the mold.<br>
22.	The mold as claimed in claim 10, wherein a number of components of the shaping<br>
members of the mold correspond to a number of depressions/protrusions on the article<br>
being compacted of the powder material.<br>
23.	The mold as claimed in claim 10, wherein when compacting articles having an internal cavity or a developed surface, the shaping members of the mold have a minimum difference between areas of the passive shaping surfaces belonging to oppositely directed shaping members of the mold.</td>
