				<td>METHOD AND DEVICE FOR CONTROLLING OPERATION OF A ROVING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for controlling the operation of a roving machine. More particularly, the present invention relates to the method and the device for controlling the preliminary operation of the roving machine before the roving machine is operated for normal roving operation.<br>
The preliminary operation of the roving machine is performed before the normal roving operation of the roving machine. Firstly, a predetermined length of a roving is delivered from a drafting mechanism and then passed through a flyer. Subsequently, the roving is wound around a presser and the end of the roving is held between a presser paddle of the presser and a bobbin. In this case, the operation of delivering a necessary length of roving from the drafting mechanism will be referred to as "preliminary delivery" of the roving hereinafter.<br>
According to a conventional preliminary delivery of a roving, an inching switch provided in the roving machine is operated to move the roving from the drafting mechanism by inching operation. With the inching switch held pressed, the drafting rollers of the drafting mechanism continue to rotate.<br><br>
Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 61-75831 discloses a roving machine having such an inching switch. The roving machine includes a drafting mechanism operable to deliver a roving and a flyeir rotating mechanism for twisting the roving. The roving machine further includes a bobbin rotating mechanism for winding the roving on a bobbin and "a lifting and lowering mechanism operable to lift and lower the bobbin. For the preliminary delivery of the roving, a workman turns on the inching switch to cause the roving to be delivered from the drafting mechanism. The workman also turns off the switch to stop the delivery when he judges that an appropriate length of the roving is delivered from the drafting mechanism.<br>
In the above publication, the length of the roving moved out from the drafting mechanism for the preliminary delivery depends on the judgment of the workman. If the length of the delivered roving is small, the workman needs to operate the inching switch again for further delivery of the roving. If the length is large, on the other hand, the workman may have to cut off the extra portion of the roving. In addition, the flyer rotating mectianism, the bobbin rotating mechanism and the lifting and lowering mechanism operate in conjunction with the drafting mechanism. Therefore, the winding position on an empty bobbin may not be located properly relative to the presser paddle of a flyer, thereby making it difficult to wind the roving around the bobbin. In addition, the presser paddle having no<br><br>
roving'may be brought into sliding contact with the winding position of the empty bobbin, damaging the winding position of the bobbin.<br>
The present invention, which has been made in light of the above problems, is directed to a method and a device for controlling the operation of a roving machine wherein the preliminary delivery of a roving is performed properly and easily.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for controlling operation of a roving machine. The roving machine includes a drafting rollers rotating mechanism operable to rotate drafting rollers and a flyer rotating mechanism operable to rotate a flyer. The roving machine further includes a bobbin rotating mechanism operable to rotate a bobbin wheel and a lifting and lowering mechanism operable to lift and lower a bobbin rail. The drafting rollers rotating mechanism is operable separately from the flyer rotating mechanism, the bobbin rotating mechanism and the lifting and lowering mechanism. The method is characterized by the step of delivering roving from the drafting rollers by operating only the drafting rollers rotating mechanism for a preliminary delivery of the roving. The method is further characterized by the step of stopping delivering the roving after delivering a predetermined length of the roving.<br><br>
The present invention provides a device for controlling operation of a roving machine. The roving machine includes a drafting rollers rotating mechanism operable to rotate drafting rollers and a flyer rotating mechanism operable to rotate a flyer. The roving machine further includes a bobbin rotating mechanism operable to rotate a bobbin wheel and a lifting and lowering mechanism operable to lift and lower a bobbin rail. The drafting rollers rotating mechanism is operable separately from the flyer rotating mechanism, the bobbin rotating mechanism and the lifting and lowering mechanism. The device is characterized in that a setting unit is provided in the device for setting length necessary for a preliminary delivery of roving. A starting switch is provided in the device for starting the preliminary delivery of the roving. A detecting unit is provided in the device for detecting length of the roving delivered by operating the preliminary delivery of the roving. When the starting switch is operated, operation of only the drafting mechanism is initiated thereby to deliver the roving from the drafting rollers. After the detecting unit detects that delivered length of the roving reaches the necessary length of the roving set by the setting unit, rotation of the drafting rollers is stopped.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following will describe an embodiment of a method and a device for controlling the operation of a roving machine according to the present invention<br><br>
•I<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring to Fig. 1, the roving machine 10 includes a drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 operable to rotate drafting rollers 12-15 and a flyer rotating mechanism 21 operable to rotate a flyer 22. The roving machine 10 further includes a bobbin rotating mechanism 31 operable to rotate a bobbin wheel 33 and a lifting and lowering mechanism 41 operable to lift and lower a bobbin rail 32.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 rotates four<br>
pairs of drafting rollers, i.e. the pairs of front rollers 12, second rollers 13, third<br>
.   rollers 14 and back rollers 15. These pairs of the drafting rollers 12-15 are<br>
arranged in this order as viewed from the front of the roving machine 10 or from<br>
the left-hand side on the drawing<br>
The drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 has a driven gear (not shown) that is connected to and driven by a drafting motor 16 through a gear mechanism 17 having a plurality of gear trains (not shown). When the drafting motor 16 is driven, the drafting rollers 12-15 are rotated through the driven gear and the gear trains of the gear mechanism 17. The drafting motor 16 of the present embodiment is provided by a servomotor controlled through a servo-amplifier 19. The drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 is operable separately from the flyer rotating mechanism 21, the bobbin rotating mechanism 31 and the lifting and lowering mechanism 41.<br><br>
The flyer rotating mechanism 21 is located below the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11. The flyer rotating mechanism 21 is connected to a main motor 27 through a rotary shaft 25, a driving gear 26 fixedly mounted on the rotary shaft 25 and a belt driving mechanism 29. The flyer rotating mechanism 21 has a driven gear 24 and a flyer 22 having a spindle 22C. The driven gear 24 is fixedly mounted on the spindle 22C and engages with the driving gear 26.<br>
When the main motor 27 is driven, the driving gear 26 is rotated through the belt driving mechanism 29 and the rotary shaft 25 thereby to rotate the driven gear 24 with the flyer 22 about the axis of the spindle 22C. The main motor 27 of the present embodiment is provided by an induction motor controlled through an inverter 30.<br>
The bobbin rotating mechanism 31 is located below the flyer rotating mechanism 21 and connected to the main motor 27 and a wind-up motor 37 through a differential gear mechanism 38. The bobbin rotating mechanism 31 includes a bobbin wheel 33, a driven gear 34, a driving gear 35 and a rotary shaft 36. A bobbin rail 32 is located below the flyer 22, on which the bobbin wheel 33 is mounted rotatably. The driven gear 34 is fixedly mounted to the bobbin wheel 33 coaxially therewith. The driving gear 35 engages with the driven gear 34 and is fixedly mounted on the rotary shaft 36. The rotation of the main motor 27 and the<br><br>
rotation of the wind-up motor 37 are combined through the differential gear mechanism 38 and transmitted to the rotary shaft 36.<br>
The wind-up motor 37 is provided by a servomotor controlled through a servo-amplifier 39. The operation of the wind-up motor 37 is controlled so that the rotational speed of the bobbin B mounted on the bobbin wheel 33 decreases with an increase of the wound diameter of the roving R on the bobbin B.<br>
The lifting and lowering mechanism 41 is connected to a lifting and lowering motor 45 through a gear mechanism 47 having a gear train. The lifting and lowering mechanism 41 of the present embodiment includes a lifter rack 42, a pinion 43 and a rotary shaft 44. The lifter rack 42 is fixed to the bobbin rail 32. The pinion 43 is fixedly mounted on the rotary shaft 44 and engages with the lifter rack 42. Rotation of the motor 45 is transmitted to the rotary shaft 44 through the gear mechanism 47. Rotation of the rotary shaft 44 causes the bobbin rail 32 to move up and down through the lifter rack 42 and the pinion 43. The motor 45 of the present embodiment is provided by a servomotor controlled through a servo-amplifier 48.<br>
The rotational direction of the rotary shaft 44 is changed by reversing the motor 45, and the lifting and lowering directions of the bobbin rail 32 are changed, accordingly A rotary encoder 49 is connected to one end of the rotary shaft 44 for<br><br>
detecting the moving direction and measuring the moved distance of the bobbin rail 32. Although the gear mechanism 47 is interposed between the motor 45 and the rotary shaft 44 in the present embodiment as shown in Fig. 1, the rotary shaft 44 may be connected to the motor 45 for rotation therewith. The rotary encoder 49 may be replaced by any suitable devices such as a resolver or an encoder attached to the motor 45.<br>
A sensor 50 is located adjacent to the front rollers 12 for counting the number of rotations of the front rollers 12 thereby to detect the delivered length of the roving R. Another sensor-51 is located adjacent to the driven gear 24 for counting the number of rotations of the flyer 22. A roving R delivered from the front rollers 12 is passed from a flyer top 22A of the flyer 22 through a guide duct of the flyer 22 to a flyer leg 22B of the flyer 22. Then, the roving R is led to the bobbin B through a presser 52 extending from the bottom of the flyer leg 228. The presser 52 of the present embodiment has a presser paddle 53 which is formed with a guide hole 54 and a guide slot 55 for guiding the roving R into the guide hole 54.<br>
The drafting motor 16, the wind-up motor 37, the lifting and lowering motor 45 and the main motor 27 are controlled by a controller 56 through the servo-amplifiers 19, 39, 48 and the inverter 30, respectively. The controller 56 has a central processing unit (CPU) 57, a program memory 58, a working memory 59,<br><br>
an input interface 60, an output interface 61 and an input device 62. The CPU 57 executes predetermined programs stored in the program memory 58. The CPU 57 is operable to control the operation of the drafting motor 16, the wind-up motor 37 and the lifting and lowering motor 45 through the output interface 61 and the servo-amplifiers 19, 39, 48, respectively. Further, the CPU 57 is operable to control the operation of the main motor 27 through the output interface 61 and the inverter 30. Output signals from the rotary encoder 49 and the sensors 50, 51 are transmitted to the CPU 57 through the input interface 60. The controller 56 and the sensor 50 of the present embodiment serve as a detecting unit of the present invention for detecting length of the roving delivered by operating the preliminary delivery of the roving R.<br>
The program memory 58 is provided by a read-only memory (ROM) which stores therein the above programs and various kinds of data necessary for the execution of the programs. The programs include a control program for controlling the operation of the main motor 27 and the wind-up motor 37 during winding operation of the bobbin B, and a control program for doffing operation. The programs further include a program for delivering the roving R from the front rollers 12 during the preliminary delivery of the roving R. The various kinds of data include roving machine operating data relating to the moving speed of the bobbin rail 32, the wound diameter of the roving R and the rotational speed of the bobbin wheel 33 during the winding operation of the bobbin B.<br><br>
The control program for the doffing operation includes programs for controlling the process of stopping operation of the roving machine 10 and the process of lowering the bobbin rail 32 to the doffing position after stopping the operation of the roving machine 10.<br>
The v\/orking memory 59 is provided by a random access memory (RAM)<br>
which temporarily stores therein data inputted through the input device 62, results<br>
of arithmetic operation executed in the CPU 57 and the like. The working memory<br>
	   59 has a backup power supply (not shown). <br>
The input device 62 is incorporated in the controller 56 and has an operation panel 62A in the form of a touch panel. Conditions of the roving R including the roving weight (grain), the kind of fiber and the number of twists, etc. necessary for normal roving operation of the roving machine 10 are set previously through the operation panel 62A of the input device 62. In addition, the length of the roving R to be moved out from the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 for the preliminary delivery is also set through the operation panel 62A.<br>
The preset length of the roving R for the preliminary delivery is the sum of a first length, a second length and a third length. The first length corresponds to the distance from the front rollers 12 of the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11<br><br>
to the outlet of the flyer leg 22B. The second length corresponds to the length of the roving R which is wound on the presser 52. The third length corresponds to the length of the roving R necessary for pressing the end of the roving R against the bobbin B. The operation panel 62A has display screens as a display means for displaying various information, as well as various switches appearing on the display screens and pressed when changing the display screens.<br>
Fig. 2 is an enlarged view showing a part of the operation panel 62A displaying a screen for the preliminary delivery of the roving R. The operation panel 62A.has three switches TB1, TB2 and TB3 arranged Juxtaposed at the middle of the panel 62A. The AUTO switch TB1 is a switch for starting the preliminary delivery of the roving R. When the AUTO switch TB1 is operated or pressed, operation of only the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 is initiated so that a preset length of the roving R is delivered from the front rollers 12. The drafting rollers 12-15 are stopped automatically after the preset length is delivered. More specifically, rotation of the drafting rollers 12-15 is stopped after delivered length of the roving R detected by the sensor 50 and the controller 56 reaches the necessary length of the roving R set by the input device 62.<br>
The STOP switch TB2 is used for stopping the delivery of the roving R from the front rollers 12. When the STOP switch TB2 is pressed, the delivery of the roving R effected by pressing the AUTO switch TB1 is stopped in the middle<br><br>
of the delivery or at an optional time.<br>
The INCHING switch TBS is used when it is desired to deliver the roving R further than the length delivered by pressing the AUTO switch TB1. This INCHING switch TBS allows the roving R to be moved only while the switch is being pressed.<br>
The following will describe the operation of the preliminary delivery of a roving R in the roving machine 10. Prior to the normal roving operation of the roving machine 10, preliminary operation of the roving machine 10 is performed. -Firstly, data of the length of the roving R necessary for the preliminary delivery, as well as data of the roving weight (grain), the kind of fiber, the number of twists, etc. are preset through the operation panel 62A. The input data are stored in the working memory 59.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3A, a sliver S is passed through the drafting rollers 12-15 from the back of the roving machine 10 before the preliminary delivery. An empty bobbin B is mounted on the bobbin rail S2 previously. The bobbin rail 32 is set at such a height that the presser paddle 53 is level with the winding position of the empty bobbin B so that the end of the roving R to hang from the presser paddle 53 can be engaged easily with the bobbin B at the winding position (not shown) thereof. The operation panel 62A is set to display a screen for the<br><br>
preliminary delivery, as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Pressing the AUTO switch TB1, the drafting motor 16 is driven thereby to rotate the drafting rollers 12-15 at preset speeds. The rotational speeds of the drafting rollers 12-15 for the preliminary delivery of the roving R are lower than those for the normal roving operation. The roving R delivered from the front rollers 12 has a preset length and is stored on a flyer rail FR as shown in Fig. 3B.<br>
For stopping the roving R in the middle of the preliminary delivery, the drafting motor 16 is stopped by pressing the STOP switch TB2. When it is desired to deliver the roving R further than the above preset length, the INCHING switch TBS is used as described above.<br>
After the preliminary delivery of the roving R is completed, the roving R is twisted manually and then passed through the guide duct of the flyer 22, as shown in Fig. 3C. Then, the end of the roving R is wound on the presser 52 and held between the presser paddle 53 and the empty bobbin B, as shown in Fig. 3D. Thus, the preliminary delivery and the subsequent transferring of the roving R are completed.<br>
Then, the screen on the operation panel 62A is switched to a screen for the normal roving operation. Setting operation necessary for the normal roving<br><br>
t<br>
operation is performed on the switched screen for starting the normal roving operation of the roving machine 10. As the roving machine 10 is started, the motors 16, 27, 37, 45 are driven synchronously at their respective predetermined speeds based on the conditions of the roving R.<br>
Accordingly, the front rollers 12 and the flyer 22 are rotated at their respective constant speeds with a predetermined speed ratio. The rotational speed of the wind-up motor 37 and the rotational speed of the main motor 27 are combined by the differential gear mechanism 38, so that the speed of the bobbin wheel 33 is changed in accordance with the current wound diameter of the-roving R of the bobbin B.<br>
The bobbin rail 32 is moved up and down by the lifting and lowering motor 45 through the gear mechanism 47. While the bobbin rail 32 is being thus lifted and lowered, the roving R delivered from the front rollers 12 is wound around the bobbin B. During the normal roving operation of the roving machine 10, the CPU 57 operates to count the output signals from the sensor 50. The operation panel 62A displays on its screen various information about the operating conditions.<br>
It is noted that the controller 56 is so designed that, during the normal roving operation of the roving machine 10, operation of only the drafting rollers rotating   mechanism   11   as  in  the  above-described   preliminary  delivery  is<br><br>
prohibited. More specifically, it is so arranged that the panel 62Adoes not display the screen for the switches TB1-TB3 during the normal roving operation. Alternatively, the switches TB1- TBS if present on the operation panel 62A during the normal roving operation of the roving machine 10 are rendered inoperable. Such controlling is made possible by a program stored in the program memory 58.<br>
When the count of the CPU 57 reaches a value of the roving length corresponding to a predetermined roving weight, the CPU 57 recognizes that the bobbin B becomes full and initiates a control program for stopping for the doffing operation. During this stopping, the operation of the roving machine 10 is stopped, then the bobbin rail 32 is lowered to the doffing position and the roving R is cut off.<br>
Whenever the conditions such as the kind of fibers and thickness of the roving R are changed, the above preliminary delivery needs to be performed. The preliminary delivery of the roving R may be perfonned also after each maintenance of the roving machine 10.<br>
The method and device for controlling the operation of the roving machine 10 of the present embodiment have the following advantageous effects.<br>
(1)        During the preliminary delivery of the roving R, the roving R is delivered<br><br>
m<br>
from the drafting rollers 12-15 by operating only the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 thereby to deliver the preset length of the roving R from the front rollers 12. The preliminary delivery of the roving R is completed by operating only the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 without operation of the flyer rotating mechanism 21, the bobbin rotating mechanism 31 and the lifting and lowering mechanism 41. Therefore, the preliminary delivery of the roving R does not depend on the judgment of the workman. During the preliminary delivery of the roving R, the flyer 22, the bobbin rail 32 and the bobbin wheel 33 are not operated, either. Therefore, the presser paddle 53 of the flyer 22 and the winding position of the empty bobbin B can be located in facing relation to eachv other, thereby — facilitating the step of winding the roving R around the bobbin B. In addition, the presser paddle 53 is not brought into sliding contact with the winding position of the empty bobbin B without the roving R.<br>
(2) According to the present embodiment, the delivery of the roving R by operating only the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 cannot be done during the normal roving operation of the roving machine 10. For example, even if any wrong operation is performed during the normal roving operation, the delivery of the roving R by operating only the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 is not effected during the normal roving operation. Thus, abnormal operation of the roving machine 10 does not occur.<br><br>
J<br>
(3)	Operation of only the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 for the preliminary delivery of the roving R can be initiated merely by-pressing the AUTO switch TB1 as shown in Fig. 2, thereby making possible the delivery of the preset length of the roving R from the front rollers 12.<br>
(4)	According to the present embodiment, the delivery of the preset length of the roving R effected by pressing the AUTO switch TBI can be stopped by pressing the STOP switch TB2 in the middle of the preliminary delivery.<br>
-	(5)-     -With the INCHING switch TBS held pressed, the drafting rollers 12-15<br>
continue to rotate. Thus, the roving R may be delivered further from the drafting rollers 12-15 as required by operating the INCHING switch TBS after the preset length of the roving R is delivered by operation of the AUTO switch TBI.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, but may be variously modified within the scope of the invention, as exemplified below.<br>
In the above embodiment, the three mechanisms 11, 21, 41 are driven by the separate motors 16, 27, 45, respectively. However, it is only necessary that the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 is driven separately from the other mechanisms 21, 31, 41. For example, if the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11<br><br>
and the flyer rotating mechanism 21 are driven by a single motor, it may be so arranged that only the drafting rollers rotating mechanism 11 is operable by providing a clutch between the single motor and the flyer rotating mechanism 21.<br>
Although the switches TBI-TBS in the above embodiment are displayed on the operation panel 62A in the form of a touch panel, the kind and form of the switches TBI-TBS may be optionally selected.<br>
In the above embodiment, data for the necessary length of the roving R is<br>
inputted into the input device 62 before the preliminary delivery of the roving R. In	<br>
a modification of the embodiment, however, data for a plurality of lengths of the roving R are prepared so as to meet the conditions of the roving R and registered through the input device 62 in advance. In each operation, an appropriate datum is selected from the registered data. Alternatively, in setting the length for the preliminary delivery of the roving R, a correction factor may be used in accordance with the characteristics such as reduction ratio of the roving R for use in the roving machine 10.<br>
