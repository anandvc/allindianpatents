				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention provides an Improved Water Supply System in trains. The<br>
invention reports an economic and efficient system for automatic washing of toilet<br>
floor and toilet tanks in all coaches of trains. The system operates through the main<br>
pipe, hydrain pipe, plu of feeder and filling pipe, toilet tank with flushing and floating<br>
valve accessories, the source of water is from main hydrain pipe located underground<br>
on the platform and laid parallel to railway track with two type opening with wheel<br>
valve platform at the junction of 3rd and 4th coaches halting location and that of 6th<br>
location the main tank affixed in coaches is filled with water from the hydrain pipe<br>
when train halts at station operated by single worker. Main pipe and main hydrain<br>
pipe serves as water channel water reservoir in trains and at platform respectively.<br>
Here the water supply system is given for the platform located underground and not<br>
in-between two railway lines as practiced in the system of tank filling flashing valve<br>
is fixed in between main pipe joint and floating valve . the flashing valve allows<br>
water to flow for only 30 seconds int o the flashing pipe arrangement a toilet floor<br>
level. Water comes out with force through the jet system located in the lower portion<br>
of toilet wall and automatically wash the toilet floor the advantage of the system is<br>
that all coaches of train get equal distribution of water and can be operated by single<br>
worker and prevents wastage and contamination of water as hydrain pipe has been<br>
located in platform with only to supply location and pipe laid underground.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
There are many problems in our daily life. Out of these, science has made it possible<br>
to solve many of them. Still there are other problems yet to solve.<br>
In railways there is burning problem of sanitation of toilet in train coaches and<br>
passenger has to suffer a lot of agonies during their train journey. It is very difficult<br>
to travel in a train for long time without using a toilet. Often the toilet of the coaches<br>
are very dirty and unhygienic . Sometimes it is seen that after passing a watering<br>
station water is not available in all the coaches. So passengers are forced to travel in a<br>
unclean and dirty situation. It becomes a big problem mainly for patients and<br>
children. The passengers who are going in a long journey this problem of toilets<br>
become very difficult for them. Now-a-days, trains are very long in length and stop<br>
after a long interval of time. So one can't take advantage of facility available on the<br>
spot. For this, it is very essential to supply water in the toilets of every coach.<br>
PROBLEM FOR MAINTENANCE IN EXISTING SYSTEM<br>
Railways department nominates certain stations for looking water availability and<br>
stoppage time as a watering point for train. Trains are watered at these stations. The<br>
water is filled in the toilet tank by fixing a flexible hose-pipe from the opposite side of<br>
the platform at least in two places of every coach. Supply pipe line of water generally<br>
is located between the two running lines and above a drain. There are no proper path<br>
ways to operate this type of work, sometimes there are no lights also . In this<br>
situation a man can pour water in two or three coaches within stipulated stoppage<br>
time. Sometimes working out of hose - pipe creates problem for watering and<br>
wastage of water is seen. The situation become so bad sometime that passengers get<br>
irritated and railways lose their goodwill. Though water is available in the station but<br>
coaches can't get the supply of water.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an Improved Water Supply<br>
System in trains.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to reduce the wastage of water.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is that it will not require to supply<br>
water in the coaches of train after a few stations.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is the reduction of man power to<br>
perform the work<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to ensure the safe working of man.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to reduce the installation cost of<br>
watering pit with less maintenance.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to Lessen the chances of<br>
contamination of water.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to supply equally the water in all<br>
toilets.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to flush the toilets in an equal<br>
interval.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The system facilitates supply of water uniformly to every coach of the train in a very<br>
short time with a lesser manpower. The system saves wastage of water which is so<br>
precious. ( See Diagram)<br>
The main pipe (MP) of a coach will run over all the coaches of the train and about 400<br>
mm will be projected out of each side of the each coach. The main pipe (MP) should<br>
be tightened with the ceiling of all coaches of the train.<br>
From the projected portion of the main pipe a high pressure flexible hose (HPFH)<br>
should be attached with adjacent coach's projected portion of a main pipe (MP) .<br>
Like this, all the coaches of the train will be connected together with high pressure<br>
flexible hose (HPFH).<br>
Both the ends of the train's main pipe are required to be blocked with the plugs.<br>
In every coach four feeder .pipes to be located in the existing position at the corner of<br>
the coaches. The lower end of the feeder pipe below the coach corner is fixed with<br>
quick cuppler (1st part) so that it can attached easily, lightly and leak proof.<br>
Other end of the filler pipe to be connected with main pipe from both the sides in both<br>
ends of coach with the help of the reducing cross socket and through a spring loaded<br>
one way valve, it will allow to flow water from feeder pipe to main pipe only.<br>
One tank filling pipe should be connected with main pipe with a T shaped<br>
socket just above the toilet tank and other end of the tank filling pipe should be<br>
connected with toilet tank through one floating ball type stop valve, so that whenever<br>
toilet tank filled up desirable level of water it stop further water flow to the particular<br>
tank.<br>
In the tank filling pipe between main pipe joint and floating value a separate<br>
valve called flushing valve is to be fixed to facilitate automatic flushing of toilet floor.<br>
The flushing valve will allow to flow water through it for 30 only just while the tank<br>
will fill up. It should be operated with floating type ball valve movement . The<br>
flushing valve will allow to flow water into the flushing pipe arrangement in which a<br>
number of jet system at toilet floor level will be operated from all directions is located<br>
in the lower portion of the toilet wall through which water force will come to spray in<br>
the toilet floor so that the toilet floor may wash out automatically just after filling of<br>
the toilet tank. Main pipe of the coaches are interconnected of the full train will<br>
operate one by one.<br>
WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM IN THE PLATFORM<br>
In the existing system there are several from the opposite side of the platform. In the<br>
existing system all the individual toilet tanks required to fill up by fixing a hose pipe<br>
in the system.<br>
The system I want to develop in which the main hydrain pipe should be<br>
brought to platform side instead of opposite side.<br>
In this system main hydrain pipe will run through the platform at about 300<br>
mm below the platform and at about 300 mm inside the platform from its edge<br>
parallel to the railway track. A 150 mm dia pipe is required to use in which there will<br>
be a constant supply of water with a pressure of 2.5 kg - 3 kg per cm2 . Constantly<br>
available from the main source.<br>
Considering the regular stopping position of train engine one box type opening<br>
should be provided on the platform above the main hydrain pipe at about a distance of<br>
3 coaches length and nearer to the joining point of coach no. 3 and 4 and the next<br>
other boxes to be located 6 coach length apart.<br>
Within the each box on the platform 2 wheel valves are require to connect<br>
with main hydrain pipe facing towards track. Each of the wheel valve to be connected<br>
with flexible of require size hose. Other end of the hose is fitted with a part of quick<br>
cuppling to facilitated quick attachment / detachment of hose with feeder pipe quick<br>
cuppling portion. Keeping the whole system i.e., wheel valve, hose, quick cuppling<br>
etc it the box it should be closed with a heavy lid. The upper portion of the lid<br>
requires to levelled with the platform so that passenger can easily walk on it.<br>
WORKING OF THE SYSTEM<br>
The system is designed to fill up toilet tank easily, quickly and evenly in<br>
watering station and for automatic flushing of toilet. Just on arrival of trains two men<br>
start working from forward and backward side of the train.<br>
First of all they open the lid of the box after drawing out flexible hoses from<br>
the box they connect the quick cupplers with the filler pipe quick cuppler and open<br>
both the wheel valves to allow flow of water and after closing the lid again they will<br>
move for next box situated 6 coaches away and repeat their job again. After fixing up<br>
the hose they will come to the first position care whether toilet flush out or not. Just<br>
after flushing out of maximum toilets they will close the wheel valve remove hoses<br>
from the quick cuppling connection keeping the whole system in the box they will<br>
finally close the lid again and repeat the job in the next box again to complete their<br>
work for a particular train in a particular time.<br>
The water supply through hydrain pipe will reach to main pipe through wheel<br>
valve, hose, filler pipe, one way valve. From main pipe (MP) water will flow through<br>
feeder pipe and floating ball valve to the toilet tank at different location in different<br>
coach (As main pipe is connected together with flexible hose).<br>
Whenever a particular tank of a particular coach will filled up immediately the<br>
flushing valve will start working for 30 sec and water will flow through the flushing<br>
pipe and the ball valve will close the opening of the tank of the train filled up and<br>
washed up the water pressure in side the main pipe will come equal to main hydrain<br>
pipe water pressure and one way valve close its path automatically and compressed<br>
water will lock inside the main pipe.<br>
Whenever any passenger start using water in a toilet and the water level of<br>
toilet tank comes down which will give further path to the ball valve to flow water<br>
from main pipe reserve water into the particular toilet tank. In this manner additional<br>
water supplied to these tanks which are having more consumption.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a improved system for automatic<br>
flushing of toilet floor and toilet tank in all coaches of the train comprising<br>
a. main pipe passing through the ceiling of the coaches of the train are<br>
interconnected with the flexible house.<br>
b. Plurality of feeder pipes connected with the main pipe<br>
c. toilet tank accessories.<br>
d. main hydrain pipe laid 300 mm underground the plateform and placed<br>
parallel to railway track.<br>
e. high pressure flexible hose for interconnection of main pipe between<br>
two coaches.<br>
f. wheel valve with hydrain pipe for water supply to main pipe.<br>
g. coupler and t shaped shockers for joining flexible hose and filler,<br>
h. one way valve for supply of water pipe to main pipe only.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the main pipe and main hydrain pipe<br>
serves as water channel /reservoir in trains and at platform.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the main hydrain pipe with<br>
wheel valve serves for the supply of water to the main pipe line of train through<br>
the system of wheel valve, horse, filler pipe and one way valve throughout the<br>
train.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the main pipe serves the<br>
purpose of supplying water to toilet tank of different coaches connected with<br>
flexible hose.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the system of flush tank starts<br>
flushing for 30 seconds as soon as it is filled up.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the system of toilet tank gets<br>
water from the main pipe whenever its water level comes down after using toilet<br>
by a passenger.<br>
