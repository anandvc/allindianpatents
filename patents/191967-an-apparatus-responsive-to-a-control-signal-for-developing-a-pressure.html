The present invention relates to an apparatus res^nsive to a control signal for developing a pressure having current-to-pressure transducers and, more particularly, to a current-to-pressure transducer having a selectable, adjustable input filter.<br>
Control systems, such as for controlling liquid or gas flow [H'ocesses, typically include a current-to-pressure transducer coupled to an actuator w^ch, in turn, is coupled to a valve which controls a process. An ou^ut signal from a process amtroUer is coupled to the current-to-pressure transducer for controlling the process.<br>
In an open-loop process control system, the process controller supplies a 4-20 mA control signal to the current-to-pressure transducer which c(mverts the control signal into an output pressure causing the actuator to operate the valve to control the process in a predetermined manner. In contrast, in a closed-loop process control system, a sensor detects the value of a parameter of the process being controlled so that the value of the parameter can be fed back to the process controller. The fMXJcess controller then regulates its output signal continuously to maintain a minimal difference between the value of the sensed {xxKess parameter and an input command, called a setpoint or desired value for the sensed {H'ocess param^er.<br><br>
In applications where the process to be controlled has a small time constant, it is desirable to employ a current-to-press\ire transducer having a slow first-order response in conjunction with a spring-and-diaphragm actuator.  One such transducer is the Type 546 current-to-pressure transducer, manufactured by Fisher Controls International, Inc.  This transducer is functionally similar in its response characteristic to a single-pole, low-pass filter with a large time constant.<br>
Other developments in transducer technology have given rise to transducers having faster, second-order low-pass filter characteristics when connected to an actuator such as a spring-and-diaphragm actuator. While these transducers can be employed to operate actuators in the closed-loop control of fast processes, the proportional gain of the process controller must be reduced by re-tuning the process controller in order for these transducers to achieve the same degree of process loop damping as transducers having relatively slower, first-order lag characteristics.  In some instances, even after the controller is re-tuned in an effort to achieve system stability, the controlled process variable or parameter still exhibits overshoot, or limit cycles (i.e., small amplitude oscillations), or does not conform as<br>
closely as desired to the command input signat-^or	<br>
setpoint and responds more slowly than is desired to a change in the setpoint.<br>
The foregoing problems arise, for example, when the current-to-pressure transducer must be replaced due to aging or wear caused by .constant exposure to vibration, adverse thermal conditions, or ordinary wear, or simply when a technological<br><br>
upgrade of the transducer or other system components is desired, hi such cases, changes in the response characteristic of the transducer and actuator from a first-order to a second-order lag characteristic can adversely affect process loop tuning and control.<br>
Summary of the invention;<br>
The present invention provides a current-to-pressure transducer having a selectable, adjustable input filter which overcomes the problems described above.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus responsive to a control signal for developing a pressure, comprising: a current-to-pressure transducer having means responsive to the control signal for develc^ing the pressure; a fiher disposed intermediate the control signal and the current-to-pressure transducer and having a dynamic input-to-output characteristic with a time constant which is adjustable to enable variation of the dynamic input-to-output characteristic; and means for selectively activating and deactivating the filter.<br>
Preferably, the filter comprises an integral part of the current-to-pressure transduce.<br>
In ooe embodiment, the filter is a dominant, first-<mxler lag fiher and preferably is a low-pass filter. the filter may include an ao further resistot-capacitor networic coupled to qierational arapli alternatively be digital calculating means for performing calculations derive dynamic input-to-output characteristic.></mxler><br>
Preferably, the calculating means in the latter embodiment includes a microprocessor.<br>
In a system for controlling a process having a process parameter, wherein the system includes detecting means for detecting the process parameter, a controller having means for receiving an input signal derived from the detected process parameter and means for deriving a controller output signal which depends on the input signal, a current-to-pressure transducer responsive to the controller output signal for developing a pressure, a valve actuator responsive to the pressure developed by the transducer, and a valve responsive to the valve actuator for controlling the process, the present invention provides an improvement comprising a filter disposed intermediate the control signal and the current-to-pressure transducer, the filter having a dynamic input-to-output characteristic which substantially ensures that the gain of the system is small enough to substantially maintain the stability of the system and large enough to enable the process parameter to be adjusted to substantially compensate for load variations in the process.  The dynamic input-to-output characteristic of the filter has a user-adjustable time constant so that the dynamic input-to-output characteristic may be varied.  Further, means are provided for selectively activating and deactivating the filter.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring initially to Fig. 1, a process control system 2 0 includes a current-to-pressure transducer 22 coupled to a valve actuator 24 which, in turn, is coupled to a valve 26 which controls a process 28.  The process 28 may be a flow process, a liquid pressure process, or a small-volume gas pressure process, or any other desired process.  A process controller 30 supplies a 4-20 mA control signal 32 to the current-to-pressure transducer 22 to control the process 28.<br>
The process control system 2 0 may be an open-loop or a closed-loop system.  In a closed-loop system {shown in Fig. 1), a sensor 34 operates to detect the value of a process parameter 3 6, such as a flow rate^ or pressure, a temperature, a liquid level, a specific gravity, or any other desired parameter.  The detected value of the parameter 3 6<br><br>
is coupled to an inverting input of a stumer 38 which computes a difference 40 between an input command signal or setpoint 42 and a signal 44 representing the value of the parameter 36 as detected by the sensor 34. In an open-loop process control system 20 (not shown), the sensor 34 and the summer 38 are omitted, and the input command signal or setpoint 42 is coupled directly to the process controller 30 to control the process 28 in a predetermined manner (i.e., wherein the controller input is not responsive to the value of the detected process parameter 36).<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, the current-to-<br>
pressure transducer 22 has an input 48 (which<br>
typically is either a 4-20 mA current signal or a 1-<br>
5 V voltage signal and which, in either case, is<br>
proportional to the 4-20 mA control signal 32) ^nd a<br>
pressure output 54.  The current-to-pressure<br>
transducer 22 also includes a transducer 50 having<br>
an input 52.  The pressure output 54 of the current-<br>
to-pressure transducer 22 is coupled directly t6 an<br>
output 55 of the transducer 50.        	 — —<br>
The input 52 of the transducer 50 is coupled to a signal selector 56 which is operable" to<br>
select either of two input signals to be coiipled to the input 52 of the transducer 50. More^ ^^ ^^ - . particularly, the signal selector 56 operates to<br>
select either BL-filtered signal 58, wliich, is_<br>
filtered by an input filter 60, or an unfilt^'reef signal 62, which is" simply the input 48 to the current-to-pressure transducer 22.  In other words, the signal selector 56 is operable ^o select or de-seiect^the"fiIteFihg~function^oF the fiT€Br~'6'Q~'s6   " that the current-to-pressure transducer 22 can be<br><br>
operated with or without the selectable, adjustable input filter 60.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, in installations where the dynamics of the process 28 are dominant in the control system 20, the signal selector 56 is operated to de-select the input filter 60 (i.e., to couple the unfiltered signal 62 to the input 52 of the transducer 50) inasmuch as the dominant, first-order filter is not required in such installations. In other installations, where the dynamics of the process 28 are not dominant, the signal selector 56 is operated to select the input filter 60 (i.e. to couple the filtered signal 58 to the input 52 of the transducer 50) so that the filter 60 may be adjusted to achieve stability of the process control system 20.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, the input filter 60 is now described in more detail.  Initially, it should be noted that while the filter 60 is described below in connection with an analog circuit, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the filtering function may also be achieved by digital means such as a microprocessor suitably programmed to calculate the same input-to-output characteristic as would be generated by the equivalent analog filter 60 shown in Fig. 3.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the input filter 60 includes an operational amplifier 64 having a positive input terminal 66, a negative input terminal 68, and an output terminal 70 at which the operational amplifier 64 produces an output signal. The output signal is fed back from the output terminal 70 to the negative input terminal 68.  A resistor 72 is coupled between the input 4 8 and the<br><br>
positive input temninal 66 of the operational amplifier 64.  In addition, a capacitor 74 is coupled between the positive input terminal 66 of the operational amplifier 64 and a ground terminal 76.<br>
The resistance ai»i capacitance values of the resistor 72 and the Ceipacitor 74, respectively, may be chosen to obtain a time constant for the input filter 60 having whatever value is needed for the process control system 20 to be stable.  Of course, the value of the time constant will depend on the charactexistics of all of the dominant lags present in the process control system 2 0 as will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In addition, as an alternative to the use of the above-described signal selector 56 as a means for selecting and deselecting the filter 60, the filter 60 can be effectively deselected by choosing resistance and capacitance values for the resistor 72 and the capacitor 74, respectively, so that the time constant for the filter 60 is very small or zero.  In other words, the resistance of the resistor 72 should be small or nearly zero and, in any event, much less than the input impedance of the operational amplifier 64 selected for the application.  The capacitor should be of a high- „ quality, low-leakage type (e.g., fabricated of tantalum or ceramic materials) and should not be sufficiently large to load the input 48 during transients.<br>
In an analog embodiment, the resistance and capacitance values may be selected simply by coupling resistive and capacitive elements having the desired values into the filter 60. Alternatively, in a digital embodiment, a user-<br><br>
defined parameter nay be set to a value corresponding to the desired time constemt for the filter 60 simply by suitably programming the digital filter (i.e. in either software or firmware programming, as desired).  In additicm, in the digital embodiment, another user-defined parameter may be used to select and de-select the filter 60, thereby providing, in the—digital embodiment, the same functionality as is provided by the signal selector 56 in the above-described anal
Of course, it will im  readily a^jparent to those skilled in the art that the filter function of the filter 60 may be provided by any other analog or digital, electrical or mechanical meems instead of the op-amp/RC circuit described above ami  shown in Fig. 3.  In any case, what is important is that the filter 60 have a dynamic input-to-output characteristic which substantially ensures that the gain of the process control system 20 (Fig. 1) is small enough to substantially maintain the stability of the system 20 and large enough to enable the process parameter 36 (Fig. 1) to be adjusted to substantially compensate for load variations in the process 28 (Fig. 1).  Further, regardless of the type of filter 60 used in the transducer 22, the dynamic input-to-output characteristic of the filter 60 should have a time constant which is adjustable to enable variation of the dynamic input-to-output characteristic as described above.  Thus, when a current-to-pressure transducer 22 is installed in a process control system 20, the gain of the input filter 60 is increased to adjust the input-to-output characteristic of the filter 60 while maintaining the stability of the process control system 20.<br><br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, the digital embodiment of the filter 60 includes a microprocessor 78 and calculating means such as a program 80 adapted to be executed by the microprocessor 78 to implement the dynamic input-to-output characteristic of the filter 60 by deriving an output bit stream 82 (which may be either parallel or serisuL) from an input bit streeun 84 (which also may be either parallel or serial) .  To those of ordinary skill in the art, it is a straightforward matter to develop the program 80 to perform the calculations required to inclement the digital embodiment of the filter 60.  Hje digital filter 60 also includes a user-defined parameter 86 for choosing a time constant for the filter 60 and a user-defined parameter 88 for selecting and deselecting the filter 60. As an optional additional feature of the digital embodiment, the program 80 may employ a default se„tting for the time constant when the user-defined parameter 86 is set to zero and the user-defined parameter 88 is set to select the filter 60.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 2, the current-to-pressure transducer 22 may optionally be equipped with a filter 60 which canndt be de-selected, such as by the signal selector 5^ described above, for use in those installations in which the filter 60 is always necessary (e.g., instiallations in which the dynamics of the process 28 will never be dominant in the process control system io) .<br>
A transducer 22 having a selectable, adjustable input filter 60 in accordance with the present invention facilitates relatively quicker response of the process parameter 3 6 to changes in the setpoint 42 than could be achieved by process<br><br>
control systems 20 employing prior-art, non-filtering current-to-pressure transducers.<br>
The foregoing description is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode of carrying out the invention and is to be construed as illustrative only*  Numerous modifications and alternative Embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this description.  The details of the disclosed structure may be varied substantially without departing from the spirit of the invention, and the exclusive use of all modifications within the scope of the appended claims is reserved.<br><br><br>
