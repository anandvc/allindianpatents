The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, belonging to the rubber manufacturing technical field, relates to a rubber composition, and particularly to a vulcanizible rubber composition that can be kept at room temperature over a long period of time as well as the rubber grains therefrom.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rubber is an important macromolecular elastomer material, and considerably used in various products, such as tires, shoe soles, seal rings, and various protection devices. The materials used for various products are required to be good in abrasion resistance, flex resistance, water/oil resistance, and heat/cold resistance, high in flexibility and tear strength, and also low in the cost, with a complicated forming process. Various rubber products are mainly made from combination of the following various rubber materials: Natural rubber, isoprene rubber, butadiene rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, nitrile butadiene rubber, neoprene rubber, ethylene propylene terpolymer rubber, and so on. Various traditional rubber materials, being high in molecular weight and poor in fluidity, can be formed only by compression molding. Besides, steam heating is adopted in the vulcanized process of rubber for improving uniformity of the mold temperature; however, this process requires a complicated and expensive high pressure boiler, which is high in equipment investment and energy consumption. The traditional rubber has a high molecular weight and a high level of entanglement among the molecules thereof, which makes the rubber generate a great deal of heat in the process of open mixing or internal mixing; besides, the heat is not easy to be dissipated, making the stock incline to be vulcanized partly, thus making the products after compression molding have defects. Moreover, the stock that is vulcanized with the traditional sulphur may be self-vulcanized at a slightly higher environmental temperature, and thus cannot be stored over a long period of time; a low temperature environment is needed if a long-term storage is desired. It is because of various shortcomings of the traditional rubber that the thermoplastic elastomer is produced,  the main of which is styrene series of elastomer. The styrene series of elastomer can be formed by injection molding through a simple manufacturing process and recovered, and is thus fully developed; however, since the styrene series of elastomer keeps the mechanical properties only through physical junctions, it cannot satisfy the requirements of some products for high performance (such as high abrasion resistance, or high tear strength). Furthermore, the styrene series of thermoplastic elastomer is very difficult to effect effective chemical crosslinking, because the styrene series of thermoplastic elastomer is a block copolymer of various segments with different difficulty level of crosslinking, which makes crosslinking nonuniform. <br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
For overcoming the various shortcomings of the existing rubber materials and their processes, a purpose of the present invention is to provide a crosslinkable rubber composition, the use thereof, the rubber grains therefrom, and a method for preparing and injection molding the rubber grains, and to allow the rubber composition and the rubber grains to be formed directly by injection molding; besides, the rubber grains will not be self-vulcanized at a temperature below 80?, and can be kept at a temperature of 30? over a long period of time, having no need for low-temperture storage. <br>

Note: ? Conditions for testing the melt index: 200? and 5 Kg, without a vulcanizing agent.<br>
? Conditions for preparing the sample: the injection temperature of 70? and the vulcanization temperature of 165?, with the vulcanization duration of 300 seconds.<br>
It can be seen from the above test data that the melt indexes of all the rubber grains are over 10 g/10 min, indicating that fluidity of the grains fully fulfills the requirement of injection molding; all the materials have higher elongation at break, indicating that the rubber after vulcanization has good tenacity; and all the materials have smaller permanent compression deformation, indicating that the rubber has better resilience, high flexibility and high tenacity, as well as certain strength, fully fulfilling the requirements of the rubber material. <br>
The crosslinkable rubber grains according the present invention can be kept at a temperature of 35? over a long period of time, having no need for low-temperture storage. <br>
The present invention further provides methods for injection molding the rubber grains as described above. <br>
A first injection molding method includes the following steps: These rubber grains are heated and pressurized into a turbulent stock at a temperature of 50-120? and a pressure of 50-130 MPa; this turbulent stock is injected into the mold cavity; and the turbulent stock in this mold cavity is vulcanized at a vulcanization temperature of 140-190?, with the vulcanization duration no longer than 10 minutes. <br>
A second injection molding method includes the following steps: Three kinds of rubber grains with different ratios are heated and pressurized into three kinds of turbulent stocks, respectively, at a temperature of 50-120? and a pressure of 50-130 MPa; these three kinds of turbulent stocks with different ratios are injected into three noncommunicating mold cavities, respectively; then the early vulcanization is performed to vulcanize the turbulent stocks in these three noncommunicating mold cavities at a vulcanization temperature of 140-190? and a vulcanization duration of 0-120 s; the middle moldboard among the three mold cavities is removed while the other two moldboards at both sides of the middle moldboard are buckled, making two of the three mold cavities communicate with the other mold cavity to form a complete mold cavity; and the turbulent stock in this complete mold cavity is vulcanized at a vulcanization temperature of 140-190? and a vulcanization duration of 100-360s. <br>
The injection molding methods as described above are designed for a single kind of rubber grains and three kinds of rubber grains, respectively. Person skilled in the art can further deduce a method of injection molding two kinds of rubber grains with different ratios. This injection molding method is similar to the second injection molding method, with the difference only in that there are two kinds of rubber grains and the corresponding mold has only two mold cavities. <br>
The different ratios as described above can be different in the colorant, such as black rubber grains, blue rubber grains and red rubber grains. The color can also be other colors, such as yellow, green, white, purple and so on.<br>
The second injection molding method as described above can be used to integratedly mold products of different colors. <br>
The crosslinkable rubber grains according to the present invention can be used for preparing the molded rubber products. Further description will be made with reference to the following examples. <br>
Example 5 of molded rubber products<br>
Firstly, the rubber grains are prepared according to Example 3; and<br>
then a shoe sole is made by means of the first injection molding method. <br>
A property test is made on the shoe sole, with the results as shown in Table 2. <br>

It can be seen from the above test data that the shoe sole made by injection molding of the rubber grains of the present invention, compared with the shoe sole made of conventional materials, has higher elongation at break, tear strength and tensile strength, as well as good slip resistance and heat/scald resistance. The rubber composition and rubber grains of the present invention can fulfill the usage requirements. <br>
What described above is rather preferred examples than restrictions on the present invention. Any simple amendment, alteration and equivalent structural change made on the above examples according to the technical substance of the present invention will all fall within the scope of protection of the technical solution of the present invention.<br><br><br>
