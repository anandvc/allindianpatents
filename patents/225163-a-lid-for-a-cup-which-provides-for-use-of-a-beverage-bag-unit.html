The Patents Rules, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
A LID FOR A CUP WHICH PROVIDES FOR USE OF A BEVERAGE<br>
BAG UNIT<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a lid for a cup, in particular a disposable cup, which provides for use of a beverage bag unit comprising a beverage bag and a drawstring connected to the beverage bag, where a beverage product, in particular an infused beverage product, such as tea, is obtained by immersion of a beverage bag in a beverage liquid.<br>
Beverage products are commonly supplied for consumption in disposable cups, these cups often being provided with a lid to prevent spillage, such as when carried. Also, where the beverage product is a hot product, the lid acts to maintain the temperature of the beverage product.<br>
Conventional lids are inadequate for use with beverage bag units, as the drawstring has to pass between the lid and the cup, thus breaking the seal as normally provided by the lid, and requiring the lid to be removed in order to remove the beverage bag on attainment of a beverage product at the required strength.<br>
More recently, a lid has been developed for use with a tea bag which includes a cross-shaped slit through which the drawstring is threaded, such that, following a required infusion, the drawstring is drawn up through the slit to cause the tea bag to be drawn into the slit and be held captive thereby.<br>
This lid still, however, suffers from a number of disadvantages. Notably, the drawstring has to be pre-threaded, both because it is particularly difficult to thread the drawstring through the slit, akin to threading the eye of a needle but where the slit does not present an aperture, and because the tab, which is provided to the drawstring to allow a user to raise the tea bag, has to be attached to the drawstring following threading. In addition, as the drawstring is a tight fit in the slit, the tea bag cannot be repeatedly dunked in the<br>
•2<br><br><br>
beverage, as required to obtain a strong infusion. Furthermore, in requiring the tea bag to be forcibly drawn up into the slit, the tea bag can be ruptured by the sharp edges of the slit, leading undesirably to the leakage of tea leaves into the cup, and the drawstring can even be separated from the tea bag, which could occur prior to the tea bag being held captive in the slit and lead to the tea bag remaining in the cup and providing for over-infused tea.<br>
It is thus an aim of the present invention to provide an improved lid for use with a beverage bag unit, in particular a lid which allows for the drawstring of the beverage bag unit to be attached easily to the lid, and the beverage bag of the beverage bag unit to be squeezed and held clear of the beverage product on attainment of a beverage product at a required strength.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a lid for a cup which provides for use of a beverage bag unit comprising a beverage bag and a drawstring connected to the beverage bag, the lid comprising: a flange for attachment to a cup; and a body unit comprising a body section including an aperture through which the drawstring is slideable, at least one wing member which.is hinged to the body section and operable, with the lid fitted to the cup, by a finger and/or thumb of a user to allow the user to squeeze and/or hold the beverage bag when in a raised position.<br>
Preferably, the lid is provided with first and second wing members which are operable by ones of fingers or a finger and a thumb of a user.<br>
Preferably, the flange is configured to provide a fluid-tight seal with a cup.<br>
Preferably, the aperture is sized such that the drawstring Is freely slideable therein.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the beverage bag unit comprises a tab provided to the drawstring, and the aperture is sized such that the tab can be threaded therethrough.<br>
Preferably, the body section includes a drinking spout. However, alternatively, a drinking spout may be formed by operation of one of the wing members.<br>
Preferably, the" at least one wing member" is resiliently hinged to the body section.<br>
In one embodiment there are two wing members hinged to a central region of the body section such as to be hinged in opposite senses on operation of the same.<br>
Preferably, at least one wing member is attached to the body section by a hinge element about which the same is hinged on operation of the wing member, and a perforated connection which is broken on operation of the wing member.<br>
Preferably, at least one wing member is recessed such as to receive a finger and/or thumb of the user.<br>
In one embodiment at least one wing member comprises an engagement element which can engage another such element when the wing member Is in a hinged configuration following squeezing of the beverage bag, such as to lock the wing member in the hinged configuration and thereby hold the beverage bag in a raised position.<br>
Preferably, the engagement element on one wing member comprises a projection and the other such element comprises a recess, with locking being achieved by frictional engagement of the same.<br>
4<br>
I<br><br>
Preferably, there are first and second wing members, and the wing members include counterpart engagement elements which engage one another when the wing members are in a hinged configuration following squeezing of the beverage bag, such as to lock the wing members in the hinged configuration and thereby hold the beverage bag in the raised position.<br>
In another embodiment" the body unit includes a drawstring locking element which provides for locking of the drawstring when the beverage bag is in the raised position, such as to hold the beverage bag in the raised position.<br>
Preferably, the body unit comprises an upstanding wall member, a lower edge of which is connected to the flange, and a closure member which extends inwardly of an upper edge of the wall member and comprises the body section and the at least one wing member.<br>
