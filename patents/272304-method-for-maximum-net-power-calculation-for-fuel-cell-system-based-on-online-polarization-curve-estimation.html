				<td>METHOD FOR MAXIMUM NET POWER CALCULATION FOR FUEL CELL<br>
SYSTEM BASED ON ONLINE POLARIZATION CURVE ESTIMATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	This invention relates generally to an algorithm for<br>
determining the maximum power available from a fuel cell stack as the stack<br>
degrades over time and, more particularly, to an algorithm for determining the<br>
maximum power available from a fuel cell stack using an online polarization<br>
curve estimation process as the stack degrades over time.<br>
2.	Discussion of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	Hydrogen is a very attractive fuel because it is clean and<br>
can be used to efficiently produce electricity in a fuel cell. A hydrogen fuel cell<br>
is an electro-chemical device that includes an anode and a cathode with an<br>
electrolyte therebetween. The anode receives hydrogen gas and the cathode<br>
receives oxygen or air. The hydrogen gas is dissociated in the anode to<br>
generate free hydrogen protons and electrons. The hydrogen protons pass<br>
through the electrolyte to the cathode. The hydrogen protons react with the<br>
oxygen and the electrons in the cathode to generate water. The electrons<br>
from the anode cannot pass through the electrolyte, and thus are directed<br>
through a load to perform work before being sent to the cathode.<br>
[0003]	Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are a<br>
popular fuel cell for vehicles. The PEMFC generally includes a solid polymer<br>
electrolyte proton conducting membrane, such as a perfluorosulfonic acid<br>
membrane. The anode and cathode typically include finely divided catalytic<br>
particles, usually platinum (Pt), supported on carbon particles and mixed with<br>
an ionomer. The catalytic mixture is deposited on opposing sides of the<br>
membrane. The combination of the anode catalytic mixture, the cathode<br>
catalytic mixture and the membrane define a membrane electrode assembly<br>
(MEA). MEAs are relatively expensive to manufacture and require certain<br>
conditions for effective operation.<br>
 <br>
[0004]	Several fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell<br>
stack to generate the desired power. The fuel cell stack receives a cathode<br>
input gas, typically a flow of air forced through the stack by a compressor.<br>
Not all of the oxygen is consumed by the stack and some of the air is output<br>
as a cathode exhaust gas that may include water as a stack by-product. The<br>
fuel cell stack also receives an anode hydrogen input gas that flows into the<br>
anode side of the stack.<br>
[0005] The stack controller needs to know the current/voltage<br>
relationship, referred to as a polarization curve, of the fuel cell stack to<br>
schedule reactants in accordance with power demands. The relationship<br>
between the voltage and the current of the stack is typically difficult to define<br>
because it is non-linear, and changes depending on many variables, including<br>
stack temperature, stack partial pressures and cathode and anode<br>
stoichiometries. Additionally, the relationship between the stack current and<br>
voltage changes as the stack degrades over time. Particularly, an older stack<br>
will have lower cell voltages, and will need to provide more current to meet the<br>
power demands than a new, non-degraded stack.<br>
[0006] Fortunately, many fuel cell systems, once they are above<br>
a certain temperature, tend to have repeatable operating conditions at a given<br>
current density. In those instances, the voltage can be approximately<br>
described as a function of stack current density and age.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	In accordance with the teachings of the present invention,<br>
an algorithm is disclosed for determining the maximum net power available<br>
from a fuel cell as the fuel cell stack degrades over time using an online<br>
adaptive estimation of a polarization curve of the stack. The algorithm first<br>
obtains estimation parameters from the fuel cell system, such as average cell<br>
voltage and minimum cell voltage, and estimates a polarization curve for the<br>
stack for both an average cell voltage and a minimum cell voltage,<br>
respectively. The algorithm then calculates the maximum power available<br>
from the stack for both the average cell voltage and the minimum cell voltage<br>
 <br>
from the polarization curve estimation. To do this, the algorithm separates the<br>
current density range of the stack into sample regions, and selects a first<br>
sample region from the far left of the estimated polarization curve. The<br>
algorithm then calculates the cell voltage for that current density sample<br>
region, and determines whether the calculated cell voltage is less than or<br>
equal to a predetermined cell voltage limit. If the calculated cell voltage is not<br>
less than the cell voltage limit, then the algorithm selects the next sample<br>
region along the polarization curve. When the calculated cell voltage does<br>
reach the cell voltage limit, then the algorithm uses that current density for the<br>
sample region being analyzed to calculate the maximum power of the fuel cell<br>
stack. The algorithm then selects the lesser of the maximum power for both<br>
the average cell voltage and the minimum cell voltage as the maximum fuel<br>
cell system output voltage.<br>

apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013]	The following discussion of the embodiments of the<br>
invention directed to an algorithm for determining the maximum net power<br>
available from a fuel cell system as the fuel cell stack degrades over time<br>
using an online polarization curve estimation process is merely exemplary in<br>
nature, and is in no way intended to limit the invention or it's applications or<br>
uses.<br>
[0014]	Many control parameters of a fuel cell system require<br>
knowledge of the polarization curve of the fuel cell stack, such as knowing the<br>
maximum voltage potential and current draw available from the fuel cell stack.<br>
As mentioned above, as the stack ages, the stack polarization curve also<br>
changes as a result of stack degradation. U.S. Patent Application serial No.<br>
11/669,898, filed January 31, 2007, titled Algorithm for Online Adaptive<br>
Polarization Curve Estimation of a Fuel Cell Stack, assigned to the Assignee<br>
of this Application and herein incorporated by reference, discloses an<br>
algorithm for calculating the polarization curve of a fuel cell stack online as the<br>
fuel cell system is being operated. The algorithm of the '898 application<br>
estimates two or more stack parameters from collected data as the stack is<br>
being operated, and uses the parameters to calculate the polarization curve.<br>
When the fuel cell stack is running and certain data validity criteria have been<br>
met, the algorithm goes into a good collection mode where it collects stack<br>
data, such as stack current density, average cell voltage and minimum cell<br>
voltage. When the stack is shut-down, the algorithm uses a cell voltage<br>
model to solve a non-linear least squares problem to estimate predetermined<br>
parameters that define the polarization curve. If the estimated parameters<br>
satisfy certain termination criteria, then the estimated parameters are stored<br>
to be used by a system controller to calculate the polarization curve of the<br>
stack for future stack runs.<br>
[0015]	The present invention proposes an algorithm for<br>
determining the maximum net power available from a fuel cell stack using an<br>
online polarization curve estimation process, such as that disclosed in the<br>
 <br>
'898 application. The algorithm uses previously saved estimation parameters<br>
to generate the polarization curve online, and calculates a maximum net<br>
power from the system based on stack health. As the parameters vary with<br>
the life of the stack, so does the maximum net power. The algorithm provides<br>
the vehicle controller with an estimate of the maximum power available from<br>
the stack. It can use this information to change the way it distributes power<br>
requests to the battery and the fuel cell stack.<br>
[0016]	From this, the reliability of the fuel cell system is<br>
improved if the vehicle does not request more power from the stack than it<br>
can produce. For example, assume a fuel cell module can typically provide<br>
90 kW, but stack voltage has degraded so that it can only provide 80 kW. If<br>
85 kW is requested, the balance of plant set-points will go to 85 kW even<br>
though the stack cannot produce that much power. Further, information of<br>
predicted maximum power level will be available for service personnel if the<br>
stack needs servicing. If the maximum power level is significantly degraded,<br>
the fuel cell system can modify set-points to enhance vehicle reliability.<br>
During system start-up, the rate at which the stack is initially loaded CAN be<br>
reduced as a result of a reduced power output. Although it will take longer for<br>
the vehicle to drive away, the risk of failed start-ups is reduced. Further, extra<br>
thermal loads can be turned on when the fuel cell system is warming up. A<br>
degraded stack often has a reduced ability to manage liquid water. Additional<br>
stack warming will quickly reduce the risk of unstable operation. If the stack is<br>
heavily degraded, relative humidity set-points can be modified to better<br>
manage liquid water.<br>
[0017]	Figure 1 is a block diagram of a fuel cell system 10<br>
including a first split stack 12, a second split stack 14 and a controller 16. The<br>
controller 16 receives information from the split stacks 12 and 14, and controls<br>
the split stacks 12 and 14. The controller 16 uses the information to calculate<br>
the polarization curve of the stacks 12 and 14 in real time, and provide the<br>
maximum net power available from the stacks 12 and 14.<br>
[0018]	In order to determine the maximum net power from the<br>
fuel cell stacks 12 and 14, the present invention uses the average cell voltage<br>
 <br>
of the stacks 12 and 14 and the minimum cell voltage of the stacks 12 and 14.<br>
Figure 2 is a graph with current density on the horizontal axis and voltage on<br>
the vertical axis. The graph includes two polarization curves, namely<br>
polarization curve 20 for the average cell voltage and polarization curve 22 for<br>
the minimum cell voltage. Point 24 represents the maximum current (or<br>
current density) available from the stacks 12 and 14 for the average cell<br>
polarization curve and point 26 represents the maximum current available<br>
from the stacks 12 and 14 for the minimum cell polarization curve 22.<br>
[0019]	Figure 3 is a flow chart diagram 40 showing a process of<br>
the invention for determining the maximum net fuel cell stack output power at<br>
any given time during fuel cell operation, and the applications for which this<br>
calculated power value can be used. At box 42, the algorithm obtains the<br>
parameters from a non-volatile memory that are used to estimate the<br>
polarization curves for the stacks 12 and 14 from, for example, the process<br>
disclosed in the '898 application. Further, the algorithm sets an average cell<br>
voltage limit at box 42 and a minimum cell voltage limit at<br>
box 44. In one non-limiting example, the average cell voltage limit can be<br>
about 0.525 V and the minimum cell voltage limit can be about 0.3 V for a 230<br>
V, 440 cell fuel cell stack. The algorithm then calculates the maximum net<br>
power available from the fuel cell stacks 12 and 14 using the average cell<br>
voltage limit at box 42 and calculates the maximum power using the<br>
minimum cell voltage limit at box 46.<br>
[0020]	Figure 4 is a flow chart diagram 50 showing a process<br>
for determining the maximum net power for both the average cell voltage and<br>
the minimum cell voltage, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The process starts at the far left of the polarization curves 20 and<br>
22 and moves down along the curves 20 and 22 until the average cell voltage<br>
limit and the minimum cell voltage limit at points 24 and 26<br>
are reached. At box 52, the algorithm divides the current density range of the<br>
stacks 12 and 14 into N sample regions, where k identifies the specific sample<br>
region being analyzed. In one non-limiting example, the current density range<br>
 <br>
can be 0.1 - 2.0 A/cm2 and the sample regions can be every 0.1 A/cm2. The<br>
algorithm then obtains a current density j for the sample region being<br>
examined, and calculates the cell voltage at that current density j for both the<br>
average cell voltage and the minimum cell voltage using the polarization<br>
curves 20 and 22. In one non-limiting example, the cell voltage at the specific<br>
current density is calculated as:<br>
 <br>
Where, is the cell voltage (V),<br>
j is the current density (A/cm2),<br>
RHFR is the cell HFR resistance (ohm cm2),<br>
is the thermodynamic reversible cell potential (V),<br>
 is the background current density from cell shorting/cell crossover (A/cm2),<br>
 is the exchange current density (A/cm2),<br>
is the limiting current density (A/cm2), and<br>
is the mass transfer coefficient.<br>
[0021]	Once the cell voltage is calculated, the algorithm<br>
determines whether the calculated cell voltage for that current density j is<br>
less than the predetermined cell voltage limit or at<br>
decision diamond 56 and, if not, the algorithm moves to the next sample<br>
region k at box 58 to calculate the average cell voltage and the minimum cell<br>
voltage at the box 54 for the new higher current density j. If the calculated cell<br>
voltage is less than or equal to the cell voltage limit or at<br>
the decision diamond 56, then the algorithm sets the current density j for the<br>
particular sample region as the maximum current density, and calculates the<br>
maximum power at box 60. The gross power is calculated as voltage times<br>
current where the maximum current density j is multiplied by the number of<br>
cells and the area of the cells to get the total current of the stacks<br>
12 and 14. Further, a parasitic power estimation based current density<br>
 <br>
(provided by a look-up table or suitable parasitic estimation algorithm) is<br>
subtracted from the power and a correction is added to get the maximum net<br>
power as:<br>
 <br>
[0022]	The gross power is how much the stack is producing and<br>
the net power is the gross power minus the parasitic power to operate the fuel<br>
cell system, such as operating the compressor, cooling fluid pumps, etc.<br>
Typically, tables are generated where the parasitic power is defined for a<br>
particular current density j based on experiments and the like. The correction<br>
is typically determined empirically and is generally around 5% of the<br>
maximum power.<br>
[0023]	Once the algorithm has the maximum net power for<br>
the average cell voltage and the minimum cell voltage for both of the stacks<br>
12 and 14, the algorithm determines the maximum fuel cell system net power<br>
as the minimum of the two maximum net powers for each stack 12<br>
and 14 at box 62 in the flow chart diagram 40.<br>
[0024]	Another non-limiting embodiment for calculation of<br>
maximum net power, which can be applied to N number of stacks, can be<br>
given by:<br>
min(max(AvgCellPowerEstimations), min(MinCellPowerEstimations))<br>
[0025]	Once the algorithm has the maximum net power <br>
that can be drawn from the stacks 12 and 14 at any particular time, this value<br>
is then used in various applications in the fuel cell system 10, such as<br>
predicting the number of hours before the end of life of the stacks 12 and 14<br>
at box 64, sending the maximum power to the fuel cell power system at box<br>
66, providing an energy estimate for acceptable drivability at box 68 and using<br>
the maximum power in adaptive control applications at box 70.<br>
 <br>

art will readily recognize from such discussion and from the accompanying<br>

range if the cell voltage is not less than the average cell voltage limit or the<br>
minimum cell voltage limit;<br>
means for calculating a maximum net power for both the<br>
average cell voltage and the minimum cell voltage if the cell voltage is less<br>
than the average cell voltage limit and the minimum cell voltage limit; and<br>
means for selecting the less of the average cell voltage<br>
maximum net power and the minimum cell voltage maximum net power as a<br>
maximum stack power.<br>
16.	The system according to claim 15 wherein the means for<br>
calculating the net power includes means for calculating the net power as the<br>
maximum cell voltage times the overall current density times the number of<br>
fuel cells times the area of the fuel cells of the fuel cell stack minus<br>
predetermined parasitic power that are used while running the fuel cell<br>
system.<br>
17.	The system according to claim 15 wherein the average cell<br>
voltage limit is about 0.525 V and the minimum cell voltage limit is about 0.3<br>
V.<br>
18.	The system according to claim 15 wherein separating a current<br>
density range of the fuel cell stack into a predetermined number of sample<br>
 <br>

sample regions of 0.1 A/cm2.<br>
19.	The system according to claim 15 wherein the fuel cell stack is a<br>
split fuel cell stack where the maximum stack power is determined for both<br>
spilt stacks.<br>
20.	The system according to claim 15 wherein the means for<br>
selecting a next sample region in the current density range includes means for<br>
selecting the next sample region in order from a low current density in the<br>
range to a high current density in the range.<br>
<br>
An algorithm for determining the maximum net power available from a<br>
fuel cell stack as the stack degrades over time using an online adaptive<br>
estimation of a polarization curve of the stack. The algorithm separates the<br>
current density range of the stack into sample regions, and selects a first<br>
sample region from the far left of the estimated polarization curve. The<br>
algorithm then calculates the cell voltage for that current density sample<br>
region, and determines whether the calculated cell voltage is less than or<br>
equal to a predetermined cell voltage limit. If the calculated cell voltage is not<br>
less than the cell voltage limit, then the algorithm selects the next sample<br>
region along the polarization curve. When the calculated cell voltage does<br>
reach the cell voltage limit, then the algorithm uses that current density for the<br>
sample region being analyzed to calculate the maximum power of the fuel cell<br>
stack.</td>
