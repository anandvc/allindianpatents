LEVER MECHANISM, PARTICULARLY FOR A SCALE RECEIVER OF A SCALE THAT<br>
WORKS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE<br>
COMPENSATION<br>
The invention relates to a lever mechanism, particularly for a scale receiver of a scale that<br>
works on the principle of electromagnetic force compensation, with the characteristics of the<br>
preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Lever mechanisms and scales that work on the principle of electromagnetic force<br>
compensation, and scale receivers appropriate for them, are known in numerous embodiments of<br>
great variety. To obtain a very accurate weighing signal, monolithic scale receivers are usually<br>
used, which present, compared to non-monolithic scale receivers, the advantage, among others,<br>
of excellent long-term stability. A multi-piece assembly, for example, made of steel springs, as<br>
described in DE 100 13 311 Al, is no longer used by the leading manufacturers in scale<br>
technology and can be considered "obsolete technology."<br>
Monolithic scale receivers can be manufactured in different ways, particularly by milling<br>
or erosive processing. DE 199 23 207 CI shows, for example, a complex three-dimensional<br>
structure, where the desired high magnification ratio is implemented with three successively<br>
arranged angular levers. To reduce the construction size, in this structure, certain levers or lever<br>
arms or coupling elements are distributed symmetrically with respect to a projecting part of the<br>
stationary base body, which protrudes between these levers or lever arms or coupling elements.<br>
The protruding part of the base body here also forms a support for certain levers or lever arms or<br>
coupling elements. In spite of the complexity of this structure, it is chosen so that it can be<br>
manufactured monolithically in one body.<br>
On the other hand, an erosive manufacture of a monolithic scale receiver as a rule allows<br>
only a two-dimensional structure. A scale receiver manufactured in this way is represented, for<br>
example, in EP 0 518 202 Bl. This describes an embodiment of a ternary magnifying scale<br>
receiver, where the last lever arm of the last of the three series-connected levers can be screwed<br>
laterally to the monolithically manufactured base body.<br>
US 2002/0038729 Al describes an assembled scale receiver with two magnifying stages,<br>
where a monolithically manufactured structure, which implements the two levers, is inserted in<br>
an also monolithically manufactured parallel drive rod structure and is connected to the latter.<br>
However, the problem with all these known monolithically manufactured magnifying<br>
structures of scale receivers is that several series-connected levers are required to implement<br>
high magnifying ratios, because the articulations that form the given swivel axis for the lever in<br><br>
2<br>
question cannot be moved as close as possible, for manufacturing/technical reasons, to the<br>
positions in which the force has to be transmitted to the shorter lever arm, i.e., as a rule, the<br>
position in which the load force is to be transmitted to the lever. Thus, in known structures, the<br>
shorter lever arms cannot be reduced below a certain minimum value, which is a function of the<br>
geometry of the structure and of the finishing/technical parameters, for example, a function of<br>
the milling diameter required to generate an articulation-thin place in the monolithic material<br>
block or an available minimum milling diameter. Therefore, achieving a desired high<br>
magnification ratio necessarily requires an elongation of the longer lever arm. If this is not<br>
possible due to a preexisting maximum geometric expansion of the scale receiver in this spatial<br>
axis, then the only remaining possibility to achieve the desired magnification ratio is in-series<br>
connection of several levers.<br>
However, in the implementation of a large magnification ratio, one must also take into<br>
consideration that correspondingly large forces are transmitted via the articulation to the<br>
stationary base body. Each elastically deformable articulation therefore must be of appropriately<br>
resistant design, particularly with regard to traction and/or pressure resistance. However, this<br>
leads, on the other hand, to high resistance to movement of the lever about the desired rotation<br>
axis, i.e., the elastically deformable articulation presents a high spring constant compared to the<br>
rotation motion about the desired rotation axis, so that, for this reason as well, magnification<br>
ratios of any desired magnitude cannot be achieved with a single lever.<br>
Moreover, the known structures present the drawback of low stiffness of the elastically<br>
deformable articulation, which forms the swivel axis of a lever, in the translation direction<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal extension plane of the articulation and in the rotation direction<br>
about axes parallel to the longitudinal extension direction of the articulation. In the case of<br>
undesired static or dynamic forces (generated by undesired accelerations, for example,<br>
vibrations), this leads to decreases in the measurement accuracy.<br>
In practice, such an elastically deformable articulation presents a width (which does not<br>
necessarily have to be constant, although it is frequently constant to simplify the manufacture)<br>
that is larger by a multiple than the thinnest place (in the spatial axis perpendicular to the width<br>
of the articulation-defining spatial axis, where the thickness of the thinnest place will as a rule be<br>
constant over the entire width of the articulation), where the deformation for the generation of<br>
the swivel motion of the lever occurs by bending the articulation about an axis that runs parallel<br>
to the pathway of the thinnest place of the articulation. The bending area thus defines a<br>
longitudinal extension plane, where the bending motion occurs perpendicularly to this<br>
longitudinal extension plane.<br><br>
3<br>
Such a lever mechanism can naturally not be used for a scale receiver, but in application<br>
cases or devices where the magnification, reduction, or simple transmission of a force or of a<br>
motion between an input of the mechanism and an output of the mechanism is required.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the problem of producing a lever mechanism that<br>
presents a reduced sensitivity to undesired static and dynamic forces or accelerations in spatial<br>
directions and rotational directions, which do not correspond to the rotation direction of the<br>
desired swivel motions of the lever(s) of the lever mechanism, and that allows, with a smaller<br>
construction size, a higher magnification or reduction of the force or of the stroke path.<br>
The invention solves this problem with the characteristics of Claim 1.<br>
The invention is based on the knowledge that an elastically deformable articulation,<br>
which comprises two elastically deformable bending areas, whose longitudinal extension planes<br>
enclose an angle that is not equal to zero, preferably an angle in the range from 45 to 135°,<br>
presents, in the above explained translation and rotation axes, a considerably improved stiffness<br>
compared to articulations that consist in the known way of only a single bending area.<br>
While in known, monolithically constructed scale receivers or their lever mechanisms the<br>
longitudinal extension plane of the single bending area of the elastically deformable articulation<br>
is always chosen to be parallel to the direction of the load force acting in each case on the lever<br>
to maintain as defined as possible a rotation axis for the swivel motion of the lever, the<br>
arrangement of the two bending areas of the articulation structure according to the invention can<br>
be chosen relatively freely. In each case, the result is a defined position of the rotation axis for<br>
the swivel motion of the lever in question.<br>
Reference is made here to the fact that the at least one lever of the lever mechanism does<br>
not have to be connected directly to the base body or firm ground. A structure can also be<br>
provided where one lever is connected by means of the elastically deformable articulation to an<br>
element that is connected to the base body, for example, to an additional, pre-connected lever.<br>
According to an embodiment, the two elastically deformable bending areas can present a<br>
width which is large compared to the thickness of the bending area in question at, in each case,<br>
its thinnest place in the direction perpendicular to the given longitudinal extension planes. The<br>
result is an improved bending stiffness of each individual bending area with respect to a bending<br>
stress about an axis that is perpendicular to the longitudinal extension plane in question. Due to<br>
the arrangement of the longitudinal extension planes of the two bending areas with an angle that<br>
is not equal to zero degrees, the resulting bending stiffness about all the axes, with the exception<br>
of the desired rotation axis for the swivel motions of the lever, is improved compared to a single<br>
bending area. The swivel motion is in fact markedly greater due to the proportional reception of<br>
the rotation forces by the two bending areas in the form of traction and pressure stresses than<br>
would be the case if the bending stiffnesses of the two bending areas about their longitudinal<br><br>
4<br>
extension direction were added. As a result, the lever mechanism or the device that presents such<br>
a lever mechanism is drastically less sensitive to interfering forces or interfering accelerations,<br>
which are generated, for example, by corresponding movements of the lever mechanism or of the<br>
entire device, for example, shaking, vibration, etc.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the bending areas are formed<br>
symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal extension plane in question. In this way, a simpler<br>
design is achieved because such structures can in practice be developed merely with numerical<br>
methods today, and, on the other hand, the manufacture of such a structure becomes simpler,<br>
particularly in a machining or milling manufacture.<br>
In the calculation of a whole series of different structures, it has been found that,<br>
particularly in articulation structures according to the invention that are designed symmetrically<br>
with respect to the longitudinal extension planes, the virtual swivel axis of the at least one lever<br>
is identical to the intersection line of the two longitudinal extension planes, or runs parallel to<br>
said line and presents a very small separation from it. Based on this knowledge, the design of<br>
such structures is made easier or simplified.<br>
If the two bending areas that form the elastically deformable articulation are designed<br>
such that the bending direction (or the swivel axis) of each individual bending area is established<br>
by providing a straight-line, thinnest place, then the swivel axes obviously have to run parallel.<br>
According to an embodiment, the bending areas can be provided such that the plane that<br>
bisects the angle, that is enclosed by the longitudinal extension planes, and that also runs through<br>
the virtual swivel axis or the intersection line of the two longitudinal extension planes, runs<br>
perpendicularly to the direction of the load force. This geometry offers the advantage that the<br>
position of the virtual swivel axis relative to the position of the engagement points of the load<br>
force or of the reaction force can be determined by appropriate selection and establishment of the<br>
angle that is enclosed by the longitudinal extension planes. In particular, it is possible to allow<br>
the short lever arm to become very small, and thus generate a large magnification ratio.<br>
According to another embodiment, the bending areas can also be provided such that the<br>
plane that bisects the angle enclosed by the longitudinal extension planes, where said planes also<br>
run through the virtual swivel axis, runs parallel to the direction of the load force.<br>
In an overall or at least to an appropriate extent monolithically constructed scale receiver,<br>
the load force can be transmitted over an additional thin, elastically deformable bending area to<br>
the lever, where the bending area is designed such that its longitudinal extension plane, in which<br>
the direction of the force transmission runs, runs parallel to the virtual swivel axis. If the bending<br>
direction of the bending area or the swivel axis in question is defined by a straight-line, thinnest<br>
place, then this swivel axis must run parallel to the virtual swivel axis of the lever in question.<br><br>
5<br>
The bending area for transmitting the load force can here be provided such that, if needed<br>
(i.e., if appropriate forces occur), an elastic bending of the bending area in the area of the<br>
intersection line of the longitudinal extension plane with the plane defined by the imagined lever<br>
arm and the virtual swivel axis occurs. The imagined lever arm here is determined as the<br>
separation between the virtual swivel axis and the longitudinal extension plane of the bending<br>
area.<br>
This geometry has the advantage that if forces occur that lead to a bending of the bending<br>
area, by which the load force is introduced, and thus lead to a change in the direction in which<br>
the load force is introduced on the lever, the (imagined) lever arm remains substantially constant.<br>
Naturally, the reaction force can also be transmitted by an additional thin, elastic<br>
deformable bending area to the lever, where the bending area is designed so that its longitudinal<br>
extension plane, in which the direction of the force transmission runs, runs parallel to the virtual<br>
swivel axis. If the bending direction or the swivel axis of the bending area is defined again as a<br>
straight-line, thinnest place, then this swivel axis as well must run parallel to the virtual swivel<br>
axis of the lever in question.<br>
This bending area for the transmission of the reaction force can here also be provided<br>
such that, if needed (i.e., if corresponding forces occur), an elastic bending of the bending area in<br>
the area of the intersection line of the longitudinal extension plane with the plane defined by the<br>
imagined lever arm and the virtual swivel axis occurs. The imagined lever arm is here again<br>
determined as the separation of the virtual swivel axis from the longitudinal extension plane of<br>
the bending area. As explained above in connection with a corresponding introduction of the<br>
load force, the result is again the advantage of a lever arm that is independent of the angle of the<br>
introduction of the reaction force.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, one or both bending areas of the elastically<br>
deformed articulation can be connected via a coupling element to the base body.<br>
Here, it is preferred to provide, between the coupling element and the base body, an<br>
additional bending area, whose longitudinal extension plane is identical with the longitudinal<br>
extension plane of the bending area of the elastically deformable articulation, with which the<br>
coupling element is connected to the lever.<br>
Additional embodiment variants can be obtained from the dependent claims.<br>

[sic; 9].<br>
The scale receiver 1 represented in Figure 1 is of monolithic design. In this form, it can<br>
be manufactured, for example, by machining processing of a material block, particularly by<br>
milling and boring. The scale receiver 1 comprises a base body 3 that can be mounted, for<br>
example, rigidly in the housing of a scale. The base body 3 is connected to a load receiving<br>
element 7 via two arms or parallel linkers 5 that run parallel, where the arms 5 in each case are<br>
connected via an elastically deformable articulation 9 to the stationary base body 3 and the load<br>
receiving element 7. The load receiving element 7 can be connected to a receiving device for a<br>
material (not shown) to be weighed.<br>
A weight FG acting on the load receiving element 7 leads to a deflection of the parallel<br>
linkers 5 and to a movement of the load receiving element 7 in the direction of the weight force 7<br>
[sic; FG].<br>
The load-receiving element 7 is coupled via a coupling element 11 to-the shorter lever<br>
arm of a first lever 13 of a two-stage lever mechanism 15. The coupling occurs in turn in each<br>
case by an elastically deformable articulation 17 at both ends of the coupling element 11. As can<br>
be seen in Figure 2, the coupling element 11 in the represented embodiment extends over the<br><br>
7<br>
entire width of the scale receiver 1. The lever 13 is connected via an elastically deformable<br>
articulation 19, which also extends over the entire width of the scale receiver 1, to an area 21 that<br>
protrudes between the parallel linkers 5 (Figure 2) of the base body 3. The longer lever arm of<br>
the lever 13 narrows starting from the entire width in the vicinity of the articulation 19 until it<br>
reaches its end area in such a way that it can be coupled, via a coupling element 25 that is<br>
arranged inside the width of the scale receiver 1 laterally next to the protruding area 21 of the<br>
base body 3, with the shorter lever arm of a second lever 23. This second lever 23 is designed as<br>
a single-arm lever. The coupling occurs in turn in each case by an elastically deformable<br>
articulation 27 provided at the ends of the coupling element 25. The lever 23 or its longer lever<br>
arm is guided laterally past the base body 3 into its end area. If one uses the scale receiver here in<br>
a scale that works on the principle of electromagnetic force compensation, then the device can be<br>
used for the generation of the weighing signal (not shown).<br>
The lever 23 is coupled via an articulation 28, which can be called a star articulation, with<br>
the protruding area 21 of the base body. The star articulation, whose structure, functioning and<br>
additional properties are explained below, presents, in comparison to a simple elastically<br>
deformable articulation, a drastically improved stiffness in all spatial directions and rotation<br>
directions with the exception of the desired rotation direction to allow the swivel motion of the<br>
lever 23. As a result, the one-sided design of the second lever 23 is made possible and<br>
simultaneously a high measurement accuracy and long-term stability of the scale receiver 1, as<br>
well as a high insensitivity to undesired static and dynamic interfering forces that act from<br>
outside on the scale receiver 1, are ensured.<br>
The principle of the star articulation 28 is represented in Figure 3. The load force FL,<br>
which acts via the coupling element 25 on the short lever arm of the lever 23, where said load<br>
force is obtained particularly from the weight force FG, the lever ratio of the first lever 13, and<br>
the properties of the elastically deformable articulations 9 and 19, would effect a swivel motion<br>
of the lever 23 about a virtual swivel axis D, without the generation on the longer lever arm of a<br>
reaction force FR acting as a counterweight of the lever, for example, by means of an installation<br>
for electromagnetic force compensation.<br>
The virtual swivel axis D in such complicated structures can today in practice be<br>
determined only by numerical means. Corresponding examinations have shown that the virtual<br>
swivel axis D is identical to the intersection line of the longitudinal extension planes of the<br>
bending areas 29 of the star articulation 28 (or at the very most presents a small separation from<br>
the intersection line), by means of which the lever 23 are [sic] coupled via the coupling elements<br>
31 with a firm ground, i.e., the base body 3. The coupling of the coupling elements 31 with a<br>
firm ground occurs here in turn via bending areas 33 whose longitudinal extension planes are<br>
identical to the longitudinal extension planes of the bending areas 29.<br><br>
8<br>
Because the longitudinal extension planes enclose an angle a, the star articulation 28<br>
presents a clearly improved stiffness in all translation spatial directions x, y, z, compared to a<br>
simple, elastically deformable articulation, which presents only a single bending area. In<br>
addition, the result is a drastically improved stiffness against rotation movements about the x<br>
axis and the y axis, because corresponding rotation forces in a substantial proportion are taken up<br>
as traction and pressure forces in the bending areas 29 and 33 and not only as shearing forces, as<br>
in the case of the connection of the lever 23 via a single bending area, whose longitudinal<br>
extension plane runs parallel to the direction of the introduction of the load force FL (this<br>
pathway of the longitudinal extension plane is obligatory in the case of the use of a single<br>
bending area, because otherwise the resulting swivel axis is not sufficiently defined).<br>
In the structure of a star articulation 28 represented in Figure 3, the thin places or bending<br>
areas 27 and 29 can be manufactured in a simple way by a machining process, for example, by<br>
boring. For this purpose, only five bores are required, because the facing surfaces of the thin<br>
places 29 can be manufactured with a single bore. Alternatively, it is obviously (as also in the<br>
case of all the other embodiment examples) possible to generate the structure with the help of<br>
thin cuts (erosive processing).<br>
It is also possible to manufacture the mutually facing surfaces of the thin places 29 and<br>
27 with a single bore. However, here the position of the introduction of the load force FL can no<br>
longer be chosen freely, rather it is a function of the diameter of the bore. The lever ratio can be<br>
set to the desired value by the selection of the position of the virtual swivel axis D and the length<br>
of the longer lever arm.<br>
The position of the virtual lever axis can, in the structure of the star articulation according<br>
to Figure 3, be set by the appropriate selection of the angle a between the longitudinal extension<br>
planes of the bending areas 29. Here, it is clearly apparent in Figure 3 that for smaller angles a<br>
than represented in the drawing, the smaller lever arm will always become smaller and<br>
accordingly the translation ratio will always become larger.<br>
If the angle a falls below a certain value, then the virtual swivel axis comes to be located<br>
in the drawing to the right of the longitudinal extension plane of the bending area 27. In this case,<br>
a two-sided lever is produced, which, in comparison to the single-sided lever represented in<br>
Figure 3, effects a direction reversal of the reaction force FR.<br>
This situation is represented in Figure 4. In this embodiment, the facing surfaces of the<br>
thin places 29 and 27 can be made with a single bore. On the other hand, for the manufacture of<br>
the mutually facing surfaces of the thin places 29, in each case separate bores are required.<br>
Naturally, the lever 23 of the star articulation 28 in Figure 3 can also run or be extended<br>
to the left and, for example, it can be led laterally (in the drawing) to the left past the star<br><br>
9<br>
articulation 28. In this way it is also possible to implement a two-sided lever with the structure<br>
according to Figure 3.<br>
Such a structure is represented in Figure 5. The lever 23 is here implemented as a-two-<br>
sided lever, where the reaction force engages on the left end, not represented, of the lever 23. In<br>
this structure of a star articulation 28, the lever 23 is coupled directly by means of two bending<br>
areas 29 ta.a firm ground, i.e., the stationary base body 3. These bending areas 29 are an<br>
elongated thin place, which is not manufactured simply by two lateral bores. This construction<br>
form is conceived for a space-saving arrangement of the translation lever. The coupling element<br>
provided between the two articulations between the two thin places in the previous embodiments<br>
is therefore completely omitted here. Like a coupling element, which is provided at both ends in<br>
each case via a bending area between the lever and the load receiving element or another pre-<br>
connected lever, the elongated thin place 29 has the advantage that no undesired forces are<br>
transmitted perpendicularly to the longitudinal extension plane of the thin place.<br>
However, the embodiments of the structures represented in Figures 3 and 4 can also be<br>
modified in such a way that the lever 23 in each case is extended to the left. The latter in turn can<br>
be led laterally on the star articulation 28 to the left. However, an embodiment would also be<br>
conceivable in which the two coupling elements or the thin places 29 are in each case slid<br>
vertically upward or downward in the plane of the drawing, so that the support lever can run<br>
between the two thin places 29.<br>
It should be noted here that in all the embodiments the support arm of the lever, i.e., the<br>
lever part on which the given reaction force FR engages, does not have to be embodied<br>
monolithically with the remaining lever. Rather, the entire support arm, or part thereof, can also<br>
be screwed, glued, or attached by any other material or positive connection securing method, in<br>
an appropriate area with the other part of the lever.<br>
Figure 6 shows an additional structure for a star articulation 28, which is similar to the<br>
structure represented in Figure 3. However, this embodiment differs in that the (straight-line)<br>
pathway of the thinnest place of the thin place 27 for the coupling of the coupling element 25 lies<br>
in the intersection line of the longitudinal extension plane of the bending area or of the bending<br>
place 27 with the plane that runs through the virtual swivel axis D and on the plane that stands<br>
perpendicularly on the longitudinal extension plane of the bending area 27. This has the<br>
advantage that if the longitudinal extension plane of the bending area 27 or of the coupling<br>
element 25 tips, the imagined lever arm remains constant.<br>
This applies also to the structure of a star articulation 28, which is represented in Figure<br>
7. Here, the lever 23 is connected via the coupling elements 31 to a firm ground. In this structure,<br>
the plane that bisects the angle a between the longitudinal extension planes of the bending area<br>
29 stands parallel to the longitudinal extension plane of the bending area 27 by means of which<br><br>
10<br>
the load force FL is coupled. The bending area 27 is again arranged such that if there is a tipping<br>
of the longitudinal extension plane and thus of the load introduction direction, the imagined lever<br>
arm does not change.<br>
It should be pointed out that the two bending areas 29 of a star articulation 28 do not<br>
necessarily have to be provided in any symmetrical way with respect to the lever 23, as is the<br>
case in the structures according to Figures 1-7. Rather, the longitudinal extension planes can be<br>
chosen freely in a way that is found to be advantageous for the desired construction form. For<br>
example, one can also choose a bending area 29 whose longitudinal extension plane is parallel to<br>
the longitudinal extension plane of the bending area 27 that introduces the load force and whose<br>
other bending area 29 is such that the result is the virtual swivel axis in the desired position. The<br>
angle a between the two longitudinal extension planes should moreover be chosen such that the<br>
stiffness is sufficiently high in the appropriate spatial or rotation directions.<br>
Figure 8 shows a perspective view of an embodiment in which the bending areas 29 of<br>
the star articulation 28 are offset and adjacent to each other. The longitudinal extension planes<br>
enclose an angle of 90°, where the virtual swivel axis coincides with the straight-line course of<br>
the thinnest place of the bending area 29 whose longitudinal extension plane lies parallel to the<br>
lever 23, coincides with it or is located at a small distance from it. As a result, a low overall<br>
stiffness of this lever translation system is achieved, with maximum safety against possible<br>
overloads.<br>
The structures according to the schematic Figures 3-8 show the multiple possibilities with<br>
which such a star articulation can be used in practice. They allow, even in the case of a one-<br>
sided, asymmetric arrangement of a lever (outside the symmetry plane) of a scale receiver, as<br>
shown in Figures 1 and 2, a compact and stiff construction of the scale receiver where,<br>
simultaneously, a large gear up ratio can be achieved.<br>
Finally, an additional embodiment for a scale receiver is described according to Figures 8<br>
and 9 [sic; 9 and 10], whose lever mechanism presents only a single lever. The scale receiver 1<br>
presents the construction made of the base body 3, the parallel core 5 and the load receiving<br>
element 7, which has already been described in connection with the scale receiver according to<br>
Figures 1 and 2. The load receiving element 7 is connected via a bending area 27, which can be<br>
designed as an elongated bending area (see Figure 5: here the bending areas 29 are designed as<br>
extended bending areas), to a lever 23. The lever 23 is connected via a star articulation 28, which<br>
comprises the coupling element 31 and the corresponding bending areas 29, to the area 21 of the<br>
base body 3 that protrudes between the parallel linkers 5. The structure of the star articulation 28<br>
here corresponds largely to the structure represented in Figure 6, where, as already explained, the<br>
load force is not introduced via a coupling element, but via an elongated thin place 27 on the<br>
lever 23.<br><br>
11<br>
As is apparent from Figure 9, the part 23a of the lever 23, which part is led laterally past<br>
the base body, can be connected by screwing, welding or other appropriate connection forms to<br>
the remaining part of the lever, which is designed to form a single piece with a base body. The<br>
stiffness of the star articulation ensures, in spite of this asymmetric and simple construction, an<br>
excellent measurement accuracy and insensitivity to external interfering forces.<br><br>

The invention relates to a lever mechanism, particularly for a scale receiver of a scale that<br>
works on the principle of electromagnetic force compensation, with at least one lever (23), which<br>
is connected to a stationary base body (3) or an element connected to the latter, where the at least<br>
