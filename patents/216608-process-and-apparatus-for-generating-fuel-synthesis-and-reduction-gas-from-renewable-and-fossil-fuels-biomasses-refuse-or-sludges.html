				<td>The invention relates to a process and an apparatus for generating fuel-, synthesis-md reduction gas from renewable and fossil fuels, other biomasses, refuse or iludges, preferably for pyrolysis products manufactured therefrom according to )atent DE 44 04 673, in which case, if pyrolysis products are employed, these are ieparated to the largest possible extent, prior to being fed to the reactor, into solid ind gaseous products, such as low temperature carbonisation gas and charcoal md are fed to the reactor separately.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention is employed in energy generation, :hemical Industry and metallurgy for a highly efficient generation of fuel-, synthesls-and reduction gas for power engines, synthesis processes, ore reduction and pig iron production.<br>
There exists a relatively large number of gasification processes, which can essentially be classified into the 3 large groups of fixed bed gasification, fluidised bed gasification and entrained flow gasification. For gasification apparatus and in this context, in particular, for apparatus for entrained flow gasification into which group the apparatus according to the invention falls, many compromises must be made with regard to energy questions and gasifying agent requirements. Entrained flow gasifiers involving melting down the mineral components are mostly single-stage operated, i.e. all media participating in the gasification reaction are conveyed to a single reaction chamber. This causes all media to be raised to the high temperature level above the slag melting temperature of the mineral components of the combustibles. This is the case both with reactors comprising a reactor wall which has both fire-proof brick-lining as well as those clad with a cooling screen. In the case of reactors with a cooling screen, as is typical in the case of the GSP entrained flow reactor (see literature [1,2]), a substantial portion of the sensible heat of the gasification- gas is suaendered to the cooled wall. Furthermore, in parallel flow reactors with water quenching of the gasification gas to a water vapour saturation temperature, whether with or without a cooled reactor wall, a very large amount of heat is reduced to a low exergy level. In the case of reactors comprising a cooled<br><br>
inner reactor wall, but also in the case of parallel flow reactors in which the gasification gas leaves the reactor in upward direction and the liquid slag in downward direction, the slag discharge must be kept flowing by means of additional heat or even by additional burners. These measures result in a high oxygen requirement, reduction of the calorific value of the gasification gas and thus in low exergy efficiency levels of the overall gasification. If these precautions are not taken, the function of the gasifier is disturbed as the slag flow cannot be maintained.<br>
In entrained flow reactors operated with oxygen as gasifying agent, in particular, very short residence times of the reaction partners exist. In order to prevent break-through of oxygen in the event of fuel failure, very substantial measuring and monitoring efforts are required.<br>
Entrained flow reactors, supplied with fuel by separate pyrolysis, have the drawback that the pyrolysis products are cooled prior to being fed to the reactor and, besides the heat losses, also require a high expenditure in gas processing and the handling of the liquid products.<br>
The object of the invention to be attained resides in that a process and a reactor are proposed which, compared with the state of the art, operate at a lower average temperature level with a higher exergy efficiency level, generating a gasification gas which is free of hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons (dioxins, furanes), suitable to be used as fuel gas for power generation, as synthesis gas or reduction gas in the same heating stage as the ore reduction.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention process for generating fuel, synthesis and reduction gas from renewable and fossil fuels, other biomasses, refuse or sludges by combustion in a combustor, admixing gaseous oxygen and/or oxygenaceous gases in substoichiometric ratios above the melting temperature of the inorganic portions into CO2- and H20-containing gasifying agents, characterised in that fuel and/or gas is/are caused to spin when entering the combustion chamber, that the liquid mineral components forming during combustion are flung against the essentially vertical combustor wall and that they are separated from the gasifying agents forming in this process; the gasifying agent is guided through a central aperture at the bottom of the combustion chamber into a gasification reactor, forming an immersion jet in the process; the separated liquid components are discharged through the central aperture at the bottom of the combustion chamber, being entrained by the gasifying agent immersion jet as slag droplets, accelerated towards the reactor floor, collected there and discharged by the latter; the gasifying agent is supplied with carbonaceous pulverised fuel in the gasifier, in the course of the ensuing gasification reaction carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide and water vapour to hydrogen; the gas immersion jet deflects above the reactor floor and the generated gasification gas in the upper portion of the reactor is discharged and processed to fuel, synthesis or reduction gas by subsequent dedusting and chemical cleaning.<br>
The solution is attained in that the reactor is so constructed that the physical heat is basically maintained at a high temperature level with only minimal heat losses and is exploited for increasing the chemically combined heat. For this purpose fuel and/or gas is first set into rotation at burning temperature at the entry to the burner, at the entry to the combustion chamber respectively, resulting in that hot slag droplets are flung against the wall, draining off the<br><br>
latter towards a slag trough at the bottom of the combustion chamber. During this process the combustion chamber wall is maintained at such a temperature level that a layer of solidified slag melt forms on it, from which further stag formed drains off, (reflected) gasification gas flowing around its exterior.<br>
The present invention also provides an apparatus for performing the process as described hereinabove, consisting of a combined fiiel burner as well as a combustion chamber provided thereunder, comprising fiiel and gas supplies, characterised in that, at the top of the combustion chamber a vortex means is provided via which the fuels and gases from the combined fuel burner are guided downwardly towards a gas outlet, provided centrally at tile bottom of the said combined fuel burner; the gas outlet is surrounded by a slag trough at its upper end; an endothermic, entrained flow gasifier comprising a slag trough and a slag discharge means is provided underneath the gas outlet; pulverised fuel lances are provided underneath the gas outlet extending into the gasifier.<br>
The combustion chamber bottom comprises a central aperture from which the gas, freed fi"om the slag droplets, exits as an immersion jet and enters the entrained flow gasifier. The slag draining off the wall is collected in the trough surrounding the aperture, preferably equipped with radial drainage channels, draining off parallel to the gas in the entrained flow gasifier. The gas outlet is in this context formed as a duct, causing the gasification gas to be laminarised. This attains two things. On the one hand, the slag draining off, is accelerated towards the water bath at the foot end of the gasifier, and, on the other hand, the gas escaping into the gasifier in downward direction is maintained relatively long as a jet, whereby the latter slows down by itself above the water bath due to compression effects and is deflected (reflected) in upward direction in order then to rise parallel to the immersion jet along the gasifier wall. The carbonaceous pulverised fuel is blown into the descending gas jet under<br><br>
reducing conditions, being first entrained while descending and then entering the jacket-like rising gas portion, the dimensioning of the apparatus and the flow velocity being adapted to a substantial gasification of the pulverised fuel.<br>
In order to avoid reverse mixing of the rising gas portion with the exiting jet, a heat resistant steel or ceramics jacket may be provided around the gas outlet, through which the pulverised fuel can be conveyed via lances.<br>
The rising gas reaches an intermediate chamber, e.g. via a guiding means, between an outer sleeve of the apparatus and the jacket of the combustion chamber, causing a heat balance there and leaving the apparatus via the gasification gas outlet.<br>
The apparatus is provided with a heat protective lining and is preferably cooled.<br>
The gas formed is of high quality and can be used directly.<br>
Prior to the entry of the rising gas into the heat balancing duct, the latter may be<br>
quenched by injecting water or cold gas, e.g. in the case of unstable operating<br>
conditions.<br>
I<br><br>
By way of the accompanying figure, the present invention Is elucidated in detail with reference to a working example.<br>
For this purpose a combined fuel burner 1 is employed, absorbing hot, gaseous products from the low temperature carbonisation process, including the vaporous components such as tar, oil, water and dust at the entry nozzle of the low temperature carisonisatlon product passage 4, guiding them into the combustion chamber 9 via the vortex means 33. In the low temperature carbonisation product passage of the combined fuel burner pipes for the conveyance of residual coke, ash and of additives into the reactor, are provided so as to swirl, heat up and fling the mineral components to be melted in the combustion chamber 1 towards the wall inside the combustion chamber in a liquid state. For the substoichiometric combustion into a gasifying agent above the ash malting temperature the combined fuel burner 1 is provided with further supply ducts for oxygen 7 or air 3, introduced into the combustion chamber 1 in the same direction as the low temperature carbonisation products via vortex means 33 for the fast conversion with the low temperature carbonisation products into gasifying agents and for the melting down of the mineral components of the residual coke, the ash and, as the case may be, the aggregates. In order to prevent critical heat introduction into the non-cooled staictural components, the Ignition fuel supply 2, the Ignition air supply 5 and the ignition means as well as the ignition control 6, required for starting up and heating, ar9 co-Installed in the combined fuel burner where these elements are protected by the other flowing media in a stationary gasification operation.<br>
The use of a Known vortex burner for pulverised carbon fuel is likewise possible.<br>
The combustion chamber 9 is operated above the melting temperature of the mineral components of the residual coke, the ash and the aggregates. The wall of the combustion chamber 9 is heat conductive so that slag solidifies on it as a protective layer due to heat withdrawal towards the outside, while liquid slag drains off from the latter due to the temperature in the combustion chamber 9. The bottom of the reactor chamber 10 is designed as a slag collection trough with built-in drainage channels 12 in such a manner that a slag bath 13 may form, ensuring the slag flow at all times due to the direct contact of the slag with the gasifying agent 11<br><br>
and due to the co-current flow with the gasifying agent 11, even when passing through the gas exit 34. The gasifying agent 11 generated substoichiometrically In the combustion chamber 9 under gasification conditions, serves as gasifying agent in the endothermic, entrained flow gasifier 14 because of its CO?- and H2O content being set to a high level. The sensible heat introduced by the gasifying agent 11 is used for meeting the needs of the endothermic gasification reaction between the pulverised fuel and the gasifying agent. For this reason lances 15, 17 are provided for the pulverised fuel in the reactor. The gasifying agent 11 enters the endothermic, entrained flow gasifier 14 in the fonn of an immersion jet 16, accelerating the entrained slag droplets 18 so as to be brought into the water bath 19, solidifying there into an elution-proof granulate. The slag discharge means 22, the water supply 21 and the water overflow 20 were provided for the media discharge and for bacK-up of evaporated water. Together with the water bath 19 they form the lower end of the endothermic. entrained flow reactor 14.<br>
The immersion jet can furthermore be stabilised and a reverse mixing with the reflected gas, rising sleeve-like parallel to the wall, can be prevented if a jacket 35 made of heat-proof steel or ceramics, through which the pulverised fuel lances 15 pass, Is provided underneath the gas exit 34, Additional lances 17 may be located thereunder.<br>
By the supply of the oxygen-free gasifying agent 11 as well as by the pulverised fuel to be gasified in the endothermic, entrained flow reactor 14 and by the high gasification temperature above 500*^0 the design ensures that no oxygen break¬through can take place into the cold reactor regions.<br>
The heat compensating duct 26, wherein, if required, guide means 24 are provided, senses to wanri up the gasification gas 23. cooled due to the endothermic gasification process. They impart a turbulent vortex to the gasification gas flow 23, to increase the withdrawal of convective heat from the wall of the combustion chamber 9 in such a manner that the inner combustion chamber wall is cooled below the melting temperature of the slag, causing a protective layer to form from solidified slag. In addition, intensified cooling of the combustion chamber wall takes place by way of the cooling means 27, supplied via cooling agent supply and discharge means 28,29. For lowering the gasification temperature which should be<br><br>
between 500 and 1200""C, the means 30 is provided for quenching the gasification gas, quenching nozzles 31 being mounted thereon. The gasification gas leaves the reactor via the gasification outlet 25 provided with fire-proof lining.<br>
Further particulars of the multi-stage reactor permit a substantially broader field of application of the reactor. By replacing the residual coke, ash and pulverised fuel lances 8, 15, 17, parts of the combined fuel burner and the quenching nozzles 31, the facilities are thus provided to melt down extraneous mineral materials which may possibly be contaminated, as well as ores, and to gasify extraneous finely particulate fuels, to use own fuel gas or extraneously supplied gas for dosage or quenching with various means such as water, water vapour or cold gas.<br>
The provision of a trough for the collection of slag draining in liquid form from the combustion chamber 9 is provided as well, fomiing the lower and of the endothenmic, entrained flow gasifier 14 instead of the water bath 19.<br>
For chemical and thermal protection the reactor is provided with a fireproof lining 32. It can, however, also be designed with a heat and corrosion resistant material and thermal exterior insulation against pressures up to 10 Mpa.<br>
As a safeguard against a breakthrough of the combustion chamber 9 Into the endothermic, entrained flow gasifier 14, the lower portion of the heat compensating duct 25 is designed conically.<br>
