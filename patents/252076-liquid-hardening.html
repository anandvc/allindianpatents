LIQUID HARDENING<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
5  The present invention concerns the curing and hardening of liquids. In particular the present invention relates to the curing and hardening of inks and paints.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
10<br>
Recent reviews describe different alternatives, especially based on Mn and Fe compounds (Bieleman, J.H. in Additives in Plastics and Paints, Chimia, 56, 184 (2002); Bieleman, J.H., Marcomol. Symp., 187, 811 (2002); van Gorkum R, Bouwman E,<br>
15  Coord. Chem. Rev., 249, 1709 (2005)).<br>
WO 03/093384 describes the use of transition-metal salts or complexes based on pyrazoles, aliphatic and aromatic amines, 2,2'-bipyridine, 1,10'-phenanthroline, 1,4,7-trimethyl-<br>
20  1,4,7-triazacyclononane in combination with a reducing agent as drying agent. Especially Fe and Mn salts and complexes were preferred in combination with ascorbic acid or derivatives thereof. WO03/093384 demonstrates that iron compounds have a rather poor activity and hence high dosages<br>
25 are needed to get satisfactory drying activity. A drawback of using iron compounds at high levels is that an unwanted yellowish/brownish colour is imparted to the mix.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
30<br>
The present invention concerns settable liquid compositions<br>
that contain a siccative and an alkyd-based resin. The<br><br>
WO 2008/003652<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/056557<br><br>
siccative is the component of the liquid composition that facilitates drying, curing, setting, or hardening of the composition.<br>
5  The liquid may be any settable liquid, for example, lacquer, inks and paints.  The term paint includes lacquers. The term alkyd-based resin generally refers to polyesters modified with fatty acids. Alkyd-based resins are generally prepared via the condensation polymerisation reaction of three types 10  of monomers: polyalcohols, polybasic acids and fatty acids or triglyceride oils.<br>
We have found active iron and manganese compounds that are active as a siccative at relatively low concentrations.<br>
15<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides a curable liquid medium comprising:<br>
a) from 1 to 90 wt %, preferably from 20 to 70 wt%, of an alkyd-based resin; and,<br>
20  b) from 0.0001 to 0.1 wt% of a siccative, wherein the<br>
siccative is an iron or manganese complex of a tetradentate, pentadentate or hexadentate nitrogen donor ligand; the tetradentate, pentadentate or hexadentate nitrogen donor ligands are described in detail below.<br>
25<br>
Preferably the iron or manganese complex is of a tetradentate or pentadentate nitrogen donor ligand. More preferably the iron compound contains a pentadentate nitrogen donor ligand and the manganese compound a<br>
30  tetradentate nitrogen donor ligand.<br><br>

PCT7EP2007/056557<br><br>
In another aspect the present invention provides the composition of the present invention after curing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
5<br>
The present invention relates to a siccative for alkyd-based<br>
resins, coatings, inks, and linoleum floor coverings,<br>
comprising an iron or manganese complex containing a<br>
tetradentate, pentadentate or hexadentate nitrogen donor<br>
10  ligand. Whilst certain paints/inks contain unsaturated oils/acids as cross-linking agent, most of them contain alkyd-based resins that contain unsaturated groups. The alkyd-based air-drying coatings to which the siccative of the present invention can be added, comprise coatings, such<br>
15  as paint, varnish or wood stain, and also includes inks and linoleum floor coverings and the like. The siccative is equally applicable to setting paints/inks/print which do not contain alkyd-based resins, but do contain at least 2% of double or triple unsaturated compound.<br>
20<br>
The coatings, inks, and linoleum floor coverings may also include compositions wherein besides the alkyd based binder also other binders are present, e.g. compositions comprising 1) an alkyd- based binder and 2) a polyacrylate and/or a<br>
25  polyurethane binder. Conventional air~drying alkyds can be obtained by a polycondensation reaction of one or more polyhydric alcohols, one or more polycarboxylic acids or the corresponding anhydrides, and long chain unsaturated fatty acids or oils.<br><br>
WO 2008/003652<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056557<br><br>
Due to its presence in naturally occurring oils, glycerol is a widely encountered polyol. Other examples of suitable polyhydric alcohols include: pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 5  propylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, trimethylol propane, trimethylol ethane, di-trimethylol propane and 1,6-hexane diol. Polycarboxylic acids and the corresponding anhydrides, used to synthesise alkyds, comprise aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic components, which are generally derived from<br>
10  petrochemical feedstocks. Typical examples of such polyacids include: phthalic acid and its regio-isomeric analogues, trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid, pimelic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and tetra-hydrophthalic acid.<br>
15<br>
Suitable drying fatty acids, semi-drying fatty acids or mixture thereof, useful herein, are ethylenically unsaturated conjugated or non-conjugated C2-C24 carboxylic acids, such as oleic, ricinoleic, linoleic, linolenic,<br>
20  licanic acid and eleostearic acids or mixture thereof, typically used in the form of mixtures of fatty acids derived from natural or synthetic oils. By semi-drying and drying fatty acids is meant fatty acids that have the same fatty acid composition as the oils they are derived from.<br>
25  The classfication of the oils is based on the iodine number; for drying oil the iodine number is &gt;140; for semi-drying oil the iodine number is ranging between 125 and 140, and for non-drying oil the iodine number is 
30  Suitable organic solvents to dilute the air- drying alkyds of the invention include aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and<br><br>
WO 2008/003652<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056557<br><br>
aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohol ethers, alcohol esters and N-methylpyrrolidone. However it may also be an aqueous carrier containing the alkyd resin in the form of an emulsion and a suitable emulsifier as is well known in the art. 5<br>
An ink of the present invention containing an alkyd varnish, modified with unsaturated fatty acids, as defined above, as a vehicle component of the ink is usable, but not limited to, as a metal plate ink, lithographic ink, relief printing 10  ink, screen ink or offset overprinting ink.<br>
The siccative will preferably be partly or completely dissolved in the alkyd resin, emulsion etc. The catalytic activity of the transition metal ion depends upon the ion 15  itself and on the type of ligands employed, as disclosed herein. The siccative may also be dosed to the composition just prior the use of the composition.<br>
The composition of the present invention can, if desired or 20  if necessary, also comprise other additives such as other siccatives.<br>
The invention is also an air-drying alkyd-based coating, resin, ink, or floor covering comprising a siccative<br>
25  according to the invention, e.g. containing from 0.00001 to 0.1 wt% (based on the amount of binder; this will be generally 5 to 50 times higher than when metal-based, depending on the molecular weight of the compound defined herein) of the iron or manganese complex containing a<br>
30  tetradentate, pentadentate or hexadentate nitrogen donor. The air-drying alkyd-based coating, resin, ink, or floor<br><br>
WO 2008/003652<br><br>

5  Experiment 1<br>
Homogeneous bleaching of p-carotene in hexane with methyllinoleate<br>
This experiment was  done to show that the (3-carotene can be 10  degraded by interaction of the various iron and manganese catalysts with methyllinoleate, as an indicator for radical reactions (which in turn should lead to increased rate of paint/ink drying).<br>
15  UV/VIS experiments were performed on a Hewlett Packard 8453 apparatus. All the experiments were performed at 35 CC and measurements were conducted over a period of 1 hour in the UV/VIS kinetic mode. The assays were done in a quartz cuvette and were shaken thoroughly before starting the<br>
20  measurements. The stopper was removed from the cuvettes during measurements.<br>
The hexane solutions contained 85.6 ^lM  (3-carotene, 6.0 mM<br>
methyllinoleate, approximately 5 p.M of the catalyst and 3.1% 25  (v/v) ethanol. The initial absorbance at 452 nm was about<br>
0.45 A.U. The difference between the initial absorbance and absorbance after 600 seconds in each case is given in table 1. A higher value indicates a higher p-carotene bleaching activity.<br><br>

10  Experiment 2<br>
Drying time of linseed oil paint<br>
A solvent borne model (linseed oil in n-heptane) is used for 15  alkyd based systems. All experiments were performed at room temperature and films were made on a petridish. The starting catalyst concentrations that were used were between 0.016 mM and 0.32 mM as exemplified in Table 2. Co(II)-2-ethylhexanoate (1.63 mM) and a blank (linseed oil/heptane 20  50/50 v/v) were also incorporated for comparison.<br><br>
WO 2008/003652<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056557<br><br>
The film on the petridish consisted of 100 |il (50/50 v/v linseed/n-heptane) and 25 |il catalyst solution in ethanol (vide  supra  for final concentrations in linseed oil/heptane solutions). 5<br>
The results of the tested iron and manganese complexes are shown in table. In all cases, the time needed to establish tack-free drying is given in the table. Films were classified as tack-free  when they gave a straight line when a pin was<br>
10  run through the film, but a fingerprint was still visible on the film.   Through-dry  indicates that the coating was hard and no print was visible anymore. A lower value indicates a faster drying time. Different concentrations of drying catalysts were taken, to establish the lowest level that<br>
15      still can attain an equal or better drying than the cobalt salt.<br>
