TRANS-9,10-DEHYDROEPOTHILONE C AND D, ANALOGS THEREOF AND<br>
METHODS OF MAKING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns methods for making trans, 10-dehydroepothilone C and D, and analogs thereof, and to compounds made by the methods, compositions containing the compounds and methods for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The class of polyketides known as epothilones has emerged as a source of • potentially therapeutic compounds having modes of action similar to paclitaxel (Bollag, et aL, Cancer Res. 55:2325-2333 (1995); Service, Science 274(5295):2009 (1996); Cowden and Paterson, Nature 387(6630):238-9 (1997)). Interest in the epothilones and epothilone analogs has grown with the observations that certain epothilones are active against tumors that have developed resistance to paclitaxel as well as reduced potential for undesirable side-effects (Muhlradt and Sasse Cancer Res. 57(16);3344-6 (1997)). Among the epothilones and epothilone analogs being investigated for therapeutic efficacy are epothilone B 1 and the semi-synthetic epothilone B analogs, BMS-247550 2, also known as "azaepothilone B" (Colevas, et aL, Oncology (Hunting*). 15(9):1168-9, 1172-5 (2001); Lee, et aL, Clin Cancer Res. 7(5):1429-37 (2001); McDaid, et aL, Clin Cancer Res. 8(7):2035-43 (2002); Yamaguchi, et aL, Cancer Res. 62(2):466-71 (2002)), and BMS-310705 3.<br><br><br><br>
Desoxyepothilone B 4, also known as "epothilone D" is another epothilone derivative having promising anti-tumor properties viz. paclitaxel that is being investigated for therapeutic efficacy. This compound has also demonstrated less toxicity than epothilones having 12, 13-epoxides, such as epothilone B or BMS-247550, presumably due to the lack of the highly-reactive epoxide moiety.<br><br>
The production of 9-oxo-epothilone analogs, including 9-oxo-epothilone D and analogs thereof using chemical and biotechnological routes, has recently been disclosed in International PCT application Publication No. WO 01/83800, published November 8, 2001.<br>
. Recently, the synthesis and preliminary evaluation of trans-9,10-dehydroepothilone D (5) and 26-trifluoro-/ra«s-9,10-dehydroepothilone D (6) have been reported (Rivkin et al.9 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003,125: 2899-2901. An earlier report of the preparation of 5 has been found to be in error (White et al.9 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 725:5407-13; White et aL, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003,125: 3190). While these compounds show promising activity, their preparation by total chemical synthesis is lengthy and expensive, and improved methods for their preparation are needed.<br><br><br>
Although various epothilone analogs having anti-tumor activity have been disclosed in the art, there is continuing interest in new analogs having microtubule stabilizing activities that exhibit fewer side effects than paclitaxel or epothilones A and B.<br>

In one aspect, the present invention relates to methods of synthesizing the compounds of structures (II), (IE) or (IV), wherein X is S, from 9-oxo-epothilones C or D. 9-oxo-epothilones C and D, may be readily obtained as disclosed in International PCT application Publication No. WO 01/83800, published November 8, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference. In general, 9-oxo-epothilone D is produced by in recombinant host cells of the suborder Cystobacterineae containing a recombinant expression vector that encodes a polyketide synthase (PKS) gene. As disclosed in WO 01/83800, inactivation of the KR domain of extender module 6 of the<br><br>
epothilone PKS results in a PKS capable of producing the 9-oxo-epothilones. A strain in<br>
which the KR domain of extender module 6 has been deactivated has been designated<br>
K39-164 and has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas,<br>
Virginia 20110-2209, USA on November 21, 2000, under the terms of the Budapest<br>
Treaty, and is available under accession No. PTA-2716. Strain K39-164 produces 9-oxo-<br>
epothilone D as a major product and 9-oxo-epothilone C as a minor product. In another<br>
aspect, the present invention relates to methods of synthesizing the compounds of structures (II) wherein X is O, from 9-oxo-epothilones Hj or H2, the oxazole counterparts<br>
of 9-oxo-epothilones C or D. As also described in WO 01/83800, by supplementing host<br>
cells with excess serine, the thiazole epothilone compounds normally produced by host<br>
cells are modulated in such a way to favor the production of the oxazole counterparts. In<br>
this manner, cells that predominantly produce 9-oxo-epothilone C or D can be made to favor  the production  of 9-oxo-epothilone H1   or  H2,  the  corresponding  oxazole<br>
counterparts.<br>
Referring to reaction scheme 1, below, compounds of the present invention may be obtained by ketoreduction and elimination, such as by protecting the free hydroxyl groups with a suitable protecting group, such as, for example, a triethylsilyl group, a butyldimethylsilyl group, a 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group or the like; reducing the 9-oxo group to obtain the corresponding 9-hydroxyl intermediate compound, activating the 9-hydroxyl compound such as with trifluoroacetic anhydride, methanesulfonyl chloride or trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride in the presence of a suitable base, for example sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide or an amine base such as pyridine or 4-(dimethylaminopyridine) in tetrahydroiuran ("THF") or other suitable solvent to obtain the corresponding trifluoroacetyl, methanesulfonate or trifluoromethanesulfonate intermediate compound; eliminating the activating group to obtain the corresponding protected 9,10-dehydroepothilone by reaction with a suitable base, for example sodium bis(trimethylsilylamide), lithium diisopropylamide, or 4-(dimethylaminopyridine); and then deprotecting the protected intermediate to obtain the desired 9,10-dehydroepothilone. Representative examples utilizing this synthesis route are set forth hereinbelow in Examples 1-21.<br><br>
Synthesis route 1: Ketoreduction and elimination (X = S or O)<br><br>
Referring to reaction scheme 2, below, compounds of the present invention may also be obtained by pyrolytic elimination, such as by activation of the bis(protected) 9-oxo-epothilone with a base, such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, carbon disulfide and methyl iodide so as to form the methyl xanthate ester, or with dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride so as to form the thiocarbamate, and then heating the activated intermediate at a sufficient temperature, such as at about 170 °C, for a sufficient time to eliminate the activating group and obtain the corresponding protected 9,10-dehydro epothilone compound, and then deprotecting the protected intermediate to obtain the desired 9,10-dehydroepothilone. Suitable temperatures and times can be determined using methods familiar to those having skill in the organic chemistry arts. Representative examples utilizing this synthesis route are set forth hereinbelow in Examples 1-4 and 22-25.<br><br>
Synthesis route 2: Pyrolytic elimination (X = S or O)<br><br>
Referring to reaction scheme 3, below, compounds of the present invention may<br>
also be obtained by vinyl triflate reduction, such as by reacting a protected 9-oxo-<br>
epothilone with a triflating reagent such as trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, N-(2-<br>
pyridyl)triflimide, or N-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl)triflimide, and a base such as 2,4-di-tert-<br>
butyl—4-methylpyridine, or sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide to obtain the corresponding<br>
9,10-dehydro-9-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy intermediate compound.    The 9-trifluoro-<br>
methanesulfonyloxy group may then be reduced, for example using a hydride source such<br>
as a trialkylammonium formate salt or a trialkyltin hydride in the presence of a palladium<br>
catalyst, such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), to form the resulting protected<br>
9,10-dehydro-epothilone,   and   the   compound   deprotected   to   obtain   the   desired<br>
9,10-dehydroepothilone   10.       Alternatively,   the   9,10-dehydro-9-trifluoromethane-<br>
sulfonyloxy intermediate compound may be further substituted by the addition of alkyl<br>
groups using, for example, vinyl triflate coupling techniques, such, as reaction of the<br>
trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy enol (8) with allyltributyltin in the presence of a catalyst such<br>
as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and lithium chloride to obtain the allyl-substituted, protected 9,10-dehydro epothilone compound 9a (Rj = CH2CHCH2); and<br>

I<br>
(8)   with   loweralkyl   zinc   reagents   in   the   presence   of   a   catalyst   such   as (tetrakis)triphenylphosphinepalladium(O) provides compounds of formula (9a) wherein Rl is loweralkyl.  Representative examples utilizing these synthesis routes are set forth hereinbelow in Examples 1-4 and 26-30. Synthesis route 3: Vinyl triflate reduction (X = S or O)<br><br>
Referring to reaction scheme 4, below, compounds of the present invention may also be prepared from 9-oxoepothilones using ring-opened intermediates. In one embodiment of the invention, a 3,7-protected form of the epothilone (2) is reacted with a reducing agent, for example di(isobutyl)aluminum hydride (DiBAl-H) under conditions<br><br>
wherein the lactone carbonyl is selectively reduced. The alcohol groups on the resulting ring-opened intermediate (11) are protected, for example by silylation using a chlorotrialkylsilane or trialkylsilyl triflate in the presence of a base such as imidazole or 2,6-lutidine, to provide intermediate (12). In another embodiment of the invention, a 3,7-protected form of the epothilone is reacted with a reducing agent, for example di(isobutyl)aluminum hydride (DiBAl-H) under conditions wherein both the lactone carbonyl and the 9-oxo group are reduced to provide intermediate. The 1- and 15-OH groups are selectively protected, for example as their tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers by reaction with their tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride and imidazole, to provide intermediate (13). The 9-OH may be oxidized back to the ketone using, for example, the Dess-Martin periodinane in dichloromethane, to provide intermediate (12).<br>
The ketone group of intermediate (12) can be transformed into a trans-9,10-alkene using any of the methods described above. In one embodiment, intermediate (12) is reacted with a triflating agent such as trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride or an N-(2-pyridyl)triflimide and a base, such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide or lithium diisopropylamide, to form the vinyl triflate (14). The vinyl triflate is reduced using a hydride source such as a trialkylammonium formate salt or trialkyltin hydride in the presence of a catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) to provide intermediate (15).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, intermediate (13) is reacted with a reagent to activate the 9-group for elimination. For example, (13) is reacted with trifluoroacetic anhydride, methanesulfonic anhydride, or trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride in the presence of a suitable base, such as pyridine or 4-(dimethylaminopyridine), to produce the 9-O-trifluoroacetate, 9-Omethanesulfonate, or 9-O-triflate, respectively. Subsequent treatment with a hindered base, for example sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide or lithium diisopropylamide produces the trans-9,10-alkene intermediate (15).<br>
In another embodiment, intermediate (13) is converted to the methyl xanthate by reaction with a base such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, carbon disulfide, and methyl iodide. The intermediate xanthate is subjected to pyrolysis as described above to produce intermediate (15).<br><br><br><br>
Intermediate (15) can be converted into trans-9,10-dehydroepothilones. The<br>
primary silyl protecting group is removed using, for example, camphorsulfonic acid, and<br>
the resulting 1-alcohol is oxidized to the carboxylic acid, for example using a two-step<br>
procedure wherein the alcohol is first oxidized using an amine oxide and catalytic<br>
tetrapropylammonium perruthenate and then further oxidized to the acid by reaction with sodium  chlorite  (NaC102).     The  15-OH  group  is  deprotected by treatment with<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF at 0 °C, and the macrocycle is closed, for example using the conditions of Yamaguchi (1,3,5-trichlorobenzoyl chloride and triethylamine in THF at 0 °C, followed by addition of the mixed anhydride to a solution of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine in toluene at 75 °C) to provide the protected intermediate (13). Deprotection provides the trans-9,10-dehydroepothilone.<br>
Referring to synthesis scheme 5, compounds of the invention can be prepared using ring-opened epothilone intermediates prepared by saponification. In one embodiment, the protected epothilone (2) is converted into the protected seco-acid, for example by treatment with hydroxide or an esterase. The acid is converted to the tert-butyl ester, for example ' using tert-butyl alcohol, a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine as catalyst. The 15-OH is protected, for example by silylation, and the 9-ketone is converted to the vinyl triflate as described above. The vinyl triflate is reduced as described above, and the intermediate is partially deprotected using camphorsulfonic acid to provide the 3,7-protected-seco-9,10-dehydroepothilone. Lactonization according to the procedure of Yamaguchi followed by deprotection provides the trans-9,10-dehydroepothilone.<br><br><br>
The 3,7-protected form of epothilones (2) can be converted into trans-9,10-• dehydroepothilones. The synthesis route involves initial saponification of epothilone derivative (2) to provide a ring-opened epothilone intermediate, which is modified to include the 9,10-trans alkene group and then ultimately lactonized to provide the.trans-9,10-dehydroepothilone. A representative synthetic scheme is illustrated in synthesis route 6.<br><br>
Referring to synthesis route 6, the 3,7-protected epothilone (2) is saponified with sodium hydroxide in aqueous methanol to provide the corresponding hydroxy acid (16). Hydroxy acid (16) is converted to its methyl ester (17) by reaction with trimethylsilyl diazomethane. The hydroxy group of methyl ester (17) is protected by treatment with trimethylsilyl chloride/trimethylsilyl imidazole to provide trimethylsilyl ether (18). The 9-ketone of trimethylsilyl ether (18) is transformed into a trans-9,10-alkene by reaction with N-(2-pyridyl)triflimide and sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide to produce vinyl triflate (19). Reduction of vinyl triflate (19) with palladium (II) acetate, triphenylphosphine, tributylamine, and formic acid provides trans-9,10-alkene (20). The trimethylsilyl protecting group and methyl ester group of intermediate (20) are removed by treatment with sodium hydroxide followed by treatment with acetic acid yielding hydroxy acid (21), which is then lactonized to provide 3,7-protected epothilone (9). Deprotection provides the trans-9,10-dehydroepothilone.<br><br><br>
Ring-opened trimethylsilyl ether (18) prepared as described above and as shown in synthesis route  6  can be the starting point for another route to  trans-9,10-<br><br><br>
Ring-opened trimethylsilyl ether (18) prepared as described above and as shown in synthesis route  6  can be the starting point for another route to  trans-9310-<br><br>
dehydroepothilones. The synthetic route involves reduction of the 9-ketone group of intermediate (18) followed by elimination to provide the trans-9,10-alkene group and then ultimately lactonization to provide the trans-9,10-dehydroepothilone. A representative synthetic scheme is illustrated in synthesis route 7.<br>
Referring to synthesis route 7, reduction of trimethylsilyl ether (18) with sodium borohydride provides 9-hydroxy derivative (22). Hydroxy derivative (22) is then activated for elimination by treatment with an activating agent, such as trifluoroacetic anhydride, methanesulfonic anhydride, or trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride in the presence of a suitable base, such as pyridine or 4-(dimethylaminopyridine), to produce the 9-Otrifluoroacetate, 9-O-methanesulfonate, or 9-O-triflate, respectively, activated intermediate (23). Subsequent treatment of activated intermediate (23) with a hindered base, for example, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide or lithium-diisopropylamide produces the trans-9,10-alkene intermediate (24). The trimethylsilyl protecting group and methyl ester group of intermediate (24) are removed by treatment with sodium hydroxide followed by treatment with acetic acid to yield hydroxy acid (21). Lactonization of hydroxy acid (21) provides 3,7-protected epothilone (9), which on deprotection yields the trans-9,10-dehydroepothilone.<br><br><br>

Compounds of the invention may be screened for cytotoxicity using conventional assays well known to those skilled in the art. For example, cytotoxicity of the compounds may be determined by the SRB assay as disclosed in Skehan et al., J. Natl Cancer Inst 82:1107-1112 (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference. In the SRB assay, the following cultured cells are trypsinized, counted and diluted to the following concentrations per 100µl with growth medium: MCF-7, 5000; NCI/ADR-Res, 7500; NCI-H460, 5000; A549, 5000; Skov3, 7500; and SF-268, 7500.   The cells are<br><br>
seeded at 100 µl/well in 96-well microtiter plates.  Twenty-four hours later, 100 pi of a<br>
test epothilone compound of the invention (ranging in concentration from 1000 nM to<br>
0.001 nM diluted in growth medium) is added to each well.  After incubation, with the<br>
compound for a period of days, the cells are fixed with 100 (il of 10% trichloroacetic acid<br>
(MTCAn) at 4 degrees for 1 hour, and stained with 0.2% sulforhodamine B (SRB)/1%<br>
acetic acid, and the bound SRB is then extracted with 200 pi of 10 mM Tris base.  The<br>
amount of bound dye is determined by OD 515 nm, which correlates to the total cellular<br>
protein contents.  The data is analyzed using standard statistical methodologies (such as<br>
those available with the software sold as KALEIDA GRAPH® by Synergy Software of Reading, PA) and the IC5QS are calculated.<br>

Cancer 75:57-63 (1998), which are incorporated herein by referenced In this procedure, MCF-7 cells are grown to confluency in 35mm culture dishes and treated with 1 nM of a compound of the invention for 0, 1 or 2 hours at 35 °C. After washing the cells twice with 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without calcium or magnesium, the cells are lysed at room temperature for 5-10 minutes with 300 jal of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, PH 6.8, 1 mM MgC12, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors). The cells are scraped and the lysates transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. The lysates are then centrifuged at 18000 g for 12 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant containing soluble or unpolymerized (cytosolic) tubulin is separated from the pellet containing insoluble or polymerized (cytoskeletal) tubulin and transferred to new tubes. The pellets are then resuspended in 300 jil of lysis buffer. Changes in tubulin polymerization in the cells are determined by analyzing the same volume of aliquots of each sample with SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using an anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma).<br>

Although the exact mechanisms involved in the loss of myelin are not understood, there is an increase in astrocyte proliferation and accumulation in the areas of myelin destruction. At these sites, there is macrophage-like activity and increased protease activity which is at least partially responsible for degradation of the myelin sheath. This method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition of the invention to a subject suffering from multiple sclerosis. Such administration may be repeated as necessary to inhibit astrocyte proliferation and/or<br><br>
lessen the severity of the loss of motor function and/or- prevent or attenuate chronic progression of the disease. Clinically, practice of this method will result in improvement in visual symptoms (visual loss, diplopia), gait disorders (weakness, axial instability, sensory loss, spasticity, hyperreflexia, loss of dexterity), upper extremity dysfunction (weakness, spasticity, sensory loss), bladder dysfunction (urgency, incontinence, hesitancy, incomplete emptying), depression,, emotional lability, and cognitive impairment. Pathologically, practice of the method will result in the reduction of one or more of the following, such as myelin loss, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells, immunologic abnormalities, gliotic scar formation and astrocyte proliferation, metalloproteinase production, and impaired conduction velocity.<br>
In yet other embodiments, the compounds and/or compositions of the invention are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, a multisystem chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease that sometimes leads to destruction and ankyiosis of affected joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by a marked thickening of the synovial membrane which forms villous projections that extend into the joint space, multilayering of the synoviocyte lining (synoviocyte proliferation), infiltration of the synovial membrane with white blood cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and lymphoid . follicles; called an "inflammatory synovitis"), and deposition of fibrin with cellular necrosis within the synovium. The tissue formed as a result of this process is called pannus and, eventually the pannus grows to fill the joint space. The pannus develops an extensive network of new blood vessels through the process of angiogenesis that is essential to the evolution of the synovitis. Release of digestive enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., collagenase, stromelysin)) and other mediators of the inflammatory process (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, superoxides, lysosomal enzymes, and products of arachidonic acid metabolism) from the cells of the pannus tissue leads to the progressive destruction of the cartilage tissue. The pannus invades the articular cartilage leading to erosions and fragmentation of the cartilage tissue. Eventually there is erosion of the subchondral bone with fibrous ankylosis and ultimately bony ankylosis, of the involved joint. In this aspect of the invention, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound and/or composition of the invention is administered to a subject suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Such administration may be repeated as necessary to accomplish to inhibit synoviocyte proliferation and/or lessen the severity of the loss of movement of the affected joints<br><br>
and/or prevent or attenuate chronic progression of the disease. Clinically, practice of the present invention will result in one or more of the following: (i) decrease in the severity of symptoms (pain, swelling and tenderness of affected joints; morning stiffness, weakness, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss); (ii) decrease in the severity of clinical signs of the disease (thickening of the joint capsule, synovial hypertrophy, joint effusion, soft tissue contractures, decreased range of motion, ankylosis and fixed joint deformity); (iii) decrease in the extra-articular manifestations of the disease (rheumatic nodules, vasculitis, pulmonary nodules, interstitial fibrosis, pericarditis, episcleritis, iritis, Felty's syndrome, osteoporosis); (iv) increase in the frequency and duration of disease remission/symptom-free periods; (v) prevention of fixed impairment and disability; and/or (vi) prevention/ attenuation of chronic progression of the disease. Pathologically, practice of the present invention will produce at least one of the following: (i) decrease in the inflammatory response; (ii) disruption of the activity of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-I, INFa, FGF, VEGF); (iii) inhibition of synoviocyte proliferation; (iv) inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activity, and/or (v) inhibition of angiogenesis.<br>
In other embodiments, the compounds and/or compositions of the present invention are used to threat atherosclerosis and/ or restenosis, particularly in patients whose blockages may be treated with an endovascular stent. Atherosclerosis is a chronic vascular injury in which some of the normal vascular smooth muscle cells ("VSMC") in the artery wall, which ordinarily control vascular tone regulating blood flow, change their nature and develop "cancer-like" behavior. These VSMC become abnormally proliferative, secreting substances (growth factors, tissue-degradation enzymes and other proteins) which enable them to invade and spread into the inner vessel lining, blocking blood flow and making that vessel abnormally susceptible to being completely blocked by local blood clotting. Restenosis, the recurrence of stenosis or artery stricture after corrective procedures, is an accelerated form of atherosclerosis. In this aspect of the invention, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition of the invention may be coated on a stent, and the stent delivered to the diseased artery in a subject suffering from atherosclerosis. Methods for coating a stent with a compound are described for example by U.S. Patent Nos. 6,156,373 and 6,120, 847, which are incorporated herein by reference.

The experiments were performed twice. The results are shown in the following Table 1.<br><br>
Example 49 Additional 9,10-dehydroepothilone D Analogs<br>
Following the procedure of Examples 39 (when R = methyl) and 42 (when R = CF3), the additional compounds shown in Table 2 were made by replacing (2-(tert-butyldimetiiyl-silyloxy)-methylthiazoM-yl)methyltri-n-butyl-phosphonium chloride with the corresponding phosphonium chloride.   Cytotoxicity data (Table 2) was obtained as<br><br>
described in Example 48. Cytochrome P450 inhibition data (Table 3) was obtained using the initial rate method against BFC substrate.<br>
(4-Methoxypyridin-2-yl)methyltributylphc&gt;sphoiiixim chloride was prepared as follows. To a solution of 770 mg (4.9 mmol) of 2-(chloromethyl)-4-methoxypyridine in 7 ml of benzene was added 1.22 ml of tri-/z-butylphosphine (4.9 mmol) dropwise under nitrogen. The resulting solution was refluxed for 18 hour before it was cooled down to ambient temperature. The solution was then concentrated under vacuum; all the necessary measures have been taken to reduce any contact with air. A slightly yellow solid was formed by adding diethyl ether to the residue. The mother liquor was filtered away, and the yellow solid was washed several times with diethyl ether under nitrogen, the solid was then dried under vacuum to give the phosphonium salt as 1.2 g of yellow powder.<br>
(5-Methyl-isoxazol-3-yl)methyltributyl phosphonium chloride was prepared as follows:<br>
3-(chloromethyl)-5-methyl isoxazole (0.30 g, 2.28 mmol, 1 eq.) was dissolved in 6 mL<br>
benzene in a 100 mL oven-dried RBF.  Tributylphosphine (0.57 mL, 2.28 mmol, 1 eq.)<br>
was added via syringe, and the solution was refluxed for 15 hours under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere.    The solution was cooled to room temperature and the volume reduced in<br>
vacuo. Et20 was added to precipitate out the desired phosphonium salt.    The ether<br>
supernatant was decanted off, and the white solid dried under vacuum overnight (0.760 g,<br>
99% yield).<br>

EXAMPLE 50 Pharmacological Parameters<br>
Cytochrome P450 inhibition measurements were performed using a commercially-available kit (BD GenTest, Woburn, MA), using BFC as substrate against CYP3A4. The IC50 values in micromolar so obtained are listed in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Compound solubility was determined as follows: 5 \iL of stock solution (at 20 mg/mL in DMSO) was added to 95 ^L of phosphate-buffered saline. After being vortexed for about 10 seconds, the solution/suspension was filtered through a 0.45 micron filter and the amount of analyte was quantitated by HPLC. Solubilities (mg/mL) determined were as follows: epothilone D, 0.6; 2 l-amino-26-F3-*raw-9,10-dehydroepothilone D, &gt;0.6; 26-<br><br>
F3- *r<my-9 d kosn></my-9>
Half-lives of compounds in fresh mouse and human plasma were determined by dissolving the compounds in DMSO and adding aliquots to samples of mouse or human plasma. At Time Zero, aliquotted 75 pi from each sample and added 150 \xl of acetonitrile. Centrifiiged the white precipitate at 13500 rpm for 3 minutes. Transferred all the clear supernatant into another microcentrifuge tube and repeated the centrifuging step (13500rpm/3 min). Carefully pipetted 150 fil of the clear supernatant into labeled HPLC sample tubes and tried to avoid pipetting any protein pellets. The samples were analyzed by HPLC to measure remaining compound at each time point by comparison with authentic standards. The half-lives (minutes) in mouse and human plasma, respectively, were determined to be: epothilone D: 49, &gt;1440; 21-OH-26-F3-*7"<ms-9 d:>1440; 21-amino- /7*a;iy-9,10-dehydroepothilone D: 59, &gt;1440; 26-F3- fra/iy-9,10-dehydroepothilone D: 163, &gt;1440; 21-OH- trans-9,10-dehydroepothilone D: 1059, &gt;1440; KOSN 1635: 58, &gt;1440; KOSN 1632: 28,&gt;1440. Using frozen mouse plasma, /rans-9,10-dehydroepothilone D had a half-life of 47 minutes. In fresh human plasma, /ra/7£-9,10-dehydroepothilone D had a half life &gt;1440 min.<br>
Plasma protein binding studies were performed as follows. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO, then diluted into either fresh or thawed samples of mouse or human plasma and incubated at 37 °C. Time points of 50 |iL were mixed with 100 jil of acetonitrile and centrifiiged at ~ 14000 rpm for 3 minutes. A 10.0 \xh aliquot was removed from the supernatant and set aside for analysis to indicate compound in the total fraction. The remaining supernatant was transferred onto a Microcon ultrafiltration device fitted with a YM10 membrane and centrifiiged to separate protein-bound material. A 50 \iL aliquot of the protein-free filtrate was mixed with 100 pL of acetonitrile, centrifiiged at -14000 rpm for 3 minutes, then 100 jiL of the supernatant was collected and analyzed to determine the amount of compound not protein bound. The amount of compound in the total sample and in the protein-free fraction were determined by HPLC analysis against authentic standards.<br>
These plasma protein binding studies indicated the following percentages of compound protein bound: epothilone D: 98.5%; *r<ms-9 d></ms-9><br><br><br><br><br>
