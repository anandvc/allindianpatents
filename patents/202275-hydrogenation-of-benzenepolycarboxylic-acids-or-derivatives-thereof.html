				<td>The present invention relates to a process for hydrogenating benzenepolycarboxylic acids or derivatives thereof, such as esters and/or anhydrides, by bringing one or   more benzenepolycarboxyLIc acids or one or more derivatives thereof into contact with a hydrogen-containing gas in the presence of a catalyst containing macropores.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention also relates to selected products as obtained by the hydrogenation according to the invention as such, i.e. the corresponding   cyclohexane compounds, in particular of cyclohexanedicarboxylic esters and cyclohexanetricarboxylic esters, in particular the cyclohexanedicarboxylic esters and cyclohexanetricarboxylic esters. Furthermore, the invention also relates to the use of the obtained cyclohexanedicarboxylic esters as plasticizers in plastics.<br>
iN US 5,286,898 and US 5,319,129, dimethyl terephthalate is hydrogenated at &gt; 140 °C and a pressure of from 50 to 170 bar over supported Pd catalysts which are treated with Ni, Pt and/or Ru to give the corresponding dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate. In DE-A28 23 165, aromatic carboxylic esters are hydrogenated at from 70 to 250 °C and from 30 to 200 bar over supported Ni, Ru,<br>
Rh and/or Pd catalysts to give the corresponding cycloaliphatic carboxylic esters. US 3,027,398 describes the hydrogenation of dimethyl terephthalate over supported Ru catalysts at from 110 to 140 °C and from 35 to 105 bar.<br>
EP-A   0   603    825   relates   to   a   process   for   the   preparation   of   1,4-cycylohexanedicarboxylic acid by hydrogenating terephthalic acid by using a<br><br>
supported palladium catalyst, wherein as support alumina, silica or active charcoal is used. The process described therein is particularly characterized in that the solution comprising an 1,4-cycIohexanedicarboxyIic acid as obtained in a first step is brought into contact with steam, thereby leading to an extraction of the impurities as  obtained in said solution. This process is, however, only applicable to acids, since when using it for derivatives, such as e.g. esters, anhydrides, etc. there exists the risk of hydrolysis. The use of a support comprising macropores is not mentioned in this application.<br>
 Up to now, predominantly phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl or isononyl esters of phthalic acid have been used as plasticizers in plastics, such as PVC, as may be deduced from e.g. FR-A 2,397,131. However, since recently these compounds are regarded as being detrimental under health aspects and thus their use in plastics for producing e.g. tools for children is under an increasing criticism, in<br>
some countries their use is even forbidden.<br>
The use of several cyclohexane-l,2-dicarboxylic acid esters as plasticizer is known from the prior art. Described is the use of cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid dimethyl or diethyl esters (DE-A 28 23 165 , cyclohexane-l,2-dicarboxylic acid  di(isononyl ester (EP-A 07-011074  and cyclohexane-l,2-dicarboxylic acid di(2-ethylhexyl ester (DE-A 12 63 296  as plasticizers in plastic.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for hydrogenating benzenepolycarboxylic acids or derivatives, in particular benzenedicarboxylic esters,  using specific catalysts, by means of which the corresponding ring-hydrogenated derivatives, in particular cyclohexanedicarboxylic esters, can be obtained with a very high selectivity and in a very high space-time yield without significant secondary reactions.<br>
  A further object of the present invention lies in providing new products which are<br><br>
obtainable by the hydrogenation of benzenepolycarboxylic acid (derivatives according to the invention, which should be preferably useable as plasticizers in plastics.<br>
 The present invention accordingly provides a process for hydrogenating a benzenepolycarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof or a mixture of two or more thereof by bringing the benzenepolycarboxylic acid or the derivative thereof or the mixture of two or more thereof into contact with a hydrogen-containing gas in the presence of a catalyst which comprises as active metal at least one metal of<br>
  transition group VIII of the Periodic Table alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I or VIII of the periodic table applied to a support which contains macropores with the proviso that<br>
if dimethyl terephthalate is hydrogenated, the hydrogenation using a catalyst which comprises as active metal ruthenium either alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I, VII or VIII of the Periodic Table applied to a support, where the support has a mean pore diameter of at least 50 nm and a BET surface area of at most 30 m2/g and the amount of the active metal is from 0.01 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst, and the ratio of the surface areas of the active metal and the catalyst support is less than 0.05,<br>
3 or a catalyst which comprises as active metal ruthenium either alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I, VII or VIII of the Periodic Table in an amount of from 0.01 to 30%  by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst, applied to a support, where from 10 to 50% of the pore volume of the support is formed by<br>
' macropores having a pore diameter in the range from 50 nm to 10,000 nm and from 50 to 90% of the pore volume of the support is formed by mesopores having a pore diameter in the range from 2 to 50 nm, where the sum of the pore volumes adds up to 100%, is excluded.<br>
 In  a  preferred  embodiment,   the  present  invention  provides   a  process   for<br><br>
hydrogenating a benzenepolycarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof or a mixture of two or more thereof, wherein the catalyst comprises as active metal at least one metal of transition group VIII of the Periodic Table either alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I or VII of the Periodic Table applied to a support,  where the support has a mean pore diameter of at least 50 nm and a BET surface area of at most 30 m /g and the amount of the active metal is from 0.01 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst (catalyst 1 .<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a process of this type in which the   catalyst comprises as active metal at least one metal of transition group VIII of the Periodic Table either alone or together with at least one metal of transition group I or VII of the Periodic Table in an amount of from 0.01 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst, applied to a support, where from 10 to 50%  of the pore volume of the support is formed by macropores having a pore diameter in the range  from 50 nm to 10,000 nm and from 50 to 90%  of the pore volume of the support is formed by mesopores having a pore diameter in the range from 2 to 50 nm. where the sum of the pore volumes adds up to 100% (catalyst 2 .<br>

Method of carrying out the process<br>
In the process of the present invention, the hydrogenation is generally carried out at from about 50 to 250 °C, preferably from about 70 to 220 °C. The pressures used here are generally above 10 bar, preferably from about 20 to about 300 bar.<br>
The process of the present invention can be carried out either continuously or batchwise, with preference being given to carrying out the process continuously.<br>
When the process is carried out continuously, the amount of the benzenepolycarboxylic acid or ester to be hydrogenated or of the mixture of two or more thereof is preferably from about 0.05 to about 3 kg per liter of catalyst per hour, more preferably from about 0.1 to about 1 kg per liter of catalyst per hour.<br><br>
As hydrogenation gases, it is possible to use any gases which comprise free hydrogen and do not contain harmful amounts of catalyst poisons such as CO. For example, waste gases from a reformer can be used. Preference is given to using pure hydrogen as hydrogenation gas.<br><br>
The hydrogenation of the present invention can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent or diluent, i.e. it is not necessary to carry out the hydrogenation in solution.<br>
 However, preference is given to using a solvent or diluent. Solvents or diluents which can be used are any suitable solvent or diluent. The choice is not critical as long as the solvent or diluent used is able to form a homogeneous solution with the benzenepolycarboxylic acid or ester to be hydrogenated. For example, the solvents or diluents can also comprise water.<br><br>
Examples of suitable solvents of  diluents include the following:<br>
straight-chain or cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, and also aliphatic alcohols in which the alkyl radical preferably has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, in  particular from 3 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of alcohols which are preferably used are i-propanol, n-butanol, i-butanol and n-hexanol.<br>
 Mixtures of these or other solvents or diluents can likewise be used.<br>
The amount of solvent or diluent used is not restricted in any particular way and can be selected freely depending on requirements. However, preference is given to amounts   which   lead   to   a   10-70%   strength   by   weight   solution   of  the  benzenepolycarboxylic acid or ester to be hydrogenated.<br><br>
In the process of the present invention, particular preference is given to using the product formed in the hydrogenation, i.e. the corresponding cyclohexane derivative, as solvent, if desired in addition to other solvents or diluents. In any case, part of the  product formed in the process can be mixed with the benzenepolycarboxylic acid still to be hydrogenated or the derivative thereof The amount of reaction product which is mixed in as solution or diluent is preferably from 1 to 30 times, particularly preferably from 5 to 20 times, in particular from 5 to 10 times, the weight of the compound to be hydrogenated.<br><br>
As mentioned above, the term "benzenepolycarboxylic acids or derivatives thereof used for the purposes of the present invention encompasses both the respective benzenepolycarboxylic acids as such and derivatives thereof, particularly monoesters, diesters or possibly triesters or tetraesters and also anhydrides of the benzenepoly-  carboxylic acids. The esters used are alkyl, cycloalkyl and alkoxyalkyl esters, where the alkyl, cycloalkyl and alkoxyalkyl groups generally have from 1 to 30, preferably from 2 to 20 and particularly preferably from 3 to 18, carbon atoms and can be branched or linear.<br>

top in an amount of 1 kg/h, and the product was vented in a container. The addition of hydrogen was continued as described above. Subsequently, no Palatinol N was found in the product. The selectivity with respect to the corresponding cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ester after the second hydrogenation was 99%. As side components, about 1% low boiling components (components having a lower boiling point compared to cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ester  were found. These components were reduced by means of a vapor distillation at 170 °C and a pressure of 50 mbar. The product consisted after this work-up of 99.7% cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid ester.<br><br><br><br>
