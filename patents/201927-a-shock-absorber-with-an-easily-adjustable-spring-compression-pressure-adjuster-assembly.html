The invention relates to a shock absorber with an easily adjustable spring compression pressure adjuster assembly.<br>
A spring pre-compression adjuster assembly in a conventional shock absorber is provided at the bottom end of the shock absorber which is connected to the axle side of a vehicle. Adjustment of the spring pre-compression is carried out by turning the position of the adjuster using a tool.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a shock absorber with an easily adjustable spring pre-compression adjuster assembly provided at the top end of the shock absorber.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the objective of the invention is to provide a shock absorber with an easily adjustable spring compression pressure adjuster assembly at the top end of the shock absorber between upper seat of the spring and the connecting means to a vehicle frame which can be operated by a thumb of the rider of a vehicle and realise different pre-determined spring compression pressures to the shock absorber depending upon the load on the vehicle and the road conditions.<br><br>
The spring compression adjuster assembly according to the invention comprises an adjuster body with a position projection seated in a profiled adjuster seat. The adjuster body gets seated in the profiled adjuster seat in at least two position locators in the profile of the adjuster seat matching with the position projection in the adjuster body. The adjuster body is provided with a thump knob for turning the adjuster body in the adjuster seat. The position locators in the profiled adjuster seat and the position projection in the adjuster body are such that when each projection in the adjuster body gets seated in a particular position locator in the adjuster seat, the shock absorber has a predetermined spring compression pressure. By pushing the thump knob provided on the adjuster body the position projection may be seated at various position locators in the adjuster seat to realise different predetermined spring compression pressures for the shock absorber. The position locators in the profiled adjuster seat and the position projection in the adjuster body can be made to realise spring compression pressures in a shock absorber suitable for the road conditions and the load on the vehicle. In a typical example a shock absorber used in a two wheeler may be provided with two position locators in the profiled adjuster seat to realise two different predetermined spring compression pressures. The lower compression pressure may be set for a single rider or good road conditions and the higher compression pressure may be set for double riders or bad road conditions. The spring compressions adjuster assemblies may be provided with right-hand profiled adjuster seat and left-hand profiled adjuster seat<br><br>
respectively to the right-hand shock absorbers and left-hand shock absorbers respectively.<br>
The adjuster body may accordingly be provided with a right-hand knob suitable for right-hand spring pressure adjuster assembly and a left-hand knob for a left-hand spring adjuster assembly. A shock absorber according to the invention may be provided with desired number of spring compression pressure settings by providing plurality of position locators in the profiled adjuster seat.<br>
Thus the invention provides a shock absorber with an easily adjustable spring compression pressure adjuster assembly, said shock-absorber comprising a cylinder-piston damper assembly with a top connecting means for connecting to a load such as vehicle frame, a bottom connecting means for connecting to a load bearing such as a vehicle axle, an outer spring located between a top spring seat and a bottom spring seat provided on the cylinder-piston damper assembly with a spring retainer, the said cylinder-piston damper assembly being provided with a dust protection tube characterised in that a spring compression pressure adjuster assembly is provided between the said top spring seat and the said top connecting means on a piston of the said cylinder-piston damper assembly, the said spring compression pressure adjuster assembly comprising a profiled adjuster seat having a profile in the seating area, and an adjuster body with a position projection for seating in the said profiled adjuster seat, the said position<br><br>
projection being capable of moving in the said profile and provide predetermined compression pressures to the outer spring when the position projection gets seated in successive position locators provided in the profile of the adjuster seat, a thump knob is provided on the said adjuster body on its periphery and spring compression pressure indicating means corresponding to the pre-determined spring compression pressures set by the spring compression pressure adjuster assembly.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the shock absorber according to the invention, position locators are provided in the profile in the adjuster seat to match with the position projection in the adjuster body, and the shock absorber can be set to at least two pre-determined spring compression pressures by turning the thump knob. Indicators is provided on the periphery of the adjuster assembly to indicate the spring compression pressure at each position settings of the thump knob.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS :<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a shock absorber with an easily adjustable spring compression pressure adjuster assembly. The shock absorber according to the invention comprises a cylinder-piston damper assembly (1) with a top connecting means (2), a bottom connecting means (3), and a spring (4) seated between a top spring seat (5) and a bottom spring seat (6) on the cylinder-piston damper assembly (1). A plastic protection tube (6) may be provided to the cylinder-piston damper assembly. A spring compression adjuster assembly (9, 10) is provided on the piston of cylinder-piston damper assembly (1), between the top spring seat (5) and top connecting means (2) of the shock absorber connecting to a load such as a vehicle frame. A bottom connecting means (2) is provided at the bottom side of the cylinder-piston damper assembly (1) for connecting to load bearing part such as axle of a vehicle.<br>
The indicated portion 'A' in figure 1 shows the easily adjustable spring compression adjuster assembly in a shock absorber according to the invention. The top connecting means (2) of the shock absorber is used for connecting the shock absorber with the vehicle frame is attached to the piston rod (11) of the piston-cylinder damper assembly (1). A profiled seat adjuster seat (9) is attached to the piston (11) acting as the center locator. The profile (P) in the profiled adjuster seat (9) is made for clockwise rotation in a right-hand shock absorber and for anti-clock wise rotation in a left-hand shock absorber. The said profile (P) in the adjuster seat (9) may be made with two or more posidon locators (PL). In a typical shock absorber used in<br><br>
a two wheeler, it is preferable to have at least two position locators in the profiled adjuster seat (9). The left-hand shock absorber is provided with an anticlock-wise profile (P.) and a right- hand shock absorber is provided with a clock-wise profile (P+).<br>
An adjuster body (10) passes through the piston (11) is seated in the adjuster seat (9). The adjuster body (10) is provided with a thump knob (K) on its periphery for turning the adjuster body (10). The adjuster body (10) is provided with a positioning projection (PP) which locate the adjuster body when in allignment with respective position locators (PL) provided in the profile (P) of the profiled adjuster seat (9). The positioning projection (PP) on the adjuster body (10) gets seated in the respective position locators (PL) in the profiled adjuster seat (9) and provide the predetermined spring compression pressure to the outer spring (4) of the shock absorber. A dust seal (12) is provided on the adjuster seat (9) to avoid entering of the dust in the adjuster assembly. Position indicators (PI) may be provided on the periphery of the adjuster assembly (4) to indicate the spring compression pressures when position projection (PP) gets seated in the successive position locators (PL) in the profile (P) of the profiled adjuster seat (9) during setting of the spring compression pressure in a shock absorber.<br><br>
In a typical use of the shock absorber according to the invention in a motor cycle, the spring compression pressures of left-hand shock absorber and right-hand shock absorber may be provided with respective spring pressure adjuster assemblies to suit the road conditions and to suit the use of the vehicle depending upon the number of riders.<br>
