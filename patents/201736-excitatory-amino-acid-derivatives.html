EXCITATORY AMINO ACID DERIVATIVES<br>
5       In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the transmission of nerve impulses is controlled by the interaction between a neurotransmit ter, that is released by a sending neuron, and a surface receptor on a receiving neuron, which causes excitation of this receiving neuron.  L-<br>
10  Glutamate, which is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the CNS, mediates the major excitatory pathway in mammals, and is referred to as an excitatory amino acid (EAA).  The receptors that respond to glutamate are called excitatory amino acid receptors (EAA receptors).  See Watkins &amp; Evans, Ann. Rev.<br>
15  Pharmacol. Toxicol., 21, 165 (1981); Monaghan, Bridges, and Cotman, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 29, 365 (1989); Watkins, Krogsgaard-Larsen, and Honore, Trans. Pharm. Sci., 11, 25 (1990).  The excitatory amino acids are of great physiological importance, playing a role in a variety of<br>
20  physiological processes, such as long-term potentiation (learning and memory), the development of synaptic plasticity, motor control, respiration, cardiovascular regulation, and sensory perception.<br>
Excitatory amino acid receptors are classified into two<br>
25  general types.  Receptors that are directly coupled to the opening of cation channels in the cell membrane of the neurons are termed "ionotropic".  This type of receptor has been subdivided into at least three subtypes, which are defined by the depolarizing actions of the selective agonists<br><br>
X-10435<br>
2<br>
W-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<br>
methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), and kainic acid (KA).  The second general type of receptor is the G-protein or second messenger-linked "metabotropic" excitatory araino 5  acid receptor.  This second type is coupled to multiple second messenger systems that lead to enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis, activation of phospholipase D, increases or decreases in c-AMP formation, and changes in ion channel function. Schoepp and Conn, Trends in Pharmacol.<br>
10  Sci.r 14, 13 (1993).  Both types of receptors appear not only to mediate normal synaptic transmission along excitatory pathways, but also participate in the modification of synaptic connections during development and throughout life. Schoepp, Bockaert, and Sladeczek, Trends in Pharmacol. Sci.,<br>
15  11, 508 (1990); McDonald and Johnson, Brain Research Reviews, 15, 41 (1990).<br>
The excessive or inappropriate stimulation of excitatory amino acid receptors leads to neuronal cell damage or loss by way of a mechanism known as excitotoxicity.  This process has<br>
20  been suggested to mediate neuronal degeneration in a variety of conditions.  The medical consequences of such neuronal degeneration makes the abatement of these degenerative neurological processes an important therapeutic goal. The metabotropic glutamate receptors are a highly<br>
25  heterogeneous family of glutamate receptors that are linked to multiple second-messenger pathways.  These receptors function to modulate the presynaptic release of glutamate, and the postsynaptic sensitivity of the neuronal cell to glutamate excitation.  Compounds which modulate the function<br>
30  of these receptors, in particular agonists and antagonists of glutamate, are useful for the treatment of acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions, and as antipsychotic, anticonvulsant, analgesic, anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-emetic agents.<br>

Many of the intermediates described herein, for example the compounds of formula II, III and IV are believed to be novel, and are provided as further aspects of the invention. The particular dose of compound administered according 5  to this invention will of course be determined by the<br>
particular circumstances surrounding the case, including the compound administered, the route of administration, the particular condition being treated, and similar considerations.  The compounds can be administered by a<br>
10  variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intranasal routes.  Alternatively, the compound may be administered by continuous infusion.  A typical daily dose will contain from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of the active compound c<br>
15  this invention.  Preferably, daily doses will be about 0.05<br>
mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, more preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg.<br>
A variety of physiological functions have been shown to be subject to influence by excessive or inappropriate<br>
20  stimulation of excitatory amino acid transmission.  The<br>
formula I compounds of the present invention are believed to have the ability to treat a variety of neurological disorders in mammals associated with this condition, including acute neurological disorders such as cerebral deficits subsequent<br>
25  to cardiac bypass surgery and grafting, stroke, cerebral<br>
ischemia, spinal cord trauma, head trauma, perinatal hypoxia, cardiac arrest, and hypoglycemic neuronal damage.  The formula I compounds are believed to have the ability to treat a variety of chronic neurological disorders, such as<br>
30  Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's Chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, AIDS-induced dementia, ocular damage and retinopathy, cognitive disorders, and idopathic and drug-induced Parkinson's.  The present invention also provides methods for treating these disorders which comprises<br>
35  administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically<br><br>
X-10435<br>
17<br>
acceptable metabolically labile ester or amide thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The formula I compounds of the present invention are also believed to have the ability to treat a variety of other 5  neurological disorders in mammals that are associated with glutamate dysfunction, including muscular spasms, convulsions, migraine headaches, urinary incontinence, nicotine withdrawal, psychosis, (such as schizophrenia), drug tolerance, withdrawal and cessation (i.e. opiates,<br>
10  benzodiazepines, nicotine, cocaine or ethanol), smoking<br>
cessation, anxiety and related disorders (e.g. panic attack and stress-related disorders), emesis, brain edema, chronic pain, sleep disorder, Toeurettes syndrome, attention deficit disorder, and tardive dyskinesia.  The formula I compounds<br>
15  are also useful as antidepressant and analgesic agents.<br>
Therefore, the present invention also provides methods for treating these disorders which comprise administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of the compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable metabolically<br>
20  labile ester or amide thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Experiments were performed to demonstrate the ability of the formula I compounds to affect the excitatory amino acid receptors.  The affinity for metabotropic glutamate receptors<br>
25  was demonstrated by the selective displacement of IS, 3i?-ACPD-sensitive [^H]glutamate binding to rat brain cell membranes. The binding of [^H]glutamate was conducted with crude membranes of rat forebrain as described by Schoepp and True. Schoepp and True, Neuroscience Lett., 145, 100-104 (1992) and<br>
30  Wright et al., J. Neurochemistry 63: 938-945 (1994).  For<br>
example, the compound of Example 1 was found to have an IC50 of 0.055 \JM in this test.<br>
Based on studies of receptor mediated changes in intracellar second messengers, metabotropic glutamate<br>
35  receptor are either coupled to enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis or decreases in forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation.  Compounds may also be tested for ability to<br><br>
X-10435<br>
18<br>
prevent inhibition of forskolin (30 \iU) -stimulated cAMP formation by an mGluR agonist  (1S,3R-ACPD, 20 ^M) using slices of the rat hippocampus as described by D.D. Schoepp and B.G. Johnson, Neurochemistry International  22: 277-283 5   (1993) and human mGluR2 expressing non-neuronal cells (D.D. Schoepp et al., Neuropharmacology , 34, 843-850, 1995). According to another aspect, the present invention provides a method of modulating one or more metabotropic glutamate receptor functions in a warm-blooded mammal which 10  comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a non-toxic metabolically labile ester or amide thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are preferably formulated prior to administration.  Therefore, another 15  aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. The present pharmaceutical formulations are prepared by known procedures using well-known and readily available 20  ingredients.  In making the compositions of the present<br>
invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier, and may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container.  When the carrier serves as a diluent, it 25  may be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient, or medium for the active ingredient. The compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols, ointments containing, 30  for example, up to 10% by weight of active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.<br>
