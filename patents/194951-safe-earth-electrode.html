THIS INVENTION RELATES TO ELECTRICAL SAFETY DEVICES (ELECTRICAL EARTHING/GROUNDING EQUIPMENTS) AND AS SUCH THE INVENTION PERTAINS TO ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING  TECHNOLOGY.<br>
This Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.) is oriented to the safety of the customers, equipments and public in general. It is designed and made exclusively for electrical earthing/grounding purpose with assured long life. The latest innovation ensures long life and safety of the men, machines and materials which is the very object of the invention.<br>
It is well known in the earthing methodology that until the invention of this safe earth electrode, peoples were using the conventional method of earthing by putting an iron pipe inside the earth and layers of salts charcoal and sand are put around the earth pipe. Sometimes, even a metallic plate is also connected at the bottom end of the pipe. Since salt and charcoal causes the rapid corrosion of the earth pipe, the essentiality of effective earthing is defeated. Further, charcoal will not be freely available in future as kerosene oil and cooking gas become very popular and are being used widely by people.<br>
It is known fact that generally, people forget about earthing, once it is installed, no one pays any attention and bothers to check unless and until something goes wrong and finds faults in earthing. Therefore EARTHING is absolutely essential to any one in the universe using the electricity. Sound and effective earthing will not only ensures safety to our lives, but also to our property. To make as electrical earthing as mandatory, all the electrical appliances manufacturers are forced through electrical standard / specifications world wide to provide EARTH TERMINAL in all electrical appliances .motors and machineries. The third pin (earth pin) in the plug and socket plays a vital role in human lives. By spending a very negligible amount for effective earthing, one can say not only the precious human life but many more things. This is the object of the invention.<br>
This Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.) is based on pipe in pipe technology and is manufactured by using MS pipe (class-B). These pipes are subjected to hot dip galvanisation giving a thick (80-1 OOÎ¼) zinc coating on the entire (inner and outer) surfaces of the earth pipe, the annular space between the pipes is filled with a Electrical Conductor Mineral (Crystalline Conductive Mixture) through which any earth fault current /surge current caused due to faulty equipment or any reason, will be rapidly passed on to the Earth in no time. This latest technology protects the main earth electrode from corrosion and ensures its life to many more decades. This is the main feature of the invention.<br><br>
Other salient feature of invention as follows:<br>
=&gt; Revolution   in   earthing   technology   for   industrial/domestic   earthing<br>
requirements. =&gt; Very simple installation (Ready Made Earthing). =&gt; Corrosion resistant, whether Proof, Water Resistant, Maintenance Free,<br>
Highly Durable. =&gt; "Fit &amp; Forget" installation and Life saving and cost saving. =&gt; Increases the life of the Earthing System. =&gt; Indigenous Technology =&gt; Entirely fabricated at the factory itself to clients requirement.<br>
Accordingly, the primary object of the invention is to invent a durable earth electrode, which is very safe.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a performance oriented safe earth electrode, which is not liable to corrosion and which is sturdy and long lasting.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a best safe earth electrode which is weather proof, water resistant, maintenance free, highly durable and life saving.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be clear from the following description.<br>
Accordingly, the invention is directed towards the creation / manufacture of a safe earthing electrode. The Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.) comprises a specially shaped (strip, pipe ,flat bar, solid round bar, solid square bar, polygon shaped solid or hollow bar) inner main electrode, and outer shell electrode (auxiliary electrode in cylindrical pipe or polygon shape) surrounding the inner electrode. There is an annular space between said inner electrode and outer electrode; the said annular space filled with a special compound, the said compound is anticorrosive and having good electrical conducting property, means for holding the electrode and connecting means for connecting plurality of electrical connections with earth electrode.<br>
Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.) comprises a specially shaped (Pipe / Flat / Angle / Triangle / Solid Bar / Square Bar) inner main electrode, and outer shell (auxiliary electrode in Pipe / Triangle / Square shape) electrode surrounding the inner electrode, the said inner electrode &amp; outer electrode being separated by an annular space, the said space filled with a special compound namely Crystalline Conductive Mixture (Electrical Conductor Minerals) the said compound is anti corrosive &amp; having good conductive property protects the main electrode.<br><br>
Now the invention will be described in detail with reference to drawings accompanying this complete specification.<br>
Figure 1 shows in elevation the construction aspects of this novel Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.)<br>
Figure 2 shows in elevation the fixing and installation aspects of this novel Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.).<br>
Referring to the drawings, it is evident that the device (6) namely Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.) according to this invention contain two main parts namely main earth electrode and outer shell (auxiliary electrode) of the main earth electrode.<br>
Main Earth Electrode as referred by numeral (1). The Main Earth Electrode is generally made of G.l./Copper Pipe of 12 SWG with an outer diameter of 20 mm in case of type 19 and 40 mm in the case of type 39. The length of the pipe is either 2.0 meters or 3.0 meters. The pipe is flattened approx 50mm at both the ends and a round plate welded at one end and a 16 mm hole is made at the other end.<br>
Outer shell (auxiliary electrode) of the main earth electrode is denoted by numeral (2). This is also made of G.l./Copper Pipe of 19 SWG with a diameter of 38mm in the case of type 19 and G.l./Copper Pipe of 16 SWG with a diameter of 76 mm in the case of type 39. The length of the pipe is 50mm less than that of main earth electrode pipe. The main earth electrode pipe (1) inserted into it and the bottom a base plate (4) is welded.<br>
Initially the complete Earthing Electrode (6) is subjected to hot dip galvanization and then the dry film thickness of galvanization is approx between 80 to 100 microns. A special type of compound (3) is filled in between the two pipes. A hole (5) is provided for connecting the electrode with electrical device.<br>
It is to be denoted that the dimensions of the Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.) may vary according to the client's requirements. Two accessories namely earth electrode holder (8) and Gl terminal plate (9) are provided along with the Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.).<br><br>
The working of Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.) is as simple as any other electrode available in the market. The installation of the electrode is also very easy. Just dig a hole of required size and depth, place the earth electrode (6) in to it and simply refill the hole with earth (soil) (7).<br>
The Unique feature of the innovation is in the filling compound which is a very high conductor of electricity and having a very good anti-corrosive property as well, which protects the main earth pipe from being corroded i.e. It works as a shield for the inner earth pipe and hence increasing the extra effective thickness of pipe approx. 20 mm in case of type-39 electrode and 10 mm in case of type-19 electrode.<br>
In the conventional earth electrodes, which are already available in the market, there is no such protection provided and the electrode pipes are eaten away by corrosion in a very short period. In the ASHLOK Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.), the compound is anti corrosive as well as good conductor of electricity. Thus, it gives the maintenance free very long life and reliable service. This is another important feature of the invention.<br>
This special compound, which is produced, specifically for electrode (cathodic) protection. The method of manufacture of the said compound is described in the following description.<br>
At first, a carbon of desired characteristic is selected and then some of the other compounds (listed below) are mixed with it in certain proportion and percentage under exacting and controlled conditions. After few tests to check the conductivity and anti-corrosive properties of the compound, this special compound is ready for use.<br>
The chemicals/minerals used in the manufacture of this special compound are as follows:-<br>
1.	Carbon Powder<br>
2.	NaCI<br>
3.	AgCI<br>
4.	H2S04<br>
5.	CaC03<br>
6.	ZnS04<br>
7.	HNO3<br>
8.	Phenol Formaldehyde<br>
9.	Patricia<br><br>
Salient feature of the invention is in the provision of chemical compound in between main pipe and outer shell (auxiliary electrode). After the proper ratio of these chemical compounds with some catalysts in different stages of the process, a very highly conductive and non-corrosive compound ("Crystalline Conductor Mixture,) is obtained. This resultant compound is used for filling the annular space between the pipes. These two properties (highly conductive and non-corrosive) used in this Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.) advantageously. This chemical compound thereby enhances the longevity of the earthing electrode as well.<br>
It is to be noted that the conventional earth electrode is corroded after some duration of time. The corroded portion will loose its effect of conduction and only non-corroded part of the electrode will conduct electricity. The moisture content is also one essential requirement for proper use of electrodes. If, the conductive portion of the electrode does not have sufficient moisture content around it, practically the earth electrode ceases to function as an earthing.<br>
During the course of time of use of this Safe Earthing Electrode (S.E.E.), outer shell (auxiliary electrode) pipe wither away due to oxidation. However, the chemical compound (Crystalline Conductor Mixture) will protect the main earth electrode (pipe) from corrosive atmosphere. Further, the compound by itself has inherent property of conducting electricity. Hence, this novel contrivance gives 100 % conducting environment. This is the very vital feature of the invention.<br>
THE METHOD OF INSTALLATION OF THIS NOVEL SAFE EARTHING ELECTRODE (S.E.E.) is AS FOLLOWS: -<br>
1.	Dig a hole of approx. 8" dia in the proposed place on the earth (Which shall have high humidity in normal course - clay soils are preferred), and insert the ELECTRODE by keeping the connecting terminal 4 inches above the EARTH<br>
2.	Simply keep the ELECTODE in the hole and fill with the soil which had been removed while digging.<br>
3.	Consolidate the soil with hand and pour some water around the ELECTODE.<br>
4.	From the terminal provided on the top of the ELECTRODE, an appropriate earthing Copper / G.I. wire / flat strip can be taken to the points where-ever earthing termination is required.<br>
5.	Hammering &amp; drilling shall be strictly avoided which will damage the ELECTRODE.<br><br>
COMPARISON    BETWEEN    USING    TRADITIONAL    EARTHING    AND ASHLDK SAFE EARTHING ELECTRODE (S.E.E.):<br><br><br><br>
ADVANTAGE DF THE INVENTION<br>
*	Revolution in Earthing Technology for Domestic &amp; Industrial<br>
