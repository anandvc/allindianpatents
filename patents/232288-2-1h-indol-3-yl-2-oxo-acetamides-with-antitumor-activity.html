A solution of ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate (7.02 ml) and ammonium acetate (11.8 g) in absolute ethanol (180 ml) is refiuxed for 3 hours. After a night at room temperature the solution is concentrated to dryness by distillation under reduced pressure and the resulting residue is purified by flash chromatography (silica gel, 200g; eluent CH2Cl2/MeOH/TEA 15/5/02), to give 6.53 g of ethyl (Z)-3-amino-4-chloro-2-butenoate as dark oil which is used without further purifications.<br>
1H-NMR (DMSO-d6, ppm): 1.20 (t, 3H); 4.0 (q, 2H); 4.15 (s, 2H); 4.65 (s, 1H); 6-80-7.75 (br.s,2H).<br>
The Z conformation around the double bond is confirmed by NOE nuclear magnetic resonance tests.<br>
The resulting product (6.30 g) is dissolved in dry dimethylformamide and the solution is heated under nitrogen atmosphere at 100°C for 2h.30' and subsequently at 130°C for lh.30'. Dimethylformamide is subsequently distilled off under reduced pressure at 90°C and the resulting residue is dissolved in absolute ethanol (50 ml) and treated with active charcoal (1.5 g). After filtering off charcoal, the filtrate is concentrated to dryness to give a residue which is purified by flash chromatography (silica gel, 190 g; eluent CH2Cl2/MeOH 9/1). Chromatographic fractions containing the product are combined, concentrated to dryness and the residue is crystallized from ethyl acetate (3 ml) and isopropyl etheT (6 ml), to obtain 2.54 g of 4-amino-5H-furan-2-one.<br>
m.p. 157-159°C<br>
1H-NMR (DMSO-d6, ppm): 4.45 (s, 1H); 4.57 (s, 2H); 7.20 (br. s, 2H).<br>
Preparation 2: l-(2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl)indole<br>
A solution of indole (1.185 g) in dry DMSO (3 ml) is dropped into a suspension<br>
of sodium hydride (60% mineral oil suspension; 0.44 g) in dry DMSO (10 ml). After<br>
two hours, the resulting solution   is added with a solution of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl<br>
chloride (1.9 g) in dry DMSO (2 ml) heating at 60°C for 6 h. The reaction mixture is<br>
kept at room temperature overnight, then poured into water (250 ml) extracted with ethyl acetate and dried (Na2S04). The drying agent is filtered off, the solvent is<br>
evaporated off under reduced pressure and the resulting residue is purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluent n-hexane/AcOEt 9/1) to obtain 2.2 g of 1-(2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl)indole.<br>
m.p. 79-81°C<br>
Preparation 3: l-(n-octyl)indole<br>
A solution of indole (1.0 g) in dry DMSO (1 ml) is dropped into a suspension of<br>
sodium hydride (60% mineral oil suspension; 0.37 g) in dry DMSO (20 ml). The<br>
i. j mixture is heated at 60°C for   lh. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting<br>
solution is added dropwise with a solution of n-octyl bromide (2.82 ml) in dry DMSO<br>
(2.8 ml). After a night at room temperature, the reaction mixture is poured into water<br>
(200 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 ml). The combined organic phases<br>
are washed with a NaCl saturated solution, dried and evaporated to dryness. The<br>
resulting residue is purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluent n-hexane),<br>

4~amrno-5H-thiophen-2-one<br>
Commercially available 4-hydroxy-2(5H)-thiophenone (1.16 g) is added to molten ammonium acetate (3.08 g) kept at 130°C. After 30' the molten mixture is cooled and added with 1,2-dimethoxyethane (50 ml). After stirring for 30', the solid is removed by filtration and discarded. The dimethoxyethane solution is concentrated to dryness to give a solid residue which is purified by silica gel column chromatography. Elution is performed initially with CH2Cl2/MeOH 9/1 followed by CH2Cl2/MeOH 8/2. The fastest moving fractions containing the product are pooled and concentrated to dryness, to give 4-amino-5H-tbiophen-2-one (0.43 g).<br>
