Description<br>
Metal complex Colouning Agents based on Bucherered naphthols<br>
The present invention relates to novel reactive dyes, processes for their<br>
preparation and their use for dyeing or printing textile fiber materials.<br>
Reactive dyes for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing<br>
materials these days must combine good general fastness properties with good<br>
washoff of the unfixed portions. Given the dyes available at present, there is<br>
accordingly room for improvement.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel, improved reactive dyes<br>
for the dyeing and printing of hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials,<br>
especially fiber materials, that combine good general fastness properties,<br>
especially a high lightfastness, with good washoff of the unfixed portions.<br>
This object is surprisingly achieved by the hereinbelow described dyes according<br>
to the invention.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides reactive copper, cobalt or chromium<br>
complex compounds of the general formula (1)<br><br><br>
where<br>
B is a direct bond or a bridge member;<br>
X is a fiber-reactive structural element;<br>
W1 is vinyl or a group of the formula - CH2-CH2-V, where V is an alkali-<br>
eliminable radical;<br>
R1, R2 are independently hydrogen, chlorine, alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms, such<br>
as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, tert-butyl, alkoxy<br>
of 1 -4 carbon atoms, such as methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy,<br>
i-propyloxy, carboxyl or sulfamoyl, hydrogen, hydroxyl or sulfo,<br>
preferably hydrogen;<br>
R3 is hydrogen, hydroxyl, carboxyl or sulfo;<br>
R4 is hydrogen or sulfo;<br>
R5 is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which can be substituted by<br>
halogen, hydroxyl, cyano, alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms,<br>
alkoxycarbonyl of 2 to 5 carbon atoms, carboxyl, sulfo or sulfato;<br>
h, k, I, m are independently 0 or 1;<br>
Me is copper, cobalt or chromium, preferably copper and cobalt and<br>
particularly preferably copper;<br>
M is hydrogen or an alkali metal, such as sodium, potassium or lithium,<br>
or the mole equivalent of an alkaline earth metal, such as calcium, and<br>
preferably is hydrogen or an alkali metal.<br><br>
Suitable fiber-reactive radicals X, i.e., those which react with the OH or NH<br>
groups of the fiber under dyeing conditions to form covalent bonds, are for<br>
example -SO2Ch = CH2 or -SO2CH2CH2V, where a V grouping, which can be<br>
eliminated through the action of alkali, represents in particular radicals of the<br>
formula -OSO3M, thiosulfato of the formula -SSO3M, acetyloxy of the formula<br>
-OCOCH3, phosphato of the formula -OPO(OM)2 and chloro, bromo, benzyloxy of<br>
the formula -OCOC6H5, phenylsulfonyloxy of the formula -SO2-C6H5 or<br>
pyridinium, which may be substituted, for example by alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms,<br>
carboxyl, sulfo, cyano or carbamoyl, where M is as defined above, or are fiber-<br>
reactive radicals X, especially those which contain at least one reactive<br>
substituent attached to a 5- or 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic ring, for<br>
example to a monoazine, diazine or triazine ring, especially a pyridine, pyrimidine,<br>
pyridazine, pyrazine, thiazine, oxazine or asymmetrical or symmetrical triazine<br>
ring, or to such a ring system that comprises one or more fused-on aromatic<br>
carbocyclic rings, for example a quinoline, phthalazine, cinnoline, quinazoline,<br>
quinoxaline, acridine, phenazine or phenanthridine ring system.<br>
Fiber-reactive radicals selected from the pyrimidines or triazines are particularly<br>
suitable.<br>
Examples of reactive substituents on the heterocycle include halogen (Cl, Br or<br>
F), ammonium including hydrazinium, pyridinium, picolinium, carboxypyridinium,<br>
sulfonium, sulfonyl, azido(N3), thiocyanato, sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid.<br>
X can accordingly be in particular<br><br>
where<br>
Hal = Cl, F and<br>
A is the radical of an amine AH which may be unsubstituted or substituted<br><br>
by one or two C1-C6 alkyl groups, which may independently be substituted<br>
by hydroxyl, C1-C2 alkoxy groups, sulfato, phenyl or hydroxycarbonyl, or<br>
by a phenyl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or two<br>
substituents selected from the group consisting of C1-C2-alkyl,<br>
C1-C2-alkoxy, C1-C2-alkoxyalkyl, C1-C2-alkoxyalkoxy, amino, hydroxyl,<br>
chlorine, sulfo, sulfomethyl, sulfonamide, carboxyl, carboxamide,<br>
carboxylic ester, nitrile, aminocarboxamide and oxalamino or by a naphthyl<br>
radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by one, two or three sulfo<br>
groups or is taurine, N-methyltaurine, methylaminomethanesulfonic acid,<br>

For example, the dyes of the general formula (1-1) according to the invention are<br>

sulfonyl compounds.<br>
The coupling components of the general formula (1-3) according to the invention<br>
are preferably prepared by Bucherer reaction of the corresponding naphthols or<br>
naphthylamines with 2-aminophenols of the general formula (1-5)<br><br>
where M, R2, W1, m and I are each as defined above.<br>
The conditions of the Bucherer reaction are known per se, for example from<br>
GB-A-230 457 and CS 155758; it is preferably carried out in water at 80°C and<br>
130°C, particularly preferably between 100°C and 130°C.<br>
Starting compounds for the Bucherer reaction are for example 1 -hydroxy-<br>
7-aminonaphthalene-3-sulfonic acid, 1,7-dihydroxynaphthalene-3-sulfonic acid,<br>

3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2-amino-4-(?-sulfatoethylsulfonyl)phenol, 2-amino-<br>
4-(?-hydroxyethylsulfonyl)phenol-6-sulfonic acid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the preparative process, the Bucherer reaction was<br>
carried out using aminophenol of the general formula (1-5) where W2 is<br>
hydroxyethyl and I is 1. For instance, a compound of the general formula (1-4)<br><br>
where R3 and R4 are each as defined above and R6 is hydroxyl or amino, is<br>
adjusted to a pH of 5.7 in water and 39% sodium hydrogensulfite solution using<br>
33% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution together with a compound of the<br>
general formula (1-5)<br><br>
where M, R2, W1, m and I are each as defined above. If appropriate, the addition<br>
of sodium chloride is followed by refluxing the reaction mixture at 100°C to<br>
110°C for 20 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the product of the<br>
formula (1-3)<br><br><br>
where R2, R3, R4 and m are each as defined above, W1 is hydroxyethyl and I is 1,<br>
is isolated, washed with saturated sodium chloride solution and dried.<br>
The resultant compound of the general formula (1-3) where W1 is hydroxyethyl<br>
and I and m are each 1 is subsequently converted by customary methods, for<br>
example using anhydrous sulfuric acid as described in EP-A- 0568876, into the<br>
corresponding sulfuric ester, i.e., into a compound of the general formula (1-3)<br>
where W1 is ?-sulfatoethyl.<br>
The diazotization of the compounds of the general formula (1-2) and also the<br>
coupling reaction with the compound of the general formula (1-3) are known per<br>
se to one skilled in the art and can be carried out in the generally customary<br>
manner extensively described in the pertinent literature.<br>
The thus obtainable monoazo compounds of the general formula (1-6)<br><br>
where<br>
h is 0;<br>
B is a direct bond and<br>
X is S02W1 and -M, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R5", W1, I, m and k are each as defined<br>
above are new and likewise form part of the subject matter of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
The compounds of the general formula (1-6) according to the invention are<br>
treated with a copper, cobalt or chromium donor in the presence or absence of<br>
an oxidizing agent or in the presence or absence of a demethylating agent. This<br>
reaction with copper, cobalt or chromium donors is effected similarly to known<br>
processes for synthesizing metal complexes.<br>
Monoazo compounds of the general formula (1-6) are preferably treated with the<br>
metal donors in an aqueous medium at a temperature between 0 and 130°C, if<br>
appropriate by refluxing or under superatmospheric pressure in a closed vessel.<br>
When metal complex formation is carried out as an oxidative coppering, i.e.,<br>
when R5 is a hydrogen atom in the compounds of the formula (1-6), a customary<br>
oxidizing agent is added.<br>
The metal donors used in the metal complex formation process according to the<br>
invention are for example salts of copper, of cobalt and of chromium which are<br>
capable of donating the respective metal in the form of a cation to the complex<br>
formation capable hydroxyl groups in the compounds of the formula (1-1) which<br>
may have become formed in the oxidative or dealkylating metallization, for<br>
example copper sulfate, copper carbonate, cobalt sulfate, cobalt acetate and<br>
chromium sulfate; such compounds useful as metal complex formers also include<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acids or dicarboxylic acids which contain the metal bound in a<br>
complexed form, for example complex cobalt or chromium compounds of<br>
aliphatic hydrocarboxylic acids or of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, especially of<br>
alkanes of 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or chromium complex compounds of aromatic<br>
o-hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example the chromium or cobalt complex<br>
compounds of salicylic acid, of citric acid, of lactic acid, of glycolic acid or of<br>
tartaric acid.<br>
The monoazo compounds of the general formula (1-1) according to the invention<br>
can be separated and isolated from the aqueous synthesis solutions according to<br>
generally known methods for water-soluble compounds, for example by<br>
precipitating from the reaction medium by means of an electrolyte, for example<br>
sodium chloride or potassium chloride, or by evaporating the reaction solution<br>
itself, for example by spray drying. When the latter form of isolation is chosen, it<br>
is frequently advisable to precede the evaporating by removing any sulfate<br><br>
present in the solutions by precipitation as calcium sulfate and removal by<br>
filtration or pressure permeation.<br>
The dyes of the general formula (1) according to the invention are further<br>
obtainable for example by reacting equivalent amounts of amino compounds of<br>
the general formula (3a) and (3b)<br><br>
where<br>
Me, R1 to R10 I, m, k, x, y and z are each as defined above, with a compound of<br>
the general formula (4)<br><br><br>

Further useful dyes of the general formula (1) are obtained by reacting<br>
compounds of the general formula (3a) with compounds of the general formula<br>
X-Hal, where X and Hal are each as defined above. In a particular embodiment,<br>
compounds of the general formula (3a) are reacted with compounds of the<br>
general formula<br><br>
in a conventional manner.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of the general formula (3a) are first reacted with<br><br>
preferably cyanuric chloride or cyanuric fluoride and then with amines of the<br>
general formula AH, where AH is as defined above.<br>
The process steps described are comprised in the prior art.<br>
The invention further provides a process for preparing compounds of the general<br><br>
formula (3)<br><br>
where R1 to R5, Me and B, k, I, m, W1, M are each as defined above.<br>
Compounds of the general formula (3) are new and likewise form part of the<br>
subject matter of the invention. They are obtainable starting from amino<br>
compounds of the general formula (8a) or (8b)<br><br>
where L is a hydrolyzable protecting group, for example formyl, C1-C4-alkyl-<br>
carbonyl or C1-C4-alkoxycarbonyl, especially acetyl, and M, B, R1 and R5 and also<br>
k are each as defined above, by diazotization and coupling onto a compound of<br>
the formula (1-3)<br><br><br>
where R2, R3, R4, W1 I and m are each as defined above, at a temperature<br>
between 0°C and 3D°C, preferably between 10°C and 40°C, and at a pH less<br>
than 6, preferably between 0.5 and 4.0, and subsequent reaction with copper,<br>
cobalt or chromium donors similarly to familiar processes for synthesizing metal<br>
complexes, and subsequent reduction of the nitro group in a conventional<br>
manner or hydrolysis, preferably alkaline hydrolysis, similarly to known<br>
procedures, of the protected amino group.<br>

The reactive dyes of the general formula (1) according to the invention possess<br>
useful application properties. They are used for the dyeing and printing of<br>
hydroxyl- and/or carboxamide-containing materials, for example in the form of<br>
sheetlike structures, such as paper and leather, or of films, of polyamide for<br>
example, or in bulk, as for example polyamide and polyurethane, but especially in<br>
the form of fibers of the materials mentioned. Preferably they are used for dyeing<br>
and printing cellulosic fiber materials of any kind. They are also useful for dyeing<br>
and printing hydroxyl-containing fibers present in blend fabrics, for example<br>
blends of cotton with polyester fibers or polyamide fibers. It is also possible to<br>
use them to print textiles or paper by the inkjet process.<br>
The present invention accordingly also provides for the use of the reactive dyes<br>
of the general formula (1) according to the invention for dyeing or printing the<br>
materials mentioned and processes for dyeing or printing such materials in a<br>
conventional manner by using one or more reactive dyes of the general<br>
formula (1) according to the invention as a colorant. For this, the as-synthesized<br><br>
solutions of the reactive dyes of the general formula (1) according to the<br>
invention can be used directly as a liquid preparation for dyeing, if appropriate<br>
after addition of a buffer substance and similarly if appropriate after<br>
concentrating.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for<br>
example cellulose fiber materials or regenerated products thereof and polyvinyl<br>
alcohols. Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable<br>
fibers, such as linen, hemp, jute and Ramie fibers. Regenerated cellulose fibers<br>
are for example staple viscose and filament viscose.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural<br>
polyamides and polyurethane, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool<br>
and other animal hairs, silk, leather, nylon-6,6, nylon-6, nylon-11 and nylon-4.<br>
The fiber materials can also be processed and dyed in blends with each other or<br>
contain fiber materials of a different chemical nature, such as polyester fibers.<br>
Examples thereof are blend fabrics of cellulose fibers and polyester fibers and<br>
also of cellulose fibers and polyamide fibers.<br>
The dyes according to the invention can be applied to and fixed on the<br>
substrates mentioned, especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application<br>
techniques known for water-soluble, fiber-reactive dyes, in accordance with the<br>
use of the invention, for example by applying the compounds of the general<br>
formula (1) in dissolved form to the substrate or incorporating them thereinto and<br>
fixing them thereon or therein by heating or by the action of an alkaline agent or<br>
by both measures. Such dyeing and fixing processes are extensively described in<br>
the literature, for example in EP-A-0 181 585.<br>
Thus the compounds (1) are useful not only for the exhaust dyeing process but<br>
also for dyeing by the pad dyeing process, whereby the material is impregnated<br>
with aqueous solutions of the dyes according to the invention, which may<br>
contain electrolyte salt, and fixed on the material in the manner mentioned<br>
above. The compounds of the general formula (1) according to the invention are<br><br>
particularly useful for cold pad-batch processes, whereby a dye is applied to the<br>
fiber material on a pad mangle together with alkali and is fixed by storing at room<br>
temperature for several hours. After fixing, the dyeings and prints obtained are<br>
thoroughly washed with cold and hot water, if appropriate in the presence of an<br>
agent which has a dispersing action and promotes the diffusion of unfixed<br>
portions.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (1) are notable for high reactivity, good<br>
flexibility and good build-up capacity. They can therefore be used for exhaust<br>
dyeing at low dyeing temperatures and require only short steaming times in pad-<br>
steam processes. The fixation yields are high, and the unfixed portions are<br>
readily washed off with the difference between the degree of exhaustion and the<br>
degree of fixation being remarkably small, i.e., the loss through hydrolysis being<br>
very small. The compounds of the general formula (1) are also particularly useful<br>
in textile printing processes, especially on cellulose fiber materials, such as<br>
cotton, but also for printing carboxamide-containing fiber material, for example<br>
wool and silk, or blend fabrics containing wool or silk. They are similarly very<br>
useful in discharge printing and resist printing processes.<br>
The dyeings and prints prepared with the compounds of the general formula (1)<br>
according to the invention, on cellulose fiber materials in particular, have a high<br>
color strength and a high fiber-dye bond stability not only in the acidic but also in<br>
the alkaline range, also good lightfastness, including very good wet lightfastness,<br>
and also generally good wetfastnesses, such as good fastness to washing,<br>
water, seawater, crossdyeing and perspiration, and also very good perspiration<br>
lightfastnesses, further good fastness to pleating and dry heat setting and<br>
rubbing.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention.<br>
The compounds described in the examples by means of a formula are indicated in<br>
the form of the free acids; generally they are prepared and isolated in the form of<br>
their alkali metal salts, such as lithium, sodium or potassium salts, and used for<br><br>
dyeing in the form of their salts. Similarly, the starting compounds and<br>
components mentioned in the examples hereinbelow, especially the table<br>
examples, in the form of the free acid may be used in the synthesis as such or in<br>
the form of their salts, preferably alkali metal salts.<br>
The absorption maxima (?max) in the visible region reported for the compounds of<br>
the invention were determined on their alkali metal salts in aqueous solution. The<br>
table examples report the ?max values in brackets next to the hue; the wavelength<br>
is given in nm.<br>
