				<td>ALPHA-2-DELTA LIGAND TO TREAT LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS<br>
This invention relates to a new use of alpha-2-delta ligands and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives. In particular it relates to a new use of gabapentin and pregabalin.<br>
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) comprise three groups of symptoms, which are irritative, obstructive and post micturition symptoms. Irritative symptoms comprise urgency, frequency and nocturia, which can be associated with: overactive bladder (OAB) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).<br>
Over Active Bladder (OAB) is defined as urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia [Abrams et al., Neurourology and Urodynamics 21:167-178 (2002)]. Prevalence of OAB in men and women is similar, with approximately 16% of the population of the USA suffering from the condition [Stewart et al, Prevalence of Overactive Bladder in the United States: Results from the NOBLE Program; Abstract Presented at the 2nd International Consultation on Incontinence, July 2001, Paris, France].<br>
The terms OAB Wet and OAB Dry describe OAB patients with or without urinary incontinence respectively. Until recently, the cardinal symptom of OAB was believed to be urinary incontinence. However, with the advent of the new terms this is clearly not meaningful for the large number of sufferers who are not incontinent (i.e. OAB Dry patients). Thus, a recent study from Liberman et al [Health Related Quality of Life Among Adults with Symptoms of Overactive Bladder: Results From A US Community-Based Survey; Urology 57(6), 1044-1050, 2001] examined the impact of all OAB symptoms on the quality of life of a community-based sample of the US population. This study demonstrated that individuals suffering from OAB without any demonstrable loss of urine have an impaired quality of life when compared with controls.<br>
BPH is a chronically progressive disease that can lead to complications such as acute urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, bladder stones and renal dysfunction. The prevalence and average severity of LUTS associated with BPH in men increases with age.<br><br>
BPH leads to an increase in prostate volume, creating urethral and bladder outflow obstruction as well as secondary changes in bladder function. The effects of this are manifested by both storage (irritative) and voiding (obstructive) symptoms.<br>
Alpha-2-delta ligands have been described for a number of indications. The best known alpha-2-delta ligand, gabapentin (I), known as NeurontinÂ®, l-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexylacetic acid, was first described in the patent literature in the patent family comprising US4024175.<br>
(I) The compound is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain.<br>
A second alpha-2-delta ligand, pregabalin (II), (S)-(+)-4-amino-3-(2-methylpropyl)butanoic acid, is described in European patent application publication number EP641330 as an anti-convulsant treatment useful in the treatment of epilepsy and in EP0934Q61 for the treatment of pain.<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br>
More recently, International Patent Publication Number WO 02/085839, describes alpha-2-delta ligands of the following formulae, for use in the treatment of a number of indications, including pain:<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from H, straight or branched alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, cycloalkyi of from 3-6 carbon atoms, phenyl and benzyl, subject to the proviso that, except in the case of a tricyclooctane compound of formula (XVIII), R1 and R2 are not simultaneously hydrogen.<br>
Further examples of alpha-2-delta ligands are the compounds depicted below:<br>

Preferred alpha-2-delta ligands of the present invention include: gabapentin, pregabalin,<br>
[(1 R,5R,6S)-6-(Aminomethyl)bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-6-yl]acetic acid, 3-(1-Aminomethyl-<br>
cyclohexylmethy!)-4H-[1,2,4]oxadiazol-5-one, C-[1 -(1 H-Tetrazol-5-ylmethyl)-cycloheptyl]-<br>

Particularly preferred alpha-2-delta ligands of the present invention are selected from gabapentin, pregabalin and (1a,3a,5a)(3-amino-methyl-bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-3-yl)~acetic acid, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
WO 00/01135 describes the use of analogs of glutamic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid as being useful in treating incontinence.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that alpha-2-delta ligands, such as those described above, are useful in the treatment of LUTS, other than urinary incontinence, associated with OAB and/or BPH. More particularly, it has been found that alpha-2-delta ligands are useful in treating the frequency aspect of LUTS associated with OAB and/or BPH. This finding is surprising because it could not have been predicted that a compound known to be useful in the treatment of urinary incontinence (i.e. the unwanted and often unconscious leaking of urine due to problems with muscular control) would be able to reduce the frequency symptoms endured by sufferers of OAB and BPH.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is provided the use of an alpha-2-delta ligand, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for the treatment of LUTS, other than urinary incontinence, associated with OAB and/or BPH.<br>
Preferably the LUTS is frequency. Preferably, the LUTS is associated with BPH. Preferably, when the LUTS is associated with OAB, the OAB is OAB Dry.<br>
Preferably the alpha-2-delta-1-ligand is selected from:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from H, straight or branched alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of from 3-6 carbon atoms, phenyl and benzyl, subject to the proviso that, except in the case of a tricyclooctane compound of formula (XVIII), R1 and R2 are not simultaneously hydrogen; or it is selected from<br><br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable sait or solvate thereof.<br>
More preferably the alpha-2-delta ligand is gabapentin (I), pregabalin (II) or (1a,3a,5a)(3-amino-methyl-bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-3-yl)-acetic acid (III1) (Figure Remove)<br><br>
("I1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
The alpha-2-delta ligand, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, can be administered alone or in any convenient pharmaceutical presentation. Oral administration is preferred. In the present indication, a suitable dosage of the alpha-2-delta ligand, or of the active moiety in a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, is from about 5 to 50 mg/kg of body weight, and preferably about 0.1 to 200 mg/kg.<br>
The invention further provides a method of treating LUTS, other than urinary incontinence, associated with OAB and/or BPH comprising administering an alpha-2-delta ligand, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, to a patient in need of such treatment.<br>
Alpha-2-delta ligands, particularly the compounds described above, may be used in combination with other compounds. For example, they may be used in combination with a1-Adrenergic antagonists.<br>
Thus, a further aspect of the present invention is the use of a combination of an alpha-2-delta ligand and an ct1-Adrenergic antagonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of LUTS, associated with OAB and/or BPH.<br>
Still further there is provided a product containing an alpha-2-delta ligand and an a1-Adrenergic antagonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of LUTS associated with OAB and/or BPH.<br>
Preferably, the LUTS is other than urinary incontinence. More preferably, the LUTS is frequency. Preferably the LUTS is associated with BPH. Preferably, when the LUTS is associated with OAB, it is OAB dry.<br>

The contents of any of the patent applications, and in particular the general formulae of the therapeutically active compounds of the claims and exemplified compounds therein, are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference thereto.<br>
When treating BPH, alpha-2-delta ligands may be combined with a compound that attenuates the growth of the prostate gland. For example, a formulation is envisaged that combines an alpha-2-delta ligand with a human 5-a reductase inhibitory compound [see International Patent Application WO 95/28397].<br>
Thus, a further aspect of the present invention is the use of a combination of an alpha-2-delta ligand and a human 5- a reductase inhibitory compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of LUTS, other than urinary incontinence, associated with BPH.<br>
Still further there is provided a product containing an alpha-2-delta ligand and a human 5-a reductase inhibitory compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof,<br><br>
as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of LUTS, other than urinary incontinence, associated with BPH.<br>
Preferably the LUTS is'frequency.<br>
The contents of any of the published patent applications, and in particular the general formulae of the therapeutically active compounds of the claims and exemplified compounds therein, are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference thereto.<br>
The use of the compounds and combinations described herein may have the advantage that higher potency, longer duration of action, fewer side effects, improved selectivity, or other more useful properties are achieved compared to the uses of the prior art when treating LUTS associated with OAB and/or BPH, particularly when the LUTS is frequency.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, the patents, patent applications and publications, mentioned hereinabove, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, exemplify compounds which can be used in combinations, pharmaceutical compositions, methods and kits in accordance with the present inventions, and refer to methods of preparing those compounds.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds suitable for use in the invention include the acid addition and base salts thereof.<br>
Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the acetate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulphate/sulphate, borate, camsylate, citrate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tartrate, tosylate and trifluoroacetate salts.<br><br>
Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts.<br>
For a review on suitable salts, see "Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use" by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002).<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound suitable for use in the present invention may be readily prepared by mixing together solutions of the compound and the desired acid or base, as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.<br>
The compounds suitable for use in the present invention may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate' is used herein to Describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term 'hydrate' is employed when said solvent is water.<br>
Included within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein, in contrast to the aforementioned solvates, the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the drug containing two or more organic and/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or uon-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionised, partially ionised, or non-ionised. For a review of such complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288 by Haleblian (August 1975).<br>
Hereinafter all references to compounds suitable for use in the present invention include references to salts, solvates and complexes thereof and to solvates and complexes of salts thereof.<br>
The compounds suitable for use in the present invention include the compounds as hereinbefore defined, polymorphs, prodrugs, and isomers thereof (including optical,<br><br>
geometric and tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labelled compounds.<br>
As stated, the invention includes all polymorphs of the compounds suitable for use in the present invention as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention are so-called 'prodrugs' of the compounds suitable for use in the present invention. Thus certain derivatives of compounds suitable for use in the present invention which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as 'prodrugs'. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in 'Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and 'Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design', Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).<br>
Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds suitable for use in the present invention with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs" by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).<br>
Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include:<br>
(i) where the compound contains a carboxylic acid functionality<br>
(-COOH), an ester thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (CrC8)alkyl;<br>
(ii) where the compound contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), an ether thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (C1-C6)alkanoyloxymethyl; and<br>
(iii) where the compound contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (-NH2 or -NHR where R + H), an amide thereof, for example, replacement of one or both hydrogens with (CrC10)alkanoyl.<br>
Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.<br><br>
Finally, certain compounds suitable for use in the present invention may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
Compounds suitable for use in the present invention containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where the compound contains, for example, a keto or oxime group or an aromatic moiety, tautomeric isomerism ('tautomerism') can occur. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds suitable for use in the present invention as hereinbefore described, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counter-ion is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.<br>
The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds suitable for use in the present invention as hereinbefore described wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.<br>
Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 36CI, fluorine, such as 18F, iodine, such as 123I and 125I, nitrogen, such as 13N and 15N, oxygen, such as 150,17O and 18O, phosphorus, such as 32P, and sulphur, such as 35S.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, d6-acetone, de-DMSO.<br>
Compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products. They may be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention or in combination with one or more<br><br>
other drugs (or as any combination thereof). Generally, they will be administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The term "excipient" is used herein to describe any ingredient other than the compound(s) of the invention. The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for example, in 'Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences', 19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters tfle gastrointestinal tract, or buccal or sublingual administration may be employed by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration include solid formulations such as tablets, capsules containing particulates, liquids, or powders, lozenges (including liquid-filled), chews, multi- and nano-particulates, gels, solid solution, liposome, films (including muco-adhesive), ovules, sprays and liquid formulations.<br>
Liquid formulations include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules and typically comprise a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, jj. (6), 981-986 by Liang and Chen (2001).<br>
For tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 wt% to 80 wt% of the dosage form, more typically from 5 wt% to 60 wt% of the dosage form. In<br><br>
addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinised starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 wt% to 25 wt%, preferably from 5 wt% to 20 wt% of the dosage form.<br>
Binders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xyiitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.<br>
Tablets may also optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may comprise from 0.2 wt% to 5 wt% of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from 0.2 wt% to 1 wt% of the tablet.<br>
Tablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulphate. Lubricants generally comprise from 0.25 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably from 0.5 wt% to 3 wt% of the tablet.<br>
Other possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colourants, flavouring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.<br>
Exemplary tablets contain up to about 80% drug, from about 10 wt% to about 90 wt% binder, from about 0 wt% to about 85 wt% diluent, from about 2 wt% to about 10 wt% disintegrant, and from about 0.25 wt% to about 10 wt% lubricant.<br>
Tablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or<br><br>
extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated.<br>
The formulation of tablets is discussed in "Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Vol. 1", by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., N.Y., 1980 (ISBN 0-8247-6918-X).<br>
Solid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release'formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
Suitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in US Patent No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in Verma et al, Pharmaceutical Technology On-line, 25(2), 1-14 (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraur&amp;thral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.<br>
Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
The solubility of compounds of the present invention used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and PGLA microspheres.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, dermally or transdermally. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated - see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958 by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999).<br>
Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderjectâ¢, Biojectâ¢, etc.) injection.<br>
Formulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane.<br><br>
For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan orcyclodextrin.<br>
The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.<br>
Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.<br>
Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as /-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.<br>
A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 ug to 20mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1ul to 100ul. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of the invention, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Suitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.<br>
Formulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, poly(DL-lactic-coglycolic acid (PGLA).<br><br>
Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.<br>
Formulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.<br>
Formulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.<br>
Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may<br><br>
be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.<br>
Inasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for co-administration of the compositions.<br>
Thus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound as hereinbefore described in accordance with the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.<br>
The kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, references herein to "treatment" include references to curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment.<br>

Four caesarean derived (CD) rats weighing approximately 225 g were anaesthetised using urethane and continuous cystometry performed.<br><br>
The animals were anaesthetised using urethane (1.2 g/kg, i.p.)3. Depth of anaesthesia was assessed by the stability of blood pressure and heart rate, and by an absence of hind limb withdrawal in response to paw pinch. Supplementary doses of urethane (0.1 g kg-1, i.v.) were given where necessary.<br>
The trachea was intubated to maintain a patent airway, an external jugular vein was cannulated for drug administration, and a common carotid artery was cannulated with a heparinised cannula (20 units/ml heparin in 0.9% w/v saline) for the measurement of arterial blood pressure.<br>
Blood pressure was measured using a pressure transducer and the heart rate (HR) derived electronically on-line from the blood pressure using PoneMah (Linton Pty Ltd UK). Body temperature was monitored with a rectal temperature probe and maintained between 36 - 38Â°C using a homeothermic blanket system (Harvard, UK). Animals were allowed to breathe air spontaneously throughout the duration of the experiment.<br>
The urinary bladder was exposed by a midline abdominal incision. A cannula (c. 0.52 mm internal and 1.2 mm external diameter) was inserted into the bladder dome as a means of infusing the bladder while simultaneously recording intravesical bladder pressure. The bladder was infused with physiological saline (0.9%) at the rate of 0.046 ml/min, to simulate the maximal hourly diuresis rate of the rat (Klevmark B [1974] - Motility of the urinary bladder in cats during filling at physiological rates. I. Intravesical pressure patterns studied by a new method of cystometry. Acta Physiol Scand 90(3): 565-77). Following the surgical procedure the animals were allowed to stabilise for c. 30min. After the stabilisation period, cystometry was performed and bladder function (interval between micturition) in response to Gabapentin-HCI (0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg administered intravenously) was monitored.<br>
Statistical analysis<br>
Differences between treatment groups were examined using ANOVA.<br>
Compound<br>
Gabapentin-HCI (Tocris, UK) was dissolved in saline.<br><br>
2.0 Results:<br>
Time interval between voiding episodes<br>
The interval between voiding events was increased in response to gabapentin (see Fig 1) relative to corresponding control periods. It was observed from the study that gabapentin significantly extended the interval between voiding events in a dose dependent manner. Indeed, 10 mg/kg of gabapentin administered intravenously significantly prolonged the micturition interval relative to corresponding control animals (3.1 Â± 0.29 y 9.89 Â± 2.72 min P
Thus it is demonstrated that administration of an alpha-2-delta ligand increases bladder capacity and reduces the LUTS in female animals, indicating the utility of such an approach in treating the LUTS associated with OAB.<br>
Example 2: Effect of an alpha-2-delta ligand on micturition frequency and bladder pressure in the male spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR).<br>
1.0 Materials and Methods:<br>
Eight (8) male spontaneously hypertensive rats were prepared surgically with Data Sciences International (DSI) telemetry transponders (TL11M2-C50-PXT). Bladder pressure was continuously monitored with the aid of a pressure catheter placed via the dome of the bladder.<br>
Bladder parameters (bladder pressure, voiding pressure and the number of voids) were recorded in response to placebo or treatment with 60 mg/kg Gabapentin administered subcutaneously (s/c).<br><br>
2.0 Results:<br>
As depicted in Figure 2, Gabapentin at 60 mg/kg s/c significantly decreased (PO.05) micturition interval and hence increased bladder capacity. Moreover, and importantly for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), average bladder pressure during the filling stages of the micturition cycle were significantly decreased (P
Thus it is demonstrated that administration of an alpha-2-delta ligand increases bladder capacity and reduces the LUTS in male animals, indicating the utility of such an approach in treating the LUTS associated with BPH.<br><br>
