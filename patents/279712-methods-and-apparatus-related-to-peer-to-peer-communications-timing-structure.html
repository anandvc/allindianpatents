				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS RELATED TO PEER TO PEER COMMUNICATIONS TIMING STRUCTURE<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001]    Various embodiments are directed to methods and apparatus for wireless communication, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for use in peer to peer wireless communication.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]     Wireless communications devices are common place. Many cellular systems use centralized controllers and/or other network based control mechanisms to control wireless device operation so that cellular devices operate in an efficient and relatively synchronized manner. Unfortunately, in peer to peer systems such centralized control and/or network based synchronization mechanisms are normally lacking.<br>
[0003]     In the case of peer to peer systems, it would be desirable if a certain level of device synchronization and/or predictability could be achieved so that peer devices can anticipate the time at which particular activities may be performed by other peer devices allowing the peer devices to operate in a structured and/or loosely synchronized manner with regard to particular activities. It would be desirable is such structured activity and/or loose synchronization could be achieved without the need for a centralized control device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0043]     Figure 1 is drawing of an exemplary recurring peer to peer communications system timing structure 100 in accordance with various embodiments. The exemplary timing structure 100 includes a plurality of different types of slots including a peer discovery slot type, a timing synchronization slot type, a paging slot type, and a traffic slot type. In some embodiments, a timing synchronization slot is included as part of a peer discovery slot. In some other embodiments, a timing synchronization slot is non-overlapping with a timing sjmchronization slot, e.g., a timing synchronization slot follows a peer discovery slot.<br>
[0044]     A first iteration of the exemplary recurring peer to peer communications system timing structure 100, which starts at time mark reference 102, has a timing structure repeat interval 122, includes peer discovery slot 104, timing synchronization slot 106, paging slot 108, traffic slot 110, traffic slot 112, paging slot 114 and traffic slot 116. A second iteration of the exemplary recurring peer to peer communication system timing structure has the same set of slot types in the same order. The second iteration of the exemplary recurring peer to peer communication system timing structure starts at time mark reference 102' and includes peer discovery slot 118 and timing synchronization slot 120.<br>
[0045]     The duration of the timing structure repeat interval 122 is much larger than the duration of any individual slot. The duration of the timing structure repeat time interval is, e.g., 1 minute in duration. The duration of the peer discovery time interval 124 is, e.g., 2 or 3 milli-seconds in duration. The duration of the time between successive paging slots 126 is, e.g., 1 sec in duration. In various embodiments with regard to one iteration of the timing structure, the number of peer discovery slots is less than the number of paging slots, and the number of paging slots is less than or equal to the number of traffic slots. In some embodiments, there is only one peer discovery slot per iteration of the recurring timing structure. In various embodiments with regard to one iteration of the timing structure, the amount of time allocated to traffic slots is greater than the combined amount of time allocated to peer discovery and paging slots. In some such embodiments, the amount of time allocated to traffic is much larger than the combined amount of time allocated to peer discovery and paging slots, e.g., at least 5 times larger.<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
[0046]    Figure 2 is a flowchart 200 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal as part of a peer to peer communications system in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 202, where the wireless terminal is powered on and initialized and proceeds to step 204. In step 204, the wireless terminal checks for bandwidth availability. Then, in step 206 the wireless termmal derives a timing reference and in step 208, the wireless terminal derives the timing structure. Operation proceeds from step 208 to steps 210,212 and 214, where the wireless terminal checks, on an ongoing basis, for different types of predetermined slots being used in the peer to peer communication system recurring timing structure, e.g., a timing structure such as timing structure 100 illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
[0047]     In step 210, the wireless terminal checks if it is time to perform peer discovery, and if it is, then operation proceeds from step 210 to step 216. In step 212, the wireless terminal checks if it is time allocated to perform paging operations, and if it is, then operation proceeds from step 212 to step 224. In step 214, the wireless terminal checks if it is time allocated to perform traffic operations, and if it is, then operation proceeds from step 214 to step 238.<br>
[0048]     In step 216, the wireless terminal performs peer discovery operations. Step 216 includes sub-steps 218,220 and 222. In sub-step 218, the wireless terminal monitors to detect beacon signals from other peer nodes in the vicinity, and then in sub-step 220 the wireless terminal identifies wdreless terminal and/or users associated with the received beacon signals. Operation proceeds from sub-step 220 to sub-step 222. In sub-step 222, the wireless terminal updates a local vicinity peer node present list as a ftmction of determined wireless terminal and/or user identification information. In various embodiments, in at least some iterations of step 216, the wireless terminal, in addition to or in place of sub-steps in step 216, transmits a beacon signal to announce its presence to other wireless terminals in the vicinity.<br>
[0049]    In step 224, the wireless terminal performs paging related operations. Step 224 includes sub-steps 226,228, 230,232,234 and 236. Different sub-steps may be, and sometimes are, performed at different times, e.g., in response to wireless terminal needs and/or interests and/or as a function of attributes of a particular paging slot, e.g., information identifying wireless terminals which can be paged in that particular slot. In sub-step 226, the wireless terminal checks for incoming pages.<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
8<br>
Operation proceeds from step 226 to step 228, where the wireless terminal checks the detected incoming pages and determines if the wireless terminal is being paged. If the wireless terminal determines that it is being paged, then operation proceeds from sub-step 228 to sub-step 236. In sub-step 230, the wireless terminal generates a page, and then in sub-step 232 the wireless terminal transmits the page. Operation proceeds from sub-step 232 to sub-step 234, in which the wireless terminal monitors for a page response. If a page response is detected by the wireless terminal, then operation proceeds from sub-step 234 to sub-step 236. In sub-step 236, the wireless terminal sets up an active connection. The active connection set-up includes, e.g., the communication of a connection identifier.<br>
[0050]    Returning to step 238, in step 238, the wireless terminal determines if there is an active connection, and if there is then operation proceeds to step 240, where the wireless terminal performs traffic operations. If there is not a current active connection, then the wireless terminal, in some embodiments, performs no further action with regard to the traffic slot, e.g., the wireless terminal goes into a power saving mode with regard to traffic slot. Step 240 includes sub-steps 242,244 246 and 248. In sub-step 242, the wireless terminal follows traffic protocol rules to receive and/or send traffic related signals including user data signals. In sub-step 244, the wireless terminal performs timer management operations and in sub-step 246, the wireless terminal decides whether or not there is additional traffic to be communicated. If the wireless terminal determines in sub-step 246 that there is no additional traffic, then operation proceeds to sub-step 248 where the wireless terminal implements the tear down of the active connection. If there is still additional traffic to be communicated the active connection is left intact, e.g., and additional traffic can be communicated during a subsequent traffic slot.<br>
[0051]    Figure 3 is a flowchart 300 of an exemplary method of operating a first communications device, e.g., a mobile node using OFDM signaling and supporting peer to peer communications, in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 302, where the first communications device is powered on and initialized and proceeds to step 304, where the first communications device determines a time reference point. Operation proceeds from step 304 to step 306, in which the first communications device accesses stored timing structure information used to determine<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
recurring peer discovery time intervals and traffic intervals. In various embodiments, the accessed stored timing information further includes information used to determine recurring paging intervals. In various embodiments, the stored timing structure information indicates that multiple paging time intervals occur between peer discovery time intervals during at least one period of time for which timing structure information is stored. In some embodiments, the traffic intervals occupy more time than the time occupied by the combination of paging time intervals and peer discovery time intervals during one iteration of a communications timing structure defined by said stored timing structure information. Operation proceeds fi-om step 306 to step 308. In step 308, the first wireless communication device performs a peer to peer timing synchronization operation during a peer discovery time interval. In some other embodiments, the first wireless terminal performs peer to peer timing synchronization operation during a timing/synchronization time interval following a peer discovery time interval. Operation proceeds fi-om step 308 to step 310. In step 310, the first wireless communications device performs paging operations during paging intervals determined to occur at points in time relative to said time reference point.<br>
[0052]    Figure 4 is a flowchart 400 of an exemplary method of operating a first wireless communications device, e.g., a wireless terminal such as a mobile node supporting peer to peer operations and using OFDM signaling, in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 402, where the first wireless communications device is powered on and initialized and proceeds to step 404. In step 404, the first wireless communications device determines a time reference point. Step 404 includes sub-steps 406 and 408. In sub-step 406, the first wireless communications device receives a broadcast signal from a device, said device being different firom the first wireless communications device, said device being one of: i) a satellite, ii) a base station in a cellular network, and iii) a beacon transmitter that doesn't transmit user data. In some other embodiments, the received broadcast signal is from one of: i) a broadcast transmitter broadcasting a government or international body defined reference signal and ii) a broadcast transmitter transmitting a commercial broadcast signal such as a reference signal used in television and/or radio signals. Operation proceeds from sub-step 406 to sub-step 408. In sub-step 408, the first wireless communications device uses<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
10<br>
the received broadcast signal to determine the time reference point. Operation proceeds from step 404 to step 410.<br>
[0053]    In step 410, the first communications device accesses stored timing structure information used to determine recurring peer discovery time intervals and traffic intervals. In various embodiments, the accessed stored timing structure information also indicates where recurring timing synchronization intervals occur relative to the determined time reference point. Operation proceeds from step 410 to step 412. In step 412, the first wireless communications device determines at least one of peer to peer receive symbol timing and peer to peer transmit symbol timing based on said timing reference point. Then, in step 414, the first wireless commxmications device detects a signal transmitted by a second wireless communications device, e.g., another mobile node. The detected signal is, e.g., a traffic signal used to communicate user data. Alternatively, the detected signal is, e.g., a predetermined broadcast signal. The predetermined broadcast signal is, in some embodiments, one of: (i) a multi-tone time varying signal and (ii) a predetermined time varying PN sequence signal.  In some embodiments, the predetermined broadcast signal is a signal received from the second wireless communications device in one of a plurality of recurring timing synchronization intervals.   Operation proceeds from step 414 to step 416. In step 416, the wireless terminal adjusts at least one of peer to peer receive symbol timing and peer to peer transmit symbol timing as a function of the detected signal from step 414. Operation proceeds from step 416 to step 418. In step 418, the wireless terminal transmits a predetermined broadcast signal in a time interval having a predetermined offset from said reference point. In some embodiments, the broadcast signal is a beacon signal annunciating the first wireless communication device's presence and is transmitted in a peer discovery interval.<br>
[0054]    Figure 5 comprising the combination of Figure 5 A, Figure 5B, Figure 5C and Figure 5D is a flowchart 500 of an exemplary method of operating a first wireless communications device, e.g., a wireless terminal such as a mobile node supporting peer to peer communications and using OFDM signaling, in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 502, where the first wireless communications device is powered on and mitialized and proceeds to step 504. In step 504, the first wireless communications device determines a time reference point, and then in step 506<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
11<br>
the first wireless communications device accesses stored timing structure information used to determine recurring peer discovery time intervals and traffic intervals. In various embodiments, the accessed stored timing structure information also includes information used to determine recurring paging time intervals. Operation proceeds from step 506 to step 508, in which the first wkeless communications device determines recurring peer discovery time intervals and traffic intervals using said accessed stored timing structure information. Operation proceeds from step 508 to step 510. In step 510, the first wireless communications device determines recurring paging intervals using said accessed stored timing structure information. Operation proceeds from step 510 to step 512.<br>
[0055]     In step 512, the first wireless communications device receives a broadcast signal from a second wireless communications device during a peer discovery time interval. In various embodiments, the second wireless communications device is another wireless terminal such a mobile node supporting peer to peer communications and using OFDM signaling. In some embodiments, the received broadcast signal is a user beacon signal. Then, in step 514, the first wireless communications device recovers an identifier from the received broadcast signal, said identifier being one of a device identifier and a user identifier, and in step 516, the first wireless communications device stores said recovered identifier in memory. Operation proceeds from step 516 to steps 518, 520 and, via connecting node A 522 to step 564.<br>
[0056]     In step 518, the first wireless communications device starts a timer used to determine when a predetermined period of time, e.g., a lifetime associated with said recovered identifier of step 514, has expired. Operation proceeds from step 518 to step 524. In step 524, the first wdreless communications device determines if a signal from said second wireless communications device has been detected within a period of time. If a signal is detected before the timer expires, then operation proceeds from step 524 to step 528, where the first wireless communications device updates the timer, e.g., restarts the timer. If a signal is not detected and the timer expires, then operation proceeds from step 524 to step 526, where the first wireless communications device deletes said recovered identifier, which was stored in step 516, from memory.<br>
[0057]    Returning to step 520, in step 520, the first wireless communications device monitors to detect an event used to trigger sending of a paging message to the<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>

The traffic control and traffic portions alternate in time in traffic interval air link resources 1706'.<br>
[0098]    Exemplary traffic interval air link resources 1706" represent another alternative embodiment.

[0099]    Figure 18 includes exemplary peer to peer timing structure 1600 and an exemplary flowchart 1800 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal, e.g., a mobile node supporting peer to peer operations, in accordance with various embodiments. Operation of the exemplary method starts in step 1802, where the wireless terminal is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 1802 to step 1804. In step 1804, which is performed during peer discovery interval 1602, the wireless terminal transmits a signal, e.g., a beacon signal to signal its presence. Operation proceeds from step 1804 to step 1806, which is also performed during peer discovery interval 1602, the wireless terminal monitors to detect for peers, e.g., the wireless terminal monitors to detect for beacon signals associated with peers. In some embodiments, step 1806 includes at times multiple disjoint monitoring portions with the transmit of step 1804 being performed between two of those disjoint monitoring portions. In some embodiments, the wireless terminal performs one of step 1804 and step 1806 during a peer discovery interval iteration.<br>
[00100]     Operation proceeds from step 1806 to step 1808. In step 1808, the wireless terminal updates a list of peers in the vicinity as a ftmction of information obtained from the monitoring of step 1806. Operation proceeds from step 1808 to steps 1810 and step 1816.<br>
[00101]    In step 1810, which is performed during paging interval 1604, the wireless terminal monitors for pages from the peers on the list of step 1808. Then, in step 1812, the wireless terminal processes received paging messages and identifies peers on the list directing a page to the wireless terminal. Operation proceeds from step 1812 to step 1814 if a page has been detected which was directed to the wireless terminal; otherwise operation proceeds to steps 1822 and 1828. In step 1814, the wireless terminal determines a connection identifier for the pair of the wireless terminal and the peer which was directing the page to the wireless terminal. Operation proceeds from step 1814 to steps 1822 and 1828.<br>
[00102]    Returning to step 1816, step 1816 is performed for a peer on the list of step 1808, which the wireless terminal wants to send a page. In step 1816, the wireless terminal generates a page message to a peer on the list. Operation proceeds from step 1816 to step 1818. In step 1818, which is performed during paging interval 1604, the wireless terminal transmits the generated page message of step 1816. Then, in step<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
25<br>
1820, the wireless terminal determines a connection identifier for the pair of the wireless terminal and peer to which the generated page is directed. Operation proceeds from step 1820 to steps 1822 and 1828.<br>
[00103]    In step 1822, the wireless terminal monitors traffic control resources associated with the determined connection identifier or determined connection identifiers for a traffic request. If a request is received, operation proceeds from step 1822 to step 1824, where the wireless terminal responds to the peer request, e.g., granting the request. Operation proceeds from step 1824 to step 1826, in response to a grant decision. In step 1826, the wireless terminal receives traffic user data from the peer node which sent the request using a traffic data resource.<br>
[00104]    Returning to step 1828, step 1828 is performed if the wireless terminal wants to communicate user data to peer with which the wireless terminal has a connection. In step 1828, the wireless terminal transmits, using a traffic control resource associated with the determined connection identifier a traffic request. Operation proceeds from step 1828 to step 1830. In step 1830, the wireless terminal receives a response to the request, e.g., a grant from the peer. Operation proceeds from step 1830 to step 1832, in response to a received grant. In step 1832, the wireless terminal transmits traffic user data to the peer node, from which it has sent a request, using a traffic data resource. Steps 1822,1824,1826,1828,1830, and 1832 are performed during traffic interval 1606.<br>
[00105]    Figure 19 is a drawing 1900 illustrating the refinement of monitoring, by a wireless terminal, as a function of peer discovery operations and paging operations in accordance with various embodiments. Block 1902 illustrates that there are N wireless terminals in a peer to peer communications system, e.g., N wireless terminals which can potentially power on and be in the same local vicinity and are implemented to support peer to peer communications in accordance with the peer to peer communications system protocols. The N wireless terminals, in some embodiments, represent the total number of wireless terminals which have registered and are provisioned to be able to participate in the peer to peer communications networks of a service provider.<br>
[00106]    In block 1904, WT 1 peer discovery operations identify peers in its local vicinity and result in a list of Nl peers in vicinity, where Nl 
 <br>
070701U3<br>
26<br>
In block 1906, WT 1 paging operations identify K active connection peers and this results in a list of connection identifiers, where K 
[00107]    Figure 20 a is drawing illustrating an example corresponding to Figure 19 and further illustrating that the wireless terminal determines a portion or portions of the traffic control resources to use as a function of a connection identifier list. In this example, assume that there are 500 exemplary wireless terminals in the peer to peer communications system, e.g., N = 500. As part of wireless terminal I's peer discovery operations WT 1 forms peer discovery list 2002, which identifies that 8 peer wireless terminals (WTs corresponding to identifiers 3, 7,23,156,196,200,456 and 499) are in the local vicinity. In this example Nl = 8.<br>
[00108]    As part of WT I's paging operations, WT 1 forms active connection list 2004. Active connection list 2004 includes a first column 2006 which identifies wireless terminals from which WT 1 has received a page and wireless terminals to which WT 1 has sent a page. In this example, the number of K active connection peers = 2, which are the wireless terminals corresponding to identifiers 7 and 499.  Active connection list 2004 also includes a second column 2008 listing active connection identifiers. Active connection identifiers include an identifier corresponding to the pair of WT 1/ WT 7 and an identifier corresponding to the pair of WT 1 and WT 499.<br>
[00109]     Drawing 2010 includes a plot of frequency on the vertical axis 2012 vs time on the horizontal axis 2014 and is used to illustrate exemplary OFDM traffic control resources 2016. Arrow 2018 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/7 pair identifier maps to resource 2020. Arrow 2022 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/499 pair maps to the resource 2024. Each air link resource unit represented by a small square box, e.g., air link resource 2020 is, e.g., a set of OFDM tone-symbols, where one OFDM tone-symbol is one OFDM tone for the duration of one OFDM symbol transmission time period. In various embodiments, WT 1 selectively monitors traffic control air link resources as a function of an active connection list. For example, consider that the air link resource units of traffic control resources 2016 are used for requests for traffic; however, in this embodiment at this time, WT 1 need only monitor resource units 2020 and 2024 to detect for a peer requesting to send traffic to WT 1. This narrowing down of the traffic control resources to monitor and process is<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
27<br>
advantageous in that it can reduce the amounts of false alarms and improper response signaling.<br>
[00110]    Figure 21 is an alternative to Figure 20 for an exemplary embodiment using CDMA signaling. Exemplary WT 1 peer discovery list 2002 and exemplary WT 1 active connection list 2004, have already been described with respect to Figure 20. Drawing 2110 includes a plot of frequency on the vertical axis 2112 vs time on the horizontal axis 2114 and is used to illustrate exemplary CDMA traffic control resources 2116. In this example, resources 2116 correspond to 64 different PN codes. Arrow 2118 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/7 pair maps to PN code A. Arrow 2120 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/499 pair maps to PN code D. In this example, WT 1 need only monitor for two (PN code A and PN code D) of the 64 different PN codes in the air link resource 2116.<br>
[00111]    Figure 22 is a variation on the exemplary embodiment of Figure 20 illustrating an embodiment in which the position of the OFDM air link traffic control resources associated with an active connection pair remains fixed for multiple traffic control portions. The multiple traffic control portions, in some embodiments, are included in the same traffic interval. In some embodiments, the multiple control portions are included in different, e.g., successive traffic control intervals during which the active connection remains intact. Active table connection list 2004 has already been described with respect to Figure 20.<br>
[00112]    Drawing 2200 includes a plot of frequency on the vertical axis 2202 vs time on the horizontal axis 2204 and is used to illustrate exemplary OFDM traffic control resources (OFDM traffic control resource 1 2206, OFDM traffic control resource 2 2216). Arrow 2208 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/7 pair maps to resource unit 2210 in traffic control resource 1 2206, while arrow 2218 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/7 pair maps to resource unit 2220 in traffic control resource 2 2216. Arrow 2212 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/499 pair maps to resource unit 2214 in traffic control resource 1 2206, while arrow 2222 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/499 pair maps to resource unit 2224 in traffic control resource 2 2216.<br>
[00113]    It may be observed that air link resource unit 2210 and air link resource unit 2220 occupy the same relative position in traffic control resource 1 2206 and traffic<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
28<br>
control resource 2 2216, respectively. Similarly, air link resource unit 2214 and air link resource unit 2224 occupy the same relative position in traffic control resource 1 2206 and traffic control resource 2 2216, respectively.<br>
[00114]    Figure 23 is a variation on the exemplary embodiment of Figure 20 illustrating an embodiment in which the position of the OFDM air link traffic control resources associated with an active connection pair varies between multiple traffic control portions. The multiple traffic control portions, in some embodiments, are included in the same traffic interval. In some embodiments, the multiple control portions are included in different, e.g., successive traffic control intervals during which the active connection remains intact. Active table connection list 2004 has already been described with respect to Figure 20.<br>
[00115]    Drawing 2300 includes a plot of frequency on the vertical axis 2302 vs time on the horizontal axis 2304 and is used to illustrate exemplary OFDM traffic control resources (OFDM traffic control resource 1 2306, OFDM traffic control resource 2 2316). Arrow 2308 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/7 pair maps to resource unit 2310 in traffic control resource 1 2306, while arrow 2318 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/7 pair maps to resource unit 2320 in traffic control resource 2 2316. Arrow 2312 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/499 pair maps to resource unit 2314 in traffic control resource 1 2306, while arrow 2322 indicates that the identifier for the WT 1/499 pair maps to resource unit 2324 in traffic control resource 2 2316.<br>
[00116]    It may be observed that air link resource unit 2310 and air link resource unit 2320 occupy different relative positions in traffic control resource 1 2306 and traffic control resource 2 2316, respectively. Similarly, air link resource unit 2314 and air link resource unit 2324 occupy different relative positions in traffic control resource 1 2306 and traffic control resource 2 2316, respectively.<br>
[00117]    Although resource units corresponding to an active connection pair, e.g., resource unit 2210, in Figures 22 and Figure 23 are shown as contiguous units in terms of time and frequency, in some embodiments, a resource unit such as resource unit 2210 comprises a plurality of components of which some may be, and sometimes are, disjoint, e.g., a set of OFDM tone-symbols which may be dispersed.<br>

[00118]     In some embodiments, the active connection identijBer is an expressly defined value, e.g., associated with particular units in the traffic control resources. In some embodiments, the active connection identifier is implicitly conveyed, e.g., identification information maps to particular imits of the air link resource. In some embodiments, the active connection identifier is fixed for particular wireless terminal identifiers, irrespective of time information. In other embodiments, the active connection identifier can vary for the same pair of wireless terminals, e.g., the active connection identifier is derived from information known to both peers, e.g., a common time reference, a value communicated in the paging, etc.<br>
[00119]    Figure 24 is a flowchart 2400 of an exemplary method of operating a first communications device in accordance with various embodiments. For example, the first communications device is a wireless terminal such as a mobile node supporting peer to peer communications using OFDM signaling. As another example, the first communications device is a wireless terminal such as a mobile node supporting peer to peer communications using CDMA signaling.<br>
[00120]     Operation starts in step 2402, where the first communications device is powered on and initialized and proceeds to step 2404. In step 2404, the first communications device, during a paging interval preceding a traffic interval, performs operations. Step 2404 includes sub-step 2406, and at times includes sub-step 2408. In sub-step 2406, the first communications device monitors for paging signals. In sub-step 2408, the first communications device transmits a page to a second communications device having a second cormection identifier. Operation proceeds fi-om step 2404 to step 2410.<br>
[00121]    In step 2410, the first communications device maintains a list of active connection identifiers corresponding to communications devices with which said first commimications device has received or sent at least one paging signal. Step 2410 includes sub-steps 2412, 2414,2416,2418,2420 2422 and 2424. In sub-step 2412, the first communications device checks if a paging message or messages to the first communications device were received. If it is determined in sub-step 2412, that a page directed to the first communications device was received, then operation proceeds fi-om sub-step 2412 to sub-step 2418; otherwise step 2418 is bypassed and operation proceeds to connecting node A 2426. In sub-step 2418, the first wireless communications device<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
30<br>
updates said list of active connection identifiers so that the list includes connection identifiers corresponding to wdreless communications devices from which a paging message directed to the first wireless communications device was received.<br>
[00122]    In sub-step 2414, the first communications device determines if a page was transmitted by the first communications device, and if a page was transmitted then operation proceeds from sub-step 2414 to sub-step 2420; otherwise step 2420 is bypassed and operation proceeds to cormecting node A 2426. In sub-step 2420, the first communications device updates said list of active connection identifiers to include said second connection identifier.<br>
[00123]     In sub-step 2416, the first communications device determines if an active connection is no longer valid. In some embodiments, determining if an active connection identifier is no longer valid includes processing a connection termination signal corresponding to the communications device to which said active connection identifier also corresponds. In some embodiments, determining if an active connection identifier is no longer valid includes detecting expiration of a timeout trigger, said timeout trigger being a fimction of signals sent to the communication device corresponding to said active connection identifier or received from said communications device corresponding to said active cormection identifier. Operation proceeds from step 2416 to step 2422. In step 2422, the first communications device checks if the determination of step 2416 indicates that an active connection is no longer valid, and if the connection is no longer valid, operation proceeds from step 2422 to step 2424; otherwise step 2422 is bypassed and operation proceeds to connecting node A 2426. In step 2424, the first communications device removes the active connection identifier determined to be no longer valid from said list of active connection identifiers. Operation proceeds from step 2410 via connecting node A 2426 to steps 2428 and 2430.<br>
[00124]    In step 2428, the first communications device determines a portion of a traffic control resource to be monitored as a fimction of connection identifiers included in said list of active connection identifiers. In some embodiments, determining the portion of the traffic control resource to be monitored is also a fimction of a time index of said traffic interval.<br>
[00125]     Operation proceeds from step 2428 to step 2432. In step 2432, the first commimications device monitors a traffic control resource during a traffic interval for a<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
31<br>
traffic request signal corresponding to at least one connection identifier included in said list of active connection identifiers. In various embodiments, the traffic control resource includes a plurality of resource unit subsets, and monitoring a traffic control resource includes monitoring less than the fiill set of resource unit subsets. In some embodiments, monitoring a traffic control resource includes monitoring to detect the presence of a predetermined waveform on said traffic control resource. In some embodiments, the predetermined waveform is an OFDM waveform. In some embodiments, the predetermined waveform is a PN sequence waveform. In various embodiments, the predetermined waveform is a ftmction of at least one connection identifier included in said list of active connection identifiers.<br>
[00126]     Operation proceeds from step 2432 to step 2434. In step 2434, the first communications device determines whether or not a traffic request signal was received. If a traffic request signal was received operation proceeds from step 2434 to step 2436; otherwise step 2436 is bypassed and operation proceeds to connecting node B 2442. In step 2436, the first communications device receives data in a traffic data resource from a communications device having the active connection identifier corresponding to a received traffic request signal.<br>
[00127]    Returning to step 2430, in step 2430 the first communications device determines if there is data to be communicated, e.g., transmitted, to the second communications device. If there is data to be communicated to the second communications device, then operation proceeds from step 2430 to step 2438; otherwise steps 2438 and 2440 are bypassed and operation proceeds to connecting node B 2442. In step 2438, the first communications device transmits a traffic request to the second communications device following transmission of said page to the second communications device. Operation proceeds from step 2438 to step 2440, in which the first communications device transmits traffic data to the second communications device using a traffic data resource.<br>
[00128] Operation proceeds from step 2436 and step 2440 to connecting node B 2442. From connecting node B 2442 operation returns to step 2404, where operations are performed during another paging interval.<br>
[00129]    Figure 25 is a flowchart 2500 of an exemplary method of operating a first communications device to support communications with multiple peer wireless<br>
 <br>

32<br>
communications devices including a second commumcations device and a third communications device in accordance with various embodiments. The exemplary first, second, and third communications devices are, e.g., wireless terminals such as mobile nodes supporting peer to peer communications. In some embodiments, the communications devices use OFDM signaling for peer to peer communications. In some embodiments, the communications devices use CDMA signaling for peer to peer communications.<br>
[00130]    The exemplary method starts in step 2502, where the fu-st communications device is powered on and initialized and proceeds from start step 2502 to step 2504. In step 2504, the first commimications device performs a transmit timing synchronization operation based on a reference signal received from a fourth device to determine transmission symbol timing. In some embodiments, the fourth device is one of: a base station, a beacon signal transmitter which does not transmit user data, and a satellite. In various embodiments, the transmit timing is not adjusted based on signals received from said second and third communications devices.<br>
[00131]    Operation proceeds from step 2504 to step 2506. In step 2506, the first communications device receives a signal from a second communications device. In some embodiments, the received signal from the second commimications device is one of a traffic signal sent from the second communications device to the first communications device and a traffic signal sent from the second communications device to another communications device. In some embodiments, the received signal from the second communications device is a wideband timing synchronization signal including at least some predetermined kno\yn modulation symbols and at least some intentional nulls.<br>
[00132]    Operation proceeds from step 2506 to step 2508. In step 2508, the first communications device generates first receive timing adjustment information from said received signal from the second communications device, said receive timing adjustment information for adjusting receive symbol timing relative to said determined transmission symbol timing when communicating with the second communications device. Then, in step 2510, the first communications device stores said first receive timing adjustment information. Operation proceeds from step 2510 to step 2512.<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
33<br>
[00133]    In step 2512, the first communications device receives a signal from a third communications device. In some embodiments, the received signal from the third communications device is one of a traffic signal sent from the third communications device to the first communications device and a traffic signal sent from the third communications device to another communications device. In some embodiments, the received signal from the third communications device is a wideband timing synchronization signal including at least some predetermined known modulation symbols and at least some intentional nulls.<br>
[00134]    Operation proceeds from step 2512 to step 2514. In step 2514, the first communications device generates second receive timing adjustment information from said received signal from the third communications device, said receive timing adjustment information for adjusting receive symbol timing relative to said determined transmission symbol timing when communicating with the third communications device. Then, in step 2516, the first communications device stores said second receive timing adjustment information. Operation proceeds from step 2516 to step 2518. In step 2518, the first communications device transmits to the second and third communications devices using said determined transmission symbol timing. Operation proceeds from step 2518 to step 2520.<br>
[00135]    In step 2520, the first communications device receives and processes an additional signal from one of said first and second communications devices. Step 2520 includes sub-steps 2522,2524,2526,2528, and 2530. In sub-step 2522, the first communications device determines if the additional signal is from the second or third communications device. If the additional signal is from the second communications device, then operation proceeds to sub-step 2524; however, if the additional signal is from the third communications device then operation proceeds to step 2528. In step 2524, the first communications device retrieves stored first receive timing adjustment information. Operation proceeds from sub-step 2524 to sub-step 2526. In sub-step 2526, the first communications device uses said retrieved first receive timing adjustment information in receiving and/or processing the additional signal.<br>
[00136]    Returning to step 2528, in step 2528, the first communications device retrieves stored second receive timing adjustment information. Operation proceeds from sub-step 2528 to sub-step 2530. In sub-step 2530, the first commimications device<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
34<br>
uses said retrieved second receive timing adjustment information in receiving and/or processing the additional signal.<br>
[00137]     Figure 26 is a drawing of an exemplary wireless communications system 2600 supporting peer to peer communications in accordance with various embodiments. Exemplary wireless communications system 2600 includes a plurality of mobile nodes (MN 1 2602, MN 2 2604, MN 3 2606) which may, and sometimes do, communicate with one other using peer to peer communication signaling connections. Exemplary system 2600 also includes a fourth node 2608, e.g., a fixed location beacon transmitter. Fourth communications device 2608 transmits a reference signal 2610 which is used by the mobile nodes to achieve a coarse level of synchronization and in performing a transmission time synchronization operation. A mobile node, e.g., MN 1 2602, implements the methods of flowchart 2500 of Figure 25. Arrow 2616 indicates that MN 1 2602 and MN 2 2604 have a peer to peer communications connection; arrow 2614 indicates that MN 1 2602 and MN 3 2606 have a peer to peer communications connection.<br>
[00138]    MN 1 2602 includes a receiver, a transmitter, a processor, and memory 2618 which are coupled together and interchange data and information. Memory 2618 includes routines and data/information. The processor, e.g., a CPU, executes the routines and uses the data/information in memory 2618 to control the operation of MN 1 2602 and implement methods. Memory 2618 includes a transmit timing synchronization module 2620, a receive timing adjustment determination module 2622, and a receive and processing module 2626. The receive and processing module 2626 includes a selection module 2628. Memory 2618 also includes stored first receive timing adjustment information 2630 corresponding to MN 2 and stored second receive timing adjustment information 2632 corresponding to MN 3. In this example, the magnitude of the stored second receive timing adjustment information 2632 is larger, at this time, than the magnitude of the stored first receive timing adjustment information, e.g., as a fimction of the positions of the MNs.<br>
[00139]    Transmit timing synchronization module 2620 performs a transmit time synchronization operation based on the reference signal 2610 received firom the fourth node 2608 to determine transmission symbol timing to be used by MN 1. Receive timing adjustment determination module 2622 determines receive timing information to<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>

be used by MN 1 corresponding to different peer MNs. Stored first receive timing adjustment information 2630 corresponding to MN 2 2604 and stored second receive timing adjustment information 2632 corresponding to MN 3 2606 are outputs of module 2622. Receive and processing module 2626 receives and processes peer to peer communications signals from other MNs, e.g., MN 2 and MN 3. As part of the receiving and processing operations stored timing adjustment information is retrieved and used by module 2626. Selection module 2628 selects the appropriate stored timing adjustment information to use, e.g., one of information 2630 and information 2632, to match the source of the signal.<br>
[00140]    Figure 27 is a drawing of an exemplary communications device 2700, e.g., mobile node supporting peer to peer communications in accordance with various embodiments. Exemplary communications device 2700 includes a wireless receiver module 2702, a wireless transmitter module 2704, a processor 2706, user I/O devices 2708, a clock module 2709, and memory 2710 coupled together via a bus 2712 over which the various elements may interchange data and information. Memory 2710 includes routines 2714 and data/information 2716. The processor 2706, e.g., a CPU, executes the routines 2714 and uses the data/information 2716 in memory 2710 to control the operation of the communications device 2700 and implement methods, e.g., the method of flowchart 300 of Figure 3.<br>
[00141]     Wireless receiver module 2702, e.g., an OFDM receiver, is coupled to receive antenna 2703 via which the communications device 2700 receives signals.

[00146]     Timing reference point determination module 2718 determines a time reference point. For example, the peer to peer communications network, in some embodiments, follows a recurring timing structure and the recurring timing structure is referenced to an external signal, e.g., a broadcast signal from a satellite, a broadcast signal from a base station in a cellular network, or a beacon transmitter that doesn't communicate user data. The communications device 2700 upon powering up, may be unaware of the current position within the recurring timing structure being used by the peer to peer network. Timing reference point determination module 2718 performs a coarse level of synchronization with respect to the recurring peer to peer timing structure. Determined time reference point 2730 is an output of timing reference point determination module 2718.<br>
[00147]    In this embodiment, the recurring timing structure used by the peer to peer network includes various predefmed intervals such as peer discovery time intervals, traffic intervals and paging intervals. The interval determination module 2720 uses the stored timing structure information 2728 and determined time reference point 2730 to determine the particular type of interval corresponding to a point in time, e.g., a<br>

[00161]     In this embodiment, the recurring timing structure used by the peer to peer network includes various predefined intervals such as peer discovery time intervals, traffic intervals, paging intervals, and timing synchronization intervals. The interval determination module 2826 uses the stored timing structure information 2850 and determined time reference point 2852 to determine the particular type of interval corresponding to a point in time, e.g., a current time. Based on the result of the interval determination module 2826 operation is transferred to various other modules such as the peer discovery module 2832, the peer to peer timing synchronization module 2834, the paging module 2846, and the traffic module 2848.<br>

[00166]    Paging module 2846 performs paging operations during paging intervals, e.g., processing signals identifying that the communications device 2800 is being paged by a peer and/or generating a page signal directed to a peer node to indicate that communications device 2800 is paging a peer node. Traffic module 2848 performs traffic operations during traffic intervals, e.g., generating traffic signals communicating user data, e.g., voice, image, text, file data, etc., to a peer and/or processing received signals communicating user data from a peer,<br>
[00167]    Broadcast signal generation module 2849 generates a predetermined broadcast signal to be transmitted in a time interval having a predetermined offset from the determined time reference point.

Memory 2910 includes routines 2914 and data/information 2916. The processor 2906, e.g., a CPU, executes the routines 2914 and uses the data/information 2916 in memory 2910 to control the operation of the communications device 2900 and implement methods, e.g., the method of flowchart 500 of Figure 5.<br>

[00171]    Wireless receiver module 2902, e.g., an OFDM receiver, is coupled to receive antenna 2903 via which the communications device 2900 receives signals.

Received signals also include, peer node identification signals, e.g., peer node user beacon signals, peer node timing synchronization signals, peer node paging signals, base station paging signals, peer to peer session establishment signals, and peer to peer traffic signals. Wireless receiver module 2902 receives, during a peer discovery time interval, a broadcast signal from a peer commumcations device.<br>
[00172]    Wireless transmitter module 2904, e.g., an OFDM transmitter, is coupled to transmit antenna 2905 via which the communications device 2900 transmits signals. In some embodiments, the same antenna is used for transmitter and receiver. Transmitted signals include a peer node identification signal, e.g., a peer node user beacon signal conveying at least one of a device identifier and a user identifier, peer node timing synchronization signals, a peer to peer paging signal, a paging signal directed to a base station to be forwarded as a wide area paging signal, peer to peer session establishment signals, and peer to peer traffic signals.<br>
[00173]    User I/O devices 2908 include, e.g., microphone, keyboard, keypad, mouse, switches, camera, speaker, display. User I/O devices 2908 allow a user of communications device 2900 to input user data to be directed to a peer, access output user data from a peer, and control at least some functions of the communications device, e.g., page a peer node, establish a peer to peer communications session, terminate a peer to peer communications session.<br>
[00174]     Clock module 2909, e.g., a module including an oscillator chip, is used in maintaining current internal timing of the communications device 2900, e.g., as the communications device 2900 is operated through a recurring peer to peer timing structure.<br>
[00175]    Routines 2914 include a timing reference point determination module 2918, an interval determination module 2920, a peer identifier recovery module 2922, a peer identifier deletion module 2924, a timer module 2926, a timer reset module 2927, a traffic module 2928, a page monitoring module 2934, a page response signaling module<br>

[00176]    Timing reference point determination module 2918 uses a received broadcast signal, e.g., fi-om a satellite, base station, or beacon signal transmitter to determine a time reference point in a recurring peer to peer timing structure. Interval determination module 2920 determines a current interval type in a recurring peer to peer timing structure. Operations of interval determination module 2920 include accessing and using the stored timing structure information 2956 including the paging interval information 2962 to determine recurring paging intervals.<br>
[00177]    Peer identifier recovery module 2922 recovers an identifier from a received broadcast signal firom a peer communications device, which was received during a peer discovery time interval. The recovered identifier is one a device identifier and a user identifier. Peer identifier recovery module 2922 also stores the recovered identifier in recovered peer identifier information 2970 in memory 2910. Device identifier 1 2972, device identifier N 2974, user identifier 1 2976, user identifier M 2978 are examples of stored recovered peer identifiers.<br>
[00178]    Peer identifier deletion module 2924 deletes a received identifier from memory in response to determining that a signal firom a peer communications device corresponding to the identifier has not been detected within a period of time. In some embodiments, the period of time is a predetermined period of time, e.g., the predetermined period of time indicated by no response time information 2984.<br>
[00179]    In some embodiments, the predetermined period of time is a lifetime associated with a received identifier. Exemplary lifetimes associated with received identifiers are shown as lifetime information (2973,2975,2977,2979). In some embodiments, different device and or user identifiers have different associated lifetimes. In some embodiments, the lifetime associated with a peer identifier is a function of the repeat interval between successive communications device identifier broadcast signals for the particular communications device.<br>
[00180] Timer module 2926 which is updated by clock module 2909 is used to determine when a lifetime has expired. Timer module 2926 can, and sometimes does maintain independent status relative to lifethne expiration for a plurality of peers.<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
45<br>
Timer module 2926, in some embodiments, performs an incremental countdown, which continues until lifetime expiration occurs or an event occurs which resets the timer module 2926 with respect to a particular previously discovered peer being tracked. Timer reset module 2927 updates the timer module 2926 when a signal is received from a peer communications device. For example, the reception of an identification signal from a previously identified peer being tracked allows the communications device 2900 to recognize that the peer is still in the local vicinity and powered up, and the timer countdown can be restarted with respect to that peer.<br>
[00181]     Traffic module 2928 controls communication of user data between the communications device 2900 and a peer node via a wireless communications link, e.g., a direct v^reless communications link between the communications device 2900 and a peer node, during a traffic interval of the recurring peer to peer timing structure. Traffic module 2928 includes a transmission control module 2930 and a reception control module 2932.

Reception control module 2932 controls the receiving of user data during a peer to peer traffic interval. In various embodiments, user data includes at least one of: text data, image data, voice data, and application data.<br>
[00182]     In some embodiments, the reception control module 2932 of the traffic module 2928 controls the wireless communications device 2900 to refrain from monitoring for traffic data during at least one traffic interval occurring which follows a paging interval in which no page was detected which was directed to the communications device and prior to the occurrence of another paging interval. In some embodiments, the reception control module 2932 of the traffic module 2928 controls the wireless communications device 2900 to refrain from monitoring for traffic data during any of the traffic intervals occurring between a paging interval in which no page was detected which was directed to the communications device 2900 and the next paging interval during which a page can be directed to communications device 2900.<br>
[00183]     Paging event detection module 2938 detects an event used to trigger sending of a paging message to a peer communications device. For example, a user of the communications device 2910 may perform an input operation via a user I/O device 2908 to generate a page to a particular user or device.<br>
 <br>
070701U3<br>
46<br>
[00184]    Paging interval determination module 2940 determines one of a plurality of paging intervals in the recurring timing structure to be used for transmitting a paging message to a peer communications device, the determined one paging interval being a function of the stored peer identifier corresponding to the peer communications device to which the page is to be directed. For example, in some embodiments, a peer communications device listens to a subset of paging intervals which correspond to its device identifier and/or user identifier, but intentionally do not listen to other paging intervals within the fiiU set of paging intervals in the recurring peer to peer timing structure. Therefore the page is placed in the appropriate page interval so that it can be detected.<br>
[00185]    Peer to peer paging viability module 2946 determines if a peer communications device is pagable by a peer to peer page. The determination of the peer to peer paging viability module 2946 is used by the paging type selection module 2942. Peer to peer paging viability module 2946 includes an identifier list checking module 2948. Identifier list checking module 2948 checks a list of stored identifiers, e.g., identifiers in recovered peer identifier information 2970 to determine if the peer communications device is reachable by a peer to peer page.<br>
[00186]     Paging type selection module 2942 selects between sending a peer to peer page to a peer communications device, e.g., a direct page to the peer commumcations device and sending a page through a base station, e.g., sending a wide area page through a base station. The output of the paging selection module 2942 is used to control which of peer to peer paging module 2952 and wide area paging module 2954 is active for a particular page to be transmitted by wireless transmitter 2904. In some embodiments, the wide area paging is selected as a default when a peer communications device is determined to be unreachable by a peer to peer page.<br>
[00187]    Paging module 2950 operations include generating a page directed to a peer communications device prior to communicating user data to the peer communications device and controlling the wireless transmitter to transmit the generated page. Paging module 2950 controls operation of wireless transmitter module. 2904 to communicate a page to a peer communications device during a paging interval. Paging module 2950 includes a peer to peer paging module 2952 and a wide area paging module 2954.<br>

[00188]    Peer to peer session establishment module 2936 controls communicating peer to peer session establishment information between the communications device 2900 and a peer communications device, e.g., prior to communicating user data. In various embodiments, communicating peer to peer session establishment information includes at least one of sending session establishment information and receiving session establishment information. In some embodiments, the peer to peer session establishment information includes at least one of a session identifier, session quality of service (QoS) information and an indicator of the type of traffic to be communicated during the session.<br>
[00189]    Page monitoring module 2934 monitors during at least some paging intervals in the recurring peer to peer timing structure for pages directed to the communications device 2900. In some embodiments, a subset of the set of paging intervals in the recurring timing structure can be used to direct peer to peer pages to wireless communications device 2900, and wireless communications device 2900 monitors during those paging intervals but does not monitor during other paging intervals.<br>
[00190]    In various embodiments, the page monitoring module 2934 monitors for additional paging signals during paging intervals occurring between traffic intervals in which user data is communicated as part of an ongoing peer to peer communications session between the communications device 2900 and a peer communications device. For example, an additional peer communications device may be seeking to establish a peer to peer communications session with communications device 2900. In some embodiments, wireless communications device 2900 supports a plurality of simultaneous ongoing peer to peer communications sessions. In some embodiments, wireless communications device 2900 may, and sometimes does terminate or suspend an ongoing peer to peer communications session to establish a new peer to peer communications session with a different peer communications device, e.g., in response to a received page indicating a higher priority level.<br>

In some embodiments, the adjustment involves time synchronization control of the receiver, which is facilitated through receiver control module 3226 operation. In some embodiments, the adjustment involves a mathematical processing adjustment of a received signal.<br>
[00254]    In various embodiments, the transmit timing is not adjusted based on signals received from the peer communications devices. Thus the peer to peer wireless communications device uses the same transmit timing irrespective of the peer node to which it is transmitting, but adjusts its receive timing as a function of the peer node which transmitted the signal being received.<br>
[00255]    The generation and maintenance of multiple sets of receive symbol timing adjustment information facilitates: rapid switching between multiple peers, concurrent peer to peer sessions with multiple peers, and/or smaller cyclic prefixes than would otherwise be needed if a single common receive symbol timing adjustment implementation was used.<br>
[00256]    In various embodiments, receive symbol timing adjustment information is generated and maintained during at least some time intervals for at least some peer nodes which do not have current active connections with wireless communications device 3200. Thus the adjustment information is readily available if and when an active connection is initialed.<br>
[00257]    Figure 33 is a drawing of an exemplary peer to peer communications<br>
network 3300 in accordance with various embodiments. Exemplary communications<br>
network 3300 includes a plurality of wireless communications devices supporting peer<br>
to peer communications (WT I 3306, WT 2 3308, WT 3 3310	WT N 3312). In<br>
 <br>

62<br>
some embodiments, the network includes a reference signal source node 3302, e.g., a satellite, a base station, or a beacon signal transmitter that does not transmit user data, the reference signal source node transmitting a reference broadcast signal 3304, that can be utilized by the wireless communications devices supporting peer to peer communications to synchronize with respect to a peer to peer timing structure.<br>
[00258]    Exemplary peer to peer connection communications signals 3314 are shown between WT 1 3306 and WT 3 3310. At least some of the wireless communications devices supporting peer to peer communications are mobile nodes. The exemplary peer to peer communications devices are, e.g., any of the exemplary communications devices 2700 of Figure 27,2800 of Figure 28,2900 of Figure 29, 3000 of Figure 30, 3100 of Figure 31 or 3200 of Figure 32.

The exemplary peer to peer communications devices implement a peer to peer timing structure, e.g., one or more of the timing structures described with respect to Figure 1, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 16, Figure 17, Figure 20, Figure 21, Figure 22, or Figure 23 or a peer to peer timing structure using a feature or features described therein.<br>
[00259]     While described in the context of an OFDM system, the methods and apparatus of various embodiments are applicable to a wide range of communications systems including many non-OFDM and/or non-cellular systems. Some exemplary systems include a mixture of technologies utilized m the peer to peer signalmg, e.g., some OFDM type signals and some CDMA type signals.<br>
[00260]    In various embodiments nodes described herein are implemented using one or more modules to perform the steps corresponding to one or more methods, for example, determining a timing reference point, accessing stored peer to peer timing structure information, identifying a type of peer to peer timing structure time interval, performing peer discovery, performing peer to peer timing synchronization, performing peer to peer paging operations, identifying traffic control resources, monitoring identified traffic control resources, maintaining peer to peer active connection lists,<br>
 <br>
63<br>
performing peer to peer traffic operations, etc. In some embodiments various features are implemented using modules. Such modules may be implemented using software, hardware or a combination of software and hardware.
