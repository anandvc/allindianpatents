				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates, in general, to mobile communication technology. Further, this invention relates to Mobile Phone Application, Video Call, Phonebook in mobile handheld devices. More particularly, this invention relates to a method for capturing and associating image with address book during a Video Telephony Call.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Currently the method for storing image information with the corresponding contact entry in the phonebook is as follows:<br>
1.	Receive the photo ID (image) explicitly<br>
This can be done by capturing the image of the desired person using a camera phone or by receiving the image through MMS in an MMS enabled phone or download the image over a data connection.<br>
2.	Add the photo ID to contact information<br>
The stored image can be added to the contact information entry using the phonebook application by the user manually.<br>
The current approach has the limitation that it requires the user to explicitly obtain the photo ID of the contact and store the information in the phonebook.<br>
It needs the person take the image and pass on to the other user who wants to insert the image in the phonebook OR the person needs to be physically present near the user who wants to insert the image in the phonebook for the image to be captured by the phone camera.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to invent a method for capturing and associating image with address book during a Video Telephony Call.<br>
The invention provides a mechanism to automatically obtain the image of the desired person and store it with the corresponding contact information entry in the phonebook.<br>
The Mobile Phone with ability to support Video Call is used to start a Video Telephony Conversation with the desired party. The Called party determines the time when snapshot of the caller party image needs to be taken. The image (snapshot) is stored in the background. At the end of the call, the user is prompted to associate the image with the called party contact information in the phonebook.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for capturing and associating image with address book during a video telephony call comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	initiating a videocall by the calling party through a mobile device;<br>
(b)	capturing an image of the called party by a calling party during a video call using the said mobile device; and<br>
(c)	attaching the captured image to the contact information in the phonebook of the calling party.<br>
The said mobile device supports Video calls. A Ul on the mobile device supports storing a snapshot of the image on the screen of the calling party. The phonebook application on the mobile phone that supports adding the image to the contact information corresponding to the called party. While the calling party is having a video telephony call with the called party, the video image of the called party is displayed on the screen.<br>
The calling party does a first key press to clear the screen of the said mobile device and display a snapshot of called party image. The calling party does a second key press to capture the called party image and stores it. The calling party mobile screen displays the stored image and the mobile device is adapted to switch to the video on a third key press.<br>
When the calling party has contact information stored in the phonebook, and no image of the called party the calling party is informed by the Ul, to capture the called party's image which is indicated by flashing informational text / bitmap on the screen. When the calling party has contact information stored in the phonebook, and an image is already associated then the Ul prompts the calling party to replace the image stored in the phonebook by the image captured. When the calling party has no contact information stored in the phonebook, the Ul inform the calling party to capture the image of the called party by flashing informational text / bitmap on the screen and prompts to get information for the new contact and store the captured image for this contact.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from ensuing the detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 Video Call in progress - Bigger Picture is of Called party, Calling Party in P-i-P<br>
Figure 2 First Key Press to clear the screen and display a snapshot of called party image<br>
Figure 3 Second Key Press to capture the called party image DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention proposes the following mechanisms:<br>
1.	Automatically capture image of the called party during a video call.<br>
2.	Attach the captured image to the contact information in the phonebook.<br>
The following are the elements of the invention:<br>
1.	Mobile phone with ability to support a Video call.<br>
2.	Ul on the Mobile phone to support storing a snapshot of the image on the screen.<br>
3.	Phonebook application on the Mobile phone that supports adding the image to the contact information corresponding to the called party.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a Video Call in progress - Bigger Picture is of Called party, Calling Party in P-i-P.<br>
Figure 2 shows the First Key Press to clear the screen and display a snapshot of called party image.<br>
Figure 3 shows the Second Key Press to capture the called party image.<br>
The following are the steps for the invention<br>
1.	The user sets up a Video Telephony call with the desired party (contact).<br>
2.	While the user is having a video telephony call with the contact, the video image of the contact is displayed on the screen.<br>
3.	User can press one hard/soft key to remove all other information like battery bar, antenna bar, user p-i-p etc. from the screen.<br>
4.	Second Press of the Key will capture the screen at that instant in the background.<br>
5.	User shall be given an option to see the stored image on a key press.<br>
On the Key Press, the screen displays the stored image else the video call continues.<br>
On the same Key Press, the screen shall again display the video call. (Screen will toggle between video call and stored image)<br>
6.	This captured screen (image of the peer) can automatically be associated with the corresponding contact information into phonebook.<br>
There are three operational scenarios for the mechanism.<br>
1.	Operational Scenario -1<br>
The peer party has contact information stored in the phonebook, but no image<br>
When the call is started, the user shall be informed by the Ul, that the user can capture the peer party's image. This can be indicated by flashing some informational text/bitmap on the screen<br>
2.	Operational Scenario - 2<br>
The peer party has contact information stored In the phonebook, but an image is already associated<br>
At the end of the call, Ul prompts the user if the image captured in the session should replace the image stored in the phonebook.<br>
3.	Operational Scenario - 3<br>
The peer party has no contact Information stored in the phonebook<br>
When the call is started, Ul shall inform the user that the peer party's image can be captured. This can be indicated by flashing some informational text/bitmap on the screen. <br>
At the end of the call the user shall be prompted by the Ul to get information for the new contact (Name, Address, etc.) and store the captured image for this contact.<br>
Presented idea has provided a new method to capture Photo of called/calling person by taking input from the video stream coming in and there would be no need to explicitly obtain image of the called party, hence a useful feature for the users.<br>
The above-presented description is of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention.
