PRODUCTION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of US Patent Application No. 60/387,690,<br>
filed June 11,2002, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to small molecular compounds which inhibit beta<br>
amyloid production and have utility in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia (loss of<br>
memory) in the elderly. The main pathological lesions of AD found in the brain<br>
consist of extracellular deposits of beta amyloid protein in the form of plaques and<br>
angiopathy and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of aggregated<br>
hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Recent evidence has revealed that elevated beta<br>
amyloid levels in the brain not only precede tau pathology but also correlate with<br>
cognitive decline. Further suggesting a causative role for beta amyloid in AD, recent<br>
studies have shown that aggregated beta amyloid is toxic to neurons in cell culture<br>
and has a detrimental effect on memory. This suggests that reducing beta amyloid<br>
levels is a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.<br>
Beta amyloid protein is composed mainly of 39 to 42 amino acid peptides and<br>
is produced from a larger precursor protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP) by<br>
the sequential action of the proteases beta and gamma secretase. Although rare, cases<br>
of early onset AD have been attributed to genetic mutations in APP that lead to an<br>
overproduction of either total beta amyloid protein or its more aggregation-prone 42<br>
amino acid isoform. Furthermore, people with Down's Syndrome possess an extra<br>
chromosome that contains the gene that encodes APP and thus have elevated beta<br>
amyloid levels and invariably develop AD later in life.<br>
There continues to be a need for compositions useful in inhibiting beta<br>
amyloid production and in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.<br><br>

Other aspects and advantages of the present invention are described further in<br>
the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments thereof.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods of monitoring beta amyloid<br>
production in patients at risk for, or suffering from, AD and other diseases resulting<br>
from elevated levels of beta amyloid protein in the brain.<br>
The present invention also provides methods of lowering beta amyloid levels<br>
which includes delivering to a patient a pharmaceutically acceptable amount of a<br>
compound of the invention and monitoring the levels of beta-amyloid in the patient.<br>
By the term "patient" as used herein is meant to describe a mammal which has<br>
been diagnosed as having or is at risk of having one or more of the conditions for<br>
which modulation of beta amyloid levels is desirable. Preferably, the patient is a<br>
human, domestic animal, including canines and felines, or livestock and more<br>
preferably is a human. Thus, the compounds are useful for treatment and/or<br>
prevention of a number of human and veterinary conditions.<br>
By the term "lowering beta amyloid levels" as used herein is meant to describe<br>
decreasing or inhibiting beta amyloid production in a patient. A variety of conditions<br>
can be treated by lowering beta amyloid production in a patient and include<br>
Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, Down's Syndrome, and mild cognitive impairment,<br>
among others.<br>
As used herein, the term "prevention" encompasses precluding the onset of<br>
symptoms in a patient who has been identified with or is at risk for a condition<br>
resulting from elevated levels of beta amyloid protein in the brain. The patient may<br>
not have been diagnosed with the same or have not yet presented any symptoms<br>
thereof.<br><br>

Compounds", ed. J.F. Stoddard, Pergamon Press, New York (1979). Preferred<br>
methods include, but are not limited to, those outlined below.<br>
In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to utilize chirally pure α-amino<br>
acids, 1,2-aminoalcohols, N-sulfonyl α-amino acids, and N-sulfonyl 1,2-<br>
aminoalcohols in the reactions described herein for the production of the<br>
phenylsulfonamides of the invention. A number of methods for producing these<br>
compounds are known in the art. Among desirable methodologies are those described<br>
in US Patent Application No. 60/339,264, filed December 11, 2001, and later filed as<br>
US Patent Application No. 10/304,322 and International Patent Application<br>
PCT/US02/38119, both filed November 26, 2002, "Process for the Synthesis of<br>
Chirally Pure α-Amino-Alcohols"; US Patent Application No. 10/014,304, filed<br>
December 11, 2001, entitled "Heterocyclic Sulfonamide Inhibitors of Beta Amyloid<br>
Production", published as US-2002-0183361-A on December 5, 2002; and US Patent<br>
Application No. 10/166,896, filed June 11, 2002 and later published January 16, 2003<br>
as US-2003-0013892-A1, entitled "Production of Chirally Pure α-Amino Acids and<br>
N-Sulfonyl α-Amino Acids".<br>
A first method of preparation for the compounds of the invention consists of<br>
reaction of a 1,2-aminoalcohol II with the appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence<br>
of a base such as triethylamine (TEA) and in a suitable solvent to afford compounds<br>
of formula III. For compounds where R9 and R10 are hydrogen, oxidation of the N-<br><br>
sulfonyl primary alcohol with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) or under Swem<br>
conditions then affords the corresponding aldehyde IV which can be reacted with<br>
Grignard reagents to afford the secondary alcohols V as a mixture of diastereomers<br>
which can be separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or other<br>
suitable methods (Scheme 1).<br><br>
A second method of preparation involves reaction of an a-amino acid or ester<br>
DC with the appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence of a base such as triethylamine<br>
and in a suitable solvent to afford compounds of formula X (Scheme 2). The<br>
intermediate N-sulfonyl acid X (Rx=H) can be converted to the corresponding<br>
primary alcohol VIII (R9=R10=H) utilizing standard methodology such as LiAIH4<br>
(LAH), B2H6 or cyanuric chloride/NaBH4. The intermediate N-sulfonyl ester X<br>
(Rx=alkyl, Bn) can also be reduced to the corresponding primary alcohol VIII<br>
utilizing standard methodology such as LiAIH4. Alternatively, the intermediate N-<br>
sulfonyl ester X (Rx=alkyl, Bn) can be converted to the aldehyde IV with diisobutyl<br>
aluminumhydride (DiBAL). Finally, the intermediate N-sulfonyl ester X (Rx=alkyl,<br>
Bn) can be reacted with 2 equivalents of Grignard reagent to afford the tertiary<br>
alcohols HI with R9=R10. Alternatively, for tertiary alcohols III with R9 not equal to<br><br>
R10, the corresponding Weinreb amide (see Scheme 7) of the N-sulfonyl acid can be<br>
prepared and subsequently reacted with R9MgX and R10MgX.<br><br>
In a variation of the second method to prepare the primary alcohols, an α-<br>
amino acid or ester (or N-protected derivative thereof) VI is first converted to the<br>
corresponding primary 1,2-aminoalcohol VII (using the methodology outlined in the<br>
previous paragraph), which is subsequently, after deprotection (if necessary), reacted<br>
with the appropriate sulfonyl halide (Scheme 3) to afford compounds of formula VIII.<br><br><br>
For the preparation of compounds derived from unnatural a-amino acids<br>
containing beta branching in the amino acid side chain, a method of preparation based<br>
on the work of Hruby (Tet. Lett. 38: 5135-5138 (1997)), incorporated by reference, is<br>
outlined in Scheme 4. This route entails formation of the α, β-unsaturated amide XII<br>
of the Evans chiral auxiliary from an α,β-unsaturated acid XI, followed by conjugate<br>
addition of an organocuprate, trapping of the resulting enolate anion XIII with N-<br>
bromosuccinimide (NBS), displacement of the bromide XIV with azide anion to<br>
afford XV, followed by reduction to the 1,2-aminoalcohol and subsequent<br>
sulfonylation to afford the target compound XVI.<br><br><br>
For the preparation of N-alkylated sulfonamides XVII (R6 can be alkyl,<br>
substituted alkyl, allyl, substituted allyl, benzyl, or substituted benzyl), the<br>
sulfonamide ester X can be N-alkylated by either treatment with a suitable base such<br>
as sodium hydride followed by the alkylating agent R6X or by employing Mitsunobu<br>
conditions (R6OH/DEAD, TPP). LiBH4 reduction of the N-alkylated sulfonamide<br>
ester affords the N-alkylated sulfonamide in the primary alcohol series XVII (Scheme<br>
5). These primary alcohols XVII can be converted to N-alkylated analogs of the<br>
secondary alcohols V or aldehyde IV series by chemistry that has been outlined<br>
above. Alternatively, the N-alkylated sulfonamide esters, or their corresponding<br>
Weinreb amides, can be treated with Grignard reagents to afford the N-alkylated<br>
analogs of the tertiary alcohols III (where R9 and R10 are non-hydrogen).<br><br>
As previously noted (Scheme 1), the preparation of sulfonamides derived from<br>
1,2-arrJnoalcohols in the secondary alcohol series V results in the formation of a<br>
diastereomeric mixture. An alternate method of preparation of these compounds that<br>
results in the production of a pure diastereomer is outlined in Scheme 7 for<br>
compounds derived from L-isoleucine. This method which utilizes chemistry<br>
previously employed by Ronx (Tetrahedron 50: 5354-5360 (1994)), consists of<br>
addition of Grignard reagents to the Weinreb amide XXIII (derived from the requisite<br>

II. Formulations of the Invention<br>
The compounds described herein can be formulated in any form suitable for<br>
the desired route of delivery using a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or<br>
more of the compounds of the invention. For example, the compositions of the<br>
invention can be delivered by a route such as oral, dermal, transdermal,<br>
intrabronchial, intranasal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral,<br>
intraperitoneal, sublingual, intracrar.ial. epidural, intratracheal, intranasal, vaginal,<br>
rectal, or by sustained release. Preferably, delivery is oral.<br>
A pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound used according to the<br>
present invention can vary depending on the specific compound, mode of delivery,<br>
severity of the condition being treated, and any other active ingredients used in the<br>
formulation or the selected regimen. The dosing regimen can be adjusted to provide<br>
the optimal therapeutic response. Several divided doses can be delivered daily or a<br>
single daily dose can be delivered. The dose can however be proportionally reduced<br>
or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
As described herein, a pharmaceutically useful amount of a compound of the<br>
invention is that amount of a compound which alleviates the symptoms of the disease,<br>
e.g., AD, or which prevents the onset of symptoms, or the onset of more severe<br>
symptoms. Generally, an individual dose (i.e., per unit, e.g., tablet) of a compound of<br>
the invention can be in the range from about 1 ug/kg to about 10 g/kg, more<br>
preferably 10 mg/kg to about 5 g/kg, and most preferably about 1 mg/kg to about 200<br>
mg/kg. Desirably, these amounts are provided on a daily basis. However, the dosage<br>

An alternate preparation of sulfonamides derived from unnatural 1,2-<br>
aminoalcohols utilizes the Bucherer modification of the Strecker α-amino acid<br>
synthesis (Scheme 6). In this route, an aldehyde XVHI is reacted with cyanide anion<br>
and ammonium carbonate to afford the hydantoin XIX, which is hydrolyzed to the a-<br>
amino acid XX. This compound is then reduced to XXI and sulfonylated to afford the<br>
desired compounds of formula XXII.<br><br><br>

IV. Methods of Use<br>
The compounds of the present invention have utility for the prevention and<br>
treatment of disorders involving beta amyloid production, including cerebrovascular<br>
diseases, and the prevention and treatment of AD by virtue of their ability to reduce<br>
beta amyloid production.<br>
In preliminary studies using protease specific assays, the compounds of the<br>
invention have been shown to exhibit specific inhibition with respect to protease<br>
activity. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful for treatment and<br>
prevention of a variety of conditions in which modulation of beta amyloid levels<br>
provides a therapeutic benefit. Such conditions include, e.g., amyloid angiopathy,<br>
cerebral amyloid angiopathy, systemic amyloidosis, Alzheimer's Disease (AD),<br>
hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type, inclusion body<br>
myositis, Down's syndrome and mild cognitive impairment, among others.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have also been shown to inhibit beta<br>
amyloid production. In one embodiment, a subject or patient can be monitored for<br>
circulating levels of the compounds and/or beta-amyloid levels, from time to time<br>
following administration of a compound of the invention, or during the course of<br>
treatment. A variety of assays can be utilized for this purpose, including those<br>
described below. Additionally, cellular, cell-free and in vivo screening methods, as<br>
well as radioimmunoassays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to<br>
detect inhibitors of beta amyloid production are known in the art (See, e.g., P.D.<br><br>
III. Formulation Delivery<br>
The present invention provides methods of providing the compounds of the<br>
invention to a patient. The compounds can be delivered by a route such as oral,<br>

subcutaneous, parenteral, intraperitoneal, sublingual, intracranial, epidural,<br>
intratracheal, intranasal, vaginal, rectal, or by sustained release. Preferably, delivery<br>
is oral.<br>
In one embodiment, the compositions are delivered orally in solid or liquid<br>
form by powder, tablet, capsule, microcapsules, dispersible powder, granule,<br>
suspension, syrup, elixir, and aerosol.<br>
Desirably, when the compound is delivered orally, it is sub-divided in a dose<br>
containing appropriate quantities of the active ingredient. The unit dosage forms can<br>
be packaged compositions, for example packeted powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled<br>
syringes or sachets containing liquids. The unit dosage form can be, for example, a<br>
capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any such compositions<br>
in package form. Preferably, the powders and tablets contain up to 99% of the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
In another embodiment, the compounds are delivered intravenously,<br>
intramuscularly, subcutaneously, parenterally and intraperitoneally in the form of<br>
sterile injectable solutions, suspensions, dispersions, and powders which are fluid to<br>
the extent that easy syringe ability exits. Such injectable compositions are sterile,<br>
stable under conditions of manufacture and storage, and free of the contaminating<br>
action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.<br>
Injectable formations can be prepared by combining the compound with a<br>
liquid. The liquid can be selected from among water, glycerol, ethanol, propylene<br>
glycol and polyethylene glycol, oils, and mixtures thereof, and more preferably the<br>
liquid carrier is water. In one embodiment, the oil is vegetable oil. Optionally, the<br>
liquid carrier contains about a suspending agent.<br>

The compounds can further be utilized in generating reagents useful in<br>
diagnosis of conditions associated with abnormal levels of beta amyloid. For<br>
example, the compounds of Formula I can be used to generate antibodies which<br>
would be useful in a variety of diagnostic assays. Methods for generating<br>
monoclonal, polyclonal, recombinant, and synthetic antibodies or fragments thereof,<br>
are well known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., E. Mark and Padlin,<br>

Example 49<br>
4-Chloro-N-[(1S,2R)-1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]<br>
benzenesulfonamide<br><br>
Part 1:<br>
A solution of 2-pentenoic acid (4.05 mL, 40 mmol) in THF (100 mL) was<br>
cooled to -78°C. Triethylamine (5.85 mL, 42 mmol) and trimethylacetyl chloride<br>
(pivaloyl chloride) (5.17 mL, 42 mmol) were added via syringe in that order. The dry<br>
ice bath was replaced with an ice bath and the reaction stirred at 0°C for 1 hour, then<br>
the reaction was recooled to -78°C. In a separate flask 4-(R)-4-benzyl-2-<br>
oxazolidinone (7.0 g, 40 mmol) was dissolved in THF (100 mL) and cooled to -78°C,<br>
then n-butyl lithium (1.6 M, 25 mL) was added via syringe. The mixture was stirred<br>
for 20 minutes then the above reaction mixture was added by removing the septum<br>
and pouring quickly from one flask to the other (Note* attempts to transfer reaction<br>
mixture via cannula failed due to the suspended triethylammonium chloride in the<br>
mixture).<br>
The resulting mixture was stirred at -78°C for 30 minutes then allowed to<br>
warm to 25°C for 1 to 2 hours before quenching with saturated aqueous NH4Cl<br>
solution (100 mL). Volatiles were removed on the rotary evaporator and the aqueous<br>
slurry was diluted with water (200 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 200 mL).<br>
The combined organic phase was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The<br>
product may crystallize out of solution and be of high purity. If purification is<br>
required, the crude product can be purified by flash chromatography using 20-30%<br>
ethyl acetate in hexane.<br><br>
Part 2:<br>
To a copper (I) bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (246 mg, 1.2 mmol) in<br>
THF/DMS (2:1,15 mL), cooled to -40° C, was added 4-methoxyphenyl magnesium<br>

Example 278 - Repressor Release Assay (RRA)<br>
The beta amyloid inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention<br>
was determined using the Repressor Release Assay (RRA). See, Table 17. A<br>
compound was considered active in RRA if it leads to at least a 1.5 fold increase in<br>
luciferase activity at 10 ug/mL and was non-toxic.<br>
A. Cell Culture<br>
CH0-K1 cells were cultured in whole DMEM media (DMEM - High<br>
Glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Non-essential Amino Acids, and 1%<br><br>
Penicillin-Streptomycin) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Two million cells were plated into<br>
10-cm dishes 24 hrs prior to transfection.<br>
Transient transfections were completed as recommended by Gibco<br>
BRL using their Lipofectamine Plus system. First, 6 µg of pRSVO-luc and 6 µg of<br>
APP-1acI construct DNA were added to 460 µL Opti-Mem transfection media and<br>
incubated with 30 µL Plus reagent for 15 minutes. Then, a lipid mixture of 40 µL<br>
Lipofectamine reagent and 460 µL Opti-Mem transfection media was incubated with<br>
the DNA-Plus reagent mixture for 15 minutes. During the DNA-lipid incubation, the<br>
CHO-K1 cells were washed once and covered in 5.0 mL DMEM media without<br>
Penicillin-Streptomycin. The DNA-lipid preparation was then layered onto these<br>
cells and incubated at 37°C overnight.<br>
One and one half million transfected cells per well (100 µL total<br>
volume) were plated into sterile, opaque Packard 96-well Culture-Plates in clear<br>
DMEM whole media (DMEM - without phenol red) and incubated at 37°C with 5%<br>
CO2 for 3-5 hours.<br>
B. Compound Dilution<br>
Compounds were diluted using two different protocols; one protocol<br>
was used for compounds supplied neat (weighed powder in vial) and the other<br>
protocol was used for compounds supplied in solution (20 mM in DMSO in 96-well<br>
plates). For both protocols. 25 mM Hepes and 25 mM Hepes/1% DMSO were<br>
prepared fresh to be used as diluent. The Hepes/DMSO was used as the diluent<br>
control on all experimental plates.<br>
The following table depicts the steps for compound dilution (please<br>
note that the last step was the addition of compound to cells/media in tissue culture<br>
plate).<br><br><br>
Because some compounds were present in 96-well format, at 20 mM, the<br>
following represents the protocol for their dilution (note that an average molecular<br>
weight of these compounds was used to calculate these cilutions and as above, the last<br>
step was the addition of compound to cells/media in tissue culture plate).<br><br>
Once the compounds were diluted, they were applied ir duplicate on<br>
cells in tissue culture plates (prepared above). Cells were incubated with compound<br>
at 37°C with 5% CO2 for an additional 36-48 hours.<br>
C. Assay Measurement<br>
Luciferase assays (LucLite reagent, Packard) were performed and were<br>
read on a Packard TopCount instrument. Media was removed from each 96-well plate<br>
and replaced with 100 µL PBS per well (with Mg2+ and Ca2+). An equal volume (100<br>
µL) of the LucLite lysis/substrate buffer was added to each well and the plates were<br>
sealed and mixed in the dark on a rotary shaker for 15-30 minutes at room<br>
temperature. Luciferase readings were then taken on the TopCount instrument.<br><br>
Measurements were expressed as relative light units (RLU) and are calculated and<br>
analyzed in MS Excel as follows:<br>
D.	Analysis of data<br>
"Fold Increase" refers to the amount of luciferase activity (measured in<br>
relative light units) over diluent control. "SEM" refers to the standard error of the<br>
mean for fold increase. "Activity": A compound is considered active if it results in at<br>
least a 1.5 fold increase in luciferase activity at 10 µg/µL. 1=non-toxic, 0=toxic in<br>
Table 17. "Toxicity" is determined by loss of signal (≤ 0.75 fold increase).<br>
E.	Standard beta amyloid inhibitor<br>
The reference gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT (LY374973,<br>
AN37124: Dovey, H.F. et al, J. Neurochem. 76: 173-181 (2001)) was prepared as<br>
outlined in WO 98/22494 and tested in RRA and exhibited a 6.0-28.1 fold increase in<br>
luciferase activity at 20 µg/mL.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
