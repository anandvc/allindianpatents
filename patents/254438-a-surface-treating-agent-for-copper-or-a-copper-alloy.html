				<td>DESCRIPTION PHENYLNAPHTHYLIMIDAZOLE COMPOUND AND USAGE OF THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel phenylnaphthylimidazole compound represented by the following formula (I); a surface treating agent which is used during soldering electronic parts or the like to copper or a copper alloy of a printed wiring board; a surface treatment method of copper or a copper alloy; a printed wiring board; and a soldering method.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
In the formula, when AI is a phenyl group, then A2 represents a 1-naphfhyl group or a 2-naphthyl group, and when AI is a 1-naphthyl group or a 2-naphthyl group, then A2 represents a phenyl group; and R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, surface mount technology with high density has been widely adopted.  Such surface mount technology are classified, among others, into double-sided<br><br>
surface mount technology in which chip type parts are joined with use of solder paste, and hybrid mount technology which is a combination of surface mount technology of chip type parts using solder paste and through-hole mount technology of discrete parts.  In either mount process, a printed wiring board is subjected to two or more soldering steps, and thus it is exposed to high temperatures resulting in a severe thermal history.<br>
Oxide film formation is accelerated by heating the surface of copper or copper alloys constituting the circuit part of a printed wiring board, and thus the surface of the circuit part cannot maintain good solderability.<br>
In order to protect the copper circuit part of the printed wiring board from air oxidation, a chemical layer is generally formed on the surface of the circuit part using a-surface treating agent. It is necessary, however, that good solderability be maintained by preventing the chemical layer from degenerating (i.e., being degraded) to protect the copper circuit part even after the copper circuit part has a thermal history of multiple cycles.<br>
Tin-lead alloy eutectic solders have been<br>
conventionally used for mounting electronic parts to a printed wiring board, etc.  In recent years, however, concerns have developed that the lead contained in the solder alloy adversely affects the human body, and thus the use of lead-free<br><br>
solder is desired.<br>
Accordingly, various lead-free solders are being considered.  For example, lead-free solders have been suggested in which one or more metals, such as silver, zinc, bismuth, indium, antimony, copper, etc., are added to. a base metal of tin.<br>
The conventionally used tin-lead eutectic solder is excellent in wettability on the surface of substrate, particularly copper, and thus strongly adheres to copper, resulting in high reliability. In contrast/ lead-free solder is inferior to the conventionally used tin-lead solder in wettability on a copper surface, and thus exhibits poor solderability and low bonding strength due to voids and other bonding defects.<br>
Therefore, when using lead-free solder, it is necessary to select a solder alloy with superior solderability and a flux which is suitable for use with lead-free solder. A surface treatment agent for use in preventing oxidation on the surface of copper or a copper alloy is also required to have functions for improving the wettability and solderability of the lead-free solder.<br>
Many lead-free solders have a high melting point, and a soldering temperature that is about 20 to about 50°C higher than that of the conventionally used tin-lead eutectic solder. Thus, surface treatment agent for use in the process of<br><br>
soldering with lead-free solder should have the characteristic of being able to form a chemical layer with excellent heat resistance.<br>
As active ingredients of these surface treating agents, various imidazole compounds have been proposed. For example, Patent Document 1 disclose 2-alkylimidazole compounds such as 2-undecylimidazole; Patent Document 2 discloses 2-arylimidazole compounds such as 2-phenylimidazole and 2-phenyl-4-methylimidazole; Patent Document 3 discloses 2-alkyl-benzimidazole compounds such as 2-nonylbenzimidazole; and Patent Document 4 discloses 2-aralkylbenzimidazole compounds such as 2- (4-chlorophenylmethyl)benzimidazole, respectively.<br>
However, in the case where a surface treating agent containing such an imidazole compound is used, the heat resistance of a chemical layer as formed on the copper surface was not satisfactory yet. Also, in soldering, the solder wettability is not sufficient so that good solderability cannot be obtained. In particular, in the case of performing soldering using a lead-free solder in place of the eutectic solder, it was difficult to put the foregoing surface treating agent into practical use.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing circumstance, the invention has been made. An object of the invention is to provide a novel phenylnaphthylimidazole compound, and to provide a surface treating agent, which in mounting electronic parts or the like to a printed wiring board using an eutectic solder or a lead-free solder, forms a chemical layer having excellent heat resistance on the surface of copper or a copper alloy constituting a circuit part of a printed wiring board or the like and at the same time, improves the wettability to the solder and makes the solderability good and a surface treatment method.<br>
Also, another object of the invention is to provide a printed wiring board resulting from bringing the surface of copper or a copper alloy constituting a copper circuit part into contact with the foregoing surface treating agent and to provide a soldering method by bringing the surface of copper or a copper alloy into contact with the foregoing surface treating agent and then performing soldering using an eutectic solder or a lead-free solder.<br>
In order to solve the foregoing problems, the present inventors made extensive and intensive investigations. As a result, it has been found that by bringing a surface treating<br><br>
agent containing a novel phenylnaphthylimidazole compound represented by the foregoing formula (I) as an active ingredient into contact with the surface of copper or a copper alloy/ the objects of the invention can be achieved, leading to accomplishment of the invention.<br>
The surface treating agent containing a novel phenylnaphthylimidazole compound according to the invention is not only able to form a chemical layer having excellent heat resistance on the surface of copper or a copper alloy constituting a circuit part of a printed wiring board or the like but also able to greatly improve the wettability of an eutectic solder and a lead-free solder to the subject surface and make the solderability good.<br>
Also, since the soldering method according to the invention makes it possible to use a solder not containing lead which is a harmful metal, it is useful from the viewpoint of environmental protection.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Best modes for carrying out the invention will be described below.<br>

The phenylnaphthylimidazole compound according to the invention can be synthesized according to known methods. That is, among the phenylnaphthylimidazole compounds according to the invention, compounds classified into a 2-phenyl-4-naphthylimidazole compound in which the 2-position and 4-position of the imidazole ring thereof are substituted with a phenyl group and a naphthyl group, respectively, i.e., 2-phenyl-4-(1-naphthyl)imidazole, 2-phenyl-(4-(2-naphthy)-imidazole, 2-phenyl-4-(1-naphthyl)-5-methylimidazole, and 2-phenyl-4-(2-naphthyl)-5-methylimidazole, can be, for example, synthesized by reacting a 2-halogenated naphthyl-alkylketone compound and a benzamidine compound under heating in an organic solvent in the presence of a dehydrohalogenating agent as shown in the following reaction scheme.<br>

The amount of the dehydrohalogenating agent to be used is preferably in a proportion of from 1 to 10 equivalent times based on the 2-halogenated naphthylalkylketone compound.<br>
Examples of the foregoing 2-halogenated naphthylalkylketone compounds include eo-bromo-1-acetonaphthone, (D-bromo-2-acetonaphthone, 2-bromo-l'-propionaphthone, 2-bromo-2'-propionaphthone, a-chloro-l-acetonaphthone, o-iodo-1-acetonaphthone, 2-chloro-l'-propionaphthone, and 2-iodo-2'-propionaphthone.<br>
Among these 2-halogenated naphthylalkylketone<br>

o-bronio-2-acetonaphthone, those, for example, which are synthesized by halogenating a naphthylalkylkeone compound at the 2-position can be used. With respect to the halogenation at the 2-position, though chlorination at the 2-position and iodination at the 2-position are possible, bromination at the 2-position for reacting one mole of a naphthylalkylketone compound with one mole bromine is the simplest.<br>

Examples of suitable solvents include alcohols such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol; hydrocarbons such as hexane and toluene; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and chlorobenzene; esters such as ethyl acetate; nitriles such as acetonitrile; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; amides such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylacetamide<br>
(DMAC); and besides, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably from room temperature to the reflux temperature; and the reaction time<br>
is preferably from 1 to 10 hours. The reaction may be usually performed under the atmospheric pressure.<br>
The 2-phenyl-4-naphthylimidazole compounds as formed under the foregoing reaction conditions can be taken out by/ for example, the following isolation operation.  That is, after completion of the reaction, a crude desired material can be obtained as a solid by, for example, adding a large amount of water to the obtained reaction mixture or a concentrate from which the solvent has been distilled off from the reaction mixture.  This crude material can be purified by a recrystallization operation or the like.<br>
Among the phenylnaphthylimidazole compounds according to the invention, compounds classified into a 2-naph-thyl-4-phenylimidazole compound in which the 2-position and 4-position of the imidazole ring thereof are substituted with a naphthyl group and a phenyl group, respectively, with the 5-position being not substituted, i.e., 2-(l-naph-thyl)-4-phenylimidazole and 2-(2-naphthyl)-4-phenylimidaz-ole, can be, for example, synthesized by reacting a naphthaIdehyde compound, 2-acetoxyacetophenone, ammonia, and copper(II) acetate under heating in a water-soluble organic solvent such as alcohols as shown in the following reaction scheme.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
In the reaction as shown in the foregoing reaction scheme, the amount of the 2-acetoxyacetophenone to be used may be preferably in a proportion of from 0.8 to 1.5 times by mole, and more preferably from 0.9 to 1.1 times by mole based on the naphthaldehyde compound. The amount of ammonia to be used may be preferably in a proportion of from 10 to 50 times by mole, and more preferably from 20 to 30 times by mole based on the naphthaldehyde compound. The amount of copper (II) acetate to be used may be preferably in a proportion of from 1 to 5 times by mole, and more preferably from 2 to 3 times by mole based on the naphthaldehyde compound.<br>

The 2-naphthyl-4-phenylimidazole compound as formed under the foregoing reaction conditions can be taken out by, for example, the following isolation operation.  That is, after completion of the reaction, a precipitate is collected by filtration, and the deposit is suspended in methanol. Next, sodium hydrosulf ide in an amount of from 0.5 to 0.8 times by mole based on the naphthaldehyde compound is added to this methanol suspension step by step until sodium hydrosulf ide has been no longer consumed; deposited copper sulfide is filtered out; the methanol is distilled off in vacuo; and the residue is rinsed with water, whereby a crude desired material can be obtained as a solid. This crude material can be purified by a recrystallization operation or the like.<br>
Among the phenylnaphthylimidazole compounds according to the invention, compounds classified into a 2-naphthyl-4-phenyl-5-methylimidazole compound in which the 2-position, 4-position and 5-position of the imidazole ring thereof are substituted with a naphthyl group, a phenyl group and a methyl group, respectively, i.e., 2-(1-naphthyl)-4-phenyl-5-methylimidazole and<br>
2- (2-naphthyl)-4-phenyl-5-methylimidazole, can be, for example, synthesized by reacting a naphthaldehyde compound, 1-phenyl-l,2-propanedione, and ammonium acetate in acetic acid under heating as shown in the following reaction scheme.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
In the reaction as shown in the foregoing reaction scheme, the amount of the 1-phenyl-l,2-propanedione to be used may be preferably in a proportion of from 0.8 to 1.5 times by mole, and more preferably from 0.. 9 to 1.1 times by mole based on the naphthaldehyde compound.  The amount of ammonium acetate to be used may be preferably in a proportion of from 2 to 10 times by mole, and more preferably from 4 to 6 times by mole based on the naphthaldehyde compound.<br>
The naphthaldehyde compound which is used in this reaction includes 1-naphthaldehyde and 2-naphthaldehyde, and these compounds are the same as described previously.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably from 80 °C to the reflux temperature; and the reaction time is preferably from<br>
1 to 10 hours.  The reaction may be usually performed under the atmospheric pressure.<br>
The 2-naphthyl-4-phenyl-5-methylimidazole compound as formed under the foregoing reaction conditions can be taken out by, for example/ the following isolation operation. That is, after completion of the reaction/ the reaction mixture or a residue obtained by distilling off the acetic acid from the reaction mixture and an alkaline agent (for example, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and ammonia) in an excessive amount against the acetic acid contained therein are dissolved in water and mixed, whereby a crude desired material can be precipitated. This crude material can be purified by a recrystallization operation or the like.<br>
The phenylnaphthylimidazole compound may be dissolved in a suitable carrier, such as water or an organic solvent, to form the surface treating agent.<br>
The phenylnaphthylimidazole compound may be contained, for example, in a proportion of from 0.01 to 10 % by weight, and preferably from 0.1 to 5 % by weight in the surface treating agent. When the content of the imidazole compound is less than 0.01 % by weight, the film thickness of the chemical layer as formed on the surface of copper may be too thin so that the oxidation of the surface of copper cannot be prevented. On the other hand, when it exceeds 10 % by weight, the imidazole compound in the surface treating agent may leave without being<br>
dissolved so that a uniform aqueous solution cannot be formed.<br>
In dissolving the imidazole compound in water (forming an aqueous solution) , an organic acid or an inorganic acid may be used as the acid, but a small amount of an organic solvent may be used simultaneously. Representative examples of the organic acid to be used include formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, glyoxylic acid, pyruvic acic, acetoacetic acid, levulinic acid, heptanoic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, glycolic acid, glyceric acid, lactic acid, acrylic acid, methoxyacetic acid, ethoxyacetic acid, propoxyacetic acid, butoxyacetic acid, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid,<br>
2-[2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid, 2-{2-[2-(2-eth-oxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}acetic acid, methoxypropionic acid, ethoxypropionic acid, propoxypropionic acid, butoxypropionic acid, benzoic acid, p-nitrobenzoic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, picric acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, and adipic acid; and examples of the inorganic acid include hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid.<br>
Such an acid may be added in a proportion of from 0.1 to 50 % by weight, and preferably from 1 to 30 % by weight based on the aqueous solution.<br>
Also, examples of the organic solvent include lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, or<br>
acetone, N,N-dimethylformamide, and ethylene glycol and the like, which are freely miscible mixed with water.<br>
To the surface treating agent of the invention, a metal salt may be added. In the case where a copper compound is used as the metal salt, it may be possible to hasten the formation rate of the chemical layer on the surface of copper or a copper alloy. Also, in the case where a zinc compound is used as the metal salt, it may be possible to further enhance the heat resistance of the chemical layer.<br>
Representative examples of the copper compound include copper acetate, cuprous chloride, cupric chloride, cuprous bromide, cupric bromide, copper iodide, copper hydroxide, copper phosphate, copper sulfate, and copper nitrate; and representative examples of the zinc compound include zinc oxide, zinc formate, zinc acetate, zinc oxalate, zinc lactate, zinc citrate, zinc sulfate, zinc nitrate, and zinc phosphate. These metal salts may be used singly or in combinations of two or more kinds thereof.  The metal salt may be added in a proportion of from 0.01 to 10 % by weight, and preferably from 0.02 to 5 % by weight in the surface treating agent.<br>
In the case where such a copper compound or zinc compound is used, it may be desirable to stabilize the pH of the solution by adding a substance having a buffer action, such as ammonia, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine in addition to the organic acid or inorganic<br>
acid.<br>
For the purpose of further enhancing the formation rate of the chemical layer and the heat resistance of the film, a halogen compound may be added in the surface treating agent according to the invention. Examples of the halogen compound include sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, ammonium fluoride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, ammonium bromide, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, and ammonium iodide. These halogen compounds may be used singly or in combinations of two or more kinds thereof. The halogen compound may be added in a proportion of from 0.001 to 1 % by weight, and preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 % by weight in the surface treating agent.<br>
With respect to the conditions for treating the surface of copper or a copper alloy using the surface treating agent according to the invention, the liquid temperature of the<br>
surface treating agent may be, for example, from 10 to 70 °C, and the contact time may be, for example, from 1 second to 10 minutes. Examples of the contact method include dipping, spraying, and coating methods.<br>
Also, after performing the surface treatment according to the invention, it is possible to further enhance the heat resistance by forming a double structure on the chemical layer with a thermoplastic resin.<br>
That is, after forming the chemical layer on the surface<br>
of copper or a copper alloy, a double structure of the chemical layer and a thermoplastic resin may be formed by dissolving a thermoplastic resin having excellent heat resistance, which may be composed, for example, of a rosin derivative (for example, rosin and rosin esters), a terpene resin derivative (for example, terpene resins and terpene phenol resins), a hydrocarbon resin (for example, aromatic hydrocarbon resins and aliphatic hydrocarbon resins), or a mixture thereof, in a solvent (for example, toluene, ethyl acetate, and isopropyl alcohol) and uniformly coating the solution in a thickness of,<br>
for example, from 1 to 30 ^m on the chemical layer using, for example, a roll coater or the like.<br>
Examples of the solder which is suitable for carrying out the invention include not only generally used tin-lead alloy eutectic solders but also lead-free solders such Sn-Ag-Cu based, Sn-Ag-Bi based, Sn-Bi based, Sn-Ag-Bi-In based, Sn-Zn based, and Sn-Cu based solders.<br>
Also, the soldering method of the invention can be adapted to the flow soldering method and reflow soldering method.<br>
Flow soldering comprises moving a printed wiring board over a molten liquid-state solder in a solder bath for soldering junctions between electronic parts and the printed wiring board.<br>
In contrast, reflow soldering comprises printing in<br>
advance a paste cream solder on the printed wiring board according to a circuit pattern, mounting electronic parts thereon, and heating the whole printed wiring board to melt the solder to complete the soldering.<br>

Examples of the surface treating agent using the phenylnaphthylimidazole compound, the surface treatment method, the soldering method and the printed wiring board according to the invention will be specifically described below with reference to Examples 9 to 22 and Comparative Examples 1 to 7, but it should not be construed that the invention is limited thereto. Incidentally, the soldering test is as follows.<br>
(Evaluation test for solder flow-up rate properties)<br>
A printed wiring board made of a glass epoxy resin of<br>
120mm (length) x 150mm (width) x 1.6mm (thickness) and having 300 copper through-holes having an inner diameter of 0.80 mm was used as a test piece.  This test piece was degreased, subjected to soft etching, and then washed with water. Thereafter, the test piece was dipped in a surface treating agent kept at a prescribed liquid temperature for a prescribed period of time, washed with water, and then dried to form a chemical layer having a thickness of from about 0.10 to 0.50<br>
Hm on the copper surface.<br>
The surface-treated test piece was subjected to three<br>
cycles of reflow-heating in which the peak temperature was 240°C using an infrared reflow oven (trade name: MULTI-PRO-306, manufactured by Vetronix Co., Ltd.) and subsequently soldering was performed with a flow soldering device (conveyor speed: 1.0 m/min).<br>
The solder used was a tin-lead eutectic solder with a composition of 63% tin and 37% lead (% by weight) (trade name: H63A, manufactured by Senju Metal Industry Co ., Ltd.) , and the flux used for soldering was JS-64MSS (manufactured by Koki Co., Ltd.).  The soldering temperature was 240°C.<br>
Test piece surface treated as above were also soldered using lead-free solder in the same manner as for the tin-lead eutectic solder. The solder used was lead-free solder (trade name: H705 "ECOSOLDER", manufactured by Senju Metal Industry Co., Ltd.) with a composition of 96.5% tin, 3.0% silver and 0.5% copper (% by weight) , and the flux used for soldering was JS-E-09 (manufactured by Koki Co., Ltd.). The reflow-heating peak temperature was 245°C/ and the soldering temperature was also 245°C.<br>
For the soldered test piece, the measured result was indicated by the proportion (%) of the number of copper through-holes in which the solder was filled up to the copper land of the copper through-holes with respect to the total number of copper through-holes (300 holes).<br>
When the solder wettability on the copper surface is large, the molten solder penetrates inside each copper through-hole, whereby the molten solder readily fills it to the upper land of the through-hole. More specifically, if the number of through-holes whose upper lands were soldered was<br>
large, solder wettability and solderability to the copper would be judged to be excellent.<br>
(Evaluation test for solder spreadability)<br>
A printed wiring board made of a glass epoxy resin of 50 mm (length) x 50 mm (width) x 1.2 mm (thickness) was used as a test piece. This printed wiring board had a circuit pattern in which 10 pieces of a copper-foiled circuit with a conductor width of 0.80 mm and a length of 20 mm were formed in a width direction at intervals of 1.0 mm. The test piece was degreased, subjected to soft etching, and then washed with water. Thereafter, the test piece was dipped in a surface treating agent kept at a prescribed liquid temperature for a prescribed period of time, washed with water, and then dried to form a chemical conversion film having a thickness of from about 0.10 to 0.50 pm on the copper surface.<br>
The surface-treated test piece was subjected to one cycle of reflow-heating in which the peak temperature was 240 °C using an infrared ref low oven (trade name: MULTI-PRO-306, manufactured by Vetronix Co., Ltd.). Thereafter, a tin-lead solder paste was printed on the center of the copper circuits using a metal mask of 1.2 mm aperture diameter and 150 mm thickness, and reflow-heating was conducted at the above-described conditions for soldering.  The tin-lead solder paste used was an eutectic solder (trade name:<br>
OZ-63-330F-40-10, manufactured by Senju Metal Industry Co., Ltd.) composed of 63% tin and 37% lead (% by weight).<br>
Test pieces surface treated as above were also soldered using lead-free solder paste in the same manner for the tin-lead solder paste. The lead-free solder used was composed of 96.5% tin, 3.0% silver and 0.5% copper (% by weight) (trade name: M705-221BM5-42-11, manufactured by Senju Metal Industry Co., Ltd.). The peak temperature of reflow-heating attained before and after the solder paste printing was set to 245°C.<br>
The length (mm) of solder which wet and spread over the copper circuit of the obtained test piece was measured.<br>
When the length was longer, solder wettability and solderability would be judged to be excellent.<br>

Next, a test piece of a printed wiring board was dipped in the surface treating agent as controlled at a temperature of 40 °C for 240 seconds, washed with water, and then dried, thereby measuring the solder flow-up rate properties and<br>
solder spreadability. These test results are shown in Table 1.<br>

With respect to the resulting test pieces, the solder flow-up rate properties and solder spreadability were measured. These test results are shown in Table 1.<br>
