				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an automatic device for storage and retrieval of the material for use in a highrise, storage rack/structure.<br>
Until a few years back storing of materials used to be stacked either on the floor or in low height racks, and high rise fork lifts used in handling the materials in such racks. Due to the limitations of manually operated systems, the height of the racks were restricted, thus limiting the storage volume in a given floor space involving high expenditure. Operation of forklifts beyond a height of 5.5 meters is net practical as it involves stress on the operator in positioning and aligning at every cycle of operation, and is critical from the safety point of view.   Thus high desity,<br>
high rise storage was not feasible. The manually operated fork lift also need a person to be continuously exposed in a less ilium inated, polluted and noisy environment. The safety in the operation of manually operated fork lifts left much scope for improvement. Over and above, every transaction in a manually operated stores need updation of the records, which is laborious, erroneous and time consuming. Chances of misplacement of items, pilferage and damage due to manual handling were prevalent. Non availability of correct and upto date records, misplacement and human error in operations add upto poor efficienty of operation and higher cost.<br>
In the last few years,the  stores have been modernised by the use of high rise racks going upto 12 Meters in height and doing the handling operations by  a manually operated high rise stack er crane. This has helped the industries in storing more materials on the same floor area by effective utilisation of vertical space. However, other problems associated with a manually operated system remained the same. With the introduction of high rise stacker cranes safety needs of the human operator became more critical. Manual record keeping becomes a bottleneck in high frequency operation.<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose an improved construction of an automated storage and retrieval system wherein a large quantity of variety of material can be easily stored and retrieved.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an automated storage  and retrieval system having inventory management and cont rol.<br>
4<br>
Yet another object of the present i nvent ion is to propose an automated storage and retrieval system which provides a reliable and immediate delivery.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose an automated storage and retrieval system wherein there is a better floor space utilization.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose an automated storage and retrieval system v/herein there is design flexibility to accommodate wide range of loads.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to propose an automated storage and retrieval system, which has the ability to operate in adverse conditions<br>
Yet a further object of the present invention is to propose an automated storage and retrieval system wherein there is an accurate inventory and load location.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
At the outset of the description which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment, and without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and teaching of the invention and not intended to be taken restrictively<br>
According to this invention there is provided an automatic device for storage and retrieval of the material for use in a highrise storage rack/structure comprising a computer based control means, a slacker crane with programmable control logic  means to operate a single column stacker crane, an interface for inter connecting said PLC and computer control means, warning means comprising a Bar Code Scanner for reading the bar code fixed on the bin disposed in said storage racks is directly interfaced with said computer means for reading and verifying the bins<br>
The nature of the present invention, its objectives and advantages will be farther apparent from the following disclosure made with reference to the accompanying figures wherein<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic of a high - rise rack (1) and stacker crane.(2);<br>
Fig. 2 shows the detail of the stacker crane. Such as motors (8) for movement/ load (7)/ carriage (3) mast (6)/ top guiderail (5) and Bottom guiderail (9).<br>
Fig. 3 shows different views of a rack in an AS/RS<br>
Fig. 4 shows elements involved in a retrieval operation with PC ( 11) and scanner (10).<br>
Fig. 5 - shows elements involved in a storing operation PLC ( 12),control switch (13).<br>
Automatated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) use the  concepts of high rise' high density storage (1) of items with a computer (11) controlled stacker crane (2) handling the items. The computer (11) is also capable of real time inventory management.<br>
The material is stored in standard size Bins (14),crates or Pallets/ which are stacked into the high rise racks (1)/with multiple levels. The length of the racks (1) can be as high as 100 - 150 Meters and the height can be anywhere in the range of 8 to 15 Meters depending upon the availability of space/ the types of materials to be handled and the number of Bins etc. to be stored.<br>
AS/RS have aisles that divide the storage racks. In each aisle is a stacker crane (2) which picks up the load from the pick up station and stores it at a computer assigned location / and delivers any Bin (14) at the delivery station under the commands of the system controller.<br>
The computer (11) keeps track of the materials being<br>
handled and can be programmed to give a warning for stock replenishment when the quantity of any item falls below a predefined level.<br>
Due to computerisation of the crane operation and on-line real time handling of information it is possible to have a better inventory management system. The system offers preparati on of stock reports, queries regarding availability of any item, prior warning for stock replenishment etc. By simple interat ion at the system controller all necessary information can be obtained very quickly.<br>
As the crane (2) is controlled from the system controller (11,4) directly without any human intervention, it is ensured to deliver; the right item at the delivery counter without any delay. In cases of non - availability of any item,'the system gives an immediate message indicating the status. By this means a lot of waiting and search time associated with any manually operated stores, is saved.<br>
There is a better space utilisation, as the vertical space is utilised most effectively in an AS/RS.  Large volume and variety of material  can be stored over a significantly small floor area.<br>
As the entire stocking area is cordoned off and only automated crane operation is allowed in the racks, the chances of pilferage as  well as misplacement of items are m inimised. As any item stored in the system can be easily traced from the memory of the computer (11), it is highly unlikely to permanently misplace any item.<br>
The tracks (9,5) are modular in nature, allowing easy<br>
to be handled. Usually the width and depth of the .racks are to be prefixed before erection/ as these are to be grouted on the floor. However/ the height of each pocket can still be altered by re-positioning the platform bases along the columns. By this way/ a mix of different heights of Bins (14) can also be handled in different segments of the rack system.<br>
An AS/RS can be divided into four major elements, stacker crane (2) , storage structures (1,conveying devices (14) and system controller (4/ 11). Stacker Crane (2):<br>
It is the basic element of the system. It is made to function accurately and safely at higher speeds/ reachina heights beyond 20 feet and operating in aisles only  inches wider than the load it carries. Since it has to be automated/ it can also be operated by remote control. The modern stacker crane runs on a floor mounted rail (9) and is guided at the<br>
top (5). It com es in a wide variety of sizes and configura-<br>
(7) tions because its design is a function of the load/it carries<br>
and the task it performs. Speed is generally determined by the system's throughput requirements (i.e. how many loads need to be stored and retrieved in an hour). Travelling speeds vary from 2-75 meters/min while hoisting speeds vary from 2-7 meters/min. For travelling and hoisting three phase AC motors  (8) are used. For travelling at high speeds, motors (8) in the range of 1.5 - 2.5 HP are used and for<br>
travelling at low speeds motors of 0.5 - 1 Hp are used. For hoisting purposes two speed motors (8) of 7.5 - 10 HP are used. The payload of the m achine is to be decided as per the requirement of the user. It may be in the range of 5 00 - 2000 Kgs.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a typical dual  masted heavy duty storage / retrieval machine. It travels along a floor -mounted guide rail (9) by means of power driven wheels/ and is also supported by top guide rails (5). The table (7) on the carriage (3) is capable of loading and unloading parts or pallets in both directions and accessing any stack in the warehouse. It has a positioning system anc powered drive system in the following three axes: horizontal movement of the shuttle table (4)/ vertical movement of the carriage and movement of the stacker crane along the guide rai1 (9,5).<br>
Storage Devices (1):<br>
anes<br>
In AS/RS material is stored in racks (1) which differ from conventional racking. These storage racks are normally much higher and interface directly with the stacker cr (2). AS/RS racking system must provide for the integration of stacker crane guide rails and fire protection systems.<br>
The  most   common   storage   structures   (1)   are   free standing   and   are   installed   inside  a  building.   Figure  3 i1lustrates   a   set   of   racks   showing  three v iews• Specifications   differ     depending   on  type  of   load   to   be stored  and  system  configuration.<br>
Presently an   increasing  number of  systems  are  rack supported,   that   is,   the  rack  storage   structure  supports the building   itself.   This   type  of   system   can  be   upto 30   meters  tall   and  is  popular because   it   saves   construction time  and   cost   of  more  than   20%.<br>
The   materials   are kept   in  bins{14)   which   must  be of<br>
a   standard   size   for  an   AS/RS.   The  Bins   (14)   are  kept   on<br>
the   platforms   supported     by  the  columns   of the   system.<br>
The   columns   of   racks' are made  of   cold rolled   steel. The  columns   are   louvred  to  give  additional   strength<br>
to   the   racks.   Also   due   to   louvring   the   platform   of  the  bins<br>
Conveying  Devices:<br>
These   are   devices  which   transport   loads beyond   the<br>
limits  of   the   stacker   cranes.   Some   systems  need   a   few conveyors,   while   others   require   elaborate  conveying   devices;<br>
connecting   the   S/R   system  wi th   other   plant   operat ions . Among   the   conveying   devices ,   there  are  fork   lifts,   roller or  chain   conveyors,   guided  vechicles,   robots,   overhead power  and   free conveyers,   in   floor  tow   lines or  shuttle t rolleys.<br>
T he  AGV   (automated   guide vehicle)   is also  used   in   some<br>
part   of  the  work.   The   AGV   transports  goods,   that   is  tool<br>
s<br>
can  be  shifted   to   any desirable  height   of   the   rack.<br>
or assembly parts,from one part to another and is guided by mini computers- When the AGV is instructed; to bring a certaa in object from the AS/RS, it would go and wait near the delivery counter of the AS/RS till the object is loaded on it. After that it brings the required object to the required place as guided by the computers. By integration of the AGV Route controller with the AS/RS controller, one can achieve a cO-ordinated material handling and movement in the entire shop - floor automatically. This is one of<br>
the applications of the AGV in a manufacturing unit. Controllers ( 11,4):<br>
The AS/RS controllers bring everything (equipment and information) together to enable proper system function. An i ncreasing number of S/R systems are computer controlled. Each S/R machine has its own on-board microprocessor / PLC which provides the automation for the individual machine. The conveyors are controlled by a sim ilar processor. All these processors communicate with an equipment controller ( (also a small computer ) which runs the over all system by remote control.<br>

SOFTWARE:<br>
PLC   Software:   The   PLC   controls   the  movements   of   the   crane and  the   fork   for  any  storage   and   retrieval  operation.   It interacts   with  various  sensors  mounted on the   crane   for<br>
registering the position of the crane/ the vertical carriage/ and the fork. It is interfaced with the System controller for taking the inputs regarding the destination/ the type of operation (store/retrieve) to be carried out and the  side of the rack (left/right) to be approached.<br>
The PLC software is written  in SIMATIC-S5 language suitable for SIEMENS PLCs. The program is written by using different Program Block (PBs) for faster execution. It also allows calling of d ifferent PBs for different cycles of operation. There is a separate PB for the main travel/ and one each for the retrieve and the store cycles.<br>
All the outputs required to define the destination column number/ row number/ store/retrieve command/ and the side of rack (right/left) must be i ssued from the  PC based system controller in a proper sequence. The crane will be moved only after receiving all of these inputs at 24 VDC level and followed by a GO AHEAD pulse also at 24 VDC level. A remote hardware emergency switch is provided near the system controller for stopping the crane in case of<br>
€<br>
any malfunction.<br>
A   separate   PB   is  written   for   initialisation   and   re-definit ion   of  the   crane   posit ion/   which  may  be   used   in case  of   intermediate manual   operation   of the   crane.   This<br>
c<br>
can be activated from a remote pendant by a combination of Input switches.<br>
Retentive   flags   are used  for  memorising   the destination   and  other   essential   commands   in   the   battery supported  RAM  area   in   cases of   power   failure.   The operation   of  the   crane   for   the   same   function   as   it was. doing   before  power   failure   can     be   easily  resumed by resetting   the PLC   Controller.<br>
System control software:<br>
The system control software is resident on the PC/AT/ which is configured as the system controller. It is written in QBASIC language using modular concept. The program is interactive in nature and the operator can store or retrieve any Bin by only keying in the Bin number from the keyboard.<br>
The operator faces a screen with different options indicated for storing/retrieving/displaying the status of racks etc. A separate option is offered for defining the initial locations of the Bins. This is useful for initial definition as well as indicating the positions of<br>
Bins after any intermediate manual operation of the crane.<br>
The display rack status option shows the locations of all the Bins  in the racks in a graphical matrix form.<br>
The software autom atically updates the contents of the location table after every successful store or  retrieve operation.<br>
OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM:<br>
The AS/RS commissioned at Corp., R &amp; D is designed for operation in three different modes -<br>
Fully automatic mode from the system controller<br>
Semi automatic mode from a Pendant<br>
Manual mode with operator in the cabin<br>
Automatic tracking of material and inventory control is possible only in mode 1. The other two modes are  provided for operation during m aintenance and in case of a system failure from the PC side.<br>
In mode 1/ the system control software guides the operator through an interactive menu appearing on the screen of the pc based system controller. The first screen has r five options as printed on the next page. By selecting the appropriate option/ one can do the following functions   :<br>
Option 1:<br>
One can define the initial locations of various Bins, once for all during commissioning or in case of any intermediate manual operation of the crane.<br>
Option 2;<br>
One  can   retrieve any  Bin/Pallet   available   in   the   system.<br>
Option   3;<br>
One  can   store  any Bin/Pallet   in   the   system.<br>
Option  4:<br>
One   can   see   the   status  of  the   racks   i n  graphical presentation.<br>
Option  5:<br>
Used for closing all files and coming out of the control<br>
software.<br>
For retrieving a Bin/Pallet/ one has to select option<br>
2 for the first  menu and then enter the Bin number against<br>
the next prompting from the system controller. The<br>
controller searches through its database and locates the position of the Bin in the racks. It then instructs the PLC<br>
to drive the crane to the correct pocket and withdraw the<br>
B in. If the Bin is not available in the racks, an warning<br>
is given to the operator on the screen as well as with an <br>
audio signal. After withdrawing the Bin/ a Bar code fixed<br>
on the Bin is read by a Bar code (14) scanner (10) mounted on the crane. If the Bar code matches the Bin is delivered at the load/unload counter. If the Bar code does not match/ the system prompts the operator to give his choice of either keeping the Bin  back at the same location/ with the proper Bin number read from the Bar code or delivering it at the counter. In case the Bar code is not readable or not present/ the system asks for decision regarding next operation from the operator. Once the Bin is delivered, the system automatically updates its data base regarding the locations of all the Bins.<br>
For storing a Bin in the system/ one has to only select the storing option. The system checks for the availability of the Bin at the loading/ unloading counter. If the Bin is present, it is loaded on the crane and the Bar code sticker is scanned to obtain the Bin number and the destination for the Bin. If the data is valid and the destination is  empty, the crane is driven by the PLC to deposit the Bin there. The data base is automatically updated thereafter.  In case of an invalid bar code or the destination being occupied, the Bin is unloaded after giving an warning message and a hooter signal.<br><br><br>
