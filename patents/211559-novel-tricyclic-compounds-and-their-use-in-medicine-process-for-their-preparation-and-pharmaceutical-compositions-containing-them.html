The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above said novel compounds, their derivatives, their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their slcrcojsomcrs, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, novel intermediates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) arc useful for the treatment and / or prophylaxis of insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes), impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, disorders related to Syndrome X such as hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, hypcrlipidemia, coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders. The compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of certain renal diseases including glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis. These compounds may also be useful as aldose reductase inhibitors, for improving cognitive functions in dementia, treating diabetic complications, psoriasis, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and osteoporosis.<br><br>
Background of Invention<br>
Hyperlipidemia is the primary cause for cardiovascular (CVD) and other peripheral vascular diseases. High risk of CVD is related to the higher LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) and VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein) seen in hyperlipidemia. Patients having glucose intolerance / insulin resistance in addition to hyperlipidemia have higher risk of CVD. Numerous studies in the past have shown that lowering of plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol, in particular LDL and VLDL and increasing HDL cholesterol help in preventing cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Diabetes is a disease, which severely affects the quality of life of a large population. Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect; failing which, the plasma glucose concentration inevitably rises resulting in frank diabetes. Among developed countries, diabetes mcllitus is a common problem and is associated with a variety of abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (J. Clin. Invest., (1985) 75 : 809 - 817; N. Engl. J. Med. (1987) 317 : 350 - 357 ; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., (1988) 66 : 580 - 583; J. Clin. Invest., (1975) 68 : 957 - 969) and renal complications (Sec Patent Application No, WO 95/21608). It is increasingly being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulinemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mcllitus. The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has been described as a syndrome having insulin resistance as the central-pathogenic link-Syndrome-X.<br>
Thus, therapeutic agents which improve insulin resistance, lower plasma trigyceride, total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL and increase HDL will have great significance in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and improving quality of life.<br>
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) are members of the nuclear receptor super family. The gamma (y) isoform of PPAR (PPARy) has been implicated in regulating differentiation of adipocytes (Endocrinology, (1994) 135: 798-800) and energy homeostasis (Cell, (1995) 83: 803-812), whereas the alpha (a) isoform of PPAR (PPARa) mediates fatty acid oxidation (Trend. Endocrin. Metab-, (1993) 4 : 291-296) thereby resulting in reduction of circulating free fatty acid in plasma (Current Biol. (1995) 5: 618 -621). PPARa agonists have been found useful for the treatment of obesity (WO 97/36579). It has been recently disclosed that<br><br>
there exists synergism for the molecules, which are agonists for both PPARa and PPARy and suggested to be useful for the treatment of syndrome X (WO 97/25042). Similar synergism between the insulin sensitizer (PPARy agonist) and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor has been ' observed which may be useful for the treatment of atherosclerosis and xanthoma. (EP 0 753 298).<br>
A few P-aryl-oc-hydroxy propionic acids and their derivatives, their analogs have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia. Some of such compounds described in the prior art are outliped below :<br>
i)	U.S.  Pat.   5,306,726;  WO91/19702  disclose  several  3-aryl-2-hydroxypppionic  acid<br>
derivatives of general formula (Ha) and (lib) as hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic agents.<br><br><br>
wherein Ra represents 2- benzoxazolyl or 2-pyridyI and Rb represent CF3 or CH2OCH3 or CH3.<br>
A typical example is (iS)-3-[4-[2-[N-(2-bcnzoxazolyI]N-methylamino]cthoxy]phenyl]-2-(2,2,2-trifIuoroethoxy)propanoic acid (II f).<br><br>

The compound of the formula (I) as defined above are clinically administered to<br>
mammals, including man, via either oral or parenteral routes. Administration by the oral route<br>
is preferred, being more convenient and avoiding the possible pain and irritation of injection.<br>
However, in circumstances where the patient cannot swallow the medication, or absorption<br>
following oral administration is impaired, as by disease or other abnormality, it is essential that<br>
the drug be administered parenterally. By cither route, the dosage is in the range of about 0.01 to<br>
about 100 mg / kg body weight of the subject per day or preferably about 0.01 to about 30 mg /<br>
kg body weight per day administered singly or as a divided dose. However, the optimum dosage<br>
for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for<br>
treatment, generally smaller doses being administered initially and thereafter increments made to<br>
determine the most suitable dosage.	;/<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous or organic solutions. The active compound will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in the amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage in the range as described above. Thus, for oral administration, the compounds can be combined with a suitable solid or liquid carrier or diluent to form capsules, tablets, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions, may, if desired, contain additional components such as flavourants, sweeteners, excipients ,and the like. For parenteral administration, the compounds can be combined with sterile aqueous or organic media to form injectable solutions or suspensions. For example, solutions in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and the like can be used, as well as aqueous solutions of water-soluble pharmaceutically-^cccptable acid addition salts or salts with base of the compounds. The injectable solutions prepared in this manner can then be administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcijtaneously, or intramuscularly, with intramuscular administration being preferred in humans.<br>

Demonstration of Efficacy of Compounds :<br>
A)       In vitro :<br>
a)        Determination of hPPARa activity :<br>
Ligand binding domain of hPPARa was fused to DNA binding domain of Yeast transcription factor GAL4 in eucaryolic expression vector. Using superfect (Qiagen, Germany) as transfecting reagent HEK-293 cells were transfected with this plasmid and a reporter plasmid harboring the luciferase gene driven by a GAL4 specific promoter. Compound was added at different concentrations after 42 hrs of transaction and incubated overnight. Luciferase activity as a function of compound binding/activation capacity of PPARa was measured using Packard Luclite kit (Packard, USA) in Top Count (Ivan Sadowski, Brendan Bell, Peter Broag and Melvyn Mollis. Gene. 1992. 118 ; 137 —141; Superfect Transfection Reagent Handbook. February, 1997. Qiagen, Germany).<br><br>

(Packard, USA) in Packard Top Count (Ivan Sadowski, Brendan Bell, Peter Broag and Melvyn<br>
Hollis. Gene. 1992. 118 : 137 -141; Guide to Eukaryotic Transfcctions with Caiionic Lipid<br>
Reagents. Life Technologies, GIBCO BRL, USA).	'C<br><br>
c)	Determination of HMG CoA reductase inhibition activity : Liver microsome bound<br>
reductase was prepared from 2% cholestyramine fed rats at mid-dark cycle. Spectrophotometry<br>
assays were carried out in 100 mM KH2P04, 4 mM DTT, 0.2 mM NADPH, 03 mM HMG CoA<br>
and 125 |ig of liver microsomal enzyme. Total reaction mixture volume was kept as 1 ml.<br>
Reaction was started by addition of HMG CoA. Reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30<br>
min and decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded. Reaction mixture without substrate was<br>
used as blank (Goldstein, J. L and Brown, M. S. Progress in understanding the LDL j-eceptor and<br>
HMG CoA reductase, two membrane proteins that regulate the plasma cholesterol J. Lipid Res.<br>
1984, 25: 1450 - 1461). The test compounds inhibited the HMG CoA reductase enzyme.<br>
B)       In vivo :<br>
a)        Efficacy in genetic models :	;<br>
Mutation in colonies of laboratory animals and different sensitivities to dietary regimens have made the, development of animal models with non-insulin dependent diabetes and hypcrlipidemia associated with obesity and insulin resistance possible. Genetic models such as db/db and ob/ob (Diabetes, (1982) 31(1) : 1- 6) mice and zucker fa/fa rats have been developed by the various laboratories for understanding the pathophysiology of disease and testing the efficacy of new  antidiabetic compounds (Diabetes, (1983) 32: 830-838 ; Annu.   Rep. Sankyo<br><br>
Res. Lab. (1994). 46 : 1-57), The homozygous animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed by Jackson Laboratory, US, are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant (J. Clin. Invest., (1990) 85 : 962-967), whereas heterozygous are lean and normoglycemic. In db/db model, mouse progressively develops insulinopenia with age, a feature commonly observed in late stages of human type II diabetes when blood sugar levels are insufficiently controlled. The state of pancreas and its course vary according to the models. Since this model resembles that of type II diabetes mellitus, the compounds of the present invention were tested for blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities.<br>
■ Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice of 8 to 14 weeks age, having body weight range of 35 to 60 grams, bred at Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation (DRF) animal house, were used in the experiment. The mice were provided with standard feed (National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India) and acidified water, ad libitum. The animals having more than 350 mg / dl blood sugar were used for testing. The number of animals in each group was 4.<br>
Test compounds were suspended on 0.25 % carboxymcthyl cellulose and administered to test group at a dose of 0.1 mg to 30 mg / kg through oral gavage daily for 6 days. The control group received vehicle (dose 10 ml / kg). On 6th day the blood samples were collected one hour after administration of test compounds / vehicle for assessing the biological activity.<br>
The random blood sugar and triglyceride levels were measured by collecting blood (100 j.il) through orbital sinus, using heparinised capillary in tubes containing EDTA which was ccntrifuged to obtain plasma. The plasma glucose and triglyceride levels were measured spcclrometrically, by glucose oxidase and glycerol-3-P04 oxidase/peroxidase vpnzyme (Dr. Reddy's Lab. Diagnostic Division Kits, Hyderabad, India) methods respectively.<br>
The blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities of the test compound was calculated according to the formula.<br>
No adverse effects were observed for any of the mentioned compounds of invention in the above test.<br><br>
The ob/ob mice were obtained at 5 weeks of age from Bomholtgard, Demark and were<br>
used at 8 weeks of age. Zucker fa/fa fatty rats were obtained from IffaCredo, France at 10 weeks<br>
I<br><br>
of age and were used at 13 weeks of age. The animals were maintained under 1J[ hour light and dark cycle at 25 + 1 °C. Animals were given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water, ad libitum (Fujiwara, I\, Yoshioka, S., Yoshioka, T., Ushiyama, I and Horikoshi, H. Characterization of new oral antidiabetic agent CS-045. Studies in KK and ob/ab mice and Zucker fatty rats. Diabetes. 1988. 37 : 1549 - 1558).<br>
The test compounds were administered at 0.1 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 9 days. The control animals received the vehicle (0.25 % cnrboxymethylcellulose, dose 10 ml/jcg) through oral gavage.<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 9 day of treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifugation, plasma sample was separated for triglyceride, glucose, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and insulin estimations. Measurement of plasma triglyceride, glucose, total cholesterol were done using commercial kits (Dr. Rcddy's Laboratory, Diagnostic Division, India). The plasma free fatty acid was measured using a commercial kit form Boehringer Mannheim, Germany. The plasma insulin was measured using a RIA kit (BARC, India). The reduction of various parameters examined are calculated according to the formula.<br>
In ob/ob mice oral glucose tolerance test was performed after 9 days treatment. Mice were fasted for 5 hrs and challenged with 3 gm/kg of glucose orally. The blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min for estimation of plasma glucose levels.<br>
• The experimental results from the db/db mice, ob/ob mice, Zucker fa/fa rats suggest that the novel compounds of the present invention also possess therapeutic utility as a prophylactic or regular treatment for diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and other diseases; as it is known from the literature that such diseases are interrelated to each other.<br>
Blood glucose level and triglycerides are also lowered at doses greater than 10 mg/kg. Normally, the quantum of reduction is dose dependent and plateaus at certain dose.<br>
b)	Cholesterol lowering activity in hypcrcholcsterolemic rat models :<br><br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (MIN stock) were bred in DRF animal house. Animals were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25 ± 1 °C. Rats of 180 - 200 gram body weight range were used for the experiment. Animals were made hypercholesterolcmic by feeding 2% cholesterol and 1% sodium cholalc mixed with standard laboratory chow [National Inslitute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India] for 6 days. Throughout the experimental period the animals were maintained on the same diet (Petit* D., Bonncfls, M, T., Rcy, C and Infante, R. Effects of ciprofibralc on liver lipids and lipoprotein synthesis in normo- and hypcrlipidcmic rats. Atherosclerosis. 1988. 74 : 215-225).<br>
The test compounds were administered orally at a dose OJ to 30 mg/kg/d^y for 3 days. Control group was treated with vehicle alone (0.25 % CarboxymclhylcelluIo#c; dosq 10 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 3 day of compound treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifugation, plasma sample was separated for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride estimations. Measurement of plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL were done using commercial kits (Dr. Reddy's Laboratory, Diagnostic Division, India). LDL and VLDL cholesterol were calculated from the data obtained for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride. The reduction of various parameters examined are calculated according to the formula.<br>
c)	Plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol lowering activity in Swiss albino mice and<br>
Guinea pigs :<br>
Male Swiss albino mice (SAM) and male Guinea pigs were obtained from NIN and housed in DRF animal house. All these animals were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25 ± 1 °C. Animals were given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water, ad libitum. SAM of 20 - 25 g body weight range and Guinea pigs of 500 - 700 g body weight range were used (Oliver, P., Planckc, M. O., Marzin, D., Clavey, V., Sauzicres, J and Fruchart, J* C. Effects of fenofibrate, gemfibrozil and nicotinic acid on plasma lipoprotein levels in normal and hyperlipidemic mice. Atherosclerosis. 1988. 70 : 107 - 114).<br>
The test compounds were administered orally to Swiss -albino mice at 0.3 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 6 days. Control mice were treated with vehicle (0.25% Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg). The test compounds were administered orally to<br>
/<br><br>
Guinea pigs at 0.3 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 6 days. Control animals were treated with vehicle (0.25% Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 5 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed slate 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 6 day of treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubea. After ccntrifugation, plasma sample was separated for triglyceride and total cholesterol (Wicland, O. Methods of Enzymatic analysis. Bergermeyer, H. O., Ed., 1963. 211 - 214; Trinder, P. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1969. 6 : 24 - 27). Measurement of plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL were done using commercial kits (Dr. Reddy's Diagnostic Division, Hyderabad, India).<br>
