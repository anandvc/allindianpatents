METHOD OF AN UPLINK HARQ OPERATION AT AN EXPIRY<br>
OF TIME ALIGNMENT TIMER<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to a radio (wireless) communication system providing a<br>
radio communication service and a mobile terminal, and more particularly, to a method<br>
of an uplink HARQ operation of the mobile terminal in an Evolved Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System (E-UMTS) or a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] Figure 1 shows an exemplary network structure of an Evolved Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System (E-UMTS) as a mobile communication system to which a<br>
related art and the present invention are applied. The E-UMTS system is a system that<br>
has evolved from the existing UMTS system, and its standardization work is currently<br>
being performed by the 3GPP standards organization. The E-UMTS system can also be<br>
referred to as a LTE (Long-Term Evolution) system.<br>
[3] The E-UMTS network can roughly be divided into an E-UTRAN and a Core<br>
Network (CN). The E-UTRAN generally comprises a terminal (Le., User Equipment<br>
(UE)), a base station (i.e., eNode B), an Access Gateway (AG) that is located at an end<br>
of the E-UMTS network and connects with one or more external networks. The AG<br>
may be divided into a part for processing user traffic and a part for handling control<br>
traffic. Here, an AG for processing new user traffic and an AG for processing control<br>
traffic can be communicated with each other by using a new interface. One eNode B<br>
may have one or more cells. An interface for transmitting the user traffic or the control<br>
traffic may be used among the eNode Bs. The CN may comprise an AG, nodes for user<br>
registration of other UEs, and the like. An interface may be used to distinguish the E-<br>
UTRAN and the CN from each other.<br>
[4] The various layers of the radio interface protocol between the mobile terminal and<br>
the network may be divided into a layer 1 (LI), a layer 2 (L2) and a layer 3 (L3), based<br>
upon the lower three layers of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) standard model<br>
that is well-known in the field of communications systems. Among these layers, Layer<br>
1 (LI), namely, the physical layer, provides an information transfer service to an upper<br>
layer by using a physical channel, while a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer located<br>
in the lowermost portion of the Layer 3 (L3) performs the function of controlling radio<br>
resources between the terminal and the network. To do so, the RRC layer exchanges<br>
RRC messages between the terminal and the network. The RRC layer may be located<br>
by being distributed in network nodes such as the eNode B, the AG, and the like, or<br>
may be located only in the eNode B or the AG.<br>
[5] Figure 2 shows exemplary control plane architecture of a radio interface protocol<br>
between a terminal and a UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network)<br>
according to the 3GPP radio access network standard. The radio interface protocol as<br>
shown in Fig. 2 is horizontally comprised of a physical layer, a data link layer, and a<br>
network layer, and vertically comprised of a user plane for transmitting user data and a<br>
control plane for transferring control signaling. The protocol layer in Fig. 2 may be<br>
divided into LI (Layer 1), L2 (Layer 2), and L3 (Layer 3) based upon the lower three<br>
layers of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) standards model that is widely known<br>
in the field of communication systems.<br>
[6] Hereinafter, particular layers of the radio protocol control plane of Fig. 2 and of the<br>
radio protocol user plane of Fig. 3 will be described below.<br>
[7] The physical layer (Layer 1) uses a physical channel to provide an information<br>
transfer service to a higher layer. The physical layer is connected with a medium<br>
access control (MAC) layer located thereabove via a transport channel, and data is<br>
transferred between the physical layer and the MAC layer via the transport channel.<br>
Also, between respectively different physical layers, namely, between the respective<br>
physical layers of the transmitting side (transmitter) and the receiving side (receiver),<br>
data is transferred via a physical channel.<br>
[8] The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of Layer 2 provides services to a radio<br>
link control (RLC) layer (which is a higher layer) via a logical channel. The RLC layer<br>
of Layer 2 supports the transmission of data with reliability. It should be noted that if<br>
the RLC functions are implemented in and performed by the MAC layer, the RLC<br>
layer itself may not need to exist The PDCP layer of Layer 2 performs a header com-<br>
pression function that reduces unnecessary control information such that data being<br>
transmitted by employing Internet Protocol (IP) packets, such as IPv4 or IPv6, can be<br>
efficiently sent over a radio interf ace that has a relatively small bandwidth.<br>
[9] The Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer located at the lowermost portion of Layer 3<br>
is only defined in the control plane, and handles the control of logical channels,<br>
transport channels, and physical channels with respect to the configuration, re-<br>
configuration and release of radio bearers (RB). Here, the RB refers to a service that is<br>
provided by Layer 2 for data transfer between the mobile terminal and the UTRAN.<br>
[10] As for channels used in downlink transmission for transmitting data from the<br>
network to the mobile terminal, there is a Broadcast Channel (BCH) used for<br>
transmitting system information, and a downlink Shared Channel (SCH) used for<br>
transmitting user traffic or control messages. A downlink multicast, traffic of broadcast<br>
service or control messages may be transmitted via the downlink SCH or via a separate<br>
downlink Multicast Channel (MCH). As for channels used in uplink transmission for<br>
transmitting data from the mobile terminal to the network, there is a Random Access<br>
Channel (RACH) used for transmitting an initial control message, and an uplink<br>
Shared Channel (SCH) used for transmitting user traffic or control messages.<br>
[11] As for downlink physical channels for transmitting information transferred via the<br>
channels used in downlink transmission over a radio interface between the network and<br>
the terminal, there is a Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) for transmitting BCH in-<br>
formation, a Physical Multicast Channel (PMCH) for transmitting MCH information, a<br>
Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) for transmitting PCH and a downlink<br>
SCH information, and a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) (also, referred<br>
to as 'DL L1/L2 control channel') for transmitting control information provided by the<br>
first and second layers such as a DL/UL Scheduling Grant, and the like. As for uplink<br>
physical channels for transmitting information transferred via the channels used in<br>
uplink transmission over a radio interface between the network and the terminal, there<br>
is a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) for transmitting uplink SCH in-<br>
formation, a Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) for transmitting RACH in-<br>
formation, and a Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) for transmitting control<br>
information provided by the first and second layers, such as a HARQ ACK or NACK,<br>
a Scheduling Request (SR), a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) report, and the like.<br>
[12] In LTE system, a HARQ operation is performed in a MAC (Medium Access Control)<br>
layer for an effective data transmission. The following is a detailed description of the<br>
HARQ operation.<br>
[13] Figure 4 is an exemplary view showing a HARQ operation method for an effective<br>
data transmission. As illustrated in Figure 4, a base station (or eNB) may transmit<br>
downlink scheduling information (referred as *DL scheduling information' hereafter)<br>
through a PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) in order to provide data to a<br>
terminal (UE) during a HARQ operation. The DL scheduling information may include<br>
a UE identifier (UE ID), a UE group identifier (Group ID), an allocated radio resource<br>
assignment, a duration of the allocated radio resource assignment, a transmission<br>
parameter (e.g., Modulation method, payload size, MIMO related information, etc),<br>
HARQ process information, a redundancy version, or a new data indicator (NID), etc.<br>
Usually, the terminal (UE) performs multiple HARQ processes, the multiple HARQ<br>
processes are operated synchronously. Namely, each HARQ process is allocated syn-<br>
chronously in every transmission time interval (TTI). For example, a HARQ process 1<br>
may perform in a first transmission time interval (TTI1), a HARQ process 2 may<br>
perform in TTI 2,..., a HARQ process 8 may perform in TTI 8, the HARQ process 1<br>
may again perform in TTI 9, and the HARQ process 2 may again perform in TTI 10,<br>
etc. Since the HARQ processes are allocated in synchronous manner, a certain HARQ<br>
process associated with a TTI which receives a PDCCH for initial transmission of a<br>
particular data may be used for such data transmission. For example, if the terminal<br>
receives a PDCCH including an uplink scheduling information in Nth TTI, the<br>
terminal may actually transmit a data in N+4 TO<br>
[14] The HARQ retransmission of the terminal is operated in a non-adaptive manner. That<br>
is, an initial transmission of a particular data is possible only when the terminal<br>
receives a PDCCH including an uplink scheduling information. However, the HARQ<br>
retransmission of the data can be possibly operated without receiving the PDCCH, as<br>
next TTI allocated to a corresponding HARQ process can be used with same uplink<br>
scheduling information. Here, transmission parameters may be transmitted through a<br>
control channel such as a PDCCH, and these parameters may be varied with a channel<br>
conditions or circumstances. For example, if a current channel condition is better than<br>
a channel condition of an initial transmission, higher bit rate may be used by ma-<br>
nipulating a modulation scheme or a payload size. In contrast, if a current channel<br>
condition is worst than a channel condition of an initial transmission, lower bit rate<br>
may be used.<br>
[15] The terminal checks an uplink scheduling information by monitoring a PDCCH in<br>
every TTI. Then, the terminal transmits data through a PUSCH based on the uplink<br>
scheduling information. The terminal firstly generates the data in a MAC PDU format,<br>
and then stores it in a HARQ buffer. After that, the terminal transmits the data based<br>
on the uplink scheduling information. Later, the terminal waits to receive a HARQ<br>
feedback from a base station (eNB). If the terminal receives a HARQ NACK from the<br>
base station in response to the transmitted data, the terminal retransmits the data in a<br>
retransmission TTI of a corresponding HARQ process. If the terminal receives a<br>
HARQ ACK from the base station in response to the transmitted data, the terminal<br>
terminates to operate the retransmission of the HARQ. The terminal counts a number<br>
of transmissions (i.e. CURRENT_TX_NB) whenever the data is transmitted in a<br>
HARQ process. If the number of transmissions is reached to a maximum number of<br>
transmissions, which set by an upper layer, data in the HARQ buffer is flushed.<br>
[16] The HARQ retransmission is performed according to a HARQ feedback from a base<br>
station, a data existence in the HARQ buffer, or a transmission time of a corresponding<br>
HARQ process. Here, each of HARQ process may have a HARQ buffer respectively.<br>
The value in the NDI (New Data Indicator) field contained in the PDCCH may be used<br>
for the UE to determine whether the received data is an initial transmission data or a<br>
retransmitted data. More specifically, the NDI field is 1 bit field that toggles every time<br>
a new data is transmitted or received. (0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt;...) As such, the value in the<br>
NDI for the retransmitted data always has a same value used in an initial transmission.<br>
From this, the UE may know an existence of retransmitted data by comparing these<br>
values.<br>
[17] Description of an uplink timing alignment maintenance in a LTE system will be<br>
given. In the LTE system that based on an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex<br>
(OFDM) technology, there is possibility of interferences between terminals (UEs)<br>
during a communication between UE and base station (eNB). In order to rninimize in-<br>
terferences between terminals, it is important that the base station must manage or<br>
handle a transmission timing of the UE. More particularly, the terminal may exist in<br>
random area within a cell, and this implies that a data transmission time (i.e., traveling<br>
time of data from UE to base station) can be varied based on a location of the terminal.<br>
Namely, if the terminal is camped on edge of the cell, data transmission time of this<br>
specific terminal will be much longer than data transmission time of those terminals<br>
who camped on a center of the cell. In contrast, if the terminal is camped on the center<br>
of the cell, data transmission time of this specific terminal will be much shorter than<br>
data transmission time of those terminals who camped on the edge of the cell. The base<br>
station (eNB) must manage or handle all data or signals, which are transmitted by the<br>
terminals within the cell, in order to prevent the interferences between the terminals.<br>
Namely, the base station must adjust or manage a transmission timing of the terminals<br>
upon each terminal's condition, and such adjustment can be called as the timing<br>
alignment maintenance. One of the methods for maintaining the timing alignment is a<br>
random access procedure. Namely, during the random access procedure, the base<br>
station receives a random access preamble transmitted from the terminal, and the base<br>
station can calculate a time alignment (Sync) value using the received random access<br>
preamble, where the time alignment value is to adjust (i.e., faster or slower) a data<br>
transmission timing of the terminal. The calculated time alignment value can be<br>
notified to the terminal by a random access response, and the terminal can update the<br>
data transmission timing based on the calculated time alignment value. In other<br>
method, the base station may receive a sounding reference symbol (SRS) transmitted<br>
from the terminal periodically or randomly, the base station may calculate the time<br>
alignment (Sync) value based on the SRS, and the terminal may update the data<br>
transmission timing according to the calculated time alignment value.<br>
[18] As explained above, the base station (eNB) may measure a transmission timing of the<br>
terminal though a random access preamble or SRS, and may notify an adjustable<br>
timing value to the terminal. Here, the time alignment (Sync) value (i.e., the adjustable<br>
timing value) can be called as a time advance command (referred as 'TAC' hereafter).<br>
The TAC may be process in a MAC (Medium Access control) layer. Since the terminal<br>
does not camps on a fixed location, the transmission timing is frequently changed<br>
based on a terminal's moving location and/or a terminal's moving velocity.<br>
Concerning with this, if the terminal receives the time advance command (TAC) from<br>
the base station, the terminal expect that the time advance command is only valid for<br>
certain time duration. A time alignment timer (TAT) is used for indicating or rep-<br>
resenting the certain time duration. As such, the time alignment timer (TAT) is started<br>
when the terminal receives the TAC (time advance command) from the base station.<br>
The TAT value is transmitted to the terminal (UE) through a RRC (Radio Resource<br>
Control) signal such as system information (SI) or a radio bearer reconfiguration. Also,<br>
if the terminal receives a new TAC from the base station during an operation of the<br>
TAT, the TAT is restarted. Further, the terminal does not transmit any other uplink<br>
data or control signal (e.g., data on physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), control<br>
signal on Physical uplink control channel (PUCCH)) except for the random access<br>
preamble when the TAT is expired or not running.<br>
[19] In general, a MAC layer of the terminal and base station handles a time alignment<br>
(synchronize) management Namely, The TAC is generated in the MAC layer of the<br>
base station, and the MAC layer of the terminal receives the TAC through a MAC<br>
message from the base station. However, because the TAC is received by the MAC<br>
message, a transmission of the TAC is not fully guaranteed. For example, the base<br>
station transmits the MAC message including the TAC in a HARQ process, and the<br>
terminal attempts to receive the data. The terminal transmits a NACK signal to the<br>
base station if the terminal fails to decode the data. However, if such NACK signal is<br>
mistakenly treated as an ACK signal by the base station, a TAT of the base station is<br>
restarted whereas a TAT of the terminal is not restarted. Thusly, a failed synchro-<br>
nization can be happened between the terminal and base station.<br>
[20] Another example of drawback in a related art can be given as following. Firstly, the<br>
terminal receives an uplink scheduling information through a PDCCH for a<br>
transmission of data 1. Then, the terminal transmits the data 1 to the base station using<br>
the HARQ process. In response to the transmitted data 1, the terminal receives a<br>
NACK from the base station. Therefore the terminal has to retransmit the data 1,<br>
however, the TAT of the terminal can be expired before a retransmission of the data 1.<br>
In this situation, the terminal can not possibly retransmit the data 1 due to expiry of the<br>
TAT. Therefore, the terminal restarts the TAT after receiving a TAC from the base<br>
station though a random access channel (RACH) procedure. However, the terminal<br>
still transmits data 1 at a transmission timing of the HARQ process because the data 1<br>
is still stored in a HARQ buffer of the terminal. In this case, the transmission of the<br>
data 1 is not expected by the base station, this data transmission can be collided with<br>
other data transmission by other terminals.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[34] One aspect of this disclosure relates to the recognition by the present inventors about<br>
the problems of the related art as described above, and further explained hereafter.<br>
Based upon this recognition, the features of this disclosure have been developed.<br>
[35] Although this disclosure is shown to be implemented in a mobile communication<br>
system, such as a UMTS developed under 3GPP specifications, this disclosure may<br>
also be applied to other communication systems operating in conformity with different<br>
standards and specifications.<br>
[36] Hereinafter, description of structures and operations of the preferred embodiments<br>
according to the present invention will be given with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
[37] In general, a terminal (or UE) may perform a random access procedure in the<br>
following cases: 1) when the terminal performs an initial access because there is no<br>
RRC Connection with a base station (or eNB), 2) when the terminal initially accesses<br>
to a target cell in a handover procedure, 3) when it is requested by a command of a<br>
base station, 4) when there is uplink data transmission in a situation where uplink time<br>
synchronization is not aligned or where a specific radio resource used for requesting<br>
radio resources is not allocated, and 5) when a recovery procedure is performed in case<br>
of a radio link failure or a handover failure.<br>
[38] In the LTE system, the base station allocates a dedicated random access preamble to<br>
a specific terminal, and the terminal performs a non-contention random access<br>
procedure which performs a random access procedure with the random access<br>
preamble. In other words, there are two procedures in selecting the random access<br>
preamble: one is a contention based random access procedure in which the terminal<br>
randomly selects one within a specific group for use, another is a non-contention based<br>
random access procedure in which the terminal uses a random access preamble<br>
allocated only to a specific terminal by the base station. The difference between the<br>
two random access procedures is that whether or not a collision problem due to<br>
contention occurs, as described later. And, the non-contention based random access<br>
procedure may be used, as described above, only in the handover procedure or when it<br>
is requested by the command of the base station.<br>
[39] Based on the above description, Figure 5 shows an operation procedure between a<br>
terminal and a base station in a contention based random access procedure.<br>
[40] First, a terminal in the contention based random access randomly may select a<br>
random access preamble within a group of random access preambles indicated through<br>
system information or a handover command, may select PRACH resources capable of<br>
transmitting the random access preamble, and then may transmit the selected random<br>
access preamble to a base station (Step 1).<br>
[41] After transmitting the random access preamble, the terminal may attempt to receive a<br>
response with respect to its random access preamble within a random access response<br>
reception window indicated through the system information or the handover command<br>
(Step 2). More specifically, the random access response information is transmitted in a<br>
form of MAC PDU, and the MAC PDU may be transferred on the Physical Downlink<br>
Shared Channel (PDSCH). In addition, the Physical Downlink Control Channel<br>
(PDCCH) is also transferred such that the terminal appropriately receives information<br>
transferred on the PDSCH. That is, the PDCCH may include information about a<br>
terminal that should receive the PDSCH, frequency and time information of radio<br>
resources of the PDSCH, a transfer format of the PDSCH, and the like. Here, if the<br>
PDCCH has been successfully received, the terminal may appropriately receive the<br>
random access response transmitted on the PDSCH according to information of the<br>
PDCCH. The random access response may include a random access preamble<br>
identifier (ID), an UL Grant, a temporary C-RNTI, a Time Alignment Command, and<br>
the like. Here, the random access preamble identifier is included in the random access<br>
response in order to notify terminals to which information such as the UL Grant, the<br>
temporary C-RNTL and the Time Alignment Command would be valid (available,<br>
effective) because one random access response may include random access response<br>
information for one or more terminals. Here, the random access preamble identifier<br>
may be identical to the random access preamble selected by the terminal in Step 1.<br>
[42] If the terminal has received the random access response valid to the terminal itself,<br>
the terminal may process each of the information included in the random access<br>
response. That is, the terminal applies the Time Alignment Command, and stores the<br>
temporary C-RNTL In addition, the tenninal uses the UL Grant so as to transmit data<br>
stored in a buffer of the terminal or newly generated data to the base station (Step 3).<br>
Here, a terminal identifier should be essentially included in the data which is included<br>
in the UL Grant (message 3). This is because, in the contention based random access<br>
procedure, the base station may not determine which terminals are performing the<br>
random access procedure, but later the terminals should be identified for contention<br>
resolution. Here, two different schemes may be provided to include the terminal<br>
identifier. A first scheme is to transmit the terminal's cell identifier through the UL<br>
Grant if the terminal has already received a valid cell identifier allocated in a corre-<br>
sponding cell prior to the random access procedure. Conversely, the second scheme is<br>
to transmit the terminal's unique identifier (e.g„ S-TMSI or random ID) if the terminal<br>
has not received a valid cell identifier prior to the random access procedure. In general,<br>
the unique identifier is longer than the cell identifier. In Step 3, if the terminal has<br>
transmitted data through the UL Grant, the terminal starts the contention resolution<br>
timer.<br>
[43] After transmitting the data with its identifier through the UL Grant included in the<br>
random access response, the terminal waits for an indication (instruction) of the base<br>
station for the contention resolution. That is, the terminal attempts to receive the<br>
PDCCH so as to receive a specific message (Step 4). Here, there are two schemes to<br>
receive the PDCCH. As described above, if the terminal identifier transmitted via the<br>
UL Grant is the cell identifier, the terminal attempts to receive the PDCCH by using its<br>
own cell identifier. If the terminal identifier transmitted via the UL Grant is its unique<br>
identifier, the terrninal attempts to receive the PDCCH by using the temporary C-RNTI<br>
included in the random access response. Thereafter, for the former, if the PDCCH<br>
(message 4) is received through its cell identifier before the contention resolution timer<br>
is expired, the terminal determines that the random access procedure has been suc-<br>
cessfully (normally) performed, thus to complete the random access procedure. For the<br>
latter, if the PDCCH is received through the temporary cell identifier before the<br>
contention resolution timer is expired, the terminal checks data (message 4) transferred<br>
by the PDSCH that the PDCCH indicates. If the unique identifier of the terminal is<br>
included in the data, the terminal determines that the random access procedure has<br>
been successfully (normally) performed, thus to complete the random access<br>
procedure.<br>
[44] Figure 6 shows an operation procedure between a terminal and a base station in a<br>
non-contention based random access procedure. As compared with the contention<br>
based random access procedure, the random access procedure is determined to be suc-<br>
cessfully performed by receiving the random access response information in the non-<br>
contention based random access procedure, thus to complete the random access<br>
process.<br>
[45] In general, the non-contention based random access procedure may be performed in<br>
the following two cases: one is the handover procedure, and the other is a request by<br>
the command of the base station. To be certain, the contention based random access<br>
procedure may also be performed in those two cases. First, for the non-contention<br>
based random access procedure, it is important to receive, from the base station, a<br>
dedicated random access preamble without having any possibility of contention. Here,<br>
a handover command and a PDCCH command may be used to assign the random<br>
access preamble. Then, after the random access preamble dedicated to only the<br>
terminal itself has been assigned from the base station, the terminal transmits the<br>
preamble to the base station. Thereafter, the method for receiving the random access<br>
response information is the same as that in the above-described contention based<br>
random access procedure.<br>
[46] As aforementioned in this disclosure, the present invention proposes a method of<br>
flushing data in all HARQ buffer of the terminal when a time alignment timer (TAT) is<br>
not running or is expired.<br>
[47] Figure 7 shows an exemplary view of flushing data in HARQ buffer at an expiry of<br>
time alignment timer (TAT) according to the present invention. As illustrated in Figure<br>
7, the present invention proposes to flush all HARQ buffers at the TAT expiry. More<br>
detailed description of Figure 7 will be given as following. First, the terminal may<br>
receive a PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) including an uplink<br>
scheduling information (i.e. UL grant) for a data transmission of an uplink. Here, the<br>
PDCCH may include a C-RNTI (Cell-Radio Network Temporary Identifier) or Semi-<br>
Persistent Scheduling C-RNTI (SPS C-RNTI). Thereafter, the terminal may generate a<br>
MAC PDU (referred as MAC PDU-1 hereafter) according to the received uplink<br>
scheduling information, and may store the generated MAC PDU-1 in a corresponding<br>
HARQ buffer. Further, the terminal may transmit the stored MAC PDU-1 to the base<br>
station at a transmission timing of a corresponding HARQ process. After the MAC<br>
PDU-1 is transmitted, the terminal may wait to receive a HARQ feedback from the<br>
base station. At this moment, the time alignment timer (TAT) of the terminal may<br>
expire. According to the present invention, the terminal may flush data in all HARQ<br>
buffers including a HARQ buffer having the MAC PDU-1 at the time of TAT expiry.<br>
[48] Figure 8 shows an exemplary view of flushing data in HARQ buffer when a time<br>
alignment timer (TAT) is not running according to the present invention. As illustrated<br>
in Figure 8, the present invention proposes to flush all HARQ buffers when the TAT is<br>
not running. More detailed description of Figure 8 will be given as following. After the<br>
TAT is expired, the terminal may flush data in all HARQ buffers. Here, a current TAT<br>
of the terminal is not running and there is no data in all HARQ buffers. In this case, the<br>
terminal may further receive a PDCCH including an uplink scheduling information for<br>
an uplink data transmission. Here, the PDCCH may include a C-RNTI (Cell-Radio<br>
Network Temporary Identifier) or Semi-Persistent Scheduling C-RNTI (SPS C-RNTI).<br>
Thereafter, the terminal may generate a MAC PDU (referred as MAC PDU-2<br>
hereafter) according to the received uplink scheduling information, and may store the<br>
generated MAC PDU-2 in a corresponding HARQ buffer. However, according to the<br>
present invention, the terminal may flush data in all HARQ because the TAT of the<br>
terminal is not running.<br>
[49] Figure 9 shows an exemplary view of flushing data in HARQ buffer by receiving a<br>
new timing advance command (TAC) when a time alignment timer (TAT) is not<br>
running according to the present invention. As illustrated in Figure 9, the present<br>
invention proposes to flush all HARQ buffers when the terminal receives a new TAC<br>
while a TAT of the terminal is not running after its expiration. More detailed de-<br>
scription of Figure 9 will be given as following. After the TAT is expired, the terminal<br>
may flush data in all HARQ buffers. While the TAT is not running, the terminal may<br>
further receive a PDCCH including an uplink scheduling information for an uplink<br>
data transmission. Here, the PDCCH may include a C-RNTI (Cell-Radio Network<br>
Temporary Identifier) or Semi-Persistent Scheduling C-RNTI (SPS C-RNTT).<br>
Thereafter, the terminal may generate a MAC PDU (referred as MAC PDU-3<br>
hereafter) according to the received uplink scheduling information, and may store the<br>
generated MAC PDU-3 in a corresponding HARQ buffer. The terminal may attempt to<br>
transmit the MAC PDU-3 to the base station. However, since the TAT is not running,<br>
the terminal may not transmit the MACE PDU-3. Here, the MAC PDU-3 is kept in the<br>
corresponding HARQ buffer. At this moment, the terminal may receive a new TAC.<br>
For example, the terminal may receive the new TAC by a random access response<br>
during the random access channel (RACH) procedure. Once the new TAC is received<br>
by the terminal, the terminal may flush data in all HARQ buffer and may restart the<br>
TAT.<br>
[50] According to the present invention, when the time alignment timer expires, all<br>
HARQ buffers (i.e., all uplink HARQ buffers) are flushed and the next transmission<br>
for each process is considered as the very first transmission. Namely, the terminal may<br>
notify RRC of PUCCH/SRS release and may clear any configured downlink as-<br>
signment and uplink grants.<br>
[51] The present disclosure may provide a method of processing data for a HARQ<br>
(Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) operation in a wireless communication system, the<br>
method comprising: receiving an uplink Grant from a network; generating a data unit<br>
based on the received uplink grant; storing the generated data unit into a plurality of<br>
buffers; and flushing the stored data unit in the plurality of buffers when a timer<br>
expires, wherein the timer is a Time Alignment Timer (TAT), the uplink grant is<br>

Temporary Identifier), and a Semi-persistent Scheduling C-RNTI, the data unit is<br>
MAC PDU (Medium Access Control Protocol Data Unit), and the plurality of buffers<br>
is all uplink HARQ buffers.<br>
