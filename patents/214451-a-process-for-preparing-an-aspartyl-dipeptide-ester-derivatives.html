[detailed explanation of invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[field of invention]<br>
The present invention relates to novel aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives, and a sweetener and products such as foods having a sweetness, which contain the same as an active ingredient.<br>
[0002]<br>
[prior art]<br>
In recent years, as eating habits have been improved to a high level, fatness caused by excessive intake of sugar and diseases accompanied by fatness have been at issue. Accordingly, the development of a low-calory sweetener that replaces sugar has been in demand. As a sweetener that has been widely used at present, there is aspartame which is<br><br>
excellent in a safety and organoleptic properties. However, this is somewhat problematic in the stability.  In WO 94/11391, it is stated that derivatives in which an alkyl group is introduced in an amino group of aspartic acid constituting aspartame markedly improves sweetening potency and the stability is slightly improved. It is reported that the best compound  described  in  this  document  is  N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester having a 3,3-dimethylbutyl group as an alkyl group and the sweetening potency thereof is 10,000 times.   Aspartame derivatives having introduced therein 20 types of substituents other than the 3,3-dimethylbutyl group are indicated therein, and the sweetening potency thereof is reported to be less than 2,500  times.    Derivatives  having  a  3-(substituted phenyl)propyl group as an alkyl group are also shown. However, it is reported that the sweetening potency of N-[N-(3-phenylpropyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester is  1,500  times  and  that  of  N-[N-[3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxypheny1)propyl]-L-a-asparty1]-L-phenylalanine     1-methyl ester is 2,500 times. Thus, these are far less than that  (10,000  times)  of  N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester. [0003] [problems invention is to solve]<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide novel<br><br>
aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives which are excellent in the safety and which have sweetening potency equal to or higher than that of the N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-mehtyl ester, and a low-calory sweetener containing the same as an active ingredient. [0004] [means to solve problems]<br>
In order to solve the problems, the present inventors<br>
have synthesized several aspartame derivatives in which<br>
various 3-(substituted phenyl)propyl groups are introduced in<br>
an amino group of aspartic acid constituting the aspartame<br>
derivatives by use of cinnam aldehyde having various<br>
substituents  on  3-phenylpropianaldehyde  having  various<br>
substituents that can easily derived therefrom an precursor<br>
aldehydes, and have examined the sweetening potency of them.<br>
They have consequently found that with respect to the<br>
sweetening potency, the novel compounds that they have found<br>
are by far higher than not only N-[N-(3-phenylpropyl)-L-a-<br>
aspartylJ-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester which is reported to<br>
have the sweetening potency of 1,500 times in WO 94/11391 but<br>
also	N- [M-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-<br>
phenylalanine 1-methyl ester which is reported therein to have the sweetening potency of 10,000 times, and that especially the compounds represented by the following formula (1) are excellent as a sweetener.  These findings have led to the<br><br>
completion of the invention.<br>
The present invention ( Claim 1 ) is directed to novel aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives ( including the salt forms thereof ) represented by the general formula (1):<br>

These are included in the derivatives of the invention as described above.<br>
[0013]<br>
The aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives of the present invention can easily be formed by reductively alkylating aspartame derivatives with cinnamaldehydes having various substituents and a reducing agent (for example, hydrogen/palladium carbon catalyst). Alternatively, the derivatives can be formed by subjecting aspartame derivatives<br><br>
(for example, P-0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester) having a protective group in a carboxylic acid in the P-position which derivatives can be obtained by the usual peptide synthesis method (Izumiya et al.. Basis of Peptide Synthesis and Experiments Thereof, Maruzen, published January 20, 1985) to reductive alkylation with cinnamaldehydes having various substituents and a reducing agent (for example, NaB(0Ac)3H) (A. F. Abdel-Magid et al.. Tetrahedron Letters, 31, 5595 (1990)), and then removing the protective group. However, the method of forming the compounds of the invention is not limited thereto.  3-Phenylpropionai.dehydes having various substituents or acetal derivatives thereof can of course be used as precursor aldehydes in the reductive alkylation  instead  of  cinnamaldehydes  having  various substituents. [0014]<br>
As a result of an organoleptic test, the compounds and the salts thereof in the invention were found to have a strong sweetening potency and have organoleptic properties similar to that of sugar. For example, the sweetening potency of N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 20,000 times, that of N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 8,000 times (relative    to    sugar),    that    of    N~[N-[3-(4-<br><br>
methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 6,500 times (relative to sugar) , and that of N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a -aspartyl]-L-tyrosine 1-methyl ester was approximately 16,000 times (relative to sugar).<br>
With respect to the aspartyl dipeptide derivatives (represented by formula (2)) formed, the structures and tlie results of the organoleptic test are shown in Table 1.<br>

EXAMPLKg The invention is illustrated specifically by referring to the following Examples. EXAMPLE 1<br>
Synthesis of N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester<br>
Five milliliters of a solution of 4N-HCL and dioxane were added to 485 mg (1.0 mmol) of N-t-butoxycarbonyl-P-0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. Thirty milliliters of a 5% sodium hydrogencarbonate aqueous solution were added to the residue, and the mixture was extracted twice with 30 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic layer<br><br>
was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Then, magnesium sulfate was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain 385 mg of p-0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester as a viscous oil. [0019]<br>
The P-0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (385 mg, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in 15 ml of THF, and the solution was maintained at 0°C. To this were added 268 mg (1.0 mmol) of 3-benzyloxy-4-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 0.060 ml (1.0 mmol) of acetic acid and 318 mg (1.5 mmol) of NaB(0Ac)3H. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 hour and further overnight at room temperature. To the reaction solution were added 50 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate, and the mixture was extracted twice with 30 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Then, magnesium sulfate was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was  purified  with  PTLC  (  Preparative  Thin  Layer Chromatography ) to obtain 523 mg (0.82 mmol) of N-[N-[3-(3-benzyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propenyl]-P-0-benzyl-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester as a viscous oil. [0020]<br><br>
The N-[N-[3-(3-benzyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propenyl]-P-0-benzyl-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester (523 mg, 0.82 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of 30  ml of methanol and 1 ml of water, and 200 mg of 10% palladium carbon (water content 50%) were added thereto.  The mixture was reduced in a hydrogen stream at room temperature for 3 hours. The catalyst was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure.  In order to remove an odor adsorbed, the residue was purified with PTLC to obtain 228   mg    (0.48   mmol)    of   N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine     1-methyl ester as a solid.<br>

[field of invention]<br>
The present invention relates to novel aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives, and a sweetener and products such as foods having a sweetness, which contain the same as an active<br><br>
ingredient. [OOO2J [prior art]<br>
In recent years, as eating habits have been improved to a high level, fatness caused by excessive intake of sugar and diseases accompanied by fatness have been at issue. Accordingly, the development of a low-calory sweetener that replaces sugar has been in demand. As a sweetener that has been widely used at present, there is aspartame which is excellent in a safety and organoleptic properties. However, this is somewhat problematic in the stability. In WO 94/11391, it is stated that derivatives in which an alkyl group is introduced in an amino group of aspartic acid constituting aspartame markedly improves sweetening potency and the stability is slightly improved.  It is reported that the best compound  described  in  this  document  is  N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine l-methyl ester having a 3,3-dimethylbutyl group as an alkyl group and the sweetening potency thereof is 10,000 times.   Aspartame derivatives having introduced therein 20 types of substituents other than the 3,3-dimethylbutyl group are indicated therein, and the sweetening potency thereof is reported to be less than 2,500  times.    Derivatives  having  a  3-(substituted phenyl)propyl group as an alkyl group are also shown. However, it is reported that the sweetening potency of N-[N-(3-<br><br>
phenylpropyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester is 1,500 times and that of N-[N-[3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester is 2,500 times. Thus, these are far less than that (10,000 times) of N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester. [0003] [problems invention is to solve]<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide novel aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives which are excellent in the safety and which have sweetening potency equal to or higher than that of the N-[N-(3,3-diraethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-mehtyl ester, and a low-calory sweetener containing the same as an active ingredient. [0004] [means to solve problems]<br>
In order to solve the problems, the present inventors have synthesized several aspartame derivatives in which various 3-(substituted phenyl)propyl groups are introduced in an amino group of aspartic acid constituting the aspartame derivatives by use of cinnam aldehyde having various substituents on 3-phenylpropianaldehyde having various substituents that can easily derived therefrom an precursor aldehydes, and have examined the sweetening potency of them. They have consequently found that with respect to the<br><br>
sweetening potency, the novel compounds that they have found<br>
are by far higher than not only N-[N-(3-phenylpropyl)-L-a-<br>
aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester which is reported to<br>
have the sweetening potency of 1,500 times in WO 94/11391 but<br>
also	N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-<br>
phenylalanine 1-methyl ester which is reported therein to have the sweetening potency of 10,000 times, and that especially the compounds represented by the following formula (1) are excellent as a sweetener. These findings have led to the completion of the invention.<br>
The present invention ( Claim 1 ) is directed to novel aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives ( including the salt forms thereof ) represented by the general formula (1): [0005] [chemical formula 2]<br>

Examples of the salts of the compounds in the present invention include salts with alkali metals such as sodium and potassium; salts with alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium; ammonium salts with ammonia; salts with amino acids such as lysine and arginine; salts with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid; and salts with organic acids such as citric acid and acetic acid. These are included in the derivatives of the invention as described above. [0013]<br>
The aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives of the present invention can easily be formed by reductively alkylating aspartame derivatives with cinnamaldehydes having various substituents  and  a  reducing  agent  (for  example.<br><br>
hydrogen/palladium carbon catalyst).  Alternatively, the derivatives can be formed by subjecting aspartame derivatives (for example, P-0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester) having a protective group in a carboxylic acid in the P-position which derivatives can be obtained by the usual peptide synthesis method (Izumiya et al.. Basis of Peptide Synthesis and Experiments Thereof, Maruzen, published January 20, 1985) to reductive alkylation with cinnamaldehydes having various substituents and a reducing agent (for example, NaB(0Ac)3H) (A. F. Abdel-Magid et al.. Tetrahedron Letters, 31, 5595 (1990)), and then removing the protective group. However, the method of forming the compounds of the invention is not limited thereto.  3-Phenylpropionaldehydes having various substituents or acetal derivatives thereof can of course be used as precursor aldehydes in the reductive alkylation  instead  of  cinnamaldehydes  having  various substituents. [0014]<br>
As a result of an organoleptic test, the compounds and the salts thereof in the invention were found to have a strong sweetening potency and have organoleptic properties similar to that of sugar. For example, the sweetening potency of N-[N-[3-(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 35,000 times (relative  to  sugar),  that  of  N-[N-[3-(2-hydroxy-4-<br><br>
methylpheny1)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-a-phenylalanine    1-methyl ester was approximately 30,000 times (relative to sugar), that  of  N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl] -L-phenylalanine l-methyl ester was approximately 20,000    times,    that    of    N-[N-[3-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxypheny1)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine     1-methyl ester was approximately 20,000 times (relative to sugar), that   of  N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methylphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl] -L-phenylalanine l-methyl ester was approximately 15,000 times  (relative to sugar), that of N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine     1-methyl ester was approximately 8,000 times (relative to sugar), that of N-[N-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine l-methyl ester was approximately 6,500 times (relative to sugar), and that of N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-tyrosine    l-methyl ester was approximately 16,000 times (relative to sugar).<br>

EXAMPLES The invention is illustrated specifically by referring to the following Examples. EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
Synthesis of N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester<br>
Five milliliters of a solution of 4N-HCL and dioxane were added to 485 mg (1.0 mmol) of N-t-butoxycarbonyl-P-0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour.  The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. Thirty milliliters of a 5% sodium hydrogencarbonate aqueous solution were added to the residue, and the mixture was extracted twice with 30 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Then, magnesium sulfate was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain 385 mg of p- " 0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester as a . viscous oil. [0019]<br>
The p-0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (385 mg, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in 15 ml of THF, and the solution was maintained at 0°C. To this were added 268 mg (1.0 mmol) of 3-benzyloxy-4-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 0.060 ml (1.0 mmol) of acetic acid and 318 mg (1.5 mmol) of NaB(0Ac)3H. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 hour and further overnight at room temperature. To the reaction solution were added 50 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate,<br><br>
and the mixture was extracted twice with 30 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Then, magnesium sulfate was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified with PTLC ( Preparative Thin Layer Chromatography ) to obtain 523 mg (0.82 mmol) of N-[N-(3-(3-benzyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propenyl]-P-0-benzyl-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester as a viscous oil. [0020]<br>
The N-[N-[3-(3-benzyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propenyl]-P-0-benzyl-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester (523 mg, 0.82 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of 30 ml of methanol and 1 ml of water, and 200 mg of 10% palladium ckrbon (water content 50%) were added thereto.  The mixture was reduced in a hydrogen stream at room temperature for 3 hours. The catalyst was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure.  In order to remove an odor adsorbed, the residue was purified with PTLC to obtain 228   mg    (0.48   mmol)    of   N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine     1-methyl ester as a solid.

it is to be pofoimed<br><br>
P—*<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a novel aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives (including salts thereof) represented by formula (1), and a sweetener and products such as foods having a sweetness, which contain the same as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, as eating habits have been improved to a high level, fatness caused by excessive intake of sugar and diseases accompanied by fatness have been at issue. Accordingly, the development of a low-calory sweetener that replaces sugar has been in demand. As a sweetener that has been widely used at present, there is aspartame which is excellent in a safety and taste properties. However, this is somewhat problematic in the stability. In WO 94/11391, it is stated that derivatives in which an alkyl group is introduced in an amino group of aspartic acid constituting aspartame markedly improves sweetening potency and the stability is slightly improved. It is reported that the best compound described in this document is N- [N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl) -L-a-aspartyl] -L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester having a 3,3-dimethylbutyl group as an alkyl group and the sweetening<br><br>
potency thereof is 10,000 times. Aspartame derivatives having introduced therein 20 types of substituents other than the 3,3-dimethylbutyl group are indicated therein,  and the sweetening potency thereof is reported to be less than 2,500 times.  Derivatives having a 3 -(substituted phenyl)propyl group as an alkyl group are also shown. However, it is reported that the sweetening potency of N-[N-(3-phenylpropyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester is 1,500 times and that  of  N- [N-[3 -(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester is 2,500 times. Thus, these are far less than that (10,000 times) of N- [N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.<br>
PROBLEMS INVENTION IS TO SOLVE. OBJECT THEREOF<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide novel aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives which are excellent in the safety and which have sweetening potency equal to or higher than that of the N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine l-"methyl ester, and a low-calory sweetener containing the same as an active ingredient.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In order to solve the problems, the present inventors have synthesized several aspartame derivatives in which<br><br>
various 3- (substituted phenyl) propyl groups are introduced in an amino group of aspartic acid constituting the aspartame derivatives by use of cinnamaldehyde having various substituents on 3-phenylpropianaldehyde having various substituents that can easily derived therefrom an precursor aldehydes, and have examined the sweetening potency of them. They have consequently found that with respect to the sweetening potency, the novel compounds that they have found are by far higher than not only N-[N- (3-phenylpropyl) -L-a- aspartyl] -L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester which is reported to have the sweetening potency of 1,500 times in WO 94/11391 but also N-[N- (3,3-dimethylbutyl) -L-a-aspartyl] -L- phenylalanine 1-methyl ester which is reported therein to have the sweetening potency of 10,000 times, and that especially the compounds represented by the following formula (1) are excellent as a sweetener. These findings have led to the completion of the invention.<br>

Examples of the salts of the compounds in the invention include salts with alkali metals such as sodium and potassium; salts with alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium; ammonium salts with ammonia; salts with amino acids such as lysine and arginine; salts with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid; and salts with organic acids such as citric acid and acetic acid. These are included in the derivatives of the invention as described above.<br>
The aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives of the invention can easily be formed by reductively alkylating aspartame derivatives with cinnamaldehydes having various substituents and a reducing agent (for example, hydrogen/palladium carbon catalyst). Alternatively, the derivatives can be formed by subjecting aspartame derivatives (for example, P-0-benzyl -a-L-aspartyl -L-phenylalanine methyl<br><br>
ester) having a protective group in a carboxylic acid in the P-position which derivatives can be obtained by the usual peptide synthesis method (Izumiya et al., Basis of Peptide Synthesis and Experiments Thereof, Maruzen, published January 20, 1985) to reductive alkylation with cinnamaldehydes having various substituents and a reducing agent (for example, NaB(0Ac)3H) (A. F. Abdel-Magid et al., Tetrahedron Letters, il, 5595 (1990)), and then removing the protective group. However, the method of forming the compounds of the invention is not limited thereto.  3-Phenylpropionaldehydes having various substituents or acetal derivatives thereof can of course be used as precursor aldehydes in the reductive alkylation  instead  of  cinnamaldehydes  having  various substituents.<br>
As a result of a sensory evaluation, the compounds and the salts thereof in the invention were found to have a strong sweetening potency and have taste properties similar to that of sugar.  For example, the sweetening potency of N-[N-[3-(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 35,000 times (relative  to  sugar),  that  of  N-[N-[3 -(2-hydroxy-4-methylphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-a-phenylalanine    1-methyl ester was approximately 30, 000 times (relative to sugar) , that  of  N- [N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately<br><br>
20,000    times,     that    of    N-[N-[3 -(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine     1-methyl ester was approximately 20, 000 times (relative to sugar) , that   of   N-[N-[3 - (3-hydroxy-4-methylphenyDpropyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 15,000 times  (relative to sugar),  that of N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine     1-methyl ester was approximately 8, 000 times (relative to sugar) , that of N-[N- [3 - (4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 6,500 times (relative to sugar),  and that of N- [N-[3 -(3-hydroxy-4-me thoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl] -L-tyrosine    1-methyl ester was approximately 16,000 times (relative to sugar).<br>

Synthesis of N-[N-[3 -(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-<br>
a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester<br>
Five milliliters of a solution of 4N-HC1 and dioxane were added to 485 mg (1.0 mmol) of N-t-butoxycarbonyl-P-O-benzyl -a-L-aspartyl -L-phenylalanine methyl ester, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour.  The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. Thirty milliliters of a 5% sodium hydrogencarbonate aqueous solution were added to the residue, and the mixture was extracted twice with 30 ml of ethyl acetate.  The organic layer was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.  Then, magnesium sulfate was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain 385 mg of P* 0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl  ester as a viscous oil.<br>
The P-0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl<br>
ester (385 mg, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in 15 ml of THF, and<br>
the solution was maintained at O"C. To this were added 268 mg<br>
(1.0 mmol) of 3-benzyloxy-4-methoxycinnaroaldehyde, 0.060 ml<br>
(1.0 mmol) of acetic acid and 318 mg (1.5 mmol) of NaB(0Ac)3H.<br>
The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 hour and further overnight<br>
at room temperature. To the reaction solution were added 50<br>
ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate,<br><br>
and the mixture was extracted twice with 30 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesixim sulfate. Then, magnesiiim sulfate was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was  purified  with  PTLC  (  Preparative  Thin  Layer Chromatography ) to obtain 523 mg (0.82 mmol) of N-[N-[3* (3-ben2yloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propenyl]-P-0-benzyl-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester as a viscous oil. The N-[N-[3-(3-benzyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propenyl]-P-O-benzyl-L-a-aspartyl] -L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester (523 mg, 0.82 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of 30 ml of methanol and 1 ml of water, and 200 mg of 10% palladium carbon (water content 50%) were added thereto.  The mixture was reduced under a hydrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 3 hours.  The catalyst was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure.  In order to remove an odor adsorbed, the residue was purified with PTLC to obtain 228 mg  (0.48 mmol)  of N-[N-[3 -(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl] -L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine     1-<br>
