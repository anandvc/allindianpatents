				<td>A METHOD OF MAKING A CATALYST FOR THE CONVERSION<br>
OF AT LEAST ONE COMPONENT OF SYNTHESIS GAS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of making a catalyst for the<br>
conversion of at least one component of synthesis gas, in particular, the present<br>
invention is for a method for producing a catalyst for use in the Fischer-Tropsch<br>
process, and the catalyst produced by the inventive method. The catalyst of the<br>
present invention comprises iron and at least one promoter. The catalyst is<br>
prepared via a method which comprises the preparation of a high purity iron<br>
precursor and which uses a nominal amount of water in the catalyst production. The<br>
catalyst particles prepared with the high purity iron precursor are essentially free of<br>
contaminants, and have essentially spherical particle shape and a relatively small<br>
particle size distribution range.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis involves the catalytic conversion of synthesis<br>
gas (a mixture of predominantly carbon monoxide and hydrogen) to a broad<br>
spectrum of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons ranging from methane to<br>
heavy wax. Oxygenates such as alcohols, ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids<br>
can also be synthesized by the Fischer- Tropsch synthesis. The first commercial<br>
Fischer-Tropsch catalysts were cobalt-based and were in use as early as 1935 in<br>
Germany. Early in the development of the Fischer-Trosch synthesis there was an<br>
interest in development of catalysts with metals less expensive than cobalt. Iron<br>
was an obvious choice; however, the commercial use of iron-based Fischer-<br>
Tropsch catalysts was not accomplished until the 1950's. Since that time iron-based<br>
Fischer- Tropsch catalysts have been successfully used in fixed-bed, fluidized-bed<br>
and slurry phase reactors on a commercial scale in South Africa by Sasol.<br>
The activity and selectivity of iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts are<br>
greatly improved by the addition of small amounts of promoters. The classic iron-<br>
based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst is promoted with copper and a group I metal, such<br>
as sodium, potassium,<br>
rubidium, cesium or a combination thereof. Iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts are active<br>
only when they have been reduced with hydrogen, carbon monoxide or synthesis gas.<br>
Copper has been found to significantly lower the reduction temperature of iron oxide and thus<br>
prevent sintering of the catalyst. Promotion with a Group I metal, such as potassium, lowers<br>
the acidity of the iron oxide and thereby decreases the selectivity to undesirable methane and<br>
increases alkene and wax selectivity. Group II metals may also be used; however, Group I<br>
metals are more effective promoters. Binders such as SiO2 and Al2O3, can also be used to<br>
increase the structural integrity and life of iron-based catalysts; however, these generally are<br>
acidic and will result in an increase in methane selectivity.<br>
There have been several methods used for the preparation of iron-based Fischer-<br>
Tropsch catalysts. The earliest catalysts, prepared by Fischer, were iron turnings treated with<br>
alkali. At high pressure, the liquid product was rich in oxygenated compounds, and at lower<br>
pressures hydrocarbons were produced. However, the iron-based catalysts prepared by this<br>
method deactivated rapidly.<br>
The most common method of preparation of iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts is<br>
precipitation. Typically a solution of an iron salt, such as ferric nitrate, is treated with a base,<br>
such as aqueous ammonia or sodium carbonate. The resulting iron oxyhydroxide precipitate<br>
is washed and filtered repeatedly to remove salts - ammonium nitrate or sodium nitrate -<br>
formed during the precipitation process. The washed filter cake is then dried and calcined.<br>
Promotion of the precipitated iron catalyst with copper and a Group I metal can be done at<br>
any time, before or after the drying and calcination steps. The final catalyst is usually<br>
composed of high surface area corundum phase iron oxide (a-Fe203 or hematite).<br>
Other types of iron based catalysts include, fused iron, supported iron and sintered<br>
iron. Fused iron catalysts are prepared by melting iron ore and one or more promoter such as<br>
SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO and K2O. The resulting catalyst is usually composed predominantly<br>
of magnetite (Fe3O4) and has very low surface area. Active fused iron catalysts can only be<br>
achieved by reduction of the oxide to metalic iron with hydrogen. The reduced catalyst can<br>
have surface area up to about 10 to 15 m2/g. Fused iron catalysts are characterized by high<br>
structural integrity and as such are well suited for fluid bed operations (Sasol); however, the<br>
relatively low surface area results in a FischeT-Tropsch catalyst with inferior activity as<br>
compared to typical precipitated iron catalysts. Supported iron catalysts are usually prepared<br>
by impregnating a solution of an iron salt onto a refractory metal oxide such as Al2O3, SiO2,<br>
TiO2 or ZrO2. The impregnation can be carried out by incipient wetagss techniques or by<br>
excess wetting followed by vacuum drying. Supported iron catalysts can have Fischer-<br>
Tropsch activity similar to precipitated iron catalysts on an iron mass basis; however, they are<br>
typically inferior on a catalyst volume basis. Supported iron catalysts inevitably suffer from<br>
the acidity of the metal oxide supports which increases the selectivity of undesirable methane.<br>
Precipitated iron catalysts are generally regarded as superior Fischer-Tropsch<br>
catalysts to the other types of iron catalysts described herein. The major disadvantages of the<br>
manufacture of precipitated iron catalysts include high cost,.the method is labor intensive,<br>
and the by-products are deleterious to the environment. Iron nitrate is the preferred iron<br>
source of precipitated iron catalysts because chloride and sulfur contamination from iron<br>
chloride or iron sulfate would have a deleterious affect on the activity of the resulting F-T<br>
catalyst. Iron nitrate is manufactured by the digestion of iron metal in nitric acid which<br>
produces nitrogen oxides that must be recovered by a scrubbing process. This necessary<br>
scrubbing step adds additional cost to the process. Further, the precipitation method tends to<br>
result in the formation of very viscous and gelatinous iron hydroxide or iron oxyhydrate<br>
precursor. This viscous precursor can be very difficult to form into spherical and attrition-<br>
resistant catalyst for fluid bed applications.<br>
A process to produce iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts that reduces or eliminates<br>
the washing and filtration steps and has minimal emissions to the environment would be<br>
favorable. A logical process from a commercial viewpoint would be to promote, form, dry<br>
and calcine a commercially available iron oxide that has high purity and high surface area.<br>
Commercial iron oxides are readily available; however, they are usually prepared by<br>
treatment of steel with hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. These iron oxides contain<br>
significant amounts of impurities including chloride and sulfur which makes them unusable<br>
as raw materials for Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. As is known in the art, the impurities of the<br>
commercial iron oxides (red or yellow iron oxides) can be reduced to very low level by the<br>
pickling process, under very high temperatures. However, because of the extreme conditions<br>
of the pickling process, the surface area of the iron oxide is generally less than 10 m2/g<br>
making the iron oxide unsuitable for catalyst applications.<br>
Summary of the Present Invention<br>
A Fischer-Tropsch catalyst comprising iron and at least one promoter is prepared via<br>
a method which comprises the preparation of a high purity iron oxide from iron metal. The<br>
catalyst particles prepared with the high purity iron oxide are essentially free of contaminants,<br>
particularly halogens, nitrogen and sulfurs, and have an essentially spherical particle shape, a<br>
relatively narrow particle size distribution range, and surface areas of up to about 100m2/g -<br>
suitable for various catalyst applications.<br>
The method comprises reacting iron metal with a mild organic acid and air in the<br>
presence of a minimal amount of water. The amount of water consumption in this invention<br>
is significantly less than that used in a conventional precipitation method and as a result,<br>
minimum or no waste water containing sulfate, nitrate or chloride is generated in this process.<br>
The resulting iron oxide slurry is then milled and promoters are added. The slurry is spray<br>
dried to form the finished catalyst. Because the process uses iron metal, the level of<br>
potential contaminants, such as sulfur and chlorine, can be kept to a minimum by<br>
starting with clean metal. Further, by starting with iron metal, there are no residual<br>
materials which need to be removed by washing the iron oxide filtrate so the<br>
amount of waste water is significantly lower than in prior art catalyst preparations.<br>
Additionally, because it is not necessary to wash and filter the slurry repeatedly, the<br>
production time is shorter than in prior art catalyst preparations.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of making a catalyst for<br>
the conversion of at least one component of synthesis gas, said method comprising<br>
the steps of: preparing an essentially contaminant-free iron slurry by reacting iron<br>
metal with an aqueous solution of an organic acid and an oxidizing agent; milling<br>
said iron slurry to a median particle size of less than about 2 microns; adding at<br>
least one promoter to said milled iron slurry to form a product slurry; spray drying<br>
said product slurry to form particles; and calcining said particles to form said<br>
catalyst.<br>
The present invention also provides a catalyst for the conversion of at least<br>
one component of synthesis gas, said catalyst being prepared by reacting an iron<br>
metal with an organic acid and air to form an iron oxide slurry, adding one or more<br>
promoters to said iron oxide slurry to form a product slurry, and spray drying and<br>
calcining said product slurry, and said catalyst comprising from about 35 wt % to<br>
about 70 wt % iron and from about 0.002 wt % to about 40 wt % of a promoter.<br>

method in accordance with the present development as described in Example 2.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The catalyst of the present invention is intended for use in the Fischer-<br>
Tropsch (F-T) process. The catalyst composition is similar to F-T catalysts of the<br>
prior art and includes iron and at least one promoter. However, the process by<br>
which the catalyst is prepared is novel and the catalyst of the present invention<br>
includes fewer contaminants, such as sulfur and chlorine, and can be produced<br>
more efficiently than the prior art F-T catalysts.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch process is a surface-catalyzed polymerization process that<br>
converts synthesis gas (mixture of hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide) to hydrocarbons with<br>
a broad range of chain lengths and functionality. Typically, the catalysts used in the Fischer-<br>
Tropsch process include at least one metal that is an efficient carbon monoxide adsorber, and<br>
that is effective for hydrogenation reactions, such as iron, cobalt and nickel. Catalysts<br>
comprising iron or cobalt are preferred for the production of a spectrum of hydrocarbons;<br>
nickel-based catalysts tend to produce large quantities of methane; and ruthenium-based<br>
catalysts generate predominantly methane or high melting waxes, depending on the reaction<br>
conditions. The catalyst of the present invention comprises from about 35 wt % to about 70<br>
wt % iron, based on the total catalyst weight, including the iron; and, in a more preferred<br>
embodiment, the catalyst comprises from about 56 wt % to about 70 wt % iron.<br>
Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, particularly the iron catalysts, also commonly include at<br>
least one promoter which is added to improve selected properties of the catalyst or to modify<br>
the catalyst activity and / or selectivity. However, the addition of a promoter is not required<br>
to prepare the catalyst particles having an essentially spherical shape and a relatively narrow<br>
particle size distribution. For iron-based catalysts, the prior art teaches that copper, the alkali<br>
metals and the alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium,<br>
magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and combinations thereof, are effective promoters.<br>
Other metals may be substituted as desired by the user to modify the catalyst properties or to<br>
modify the catalyst's activity and / or selectivity. For example, Fischer-Tropsch catalysts<br>
have been prepared with promoters selected from the group consisting of boron, cerium,<br>
chromium, copper, indium, iron, lanthanum, manganese, molybdenum, palladium, platinum,<br>
rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium, strontium, tungsten, vanadium, zinc, sodium oxide, potassium<br>
oxide, rubidium oxide, cesium oxide, magnesium oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and<br>
other rare earth metals, such as scandium, yttrium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium,<br>
samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium,<br>
ytterbium, lutetium, and combinations thereof. The promoters are generally added in smaller<br>
concentrations than the iron, and in the present invention, the promoters preferably comprise<br>
from about 0.002 wt % to about 40 wt %, and more preferably comprises from about 0.01 wt<br>
% to about 1 wt % of the total catalyst weight.<br>
The physical structure of the Fischer-Tropsch catalyst also affects the catalyst activity<br>
and, as is known in the art, selecting the proper catalyst design for a particular type of reactor<br>
can translate to relatively high production rates and relatively low maintenance costs for a<br>
commercial producer. The catalyst's structural or mechanical properties, including particle<br>
strength and attrition resistance, depend on the chemical stability of the catalyst and are<br>
affected by the catalyst particle's size and shape. The catalyst particle's shape and size also<br>
can affect properties such as flow distribution and pressure drop.<br>
In the present invention, although the catalyst composition is similar to that of<br>
Fischer-Tropsch catalysts of the prior art, the process by which the catalyst is prepared results<br>
in a catalyst which is essentially free of contaminants, and which has an essentially spherical<br>
particle shape, a relatively narrow particle size distribution range, and a high surface area.<br>
Broadly presented, the process for preparing a preferred embodiment of the catalyst of the<br>
present invention includes directly treating iron metal with a mild organic acid and air to<br>
form an iron oxide slurry, then intensively milling the slurry to a small micron size, then<br>
adding one or more promoters to the slurry, and then spray drying the slurry with a wheel<br>
atomizer. Water is added to the process only as needed to allow for mixing of the materials.<br>
(As used herein, the term "contaminants" refers to elements or compounds which are known<br>
in the art to deleteriously affect the performance of the Fischer-Tropsch catalyst. Some<br>
commonly recognized contaminants are sulfur and chlorine.)<br><br>
More specifically, to prepare the Fischer-Tropsch catalyst of the present invention,<br>
iron metal is reacted with a mild organic acid in aqueous media at ambient conditions, and<br>
the mixture is then aerated. The iron metal may be a powder, granule, sphere, chip or other<br>
form having an average diameter of from about In to about 500µ. In one embodiment, the<br>
iron metal is in micro-spheroidal form with an average diameter of from about 40µ to about<br>
150µ. Further, the iron metal should be essentially contaminant-free, although traces of<br>
carbon, manganese, nickel, copper, silicon and combinations thereof, may be present. (As<br>
used herein, "traces" is defined as less than about 1.5 wt% for all the elements combined.)<br>
The organic acid is preferably a carboxylic acid having at least one carboxylic acid group<br>
with a pKa at ambient temperature of from about 0.5 to about 6. For example, formic acid,<br>
acetic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid and propionic acid may be<br>
used in the reaction.<br>
The organic acid is added to deionized water with agitation to form an acid solution.<br>
At ambient temperature and while maintaining the agitation or mixing, the iron metal is<br>
slowly added to the acid solution. As the iron reacts with the acid, the reaction temperature<br>
increases, but the rate of addition should be sufficiently slow that the temperature does not<br>
exceed about 100°F.It is believed that when iron metal is added to the organic acid solution,<br>
the iron is oxidized by the acid and hydrogen gas (H2) is produced. The hydrogen gas can be<br>
diluted in a vent with air to a concentration of less than about 4%, i.e. below the explosion<br>
limit, or it can be sent to an after-burner to recover the heat for use in drying or calcination.<br>
After the iron metal is mixed into the acid solution, an additional oxidizing agent,<br>
such as air, compressed air, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, an organic peroxide, ozone or a<br>
combination thereof, is added to the solution. In one embodiment the oxidizing agent is<br>
compressed air which is forced through the solution via a stainless steel air sparger mounted<br>
within a mix tank, however, a variety of other means as are known in the art may be used to<br>
bubble air through the iron / acid solution. The air flow is continued and the reaction<br>
temperature is held at less than about 100°F until essentially all the free iron is consumed and<br>
an iron slurry is formed. The slurry is believed to comprise iron oxide hydrate, iron oxide,<br>
iron hydroxide, iron oxyhydroxide or a combination thereof. Total iron consumption time<br>
can range from about 24 hours to about 48 hours, or longer depending on the iron source.<br>
During the course of the reaction, the slurry color changes from gray to brown. Typically,<br>
the color change will be evident from about 45 minutes to about 6 hours after the air flow is<br>
started. Unreacted iron can be detected by X-ray diffraction patterns.<br>
The iron slurry is milled to a small particle size, such as a median particle size of less<br>
than about 40 microns, preferably a particle size of less than about 10 microns. In the<br>
examples presented herein, a Netzsch mill with SEPR, ER 120A 0.8/1.25 mm ceramic beads<br>
is used. However, several different milling techniques are known in the art and may be used<br>
in place of the Netzsch mill.<br>
The iron content in the slurry is determined using standard techniques known in the<br>
art, and promoters are added to the slurry. The specific promoters added and concentration at<br>
which the promoters are added can vary depending on the application. If the promoters are<br>
added as crystals, the crystals may be dissolved in a small amount of water before addition to<br>
the slurry. After the addition of the promoters, the product slurry should have a solids<br>
content of from about 10 % to about 40 %.<br>
The slurry is then spray dried with a wheel atomizer. The inlet temperature is set to<br>
about 500°F, and the outlet temperature is maintained at about 300°F. A median particle size<br>
of from about 50 microns to 80 microns (wheel speed of about 13,000 rpm) is preferred.<br>
After spray drying, the surface area of the catalyst is from about 10 m2/g to about 40 m2/g.<br>
The spray dried catalyst is then calcined and screened to remove large particles. After<br>
calcining in a box furnace set at about 662°F for about 4 hours, the catalyst has a surface area<br>
of from about 10 m2/g to about 80 m2/g. The spray dried catalyst has an essentially spherical<br>
shape.<br>
The following examples illustrate and explain the present invention, but are not to be<br>
taken as limiting the present invention in any regard. Example 1 describes the preparation of<br>
a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst using a conventional precipitation method. Examples 2-8<br>
describe preparations of Fischer-Tropsch catalysts using the minimal effluent method in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
Example 1: A comparative sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by a<br>
prior art precipitation method as follows:<br>
About 30 pounds of iron oxide is produced by adding about 133.55 kg of iron nitrate<br>
solution (7% Fe (w/w); commercially available from Shepherd Chemical, Cincinnati, OH) to<br>
a 45 gallon stainless steel tank. Deionized water is added until the total volume is about 42<br>
gallons. The iron nitrate solution is thoroughly mixed.<br>
The iron nitrate solution is then fed at a feed rate of about 890 cc/min into an about 8<br>
liter stainless steel precipitation tank with hole cut at about the 6.5 liter level. Essentially<br>
concurrently an aqueous ammonia solution (29% w/w) is fed at an initial feed rate of about<br>
400 cc/min into the precipitation tank. The combined solutions have a residence time of<br>
about 5 minutes in the precipitation vessel. The solution in the precipitation vessel is mixed<br>
with a high shear mixer, and the aqueous ammonia solution feed rate is adjusted such that the<br>
combined solution in the precipitation vessel has a pH of about 10.0. A slurry forms and is<br>
allowed to overflow from the precipitation vessel into a stainless steel overflow tank (having<br>
a capacity of about 110 gallons) where it continues to be mixed. When the iron nitrate<br>
solution is consumed, the aqua ammonia solution flow is discontinued, and about 50 gallons<br>
of slurry is present in the overflow tank.<br>
The slurry is filtered through a filter press to form a filtrate, and the conductivity of<br>
the filtrate is measured, using standard techniques known in the art. The filtrate or filter cake<br>
is treated with air until firm. The filter cake is loaded into a stainless steel tank having a<br>
capacity of about 110 gallons and about 36 gallons of deionized water is added. The filter<br>
cake and water are thoroughly mixed and the filtration process is repeated. The washing and<br>
filtration steps are repeated until the filtrate has conductivity of about 300 µS. (This may<br>
require, for example, about 7 washings and 8 filiations.)<br>
The iron content in the slurry is determined using standard techniques known in the<br>
art, and promoters are added to the slurry. Per about 100 g iron in the slurry, Cu(NO3)2. 2 1/2<br>
H2O crystals (commercially available from Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) or Cu(NO3)2 solution<br>
(28% Cu, w/v (SCI plant material) is added to deliver about 0.5 g copper and potassium<br>
nitrate (commercially available from Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) is added to deliver about 0.2 g<br>
K2O. If the promoters are added as crystals, the crystals may be dissolved in a minimal<br>
amount of water before addition to the slurry.<br>
The slurry is then spray dried with a wheel atomizer (APV Anhydro Spray Drier).<br>
The inlet temperature is set to about 500°F, and the outlet temperature is maintained at about<br>
300°F. A median particle size of 50 to 60 microns (13,000 rpm) is preferred. The spray dried<br>
catalyst is then calcined at about 662°F for 4 hours in a box furnace. About 20 pounds of<br>
catalyst is produced.<br>
Example 2: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the comparative<br>
method presented in Example 1 except that after the washing and filtration steps, about 25 cc<br>
of nitric acid is then added to about 25 pounds of the filter cake and mixed thoroughly so that<br>
the filter cake becomes fluid with agitation. Water may be added as necessary to facilitate<br>
mixing. The solids content of the solution should be at from about 15% to about 20%. The<br>
iron content is then determined, the promoters are added, and the slurry is spray-dried as in<br>
Example 1.<br>
Example 3: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the comparative<br>
method presented in Example 1 except that after the washing and filtration steps, the product<br>
is milled through a Netzsch mill with SEPR, ER 120A 0.8/1.25 mm ceramic beads to a<br>
median particle size of less than about 2 µm. The iron content is then determined, the<br>
promoters are added, and the slurry is spray-dried as in Example 1.<br>
Example 4: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the comparative<br>
method presented in Example 2 except that after the nitric acid is added, the product is milled<br>
through a Netzsch mill with SEPR, ER 120A 0.8/1.25 mm ceramic beads to a median particle<br>
size of less than about 2 µm.<br>
Example 5: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the inventive<br>
method presented herein as follows:<br>
A stainless steel air sparger is fitted into the bottom of a 50 gallon Nalgene drum.<br>
About 36 gallons of deionized water and about 16.5 pounds of formic acid (90%,<br>
commercially available through Specialty Chemical Co. LCC, Cleveland, TN, USA) is added<br>
to the drum and thoroughly mixed. About 40 pounds of iron powder (commercially available<br>
from Pyron, Niagara Falls, NY, USA and designated by product code AC-325) is added to<br>
the formic acid solution with mixing. The iron powder is added slowly enough to maintain a<br>
reaction temperature of less than about 100°F.<br>
After the iron powder is added and a slurry has formed, compressed air is passed<br>
through the sparger. The air flow is continued and the reaction temperature is held at about<br>
100°F until essentially all the free iron is consumed, or for about 24 hours. Unreacted iron<br>
can be detected by XRD.<br>
The iron slurry is milled through aNetzsch mill with SEPR, ER 120A 0.8/1.25 mm<br>
ceramic beads to a median particle size of less than about 2 µm. The iron content in the<br>
slurry is determined using standard techniques known in the art, and promoters are added to<br>
the slurry. Per about 100 g iron in the slurry, Cu(NO3)2' 2 1/2 H2O crystals (commercially<br>
available from Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) or Cu(NO3)2 solution (28% Cu, w/v (SCI plant<br>
material) is added to deliver about 0.5 g copper and potassium nitrate (commercially<br>
available from Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) is added to deliver about 0.2 g K2O. If the<br>
promoters are added as crystals, the crystals may be dissolved in a minimal amount of water<br>
before addition to the slurry.<br>
The slurry is then spray dried with a wheel atomizer (APV Anhydro Spray Drier).<br>
The inlet temperature is set to about 500°F, and the outlet temperature is maintained at about<br>
300°F. A median particle size of 50 to 60 microns (13,000 rpm) is preferred. The spray dried<br>
catalyst is then calcined at about 662°F for 4 hours in a box furnace, and is screened to<br>
remove large particles (-100 or -60 mesh). About 40 pounds of catalyst is produced.<br>
Example 6: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the inventive<br>
method presented in Example 5 except the iron powder AC-325 is replaced by Höganäs AB<br>
(Höganäs, Sweden) ASC-300, and the aeration time is increased to about 48 hours.<br>
Example 7: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the inventive<br>
method presented in Example 5 except the iron powder AC-325 is replaced by Höganäs<br>
ASC-300, and the aeration time is increased to about 48 hours.<br><br>
Example 8: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the inventive<br>
method presented in Example 5 except the formic acid is replaced by acetic acid, and the<br>
aeration time is increased to about 30 hours.<br>
Example 9: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the inventive<br>
method presented in Example 5 except the formic acid is replaced by oxalic acid, and the<br>
aeration time is increased to about 36 hours.<br>
Example 10: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the inventive<br>
method presented in Example 5 except the formic acid is replaced by pyruvic acid, and the<br>
aeration time is increased to about 36 hours.<br>
Example 11: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the inventive<br>
method presented in Example 5 except the formic acid is replaced by glycolic acid, and the<br>
aeration time is increased to about 32 hours.<br>
Example 12: A sample of a Fischer-Trospch catalyst is prepared by the inventive<br>
method presented in Example 5 except the formic acid is replaced by propionic acid, and the<br>
aeration time is increased to about 37 hours.<br>
As previously noted, the amount of water used in the present invention is significantly<br>
less than the amount used in a conventional precipitation method. This can be demonstrated<br>
by comparing, for example, the amount of water used in Example 4 (precipitation method)<br>
and Example 5 (inventive method). As shown in Table I, to prepare the catalyst by the<br>
method of Example 4 requires a water input of about 4836 pounds. To prepare the catalyst<br>
by the method of Example 5 requires about 300 pounds of water, or about 16 times less water<br>
than is used in the method of Example 4.<br>
Further, because the inventive method requires less water as input to the process than the<br>
precipitation method, significantly less waste water is generated. For example, Example 5<br>
generates 299.77 pounds of waste water as compared to Example 4 which generates 4855<br>
pounds of waste water. Moreover the waste water of the present invention is cleaner, that is<br>
it contains essentially no sulfates, nitrates, or chlorides.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 are scanning electron micrographs of catalyst prepared as described in<br>
Examples I and 6, respectively. As is known in the art, the particle shape can affect physical<br>
properties of the catalyst, such as the particle strength and the attrition resistance. Spherical<br>
particles tend to have greater particle strength and are more attrition resistant than non-<br>
spherical particles. The particle size can affect the catalyst properties such as flow<br>
distribution and pressure drop, and for commercial operations particles within a relatively<br>
narrow range are preferred. As shown in Figure 2, the catalyst prepared from iron powder<br>
has an essentially spherical shape and has a relatively narrow particle size distribution range.<br>
By comparison, as shown in Figure 1, the catalyst prepared by the prior art precipitation<br>
method has varied shapes and particle sizes.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention is intended for use in the Fischer-Tropsch<br>
process and has a composition is similar to F-T catalysts of the prior art. However, the<br>
process by which the catalyst is prepared uses less water, generates less waste water, is more<br>
efficient, and produces a finished product essentially free from contaminants and having an<br>
essentially spherical particle shape and relatively small particle size distribution range. It is<br>
understood that the composition of the catalyst and the specific processing conditions may be<br>
varied without exceeding the scope of this development.<br>
