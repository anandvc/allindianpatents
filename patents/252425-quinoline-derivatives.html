				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted quinoline-3-<br>
carboxamide derivatives, to methods for their preparation, to<br>
compositions containing them, and to methods and use for clinical<br>
treatment of diseases resulting from autoimmunity, such as multiple<br>
sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and<br>
psoriasis and, furthermore, diseases where pathologic inflammation<br>
plays a major role, such as asthma, atherosclerosis, stroke and<br>
Alzheimer's disease. More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
novel quinoline derivatives suitable for the treatment of, for example,<br>
multiple sclerosis and its manifestations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Autoimmune diseases, e. g., multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent<br>
diabetes mellitus (IDDM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),<br>
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and<br>
psoriasis represent assaults by the body's immune system which may be<br>
systemic in nature, or else directed at individual organs in the body.<br>
They appear to be diseases in which the immune system makes mistakes<br>
and, instead of mediating protective functions, becomes the aggressor.<br>
Talal, N.: Autoimmune diseases. In: Roitt, I. M. and Delves, P. J. (eds.)<br>
Encyclopedia of Immunology, pp. 195-198. Academic Press, 1992. Auto<br>
immune diseases occupy one end of a spectrum between immunologic<br>
tolerance on the one hand, autoimmunity in the middle and auto<br>
immune disease at the extreme. Immunologic tolerance is defined as the<br>
ability of the organism to discriminate self from nonself in such a way<br>
that an immune responses to self does not occur. We now know that<br>
lymphocytes with receptors for self determinant are present in normal<br>
individuals and can be activated in various ways to produce auto<br><br>
antibodies. In deed, far from failing to react with self, the immune system<br>
depends upon the recognition of self for its proper functioning.<br>
Recognition of self MHC molecules on the cell surface is the basis of<br>
communication between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells as<br>
well as between killer lymphocytes and their cellular targets.<br>
Furthermore, the recognition of idiotypic determinants by anti-idiotypes<br>
creates an important network of immuno regulation vital to the<br>
expansion or suppression of defined lymphocyte subpopulations. Both<br>
positive and negative selection of lymphocytes occurs in the thymus and<br>
has led to new concepts about tolerance and generation of the immune<br>
response. Defects in any of these normal regulatory mechanisms have<br>
been shown to contribute to auto immune disease.<br>
MS is the most common acquired neurologic disease of young adults in<br>
western Europe and North America. It accounts for more disability and<br>
financial loss, both in lost income and in medical care, than any other<br>
neurologic disease of this age group. There are approximately 250.000<br>
cases of MS in the United States.<br>
Although the cause of MS is unknown, advances in brain imaging,<br>
immunology, and molecular biology have increased researchers'<br>
understanding of this disease. Several therapies are currently being used<br>
to treat MS, but no single treatment has demonstrated dramatic<br>
treatment efficacy. Current treatment of MS falls into three categories:<br>
treatment of acute exacerbations, modulation of progressive disease, and<br>
therapy for specific symptoms.<br>
MS affects the central nervous system and involves a demyelination<br>
process, i. e., the myelin sheaths are lost whereas the axons are<br>
preserved. Myelin provides the isolating material that enables rapid nerve<br>
impulse conduction. Evidently, in demyelination, this property is lost.<br>
Although the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for MS are not<br><br>
understood, several lines of evidence indicate that demyelination has an<br>
immunopathologic basis. The pathologic lesions, the plaques, are<br>
characterised by infiltration of immunologically active cells such as<br>
macrophages and activated T cells. Prineas, J. W.: The neuropathology of<br>
multiple sclerosis. In: Koetsier, J. C. (ed.) Handbook of Clinical<br>

There are, however, some serious drawbacks connected to roquinimex.<br>
For example, it has been found to be teratogenic in the rat, and to induce<br><br>
dose-limiting side effects in man, e.g., a flu-like syndrome, which<br>
prevents from using the full clinical potential of the compound.<br>
Further, in WO 92/18483 quinoline derivatives substituted in the 6-<br>
position with a RAS (O)n-group (RA = lower alkyl or aryl; n= 0 - 2) are<br>
claimed, which posses an immunomodulating, anti-inflammatory and<br>
anti-cancer effect.<br>
The substitution, i. e, type and pattern, of the above, specifically<br>
mentioned, compounds in the prior art places them outside the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary objective of the present invention is to provide structurally<br>
novel quinoline compounds which by virtue of their pharmacological<br>
profile, with high potency in experimental models and low level of side-<br>
effects, are considered to be of value in the treatment of disease resulting<br>
from autoimmunity and pathologic inflammation. Examples of such<br>
diseases are multiple sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease and psoriasis and other diseases where inflammation plays a<br>
major role, such as asthma, atherosclerosis, stroke and Alzheimer's<br>
disease. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel<br>
quinoline derivatives suitable for the treatment of, for example, multiple<br>
sclerosis and its manifestations.<br>
The term "treatment" as used herein includes prophylaxis as well as<br>
relieving the symptoms of disease.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the novel compounds of general<br>
formula (I) <br><br>
Wherein<br>
R is selected form methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl and allyl;<br>
R' is selected from methyl, methoxy, fluoro, chloro, bromo,<br>
trifluoromethyl, and OCHxFy,<br>
wherein<br>
x = 0-2,<br>
y = 1 - 3 with the proviso that<br>
x + y = 3;<br>
R" is selected from hydrogen, fluoro and chloro, with the proviso that R"<br>
is selected from fluoro and chloro only when R' is selected from fluoro<br>
and chloro;<br>
R4 is selected from hydrogen and pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic<br>
cations, such as sodium, potassium and calcium, and organic cations<br>
such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, dimethylaminoethanol,<br>
morpholine and the like; R5 is selected from ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl,<br>
methoxy, ethoxy, chloro, bromo, trifluoromethyl, and OCHxFy, and<br>
OCH2CHxFy<br>
wherein<br>
x = 0- 2,<br>
y = 1 - 3 with the proviso that<br>
x + y =3;<br>
R6 is hydrogen; or<br>
R5 and R6 taken together are methylenedioxy;<br><br>
are unexpectedly effective and specific in the treatment of individuals<br>
suffering from autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may exist in different tautomeric<br>
forms and all such forms where such forms exist are included herein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention R4 is selected from hydrogen<br>
or sodium,<br>
R5 is selected from ethyl, methoxy, chloro and trifluoromethyl,<br>
R5 and Re taken together are methylenedioxy,<br>
R is selected from methyl and ethyl,<br>
R' is selected from methoxy, fluoro, chloro and trifluoromethyl when R" is<br>
hydrogen and R" is selected from meta' - and para-fluoro provided that R'<br>
is ortho-fluoro.<br>

Several spontaneously occurring autoimmune diseases in man have<br>
experimental models that are spontaneously occurring in certain strains<br>
of laboratory animals or can be induced in laboratory animals by<br>
immunisation with specific antigen (s) from the target organ.<br>
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model for<br>
autoimmune inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS)<br>
has been the most widely used model for the human disease multiple<br>
sclerosis.<br><br>
Autoimmunity to type II collagen can experimentally be induced in<br>
certain strains of mice or rats and may lead to the development of<br>
polyarthritis. The collagen induced arthritis has several features in<br>
common with the human disorder rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
The hallmark of asthma in humans is an increased reactivity of the<br>
airways to a range of chemical and physical stimuli. It is now widely<br>
accepted that products released from inflammatory cells, e. g., activated<br>
eosinophils, compromise epithelial integrity and promote bronchial<br>
hyperresponsiveness. The murine model of ovalbumin (OA) -induced lung<br>
inflammation is dominated by the temporally regulated influx of<br>
lymphocytes and eosinophils into the bronchial lumen.<br>
Roquinimex has been found to induce the Beagle Pain Syndrome (BPS)<br>
Kelly, D.F., Grimsell, C.S.G. and Kenyon, C.J. Polyarteritis in the dog: A<br>
case report. Vet Record 92: 363-366, 1973.<br>
Harcourt, R.A. Polyarterites in a colony of beagles. Vet Record 102: 519-<br>
522, 1978.<br>
in different breeds of beagle dogs. The disease is reflected by clinical and<br>
laboratory manifestations justifying BPS as a model for the flu-like<br>
syndrome induced by roquinimex in man.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) were assayed for inhibition of acute<br>
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (aEAE) in mice. Roquinimex<br>
was used as treatment control and showed a more than 50% inhibition<br>
at ≥5 mg/kg. Surprising and unexpected results were obtained when<br>
introducing proper substitution in the 5-position of the quinoline ring. In<br>
comparison with roquinimex, the potency of the 5-chloro substituted<br>
compound was increased a 100-fold. Substitution in the 6-, -7, and<br>
8-position resulted in less active compounds. The effect of the 5-<br><br>
substituion could largely be understood on physicochemical grounds. In<br>
general, the EAE activity as seen by the EAE inhibition was in the<br>
following descending order according to the position of the substitution:<br>
5&gt;6&gt;&gt;7=8. The comparison of the effects of 5- and 6-substitution showed<br>
that there is a statistically significant difference on every normal level<br>
(p
superior. Furthermore, proper aromatic substitution in the quinoline<br>
moiety and the 3- carboxamide moiety of the compounds of general<br>
formula (I) significantly reduced or even abolished the side-effects, i. e.,<br>
the teratogenic effects and the BPS, of roquinimex. Thus,<br>
physicochemical properties of the 5-substituent in the quinoline moiety<br>
and the ortho-, meta- and/or, in particular, the para- substituent in the<br>
3-carboxamide moiety are of major importance for an improved<br>
risk/benefit ratio in comparison with roquinimex. Replacement of the<br>
methyl group on the carboxamide nitrogen with a higher alkyl group<br>
reduced the side effects even further. Hence, the compounds of formula<br>
(I) have surprisingly been found to be both chemically and<br>
pharmacologically different from those drugs hitherto suggested for the<br>
treatment of MS and its manifestations.<br>
All embodiments of the invention as disclosed in the claims are herewith<br>
included in the specification.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention without<br>
restricting the scope thereof.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by methods<br>
known in the literature and the following methods:<br><br><br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by known<br>
methods and, for example, as shown above, by reaction of an ester<br>
derivative of the quinoline carboxylic acid with an aniline in a suitable<br>
solvent such as toluene, xylene and the like. General methods for<br>
preparation of the quinoline carboxylic acid ester derivatives of formula<br>
(II) are described below. N-alkylated anilines of formula (III) are<br>
commercially available or known from literature, e. g., in Johnstone et al,<br>
J. Chem. Soc. 1969,2223-2224. Compounds falling within the scope of<br>
formula (III) may be prepared by methods, which are generally analogous<br>
to those of said literature.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be prepared by reaction of a<br>
quinoline carboxylic acid of formula (IV) with an aniline of formula (III).<br>
Various coupling reagents known in the art may be used, e.g.,<br>
carbodiimides known from literature in US Pat. No. 4,547, 511. One<br>
suitable coupling method utilises thionyl chloride in the presence of<br>
triethylamine and a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. This<br>
method may be used in instances when direct coupling between ester<br><br>
and aniline does not work, e.g., when the aniline contains electron<br>
withdrawing substituents. The quinoline carboxylic acids of formula (IV)<br>
may be obtained from the corresponding esters of formula (II) by acidic<br>
hydrolysis as described below.<br>
Example 1<br>
1,2-Dihydro-4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic<br>
acid ethyl ester.<br>
To a solution of 2,6-Difluorobensonitril (42 g, 0.30 mol) in 150 ml of<br>
anhydrous methanol sodium methoxide (17.9 g, 0.33 mol) was slowly<br>
added at 30°C. After being heated under reflux for 1 hour, aqueous 40%<br>
methylamine (133 ml, 1.2 mol) was added and the resulting solution<br>
refluxed for 4 days. On cooling, a white solid, 2-methoxy-6-(methylamino)<br>
bensonitrile, precipitated which was collection by filtration. The<br>
precipitate was dissolved in an aqueous solution of ethylene glycol (500<br>
ml) and potassium hydroxide (14g). The solution was refluxed at 150°C<br>
over night, cooled to room temperature and the pH adjusted to 4 with<br>
cone, hydrochloric acid. The anthranilic acid formed was collected by<br>
filtration, washed with water (50 ml) and dried under vacuum. The 6-<br>
methoxy-N-methyl-anthranilic acid (32g, 0.18 mol), and sodium<br>
bicarbonate (38g, 0.45 mol) were suspended in 500 ml of 1,4-dioxane.<br>
Phosgene (25 ml, 0.45 mol) was slowly added under cooling in an ice<br>

Pharmacological methods<br>
Acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (aEAE).<br><br>
SJL/N female mice, 8 weeks of age, were used for the experiments.<br>
Mouse spinal cord homogenate (MSCH) was obtained from 8 to 12<br>
weeks-old C57B1/6 female mice. The tissue was homogenized on ice and<br>
diluted in cold PBS. Incomplete Freud's containing 1 mg/ml M<br>
tuberculosis hominis H37Ra was emulsified with an equal volume of<br>
MSCH to give a final concentration of 10 mg/ml of MSCH. The inoculum<br>
volume of 0.1 ml was injected intra-dermally at the base of the tail.<br>
Pertussis toxin was injected i.p. at day 0 to 3 after immunization.<br>
Treatment was given per os daily either at day 3 to 12 post-immunization<br>
or days 3 to 7 and 10 to 12. Control animals received saline. The<br>
animals, eight per dose group, were scored for clinical signs of paralytic<br>
disease on a scale from 0 to 5 in the following way: 0, normal; 1, limp<br>
tail; 2, hind limb paresis; 3 hind limb paralysis and limp foreleg; 4,<br>
bilateral bind and force limb paralysis; 5, death. Clinical scores were<br>
monitored at day 7 and daily from day 9 until the end of the experiment<br>
at day 14. Treatment effects were calculated as percent inhibition of<br>
clinical scores compared to saline treated controls.<br>
Collagen induced arthritis<br>
DBA/1 male mice between 8 to 10 weeks of age were used for the<br>
experiments. On day 0 the mice were immunized intradermally at the<br>
base of the tail with bovine type II collagen (100 µg/mouse) in Freund's<br>
complete adjuvant. The treatment was given per os daily on days 3 to<br>
7,10 to 14,17 to 21,24 to 28 and 31 to 35. Fifteen days after<br>
immunization mice were inspected for signs of arthritis. The animals<br>
were inspected three times a week. Every second or third day individual<br>
paws of the arthritic animals were scored by a scale from 0-4 (0 = no<br>
arthritis, 1 = arthritis in one of the interphalangeal, metatarsophalangeal<br>
or intercarpal joints, 2 = two arthritic joints, 3 = three arthritic joints, 4 =<br>
as in 3 but with more severe redness and swelling of the paw). The score<br><br>
for each paw was added to give a maximal attainable score of 16 for each<br>
mouse.<br>
Ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation<br>
C57B1/6 female mice between 10 to 14 weeks of age were used for the<br>
experiments, 10 mice/group. The mice were sensitized with ovalbumin<br>
(OA) in aluminium hydroxide in a volume of 0.2 ml inoculated ip.<br>
Treatment was given at day 0 to day 16. Control mice received saline.<br>
Fourteen days after the OA sensitization mice were exposed for 20<br>
minutes to an aerosol of 1.5% w/v of OA in saline produced by a<br>
nebulizer. Vehicle-challenged control mice were exposed to saline.<br>
Seventy-two hours after OA/vehicle challenge, mice were anaesthetised<br>
and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by instilling 0.5 ml ice-cold<br>
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into the lungs twice. Total cell counts<br>
were determined and differential counts were made based on<br>
identification of eosinophils, monocytes/alveolar macrophages,<br>
lymphocytes and neutrophils. Eosinophil infiltration into the lung tissue<br>
was evaluated by histochemical methods on frozen lung sections using<br>
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB).<br>
Teratogenic effects in the rat<br>
The compounds were administrated subcutaneously to female rats<br>
during pregnancy, i. e., day 8 to 14 of pregnancy. The rats were<br>
caesarean sectioned and necropsied on day 20 after fertilisation. The<br>
foetuses were examined for external and internal abnormalities.<br>
Beagle Pain Syndrome (BPS)<br>
The compounds were administrated intravenously to beagle dogs. The<br>
dosage was given for five consecutive days. The dogs were evaluated for<br>
clinical and laboratory signs of the pain syndrome, e. g., fever, increased<br><br>
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alkaline phosphate (AP), induction<br>
of acute phase proteins and vasculitis.<br>
Among preferred compounds are N-methyl-N-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)<br>
