				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Method and system are disclosed for reducing mutual EM coupling between VCO resonators and for implementing the same on a single semiconductor chip. The method and system involve using inductors that are substantially symmetrical about their horizontal and/or their vertical axes and providing current to the inductors in a way so that the resulting magnetic field components tend to cancel each other by virtue of the symmetry. In addition, two such inductors may be placed near each other and oriented in a way so that the induced current in the second inductor due to the magnetic field originating from first inductor is significantly reduced. The inductors may be 8-shaped, four-leaf clover-shaped, single-turn, multi-turn, rotated relative to one another, and/or vertically offset relative to one another. This Abstract is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims.</td>

tetrafluoroethoxy)-phenyl, 3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl or 4-phenoxyphenyl.As it is known for the person skilled in the art, compounds comprising nitrogen atoms can form N-oxides. Particularly, imine nitrogen, especially heterocyclic or heteroaromatic imine nitrogen, or pyridine-type nitrogen (=N-) atoms, can be N-oxidized to form the N-oxides comprising the group =N*(O-)-. Thus, the compounds according to the present invention comprising the imine nitrogen atom in position 5 of the phenylphe-nanthridine backbone and, optionally (depending on the meaning of the substituents), one or more further nitrogen atoms suitable to exist in the N-oxide state (=N+(O)-) may be capable to form (depending on the number of nitrogen atoms suitable to form stabile N-oxides) mono-N-oxides, bis-N-oxides or multi-N-oxides, or mixtures thereof.The term N-oxide(s) as used in this invention therefore encompasses all possible, and in particular all stabile, N-oxide forms, such as mono-N-oxides, bis-N-oxides or multi-N-oxides, or mixtures thereof in any mixing ratio.Possible salts for compounds of the formula I -depending on substitution- are all acid addition salts or all salts with bases. Particular mention may be made of the pharmacologically tolerable salts of the inorganic and organic acids and bases customarily used in pharmacy. Those suitable are, on the one hand, water-insoluble and, particularly, water-soluble acid addition salts with acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, D-gluconic acid, benzoic acid, 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, butyric acid, sulfosalicylic acid, maleic acid, lauric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, embonic acid, stearic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid or 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, it being possible to employ the acids in salt preparation - depending on whether a mono- or polybasic acid is concerned and depending on which salt is desired - in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.On the other hand, salts with bases are also suitable. Examples of salts with bases which may be mentioned are alkali metal (lithium, sodium, potassium) or calcium, aluminum, magnesium, titanium, ammonium, meglumine or guanidinium salts, where here too the bases are employed in salt preparation in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.Pharmacologically intolerable salts which can initially be obtained, for example, as process products in the preparation of the eompounds according to the invention on an industrial scale are converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts by processes known to the person skilled in the art. It is known to the person skilled in the art that the compounds according to the invention and their salts, when they are isolated, for example, in crystalline form, can contain various amounts of solvents. The invention therefore also comprises all solvates and in particular all hydrates of the compounds of the formula I, and also all solvates and in particular all hydrates of the salts of the compounds of the formula I.The substituents R6 and R7 of compounds of formula I can be attached in the ortho, meta or para position with respect to the binding position in which the 6-phenyl ring is bonded to the phenanthridine ring system, whereby preference is given to the attachement in the meta or in the para position.ln another embodiment, R7 is hydrogen, and R6 is bonded to the meta or para position.Compounds of formula I more worthy to be mentioned are those in which either, in a first aspect (aspect 1) according to the present invention,<br>

In the first reaction step in reaction scheme 3, the nitro group of compounds of the formula Vlllb, in which R1, R2, R3, R31 and R4 have the meanings indicated in embodiment b above, is reduced to obtain corresponding compounds of the formula Vllb. Said reduction reaction is carried out in a manner known to the person skilled in the art, for example as described in J. Org. Chem. 1962, 27,4426 or as described in the following examples. More specifically, the reduction can be carried out, for example, by contacting compounds of the formula Vlllb with a hydrogen-producing mixture such as, preferably, metallic zinc in a mildly acidic medium such as acetic acid in a lower alcohol such as methanol or ethanol at room temperature or at elevated temperature or, preferably, at the boiling temperature of the solvent mixture. Alternatively, the reduction can be carried out by selective reduction of the nitro group in a manner known to the person skilled in the art, for example by hydrogen transfer reaction in the presence of a metal catalyst, for example palladium or preferably Raney nickel, in a suitable solvent, preferably a lower alcohol, using, for example ammonium formiate or preferably hydrazine hydrate as hydrogen donor.Compounds of the formula Vllb obtained can be reacted, for example, as described by way of example in the following examples with compounds of the formula III, in which R6 and R7 have the<br>

Exemplary amide bond linking reagents known to the person skilled in the art which may be mentioned are, for example, the carbodiimides (e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or, preferably, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride), azodicarboxylic acid derivatives (e.g. diethyl azodicarboxylate), uranium salts [e.g. O-(benzotriazoM-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate or 0-(benzotriazol-1yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramthyl-uronium-hexafluorophosphate] and N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole.

Thus the configuration of the carbon atom in position 1 of compounds of the formula IVb can be optionally inverted. Said inversion of configuration of position 1 of compounds of the formula IVb can be achieved in a manner familiar to the person skilled in the art, for example by derivatization of position 1 with a suitable leaving group and subsequent replacement of said leaving group by a suitable nucleophile in a nucleophilic substitution reaction according to SN2 mechanism.

The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his/her expert knowledge with the reaction conditions which are specifically necessary for carrying out the N-oxidation.lt is moreover known to the person skilled in the art that if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T. Greene and P.

hydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low-molecular-weight aliphatic alcohol, such as ethanol or isopropanol) which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is then added.

Biological investigations<br>
The second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) is well-known for inhibiting inflammatory and immunocompetent cells. The PDE4 isoenzyme is broadly expressed in cells involved in the initiation and propagation of inflammatory diseases (H Tenor and C Schudt, in ..Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors", 21-40, „The Handbook of Immunopharmacology", Academic Press, 1996), and its inhibition leads to an increase of the intracellular cAMP concentration and thus to the inhibition of cellular activation (JE Souness et al., Immunopharmacology 47: 127-162, 2000).The antiinflammatory potential of PDE4 inhibitors in vivo in various animal models has been described (MM Teixeira, TiPS 18:164-170,1997). For the investigation of PDE4 inhibition on the cellular level (in vitro), a large variety of proinflammatory responses can be measured. Examples are the superoxide production of neutrophilic (C Schudt et al., Arch Pharmacol 344: 682-690,1991) or eosinophilic (A Hatzelmann et al., Brit J Pharmacol 114: 821-831, 1995) granulocytes, which can be measured as luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence, or the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-a in monocytes, macrophages or dendritic cells (Gantner et al., Brit J Pharmacol 121: 221-231,1997, and Pulmonary Pharmacol Therap 12:377-386,1999). In addition, the immunomodulatory potential of PDE4 inhibitors is evident from the inhibition of T-cell responses like cytokine synthesis or proliferation (DM Essayan, Biochem Pharmacol 57: 965-973, 1999). Substances which inhibit the secretion of the afore-mentioned proinflammatory mediators are those which inhibit PDE4. PDE4 inhibition by the compounds according to the invention is thus a central indicator for the suppression of inflammatory processes.<br>
 Methods for measuring inhibition of PDE4 activity<br>
The PDE4B2 (GB no. M97515) was a gift of Prof. M. Conti (Stanford University, USA). It was amplified from the original plasmid (pCMV5) via PCR with primers Rb9 (5'- GCCAGCGTGCAAATAATGAAGG -3') and Rb10 (5'-AGAGGGGGATTATGTATCCAC -3') and cloned into the pCR-Bac vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, NLJ.The recombinant baculovirus was prepared by means of homologous recombination in SI-"9 insect cells. The expression plasmid was cotrans-fected with Bac-N-Blue (Invitrogen, Groningen, NL) or Baculo-Gold DNA (Pharmingen, Hamburg) using a standard protocol (Pharmingen, Hamburg). Wt virus-free recombinant virus supernatant was selected using plaque assay methods. After that, high-titre virus supernatant was prepared by amplifying 3 times. PDE: was expressed in SF21 cells by infecting 2x106 cells/ml with an MOI (multiplicity of infection) between 1 and 10 in serum-free SF900 medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The cells were cultured at 28°C for 48 - 72 hours, after which they were pelleted for 5-10 min at 1000 g and 4°C.The SF21 insect cells were resuspended, at a concentration of approx. 107 cells/ml, in ice-cold (4°C) homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris, pH8.2, containing the following additions: 140 mM NaCI, 3.8 mM KCI, 1 mM EGTA, ImMMgCk, 10 mM p-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM benzamidine, 0.4 mM Pefablock, 10 (.iM leupeptin, 10 yM pepstatin A, 5 u,M trypsin inhibitor) and disrupted by ultrasonication. The homogenate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000xg and the supernatant was stored at -80°C until subsequent use (see below). The protein content was determined by the Bradford method (BioRad, Munich) using BSA as the standard.PDE4B2 activity is inhibited by the said compounds in a modified SPA (scintillation proximity assay) test, supplied by Amersham Biosciences (see procedural instructions "phosphodiesterase [3H]cAMP SPA enzyme assay, code TRKQ 7090"), carried out in 96-well microtitre plates (MTP's). The test volume is 100 u.l and contains 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg of BSA (bovine serum albumin)/ml, 5 mM Mg2*, 0.5 \M cAMP (including about 50,000 cpm of [3H]cAMP), 1 (J of the respective substance dilution in DMSO and sufficient recombinant PDE (1000xg supernatant, see above) to ensure that 10-20% of the cAMP is converted under the said experimental conditions. The final concentration of DMSO in the assay (1 % v/v) does not substantially affect the activity of the PDE investigated. After a preincubation of 5 min at 37°C, the reaction is started by adding the substrate (cAMP) and the assay is incubated for a further<br>

pematant, see above) to ensure that 10-20% of the cAMP is converted under the said experimental conditions. The final concentration of DMSO in the assay (1 % v/v) does not substantially affect the activity of the PDE investigated. After a preincubation of 5 min at 37°C, the reaction is started by adding the substrate (cAMP) and the assay is incubated for a further 15 min- after that, it is stopped by adding SPA beads (50 nl). In accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, the SPA beads had previously been resuspended in water, but were then diluted 1:3 (v/v) in water; the diluted solution also contains 3 mM IBMX to ensure a complete PDE activity stop. After the beads have been sedimented (&gt; 30 min), the MTP's are analyzed in commercially available luminescence detection devices. The corresponding ICso values of the compounds for the inhibition of PDE activity are determined from the concentration-effect curves by means of non-linear regres-sion.Representative inhibitory values determined for the compounds according to the invention follow from the following table A, in which the numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the Examples.<br>
