				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The field of the invention relates to the novel processes for the preparation of amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride, an useful antianginal agent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ivabradine hydrochloride of formula I, have very valuable pharmacological and therapeutic properties, and are useful in many cardiovascular diseases such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarct and associated rhythm disturbances and is chemically known as (S)-7,8-dimethoxy-3-{3-{N-[(4,5-dimethoxybenzocyclobut-l-yl)methyl]-N-(methyl)amino)propyl)-l,3,4,5- tetrahydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one hydrochloride.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula I<br>
Ivabradine hydrochloride is first disclosed in US patent 5,296,482 and is prepared by hydrogenating benzazepine intermediate of formula II to ivabradine,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula II<br>
which is then treated with aqueous hydrochloric acid.<br>
Benzazepine intermediate of formula II used for the preparation of ivabradine is<br>
prepared by condensing methylamine derivative of formula III,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula III<br>
with 7,8-dimethoxy-3-[3-iodopropyl]-l,3-dihydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one of formula IV in presence of base in acetone and purified by column chromatography.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula IV<br>
However the process suffers from major drawbacks. The chromatographic technique for purification is cumbersome, tedious and difficult to utilize on industrial scale. Use of highly flammable and large quantities of organic solvent in the preparation of benzazepine intermediate of formula II makes this process unattractive for large scale production.<br>
It is, therefore, desirable to provide an efficient, more economical, less hazardous and eco-friendly process for the preparation of highly pure ivabradine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt where impurity formation is less and hence avoids chromatographic purification and is convenient to operate on a commercial scale. Further, US patent 5,296,482 discloses the process for the preparation of ivabradine only; however the patent is silent about the processes for the preparation of its salts.<br>
US patent 7,176,197 reports alpha crystalline form of ivabradine hydrochloride. Several other crystalline forms such as beta, gamma, delta, beta-d, gamma-d and delta-d are also reported by Les Laboratories. There is no data available in the prior art for the existence of amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride although we have disclosed amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride in our pending Indian patent application No. 1157/DEL/2007.<br>
Crystalline solids normally require a significant amount of energy for dissolution due to their highly organized, lattice like structures. For example, the energy required for a drug molecule to escape from a crystal is more than from an amorphous or a non-crystalline form. It is known that the amorphous forms in a number of drugs exhibit different dissolution characteristics and in some cases different bioavailability patterns compared to the crystalline form (Econno T., Chem. Phazm Bull., 1990; 38: 2003-2007).<br>
For some therapeutic indications, one bioavai lability pattern may be favoured over another. An amorphous form of cefuroxime axietil is an example of one amorphous drug exhibiting much higher bioavailability than the crystalline forms, which leads to the selection of the amorphous form as the final drug substance for cefuroxime axietil pharmaceutical dosage form development. Additionally, the aqueous solubility of crystalline atorvastatin calcium is lower than its amorphous form, which may result in the difference in their in vivo bioavailability. Therefore, it is desirable to have amorphous forms of drugs with high purity to meets the needs of regulatory agencies and also highly reproducible processes for their preparation.<br>
It is, however, possible to provide methods that have successfully and selectively produced ivabradine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and ivabradine hydrochloride in amorphous form.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant invention relates to an efficient and industrially advantageous process for the preparation of highly pure ivabradine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and particularly amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, benzazepine intermediate of formula II is prepared by condensing methylamine derivative of formula III with<br>
7,8-dimethoxy-3-[3-iodopropyl]-l,3-dihydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one of formula IV in demineralized water and in presence of base.<br>
The condensation reaction is carried out at 45-60Â°C preferably at 50-55Â°C and it takes 10-20 hours for completion of reaction. The progress of reaction is monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The product is extracted in lower aliphatic ester solvent such as ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate layer is further treated with aqueous acidic solution and the resulting layers are separated. The aqueous layer is treated with basic solution and the product is extracted in lower aliphatic ester solvent such as ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate layer is removed by known methods such as evaporation, distillation with or without vacuum etc to get benzazepine intermediate of formula II.<br>
The base is used in the condensation step can be selected from alkali metal carbonates, bicarbonates and hydroxides and preferably potassium carbonate.<br>
Major advantages realized in the above process is that the use of water as a solvent, avoiding the use of organic solvents, is to provide an economical, less hazardous and more eco-friendly process to prepare benzazepine intermediate of formula II as compared to the prior art processes. Further the condensation reaction in water produced highly pure benzazepine intermediate of formula II which does not require any further purification and avoid the use of column chromatography.<br>
Benzazepine intermediate of formula II prepared is hydrogenated and converted into highly pure ivabradine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to the preparation of highly pure amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride from ivabradine through ivabradine acid addition salts. Specifically the ivabradine is treated with a solution of organic acid in solvent selected from lower aliphatic ketone such as acetone; ester such as ethyl acetate and nitrile such as acetonitrile to prepare ivabradine acid addition salt.<br>
The organic acid can be selected from acetic acid, propionic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, methanesulphonic acid, isethionic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, toluene sulphonic acid and the like. Preferably the acid is selected from oxalic acid, citric acid, methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, toluene sulphonic acid and most preferably the acid is oxalic acid.<br>
Particularly the ivabradine oxalate is prepared by treating ivabradine with oxalic acid in acetone and reaction mass is stirred at ambient temperature for sufficient tine to prepare the oxalate salt. The oxalate salt is isolated by filtration and optionally recrystallized in acetonitrile to isolate pure ivabradine oxalate. The ivabradine oxalate is isolated as crystalline solid and may be characterized by at least one of Karl Fisher or TGA, X-Ray power diffraction (XRD), or differential scan calorimetry (DSC).<br>
Crystalline ivabradine oxalate is characterized by powder x-ray diffraction peaks at about 2.04, 2.13, 4.26, 7.06, 8.02, 8.53, 9.32, 10.91, 13.63, 15.07, 16.11, 16.44, 17.48, 18.37, 19.32, 20.38, 20.94, 21.95, 23.61, 24.26, 27.54 and 33.07 degrees two theta, substantially as depicted in Figure 3.<br>
Crystalline ivabradine oxalate is further characterized by a differential scanning calorimetry ("DSC") thermogram, which shows one endothermic peak around 110Â°C due to melting, substantially as depicted in Figure 4.<br>
It is advantageous to purify the acid addition salt of ivabradine by known methods such as crystallization or slurring in suitable solvent to remove the unwanted impurities. Preferably, the isolated acid addition salt of ivabradine is recrystallized in a suitable organic solvent such as acetonitrile<br>
Acid addition salt of ivabradine is hydrolyzed with a suitable base in demineralized water to get ivabradine.<br>
The base can be selected from sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate and preferably sodium hydroxide is used. After complete hydrolysis, the desired compound is extracted in organic solvent. The organic solvent can be selected from halogenated hydrocarbon and aliphatic esters and preferably ethyl acetate is used. Ethyl acetate is distilled out to isolate the ivabradine as an oil. Crude ivabradine is further dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as acetone, ethyl acetate preferably in acetone. The pH of the resulting clear solution is adjusted to 1.0 to 2.0 with alcoholic hydrogen chloride and stirred for 30 to 60 minutes to get highly pure amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride. It is advantageous to dry the organic layer using drying agent such as sodium sulphate or the like before adding alcoholic hydrogen chloride.<br>
Amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride is isolated by removing the solvent from the reaction mixture by known methods such as evaporation, distillation with or without vacuum etc.<br>
Optionally the amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride is further stirred for 30 to 60 minutes in a suitable organic solvent such as n-heptane, n-hexane and cyclohexane then filtered and washed with same organic solvent to get amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention is provided a process for the preparation of amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride by dissolving ivabradine hydrochloride in a mixture of lower alkanol and ketone at ambient temperature and further heated to 40-50Â°C, distilling out the solvent under vaccum, isolating amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride.<br>
The lower alkanol can be selected from methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol and preferably methanol is used. The ketone can be selected from acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and preferably acetone is used. Mixture of lower alkanol and ketone is used in a ratio of 1: 2-6 (v/v) more preferably 1:3 (v/v) and most preferably 1:2 (v/v).<br>
Specifically ivabradine hydrochloride is dissolved in a mixture of methanol and acetone by simple stirring at room temperature without using prior heating.<br>
Amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride is isolated by removing the solvent from the reaction mixture by known methods such as evaporation, distillation with or without vacuum etc.<br>
Alternatively the isolation of highly pure amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride is carried out by stirring the amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride in a suitable organic solvent such as n-heptane, n-hexane and cyclohexane for about 30 to 60 minutes then filtered and washed with same organic solvent to get highly pure amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride.<br>
In still yet another aspect of the present invention amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride can also be prepared by catalytically hydrogenating the benzazepine intermediate of formula II using palladium on carbon catalyst in acetic acid under hydrogen pressure of 1-7 kg. The hydrogenation reaction is conducted at ambient temperature and it takes 4-10 hours for completion of reaction, which is monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The catalyst is filtered out and acetic acid is removed by distillation from the filtrate. The residue is taken up in demineralized water and hydrochloric acid, adding a lower aliphatic ester solvent such as ethyl acetate. The layers are separated and aqueous layer is washed with lower aliphatic ester solvent such as ethyl acetate. Aqueous layer is further treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide and the product is extracted in lower aliphatic ester solvent such as ethyl acetate.<br>
Multiple extractions are desired to extract the product completely in lower aliphatic ester solvent.<br>
Optionally ethyl acetate is distilled out to isolate the ivabradine as an oil, otherwise organic layer of ethyl acetate itself is treated with a solution of organic acid in lower aliphatic ketone such as acetone, ethyl acetate or acetonitrile at 20-30Â°C for 2-5 hours to prepare ivabradine acid addition salt.<br>
If ivabradine is isolated as an oily residue then it is further dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as acetone, acetonitrile or ethyl acetate and preferably in ethyl acetate before treating it with a solution of organic acid. The organic acid can be selected from the group as given above.<br>
Acid addition salt of ivabradine is hydrolyzed with a suitable base in demineralized water to get ivabradine.<br>
The base can be selected from sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate and preferably sodium hydroxide is used.<br>
After complete hydrolysis, the desired compound is extracted in organic solvent. The organic solvent can be selected from halogenated hydrocarbon and aliphatic esters and preferably ethyl acetate is used. Ethyl acetate is distilled out to isolate the ivabradine as oil, which is further dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as acetone, ethyl acetate preferably in acetone. The pH of the resulting clear solution is adjusted to 1.0 to 2.0 with alcoholic hydrogen chloride and stirred for 30 to 60 minutes to get highly pure amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride. It is advantageous to dry the organic layer of ethyl acetate using drying agent such as sodium sulphate or the like before adding alcoholic hydrogen chloride.<br>
The alcohol used in the solution of alcohol-hydrogen chloride is selected from C1-C4 branched or linear aliphatic alcohols and more preferably the solvent is methanol, ethanol, propanol, n-butanol or isopropanol and most preferably the<br>
solvent is methanol. In general, a solution of alcohol-hydrogen chloride is prepared by purging dry hydrogen chloride in alcohol by following the methods reported in prior art. The percentage of hydrogen chloride in alcohol is preferably selected between 10-25%.<br>
Amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride is isolated by removing the solvent from the reaction mixture by known methods such as distillation, filtration etc.<br>
Optionally the amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride is further stirred for 30 to 60 minutes in a suitable organic solvent such as n-heptane, n-hexane and cyclohexane then filtered and washed with same organic solvent to get highly pure amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride.<br>
The precipitated amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride is isolated in high yield and purity of greater than 99.8 % area by HPLC. XRD pattern shows that material is amorphous in nature, substantially as depicted in Figure 1.<br>
Amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride is further characterized by a differential scanning calorimetry ("DSC") thermogram, which shows one endothermic peak around 194Â°C due to melting, substantially as depicted in Figure 2.<br>
Amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride is obtained by the described process may have a purity of at least 99.6% area by HPLC, more preferably, of at least 99.7%, and even more preferably, of at least 99.9% area by HPLC.<br>
X-ray diffraction of amorphous ivabradine hydrochloride and crystalline ivabradine oxalate are measured on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer with Cu radiation and expressed in terms of two-theta, d-spacings and relative intensities. One of the ordinary skills in the art understands that experimental differences may arise due to differences in instrumentation, sample preparation or other factors.<br>
DSC analysis was performed using a Mettler Toledo 822 Star6. The crucible was crimped and punched prior to analysis. The weight of the samples was about 4-6 mg; the samples were scanned at a rate of 5Â°C/min from 30Â°C to 250Â°C. The oven was constantly purged with nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 80 mL/min. Standard 40 \il aluminum crucibles covered by lids with one hole were used.<br>
