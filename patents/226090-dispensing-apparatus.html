				<td> DISPENSING APPARATUS<br>
The present invention relates to a dispensing<br>
apparatus, in particular but not exclusively, a dispensing<br>
apparatus for dispensing medicaments.<br>
Dispensing apparatus are known for use in dispensing<br>
medicaments. The medicaments dispensed may be any of a wide<br>
range of known substances. Many such medicaments may be<br>
harmful if taken in too large a quantity or by the wrong<br>
person. Consequently, many medicaments are only available<br>
via prescription from an authorised medical practitioner.<br>
Prescribed medicaments of this type are prescribed to<br>
specific individuals and at certain dosage levels. Some<br>
medicaments, especially those used for pain relief, may be<br>
extremely harmful if taken in too large a quantity or by the<br>
wrong person. Further it may be desired to prescribe certain<br>
medications to specific patients whilst preventing their<br>
ready use by other persons who may come into contact with<br>
the dispensing apparatus. According to the present<br>
invention there is provided a dispensing apparatus<br>
comprising a housing having a first part and a second part<br>
together defining an interior of the housing for receiving a<br>
dispensing container, the first and second part being<br>
movable from an open position to permit insertion of said<br>
dispensing container into the interior of the housing to a<br>
closed position in which removal of said dispensing<br>
container from the interior of the housing is prevented, -the<br>
dispensing apparatus further comprising a mouthpiece which<br>
is removably connectable to the housing; when connected to<br>
the housing the mouthpiece defines an outlet for a product<br>
dispensed, in use, from said dispensing container and, when<br>
the mouthpiece is disconnected from the housing, the first<br>
and second parts substantially enclose the interior to<br>
prevent access to and removal of said dispensing container<br>
received in the interior, wherein the housing further<br>
comprises a channel which receives and contains, in use, a<br>
valve stem of the dispensing container, wherein, with the<br>
mouthpiece connected to the housing, the channel<br>
communicates with a valve stem receiving block of the mouthpiece.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention allows for a<br>
dispensing device to be provided with a removable mouthpiece<br>
whilst still securely retaining the dispensing container<br>
within the housing even when the mouthpiece is disconnected.<br>
The dispensing device is thus suitable for use in dispensing<br>
controlled or potentially harmful medicaments.<br>
In one embodiment, the mouthpiece comprises a socket<br>
and the housing comprises a stem portion forming a push-fit<br>
with the socket of the mouthpiece. Alternatively, the<br>
mouthpiece may comprise a stem portion and the housing a<br>
socket forming a push-fit with the stem portion of the<br>
mouthpiece. In another embodiment, the mouthpiece and<br>
housing are connected by means of a bayonet fitting. In<br>
another, the mouthpiece and housing are connected by means<br>
of a screw thread.<br>
Optionally the first and second parts are pivoted<br>
relative to one another.<br>

The first embodiment of the dispensing device of the<br>
present invention is shown in Figures 1 to 17. This<br>
embodiment is particularly suitable for a reusable device.<br>
As shown ;n Figure 1, the dispensing device generally<br>
comprises an actuator 1 in which is received a pressurised<br>
dispensing container containing a medicament or other<br>
substance which is to be dispensed. The actuator 1<br>
comprises a housing formed from a front case 2 and a rear<br>
case 3, a mouthpiece 4 and a dust cap 5.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the front case 2 comprises a body<br>
portion 12 having the general form of an open channel having<br>
two side walls 18 extending from a rear wall 19. An<br>
interior of the front case 2 is provided with a chassis 16<br>
formed integrally with the front case 2 and to which other<br>
components of the actuator 1 are fixed during assembly. A<br>
portion of the chassis 16 forms a canister seat guide rail<br>
11, the use of which will be discussed below. At one end of<br>
the front case 2 there is provided a first portion 13 of a<br>
hinge. Two apertures 10 are formed in the side walls 18<br>
approximately midway along the length of the front case 2.<br>
The front case comprises an aperture for receiving an LCD<br>
screen 15 as shown in Figure 1. A data port 14 may also be<br>
provided in the front case 2 as shown in Figure 13, the use<br>
of which will be discussed below.<br>
The rear case 20 comprises a body portion 21 having at<br>
one end a top portion 20 and at the other end a stem portion<br>
24 terminating in a conical portion 25 shown in Figure 10.<br>
On or near the stem portion 24 there is provided a second<br>
portion 22 of a hinge. During assembly the first portion<br>
13 of the hinge and the second portion 22 of the hinge<br>
cooperate with one another to pivotally join the front case<br>
2 and the rear case 3 together. Preferably the first<br>
portion 13 arid the second portion 22 of the hinge are<br>
permanently pivoted together by means of a through bolt or<br>
similar. The top portion 20 of the rear case 3 is provided<br>
with a plurality of air inlet holes 26. An internal face of<br>
the top portion 20 is also provided with a locking recess 23<br>
as best shown in Figure 7.<br>
The mouthpiece 4 is detachable from the front case 2<br>
and rear case 3 . According to the present invention the<br>
front case 2 and rear case 3 are shaped such that even with<br>
the mouthpiece 4 detached from the housing the interior of<br>
the housing containing the dispensing container 100 and<br>
trigger mechanism is not accessible as shown in Figures 10,<br>
12 and 13. In particular, this prevents removal of the<br>
pressurised dispensing container 100 and also the insertion<br>
of foreign members into the interior of the housing and thus<br>
prevents tampering with the container, especially the valve<br>
stem. With the mouthpiece 4 removed, it is not possible to<br>
actuate the dispensing container either by depressing the<br>
valve stem or by operating the user interface. The<br>
detachable mouthpiece may more easily be washed without the<br>
risk of exposing the electronic components of the device to<br>
water. In addition, the mouthpiece only may be replaced if<br>
the device is to be subsequently used by another user. The<br>
mouthpiece 4 comprises a body 30 defining a mouthpiece<br>
outlet 31 directed generally laterally and a socket 34 which<br>
may be connected during assembly with the stem portion 24 of<br>
the rear case 3. The connection may be by means of a push<br>
fitting, a bayonet fitting, a screw threaded fitting or<br>
similar. An interior of the mouthpiece 4 is provided with a<br>
valve stem receiving block which communicates with a channel<br>
formed in the rear case 3 which itself contains the valve<br>
stem of the pressurised container 100. The valve stem block<br>
comprises an orifice for directing medicament dispensed from<br>
the pressurised dispensing container towards the outlet 31<br>
of the mouthpiece 4 in a conventional manner.<br>
The dust cap 5 comprises a mouthpiece cover 40 which is<br>
shaped to be received over and to cover the outlet 31 of the<br>
mouthpiece 4 and also preferably those areas of the<br>
mouthpiece 4 contacted in use by a user's mouth. The dust<br>
cap 5 further comprises two elongate arms 41 which extend<br>
from the mouthpiece cover 40 and are provided at the distal<br>
end with two inwardly directed bosses 42. The bosses 42<br>
have a non-circular shape forming a cam surface.<br>
Alternatively, each boss 42 may be provided with an<br>
eccentrically positioned peg as described below with<br>
reference to the second embodiment. The dust cap 5 is<br>
assembled with the front case 2 by means of insertion of the<br>
bosses 42 through the apertures 10.<br>
The actuator 1 is provided with a PCS (Printed Circuit<br>
Board) 6 which is connected to the chassis 16 of the front<br>
case 2. The PCB 6 is provided with a number of switches 93,<br>
a battery 94, a control processor 95 and the LCD 15.<br>
The actuator 1 is further provided with a trigger<br>
mechanism 7 which is housed in an end of the actuator 1<br>
remote from the mouthpiece 4. The trigger mechanism 7<br>
comprises a canister seat 50, leaf spring 60, lock out motor<br>
70, vane 74, shoot bolt 80 and shoot bolt slide 89.<br>
The canister seat 50 comprises a transverse platform 52<br>
of generally circular shape and an elongate beam 51 which<br>
extends upwardly from the transverse platform 52. The<br>
transverse platform 52 is provided with an upstanding hook<br>
53 and a dished portion forming a spring seat 54. The<br>
canister seat 50 further comprises two flanges forming side<br>
guide walls 56. The canister seat 50 is assembled as a<br>
sliding fit in the front case 2 of the actuator with the<br>
elongate beam 51 forming a sliding fit with the canister<br>
seat guide rail 11. The side guide walls 55 and the guide<br>
rail 11 of the canister seat 50 ensure that the canister<br>
seat 50 is only able to move axially within the front case<br>
2. The leaf spring 60 is held in position between the<br>
spring seat 54 of the canister seat 50 and two abutment<br>
surfaces 56 provided on the chassis 16 of the front case 2.<br>
The leaf spring 60 acts to bias the canister seat 50 towards<br>
the end of the front case 2 nearest the mouthpiece 4.<br>
The slip hook 63 comprises an elongate arm 65 which<br>
extends from a pivot point 64. The elongate arm 65 includes<br>
an arcuate portion 66 near the pivot 64. The slip hook 63<br>
also comprises a detent in the form of a catch surface 67<br>
formed on an opposite side of the pivot point 64 from the<br>
elongate arm 65 as most clearly shown in Figure 3. The<br>
distance from a distal end 69 of the elongate arm 65 t,o the<br>
pivot point 64 measured along the perpendicular to the line<br>
of action of the distal end 69 of the elongate arm 65 about<br>
the pivot point 64 is many multiples of the distance from<br>
the catch surface 67 to the pivot point 64 measured along<br>
the perpendicular to the line of action of the catch surface<br>
67 about the pivot point 64.<br>
The slip hook 63 is freely rotatable in the clockwise<br>
and anti-clockwise directions as viewed in Figure 3.<br>
The lock-out motor 70 comprises a rotatable lead screw<br>
21 of conventional design.<br>
The vane 74 comprises a body portion 75 of solid<br>
construction which pivots about a pivot point 77 connected<br>
to the front case chassis 16. An undersurface of the vane<br>
74 is provided with a flexible plastic spring 76, the use of<br>
which will be described below.<br>
The shoot bolt 80 comprises a stem 81 having an<br>
internally threaded bore (not shown) and an elongate member<br>
82 extending from the stem 81 and comprising at its distal<br>
end a plurality of switch cams 84. The transverse arm 83<br>
also extends laterally from the stem 81 towards vane 74.<br>
The shoot bolt slide 89 is fixedly retained to the<br>
chassis 16 of the front case 2 and receives during assembly<br>
the shoot bolt stem 81 as a sliding fit.<br>
A trigger cap 61 is provided attached to the front case<br>
2. The trigger cap 61 comprises a plurality of air inlets<br>
62. The trigger cap 61 covers the trigger mechanism 7 even<br>
when the front and rear cases 2, 3 are separated. It will be<br>
also noted, and as shown in Figure 3, that the air inlets 62<br>
of the trigger cap 61 are displaced relative to the air<br>
inlets 26 of the rear case 3 so as to prevent a foreign body<br>
being poked into the interior of the actuator 1 through the<br>
air inlets in order to tamper with the trigger mechanism 7.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the trigger mechanism 7 and an<br>
upper end of the actuator 1 in the assembled condition with<br>
the trigger mechanism 7 ready for a dose to be dispensed<br>
from a pressurised dispenser container 100 received within<br>
the interior of the actuator 1. The pressurised dispensing<br>
container 100 is typically of the type having a metering<br>
valve with an internal spring bias. In the position shown<br>
in Figure 3 the leaf spring 60 is compressed between the<br>
spring seat 54 and the abutment surfaces 56 and therefore<br>
acts to bias the canister seat 50 downwards towards the<br>
mouthpiece 4. Movement of the canister seat 50 is prevented<br>
by engagement of the hook 53 with the catch surface 67 of<br>
the slip hook 63. The body 75 of the vane 74 lies in close<br>
proximity to the air inlets 62 of the trigger cap 61. The<br>
flexible plastic spring 76 of the vane 74 is engaged against<br>
the chassis 16 of the front case 2 and biases the vane 74<br>
with a light force upwardly into proximity with the air<br>
inlets 62.<br>
In order to dispense a dose, a user first opens the<br>
dust cap 5 by rotating it into a raised position and places<br>
the mouthpiece outlet 31 in their mouth and inhales.<br>
Inhalation causes a flow of air to be established which<br>
passes through the interior of the actuator 1 from the air<br>
inlet holes 26 to the mouthpiece outlet 31. As viewed in<br>
Figure 4, this air flow will pivot the vane 74 in a<br>
clockwise direction against the bias of the flexible plastic<br>
spring 76, Rotation of the vane 74 disengages a distal end<br>
69 of the elongate arm 65 of the slip hook 63 from the end<br>
of the vane 74 nearest the pivot point 77 leading to the<br>
slip hook 63 rotating in a clockwise direction as shown in<br>
Figure 5 under the pull of the hook 53 on the catch surface<br>
67. Contemporaneously the rotation of the slip hook 63<br>
results in the disengagement of the hook 53 of the canister<br>
seat 50 from the catch surface 67 of the slip hook 63. As a<br>
result the canister seat 50 is free to move downwardly<br>
towards the mouthpiece 4 under action of the leaf spring 60.<br>
The canister seat 50 bears against the pressurised<br>
dispensing container 100 and movement of the canister seat<br>
downwardly thus displaces the pressurised dispensing<br>
container 100 towards the mouthpiece 4 resulting in<br>
actuation of the internal metering valve of the pressurised<br>
dispensing container 100 and dispensation of a dose of<br>
medicament out of the pressurised dispensing container<br>
through the valve stem block and out of the mouthpiece<br>
outlet 31. In this actuated position the ends of the side<br>
guide walls 55 come into engagement and rest against the cam<br>
surface of the bosses 42 of the dust cap 5.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the actuator 1 is reset after<br>
each dispensation by rotating the dust cap 5 into the closed<br>
position wherein the mouthpiece cover 40 covers the<br>
mouthpiece 4-. Rotation of the dust cap 5 causes the bosses<br>
42 to rotate within the apertures 10. The bosses 42 are<br>
engaged with the ends of the side guide walls 55 such that<br>
the rotation of the bosses 42 acts to raise the canister<br>
seat 50 within the interior of the actuator 1 back into its<br>
initial position as shown in Figure 3. The cam surface of<br>
the bosses 42 provides for a degree of over-travel of the<br>
canister seat 50 in the upwards direction such that as the<br>
canister seat 50 is displaced upwardly the end of the hook<br>
53 contacts the arcuate portion 66 of the slip hook 63 and<br>
rotates the slip hook 63 counter-clockwise and then descends<br>
slightly to effect re-engagement of the hook 53 with the<br>
catch surface 67. The arcuate portion 66 is shaped such<br>
that vertical upward movement of the hook 53 smoothly<br>
rotates the slip hook 63 counter-clockwise. The upward<br>
movement of the canister seat 50 also compresses the leaf<br>
spring 60 ready for dispensing of the next dose. As the<br>
canister seat 50 moves upwardly within the interior of the<br>
actuator 1 the pressurised dispensing container 100 also<br>
moves upwardly under the internal spring bias of the<br>
metering valve of the container into the ready to dispense<br>
position shown in Figure 3.<br>
Figures 7 to 10 illustrate a means for locking and<br>
unlocking the actuator I in order to lock-out operation of<br>
the actuator 1 and a means for inserting and removing a<br>
pressurised dispensing container 100 from the housing. As<br>
shown in Figure 7, in a locked state, an upper end 85 of the<br>
shoot bolt: stem 81 is engaged in the locking aperture 23 on<br>
the inside, face of the top portion 20 of the rear case 3<br>
preventing separation of the front and rear cases 2, 3. In<br>
addition, a distal end of the transverse arm 83 is engaged<br>
with an under surface of the vane 74 preventing clockwise<br>
rotation thereof and thus preventing operation of the<br>
actuator 1. The shoot bolt 80 is displaced upwardly into<br>
this position by means of the lock out motor 70 which on<br>
operation rotates the lead screw 71 which is engaged with<br>
the threaded bore of the shoot bolt stem 81 causing the<br>
shoot bolt 80 as a whole to move upwardly within the shoot<br>
bolt guide 89 into the locked position of Figure 7...<br>
An armed state of the actuator 1 is shown in Figure 8<br>
in which dispensation of a dose of product as described<br>
above may take place but in which the separation of the<br>
front and rear cases 2, 3 is still not possible. In this<br>
position, the upper end 85 of the shoot bolt stem 81 is<br>
still in engagement with the locking recess 23 of the rear<br>
case 3 but the shoot bolt 81 has been moved downwardly to a<br>
sufficient degree to disengage the distal end of the<br>
transverse arm 83 from the vane 74 such that sufficient<br>
clockwise rotation of the vane 74 is possible to disengage<br>
the hook 53 from the slip hook 63.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates an unlocked state of the actuator<br>
I in which the rear case 3 may be separated from the front<br>
case 2. In this state che shoot bolt 80 has been moved<br>
further downwards by operation of the lock-out motor 70 to a<br>
point where the upper end 85 has been moved out of<br>
engagement with the locking recess 23. In this state as<br>
shown in Figure 10, the rear case 3 may be opened by<br>
pivoting the rear case 3 relative to the front case 2 about<br>
the hinge formed by the hinge portions 13, 22. Movement of<br>
the shoot bolt 80 into the armed, and unlocked positions<br>
described above causes the switch cams 84 on the shoot bolt<br>
80 to operate one or more of the switches 93 on the PCS 6.<br>
In this way, the control processor 95 can determine the<br>
position of the shoot bolt 80. Advantageously, and as shown<br>
in Figure 15, in the open position, the trigger cap 61 still<br>
covers the moving parts of the trigger mechanism 7<br>
preventing damage or tampering therewith. Advantageously,<br>
the ability to lock the actuator 1 provides a secure and<br>
robust device in which removal of the pressurised dispensing<br>
container 100 from the housing is prevented other than by<br>
means of excessive force, such as the use of tools.<br>
Preferably, the shoot bolt 80 is only moved from the<br>
locked position of Figure 7 to the armed position of Figure<br>
8 immediately before a dose is required. Consequently, the<br>
device is otherwise in the locked state. As will be<br>
described below, the device preferably comprises a security<br>
pass code system and it is preferred that the shoot bolt 80<br>
only moves into the armed position after entry of the<br>
security pass code.<br>
The lock-out motor 70 advantageously allows for precise<br>
movement of the shoot bolt 80. In particular, intermediate<br>
positions between the extremes of the shoot bolt's travel<br>
arc possible, unlike with a solenoid where only xopen' and<br>
'closed' positions are possible. Thus, the shoot bolt 80 and<br>
lock-out motor 70 can be used to perform both the functions<br>
of locking the housing and locking-out operation of the<br>
trigger mechanism 7. In addition, the lock-out motor 70 is a<br>
robust mechanism for controlling the shoot bolt 80 which is<br>
highly resistant to impact loads, accelerations, and<br>
magnetic interference, all of which are known to reduce the<br>
effectiveness of solenoids in locking applications. Further,<br>
the lock-out motor 70 requires significantly less power to<br>
operate than an electro-magnetic device such as a solenoid.<br>
Figures 11 to 15 illustrate how the pressurised<br>
dispensing container 100 is replaced in practice. From an<br>
initial position shown in Figure 11 the dust cap 5 is first<br>
rotated upwardly into the open position as shown in Figure<br>
12 and the mouthpiece 4 removed by disengaging the socket 34<br>
from the stem portion 24. An interface lead 110 such as a<br>
USB cable or an RS232 connector is connected to the data<br>
port 14 on the front case 2. An operative connection is<br>
established between the control processor 95 of the actuator<br>
PCB 92 and an external programming device such as a handheld<br>
computer or personal computer (PC). A software program is<br>
then run on the external programming device to send and<br>
receive instructions and information via the interface lead<br>
110 to/from the control processor 95. In order to remove or<br>
insert a pressurised dispensing container 100 the software<br>
instructs the control processor 95 to move the shoot bolt 80<br>
downwardly into the unlocked state shown in Figure 9 wherein<br>
the upper end 85 of the stem 81 is disengaged from the<br>
locking recess 23. The rear case 3 can then be separated<br>
from the front case 2 as shown in Figure 14 and the<br>
pressurised container 100 inserted/removed. The actuator 1<br>
is then closed. The software then instructs the shoot bolt<br>
80 to return to the locked position. The interface lead 110<br>
is then removed. During this insertion/removal procedure,<br>
which is preferably carried out by an authorised medical<br>
practitioner, arid whilst the interface lead 110 is engaged<br>
with the data port 14, the control processor 95 may receive<br>
instructions fiom the external programming device to alter<br>
the manner of operation of the actuator 1 for subsequent<br>
17<br>
dispense cycles. This can be useful where the product is to<br>
be dispensed in a different manner ..subsequently or where the<br>
actuator 1 is to be used by a different user with different<br>
prescription requirements. Further, information stored<br>
within a memory of the control processor 95 may be<br>
downloaded to the external programming device for analysis.<br>
This information may relate to matters such as the number<br>
and time of doses dispensed by the actuator, the user's<br>
compliance with a prescribed dosage pattern, information on<br>
errors in operation of the actuator 1, etc. The software run<br>
on the external programming device preferably includes<br>
instructions for carrying out the above procedures to guide<br>
the authorised medical practitioner or other operative.<br>
Figures 16 and 17 illustrate an alternative mechanism<br>
for locking the opening of the front and rear cases 2,3.<br>
Instead of the shoot bolt 80 being used to interface with<br>
the rear case 3 and the vane 74, a rotary wiper 115 is<br>
provided as shown in Figure 16. The rotary wiper 115<br>
comprises a vane arm 116 and a lock-out arm 117 each of<br>
which depend from a common pivot shaft 118 which is driven<br>
to rotate by means of the lock-out motor 70. Preferably,<br>
the pivot shaft 118 is itself a rotatable member of the<br>
lock-out motor 70. As shown in Figure 16, the vane arm 116<br>
is rotatable such that a distal end engages an undersurface<br>
of the vane 74 to prevent rotation of the vane 74 and thus<br>
lock-out operation of the actuator 1. The vane arm 116 may<br>
be rotated as shown in Figure 17, under control of the<br>
control processor 95 into a position in which it is<br>
disengaged from the vare 74 allowing the vane 74 to rotate<br>
on inhalation by a user to cause the vane 74 to disengage<br>
from the slip hock 63 allowing dispensation as described<br>
above.<br>
The lock-out arm 117 as shown in Figure 16 is movable<br>
into and out of engagement with a locking recess 119. As<br>
with the previous embodiment described, engagement of the<br>
lock-out arm 117 in the locking recess 119 prevents<br>
separation of the front and rear cases 2, 3.<br>
A second embodiment of dispensing according to the<br>
present invention is shown in Figures 18 to 20... This<br>
embodiment is particularly suitable for a disposable device<br>
where it is not intended to replace the pressurized<br>
dispensing container 100 after it has been emptied. Many of<br>
the components of the second embodiment are the same or<br>
similar to those described above with reference to the first<br>
embodiment. Like reference numerals have been used for like<br>
components and common features will not be discussed in<br>
further detail.<br>
As shown in Figure 18, the actuator 1 again comprises a<br>
front case 2, rear case 3, mouthpiece 4 and dust cap 5. In<br>
the second embodiment the mouthpiece 4 is not shown as a<br>
separate removable component but integrally with the rear<br>
case 3, However, in accordance with the present invention,<br>
the mouthpiece can be formed in a detachable manner as<br>
described above. The dust cap 5 is also simplified compared<br>
to the first embodiment and comprises a mouthpiece cover<br>
portion 40 which is pivoted to the rear case 3 by means of<br>
engagement of bosses 125 in apertures 126 formed at the<br>
mouthpiece end of the rear case 3 as shown in Figures 19 and<br>
20. Each boss 125 is provided with an eccentrically<br>
positioned peg 127, although a cam surface may alternatively<br>
be used as described above with reference to the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
As shown in Figure 20, the actuator 1 comprises a<br>
canister seat 50, leaf spring 60, PCB 92, shoot bolt 80,<br>
slip hook 63 and lock-out motor 70. In addition, the<br>
actuator comprises a canister reset seat 130 which is<br>
engaged against the valve stem end of the pressurized<br>
dispensing container 100 in use. The'canister reset seat<br>
130 comprises an annular member 131 which engages a ferrule<br>
132 of the pressurized dispensing container 100 and two<br>
elongate arms 133 which extend from the annular member 131<br>
towards the mouthpiece 4.<br>
Operation of the second embodiment of actuator 1 to<br>
dispense a dose of medicament is similar to that described<br>
above with reference to the first embodiment. On actuation,<br>
the distal ends of the elongate arm 133 move downwardly<br>
within the interior of the actuator 1 to come to rest<br>
against the pegs 127 of the bosses 125 of the dust cap 5. In<br>
addition, means for locking operation of the actuator 1 and<br>
separation of the front case 2 and rear case 3 may be<br>
provided as described above with reference to the first<br>
embodiment. However, the means for resetting the actuator 1<br>
after each dispensation is different from that described<br>
above. In the second embodiment, resetting of the device is<br>
again achieved by rotation of the dust cap 5. Rotation of<br>
the dust cap 5 from the open position into the closed<br>
position in which it covers the mouthpiece 4 causes the<br>
bosses 125 to rotate within the apertures 126 of the rear<br>
case 3. Consequently, the pegs 127 on the bosses 125 are<br>
moved from a lower position within the rear case 3 to an<br>
upper position. As the pegs 127 are engaged against the<br>
distal ends of the elongate arms 133 of the canister reset<br>
seat 130, rotation of the dust cap 5 causes the canister<br>
reset seat 130 and consequently the pressurized dispensing<br>
container 100 to be moved upwardly within the interior of<br>
the actuator 1 against the bias of the leaf spring 12 to reengage<br>
the hook 53 of the canister seat 50 with the catch<br>
surface 67 of the slip hook 63.<br>
In other respects the second embodiment of actuator 1<br>
operates in the same manner as described above with<br>
reference to the first embodiment.<br>
Figure 21 illustrates schematically a user interface<br>
displayed on the LCD screen 15 of the actuator 1 and<br>
accessed and navigated through by the operating button 17.<br>
Advantageously, the user interface is operated and navigated<br>
by using only one operating button 17. The LCD screen 15<br>
comprises a plurality of icons 135 and alphanumeric<br>
character blocks 136 as shown in Box A which may be<br>
illuminated in varying combinations to display topical<br>
information to the user of the actuator 1. The LCD screen<br>
15 appears blank as shown in Box 1 in a standby mode where,<br>
for example, the actuator 1 has not been used for some time.<br>
If .the operating button 17 Js depressed with the dust cap 5<br>
in the closed DOSition the LCD screen 15 illuminates to<br>
display the number- of doses immediately available for<br>
dispensing shown in Box 2. The LCD screen 15 preferably<br>
then proceeds either at fixed time intervals or on further<br>
depressions of the operating button 17 to display the time<br>
elapsed since the last dose, as shown in Box 3, and then the<br>
total number of doses remaining in the pressurized<br>
dispensing container 100, as shown in Box 4. The LCD screen<br>
15 then returns to the standby display of Box 1.<br>
From the standby mode, if the dust cap 5 is opened the<br>
LCD screen 15 displays one of two screens dependent on the<br>
state of the actuator 1. If no dose is currently available<br>
because, for example, the user has recently taken a previous<br>
dose and is not yet permitted to take a further dose, Box 6<br>
is displayed indicating a warning to the user followed by<br>
the display of Box 7 indicating the time remaining until the<br>
next dose can be dispensed. The display may then return the<br>
st-andby mode of Box 1 or proceed to the displays of Boxes 3<br>
and 4 to indicate the time elapsed since the last dose and<br>
total number of doses left in the pressurized dispensing<br>
container 100. Alternatively, if on opening of the dust cap<br>
5, a dose is available for immediate dispensation Box 8 is<br>
displayed indicating that a pass code is required to be<br>
entered by the user before dispensation can take place. If<br>
the correct pass code is entered by the user the display<br>
moves to Box 10 indicating that the actuator I is unlocked<br>
and it then proceeds to display Box 11 indicating the number<br>
of doses that can be dispensed immediately, in this example<br>
'2' . Once a dose has been taken by a user in Lhe manner<br>
described above, the display decrements the number of doses<br>
immediately available to '!' as shown in Box 12. The user<br>
at this point must close the dust cap 5 in order to reset<br>
the device as described above. At this point the LCD screen<br>
15 returns to the standby display of Box 1. Alternatively,<br>
if on taking a dose the actuator 1 determines that the<br>
pressurized dispensing container 100 is empty this<br>
information is displayed to the user and the actuator 1 must<br>
be returned to an authorised medical practitioner for<br>
refilling.<br>
One method of inputting the pass code is illustrated in<br>
Boxes 8A to 8C. A three or four digit alphanumeric code is<br>
entered one digit at a time. To allow operation by a single<br>
operating button 17 the display as shown in Box 8A<br>
automatically cycles through the potential alphanumeric<br>
characters for the first digit. The user then presses the<br>
operating button 17 when the correct alphanumeric character<br>
for the first digit is displayed as shown in Box 8B. The<br>
display then cycles through the available alphanumeric<br>
characters for the second digit and so on until the complete<br>
code has been entered as shown in Box 8C.<br>
An alternative method for inputting the pass code<br>
involves the user themselves cycling through the potential<br>
alphanumeric characters. In this method each press of the<br>
operating button 17 changes the character displayed,<br>
initially for the first digit. Once the correct character is<br>
displayed the user presses and holds for a fixed period,<br>
such as a second, the operating button 17 to confirm the<br>
selection and to move onto the second digit, and so on until<br>
the entire code has been entered.<br>
If at any point an incorrect code is entered, the<br>
display illuminates as shown in Box 9 to indicate that an<br>
error has occurred. Preferably two or three attempts are<br>
allowed for the user to input the correct pass-code. If<br>
after a predetermined number of attempts the correct pass<br>
code has still not been entered then the actuator 1 remains<br>
locked and the display moves to the standby state of Box 1.<br>
The LCD display 15 is also able to display other<br>
information in connection with operation of the actuator 1.<br>
In particular, as shown in Box 13 the display can illuminate<br>
to indicate if operation of the pressurized dispensing<br>
container 100 during a dose dispensation was ineffective due<br>
to, for example, incomplete valve travel. The display may<br>
also be capable of showing a general failure display as<br>
shown in Box 14 where the internal components of the<br>
actuator 1 have suffered an electro-mechanical failure such<br>
as, for example, failure of the lock-out motor 70.<br>
As shown in Box B, the display 15 may indicate if the<br>
internal battery of the PCB 92 is close to exhaustion,<br>
although this information preferably is only displayed to an<br>
authorised medical practitioner on inserting a pressurized<br>
dispensing container 100. Preferably, the software in the<br>
actuator 1 and the external programming device is able to<br>
determine whether the battery 94 has sufficient power to<br>
dispense all doses contained in the pressurized dispensing<br>
container 100. The determination may be made by<br>
interrogating the battery 94 to ascertain its remaining<br>
power or by logging and analysing the accumulated usage of<br>
the battery 94, or by a combination of these methods. Where<br>
logging of accumulated usage is chosen the memory of the<br>
control processor 95 can be used to store information on the<br>
number of actuations of the lock-out motor 70 and/or the<br>
total time the LCD display 15 has been powered on. This<br>
information can then be used to work out the remaining power<br>
in the battery 94 since the initial power capacity or rating<br>
of the battery 94 is known.<br>
As shown in Box C, the display 15 may display an icon,<br>
preferably in a flashing mode, to indicate if the<br>
pressurized dispensing container 100 is low on remaining<br>
doses.<br>
The visual displays of the LCD screen 15 may also be<br>
accompanied or replaced by audio signals such as buzzes,<br>
beeps or combinations thereof, or tactile signals such as<br>
vibrations to alert a user to the status of the device.<br>
The control processor 95 and LCD display 15 may<br>
together be used to control operation of the actuator by<br>
regulating the number of actuations in a particular time<br>
period and/or the time interval between individual<br>
actuations. In one version the control processor 95 may be<br>
programmed to allow a predetermined number of actuations to<br>
be taken during a 'rolling' time interval. For example,<br>
three actuations may be allowed during any 24 hour period.<br>
Thus the "rolling' window of 24 hours starts when the first<br>
actuation takes place. Thereafter two further actuations are<br>
possible within 24 hours. In other words, a fourth actuation<br>
is not possible until 24 hours after the first actuation.<br>
The window is a "rolling' window in that a fifth actuation<br>
is not possible until 24 hours after the second actuation, a<br>
sixth actuation is not possible until 24 hours after the<br>
third actuation, and so on. By using a rolling time frame<br>
the device prevents a user taking too many doses at a<br>
transition point between fixed time frames. For example, the<br>
user is prevented from taking three doses near the end of a<br>
first 24 hour period and three further doses near the start<br>
of a second, successive 2 I hour time period which would lead<br>
to six. doBes being administered in under 24 hours. An<br>
advantage of the described operating system is that the<br>
exact timing of each actuation within the 24 hour period can<br>
be decided by the user. This is an advantage for medicaments<br>
that have an accumulative effect on a user whereby the exact<br>
timing of each dose is less critical than the total quantity<br>
of medicament dispensed over a particular time period. By<br>
allowing a user to determine themselves when they take the<br>
doses in that period the actuator 1 allows for a flexible<br>
dispensation pattern which ,is more suited to a user's needs.<br>
The number of possible doses in each time period and the<br>
length of the time period can be varied as required by the<br>
prescription requirements of each individual user and the<br>
figures given above are merely exemplary.<br>
In another version, the control processor 95 may be<br>
programmed to allow actuations to take place only after a<br>
minimum time interval of, for example, 4 hours. This mode of<br>
operation may be used separately from the 'rolling' window<br>
described above or in combination. Thus in combination, the<br>
control processor 95 may flexibly allow a user to take, say,<br>
3 actuations within any 24 hours and at the same time ensure<br>
that no two doses are taken within, say, 1 hour of each<br>
other. This advantageously provides a great deal of<br>
flexibility and control of the prescription regime.<br>
In another version, the control processor 95 is<br>
provided with clock running on either an internal time or a<br>
real time basis. The control processor 95 is programmed to<br>
allow a yet number of doses to be administered each 'day' or<br>
other fixed time interval determined by the clock. Thus the<br>
tiding of the doses is determined by an absolute time<br>
measure rathei' than a relative time measure dependant on the<br>
timing of previous doses. This mode of operation is<br>
advantageous for medicaments which are prescribed at fixed<br>
intervals which may be one or more days apart. A real time<br>
clock may also be used to ensure that a medicament is not<br>
used after the expiry date has passed. The expiry date<br>
information may be input to the control processor by the<br>
external programming device on insertion of the pressurised<br>
dispensing container.<br>
The control processor 95 may also be used to prompt a<br>
user to take a dose at a particular time. The prompt may<br>
take the form of a visible signal on the LCD 15, an audible<br>
alert, a tactile alert such as a vibration, or a combination<br>
of the above. The prompt can be used to assist a user's<br>
prescription regime by reminding the user to take a dose at<br>
the 'best' time. However, this prompting system may be<br>
combined with the operating modes described above. Thus the<br>
device may use a 'rolling' window mode to allow flexibility<br>
in the timing of doses within a time period but still<br>
recommend to a user that the doses are taken at specific<br>
times.<br>
Figures 22 to 31 illustrate a mechanism which may be<br>
incorporated into either of the embodiments of actuator 1<br>
described above for automatically removing the actuating<br>
force from the pressurized dispensing container 100 after<br>
dispensation of a dose of medicament. This is useful in<br>
overcoming a potential problem with the unmodified<br>
embodiments described above which may occur if the dust cap<br>
5 is left in the open position after dispensation of a dose.<br>
In the unmodified embodiments described above, the biasing<br>
force of the leaf spring 60 continues to act via the<br>
canister seat FO on the pressurized dispensing container 100<br>
and maintains the pressurized dispensing container 100 in<br>
the depressed state with the internal metering valve of the<br>
pressurized dispensing container 100 in an actuated<br>
position. Whilst the internal metering valve contains seals<br>
to isolate the bulk product from the exterior of the<br>
pressurized dispensing container 100 in the actuated<br>
position, it is known that over time these seals may be<br>
subject to leakage of medicament and/or pressurized gas. As<br>
a result, it is advantageous that the mechanism of the<br>
present invention described below enables the biasing force<br>
to be automatically removed from the pressurized dispensing<br>
container 100 even where the dust cap 5 is left in the open<br>
position.<br>
As shown in Figures 22 to 36, the mechanism for<br>
removing the biasing force from the pressurized dispensing<br>
container 100 comprises a modified canister seat 50, two<br>
helical springs 140 instead of the leaf spring 60 and<br>
additional components in the form of a retainer member 141<br>
and a pair of toggles 150. As shown in Figures 22 and 36,<br>
the modified canister seat 50 comprises two upstanding guide<br>
arms 145 which are diametrically opposed to one another.<br>
The retainer member 141 is received in the interior of the<br>
actuator 1 and is slidable relative to the modified canister<br>
seat 50. The pair of helical springs 140 span between the<br>
modified canister seat 50 and two springs seats 142 provided<br>
on an undersurface of a transverse platform 144 of the<br>
retainer member 141. An upper surface of the transverse<br>
platform 144 forms two toggle catch surfaces 143, the use of<br>
which will be described below.<br>
The pair of toggles 150 are pivotally mounted to the<br>
chassis 16 of the actuator 1. Initially, with the mechanism<br>
in a position ready for dispensation of a dose of medicament<br>
as shown in Figure 22 rotation of the toggles 150 due to the<br>
bias of the helical springs 140 is prevented by contact with<br>
the guide arms 145 of the modified canister seat 50.<br>
In the position of Figure 22 the helical springs 140<br>
are compressed between the retainer member 141 and the<br>
modified canister seat 50. The toggles 150 are engaged with<br>
the toggle catch surfaces 143 of the retainer member 141<br>
preventing upward movement of the retainer member 141 away<br>
from the modified canister seat 50. Downward movement of<br>
the canister seat 50 and pressurized dispensing container<br>
100 is prevented as described above by engagement of the<br>
hook 53 with the slip hook 63. In addition, as shown in<br>
Figure 22 the shoot bolt 80 is in the locked position with<br>
the transverse arm 83 contacting the vane 74 preventing<br>
actuation of the actuator 1.<br>
Figure 23 shows the trigger mechanism in the. unlocked<br>
state with the transverse arm 83 out of engagement with the<br>
vane 74. At this point the positions of the retainer member<br>
141, toggles 150 and modified canister seat 50 are<br>
unchanged.<br>
Figure 24 shows the point when inhalation by a user has<br>
commenced causing the vane 74 to rotate in a clockwise<br>
direction leading to disengagement of the vane 74 from the<br>
distal end 69 of the elongate arm 65 of the slip hook 63.<br>
Consequently, as shown in Figure 25, the hook 53 disengages<br>
from the catch surface 67 of the slip hook 63 and the<br>
modified canister seat 50 and the pressurised dispensing<br>
container 100 are displaced downwardly towards the<br>
mouthpiece 4 in order to dispense a dose of medicament as<br>
described previously. Contemporaneously the downward<br>
movement, of the modified canister seat 50 moves the guide<br>
arms 155 of the modified canister seat 50 out of engagement<br>
with the outer faces of the toggles 150 as shown in Figure<br>
25. Consequently, the toggles 150 are free to rotate under<br>
the bias of the helical springs 140 acting through the<br>
modified canister seat 50 into the position shown in Figure<br>
25 wherein the toggles 150 have moved out of engagement with<br>
the toggle catch surfaces 143 of the retainer member 141.<br>
As a result, the retainer member 141 is free to move<br>
upwardly within the actuator 1 towards the top portion 20 of<br>
the rear case 3 under action of the helical springs 140 with<br>
the transverse platform 144 passing in between the two<br>
toggles 150 as shown in Figure 26. As the retainer member<br>
141 moves upwardly, the transverse platform 144 clears the<br>
toggles as shown in Figure 27. At the same time, movement<br>
of the retainer member 141 upwardly is sufficient to remove<br>
the biasing force of the helical springs 140 from the<br>
modified canister seat 50 allowing the modified canister<br>
seat 50 and the pressurized dispensing container 100 to move<br>
back upwardly within the actuator 1 under the internal<br>
spring bias of the pressurized dispensing container 100.<br>
Upward movement of the modified canister seat 50 brings the<br>
guide arms 155 into contact with the toggles 150 as shown in<br>
Figure 27 which act to rotate the toggles into their<br>
original position as shown in Figure 28. The upward movement<br>
of the modified canister seat 150 also re-engages the hook<br>
53 with the slip hook 63 in the manner described above.<br>
Hence, at this point the dust cap 5 of the actuator 1 is<br>
still in the open position but the pressurized dispensing<br>
container 100 has been able to move back into it,-j unloaded,<br>
non-actuated state as shown in Figure 28. Thus, leakage of<br>
medicament and/or propellant from the container 100 via the<br>
outlet seals of the internal metering valve is prevented.<br>
The mechanism is reset by closing the dust cap 5. As<br>
will be described below, rotation of the dust cap 5 moves<br>
the retainer member 141 downwardly within the actuator I<br>
towards the mouthpiece 4 resulting in the transverse<br>
platfoxin 144 bed rig pulled down between the toggles 150 as<br>
shown in Figure 29. The toggles 150 are thus rotated into<br>
contact with and deflect small leaf springs 148 located<br>
immediately beneath each toggle 150. Once the transverse<br>
platform 144 of the retainer member 141 clears the toggles<br>
150 the toggles are moved back into their original<br>
orientation by means of the leaf springs 148 as shown in<br>
Figure 30. The final portion of the rotation of the dust<br>
cap 5 allows the retainer member 141 to move upwardly under<br>
the bias of the springs 140 to a small degree so that the<br>
toggles 150 re-engage the toggle catch surfaces 143 of the<br>
transverse platform 144, In this position, as shown in<br>
Figure 31 the actuator 1 is ready for a further dispensation<br>
cycle.<br>
The mechanism for moving the retainer member 141<br>
downwardly from the position of Figure 28 into the position<br>
of Figure 31 will now be explained. Figures 32 to 35 more<br>
clearly illustrate how closure of the dust cap 5 re-sets the<br>
retainer member 141 and the toggles 150 (the pressurised<br>
dispensing container has been omitted for clarity). As<br>
shown in Figure 32, the retainer member 141 further<br>
comprises a lower arm 147 which extends downwardly within<br>
the interior of the actuator 1. Each arm 147 comprises an<br>
aperture 149 which engages a cam 152 provided on the bosses<br>
42 of the lust cap 5 and which protrude into the interior of<br>
the actuator 1 through the apertures 10 formed in the front<br>
case 2.<br>
The aperture 149 of each lower arm 147 is generally<br>
rectangular but is provided with a recess 153 in which the<br>
cam 152 can nestle when the dust cap is in a closed position<br>
as shown in Figure 32. Figure 33 shows the dust cap 5<br>
rotated into the open position and shows that the cam 152<br>
has been moved upwardly relative to the lower arm 147 so<br>
that it is disengaged from the recess 153 and is located<br>
part way along the aperture 149. Jn this position as<br>
described above the retainer member 141 is held in position<br>
solely by the action of the toggles 150. Figure 34 shows<br>
the actuator 1 immediately after dispensation of a dose but<br>
with the dust cap 5 still in the open position and equates<br>
to the position of Figure 28. At this point the cam 152 is<br>
still out of engagement with the lower arm 147. However,<br>
as shown in Figure 35, on rotation of the dust cap 5 into<br>
the closed position the cam 152 is brought into engagement<br>
with the lower arm 147 and moves the lower arm 147 and hence<br>
the remainder of the retainer member 141 downwardly. The<br>
presence of the recess 153 in the lower arm 147 allows the<br>
retainer member 141 to move back upwardly within the<br>
actuator 1 to a small degree just as the dust cap 5 is<br>
brought into the closed position discussed above in order to<br>
enable the toggles 150 to re-engage the toggle catch<br>
surfaces 143 of the transverse platform. In addition, the<br>
recess 153 provides a positive closure to the dust cap 5<br>
that provides a small resistance to opening of the dust cap<br>
5. This is useful in keeping the duct cap 5 securely in<br>
place.<br>
It should be noted that the mechanism described herein<br>
for removing the valve load from the pressurised dispensing<br>
container 100 when the dust cap 5 is in the open position<br>
may be applied to either the first or second embodiments of<br>
actuator 1 described above and also to other actuators which<br>
may or may not incorporate a trigger mechanism 7 operated by<br>
the inhalation of a user.<br>
Figures 37 to 41 illustrate schematically an<br>
alternative mechanism for removing the load from the valve<br>
of the pressurised dispensing container 100. The mechanism<br>
comprises a canister seat formed from a first part 50 which<br>
is retained by and released from the slip hook 63 in the way<br>
described above and a second part 510 fixed to the<br>
pressurised dispensing container 100. The first and second<br>
parts 50, 510 of the canister seat are slidable relative to<br>
one another and together define a pressurisable chamber 511.<br>
A vent 512 is provided from the chamber 511 which is<br>
closable by a flap valve 513. Figure 37 shows the at rest<br>
position prior to inhalation. On inhalation the vane is<br>
rotated and the first part 50 of the canister seat is<br>
released and is moved downwards by action of the leaf spring<br>
60. Air is unable to escape rapidly from the vent 512 due to<br>
the flap valve 513. Consequently the force is transferred to<br>
the second part 510 of the canister seat and the pressurised<br>
dispensing container 100 is moved downwards to cause it to<br>
operate. At the end of the downward stroke of the first part<br>
50 the flap valve 513 contacts, and is lifted by, a reset<br>
sleeve 500 as shown in Figure 39. At this point the<br>
pressurised air within the chamber 511 rapidly escapes via<br>
the vent 512 allowing the fixed part 510 and pressurised<br>
dispensing container 100 to move upwards under the bias of<br>
the container's internal metering valve. At this point the<br>
load is removed from the container 100. The mechanism is<br>
reset by rotating to close the dust cap which acts on the<br>
reset sleeve; 500 via a cam to lift the reset sleeve 500 and<br>
first part 50 back into the position shown in Figure 37..<br>
Alternatively, the vent 512 may be-sized to limit the<br>
through flow of air and the flap valve 513 dispensed with.<br>
In operation, on triggering of the trigger mechanism the<br>
force is transferred to the second part 510 since the air<br>
cannot escape rapidly enough from the chamber 511. However<br>
after actuation the air vents through the still open 512<br>
allowing the load to be removed as described above.<br>
Figure 41 schematically illustrates an alternative<br>
trigger mechanism which may be used with the actuator 1 of<br>
the present invention. In this alternative, the vane 74 is<br>
provided as before connected to the chassis 16 at a pivot<br>
point 77. The slip hook 63 is orientated substantially<br>
horizontally and is pivoted to the chassis 16 at a pivot<br>
point 64. As before, the slip hook 63 comprises an elongate<br>
arm 65 and a catch surface 67 for restraining a hook 53 of a<br>
canister seat 50. However, in this version, the elongate<br>
arm 65 of the slip hook 63 extends substantially<br>
horizontally and the distal end 69 is restrained in tension<br>
by a link extending below the vane 74. In operation, on<br>
inhalation by a user, the vane 74 rotates moving the link of<br>
the vane out of engagement with the distal end 69 of the<br>
slip hook 63 at which point the slip hook 63 is free to<br>
rotate in a clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 41<br>
freeing the hook 53 from the catch surface 67.<br>
Figure 42 illustrates a further alternative trigger<br>
mechanism which may be used in the actuator 1 of the present<br>
invention. The configuration as shown in Figure 42 is<br>
mechanically identical to that described above with<br>
reference to the first embodiment, except that the<br>
orientation of the vane 74 is now substantially vertical<br>
rather than substantially horizontal. In addition, the slip<br>
hook 63 is orientated in the armed position substantially<br>
horizontally. In other respects, operation of the trigger<br>
mechanism is the same as that described above in the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
Figure 43 illustrates a further alternative trigger<br>
mechanism. In this mechanism, a vane 174 is provided<br>
pivoted about a pivot point 177 connected to the chassis 16<br>
of the actuator 1. The vane 174 has a dog-legged<br>
configuration and is provided with a rotatable peg 178 at<br>
the angle of the dog-leg. A hook 163 is provided on a<br>
modified canister seat 250 which is engagable with the peg<br>
178. In the position shown, the peg 178 prevents downward<br>
movement of the canister seat 250 and hence actuation of-the<br>
actuator 1. On inhalation by a user, the vane 174 is<br>
rotated in an anti-clockwise direction as viewed in Figure<br>
43 causing the peg 178 to move out of engagement with the<br>
hook 163 allowing the modified canister seat 250 to move<br>
downwardly in the direction of the spring 260.<br>
Figure 44 illustrates a further alternative trigger<br>
mechanism in which the pressurised dispensing container 100<br>
is biased by means of a helical spring 140 acting on a<br>
canister seat 350. The canister seat 350 is pivotably<br>
connected to a link member 351 at a lower pivot point 352. A<br>
pivotable vane 374 is provided and pivots about a pivot<br>
point 353 mounted to the chassis 16 of the actuator 1. The<br>
vane 374 is also pivotably connected to the link member 351<br>
at a top pivot point 354. In the rest position, the top<br>
pivot 354 lies over-centre with respect to the pivot point<br>
353 and lower pivot 352, in other words to the right of a<br>
vertical line passing through the pivot point 353 as viewed<br>
in Figure 44. On inhalation the vane 374 is rotated counterclockwise<br>
moving the top pivot 354 past the vertical at<br>
which point the spring 140 accelerates the rotation of the<br>
vane and the canister seat 350 and pressurised dispensing<br>
container 100 are enabled to move downwards to actuate the<br>
container.<br>
Figure 45 illustrates a further trigger mechanism<br>
comprising a chassis 458 pivotably connected to a vane 474<br>
by means of a spring 440 spanning between a boss 452 on the<br>
chassis 458 and a boss 454 on the vane 474. The vane 474 is<br>
pivotable connected to the chassis about a pivot point 453.<br>
A canister seat 450 is provided comprising a hook 459 which<br>
passes up through an aperture 460 in the chassis 458 into<br>
the region of the vane 474. The chassis 458 houses a<br>
slidable sprung bar 481 which is biased by means of a sprung<br>
portion 483 in the rest position into engagement with a<br>
projection 482 on the canister seat 450 which prevents<br>
downward movement of the seat 450. On inhalation the vane<br>
474 rotates clockwise as viewed in Figure 45 moving the boss<br>
454 over-centre at which point the spring 440 accelerates<br>
the rotation of the vane. A rear portion of the vane 474 is<br>
provided with a cam (not shown) which acts on the slidable<br>
sprung bar 481 to the left as viewed in Figure 44 on<br>
rotation of the vane 474 to move the bar 481 out of<br>
engagement with the projection 482 and so enable downward<br>
movement of the canister seat 450 and operation of the<br>
dispensing container. On resetting the trigger- mechanism the<br>
hook 45lj of the canister seat 450 is moved upwards which<br>
rotates the vane 474 into its initial position. The vane 474<br>
is provided with an aperture 477 which is shaped to ensure<br>
that the hook 459 detaches from the vane 474 as the trigger<br>
mechanism reaches the rest position.<br>
In the above embodiments the resetting of the trigger<br>
mechanism 7 has been described as being achieved by rotation<br>
of the dust cap 5 causing in turn rotation of a cam surface<br>
or off-set peg engaged with a portion of the canister seat<br>
50 or canister reset seat 130. However, resetting of the<br>
trigger mechanism 7 may equally be achieved by other means<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
For example, the canister seat 50 or canister reset seat 130<br>
may be displaced by means of equivalent mechanical<br>
arrangements such as an axial slider, a rotatable lever, a<br>
rack and pinion operated by a key, or similar.<br>
The above invention has been particularly described, by<br>
way of example, applied to a dispensing device actuated by<br>
the inhalation of a user. However, aspects of the invention<br>
such as the means for locking the housing, the user<br>
interface, and the means for locking-out operation of the<br>
trigger mechanism may be utilised with dispensing devices<br>
where triggering is other than by inhalation. In addition,<br>
the invention has been described with reference to a<br>
pressurised dispensing container but can be applied to other<br>
dispensing devices.<br><br><br><br><br>
