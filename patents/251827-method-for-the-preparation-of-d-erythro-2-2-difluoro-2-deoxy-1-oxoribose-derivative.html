				<td>METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF<br>
D-ERYTHRO-2,2-DIFLUORO-2-DEOXY-l-OXORIBOSE DERIVATIVE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing highly pure<br>
D-erythro-2,2-difluoro-2-deoxy-1 -oxoribose derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
D-erythro-2,2-difluoro-2-deoxy-l -oxoribose is an important intermediate used in the<br>
preparation of gemcitabine of formula (A), an agent for treating non-small cell lung cancer.<br>
OH F (A)<br>
Since gemcitabine is an erythro enantiomer having the 3-hydroxy moiety oriented<br>
down (opposite to the 5-hydroxy group with respect to the place of the tetrahydrofuran ring),<br>
it is important in the preparation of gemcitabine to develop a method for preparing<br>
1-oxoribose erythro compounds having the 3-hydroxy group oriented down.<br>
US Patent No. 4,526,988 discloses a method for preparing an erythro 1-oxoribose<br>
compound via alkyl 2,2-difluoro-3-hydroxy-3-(2,2-dialkyldioxoran-4-yl)propionate, a 3:1<br>
mixture of 3R-hydroxy enantiomer of formula (B) and 3S-hydroxy enantiomer of (Figure Removed) <br>
R4 and R5 are each independently Q.3 alkyl.<br>
However, such a method involves an uneconomical step of isolating only the<br>
3R-hydroxy enantiomer of formula (B) from the mixture of the compounds of (B) and (B1) in<br>
order to selectively prepare the desired erythro 1-oxoribose derivative, because the<br>
compounds of (B) and (B1) produce an erythro compound of formula (C) and a threo<br>
compound of formula (C), respectively, as shown in Reaction Scheme A and B.<br>
Further, the method also has the problem that it takes a long reaction time, almost<br>
four days at room temperature.<br>
Meanwhile, US Patent Nos. 4,965,374; 5,223,608; and 5,434,254 disclose a method<br>
for obtaining an erythro enantiomer of formula (D), as shown in Reaction Scheme C, by (i)<br>
hydrolyzing and azeotropically distilling a 3-benzoyloxypropionate ester of formula (E) (a<br>
3:1 mixture of 3R- and 3S-enantiomers) to obtain a lactone compound of formula (F); (ii)<br>
protecting the 5-hydroxy group of the compound of formula (F) with benzoyl to obtain a<br>
3,5-dibenzoyloxy compound of formula (G); and (iii) cooling the compound of formula (G)<br>
to -5 ~10°C to precipitate only the erythro enantiomer of formula (D).<br>
However, the above method is uneconomical due to its overall low yield of about<br>
25% and the use of an expensive and toxic trifluoroacetic acid in an excess amount in the<br>
hydrolyzing process.<br>
Further, US Patent Nos. 5,428,176 and 5,618,951 teach a method of preparing a<br>
2,2-difluoro-p-silyloxy-l,3-dioxolane-4-propionic acid ester of formula (H) having a high<br>
3R-silylhydroxy enantiomer content by reacting a 2,2-difluoroketene silyl acetal with a<br>
glyceraldehyde derivative in a solvent such as 1,3-dimethylpropylene urea (DMPU), as<br>
shown in Reaction Scheme D.<br>
Reaction Scheme D<br>
R F<br>
OSiR6R7R8<br>
wherein, R6 to R9 are alkyl; and R10 and R11 are d.3 alkyl.<br>
However, this method also requires an uneconomical column chromatography<br>
process for isolating the 3R-enantiomer from the mixture of the enantiomers.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors have endeavored to develop an efficient method<br>
for selectively preparing 1-oxoribose compounds having an erythro structure, and have<br>
unexpectedly found an efficient, novel method for preparing highly pure<br>
2,2-difluoro-2-deoxy- 1-oxoribose having an erythro structure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient method<br>
for selectively preparing 2,2-difmoro-2-deoxy- 1-oxoribose derivatives having an erythro<br>
structure.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a 3R-enantiomer compound<br>
which can be used as an intermediate in said method.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method<br>
for preparing a 2,2-difluoro-2-deoxy-l-oxoribose derivative of formula (I), comprising the<br>
steps of (i) reacting a compound of formula (V) with a biphenylcarbonyl derivative to obtain<br>
a compound of formula (TV) having the 3-hydroxy group protected by a biphenylcabonyl<br>
group; (ii) reacting the compound of formula (IV) with a base in a mixed solvent essentially<br>
comprising water to obtain a 3R-carboxylate enantiomer of formula (El); (iii) reacting the<br>
compound of formula (III) with an acid to obtain a 5-hydroxy-l-oxoribose derivative of<br>
formula (n); and (iv) protecting the 5-hydroxy group of the compound of formula (II) <br>
R3 is benzoyl or<br>
R4 is phenyl or substituted phenyl; and<br>
M is ammonium (NHU), sodium or potassium.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
3R-carboxylate enantiomer of formula (HI):<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
water to obtain a 5-hydroxy-1-oxoribose of formula (H) having an erythro structure; and<br>
protecting the 5-hydroxy of the compound of formula (If) according to a conventional<br>
method.<br>
The inventive method is characterized in that it is possible to selectively obtain the<br>
3R-carboxylate enantiomer of fonnula (DDT) by protecting the 3-hydroxy group of the<br>
compound of formula (V) with a biphenylcarbonyl group, and obtaining the 1-oxoribose<br>
derivative of formula (I) having a desired erythro structure therefrom.<br>
Since the compound of formula (HI) can be obtained selectively as a solid in the<br>
inventive method, it can be easily isolated using a simple filtering process without<br>
conducting an uneconomical column chromatography or other purification processes.<br>
Accordingly, the use of the compound of formula (II) as an intermediate is the unique<br>
feature of the inventive method which is suitable for a large-scale production of the<br>
1-oxoribose derivative.<br>
The compound of formula (V) used as a starting material in the inventive method<br>
may be prepared by a conventional method described in US Patent Nos. 4,526,988;<br>
4,965,374; 5,223,608; and 5,434,254, as shown in Reaction Scheme H.<br>
Reaction Scheme H<br>
wherein, R, R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined above.<br>
In Reaction Scheme n, the compound of formula (V), a 3:1 mixture of 3R- and 3Senantiomers,<br>
may be prepared by mixing an aldehyde ketonide of formula (VII) with a<br>
difluoro compound of formula (VI), and allowing the mixture to undergo Reformatsky<br>
reaction using zinc.<br>
Further, a 3R-carboxylate of formula (III) can be prepared from the compound of<br>
formula (V), as shown in Reaction Scheme HI.<br>
Reaction Scheme ffl<br>
wherein, R, R1, R2 and M have the same meanings as defined above.<br>
hi Reaction Scheme HI, the 3R-carboxylate of formula (ET) can be obtained as a<br>
solid by; (i) protecting the 3-hydroxy group of the compound of formula (V) with a<br>
biphenylcarbonyl protecting group to obtain the compound of formula (TV); and (ii)<br>
hydrolyzing the compound of formula (TV) with a base.<br>
hi the inventive method, the protecting group used in step (i) may be a<br>
biphenylcarbonyl group which is a benzoyl group substituted with benzene ring optionally<br>
the benzene ring is substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen, cyano, halo, carboalkoxy, toluoyU nitro, alkoxy, alkyl and<br>
dialkylamino. Representative examples of biphenylcarbonyl include such as<br>
2-phenylbenzoyl (2-biphenylcarbonyl), 4-phenylbenzoyl (4-biphenylcarbonyl) and<br>
substituted 2-(or 4-) phenylbenzoyl, preferably 2-phenylbenzoyl and 4-phenylbenzoyl.<br>
Increased hydrophobicity due to the two benzene ring of biphenylcarbonyl group<br>
makes it possible to separate 3R-carboxylate of formula (HI) as a solid even in the water <br>
water containing mixed solvent<br>
On the other hand, in case of using a conventional benzoyl group as a hydroxy<br>
protecting group, it is impossible to get a 3R-carboxylate salt as a solid in the water or water<br>
containing mixed solvent.<br>
In contrast, in case of introducing a conventional hydroxy protecting group such as<br>
1-naphtoyl, 2-naphtoyl, pivaloyl or acetyl for the 3-hydroxy group of the compound of<br>
formula (V), it is very difficult to selectively isolate the 3R-carboxylate of formula (HI) as a<br>
solid from the resulting reaction mixture.<br>
The biphenylcarbonyl-based compound used in step (i) may be selected from the<br>
group consisting of biphenylcarbonyl (or substituted biphenylcarbonyl) chloride, bromide,<br>
cyanide or azide, which may be commercially obtained or chemically synthesized in<br>
accordance with conventional methods.<br>
Also, the base used in the neutralization process of step (i) may be selected from the<br>
group consisting of pyridine, triethylamine, tributylamine, diisopropylethylamine and<br>
methylpiperidine, preferably triethylamine; a catalyst used in the acylation may be<br>
4-dimethylaminopyridine or 4-pyrolidinopyridine; and the acylation may be conducted at<br>
-25 to 50°C.<br>
In the hydrolysis of step (ii), the base may be selected from the group consisting of<br>
gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium hydroxide and a mixture<br>
thereof, preferably potassium bicarbonate, which may be employed in an amount of 1<br>
equivalent or more, preferably ranging from 1.5 to 5 equivalents based on the compound <br>
Also, the mixed solvent essentially comprising water may be a mixture of water and<br>
an organic solvent selected from the group consisting of tetrahydrofuran, dioxane,<br>
acetonitrile, acetone, methylisobutylketone, methylethylketone, methanol, ethanol, propanol,<br>
isopropanol, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, ethyl acetate and a<br>
mixture thereof, preferably a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol; and the water may be<br>
employed in an amount ranging from 3 to 15 ml, preferably from 5 to 11 ml, and the organic<br>
solvent, from 3 to 30 ml, preferably from 6 to 18 ml, based on 1.0 g of the compound of<br>
formula (IV). The hydrolysis may be conducted at 5 to 50°C, preferably 10 to 30°C for min to 2 hours.<br>
The compound of formula (ID) may be isolated easily from the reaction mixture<br>
obtained in step (ii), by removing the organic solvent under a reduced pressure, and filtering<br>
the resulting mixture; or by extracting the reaction mixture with an organic solvent, and<br>
recrystallizing the product in a mixed solvent essentially comprising water.<br>
In the inventive method, the 3R-carboxylate of formula (IH) may be obtained from<br>
the compound of formula (V) in a high yield of 60 to 70% via a potassium or sodium salt, or<br>
about 40% when an ammonium salt is used as a base in step (ii). Further, the compound of<br>
formula (III) obtained in the inventive method has a 3R-carboxylate content of more than<br>
99.7% while the 3S-carboxvlate content is less than 0.3% (consequently, e.e value over<br>
99.4%).<br>
The compound of formula (I) having the erythro structure may be obtained from the<br>
compound of formula (ID) in a highly enantioselective manner, as shown in Reaction<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
wherein, R, R, R3 and M have the same meanings as defined above.<br>
In Reaction Scheme IV, the compound of formula (I) may be prepared by (iii)<br>
reacting the compound of formula (HI) with an acid in a solvent to obtain the compound of<br>
formula (II) having the erythro structure as a result of conducting the cascade of reactions<br>
comprising the neutralization of the carboxylate, removal of the isoalkylidene protecting<br>
group to produce a diol carboxylic acid of formula (VHI), and lactonization of the compound<br>
of formula (VET); and (iv) protecting the 5-hydroxy group of the compound of formula (IT)<br>
with a protecting group containing a hydrophobic benzene ring.<br>
The acid used in the inventive step (iii) may be a strong acid having a pka value<br>
ranging from -10.0 to 2.0, which may be selected from the group consisting of an inorganic<br>
acid such as 1 to 12 N HC1 and 1 to 9 N HaSO-t, and an organic acid such as methanesulfonic<br>
acid, p-toluenesulfom'c acid, trifluoroacetic acid and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid,<br>
preferably 12 N HC1 and trifluoroacetic acid, more preferably 12 N HC1; employed in an<br>
amount ranging from 1 to 2 equivalents, preferably 1.1 to 1.5 equivalents based on the<br>
compound of formula (HI).<br>
Meanwhile, the reaction product of step (iii) may be regulated so as to comprise 1 to<br>
10 equivalents, preferably 2 to 5 equivalents of water based on the compound of formula<br>
(HI), for instance, by adding an aqueous solution thereto, e.g., an aqueous inorganic acid<br>
having an appropriate concentration, or an aqueous solvent such as 95% ethanol, in order to<br>
effectively remove the isoalkylidene group. The solvent used in step (iii) may be selected<br>
from the group consisting of acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, ethanol, methanol<br>
10<br>
and isopropanol, preferably acetonitrile.<br>
Step (iii) may be carried out at a refluxing temperature of the solvent for 4 to 8 hours<br>
to remove the isoalkylidene group; and the resulting mixture may be mixed with a solvent<br>
such as benzene and toluene, and azeotropically distilled to remove water from the reaction<br>
mixture to obtain the lactonized compound of formula (IT).<br>
In step (iv), the protecting group may be selected from the group consisting o f<br>
benzoyl, phenylbenzoyl and substituted benzoyl, preferably 2-phenylbenzoyl,<br>
4-phenylbenzoyl and substituted 2- (or 4-) phenylbenzoyl.<br>
Also, step (iv) may be conducted after isolating the compound of formula (II)<br>
obtained in step (iii), or conducted without such an isolating process in situ. The in situ<br>
process is preferred.<br>
The compound of formula (I) obtained in the inventive method exhibits a high purity<br>
of about 99% of the 1-oxoribose compound having the desired erythro structure.<br>
Further, the inventive method has a total yield of 45 to 50%, which is improved more<br>
than 20% relative to the conventional methods.<br>
The following Examples are intended to further illustrate the present invention<br>
