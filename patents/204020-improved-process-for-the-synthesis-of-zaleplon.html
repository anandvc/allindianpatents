"IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF ZALEPLON"<br>
(a)	CIPLA LTD.<br>
(b)	289, Bellasis Road, Mumbai Central, Mumbai - 400 008, Maharashtra, India<br>
(c)	Indian Companylhcorporated under the Companies Act 1956<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for producing N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo-[l,5-a]-pyrimidin-7-yl)-phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide known as zaleplon. It possesses anxiolytic, antiepileptic, sedative &amp; hypnotic properties. It is also used in the treament of insomnia.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Various prior art patents report the synthesis of zaleplon. US 4,626,538 discloses novel N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidin-7-yl)phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide compounds and a process for synthesis of the same. The patent discloses the final step cyclisation of 3-amino 4-cyano pyrazole with N-ethyl-[3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide in acetic acid to give zaleplon. N-ethyl-[3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide is prepared by N-alkylation of 3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide with ethyl iodide in presence of sodium hydride. Alternatively 3-(3-cyanopyrazolo-[l,5-a]-pyrimidin-7-yl)-phenyl]-acetamide is alkylated with ethyl iodide in presence of sodium hydride, alkoxides and like to give zaleplon. This process leads to formation of impurities and gives a very low yield of zaleplon. The final product requires further purification.<br>
In our invention we have claimed the use of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide sodium methoxide, sodium tert-butoxide and potassium tert-butoxide for the N-alkylation of N-[3-[3-(dimethyl amino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]phenyl]alkanamide with ethyl iodide. This process avoids use of hazardous sodium hydride, which is difficult and unsafe to handle on production scale. Using metal alkoxides or hydroxides is much safer and easy to handle, it makes the process inexpensive and eco-friendly. Using this process we get high yields and with high purity (99% HPLC purity).<br>
In the second embodiment of US 462658, N[3-[3-(dimethyl amino )-l-oxo-2-propenyl]phenyl]alkanamide is reacted with 3-amino pyrazole to give intermediate 3-(3-<br>
2.<br><br>
cyanopyrazolo-[l,5-a]-pyrimidin-7-yl)-phenyl]-alkanamide which are reacted with a base such as sodium hydride, sodium alkoxide and the like with alkyl halide to give 3-(3-cyanopyrazolo-[l,5-a]-pyrimidin-7-yl)-phenyl]-alkyl alkanamide. The second embodiment or alternate process mentioned in US 462658 is different from the process of our invention.<br>
Further it described the condensation of N [3-[3-(diemthylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]phenyl]ethyl acetamide with 3-amino pyrazole by refluxing in acetic acid. This reaction results in Zaleplon having low purity with high content of the regioisomer. The resulting Zaleplon can not be used as such for pharmaceutical use, it requires further purification which leads to yield loss.<br>
In the present invention condensation is carried out in three different catalysts such as water miscible acid, water immiscible acid and cation exchange resin, all these reactions give to a good yields of Zaleplon having high level of purity 99.9% (HPLC purity) and having regioisomer content less than 0.1%. This process provides high purity which requires no further purification and making it ideally suitable for pharmaceutical use.<br>
EP0776898 Al describes an improved process for large-scale production of zaleplon. It describes a reaction between 3-dimethylamino-l-(3-N-ethyl-N-acetylaminophenyl)-2-propen-1-one and 3-amino-4-cyano pyrazole or a suitable salt thereof in a mixture comprising water and acetic acid. Improved yields, decrease in reaction time and purity is achieved by adding water to the acetic acid. The method described also works utilizing salts of either or both starting materials.<br>
WO02/12244 A2 discloses novel crystalline polymorphic forms of zaleplon namely Forms I, II and III. and methods for the preparation thereof. Form I is an anhydrous crystal form, while forms II and III are crystalline forms which can be anhydrous or hydrates.<br>
3<br><br>
US2002/0072527 discloses process for preparation of novel crystalline polymorphic forms of zaleplon namely Forms I, II and III.<br>
WO 02100828 A2 describes a process for purifying zaleplon and crystalline forms of zaleplon. This invention also describes purification a process of separating zaleplon and regioisomer that tends to form as a byproduct in the synthesis of zaleplon.<br>
WO 03/011228 A2 relates to novel crystalline polymorphic forms of zaleplon and method for the preparation thereof, and their therapeutic uses.<br>
US 2003040522 describes a process for preparation of zaleplon that involves mixing N-[3-(3-(dimethyl amino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl) phenyl] -N-ethyl acetamide or a salt thereof and 3-amino-4-cyanopyrazole or a salt thereof in liquid reaction medium of water and at least one water miscible organic compound free of carboxylic acid group such as CI to C6 alcohol, nitriles, ethers, nitro compounds, amides and sulfoxide in 10 to 90 % (v/v) ratio with water; forming Zaleplon under acidic condition via an intermediates imine soluble in reaction medium at 10 to 100° C, more particularly 20 to 25° C and the slat step is recovery of Zaleplon from reaction medium. In this prior art Zaleplon obtained has low HPLC purity (in the range of 96-99 % purity) and the product is then subjected to crystallization or column purification as described in the patent to give Zaleplon which is of pharmaceutical use leading to a substantial loss in yield making the process not suitable for scale-up and industrial application.<br>
While the present invention discloses condensation reaction of N(3-(3-diemthyl amino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl)phenyl)-N-ethyl acetamide and 3-amino-4-cyano pyrazole using water immiscible acids in aqueous solvent / cation exchange resin in protic polar solvents / water miscible organic acid in non-aqueous solvent. The present invention provides Zaleplon with good yield and high purity. Further the process does not require any purification and it does not involve the use of any hazardous reagents or raw material making it ideally suitable for scale up industrial application.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Synthesis of N-[3-[3-(Dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide so far described uses strong base such as sodium hydride for the alkylation of 3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide formed by refluxing 3-acetamidoacetophenone with Dimethyl formamide-dimethyl acetal. The present invention discloses a simple method for the N-alkylation of 3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide using milder bases such as hydroxides and alkoxides of alkali metals.<br>
Cyclisation of 3-amino 4-cyano pyrazole with N-ethyl-[3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide in acetic acid gives zaleplon. This process leads to formation of impurities and gives a very low yield of zaleplon.<br>
The cyclisation is described in various prior art processes to proceed under acidic conditions by either use of acid solvents such as acetic acid, or use of various organic or inorganic acids in water or in a mixture of water and a water miscible solvent. The use of the corresponding salts of these intermediates has also been described.<br>
The present invention provides a simple, efficient and novel method for preparation of zaleplon by making use of water immiscible organic acids and suitable solvents for carrying out the cyclisation reaction between 3-amino 4-cyano pyrazole and N-ethyl-[3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide. This process leads to formation of low levels of impurities and gives a very high yield of zaleplon.<br>
The present invention describes a process for the cyclisation of 3-amino 4-cyano pyrazole and N-ethyl-[3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide in the presence suitable cation exchange resins in suitable solvents.<br>

More preferably, the present invention discloses a process for the alkylation of 3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide with ethyl iodide in the presence of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide using dimethyl formamide as a solvent at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 100°C, more preferably between 20°C to 30°C.<br>
The present invention also discloses a process for the alkylation of 3-[3-(dimethylamino)-l-oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-acetamide with ethyl iodide in the presence of sodium methoxide or potassium t-butoxide using dimethyl formamide as a solvent at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 100°C, more preferably between 20°C to 30°C. Condensation between N-[3-[3-(Dimethylamino)-l -oxo-2-propenyl]-phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide (II) and 3-amino-4-cyanopyrrazole (III) requires acidic condition &amp; it proceeds through formation of an intermediate imine product. The imine on further treatment under acidic conditions gives Zaleplon (I) as depicted in fig 1.<br>
