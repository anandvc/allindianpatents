				<td>This invention relates to a device for air suction and leakage indicator.<br>
The use of air eliminiator is well established in the prior art in the petroleum product filing plants at the petrolium filing terminal or depot. The air eliminiator is used to eliminate air from the petrolium product during filling operation. However, when the plant is switched off after the filling operation or due to power failure, the air is sucked in by the plant to maintain the level of the petroleum product in the plant as well as storage tank.<br>
Further another disadvantage is that the leakage of the petrolium products also takes places from the air eliminiator and which is deducted only when the operator observe each and every air eliminiator during filling operation which is a very tedious job otherwise leaked oil falls on ground and goes waste.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that there is no leakage indicator provided in the petrolium product filling plants to find out the leakage of a particular air eliminiator.<br>
Further  still another disadvantage  is  that<br>
when  the  plant  is  switched On  again  the  shock  is generated  in the main header of the plant and thus  for<br>
initial start of filling operation, a line shock  (water hammer effect) of very high intensity is observed at the<br>
dead  end of the header and which some time damages  the equipment and thus the operator is halted.<br>
Therefore  the main object of this  invention is  to  provide  a suction  air  preventer  cum  leakage<br>
indicator  to obviate the disadvantages associated  with the prior art.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to provide  a suction air preventor cum  leakage  indicator which  does  not  allow air to be  sucked  in  from  air eliminator.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a suction air preventor air leakage indicator<br>
which indicates that a particular air elininiator is leaked and thus gives an alarm to the operation of the<br>
plant.<br>
A device for air suction and leakage indicator characterized in that is a float (1) moveably provided on a guide rode (2) and within a housing (3) for accumulation of leaked oil received from an air eliminator, an air suction preventor (4) provided at the inlet end of housing (3) to prevent the suction of the air by air eliminator, ex-proof Junction box (5) conveying the signals to the audio/visual alarm system secured with a plate (6), secured with top cover (7) of the housing (3), an outlet (8) on the opposite side of the housing (3) for over flow of the excess liquid filled in the housing, a stopper (9) is to stop upward movement of the float (1) and to convey the signals to the ex-proof Junction box.<br>
In accordance with this invention a float is movably provided on a guide rod disposed in a housing provided for the accumlation of oil received from an air eliminiator. A suction air preventor is provided at the inlet end of the housing for allowing the entry of the leaked oil received from the air eliminiator into the housing and similarly to stop the suction of the air by the air eliminator upon switching off the plant. An Ex-proof Junction box is provided with a plate adapted to be secured with the cover of the housing such that to complete the energy circuit upon reaching the flow at a particular height within the housing and thus to switch on the audio visual alarm indicator that a particular air eliminator is leaked. A stopper is provided on the guide rod to stop the upward movement of the float after a<br>
particular height and to convey the signals to the alarm system<br>
through the Ex-proof Junction box. An outlet is provided at the<br>
other side of the housing towards the top end for allowing the<br>
flow of the excess of the floid accumulating in the housing. A drain is provided at the bottom end of the housing for discharging the petroleum product from the housing.<br>
Air suction preventer is mounted on the vent of Air Eliminator. This device expels air present in the system. It consist of float and seat mechanism. When air is present in the system float comes down opening the vent port, allowing air to expel. When liquid level rises float moves up closing the vent port preventing liquid to escape. Whenever more air comes, float comes down allowing air to release. This whole process is repeated till complete air is eliminated. However when operation is stopped, liquid level comes down and vaccum is created in the main header leading to air suction from vent port. The air suction preventer, does not allow air to be sucked from the vent port, thus eliminating the cause of water hammer effect, line shocks, vapour loss etc. Whenever pump operation is started, pressure/level in the header increases and float moves up closing the vent.<br>
Leakage indicator is connected to the outlet of Air Suction Preventer. Discharge/Overflow outlet is opened to the atmosphere. Leakage indicator has a float which moves on a guide. This guide has a sensor which gets activated when float reaches that particular point. When seat of air eliminator leaks (due to damage/foreign particle) product comes out through Air Suction Preventer and starts collecting in Leakage Indicator vessel. When liquid level rises float moves up and activates sensor, which gives a potential free contact and same can be used for visual indication, audibal alarm, remote indication or inter locking with electronic batch controller to stop loading and give alarm/fault condition in control room. Immediate corrective action can be taken for that particular point without delay, which would not have been possible otherwise.<br>
A device for air suction and leakage indicator according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:-<br>
Fig. 1 shows sectional view of the air suction preventer cum leakage indicator and<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig. 1<br>
the air suction air preventor cum leakage indicator has float 1 provided movably on a guide rod 2 disposed in a<br>
casing or housing 3. A suction air preventor 4 is provided on the inlet end of the housing 3 such that to<br>
allow the entry of the oil received from the air eliminiator and also to stop the suction of the air by<br>
the air preventor upon switching Off the filling plant. An Ex-proof JN box 5 is secured with a plate &amp;<br>
adapted to be secured with the top cover 7 of the housing. An outlet 8 is provided at the other side of<br>
the housing 3 of the over flow of the accumulated liquid present in the vessel. The Ex explosion proof JN<br>
(junction) box is provided for conveying the signals to the audio visual alarm system so that to complete the<br>
energy circuit and energies the alarm system. A stopper 9 is provided to stop the upward movement of the float 1<br>
and to convey the signals to the ex-proof JN box.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
