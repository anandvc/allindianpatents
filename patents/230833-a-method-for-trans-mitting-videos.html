				<td>VIDEO COMMUNICATION METHOD<br>
The present invention relates generally to a video communication method, telecommunication methods and, more specifically, to a method which makes video telecommunicating more convenient.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Today, the video camera recorder (Camcorder) has revolutionized how people make home movies. Over the years people have evolved from the use of photo sensitive films developed for projection onto movie screens, to the use of electronic recordings shown on television sets. The television evening news regularly show scenes of floods, hurricanes and other such happenings that have been recorded by amateurs using video cameras. By means of a small and easy to use video camera anyone can replay on their video cassette recorder (VCR) and television set the most trivial to the most significant of events.<br>
Videos' are quickly becoming a very important medium of communications. Job applicants resort to submitting their curriculum vitea on videos. New songs on the Hit Parade list have their own promotional videos. "How to operate" videos are now provided with the purchase of home appliances - for instance. Television feature documentaries promote the availability of their videos.<br>
Today most North American households have VCR's. Nearly 20 percent have Camcorders. Videos, as a medium of communications have become a pervasive growth phenomena.<br>
Surprisingly, and in spite of today's technology, these electronically recorded videos must<br>
be forwarded by mail and courier services if they are to be sent anywhere. There is no<br>
electronic communication service available to ferry these videos across the country and around<br>
the world.	There is a need to link all these households with an electronic highway for videos,, _It should be possible to access such an electronic highway through one's TSSP. Once on this highway, it should be possible to reach the desired recipient through the latter's TSSP.<br>
Known telecommunication services were developed and tailormade for the written word (telegraph and telex), for pictures (facsimile) and for the spoken word (telephone). Today, there is a need for a telecommunication service which is tailormade for videos.<br>
Existing public telecommunication services have failed to provide a convenient and economical solution.<br>
Problem.s in the Art l-l      Bandwidth<br>
Although videos are often of shorter duration, they require the same standard 6 megahertz broadcast channel bandwidth as normal television programming seen on television. It follows that the inability to come up with a satisfactory videophone over the years is in part due to the large bandwidth required for the satisfactory transmission of video over the public telephone network.<br>
In theory, existing analogue cable televison would have the necessary bandwidth for the transmission of videos. However, in practice, it does not have much spare channel capacity to either receive or send videos.<br>
Although the direct-to-home satellite system (another TSSP) could allow for receiving videos, in practice it only has a normal telephone tine as an up-stream link which would not make possible the sending of videos via the satellite system.<br>
f-'or its part,  the microwave multipoint distribution systems (MMDS), the new 25<br>
gigahertz analogue wireless cable television, has a very limited channel capacity for receiving videos but could be used to send videos from rural areas.<br>
As for the proposed video dial tone networks (which would permit electronic delivery of movies from the video store) they could also be used to receive videos. However, the telephone companies (the creators of such services) are only planning on providing bandwidth in the receive direction. It could not therefore be used to send videos in its currently planned format.<br>
1-2      Public broadband switching network<br>
The necessary intciconnecting network, to handle video traffic between TSSPs, does not exist. There is no countrywide public switched broadbhand-network (PSBN). Even the Internet will require'a PSBN to adequately handle its own video requirements.<br>
1-3      Video address<br>
There exists a need to provide a unique address for forwarding; videos to their destination, and customers,of TSSP for their part already have unique addresses within their network but the TSSP per se need unique addresses.<br>
Known solutions 2-1       Bandwidth<br>
Digital transmission providing better quality television signals is now a reality. This has allowed the introduction of digital video compression which can currently cram 8 to 10 video programs onto the standard 6 megahertz of bandwidth. Digital wireless cable, local multipoint communicadon systems (LMCS), will have the necessary bandwidth and channel capacity to receive and send videos once they become operational sometime in the future It is anticipated<br>
that the cable television companies will begin at least a partial conversion ro digital operation within the next 2 to 3 years, making them capable of receiving and sending videos,<br>
The Telephone companies can be expected to eventually upgrade their one way video dial -rone type service to allow for the sending of videos as well,<br>
2-2      Public switched broadband network<br>
The telephone companies are now introducing new digital broadband networks which are based on the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) for broadband integrated services digital network (B-ISDN),<br>

Further objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description, reference being made to die accompanying drawings wherein preferred embodiments of the invention are clearly shown.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will be further understood from the following description with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a flow chart illustration setting forth the receiving part, of, a video communication of the invention;<br>
figure 2 -is a flow chart illustration setting forth the sending part of a video communication of the invention;<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart illustration setting forth the video communication network of the invention;<br>
Figure 4 is a flow chart illustration setting forth the steps of a video communication call of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
How it is received<br>
Figure 1 shows that a video communication will be received via downstream 112 at home or office 111 having a set top control unit 100 and telephone 101, a video recorder 102 and a television set 103. The majority of North American homes already have these home electronic entertainment devices. Newer models of these devices will incorporate the specific automated features of the video communication service.<br>
The set top control unit 100 will be connected to a TSSP 104 such as: direct-to-home satellite television 105, video-dial-tone 106, digital wireless cable television local multipoint communications systems (LMCS) 107 or digital cable television 108. Most North American<br>
households will have access to one or more such TSSP.<br>
The video communication will be received from the TSSP 104 network, which in turn will have received it from the digital broadband switching and transmission networks 109, if the video is being received form another TSSP 104<br>
An indicator on the set top control unit 100 or on the-video recorder 102 will signal when a video communication has been received.<br>
It should be noted that it is also possible to receive a video communication via an existing VHF or UHF television broadcasting station 1 10 as well as via an analogue cable television or Hn analogue wireless cable television network. Obviously, it would have to occur when the station is not scheduled for regular programming, such as during the middle of the night. Such a video communication would be available for anyone to record, providing that they were tuned to that channel at that time. Eventually, when these systems are converted to digital operation, it would be possible to piggy-back a video communication delivery service over these channels.<br>
it is sent<br>
Figure 2 shows that from the home or office 200, the video communication will be sent to one's TSSP 104 via an upstream channel 201. which in turn will be connected to the digital broadband switching and transmission networks 109 to reach the destination (receiver) TSSP 104 and consequently the destination subscriber 111. If the video is not going to another TSSP 104 the connection to the digital broadband switching and transmission is not required.<br>
The video communication will be sent from the sender's video recorder 102. The actual video communication call will be dialed through the sender's set top control unit 100. The sender's TSSP will handle the necessary billing. The number dialed being the destination 1 1 1<br>
Public kiosks<br>
Public kiosks 202 could be set up for people unable or not wiling to send video communications from their home or office. These kiosks could be located next to automated teller banking machine installations.<br>
As in the case of the sending from home or office 700 the kiosk would also use a video recorder and a set top control unit 100 and telephone 101,_ However, these would have been Turther modified to handle payments 203. The kiosk would be connected to a digital TSSP 104. It would be possible as well to provide special connections to analogue wireless cable television in rural areas.<br>
Pre-inscribed blank video;<br>
It would be possible to pre-inscribe on blank tapes or disks (or other storage media) the video communication address of the destination 111 subscriber. This could simplify and speed up the sending of these video communications.<br>
The Network<br>
Figure 3 shows the overall network used to receive and send video communications. It is the linking of all the TSSP 104 by means of the digital broadband switching and transmission networks 109. It is also the full exploitation of the upstream 201 capabilities of the TSSP 104. It makes full use of home electronic entertainment devices.<br>
TSSP<br>
Any telecommunication company which provides normal entertainment type television Signals to the subscriber on a per fee (or subscription) basis can become a link to the video communication network, once it uses digital transmission means. These TSSP 104 have the customer bases for the service. It will be their subscribers that will be the video communication customers who receive and send video communications.<br>
The sender's TSSP 104 whose subscriber originates the video communication will be responsible for monitoring the duration of the call and consequently billing the customer. The sender's TSSP would also be responsible for settling payments due for the use of the broadband and the far end service provider networks.<br>
Steos of a call<br>
The steps of a video communication are shown in Figure 4. These steps outline, in point form, the setting up and subsequent clearing down of such a call:<br>
1)	loading the video into a video recorder ;<br>
2)	seizing an upstream channel;<br>
3)	entering the destination video communication number;<br>
4)	initiating the video communication call;<br>
5)	connecting the destination downstream channel;<br>
6)	turning on the destination video recorder;<br>
7)	receiving the destination ready signal;<br>
8)	starting billing procedure;<br>
9)	sending the video communication;<br><br>
10)	clearing the connection;<br>
11)	ending the billing procedure;<br>
12)	clearing the destination.<br>
PC Access<br>
Video configured PC's will have access to the video communication network through TSSP 104,  They will be able to send and receive video communications.<br>
Live video transmission<br>
The above configured video communication network can be used to carry live video<br>
transmission when a video camera is connected.<br>
The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein.<br><br><br><br><br>
