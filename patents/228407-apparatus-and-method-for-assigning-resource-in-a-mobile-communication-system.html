				<td>APPARAUTS AND METHOD FOR ASSIGNING RESOURCE IN A<br>
 MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a resource assignment<br>
apparatus and method in a mobile communication system supporting, and in<br>
particular, to an apparatus and method for assigning resource in a mobile<br>
communication system provided for transmitting voice information.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
As the number of mobile communication subscribers rapidly increases<br>
and mobile communication services are provided in association with Internet<br>
services, a study is being conducted on technology for enabling the subscribers to<br>
receive various types of data services such as Internet services and multimedia<br>
services through mobile communication terminals. A mobile communication<br>
system for providing such data services uses employs Multiple Access. Typically,<br>
Multiple Access is classified into Time division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code<br>
Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and Frequency division Multiple Access<br>
(FDMA). A CDMA 2000 1x system supporting CDMA among the technologies<br>
will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br>
The CDMA 2000 lx system, as illustrated in FIG. 1, is divided into a<br>
plurality of base stations (BSs) 20, a mobile switching center (MSC) 30 for<br>
switching voice data and packet data transmitted/received by a mobile station 10<br>
to a corresponding destination in association with the base stations 20, and a<br>
packet data service node (PDSN) 40 for interfacing with an external network. In<br>
addition, the CDMA 2000 lx system includes an interworking function (IWF) 50<br>
for converting circuit data into packet data before concatenation upon receipt of a<br>
data transmission request from the mobile switching center 30, and a packet<br>
control function (PCF) 60 for interfacing voice data and packet data between the<br>
packet data service node 40 and the base station 20.<br>
The base station 20 is comprised of base transceiver stations (BTSs) 22<br>
and 23, and a base station controller (BSC) 21 for controlling the base transceiver<br>
stations 22 and 23.<br>
Signal between the mobile switching center 30 and the base station<br><br>
controller 21 are defined in an Al interface, and user information therebetween is<br>
defined in A2/A5 interfaces (or circuit data-only interfaces). An A3 interface (not<br>
shown) is defined to simultaneously transmit/receive control signals and user data<br>
during reverse frame selection and forward frame forwarding between a current<br>
base station controller and another base station controller when soft handoff<br>
occurs to the mobile station 10.<br>
The base station controller 21 includes a transcoder (Xcoder) 24. The<br>
transcoder 24 (hereinafter referred to as a "vocoder"), when the base station<br>
controller 21 receives a radio vocoder frame transmitted from the mobile station<br>
10, such as Enhanced Variable-Rate Codec (EVRC) frame, Selectable Mode<br>
Vocoder (SMV) frame and Qualcomm-Code Excited Linear Prediction Coding<br>
(Q-CELP) frame, converts the received radio vocoder frame into a Pulse Code<br>
Modulation (PCM) vocoder frame in order to forward the vocoder frame to a<br>
wired concentrating network.<br>
Generally, voice signals transmitted on a wired line are transmitted at a<br>
rate of 64 Kbps on a TDM transmission line. Therefore, the TDM-based<br>
transmission line is also used for transmission of voice signals between the base<br>
transceiver stations 22 and 23 and the base station controller 21, and between the<br>
base station controller 21 and the mobile switching center 30. Because voice<br>
signals are transmitted on a wired line, a specific TDM logical channel must be<br>
assigned for transmission of the voice signals. If a fixed channel is set up for only<br>
one user in a TDM logical channel transmitted on a wired line, voice signals of<br>
other users cannot be transmitted through the channel. In addition, a channel for<br>
transmitting the voice signals, after it is assigned to a user who cannot transmit<br>
other packet data, becomes a fixed channel. Therefore, until communication of a<br>
corresponding user ends, a specific channel on a wired line must be assigned for<br>
only one user undesirably.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
efficiently assigning vocoder resource for data transmission between a base<br>
(Station controller and a media gateway in a packet-based mobile communication<br>
system.<br><br>
To achieve the above and other objects, there is provided a method for<br>
transmitting/receiving packet data using a base station in a mobile communication<br>
system for transmitting/receiving the packet data including a voice call. The<br>
method comprises receiving a call attempt message from a mobile station;<br>
transmitting a service request message including a frame offset for call<br>
processing; receiving a frame offset included in a reply message for the service<br>
request message; and setting up a radio channel to the mobile station based on the<br>
received frame offset.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
A next generation mobile communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 2, is divided into an<br><br>
MSC emulator (MSCe) 130 for managing call control and mobility control for an<br>
existing mobile switching center 30, and a media gateway (MGW) 140 for<br>
transcoding and forwarding voice data. Here, the media gateway 140 includes a<br>
transcoder 141 therein, and a base station controller 121 includes no transcoder.<br>
Accordingly, an existing bearer interface for transmitting voice information<br>
between the mobile switching center 30 and the base station controller 21<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1 corresponds to an interface between the media gateway 140<br>
and the base station controller 121 in a mobile communication system according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. Therefore, voice data between the<br>
base station controller 121 and the media gateway 140 is not transmitted with a<br>
64-Kbps PCM frame described in, the .conventional..technology, but is transmitted<br>
with a data frame generated by a jadip, vocoder. In addition, in order to forward<br>
voice information to be transmitted and received to/from a mobile station 110, a<br>
frame protocol capable of determining a transmission state between the media<br>
gateway 140 and the base station controller 121 and an arrival order of packets is<br>
newly set up. The newly setup frame protocol will be described herein below<br>
using Table 1 to Table 7.<br>
The next generation mobile communication system illustrated in FIG. 2<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention, which is a CDMA 2000 lx<br>
Legacy MS Domain (LMSD) system, is illustrated through a network reference<br>
model between a Radio Access Network (RAN) and a Core Network (CN). A<br>
structure of the next generation mobile communication system (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a "CDMA 2000 lx") will be described herein below with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawing.<br>
The CDMA 2000 lx LMSD system, as illustrated in FIG. 2, is comprised<br>
of a base station controller 121, an MSC emulator (MSCe) 130, a media gateway<br>
140, a packet control function (PCF) 150, and a packet data service node (PDSN)<br>
160. The existing MSC 30 is divided into the MSC emulator 130 and the media<br>
gateway 140. The base station controller 121 can also be described as a base<br>
station.<br>
The media gateway 140 interworking with the base station controller 121,<br>
includes a transcoder (or a vocoder) 141 for managing conversion between an<br>
analog voice signal into a digital signal. The transcoder 141 converts a voce data<br>
frame transmitted from a wired telephone into a radio vocoder frame used by a<br><br>
mobile station using PCM. In addition, the transcoder 141 converts voice data<br>
generated by a radio vocoder of the mobile station 110 into 64-Kbps PCM voice<br>
data.<br>
The MSC emulator 130 manages call control and mobility control, and<br>
controls the media gateway 140.<br>
The packet control function 150 interworking with the packet data service<br>
node 160 connected to the external network, performs handoff control and<br>
management, and manages a packet data service profile of a mobile station.<br>
A signal corresponding to a general Al interface is an 'Alp' interface<br>
between the MSC emulator 130 and the base station controller 121, and a signal<br>
corresponding to an A2 interface is an lA2p' interface between the base station<br>
controller 121 and the media gateway 140. Further, an out-of-band signaling<br>
process for bearer setup and management is performed through an 'Amp'<br>
interface between the base station controller 121 and the media gateway 140.<br>
Here, functions defined in the 'Amp' interface can also be performed in an A2p<br>
frame protocol through an in-of-band signaling process. The 'Alp', 'A2p' and<br>
'Amp' interfaces are not based on circuit, but based on packet (ATM or IP).<br>
An example of a protocol stack define interfaces between the base<br>
station controller 121 and the media gateway 140 and between the base station<br>
controller 121 and the MSC emulator 130 will be described herein below with<br>
reference to Table 1. The protocol stack described in connection with Table 1<br>
includes a part newly added according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
and a part needed to be changed in a general protocol stack in addition to the<br>
protocol stack defined in the current standard.<br><br><br><br>
Case 1 applied in the present invention through the above protocol stack<br>
will be described herein below, and a description of Case 2 will be omitted.<br>
Real time Transport Protocol (RTP) and Generic Route Encapsulation<br>
(GRE) used in an A2p protocol stack are slightly modified from general RTP and<br>
GRE in their functions, and it means that a function for multiplexing a plurality of<br>
users with one port and all functions of the general RTP and GRE are not required.<br>
'Amp' is an interface for out-of-band signaling in a control procedure<br>
provided in a frame protocol, and forms a separate interface (hereafter referred to<br>
as an "Amp interface"). When an Amp interface interworks with the media<br>
gateway 140 via the MSC emulator 130, Session Control Transmission Protocol<br>
(SCTP) is used for a protocol stack.<br>
A frame protocol defined in the protocol stack will be described in more<br>
detail herein below. A frame protocol operating on RTP and GRE provides a<br>
procedure for processing a voice data frame and a control procedure during<br>
transmission/reception of voice information between the media gateway 140 and<br>
the base station controller 121, and the frame protocol includes the following<br>
major functions.<br>
First, the frame protocol has a function of making a frame before<br>
transmission of voice data information, receiving a frame, separating control<br>
information and voice data information from the corresponding frame, and<br>
analyzing the separated control information and voice data information.<br>
Second, the frame protocol has an initialization function including a<br>
function of designating a frame number transmitted/received when a Quality-of-<br>
Service (QoS) of a transmission line or a frame is transmitted/received before<br>
voice data forwarding between the base station controller 121 and the media<br>
gateway 140.<br><br>
Third, the frame protocol has a function of setting up and maintaining<br>
synchronization during actual transmission/reception through a report on a delay<br>
in order to resolve the delay occurring during real-time transmission/reception of<br>
voice data.<br>
Fourth, the frame protocol has a vocoder transmission control function<br>
for equally changing a vocoder in the media gate way 140 during a change in data<br>
rate or transmission mode of a vocoder used by a mobile station.<br>
Fifth, the frame protocol has a function of adjusting a rate of voice data<br>
transmitted from the media gateway 140 at a particular time in order to multiplex<br>
a signaling message and secondary traffic generated by the base station controller<br>
121 using a Dim-and-Burst technique and a Blank-and-Burst technique and<br>
forwarding the multiplexed result to the mobile station.<br>
Sixth, the frame control has a function of assigning a vocoder in the<br>
media gateway 140.<br>
A method for assigning a vocoder using the sixth function among the<br>
functions of the frame protocol will be described herein below. In the following<br>
description, the vocoder resource assignment method is divided into a vocoder<br>
assignment procedure during call origination and a vocoder resource assignment<br>
procedure during hard handoff.<br>
First, the vocoder assignment procedure during call origination will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
When a mobile station (MS) 110 needs an origination call for a voice<br>
signal, the mobile station 110 sends an Origination (or call attempt) message to a<br>
base station controller (BSC) 121 to request origination of a voice call in step 301.<br>
Although omitted in FIG. 3, an origination call of the mobile station 110 can be<br>
connected to the base station controller 121 via base transceiver stations 122a and<br>
122b, or a router (not shown). In response, the bas station controller 121 sends a<br>
BS Ack Order message in step 302 to inform the mobile station 110 whether the<br>
Origination message has been received. Thereafter, in step 303, the base station<br>
controller 121 sends a Call Management (CM) Service Request message to an<br><br>
MSC emulator (MSCe) 130 using an Alp interface. Here, the base station<br>
controller 121 inserts Preferred Frame Offset for voice origination processing of<br>
the mobile station 110, received from the base transceiver stations 122a and 122b,<br>
and a bearer ID for voice data transmission into the CM Service Request message,<br>
before transmission. A value of Preferred Frame Offset means a frame offset<br>
value requested by the base station controller 121, and the bearer ID is used by a<br>
media gateway (MGW) 140 in setting up a bearer path for transmission of voice<br>
data. For example, RTP/UDP/IP Port or GRE/IP port can be used as the bearer ID.<br>
Table 2 illustrates the CM Service Request message, particularly, illustrates how a<br>
frame offset and a bearer ID are inserted into a general CM Service Request<br>
message. Other fields except Frame Offset and Bearer ID are identical to<br>
corresponding fields in the general CM Service Request message.<br><br><br><br>
In step 304, the MSC emulator 130 receiving the CM Service Request<br>
message inserts the Preferred Frame Offset value received from the base station<br>
controller 121 into a Media Gateway Control (MEGACO) Add Request message<br>
in the form of Session Description Protocol (SDP) information before<br>
transmission, in order to send a vocoder resource setup request to the media<br>
gateway 140.<br>
In step 305, the media gateway 140 receiving the MEGACO Add Request<br>
message from the MSC emulator 130 inserts Assigned Frame Offset information<br>
finally determined in a vocoder as a decision for a request of the Preferred Frame<br>
Offset requested by the base station controller 121 into a MEGACO Add Reply<br>
message in the form of SDP information, before transmission. At the same time,<br>
the media gateway 140 also designates MGW Bearer ID in the MEGACO Add<br>
Reply message before transmission. Thereafter, the media gateway 140 prepares<br>
necessary vocoder resource. A frame offset method for resource assignment in a<br>
vocoder will be described with reference to FIG. 5. In step 306, the MSC emulator<br><br>
130 includes the MGW Bearer ID received from the media gateway 140 and the<br>
Assigned Frame Offset value determined in the media gateway 140 in an<br>
Assignment Request message for ordering radio channel setup, and transmits the<br>
Assignment Request message to the base station controller 121. Table 3 illustrates<br>
the Assignment Request message, particularly, illustrates how a frame offset and a<br>
bearer ID are inserted into a general Assignment Request message. Other fields<br>
except Frame Offset and Bearer ID are identical to corresponding fields in the<br>
general Assignment Request message.<br><br>
In step 307, a radio traffic channel is set up between the mobile station<br>
110 and the base station controller 121 based on the Assignment Request message<br>
for ordering radio channel setup in step 306. In step 308, the base station<br>
controller 121, after the radio traffic channel is set up, sends an Assignment<br>
Complete message to the MSC emulator 130 to inform completion of the channel<br>
setup. At the same time, the base station controller 121 adds Bearer ID for voice<br><br>
data transmission. Table 4 illustrates the Assignment Complete message,<br>
particularly, illustrates how a bearer ID is inserted into a general Assignment<br>
Complete message. Other fields except Bearer ID are identical to corresponding<br>
fields in the general Assignment Complete message.<br><br>
In step 309, the MSC emulator 130 sends the media gateway 140 a<br>
MEGACO Modify Request message into which a bearer ID of the base station<br>
controller is inserted so that media gateway bearer setup is completed. In step 310,<br>
the media gateway 140 sends a MEGACO Modify Reply message to inform that<br>
bearer setup of the media gateway is completed. In step 311, the media gateway<br>
140 sends the base station controller 121 an A2p-Frame Forward (Initialization)<br>
message which is an in-of-band signaling message using an A2p interface or an<br>
Amp Initialization message which is an out-of-band signaling message using an<br>
Amp interface in an initialization procedure, for voice data transmission between<br>
the media gateway 140 and the base station controller 121. At the same time, the<br>
media gateway 140 designates information on QoS necessary for a transmission<br>
line and a sequence number of a frame to be newly started in the corresponding<br>
message before transmission.<br>
In step 312, the base station controller 121 performs initialization such as<br>
QoS setup according to the Initialization Procedure received through the A2p-<br>
Frame Forward message, and then sends the media gateway 140 an A2p-Frame<br>
Reverse message or an Amp Initialization Ack message as a response for the<br>
Initialization Ack. In step 313, the media gateway 140 sends a ring back tone to<br>
the mobile station 110. In step 314, the MSC emulator 130 sends a MEGACO<br>
Modify Request message to the media gateway 140 so that bearer setup of the<br><br>
media gateway is performed. In step 315, the media gateway 140 sends a<br>
MEGACO Modify Reply message to the MSC emulator 130 to inform that bearer<br>
setup of the media gateway is completed. Thereafter, in step 316, the base station<br>
controller 121 includes a voice data frame received from the mobile station 110 in<br>
an A2p-Frame Reverse message together with a voice data rate and information<br>
bits, and transmits the A2p-Frame Reverse message to the media gateway 140. In<br>
step 317, the media gateway 140 include the voice data frame received from the<br>
media gateway in an A2p-Frame Forward message together with a voice data rate<br>
and information bits, and transmits the A2p-Frame Forward message to the base<br>
station controller 121. Thereafter, in step 318, the mobile station 110 sets up a<br>
session to the base station controller 121 and then performs voice communication<br>
with the called party.<br>
FIG. 3 has illustrated a vocoder resource assignment procedure applied<br>
when the mobile station 110 originates a call, and it is also applied when a voice<br>
call is received at the mobile station 110. In this case, an operation of inserting<br>
Preferred Frame Offset in a Page Response message, transmitting the Page<br>
Response message from the base station controller 121 to the MSC emulator 130,<br>
and sending the Page Response message from the MSC emulator 130 to the<br>
media gateway 140 through a MEGACO message is identical to the operation<br>
performed when the mobile station 110 originates a call. Because the case where<br>
the voice call is received is different only in application from and identical in<br>
actual operation to the case where the voice call is originated, a description of a<br>
call scenario will not be given. Table 5 illustrates the Page Response message,<br>
particularly, illustrates how a frame offset and a bearer ID is inserted into a<br>
general Page Response message. Other fields except Frame Offset and Bearer ID<br>
are identical to corresponding fields in the general Page Response message.<br><br><br><br>
FIG. 4 is a scenario illustrating a vocoder resource assignment method<br>
during hard handoff in a mobile communication system according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3 illustrates an example of an out-of-<br>
band signaling message using an independent signaling message on Amp which is<br>
a separate signaling interface between the base station controller 121 and the<br>
media gateway 140.<br>
It is assumed herein that if signal power reported by a mobile station 110<br>
exceeds signal power defined in a network, a source base station (S-BS) 120<br>
performs hard handoff to one or more cells under a target base station (T-BS) 170.<br>
In step 401, the source base station 120 sends a Handoff Required message to an<br>
MSC emulator 130 together with a list of corresponding cells. Table 6 illustrates<br>
the Handoff Required message, particularly, illustrates how a frame offset and a<br>
bearer ID is inserted into a general Handoff Required message. Other fields<br><br>
except Frame Offset and Bearer ID are identical to corresponding fields in the<br>
general Handoff Required message.<br><br><br><br>
In step 402, the MSC emulator 130 receiving the Handoff Required<br>
message sends a MEGACO Add Request message to a media gateway 140 in<br>
order to request vocoder resource and setup of a bearer path from the target base<br>
station 170 to the media gateway 140. In step 403, the media gateway 140<br>
receiving the MEGACO Add Request message from the MSC emulator 130<br>
designates MGW Bearer ID to setup a bearer to the target base station 170, and<br>
includes a value for a current frame offset to be used by the mobile station 110 in<br>
a MEGACO Add Reply message before transmission. A vocoder resource<br>
assignment method in the media gateway 140 will be described with reference to<br>
FIG. 5. In step 404, if a hard handoff bit included in the Handoff Required<br>
message received from the source base station 120 is designated to '1' meaning<br>
hard handoff, the MSC emulator 130 sends the target base station 170 a Handoff<br>
Required message including current TIA/EIA-95 Channel Identity element and<br>
media gateway ID, and a frame offset value determined in the media gateway 140.<br>
If the Handoff Required message is received from the MSC emulator 130, the<br>
target base station 170 sends Null Forward Traffic Channel Frames to the<br>
corresponding mobile station 100 in step 405. In step 406, the target base station<br>
170 inserts BSC Bearer ID into a Handoff Request Acknowledge message and<br>
sends the Handoff Request Acknowledge message to the MSC emulator 130.<br>
Table 7 illustrates the Handoff Request Acknowledge message, particularly,<br>
illustrates how a bearer ID is inserted into a general Handoff Request<br>
Acknowledge message. Other fields except Bearer ID are identical to<br>
corresponding fields in the general Handoff Request Acknowledge message.<br><br><br><br>
In step 407, the MSC emulator 130 sends the media gateway 140 a<br>
MEGACO Modify Request message into which BSC Bearer ID is inserted so that<br>
bearer setup of the media gateway 140 is completed. In step 408, the media<br>
gateway 140 sends a MEGACO Modify Reply message to inform completion of<br>
MGW bearer setup. In step 409, the MSC emulator 130 prepares for switching<br>
from the source base station 120 to a target base station controller 121b, and<br>
sends a Handoff Command message to the source base station 120. In step 410,<br>
the source base station 120 sends one of General Handoff Direction/Extended<br>
Handoff Direction/Universal Handoff Direction messages to the mobile station<br>
110. In step 411, the mobile station 110 sends an MS Ack Order message to the<br>
source base station 120 in acknowledgement of the Handoff Direction message.<br>
In step 412, the source base station 120 sends a Handoff Command (or Handoff<br>
Start) message to the MSC emulator 130 in order to inform completed preparation<br>
for moving to a channel for the target base station controller 121b. In step 413,<br>
the media gateway 140 sends the target base station 170 an A2p-Frame Forward<br>
message which is an in-of-band signaling message or an Amp-Initialization<br>
message which is an out-of-band signaling message in an initialization procedure,<br>
for voice data transmission between the media gateways. At the same time, the<br>
media gateway 140 designates information on QoS necessary for a transmission<br>
line and a sequence number of a frame to be newly started before transmission. In<br>
step 414, the target base station 170 performs initialization such as QoS setup<br>
according to the Initialization Procedure received through the A2p-Frame<br>
Forward message, and then sends the media gateway 140 an A2p-Frame Reverse<br>
message or an Amp-Initialization Ack message as an Initialization Ack message.<br><br>
In step 415, the base station 110 sends Reverse Traffic Channel Frames or a<br>
Traffic Channel Preamble to the target base station controller 121b in order to<br>
match reverse synchronization. In step 416, the mobile station sends a Handoff<br>
Complete message to the target base station 170. In step 417, the target base<br>
station 170 wirelessly sends a BS Ack Order message to the mobile station 110.<br>
In step 418, the target base station 170 sends the MSC emulator 130 a Handoff<br>
Complete message to inform successful completion of hard handoff on the mobile<br>
station 110. In step 419, the MSC emulator 130 sends Clear Command to the<br>
source base station 120. In step 420, the source base station 120 sends the MSC<br>
emulator 130 a Clear Complete message indicating successful completion of<br>
Clear. In step 421, the MSC emulator 130 sends the media gateway 140 a<br>
MEGACO Subtract Request message for clearing a bearer connected to the<br>
existing source base station 120. In step 422, the media gateway 140 sends a<br>
MEGACO Subtract Reply message to the MSC emulator 130.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a frame offset assignment method during<br>
vocoder resource assignment in a media gateway.<br>
In step 501, a media gateway 140 is in an idle state. The media gateway<br>
140 determines in step 502 whether a MEGACO message including a frame<br>
offset preferred by a base station controller 121 has been received. Table 8<br>
illustrates the MEGACO message, especially, illustrates how frame offset<br>
information to be added is inserted into a general MEGACO message. Here, the<br>
MEGACO message is generated not by existing binary coding, but by text coding.<br>
Therefore, information on a frame offset proposed in the present invention can be<br>
added when the MSC emulator 130 requests initial bearer setup to the media<br>
gateway 140, and can be inserted into Bearer Setup Information Element in the<br>
MEGACO message.<br><br><br><br>
Here, the base station controller 121 can sort the frame offsets according<br>
to their loads, sort a total of 16 frame offsets according to their priorities, and<br>
transmit a frame offset corresponding to the smallest load to the MSC emulator<br>
130. If it is determined that a MEGACO message including a frame offset<br>
preferred by the base station controller 121 has not been received, the media<br>
gateway 140 returns to step 501 where it maintains the idle state. However, if a<br>
MEGACO message including a frame offset preferred by the base station<br>
controller 121 has been received, the media gateway 140 proceeds to step 503<br>
where it analyzes, for each frame offset, an entire load of a base transceiver<br>
station (BTS) managed by the media gateway 140 through the MEGACO<br>
message including the frame offset preferred by the base station controller 121 in<br>
step 503. As a result of the analysis, the media gateway 140 determines in step<br>
504 whether there is any vocoder resource supporting a frame offset preferred by<br>
the base station controller 121. If there is any available vocoder resource<br>
supporting a frame offset preferred by the base station controller 121, the media<br>
gateway 140 assigns a frame offset provided from the base station controller 121<br>
in step 505, and reserves vocoder resource corresponding thereto in step 506. In<br>
step 507, the media gateway 140 determines whether a voice request has been<br>
^received through a voice transmission bearer path of the mobile station 110. If a<br>
ivoice request has been received through a voice transmission bearer path of the<br>
' mobile station 110, the media gateway 140 prepares for transmission of voice data<br>
' with the reserved vocoder in step 508. Thereafter, in step 509, the media gateway<br>
140 informs the base station controller 121 of the assigned frame offset via the<br>
MSC emulator 130 through a MEGACO Reply message.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 504 that there is no available vocoder<br>
resource supporting a frame offset preferred by the base station controller 121, the<br>
media gateway 140 measures a load assigned to other frame offsets in step 510,<br>
and assigns a frame offset with the smallest load among the frame offsets in step<br>
511. In step 506, the media gateway 140 reserves vocoder resource corresponding<br>
thereto. In step 507, the media gateway 140 determines whether a voice has been<br>
received through a voice transmission bearer path of the mobile station 110. If a<br>
voice has been received through a voice transmission bearer path of the mobile<br>
station 110, the media gateway 140 prepares for transmission of voice data with<br>
the reserved vocoder in step 508. Thereafter, in step 509, the media gateway 140<br><br>
informs the base station controller 121 of the frame offset via the MSC emulator<br>
130 through a MEGACO Reply message.<br>
As described above, a mobile communication system efficiently assigns<br>
vocoder resource in a media gateway by uniformly distributing vocoder voice<br>
data between the media gateway with a transcoder (or vocoder) and a base station<br>
controller to, all vocoder resources instead of concentrating the vocoder voice data<br>
to a certain vocoder resource.<br>
