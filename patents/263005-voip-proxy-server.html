Cross-Reference To Related Applications<br>
[001] This application claims the benefit of prior filed U.S. Provisional<br>
Application no. 60/663,077, filed March 18, 2005, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
[002] The present invention relates to secure communication networks. More<br>
specifically, the invention relates to allowing access to a company's phone<br>
network from an external communications network while maintaining the security<br>
of the secure communications network.<br>
[003] The Internet is an example of an external communications network that<br>
enables remote access to a company's internal communications network without<br>
being directly connected to the company's network. A workstation connected to<br>
the Internet can connect to the company's network and remotely access any of the<br>
allowed network services on the company's network. This is especially convenient<br>
for telecommuters or business travelers that can access the company's network<br>
from their home or away from their office.<br>
[004] Remote access to a company's network, however, increases the risk that an<br>
unauthorized user may gain access to the company's network and steal or damage<br>
information stored on the network. The company's internal network is usually<br>
isolated from the external communications network by a firewall that manages<br>
access to the company's internal network.<br>
[005] Many companies have merged their internal data network with their<br>
telephone system using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). In such a system, the<br><br>
company's phones are connected to the internal network and access the external<br>
phone system through a PBX that manages the interface between the external<br>
telephone network and the company's internal network.<br>
[006] Merging the company's telephone network with their internal<br>
communication network, enables the remote business traveler or telecommuter to<br>
access their business phone when away from their office. Voice applications,<br>
however, usually require a range of IP addresses and port ranges. The company's<br>
firewall must, therefore, open a range of IP addresses and port ranges to the<br>
external network, which are all possible points of entry for an unauthorized user.<br>
[007] In many situations requiring endpoint-to-endpoint access, a remote<br>
computer establishes a virtual private network (VPN) connection that gives the<br>
remote user access to the internal network. A VPN connection, however,<br>
represents a security risk because there is no assurance that the remote computer is<br>
clean and does not contain viruses or other malware that could compromise the<br>
internal network. Therefore, there remains a need for systems and methods for<br>
enabling transparent remote access to a company's internal phone lines from an<br>
external network without establishing a VPN connection.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
[008] One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a Voice over<br>
Internet Protocol (VoIP) proxy server that is placed in a demilitarized zone (DMZ)<br>
of a company's secure internal communication network. The VoIP proxy server<br>
receives VoIP control messages and VoIP media streams and based on the MAC<br>
address and source IP address contained in the control message, pushes a policy<br>
change to the internal network's external firewall to open call control protocol<br>
ports and Real Time Protocol (RTP) ports only for packets from the source IP<br>
address. The VoIP proxy server manages the hiding of the company's internal<br><br>
network address and directs incoming VoIP packets to an Internet Protocol Private<br>
Branch Exchange (IP-PBX) connected to the company's internal network.<br>
[009] One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a system<br>
comprising: an external firewall connected to an external communication network<br>
and a DMZ; an internal firewall connected to an internal communication network<br>
and the DMZ; an IP-PBX connected to the internal communication network; and a<br>
VoIP proxy server connected to the DMZ, the VoIP proxy server configured to<br>
receive VoIP messages from the external firewall and forward the received VoIP<br>
messages through the internal firewall to the IP-PBX.<br>
[0010] Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method<br>
comprising: receiving a request from a remote user's ePhone; identifying a source<br>
IP address in the request; pushing a firewall policy change to an external firewall,<br>
the firewall in response to the policy change opening a port for the source IP<br>
address; forwarding a call control message from the ePhone to an IP-PBX via an<br>
internal firewall; and forwarding a registration request from the IP-PBX to the<br>
ePhone through the external firewall. A further aspect comprises retrieving a<br>
configuration file for the ePhone based on a MAC address of the ePhone; and<br>
authenticating and authorizing the user based on the retrieved configuration file. In<br>
a further aspect, the step of forwarding the call control message further comprises<br>
replacing a destination IP address of an incoming packet with an IP address of the<br>
IP-PBX. In a further aspect, the step of forwarding the registration request further<br>
comprises replacing a source address of the registration request with an address of<br>
a VoIP proxy server. In another aspect, the step of forwarding the call control<br>
message further comprises adding a header containing an internal IP address of the<br>
IP-PBX. In another aspect, the step of forwarding the registration request further<br>
comprises removing a header containing an internal IP source address from the<br>
forwarded registration request.<br><br>
Brie f Description Of The Accompanying Drawings<br>
[0011] The invention will be described by reference to the preferred and<br>
alternative embodiments thereof in conjunction with the drawings in which:<br>
[0012] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the present invention;<br>
and<br>
[0013] Fig. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[0014] The description herein should be understood to describe only one preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize, for example,<br>
that the described embodiment is just one simplified example of the novel system<br>
and method of monitoring trading manager performance. The simplified example<br>
is all that needs to be described in detail in order to enable the more general<br>
system and method that the invention comprises.<br>
[0015] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In Fig. 1, an internal communication network 100 is connected to an external<br>
communication network 190 through an internal firewall 110 and an external<br>
firewall 120. In a preferred embodiment, the external communication network 190<br>
is an internet. In some embodiments, the internal communication network is an<br>
intranet. A local area network, commonly referred to as a DMZ 130 resides<br>
between the internal firewall 100 and the external firewall 120. A Voice over<br>
Internet Protocol (VoIP) proxy server 140 is connected to the DMZ 130. An IP-<br><br>
PBX 150 is connected to the internal network 100.<br>
[0016] The external firewall 120 provides a secure entry point from the internet<br>
into the company's internal network. The external firewall 120 may filter network<br>
packets from the external network and route allowed or authorized packets to the<br>
DMZ for further processing. In a preferred embodiment, the external firewall 120<br>
also hides the company's internal network addresses by acting as a proxy server<br>
for packets coming from or going to the external network 190. The internal<br>
firewall 110 allows only packets having a restricted range of source IP addresses<br>
to pass through the internal firewall 110 to the internal network 100. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the external firewall 120 and the internal firewall 110 are physically<br>
separate servers. In some alternate embodiments, the external firewall and the<br>
internal firewall may be hosted by a single server computer. The DMZ 130 is<br>
preferably a local area network that is connected to the external firewall 120 and<br>
internal firewall 110 and acts as a bridge between the internal and external<br>
firewalls.<br>
[0017] The VoIP proxy server 140 is connected to the DMZ 130 and receives<br>
incoming VoIP control messages and VoIP media streams, collectively referred to<br>
as VoIP messages, from the external firewall 120. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
VoIP proxy server 140 provides network address translation for the VoIP control<br>
and media packets. The VoIP proxy server 140 forwards the control and media<br>
streams through the internal firewall to the internal network 100. An IP-PBX 150<br>
connected to the internal network 100 receives the control and media streams and<br>
transmits return messages and media streams.<br>
[0018] Fig. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In Fig. 2, the VoIP proxy server receives a request from a remote User<br>
for a trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP) service in 210. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the remote user may use a traditional phone connected to an analog-<br><br>
digital converter (ADC), an internet phone or a remote computer executing a<br>
softphone application, referred to collectively as an ePhone. The user may connect<br>
the ePhone to the internet through a local internet service provider (ISP).<br>
[0019] The VoIP proxy server retrieves a configuration file containing<br>
configuration information for user's phone based on the Media Access Control<br>
(MAC) address of the user's internet phone or remote computer in step 220. The<br>
VoIP proxy server identifies a source IP address in the request and pushes a<br>
firewall policy change to the external firewall 120 after the user has been<br>
authenticated and authorized using the internal network's security procedures. The<br>
external firewall 120, in response to the policy change, opens call control protocol<br>
and Real Time Protocol (RTP) ports for that user phone's IP address for a set<br>
period of time.<br>
[0020] In step 230, the VoIP proxy server redirects the incoming VoIP packets to<br>
an internal network address or hides the internal network address for outgoing<br>
packets. For incoming packets, the VoIP proxy server replaces the destination IP<br>
address of the packet with the IP address of the internal IP-PBX. For outgoing<br>
packets, the VoIP proxy server replaces the source address, which is the internal<br>
address of the IP-PBX, with its IP address. Alternatively, instead of replacing the<br>
destination or source B? address, the proxy server may add a header containing an<br>
internal IP destination address to the incoming packet or strip a header containing<br>
an internal IP source address from the outgoing packet.<br>
[0021] In step 240, the VoIP proxy server forwards the received call control<br>
message to the internal D^-PBX. In response to the call control message, the<br>
internal IP-PBX sends a registration request for the user's ePhone back to the VoIP<br>
proxy server. In step 250, the VoIP proxy server receives the registration request<br>
from the internal EP-PBX, replaces the source B° address containing the internal<br>
ff-PBX's IP address with the VoIP proxy server TP address. In step 260, the VoIP<br><br>
proxy server forwards the registration request to the user's ePhone to complete the<br>
registration of the ePhone. Once the user's ePhone is registered, the user may<br>
place a call, which sends call control messages and media streams to the VoIP<br>
proxy server. The external firewall listens for the user's IP address and only<br>
packets with the user's IP address through the exposed User Datagram Protocol<br>
(UDP) ports. Limiting access to the UDP ports to a specified IP source address<br>
minimizes the risk of an unauthorized intruder gaining access through the UPD<br>
ports while providing remote access to the company's internal phone system.<br>
[0022] Embodiments of the present invention comprise computer components and<br>
computer-implemented steps that will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For<br>
example, it should be understood by one of skill in the art that the computer-<br>
implemented steps may be stored as computer-executable instructions on a<br>
computer-readable medium such as, for example, floppy disks, hard disks, optical<br>
disks, Flash ROMS, nonvolatile ROM, and RAM. For ease of exposition, not<br>
every step or element of the present invention is described herein as part of a<br>
computer system, but those skilled in the art will recognize that each step or<br>
element may have a corresponding computer system or software component. Such<br>
computer system and/or software components are therefore enabled by describing<br>
their corresponding steps or elements (mat is, their functionality), and are within<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0023] Having thus described at least illustrative embodiments of the invention,<br>
various modifications and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the<br>
art and are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the<br>
foregoing description is by way of example only and is not intended as limiting.<br>
