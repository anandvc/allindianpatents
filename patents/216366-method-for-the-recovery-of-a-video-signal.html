				<td>Method for the recovery of a video signal<br>
The invention relates to a method for the<br>
recovery of a video signal.<br>
Prior art<br>
Video signals which are transmitted via a channel<br>
are, as a rule, influenced by the channel <br>
characteristics. This applies, in particular, to channels<br>
which are susceptible to interference, such as the<br>
terrestrial transmission of TV signals. Signal<br>
interference may occur due to ambient influences on the<br>
transmission path.<br>
There is thus an interest in compensating for<br>
this interference in the receiver and in obtaining an<br>
optimal reproduction quality.<br>
In the case where the channel characteristics are<br>
known in the receiver, interference can be eliminated by<br>
means of suitable compensation measures, such as e.g. an<br>
equalizer. However, knowledge of the channel<br>
characteristics is not provided e.g. in the case of<br>
terrestrial transmission. In order to ensure<br>
interference-free reception even in the case of such<br>
transmission channels which are subject to interference,<br>
an adaptive equalizer can be used. It is then necessary,<br>
however, to transmit a reference signal with the useful<br>
signal, from which reference signal the corresponding<br>
compensation parameters are then derived by the adaptive<br>
equalizer. For capacity reasons, however, such reference<br>
signals are not prescribed by the transmitter.<br>
Invention<br>
The invention is based on the object of<br>
specifying a method for the recovery of a video signal<br>
which, without an additional reference signal, to the<br>
greatest possible extent eliminates channel interference<br>
which influences the quality of the video signal.<br>
The object is achieved by means of the features<br>
specified .<br>
Advantaggeous developments are reproduced <br>
According to the invention, an adaptive equalizer<br>
is used which is trained by the digital data signals,<br>
such as e.g. teletext data, that are concomitantly<br>
transmitted in a video signal.<br>
An adaptive equalizer adapts itself independently<br>
in order to compensate for unknown or time-variable<br>
channel characteristics. An input signal which is ,<br>
interfered with by the channel is changed by the adaptive<br>
equalizer until a desired output signal is present. Since<br>
adaptive equalizers cannot judge when a desired analogue<br>
output signal is present given an analogue input signal,<br>
the digital data signal that is concomitantly transmitted<br>
with the analogue input signal is advantageously used for<br>
the adjustment of the adaptive equalizer.<br>
It is preferable for the adaptive equalizer to be<br>
adapted to the optimal reception condition during the<br>
transmission duration of the digital data signals and for<br>
this adjustment then to be maintained during the<br>
transmission duration of the analogue signals.<br>
Drawings <br>
Furthermore, an exemplary embodiment for a<br>
circuitry realization for the method according to the<br>
invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br>
A signal is fed to an adaptive equalizer 2 via a<br>
reception device 1. The adaptive equalizer 2 comprises,<br>
in particular, an adj us table filter unit 5, via which the<br>
video signal is fed to an output 6.<br>
In addition, the video signal is fed via a window<br>
stage 3 to an evaluation stage 4 for digital data<br>
signals. A control output of the evaluation stage 4 is<br>
connected to the adjustable filter unit 5 The output of<br>
the evaluation stage likewise leads to the output 6 of<br>
the adaptive equalizer 2. Further processing stages (not<br>
shown) for the video signal are connected to the output<br>
6.<br>
In order to eliminate the influence of channel-<br>
dictated interference on the video signal, the digital<br>
data signals are used to modify the filter<br>
characteristics of the adjustable filter unit 5 in such a<br>
way as to minimize the interference for the output<br>
signal.<br>
By means of a window stage 3 and an evaluation<br>
stage 4, the operation for altering the filter<br>
characteristics of the adjustable filter unit 5 is<br>
limited to the period of time in which digital data<br>
signals are present. As soon as the digital data signals<br>
are no longer present, the filter characteristics of the<br>
adjustable filter unit 5 are frozen for example via a <br>
control line by means of a corresponding signal.<br>
The method according to the invention is suitable?<br>
for any signal transmission methods and for signals which<br>
contain not only analogue information but also digital<br>
data signals which have a sufficiently high staistical<br>
probabilitv.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A method for recovery of video signals with analogue signal<br>
components and digital data components, wherein said digital data<br>
components are transmitted concomitantly to said analogue signal<br>
components for the purpose of providing additional information to<br>
the TV user, said method comprising the steps of :<br>
providing the video signals to an adaptive equalizer (2);<br>
windowing the video signals for the separation of the<br>
digital data components;<br>
generating a control output from the separated digital data<br>
components;<br>
applying the video signals to a filter within the adaptive<br>
equalizer (2); and<br>
adjusting characteristics of the filter based upon the<br>
control output for correcting the analogue signal components.<br>
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein digital teletext<br>
data are used as the digital data components of the video signals.<br>
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the filter<br>
characteristics are altered only when digital data components are<br>
present.<br>
The invention relates to a method for the recovery of a video signal.<br>
According to the invention, an adaptive equalizer 2 is used, the characteristics of which are adjusted to the conditions of a transmission channel by means of the digital data signals that are concomitantly transmitted in addition to the analogue signal components in a video signal. This adjustment is then used for analogue signal components of the video signals. The teletext signal can advantageously be used for the adjustment.</td>
