Aqueous emulsion polymer as dispersant<br>
This invention relates to a water-borne emulsion polymer suitable as pigment dispersing agent.<br>
To introduce solid substances, such as pigments, into liquid media, high mechanical forces are necessary. This depends to a large extent on the solid substance's wet ability by the surrounding medium, as well as on the affinity for this medium. In order to reduce these dispersing forces, it is conventional to use dispersing agents, which facilitate incorporating the substances. This mostly concerns surface-active agents or surfactants, of anionic or cationic or non-ionic structure. In relatively low amounts of addition, these agents are either applied directly to the solid substance or added to the dispersing medium. Through such a surfactant, the energy required for the dispersion is considerably reduced.<br>
Further, it is known that such solid substances, after dispersion, tend to reagglomerate, which nullifies the initially induced dispersing energy and leads to serious problems. This phenomenon can be explained by inter alia London/van der Waals' forces, by which the solid substances are mutually attracted. In order to nullify these attractive forces, adsorption layers should be provided on the solid substances. This occurs through the use of such surfactants or polymers.<br>
During and after the dispersion, however, there arises an interaction of the surrounding medium with the solid particle, so that a desorption of the surfactant can arise in exchange for the surrounding medium present in a higher concentration. However, in most cases this surrounding medium is incapable of building up such stable adsorption layers, so that the entire system flocculates. This is evidenced by inter alia an increase of the viscosity in liquid systems, loss of gloss, color shifts in paints and coatings, insufficient development of coloring power in pigmented plastics and lacquers, as well as a decrease of the mechanical strength in reinforced plastics.<br>
The International publication WO02/057004 (EFKA Additives B.V.) describes a new range of dispersants based on the use of dendrimers as core material for the dispersing agent. This results in a very specific three-dimensional structure with advantageous dispersing properties. The dispersing agent comprises at least one dendrimer, said dendrimer<br><br>
comprising functional groups, that have reacted with a functional moiety, said moiety being defined as -R-X,  X being a pigment affinic group, and R being a linking moiety chain having at least 2 atoms in the chain, with the proviso that the functional group and the pigment affinic group are different<br>
United States Patent Publication 2002/0132890 describes water-based acrylic emulsion dispersants for an inorganic pigment. The acrylic emulsion dispersant is the reaction product of butyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, styrene, methyl ether polyethylene glycol methacrylate, polyethylene glycol methacrylate, and polyphosphoric acid. Thus, an acid anchoring group is present which interacts with metal centers that are inherent in inorganic pigments to stabilize the pigment or the pigments in the pigment dispersion.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a water-borne emulsion polymer in a solvent free environment having improved dispersing properties for organic and inorganic pigments in water based polymer/coatings.<br>
The dispersants of the state of the art are soluble in the medium of the dispersion, e.g. in water. Surprisingly it has been found that a water insoluble system (emulsion) can be used as a dispersant in aqueous systems.<br>
Thus, the invention relates to a water-borne emulsion polymer comprising as co-polymerized units the following monomers:<br>
(A)	an ethylenically unsaturated monomer containing at least one amino group;<br>
(B)	an ethylenically unsaturated monomer containing no amino group;<br>
(C)	optionally a hydroxy- or alkoxyalkyl(meth)acrylate of the formula CH2=CH(R1)COO-C1H20R2<br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl and R2 is hydrogen or C1-C6alkyl and t is an integer of 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6;<br>
(D)	a (poly)alkyleneglycolmono(meth)acrylate of the formula<br>
CH2=CH(R1)-COO-(CmH2mO)n-OR2<br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl and R2 is hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl and m is an integer of 2 or 3 and n is an integer of 2 to 30.<br><br>
Compound (A) is present in an amount of 0,1 - 30 wt % based on the total amount of<br>
monomers used.<br>
Compound (B) is present in an amount of 0.1 -30 wt % based on the total amount of<br>
monomers used.<br>
Compound (C) is present in an amount of 0- 50 wt % based on the total amount of<br>
monomers used.<br>
Compound (D) is present in an amount of 0.1- 50 wt % based on the total amount of<br>
monomers used.<br>
The total numbers of monomer is 100 weigth %.<br>
In a preferred embodiment compound (C) is present<br>
Definitions<br>

Preparation of the emulsion polymer<br>
The water-borne emulsion polymer is prepared using known polymerization methods as described, for example, in the patent publication DE 19 12 483 or US 4 170 582.<br>
A suitable process for preparing a water-borne emulsion polymer as described above<br>
comprises the steps of:<br>
(i) mixing the monomers (A), (B), (C), (D) and an initiator (E); or mixing the monomers (A),<br>
(B), (C), (D), water and an initiator (E) to establish a premix;<br>
(ii) adding the premix into water containing an initiator (E),<br>
(iii) polymerizing the premix to obtain the emulsion polymer.<br><br>
The polymerization time depends on the temperature and the desired final product properties but is preferably within the range of from 0.5 to 10 hours at temperatures at a range from 25°C and 150 °C, more preferably between 70 °C and 90 °C.<br>
As radical polymerization initiators the usual free radical initiators can be used. Examples are oil-soluble and water soluble initiators such as azobisisobutyro nitrile, 2,2,-azobis[2(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride, potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, tert-butyl peroxymaleic acid, succinic acid peroxide, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, benzoylperoxide, di-tert-butylperoxide, tert-butylperoxybenzoate, tert-butylperoxy-2-ethyl-hexanoate and the like.<br>
The initiator is present in step (i) and in step(ii) of the above process. The suitable amount of polymerization initiator in step (i) is from 0.1 to about 5% by weight on the basis of the total amount of the monomers used.<br>
The dispersion preferably contains a surfactant, that may be included in the premix phase or water phase or both phases. Preferably, the surfactant is combined with the monomers in the premix phase. The suitable amount of surfactant is from 0.1% to about 2 % by weight percentage on the basis of the total amount of the monomers used.<br>
Thus, the above process comprises the steps of<br>
(i) mixing the monomers (A), (B), (C), (D), water, an initiator (E) and a surfactant (F) to<br>
establish a premix;<br>
(ii) adding the premix into water containing an initiator (E) and a surfactant (F),<br>
(iii) polymerizing the premix to the emulsion polymer.<br>
It is also possible to adjust the molecular weight of the resulting polymer by adding to the premix such a compound as ally alcohol, a-methyl styrene dimer, n-octylmercaptane, n-dodecylmercaptane, thioglycol acid, iso-octylmercaptopropionate, butylmercaptopropionate and the like. The suitable amount of chain transfer agent is from 0.1% to about 8 % by weight percentage on the basis of the total amount of the monomers used.<br>
Thus, the above process comprises the steps of<br>
(i) mixing the monomers (A), (B), (C), (D), water, an initiator (E), a surfactant (F) and a chain<br>
transfer agent (G) to establish a premix;<br><br>
(ii) adding the premix into water containing an initiator (E) and a surfactant (F) (iii) polymerizing the premix to the emulsion polymer.<br>
Advantages<br>
The new emulsion polymer offers the following advantages:<br>
Law viscosity and good storage stability of Resin Free Pigment Concentrates High pigment loading is possible (40-75% depending on the type of pigment) Uniform color developmanyn various water-borne decorative paints and water-borne   clear coatings High gloss of the cured films<br>
Excellent compatibility with all kinds of water-borne paints and coatings. Typical examples of which are alkyd -emulsions, acrylic copolymer emulsions and polyurethane dispersions, advantageous anti-flooding behaviour outstanding humidity resistance.<br>
The pigment concentrates show no viscosity increase after a storage of several weeks at elevated temperatures, give no settling with inorganic pigments in the aqueous medium and have much higher colour development for organic and inorganic pigments compared to known commercially available dispersing agents for the aqueous medium.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Water (383.1 g) and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (0.012 g, 0.012% of the total formulation) are placed in a three-necked flask under a nitrogen atmosphere and heated to 80 °C. At 80 °C a solution consisting of 2,2'-Azobis[2(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydro-chioride (3.6 g, 0.0111 mol) and water (20.0 g) is added to the reactor. After 5 minutes the continuous stirred premix consisting of styrene (132.2 g, 1.269 mol), hydroxyethylmeth-acrylate (54.1 g, 0.416 mol), dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (56.0 g, 0.356 mol), methoxypolyethyleneglycol methacrylate (50% solution in water)* (315.1 g, 0.1459 mol), sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (0.06 g, 0.06% of the total formulation), iso-octylmercapto-propionate (19.7 g, 0.090 mol), 2,2'-Azobis[2(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride (10.90 g, 0.0337 mol) is added during 120 minutes. After addition of the premix, the contents of the flask are stirred for another 120 minutes at 80 °C. The product is a white-yellowish, semi translucent liquid. The measured molecular weight (Mw, GPC, THF, 10% solution) of the prepared polymer is approximately 7000 g/mol. * = commercial name Bisomer S10W, Laporte Performance Chemicals<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
