				<td>Cationic Guar-Gum Alkyl Amine, Its Derivatives and Process of Preparation Thereof<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to novel cationic Guar gum alkyl amine (GAA) and its amide derivatives.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for preparation of such novel Guar-gum alkyl amine (GAA)<br>
and its derivatives following green chemistry approach.<br>
BackGround of the Invention:<br>
Guar gum is extracted from the guar bean. Chemically, guar gum is a polysaccharide composed<br>
of the sugars galactose and mannose. The backbone is a linear chain of ß 1,4-linked mannose<br>
residues to which galactose residues are 1,6-linked at every second mannose, forming short side-<br>
branches. It has a chemical structure :<br>
<br>
Cationic polysaccharides are known to be having good conditioning properties and used frequently<br>
as industrial additives. Cationic derivatives of guar gum are widely used for the preparation of<br>
shampoos, hair conditioners, personal and household care detergents as well as in pulp and<br>
paper , food processing and pharmaceutical industries.<br>
US Patent 3589978 discloses the use of cationic guar gum derivatives. US Patent 4061602<br>
discloses use of cationic guar gum in preparation of shampoo. Guar 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride and their preparatory methods are also known. However, both the above<br>
compounds are hazardous and may form carcinoma due to the presence of free quarternary<br>
ammonium group present in the reactant 2-3 epoxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. US<br>
patent publication US 2010/0036114 provides a process for preparation of a purified guar 2<br>
hydroxy 3 (trimethylammonium) propyl ether chloride.<br>
However, these compounds , though useful, are difficult to produce and structurally complex .<br>
Therefore there is a need of synthesizing a structurally simpler cationic guar gum and Its<br>
derivatives as well as their simple preparation process, following green chemistry approach, which<br>
does not have the drawbacks of the prior art cationic guar gum derivatives and their preparatory<br>
methods. The novel cationic Guar Gum alkyl amine and its derivatives could not be synthesized<br>
previously because all prior art synthetic methods of guar gum were heavily dependent on use of<br>
high amount of sodium hydroxide (alkali) causing chain breaking of guar polymer affecting<br>
quality of the product and often non specific substitution. Moreover for synthesis of cationic guar<br>
gum, higher temperature was necessary in media. The inventor has synthesized Guar gum alkyl<br>
amine(GAA) compounds in simple preparatory method , which were not known hitherto before<br>
and has also synthesised various amide derivatives of such GAA compounds as well as has<br>
elucited their method of synthesis. The new Guar gum alkyl amine and derivatives may be used<br>
for removal of molecules and ions from aqueous environments, tissue fluids as well as from<br>
terrestrial water resources. The novel Guar gum alkyl amine and derivatives are excellent drug<br>
delivery devices namely as, excipients in solid dosage forms, excipients in liquid dosage forms like<br>
emulsions and suspensions, nanoparticle delivery devices, wound dressings, dentistry and<br>
mucoadhesives. The novel Guar gum alkyl amine and derivative biopolymers of the present<br>
invention can be used in cosmetics as formulation stabilizers, hair conditioners, preservatives and<br>
gelling agents, as well.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
It is a primary object of the invention to provide a novel Guar gum alkyl amine (GAA) compound<br>
with a simpler structure.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide novel amide derivatives of GAA.<br>
It is yet another objective of the invention is to provide a simple reaction scheme to produce GAA<br>
and its derivatives.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide GAA and its amide derivatives which are simpler<br>
in structure but at least as effective as the known Cationic Guar Gum derivatives.<br>
It is yet further objective of the invention is to provide a process for synthesis of novel GAA and<br>
its derivatives following green chemistry approach.<br>
This and other objects of the invention are described in the detailed description of the invention.<br>

hydroxypropyl when n in the formula I is 3 or butyl when n in the general formula I is 4.<br>
It will be well understood by a person skilled in the art that guar gum alkyl amine and its<br>
derivatives of the present invention can have varied molecular weight depending on the guar gum<br>
source, the degree of polymerization and the degree of substitution.<br>

synthesized such as Guar Gum Alkyl Amine Benzamide (GAAB) Of chemical structure<br>
Guar gum alkyl amine propionate of chemical structure<br>
<br>
The inventor has been able to synthesize the Guar Gum alkyl amine (GAA) by replacing aqeuous<br>
alkali induced high pH of the prior art synthesis by using high amount of ammonia to provide mild<br>
alkaline medium , which has facilitated suitable haloalkylating agents to attach to the equatorial<br>
hydroxyl group of Guar Gum without affecting the polymer chain.<br>

and its derivatives according to the present invention.<br>
Preparatory Example 1. Synthesis of Guar-Gum alkyl amine (GAA) :-<br>
Guar-gum 25 grams, was taken in a 500 ml round bottom flask placed on a rotamantle and 100<br>
ml of Isopropanol was then added with mechanical stirring. 50 ml of ammonium hydroxide was<br>
added to this suspension with continuous mechanical stirring. 50 ml 1-chloro- 2 ,3 -epoxypropane<br>
(epichloro hydrine) was then added drop wise to this yellowish slurry. The addition time was 1<br>

reaction temperature at 55 - 60 ° c. The pH of the reaction mixture was maintained throughout<br>
between 8 and 9 by adding ammonium hydroxide time to time. The reaction mixture was then<br>
cooled and the light yellow solid was separated by the filtration in a Buckner funnel. The<br>
precipitate was washed twice with 80% of isopropanol and then finally with ethanol: water (1:1)<br>
and finally dried in a vacuum desicator. The yield recorded wasl9 grams. Solid state 13 C NMR ,<br>

2 Grams of GAA was dissolved in 2(M) cold aqueous HCl in a three necked round bottom flask<br>
placed on a rotamantle fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser and a tube for purging in<br>
nitrogen from a cylinder. Then 20 grams of the hydrated sodium acetate was introduced in the<br>
reaction mixture followed by 20 ml of acetic anhydride with vigorous mechanical stirring over an<br>
ice bath until the smell of acetate disappears. The white solid acetyl derivative separated on<br>
standing was filtered in a Buckner funnel washed in 1:1 ethanol water and dried in vacuum<br>

5g of GAA was suspended in 100 ml of 5% Sodium Hydroxide solution. 10 ml of benzoyl chloride<br>
was then added portion wise with vigorous stirring. Temperature of reaction mixture was<br>
maintained to 30°C. The alkalinity of pH mixture was maintained using NaOH(10%). After<br>
completion of addition stirring was continued for 1hour. Then the solid GAAB was filtered off and<br>
subsequently washed with warm water and then ethanol. The product was dried in vacuum<br>
desicator. Before characterization the product was again purified by dialysis. The Yield recorded<br>
was 4 grams. Benzoylation of Guar Gum alkyl amine resulted in GGBA which ketone responded in<br>
solid state MAS at 191 ppm while the aromatic carbons responded at 165 ppm.<br>
Preparatory Example 4. Synthesis of Guar-gum Alkyl Amine Stearate (GAAS) :<br>
5g of GAA was suspended in 100 ml of 5% Sodium Hydroxide solution. 10 ml of freshly prepared<br>
stearyl chloride was then added portion wise with vigorous stirring. Temperature of reaction<br>
mixture was maintained to 30°C. The alkalinity of pH mixture was maintained by adding 10 % w/v<br>
NaOH time to time. After completion of addition stirring was continued for 1hour more. Then the<br>
solid GAAS was filtered off and subsequently washed with warm water and then with 95 %<br>
ethanol. The product was dried in vacuum desicator. Before characterization the product was<br>
again purified by dialysis. The Yield recorded was 3.2 grams. The stearyl amide of Guar Gum alkyl<br>
amine resulted in GAAS which ketone responded in solid state MAS at 175 ppm while the straeyl<br>
carbons responded strongly at 30.3 ppm with typical observation of the end methyl carbon at 13<br>
ppm.<br>
Preparatory Example 5. Synthesis of Guar-gum Alkyl Amine Oleate (GAAO) :<br>
5g of GAA was suspended in 100 ml of 5% Sodium Hydroxide solution.10 ml of freshly prepared<br>
Oleic acid halide was then added portion wise with vigorous stirring. Temperature of reaction<br>
mixture was maintained to 30oC. The alkalinity of pH mixture was maintained by adding 10 % w/v<br>
NaOH time to time. After completion of addition stirring was continued for Ihour more. Then the<br>
solid GAAO was filtered off and subsequently washed with warm water and then with 95 %<br>
ethanol. The product was dried in vacuum desicator. Before characterization the product was<br>
again purified by dialysis. The Yield recorded was 3 grams. The oleayl amide of Guar Gum alkyl<br>
amine resulted in GAAO which ketone responded in solid state MAS at 174 ppm while the oleayl<br>
carbons responded at 30 ppm.<br>
Preparatory Example 6. Synthesis of Guar-gum Alkyl Amine Propionate (GAAP) :<br>
5g of GAA was suspended in 100 ml of 5% Sodium Hydroxide solution. 10 ml of freshly prepared<br>
propyl chloride was then added portion wise with vigorous stirring. Temperature of reaction<br>
mixture was maintained to 30°C. The alkalinity of pH mixture was maintained by adding 10 % w/v<br>
NaOH time to time. After completion of addition stirring was continued for Ihour more. Then the<br>
solid GAAP was filtered off and subsequently washed with warm water and then with 95 %<br>
ethanol. The product was dried in vacuum desiccators. Before characterization the product was<br>
again purified by dialysis. The Yield recorded was 3.4 grams. The propionate amide of Guar Gum<br>
alkyl amine resulted in GAAP which ketone responded in solid state MAS at 174 ppm while the<br>
propionyl carbons responded at 23 ppm.<br>
DMSO, NaOH may used as a solvent instead of water, NaOH. Alternatively GAA may be reacted<br>
with benzoic acid methylate or ethylate ester and dicyclohexyl carbodimide (DCC) in polar organic<br>
solvents like ethanol/etanol/acetonitile/DMSO/THE DMSO may used as a solvent instead of water<br>
for in the preparation of acetate derivative . The new guar gum alkyl amine benzamides have<br>
significantly altered solubility GAAB, and GAAO are all completely insoluble in water but are<br>
soluble in DMSO. This new property may be useful for development of improved guar based films<br>
and therefore be applicable in paper and textile industry. This has resulted due to<br>
hydrophobization of surface -OH groups of guar gum hindering access of water to it.<br>
Element percentage composition analysis for CHNS<br>
Percentage C,H,N,S analysis was carried out by combustion technique in the CHNS analyzer<br>
model CHNS -932, M/s Leco corporation, U.S.A to understand for presence of C,H,N. and S in<br>
general . Samples weighed in semi micro balance Paul Bunge , model 23, Humburg , Germany<br>
were tal<en in a tin cup and were completely combusted stream of oxygen from cylinder.></en>
Evolving element oxides were monitored in instrument IR device and compared against standard<br>
supplied samples of acetophenon, and cystene supplied by Leco corporation .<br>
Determination of degree of substitution for GAA :<br>
0.3 gm of the GAA sample was accurately weighed and half of the sample was taken in a dry<br>
iodine fiask, 6ml of cold acetic anhydride and pyridine (1 : 3) mixture was then added and the<br>
stopper was inserted. The mixture was cooled (4°C) and allowed to stand for 5 minutes at room<br>
temperature with gentle agitation. Then 10 ml of water was run down the stopper and wall of the<br>
flask. The content of the flask was swirled and the side of the flask was rinsed with 15 ml of n-<br>
butanol. The reaction mixture was immediately titrated against standard 0.5 (N) alcoholic NaOH<br>
solution to the appearance of a definite blue color by adding few drops of mixed indicator(5 parts<br>
of the 0.1%bromocresol green in acetic acid and one part 0.1% methyl red in methanol) A blank<br>
titration without the GAA sample was also performed simultaneously. The remaining half portion<br>
of washed GAA was dried in a oven at 102 °C to constant weight. This weight was taken as equal<br>
to the sample weight in titration.<br>
The Degree of substitution (D.S) was calculated using following formula<br>
<br>
W= Weight of the washed material taken for test, calculated on dry material basis.<br>
V0 = Volume of the NaOH needed for blank titration without GAA sample<br>
V1 = Volume of the NaOH needed for titration of the test sample<br>
T = Titre of the 0.1 (N) NaOH . M1= Molecular weight of the unsubstituted monomer unit = 162 .<br>
M2 = Molecular weight of the substituting unit = 59 .<br>
Determination of degree of substitution for GAAB :<br>
Degree of substituted compound GAAB was carried out similarly. 0.3 gm of the GGBA (IV) sample<br>
was accurately weighed and half of the sample was taken in a round bottomed flask. 100ml of IN<br>
Hydrochloric acid was added into it and the mixture was put to reflux over an water bath for one<br>
hour. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and transferred quantitatively into a<br>
separator washing the contents in 25ml of solvent ether. The entire mixture was extracted in 4<br>
successive quantities of ether 25 ml each and the combined ether layer was washed with 20ml. of<br>
water. The ether layer was evaporated over water bath and the residue was dissolved in 100 ml<br>
of 1 N NaOH. The excess NaOH was back titrated against standard HCl, methyl red as Indicator.<br>
Degree of substitution was then calculated as described earlier. The degree of substitution for all<br>
other compounds were determined similarly and were tabulated in table I.<br>
Solubility studies;<br>
Solubility quality of Guar gum and its derivatives were studied using 10mg weighed quantities<br>
in 2ml different solvents using water, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, N,N, Dimethyl<br>
formamide and phosphoric acid mixture (DMF/H3PO4) , Dichloromethane and Chloroform in order<br>
to have a systematic chemical understanding of the working biopolymer and its surface modified<br>
variants <br>
The detailed results of CHNS analysis, degree of substitution and solubility studies have been<br>
given in Table 1 below.<br>
Spectroscopy and characterization of new guar gum derivatives:<br>
FT- IR Studies<br>
FT-IR study was performed in the instrument FTIR JASCO® 670Plus. Dry powcer of each Guar<br>
gum derivative was palletized in 1: 100 w/w potassium bromide and were scanned over the mid<br>
IR range of 400 - 4000cm-1.Guar gum backbone was mostly constituted of sugar backbone C-C<br>
linkage associating with ether link that was represented at 1058cm'^ stretching vibration when<br>
recorded in potassium bromide pellets (Figure I) . Sugar hydroxyl group is highly hydrogen<br>
bonded that appeared at 3407 cm-1 When substituted in CMG distinct carboxyl group peak<br>
appeared at 1609 cm-1 in addition to hydrogen bonded -OH starching shifting up field at 3429 cm-1<br>
1 possibly due to additional hydrogen bonding interactions due to the attached COOH function in<br>
vicinity. Thus establishing carboxymethyl guar gum (CMG) having additional -COOH functionality<br>
on the guar gum backbone.<br>
In GAA identifiable NH stretching at 2924 cm-land CN stretching at 1261 cm -1 in addition to<br>
sugar OH vibrations shifted at 3433cm-1 and the polymeric ethereal oxygen vibrations at 1022cm-<br>
1 . Thus confirming the structural attachment of - CH2 NH2 functions.<br>
F-T I R Spectra of Guar-Gum (GG) Is shown in Fig 2 .<br>
F-T I R Spectra of Guar-Gum alkyl amine (GAA) is shown in Fig 3.<br>
FT I R Spectra of Carboxy methyl Guar-Gum (CMG) is shown in Fig 4.<br>
FT-IR Spectra of Guar gum alkyl amine benzoate( GAAB) is shown in Fig 5.<br>
FT-IR studies provided for appearance of CH2-NH2 &amp; -CH2C00H on synthesized products .<br>
Therefore compound GAA and compound CMG were confirmed .<br>
C13 NMR studies<br>
Solid state magic angle NMR were recorded for representative compounds at 25 degree C and the<br>
data were presented In Fig 6-8. The Solid state 13 C NMR, for Guar gum provided C2, C3, C4 and<br>
C5 response at 70.9, and the saccharide C1 response at 100.5 ppm. The equatorial C6 carbon<br>
responded at 63.2 ppm. In case of Guar Gum alkyl amine a new peak due to -CH2 NH2 carbon<br>
appeared at 80.63 ppm. In case of Guar Gum alkyl amine acetate, the ketone carbon responded<br>
in solid state MAS at 171 with additional adjoining methyl carbon response at 18 ppm. The<br>
propionate amide of Guar Gum alkyl amine resulted in GGPA which ketone responded in solid<br>
state MAS at 174 ppm while the propionyl carbons responded at 23 ppm. In Guar Gum alkyl<br>
amine stearate, the ketone carbon responded in solid state MAS at 175 ppm while the straeyl<br>
chain carbons responded strongly at 30.3 ppm with typical observation for the end methyl carbon<br>
at 13 ppm. The Guar Gum alkyl amine benzoate, GGBA, ketone responded in solid state MAS at<br>
191 ppm while the aromatic carbons responded at 165 ppm. The Guar Gum alkyl amine oleate,<br>
ketone carbon responded in solid state MAS at 174 ppm while the oleayl carbons responded at 30<br>
ppm. Some of the above results are shown in Fig 5-7.<br>
Absorption of phenolic and polyplienolic compounds from aqueous environment<br>
The cationic guar gum alkyl amine derivatives interact with phenolics and polyphenolics such as<br>
phenol, catechol, cresol, catechol, picric acid, 4-nonylphenol, Propofol, Estradiol, Xynelol's,<br>
Bisphenol's, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline and polyphenols like gallic acid, Resorcinol,<br>
hydroquinone, epicatachin, catachin, quercitin etc. This property can be used for removal of<br>
similar agents from different sources. In one experiment Guar Gum Alkyl amine (GAA) at a<br>
concentration of 1X 10-7 M in water dispersion was added with different concentrations of phenol<br>
in a concentration range of 1x10-5 M Phenol to 9x 10-5M were stirred and the mixture was<br>
compared in UV scan in the range of phenol absorption at 276nm. Adsorption of phenol In GAA<br>
was recorded In all concentration ranges. The absorption equilibrium constant is presented in<br>
table - III and absorption and removal of phenol from aqueous environment by GAA was possible<br>
up to 1 ppb level. The chemical equilibrium for removal of phenolics was attributed due to charge<br>
transfer and hydrogen bonding interaction to GAA. This is attributed for the fact that GAA is a<br>
cationic polymer and phenol is a strong anion in aqueous environment. Absorption spectra of<br>
Guar gum alkyl amine (1x10-7 M) and Phenol complex at different concentrations against<br>
corresponding Phenol absorption scan.[1x10-5 M Phenol{-} to 9x 10-5 M {-}] is shown in Fig 8.<br>
Absorption of protein substances from aqueous environment<br>
Similarly protein materials are also BOD contributors and therefore are potential pollutants in<br>
environment. Proteins like whey protein, soluble proteins from biological and fermentation<br>
sources can be removed up to ppm levels from aqueous environments using different newer guar<br>
gum alkyl amine and derivatives. In one experiment Bovine serum albumin solution in water at<br>
different concentration were mixed with new guar gum alkyl amine derivatives and the BSA<br>
absorption were measured in each case. Compound VI was most active In absorption of BSA from<br>
aqueous environment followed by Guar gum alkyl amine acetate.<br>
Absorption spectra of Guar gum alkyl amine (1x10-7 M) and BSA complex at different<br>
concentrations with corresponding BSA absorption scan. [1x10-6 M BSA {-} to 9x 10-6 M {-}]<br>
and for complex {-}to {-}] is shown in Fig 9. The kinetic equilibrium constant K, is a determinant<br>
of the nature and efficiency of interaction and easily be determined from the formula, K= [DA]/<br>
([D].[A]). Where D, is the active concentration of the donor, protein and A, is the active<br>
concentration of the acceptor guar biopolymer and DA, is the active concentration of donor -<br>
acceptor complex at equilibrium. The same equation can now be derived as K= x/[(C1 -x)(C2 -x)].<br>
Whereby x, represent the equilibrium concentration of complex DA, which can be obtained<br>
graphically from the UV response plot, and C1 represent the initial concentration of the donor,<br>
protein used and C2 represent the initial concentration of the acceptor, guar gum biopolymer used.<br>
Absorption and removal of soluble anionic components from aqueous environment<br>
Anionic components like phosphate, sulfate, cyanide, fluoride, chloride can be removed from soil<br>
and water environment. For example the removal of phosphate was effected at a 0.001 % to 1 %<br>
w/v solution of sodium phosphate in water against 0.5 gm of new guar gum alkyl amine<br>
derivative. The mixture was shaken in rotary shaker for 12 hours at 25 oC. The mixture was<br>
centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 mints and the supernatant was analyzed as follows.: In 1 ml of<br>
aliquot 2ml of reagent A and 17 ml. of water was added and left in dark to develop. Samples of<br>
this solution was then examined in a spectrophotometer at 822nm. The results were compared to<br>
a standard sample of phosphate prepared in water for determination of phosphate content. The<br>
order of efficiency of phosphate removal were rated as II &gt; III &gt; VI &gt; V &gt; IV . Removal of other<br>
anions were carried out similarly.<br>
Reagent A : 1.584 gm of Ascorbic acid is added in 300 ml of Reagent I. Reagent I : 6 gm<br>
ammonium molybdate, 0.146 gm antimony potassium tartrate, 72 ml sulfuric acid and the<br>
volume is made up to 1 Liter with distilled water.<br>
Absorption and removal of soluble anionic components from tissue fluid environment<br>
Similarly, anionic components like phosphate, sulfate, cyanide, fluoride, chloride can be removed<br>
from soil and water environment. For example the removal of phosphate, a 0.001 % to 1 %<br>
solution of sodium phosphate in water is added with 0.5 gm of new guar gum alkyl amine<br>
derivative and the mixture was shaken In rotary shaker for 12 hours at 25 OC. The mixture was<br>
centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 mints and the supernatant was analyzed as follows.: In 1 ml of<br>
aliquot 2ml of reagent A and 17 ml. of water was added and left in dark to develop. Samples of<br>
this solution was then examined in a spectrophotometer at 822nm. The results were compared to<br>
a standard sample of phosphate prepared in water for determination of phosphate content. The<br>
order of efficiency of phosphate removal were rated as II &gt; III &gt; VI &gt; V &gt; IV . Removal of other<br>
anions were carried out similarly.<br>
Reagent A : 1.584 gm of Ascorbic acid is added in 300 ml of Reagent I. Reagent I : 6 gm<br>
ammonium molybdate, 0.146 gm antimony potassium tartrate, 72 ml sulfuric acid and the<br>
volume is made up to 1 Liter with distilled water.<br>
