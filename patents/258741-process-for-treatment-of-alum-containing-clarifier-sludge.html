an Indian Company of D-13, MIDC Industrial Area, R.D. Aga Road, Chinchwad, Pune-411 019, Maharashtra, India.<br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for treatment of alum sludge from clarifier.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Definitions<br>
In the context of this invention the term 'alum' includes mineral acid salts<br>
such as chloride or sulfate salts of metals which include alkali metals (Na, K<br>
alkaline earth metals (Ca, Mg), aluminum and iron.<br>
"Eluent" means an acidic solvent used in the process of eluting adsorbed<br>
metals ions from ion exchange resins;<br>
"Eluate" means an acidic solution containing separated metal ions from the<br>
ion exchange resin obtained after elution.<br>
"Bed volume" [BV] means the volume of eluent or wash water used per unit<br>
volume of the resin in the bed.<br>
"Chamber" in the context of the present invention means a bed, a container, a<br>
vessel or a column wherein the method step of elution is carried out.<br>
Introduction<br>
Water being the cheapest and easily available universal solvent, is used in numerous industries. Raw water is derived from sources such as river, lakes and underground. While, underground water is clear due to natural filtration; the surface water contains suspended impurities such as silt, mud, humic acids etc. The suspended solids in surface water vary from as low as 20 ppm to as high as 10,000 in rivers during rains.<br>
2<br><br>
Before industrialization, water was available as a free abundant source because of less contamination. With the increased use of water by the expanding population and growing industries, waste water discharge and resulting pollution from it has become a cause of concern. In the developing world, wastewater still goes untreated into local rivers and streams. The untreated water disposal not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources. Hence, positive action to reduce and eliminate water contamination is needed. The effluent water after biological or chemical treatment is clarified. Water treatment is a process used to make water more acceptable for a desired end-use and to allow treated water to discharge into the environment without adverse ecological impact. These processes may be physical such as settling, chemical such as disinfection or coagulation or biological such as lagooning, slow sand filtration or activated sludge.<br>
Clarifier is a structure usually in the form of a tank or a basin, for separating sludge from clearer waste water in a typical water treatment plant. Clarifier is designed to coagulate, flocculate and settle the suspended impurities from the raw as well as the secondary effluent. The settled sludge from clarifier is further thickened and disposed.<br>
A continuing demand exists for reduction in the sludge generated from water and waste water clarifiers. The suspended impurities vary from 50 ppm to 1000 ppm or more depending on the treatment given before clarification.<br>
The suspended solids in water have size in submicrons and hence as per stokes law, a long time is taken to settle this matter. Further, few particles known as<br>
3<br><br>
colloids are charged with -ve electric potential and the particles repel each other preventing their precipitation. Hence to ensure their sedimentation in reasonable time; coagulation is done to neutralize the change and bring the colloids to gather followed by flocculation to make a larger size particle for faster settling.<br>
Various flocculating agents are used in domestic and industrial clarification processes. Alum is one of the most widely used and inexpensive flocculating agent. A primary coagulant such as polyDADMAC and flocculants such as Polyacrylamide are also widely known. However, these synthetic polymers are many a times cost prohibitive.<br>
Generally, alums are used in the range of 5 to 1000 ppm as flocculants to remove suspended impurities. Flocculating agents are generally metal salts which undergo reaction when used in water to form poly-hydroxy insoluble complex which have positive charges to neutralize negative charges on colloids and their polymeric nature helps to form large floes. Commonly used flocculating agents are prepared from aluminium and iron as chloride and sulphate salts. A combination with many alkali and alkaline earth metals such as Na, K or Ca, Mg are used to optimize flocculating Action. Alum is used in various forms such as solid, liquid as a solution, partially neutralized form, pre polymerized form like Poly aluminum chloride and various combinations with caustic, lime and other aids.<br>
The coagulated colloids are flocculated further with alum or polyelectrolytes to make larger floes for sedimentation. A clarifier system is designed to coagulate, flocculate and settle suspended impurities from raw as well as<br>
4<br><br>
secondary effluent. Thus alum end up in the sludge along with other suspended matter from water. Depending upon the inlet turbidity and when alum is used as flocculating agent, metals hydroxide, contribute to 30 to 90 % by volume of the total sludge produced from a clarifier.<br>
The sludge from a clarifier is concentrated in thickeners and further dried for disposal as land filling. The disposal of clarifier sludge in a landfill results in the loss of a valuable asset (metal ions) and the metal hydroxides in the sludge causes ground water contamination which is an environmental issue. The dewatering and disposal of Clarifier sludge adds significantly to the cost of treating water because the generated sludge is difficult to dry and dispose due to voluminous and gelatinous nature of metal hydroxides.<br>
Further, the clarifier sludge has unacceptable color, especially when iron based flocculating agents are used. Hence from economic, aesthetic and environment point of view, reduction of metal in the sludge is sought by users.<br>
Ion exchange processes generally involve reversible chemical reactions between solid ion exchangers and an aqueous solution whereby ions are interchanged between the exchanger and the solution. The most widely used exchangers are ion exchange resins which comprise, for the most part, insoluble organic polymer matrices having attached functional groups which provide mobile ions which may be exchanged for ions in the solution bearing the same charge. To impart increased stability to the resins, the matrices are usually prepared by addition copolymerization reactions which provide varying degrees of cross linking. Depending upon the nature of the functional group, ion exchange resins are classified broadly as strong acid, weak acid,<br>
5<br><br>
strong base and weak base. The acid exchange resins are further classified as cation exchangers while the Base Exchange resins are usually referred to as anion exchangers.<br>
Strong acid cation exchange resins typically comprise sulfonated copolymerized styrene-divinylbenzene products crosslinked to varying degrees. Such resins are widely used in water conditioning, demineralization of syrups, chromatographic separations, and metal recovery. Weak acid cation exchange resins are commonly prepared by reacting an unsaturated carboxylic acid, e.g., acrylic or methacrylic acid, with a crosslinking agent such as divinylbenzene or ethylene glycol dimethacrylate. Functional groups may comprise phenolic, phosphorous or carboxylic entities, combinations of these and others. Weak acid resins have found application in water conditioning, chromatographic separation, and metal recovery.<br>
Strong base anion exchange resins generally are prepared by affixing quaternary ammonium groups to a polystyrene divinylbenzene matrix. Resins of this type are used principally in water conditioning. Weak base anion exchange resins contain primary, secondary and tertiary amine groups or mixtures of such groups. Such resins are available in a variety of types including condensation products of amines with formaldehyde, alkyl dihalides, chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene, and the like.<br>
Existing Knowledge<br>
The process of removal of metal from water in dissolved form using Ion exchange resins is widely applied commercially, for example, the removal of<br>
6<br><br>
iron from pickling bath wash is widely done by using Ion exchange resins. The use of ion exchange resins for metal removals is also commercially used in mineral extraction. Gold, uranium extraction is done commercially by use of Ion exchange resins. The demineralization process also removes all metal impurities in water on cation exchange resins.<br>
It is well known that metal ion especially polyvalent metal ions such as Iron and aluminum have higher affinity for resins.<br>
The details regarding the recycling of the metal hydroxide by an extraction process with acids; the problem associated with the disposal of alum sludge, the possible contamination of ground water and alternative uses of sludge in cement, soil stabilization have been provided in "Integrated design and operation of water treatment facilities" by Susumu Kawamura . Furthermore, the problem of disposal of alum sludge, &amp; methods of disposal are also disclosed in an article title "A Study of the Alum Sludge's from Cali City Water Treatment Plants" published in Vol 26, No.2, May , 1999 of AWWA,.<br>
US Patent number 3,959,133 discloses a process of recovering alum from sludge obtained from settling basins which involves lowering the pH of the sludge by addition of Sulfuric acid in proportionate amount to the thickened sludge for stabilizing the metal ion in metal hydroxide precipitate. The dissolved aluminum, in the form of aluminum sulfate (liquid alum), is separated from the residual solids by a gravity separator and returned to storage for reuse while the residual sludge is disposed. The aforesaid acid process as disclosed in US,Patent number 3,959,133 presents a potentially serious problem in that it is vulnerable to the accumulation of certain<br>
7<br><br>
impurities in the recovered alum. If this occurs, and the recovered alum is used for water treatment, it may cause a degradation of the potable water.<br>
US Patent number 5,304,309 discloses continuous cyclic process which employs a weak acid chelating exchanger in the form of a composite membrane for selective coagulant recovery from clarifier sludge in water treatment plants. However, composite ion exchange materials are not available in sizes appropriate for large scale applications and the process is not capable of concentrating alum to high levels.<br>
US Patent number 6,495,047 discloses a process that selectively recovers alum from sludge to reduce the volume of the disposable solids wherein a cation exchange membrane comprising plurality of sheets arranged in stacks is used. Though the process involves recovery of the coagulant compound which is a ferric compound, the process suffers from several drawback generally associated with the use of membranes.<br>

TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENT<br>
The process as described herein above offers several advancements over processes disclosed in the prior art in terms of overall simplicity and the recoverability of almost all the reagents. Furthermore, the process reduces the metal content of the clarifier sludge thereby reducing its volume which in turn helps in easy disposal. In case of iron containing flocculating agents, the process also helps in discoloration of the disposable sludge thereby improving its acceptability for land filling purposes. Regenerability of the ion exchange resin aided with its defouling ensures repeated use of the resin to its fullest extents for significantly longer periods of time. Similarly, recycle of alum constitutes the most significant feature of the process for it renders the process environment friendly and saves the valuable alum.<br>
ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE<br>
Approximate quantity of Alum used in a plant of 1 million liters per day capacity is 50 kgs/day. By using the process in accordance with this invention almost 80 % of the alum can be recovered. Thus in a plant of aforesaid capacity almost 40kg of the alum can be recovered. Apart from the savings in terms requirement of alum per day, another economically significant aspect is that by using the process in accordance with this invention, there will be almost 80% reduction in the quantity of alum that goes with sludge. Furthermore, the process of treatment of alum sludge in accordance with this invention reduces the clarifier sludge volume thereby making its disposal economical.<br>
16<br><br>
The invention will now be described with respect to the following examples which do not limit the invention in any way and only exemplify the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
310 ml of strongly acidic cation Tulsion T 42 in Hydrogen form was mixed with 500 ml of sludge containing 1% aluminium. The mixture was stirred for 3 hrs. The mixture was then taken in a 25 mm chamber and backwashed to remove balance sludge at 4 BV flow rate. The backwash water was collected in a beaker and allowed to settle to measure the sludge volume. The volume of the sludge in the backwash was 50 ml about 1/10th of the original sludge volume.<br>
The sludge was collected and was analyzed by standard methods for aluminium and the percentage of aluminium was found to be less than 0.12% i.e. about 88% reduction.<br>
Example 2<br>
310 ml of strongly acidic cation resin Tulsion T 42 having 8% cross-linking was mixed with 500 ml of sludge containing 1% aluminium. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours in a beaker. The mixture was then taken in a 25 mm column. The resin was then backwashed with demineralized water to remove remaining sludge.<br>
The sludge was collected and was analyzed by standard methods for aluminium absorption over resin. The analysis shows that 82% of the aluminium in the sludge was absorbed on the resin.<br>
17<br><br>
Example 3<br>
370 ml of strongly acidic cation resin Tulsion T 42 having 8% cross-linking was mixed with 500 ml of sludge containing 1% aluminium. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours in a beaker. The mixture was then taken in a 25 mm column. The resin was then backwashed with demineralized water to remove remaining sludge.<br>
The sludge was collected and was analyzed by standard methods for aluminum absorption over resin. The analysis shows that 85% of the aluminium in the sludge was absorbed on the resin.<br>
Example 4<br>
470 ml of strongly acidic cation resin Tulsion T 42 having 8% cross-linking was mixed with 500 ml of sludge containing 1% aluminium. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours in a beaker. The mixture was then taken in a 25 mm chamber. The resin was then backwashed with demineralized water to remove remaining sludge.<br>
The sludge was collected and was analyzed by standard methods for aluminium absorption over resin. The analysis showed that 87% of the aluminium in the sludge was absorbed on the resin.<br>
Example 5<br>
The absorption of the metal ion on the resin was done by mixing ion exchange resin with large quantity of sludge as described in the example 1. Then water<br>
18<br><br>
backwash was given for 15 min. to remove any particulate matter to get the 50% bed expansion. After settling the resin, the excess water was drained. After removal of non-metallic impurities and particulate matter from resin, by washing, the said resin was treated with an acid eluent, 6% Hydrochloric acid (HC1), 8 times the volume of resin at 4BV flow rate in resin column. The resin was analyzed by standard methods for aluminium absorption. The analysis showed that the 90% of the aluminium was desorbed from the resin. The different fractions of eluates were collected in two distinct lots at different BV flow rates. First Eluate containing high metal concentration Fraction with 12.4 % alum was collected first. Cut off point for first eluate was at the B V rate of 4. Subsequently, second eluate containing low metal concentration fraction with balance alum was collected at higher BV flow rates. The collected eluate lots were analyzed for aluminium and results are as shown in the Table 1 below.<br>

Example 6<br>
The resin regenerated as described in example 5 was used after backwash. First three fractions of resin were collected by which 76% of metal salt was recovered. The resultant mixture of three fractions contains 12.4% alum and<br>
19<br><br>
4.4% of acid. The coagulation tests were done by jar test apparatus and results were similar when compared with fresh 12.4% alum solution under similar conditions.<br>
1	Initial turbidity of water: 730 NTU<br>
2	Alum (Al2 (S04)3, 18 H20) dose =150 ppm<br>
3	Turbidity of water after flocculation with fresh alum = 3 NTU<br>
4	Turbidity of water after flocculation with 80% recycle alum = 10 NTU<br>
5	Turbidity of water after flocculation with 80%&gt; recycle alum and adjusting pH with lime to original water pH = 2 NTU<br>
Example 7<br>
The fractions of eluate from 4 to 8 [second lot of eluate with low metal concentration] as given in example 5, were reused as an eluent. The cation exchange resin loaded with metal was treated with the second lot of eluate and backwashed with demineralized water as described in example 2. The analysis of the collected alum fractions are given in the table 2 below:<br>
Table 2:<br><br>
Fraction	0	4	5	6	7	8	1	2 .	3<br>

1, 2 and 3 were the fractions of fresh acids. Based on this analysis, present invention recommends optimization of concentration of acid and recycle of excess acid fractions based on the cost and alkalinity of water.<br>
Foulants present on the resin due to organics or anionic organics were removed by passing 10% sodium chloride with O.4%   caustic at 1 BV flow. In one of the adsorption cycles, the defoulants on the ion exchange resins were removed by soaking the resin in 10% sodium chloride withO.4%   caustic for 2 hrs to remove the organic foulants.<br>
