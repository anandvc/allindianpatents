				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a pocket for garments, particularly to a pocket<br>
preventing small articles from slipping out from inside the pocket even if a person wearing the<br>
garment bends downwardly or moves quickly.<br>
2.	Related Art<br>
[0002] Such an article-dropping proof pocket is disclosed in Japan Patent 2000-136413(A). A<br>
button is fastened to a garment within the pocket by sewing with thread, and a pocket cloth has a<br>
buttonhole therein. A small article with a loop string is put in the pocket, and the button passes<br>
through the loop string and the buttonhole for fastening, thereby preventing the small article<br>
from slipping out from the pocket.<br>
[0003] Articles having no loop strings, such as eyeglasses or purses, however, cannot be<br>
prevented from slipping out from such an article-dropping proof pocket.<br>
[0004] Inconveniently, an article with a loop string cannot be put in an article-dropping<br>
condition without passing the button through the loop string and the buttonhole of the pocket,<br>
and the article cannot be removed from the pocket without removing the button from the<br>
buttonhole and the loop string.<br>
[0005] An article with a loop string can be prevented from falling out of the pocket and from<br>
being lost, but it may happen that the article springs out of the pocket to hang down outside<br>
thereof.<br>
[0006] There is a demand for preventing all small articles having no extra means, such as loop<br>
strings, from slipping out from a pocket, while allowing them to be kept in and removed from<br>
the pocket readily.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] To attain this object a pocket comprising a small flat cloth sewn onto a front side of a<br>
garment cloth with its upper edge open is improved according to the present invention in that the<br>
pocket further comprises a piece of seal cloth fixed to the garment cloth inside of, and in the<br>
vicinity of the upper edge of the small flat cloth, for closing an opening of the upper edge of the<br>
small flat cloth, and fastening structure for detachably fastening the piece of seal cloth to the<br>
small flat cloth.<br>
[0008] A pocket comprising a small flat cloth sewn onto a rear side of a garment cloth with its<br>
upper edge open to a front side of the garment cloth is improved according to the present<br>
invention in that the pocketfurther comprises a piece of seal cloth fixed to the small flat cloth for<br>
closing an opening of the upper edge of the small flat cloth, and fastening structure for<br>
detachably fastening the piece of seal cloth to the garment cloth.<br>
[0009] With these arrangements small articles can be kept in the pocket, which is so sealed that<br>
the articles cannot be allowed to slip out from the pocket even if a person wearing the garment<br>
should bend downwardly or move quickly.<br>
[0010] The fastening structure may comprise a magnet member attached to one of the small flat<br>
cloth (or confronting garment cloth) and the piece of seal cloth, and a piece of metal sheet<br>
attached to the other of these cloths. The fastening structure may comprise a hook and loop<br>
fastener.<br>
[0011] These arrangements facilitate the putting-in and taking-out of small articles from the<br>
pocket. Use of a hook and loop fastener causes a person wearing the garment to feel nothing<br>
strange since material thereof is as soft as cloth of the pocket.<br>
[0012] The piece of seal cloth may have a reinforcement piece attached thereto. The<br>
reinforcement piece effectively prevents twisting of the piece of seal cloth to assure that it<br>
provides a good sealing function. The reinforcement piece may be of a sheet of thin synthetic<br>
resin or metal. The piece of seal cloth may have a bag-like catch extension contiguous thereto.<br>
When a person wearing the garment bends downwardly, the article can be caught by the bag-<br>
like catch extension of the pocket, thus preventing unsealing of the pocket, which otherwise<br>
might be caused if the article should be heavy.<br><br>
[0013] Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be understood from the<br>
following description of pockets according to some preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, which are shown in accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0036] Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, a pocket 11 according to a first embodiment comprises a small<br>
flat cloth 13 sewn onto a front side 12a of a garment cloth 12 with its upper edge open, a piece of<br>
seal cloth 14 fixed to the front side 12a of the garment cloth 12 inside of and in the vicinity of the<br>
upper edge of the small flat cloth 13 for closing an opening 12c at the upper edge of the small<br>
flat cloth, and fastening structure 15 for detachably fastening the piece of seal cloth 14 to the<br>
small flat cloth 13.<br>
[0037] A garment herein used, includes a dress shirt, utility shirt, polo shirt, shirtwaist, gown,<br>
cloak, foundation garment, suit, work dress, jumper, fatigue dress, pants and any other article of<br>
clothing, which can have at least one small flat cloth sewn onto its front and/or rear side as a<br>
pocket.<br>
[0038] Material of the garment cloth 12 is nylon, polyester, vinylon or any other synthetic or<br>
chemical fiber, and cotton, linen, silk or any other natural fiber, and natural or artificial leather.<br>
[0039] The opening 12c at the upper edge of the small flat cloth 13 is somewhat shorter than a<br>
lateral size of the pocket 11.<br><br>
[0040] A predetermined size of flat cloth 13 is sewn along its opposite and lower edges 13b and<br>
13c onto the garment cloth 12, leaving its upper edge 13a open, thus permitting small articles to<br>
be put into and removed from the pocket 11.<br>
[0041] The small flat cloth 13 has a magnet member (fastening structure) 15 fixed thereto,<br>
which magnet member 15 can make a piece of metal 16 (later described) attached to the piece of<br>
seal cloth 14 come toward it, thus detachably fastening the piece of seal cloth 14 to the small flat<br>
cloth 13.<br>
[0042] As seen from Figs. 1 and 2, the piece of seal cloth 14 is somewhat shorter than a lateral<br>
length of the small flat cloth 13, and an upper edge 14a of the seal cloth 14 is close to the<br>
opening of the small flat cloth 13. The upper edge 14a and opposite edges 14b of the piece of<br>
seal cloth 14 are sewn onto the garment cloth, and lower edge 14c is left open.<br>
[0043] As seen from Figs. 1 and 3, the piece of seal cloth 14 is placed below the upper edge of<br>
the small flat cloth 13, so that it cannot be seen from the front side of the garment cloth.<br>
[0044] As seen from Fig. 3, the piece of seal cloth 14 has a bag-like catch extension 22 formed<br>
therein. Catch extension 22 is partly sewn to a rear side 12b of the garment cloth 12 via a<br>
reinforcement piece of cloth 23, and a lower edge 22a of the catch extension 22 is sewn to the<br>
rear side of the garment cloth 12. Thus, the catch section 22 defines a bag-like space 12c<br>
opening at its lower side 14c.<br>
[0045] The reinforcement cloth 23 makes the garment cloth 12 sufficiently hard so as to<br>
prevent any shrinking or bending, thus facilitating insertion and removal of an article 21 into<br>
and from the pocket 11.<br>
[0046] Also, the reinforcement cloth 23 is sewn to the garment cloth 12 at a level lower than<br>
the upper edge 13a of the small flat cloth 13; thereby additionally facilitating insertion and<br>
removal of the article into and from the pocket 11.<br>
[0047] As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the piece of seal cloth 14 has a piece of metal 16 fastened in<br>
confronting relation with the magnet member 15, so that the magnet member 15 may cause the<br>
piece of metal 16 to come towards it. The piece of metal 16 is preferably a sectored disk<br>
comprising three or more divisional sectors, thereby allowing a profile of the sectored disk to<br>
change and fit a convex part of the article 21, which abuts the sectored disk in the pocket 11.<br><br>
[0048] In place of this magnet-and-metal piece, a hook loop fastener may be used as fastening<br>
structure. This material feels as soft as the material of the garment, and therefore, nobody can<br>
feel anything odd in the pocket 11.<br>
[0049] As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the piece of seal cloth 14 is lined with strips of reinforcement<br>
metal or synthetic resin 17 to prevent the seal cloth 14 from bending or twisting, thus assuring<br>
that the seal cloth 14 provides a pocket-sealing effect.<br>
[0050] Referring to Fig. 6, another example of piece of seal cloth 18 has no reinforcement 17,<br>
and the seal cloth 18 is made of a cloth material sufficiently thick to prevent any bending or<br>
twisting.<br>
[0051] Referring to Fig. 7, still another example of piece of seal cloth 19 is relatively wide, and<br>
is lined with thin metal strips of reinforcement 20, which are arranged on both sides of metal<br>
piece 16. Reinforcement pieces 20 can be arranged different from those shown in Figs.2 and 7.<br>
[0052] A manner in which a small article 21 such as a cellular phone or eyeglasses, is put and<br>
kept in the pocket 11 is described below. As seen from Fig. 4, the article 21 is put in the pocket<br>
11 from the upper qpening, and then, a light push is given to the small flat cloth 13 such that the<br>
magnet member 15 attracts the metal piece 16, thereby sealing the opening of the pocket 11 with<br>
the seal cloth 14.<br>
[0053] When a person wearing the garment bends downwardly, the article 21 moves partly<br>
into the bag-like catch extension 22. The attractive force between the magnet member 15 and<br>
the metal piece 16 is strong enough to resist to a weight of the article 21, so that the seal cloth 14<br>
cannot be separated from the flat cloth 13.<br>
[0054] When the person wearing the garment moves quickly, the article 21 cannot spring up<br>
from the pocket 11 thanks to the bag-like catch extension 22.<br>
[0055] The magnet member 15 can easily be separated from the metal piece 16 simply by<br>
inserting fingers from the outer edge 13a of the pocket 11 to remove the article 21 from inside<br>
the pocket.<br>
[0056] Figs. 8 and 9 show a pocket according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Same parts as in the first embodiment are indicated by same reference numbers as used in the<br>
relevant description and drawings, and detailed description thereof are omitted.<br><br>
[0057] A small flat cloth 33 is sewn onto a rear side 32b of garment cloth 32, and a piece of<br>
seal cloth 14 is contiguous with a top edge of the small flat cloth 33 to be arranged between the<br>
small flat cloth 33 and the rear side 32b of the garment cloth 32.<br>
[0058] Apparently, pocket 31 is shown as an inside pocket rather than that applied to a front<br>
side of the garment cloth. The pocket 31 has an upper lateral opening 32c, and a small article 21<br>
can be put in the pocket 31 from the lateral opening 32c.<br>
[0059] The garment cloth 32 has a short-distant patch 32e extending down beyond the lateral<br>
opening 32c. Opposite edges 32f and 32f of the patch 32e are sewn onto the garment cloth 32.<br>
[0060] The garment cloth has a magnetic member 15 fastened to its rear side for attracting a<br>
metal piece 16 for sealing the lateral opening 32c, which metal piece 16 is fastened to seal cloth<br>
14.<br>
[0061] As seen from Fig. 8, the seal cloth 14 is somewhat shorter than a lateral length of the<br>
opening 32c. The seal cloth 14 is contiguous with the upper edge of the small flat cloth 33, and<br>
is sewn onto the patch 32e. Opposite longitudinal sides 14b of the seal cloth 14 are sewn onto<br>
the garment cloth 32. Thus, the seal cloth 14 opens at its bottom 14c.<br>
[0062] As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, the magnet member 15 is fastened to the garment cloth 32 in<br>
confronting relation with the metal piece 16 so that the magnet member 15 may cause the metal<br>
piece 16 to approach it for sealing the pocket 31.<br>
[0063] As shown in these drawings, reinforcement pieces 17 of metal or synthetic resin are<br>
attached to the rear side of the seal cloth 14. The reinforcement pieces 17 have an effect of<br>
preventing the seal cloth 14 from being folded or twisted, thereby assuring that the pocket is<br>
sealed.<br>
[0064] As seen from Fig. 9, the seal cloth 14 has a bag-like space 22 formed on its top side, and<br>
a bag-like section 22 is sewn onto the patch 32e of the garment 32 via a piece of reinforcement<br>
cloth 23.<br>
[0065] The bag-like section 22 is contiguous with the small flat cloth 33. Opposite longitudinal<br>
sides 33b and bottom edge 33c of the small flat cloth 33 are sewn onto the garment cloth 32.<br>
Thus, the bag-like section 22 opens toward an open bottom 14c of the seal cloth 14.<br>
[0066] A manner in which a small article 21 is put and kept in the pocket 31 is described<br>
below. As seen from Fig. 10, the small article 21 is inserted from the opening 32c to be put in the<br><br>
pocket 31, and then, a gentle push is given to the garment cloth 32 to allow the magnet member<br>
15 to attract the metal piece 16. Thus, the opening 32c of the pocket 31 is sealed.<br>
[0067] Even when a person wearing the garment bends down, the article 21 moves into the<br>
bag-like section 22. The sealing cloth 14 cannot be separated from the rear side of the garment<br>
cloth 32 by a weight of the article 21. When the person moves quickly, the article 21 cannot<br>
spring out from the pocket 31, and the article 21 is kept partly in the bag-like section 22.<br>
[0068] Figs. 12 to 16 show a pocket 11 according to a third embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to Figs. 12 to 14, the pocket 11 comprises a small, flat cloth or pouch cloth<br>
13 sewn onto an outer side 12a of a garment cloth or material 12 to define an article-containing<br>
space 24 with top edge 13a open, and a bag-like catch extension 22 which extends from a part of<br>
the garment cloth lying behind the pouch cloth 13. The bag-like catch extension 22 has a piece<br>
of seal cloth 14 integrally connected to an end of the bag-like catch extension 22 so that the seal<br>
cloth 14 may be close to opening 25 of the pocket 11.<br>
[0069] The pocket 11 can be sewn into any kind of garment such as a utility shirt, a polo shirt,<br>
a shirtwaist or blouse, a suit, a jacket, trousers, a skirt, a working dress or a jumper. The jacket<br>
or jumper can have pockets sewn to its outer and inner sides.<br>
[0070] Garment materials include nylon, polyester, vinylon and any other synthetic or chemical<br>
fibers, cotton, linen, silk and any other natural fiber materials, and natural or synthetic leather,<br>
i.e. whatever materials from which the garment may be formed.<br>
[0071] Referring to Fig. 14, a lateral slit 12c is made in the garment cloth 12, and the slit 12c is<br>
somewhat shorter than the opening 25 of the pocket 11.<br>
[0072] The pouch cloth 13 is sewn onto the garment cloth 12 on opposite sides 13b, 13b and a<br>
bottom side 13c, leaving the upper edge 13a open to define the opening 25, via which a small<br>
article or articles can be put into article-containing space 24.<br>
[0073] The pouch cloth 13 has a magnet member 15 attached to its inner side, which magnet<br>
member 15 can apply an attractive force to a magnetic object attached to the seal cloth 14, as<br>
later described (fastening structure). The magnet member 15 preferably comprises a flexible<br>
magnet sheet, which causes a person wearing the garment cloth to feel little or no strange<br>
sensation.<br>
[0074] Referring to Figs. 12 and 13, the seal cloth 14 is somewhat shorter than the pouch cloth<br>
13 in a lateral dimension. The seal cloth 14 is sewn on its upper side 14a onto the garment cloth<br><br>
12 at an upper portion of the lateral slit 12c, while opposite sides 14b, 14b and a bottom side 14c<br>
remain unsewn. The seal cloth 14 is preferably made of a softer material than the garment cloth<br>
and the pouch cloth, so that the person wearing the garment will fe el little or no strange<br>
sensation.<br>
[0075] As seen from Figs. 12 and 14, the upper edge 14a of the seal cloth 14 is at a lower level<br>
than the upper edge 13a of the pouch cloth 13, and therefore, the seal cloth 14 is hidden behind<br>
the pouch cloth, and cannot be seen from outside the pocket.<br>
[0076] As seen from Fig. 14, the upper edge 14a of the seal cloth 14 is connected to a bag-like<br>
catch extension 22, which is sewn via an intervening reinforcement cloth 23 onto an inner side<br>
12b of the upper portion of the lateral slit 12c formed in the garment cloth 12. A lower edge 22a<br>
of the bag-like catch extension 22 is sewn onto a lower edge of the lateral slit 12c.<br>
[0077] Thus, a space in the bag-like extension 22 communicates with article-containing space<br>
24 of the pocket 11 via the lateral slit 12c.<br>
[0078] Dimension L1 of the bag-like catch extension 22 preferably is at least one third<br>
dimension L2 of the pocket 11. Referring to Fig. 16, .when a person wearing the garment cloth<br>
bends his upper body downwardly, article 21 is displaced from the article-containing space 24 to<br>
the space in the bag-like extension 22 via the slit 12c, thereby keeping the article 21 held in the<br>
pocket 11.<br>
[0079] The reinforcement cloth 23 effectively makes entrance on a rear side free of any<br>
wrinkle, keeping it sufficiently stiff to facilitate insertion of the small article 21 into the article-<br>
containing space 24.<br>
[0080] The reinforcement cloth 23 is sewn onto the garment cloth 12 to be below the upper<br>
edge 13a of the pouch cloth 13, thus facilitating insertion of articles 21 into the article-containing<br>
space 24.<br>
[0081] As seen from Figs. 13 and 14, the magnetic object 16 is attached to the inner side of the<br>
seal cloth 14 in confronting relation with the magnet member 15, so that they may be<br>
magnetically attracted and stuck to each other, thereby sealing the pocket 11 with the seal cloth<br>
14. The magnetic object 16 may be of pulverized magnetic material, flexible magnetic wires or<br>
short magnetic plates. The magnetic object 16 may comprise three or more sector divisions<br>
which can be combined into a circle. Advantageously, a circular combination of such sectors<br><br>
can be responsive to a salient article for changing its shape to conform to a salient portion of the<br>
article.<br>
[0082] Fastening structure other than magnetic fastening structure 15, 16 may be used. For<br>
example, two pieces of pressure-sensitive tape, or hooks and loops may alternatively be used.<br>
Advantageously, this sort of tape is as soft as the garment or seal cloth, and therefore, presence<br>
of any foreign substance may not be perceived.<br>
[0083] In use, when an article 21 is put into the pocket 11, the pouch cloth 13 is pushed lightly<br>
to allow the magnet member 15 to attract the magnetic object 16, whereby the pocket 11 is<br>
sealed with the seal cloth 14, as seen from Fig. 15.<br>
[0084] Assuming that a person wearing the garment bends his upper body downwardly, the<br>
article 21 is displaced from the article-containing space 24 to the space in the bag-like catch<br>
extension 22, as seen from Fig. 16. Sealing obtained by magnetic members 15 and 16 cannot be<br>
broken by a weight of the article 21.<br>
[0085] Even vigorous movement does not allow the article 21 to spring up from the pocket, via<br>
the presence of the seal cloth 14 and the bag-like catch extension 22«<br>
[0086] Advantageously, a pair of eyeglasses, a cellular phone or any other fragile article can be<br>
put in such a sealing pocket at ease, because of no fear that these articles will come out of the<br>
pocket and fall on the ground.<br>
[0087] When the article 21 is to be removed, a finger is inserted into the opening 25 to easily<br>
separate the magnet member 15 and the magnetic object 16 from each other, and then the article<br>
21	can be removed as usual.<br>
[0088] Figs. 17 to 20 show a pocket according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In these drawings same portions as the pocket 11 according to the third embodiment are<br>
indicated by same numerals as used in Figs. 12 to 16. Detailed descriptions including these in<br>
respect of from what materials they are made are omitted.<br>
[0089] Pocket 31 comprises a small, flat cloth or pouch cloth 33 sewn onto a rear side 32b of<br>
garment cloth or material 32 to define an article-containing space 24 with top edge 32c open, and<br>
a bag-like catch extension 22 extending from the pouch cloth 33. The bag-like catch extension<br>
22	has a piece of seal cloth 14 integrally connected to an end of the extension 22, lying behind<br>
the garment cloth 32.<br><br>
[0090] The pocket 31 can be sewn into a suit, juniper and trousers and other clothes, not only<br>
on an exterior thereof but also on an interior thereof.<br>
[0091] As seen from Figs. 17 and 18, a lateral opening 32c of predetermined length is made to<br>
allow small articles to be put into the article-containing space 24.<br>
[0092] A lower extension 32e of upper part 32g of garment cloth 32 is behind a lower part of<br>
the garment cloth 32, and the lower extension 32e is sewn on opposite sides 32f,32f onto the<br>
garment cloth 32. Thus, the seal cloth 14 is hidden behind the garment cloth 32 and cannot be<br>
seen from outside the garment cloth.<br>
[0093] A magnet member 15 is attached to an inside of the garment cloth 32. The magnet<br>
member 15 can apply an attractive force to a magnetic object 16 attached to the seal cloth 14, as<br>
later described. The magnet member 15 is preferably of a flexible magnet sheet, which causes a<br>
person wearing the garment to feel little or no strange sensation.<br>
[0094] Referring to Fig. 17, the seal cloth 14 is somewhat shorter laterally than the opening<br>
32c. The seal cloth 14 is sewn on its upper side 14a onto a lower end of the upper part 32g of the<br>
garment cloth 32, while opposite sides 14b, 14b and a bottom side 14c remain unsewn. The seal<br>
cloth 14 preferably is made of a material softer than the garment cloth 32 or pouch cloth 33, so<br>
that the person wearing the garment will feel little or no strange sensation.<br>
[0095] As seen from Figs. 17 and 18, the magnetic object 16 is attached to the inner side of the<br>
seal cloth 14 in confronting relation with the magnet member 15, thus permitting the seal cloth<br>
14 to be releasably stuck to the magnet member 15 (fastening structure). The magnetic object 16<br>
may be of a pulverized magnetic object, flexible magnetic wires or short magnetic plates.<br>
[0096] As shown in Figs. 17 and 18, the seal cloth 14 is lined with reinforcement pieces 17,<br>
which are thin plates of synthetic resin or metal. The reinforcement pieces 17 effectively<br>
prevent the seal cloth 14 from twisting or bending, thereby assuring reliable sealing of the pocket<br>
11.<br>
[0097] As seen from Fig. 18, the upper edge 14a of the seal cloth 14 is connected to an end of<br>
the bag-like catch extension 22, which is sewn onto the lower extension 32e of the garment cloth<br>
via an intervening reinforcement cloth 23.<br>
[0098] As described earlier, the bag-like catch extension 22 extends from the pouch cloth 33,<br>
which is sewn on the opposite sides 33b,33b and the bottom 33c onto the garment cloth 32.<br><br>
Thus, the space in the bag-like catch extension 22 communicates with the article-containing<br>
space 24.<br>
[0099] As seen from Fig. 18, dimension LI of the bag-like catch extension 22 preferably is at<br>
least one third dimension L2 of the article-containing space 24. Referring to Fig. 20, a person<br>
wearing the garment stoops down to allow article 21 to be displaced from the article-containing<br>
space 24 to the space in the bag-like catch extension 22, and then the article 21 is positively held<br>
in the pocket 11.<br>
[00100]	In use, after the article 21 is inserted from the opening 32c into the article-<br>
containing space 24, the pocket 31 is pushed lightly to cause the magnet member 15 to attract the<br>
magnetic object 16, thus sealing the pocket 31 with the seal cloth 14, as seen from Fig. 19.<br>
[00101]	Assuming that the person wearing the garment stoops down, the article 21 is<br>
displaced from the article-containing space 24 to the space in the bag-like catch extension 22, as<br>
shown in Fig. 20. Sealing resulting from attraction of members 15 and 16 cannot be broken by a<br>
weight of the article 21. Even vigorous movement does not allow the article 21 to spring up<br>
from the pocket, via presence, of the seal cloth 14 and the bag-like catch extension 22.<br>
[00102]	Figs. 21 and 22 show a pocket 41 according to a fifth embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In these drawings, same portions as in the pockets 11 and 31 according to the third<br>
and fourth embodiments are indicated by same reference numerals as used in Figs. 12 to 16, and<br>
Figs. 17 to 20, and detailed descriptions including those in respect of from what materials they<br>
are made are omitted.<br>
[00103]	The pocket 41 comprises a small, flat pouch cloth 43 sewn onto a rear side 42b of<br>
a garment cloth or material 42 to define an article-containing space 24 with a top edge 46c open,<br>
and a bag-like catch extension 22 from the pouch cloth 43 sewn onto an inner or rear side of an<br>
upper part 42g of the garment cloth 42. A piece of seal cloth 44 is fastened to a lower end of the<br>
upper part of garment cloth 42, thus lying below opening 45 of the pocket 41 for sealing the<br>
article-containing space 24.<br>
[00104]	Lateral opening 45 has a predetermined width to allow small articles to be put<br>
into the article-containing space 24.<br>
[00105]	The pocket 41 has an extra strip of cloth 46 integrally connected to a top of the<br>
pocket-defining section of the garment cloth 42. The extra strip of cloth 46 is somewhat harder<br><br>
than material of garment cloth 42, and is sewn on opposite sides 46a,46a onto the garment cloth<br>
42.<br>
[00106]	A magnet member 15 is attached to an inner or rear side of the extra strip of cloth<br>
46. The magnet member 15 can apply an attractive force to a magnetic object 16 attached to the<br>
seal cloth 44, as later described (fastening structure). The magnet member 15 is preferably of a<br>
flexible magnet sheet, which causes a person wearing the garment cloth to feel little or no<br>
strange sensation.<br>
[00107]	The seal cloth 44 is integrally connected to the upper part 42g of the garment<br>
cloth, and is as wide as the lateral opening 45. The seal cloth 44 is sewn on opposite sides<br>
44a,44a onto the garment cloth 42, with bottom side 44c remaining unsewn. The seal cloth 44 is<br>
preferably made of a softer material than that of the garment cloth, so that the person wearing<br>
the garment will feel little or no odd sensation.<br>
[00108]	As seen from Fig. 22, an upper edge 44d of the seal cloth 44 is at a lower level<br>
than an upper edge 46c of the extra strip of cloth 46, and therefore, the seal cloth 44 is hidden<br>
behind the extra strip of cloth 46 and cannot be seen from outside the garment cloth.<br>
[00109]	The magnetic object 16 is attached to the seal cloth 14. The magnetic object 16<br>
may be of pulverized magnetic metal, flexible magnetic wires or a short magnetic plate.<br>
[00110]	The pouch cloth 43 is sewn on opposite sides 43b,43b and bottom side 43c onto<br>
the garment cloth 42 so that the article-containing space 24 may communicate with a space in<br>
bag-like catch extension 22.<br>
[00111]	Dimension LI of the bag-like catch extension 22 preferably is at least one third<br>
dimension L2 of the pocket 31. Even when a person wearing the garment stoops down, an<br>
article 21 is displaced from the article-containing space 24 to the space in the bag-like catch<br>
extension 22, thus keeping the article 21 held in the pocket 41.<br><br>
