				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of Fe-based ultrasoft nanocrystallme ferromagnetic alloys.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a process for preparation of Fe-Nb-Cu-Al-Mn-Si-B based ferromagnetic alloys and preparation of ultrasoft nanocrystalline ferromagnetic ribbons by using the same alloys.<br>
The present invention will be useful for the preparation of low cost ferromagnetic alloys used in magnetic cores for sensor applications. It will be used for high frequency transformers, magnetic heads, saturable reactors, choke coils etc.<br>
Conventional materials used in various magnetic parts of power supplies and magnetic head are mainly permalloy, Fe-Al-Si alloy, Silicon steels, ferrite and the like. In view of increasing demand for miniaturization, higher frequency electronic equipment and appliances, the above materials are not suitable.<br>
There are various metallic magnetic alloys which have good soft magnetic properties. These alloys are electrical grade silicon steel, Fe-Si-Al alloys, Ni-based permalloy etc. These materials are prepared by melting, casting and very controlled rolling and heat-treatment to generate texture as descnbed in the book 'Ferromagnetism' by Richard M.Bozorth, Bell Telephone Laboratories, Murray Hill, N.J.,1993. The process of generating texture is expensive. In this process of preparation the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which is detrimental for achieving superior soft magnetic properties, cannot be eliminated. Moreover the brittleness of the alloy like Fe-Si-Al prevents the production of thin sheets for winding as a transformer core or for other applications. Some alloys like Ni-base permalloy are mechanically soft and very sensitive to plastic deformations and special care is needed to handle it.<br>
Reference may be made to European Patent No.: 87114568.6 and 88111364.1 entitled "Fe-based soft magnetic alloy and method of producing same" and "Magnetic core an method of producing the same" respectively, wherein the addition of Cu and at least one element selected from the group consisting of Nb, W, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti and Mo to a Fe-based alloy having an essential composition of Fe-Si-B and a proper heat treatment exhibited excellait soft magnetic properties. The alloy was initially made in the form of amorphous material and then by proper heat treatment gave nanocrystalline particles and thus having good soft magnetic properties. However, it uses the pure metals which are expensive and not cost-effective for industrial scale production Moreover, the properties are still unsatisfactory, as there is scope of further improvement of properties like core loss, coercivity and permeability.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese Patent No.320504 wherein Fe-based soft magnetic alloys having precipitated super fine crystal grains and soft magnetic properties comparable to those of Co-based amorphous alloys have been proposed. The disadvantages of these Fe-based alloys is that their magnetic properties have large dependence on the heat-treatment temperatures during their production process. When the heat treatment temperature exceeds the prescribed range, coarse crystals are liable to be precipitated and the above excellent soft magnetic properties cannot be obtained.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S Patent No.5522948 entitled "Fe-based soft magnetic alloy, method of producing same and magnetic core made of same". Here super fine grains necessary for soft magnetic properties have been generated using a ceramic fusible material like CuO, Cu2O, SnO&gt; etc as nucleation centres in Fe-based alloys This process bear a disadvantage of using powder technique were consolidation into magnetic cores may lead to porosity which deteriorates the magnetic properties.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of Fe based ferromagnetic alloys.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of Fe-Nb-Cu-Al-Mn-Si-B based ultrasoft nanocrystallme ferromagnetic alloys using commercial grade raw matenals and thereby reducing the cost of production.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of Fe-Nb-Cu-Al-Mn-Si-B based ultrasoft nanocrystallme magnetic ribbons.<br>
The matenals which can be magnetised and demagnetised easily are considered to be the soft magnetic alloys. Thus the Fe-based alloys which have been prepared in the form of rod was considered to be the soft magnetic matenals However, their magnetic softness are restricted by the magnetocrystalline and magnetoelastic anisotropies. The melt spinning process where the melt is quenched by the rapidly rotating drum to bye pass the crystallisation process has been adopted in the present work to reduce the effect of magnetocrystalline amsotropy. Hence the process which involved the preparation of amorphous ribbons by rapid quenching technique eliminate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the materials became magnetically softer. However, after this process the matenals were having magneto-elastic anisotropy. So there was scope for further processing of the materials to reduce magnetoelastic anisotropy to get ultrasoft magnetic matenals. This was done by heat-treatment process. After the heat-treatment process nanoparticles, which have negative magnetostriction value, embedded in positive magnetostrictive amorphous matnx. Hence the overall<br><br><br><br>
magnetostriction value was minimum after the heat-treatment process.    Thus after entire process the materials have ultrasoft magnetic properties<br>
In the process of present invention Fe - based soft magnetic alloy matrix is prepared by mixing commercial grade low carbon iron, ferro-niobium, ferro-silicon, ferro-boron and elctrolytic grade copper and have the general formula:<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparation of Fe-based ultrasoft nanocrystallme ferromagnetic alloys which comprises:<br>
i)	melting low carbon iron in the temperature of 1 600K - 1 700K,<br>
ii)         adding ferro-niobium, ferro-boron to the melt and raising the temperature to 1 900K - 2000K,<br>
lii)        adding ferro-silicon &amp; copper to the said melt,<br>
iv)        casting the melt of alloy matrix in the form of cylindrical ingot,<br>
v)         melting the cast of alloy matrix in a crucible in the temperature 1400-1500K and ejecting on a<br>
rapidly rotating quenching wheel to get ribbon, vi)        heating the ribbon for 1 5-20 minutes in inert gas atmosphere in the temperature 600-900K to<br>
get nanocrystallme state.<br>
In the present invention heat treatment in an optimum temperature, a-Fe(Al,Si) nanocrystallme particles are embedded in amorphous matrix and hence ultrasoft magnetic properties are acheived.<br>
