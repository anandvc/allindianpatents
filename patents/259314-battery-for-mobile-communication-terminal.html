				<td>BATTERY FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION TERMINAL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a battery for a mobile communication<br>
terminal, and more particularly, to a battery for a mobile communication terminal<br>
capable of facilitating an assembly of a cell and other components constituting a<br>
battery and capable of firmly maintaining a coupled state therebetween.<br>
2.	Description of the Background Art<br>
A mobile communication terminal is a communication device for<br>
transmitting/receiving voice to/from another party anywhere while being carried by<br>
a user. The mobile communication terminal is detachably provided with a battery<br>
for supplying power. The battery is a second cell, and is re-used after being<br>
charged by a charger when it is discharged.<br>
Generally, a lithium cell is used as the mobile communication terminal.<br>
The lithium cell is operated as follows. First, a lithium ion is generated from an<br>
anode formed of a lithium oxide by an oxidation. Then, the lithium ion is moved by<br>
an electrolyte thus to be deoxidized at a cathode formed of carbon, etc. by a<br>
deoxidization, thereby generating electric energy. The mobile communication<br>
terminal is operated by the generated electric energy.<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing one example of a battery in<br>
accordance with the conventional art, and FIG. 2 is a perspective view showing a<br>
battery having no cover member in accordance with the conventional art.<br>
i<br><br>
As shown, the battery comprises a cell 100 having a hexahedron shape<br>
and containing an electrolyte, etc. therein, a protection circuit assembly 200<br>
connected to one side of the cell 100 for stabilizing a current when a charge and a<br>
discharge are performed in the cell 100, a protection cover 300 for covering the<br>
protection circuit assembly 200.<br>
The cell 100 is formed of an aluminum material, and inside thereof is in a<br>
hermetic state.<br>
Ports 210 constituting the protection circuit assembly 200 are respectively<br>
connected to ports of the cell 100.<br>
The protection cover 300 is formed of a nylon-based resin.<br>
The protection circuit assembly 200 and the protection cover 300 are<br>
coupled to the cell 100 as follows. As shown in FIG 3, the protection circuit<br>
assembly 200 is attached to one side surface of the cell 100 by a spot welding or a<br>
laser welding, and a nylon-based resin is molded with a low temperature and a low<br>
pressure in order to cover the protection circuit assembly 200. The molded resin<br>
serving as the protection cover 300 is attached to the cell 100.<br>
However, in the conventional art, since the protection cover 300 is<br>
attached to the cell 100 formed of aluminum by an insert molding, the cell 10 and<br>
the protection cover 300 are separated from each other when an external impact<br>
is applied thereto. Therefore, a gap between the cell 100 and the protection cover<br>
300 is generated.<br>
Another example of the method for coupling the protection circuit<br>
assembly 200 and the cover 300 to the cell 100 will be explained. As shown in FIG<br>
4, a nylon-based resin is insert-molded to form the protection cover 300 so that the<br>
protection circuit assembly 200 can be positioned therein. The protection cover<br>
2<br><br>
300 is attached to one side surface of the cell 100 by a bonding process.<br>
However, the conventional structure has the following problems. First, it is<br>
difficult to bond the protection cover 300 having the protection circuit assembly<br>
200 therein to the cell 100. Also, since the protection cover 300 formed of a nylon-<br>
based resin is hardened by a bonding material, it is easily damaged when the<br>
battery falls down or an external impact is applied thereto.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a battery for a<br>
mobile communication terminal capable of facilitating an assembly of a cell and<br>
other components constituting a battery and capable of firmly maintaining a<br>
coupled state therebetween.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein,<br>

thus to be respectively coupled to the screw holes of the protection cover<br><br>
A battery for a mobile communication terminal comprises a cell, a protection circuit assembly connected to the cell for stabilizing a current, etc. when 5 3 charge and a discharge are performed in the cell, a protection cover for covering the protection circuit assembly; and a coupling unit for partially coupling the cell to the protection cover. An assembly of the cell and the protection cover constituting the battery is facilitated thus to enhance an assembly productivity. Furthermore, since a coupled state of the battery is firmly maintained, the battery is prevented 10 from being damaged when the battery falls down or an external impact is applied to the battery. Accordingly, a reliability of the battery is enhanced.<br><br></td>
