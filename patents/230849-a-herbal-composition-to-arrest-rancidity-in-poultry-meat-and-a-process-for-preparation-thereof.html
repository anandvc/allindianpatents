				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a herbal composition to arrest rancidity developed on the storage of raw and cooked chicken, and a process for preparation thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Lipids containing unsaturated fatty acids and their esters are readily oxidised by atmospheric oxygen. Chicken containing these fatty acids undergoes deterioration during storage owing to oxidation. The oxidative rancidity is a major cause of quality deterioration in raw and cooked chicken products during refrigerated and frozen storage. It was shown that cooked meat develops rancid flavor more rapidly than uncooked meat during storage. The oxidative deterioration can lead to organoleptic rancidity in the chicken products resulting in vitamin destruction, nutrition losses and discoloration making them unacceptable to consumers.<br>
Malondialdehyde (MDA) which is a decomposition product of peroxidised polyunsaturated fatty acids, has been shown to be a carcinogenic initiator and a mutagen on living systems. It has been proved that the initiating activity of MDA is due to its reactivity with DNA resulting in genetic damage. The oxidative products of lipid oxidation have been implicated in human illnesses, such as atherosclerosis gastrointestinal diseases, aging and cancer.<br>
Application of anti-oxidants is one of the technically simplest way of reducing fat oxidation. Conventionally synthetic products like butylated hydroxy anisole and butylated hydroxy toluene are used as antioxidants.<br>
A disadvantage of using above synthetic anti-oxidants is that it requires extensive testing of food additives to meet safety standards.<br>
Another disadvantage of using above synthetic anti-oxidants is that the testing of these food additives to meet safety standards is very expensive.<br>
The other antioxidants used are spices such as pepper, cinnamon and cloves which prolong the shelf life of certain foods. The antioxidant activity is mainly due to the phenolic compounds present in them.<br>
A limitation of use of spices is the enormous quantity of the spice which has to be used to arrest the rancidity in poultry meat.<br>
Another limitation of use of spices is the change of taste of the poultry meat due to the large amount of spice used.<br>
Yet another limitation of using spices is the unappealing colour imparted by the spice used.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of 'the present invention is to provide a herbal composition to arrest rancidity in poultry meat and a process for preparation thereof<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a herbal composition which increases the shelf life of poultry meat<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a herbal composition which is safer to use than the synthetic anti-oxidants.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF TEE COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a herbal composition to arrest rancidity in poultry meat comprising a mixture of solutions of equal quantities by weight of culinary herbs ajowan, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, basil and ginger.<br>
Each spice is dissolved in 2 ml of absolute ethanol made upto 100 ml by water taking 20% w/v of each spice and stirred with a mechanical stirrer. Each solution is centrifuged preferably at 5000 rpna for about 20 minutes preferably at 4째C temperature.<br>
Equal quantities of each of supernatant extract is collected from each of centrifuged herbal extract and are pooled to prepare stock anti-oxidant extract The composition is stored refrigerated as stock anti-oxidant extract.<br>
It is to be noted that the process of present invention though involving mere mixing of   constitunents does not involve  mere aggregation of properties Each of the constituents by itself has no capability to arrest rancidity of poultry meat However, the mixture of carefully selected spices has the property of arresting  rancidity of poultry meat The mixture shows this property due to synergic effect of different constituents.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with a working example which is intended to illustrate the working of the invention and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
The spices namely ajowan, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, basil and ginger were dried, and then powdered separately with the help of a mortar and pestle. 20 gins each of these dried powder of spice was taken separately in separate 500 ml round bottom flasks. 100 ml of 2% ethanol was added to each flask and then was shaken for 4 hours on a wrist action mechanical shaker. The extracts of each spice were taken in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4째C temperature. Equal proportions of the supernatants were measured with the help of a measuring cylinder and pooled in a screw capped bottle to make the stock antioxidant extract which is stored in a refrigerator.<br>
For use of the herbal anti-oxidant extract to arrest rancidity of poultry meat, about 100 ml of stock antioxidant extract is mixed with 1.0 kg of chicken either raw chicken or cooked chicken. The treated chicken whether raw or cooked is stored at +4째C or -15째C in paper-foil polyethylene pouches.<br>
The stored and herbal treated poultry meat treated and preserved as above was<br>
periodically analysed for processing parameters of rancidity index viz. Peroxide value (PV), free fatty acid (FFA) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TEARS).<br>
The poultry meat treated with the stock antioxidant extract reduced the PV, FFA and TEARS contents significantly as compared to the untreated control chicken meat. The important results are tabulated below:-<br>
Table 1. Peroxide Value of chicken meattreated with NaCl and ethanolic extracts of Spices<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Values are Mean 짹SD of 6 samples<br>
Values bearing different superscripts are significantly different (PO<.05></.05>
Table 2 : Free fatty acid content of chicken meat treated with NaCl and ethanolic extracts of spices<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Values are Mean 짹 SD of 6 samples<br>
Values bearing different superscripts are significantly different (P
Table 3 : Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content of chicken meat treated with NaCl and ethanolic extracts of spices<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Values are Mean 짹 SD of 6 samples<br>
Values bearing different superscripts are significantly different (P
Table 1 describes the peroxide value of chicken meat treated with NaCl and the herbal and spice extracts. On storage with spice extracts the,meat PV was reduced significantly at 4째C. The reduction by storage at -15째C was also significant as compared to control meat sample. The PV was gradually increased on storage, which was found to reduce significantly by the treatment of herbal and spice extracts. NaCl was added to meat only for accelerating the rancidity development. Table 2 shows the free fatty acids content of chicken meat treated with NaCl and ethanolic extracts of spices. It may be noted that the meat on storage at 4째C for 7 days with the spice extract reduced the FFA content significantly. When the meat was stored at -15째C for 6 months the reduction in FFA content was also significant as compared to control. Table 3 gives the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content of chicken meat treated with NaCl and ethanolic extracts of spices. The results indicate.that the meat mixed with the extract of spice and on storage at 4째C for 7 days reduced the auto-oxidation approximately 1/5*. Similarly the chicken meat homogenised with the spice extract on storage at -15째C for 6 months reduced the<br>
rd<br>
formation of TBARS 1/3  . It was also noted that the PV, FFA and<br>
TBARS  content of the chicken sample were less than those of  the<br>
control  during the intermediate storage period ( 3 months) at  ~<br>
15 oC in the herbal and spice extract treated group of samples.<br><br><br><br>
