The invention is directed to a process to prepare a base oil starting from<br>
a slack wax containing feedstock by contacting the feedstock in the presence<br>
of hydrogen with a catalyst comprising a Group VIB metal and a non-noble<br>
Group VIII metal on an amorphous carrier.<br>
GB-A-1493620 describes a hydroisomerisation process to prepare base<br>
oils. The catalysts, which are known to be used in such a reaction generally,<br>
comprise a hydrogenation component and an acid component.<br>
GB-A-1493 620 discloses a catalyst comprising nickel and tungsten as<br>
hydrogenation components, supported on an alumina carrier. The required<br>
acidity for the catalyst is provided by the presence of fluorine.<br>
There have been many efforts to obtain a fluorine free<br>
hydroisomerisation catalyst. For example WO-A-9941337 describes a<br>
hydroisomerisation process wherein a slack-wax containing feed is contacted<br>
with a fluorine free catalyst. The disclosed catalyst consists of a platinum or<br>
palladium metal on a silica-alumina carrier. According to this publication a<br>
hydrotreatment step is preferably performed prior to the hydroisomerisation<br>
step in order to reduce the sulphur and nitrogen content to below 2 ppm, in<br>
order to avoid deactivation of the noble metal containing hydroisomerisation<br>
catalyst.<br>
US-A-5370788 describes a hydroisomerisation catalyst optionally<br>
containing fluorine. US-A-5370788 describes a slack wax<br>
hydroisomerisation process wherein a non-fluorided nickel-molybdenum on<br>
silica-alumina carrier catalyst is used having almost only pores with<br>
diameters between 60-130 A, a total surface area of 249 m^/g an a total pore<br>
volume of 0.5 cc/g, wherein the pore volume of the pores having a pore<br>
diameter of above 500 A is 0.05 cc/g. The catalyst is said to be sulphur<br>
tolerant. The highest base oil yield on slack-wax reported in this publication<br><br>
is about 38 wt% obtained when the hydroisomerisation process was<br>
performed at about 70 bar and 370 째C.<br>
EP-A-537969 describes a hydroisomerisation catalyst optionally<br>
containing fluorine. A slack wax hydroisomerisation process is described<br>
wherein a nickel-molybdenum on silica-alumina carrier catalyst is used<br>
having almost only pores with diameters below 100 A, a total surface area of<br>
between 100 and 250 m^/g. The catalyst is said to be sulphur tolerant. The<br>
high base oil yield on slack-wax are reported in this publication when the<br>
hydroisomerisation process was performed at about 70 bar and at<br>
temperatures about 400 째C. According to this publication the products<br>
require a hydrofinishing step to improve their UV stability.<br>
EP-A-666894 describes a hydroisomerisation catalyst containing no<br>
fluorine. A slack wax hydroisomerisation process is disclosed wherein a<br>
nickel-molybdenum on silica-alumina carrier catalyst is used having a certain<br>
macroporosity. The macroporosity is defined in that a considerable part of<br>
the pores have a diameter greater than 100 nm. The total pore volume is<br>
between 0.6 and 1.2 ml/g. The highest base oil yield on slack-wax reported in<br>
this publication is about 42 wt% obtained when the hydroisomerisation<br>
process was performed at 140 bar and at 391 째C.<br>
US-A-5292989 describes a wax hydroisomerisation process wherein a<br>
catalyst is used comprising cobah, nickel and molybdenum on a silica-<br>
alumina carrier wherein silica was deposited on the surface of the carrier.<br>
Slack wax is, according to the description, a possible feed. The sulphur and<br>
nitrogen content in the slack wax feed are preferably reduced to below 2 ppm<br>
before hydroisomerisation.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a slack wax<br>
hydroisomerisation process, which can be operated at relatively low<br>
pressures, i.e. less than 100 bar. A disadvantage of the above-described<br>
processes, which also operate at such lower pressures, is that they are<br><br>
performed at relatively high temperatures, i.e. higher than 390 째C. A<br>
disadvantage of such higher temperatures is that the level of poly-aromatic<br>
(PCA) compounds in the product becomes too high, i.e. higher than 10<br>
mmol/100 grams of product. Additional hydrofmishing will then be required<br>
to saturate these PCA compounds to a level lower than 10 mmol/100 grams.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a hydroisomerisation<br>
process to prepare base oils from slack-wax which can be performed at lower<br>
pressures and lower temperatures. A further object is that the product<br>
obtained by said process is low in polyaromatic compounds, preferably<br>
having a PCA content of less than 10 mmol/100 grams. A related aim is that<br>
the products as obtained do not require an additional hydrofmishing step in<br>
order to reduce the PCA content. A further aim is to provide a process, which<br>
is tolerant for higher levels of sulphur and nitrogen in the feed, such that a<br>
prior hydrotreating step is not necessary. Additional advantages of the<br>
present invention will become clear from the description.<br>
The above aims are achieved with the following process. Process to<br>
prepare a base oil starting from a slack wax containing feedstock by<br>
(a)	contacting the feedstock in the presence of hydrogen with a sulphided<br>
hydrodesulphurisation catalyst comprising nickel and tungsten on an acid<br>
amorphous silica-alumina carrier and<br>
(b)	performing a pour point reducing step on the effluent of step (a) to<br>
obtain the base oil.<br>
Applicants have found that by using a nickel/tungsten containing<br>
catalyst having a relatively high hydrodesulphurisation (HDS) activity and an<br>
acid amorphous silica-alumina carrier in step (a) a base oil can be prepared in<br>
a high yield at low pressures and temperatures, wherein the base oil product<br>
has an acceptable content of polyaromatic compounds. With relatively high<br>
hydrodesulphurisation   activity   is   here   meant   a   higher   activity   when<br><br>
compared to state of the art nickel/tungsten containing catalysts. Further<br>
advantages will be apparent from the below description.<br>
The slack-wax containing feed may also contain other wax sources, for<br>
example Fischer-Tropsch derived wax. Suitably the content of slack-wax in<br>
the feed will be more than 50 \vt%, preferably more than 80 wt% up to<br>
100 wt%.<br>
The slack-wax is suitably obtained in a solvent dewaxing process,<br>
which can be part of a process to prepare base oils. The slack wax thus<br>
obtained suitably has a mean boiling point between 400 and 600 째C. The oil<br>
content in the wax, as determined by ASTM D721, is suitably between 0 and<br>
50 wt%. The slack-wax feed may contain between 0 and 1 wt% sulphur and<br>
between 0 and 150 ppm nitrogen. It has been found that the catalyst<br>
employed in the The process as claimed in the invention is relatively stable<br>
when sulphur and/or nitrogen are part of the feed. This is advantageous<br>
because a prior desulphurisation step, also referred to as hydrotreating step,<br>
can thus be avoided.<br>
If one base oil grade, having for example a specific kinematic viscosity<br>
at 100 째C, is made at a time the boiling range of the slack wax feed is<br>
preferably rather narrow, more preferably the difference between the<br>
temperature at which 10 wt% is recovered and the temperature at which 90<br>
wt% is recovered is preferably between 80 and 160 째C and preferably below<br>
130 째C. If one intends to prepare two or more base oil grades having<br>
different viscosity properties at a time a more wider boiling slack wax feed is<br>
preferably used. Such a more wider boiling slack wax feed preferably has a<br>
difference between the temperature at which 10 wt% is recovered and the<br>
temperature at which 90 wt% is recovered of between 170 째C and 300 째C<br>
and more preferably between 170 째C and 250 째C. The different base oil<br>
grades having a kinematic viscosity at 100 째C of between 2 and 10 cSt and<br>
having excellent Noack volatility properties of at most 17 wt% for the lower<br><br>
viscosity grades and even lower for the more heavier viscosity grades may be<br>
advantageously be prepared by isolating such grades from preferably the<br>
effluent of step (a) by means of a distillation step.<br>
The catalyst employed in step (a) preferably comprises between 2-10<br>
wt% nickel and between 5-30 wt% tungsten.<br>
The sulphided hydrodesulphurisation catalyst used in step (a) has a<br>
relatively high hydrodesulphurisation activity. With relatively high activity is<br>
here meant a considerably higher activity when compared to state of the art<br>
nickel/tungsten containing catalysts based on a silica-alumina carrier.<br>
Preferably the hydrodesulphurisation activity of the catalyst is higher than<br>
30% and more preferably below 40%, and most preferably below 35%,<br>
wherein the hydrodesulphurisation activity is expressed as the yield in weight<br>
percentage   of  C4-hydrocarbon   cracking   products   when   thiophene   is<br>
contacted with the catalyst under standard hydrodesulphurisation conditions.<br>
The standard conditions consists of contacting a hydrogen/thiophene mixture<br>
with 200 mg of a 30-80 mesh sulphided catalyst at 1 bar and 350 째C, wherein<br>
the hydrogen rate is 54 ml/min and the thiophene concentration is 6 vol% in<br>
the total gas feed.<br>
Catalyst particles are to be used in the test are first crushed and sieved<br>
through a 30-80 mesh sieve. The catalyst is then dried for at least 30 minutes<br>
at 300 째C before loading 200 mg of dried catalyst into a glass reactor. Then<br>
the catalyst is pre-sulphided by contacting the catalyst for about 2 hours with<br>
an H2S/H2 mixture, wherein the H2S rate is 8.6 ml/min and the H2 rate is<br>
54 ml/min. The temperature during the pre-sulphiding procedure is raised<br>
from room temperature, 20 째C, to 270 째C at 10 째C/min and held for 30<br>
minutes at 270 째C before raising it to 350 째C at a rate of 10 째C/min. During<br>
pre-sulphiding nickel and tungsten oxides are converted to the active metal<br>
sulphides. After pre-sulphiding the H2S flow is stopped and H2 is bubbled at<br><br>
a rate of 54 ml/min through two thermostatted glass vessels containing<br>
thiophene. The temperature of the first glass vessel is kept at 25 째C and the<br>
temperature of the second glass vessel is kept at 16 째C. As the vapour<br>
pressure of thiophene at 16 째C is 55 mmHg, the hydrogen gas that enters the<br>
glass reactor is saturated with 6 vol% thiophene. The test is performed at 1<br>
bar and at a temperature of 350 째C. The gaseous products are analysed by an<br>
online gas liquid chromatograph with a flame ionisation detector every 30<br>
minutes for four hours.<br>
In order to obtain a reproducible value for the hydrodesulphurisation<br>
activity the test values as obtained by the above method are corrected such to<br>
correspond to the hydrodesulphurisation activity of a reference catalyst. The<br>
reference catalyst is the commercial C-454 catalyst as obtainable at the date<br>
of filing of Criterion Catalyst Company (Houston) and its reference<br>
hydrodesulphurisation activity is 22 wt% according to the above test. By<br>
testing both the reference catalyst ("test C-454") and the test catalyst<br>
("measured val") one can easily calculate a consistent actual<br>
hydrodesulphurisation activity according to the above test with the below<br>
equation:<br>
Actual activity = "measured val" +((22-"test C-454")/22)*"measured<br>
val"<br>
The hydrodesulphurisation activity of the nickel/tungsten catalyst can<br>
be improved by using chelating agents in the impregnation stage of the<br>
preparation of the catalyst as for example described by Kishan G., Coulier L.,<br>
de Beer V.H.J., van Veen J.A.R., Niemantsverdriet J.W., Journal of Catalysis<br>
196, 180-189 (2000). Examples of chelating agents are nitrilotriacetic acid,<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1,2-cyclohexanediamine-<br>
N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid.<br>
The carrier for the catalyst is amorphous silica-alumina. The term<br>
"amorphous" indicates a lack of crystal structure, as defined by X-ray<br><br>
diffraction, in the carrier material, although some short range ordering may<br>
be present. Amorphous silica-alumina suitable for use in preparing the<br>
catalyst carrier is available commercially. Alternatively, the silica-alumina<br>
may be prepared by precipitating an alumina and a silica hydrogel and<br>
subsequently drying and calcining the resulting material, as is well known in<br>
the art. The carrier is an amorphous silica-alumina carrier. The amorphous<br>
silica-alumina preferably contains alumina in an amount in the range of from<br>
5 to 75% by weight, more preferably from 10 to 60% by weight as calculated<br>
on the carrier alone. A very suitable amorphous silica-alumina product for<br>
use in preparing the catalyst carrier comprises 45% by weight silica and 55%<br>
by weight alumina and is commercially available (ex. Criterion Catalyst<br>
Company, USA).<br>
The total surface area of the catalyst as determined by is preferably<br>
above 100 m^/g and more preferably between 200 and 300 m^/g. The total<br>
pore volume is preferably above 0.4 ml/g. The upper pore volume will be<br>
determined by the minimum surface area required. Preferably between 5 and<br>
40 volume percent of the total pore volume is present as pores having a<br>
diameter of more than 350 A. References to the total pore volume are to the<br>
pore volume determined using the Standard Test Method for Determining<br>
Pore Volume Distribution of Catalysts by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry,<br>
ASTM D 4284-88.<br>
The catalyst is sulphided. Sulphidation of the catalyst may be effected<br>
by any of the techniques known in the art, such a ex-situ or in-situ<br>
sulphidation. For example, Sulphidation may be effected by contacting the<br>
catalyst with a sulphur-containing gas, such as a mixture of hydrogen and<br>
hydrogen sulphide, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon disulphide or a mixture<br>
of hydrogen and a mercaptan, such as butylmercaptan. Alternatively,<br>
sulphidation may be carried out by contacting the catalyst with hydrogen and<br>
sulphur-containing hydrocarbon oil, such as sulphur-containing kerosene or<br><br>
gas oil. The sulphur may also be introduced into the hydrocarbon oil by the<br>
addition of a suitable sulphur-containing compound, for example dimethyl-<br>
disulphide or tertiononylpolysulphide.<br>
The feedstock will preferably comprise a minimum amount of sulphur<br>
in order to keep the catalyst in a sulphided state. Preferably at least 200 ppm<br>
sulphur and more preferably at least 700 ppm sulphur is present in the feed.<br>
It may be therefore be necessary to add additional sulphur, for example as<br>
dimethylsulphide, or a sulphur containing co-feed to the feed of step (a) if the<br>
slack wax contains a lower level of sulphur. Examples of slack wax feed,<br>
which contain lower levels of sulphur, are slack waxes obtained from oil,<br>
which has been obtained in a hydrocracking process. Such slack waxes may<br>
contain between 10-200 ppm sulphur.<br>
The amorphous silica-alumina carrier of the catalyst preferably has a<br>
certain minimum acidity or, said in other words, a minimum cracking<br>
activity. Examples of suitable carriers having the required activity are<br>
described in WO-A-9941337. More preferably the catalyst carrier, after<br>
having been calcined, at a temperature of suitably between 400 and 1000 째C,<br>
has a certain minimum n-heptane cracking activity as will be described in<br>
more detail below.<br>
The n-heptane cracking is measured by first preparing a standard<br>
catalyst consisting of the calcined carrier and 0.4 wt% platinum. Standard<br>
catalysts are tested as 40-80 mesh particles, which are dried at 200 째C before<br>
loading in the test reactor. The reaction is carried out in a conventional fixed-<br>
bed reactor having a length to diameter ratio of 10 to 0.2. The standard<br>
catalysts are reduced prior to testing at 400 째C for 2 hrs at a hydrogen flow<br>
rate of 2.24 Nml/min and a pressure of 30 bar. The actual test reaction<br>
conditions are: n-heptane/H2 molar ratio of 0.25, total pressure 30 bar, and a<br>
gas hourly space velocity of 1020 Nml/(g.h). The temperature is varied by<br>
decreasing the temperature  from 400 째C  to 200 째C  at 0.22 째C/minute.<br><br>
Effluents are analysed by on-line gas chromatography. The temperature at<br>
which 40 wt% conversion is achieved is the n-heptane test value. Lower n-<br>
heptane test values correlate with more active catalyst.<br>
Preferred carriers have an n-heptane cracking temperature of less than<br>
360 째C, more preferably less than 350 째C and most preferably less than<br>
345 째C as measured using the above-described test. The minimum n-heptane<br>
cracking temperature is preferably more than 310 째C and more preferably<br>
greater than 320 째C.<br>
The cracking activity of the silica-alumina carrier can be influenced by,<br>
for example, variation of the alumina distribution in the carrier, variation of<br>
the percentage of alumina in the carrier, and the type of alumina, as is<br>
generally known to one skilled in the art. Reference in this respect is made to<br>
the following articles which illustrate the above: Von Bremer H., Jank M.,<br>
Weber M., Wendlandt K.P., Z. anorg. allg. Chem. 505, 79-88 (1983);<br>
Leonard A.J., Ratnasamy P., Declerck F.D., Fripiat J.J., Disc, of the Faraday<br>
Soc. 1971, 98-108; and Toba M. et al, J. Mater. Chem., 1994, 4(7), 1131-<br>
1135.<br>
The catalyst may also comprise up to 8 wt% of a large pore molecular<br>
sieve, preferably an aluminosilicate zeolite. Such zeolites are well known in<br>
the art, and include, for example, zeolites such as X, Y, ultrastable Y,<br>
dealuminated Y, faujasite, ZSM-12, ZSM-18, L, mordenite, beta, offretite,<br>
SSZ-24, SSZ-25, SSZ-26, SSZ-31, SSZ-33, SSZ-35 and SSZ-37, SAPO-5,<br>
SAPO-31, SAPO-36, SAPO-40, SAPO-41 and VPI-5. Large pore zeolites<br>
are generally identified as those zeolites having 12-ring pore openings. W.<br>
M. Meier and D. H. Olson, "ATLAS OF ZEOLITE STRUCTURE TYPES"<br>
3rd Edition, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1992, identify and list examples of<br>
suitable zeolites. If a large pore molecular sieve is used then the well-known<br>
synthetic zeolite Y as for example described in US-A-3130007 and<br>
ultrastable Y zeolite as for example described in US-A-3536605 are suitable<br>
10<br><br>
molecular sieves. Other suitable molecular sieves are ZSM-12, zeolite beta<br>
and mordenite. Such molecular sieve containing catalysts, containing<br>
between 0.1 and 8 wt% of the sieve, are especially used when the reactor<br>
containing the catalyst is altematingly used as a hydrocracker reactor to<br>
prepare middle distillate fuels and as a reactor to prepare base oils.<br>
The catalyst for use in step (a) may be prepared by any of the suitable<br>
catalyst preparation techniques known in the art. A preferred method for the<br>
preparation of the carrier comprises mulling a mixture of the amorphous<br>
silica-alumina and a suitable liquid, extruding the mixture and drying and<br>
calcining the resulting extrudates as for example described in EP-A-666894.<br>
The extrudates may have any suitable form known in the art, for example<br>
cylindrical, hollow cylindrical, multilobed or twisted multilobed. A most<br>
suitable shape for the catalyst particles is cylindrical. Typically, the<br>
extrudates have a nominal diameter of from 0.5 to 5 mm, preferably from 1<br>
to 3 mm. After extrusion, the extrudates are dried. Drying may be effected at<br>
an elevated temperature, preferably up to 800 째C, more preferably up to<br>
300 째C. The period for drying is typically up to 5 hours, preferably from 30<br>
minutes to 3 hours. Preferably, the extrudates are calcined after drying.<br>
Calcination is effected at an elevated temperature, preferably between 400<br>
and 1000 째C. Calcination of the extrudates is typically effected for a period<br>
of up to 5 hours, preferably from 30 minutes to 4 hours. Once the carrier has<br>
been prepared, nickel and tungsten may be deposited onto the carrier<br>
material. Any of the suitable methods known in the art may be employed,<br>
for example ion exchange, competitive ion exchange and impregnation.<br>
Preferably nickel and tungsten are added by means of impregnation using a<br>
chelating agent as described above. After impregnation, the resulting catalyst<br>
is preferably dried and calcined at a temperature of between 200 and 500 째C.<br>
The hydroisomerisation process is conducted at elevated temperature<br>
and pressure.    Suitable operating temperatures for the process are in the<br>
11<br><br>
range of from 290 째C to 370 째C, preferably in the range of from 320 째C to<br>
360 째C. Preferred total pressures are in the range of from 20 to 100 bar and<br>
more preferred from 40-90 bar. Base oil having a viscosity index of between<br>
120-150 can be obtained under these conditions in high yields. The<br>
hydrocarbon feed is typically treated at a weight hourly space velocity in the<br>
range of from 0.5 to 1.5 kg/l/h, more preferably in the range of from 0.5 to<br>
1.2kg/l/h.<br>
The feed may be contacted with the catalyst in the presence of pure<br>
hydrogen. Alternatively, it may be more convenient to use a hydrogen-<br>
containing gas, typically containing greater than 50% vol. hydrogen, more<br>
preferably greater than 60% vol hydrogen. A suitable hydrogen-containing<br>
gas is gas originating from a catalytic reforming plant. Hydrogen-rich gases<br>
from other hydrotreating operations may also be used. The hydrogen-to-oil<br>
ratio is typically in the range of from 300 to 5000 1/kg, preferably from 500<br>
to 2500 1/kg, more preferably 500 to 2000 1/kg, the volume of hydrogen<br>
being expressed as standard litres at 1 bar and 0 째C.<br>
In step (b) the effluent of step (a) is subjected to a pour point reducing<br>
treatment. With a pour point reducing treatment is understood every process<br>
wherein the pour point of the base oil is reduced by more than 10 째C,<br>
preferably more than 20 째C, more preferably more than 25 째C.<br>
The pour point reducing treatment can be performed by means of a so-<br>
called solvent dewaxing process or by means of a catalytic dewaxing<br>
process. Solvent dewaxing is well known to those skilled in the art and<br>
involves admixture of one or more solvents and/or wax precipitating agents<br>
with the base oil precursor fraction and cooling the mixture to a temperature<br>
in the range of from -10 째C to -40 째C, preferably in the range of from -20 째C<br>
to -35 째C, to separate the wax from the oil. The oil containing the wax is<br>
usually filtered through a filter cloth which can be made of textile fibres,<br>
such as cotton; porous metal cloth; or cloth made of synthetic materials.<br>
12<br><br>
Examples of solvents which may be employed in the solvent dewaxing<br>
process are C3-C6 ketones (e.g. methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone<br>
and mixtures thereof), Cg-Cjo aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene),<br>
mixtures of ketones and aromatics (e.g. methyl ethyl ketone and toluene),<br>
autorefrigerative solvents such as liquefied, normally gaseous C2-C4<br>
hydrocarbons such as propane, propylene, butane, butylene and mixtures<br>
thereof. Mixtures of methyl ethyl ketone and toluene or methyl ethyl ketone<br>
and methyl isobutyl ketone are generally preferred. Examples of these and<br>
other suitable solvent dewaxing processes are described in Lubricant Base<br>
Oil and Wax Processing, Avilino Sequeira, Jr, Marcel Dekker Inc., New<br>
York, 1994, Chapter?.<br>
The wax obtained in the solvent dewaxing step (b) is preferably<br>
recycled to step (a).<br>
Alternatively step (b) is performed by means of a catalytic dewaxing<br>
process. Such a process is preferred when for example lower pour points are<br>
desired than which can be achieved with solvent dewaxing. Pour points of<br>
well below -30 째C can be easily achieved. The catalytic dewaxing process<br>
can be performed by any process wherein in the presence of a catalyst and<br>
hydrogen the pour point of the base oil precursor fraction is reduced as<br>
specified above. Suitable dewaxing catalysts are heterogeneous catalysts<br>
comprising a molecular sieve and optionally in combination with a metal<br>
having a hydrogenation function, such as the Group VIII metals. Molecular<br>
sieves, and more suitably intermediate pore size zeolites, have shown a good<br>
catalytic ability to reduce the pour point of the base oil precursor fraction<br>
under catalytic dewaxing conditions. Preferably the intermediate pore size<br>
zeolites have a pore diameter of between 0.35 and 0.8 nm. Suitable<br>
intermediate pore size zeolites are ZSM-5, ZSM-12, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, SSZ-<br>
32, ZSM-35 and ZSM-48. Another preferred group of molecular sieves are<br>
13<br><br>
the silica-aluminaphosphate (SAPO) materials of which SAPO-11 is most<br>
preferred as for example described in US-A-4859311. ZSM-5 may optionally<br>
be used in its HZSM-5 form in the absence of any Group VIII metal. The<br>
other molecular sieves are preferably used in combination with an added<br>
Group VIII metal. Suitable Group VIII metals are nickel, cobalt, platinum<br>
and palladium. Examples of possible combinations are Ni/ZSM-5, Pt/ZSM-<br>
23, Pd/ZSM-23, Pt/ZSM-48 and Pt/SAPO-11. Further details and examples<br>
of suitable molecular sieves and dewaxing conditions are for example<br>
described in WO-A-9718278, US-A-5053373, US-A-5252527 and<br>
US-A-4574043.<br>
The dewaxing catalyst suitably also comprises a binder. The binder can<br>
be a synthetic or naturally occurring (inorganic) substance, for example clay,<br>
silica and/or metal oxides. Natural occurring clays are for example ofcthe<br>
montmorillonite and kaolin families. The binder is preferably a porous binder<br>
material, for example a refractory oxide of which examples are: alumina,<br>
silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia,<br>
silica-titania as well as ternary compositions for example silica-alumina-<br>
thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia, silica-alumina-magnesia and silica-magnesia-<br>
zirconia. More preferably a low acidity refractory oxide binder material<br>
which is essentially free of alumina is used. Examples of these binder<br>
materials are silica, zirconia, thanium dioxide, germanium dioxide, boria and<br>
mixtures of two or more of these of which examples are listed above. The<br>
most preferred binder is silica.<br>
A preferred class of dewaxing catalysts comprise intermediate zeolite<br>
crystallites as described above and a low acidity refractory oxide binder<br>
material which is essentially free of alumina as described above, wherein the<br>
surface of the aluminosilicate zeolite cr&gt;'stallites has been modified by<br>
subjecting the aluminosilicate zeolite crystallites to a surface dealumination<br>
treatment. These catalysts may be advantageously used because they allow<br>
14<br><br>
small amounts of sulphur and nitrogen in the feed. A preferred dealumination<br>
treatment is by contacting an extrudate of the binder and the zeolite with an<br>
aqueous solution of a fluorosilicate salt as described in for example US-A-<br>
5157191 or WO-A-0029511. Examples of suitable dewaxing catalysts as<br>
described above are silica bound and dealuminated Pt/ZSM-5, silica bound<br>
and dealuminated Pt/ZSM-23, silica bound and dealuminated Pt/ZSM-12,<br>
silica bound and dealuminated Pt/ZSM-22, as for example described in WO-<br>
A-0029511 andEP-B-832171.<br>
Catalytic dewaxing conditions are known in the art and typically<br>
involve operating temperatures in the range of from 200 to 500 째C, suitably<br>
from 250 to 400 째C, hydrogen pressures in the range of from 10 to 200 bar.<br>
Although lower pressures between 40 to 70 bar are generally preferred for<br>
the dewaxing step, the pressure will suitably be in the same range as step (a).<br>
Thus when step (a) is performed at a pressure above 70 bar, the dewaxing<br>
step will suitably also be performed at a pressure above 70 bar. The weight<br>
hourly space velocities (WHSV) is suitably in the range of from 0.1 to 10 kg<br>
of oil per litre of catalyst per hour (kg/l/hr), and preferably from 0.2 to<br>
5 kg/l/hr, more preferably from 0.5 to 3 kg/l/hr and hydrogen to oil ratios in<br>
the range of from 100 to 2,000 litres of hydrogen per litre of oil.<br>
Before performing a catalytic dewaxing step hydrogen sulphide and<br>
ammonia formed in step (a) are preferably removed from the effluent of step<br>
(a). This can be performed by for example stripping, preferably using<br>
hydrogen as stripping gas.<br>
The effluent of a catalytic dewaxing step (b) is optionally subjected to<br>
an additional hydrogenation step (c), also referred to as a hydrofinishing step<br>
to saturate any olefins formed in the catalytic dewaxing step. In this<br>
hydrogenation step any (poly)aromatic compounds still present in the<br>
dewaxed oil can be saturated and/or the oxidative stability of base oil may be<br>
improved. This step is suitably carried out at a temperature between 230 and<br>
15<br><br>
380 째C, a total pressure of between 10 to 250 bar and preferably above 100<br>
bar and more preferably between 120 and 250 bar. The WHSV (Weight<br>
Hourly Space Velocity) ranges from 0.3 to 2 kg of oil per litre of catalyst per<br>
hour (kg/l.h).<br>
The hydrogenation catalyst is suitably a supported catalyst comprising a<br>
dispersed Group VIII metal. Possible Group VIII metals are cobalt, nickel,<br>
palladium and platinum. Cobalt and nickel containing catalysts may also<br>
comprise a Group VIB metal, suitably molybdenum and tungsten. Suitable<br>
carrier or support materials are low acidity amorphous refractory oxides.<br>
Examples of suitable amorphous refractory oxides include inorganic oxides,<br>
such as alumina, silica, titania, zirconia, boria, silica-alumina, fluorided<br>
alumina, fluorided silica-alumina and mixtures of two or more of these.<br>
Examples of suitable hydrogenation catalysts are nickel-molybdenum<br>
containing catalyst such as KF-847 and KF-8010 (AKZO Nobel) M-8-24 and<br>
M-8-25 (BASF), and C-424, DN-190, HDS-3 and HDS-4 (Criterion); nickel-<br>
tungsten containing catalysts such as NI-4342 and NI-4352 (Engelhard) and<br>
C-454 (Criterion); cobalt-molybdenum containing catalysts such as KF-330<br>
(AKZO-Nobel), HDS-22 (Criterion) and HPC-601 (Engelhard). Preferably<br>
platinum containing and more preferably platinum and palladium containing<br>
catalysts are used. Preferred supports for these palladium and/or platinum<br>
containing catalysts are amorphous silica-alumina. Examples of suitable<br>
silica-alumina carriers are disclosed in WO-A-9410263. A preferred catalyst<br>
comprises an alloy of palladium and platinum preferably supported on an<br>
amorphous silica-alumina carrier of which the commercially available<br>
catalyst C-624 of Criterion Catalyst Company (Houston, TX) is an example.<br>
The invention will be illustrated with the following non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>

(Houston) was loaded into a reactor and retained as a fixed bed. The LH-21<br>
catalyst had a hydrodesulphurisation activity of 32%. The carrier of this<br>
catalyst had a heptane cracking test value of between 320 and 345 째C.<br>

50 wt%	491 째C	<br>
95 wt%	591 째C	<br>
Final boiling point	596 째C	<br>
vas fed to the reactor at a weight hourly	space velocit'	/ of 1 kg/l/h. The feec<br>
was spiked with dimethyldisulphide such that the total content of sulphur in<br>
the feed was 0.1 wt%. Hydrogen was fed to the reactor at an inlet pressure of<br>
50 bar and at a flowrate of 1500 Nl/h. The reaction temperature was 350 "C.<br>
The hydrocarbon product was distilled to remove that fraction of the<br>
product having a boiling point below 370 째C and further refined by solvent<br>
dewaxing at a temperature of -27 째C. The remaining oil was collected. The<br>
yield of oil, expressed as wt% of the feed, was 45 wt%. The viscosity index<br>
was 138. The kinematic viscosity at 100 째C was 5.1 cSt and at 40 째C was 25<br>
cSt. The content of aromatics, including polyaromatics, was below 6<br>
mmol/100 grams of product.<br>
17<br><br>

the content of aromatics, including polyaromatics, was below 2 mmol/100<br>
grams.<br>
Comparative Experiment A<br>
Example 1 was repeated with a commercial fluorided C-454 catalyst as<br>
obtained from the Criterion Catalyst Company at 390 째C. The yield of oil,<br>
expressed as wt% of the feed, was 47 wt%. A darker base oil product was<br>
obtained, wherein the content of mono aromatics was 17.1 mmol/100 g and<br>
the amount of diaromatics and polyaromatics was 11.4 mmol/100 g.<br>
