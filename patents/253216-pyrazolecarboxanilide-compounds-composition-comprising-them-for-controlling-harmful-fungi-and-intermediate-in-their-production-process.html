				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to pyrazolecarboxanilides of the formula I<br><br>
in which the variables are as defined below:<br>
n	is zero or 2;<br>
m	is 2 or 3;<br>
X1	is fluorine or chlorine;<br>
X2	is halogen;<br>
Y	is CN, NO2, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-haloalkyl, methoxy or methylthio;<br>
p	is zero or 1;<br>
R1	is fluorine, chlorine, bromine, C1-C4-alkyl or C1-C4-haloalkyl;<br>
R2	is hydrogen or halogen;<br>
R3	is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl;<br>
W	is O or S;<br>
with the proviso that, if<br>
a)	W = O, R1 = methyl and R3 is hydrogen, R2 is not F, or<br>
b)	W = O, n = 0, m = 2, p = 0, R2 and R3 are hydrogen, R1 is not trifluoromethyl or<br>
difluoromethyl.<br>
Here, in the case of multiple substitution, the substituents X1 and X2 may independently<br>
of one another have different meanings.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to processes for preparing these compounds, to com-<br>
positions comprising them and to methods for their use for controlling harmful fungi, in<br>
particular Botrytis.<br>
Pyrazolecarboxanilides having fungicidal action are known from the literature. Thus, for<br>
example, EP-A 545 099 and EP-A 589 301 describe biphenylanilides of this type which<br><br>
are monosubstituted at the biphenyi group.<br>
WO 00/14071 describes specific 1,3-dimethyl-5-fluoropyrazolecarboxanilides and their<br>
fungicidal action.<br>
Pyrazolecarboxanilides having a specific triple substitution at the biphenyi group are<br>
known from WO 03/070705 and JP-A 2001/302605.<br>
WO 2004/103975 provides inter alia iodopyrazolecarboxanilides which differ from the<br>
present compounds I in particular in that they have an iodine substituent instead of R1.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide pyrazolecarboxanilides whose fun-<br>
gicidal action is better than that of the compounds of the prior art.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the compounds I defined at the outset.<br>
Moreover, we have found processes for preparing these compounds, compositions<br>
comprising them and methods for their use for controlling harmful fungi.<br>
Compared to the known compounds, the compounds of the formula I are more effec-<br>
tive against harmful fungi.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be present in different crystal modifications whose<br>
biological activity may differ. They also form part of the subject matter of the present<br>
invention.<br>

2-propyl, 2,2,3,3,4,4,4-heptafluoro-1-butyl or nonafluoro-1-butyl, in particular ha-<br>
lomethyl, with particular preference CH2-CI, CH(CI)2, CH2-F, CH(F)2, CF3, CHFCI,<br>
CF2CI or CF(CI)2.<br><br>
The compounds I are generally obtained by reacting a carbonyl halide of the formula II<br>
in a manner known per se (for example J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 2nd<br>
Ed., 382 f, McGraw-Hill, 1977) in the presence of a base with an aniline of the for-<br>
mula III:<br><br>
In the formula II, the radical Hal denotes a halogen atom, such as fluorine, chlorine,<br>
bromine and iodine, in particular fluorine, chlorine or bromine. This reaction is usually<br>
carried out at temperatures of from -20째C to 100째C, preferably from 0째C to 50째C.<br>
Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane<br>

dine, substituted pyridines, such as collidine, lutidine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and<br>

Particular preference is given to using triethylamine and pyridine.<br>
The bases are generally employed in equimolar amounts, based on the compound II.<br>
However, they can also be used in an excess of from 5 mol% to 30 mol%, preferably<br>
from 5 mol% to 10 mol%, or - if tertiary amines are used - if appropriate, as solvents.<br>
The starting materials are generally reacted with one another in equimolar amounts. In<br>

The compounds I are furthermore suitable for controlling harmful fungi in the protection<br>
of materials (for example wood, paper, paint dispersions, fibers or fabrics) and in the<br>
protection of stored products. In the protection of wood, particular attention is paid to<br>
the following harmful fungi: Ascomycetes, such as Ophiostoma spp., Ceratocystis spp.,<br>
Aureobasidium pullulans, Sclerophoma spp., Chaetomium spp., Humicola spp.,<br>
Petriella spp., Trichurus spp.; Basidiomycetes, such as Coniophora spp., Coriolus spp.,<br>

Mucor spp., additionally in the protection of materials the following yeasts: Candida<br>
spp. and Saccharomyces cerevisae.<br>
The compounds I are employed by treating the fungi or the plants, seeds, materials or<br>
soil to be protected from fungal attack with a fungicidally effective amount of the active<br>
compounds. The application can be carried out both before and after the infection of<br>
the materials, plants or seeds by the fungi.<br>
The fungicidal compositions generally comprise between 0.1 and 95%, preferably be-<br>
tween 0.5 and 90%, by weight of active compound.<br>
When employed in plant protection, the amounts applied are, depending on the kind of<br>
effect desired, between 0.01 and 2.0 kg of active compound per ha.<br>
In seed treatment, for example by dusting, coating or drenching seed, amounts of ac-<br>
tive compound of from 1 to 1000 g/100 kg, preferably from 5 to 100 g/100 kg, of seed<br>
are generally necessary.<br>
When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active com-<br>
pound applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect.<br>
Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are, for example, 0.001 g to<br>
2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active compound per cubic meter of treated mate-<br>
rial.<br>
The compounds I can be converted into the customary formulations, for example solu-<br>
tions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The use form<br>
depends on the particular intended purpose; in each case, it should ensure a fine and<br>
even distribution of the compound according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by extending the active<br>
compound with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Solvents/auxiliaries suitable for this purpose are essentially:<br>
-	water, aromatic solvents (for example Solvesso products, xylene), paraffins (for ex-<br>
ample mineral oil fractions), alcohols (for example methanol, butanol, pentanol, ben-<br>
zyl alcohol), ketones (for example cyclohexanone, gamma-butyrolactone), pyrrolido-<br>

-	carriers such as ground natural minerals (for example kaolins, clays, talc, chalk) and<br>
ground synthetic minerals (for example highly disperse silica, silicates); emulsifiers<br>
such as nonionogenic and anionic emulsifiers (for example polyoxyethylene fatty al-<br>
cohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and dispersants such as lignosul-<br>

Substances which are suitable for the preparation of directly sprayable solutions,<br>
emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions are mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling<br>
point, such as kerosene or diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or<br>
animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene, xylene,<br>

solvents, for example dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and water.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dustable products can be prepared by mixing or<br>
concomitantly grinding the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, for example coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous<br>
granules, can be prepared by binding the active compounds to solid carriers. Examples<br>
of solid carriers are mineral earths such as silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, attaclay,<br>
limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate,<br>
magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers, such as,<br>
for example, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and<br>

nutshell meal, cellulose powders and other solid carriers.<br>
Formulations for the treatment of seed may additionally comprise binders and/or gelling<br>
agents and, if appropriate, colorants.<br>
Binders may be added to increase the adhesion of the active compounds on the seed<br>
after the treatment. Suitable binders are, for example, EO/PO block copolymer surfac-<br>
tants, but also polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyacrylates, polymethacry-<br>
lates, polybutenes, polyisobutylenes, polystyrenes, polyethylenamines, poly-<br>
ethylenamides, polyethylenimines (Lupasol짰, Polymin짰), polyethers, polyurethanes,<br><br>

is, for example, carrageen (Satiagel짰).<br>
In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1<br>
to 90% by weight, of the active compound. The active compounds are employed in a<br>
purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
The concentrations of active compound in the ready-for-use preparations can be varied<br>
within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are between 0.0001 and 10%, preferably<br>
between 0.01 and 1%.<br>
The active compounds can also be used with great success in the ultra-low volume<br>
(ULV) process, it being possible to apply formulations with more than 95% by weight of<br>
active compound or even to apply the active compound without additives.<br>
For the treatment of seed, the formulations in question give, after two- to ten-fold<br>
dilution, active compound concentrations of from 0.01 to 60% by weight, preferably<br>
from 0.1 to 40% by weight, in the ready-to-use preparations.<br>
The following are examples of formulations: 1. Products for dilution with water<br>

by weight of water or in a water-soluble solvent. As an alternative, wetting agents or<br>
other auxiliaries are added. The active compound dissolves upon dilution with water. In<br>
this way, a formulation having a content of 10% by weight of active compound is<br>
obtained.<br>
B)	Dispersible concentrates (DC)<br>

ethoxylate (in each case 5 parts by weight). This mixture is introduced into 30 parts by<br>
weight of water by means of an emulsifying machine (for example Ultraturrax) and<br>
made into a homogeneous emulsion. Dilution with water gives an emulsion. The<br>
formulation has an active compound content of 25% by weight.<br>
E)	Suspensions (SC, OD)<br>
In an agitated ball mill, 20 parts by weight of a compound I according to the invention<br>
are comminuted with addition of 10 parts by weight of dispersants and wetting agents<br>
and 70 parts by weight of water or an organic solvent to give a fine active compound<br>
suspension. Dilution with water gives a stable suspension of the active compound. The<br>
active compound content in the formulation is 20% by weight.<br>
F)	Water-dispersible granules and water-soluble granules (WG, SG)<br>

addition of 50 parts by weight of dispersants and wetting agents and prepared as<br>
water-dispersible or water-soluble granules by means of technical appliances (for<br>
example extrusion, spray tower, fluidized bed). Dilution with water gives a stable<br>
dispersion or solution of the active compound. The formulation has an active<br>
compound content of 50% by weight.<br>
G)	Water-dispersible powders and water-soluble powders (WP, SP)<br>

mixed intimately with 95 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dustable<br>
product having an active compound content of 5% by weight.<br>
J) Granules (GR, FG, GG, MG)<br>
0.5 part by weight of a compound I according to the invention is ground finely and<br>
associated with 99.5 parts by weight of carriers. Current methods are extrusion, spray-<br>
drying or the fluidized bed. This gives granules to be applied undiluted having an active<br>
compound content of 0.5% by weight.<br>
K) ULV solutions (UL)<br><br>
10 parts by weight of a compound I according to the invention are dissolved in 90 parts<br>
by weight of an organic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product to be applied<br>
undiluted having an active compound content of 10% by weight.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use<br>
forms prepared therefrom, for example in the form of directly sprayable solutions,<br>
powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dustable<br>
products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing,<br>
dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the intended<br>
purposes; they are intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of<br>
the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable<br>
powders (wettable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions,<br>
pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can<br>
be homogenized in water by means of a wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or<br>
emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active<br>
substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent<br>
or oil, and such concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active compound concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied<br>
within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from<br>
0.01 to1%.<br>
The active compounds may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process<br>
(ULV), by which it is possible to apply formulations comprising over 95% by weight of<br>
active compound, or even to apply the active compound without additives.<br>
Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, fungicides, other pesticides, or<br>
bactericides may be added to the active compounds, if appropriate not until<br>
immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the agents<br>
according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:100 to 100:1, preferably 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
Suitable adjuvants in this sense are in particular: organically modified polysiloxanes, for<br>
example Break Thru S 240짰; alcohol alkoxylates, for example Atplus 245짰, Atplus MBA<br>
1303짰, Plurafac LF 300짰 and Lutensol ON 30짰; EO/PO block polymers, for example<br>
Pluronic RPE 2035짰 and Genapol B짰; alcohol ethoxylates, for example Lutensol<br>
XP 80짰; and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate, for example Leophen RA짰.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can, in the use form as fungicides, also be<br>
present together with other active compounds, for example with herbicides, insecti-<br>
cides, growth regulators, such as prohexadione-Ca, fungicides or else with fertilizers.<br>
By mixing the compounds I or the compositions comprising them with one or more fur-<br><br>
ther active compounds, in particular fungicides, it is in many cases possible to broaden<br>
the activity spectrum or to prevent the development of resistance. In many cases, syn-<br>
ergistic effects are obtained.<br>

5.50 g of the above acid were isolated as a white powder of m.p. 167-169째C.<br>
The compounds of the general formula I where W = O listed in Table 9 below were<br>
prepared using the procedures given here.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Use examples<br>
The fungicidal action of the compounds I according to the invention was demonstrated<br>
by the following tests:<br>
The active compounds were prepared as a stock solution comprising 25 mg of active<br>
compound which was made up to 10 ml using a mixture of acetone and/or dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide and the emulsifier Uniperol짰 EL (wetting agent having an emulsifying and<br>
dispersing action based on ethoxylated alkylphenols) in a volume ratio of sol-<br>
vent/emulsifier of 99:1. The mixture was then made up to 100 ml with water. This stock<br>
 solution was diluted with the solvent/emulsifier/water mixture described to give the de-<br>
sired concentration of active compounds.<br><br>
Activity against gray mold on bell pepper leaves caused by Botrytis cinerea, pro-<br>
tective application<br>
Bell pepper seedlings of the cultivar "Neusiedler Ideal Elite" were, after 2-3 leaves were<br>
well developed, sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous suspension having the concen-<br>
tration of active compounds stated below. The next day, the treated plants were inocu-<br>
lated with a spore suspension of Botrytis cinerea which comprised 1.7 x 106 spores/ml in<br>
a 2% strength aqueous biomalt solution. The test plants were then placed into a dark cli-<br>
matized chamber at 22-24째C and high atmospheric humidity. After 5 days, the extent of<br>
the fungal infection on the leaves could be determined visually in %.<br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with 250 mg/l of compounds 9.1, 9.3,<br>
9.12, 9.13, 9.14, 9.17, 9.18, 9.19, 9.20, 9.30, 9.32, 9.33, 9.35, 9.36, 9.37, 9.38, 9.39,<br>
9.40, 9.42, 9.43, 9.44 and 9.45 from Table 9 showed an infection of at most 20%,<br>
whereas the untreated plants were 90% infected.<br>
Activity against leaf blotch on wheat caused by Leptosphaeria nodorum<br>
Pots of wheat plants of the cultivar "Kanzler" were sprayed to runoff point with an<br>
aqueous suspension having the concentration of active compounds stated below. The<br>
next day, the pots were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Leptosphaeria<br>
nodorum (syn.Stagonosporoa nodorum, Septoroia nodorum). The plants were then<br>
placed into a chamber at 20째C and maximum atmospheric humidity. After 8 days, the<br>
leaf blotch on the untreated but infected control plants had developed to such an extent<br>
that the infection could be determined visually in %.<br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with 250 mg/l of compounds 9.1, 9.2,<br>
9.13 and 9.27 from Table 9 showed an infection of at most 20%, whereas the untreated<br>
plants were 60% infected.<br>
Curative activity against brown rust on wheat caused by Puccinia recondita<br>
Leaves of potted wheat seedlings of the cultivar "Kanzler" were inoculated with a spore<br>
suspension of brown rust (Puccinia recondita). The pots were then placed into a chamber<br>
with high atmospheric humidity (90 to 95%) at 20-22째C for 24 hours. During this time, the<br>
spores germinated and the germ tubes penetrated into the leaf tissue. The next day, the<br>
infected plants were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous suspension having the con-<br>
centration of active compounds stated below. The suspension or emulsion was prepared<br>
as described above. After the spray coating had dried on, the test plants were cultivated in<br>
a greenhouse at temperatures between 20 and 22째C and at 65 to 70% relative atmos-<br>
pheric humidity for 7 days. The extent of the rust fungus development on the leaves was<br>
then determined.<br><br>
Irvthis test, the plants which had been treated with 250 mg/l of compounds 9.1, 9.3, 9.4,<br>
9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12, 9.13, 9.14, 9.15, 9.17, 9.18, 9.19, 9.20, 9.21,<br>
9.25, 9.26, 9.27, 9.28, 9.29, 9.33, 9.34, 9.35, 9.36, 9.37, 9.38, 9.39, 9.40, 9.42, 9.43,<br>
9.44 and 9.45 from Table 9 showed an infection of at most 20%, whereas the untreated<br>
plants were 90% infected.<br>
Comparative experiment - activity against gray mold on bell pepper leaves<br>
caused by Botrytis cinerea, protective application<br>
Compound No. 47 of Table 1 from EP-A 0 589 301 was compared to compounds 9.17<br>
and 9.20 according to the invention from Table 9.<br>
Bell pepper seedlings of the cultivar "Neusiedler Ideal Elite" were, after 2-3 leaves were<br>
well developed, sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous suspension having the concen-<br>
