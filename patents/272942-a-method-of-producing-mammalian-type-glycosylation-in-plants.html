				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of glycoprotein processing in transgenic plants, in particular in such plants as used for the production of recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recombinant protein production constitutes an important application of transgenic plants. In addition to the yield and the favorable cost of the field production of recombinant proteins, transgenic plants present certain advantages over other production systems, such as bacteria, yeasts, and animal cells. Indeed, they are devoid of agents infectious to humans, and can accumulate the proteins of interest in storage tissues, such as seeds or tubers. This facilitates their handling, their transportation and their storage at ambient temperature, while affording the possibility of subsequent extraction. Moreover, the transgenic plant, or some of its parts, can be utilized as vector of medicaments or of vaccines.<br>
Although the advantages of plants as factories of proteinaceous substances are explained mostly in the light of biopharmaceuticals, plants are also useful for production of other proteins, e.g., industrial enzymes and the like, because of their capability of glycosylation leading e. g. to higher stability. Today, the utilization of plants for the production of heterologous glycoproteins for therapeutic and other use is investigated in soy, tobacco, potato, rice and rapeseed, and the glycoproteins produced therein include monoclonal antibodies, hormones, vaccine antigens, enzymes and blood proteins. Some of these proteins have already proven their efficacy in humans.<br>
A drawback of glycoprotein production in plants relates to the glycosylation pattern of the glycoproteins produced in plants. Like other heterologous expression systems, plants exhibit a different glycosylation profile compared to mammals. In contrast to bacteria, having no N-linked glycans, and yeast, having only N-linked glycans of the high mannose type, plants are able to produce proteins with N-linked glycans of the complex type. However, plant glycoproteins have complex N-linked glycans containing |31,2-xylose and al,3-fucose residues not found in mammals. Moreover, plant glycoproteins lack the characteristic galactose-containing complex N-glycans found in mammals.<br>
In short, analyses of glycoproteins from plants have indicated that, although similarities exist, several steps in the glycosylation pathways of plants and mammals are<br><br>
different, particularly in the synthesis of complex glycans. The complex glycans of plants are generally much smaller and contain beta-1,2 xylose or alpha-1,3 fucose residues attached to the Man3(GlcNAc)2 core. Such residues on glycoprotein are known to be immunogenic, which causes problems for certain applications of recombinant proteins carrying these sugars.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although some plant-based systems for the production of glycoproteins have been proposed or are in use there is a need for improved plant-based systems for the production of humanized proteins. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides such improved plant-based systems.<br>
Previously proposed plant-based systems, such as described in e.g., WOO 1/31045 (the entire contents is incorporated herein), utilized mammalian β1,4- galactosyltransferase for the production of humanized proteins.<br>
It has now been discovered that certain, previously uncharacterized glycosyltransferases such as those derived from the non-mammals, chicken and zebrafish, exhibiting homology to certain parts of characterized mammalian β1 ,4-galactosyltransferases, show unexpected improvements over previous methods in the production of humanized proteins.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Golgi apparatus is an organelle where complex glycan formation takes place and is the site of the glycosylation machinery. The key mediators of glycosylation are the glycosyltransferases. One of the best studied Golgi-associated glycosyltransferase is pi,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (GalT). pl,4-galactosyltransferase 1 consists of a cytosolic tail, a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a catalytic domain. Numerous genes of glycosyl transferases of mammals have already been cloned. The ease of transformation of plant systems, allowed researchers to "complement" the Golgi apparatus of plants by<br><br>
glycosyltransferases from mammals in order to "humanize" or "mammalize" the glycans of the glycoproteins they produce.<br>
The use of non-mammalian β,4-galactosyltransferases (GalT) has hitherto not been reported for the production of mammalized or humanized glycoproteins in plants.<br>
It has now been discovered that certain, previously uncharacterized non-mammalian pi,4-galactosyltransferases, such as those derived from chicken and zebrafish, can be utilized for terminal galactosylation of N-linked glycoproteins in plants, and that these non-mammalian β1,4-galactosyltransferases show unexpected improvements over previous methods in the production of humanized proteins. For example chicken βi,4-galactosyltransferase produces mostly hybrid-type N-linked glycans lacking both pl,2-xylose and βl,3-fucose residues.<br>
It was further found that non-mammalian β1,4-galactosy!transferases from chicken and zebrafish are shorter than mammalian  β-1 ,4-galatosytransferases and lack an amino-terminal region present in mammalian βi,4-galactosyltransferases. These non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galatosyltransferases can be extended at the amino-terminus with an amino acid sequence corresponding to the amino-terminus of a mammalian pi,4-galactosyltransferase, the "mammalian extension." These modified versions of the non-mammalian pi,4-galactosyltransferases produce certain N-linked glycans to a higher degree compared to human pi,4-galactosyltransferase. For example, zebrafish GalT having substituted its amino-terminal for the CTS region of rat sialyltransferase, produces mainly biantennary, double galactosylated N-glycans.<br>
The invention, in some embodiments, provides unmodified or modified non-mammalian GalTs from chicken and fish that are used to produce mammalized glycoproteins in plants. Mammalized glycoproteins produced in plants or plant cells expressing such non-mammalian βi,4-galactosyltransferases are also provided in certain embodiments.<br>
Definitions<br>
The term "nucleic acid" as used herein, includes reference to a deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymer, i.e., a polynucleotide, in either single-or double-stranded form, and unless otherwise limited, encompasses known analogues having the essential nature of<br><br>
natural nucleotides in that they hybridize to single-stranded nucleic acids in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides (e. g., peptide nucleic acids). A polynucleotide can be full-length or a subsequence of a native or heterologous structural or regulatory gene. Unless otherwise indicated, the term includes reference to the specified sequence as well as the complementary sequence thereof. Thus, DNAs or RNAs with backbones modified for stability or for other reasons are "polynucleotides" as that term is intended herein. Moreover, DNAs or RNAs comprising unusual bases, such as inosine, or modified bases, such as tritylated bases, to name just two examples, are polynucleotides as the term is used herein. It will be appreciated that a great variety of modifications have been made to DNA and RNA that serve many useful purposes known to those of skill in the art. The term polynucleotide as it is employed herein embraces such chemically, enzymatically or metabolically modified forms of polynucleotides, as well as the chemical forms of DNA and RNA characteristic of viruses and cells, including among other things, simple and complex cells.<br>
"Nucleic acid molecules coding for" or "nucleic acid molecules encoding" as used herein are not limited to individual or separate molecules, for example nucleic acid molecules as separate entities, wherein each entity comprises one nucleic acid molecules, it also encompasses that one or more nucleic acid molecules may be linked in one contiguous sequence, which may be separated by any intervening sequence. The order and orientation of the nucleic acid molecules in one contiguous sequence is not limited to any specific configuration, e.g. the nucleic acid molecules may be linked to the same promoter, or a different promoter, may be mono- or bidirectional, and may be directly adjacent or separated by intervening sequence. Various such configurations are known in the art. Additional nucleic acid molecules may be combined in one contiguous sequence, or may be provided as separate entities. For example, in certain embodiments plants or plant cells are provided comprising nucleic acid molecules comprising a non-mammalian (3-1,4-galactosyltransferase, a heterologous glycoprotein and one or more selection markers. These nucleic acid molecules may be provided in the form of one, two, three, or more vectors, as described herein.<br>
The terms "polypeptide," "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical analogue of a corresponding<br><br>
naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers. The essential nature of such analogues of naturally occurring amino acids is that, when incorporated into a protein, that protein is specifically reactive to antibodies elicited to the same protein but consisting entirely of naturally occurring amino acids. The terms "polypeptide," "peptide" and "protein" are also inclusive of modifications including, but not limited to, glycosylation, lipid attachment, sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, hydroxylation and ADP-ribosylation.<br>
A "coding" or "encoding" sequence is the part of a gene that codes for the amino acid sequence of a protein, or for a functional RNA such as a tRNA or rRNA and specifically refers to the fact that the nucleic acid sequence comprises the information for translation into the specified protein. A nucleic acid encoding a protein may comprise non-translated sequences (e. g., introns) within translated regions of the nucleic acid, or may lack such intervening non-translated sequences (e. g., as in cDNA). The information by which a protein is encoded is specified by the use of codons. Typically, the amino acid sequence is encoded by the nucleic acid using the "universal" genetic code. However, variants of the universal code, such as are present in some plant, animal, and fungal mitochondria, the bacterium Mycoplasma capricolum, or the ciliate Macronucleus, may be used when the nucleic acid is expressed therein. When the nucleic acid is prepared or altered synthetically, advantage can be taken of known codon preferences of the intended host where the nucleic acid is to be expressed. For example, although nucleic acid sequences of the present invention may be expressed in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species, sequences can be modified to account for the specific codon preferences and GC content preferences of monocotyledons or dicotyledons as these preferences have been shown to differ.<br>
"Expression" refers to the transcription of a gene into structural RNA (rRNA, tRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) with subsequent translation into a protein.<br>
The term "non-mammalian" in relation to a protein or nucleic acid refers to such compounds derived from a non-mammal, including, e.g., a non-mammalian vertebrate, such as a bird (e.g., a chicken or duck) or a fish, and a non-mammalian invertebrate. Very suitable sources of non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferases (and coding sequences) are chicken and fish.<br><br>
The term "mammalian" in relation to a protein or nucleic acid refers to such compounds derived from a mammal, e.g., a human, a non-human primate, a mouse, pig, cow, goat, cat, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, hamster, horse, monkey, sheep, wallaby, platypus or other non-human mammal.<br>
The term " β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase," refers to the glycosyltransferase EC 2.4.1.38 ( β-1 ,4-GalTl) that is required for the biosynthesis of the backbone structure from type 2 chain (GalBl ~*4GlcNAc), which appears widely on N-linked glycans, i.e., which enzyme has galactosylating activity on i.a. N-linked glycans. The type 2 chain is particularly important in the synthesis of sialyl lewis x and SSEA-1, which play a role in the immune system and early embryogenesis, respectively. Mammalian P-1,4-galactosyltransferase are provided herein (e.g., from human, mouse, rat), as well as orthologs of  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase from non-mammalian species, such as chicken and fish.<br>
The term "sequence identity" as used herein denotes the presence of identity between two or more polynucleotides or between two or more polypeptides. Polynucleotides or polypeptides have "identical" sequences if the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids, respectively, of one polynucleotide or polypeptide is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence to another polynucleotide or polypeptide. Sequence comparison between two or more polynucleotides or polypeptides is generally performed by comparing portions of two sequences over a comparison window to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. The comparison window is generally from about 20 to 200 contiguous nucleotides or from about 7 to 70 contiguous amino acids. The "percentage of sequence identity" for polynucleotides or polypeptides, such as 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100 percent sequence identity may be determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypetide sequence in the comparison window may include additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by: (a) determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions; (b) dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison; and (c) multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of<br><br><br>
sequence homology. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by computerized implementations of known algorithms, or by inspection. Algorithms and software suitable for use in aligning sequences for comparison and calculation of sequence homology or identity will be known to those skilled in the art. Significant examples of such tools are the Pearson and Lipman search based FASTA and BLAST programs, details of these may be found in Altschul et al (1997), Nucleic Acid Res. 25:3389-3402; Altschul et al (1990), J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-10; Pearson and Lipman (1988), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444-8; Lipman and Pearson (1985), Science 227:1435-41). Other suitable programs include the PILEUP, LINEUP, GAP, BESTFIT and FASTA programs in the GCG® Wisconsin Package® of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wl, USA, now offered through Accelrys Inc. Details of the above programs are available on the internet through 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST' or mirror sites and "http://www.accelrys.com/products/gcg_wisconsinj3ackage." Thus such homology and identity percentages can be ascertained using publicly or commercially available software packages or by computer servers on the internet. By the term "identity" is meant that the stated percentage of the claimed amino acid sequence or nucleic acid sequence is to be found in the reference sequence in the same relative positions when the sequences are optimally aligned, notwithstanding the fact that the sequences may have deletions or additions in certain positions requiring introduction of gaps to allow alignment of the highest percentage of amino acids or bases. Preferably the sequence are aligned by using 10 or less gaps, i.e., the total number of gaps introduced into the two sequences when added together is 10 or less. The length of such gaps is not of particular importance but generally will be no more than 10, and preferably no more than 5 amino acids, or 30 and preferably no more than 15 bases.<br>
The term "degeneracy of the genetic code" refers to the fact that a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are "silent variations." Every nucleic acid sequence herein that encodes a polypeptide also, by reference to the genetic code, describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid.<br><br>
The term "complementary" in "complementary strand" means that the nucleic acid strand has a sequence of nucleotides which forms a hydrogen-bonded duplex with another sequence of nucleotides according to Watson-Crick base-paring rules. For example, the complementary base sequence for 5'-AAGGCT-3' is 3'-TTCCGA-5'.<br>
The term "galactosylated n-linked glycan" refers to the common core of an n-linked oligosaccharide unit in glycoproteins that consists of a chitobiose core with at least three mannoses and at least one N-acetylglucosamine residue and that is further extended with at least one galactose residue on a N-acetylglucosamine at the nonreducing end.<br>
The term "antibody" includes reference to antigen binding forms of antibodies (e.g., Fab, F(ab)2). The term "antibody" frequently refers to a polypeptide substantially encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or immunoglobulin genes, or fragments thereof which specifically bind and recognize an analyte (antigen). However, while various antibody fragments can be defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein, also includes antibody fragments such as single chain Fv, chimeric antibodies (i.e., comprising constant and variable regions from different species), humanized antibodies (i.e., comprising a complementarity determining region (CDR) from a non-human source) and heteroconjugate antibodies (e. g., bispecific antibodies).<br>
The term "antibody heavy or light chain" are used in their art-recognized meaning.<br>
The term "functional fragment" refers to a shortened version of the protein which is a functional variant or functional derivative. A "functional variant" or a "functional derivative" of a protein is a protein the amino acid sequence of which can be derived from the amino acid sequence of the original protein by the substitution, deletion and/or addition of one or more amino acid residues in a way that, in spite of the change in the amino acid sequence, the functional variant retains at least a part of at least one of the biological activities of the original protein that is detectable for a person skilled in the art. A functional variant is generally at least 50% homologous (preferably the amino acid sequence is at least 50% identical), at least 70% homologous or at least 90% homologous to the protein from which it can be derived. A functional variant may also be any functional part of a protein. In certain embodiments, the function is galactosyltransferase activity. In some embodiments the amino acid sequence differs from SEQ ID N0:2 (the<br><br>
protein sequence of chicken galactosyltransferase) or SEQ ID NO: 14 (the protein sequence of zebrafish galactosyltransferase) mainly or only by conservative substitutions. In some embodiments the protein comprises an amino acid sequence having 65% or more, 75% or more, 85% or more, 90% or more, or 95% or more, sequence identity with SEQ ID N0:2 or SEQ ID NO: 14 and in certain embodiments 100% identity with those sequences. "Functional" as used herein also includes functional in plants.<br>
The expression "conservative substitutions" as used with respect to amino acids relates to the substitution of a given amino acid by an amino acid having similar biochemical characteristics. Thus, in some embodiments, where an amino acid in the sequence of SEQ ID N0:2 or SEQ ID NO: 14 has a hydrophobic group, a conservative substitution replaces it by another amino acid also having a hydrophobic group; other such biochemical similarities are those where the characteristic group is hydrophilic, cationic, anionic or contains a thiol or thioether. Such substitutions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, i.e. see US Patent No. 5,380,712. Conservative amino acid substitutions may be made, for example within the group of aliphatic non-polar amino acids (Gly, Ala, Pro, He, Leu, Val), the group of polar uncharged amino acids (Cys, Ser, Thr, Met, Asn, Gin), the group of polar charged amino acids (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg) or the group of aromatic amino acids (His, Phe, Tyr, Trp).<br>
The term "selection marker" refers to a polynucleotide sequence encoding a metabolic trait which allows for the separation of transgenic and non-transgenic organisms and may refer to the provision of antibiotic resistance. A selectable marker is for example the aphL] encoded kanamycin resistance marker, the nptll gene, the gene coding for hygromycin resistance. Other resistance markers are well known in the art. Other selection markers are for instance reporter genes such as chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, p-galactosidase, luciferase and green fluorescence protein. Identification methods for the products of reporter genes include, but are not limited to, enzymatic assays and fluorimetric assays. Reporter genes and assays to detect their products are well known in the art and are described, for example in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, eds. Ausubel et al., Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience: New York (1987) and periodic updates.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "vector" includes reference to a nucleic acid used in transfection of a host cell and into which can be inserted a polynucleotide. Vectors are often replicons. Expression vectors permit transcription of a nucleic acid inserted therein.<br>
As used herein, the term "operably linked" refers to a functional linkage or juxtaposition wherein the components so described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A control sequence "operably linked" to another control sequence and/or to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that transcription and/or expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequence. Generally, operably linked means that the nucleic acid sequences being linked are contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein coding regions, contiguous and in the same reading frame.<br>
By "host cell" is meant a cell which contains a vector and supports the replication and/or expression of the vector. Host cells may be prokaryotic cells such as E. coli, or eukaryotic cells such as plant, yeast, insect, amphibian, or mammalian cells.<br>
As used herein, "heterologous" in reference to a nucleic acid is a nucleic acid that originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is modified from its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by intervention. For example, a promoter operably linked to a heterologous structural gene is from a species different from that from which the structural gene was derived, or, if from the same species, one or both are modified from their original form. A heterologous protein may originate from a foreign species or, if from the same species, is modified from its original form by intervention.<br>
The term "regulatory sequence" or "control sequence" is defined herein to include any component which is necessary or advantageous for expression of a coding sequence. A regulatory sequence may be native or foreign to the coding sequence. Such regulatory sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, a polyadenylation sequence, a propeptide sequence, a promoter, a signal sequence, and a transcription terminator. Such sequences are well known in the art. At a minimum, the regulatory sequences include a promoter, or certain promoter elements and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The regulatory sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the regulatory sequences with the coding region of the nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide.<br><br>
The term "promoter" is used herein for its art-recognized meaning to denote a portion of a gene containing DNA sequences that provide for the binding of RNA polymerase and initiation of transcription. Promoter sequences are commonly, but not always, found in the 5' non-coding regions of genes. A "plant promoter" is a promoter capable of initiating transcription in plant cells whether or not its origin is a plant cell. Exemplary plant promoters include, but are not limited to, those that are obtained from plants, plant viruses, and bacteria which comprise genes expressed in plant cells such as Agrobacterium or Rhizobium. Examples of suitable promoters are the 35S promoter of Cauliflauwer mosaic virus and derivatives thereof, the ferredoxin promoter, the nopaline synthase (nos), mannopine synthase (mas) and octopine synthase (ocs) promoters (EP 0 122 791, EP 0 126 546, EP 0 145 338), the ubiquitin promoter (EP 0 342 926), the cassava vein mosaic virus promoter and the chrysanthemum promoter for the short subunit of Rubisco.<br>
The term "transgenic plant or plant cell" includes reference to a plant or plant cell which comprises within its genome a heterologous polynucleotide. Generally, the heterologous polynucleotide is stably integrated within the genome such that the polynucleotide is passed on to successive generations. The heterologous polynucleotide may be integrated into the genome alone or as part of a recombinant expression cassette. Also, it is possible that the heterologous polynucleotide is not or not stably integrated in the genome of the transformed plant. In that case, the gene can be 'transiently' expressed, implying that expression occurs for a given time, after which the introduced polynucleotide is lost from the cell. For the purposes of this invention, a transgenic plant or plant cell also includes plants or plant cells which transiently express the heterologous polypeptide. "Transgenic" is used herein to include any cell, cell line, callus, tissue, plant part or plant, the genotype of which has been altered by the presence of heterologous nucleic acid including those transgenics initially so altered as well as those created by sexual crosses or asexual propagation from the initial transgenic. The term "transgenic" as used herein does not encompass the alteration of the genome (chromosomal or extra-chromosomal) by conventional plant breeding methods or by naturally occurring events such as random cross-fertilization, non-recombinant viral infection, non-recombinant bacterial transformation, non-recombinant transposition, or spontaneous mutation.<br><br>
The term "insertion" in the context of introducing a nucleic acid into a cell, means "transfection" or "transformation" or "transduction" and includes reference to the incorporation of a nucleic acid into a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell where the nucleic acid may be incorporated into the genome of the cell (e.g., chromosome, plasmid, plastid or mitochondrial DNA), converted into an autonomous replicon, or transiently expressed (e.g., transfected mRNA).<br>
As used herein, the term "plant" includes (reference to) whole plants, plant organs (e.g., leaves, stems, roots, etc.), seeds and plant cells and progeny of same. Plant cell(s), as used herein includes, without limitation, seeds, embryos, meristematic regions, callus tissue, leaves, roots, shoots, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen, and microspores. In some embodiments plant cells are grown in suspension culture. In some embodiments plant cells are capable of regenerating a whole plant. The class of plants which can be used in the methods of the invention is generally as broad as the class of higher plants amenable to transformation techniques, including both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. As used herein when referring to plants the whole spectrum of plants ranging from algae to trees is intended unless otherwise specified. Preferred plants are Nicotiana ssp., preferably A'^, tahacum or N.benthamiana.<br>
The term "specifically recognizing", includes reference to a binding reaction between an antibody and a protein having an epitope recognized by the antigen binding site of the antibody. This binding reaction is determinative of the presence of a protein having the recognized epitope amongst the presence of a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologies. Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to an analyte having the recognized epitope to a substantially greater degree (e.g., at least 2-fold over background) than to substantially all analytes lacking the epitope which are present in the sample. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions may require an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. For example, antibodies raised to the polypeptides described herein, e.g., SEQ ID NOS. 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16,18 and 20 can be selected to obtain antibodies specifically recognizing these polypeptides. The proteins or polypeptides used as immunogens can be in native conformation or denatured so as to provide a linear epitope. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically recognizing a particular protein (or other analyte). For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely<br><br>
used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See Harlow and Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York (1988), for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine selective reactivity.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules and cellular expression systems<br>
Although a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide described herein can be expressed in any cellular expression system, such as plants, yeast, bacteria, non-mammalian and mammalian cellular expression systems, the nucleic acid molecules are preferably expressed in plants or plant cells, which may be grown in suspension.<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides plants or plant cells comprising functional proteins providing N-glycan biosynthesis, wherein the protein is a non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase, e.g., from chicken or fish origin. In other embodiments, said non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferases are extended at the N-terminus with an N-terminal extension sequence facilitating localization with respect to the Golgi-apparatus to enable the intended function of the enzyme. The N-terminal extension sequence generally consists of a cytosolic tail comprising a Golgi-localization signal sequence and a transmembrane domain. Such an N-terminal sequence (designated as "CTS") can be derived from a mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase, from a mammalian sialyltransferase or from any other Golgi-localized protein and fused to the catalytic domain of a non-mammalian GalT, e.g., from chicken or fish origin, and expressed in plant cells or plants.<br>
The N-terminal cytoplasmic, transmembrane region (referred to as CTS region herein) of glycosyltransferases determines the localisation of the enzyme in the ER or Golgi membrane. To provide natural or desirable glycosylation, glycosyltransferases can be expressed in plants as they occur in mammals, but can also be expressed as a fusion protein between two, or part of two, different glycosyltransferases. In this case the localisation is determined by one enzyme and the catalytic activity by a second enzyme. As an example, a fusion between the cytoplasmic, transmembrane and stem region of a rat sialyltransferase and the catalytic domain of mammalian galactosyltransferase, such as provided, for example, in SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO: 17, provides an enzyme with galactosyltransferase activity and localisation of the sialyltransferase.<br><br>
The usable N-terminal extensions of mammalian GalT enzymes are characterised in that they have a length of about 10-20 amino acids and that they contain the motif [K/R]-X-[K/R] (in which KJR means either a lysine or an arginine residue and X can be any amino acid) in the first 10 amino-terminal amino acids of the cytosolic tail sequence.<br>
In certain embodiments, the N-terminal amino acid sequence extension comprises the first 13 amino acid residues of the human B-l,4-galactosyltransferase polypeptide 1 sequence, i.e., MRLREPLLSGSAA (SEQ ID N0:21), see Figure 1. In other embodiments, the CTS of the non-mammalian GalT is replaced with the CTS from another Golgi-localized protein; the replacement could for example be derived from the CTS from the rat a2,6-sialyltransferase (Genbank accession Ml 8769).<br>

The mammalian extension may comprise, for example, the first 13 amino acid residues of the human 6-1,4-galactosyltransferase polypeptide 1 sequence, i.e., MRLREPLLSGSAA (SEQ ID N0:21), or the CTS of the non-mammalian GalT is replaced with the CTS from another Golgi-localized protein; the<br><br>
replacement could for example be derived from the CTS from the rat a2,6-sialyltransferase (Genbank accession Ml 8769). In other embodiments the functional non-mammalian β1 ,4-galactosyltransferase comprising the mammalian extension is 75%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to chicken β1,4-galactosyltransferase amino acid sequence (SEQ ID N0:2).<br>

In some embodiments the above mentioned  β1 ant cell or  β1 ant produces at least bi-antennary N-linked glycans, as well as bi-antennary N-glycans comprising at least one galactosylated GlcNAc residue. In certain embodiments the total amount of bi-antennary N-linked glycans and/or bi-antennary N-glycans comprising at least one galactosylated GlcNAc residue is 2-fold increased over the amount produced by a  β1 ant cell or  β1 ant expressing wild-type human β1,4- galactosyltransferase. In other embodiments the amount is increased by 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 50-, 100-, 250-, 500-, 1000-, or 10,000-fold increased.<br>
In certain embodiments the nucleic acids encoding a non-mammalian P-1,4-galactosyltransferase that is extended at the N-terminus with a sequence derived from the N-terminus of a mammalian 61,4-galactosyltransferase 1 or with an N-terminal CTS sequence from a mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase or sialyltransferase, described herein, may alternatively be extended with any other CTS sequence from a Golgi-localized protein from  plants, animals or fungi resulting in trans-Golgi localized expression of the non-mammalian GalT catalytic domain to which it is fused at its C-terminus. Such nucleic acids are provided herein.<br><br>
In certain embodiments the  plant cells or  plants express in addition to a non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase, described herein, a second protein, preferably a mammalian protein to be provided with a galactosylated //-linked glycan, producing a heterologuos glycoprotein of which Bl,4-galactosylation of its N-glycans, biantennary or alternatively in a hybrid form is of interest. Such glycoproteins produced in  plant cells or  plants expressing a non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase are also provided herein.<br>
In certain embodiments, said second protein is expressed from a nucleic acid that encodes an antibody heavy and/or light chain or a functional fragment thereof<br>
The skilled person is well acquainted with expression of recombinant nucleic acids in cellular expression systems, such as for example  plant cells that can generate whole  plants. An expression vector may be used for expression of recombinant nucleic acids in cellular expression systems. In certain embodiments, such a vector will comprise a DNA encoding a non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase or an enzymatically active derivative or part thereof that optionally is extended at the N-terminus or in which its own CTS is replaced with an N-terminal CTS sequence from another Golgi-localized protein in such a way that it will have galactosylating activity on Af-linked glycans. A suitable vector may further comprise regulatory elements such as a promotor, and optionally at least one selection marker expressible in said cellular expression system. The expression vector may further encode at least one further DNA encoding a mammalian glycoprotein which can be glycosylated.<br>
In certain embodiments a  plants or  plant cell is provided that has been provided with a functional non-mammalian enzyme (optionally with N-terminal extension derived from a mammalian GalT or in which the endogenous CTS has been replaced with another CTS from a Golgi-localized protein from  plants) providing N-glycan biosynthesis that is normally not present in  plants thereby for example providing the capacity to extend an N-linked glycan by the addition of a galactose. In certain embodiments expression is transient while in other embodiments,  plants or  plant cells are provided wherein expression of non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase or an enzymatically active derivative or part thereof, and optionally of an additional heterologous protein that may be glycosylated, is stable. In certain embodiments a third protein is additionally expressed by a  plant cell or  plant. Such a third protein may be an enzyme which further processes the glycosylation of said galactosylated second protein. In certain embodiments, a  plant cell or  plant may<br><br>
comprise two nucleic acids encoding for a monomer of a dimeric or multimeric protein. In certain embodiments separate nucleic acids are provided for both an antibody light and heavy chain or functional fragment thereof or for any other dimeric or multimeric protein of interest. Of course, it is not necessary that a full protein is expressed. In certain embodiments a  plant cell or  plant according to the invention expresses only a fragment, preferably a functional fragment of said second mammalian glycoprotein, said fragment having at least one activity of the whole protein and further being characterized by for example a truncated polypeptide chain, or a not fully extended glycan, for example only extended with galactose. Such glycoproteins or fragments thereof are also provided herein.<br>
The addition of  plant-specific residues such as  β1 ,2-xylose and al,3-fucose residues to glycoproteins produced in  plants makes such glycoproteins less suited for pharmaceutical use, because of the undesirable antigenic and immunogenic characteristics of pi,2-xylose and al,3-fucose residues in mammals. To substantially limit the number of |31,2-xylose and al,3-fucose residues on  plant produced glycoproteins or to achieve a com β1 ete lack of these residues, strategies are required that modify the genome of  plant cells in such a manner that the synthesized glycoproteins dis β1 ay humanized or mammalized characteristics.<br>
In certain embodiments,  plant cells or  plants are provided, wherein a second protein, and preferably a second mammalian protein or functional fragment thereof, comprises an extended iV-linked glycan that is devoid of xylose and/or of fucose.  plant-derived galactosylated glycoproteins still may contain xylose and fucose residues. In certain embodiments, non-mammalian |31,4-galactosyltransferase or a modified mersion thereof described elsewhere herein, is therefore expressed in  plants in such a way that the enzyme acts in the Golgi apparatus on the natural substrates, that is, subsequent to the action of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, Golgi-mannosidase II and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II, and in  plants, provided that these enzymes are not inhibited in another way, subsequent to or during the action of xylosyltransferase and fucosyltransferase. A galactosylated protein obtained from a  plant is herein referred to as  plant-derived. Such  plant-derived galactosylated proteins are also provided herein.<br>
To mammalize the glycosylation of  plants for the production of tailor-made glycoproteins in  plants xylosyltransferases and fucosyltransferases may be knocked out or silenced and at least one of several mammalian glycosyltransferases has to be expressed.<br><br>
Providing the xylosyltransferase and fucosyltransferase knocic-outs and thereby reducing the unwanted glycosylation potential of  plants is a feasible option because for example an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant mutated in the gene encoding N-acetylglucos'aminyltransferase I was com β1 etely viable. As N-<br>
acetylglucosaminyltransferase I is the enzyme initiating the formation of com β1 ex glycans this  plant com β1 etely lacks the xylose and fucose residues containing com β1 ex glycans.<br>
In certain embodiments  plants or  plant cells are provided wherein a non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase or an enzymatically active derivative or part thereof, an additional heterologous protein that may be glycosylated, and optionally additionally a third protein providing further N-glycan biosynthesis are expressed, and wherein the genes encoding enzymes responsible for xylose and/or fucose addition are knocked-out or wherein expression of these genes is silenced using antisense or RNAi technology. Methods for gene knockouts in  plants or gene silencing through RNAi are well known in the art.<br>
RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism that inhibits gene expression at the stage of translation or by hindering the transcription of specific genes. Small interfering RNA strands (siRNA) are key to the RNAi process, and have complementary nucleotide sequences to the targeted RNA strand. Specific RNAi pathway proteins, such as dicer (RISC), are guided by the siRNA to the targeted messenger RNA (mRNA), where they cleave the target into smaller portions that can no longer be translated into protein. RNA interference is a vital part of the immune response to viruses and other foreign genetic material, especially in  plants.<br>
RNA interference has been used for applications in  plant biotechnology, for example in the engineering of food  plants that produce lower levels of natural  plant toxins, in tomato  plants to reduce the levels of allergens, and in tomatoes to fortify the  plant with dietary antioxidants (Sunilkumar G. etal. (2006) Pwc Natl Acad Sci USA 103 (48): 18054-9; Siritunga D, Sayre R (2003)  planta 217 (3): 367-73; Le L. et al. (2006)  plant BiotechnolJA (2): 231-42; Niggeweg R. et al. (2004) Nat Biotechnol 22 (6): 746-54). Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in  plant stocks.<br>
In other embodiments methods are provided to specifically separate and purify glycoproteins comprising extended TV-linked glycan that is devoid of xylose and/or of fucose. Several types of separation techniques exist, such as (immuno) affinity<br><br>
purification or size-exclusion chromatography or electrophoresis, to mediate the required purification. Such methods are well known in the art (see, e.g., US 2008/0003680).<br>
One of skill in the art will appreciate that the invention is not limited to  plants or  plant cells but also provides other organisms like animals, fungi or yeast, or cell lines like mammalian cell lines or insect cell lines with the capacity to produce a glycoprotein (essentially nonsialylated) according to the invention wherein said A^-1 inked glycan comprises a galactose.<br>
Generating transiently or stably transformed  plants which produce tailored glycoproteins of commercial interest may be established, in some embodiments, by inoculating  plant cells or tissues with Agrobacterium strains containing a (binary) vector which comprises both nucleotide sequences encoding iV-glycosylation modifying enzymes as described herein and genes encoding commercially interesting heterologous glycoproteins. Alternatively, in some embodiments, transiently or stably transformed  plants which produce tailored glycoproteins of commercial interest may be generated by simultaneous inoculation (co-transformation) of two or mort Agrobacterium strains each carrying a vector comprising either nucleotide sequences encoding A^'glycosylation modifying enzymes or nucleotide sequences encoding heterologous glycoproteins of commercial interest. Alternatively, in some embodiments, transiently or stably transformed  plants which produce tailored glycoproteins of commercial interest can be generated by (multi β1 e) crossing (s) of  plants with modified A^glycosylation with  plants which express polynucleotides encoding proteins of commercial interest. In all of these procedures, the vector may also comprise a nucleic acid sequence which confers resistance against a selection agent.<br>
In order to obtain satisfactory expression of the proteins involved in A^-glycosylation and of the glycoproteins or polypeptides of commercial interest, the nucleotide sequences may be adapted to the specific transcription and translation machinery of the host  plant as known to people skilled in the art. For example, silent mutations in the coding regions may be introduced to improve codon usage and specific promoters may be used to drive expression of said genes in relevant  plant tissues. Promoters which are developmentally regulated or which can be induced at will, may be used to ensure expression at the appropriate time, for example, only after  plant tissues have been harvested from the field and brought into controlled conditions. In all these cases.<br><br>
choice of expression cassettes of the glycosylation modifying proteins and of the glycoproteins of commercial interest should be such that they express in the same cells to allow desired post-translational modifications to the glycoprotein.<br>
In certain embodiments tobacco  plants are provided, or a  plant related to the genus Nicotiana ssp., preferably A^. tabacum or N.benthamiana. In other embodiments other relatively easily transformable  plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, or Zea mays, or  plants related thereto may be used. For the production of recombinant glycoproteins, use of duckweed offers specific advantages. The  plants are in general small and reproduce asexually through vegetative budding. Most duckweed species have all the tissues and organs of much larger  plants including roots, stems, flowers, seeds and fronds. Duckweed can be grown chea β1 y and very fast as a free floating  plant on the surface of sim β1 e liquid solutions in full containment from which they can easily be harvested. In certain embodiments duckweed is recombinantly provided with a non-mammalian P-1,4-galactosyltransferase or modified version thereof described herein and/or genes encoding commercially interesting heterologous glycoproteins. The duckweed  plant may for example comprise the genus Spirodella, genus Wolffia, genus Wolffiella, or the genus Lemna, Lemna minor, Lemna miniscula and Lemna gibba.<br>
In certain embodiments, expression in tomato fruits is provided. Tomatoes can be easily grown in greenhouses under contained and controlled conditions and tomato fruit biomass can be harvested continuously throughout the year in enormous quantities. The watery fraction containing the glycoproteins of interest can be readily separated from the rest of the tomato fruit which allows easier purification of the glycoprotein. In certain embodiments expression in storage organs of other crops is provided including, but not limited to, the kernels of corn, the tubers of potato and the seeds of rape seed or sunflower, which are attractive alternatives that provide huge biomass in organs for which harvesting and processing technology is readily available.<br>
In some embodiments methods are provided for providing a transgenic  plant, such as transgenic Nicotiana ssp., preferably A'^, tabacum or N.benthamiana, Arabidopsis thaliana, or corn, potato, tomato, or duckweed, which are capable of expressing a recombinant protein, with the capacity to extend an A'^-linked glycan with galactose comprising crossing said transgenic  plant with a  plant comprising at least one optionally functional non-mammalian protein, for example, a transporter or an enzyme providing A'^-<br><br>
glycan biosynthesis that is normally not present in  plants, harvesting progeny from said crossing and selecting a desired progeny  plant expressing said recombinant protein and expressing a functional non-mammalian enzyme involved in mammalian-like //-glycan biosynthesis that is normally not present in  plants. In one embodiment, the method may further comprise selecting a desired progeny  plant expressing said recombinant protein comprising an extended A/^-linked glycan at least comprising galactose.<br>
In some embodiments  plants are provided expressing said recombinant glycoprotein comprising an AMinked glycan and expressing non-mammalian enzyme involved in mammalian-like A^-glycan biosynthesis. In additional embodiments, the invention also provides for use of a transgenic  plant to produce a desired glycoprotein or functional fragment thereof, in particular wherein said glycoprotein or functional fragment thereof comprises an extended A^-linked glycan at least comprising galactose.<br>
In some embodiments methods are provided for providing a transgenic  plant cell suspension culture, such as transgenic Nicotiana spp., preferably N.tabacum BY2, Daucus carota or Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension., which are capable of expressing a recombinant protein, with the capacity to extend an N-linked glycan with galactose.<br>
In some embodiments methods are provided for providing a transgenic moss, such as transgenic Bryophytaea, preferably Physcomitrella patens, or Funaria hygrometrica, Ceratodon purpureus, which are capable of expressing a recombinant protein, with the capacity to extend an N-linked glycan with galactose.<br>
In some embodiments methods are provided for obtaining a desired glycoprotein or functional fragment thereof comprising for example an extended Alinked glycan at least comprising galactose. Said methods comprising cultivating a  plant as described herein until said  plant has reached a harvestable stage, for example when sufficient biomass has grown to allow profitable harvesting, followed by harvesting said  plant with established techniques known in the art and fractionating said  plant with established techniques known in the art to obtain fractionated  plant material and at least partly isolating said glycoprotein from said fractionated  plant material.<br>
In some embodiments  plant-derived glycoproteins or functional fragments thereof are provided comprising an extended A^-linked glycan at least comprising galactose, for example obtained by a method as ex β1 ained above. Such a  plant-derived glycoprotein with an extended glycan at least comprising galactose essentially can be any desired<br><br>
glycoprotein that can be expressed in a  plant. For example, antibodies, vaccines, cytokines, FSH, TSH and other hormone glycoproteins, other hormones like EPO, enzymes like antitrypsin or lipase, cellular adhesion molecules like NCAM or collagen can be produced in  plants and be provided with essentially mammalian glycosylation patterns.<br>
In some embodiments, the invention provides use of such a  plant-derived glycoprotein or functional fragment thereof as described herein for the production of a pharmaceutical composition, for example for the treatment of a patient with an antibody, a hormone, a cytokine, a vaccine antigen, an enzyme, or the like. Such a pharmaceutical composition comprising a glycoprotein or functional fragment thereof is also provided.<br>
 plant Transformation<br>
Expression of proteins, such as for example non-mammalian enzymes providing N-glycan biosynthesis, as well as glycoproteins, such as antibodies, cytokines, vaccines, hormones and the like, can be performed by using methods known in the art. For example, by stable expression via Agrobacterium-mtdiated transformation, electroporation or particle bombardment, or by transient expression using viral vectors such as PVX, for example, or agrofiltration, or other method known in the art. The glycosyltransferases of the invention, capable of glycan biosynthesis, and/or the glycoprotein which undergoes glycosylation may be expressed under control of a specific promoter to facilitate expression in certain tissues or organs. A DNA sequence coding for the desired polypeptide of the non-mammalian glycosyltransferase and/or glycoproteins described herein, for example a cDNA or a genomic sequence encoding a full length protein, may be used to construct a recombinant expression cassette which can be introduced into the desired  plant.<br>
Isolated nucleic acids as described herein, e.g. comprising sequences such as SEQ ID NOs: 1, 8, 10, 13,15 and 17, can be introduced into  plants according to techniques known in the art. Generally, recombinant expression cassettes as described above and suitable for transformation of  plant cells are prepared. The isolated nucleic acids described herein can then be used for transformation. In this manner, genetically modified  plants,  plant cells,  plant tissue, seed, and the like can be obtained.<br>
Transformation protocols may vary depending on the type of  plant cell, i.e., monocot or dicot, targeted for transformation. Suitable methods of transforming  plant<br><br>
cells include microinjection (Crossway et al. (1986) Biotechniques 4: 320-334), electroporation (Riggs et al (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 5602-5606), Agrobacterium mediated transformation (see for example, Zhao et al. U. S. Patent 5,981,840; Hinchee et al. (1988) Biotechnology 6: 915-921), direct gene transfer (Paszkowski et al (1984) EMBO J. 3: 27172722), and ballistic particle acceleration (see, for example, Sanford et al. U. S. Patent 4,945,050; Tomes et al. "Direct DNA Transfer into Intact  plant Cells via Microprojectile Bombardment" In Gamborg and Phillips (Eds.)  plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture: Fundamental Methods, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1995); and McCabe et al. (1988) Biotechnology 6: 923-926).<br>
The cells which have been transformed may be grown into  plants in accordance with conventional methods. See, for example, McCormick et al. (1986)  plant Cell Reports, 5: 81-84. These  plants may then be grown, and either pollinated with the same transformed strain or different strains, and the resulting hybrid having the desired phenotypic characteristic identified. Two or more generations may be grown to ensure that the subject phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and inherited and then seeds harvested to ensure the desired phenotype or other property has been achieved.<br>
Transgenic  plant Regeneration<br>
 plant cells transformed with a  plant expression vector can be regenerated, e.g., from single cells, callus tissue or leaf discs according to standard  plant tissue culture techniques. It is well known in the art that various cells, tissues, and organs from almost any  plant can be successfully cultured to regenerate an entire  plant.  plant regeneration from cultured Protoplasts is described in Evans et al.. Protoplasts Isolation and Culture, Handbook of  plant Cell Culture, Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, pp. 124 176 (1983); and Binding, Regeneration of  plants,  plant Protoplasts, CRC Press, Boca Raton, pp. 21-73 (1985).<br>
The regeneration of  plants containing the foreign gene introduced by Agrobacterium from leaf ex plants can be achieved as described by Horsch et al.. Science, 227: 1229-1231 (1985). In this procedure, transformants are grown in the presence of a selection agent and in a medium that induces the regeneration of shoots in the  plant species being transformed as described by Fraley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.), 80: 4803 (1983). This procedure typically produces shoots within two to four weeks and these<br><br>
transformant shoots are then transferred to an appropriate root-inducing medium containing the selective agent and an antibiotic to prevent bacterial growth. Transgenic  plants of the present invention may be fertile or sterile.<br>
Regeneration can also be obtained from  plant callus, ex plants, organs, or parts thereof Such regeneration techniques are described generally in Klee et al., Annu Rev  plant Phys. 38: 467-486 (1987). The regeneration of  plants from either single  plant Protoplasts or various ex plants is well known in the art. See, for example, Methods for  plant Molecular Biology, A. Weissbach and H. Weissbach, eds., Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif. (1988). This regeneration and growth process includes the steps of selection of transformant cells and shoots, rooting the transformant shoots and growth of the  plantlets in soil. For maize cell culture and regeneration see generally. The Maize Handbook, Freeling and Walbot, Eds., Springer, New York (1994); Corn and Corn Improvement, 3rd edition, Sprague and Dudley Eds., American Society of Agronomy, Madison, Wisconsin (1988).<br>
One of skill will recognize that after the recombinant expression cassette is stably incorporated in transgenic  plants and confirmed to be operable, it can be introduced into other  plants by sexual crossing. Any of a number of standard breeding techniques can be used, depending upon the species to be crossed. In vegetatively propagated crops, mature transgenic  plants can be propagated by the taking of cuttings or by tissue culture techniques to produce multi β1 e identical  plants.<br>
Selection of desirable transgenics is made and new varieties are obtained and preferably propagated vegetatively for commercial use. In seed propagated crops, mature transgenic  plants can be self crossed to produce a homozygous inbred  plant. The inbred  plant produces seed containing the newly introduced heterologous nucleic acid. These seeds can be grown to produce  plants that would produce the selected phenotype.<br>
. Parts obtained from the regenerated  plant, such as flowers, seeds, leaves, branches, fruit, and the like are included in the invention, provided that these parts comprise cells comprising the isolated nucleic acids described herein. Progeny and variants, and mutants of the regenerated  plants are also included within the scope of the Invention, provided that these parts comprise the introduced nucleic acid sequences.<br>
Transgenic  plants expressing the selectable marker can be screened for transmission of the nucleic acids described herein by, for example, standard immunoblot<br><br>
and DNA detection techniques. Transgenic lines are also typically evaluated on levels of expression of the heterologous nucleic acid. Expression at the RNA level can be determined initially to identify and quantitate expression-positive  plants. Standard techniques for RNA analysis can be employed and include PCR amplification assays using oligonucleotide primers designed to am β1 ify only the heterologous RNA templates and solution hybridization assays using heterologous nucleic acid-specific probes. The RNA positive  plants can then be analyzed for protein expression by Western immunoblot analysis using the specifically reactive antibodies provided herein. In addition, in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry according to standard protocols can be performed using heterologous nucleic acid specific polynucleotide probes and antibodies, respectively, to localize sites of expression within transgenic tissue. Generally, a number of transgenic lines are screened for the incorporated nucleic acid to identify and select  plants with the most appropriate expression profiles.<br>
In certain embodiments a transgenic  plant is provided that is homozygous for the added heterologous nucleic acid; i.e., a transgenic  plant that contains two added nucleic acid sequences, one gene at the same locus on each chromosome of a chromosome pair. A homozygous transgenic  plant can be obtained by sexually mating (selfing) a heterozygous transgenic  plant that contains a single added heterologous nucleic acid, germinating some of the seed produced and analyzing the resulting  plants produced for altered expression of a polynucleotide described herein relative to a control  plant (i.e., native, non-transgenic). Back-crossing to a parental  plant and out-crossing with a non-transgenic  plant are also contem β1 ated.<br>
In certain embodiments a process for the production of a transgenic  plant or a transgenic  plant cell is provided comprising (a) insertion of a DNA into the genome of a  plant or a  plant cell, said DNA comprising a nucleic acid sequence which encodes a non-mammalian  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferase, optionally extended with a mammalian N-terminal sequence, as described herein, or encoding said GalT in which its CTS has been replaced with that of another Golgi-localized protein, as described herein, or enzymatically active derivatives or parts thereof, and preferably in addition at least one mammalian protein requiring galactosylation of its A'-linked glycan which DNA additionally encodes at least one selection marker expressible in said  plant or said  plant cell, (b) selection of transgenic  plants or  plant cells which have taken up said DNA according to (a); and (c) culturing of<br><br>
the desired transgenic  plant or the desired transgenic  plant cell in a suitable culture medium. The skilled person will understand that term "a protein comprising a galactosylated A^-linked glycan" in relation to a nucleic acid molecule encoding said protein merely encodes the polypeptide, whereas the galactosylated A^-1 inked glycan is a result of processing of the protein in the Golgi.<br>
In some embodiments additional methods are provided for producing a transgenic  plant that expresses a recombinant GalT protein and a protein comprising a galactosylated //-linked glycan. Such methods may for instance comprise crossing a transgenic  plant described herein with another  plant, harvesting progeny from said crossing and selecting a desired progeny  plant expressing the recombinant GalT protein and expressing a recombinant mammalian glycoprotein, in particular a protein comprising a galactosylated N-glycan, or functional fragment thereof<br>
Purification of Proteins<br>
In certain embodiments methods for obtaining a desired glycoprotein or functional fragment thereof comprise cultivating a  plant described herein until said  plant has reached a harvestable stage, harvesting and fractionating the  plant to obtain fractionated  plant material and at least partly isolating said glycoprotein from said fractionated  plant material. In certain embodiment methods for obtaining a desired glycoprotein or functional fragment thereof comprise growing  plant cells in cell culture in a fermentor until said cell culture has reached a harvestable stage or the desired glycoprotein can be collected from the medium. The glycoproteins described herein, such as e.g., antibodies, vaccines, cytokines and hormones, may be purified by standard techniques well known to those of skill in the art. Such recombinantly produced proteins may be directly expressed or expressed as a fusion protein. The recombinant protein is purified by a combination of cell lysis (e.g., sonication, French press) and affinity chromatography or other affinity-based method. For fusion products, subsequent digestion of the fusion protein with an appropriate proteolytic enzyme releases the desired recombinant protein.<br>
The proteins described herein, recombinant or synthetic, may be purified to substantial purity by standard techniques well known in the art, including detergent solubilization, selective precipitation with such substances as ammonium sulfate, column chromatography, immunopurification methods, and others. See, for instance, R. Scopes,<br><br>
Protein Purification: Princi β1 es and Practice, Springer-Verlag: New York (1982) ; Deutsciier, Guide to Protein Purification, Academic Press (1990). For example, antibodies may be raised to the proteins as described herein. Purification from E. coli can be achieved following procedures described in U. S. Patent No. 4,511,503. The protein may then be isolated from cells expressing the protein and further purified by standard protein chemistry techniques as described herein. Detection of the expressed protein is achieved by methods known in the art and include, for example, radioimmunoassays. Western blotting techniques or immunoprecipitation.<br>

Identification of putative non-mammalian  β1 ,4 GalTs<br>
The family of  β-1 ,4-galactosyltransferases (GalT) comprises at least seven members, of which several have been cloned but only very few have been characterized. The  β-1 ,4-gaIactosyltransferases of human and bovine origin have been best characterized and were shown to be able to add a galactose residue in |3-l,4-linkage to terminal GlcNAc residue on an N-glycan. Putative GalT genes involved in N-glycosylation were identified among non-mammalian species gene sequences based on homology. Figure 1 shows a Clustal W alignment of mammalian GalT gene sequences (human, mouse and bovine) and non-mammalian putative GalT gene sequences (chicken, zebrafish and frog). Remarkably, the mammalian amino terminus (boxed, solid lines), which is cytosolic and adjacent to the transmembrane region (TM, boxed, dashed lines) and which putatively is involved in Golgi-localization is not conserved in GalT orthologs from non-mammalian origin, such as, for example, chicken and zebrafish (see Figure 1).<br>
Golgi-localization is thought to be important for GalT activity, which can be 'late' (probably trans-Golgi), meaning GalT catalytic activity occurs after the actions of other glycosyltransferases, such as, for example Man-1, GnT-I, Man-II, GnT-II, XylT and FucT in the  plant, producing bi-antennary N-glycans, or GalT catalytic activity occurs 'early' (cis/medial-Golgi) that is before the activity of Man-II, XylT and FucT, thereby preventing the activity of these enzymes, producing in a  plant hybrid-type N-glycans that lack fucose and xylose.<br><br>
Non-mammalian GalT orthologs, for example derived from chicken and zebrafish, have not previously been characterized for their ability to add a galactose residue in P-1,4-linkage to terminal GlcNAc residue on an N-glycan, particularly not when expressed exogenously in  plants. The influence of different mammalian amino termini, which may influence intracellular localization, on the production of bi-antennary or hybrid-type N-glycans and the effects on adding  plant-specific fucose and xylose residues to N-glycans when expressed fused to a non-mammalian GalT ortholog in a  plant has also not been investigated.<br>
Three GalT constructs for each chicken and zebrafish were cloned and tested for N-glycosylation activity: a) wild-type, non-mammalian chicken and zebrafish  β-1 ,4-GalTl; b) fusion proteins of the 13 amino acid conserved mammalian (human) amino terminus (see Figure 1) extension to non-mammalian chicken and zebrafish  β-1 ,4-GalTl; and c) fusion proteins of the mammalian cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain (GTS) derived from rat sialyltransferase gene to non-mammalian chicken and zebrafish  β-1 ,4-GalTl, re β1 acing the amino terminus of chicken and zebrafish  β-1 ,4-GalTl with the CTS of rat sialyltransferase (see examples 2 and 3).<br>

Cloning and expression of genes encoding the full-length chicken Bl,4-GalTl enzyme<br>
and variants thereof.<br>
Putative chicken Bl,4-GalTl (GGal; GenBank accession U19890; SEQ Ggal, SEQ ID N0:2) has been cloned earlier, although it was not shown to be capable of galactosylating N-glycans (Shaper et al, J Biol Chem 111, 31389-31399, 1997). In our lab, the cDNA fragment comprising residues 114 to 362 (SEQ GgGall 14-362, SEQ ID N0:3) has been am β1 ified from chicken s β1 een total RNA using RT-PCR with primers GgalLEEVAST and GgGaldw (see Table 1). The resulting fragment containing the C-terminus was digested with J^o I and Bam HI and then cloned into  β1 asmid pCASeco, the latter being a pUC19 derivative in which the Hin dlll and Eco RI sites flanking the multi β1 e cloning site have been used to insert the sequence SEQ CASeco at the same time removing these two sites and the Eco 311-site in the backbone. This  β1 asmid pCASeco was digested with Xho I and Bam HI to accommodate the C-terminal GGal fragment yielding clone GgGalC.<br><br>
The cDNA fragment containing the N-terminus of the GGai and comprising residues 1 to 113 was produced synthetically using PCR-based methods from long oligos. The GC-rich nature of the natural cDNA fragment hampered straightforward RT-PCR cloning and a codon optimized version of this fragment (SEQ GgGalsyn, SEQ ID N0:6) without amino acid alterations compared to the wild-type sequence was combined with clone GgGalC encoding SEQ GgGall 14-362 in such a way as to create a gene (SEQ GgGalhybr, SEQ ID N0:1) encoding the wild-type GGal amino acid sequence (SEQ Ggal, SEQ ID N0:2). The gene as described under SEQ GgGalhybr was then used as starting material to create two variants, one in which its N-terminus is extended with a sequence encoding the 13 amino acid residues of the full-length human 61,4-GalTl (GenBank accession NM_001497) and another in which the fragment encoding residues 40 to 362 comprising the catalytic domain of the GGal is fused to the C-terminus of the rat a2,6-sialyltransferase (SialT; GenBank accession Ml8769) N-terminal domain comprising residues 1 to 53, thus including the cytosolic tail, the transmembrane domain and a part of the stem region. The rat SialT-derived sequence contains one silent mutation with regard to the wild-type sequence.<br>
The GGal with 13 amino acid N-terminal extension was made from the hybrid clone encoding GGal (SEQ GgGalhybr, SEQ ID N0:1) using PCR with oligo HsGgGalstart and Ml 3 forward primer (Table 1). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with Bpi I and Xbo I and cloned into likewise digested GGal clone. The resulting clone contains a gene with SEQ HsGGal (SEQ ID N0:8).<br>
The variant with a rat SialT N-terminal domain was made from the clone encoding the com β1 ete GGal (SEQ GgGalhybr, SEQ ID N0:1) using PCR with oligos GgGall42 and Ml3 forward primer (Table 1). The resulting fragment was digested with Eco 311 and Bam HI and cloned into pCASeco  plasmid containing the rat sequence digested with Nco I and Bam HI. The resulting clone contains a gene with SEQ sialGGal (SEQ ID NO: 10).<br>
 plant transformation vectors containing the three different GGal genes were made by first cloning the genes digested with Eco 311 and Bam HI into vector pRAP40 digested with Nco I and Bam HI causing the genes to be downstream of the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter and the AMV translational enhancer. pRAP40is a pUC19 derivative containing the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter and the nos terminator flanked upstream of the<br><br>
promoter by the Asc I site and downstream of the terminator by the Pac I site; the entire cassette including the flanking restriction sites is described under SEQ RAP40 (SEQ ID NO: 12). Each of the three cassettes comprising the promoter, one of the three genes and the terminator was then transferred separately to a modified version of binary vector pMOG22 in which the Eco RI and Hin dlll sites of the multiple cloning site have been replaced by Pac I and Asc I, respectively (Goddijn et al., 1993,  plant J 4:863-873). To this end, the pRAP-derived clones were digested with Pac I and Asc 1 and then cloned into Asc-Pac digested binary vector giving three different vectors ready for  plant transformation. After Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Nicotiana tabacum, transgenic  plants expressing the GGal or its variants were selected by analyzing the N-glycans synthesized by the transformants using methods as described previously by Bakker et al., (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 98:2899-904, 2001 and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 103:7577-82, 2006), for example.<br>
Results from MALDI-TOF analyses, see Figure 2 and summarized in Figure 4, right column and Table 3, of N-glycans purified from transgenic  plants expressing the chicken gene show that only the chicken gene sequence with either 13 amino acid extension (HsGGal, SEQ ID N0:8) or SialT-CTS (sialGGal, SEQ ID NO: 10) expression results in production of full bi-antennary N-glycans with galactose residues. Expression of wild-type chicken GalT gene results in hybrid type N-glycans only. Both 13 amino acid extension (HsGGal, SEQ ID N0:8) or SialT-CTS (sialGGal, SEQ ID NO: 10) chicken GalT's also have some hybrid type galactosylated N-glycans.<br>
Remarkably, expression of the three different GGal genes results in the almost com β1 ete lack of bi-antennary N-glycans ending in two GlcNAc residues (see Table 3 and Figure 4, upper panel, right column), instead hybrid-type galactosylated N-glycans with one galactose and lacking both xylose and fucose are predominant, especially for expression of wild-type chicken GalT (see Figure 4, middle panel, right column). This pattern of N-glycan production is markedly different from that obtained from  plants transformed with either human GalT or GalT from zebrafish (see Table 3 and Figure 4, left and middle column, respectively, and see below).<br>
A reduction in  plant-specific xylose and fucose residues, or the com β1 ete lack thereof, such as it is seen in the hybrid-type galactosylated N-glycans when wild-type chicken GalT is expressed in  plants, is desirable when producing, for example, exogenous therapeutic<br><br>
glycoproteins, since pi,2-xylose and  β1 ,3-fucose residues are not attached to glycoproteins of mammals and act as an allergen.<br>
example 3:<br>
Cloning and expression of genes encoding the full-lengtli zebrafish Bl,4-GalTl<br>
enzyme and variants thereof.<br>
A putative zebrafish B1,4-GalTl (Machingo et al, Dev Biol 297,471-82, 2006; NM_001017730) has been identified, but its function has not been proven and the inventors believe the identification to be incorrect. Starting from whole zebrafish total RNA, a full-length DGal gene (SEQ Dgal, SEQ ID NO: 13) has been am β1 ified using RT-PCR with primers DrGalup and DrGaldw (see Table 2). The resulting fragment was digested with Xba I and Bam HI and then cloned into likewise digested  plasmid pCASeco (see above). Sequencing showed that it was virtually identical to unidentified Genbank accession NM_001077259, albeit with three mutations as shown here (start at +1 and non-silent mutations underlined): T126C, T230G. G862C. Amino acid sequence comparison of Dgal (SEQ Dgal, SEQ ID NO: 14) with putative zebrafish Bl,4-GalTl as published (Machingo et al., Dev Biol 297,471-82, 2006; NM_001017730) showed that there was little sequence homology at the amino acid level, especially at the N-terminus that is supposedly involved in Golgi-localization, and C-terminus where our clone is significantly longer (see Figure 5).<br>
The DGal with 13 amino acid N-terminal extension was made from the clone encoding DGal (SEQ Dgal, SEQ ID NO: 13) using PCR with oligos HsDrup and DrGaldw (Table 2). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with Ace I and Bpi I and cloned into likewise digested DGal clone. The resulting clone contains a gene with SEQ HsDGal (SEQ ID NO: 15).<br>
The variant with a rat SialT N-terminal domain was made from the clone encoding the com β1 ete DGal (SEQ Dgal, SEQ ID NO: 13) using PCR with oligos DrGall60 and DrGaldw (Table 2). The resulting fragment was digested with Bpi I and Bam HI and cloned into pCASeco  plasmid containing the rat sequence digested with Ncol and Bam HI. The resulting clone contains the DGal catalytic domain fused to the N-terminus of the rat SialT gene (SEQ sialDGal, SEQ ID NO: 17).<br><br>
 plant transformation vectors containing the three different DGal genes were made by first cloning the genes digested with Eco 311 and Bam HI into vector pRAP40 digested with Nco I and Bam HI causing the genes to be downstream of the enhanced CaMV 35 S promoter. Each of the three cassettes comprising the promoter, one of the three genes and the terminator were then transferred separately to a modified version of binary vector pMOG22 in which the Eco RI and Hin dlll sites of the multiple cloning site have been replaced by Pac I and Asc I, respectively (Goddijn et al., 1993,  plant J 4:863-873). To this end, the pRAP-derived clones was digested with Pac I and Asc I and then cloned into Asc-Pac digested binary vector giving three different vectors ready for  plant transformation. After Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Nicotiana tabacum, transgenic  plants expressing the DGal or its variants were selected by analyzing the N-glycans synthesized by the transformants using methods as described previously by Bakker et al., (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 98:2899-904, 2001 and Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:7577-82,2006), for example.<br>
Results from MALDI-TOF analyses, see Figure 3 and summarized in Figure 4, middle column and Table 3, of N-glycans purified from transgenic  plants expressing the zebrafish GalT gene sequences show that expression of wild-type zebrafish GalT gene sequence results in some hybrid type galactosylated N-glycans but also fully bi-antennary N-glycans with two galactoses. Depending on the  plant some  plants only have galactosylated bi-antennary N-glycans upon expression of zebrafish wild-type GalT gene sequence (see Figure 3, uppermost versus 2"*^ from top panel). The amount of double galactosylated bi-antennary N-glycans can be significantly increased by either the 13 aminoacid N-terminus human GalT (HsDGal, SEQ ID NO: 15) or SialT-CTS-GalT (sialDGal, SEQ ID NO: 17), with the latter having highest amount of galactosylated bi-antennary N-glycans (see Table 3 and Figure 4, bottom panel, middle column).<br>
Remarkably, galactosylation of double-galactosylated bi-antennary N-glycans obtained through the expression of Sial-CTS-zebrafish GalT in tobacco is 50% increased in SialT-CTS-zebrafish GalT compared to SialT-CTS-human GalT (see Table 3 and Figure 4, bottom panel, middle column and left column, respectively). The Sial-CTS-zebrafish GalT produces up to 45% of total N-glycans that have one or more galactose residues (see Table 3).<br><br>
A high yield in total N-glycans that have one or more galactose residues such as it is seen in the bi-antennary N-glycans when Sial-CTS-zebrafish GalT is expressed in  plants, is desirable when producing, for example, exogenous therapeutic glycoproteins.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
