				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to electronic devices having factory<br>
default settings and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for automatically<br>
detecting and indicating a mis-configuration condition in an electronic device having<br>
one or more factory-default settings.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many electronic devices such as communication and/or multimedia devices<br>
are pre-configured with factory set defaults. Such devices include, but are not limited<br>
to, network equipment such as routers, Access Points (including Wireless Access<br>
Points (WAPs)), and so forth. For example, a WAP is set to have a default channel,<br>
a default network name and a default encryption setting.<br>
These default settings allow the device to be functioning in at least a basic mode. In<br>
many cases, the user of the device does not bother to change these default values.<br>
This can be acceptable in some cases relating to certain types of devices (e.g.,<br>
televisions), but for some other devices like APs, this is not acceptable. In many<br>
APs, security is disabled by default. If the user does not configure the AP to enable<br>
security, all the data is sent unencrypted. As a result, any malicious user can snoop<br>
the data. In a corporate environment, this problem is even more acute because<br>
confidential data can be involved. Moreover, if multiple APs are located in<br>
geographically close locations, they can interfere with each other if the default<br>
channel setting is not changed. Thus, some of the parameters of these devices are<br>
critical and should be changed by the user/administrator. However, although most of<br>
the devices come with factory defaults, none of these devices provide a mechanism<br>
to alert the user/administrator that the default settings are in use and can be<br>
potentially risky to employ.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable and highly advantageous to have an<br>
apparatus and/or method that overcome the above-identified deficiencies of the prior<br>
art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The problems stated above, as well as other related problems of the prior art,<br>
are solved by the present invention, which is directed to an apparatus and method for<br>
automatically detecting and indicating a mis-configuration condition in an electronic<br>
device having one or more factory-default settings.<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus and method that detect if an<br>
electronic device is configured with factory default settings and to provide an<br>
indication of the same, if the device is so configured. The indication can be provided,<br>
for example, using a visual indication including, but not limited to, changing a visible<br>
color, sending a message to a management/administrative entity via email,<br>
employing cellular text messaging service, and so forth. It is to be appreciated that<br>
the present invention can be implemented to automatically detect any kind of misconfiguration<br>
and alert a user/administrator about the same.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
automatically detecting and indicating a mis-configuration condition in an electronic<br>
device having one or more factory-default settings. At least one mis-configuration<br>
rule is received that relates to at least one mis-configuration condition of the<br>
electronic device. The at least one mis-configuration rule is checked against at least<br>
one corresponding current configuration setting to determine whether the electronic<br>
device is mis-configured. A mis-configuration alert is provided with respect to the<br>
electronic device, when the electronic device is determined to be mis-configured in<br>
said checking step.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
apparatus for automatically detecting and indicating a mis-configuration condition in<br>
an electronic device having one or more factory-default settings. A memory device<br>
stores at least one mis-configuration rule and at least one corresponding current<br>
configuration setting, the at least one mis-configuration rule relating to at least one<br>
mis-configuration condition of the electronic device. Rule checking circuitry checks<br>
the at least one mis-configuration rule against the at least one corresponding current<br>
configuration setting to determine whether the electronic device is mis-configured. A<br>
mis-configuration indicator provides a mis-configuration alert when the electronic<br>
device is determined to be mis-configured by the rule checking circuitry.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method for automatically detecting and indicating a mis-configuration condition in an<br>
electronic device having one or more factory-default settings. At least one misconfiguration<br>
rule is received that relates to a security feature of the electronic device.<br>
The at least one mis-configuration rule is checked against at least one corresponding<br>
current configuration setting to determine whether the security feature is one of<br>
disabled and at a default setting. A mis-configuration alert is provided with respect to<br>
the electronic device, when the security feature is determined to be one of disabled<br>
and at the default setting in said checking step.<br>
These and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments,<br>
which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

detecting and indicating a mis-configuration condition in an electronic device 199<br>
having one or more factory-default settings, according to an illustrative embodiment<br>
of the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for automatically detecting and<br>

invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus and method for automatically<br>
detecting and indicating a mis-configuration condition in an electronic device having<br>
one or more factory-default settings.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention can be implemented in various<br>
forms of hardware, software, firmware, special purpose processors, or a combination<br>
thereof. Preferably, the present invention is implemented as a combination of<br>
hardware and software. Moreover, the software is preferably implemented as an<br>
application program tangibly embodied on a program storage device. The application<br>
program can be uploaded to, and executed by, a machine comprising any suitable<br>
architecture. Preferably, the machine is implemented on a computer platform having<br>
hardware such as one or more central processing units (CPU), a random access<br>
memory (RAM), and input/output (I/O) interface(s). The computer platform also<br>
includes an operating system and microinstruction code. The various processes and<br>
functions described herein can either be part of the microinstruction code or part of<br>
the application program (or a combination thereof) that is executed via the operating<br>
system. In addition, various other peripheral devices can be connected to the<br>
computer platform such as an additional data storage device and a printing device.<br>
It is to be further understood that, because some of the constituent system<br>
components and method steps depicted in the accompanying Figures are preferably<br>
implemented in software, the actual connections between the system components (or<br>
the process steps) can differ depending upon the manner in which the present<br>
invention is programmed. Given the teachings herein, one of ordinary skill in the<br>
related art will be able to contemplate these and similar implementations or<br>
configurations of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus 100 for automatically<br>
detecting and indicating a mis-configuration condition in an electronic device 199<br>
having one or more factory-default settings, according to an illustrative embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The apparatus 100 includes a user/administrator interface (hereinafter<br>
"interface") 105, a memory device 110, a processor 120, a mis-configuration indicator<br>
130, and a communication device 140, all interconnected via a bus 150.<br>
The bus 150, in addition to interconnecting the preceding elements, also serves as an<br>
interface to the electronic device 199 and to other external components (not shown).<br>
The interface 105 is for inputting information into the apparatus 100. Such<br>
information can include, but is not limited to, one or more mis-configuration rules.<br>
The mis-configuration rules specify one or more mis-configuration conditions of the<br>
electronic device 199.<br>
The memory device 110 is preferably a non-volatile memory device. The<br>
memory device 110 preferably includes a default area 110A and a user area 110B.<br>
The default area 110A of the non-volatile memory 110 stores the factory default<br>
settings. If necessary or desired, a user or an administrator (hereinafter collectively<br>
referred to as "administrator") 188 can always re-apply one or more of the factorydefault<br>
settings to the electronic device 199. For example, the factory default settings<br>
can be re-applied to the electronic device 199 through some mechanism such as, but<br>
not limited to, pressing a "restore" button. Examples of some factory-default settings,<br>
for example, for a wireless AP, include, but are not limited to:<br>
Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID) : "linksys"<br>
Security : OFF<br>
Encryption Key : None<br>
Channel : 3<br>
Default Admin Password : Admin<br>
Typically and preferably, the default area 110A cannot be overwritten by the<br>
administrator 188. This allows the electronic device 199 to be reset to factorysettings<br>
even if the administrator 188 mis-configured the electronic device 199.<br>
The user area 110B is accessible for writing thereto. The administrator 188<br>
can choose his/her own values for various settings/parameters. For example, for a<br>
wireless AP, some of these parameters could be set as follows:<br>
Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID): "cafetriaOl"<br>
Security : ON<br>
Encryption Key : alf!G<br>
Channel : 6<br>
Default Admin Password : ap@12pOdwCCv<br>
The processor 120 performs functions as specified herein. Such functions<br>
include, but are not limited to, checking mis-configuration rules stored in the memory<br>
device 110 against corresponding current configuration settings to determine whether<br>
the electronic device is mis-configured. As noted above, the mis-configuration rules<br>
specify one or more mis-configuration conditions of the electronic device 199.<br>
It is to be appreciated that while the apparatus 100 is described to include a<br>
processor 120, other circuitry such as comparators, logic gates, Application Specific<br>
Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Programmable Logic Arrays (PLAs), and so forth can be<br>
employed to perform the method steps described herein. The processor 120 and the<br>
other circuitry can also be interchangeably referred to herein as "rule checking<br>
.circuitry".<br>
The mis-configuration indicator 140 provides an indication to the administrator<br>
188 that the electronic device is mis-configured. The indication can be provided<br>
visually, audibly, or using any other methodology or structure to provide such<br>
indication. For example, one or more speakers, Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) or<br>
other visual indicators can be employed, while maintaining the spirit of the present<br>
invention. Of course, the present invention is not limited to the preceding types of<br>
indicators and, thus, other types of indicators can also be employed while maintaining<br>
the spirit of the present invention. It is to be appreciated that while the misconfiguration<br>
indicator 140 is shown in FIG. 1 as being located proximate to the<br>
administrator, the same indicator 140 or another similar indicator can be located at a<br>
location remote from the apparatus 100 or the electronic device 199 in the case when<br>
the administrator is located remote from the apparatus 10 or the electronic device<br>
199. In this way, even if the administrator is away from the electronic device 199<br>
and, thus, cannot remedy the situation locally (i.e., correctly configure the electronic<br>
device 199), then perhaps the administrator can contact someone who is proximate<br>
to the electronic device (but is unaware of the indication) in order to expediently<br>
remedy the situation before an undesirable condition occurs (i.e., theft or snooping of<br>
data). In such a case, the communication device 130 would be employed to<br>
communicate the indication to the administrator 188.<br>
The communication device 130 allows for communication between the<br>
electronic device 199 and the administrator 188 who can configure the electronic<br>
device 199 correctly. Accordingly, if the administrator 188 is in a location remote<br>
from the apparatus 100 and the electronic device 199, the administrator 188 can still<br>
nonetheless receive an indication that the electronic device 199 is mis-configured.<br>
The communication device 130 can be, for example, but is not limited to a modem, a<br>
transmitter, and so forth. In this way, for example, the modem can be used to dial a<br>
telephone, beeper, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and/or other device (collectively<br>
referred to as "mis-configuration alert remote receiving device" 187) that is local to<br>
the administrator 188.<br>
Moreover, it is to be appreciated that while the apparatus 100 is described as<br>
including the preceding-identified elements, one or more of such elements can<br>
already be included in the electronic device and, thus, can be utilized as described<br>
herein in accordance with the present invention to avoid duplicity of parts while<br>
maintaining the spirit of the present invention.<br>
Additionally, it is to be appreciated that while the apparatus 100 is shown as being<br>
within electronic device 199, the entire apparatus 100 or any parts thereof can be<br>
located external to the electronic device 199, while maintaining the spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Further, it is to be appreciated that, given the teachings of the present<br>
invention provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the related art will contemplate<br>
these and various other elements for performing the steps described herein, while<br>
maintaining the spirit of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for automatically detecting and<br>
indicating a mis-configuration condition in an electronic device 199 having one or<br>
more factory-default settings, according to an illustrative embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The apparatus 100 shown in FIG. 1 implements the method of FIG.<br>
At least one rule (hereinafter "rules") for determining whether or not the<br>
electronic device 199 is mis-configured is received, for example, via the interface 105<br>
(step 205). It is to be appreciated that the rules can also be received from a remote<br>
location via the communication device 130. The rules can also be pre-loaded upon<br>
construction of the electronic device 199. It is to be further appreciated that the rules<br>
can be set statically or can be dynamically configured by the administrator 188 via,<br>
for example, the interface 105 and/or the communication device 130. The rules can<br>
be complex and specific, for example, particularly describing the preferred settings.<br>
Alternatively, the rules can be simple and can simply determine whether some or all<br>
of the currently set parameters/settings are the same as the corresponding factory<br>
default settings (particularly security related settings).<br>
At a random or pre-determined time or with respect to some event (e.g., the<br>
device is powered on, etc.), the rules are checked against the current configuration to<br>
determine whether or not any of the rules have been violated (i.e., to determine<br>
whether the electronic device 199 is mis-configured as specified in the rules) (step<br>
210). In one embodiment of the present invention, wherein the rule is that "the<br>
configuration in use should not be exactly the same as the default factory setting", the,<br>
apparatus 100 compares one or more factory-default settings to one or more<br>
corresponding current configuration settings to determine if there is a match (step<br>
21 Oa). The actual settings that are compared can include "critical settings" in that<br>
their mis-configuration can pose security or other undesirable risks to the device and<br>
the information communicated therewith.<br>
it is to be appreciated that, in addition to or in place of having step 210<br>
automatically performed to determine whether the electronic device 199 is misconfigured,<br>
the administrator 188 can query the electronic device 199 to determine<br>
whether or not the electronic device 199 is mis-configured (e.g., configured with one<br>
or more factory default settings). In such a case, a user and/or administrator<br>
generated query is received regarding whether the electronic device 199 is misconfigured<br>
(step 208). In such a case, a mechanism (such as, e.g., interface 105) for<br>
performing the query of step 208 can be provided on the apparatus 100 and/or the<br>
electronic device 199. For example, in the case of a wireless AP, an SNMP (Simple<br>
Network Management Protocol) Interface can be provided on the apparatus 100<br>
and/or the electronic device 199 to perform the query.<br>
If, in fact, one or more of the rules are violated, then the apparatus 100 alerts<br>
the administrator 188 via the mis-configuration alert indicator 130 (step 220). For<br>
example, in the case of the rule specified above with respect to step 21 Oa, if the one<br>
or more factory-default settings are the same as the one or more corresponding<br>
current configuration settings, then the apparatus 100 alerts the administrator 188 via<br>
mis-configuration alert indicator 130. It is to be appreciated that the way in which the<br>
administrator 188 is alerted is not critical to the present invention and, thus, any<br>
approach and/or device for providing the alert can be employed while maintaining the<br>
spirit of the present invention. For example, the alert can be provided, but is not<br>
limited to, the following: (a) a visual method/device (flashing LED); (b) an audio<br>
method/device (series of beeps); (c) an alert message (e.g., Simple Network<br>
Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) trap to management console, Short Message Service<br>
(SMS) message); and so forth.<br>
It is to be appreciated that the mis-configuration alert can be provided to the<br>
administrator at a remote location with respect to the electronic device 199 via the<br>
communication device 130 (step 230).<br>
A description will now be given further regarding mis-configuration detection<br>
apd alerting, according to another embodiment of the present invention. It is to be<br>
appreciated that any kind of rules that govern the proper configuration of a device can<br>
be employed in accordance with the present invention. As noted above, such rules<br>
can either be statically configured, or can be dynamically changed by the<br>
administrator. Moreover, as noted above, the apparatus 100 monitors the<br>
configuration of the electronic device 199 and, upon detecting any violation of the<br>
rules, alerts the administrator. The default configuration detection is simply one<br>
possible rule example that can be employed in accordance with the present<br>
invention. In the illustrative default configuration detection case, the rule is that "the<br>
configuration in use should not be exactly the same as the default factory setting".<br>
However, as noted above, it is to be appreciated that other useful rules can also be<br>
employed in accordance with the present invention, while maintaining the spirit of the<br>
present invention. Some other illustrative rules that can be employed include, but are<br>
\0<br>
not limited to the following described immediately herein after. For example, one<br>
such rule is that if encryption is not configured, then packet filtering must be set up.<br>
Another illustrative rule is that if neither encryption nor packet filtering are turned on,<br>
then the transmit power must be under 20mW. Yet another illustrative rule is that if<br>
the AP is configured as a router, then the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)<br>
interface and the Ethernet interface should not belong to the same sub network.<br>
It is to be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the specific<br>
rules and mis-configuration conditions described herein and, thus, other rules and<br>
mis-configuration conditions, as readily contemplated by one of ordinary skill in the<br>
related art, can also be employed with respect to the present invention while<br>
maintaining the spirit of the present invention.<br>
A description will now be given of violation detection, according to an<br>
illustrative embodiment of the present invention. It is to be appreciated that the<br>
detections of violation conditions can be carried out in a variety of ways. It is to be<br>
further appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the violation detection<br>
methodologies and steps described herein and, thus, other steps, as readily<br>
contemplated by one of ordinary skill in the related art, can also be employed in<br>
accordance with the present invention while maintaining the spirit of the present<br>
invention. The detection process can be started whenever the configuration is<br>
changed through the administration interface, or at any other time. For example, the<br>
detection process can be started whenever the device reboots, the detection process<br>
can be scheduled periodically; and/or can be started manually by the administrator.<br>
Although the illustrative embodiments have been described herein with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the present<br>
invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other changes<br>
and modifications can be affected therein by one of ordinary skill in the related art<br>
without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. All such changes and<br>
modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the invention as defined<br>
