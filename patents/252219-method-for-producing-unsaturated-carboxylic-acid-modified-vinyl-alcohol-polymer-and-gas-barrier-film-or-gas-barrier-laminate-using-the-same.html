3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing an unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b), and a gas barrier film using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to (1) a method for producing a solution containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) comprising reacting a vinyl alcohol polymer and an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound (a) in the presence of an acid catalyst soluble in the reaction system, removing at least the acid catalyst among acidic compounds with an anion exchange resin, and as necessary, neutralizing the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound (a) with a polyvalent metal compound; (2) a method for producing a solution containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) comprising reacting a vinyl alcohol polymer and an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound (a) in the presence of a solid acid catalyst, removing the solid acid catalyst by filtration and the like, and as necessary, removing the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound (a) with an anion exchange resin or neutralizing the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound (a) with a polyvalent metal compound; and, a gas barrier film using the same.<br>
A solution containing the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) obtained in methods (1) and (2) described above is useful as a gas barrier coating material, and a gas barrier film using this solution has high gas barrier properties.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Previously reported examples of methods for producing unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymers (b) consist mainly of [1] a method comprising reacting (meth)acrylic acid chloride and polyvinyl alcohol in an organic solvent (see Patent Document 1), and [2] a method comprising reacting (meth)acrylic acid anhydride and polyvinyl alcohol in an organic solvent (see Patent Document 2).<br>
2<br><br>
In the above-mentioned methods of [1] and [2], a chloride or anhydride of (meth)acrylic acid is used as an esterification agent to enhance the reactivity of polyvinyl alcohol. However, chlorides and anhydrides of (meth)acrylic acid are expensive and not readily available industrially. Moreover, since a reprecipitation procedure using an organic solvent as a poor solvent is carried out for purification, these production methods cannot be said to be industrially advantageous methods.<br>
Consequently, studies, although extremely few in number, have been conducted on the synthesis of unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymers using industrially inexpensive and readily available unsaturated carboxylic acids as raw materials, a known example of which consists of [3] a method comprising reacting (meth)acrylic acid with polyvinyl alcohol in aqueous hydrochloric acid (see Non-Patent Document 1). However, since the method of [3] uses dialysis for purification, it is not an industrially advantageous production method.<br>
In addition, in addition to the method of [3] above, another known method consists of [4] reacting polyvinyl alcohol, acetic acid and (meth)acrylic acid using hydrochloric acid as an acid catalyst (see Non-Patent Document 2). However, the method of [4] requires the addition of acetic acid, and the resulting modified vinyl alcohol polymer contains not only a (meth)acrylic acid of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound, but also an acetic acid of a saturated carboxylic acid compound. Moreover, since purification is carried out by a reprecipitation procedure using an organic solvent for the poor solvent, this is not an industrially advantageous production method.<br>
Accordingly, a sufficiently industrially advantageous method for producing unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymers has yet to be known.<br>
Moreover, a gas barrier film using an unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer obtained according to the methods described above is also not known.<br>

In addition, the solvent used in the case of diluting the reaction solution is preferably of the same type as the solvent or unsaturated carboxylic acid compound used in the reaction step. The amount of solvent used in the case of diluting the reaction solution is normally within the range of 0.01 to 5000 parts by weight and preferably within the range of 0.1 to 1000 parts by weight to 1 part by weight of the vinyl alcohol polymer.

The amount of anion exchange resin used is such that the volumetric capacity is within the range of 0.01 to 100 L and preferably within the range of 0.1 to 50 L based 1 mole of the acidic compound to be removed. One type of these anion-exchange resins may be used or two or more types may be used as a mixture.<br>
Form of Ion Exchange Step<br>

There are no particular limitations on the method used to carry out the neutralization reaction of the present invention, and the reaction may be carried out with a batch method or a continuous flow method.<br>
Following completion of the neutralization step, unreacted solid polyvalent metal compound can be removed by an ordinary solid-liquid separation method such as filtration or centrifugal separation depending on the case. At that time, a filtration assistant such as celite, activated charcoal or glass wool can be added as necessary.<br><br>
The solution obtained from the neutralization step of the present invention is the solution (D) containing the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) and the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c).<br>
18<br><br>
A gas barrier film can be produced from these solutions (A), (B) or (C) along with a solution comprised of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c). In addition, a gas barrier film can be produced from the solution (D) directly.<br>
In this case, a solution is preferably used in which the content of the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) in the solution is 50% by weight or less and the content of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) is 50% by weight or more.<br>
The resulting gas barrier film is a film having superior gas barrier properties in which the ratio (Ao/A) of absorbance Ao, based on a value of 0 for the vC of carboxylic acid groups in the vicinity of 1700 cm-1 in the infrared absorption spectrum thereof, to absorbance A, based on a value of 0 for the vC of carboxylate ions in the vicinity of 1520 cm4, is less than 0.25.<br>
The polyvalent metal of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt used is preferably at least one type selected from the group consisting of Mg, Ca, Zn, Baand Al.<br>
«Moreover, the present invention is a gas barrier laminate in which a gas barrier film is formed on at least one side of the base material layer (I).<br>
Gas Barrier Film<br>
The gas barrier film of the present invention is produced from the previously described solution (A), (B) or (C), comprised of the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) along with the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c), or the solution (D). In addition, the gas barrier film is produced from the previously described solution (D).<br>
19<br><br>
At that time, the ratio of the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) in the solution (A), (B) or (C) and the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) is such that the amount of the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) in the solution (A), (B) or (C) is preferably 50% by weight or less, more preferably within the range of 40 to 0.001% by weight and particularly preferably within the range of 30 to 0.01% by weight, and the amount of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) is preferably in excess of 50% by weight, more preferably in excess of 60% by weight, and particularly preferably within the range of 70 to 99.9% by weight (the combined amount of both is 100% by weight).<br>
In addition, in the case of using the solution (D), the ratio of the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) and the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) is such that the ratio is preferably controlled in advance when preparing the solution (D) so as to be within a range described above. In addition, the ratio is preferably adjusted to the above ratio by additionally incorporating the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) to the solution (D)) as necessary.<br>
The gas barrier film of the present invention is such that the ratio (Ao/A) of absorbance Ao, based on a value of 0 for the vC of carboxylic acid groups in the vicinity of 1700 cm-1 in the infrared absorption spectrum thereof, to absorbance A, based on a value of 0 for the vC of carboxylate ions in the vicinity of 1520 cm-1, is preferably less than 0.25, more preferably less than 0.20 and even more preferably less than 0.15.<br>
The gas barrier film of the present invention has improved gas barrier properties at low humidity as a result of containing the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b), and imparts toughness (elongation) to the film without causing a decrease in gas barrier properties following hot water treatment (hot water resistance).   In the case the content of the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified<br>
20<br><br>
vinyl alcohol polymer (b) exceeds 50% by weight, there is the risk of a decrease in gas barrier properties of the resulting film, and particularly a partial decrease in gas barrier properties at high humidity (oxygen barrier properties). On the other hand, if the content of the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) is excessively low, effects of improving gas barrier properties at low humidity may be inadequate.<br>
In the gas barrier film of the present invention, carboxylate ions and free carboxylic acid groups respectively formed by ionic crosslinking between carboxylic acid groups of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) and polyvalent metal are present in the gas barrier film of the present invention, and the absorbance based on a value of 0 for the vC of the free carboxylic acid groups is in the vicinity of 1700 cm4 in the infrared absorption spectrum thereof, while the absorbance based on a value of 0 for the vC of the carboxylate ions is in the vicinity of 1520 cm-1, respectively.<br>
In a gas barrier film as claimed in the present invention, the fact that the ratio of (Ao/A) is less than 0.25 indicates that free carboxylic acid groups are either not present or only present in a small amount, and since a layer in which this ratio exceeds 0.25 has the risk of not improving the gas barrier properties at high humidity due to a high content of free carboxylic acid groups, the ratio of (Ao/A) is preferably less than 0.25.<br>
The ratio (Ao/A) of absorbance Ao, based on a value of 0 for the vC of carboxylic acid groups in the vicinity of 1700 cm4, to absorbance A, based on a value of 0 for the vC of carboxylate ions in the vicinity of 1520 cm-1 in the infrared absorption spectrum thereof, was obtained by cutting out a measurement sample measuring 1 cm x 3 cm from the gas barrier film and measuring the infrared attenuated total reflection (ATR) of the infrared absorption spectrum of the surface thereof (polymer (A) layer), and absorbance Ao and absorbance A were first determined according to the procedure described below.<br>
21<br><br>
Absorbance Ao based on a value of 0 for the vC of carboxylic acid groups in the vicinity of 1700 cm-1: Absorbance values of the infrared absorption spectrum at 1660 cm-1 and 1760 cm-1 were connected with a line (N),' a line (O) was dropped down from the maximum absorbance (vicinity of 1700 cm4) from 1660 cm-1 to 1760 cm-1, and the absorbance distance (length) between the intersection of lines (O) and (N) and the maximum absorbance was taken to be absorbance Ao.<br>
Absorbance A based on a value of 0 for the vC of carboxylate ions in the vicinity of 1520 cm4: Absorbance values of the infrared absorption spectrum at 1480 cm4 and 1630 cm4 were connected with a line (L), a line (M) was dropped down from the maximum absorbance (vicinity of 1520 cm4) from 1480 cm4 to 1630 cm4, and the absorbance distance (length) between the intersection of lines (M) and (L) and the maximum absorbance was taken to be absorbance A. Furthermore, the location of the peak indicating maximum absorbance (vicinity of 1520 cm4) changes according to the counter ion metal species used, and for example, is in the vicinity of 1520 cm4 in the case of calcium, in the vicinity of 1520 cm4 in the case of zinc, and in the vicinity of 1540 cm4 in the case of magnesium.<br>
Next, the ratio of (Ao/ A) of absorbance Ao to absorbance A, which were determined according to the method described above, was determined.<br>
Furthermore, measurement of infrared spectra (measurement of attenuated total reflection (ATR)) in the present invention was carried out by using the FT-IR350 system manufactured by Jasco Corp. and installing a KRS-5 (thallium bromide-iodide) crystal under conditions consisting of an incident angle of 45 degrees, room temperature, resolution of 4 cm4 and 150 integration cycles.<br>
Although the thickness of the gas barrier film of the present invention can be variously determined according to the application, it is normally within the range of 0.0 to 100 µm, preferably within the range of 0.05 to 50 µm and more preferably within the range of 0.1 to 10 µm.<br>

The gas barrier laminate of the present invention is produced by forming a gas barrier film on at least one side of the base material layer (I) from the previously described solution (A), (B) or (C) in the form of a solution comprised of the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b) and the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c). In addition, the gas barrier laminate of the present invention is produced by forming a gas barrier film formed from the solution (D) on at least one side of the base material layer (I).<br>
The formation (lamination) of the gas barrier film results in a laminate having transparency, superior gas barrier properties (oxygen barrier properties) at both high humidity and low humidity, and toughness without causing a decrease in gas barrier properties (hot water resistance) following hot water treatment.<br>
In addition, in the case of using a gas barrier laminate using a film base material (1-1) for the base material layer (I) in a packaging material and the like, heat seal strength is improved.<br>

In addition, when laminating the gas barrier film to the base material layer (I), several layers of the gas barrier film and inorganic compound deposited layer (II) may be laminated in the manner of, for example, base material (I)/ gas barrier film/inorganic compound deposited layer (11)/gas barrier film/ inorganic compound deposited layer (11)/gas barrier film.<br>
A gas barrier laminate laminated with multiple layers in this manner is able to nearly completely block out oxygen or other gases and water vapor.<br>
The gas barrier laminate of the present invention can also be a laminate having a known shape, such as a laminated film (sheet), hollow container, cup or tray, according to the shape of the base material layer (I) to be described later or corresponding to the application.<br>

In addition, in the case of using the film base material (I-l) for the base material layer (I), the film base material may be a uniaxially or biaxially stretched film base material. If a biaxially stretched film base material is used for the film base material (I-l), a laminate is obtained having superior transparency, heat resistance and stiffness.<br>

radiation, visible light having a wavelength region within the range of 400 to 800 nm, ultraviolet light having a wavelength region within the range of 50 to 400 nm and an electron beam having a wavelength region within the range of 0.01 to 0.002 nm are preferable due their handling ease and wide range of applicable devices.<br>
In the case of using visible light or ultraviolet light for the ionizing radiation, it is necessary to add a photopolymerization initiator to the solution of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) containing the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b). A known photopolymerization initiator can be used for the photopolymerization initiator, examples of which include radical polymerization initiators manufactured and sold under trade names such as 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-phenyl-propan-l-one (Ciba Specialty Chemicals, trade name: Darocure 1173), 1-hydroxy-cyclohexyl- phenyl ketone (Ciba Specialty Chemicals, trade name: Irgacure 184), bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine oxide (Ciba Specialty Chemicals, trade name: Irgacure 819), l-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-phenyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-propan-l-one (Ciba Specialty Chemicals, trade name: Irgacure 2959), mixture of a-hydroxyketone, acylphosphine oxide, 4-methylbenzophenone and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzophenone (Lamberti Specialty Chemicals, trade name: Esacure KT046), Esacure KT55 (Lamberti Specialty Chemicals), and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide (Lambson Fine Chemicals, trade name: Speedcure TPO). Moreover, a polymerization accelerator can be added to improve the degree of polymerization or polymerization rate, examples of which include N,N-dimethylamino-ethyl-(meth)acrylate and N-(meth)acryloyl- morpholine.<br>
When polymerizing the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) containing the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b), although the solution may be polymerized in the state of containing a solvent such as water or may be polymerized after partially drying, in the case of polymerizing immediately after coating the solution, there are cases in which the resulting polymer (X) layer whitens perhaps due to excessive evaporation of solvent during<br>
32<br><br>
polymerization of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c). On the other hand, there also cases in which the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) precipitates in the form of crystals as the solvent (moisture) decreases, and formation of the resulting polymer layer becomes inadequate if polymerized while in this state, thereby resulting in the risk of whitening of the polymer (X) layer or gas barrier properties being unstable. Thus, when polymerizing the coated unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c), polymerization is preferably carried out in a state in which it contains a suitable amount of moisture.<br>
In addition, when polymerizing the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c) containing the unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer (b), polymerization may be carried out by irradiating with ionizing radiation once or polymerization may be carried out by dividing irradiation into two or more doses or by irradiating continuously. In addition, in the case of irradiating in two or more doses, the first dose may be weak while the second dose may be strong, or the radiation intensity may be the same for all doses or changed continuously.<br>
In addition, the resulting polymer is further subjected to heat treatment. Heat treatment is normally carried out within the range of 30 to 350°C, preferably within the range of 50 to 300°C and more preferably within the range of 100 to 250°C, and is preferably carried out in an inert gas atmosphere. In addition, there are no particular limitations on pressure, and heat treatment may be carried out under pressure, under reduced pressure or at normal pressure. The duration of heat treatment is normally about 30 seconds to 90 minutes, preferably 1 to 70 minutes, and particularly preferably 5 to 60 minutes.<br>
If the gas barrier laminate of the present invention is a laminated film, a laminated film (multilayer film) preferable as a heat-sealable packaging film can be obtained by laminating (superimposing)  a heat-fused  layer  on at least one  side  thereof.<br>
33<br><br>
Examples of the heat-fused layer include homo- or copolymers of known a-olefins<br>
ordinarily used as heat-fused layers, such as ethylene, propylene, butene-1,<br>
hexene-l,4-methyl-pentene-l or octene-1, compositions containing one type or two<br>
or more types of polyolefins such as high-pressure low-density polyethylene, linear<br>
low-density polyethylene (so-called LLDPE), high-density polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene,	polypropylene	random	copolymers,	polybutene,<br>
poly-4-methyl-pentene-l, lowly crystalline or amorphous ethylene-propylene random copolymers or ethylene -butene-1 random copolymers, composition including one or two or more types of polyolefin such as propylene-butene-1 random copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), ethylene-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer or metal salts thereof, and compositions of EVA and polyolefins.<br>
In particular, heat-fused layers obtained from ethylene polymers such as high-pressure low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene (so-called LLDPE) or high-density polyethylene are preferable due to their superior low-temperature heat sealing properties and heat seal strength.<br>
In the gas barrier laminate of the present invention^ the previously described base material layer (I) may also be laminated on the surface of a gas barrier film of a gas barrier laminate or on the surface thereof on which the gas barrier film is not formed in accordance with various applications.<br>
The following provides a more detailed explanation of the present invention using the following examples.<br><example><br>

After replacing the inside of the flask with a mixed gas of 2% oxygen and 98% nitrogen, 6.041 g (0.0597 mol) of 36% hydrochloric acid were added to the flask. The temperature was raised to 65°C to start the reaction.    Nine hours later, the reaction was stopped by diluting the<br>

reaction solution using 1275 g of deionized water to obtain 1548.68 g of polymer solution. The modification rate of acrylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer in the resulting polymer solution was 7.5 mol% as determined by 1H-NMR. The concentration of acidic compounds in the resulting polymer solution was 1.454 mmol/g as determined by acid neutralization titration.<br>
(2)    Ion Exchange Step<br>
1.5 L of conditioned Diaion WA30 (Mitsubishi Chemical) were filled into an ion exchange column followed by passing 687.76 g of the polymer solution obtained in the reaction step (acidic compound content: 1.00 mol) through the column at the rate of SV = 5 to obtain 2331.5 g of a solution (B-1) containing acrylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer. The concentration of unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer in the solution (B-1) was measured to be 0.083 mmol/g. In addition, when the concentration of acidic compounds was measured by acid neutralization titration, acidic compounds were not detected.<br><example><br>
The same procedure as the reaction step and ion exchange step of Example 1 was carried out with the exception of using 7.592 g (0.0750 mol) of 36% hydrochloric acid<br>
35<br><br>
in the reaction step. When the resulting polymer solution was measured by 1H-NMR, the modification rate of acrylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer in the solution (B-2) was 8.8%, and acidic compounds were not detected by acid neutralization titration.<br><example><br>
The same procedure as the reaction step and ion exchange step of Example 1 was carried out with the exception of using 9.133 g (0.0902 mol) of 36% hydrochloric acid in the reaction step. When the resulting polymer solution was measured by 1H-NMR, the modification rate of acrylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer in the solution (B-3) was 10.8%, and acidic compounds were not detected by acid neutralization titration.<br><example><br>
0.040 L of conditioned Diaion WA30 (Mitsubishi Chemical) were filled into an ion exchange column followed by passing 821.57 g of the polymer solution obtained in the reaction step of Example 1 (hydrochloric acid content: 30.84 mmol) through the column at the rate of SV = 5 to obtain 849,22 g of a solution (C-4) containing acrylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer and acrylic acid. The concentration of acrylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer in the solution (C-4) was measured to be 0.43 mmol/g. The concentration of acidic compounds in the solution (C-4) was 1.279 mmol/g when measured by acid neutralization titration. In addition, quantification of CI in the solution (C-4) as determined by combustion gas adsorption-ion chromatography yielded a value of 5 ppm by weight or less.<br><example><br>
(3)    Neutralization Step<br>
36<br><br>
A stirrer, thermometer and three-way cock were attached to a 200 mL three-mouth round bottom flask, and 70.0 g of the solution (C-4) obtained in Example 4 (acidic compound content: 87.8 mmol) were added to the flask. This solution was stirred using a three-one motor, and 3.572 g (43.9 mmol) of zinc oxide were added so that the reaction solution did not exceed 35°C. After allowing to react for 4 hours at 30°C, the small amount of undissolved zinc oxide remaining was filtered out to obtain 65.0 g of solution (D-5). The Zn content in the solution (D-5) was 4.1% by weight as quantified by ICP optical emission spectroscopy. In addition, the CI content in the solution (D-5) was 5 ppm by weight or less as quantified by combustion gas adsorption-ion chromatography. ' The concentration of acrylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer based on 1H-NMR analysis of the solution (D-5) was 0.32 mmol/g, and the concentration of acrylate groups was 1.11 mmol/g.<br><example><br>
A stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser and three-way cock were attached to a 1000 mL four-mouth round bottom flask, after which the inside of the flask was replaced with nitrogen. 162.18 g (2.25 mol) of acrylic acid and 80.94 g (4.49 mol) of deionized water were added to the flask after which stirring was started using a three-one motor. 33.056 g (0.75 mol) of polyvinyl alcohol (degree of polymerization: 1000, degree of saponification: 98.5 mol%, Kuraray, trade name: PVA110) and 0.1236 g (0.996 mol) of p-methoxyphenol were added to the flask. After replacing the inside of the flask with a mixed gas of 2% oxygen and 98% nitrogen, 402 g of a solid acid catalyst in the form of PK208LH (anion exchange resin, Mitsubishi Chemical) were added to the flask. The temperature was raised to 80°C to start the reaction. Nine hours later, the reaction was stopped by diluting the reaction solution using 1275 g of deionized water. The solid acid catalyst was then removed by filtration to obtain 1312.0 g of a solution (C-6). The modification rate of acrylic acid-modified vinyl alcohol polymer in the resulting solution (C-6) was 0.5 mol% as determined by iH-NMR. The concentration of acidic compounds in the resulting solution (C-6) was 1.39 mmol/g as determined by acid neutralization titration.<br>

Subsequently, the base material film was promptly fixed to a stainless steel plate with the coated surface facing upward, and the coating solution was polymerized by irradiating with ultraviolet light under conditions of a UV intensity of 180 mW/cm2 and cumulative light quantity of 180 mj/cm2 using a UV radiation apparatus (Eye Graphic, Eye Grandage Model ECS 301G1) to obtain a gas barrier laminated film. The resulting gas barrier laminated film was evaluated using the previously described methods.<br>
The evaluation results are shown in Table 1.<br><example><br>
Example 8 was carried out in the same manner as Example 5 with the exception of changing the base material film used in Example 7 from a biaxially stretched film having a thickness of 12 µm (Unitika, trade name: Emblet PET12) to an aluminum oxide-deposited biaxially stretched polyethylene terephthalate film having a thickness of 12 µm (deposited PET: Tohcello, trade name: TL-PET H) to obtain a gas barrier laminated film.   The resulting gas barrier'laminated film was evaluated<br>

FCS), a multilayer film was produced by laminating (dry laminating) the zinc acrylate polymer sides (polymer layer of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt (c)) of the gas barrier laminated films obtained in the examples and reference examples.<br>
