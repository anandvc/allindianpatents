This application takes priority from US Provisional Application USSN: 6O/6O4,632 filed 26 August 2004 and Indian Provisional Application 779/MUM/2OO5 filed O1 July 2OO5 and are herein incorporated in their entirety. <br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compositions of prodrugs, including NO-releasing prodrugs, codrugs, double prodrugs and mutual prodrugs, containing bio-labile linkers and linkages, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use. <br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A prodrug is an active drug chemically transformed into a per se inactive derivative which by virtue of chemical or enzymatic attack is converted to the parent drug within the body before or after reaching the site of action. The process of converting an active drug into inactive form is called drug latentiation. Prodrugs can be carrier-linked-prodrugs and bioprecursors. The carrier-linked prodrug results from a temporary linkage of the active molecule with a transport molety. Such prodrugs are less active or inactive compared to the parent active drug. The transport molety will be chosen for its non-toxicity and its ability to ensure the release of the active principle with efficient kinetics. Whereas the bioprecursors result from a molecular modification of the active principle itself by generation of a new molecule that is capable of being a substrate to the metabolizing enzymes releasing the active principle as a metabolite.<br>
Prodrugs are prepared to alter the drug pharmacokinetics, improve stability and solubility, decrease toxicity, increase specificity, and increase duration of the pharmaco10gical effect of the drug. By altering pharmacokinetics the drug bioavailability is increased by increasing absorption, distribution, biotransformation, and excretion of the drug. Limited intestinal absorption, distribution, fast metabolism, and toxicity are some of the causes of failure of drug candidates during deve10pment. Avoidance of the foreseeable or proven pharmacokinetic defects thus assumes considerable significance in drug research. Accordingly, prodrugs play a significant role in drug research as well.<br>
2<br><br>
In designing the prodrugs, it is important to consider the fol10wing factors: a) the linkage between the carrier and the drug is usually a covalent bond, b) the prodrug is inactive or less active than the active principle, c) the prodrug synthesis should not be expensive, d) the prodrug has to be reversible or bioreversible derivative of the drug, and e) the carrier molety must be non-toxic and inactive when released.<br>
Prodrugs are usually prepared by: a) formation of ester, hemiesters, carbonate esters, nitrate esters, amides, hydroxamic acids, carbamates, imines, mannich bases, and enamines of the active drug, b) functionalizing the drug with azo, glycoside, peptide, and ether functional groups, c) use of polymers, salts, complexes, phosphoramides, acetals, hemiacetals, and ketal forms of the drug. For example, see Andrejus Korolkovas's, "Essentials of Medicinal Chemistry", pp. 97-118.<br>
The discovery and characterization of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) was the subject of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physio10gy. NO is a major signaling molecule with important bio10gical roles. See, for example, Kerwin, Jr., J. F. et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 4343, and Williams, R. J. P., Chem. Soc. Rev., 1996, 77. The major bio10gical functions of NO include controlling b10od pressure, smoothing muscle tone and inhibition of platelet adherence and aggregation, assisting the immune system in destroying tumor cells and intracellular pathogens and participating in neuronal synaptic transmission. See, for example, Moncada, S. et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 1991, 43, 109; Bredt, D.S. et al., Anuu. Rev. Biochem., 1994, 63, 175; Schmidt, H. H. W. et al., Cell 1994, 78, 919; Feldman, P. L. et al., Chem. and Eng. News. 1993, 71 (2Oth December issue), 26; and Wilsonm E. K., Chem. and Eng. News. 2004 (8th March issue), 39. Endogenously, NO is produced from arginine by the catalytic action of nitric oxide synthase. See, for example, Nathan, C. et al., Cell 1994, 78, 915, and Marietta, M. A., Cell 1994, 78, 927.<br>
NO is a free radical as well as a scavenger of free radicals. NO reacts quickly with ubiquitously generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (O2") to generate a nefarious peroxynitrite (ONOO") molecule, which is implicated in many human diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. In this setting, NO is often viewed as pathogenic. However, the chemistry of NO can also be a significant factor in lessening the injury mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS). There is a relationship<br>
3<br><br>
between NO and oxidation, nitrosation and nitration reactions. A number of factors determine whether NO promotes, abates or interconnects these chemistries. See, for example, Espay, et al., A chemical perspective on the interplay between NO, reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen oxide species, Ann N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2OO2, 962, 195.<br>
Thus, by being a free radical, a10ng with the ability to scavenge other free radicals, NO is placed in a pivotal regulatory position. Insight into these pathophysio10gical processes and signaling are highly relevant to deve10p therapeutics.<br>
NO deficiency has been implicated in the genesis and evolution of several disease states. In patients with cardiovascular problems, the production of superoxide is increased and level or 10cation of NO synthesis is disrupted thereby causing cellular dysfunction as a result of vasoconstriction of b10od vessels, which can lead to, if pro10nged, cell damage or death. Agents that act to maintain the norma! balance between NO and superoxide in vascular endothelial cells may prove particularly useful in this regard. See, for example, Stokes, K., et al., Free Radic. Bio. Med., 2OO2, 33, 1026-1036.<br>
Nutritional and pharmaco10gical therapies that enhance the bioactivity or production of NO have been shown to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation, reduce symptoms, and s10w the progression of atherosclerosis. Some of the strategies for NO modulation encompass anti-inflammatory, sexual dysfunction, and cardiovascular indications. Apart from newly deve10ped drugs, several commonly used cardiovascular drugs exert their beneficial action, at least in part, by modulating the NO pathway. Pharmaco10gical compounds that release NO have been useful tools for evaluating the pivotal role of NO in cardiovascular physio10gy and therapeutics. NO-DONORS:<br>
There are a wide variety of structurally dissimilar organic compounds that act as NO donors and release NO in solution. Some NO donors, such as isoamyl nitrite, nitroglycerine (GTN) and sodium nitroprusside, have been used in cardiovascular medicine 10ng before their biochemical mechanism was understood. The common mode of action for these drugs is liberation of NO, which evokes relaxation of smooth muscle through activation of guanylate cyclase with subsequent formation of cGMP. The relative importance of enzymatic versus non-enzymatic pathways for NO release, the identity of<br>
4<br><br>
the actual NO-generating enzymes and the existence of competing metabolic events are additional important determinants of the different NO donor classes. Pharmaco10gical compounds that release NO constitute two broad classes of compounds: those that release NO or one of its redox congeners spontaneously and those that require enzymatic metabolism to generate NO. See, for example, Ignarro, L. J. et al., Nitric oxide donors and cardiovascular agents modulating the bioactivity of nitric oxide: an overview, Circ. Res. 2OO2, 90, 21-28.<br>
Nitroglycerine/glycerine trinitrate (GTN) and compounds referred to as nitrovasodilators or NO donors are frequently used in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. The common mode of action for these drugs is liberation of NO, which evokes relaxation of smooth muscle through activation of guanylate cyclase with subsequent formation of cGMP. However, early deve10pment of tolerance to nitrate therapy, particularly during acute myocardial infarction, has been the clinically significant drawback with GTN and some of the other available organic nitrates. This is a significant clinical problem and there exists a need for novel nitrate-based anti-anginal agents, which do not cause the problem of nitrate tolerance.<br>
There are a number of new examples of organic nitrates in which an alky! or aralkyl mononitrate is covalently linked to an existing drug molecule. Existing drugs from a large number of therapeutic areas such as anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antibiotic, anticancer, antidiabetic, antiviral, antihypertensive, antianginal, anticonvulsant, analgesic, antiasthmatic, antidepressant, antidiarrheal, antiinfective, antimigraine, antipsychotic, antipyratic, antiulcerative, antithrombotic, etc., were made and evaluated. Some of Nicox's patents include: Synthesis and evaluation of nitrooxy derivatives of NSAIDs (WO 9412463, WO O230867, WO O292O72, WO O313499 and WO O384550), aspirin (WO 9716405, WO OO447O5 and WO O104082), paracetamol (WO O112584 and WO O230866), antiepileptic agents (WO O300642 and WO O300643), COX-2 inhibitors (WO O40O781 and WO O40O300), statins "(WO O4105754), ACE inhibitors (WO O4110432 and WO O4106300), and of known drugs used for the treatment of disease conditions resulting from oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction (WO OO61537).<br>
5<br><br>
Most of these nitrate esters were shown to possess not only superior or equal efficacy when compared to the original drug but also exhibit much-reduced side effects. In fact, because of their superior efficacy combined with reduced toxicity, a few of such nitrate ester-containing drug conjugates are successfully passing through various stages of clinical trials. Some of Nicox's nitrooxy derivatives of drugs which are in clinical trials include: NCX 4016 (Phase II, peripheral vascular diseases). NCX 7O1 (Phase II, Acute pain), HCT 1026 (Phase I, Alzheimer's disease), HCT 3012 (Phase II, Osteoarthritis), NCX 285 (IND, Osteoarthritis), NCX 1022 (Phase I la completed, Dermatitis), NCX 102O (Phase 1, Asthma/COPD), NCX 100O (Phase I, Portal hypertension), and NCX 1510 (Phase II, Allergic rhinitis).<br>
US5767134 , and US2OO500O2942A1 disc10sed a few disulfide-containing prodrugs/folate-drug conjugates. WO 9842661, US 5807847, WO OO54756 and WO O149275 reported a few nitrooxy derivatives of organic molecules containing sulfahydryl or disulfide group which are called "SS-nitrates". These references are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Representative examples from WO 9842661 have shown superior vasorelaxant activity and no tolerance was observed to the cGMP-increasing effects of those compounds under the same experimental conditions used for the induction of in vivo tolerance. WO O149275 reports drug conjugates where an anti-inflammatory drug is covalently linked to the ie/^-mercapto-nitrate via thioester bond. Biotransformation pathways proposed for NO release from GTN have largely been heme-dependent or sulfahydryl-dependent. See, for examples, Thatcher, G. R. J. et al., Chem.Soc. Rev. 1998, 27, 331 and reference cited therein, and Bennett, B M. et al., Trends Pharmacol, Sci. 1994, 15, 245. These references are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A mutual prodrug is the association in a unique molecule of two drugs, usually synergistic, attached to each other, one drug being the carrier for the other and vice versa. The embodiments of the invention also provide mutual prodrugs, which are prodrugs of two or three therapeutic agents currently used/potential for use in combination therapy utilizing novel bio-cleavable linkers, water-soluble prodrugs of insoluble/sparingly-soluble therapeutic agents using the same linker techno10gy and water-soluble double and<br>
6<br><br>
triple prodrugs of sparingly-soluble therapeutic agents or any of the prodrugs linked to NO-releasing agent using the same linker techno10gy. Summary of the Invention<br>

The candidates for making mutual prodrugs can be the pairs of drugs that are currently used in combination therapy (including those combination studies at investigational stage) in various therapeutic areas provided each of those drugs possesses the requisite functional group(s). There are a number of therapeutic areas where such combination therapy is applied routinely and successfully.<br>
On the basis of the proposed sulfahydryl-dependent mechanism of NO-release from GTN, we have designed the compounds and prodrugs of the present invention where a suitable drug molecule is linked covalently to a nitrooxy (nitrate ester) group via a bio-labile linker containing strategically 10cated disulfide bond at 6e/a-position to nitrate ester. In vivo, the disulfide bond in the prodrug is expected to be reduced by endogenous sulfahydryf-containing species such as glutathione (GSH) to generate a reactive thiolate anion (i.e., &amp;eta-mercapto-nitrate), which can trigger further break-down of the linker molety to release the free drug (via a mechanism as shown Scheme Ml) and NO simultaneously at the same 10cation. It is possible, as depicted in the mechanism Scheme Ml, the release of NO can go via a hypothetical cyclic transient intermediate 'b'. Similar hypothetical mechanism was proposed for NO release from SS-nitrates, which were also designed on the basis of a sulfahydryl-dependent NO release from GTN. See, for example, Zavorin, S. I. et al., Organic Letters, 2OO1, 3, 1113, incorporated herein in its entirety.Mutual prodrugs can be made by linking covalently any two of the fol10wing: an ami no-containing therapeutic agent to another amino-containing therapeutic agent; an amino-containing therapeutic agent to a hydroxyl-containing therapeutic agent; an amino-containing therapeutic agent to a carboxyl-containing therapeutic agent and its derivative; a hydroxyl-containing therapeutic agent to a carboxyl-containing therapeutic agent and its derivative; an amino-containing therapeutic agent to a carboxyl-containing therapeutic agent and its derivative; an amino-containing therapeutic agent to a keto-containing therapeutic agent or its hydazone, semicarbazone or oxime derivative and the likes; a<br>

Another aspect of the present invention is to provide new nitrate ester (NO-releasing) prodrugs of many types of existing drugs using novel biocleavable likers. Such prodrugs are expected to exhibit better efficacy and tolerability with reduced side effects compared to the corresponding original drugs.<br>

Plausible Mechanisms of Drug Release from Prodrugs<br>
Drugs can be released form the prodrugs and mutual prodrugs via cleavage of bio-labile linker(s) in vivo (cleavage can be either chemical or enzymatic or both) by illustrative mechanisms as shown in Schemes Ml through M5.<br>
Plausible mechanisms for concomitant release of nitric oxide (NO) and free drug from NO-releasing prodrug(s) of amino-, hydroxyl-, or carboxyl-containing drug(s) are illustratively shown in Schemes Ml. Thus, the attack of thiolate ion (from GSH or any other sulfahydryl-containing species) on nitrooxy-containing prodrug would release carboxylic acid-containing free drug, episulfide (d) and the intermediate conjugate (a) according to path 1. If the prodrugs are made from amino-, or hydroxyl-containing drugs, then the prodrug would be cleaved via path 2 to release the corresponding free drug, the cyclic thiocarbonate intermediate (c) and the intermediate conjugate (a). The cyclic thiocarbonate intermediate may further breakdown into episulfide (d) and carbon dioxide. The reactive episulfide (d) would be further neutralized by glutathione. The nitrate ester-containing intermediate conjugate can further break down in the presence of GSH to glutathione dimer (GS-SG) and transient intermediate (b). which can break down via path 3 to release NO. It is also possible the same transient intermediate can break down via path 4 to yield episulfide (d) and a relatively innocuous nitrate anion (NO3).<br>
89<br><br><br>
Plausible mechanisms of drug release from mutual prodrugs of one carboxyl-containing and one amino-/hydroxy!-containing drug is shown in Scheme M2.<br>
90	<br><br><br>
Plausible mechanism of drug release from prodrugs (including mutual and NO-releasing prodrugs of amino-, hydroxyl-and carboxyl-containing drugs) containing modified bio-labile linkers is shown in Scheme M3. Thus, the thiolate anion derived from the attack of glutathione on disulfide of the prodrug may trigger cyclization to release the free drug (Dl-XmlH) and a stable six-membered (or five-membered, if Xm2 is a bond) thio-lactone intermediate.<br>
91<br><br><br>
Plausible mechanisms of drug release from double/mutual prodrugs containing additional linkages to couple two hydroxyl-containing drugs are shown in Scheme M4. Thus, the thiolate anion generated by the attack of glutathione on disulfide bond of the prodrug triggers further cleavage as shown to release the free drug (D1-OH) and a five-membered 2-imidazolidone. Through in vitro decomposition studies, we have found that the drug release from this type of prodrug is more facile when R group is an alkyl group.<br>
92<br><br><br>
This invention also covers novel bio-labile linkers containing 1,4-phenylene group and 1,2-phenylene group as shown in Schemes 5 and 6, respectively. As depicted in Scheme M5, the linker is expected to release the free Drug upon glutathione-assisted cleavage and may generate 1,4-quinonemethid (ea) as a byproduct via 1,6-elimination process. Similarly, the free Drug is expected to be released from the intermediate conjugate (a) as shown in the scheme.<br><br><br>
As depicted in Scheme M6, the 1,2-phenylene-containing linker is also expected to release free drugs upon glutathione assisted cleavage and genereate 1,2-quinonemethid (eb) as a byproduct via 1,4-elimination process (via pathway 'b'). However, this linker can also cleave via pathway 4a' to generate benzo-monothiocarbonate as a byproduct. Although the generated byproducts seem to be toxic, they are likely to be quickly neutralized by detoxification enzymes in the body.<br>
94<br><br><br>
95<br><br><br>
Scheme M7: Plausible mechanism of diazepam formation from an acyclic prodrug of diazepam<br>
Diazepam, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer, is very sparingly water-soluble drug and a water-soluble acyclic prodrug of diazepam can be made by using our linker techno10gy. As shown in the Scheme M7, reduction of disulfide bond in the prodrug triggers release of open-chain intermediate of diazepam which spontaneously cyclizes to diazepam in vivo.<br>
Where GSH is glutathione (reduced) or any other in vivo bioreductive agent that can reduce the disulfide bond. As illustrated, cleavage of disulfide bond triggers further breakage of the remaining portion of the linker to release the free drugs. In the process, some byproducts are generated and these are either eliminated or further degraded by some bio10gical process. For clarity, the mechanism of cleavage of the linker is shown as occurring in stepwise manner. However, both the steps can possibly occur in a concomitant fashion to release both the drugs simultaneously.<br>
As illustrated in Scheme M3 and M4, Linkers may have additional spacer groups between one side (or both sides) of the linkers and the drug molecule and some of these spacer groups may be cleaved independently by a chemical or enzymatic process to release the drugs prematurely before the cleavage of disulfide linkage. The prodrugs and mutual prodrugs containing such spacer groups may be useful when faster release of drug(s) is desired.<br>

In addition to the above list of drugs, the the present invention also covers newer drugs with the above mentioned active functional groups as listed in the Merck index (13th edition) and other drug databases such as Prous Science's ensemble, integrity and the investigational drugs as listed in databases such as iddb, ensemble, integrity, and the like without any limitation.<br>
It shoud be understood that either or both of any selected pair of drugs (in any proportion) can be in the form of nitrate ester (NO-releasing) prodrug(s) of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and the other drug can be in its native form. For clarity, let us assume that Ibuprofen and Paracetamol are present as active principles in a pharmaceutical compoisition. Then, either or both of these drugs can be in their NO-releasing prodrug form (i.e., NO-Paracetamol and Ibuprofen/ Paracetamol and NO-Ibuprofen/ NO-Paracetamol and NO-Ibuprofen, etc.) and they can be present in any proportion.<br>
It should also be understood that a pharmaceutical composition consisting of two or more of the above listed/qualified drugs, one of the drugs can be in the form of NO-releasing (nitrooxy derivative) prodrug and the other drug(s) in the combination can be in the form another type of prodrug(s).<br>
It should also be understood that a pharmaceutical composition containing a combination of one of the above listed/qualified drug(s) and its own prodrug is also covered (i.e., a pharmaceutical composition consisting of NO-Paracetamol and Paracetamol in any proportion). In such pharmaceutical combinations, the free drug will be useful for faster onset of action and the prodrug will be useful for extension of the duration of action as it releases the drug in a controlled fashion over a 10nger period of time. Such combination drug therapy may also minimize the toxicity and other side effects due to excessive plasma concentration of free drug. It should also be understood that a pharmaceutical combination may contain a prodrug of one of the above listed/qualified drugs and an another type of prodrug of the same drug (i.e., NO prodrug of pracetamol and mutual prodrug of paracetamol with another drug) and these can be present in any therapeutic proportion depending on the medical need.<br>

Bio10gical Example 1:<br>
Screening of prodrugs and mutual prodrugs of anticonvulsants:<br>
Most of the prodrugs and mutual prodrugs of anticonvulsants described in this invention were evaluated at National Institute of Neuro10gical Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institute of Health (NIH), under their Antiepileptic Screening Program (ASP).<br>
179<br><br>
Test 1 is an initial screening for anticonvulsant activity in the Maximal Electroshock Test (MES) and Subcutaneous Metrazol Seizure Threshold Test (scMET) models combined with an initial assessment of toxicity (TOX) in mice via i.p. injection (see further explanation be10w). The data for each condition is presented as N/F, where N = number of animals protected from seizure and F = number of animals tested. For test of toxicity, N = number of animals displaying toxic effects and F = number of animals tested. Any deaths occurring during the test were recorded.<br>
Maximal Electroshock Test (MES): The MES is a model for generalized tonic-c10nic seizure and provides an indication of a compound's ability to prevent seizure spread when all neuronal circuits in the brain are maximally active. These seizures are highly reproducible and electro-physio10gically consistent with human seizures. For all tests based on MES convulsions, 60 Hz of alternating current (50 mA in mice) is delivered for 2s by corneal electrodes, which have been primed with an electrolyte solution containing an anesthetic agent (0.5% tetracaine hydroch10ride). Mice were tested at various intervals fol10wing doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg of test compound given by i.p. injection of a volume of 0.01 mL/g. Other doses can be used if indicated by previously known pharmaco10gy. An animal is considered "protected" from MES-induced seizures upon abolition of the hind-limb tonic extensor component of the seizure.<br>
Subcutaneous Metrazol Seizure Threshold Test (scMET): Subcutaneous injection of the convulsant metrazol produces clonic seizures in laboratory animals. The scMET test detects the ability of the test compound to raise the seizure threshold of an animal and thus protect it from exhibiting a c10nic seizure. Animals were pretreated with various doses of the test compound given by i.p. injection. At the previously determined Time to Peak Effect (TPE) of the test compound, the dose of metrazol which will produce convulsions in 97% of animals (CD97: 85 mg/kg in mice) was injected into a 10ose fold of skin in the midline of the neck. The animals were placed in isolation cages to minimize stress and observed for the next 30 minutes for the presence or absence of a seizure. An episode of c10nic spasms, approximately 305 seconds, of the fore and/or hind limbs, jaws, or vibrissae is taken as the end point. Animals which do not meet this criterion were considered protected.<br>
180<br><br>
Acute Toxicity - Minimal Motor Impairment (MMI): To assess a compound's undesirable side effects (toxicity), animals were monitored for overt signs of impaired neuro10gical or muscular function. In mice, the rotorod procedure is used to disc10se minimal muscular or neuro10gical impairment. When a mouse is placed on a rod that rotates at a speed of 6 rpm, the animal can maintain its equilibrium for 10ng periods of time. The compound is considered toxic if the animal falls off this rotating rod three times during a 1-min period. In addition to MMI, animals may exhibit a circular or zigzag gait, abnormal body posture and spread of the legs, tremors, hyperactivity, lack of exp10ratory behavior, somnolence, stupor, catalepsy, 10ss of placing response and changes in muscle tone.<br>
Compounds that were active in Test 1 (mice i.p.) were further screened in Test 2 (rat p.o.). Compounds retaining activity in Test 2 (rat p.o.) were selected for secondary evaluation (i.e., Test 3, Rat P.O. quantification) as explained be10w:<br>
Secondary Evaluation: All quantitative in vivo anticonvulsant/toxicity evaluations of the active compounds were conducted at compound's time of peak pharmacodynamic activity (TPE). Groups of at least 8 rats received various doses of the candidate compound until at least two points were established between the limits of 100 percent protection or toxicity and zero percent protection or minimal toxicity. The 95 percent confidence limits, s10pes of the regression lines and standard errors of the s10pes were calculated for each quantitative determination. Rats received test compounds orally.<br>
Test 1 screening results are presented in Table 1. Compound I-CA-MPD24 was active in both MES and scMET models and was shown to be non-toxic. However, some compounds were active in both MES and scMET models and were also shown to be toxic. The compounds (i.e., I-A1-PD4,1-AA-MPD12,1-CA-MPD23,1-A1-PD5,1-Al-NOPD3, I-CA-MPD24,I-A1-PD15,1-CA-MPD25, and I-AA-MPD11) that are shown to be active in MES but showed no or mild toxicity were selected for Test 2 screening and those results are presented in Table 2.<br>
Three of the compounds (i.e., I-A1-PD4,1-AA-MPD12, and I-A1-NOPD3) were considered for secondary evaluation, where quantification of their antiepileptic activity and neurotoxicity in rats (p.o.) was carried out. This secondary evaluation determines the time to peak effect (TPE), neurotoxicity, median effective dose (ED50) and bio10gical<br>

response. The 95% confidence interval, the s10pe of the regression line, and the standard error are then calculated. The results of secondary evaluation (Test 3) are presented in<br>

I-A1-PD4 is a simple prodrug of lamotrigine. For this prodrug, ED50 for the MES model was determined to be 6.55 mg/kg and the time to peak effect was found to be 4.O h after drug administration at doses of 10 as well as 30 mg/kg. This compound has shown moderate protection in scMET models where one out of four animals were protected at O.25 h and 2.0 h period and two out of four animals were protected at 0.706 h after administration of the drug at a dose of 50 mg/kg. For the toxicity analysis, none of the animals given 100 mg/kg showed signs of toxicity.<br>
I-AA-MPD12 is a mutual prodrug of lamotrigine and gabapentin ethyl ester. For this compound, ED50 for the MES model was found to be 17 mg/kg and the time to peak effect was found to be 6.0-8.O h at a dose of 30 mg/kg and indicated a significant extension protection (2 out of 4 animals were still protected) at 24 h after drug administration. Surprisingly, this compound, although less potent than lamotrigine, has exhibited significant extension in the duration of protection. At 50 mg/kg, none of the animals exhibited toxicity. However, at 100 mg/kg, one of eight animals exhibited mild ataxia.<br>
I-A1-NOPD3 is a NO-releasing prodrug of lamotrigine. For this prodrug, ED50 for the MES model was determined to be 10.1 mg/kg and the time to peak effect was found be at 8.O h at a dose of 30 mg/kg and revealed a significant extension of protection <br>
 (3 out 4 animals were still protected) even at 24 h after drug administration. Surprisingly, this prodrug, although less potent than its parent drug, has exhibited significant extension<br>
187<br><br>
in the duration of protection. At 50 mg/kg, this compound has also exhibited significant protection (3 out of 4 animals were protected at 8 h after drug administration) in scMET rat model. For the toxicity analysis, only one in eight animals exhibited toxicity at 6.0 h time point at a dose of 500 mg/kg. At other time points (i.e., O.25 h, 0.5 h, 0.706 h, 2.0 h, 4.O h, 8.O h after drug administration), none of the animals (O/8) exhibited any significant toxicity at the high dose of 500 mg/kg. <br>
Bio10gical Example 2:<br>
The pharmaco10gical experiments on NO-releasing aspirin prodrugs were carried out by fol10wing the procedures described herein: <br>
Animals and Procedures:<br>
Male or female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150-2OO g were used in the study. The rats were fed normal standard laboratory chow and maintained under standard conditions (room temperature of 22 ± 2 °C; 50 ± 10 % relative humidity; artificial light O6:OO to 18:OO). All experimental procedures mentioned be10w are approved by institutional animal research committees and were performed in accordance with standard guidelines for the treatment of animals. <br>
Sample preparation and standard curve:<br>
HPLC:  Waters Allience analytical  HPLC equipped  with  2996 PDA detector and Empower software were used to analyze the samples.<br>
HPLC Column: WatersX-TerraRP-18 analytical column, 150X3.9 mm, 5 D. HPLC Method: F10w: 1 mL/min, detecter set at 210 nm and at Maxp10t (210-40O nm range). Solvent A: Acetonitrile; Solvent B: O.1% TFA in water. Elution method: A linear gradient of 0-100% A.<br>
Plasma samples were processed by transferring 75 u.1 quantity of b10od into a test tube containing 250 µl acetonitrile, vortex-mixed and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. 200 µl of supernatant was then taken and diluted to 2 times with acetonitrile. 100 µl of the sample was injected into HPLC for analysis. Salicylate standard curves were generated using acetonitrile as solvent in the working range of 1-100 ng/ml.<br>
188<br><br>
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNonlin software (4.1 version). Cmax, Tmax, AUC O-24, AUC O-infinity, and T|# characterized and each curve generated fol10wing oral treatment <br>
In Vitro Plasma stability:<br>
The rationale is that the prodrugs would be hydrolyzed in-vivo before, during or after absorption to release the corresponding free drugs. Therefore, we tested whether the test compounds (I-C1-NOPD6,1-C1-NOPD4,1-C1-NOPD5A) released parent drug in rat plasma at 37 ° C after 30 minutes incubation. The compounds were extracted back into acetonitrile with rigorous vortex. The results suggested that all prodrugs tested except I-C1-NOPD6 were found to be converting to the expected metabolite (salicylate) of the parent drug (aspirin) as revealed by HPLC analysis. Even aspirin was completely metabolized to salicylate after 30 minutes of incubation with rat plasma indicating that all the test compounds released aspirin, which in turn converted into salicylate. Pharmacokinetic studies:<br>
The oral pharmacokinetics of the test compounds, I-C1-NOPD6, I-C1-NOPD4,1-C1-NOPD5A and I-C1-NOPD5B was done in rats and the release profiles of salicylate from these compounds were analyzed by HPLC and the results were presented in Figure 1 and Table 4. Overnight fasted rats were fed with 35 mg/kg equivalent doses of aspirin and test compounds. B10od was collected from orbital plexus of test animals at various time points up to 24 hrs. As shown in Figure 1, the test compounds I-C1-NOPD4 and I-C1-NOPD5B indicated unexpected drug release profiles wherein the salicylate is released in a sustained and controlled manner starting from 1 hour through 12 hours. For I-Ci-NOPD5B, the plasma salicylate concentration was maintained between 50 and 75 ⁭g/ml during this extended period of over 11 hours. This kind of plasma concentrations of the drug can result in significant extension of duration of action. For I-C1-NOPD4 also, the plasma salicylate concentration was maintained between 35 and 50 ⁭g/mL during an extended period of over 11 hours. Although aspirin absorption (Figure 1) was highest during 0.5 - 6.0 hrs (during which period much of the damage to the gastrointestinal tract of the subject occurs due to high concentrations of the drug), plasma salicylate concentration for aspirin and I-C1-NOPD4 were comparable during the period from 8 through 24 hours.   Such sustained release profile of active drug from the prodrug is<br>
189<br><br>
expected to cause negligible or insignificant gastrointestinal damage as the plasma concentration of the drug never reaches to the toxic levels. Similar release profile was observed with I-C1-NOPQ5A but for a shorter period of time. Unexpectedly, we have also observed as recorded in Table 4, nearly equal drug AUC values for aspirin and I-Cl -NOPD5B (i.e., 923.63 ± 182.08 for aspirin vs 951.98 ± 11.58 for I-C1-NOPD5B) which indicates that the prodrug is as bioavailable as its parent drug, but prodrug does not cause gastric damage. Surprisingly, neither the prodrug nor the salicylate was found in the plasma of the animals fed with I-C1-NOPD6 (data not included in the graph) at any point of time tested, the reasons for which are not known.<br><br>

Ulcerogenic activity:<br>
Gastrointestinal ulceration is a serious side effect associated with NSAIDs. The clinical uses of potent NSAIDs are greatly limited by its gastrointestinal toxicity. We tested ulcerogenic potential of the test compounds, I-C1-NOPD6, I-C1-NOPD4, I-Cl-NOPD5A, and I-C1-NOPD5B in rats. Overnight fasted rats were given orally 100 mg/kg equivalent doses of aspirin and prodrugs (in the case of 1-C1-NOPD5A and I-Cl-NOPD5B, 200 mg/kg equivalent doses were administered). The animals were sacrificed at 3 hours after drug administration. Stomachs of treated rats were separated, perfused with 10 ml of 2 % formalin, and then cut open over the greater curvature. The severity of the mucosal damage was then assessed on the basis of size (area) of the observed ulcers under surgical microscope with a square grid as per the established procedure (Takeuchi et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998, 286 (1), 115-121). Interestingly, none of the animals treated with the test compounds showed any signs of deve10pment of ulcers. However, severe haemorrhagic lesions (Mean ± S.E.M.: 2.7 ± O.9 mm ) were seen in aspirin treated rats. <br>
Anti-inflammatory activity:<br>
Anti-inflammatory activity of test compounds was measured in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model (Takeuchi et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998, 286 (1), 115-121). The activity of aspirin and test compounds (75 mg/kg equivalent dose of aspirin) is shown in Table 5. Aspirin at 75 mg/kg, p.o. exhibited anti-inflammatory activity from 1 hr through 6 hr with peak maximal activity at 4 hr. I-C1-NOPD4 showed significant activity during the first two hours after drug administration but its activity was not as good as that of aspirin from 2 hr through 6 hr. Surprisingly, I-C1-NOPD5A showed negligible anti-inflammatory activity at any time point tested (data not incorporated). We have not yet evaluated I-Cl-NOPD5Bin this efficacy test.<br>
