				<td>JITTER PREVENTION IN A DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK<br>
The present invention generally relates to communications networks, and<br>
more particularly, to a digital home network ("DHN") using an alternating current<br>
("AC") power source in the home to remove jitter from multimedia data packets.<br>
Recent advances in digital communications technology have increased the<br>
viability of DHNs, which can allow various devices in a home to communicate with<br>
each other. In particular, the growing availability of broadband access has made it<br>
desirable to tie various devices in a home to a single gateway device that is coupled<br>
to provide centralized broadband access and distribution of multimedia data. In such<br>
a DHN, the gateway device accesses and buffers the multimedia data and distributes<br>
the data over the network as requested by various client devices coupled to the<br>
network.<br>
When distributing such data over a DHN, certain problems may arise. For<br>
example, there are a number of problems associated with taking a live broadcast and<br>
distributing it over an asynchronous DHN since a client device receiving the data<br>
generally does not have any control over the incoming data stream. Accordingly, in<br>
order to ensure that the networked client device can decode and display all of the<br>
audio and/or video data delivered to it at the correct frame rate, and without repeated<br>
or dropped frames, data synchronization issues must be addressed.<br>
One method for providing data synchronization in a broadcast network relies<br>
on delivering clock samples from a broadcast site to a gateway device with a fixed<br>
delay from the time of broadcast to the time of receipt. According to this method, a<br>
counter at the broadcast site is incremented by the broadcast site's reference clock to<br>
generate clock samples that are transmitted to the gateway device. At the instant the<br>
clock samples are received at the gateway device, a counter clocked by a voltage-<br>
controlled oscillator ("VCO") of the gateway device is sampled. The value of the<br>
counter at the gateway device is then compared with a count value represented by a<br>
clock sample provided from the broadcast site. If the difference between the counter<br>
values at the gateway device and the clock samples provided from the broadcast site<br><br>
varies over time, then a voltage applied to the VCO of the gateway device is adjusted<br>
to frequency lock the gateway device to the broadcast site's reference clock. While<br>
this method enables data synchronization between the broadcast site and the<br>
gateway device, it fails to provide data synchronization between the gateway device<br>
and networked client devices.<br>
In a collision detect network such as an Ethernet network, the failure to provide<br>
data synchronization between the gateway device and networked client devices can<br>
be significant. In particular, in such networks, data packets from multiple client<br>
devices often collide on the network, thus causing variable and unpredictable delays<br>
in the reception of data packets by client devices. As a result, "jitter" may be<br>
introduced into the clocks of the client devices. Depending upon the magnitude of<br>
such jitter, serious side effects may result, such as video freezing, audio chirps and/or<br>
undesirable display color changes.<br>
One way to address the jitter problem in a collision detect network involves<br>
using a buffer with overflow and underflow thresholds at the client device. In<br>
particular, by preventing the buffer level from crossing the overflow and underflow<br>
thresholds, the local clock of the client device can be controlled. While this technique<br>
may be useful in some situations, it is difficult to control and often requires video<br>
frames to be repeated or skipped.<br>
Another way to address the jitter problem in a collision detect network involves<br>
using time stamps at the network layer. In particular, this technique uses different<br>
time stamps at different portions of a network in an attempt to provide<br>
synchronization. While this technique is also useful in some situations, it does not<br>
always work with certain routers or bridges since the transmission delay time of data<br>
packets through such devices is not always constant, thereby introducing jitter.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a technique that overcomes the foregoing<br>
deficiencies and provides synchronization in a DHN. The present invention<br>
addresses these and other issues.<br><br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a server apparatus<br>
receives packetized data and transmits the packetized data over a network. The<br>
apparatus includes an input for receiving the packetized data from a signal source.<br>
An AC clock counter receives an AC power signal and generates a count value in<br>
dependence upon a frequency of the AC power signal. An output is coupled to the<br>
network and transmits the packetized data and the count value to a client device,<br>
which controls a clock associated with the client device in dependence upon the<br>
count value.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a client device<br>
receives packetized data and a first count value over a network. The device includes<br>
an input coupled to the network for receiving the packetized data and the first count<br>
value. An AC clock recovery unit receives an AC power signal and generates a<br>
second count value in dependence upon a frequency of the AC power signal. A clock<br>
associated with the device is controlled in dependence upon a comparison of the first<br>
and second count values.<br>
The above-mentioned and other features and advantages of this invention,<br>
and the manner of attaining them, will become more apparent and the invention will<br>
be better understood by reference to the following description of embodiments of the<br>
invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
FIG. 1 is an exemplary environment suitable for implementing the present<br>
invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a relevant portion of an exemplary network server apparatus<br>
according to principles of the present invention;<br>
FIG. 3 is an exemplary AC clock counter suitable for use with the network<br>
server apparatus of FIG. 2;<br>
FIG. 4 is a relevant portion of an exemplary client device according to<br>
principles of the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 5 is an exemplary AC clock recovery unit suitable for use with the client<br>
device of FIG. 4.<br><br>
The exemplifications set out herein illustrate preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, and such exemplifications are not to be construed as limiting the scope of<br>
the invention in any manner.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to FIG. 1, an exemplary<br>
environment 100 suitable for implementing the present invention is shown. For<br>
purposes of example and explanation, environment 100 of FIG. 1 is shown as a<br>
satellite broadcast system. It is noted, however, that the principles of the present<br>
invention may be applied to other types of systems, such as terrestrial, cable or other<br>
broadcast systems.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, environment 100 includes a transmission end comprising<br>
data sources such as tape source 10 and video source 12, a digitizer/encoder 14, a<br>
channel encoder/modulator 16, and an antenna 18. Environment 100 further<br>
includes a receiving end comprising an antenna 20, a network server 22, a network<br>
24, and a client device 26 having an audio/video output device 28 (e.g., television). A<br>
satellite 30 transmits signals between the transmission end and the receiving end.<br>
In operation, data from one of the data sources such as tape source 10 or<br>
video source 12 is digitized and encoded via digitizer/encoder 14 to generate<br>
encoded digital signals. Channel encoder/modulator 16 receives the encoded digital<br>
signals and performs thereon operations such as channel encoding, modulation and<br>
timing data insertion to generate channel encoded, modulated signals. Antenna 18<br>
receives the channel encoded, modulated signals and transmits the same to satellite<br>
30 as uplink signals. Satellite 30 receives the uplink signals and re-transmits them as<br>
downlink signals to antenna 20.<br>
Network server 22, which operates as a gateway device for the receiving end,<br>
receives the downlink signals from antenna 20 and performs thereon operations such<br>
as channel decoding, demodulation and timing data recovery to generate channel<br>
decoded, demodulated signals for distribution over network 24. Network 24 may be<br>
embodied as an asynchronous network such as an Ethernet network (e.g., 10BASE-<br>
T, 100BASE-X, etc.), a home phone network alliance ("HPNA") network, a power line<br><br>
carrier ("PLC") network, a wireless network (e.g., IEEE 802.11b), or other network.<br>
Alternatively, network 24 may be embodied as a synchronous network such as an<br>
IEEE 1394 network.<br>
Client device 26 receives the channel decoded, demodulated signals from<br>
over network 24, and performs thereon operations such as decoding and timing data<br>
recovery to generate, for example, an audio and/or video output via audio/video<br>
output device 28. For purposes of example and explanation, FIG. 1 shows only one<br>
client device connected to network 24. In practice, however, many such client<br>
devices may be connected to network 24.<br>
As previously indicated herein, signal transmission over networks such as<br>
network 24 may introduce jitter into the clocks of client devices such as client device<br>
26, thereby causing adverse affects such as video freezing, audio chirps and/or<br>
undesirable display color changes. As will be explained herein, the present invention<br>
utilizes an AC power source, such as one available in the home, to synchronize<br>
clocks for video and/or audio decoding, thereby helping minimize network jitter.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, a relevant portion of network server 22 of FIG. 1 is<br>
shown. As shown in FIG. 2, network server 22 includes an input interface 32, a tuner<br>
34, a transport processing unit 36, a clock recovery unit 38, a local clock 40, an AC<br>
clock counter 42, an AC controller 44 and a network interface 46.<br>
In operation, input interface 32 receives downlink signals from antenna 20.<br>
The received downlink signals include data such as audio and/or video data, and<br>
timing data such as System Clock Recovery ("SCR") information that is used by<br>
 network server 22 to frequency lock its local clock 40 to a reference clock at the<br>
transmission end. The signals received by input interface 32 may be in the form of<br>
transport packets. Although FIG. 2 shows input interface 32 as receiving signals from<br>
only one source (i.e., antenna 20), interface 32 may be configured to receive signals<br>
from a plurality of sources, such as satellite, cable, and/or other sources.<br><br>
Tuner 34 receives the downlink signals from input interface 32 and performs a<br>
tuning operation thereon to generate output signals. Transport processing unit 36<br>
receives the output signals from tuner 34 and performs a processing operation<br>
thereon which, among other things, separates the SCR information from the data<br>
signals. The data signals are provided to network interface 46 and ultimately<br>
transmitted as packetized data to client device 26 over network 24, and the SCR<br>
information is provided to clock recovery unit 38. Clock recovery unit 38 uses the<br>
SCR information to generate control signals that are used to control the frequency of<br>
a VCO (not shown) of local clock 40. In this manner, the SCR information is used by<br>
network server 22 to frequency lock local clock 40 to a reference clock at the<br>
transmission end, which according to an exemplary embodiment exhibits a frequency<br>
of approximately 27 MHz. As indicated in FIG. 2, a clock signal from local clock 40 is<br>
provided as timing information to transport processing unit 36.<br>
AC clock counter 42 receives (i) the clock signal from local clock 40, (ii) an AC<br>
power signal from a source such as a household wall jack, and (iii) a noise duration<br>
signal from AC controller 44. Based on these inputs, AC clock counter 42 generates<br>
an AC count value that is used to provide synchronization at client device 26 and<br>
thereby prevent the introduction of network jitter.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, further details regarding AC clock counter 42 of FIG.<br>
2 are shown. In particular, AC clock counter 42 includes a digital clock generator 50,<br>
a duration counter 52, and an AC count generator 54. As indicated in FIG. 3, digital<br>
clock generator 50 receives the AC power signal. Duration counter 52 receives<br>
outputs from digital clock generator 50 and the noise duration signal from AC<br>
controller 44. AC count generator 54 receives outputs from duration counter 52 and<br>
the clock signal from local clock 40. Outputs from AC count generator 54 are<br>
provided to network interface 46.<br>
In operation, digital clock generator 50 receives the AC power signal, and<br>
generates digital count values in dependence thereon. According to an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the AC power signal is a 60 Hz signal provided from a source such as a<br>
household wall jack and associated power line. It is recognized, however, that the<br><br>
AC power signal may exhibit a different frequency depending, for example, on<br>
geographical location (e.g., 50 Hz is used in Europe). Digital clock generator 50 is<br>
preferably embodied as a zero crossing circuit and buffer. Accordingly, digital clock<br>
generator 50 generates and buffers the digital count values as the received AC power<br>
signal oscillates relative to a zero crossing reference point. In the case of a<br>
sinusoidal AC power signal, the zero crossing reference point may, for example, be<br>
selected as the x-axis. In this manner, the digital count values generated by digital<br>
clock generator 50 represent a clock that is based on the frequency of the AC power<br>
signal.	<br>
Duration counter 52 receives the digital count values generated by digital clock<br>
generator 50, and further receives the noise duration signal from AC controller 44<br>
(see FIG. 2). The digital count values function as a clock input and enable duration<br>
counter 52 to count at a frequency corresponding to the frequency of the AC power<br>
signal. The noise duration signal represents a time duration over which the AC<br>
power signal is preferably observed to compensate for signal irregularities on the<br>
power line. That is, AC power signals provided via a household wall jack and<br>
associated power line often include noise spikes and other irregular characteristics<br>
that can render the signals ineffective for purposes of establishing a time base, if<br>
viewed over a relatively short time period. Accordingly, the noise duration signal<br>
represents a time duration over which the received AC power signals, viewed as a<br>
whole, are considered stable and reliable for purposes of establishing a time base.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment, the time duration represented by the noise<br>
duration signal is in the range of 5 to 10 minutes. Duration counter 52 uses the digital<br>
count values and the noise duration signal to generate and output a duration pulse.<br>
In particular, the duration pulse is a signal having a pulse width corresponding to the<br>
time duration represented by the noise duration signal.<br>
AC count generator 54 receives the duration pulse from duration counter 52,<br>
and further receives the clock signal from local clock 40 (see FIG. 2). Based on<br>
these inputs, AC count generator 54 generates the AC count value for network server<br>
22. More specifically, AC count generator 54 generates the AC count value by<br>
performing a counting operation (i) at a frequency corresponding to the clock signal of<br><br>
local clock 40, and (ii) for a duration corresponding to the duration pulse. Put another<br>
way, AC count generator 54 counts at the clock frequency of local clock 40 for a time<br>
period corresponding to the duration pulse, thereby generating the AC count value.<br>
For example, assuming the clock frequency of local clock 40 is 27 MHz, and the time<br>
period corresponding to the duration pulse is 8 minutes, the AC count value would be<br>
1.296 x 1010 (i.e., (27 x 106/second) x (8 minutes) x (60 seconds/minute)). This<br>
process of generating an AC count value is repeatedly performed, thus producing a<br>
new AC count value each time a time period corresponding to the duration pulse<br>
elapses. In this manner, AC count values are sequentially generated and provided to<br>
network interface 46 for transmission to client device 26 over network 24 (see FIGS.<br>
1 and 2). As will be explained further later herein, the AC count values are used to<br>
provide synchronization at client device 26, and thereby prevent the introduction of<br>
network jitter.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a relevant portion of client device 26 of FIG. 1 is<br>
shown. As shown in FIG. 4, client device 26 includes an input interface 60, a<br>
decoder 62, an AC controller 64, an AC clock recovery unit 66, and a local clock 68.<br>
As will be explained hereinafter, client device 26 receives and operates upon data<br>
provided from network server 22 via network 24 to generate, for example, an audio<br>
and/or video output via audio/video output device 28.<br>
In operation, input interface 60 receives from network server 22 via network 24<br>
packetized data including audio and/or video data, and timing data including the<br>
noise duration signal and the current AC count value. According to an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the audio and/or video data, and the timing data may be included<br>
together within individual data packets. However, according to another embodiment,<br>
the timing data may be included in data packets that are independent of the audio<br>
and/or video data packets. Decoder 62 receives the audio and/or video data from<br>
input interface 60, and performs a decoding operation thereon to generate decoded<br>
signals. Decoder 62 performs these operations in accordance with a clock signal<br>
from local clock 68 which, according to an exemplary embodiment, exhibits a<br>
frequency of approximately 27 MHz. The decoded signals generated by decoder 62<br><br>
are provided for further processing, and ultimately, output via audio/video output<br>
device 28 (see FIG. 1).<br>
AC controller 64 receives from input interface 60 the timing data including the<br>
noise duration signal and the current AC count value provided from network server<br>
22. AC clock recovery unit 66 receives (i) the noise duration signal and the current<br>
AC count value from AC controller 64, (ii) an AC power signal from a source such as<br>
a household wall jack, and (iii) the clock signal from local clock 68. Based on these<br>
inputs, AC clock recovery unit 66 generates yet another AC count value, and<br>
compares this AC count value with the AC count value provided by AC controller 64<br>
to enable synchronization at client device 26, thereby preventing the introduction of<br>
network jitter.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, further details regarding AC clock recovery unit 66 of<br>
FIG. 4 are shown. In particular, AC clock recovery unit 66 includes a digital clock<br>
generator 70, a duration counter 72, an AC count generator 74, and a processor 76.<br>
As indicated in FIG. 5, digital clock generator 70 receives the AC power signal.<br>
Duration counter 72 receives outputs from digital clock generator 70 and the noise<br>
duration signal from AC controller 64. AC count generator 74 receives outputs from<br>
duration counter 72 and the clock signal from local clock 68. Processor 76 receives<br>
outputs from AC count generator 74 and the AC count value from AC controller 64.<br>
Outputs from processor 76 are provided to local clock 68. As will become evident<br>
from the following description, AC clock recovery unit 66 of FIG. 5 is similar in<br>
construction and operation to AC clock counter 42 of FIG. 3.<br>
In operation, digital clock generator 70 receives the AC power signal, and<br>
-generates digital count values in dependence thereon. According to an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the AC power signal is a 60 Hz signal provided from a source such as a<br>
household wall jack and associated power line. Of course, the AC power signal may<br>
exhibit a different frequency depending, for example, on geographical location. Like<br>
digital clock generator 50 of FIG. 3, digital clock generator 70 is preferably embodied<br>
as a zero crossing circuit and buffer. Accordingly, digital clock generator 70<br>
generates and buffers the digital count values as the received AC power signal<br><br>
oscillates relative to a zero crossing reference point. In the case of a sinusoidal AC<br>
power signal, the zero crossing reference point may, for example, be selected as the<br>
x-axis. In this manner, the digital count values generated by digital clock generator<br>
70 represent a clock that is based on the frequency of the AC power signal.<br>
Duration counter 72 receives the digital count values generated by digital clock<br>
generator 70, and further receives the noise duration signal from AC controller 64.<br>
The digital count values function as a clock input and enable duration counter 72 to<br>
count at a frequency corresponding to the frequency of the AC power singal. This<br>
noise duration signal is the same noise duration signal used by duration counter 52 of<br>
FIG. 3, and accordingly represents the time duration over which the AC power signal<br>
is preferably observed to compensate for signal irregularities on the power line.<br>
Duration counter 72 uses the digital count values and the noise duration signal to<br>
generate and output a duration pulse. As previously indicated herein, the duration<br>
pulse is a signal having a pulse width corresponding to the time duration represented<br>
by the noise duration signal.<br>
AC count generator 74 receives the duration pulse from duration counter 72,<br>
and further receives the clock signal from local clock 68 (see FIG. 4). Based on<br>
these inputs, AC count generator 74 generates an AC count value for client device 26<br>
in the same manner as AC count generator 54 of FIG. 3 generated the AC count<br>
value for network server 22. That is, AC count generator 74 generates the AC count<br>
value for client device 26 by performing a counting operation (i) at a frequency<br>
corresponding to the clock signal of local clock 68, and (ii) for a duration<br>
corresponding to the duration pulse. Like AC count generator 54 of FIG. 3, AC count<br>
generator 74 of FIG. 5 generates AC count values in a repeated manner, thus<br>
producjng a new AC count value each time a time period corresponding to the<br>
duration pulse elapses.<br>
Processor 76 receives (i) the AC count value for client device 26 from AC<br>
count generator 74, and (ii) the AC count value for network server 22 from AC<br>
controller 64, and compares the two AC count values. Based on this comparison,<br>
processor 76 generates and outputs a control signal that drives a VCO (not shown) of<br><br>
local clock 68, thereby adjusting its output frequency. In this manner, processor 76<br>
continues to adjust the VCO of local clock 68 until the AC count value for client<br>
device 26 is equal to the AC count value for network server 22. Once these two AC<br>
count values are equal, local clocks 40 and 68 of network server 22 and client device<br>
26 are synchronized, and network jitter is prevented.<br>
As described herein, the present invention advantageously provides a scheme<br>
for achieving synchronization within a network, and thereby prevents the introduction<br>
of network jitter. While this invention has been described as having a preferred<br>
design, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of<br>
this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses,<br>
or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is<br>
intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known<br>
or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains and which fall within<br>
