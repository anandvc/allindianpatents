A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators, safeners and/or semiochemicals is also possible.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such or in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-to-use solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, tablets, pastes, microcapsules and granules. They are used in the customary manner, for example by watering, immersion, spraying, atomising, misting, vaporizing, injecting, forming a slurry, brushing on, dusting, scattering, dry dressing, moist dressing, wet dressing, slurry dressing or encrusting.<br>
In the treatment of parts of plants, the active compounds concentration in the use forms can be varied within a substantial range. They are, in general, from 1 to 0.0001% by weight, preferably from 0.5 and 0.001%.<br>
For the treatment of seed, amounts of active compound of 0.1 to 10 g, especially 1 to 5 g, are generally employed per 1 kilogram of seed.<br>
For the treatment of soil, active compound concentrations, at the point of action, of 0.00001 to 0.1% by weight, especially of 0.0001 to 0.02%, are generally employed.<br>
As already mentioned above, all plants and parts of plants can be treated according to the invention.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment naturally occurring plant species and plant varieties or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossbreeding or protoplast fusion as well as parts of such plants are treated. In an additional preferred embodiment transgenic plants and plant varieties which have been obtained by genetic engineering methods, possibly in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms) and parts of such plants are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants"" or "plant parts" is explained above.<br>
According to the invention plants of the plant varieties commercially available or used at any particular time are very preferably treated. Plant varieties are understood to be plants with specific properties ("traits") which have been obtained both by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques.    They can be varieties, biotypes or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the species or varieties of plants, their location and growth conditions (the types of soil, climate, vegetation period and feed concerned), superadditive ("synergistic") effects can occur as a result of the treatment according to the invention. Effects such as for example reduced application rates and/or broadening of the activity spectra and/or increased activity of the compounds and compositions usable according to the invention, improved plant growth, increased tolerance of high or low temperatures, increased tolerance of dry conditions or water or ground salt contents, increased flowering capacity, facilitated harvesting, acceleration of maturity, increased crop yields, higher quality and/or increased nutritional value of the harvested crops and increased storing quality and/or processibility of the harvested crops are possible, which are greater than those actually expected.<br>
Preferred transgenic plants or plant varieties (obtained by genetic engineering) to be treated according to the invention include all plants which as a result of the genetic modification concerned have received genetic material which provides them with particularly advantageous valuable properties ("traits"). Examples of such properties are improved plant growth, increased tolerance of high or low temperatures, increased tolerance of dry conditions or water or ground salt contents, increased flowering capacity, facilitated harvesting, acceleration of maturity, increased crop yields, higher quality and/or increased nutritional value of the harvested crops and increased storing quality and/or processibility of the harvested crops. Additional and particularly noteworthy examples of such properties are increased resistance of the plants to animal and microbial pests, such as to insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses as well as increased tolerance by the plants of certain herbicidal active compounds. Examples which may be mentioned of transgenic plants are the important crop plants such as cereals (wheat and rice), corn, soybeans, potatoes, cotton, rape and fruit plants (producing apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), the crop plants corn, soybeans, potatoes, cotton and rape being particularly noteworthy. Particularly significant properties ("traits") are increased resistance of the plants to insects due to<br><br>
the toxins forming in the plants, and in particular those which are produced in the plants (hereinafter referred to as "Bt plants") by the genetic material obtained from Bacillus Thuringiensis (e.g. by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Ciy2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and combinations thereof). Particularly significant properties ("traits") are the increased resistance of plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses due to systemically acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Particulary significant properties ("traits") are also increased tolerance by the plants of certain herbicidal active compounds, such as for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricine (e.g. the "PAT" gene). The corresponding genes imparting the required properties ("traits") can also occur in the transgenic plants in combination with each other. Examples which may be mentioned of "Bt plants" are varieties of corn, cotton, soybeans and potatoes which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (e.g. corn, cotton, soybeans), KnockOut® (e.g. corn), StarLink® (e.g. corn), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potatoes). Examples which may be mentioned of herbicide-tolerant plants are varieties of corn, cotton and soybeans which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance of glyphosate, e.g. corn, cotton, soybeans), Liberty Link® (tolerance of phosphinotricine, e.g. rape), HVH® (tolerance of imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance of sulphonylureas, e.g. corn). Herbicide-resistant plants (bred for herbicide tolerance in the conventional manner) which may be mentioned are also the varieties (e.g. corn) sold under the name Clearfield®. The above statements do of course also apply to any plant varieties which may be developed in the future or launched onto the market in the future and which have the genetic properties ("traits") described above or developed in the future.<br>
According to the invention the above-mentioned plants can be particularly advantageously treated with the compounds of the general formula I or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges mentioned above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particularly advantageous is the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically listed in the present text.<br>
