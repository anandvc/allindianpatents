				<td>Brake Control Systems for Vehicles<br>
State of the art of technology<br>
The following invention relates to a brake control system for vehicles. Brake control systems for vehicles in different designs are known from the state of art of technology. Known brake control systems are for instance, ABS-System, ESP-system, TCS-system (TCS = Traction control system) or APB-System (Automatic Park-brake system). In order to enhance the drive safety such systems are applied in the recent time in an increasing manner. As a result of this however, the cars as well as the weight of the vehicle go up. Moreover, such brake control systems require a certain design space which under given circumstances is available only to a limited extent. Further such brake control systems in the recent time are being used increasingly in middle-class vehicles and small cars, with the result however that the price of such vehicles increase.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
The invention based brake control system with the characteristics of the patent claim 1, in contrast, has the advantage that it can be manufactured cost-effectively and requires lesser number of components for fabrication. Further, the weight of the brake control systems as well as the necessary design space can be reduced. This is achieved as per the invention thereby that precisely one pumping element is visualized. The pumping element is so designed that it sucks from a first and a second suction line which is separate from the first<br><br>
suction line and conveys in a first and a second delivery pipe /line, similarly separate from the first delivery line / pipe, in other words, one pumping element precisely conveys fluid from a first suction line in a first delivery line and from a second suction line in a second delivery line. In deviation to the state of art of technology, in which always two or more pumping elements are essential, according to the invention only precisely one single pumping element is required.<br>
The sub-claims show preferred further developments /designs of the invention.<br>
In order to make available the pumping element especially cost-effectively, the pumping element is preferably designed as a piston pump. Especially ideally, the pumping element encompasses a differential piston. Another possibility is the use of a dual-effect piston.<br>
Ideally, the piston of the pumping element has a first compressed / pressure surface for enhancing the pressure in a first pressure chamber and a second compressed / pressure surface for enhancing the pressure in a second pressure chamber. In order to maintain an identical conveying height, one parameter of the first area / surface is preferably identical to a parameter of the second pressure surface.<br>
As per an additional preferred design of the invention the piston of the pumping element is driven with the use of an ex-center.<br>
Preferably, re-setting of the piston takes place with the use of a re-setting element, which is provided for in the first and /or in the second pressure chamber.<br>
Preferably, the single pumping element conveys simultaneously fluid in both the delivery lines. As a result of this, an especially short operational duration of the pumping element is guaranteed.<br><br>
In order to prevent an unintended reverse flow of fluid, in the first and second suction line and in the first and second delivery line, check valves are respectively arranged.<br>
The invention based brake control system can be used in a ABS-system, ESP-system or TCS system.<br>
Preferred design examples of the invention are described in detail in the following, taking reference to the drawing<br>
The drawings show:<br>
Fig 1 a schematic view of an ABS-control system as per a first design example of<br>
the above invention<br>

Fig 3 a schematic view of a brake control system as per a second design<br>
example of the above invention, and<br>
Fig 4 a schematic view of a brake control system as per a third design example<br>
of the above invention<br>
Description of the Design Examples<br>
In the following an ABS-control system is described under reference to figures 1 and 2, based on a first design example of the invention. The invention based ABS-control system encompasses a first brake circuit I and a second brake circuit II, which are arranged in an X-Brake circuit configuration. The first brake circuit I includes a left rear wheel brake LR and a right front wheel brake RF. The second brake circuit II includes a left front wheel brake LF and a right rear wheel brake RR. Each of the four wheel brakes LR, RF, LF and RR is assigned to an inlet valve EV1, EV2, EV3 and /or EV 4 and an outlet valve AV1, AV2, AV3<br><br>
and/or AV4. The inlet valves are connected with a main brake cylinder 12 which can be actuated with the use of a brake peddle 13. In this design example, the inlet valves and the outlet valves are respectively magnet valves. Further, on the inlet valves, a by-pass in form of a check valve is visualized.<br>
The outlet valves are meant for a pressure reduction at the wheel brakes. The outlet valves AV 1 and AV2 lead to a first suction line 3a and the outlet valves AV3 and AV4 lead to a second suction line 3b. Further, the invention based ABS-Control system includes precisely one pumping element 2 which is connected to the suction line 3a and 3b. Further, the pumping element 2 is connected with a first delivery line 4a and a second delivery line 4b. The suction lines 3a and 3b are led separately to the single pumping element 2 of the control system, and the fluid sucked through the first suction line 3a is conveyed in the first delivery line 4a, and the fluid sucked through the second suction line is conveyed in the second delivery line 4b. The pumping element 2 in this context is so designed that it enables the conveying of the liquid separately for each brake circuit. Hereby, it is prevented that fluid from the first brake circuit I lands in the second brake circuit II and vice-versa.<br>
The pumping element 2 is illustrated in detail in figure 2. As is evident from figure2, the pumping element 12 is a piston pump with a piston 5, which is driven by an ex-center 11. The piston 5 is designed as differential piston and has a first pressure surface 6 and a second pressure surface 7. In order to enable a uniform conveying in both brake circuits of a diagonally divided braking system, the surfaces of both the pressure surfaces 6 and 7 are of equal size. In order to facilitate a uniform conveying in both brake circuits of a braking system divided into a first axle and rear axle, both the surfaces of the two pressure surfaces 6 and 7 can be designed in different sizes respectively to each other. The first suction line 3a leads to a first pressure chamber 8 and the second suction line 3b leads to a second pressure chamber. The first and the second pressure chambers 8 and 9 are therefore designed such that the volume of both the<br><br>
pressure chambers is identical. As shown in figure 2, the first delivery line 4a is connected with the first pressure chamber 8 and the second delivery line 4b with the second pressure chamber 9. A sealing element 16 makes the first pressure chamber 8 leak-proof against the second pressure chamber 9 and a sealing element 17 makes the second pressure chamber 9 leak-proof against the ex-center chamber /room.<br>
As per the invention therefore, merely one pumping element 2 is visualized which enables a separate reverse conveying of liquid in first brake circuit 1 through the lines 3a and 4a and in second brake circuit II through the lines 3b and 4b. To prevent a liquid reverse flow in the lines, in each suction line 3a, 3b and in each delivery line 4a, 4b a check valve 18 is respectively provided. The check vale 18 can be arranged integrally in a housing of a pumping element 2. As a result of this an especially compact assembly of the pumping element 2 can be obtained. For resetting the piston pipe, a spring element 14 in form of a spiral spring is visualized in second pressure chamber 9. The flow direction in the lines is denoted in figure 2 with arrow A and/or arrow B.<br>
Thus as per the invention it is possible to plan for merely a single pumping element 2 in the connection plan of the ABS-Control system. The cost, the design size and the weight of the control system can be thereby reduced. The single pumping element 2 is in this context so designed that it can be connected with separate suction lines 3a, 3b and separate delivery line 4a and 4b. A necessary control intervention during the braking operation can thereby be carried out without any negative effects. Hereby, individual wheel brakes or optional combinations of wheel brakes can be controlled without any problem.<br>
Taking reference to figure 3, a control piston as per a second design example of the invention is described below. The control system show in figure 3 is a TCS-system for controlling the traction. In this design example components which are<br><br>
identical or having identical functions as in the case of the previous design example are identified with the same reference number.<br>
As can be seen from figure 3, the TCS-systems covers similarly, only precisely one pumping element 2. The pumping element 2 is designed identical to the first design example and is jointed through the suction lines 3a and 3b with the outlet valves AV1, AV2 of the first brake circuit I or the outlet valve AV3, AV4 of the second brake circuit II. The first delivery line a from the pumping element is connected with a line segment L1 of the first brake circuit I which lies between a reversing valve 10a and the inlet valve EV2 for the right front wheel brake RF. The second delivery line 4b is jointed with a delivery segment L2, which lies between a second reversing valve 10b and inlet valve EV3. The inlet valve EV2 and EV3 are responsible for the supply of pressure to the wheel brakes at the front wheels, so that through the inlet valves EV2 and EV3 and the reversing valve 10a, 10b, a traction control in a vehicle with front wheel drive is possible. Further, suction valves 19a or 19b in the first or second brake circuit is arranged in an already known fashion. Moreover, check valves 20a or 20b are arranged in first brake circuit I or second brake circuit II, after the outlet valves.<br>
Thus, the TCS-Control system of the second design example also has a simple and cost-effective structure with lesser weight and reduced design size.<br>
Taking reference to figure 4, a control system as per a third design example of an invention is described below, whereby identical or functionally identical components are identified again with the same reference number as in the previous design examples. The control system shown in figure 4 is an ESP-system.<br>
As in the case of the previous control systems, the ESP-System of the third design example similarly has precisely only one pumping element 2. The pumping element 2 is designed again as in figure 2 and enables a separate<br><br>
conveying in first or second brake circuit. The third design example corresponds largely to the structure of the second design example, where differently to it the first delivery line 4a is connected additionally also with the first inlet valve EV 1, and the second delivery line 4b additionally with the fourth inlet valve EV4, in order to be able to carry out the ESP-Control functions in all four wheel brakes. Othenwise, this design example corresponds to the previous design examples, so that the description provided for them could also apply here.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
