AQUEOUS FUNGICIDAL FORMULATION<br>
INDOFIL CHEMICALS CO.<br>
 (a division of MODIPON LTD.)<br>
an Indian Company<br>
of Nirlon House, Dr. Annie Besant Road, Mumbai 400 025,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
This invention relates to an improved process of preparation of an aqueous fungicidal<br>
formulation with excellent suspension properties and more particularly, fo the preparation of aqueous formulation of Mancozeb having an extremely low Ethyelene Thiourea content.<br>
BACK GROUND<br>
Mancozeb is a well - known fungicide and its method of preparation is described in US 1000137 . Mancozeb, or zinc salt of Maneb, is a result of various experiments carried out by different people to stabilize Maneb. Several references are cited which describe methods to stabilize Maneb such as US 3856836, US 2974156, US 3173832, which quote the use of formaldehyde, soluble zinc salts and Hexamethylene tetra amine to stabilize the formulation .<br>
Mancozeb, technically is a Zinc Manganese salt of Ethylene bisdithiocarbamate (IUPAC Manganese ethylene bis (dithiocarbamate) (polymeric) complex). Compositions containing Mancozeb have been used for a long time in agriculture and horticulture for combating and / controlling injury to plants from fungal diseases. Generally the compositions are diluted in water prior to application and are sprayed on plants / fruit trees.<br>
Various formulations types of Mancozeb include wet table powders, aqueous suspension concentrate and water dispersible granules.<br>
It is very important that the pesticide formulated have good suspension characteristics. The practices of Indian farming where mixing of agricultural chemical into the tank mix is still at a rudimentary stage, and the use of sophisticated technologies of mixing and spraying are not affordable by the farmer, it becomes doubly important that the pesticide remains in uniform suspension until the period farmer sprays the chemical onto his fields.<br>
2<br><br>
This invention creates a formulation of Mancozeb with very high suspensibility features, low viscosity and caking issues.<br>
Mancozeb has a higher stability when compared with individual salts that is Manganese or Zinc salt of ethylene bisdithiocarbamate.<br>
According to that process, Mancozeb can be prepared by reaction of a manganese soluble salt with disodium salt or dipotassium salt of ethylene bisdithiocarbamate, which is further treated with a soluble zinc salt , formaldehyde. Alternatively, mancozeb can be prepared by precipitating ammonium ethylene bisdithiocarbamate (Amobam) with manganese salt and further treating it with soluble zinc salt. Nab am is the preferred salt because it yields maneb of lowest ETU content.<br>
Usually, soluble ethylene bisdithiocarbamate is prepared by reacting together carbon disulfide, ethylene diamine and sodium hydroxide. The exact order of mixing of these products is not critical although some orders may be more convenient than others and lead to a higher concentrations of aqueous solutions of ethylene bisdithiocarbamate, these solutions being preferred for shipping and handling and also more stable than diluted solutions .<br>

DRAW BACKS<br>
The formulations prepared above have drawbacks such as caking, high viscosity and low suspensiblity.<br>
Mancozeb being a molecule displaying a thixotropy in aqueous conditions under varying degrees of temperature and humidity increases in viscosity parameter makes the formulation difficult to pour from application point of view. Further caking problem is encountered and the formulation cannot be shaken back into a suspension<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes a process of preparation of mancozeb suspension concentrate formulation having high suspension characteristics. Unlike all the other processes where the product of interest is prepared from maneb slurry, this process employs mancozeb in a powder form. The route for synthesis of Mancozeb, is in accordance to our patented process FN 186435. The trick of formulating the product with the above properties lies in thixotropy and viscosity issues not settling in during  the process of formulation .<br>
Further, the addition of suspending agent takes place at two stages, one the dry stage, to ensure complete coverage of the particles with the suspending agent to reduce the electro kinetic effect, and two, at the wet end , to give the formulation increased suspension characteristics .<br>
A homogenization stage followed by Wet milling of the formulation using wetting, dispersing, anticaking and suspensibility enhancing agents is carried out to get the formulation into its final form.<br>
The dithiocarbamates in aqueous formulation have various salts of dithiocarbamic acids in different concentrations ranging form 10 to 65%. Preferably, the dithiocarbamates are one or more components selected from ethylene bisdithiocarbamic acid, its alkali salt or<br>
6<br><br>
transition metal salt and its complexes. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention, the ethylene bisdithiocarbamate has Manganese and Zinc as metal ions. Typically, the particulate composition has a particle range of 1 to 5 microns. The reduction in particle size is affected by subjecting the homogenized mixture to grinding media.<br>
In addition to the active ingredient component the ingredients will normally include a surfactant component and optionally other components such as filler component to provide the desired active ingredient content and / or a suspending agent / wetting agent.<br>
The term surfactant is used in the broad sense to include materials which may be referred to as emulsifying agents, dispersing agents and wetting agents and the surfactant component may comprise one or more surfactant selected from the anionic, nonionic type.<br>
Examples of surfactants of the anionic type include sodium dodecyl benzene sulphoante, sodium, calcium  or ammonium lignosulphoante,  sodium     formaldehyde condensates polymer salt, (Lomar D), Naphthalene formaldehyde condensate sodium salt (Morwet D 425 [tm])<br>
Suitable non ionic type include for example condensation products of ethylene oxide with alkyl phenols such as octyl phenol, nonyl phenol.<br>
Preferably the surfactant component will comprise at least one wetting agent such as those selected from alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, phosphate esters , and / or at least one dispersing agent such as those selected from the group of naphthalene condensates, ligno sulfonates.<br>
Typically the total surfactant component will comprise from 2 to 20% and preferably from 3 to 10% by weight of the dry weight of the composition.<br>
The dispersions or solutions can also contain adhesives, such as for example starch syrup, dextrose, sucrose, dextrin, poly vinyl acetate, Xanthan gum.<br>
7<br><br>
In addition the Suspension concentrates can contain antifreeze agents such as glycerin, glycols, silica. It also contains antifoaming agents such as silicone antifoaming agent.<br>

Determination of Suspensibility<br>
Suspensibility of the samples was determined with CIPAC standard water D as per the<br>
procedure of CIPAC method MT 161.<br>
Out line of Method<br>
A suspension of known concentration of the test item was prepared in CIPAC Standard<br>
Water D, placed in a measuring cylinder at a constant temperature and allowed to remain<br>
undisturbed for the specified time. The top 9/10ths were drawn off and the content of solids<br>
in the sediments in the bottom 1710th was determined.<br>
Determination of Active content<br>
is as per CIPAC 34/TC/M/3 (volume H)<br>
14<br><br>
Determination of Manganese and Zinc<br>
is as per CIPAC 34/TC/M/4 (volume H)<br>
In the all the examples mentioned above, suspensibility greater than 95% is obtained due to better particle size reduction .<br>

BIOEFFICACY TESTS OF MANCOZEB FLOWABLE<br>
1) Study was carried out by Tamilnadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore to test the Bio-efficacy of Mancozeb Flowable against downy mildew of grapes (paneer variety) for one season Rabi 2002. Chemicals used and their doses were Mancozeb Flowable 0.4% (3.0 ml/lit), Mancozeb Flowable 0.5% ( 3.8 ml/lit) and Mancozeb Flowable 0.6% (4.6 ml/lit) and one standard fungicide Mancozeb 0.25% (2.5 g/lit).<br>
Plot sizes used for the study was five vines spaced at 3 X 3 m per treatment per replication and for three replications. Control plot was left untreated.<br>
The first spray was given immediately after disease appearance, which was one month after pruning. Three subsequent rounds of sprays were given at 10 days intervals. The observation on downy mildew incidence on leaf and berries was recorded using 0-9 scale and the percent disease index (PDI) was calculated.<br>
18<br><br>
IT was found that all the treatments significantly reduced the disease on leaves when compared to untreated control. Among the treatments, Mancozeb Flowable ( 0.6% ) recorded minimum disease on leaves , PDI being 13.37 followed by Mancozeb 0.5%, PDI being 18.15 and Mancozeb 0.4% - PDI 20.48. Standard fungicidal Mancozeb 0.25% recorded PDI of 22.45%. Similar trend was also noticed in case of fruit infection. Treatment with Mancozeb Flowable 0.6 % also resulted in maximum yield of fruits ( 17220.5 kg/ha) as compared to other treatments and untreated control.<br>
2)Bio-efficacy testing of Mancozeb Flowable was carried out by Tamilnadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore against Late Blight ( Phytophthora infestans ) of Potato for one season - Main, 1999. Chemicals used were Mancozeb Flowable 0.4%, Mancozeb Flowable 0.5% and Mancozeb Flowable 0.6% and one standard fungicide Mancozeb wettable powder 0.25%. Potatoes of Kufri Jyoti variety were planted in a plot size of 10 sq.m. with 20 X 45 cm spacing. Six rounds of sprayings were done on appearance of the disease. The Late blight disease incidence was found to be on par in the treatments with Mancozeb Flowable at 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 per cent and Mancozeb wettable 0.25% and the mean disease grades on a 0-9 scale were 1.9, 1.9, 2.0 and 2.1 respectively. The highest mean disease grade of 3.0 was recorded b untreated control. All the treatments were on par with regard to yield except untreated control whereby the yield was approximately 60 % lesser than the treated crop.<br>
3) Field experiments were conducted during kharif season of 2001-02 to study effect of fungicides on Banana Sigatoka caused by fungus Mycosphaerella musicola. The fungicides tested were Mancozeb Flowable (0.4, 0.5 &amp; 0.6 %), Mancozeb wettable powder, emulsified formulation of propiconazole 25% and Hexaconazole 5%. The experiments were conducted during the rainy days in a randomized block design with 8 treatments and 3 replications using highly susceptible varieties of banana in Karnataka, Tamilnadu and Andhra Pradesh. Three- four sprays were given at 20-30 days intervals when initial typical disease symptoms were observed using high volume sprayer. Observations on the leaves were taken using 0-5 scale.<br>
19<br><br>
This investigation revealed that Mancozeb Flowable has shown more effective control of Banana Sigatoka than Mancozeb wettable powder among contact fungicides. Because of its very high suspensibility, smaller and uniform particle size, faster resuspensibility and high efficacy, Mancozeb can be used by farmers to get economical disease control.<br>
4) Another study was carried out by National research centre for Banana, Trichy for two<br>
season viz.  2000-2001  and 2002-2003 to find out the efficacy and most effective<br>
concentration of Mancozeb Flowable against Sigatoka leaf spot disease of Banana. The<br>
chemicals used were Mancozeb Flowable 0.5%, Mancozeb Flowable 0.6%, Indofil M-45<br>
(0.25%) and carbendazim (0.1%).<br>
The experiments were conducted in a randomized block design with 5 treatments and 4<br>
replications each on a plot of approximately one acre.<br>
First spray was given as low volume spray using Power sprayer (200 liters per acre) and<br>
three subsequent sprays were of high volume using rocker sprayer (450 liters / acre) at 15-<br>
28 days interval.<br>
The disease severity was recorded at the end of the treatment as per the Int. Musa Testing<br>
Prog. G.uidelines. Yield parameters and YLS ( youngest leaf spotted) were recorded and<br>
cost benefit ratios were analysed.<br>
Mancozeb Flowable sprayed plots recorded lowest disease severity, highest finger number<br>
and highest bunch weight. Additional yield per bunch was 5.3 kg and additional yield per<br>
acre was calculated to be 6360 kg providing a cost benefit of 36 as compared to unsprayed<br>
control. Results were found to be better for 0.6% than 0.5% concentration.<br>
None of the doses of Mancozeb Flowable tested showed any type of phytotoxicity<br>
symptom.<br>
The experiment was continued for the second season and the results of the first season were<br>
confirmed.<br>
20<br><br>
5)	A study carried out by University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad tested the efficacy<br>
of Mancozeb Flowable against Sigatoka spot disease of Banana cv. Rajapuri. The<br>
chemicals used were :<br>
Mancozeb Flowable	- 0.38 %<br>
Mancozeb Flowable	- 0.46 %<br>
Mancozeb WP	-0.25%<br>
Carbendazim	0.10%<br>
Companion	0.20 %<br>
Mineral oil	5. 0 %<br>
The experiments were conducted in a randomized block design with 6 treatments and 3<br>
replications each on a plot of approximately one acre.<br>
First spray was given as low volume spray using Power sprayer (200 liters per acre) and<br>
three subsequent sprays were of high volume using rocker sprayer (450 liters / acre) at 25-<br>
35 days interval.<br>
The mean data revealed that the lowest leaf spot index was recorded in the plants treated<br>
with Mancozeb 0.46%, highest being in the untreated control.<br>
Maximum yield was also found in the plants sprayed with Mancozeb 0.46%.<br>
6)	Similar study carried out by Bidhan Chandra Krishia Vishwavidyalaya, tested the bio-<br>
efficacy of Mancozeb Flowable against late and early blight of potato, late and early blight<br>
of tomato and downy mildew of cucurbit.<br>
Results clearly indicated that disease incidence and severity were reduced and yield of increased by spraying Mancozeb Flowable than in the control plot.<br>
The lowest disease incidence, disease severity and maximum yield were obtained by treatment with MZB Flowable 0.6% followed by MZB Flowable 0.5%, MZB Flowable 0.4%, MZB 75 WP 0.25%, MZB Flowable 0.3 and MAtcoO.25%.%<br>
