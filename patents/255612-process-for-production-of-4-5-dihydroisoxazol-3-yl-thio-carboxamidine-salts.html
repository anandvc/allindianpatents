thus the method is very useful as an industrial<br>
production method.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Now, the method for producing a (4,5-<br>
dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)thiocarboxamidine salt compound<br>
according to the above (1) to (7) will be described.<br>
The method of the present invention is a method for<br>
producing a (4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)thiocarboxamidine<br>
salt compound of the formula (2) in a short time and in<br>
good yield by reacting a 3-halogeno-4,5-dihydroisoxazole<br><br>
compound of the formula (1) with thiourea, which is<br>
characterized in that an acid is used for the reaction.<br>
The (4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)thiocarboxamidine salt<br>
compound obtained by this reaction is a novel compound<br>
and is a good raw material for the production of an<br>
alkali metal salt of a 4,5-dihydroisoxazolidine-3-thiol<br>
compound which is an intermediate for pharmaceuticals and<br>
agricultural chemicals.<br>
Firstly, the raw material compound of the formula<br>
(1) to be used as a raw material in the method of the<br>
present invention, will be described.<br>
A notation such as "C1-6" to be used in this<br>
specification indicates that, in this case, the number of<br>
carbon atoms in the substituent following this notation<br>
is from 1 to 6.<br>
In the formula (1), each of R1 and R2 which are<br>
independent of each other, is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl<br>
group or a cycloalkyl group, each of R3 and R4 which are<br>
independent of each other, is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl<br>
group, provided that R1 and R2, or R2 and R3, may be<br>
bonded to each other to form a cycloalkyl group, together<br>
with the carbon atoms to which they are bonded.<br>
Here, the alkyl group is preferably a linear or<br>
branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and<br>
may, for example, be a methyl group, an ethyl group, a n-<br>
propyl group, an isopropyl group, a n-butyl group, an<br>
isobutyl group, a sec-butyl group, a tert-butyl group, a<br><br>
n-pentyl group, an isopentyl group, a neopentyl group, a<br>
n-hexyl group, an isohexyl group or a 3,3-dimethylbutyl<br>
group.<br>
The cycloalkyl group is preferably an alkyl group<br>
having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms (a C3-6 cycloalkyl group)<br>
and may, for example, be a cyclopropyl group, a<br>
cyclopentyl group or a cyclohexyl group.<br>
With respect to preferred substituents in the<br>
formula (1) of the present invention, each of R1 and R2<br>
which are independent of each other, is a C1-6 alkyl<br>
group, and more preferred R1 or R2 is a methyl group or<br>
an ethyl group, and each of R3 and R4 is preferably a<br>
hydrogen atom.<br>
In the formula (1), X1 is a halogen.<br>
Here, the halogen represents a halogen such as<br>
bromine, chlorine, fluorine or iodine.<br>
The 3-halogeno-4,5-dihydroisoxazole compound of the<br>
formula (1) to, be used in the method of the present<br>
invention, may be any compound so long as it is a<br>
compound represented by the formula (1). Specifically,<br>
3-chloro-5,5-dimethyl-4,5-dihydroisoxazole or 3-bromo-<br>
5,5-dimethyl-4,5-dihydroisoxazole may, for example, be<br>
mentioned as a representative example.<br>
The 3-halogeno-4,5-dihydroisoxazole compound of the<br>
formula (1) is a known compound or a compound which can<br>
be produced by subjecting a halogeno oxime compound and a<br>
corresponding olefin compound to a 1,3-dipolar<br><br>
cycloaddition reaction in accordance with a known method.<br>
The reaction in the method of the present invention<br>
is carried out by using thiourea. The amount of thiourea<br>
to be used, may be at any level so long as the reaction<br>
proceeds sufficiently. However, it is, for example,<br>
within a range of from 1.0 to 100 mols, preferably from<br>
1.0 to 10 mols, more preferably from 1.0 to 2 mols, per<br>
mol of the 3-halogeno-4,5-dihydroisoxazole compound of<br>
the formula (1). In this reaction, 1 mol of thiourea to<br>
1 mol of the 3-halogeno-4,5-dihydroisoxazole compound of<br>
the formula (1) will be 1 equivalent.<br>
The reaction in the method of the present invention<br>
is carried out in the presence of an acid. The acid<br>
useful may, for example, be an organic acid represented<br>
by an organic sulfonic acid such as p-toluene sulfonic<br>
acid, methane sulfonic acid or benzene sulfonic acid; or<br>
an inorganic acid including a hydrohalogenic acid<br>
represented by hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, or<br>
sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid. These acids may be<br>
used alone or in combination as a mixture. Preferred is<br>
a hydrohalogenic acid such as hydrochloric acid or<br>
hydrobromic acid, and particularly preferred is<br>
hydrochloric acid which is inexpensive and simple in<br>
handling. When hydrochloric acid is to be used, the<br>
concentration is usually from 1 to 37%, preferably from<br>
35 to 37%, although it depends also on the temperature.<br>
The anionic residue derived from such an acid may, for<br><br>
example, be an organic anion such as a p-toluene<br>
sulfonyloxyanion, a methane sulfonyloxyanion or a benzene<br>
sulfonyloxyanion, a halogen anion such as a chloroanion,<br>
a bromoanion or an iodoanion, or an inorganic anion such<br>
as sulfuric anion, a hydrogen sulfate anion, a phosphoric<br>
anion, a dihydrogen phosphate anion or a monohydrogen<br>
phosphate anion.<br>
The amount of the acid to be used for the reaction<br>
in the method of the present invention may be any amount<br>
so long as it is an amount whereby the reaction proceeds<br>
sufficiently. However, it is usually from 0.05 to 100<br>
mols, preferably from 0.1 to 10 mols, more preferably<br>
from 0.5 to 1.5 mols, per mol of the 3-halogeno-4,5-<br>
dihydroisoxazole compound of the formula (1).<br>
The solvent which may be used for the reaction in<br>
the method of the present invention may be any solvent so<br>
long as it does not hinder the reaction. It may, for<br>
example, be water; an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol<br>
or isopropyl alcohol; an aromatic hydrocarbon such as<br>
toluene, xylene or chlorobenzene; a halogenated aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane or chloroform; an<br>
aliphatic acid ester represented by an acetic acid ester<br>
such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate or butyl acetate; a<br>
ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) or<br>
methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK); an aprotic polar solvent<br>
such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF),<br>
dimethylacetamide (DMAC), N-methylpyrrolidone,<br><br>
tetramethylurea, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) or<br>
propylene carbonate; an ether type solvent such as ethyl<br>
ether, isopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; or an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane or n-hexane.<br>
These solvents may be used alone or in combination<br>
as a mixed solvent with an optional mixing ratio. For<br>
example, if the present reaction is carried out in a<br>
mixed solvent system having a solvent having a high<br>
polarity such as an alcohol such as isopropyl alcohol,<br>
mixed with a solvent having a low polarity, the reaction<br>
will be accelerated, and in many cases, good results can<br>
be obtained such that the reaction time can be shortened,<br>
and the yield will be improved.<br>
The amount of such a solvent may be at such a level<br>
that stirring of the reaction system can be sufficiently<br>
carried out. However, the solvent is usually in an<br>
amount within a range of from 0.05 to 10 liters,<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 2 liters, per mol of the 3-<br>
halogeno-4,5-dihydroisoxazole compound of the formula<br>
(1) .<br>
The temperature for the reaction in the method of<br>
the present invention may, for example, be within a range<br>
of from 0°C to the reflux temperature of the solvent to<br>
be used, preferably within a range of from 2 0°C to 50°C.<br>
The time for the reaction in the method of the<br>
present invention is not particularly limited, but it is<br>
preferably from one hour to 10 hours from the viewpoint<br><br>
of suppression of by-products, etc.<br>
By the method of the present invention, the (4,5-<br>
dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)thiocarboxamidine salt compound of<br>
the formula (2) will be formed highly selectively under a<br>
mild condition without requiring a special reaction<br>
apparatus. The (4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-<br>
yl)thiocarboxamidine salt compound obtained by the method<br>
of the present invention, can easily be led to a 4,5-<br>
dihydroisoxazolidine-3-thiol analogue useful as an<br>
intermediate for the production of pharmaceuticals and<br>
agricultural chemicals, by carrying out hydrolysis under<br>
a basic condition.<br>
Now, the compound of the present invention (the<br>
(4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)thiocarboxamidine salt<br>
compound) as defined in (8) to (12), will be described.<br>
The compound of the present invention can be<br>
produced by the method as described in the above (1) to<br>
(7) .<br>
Here, in a case where the acid used for the<br>
production of the compound of the present invention is a<br>
polybasic acid such as sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid,<br>
the compound of the present invention has a number of the<br>
(4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)thiocarboxamidine structure<br>
(the structure drawn in the brackets [] in the formula<br>
(2)) corresponding to the valence of such a polybasic<br>
acid. Even in such a case, the structure of the (4,5-<br>
dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)thiocarboxamidine salt compound is<br><br>
represented by the formula (2) irrespective of the<br>
valence of such an acid (X2H).<br>
Further, in a case where in the production of the<br>
compound of the present invention, as the acid, a<br>
hydrohalogenic acid having the same halogen as X1 of the<br>
3-halogeno-4,5-dihydroisoxazole compound of the formula<br>
(1) to be used as a raw material, is used alone, the acid<br>
represented by X2H in the formula (2) represents a single<br>
acid. However, in a case where an acid having a halogen<br>
or an anionic residue different from X1 in the formula<br>
(1), is used, or in a case where two or more acids are<br>
used, the acid (the acid represented by X2H in the<br>
formula (2)) which the compound of the present invention<br>
has, may be a mixture having two or more acids mixed, and<br>
the compound of the present invention is one which<br>
includes a salt having such two or more acids mixed.<br>
Specific examples of the compound of the present<br>
invention will be exemplified in the following Table 1,<br>
but it should be understood that the compound of the<br>
present invention is not limited to such exemplified<br>
compounds and includes all of the compounds represented<br>
by the formula (2).<br>
The abbreviations in Table 1 have the following<br>
meanings, respectively.<br>
Me: methyl group<br>
Et: ethyl group<br>
Pr: n-propyl group<br><br>
iPr: isopropyl group<br>
Bu: n-butyl group<br>
cHex: cyclohexyl group<br><br>
Now, the method for producing the compound of the<br>
present invention will be described in detail with<br>
reference to Examples. However, it should be understood<br>
that the present invention is by no means restricted to<br>
such Examples.<br>

dimethyl-4,5-dihydroisoxazole<br><br>
In 5 00 ml of ethanol, 63.0 g (0.75 mol) of sodium<br>
hydrogen carbonate was added, followed by stirring at<br>
room temperature. While 84.2 g (1.50 mol) of isobutene<br>
gas was blown thereinto, upon expiration of 0.5 hour, the<br>
temperature was raised to 70°C, and then, 131.3 g (0.5<br>
mol) of a 40% isopropyl ether solution of dichloroform<br>
oxime, was gradually dropwise added to the reaction<br>
solution, followed by stirring at the same temperature<br>
for 8 hours. The reaction solution was left to cool to<br>
at most 25°C, and an inorganic solid was removed by<br>
filtration, followed by distillation under reduced<br>
pressure at 62°C/1.1 kPa, to obtain 32.3 g (yield: 51%)<br>
