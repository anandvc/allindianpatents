DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION In figure 1, there is shown a basic diagram of a triggering circuit 10 according   to  the   invention   for   an   insulated   gate   semiconductor device      12   such   as   a   metal   oxide   semiconductor   field   effect transistor {MOSFET).<br>
in the diagram a power MOSFET is shown and which is available from International Rectifier under the trademark HEXFET number IRF740.     A 10% to 90% rise time of an output voltage? is specified<br><br>
in publicly available user data sheets of the device as being about 27ns and a corresponding fall time is specified as being in the order of 24ns. These times may be too long for some applications of the MOSFET. The turn-on delay time is specified at 14ns and the turn-off delay time as 50ns.<br>
The triggering circuit 10 comprises a charge storage device in the form of a capacitor 14 having first and second terminals 14.1   and<br>
14,2 respectively. The first terminal 14.1 is connected in a circuit 17        <br><br>
to a fast switching device 16. An optional inductor 18 is connected    between the fast switching device 1 6 and a gate 20 of the MOSFET. The  drain   and  source  of the  MOSFET  are  shown  at, 22   and   24 respectively.<br>
The fast switching device 16 may be any suitable device having a switching speed faster than the data sheet specified turn-on dsfay time and/or turn-off delay time of the MOSFET, preferably better than 2ns. Such devices may include a SiDAC a break-over diode, a suitably configured bipolar transistor arrangement, or any other suitable fast switching device or circuit.<br><br><br>
To switch the MOSFET on, the fast switching device is switched on electronically which rapidly transfers sufficient charge from the capacitor 14 to the gate 20 of the MOSFET, to switch the MOSFET on.<br>
Time diagrams for the circuit in figure 1 are shown in figures 3 and 4. The diagrams in broken lines indicate normal specified operation of the MOSFET 12. Hence, diagram 30 in figure 3 shows the gate voltage of the MOSFET during conventional switching on. The MOSFET is switched on at 32 and the diagram illustrates a turn-on delay time of about 34ns. The associated gate current is shown at 34 in figure 4.<br>
The diagrams for the method according to the invention are shown at 36 and 38 in figures 3 and 4 respectively. At 40 in figure 3, the aforementioned rapid transfer of charge from capacitor 14 through switch 18 and consequent build up of voltage on the gate of the MOSFET are shown. The subsequent fall in the gate voltage shown at 4,2 is attributable to the aforementioned Miller effect. What is clear though is that the device switches on at 44, after a mere 4ns. The associated current at the gate 20 is shown at 38 in figure 4. Initially, during the charge transfer stage, the gate current    is high<br><br>
9<br>
and thereafter it drops to a negligible level. It is also believed that with drain currents within the data specification of the MOSFET, switching losses with the switching method and circuit according to the invention are also reduced.<br>
The value (C) of the capacitor 14, the voltage (Vc) required on the capacitor before switching and hence the breakthrough voltage of the switching device 16, the gate threshold voltage (Vt) of the MOSFET 12 and the gate charge (Qs) required for complete switching of the MOSFET are related according to the following<br><br>
equation   --	-- &gt; Vt.<br>
(Qs/Vt + C)<br>
In figure 2 a circuit diagram of the triggering circuit 10 is shown wherein the first switching device 16 is a SIDAC.<br>
A periodic voltage is applied across a capacitor 14, in parallel with a SIDAC 16 and a MOSFET 12. Initially, during a first half cycle, the voltage supplied at the input 19 is insufficient to switch the SIDAC 16 on and the capacitor 14 is hence charged up. When the supplied voltage reaches the threshold of the SIDAC 16 it switches on, resulting in a closed circuit from the capacitor 14 to the gate 20 of<br>
In figure 2 a circuit diagram of the triggering circuit 10 is shown wherein the first switching device 16 is a SIDAC.<br>

Initially, during a first half cycle, the voltage supplied at the input 19 is insufficient to switch the SIDAC 16 on and the capacitor 14 is hence charged up. When the supplied voltage reaches the threshold of the SIDAC 16 it switches on, resulting in a closed circuit from the capacitor 14 to the gate 20 of<br><br>

the MOSFET 12, partially discharging the capacitor 14 and hence charging the gate 20. The result is that a charge will now be shared between the capacitor 14 and the gate 20, so that some voltage, preferably above the gate threshold voltage relative to ground, is applied to the gate.<br>
Using this method, the gate voltage may for short intervals be driven approximately three to four times beyond the maximum rating of some MOSFET's 12 without destroying the device.<br>
Similarly, when during the other half cycle the gate voltage exceeds the reverse threshold of the SIDAC 16 and current is conducted in the opposite direction, the gate voltage of the MOSFET 12 drops to substantially below the threshold voltage of the MOSFET 12 shortly after the charge dissipates from the gate 20 of the MOSFET 12. As a result, the MOSFET 12 will turn off and the drain current will no longer flow.<br>
In figure 5, an alternative and self-oscillating triggering circuit for the MOSFET 12 is shown. Components thereof corresponding to components of the circuits in figures 1 and 2 are designated utilizing<br><br>
like reference numerals, in this embodiment, the fast switching means 1 6 comprises a bipolar transistor arrangement. The voltage waveform at 50 is shown in figure 6. The voltage waveform at source 24 is shown in figure 7. From the latter waveform it can be seen at 52 that the source 24 of the aforementioned MOSFET 12 switches between an "off-state to an "on"-state through about 400V in a rise time tr of about 4ns, which is substantiaily quicker than the specified rise time of 27ns. Similarly, and as shown at 54 it switches from the "on"-state to the "off-state in a fall time tf of about 15ns, which is also substantially shorter than a specified fall time of about 24ns.<br>
In figure 8, the same triggering circuit 10 is shown for an insulated gate bipolar transistor 60 having a gate 62, a collector 64 and an emitter 66. The transistor is an IRG4PC5OW device which Is being manufactured and sold by International Rectifier. The waveform at 68 in figure 8 is shown in figure 9 and the waveform at emitter 68 adjacent load 70 is shown in figure 10.<br>
From the latter waveform it can be seen at 72 that the emitter 66 switches between an "off"-state and an "on'-state through about<br><br>
20<br><br>
400V in a rise time tr of about 4ns, which is substantially iess than a specified rise time of 33ns.<br>
in figure 11 a further embodiment of the triggering circuit is shown. The   switching   means  comprises   a  low   output  impedance,   high<br>
voltage, fast switching driving circuit 116. The device 116 must be<br>
able to switch between OV (zero   volt) and Vd in a first time period shorter than<br>
a specified turn-on delay time of the device 12. Vd is preferably bigger than 20xVt. Devices of this nature are available on the market.<br>
