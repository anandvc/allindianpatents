FUEL SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention generally relates to fuel systems for interna] combustion engines. More particularly, this invention relates to fuel systems that pressurize and filter fuel for diesel engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diesel engines convert chemical energy from a fuel into mechanical energy. The fuel usually is petroleum-based. Most diesel engines congress air in a cylinder and then inject fuel into the cylinder for the compressed air to ignite. The ignited fuel generates rapidly expanding gases that actuate a piston in the cylinder. The piston usually is connected to a crankshaft or similar device for converting the recorocating motion of the piston into rotaional motion The rotational motion from the crankshaft: may be used to propel a vehicle operate a pump or an electrical generator, or perform other work. The vehicle may be a truck, an automobile, a boat, or the like.<br>
Many diesel engines use a fuel injection system to inject fuel into the cylinders. Fuel injection systems usually have fuel injectors that spray a measured amount of fuel into each cylinder. The fuel pressure typically is increased for injecting the fuel near or at the end of the compression cycle. Most fuel injectors are activated mechanically or hydraulically and may be electronically controlled Some diesel engines use hydraulically activated electronically controlled unit injection (HEUT) fuel system to inject fuel into the cylinders. HEUI fuel injectors usually inject fuel into the cylinders at a pressure in the range of about 15,000 psi (103 NlPa) through about 25.000 psi (172 MPa).<br>
Most diesel engines have a fuel system to provide fuel to the fuel injectors. The fuel system usually has a fuel line that interconnects a fuel tank, a fuel pump, a pressure regulator, a primary filter, and a fuel rail. The fuel system may have other components between the fuel<br><br>
tank and the fuel pump such as a fuel heater, a coarse filter or strainer, and a water separator. The fuel system may have other components.<br>
Most vehicles have the fuel tank outside the engine compartment. Many vehicles have the remaining components of the fuel system inside the engine compartment. Some vehicles have a filter, a pump, and other components in or near the fuel tank. Some fuel supply components like the fuel rail are mounted on or are part of the engine.<br><br>
The fuel return line from the pressure regulator to the fuel tank may mcrease the costs and complexity of the engine. The return of filtered fixel to the fuel tank may decrease the service life of the primary fiher and other components in the fuel system The filtered fuel, once mixed with the fuel in the fuel tank, usually needs to be filtered again. The fuel pump may not operate efficiently and may fail when a plugged fuel filter causes the pressure to increase on the outlet side of the fuel pump.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
This invention provides a fuel system for a diesel engine. The fuel system has a fuel filter module that recirculates unfiltered fuel to the inlet side of a fuel pump.<br>
A fuel system for a diesel engine may have a fuel tank, a fuel pump, a fuel filter module, and a fuel rail. The fuel pump has an inlet side and an outlet side. The inlet side is connected to the fuel tank The fuel filter module has a pressure regulator and a filter element. The filter element is connected to the outlet side of the fuel pump. The pressure regulator is disposed between the outlet side of the fuel pump and the filter element. The pressure regulator recirculates unfiltered fuel to the inlet side of the fuel pump. The fuel rail is connected to the filter element<br>
A fuel filter module for a fuel system in a diesel engine may have a housing a strainer a filter element, and a pressure regulator. The housing forms a vacuum side and a pressure side. The vacuum side has a first inlet and a first outlet The pressure side has a second inled and a second outlet. The housing forms a first fuel passage that is connected to the first inlet. The housing forms a second fuel passage that is connected to the first outlet. The strainer is connected to the first and second fuel passages in the vacuum side. The filter element is disposed in a filter chamber formed by the housing in the pressure side. The filter chamber is connected to the second inlet. The pressure regulator is connected to the filter chamber in the pressure side. The pressure regulator is disposed between the second inlet and the filter element. The pressure regulator is connected to the first fuel passage in the vacuum side. The pressure regulator recirculates unfiltered fuel from the filter chamber to the first fuel passage.<br>
In a method for supplying fuel to a diesel engine, the fuel is pressurized. The fuel is regulated prior to filtering. The unfiltered fuel is recirculated to the inlet side of a fuel pump. The fuel is filtered.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br><br>
module 108. During engine operation, fuel from the fuel tank 106 flows to a vacuum side 118 of the fuel filter module 108. The vacuum side 118 may heat and may remove larger contaminants from the fuel The fuel flows from the vacuum side 118 to an inlet side 122 of the fuel pump 1 ID. The fuel pump 110 pressurizes the fuel The fuel flows from an outlet side 124 of the fuel pump 110 to the pressure side 120 of the fuel tllter module 108. The pressure side 120 of the fuel filter module 108 regulates the fuel pressure prior to filtering the fuel. The pressure side 120 provides filtered fuel to the fuel rail 112 and recirculates unfiltered fuel to the vacuum side 118. While a particular configuration is shown, the fuel system 100 may have other configurations including those with additional components.<br>
The fuel pump 110 creates a vacuum on the inlet side 122. The vacuum causes fuel to flow from the vented fuel tank 106, through the vacuum side 118 of the fuel filter module 108, and into the inlet side 122 of the fuel pump. A vacuum includes pressures essentiaEy less then than ambient pressure. The fuel pump 110 pressurizes the fuel to a pressure essentially greater than ambient pressure. The fuel pressure may be about 60 psi (0.4 MPa). Other fuel pressures may be used. The pressurized fuel flows from the fuel pump 110 through ifae pressure side 120 of the fuel filter module 108 to the fuel rail 112. The fuel pump 110 may be an electrical or mechanical pump.<br><br><br>
pressure regulator 138 prior to passing through a filter element 140. The filter element 140 may remove contaminants having a size larger than or equal to about 15 microns. The filter element 140 may remove contaminants having a size larger than or equal to about 2 microns. Other contaminant sizes may be removed.<br>
The pressure regulator 138 regulates the pressure of the fuel prior to the filter element 140. The pressure regulator 138 recirculates unfiltered fuel to the vacuum side 118 of the fuel filter module 108. The pressure regulator 138 may recirculate the unfiltered fuel to enter the fuel flow prior to the fuel heater 128 in the vacuum side 120. The recirculation of the fuel through the fuel heater 128 may improve the effectiveness of the fuel heater and may improve engine performance, especially during cold weather operation. The pressure regulator 138 may recirculate the unfiltered fuel to enter the fuel flow prior to the strainer 130 in the vacuum side 120. The pressure regulator 138 may reduce or relieve excess pressure when the filter element becomes plugged or reduces the fuel flow to the fuel rail 1 12.<br>
The filter element 140 may have a longer service life when the fuel pressure is reguiated prior to the filter element 140 (i.e., on the "dirty" side of the filter element 140). The regulation of fuel pressure prior to or on the dirty side of the filter element 140 permits only the fuel used by the fuel rail 112 to flow through the filter element 140. Some HEUI fuel injection systems are full flow, where some filtered fuel is returned to the fuel tank. These fuel injection systems can have fuel flow rates up to about 40 GPH (gallons per hour) or more. By filtering only the portion of fuel that is going to the fuel rail the flow rate through the filter element may be reduced to about 20 GPH or less. This reduction in fuel flow through the filter element may extend service life of the filter element or may reduce the filter element size and cost.<br><br><br>
combination thereof. The fuel filter module may have other configurations including those with additional components.<br>
The fuel filter module 208 has a vacuum side and pressure side. The vacuum side may be connected to a fuel tank or other supply via a first inlet 226. The vacuum side may be connected to a fuel pump via a first outlet 234. The pressure side may be connected to the fuel pump via a second inlet 236. The pressure side may be connected to a fuel rail or other reservoir via a second outlet 242.<br>
On the vacuum side of the fuel filter module 208, the housing 250 forms a first fuel passage 262 that connects to the first inlet 226. The first fuel passage 262 extends to a fuel heater 228, which is connected or integrated with a strainer 230. The housing 250 forms a second fuel passage 266 that extends from the strainer 230 to the first outlet 234. The fuel heater 228 may be electric and may operate on about 12VDC. Other fuel heaters may be used including electric heaters using other power sources. The fuel filter module 208 may nave a bowl in place of the fuel heater 228. The strainer 230 may remove contaminants from the fuel having a size essentially greater than or equal to about 150 microns. The strainer may remove contaminants having other sizes.<br>
A priming pump 244 is mounted on the housing 250. The priming pump 244 is connected to the second fuel passage 266 between the strainer 230 and the first outlet 234. A check valve 260 is disposed in the second fuel passage 266 between the priming pump 244 and the strainer 230. The priming pump 244 may have a displacement of about 1 in 3 (16.4 cm"'). The priming pump 244 may have other displacements. The priming pump 244 may be manually operated.<br><br><br>
inside diameter to wipe the standpipe as the filter element 240 is removed and reinserted in the filter chamber 264.<br>
The filter element 240 may remove about 98 percent of the contaminants from the fuel having a size larger than or equal to about 5 microns. The filter element 240 may remove about 95 percent of the contaminants from the fuel having a size larger than or equal to about 3 microns. The filter element 240 may remove other contaminant sizes.<br>
A pressure regulator 238 is disposed in the housing 250. The pressure regulator 238 is connected to the filter chamber 264 and to the first fuel passage 262. The pressure regulator 238 regulates the pressure of fuel coming through the second inlet 236 from a fuel pump. The pressure regulator 238 regulates the fuel before the fuel passes through the filter element 240. The pressure regulator 238 recirculates unfiltered fuel to the first fuel passage 262 in the vacuum side.<br>
During operation of the vacuum side, fuel flows from the first inlet 226 to the first outlet  234. The fuel flows from  the first inlet 226, through the first fuel passage 262, to the fuel heater 228 and the strainer 230. The strainer 230 may remove larger contaminants from the fuel. The fuel flows from the strainer 230 through the second fuel passage 266. pass the check valve 260 and priming pump 244, and exits through the first outlet 234. The fuel heater 228 may raise the fuel temperature by about 50 °F (10 °C). The fuel heater 228 may raise the fuel temperature by other amounts.<br>
During operation of the pressure side, fuel flows from the second inlet 236 to the second outlet 242. The fuel flows from the second inlet 226 into the filter chamber 264. The pressure regulator 238 regulates the fuel pressure and recirculates unfiltered fuel to the first fuel passage 262. The fuel flows through the filter element 240 and into the stand pipe 258. The filter element 240 may remove contaminants from the fuel that have a smaller size. The fuel flows through the standpipe. through the third fuel passage 268, and exits through the second outlet 242.<br><br><br><br><br>
unfiltered fuel from the pressure side to the vacuum side of a fuel filler module. The pressure regulator may recirculate the unfiltered fuel from a filter chamber in the pressure side to a fuel passage in the fuel filter module. The pressure regulator may recirculate the unfiltered fuel from the filter chamber to a fuel heater in the fuel filter module. The pressure regulator may recirculate the unfiltered fuel from a filter chamber in the pressure side to a strainer in the fuel filter module.<br>
In block 611. the fuel is filtered to remove smaller contaminants. The contaminants may have a size greater than or equal to about 2 microns. The contaminants may have a size greater than or equal to about 15 microns. Other size contaminants may be strained. The fuel may be filtered to remove about 95 percent of the contaminants having a size greater than or equal to about 3 microns. The fuel may be filtered to remove about 98 percent of the contaminants having a size greater than or equal to about 5 microns. The fuel is filltered after the fuel pressure is regulated.<br>
