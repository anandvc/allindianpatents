Description<br>
Method ar.d machine for manufacturing electrical circuits<br>
Technical Field<br>
	This invention relates to a method for manufacturing<br>
electrical circuits.<br>
	In particular, but without thereby limiting its scope, the<br>
invention relates to a method for manufacturing electrical<br>
circuits for powering the brushes of electric motors.<br>
Background art<br>
	In an electric motor, brush wear caused by the turning<br>
commutator leads to the formation of dust consisting of particles<br>
of electrically conductive material scattered around the<br>
commutator.<br>
	When used for motorcycle and automotive vehicle<br>
applications, the motors must be protected against infiltration,<br>
for example of rain water.<br>
	To obtain this type of protection, the motor guards are made<br>
watertight.<br>
	The watertight guards, however, trap the particles of<br>
electrically conductive material inside the casing, causing them<br>
to accumulate on the circuits and eventually creating short<br>
circuits or interrupting the power supply as a result of the<br>
creation of electrical bridges.<br>
	In the latter case, power is not distributed equally between<br>
the brushes and the balance required for correct operation is<br>
altered.<br>
	Methods of embedding electrical circuits, which are often<br>
formed or punched from a sheet or web of electrically conductive<br>
aterial, in the structure of the brush holder were therefore<br>
devised to overcome this problem.<br>
	This solution, however, although certainly effective, proved<br><br>
WO 2006/079894	PCT7IB20O6/O001O8<br>
2<br>
complex and expensive to implement.<br>
	Moreover, the circuits can be enibedded only in brush holders<br>
made of plastic because the high melting point of metal would<br>
damage the electrical conductors during the forming process.<br>
	To overcome this problem, brush holders with recesses to<br>
precisely accommodate the circuits were made so that the circuits<br>
were exposed to dust only at the top.<br>
	This solution, however, while offering undoubted advantages<br>
in terms of simplicity has the drawback of not fully solving the<br>
problem of short circuiting and electrical bridging.<br>
	To overcome this drawback, a method of coating electrical<br>
circuits by dipping them in a suitable insulating material was<br>
devised.<br>
	This method of manufacturing electrical circuits, however,<br>
although it effectively insulates the circuits from electrically<br>
conductive dust, has evident disadvantages in terms of cost and<br>
complexity.<br>
	Indeed, after the circuit has been dipped in the insulating<br>
material and dried, the insulating material has to be removed from<br>
the parts of the circuit to be connected to the electrical<br>
conductors.<br>
	Owing to the very small size of the circuits, the operation<br>
of cleaning the contacts is difficult to perform and may result in<br>
poor electrical conduction. In other terms, it may give rise to<br>
the very problem that coating the circuit was designed to<br>
eliminate.<br>
	This invention therefore has for an aim to provide a method<br>
for manufacturing electrical circuits that is free of the above<br>
mentioned disadvantages and that is at once practical and<br>
inexpensive to implement.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
	The technical characteristics of the invention, with<br>

indirectly, on claim 11.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
	The technical characteristics of the invention, with<br>
reference to the above aims, are clearly described in the claims<br>
below and its advantages are apparent from the detailed<br>
description which follows, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
provided merely by way of example without restricting the scope of<br>
the inventive concept, and in which:<br>
	Figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of a preferred<br>
embodiment of a machine for manufacturing electrical circuits<br>
according to the present invention;<br>
	Figures 2 to 7 illustrate a part of the machine of Figure 1<br>
in a sequence of operating steps.<br>
Detailed Description'of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
	With reference to Figure 1, the numeral 1 denotes in its<br>
entirety a machine for manufacturing electrical circuits 2 from a<br>
web 3 of electrically conductive material.<br>
	The machine 1, which is represented schematically in the<br>
accompanying drawings, comprises means for feeding the web 3 along<br>
a defined feed path P.<br>
	The web feed means are represented schematically as a block<br>
4.<br>
	The machine 1 also comprises a web cleaning station 5<br>
eguipped with one or more rotary brushes 6 and a pickling unit,<br>
not illustrated, the term "pickling" denoting a cleaning process<br>
performed by chemical or electrolytic means.<br>
	The brush 6 is rotationally driven by an electric motor 7<br>
through a reduction unit 8.<br>
	At the outfeed end of the cleaning station 5, the machine 1<br>
comprises a first unit 9, for drying the web 3, the unit 9<br>
comprising an element 10 for blowing warm air on the web 3 .<br><br>
WO 2006/079894	PCT/1B2006/000108<br>
4<br>
	Downstream of the cleaning station 5, relative to the feed<br>
direction indicated by the arrow FI, the machine 1 comprises a<br>
stamping station 11 where a certain quantity of insulating varnish<br>
is applied to the web 3 in such a way as to form a plurality cf<br>
impressions 12 on it. Each impression 12 covers a certain portion<br>
of the web 3 and reproduces the final form that the electrical<br>
circuit 2 will eventually have, though slightly larger in size.<br>
	The web 3 stamping station 11 comprises a pattern 13, a<br>
first pad 14 and second pad 15.<br>
	The pattern 13 is siiaped substantially like a parallelepiped<br>
and has on its upper face 13a a plurality of cavities 16, each<br>
reproducing the above mentioned impression 12.<br>
	The cavities 16 are distributed in succession in a first<br>
direction Dl parallel to the straight section of the feed path P<br>
at the stamping, station 11.<br>
	The first pad 14 is prismatic in shape, with a convex bottom<br>
face 14a, and is made of a resilient material, advantageously<br>
based on silicone.<br>
	The first pad 14 is mounted on a block 17 which is in turn<br>
stably connected to an operating arm 18.<br>
	The operating arm 18 is moved by actuating means, not<br>
illustrated in a second direction D2 perpendicular to a plane PI<br>
in which the web 3 lies when it is at the stamping station.<br>
The operating arm 18 is also moved by the same actuating<br>
means, not illustrated, in a third direction D3 perpendicular to<br>
the second direction D2 and parallel to the plane PI.<br>
	The second pad 15 is moved in reciprocating fashion by<br>
actuating means, which are not illustrated, in the above mentioned<br>
first direction Dl and, during its movement, engages the top face<br>
13a of the pattern 13 and transfers a certain amount of insulating<br>
varnish to it.<br>
	The insulating varnish, stored in a tank that is<br>
schematically represented as a block 19, is fed by the tank to the<br>
second pad 15 through a conduit 20.<br>
	Similarly to what is described above, the machine 1 also<br>
comprises, at the. outfeed end cf the stamping station 11, a second<br>
drying unit 21 for quickly drying the ir.sulating varnish applied<br><br>
WO 2006/079894	PCT/TB2006/000108<br>
5<br>
to the web 3. The second drying rait 21 comprises an element 10<br>
for blowing warm air on the web 3.<br>
	Downstream of the stamping station 11, the machine 1 further<br>
comprises a punching station 22 for cutting the circuits 2 out of<br>
the web 3 by punching.<br>
As illustrated schematically in Figure 1, the punching<br>
station 22 comprises a die 23 and a matrix 24.<br>
	The die 23, shown under the web 3 in the accompanying<br>
drawings, has the design 25 of a circuit 2 made in it in relief,<br>
whilst the matrix 24, non illustrated in detail in the drawings,<br>
has on it the same design of the circuit 2 but in this case the<br>
design is recessed.<br>
	According to methods described in more detail below, the<br>
relief design 25 and the recessed design that is not illustrated<br>
engage, each other and the web. 3 in such a way as to punch out a<br>
circuit 2.<br>
	Downstream of the punching station 22, again relative to the<br>
direction indicated by the arrow Fl, the machine 1 comprises the<br>
aforementioned web 3 feed means 4.<br>
	A block 2 6 in Figure 1 schematically represents a control<br>
unit. The control unit 2 6 controls and coordinates the operation<br>
and movement of all the parts of the machine 1.<br>
	In use, the web 3 of electrically conductive material is<br>
unwound from a roll, which is not illustrated in the drawings, and<br>
fed towards the cleaning station 5.<br>
	In the station 5, the web 3, which has a top face 3 a and a<br>
bottom face 3b, is cleaned both by mechanical means and by<br>
pickling.<br>
	More specifically, mechanical cleaning is accomplished by<br>
brushing at least the top face 3a to which the varnish is applied,<br>
using the aforementioned rotary brushes 6, one of which is shown<br>
in Figure 1, drawn in dashed line style.<br>
	 Pickling, as mentioned above, may be carried out either<br>
using suitable chemicals, selected according to the type cf metal<br>
35 the web is made of, or by an electrolytic process. Both methods<br>
are well known in the trade and are not therefore described in<br>
this specification.<br><br>
WO 2006/079894	PCT/IB2006/000108<br>
6 <br>
	Still with reference to Figure 1, after leaving the cleaning<br>
station 5, the web 3, which is advanced in steps by the feed means<br>
4, is struck at least on its top face 3a by a jet of warm air<br>
emitted by the blowing element 10 of the first drying unit 9.<br>
	The jet of warm air is designed to dry the top face 3a to<br>
remove any traces of liquid substances used during the previous,<br>
cleaning step.<br>
	Again with reference to Figure 1, the web 3 advances along<br>
the feed path P, in the direction indicated by the arrow Fl, and<br>
reaches the stamping station 11.<br>
	The following detailed description of the operations carried<br>
out at the stamping station 11 is made with reference to Figures 2<br>
to 7, which are scaled-up views of the .station 11 itself.<br>
	As shown in Figure 2, the operating arm 18, driven by<br>
respective actuating means that are not illustrated, positions the<br>
first pad 14 above the pattern 13 in such a way that the convex,<br>
bottom face 14a of the first pad 14 itself faces the top face 13a<br>
of the pattern 13.<br>
	The cavities 16 reproducing the impression 12 are full, that<br>
is to say, each cavity 16 contains a sufficient quantity of<br>
insulating varnish.<br>
The operations by which they are filled are described in<br>
more detail below.<br>
	With reference to Figure 3, the operating arm 18 moves down<br>
in the direction D2, as indicated by the arrow F2, to place the<br>
first pad 14 in a first end position in which it is in contact<br>
with, the top face 13a of the pattern 13. The first pad 14 is<br>
deformed by compression.<br>
	In Figure 3, the face 13a is hidden by the first pad 14.<br>
At its aforementioned first end position, thanks to the high<br>
deformability of the material it is made of and to the compressive<br>
action exerted by the arm 18, the first pad 14 penetrates inside<br>
the cavities 16 of the pattern 13 and its bottom face 14a receives<br>
a certain quantity of varnish from the cavities IS.<br>
	In other words, as clearly illustrated in Figure 4, some of<br>
the varnish that was previously inside the cavities 16 is<br>
transferred to the bottom face 14a according to the aforementioned<br><br>
WO 2006/079894	PCT/ TB2006/000108<br>
7<br>
impression 12.<br>
	Figure 4 shows the pad 14 after the arm. 18 has lifted it in<br>
the direction of the arrow F3, causing the faces 13a, 14a of the<br>
pattern 13 and of the first pad 14, respectively, to move apart.<br>
	As shown in Figure 5, the arm 18, controlled by the unit 26,<br>
advances in the direction D3, as indicated by the arrow F4, and<br>
moves the first pad 14 to the position where its bottom face 14a<br>
faces the web 3 of electrically conductive material.<br>
	With reference to Figure 6, the arm 18 extends downwardly in<br>
the direction indicated by the arrow F5 and moves the first pad 14<br>
down to a second end position in which it is in contact with the<br>
web 3 of electrically conductive material. The first pad 14 is<br>
deformed by compression.<br>
	At this second end position, the first pad 14 transfers to<br>
the top face 3a of the web 3 at least a part of the varnish that<br>
it had received in the form of impressions 12 on its bottom convex<br>
face 14a.<br>
	In Figure 6, the second pad 15 has started moving in the<br>
direction Dl indicated by the arrow F6 to meter the insulating<br>
varnish transferred to the top face 13a of the pattern 13.<br>
	More specifically, the second pad 15 moves over the pattern<br>
13 twice and, as it does so, releases a quantity of insulating<br>
varnish that is transferred not only to the inside of the<br>
cavitities 16 but also to the smooth surface of the face 13a.<br>
	While releasing the varnish, the second pad 15 also exerts a<br>
scraping action on the top face 13a of the pattern 13. As a result<br>
of this scraping action, when the second pad 15 has moved over the<br>
pattern 13 for the second time, that is to say, when the second<br>
pad 15 has returned to the position shown in Figure 5, the<br>
insulating varnish is located only inside the cavities 16.<br>
	As illustrated in Figure 7, in which the arm 1.8 has already<br>
lifted the first pad 14 in the direction indicated by the arrow<br>
F7, another impression,, labelled 12' for clarity, appears on the<br>
top face 3a of the web 3 as a result of the first pad 14<br>
transferring insulating varnish when it is in its second end<br>
position, illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
	The working cycle of the first pad 14 is completed when the<br><br>
WO 2006/079894	PCT/IB2006/000108<br>
8<br>
operating arm 18 moves back in the direction D3 as indicated by<br>
the arrow F8 to the position shown in Figure 2, ready to start<br>
another cycle.<br>
	While the first pad 14 performs this movement, the second<br>
pad 15 moves over the pattern 13 a second time in the direction<br>
indicated by the arrow Fl to return to the position illustrated in<br>
Figure 2, and the feed means 4 advance the" web 3 along its path P<br>
in the direction indicated by the arrow Fl, shown in Figures 1 and<br>
7, by a step L egual to the spacing between one impression 12 and<br>
the next.<br>
	The spacing L between the impressions 12 made on the web 3<br>
is egual to the spacing between the cavities 16 in the pattern 13.<br>
Advantageously, a device, not illustrated, is positioned on<br>
the path P between the second drying unit 21 and the punching<br>
station 22 for applying a lubricating substance to the V7eb 3, for<br>
example by spraying, in order to facilitate the cutting action of<br>
the punching die 23.<br>
	Advantageously, to enable the insulating varnish to be<br>
progressively layered on the web 3, the impressions 12 are<br>
obtained by repeated stamping actions of the first pad 14. For<br>
example, in the embodiment illustrated in the accompanying<br>
drawings, each finished impression 12 is made by the first pad 14<br>
applying varnish to the web 3 in five successive stamping actions.<br>
	As illustrated in Figure 1, after leaving the stamping<br>
station 11, the web 3, which is advanced in steps by the feed<br>
means 4, is struck by a jet of warm air emitted by the blowing<br>
element 10 of the second drying unit 21.<br>
This jet of warm air is. designed to guickly dry the<br>
insulating varnish that has been applied to the web 3.<br>
	As it proceeds along the path P, each portion of the web 3<br>
reaches the punching station 22 where it is engaged by the die 23<br>
and the matrix 24.<br>
	The die 23 and matrix 24 move towards each other in<br>
substantially known manner and by means of actuators that are well<br>
known and therefore not described in detail in this specification,<br>
so as to engage each other and the web 3 to form the electrical<br>
circuits 2 by punching.<br><br>
WO 2006/079894	PCT/IB2006/000108<br>
9<br>
	The die 23 which, through the relief design 25, physically<br>
cuts the electrical circuit 2 out of the web 3, engages the lower<br>
face 3b of the web 3, whilst the matrix 24 opposes the action of<br>
the die 23 by acting on the top face 3a.<br>
	Advantageously, in an alternative embodiment of the machine<br>
1 that is not illustrated, the web 3 engages a feed roller which<br>
positions the web with its top face 3a - that is, the one on which<br>
the impressions 12 are made - down so that the electrical circuits<br>
2 drop when they are punched out.<br>
	In this specification, the term "varnish" means any fluid<br>
insulating material that can be applied to a web of electrically<br>
conductive material and that will adhere permanently to the web.<br>
	In this specification the phrase "punch at least partly"<br>
denotes the fact that at least a part of the web portions coated<br>
with insulating varnish are cut out.<br>
	Indeed, for safety reasons, a part around the edges of the<br>
coated portions remain on the punched web. This is done for safety<br>
reasons because it would be extremely risky 'to cut out from the<br>
web a circuit that is not perfectly and completely coated with<br>
insulating varnish. It would indeed be extremely difficult and<br>
unduly expensive to provide means for exactly cutting out only the<br>
web portions that have been coated with varnish,<br>
	Advantageously, the web 3 that leaves the punching station<br>
22, that is to say the part of the web from which the circuits 2<br>
25 have been punched out, can easily be surface cleaned, melted down<br>
and re-used.<br>
	The invention described has evident industrial applications<br>
and may be subject to modifications and variations without thereby<br>
departing from the scope of the inventive concept. Moreover, all<br>
the details of the invention may be substituted by technically<br>
equivalent elements.<br><br>
