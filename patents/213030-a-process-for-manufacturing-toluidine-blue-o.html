Fig. 2 is a 254 nm HPLC chart, depicting the peaks which are characteristic of typical TBO product compositions of the present invention; and<br>

Background of the Invention<br>
Most oral lesions result from trauma.  However, other oral lesions are dysplastic tumors, some of which may be benign, but some of which may be either cancerous or<br>
precancerous.  In addition, many dysplastic lesions are small and easily missed on routine visual examination by dental clinicians.<br>
An in vivo diagnostic test is known which identifies and<br>
delineates suspect dysplastic oral tissue.  This screening test is generally described in the United States Patent 4,321,251 to Mashberg and in the United States Patent 5,372,801 to Tucci et al.  More recently kits have been<br>
developed which make it possible for clinicians to quickly and easily administer the test, as part of other routine dental procedures, and thus identify and/or delineate suspect sites at a time when the patients are symptomless or while the dysplastic lesions are so small that they might be missed during normal visual examination.  Once a suspect dysplastic lesion is identified by the Mashberg protocol, a regular biopsy sample can be taken and subjected to histological examination, to determine whether the lesion is malignant or precancerous.  Kits for performing this test, containing premixed dye and rinse solutions in the proper quantities and concentrations, are licensed by Zila, Inc. and are available commercially in Canada from Germiphene, Inc. under the trademark ORASCAN™ and in The United Kingdom and Australia from Stafford-Miller Ltd. under the trademark "ORASCREEN®".<br>
The Prior Art TBO Products<br>
It has now been discovered that the organic dye content of the prior art TBO products which were typically commercially available, depending on the vendor, was relatively low.  Typically, the combined areas of the 254 nm HPLC peaks (see HPLC procedure of Example 3),which represent the conformational isomers of TBO in these prior art products was only about =2%-75% of the combined areas of the 254 nm HPLC peaks which represent all of the TBO and TBO-related components, i.e., the two conformational isomers of TBO plus up to six TBO-related components.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, HPLC peaks 7 and 8 represent the two conformational isomers of TBO (shown here as the chloride salt) :<br>
(I)	Peak 8<br>
(II)	Peak 7<br><br>
HPLC peaks 5 and 6 have been identified as the N-demethylated derivatives of the two conformational isomers of TBO:<br>
(III)	Peak 6<br>
(IV)	Peak 5<br>
HPLC peaks 2 and 3 have been identified as the N,N-demethylated derivatives of the two conformational isomers of TBO:<br>
(V)	Peak 3<br>
(VI)	Peak 2<br>
The exact structures of the compounds represented by HPLC peaks 1 and 4 have not been positively determined.<br>
At any rate, in the TBO compositions of the prior art, a typical one of which is represented in Fig. 1, the compounds represented by peaks 1-4 were present in relatively higher amounts than those of the present invention (See Fig. 2) and the compounds represented by peaks 5-8 were present in relatively lower amounts than in the TBO products of the present invention.  The two N-demethylated derivatives of the conformational isomers of TBO, represented by peaks 5 and 6, of the prior art (Fig. 1) were present in the relatively higher amounts, typically upwards of 20% of the organic dye content, than those which are present in the TBO products of my invention.<br>
The Prior Art TBO Manufacturing Processes<br>
The classic synthesis of TBO is exemplified in the United States Patent 418,055, issued November 30, 1989, to Dandliker et al.  This synthesis is a series of three oxidation steps:<br>
(1) oxidation of N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, e.g., with potassium dichromate, to form 2-amino-5-dimethylaminophenyl thiosulfonic acid; (2) condensation of the thiosulfonic acid with o-toluidine, to form the corresponding indamine-thiosulfonic acid; and (3) ring closure of the indamine-thiosulfonic acid, e.g., in the presence of zinc chloride at boiling temperature for about 30 minutes, to form TBO.  The<br>
reaction mixture is then cooled and the TBO product of the ring-closure reaction is complexed and salted out, e.g., by treatment with sodium chloride and zinc chloride, to precipitate the TBO complex, e.g., as an TBO/ZnCl2 complex. Purification may be accomplished by repeated re-solution and re-precipitation, e.g., by re-solution in hot aqueous zinc chloride solution and re-precipitation with sodium chloride/zinc chloride.<br>
As far as known, prior workers, who instigated the use of TBO for in vivo identification of dysplasia, used the above-described prior art TBO products, i.e., compositions in which the conformational isomers of TBO plus the N-demethylation and N,N-demethylation derivatives were less than 80% of the dye composition and in which the two N-demethylation derivatives of the conformational isomers, formed greater than about 20% % of the dye composition.  According to my information, prior workers were unaware of the exact composition of their "TBO" products and manufacturers of prior art TBO products were unable to reproducibly prepare them.  In fact, the prevalent literature description of the quality of TBO is simply "toluidine blue of good color value".  The Biological Stain Commission specifies an analytical titration procedure for determining only the "organic dye content" of the material. The prior art use of such loosely defined "TBO" resulted in anomalous clinical observations and serious problems in obtaining necessary regulatory clearances to manufacture and market such products for use in human diagnostic procedures.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
Briefly, the new compositions of matter embodying the invention are a TBO product, in which the conformational isomers of TBO and the N-demethylation derivatives of these conformational isomers comprise and are present in a ratio of the TBO isomers to their N-demethylation derivatives such that the ratio of the combined areas of the 254 nm HPLC peaks representing the TBO isomers (determined in accordance with the HPLC procedure of Example 3) to the combined areas of the peaks representing their N-demethylation derivatives is at least about 6:1.  Thus, as depicted in Fig. 2, the combined area of the 254 nm HPLC peaks, representing the TBO conformational isomers (peaks 7 and 8), is at least about six times the combined area of the 254 nm HPLC peaks, representing their respective N-demethylation derivatives (peaks 5 and 6). In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the components represented by peaks 5, 6, 7 and 8 equals at least about 95% of the organic dye content of the product.  In the most particularly preferred embodiment, the peak 8 (254 nm) area represents at least 58% of the organic dye content of the product.<br>
The invention also contemplates a method for human in vivo detection of dysplastic tissue, which includes the step<br>
of applying to human tissue the above-described new TBO products.<br>
Still another embodiment of the invention is a novel general process for reproducibly manufacturing TBO compositions, including the above-described novel TBO products, in which the complexing agent is added to the reaction mixture before the ring closure (third) step of the Dandliker synthesis, preferably before the first oxidation step (11, of Fig 3) of the process.<br>
The prior art Dandliker process included the steps of<br>
oxidizing N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine ions in a first reaction mixture to form a first intermediate, 2-amino-5-dimethylaminophenyl thiosulfonic acid,<br>
oxidizing the first intermediate and condensation of the oxidizate with o-toluidine, in a second reaction mixture, to form a second intermediate, indamine thiosulfonic acid,<br>
oxidizing the second intermediate in a third reaction mixture to close the indamine ring, forming a TBO reaction product, dissolved in the third reaction mixture,<br>
introducing a complexing reagent into said third reaction mixture, to form a TBO-complex product, and<br>
separating said TBO-complex from said third reaction mixture.<br>
My improvement on this prior art Dandliker process comprises the step of adding the complexing reagent at a stage earlier than the formation of the third reaction mixture, preferably before the formation of the second reaction mixture.<br>
According to a still further and presently preferred embodiment, specially adapted to manufacture the novel TBO product compositions of the invention, the temperature of the reaction mixtures during the oxidation steps is maintained at not greater than about 10° centigrade.<br>
In yet another further and presently preferred embodiment, specially adapted to improve the quality of the TBO product, the pH of the reaction mixture during the oxidation steps is maintained in the range of about 2.8-3.8 (preferably 3.3) in the first reaction mixture, about 3.1-4.1 (preferably 3.6) in the second reaction mixture and about 3.0 in the third reaction mixture.<br>
In still another and presently preferred embodiment, my novel general process, briefly described above, is improved to provide major increases in yield of the TBO product.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As depicted in Fig. 1, typical previously commercially available TBO exhibited two 254 nm HPLC peaks (peaks 7 and 8), which represent the conformational isomers of TBO, and two 254 nm HPLC peaks (peaks 5 and 6), which have been discovered by<br>
me to be the demethylation derivatives of the conformational isomers.  The relative quantities of the conformational isomers of TBO to their N-demethylated derivatives in this typical prior art product was such that the peak area ratio of the conformational isomers to the N-demethylated derivatives is less than 4:1.  A higher ratio, approaching or exceeding 6:1, accidentally existed in isolated prior art TBO products, but the relative amounts of such products were not known or considered important.  In any event, TBO products with such higher ratios, could not be reproducibly prepared by prior art manufacturing procedures.<br>
According to regulatory requirements based on recent clinical testing, TBO which is to be used in human diagnostic procedures (in general accordance with the Mashberg protocol) for detecting dysplastic tissue, must have an HPLC peak area ratio at 254 nm ratio of the conformational TBO isomers to the N-demethylation derivatives of at least about 6:1, i.e., the area of the combined 254 nm HPLC peaks 7 and 8, must be at least about six times greater than the area of combined 254 nm HPLC peaks 5 and 6.<br>
It would be highly desirable to provide TBO product compositions which meet the requirements for human diagnostic testing procedures, in which the ratio of areas of the 254 nm HPLC peaks of the conformational isomers to the areas of their demethylation derivatives is at least 6:1.  Further, it would be highly desirable to provide manufacturing processes for reliably and reproducibly preparing such TBO products, having<br>
this specific ratio of TBO isomers to TBO demethylation derivatives, and for reliably and reproducibly producing other TBO products with increased yield and overall purity.<br>
As will be apparent from Fig. 2, which depicts a 254 nm HPLC analysis of typical compositions of the present invention, the peak area ratio of TBO conformational isomers to N-demethylation derivatives is greater than about 6:1, namely, 6.68:1, as demonstrated by the fact that the combined areas of 254 nm. HPLC peaks 7 and 8 is 6.68  times greater than the combined areas of peaks 5 and 6.  The overall purity, determined by HPLC and ignition tests, and defined as [one hundred minus the percentage of ignition residue] multiplied by the HPLC purity (i.e., the sum of the areas of peaks 5, 6, 7 &amp; 8 divided by the total peak areas) of the TBO products of the invention, is at least greater than 75%, compared to 2-10% for most of the prior art compositions.   In isolated incidents, a comparable purity may have been obtained in prior art products, but not reproducibly.<br>
According to one aspect of my invention, the ratio of the areas of the peaks (peaks 3, 6 &amp; 8) with the ring methyl group in the 2-position (e.g., see Formula I) to the areas of the peaks (peaks 2, 5 &amp; 7)with the ring methyl group in the 4-position (e.g., see Formula II) is ~ 2.5:1.  By contrast, according to my knowledge, this ratio in the prior art products was no greater than 1.5:1.<br>
This combination of high ratio of the areas of peaks 7+8: peaks 5+6 and the high ratio of the areas of peaks 3+6+8:peaks 2+5+7 has not to my knowledge been exhibited by any prior art product.  Since peak 8 is the primary TBO peak, the structure of which is most widely accepted as TBO, then peaks 3, 6 and 8 are preferred to peaks 2, 5 and 7.  Peaks 7 and 8 are, of course, preferred over peaks 5 and 6, which are, in turn, preferred over peaks 2 and 3.  Thus, in the most preferred embodiment of my invention, the products satisfy the combination of these two ratio criteria.<br>
Fig. 3 is a process flow diagram which depicts a process for preparing TBO products, which meet the regulatory requirements for clinical use in general accordance with the Mashberg protocol.<br>
The starting material 10 for the synthesis of Fig. 3 is commercially-available, high-purity N,N-dimethyl,p-phenylene diamine:<br>
(VII)<br>
Formation of First Reaction Mixture<br>
An aqueous solution of the starting material 10 is oxidized 11, preferably at less than 10° C, especially at less than about 5° C, by reaction with a suitable oxidizing agent 12, e.g., potassium dichromate 12, in the presence of acid, aluminum sulfate and a reagent, 13 (which is believed to complex the intermediate(s) and is used in a later stage of the process to complex the TBO composition components), e.g., zinc chloride.  Then, a source of thiosulfate ions 14, e.g., sodium thiosulfate, is added to form a first reaction mixture 15 containing the first intermediate, 2-Amino-5-dimethylaminophenyl thiosulfonic acid:<br>
(VIII)<br>
Formation of Second Reaction Mixture<br>
The first reaction mixture 15 is then further reacted, preferable at a temperature of not greater than about 10° C, with additional oxidizing agent 16, e.g., potassium dichromate, and o-toluidine hydrochloride 17, in a<br>
condensation step 18 to form the second intermediate, a condensation product, indamine thiosulfonic acid<br>
in the second reaction mixture 19. Formation of Third Reaction Mixture<br>
The second reaction mixture 19 is then further oxidized 21, preferably by addition of a suitable oxidizing agent 22, e.g., potassium dichromate, at a temperature of not greater than about 10° C.  This is followed by the addition of copper sulfate, zinc chloride complexing agent, acid and heating to 100° C to effect closure of the indamine ring, forming TBO in a third reaction mixture 24.  At this point the TBO is separated from the third reaction mixture and purified.<br>
Separation/Purification of TBO<br>
For example, in the presently preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, the TBO is precipitated from the third reaction mixture by complexation of 24 with a suitable complexing agent 25, e.g., zinc chloride, to form the complex TBO-zinc chloride double salt.  The precipitate is filtered 26 from the liquid phase and washed with sodium chloride solution 27.  The washed filter cake is then<br>
redissolved 28 in a critical1 volume of water 29 to form a TBO solution 30, which is then filtered 31 to remove undissolved solids 32a, which are discarded.  Zinc Chloride, followed by a critical2 volume/concentration of sodium chloride 33 is then added to the filtrate 32 to again precipitate the TBO-zinc chloride double salt, illustratively (showing only one of the conformational isomers),<br>
(X)<br>
The TBO-zinc chloride double salt is separated from the mixture by filtration, to yield a TBO-zinc chloride/TBO hydrochloride filter cake 34.<br>
As indicated by the dashed line 35, the TBO filter cake 34 can be redissolved, filtered, re-precipitated and reisolated multiple times to achieve the desired degree of purity and yield of TBO.  The final purified filter cake complex product 34 is then dried 35, e.g., in conventional convection oven and/or vacuum oven and the dried filter cake 36 is ground and blended 37 to yield the final TBO product 38.<br>
1	If  too much water is used it prevents isolation of the<br>
TBO.  If too little water is used  (1) all of the TBO does not<br>
get dissolved, reducing the yield and (2) it decreases the<br>
purity of the product.<br>
2	If  too little sodium chloride is used, all of the<br>
product will not be salted out, reducing yield.  If too much<br>
sodium chloride is used it will cause impurities to<br>
precipitate out along with the TBO, decreasing the purity of<br>
the product.<br>
The final TBO product contains both the zinc chloride double-salt of TBO (Formula X) and the chloride salt of TBO (Formulas I &amp; II) .<br>
Introducing the complexing reagent before the formation of the third reaction mixture, i.e., prior to the oxidation of the indamine thiosulfonic acid and complexing the resultant TBO reaction product to form the TBO-complex, produces a TBO-complex product having an improved ratio of TBO conformational isomers to the N-demethylation products thereof.  If the complexing reagent is introduced before the formation of the third reaction mixture, a ratio of at least 6:1 can be obtained.  Of course, as will be recognized by those skilled in the art, obtaining these improved ratios of isomers to demethylation derivatives will also depend somewhat on observing other processing parameter precautions, as will be discussed below in connection with the disclosure of the preferred embodiments of the process invention, which are desirable to improve the yield and purity of the TBO-complex product.  However, even if such other yield and purity-increasing precautions are observed, the desired improved ratios of isomers to N-demethylation products will not be obtained and the desired improved ratio of peaks with the methyl group in the -2 vs. -4 position will not be obtained,<br>
unless the complexing reagent is added at least before the formation of the third reaction mixture, i.e. before oxidizing the indamine sulfonic acid and complexing the resultant TBO product.<br>
At present, I believe that the earlier addition of the complexing reagent, i.e., before the formation of the third reaction mixture improves the isomer:N-demethylation derivative ratio of the final product, because of the early formation of a complex of the starting material and/or the thiosulfonic acid and/or the indamine-thiosulfonic acid, which apparently offers steric hinderance to demethylation.  In other words, the complex, because of its increased size and structure, offers steric bulk (and possibly electronic effects) which protect the N-methyl groups from oxidative demethylation.  Because all three reaction steps involve oxidation and possible demethylation, the earliest formation possible of this complex is advantageous, which is why I recommend that the complexing agent be present as early as possible.<br>
According to further and most preferred embodiments of the invention, as disclosed in my prior USA application, identified above, the yield of my general process, described above, is significantly increased by introducing the source of thiosulfate ions into the first reaction mixture, to form the first intermediate, while maintaining the reaction mixture at a reduced temperature of about 10°C and continuing the reaction at this reduced temperature before raising the temperature to an elevated temperature.  Thus, in the manufacture of the indamine thiosulfonic acid intermediate, which comprises the steps of oxidizing N,N'-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine in a reaction mixture containing it and an oxidizing agent, and introducing a source of thiosulfate ions,<br>
followed by raising the temperature to an elevated temperature for approximately 30 minutes, to form a solution of indamine thiosulfonic acid dissolved in the reaction mixture, the overall yield of TBO product from the overall process as greatly increased by maintaining the temperature of the oxidation-thiosulfonization mixture at or below about 10°C for approximately 30 minutes, before raising the temperature to form the indamine thiosulfonic acid reaction mixture solution.<br>

EXAMPLE 2 Clinical Testing Protocol<br>
Preparation of Clinical Test Solutions<br>
This example illustrates the use of the TBO product of Example 1 in the identification of oral dysplasia.<br>
The TBO product of Example 1, raspberry flavoring agent (IFF Raspberry IC563457), sodium acetate trihydrate buffering agent and H202 (30% USP) preservative (See U.S. Patent 5,372,801), are dissolved in purified water (USP), glacial acetic acid and SD 18 ethyl alcohol, to produce a TBO test solution, having the composition indicated in Table A:<br><br>
TABLE A<br>
Component	Weight %<br>
TBO Product	1.00<br>
Flavor	.20<br>
Buffering Agent	2.45<br>
Preservative	.41<br>
Acetic Acid	4.61<br>
Ethyl Alcohol	7.48<br>
Water	83.85<br>
100.00<br>
Pre-rinse and post-rinse test solutions of 1 wt.% acetic acid in purified water, sodium benzoate preservative and raspberry flavor are prepared.<br>
Clinical Protocol<br>
The patient is draped with a bib to protect clothing. Expectoration is expected, so the patient is provided with a 10-oz. cup, which can be disposed of in an infectious waste container or the contents of which can be poured directly into the center of a sink drain, to avoid staining the sink.  Environmental surfaces or objects which might be stained are draped or removed from the test area.<br>
A visual oral cancer examination is conducted, without using any instruments which might cause nicks or cuts of soft tissues.  Notations are made of the pre-staining<br><br>
appearance of soft tissues and teeth.<br>
The patient rinses the oral cavity with approximately 15  ml. of the pre-rinse solution for approximately 20 seconds and expectorates, to remove excess saliva and provide a consistent oral environment.  This step is then repeated with additional pre-rinse solution.<br>
The patient then rinses and gargles with water for 20 seconds and expectorates.<br>
The patient then rinses and gargles with 30 ml. of the TBO test solution for one minute and expectorates.<br>
The patient then rinses with 15 ml. of the post-rinse solution for 20 seconds and expectorates.  This step is then repeated.<br>
The patient then rinses and gargles with water for 20 seconds and expectorates.  This step is then repeated.<br>
Observations of the oral cavity are then made, using appropriate soft-tissue examination techniques, including retraction, well-balanced lighting and magnification, if necessary.  The location, size, morphology, color and surface characteristics of suspect lesions, that have retained blue coloration are made and recorded.<br>
In order to reduce false positives, the patient is brought back after 10-14 days for a repeat of the above protocol.  This period allows time for healing of any ulcerative or traumatic lesion or irritating etiology at the time of the first examination.  A positive stain after the second examination of a suspect area detected in the first examination is considered an indication of cancerous or precancerous tissue and a biopsy is made to confirm this conclusion.<br>
Early erythroplastic lesions stain blue, often in a stippled or patchy pattern.  However, it normal for the stain to be retained by the irregular papiliar crevices on the dorsum of the tongue, which is not a positive indication.  Other areas which retain blue stain, but are not regarded as positive include dental plaque, gingival margins of each tooth, diffuse stain of the soft palate because of dye transferred from the retained stain on the dorsum of the tongue, and ulcerative lesions which are easily distinguished.  In all instances, where a lesion is highly suspect, but does not stain positively with this test, it is nevertheless imperative that a biopsy be taken.<br>

Precision:     A minimum of five injections of the working sample are compared.  The Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) must be equal to or less than 2.0%.  Six injections are made if the RSD is<br>
greater than 2.0%, but less than 3.0% for the combined areas of peaks 5-8.<br>
Resolution:    Calculate the baseline resolution of<br>
peaks 7 and 8 (the major peaks) on one chromatogram of the sample by the following equation:<br>
R =   2 (t2 _ t 1) w1 + w2<br>
where<br>
t1 =  retention time, in mm, of	peak 7<br>
t2 =  retention time, in mm, of	peak 8<br>
W1 = peak width, in mm, of peak	7<br>
w2 = peak width, in mm, of peak	8<br>
The resolution between peaks 7 and 8 must be greater than 1.5.<br>
Tailing:   Measure the peak symmetry to insure the quantitation of area under the peak is accurate.  Calculate the tailing factor (T) for peaks 7 and 8 on one chromatogram of the sample, by the following equation:<br>
T = W0,05 ÷-2f<br>
where<br>
W0.o5 = width of peak<br>
determined at 5% from the baseline peak of the peak height<br><br><br>
f = distance between peak maximum and peak front at W0 05<br>
T should be less than a factor of 3.<br>
Record the chromatograms and determine the area response of the main peaks (5, 6, 7 and 8), as well as all impurity peaks which are detected (all peaks other than solvent front peaks) appearing in the chromatogram.<br>
Calculations and other HPLC Determinations<br>
Identity (TBO drug substance and drug product):<br>
The chromatographic profile of the sample preparation should show the same general profile (peak presence and peak intensities) as that of the chromatogram depicted in Fig. 2.<br>
Related Substances (drug substance):<br>
The quantity of each impurity peak (the known impurities designated as peaks 1, 2, 3 and 4 plus any other impurity peak) is calculated as an area percent versus the total area of all peaks in the chromatogram.<br>
re-Assay of the TBO drug substance:<br>
The percentage of each of the four main TBO peaks (peaks 5-8) is determined as for the impurities, i.e.,<br>
sum of peak areas 5-8<br>
HPLC Purity =  	     X 100<br>
sum of all peak areas<br>
