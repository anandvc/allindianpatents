POLYMER BLENDS FROM INTERPOLYMER OF ETHYLENE/AIPHA OLEFIN WITH<br>
IMPROVED COMPATIBILITY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[1|	This invention relates to polymer blends made from an ethylene/a-olefin<br>
interpolymer and at least two polyolefins, methods of making the blends, and articles made from the blends.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[2]	Multiphase polymer blends are of major economic importance in the polymer<br>
industry. Some examples of the multiphase polymer blends involve the impact modification of thermoplastics by the dispersion of rubber modifiers into the thermoplastic matrixes. In general, commercial polymer blends consist of two or more polymers combined with small amounts of a compatibilizer or an interfacial agent. Generally, the compatibilizers or interfacial agents are block or graft copolymers which can promote the forming of small rubber domains in the polymer blends so as to improve their impact strength.<br>
|3]	In many applications, blends of polypropylene (PP) and ethylene/a-olefln<br>
copolymers are used.   The ethylene/a-olefin copolymer functions as a rubber modifier in the blends and provides toughness and good impact strength.  In general, the impact efficiency of the ethylene/a-olefin copolymer may be a function of a) the glass transition (Tg) of the rubber modifier, b) the adhesion of the rubber modifier to the polypropylene interface, and c) the difference in the viscosities of the rubber modifier and polypropylene. The Tg of the rubber modifier can be improved by various methods such as decreasing the crystalliniry of the a-olefin component. Similarly, the viscosity difference of the rubber modifier and polypropylene can be optimized by various techniques such as adjusting the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the rubber modifier. For ethylene/higher alpha-olefm (HAO) copolymers, the interfacial adhesion of the copolymer can be increased by increasing the amount of the HAO.  However, when the amount of the HAO is greater than 55 mole % in the ethylene/HAO copolymer, the polypropylene become miscible with the ethylene/HAO copolymer and they form a single phase and there are no small rubber domains. Therefore, the ethylene/HAO copolymer with greater than 55 mole % of HAO has a limited utility as an impact modifier.<br>
14]	For thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPV's) where the rubber domains are<br>
crosslinked, it is desirable to improve properties such as compression set and tensile strength.<br><br>
These desirable properties can be improved by decreasing the average rubber particle size. During the dynamic vulcanization step of TPV's comprising polypropylene and a polyolefin inteipolymer such as ethylene/alpha-olefin/diene terpolymers (e.g., ethylene/propylene/diene terpolymer (EPDM)), there must be a balance of compatibility of the terpolymer with the polypropylene. In general, EPDM has a good compatibility with polypropylene, but the compatibility can only be marginally improved with increasing propylene level in EPDM.<br>
[5]	Despite the availability of a variety of polymer blends, there is a need to<br>
continue to develop polymer blends with improved properties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
(6)	The aforementioned needs are met by various aspects of the invention.<br>
In one aspect, the invention relates to polymer blends comprising: (i) a first polyolefin; (ii) a second polyolefin; and (iii) an ethylene/ct-olefin interpolymer, wherein the first polyolefin, the second polyolefin and the ethylene/o-olefin intexpolymer are different. The term "different" when referring to two polyolefins means that the two polyolefins differ in composition (comonomer type, comonomer content, etc.), structure, properties, or a combination thereof. For example, a block ethylene/octene copolymer is different than a random ethylene/octene copolymer, even if they have the same amount of comonomers. A block ethylene/octene copolymer is different than an ethylene/butane copolymer, regardless of whether it is a random or block copolymer or whether it has the same comonomer content Two polyolefins also are considered different if they have a different molecular weight, even though they have the same structure and composition. Moreover, a random homogeneous ethylene/octene copolymer is different than a random heterogenous ethylene/octene copolymer, even if all other parameters may be the same.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION General Definitions<br>
[38]	"Polymer" means a polymeric compound prepared by polymerizing<br>
monomers, whether of the same or a different type. The generic term "polymer'* embraces the terms "homopolymer," "copolymer," "terpolymer" as well as "interpolymer."<br>
[39]	"Interpolymer" means a polymer prepared by the polymerization of at least<br>
two different types of monomers. The generic term "interpolymer" includes the term "copolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer prepared from two different monomers) as well as the term "terpolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer prepared from three different types of monomers). It also encompasses polymers made by polymerizing four or more types of monomers.<br>
[40]	The term "ethylene/a-olefm interpolymer'* generally refers to polymers<br>
comprising ethylene and an a -olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms. Preferably, ethylene<br><br>
comprises the majority mole fraction of the whole polymer, i.e., ethylene comprises at least about 50 mole percent of the whole polymer. More preferably ethylene comprises at least about 60 mole percent, at least about 70 mole percent, or at least about 80 mole percent, with the substantial remainder of the whole polymer comprising at least one other comonorner that is preferably an a-olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms. For many ethylene/octene copolymers, the preferred composition comprises an ethylene content greater than about 80 mole percent of the whole polymer and an octene content of from about 10 to about 15, preferably from about 15 to about 20 mole percent of the whole polymer. In some embodiments, the ethylenc/a-olefin interpolymers do not include those produced in low yields or in a minor amount or as a by-product of a chemical process. While the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers can be blended with one or more polymers, the as-produced ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are substantially pure and often comprise a major component of the reaction product of a polymerization process.<br>
|41]	The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers comprise ethylene and one or more<br>
copolymerizable a-olefm comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties. That is, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are block interpolymers, preferably multi-block interpolymers or copolymers. The terms "interpolymer" and copolymer" are used interchangeably herein. In some embodiments, the multi-block copolymer can be represented by the following formula:<br><br>
where n is at least 1, preferably an integer greater than 1, such as 2,3,4,5, 10,15,20,30,40, 50,60, 70, 80,90, 100, or higher, "A" represents a hard block or segment and UB" represents a soft block or segment. Preferably, As and Bs are linked in a substantially linear fashion, as opposed to a substantially branched or substantially star-shaped fashion. In other embodiments, A blocks and B blocks are randomly distributed along the polymer chain. In other words, the block copolymers usually do not have a structure as follows.<br>
In still other embodiments, the block copolymers do not usually have a third type of block, which comprises different comonomer(s). In yet other embodiments, each of block A and block B has monomers or comonomers substantially randomly distributed within the block. In other words, neither block A nor block B comprises two or more sub-segments (or sub-<br><br>
blocks) of distinct composition, such as a tip segment, which has a substantially different composition than the rest of the block.<br>
[42]	The multi-block polymers typically comprise various amounts of "hard" and<br>
"soft" segments. "Hard" segments refer to blocks of polymerized units in which ethylene is present in an amount greater than about 95 weight percent, and preferably greater than about 98 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer. In other words, the comonomer content (content of monomers other than ethylene) in the hard segments is less than about 5 weight percent, and preferably less than about 2 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer. In some embodiments, the hard segments comprises all or substantially all ethylene. "Soft" segments, on the other hand, refer to blocks of polymerized units in which the comonomer content (content of monomers other than ethylene) is greater than about 5 weight percent, preferably greater than about 8 weight percent, greater than about 10 weight percent, or greater than about 15 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer. In some embodiments, the comonomer content in the soft segments can be greater than about 20 weight percent, greater than about 25 weight percent, greater than about 30 weight percent, greater than about 35 weight percent, greater than about 40 weight percent, greater than about 45 weight percent, greater than about 50 weight percent, or greater than about 60 weight percent.<br>
143]	The soft segments can often be present in a block interpolymer from about 1<br>
weight percent to about 99 weight percent of the total weight of the block interpolymer, preferably from about 5 weight percent to about 95 weight percent, from about 10 weight percent to about 90 weight percent, from about 15 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, from about 20 weight percent to about 80 weight percent, from about 25 weight percent to about 75 weight percent, from about 30 weight percent to about 70 weight percent, from about 35 weight percent to about 65 weight percent, from about 40 weight percent to about 60 weight percent, or from about 45 weight percent to about 55 weight percent of the total weight of the block interpolymer. Conversely, the hard segments can be present in similar ranges. The soft segment weight percentage and the hard segment weight percentage can be calculated based on data obtained from DSC orNMR.

known), Attorney Docket No. 385063-999558, entitled "Ethylene/ct-Olefin Block Intcrpolymers", filed on March 15,2006, in the name of Colin L.P. Shan, Lonnie Hazlitt, ct.<br><br>

[44]	The term "crystalline" if employed, refers to a polymer that possesses a first<br>
order transition or crystalline melting point (Tm) as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique. The term may be used interchangeably with the term "semicrystalline". The term "amorphous" refers to a polymer lacking a crystalline melting point as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique.<br>
[451	The term "multi-block copolymer*' or "segmented copolymer" refers to a<br>
polymer comprising two or more chemically distinct regions or segments (referred to as "blocks") preferably joined in a linear manner, that is, a polymer comprising chemically differentiated units which are joined end-to-end with respect to polymerized ethylenic functionality, rather than in pendent or grafted fashion. In a preferred embodiment, the blocks differ in the amount or type of comonomer incorporated therein, the density, the amount of crystallinity, the crystallite size attributable to a polymer of such composition, the type or degree of tacticity (isotactic or syndiotactic), regio-regularity or regio-irregularity, the amount of branching, including long chain branching or hyper-branching, the homogeneity, or any other chemical or physical property. The multi-block copolymers are characterized by unique distributions of both polydispersity index (PDI or Mw/Mn), block length distribution, and/or block number distribution due to the unique process making of the copolymers. More specifically, when produced in a continuous process, the polymers desirably possess PDI from 1.7 to 2.9, preferably from 1.8 to 2.5, more preferably from 1.8 to 2.2, and most preferably from 1.8 to 2.1. When produced in a batch or semi-batch process, the polymers possess PDI from 1.0 to 2.9, preferably from 1.3 to 2.5, more preferably from 1.4 to 2.0, and most preferably from 1.4 to 1.8.<br>
[46]	The term "compatibilizer" refers to a polymer that, when added to an<br>
immiscible polymer blend, can increase the miscibility of the two polymers resulting in an increased stability in the blend. In some embodiments, the compatabilizer can reduce the average domain size by at least 20%, more preferably at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50%, when about 15 weight percent of the compatibilizer is added to the blend. In other embodiments, the compatabilizer can increase the miscibility of two or more polymers by at<br><br>
least 10%, more preferably at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50%, when about 15 weight percent of the compatibilizer is added to the blend.<br>
[47]	The term "immiscible" refers to two polymers when they do not form a<br>
homogenous mixture after being mixed. In other words, phase separation occurs in the mixture. One method to quantify the immiscibiiity of two polymers is to use Hildbrand's solubility parameter which is a measure of the total forces holding the molecules of a solid or liquid together. Every polymer is characterized by a specific value of solubility parameter, although it is not always available. Polymers with similar solubility parameter values tend to be miscible. On the other hand, those with significantly different solubility parameters tend to be immiscible, although there are many exceptions to this behavior. Discussions of solubility parameter concepts are presented in (I) Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Interscience, New York (1965), Vol. 3, pg. 833; (2) Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Interscience, New York (1971), Supp. Vol., pg. 889; and (3) Polymer Handbook, 3rd Ed., J. Brandup and E. H. Immergut (Eds.), (1989), John Wiley &amp; Sons "Solubility Parameter Values," pp. VH-519, which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.<br>
[48]	The term "interfacial agent" refers to an additive that reduces the interfacial<br>
energy between phase domains.<br>
|49)	The term "olefin" refers to a hydrocarbon contains at least one carbon-carbon<br>
double bond.<br>
[50]	The term "thermoplastic vulcanizate" (TPV) refers to an engineering<br>
thermoplastic elastomer in which a cured elastomeric phase is dispersed in a thermoplastic matrix. The TPV generally comprises at least one thermoplastic material and at least one cured (i.e., cross-linked) elastomeric material. In some embodiments, the thermoplastic material forms the continuous phase, and the cured elastomer forms the discrete phase; that is, domains of the cured elastomer are dispersed in the thermoplastic matrix. In other embodiments, the domains of the cured elastomer are fully and uniformly dispersed with the average domain size in the range from about 0.1 micron to about 100 micron, from about 1 micron to about 50 microns; from about 1 micron to about 25 microns; from about 1 micron to about 10 microns, or from about 1 micron to about 5 microns. In certain embodiments, the matrix phase of the TPV is present by less than about 50% by volume of the TPV, and the dispersed phase is present by at least about 50% by volume of the TPV. In other words, the crpsslinked elastomeric phase is the major phase in the TPV, whereas the thermoplastic<br><br>
polymer is the minor phase. TPVs with such phase composition can have good compression set. However, TPVs with the major phase being the thermoplastic polymer and the minor phase being the cross-linked elastomer may also be made. Generally, the cured elastomer has a portion that is insoluble in cyclohexane at 23°C. The amount of the insoluble portion is preferably more than about 75% or about 85%. In some cases, the insoluble amount is more than about 90%, more than about 93%, more than about 95% or more than about 97% by weight of the total elastomer.<br>
[51]	In the following description, all numbers disclosed herein are approximate<br>
values, regardless whether the word "about" or "approximate" is used in connection therewith. They may vary by 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, or, sometimes, 10 to 20 percent. Whenever a numerical range with a lower limit, RL and an upper limit, Ru, is disclosed, any number falling within the range is specifically disclosed. In particular, the following numbers within the range are specifically disclosed: R-RL+k*(Ru-RL), wherein k is a variable ranging from 1 percent to 100 percent with a 1 percent increment, i.e., k is 1 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent,..., 50 percent, 51 percent, 52 percent,..., 95 percent, 96 percent, 97 percent, 98 percent, 99 percent, or 100 percent. Moreover, any numerical range defined by two R numbers as defined in the above is also specifically disclosed.<br>
[52]	Embodiments of the invention provide polymer blends comprising at least one<br>
ethylene/a-olefln interpolymer and at least two polyolefins. The polymer blends with improved compatibility possess unique physical and mechanical properties that axe suitable for making molded articles for a variety of applications. The ethylene/ a-olefin interpolymer can improve the compatibility of the two polyolefins which otherwise may be relatively incompatible. In other words, the interpolymer is a compatibilizer between two or more polyolefins. Ethvlene/a-Olefm Interpolvmers<br>
|53]	The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymcrs used in embodiments of the invention<br>
(also referred to as "inventive interpolymer" or "inventive polymer") comprise ethylene and one or more copolyrnerizable a-olefin comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (block interpolymer), preferably a multi-block copolymer. The ethylene/ a-olefin interpolymers are characterized by one or more of the aspects described as follows.<br><br>
[54]	In one aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers used in embodiments of tbe<br>
invention have a Mw/M„ from about 1.7 to about 3.5 and at least one melting point, Tm, in degrees Celsius and density, d, in grams/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of the variables correspond to the relationship:<br>
Tra &gt; -2002.9 + 4538.5(d) - 2422.2(d)2, and preferably<br>
Tra&gt;-6288.1 + 13141(d)-6720.3(d)2, and more preferably<br>
Tro &gt; 858.91 - 1825.3(d) + 1112.8(d)2.<br>
[55]	Such melting point/density relationship is illustrated in Figure 1. Unlike the<br>
traditional random copolymers of ethylene/a-olefins whose melting points decrease with decreasing densities, the inventive interpolymers (represented by diamonds) exhibit melting points substantially independent of the density, particularly when density is between about 0.87 g/cc to about 0.95 g/cc. For example, the melting point of such polymers are in the range of about 110 °C to about 130 °C when density ranges from 0.875 g/cc to about 0.945 g/cc. In some embodiments, the melting point of such polymers are in the range of about 115 °C to about 125 °C when density ranges from 0.875 g/cc to about 0.945 g/cc.<br>
[56]	In another aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers comprise, in<br>
polymerized form, ethylene and one or more a-olefins and are characterized by a AT, in degree Celsius, defined as the temperature for the tallest Differential Scanning Calorimetry ("DSC") peak minus the temperature for the tallest Crystallization Analysis Fractionation ("CRYSTAF") peak and a heat of fusion in J/g, AH, and AT and AH satisfy the following relationships:<br>
AT &gt; -0.1299(AH) + 62.81, and preferably<br>
AT&gt; -0.1299(AH) + 64.38, and more preferably<br>
AT&gt;-0.1299(AH) + 65.95, for AH up to 130 J/g. Moreover, AT is equal to or greater than 48 °C for AH greater than 130 J/g. The CRYSTAF peak is determined using at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer (that is, the peak must represent at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer), and if less than 5 percent of the polymer has an identifiable CRYSTAF peak, then the CRYSTAF temperature is 30°C, and AH is the numerical value of the heat of fusion in J/g. More preferably, the highest CRYSTAF peak contains at least 10 percent of the cumulative polymer. Figure 2 shows plotted data for inventive polymers as well as comparative examples. Integrated peak areas and peak temperatures are calculated by the computerized<br><br>
drawing program supplied by the instrument maker. The diagonal line shown for the random ethylene octene comparative polymers corresponds to the equation AT = -0.1299 (AH) + 62.81.<br>
[57]	In yet another aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a molecular<br>
fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C when fractionated using Temperature Rising Ehition Fractionation (vlTREFr)&gt; characterized in that said fraction has a molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting between the same temperatures, wherein the comparable random ethylene interpolymer contains the same comonomer(s), and has a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the block interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the block interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the block interpolymer.<br>
[58]	In still another aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are characterized by<br>
an elastic recovery, Re, in percent at 300 percent strain and 1 cycle measured on a compression-molded film of an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, and has a density, d, in grams/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of Re and d satisfy the following relationship when ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is substantially free of a cross-linked phase:<br>
Re &gt; 1481 -1629(d); and preferably<br>
Re &gt;1491-1629(d); and more preferably<br>
Re &gt; 1501-1629(d); and even more preferably<br>
Re&gt;1511-1629(d).<br>
[59]	Figure 3 shows the effect of density on elastic recovery for unoriented films<br>
comprising certain inventive interpolymers and traditional random copolymers. For the same density, the inventive interpolymers have substantially higher elastic recoveries.<br>
[60]	In some embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a tensile<br>
strength above 10 MPa, preferably a tensile strength &gt; 11 MPa, more preferably a tensile strength &gt; 13MPa and/or an elongation at break of at least 600 percent, more preferably at least 700 percent, highly preferably at least 800 percent, and most highly preferably at least 900 percent at a crosshead separation rate of 11 cm/minute.<br><br>
[61]	In other embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have (1) a storage<br>
modulus ratio, G,(25°C)/G,(100°C), of from 1 to 50, preferably from 1 to 20, more preferably from 1 to 10; and/or (2) a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, preferably less than 70 percent, especially less than 60 percent, less than 50 percent, or less than 40 percent, down to a compression set of 0 percent<br>
[62]	In still other embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a 70°C<br>
compression set of less than 80 percent, less than 70 percent, less than 60 percent, or less than 50 percent. Preferably, the 70°C compression set of the interpolymers is less than 40 percent, less than 30 percent, less than 20 percent, and may go down to about 0 percent.<br>
{63]	In some embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a heat of<br>
fusion of less than 85 J/g and/or a pellet blocking strength of equal to or less than 100 pounds/foot2 (4800 Pa), preferably equal to or less than 50 lbs/ft2 (2400 Pa), especially equal to or less than 5 lbs/ft2 (240 Pa), and as low as 0 lbs/ft2 (0 Pa).<br>
[64]	In other embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers comprise, in<br>
polymerized form, at least 50 mole percent ethylene and have a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, preferably less than 70 percent or less than 60 percent, most preferably less than 40 to 50 percent and down to close zero percent.<br>
[65]	In some embodiments, the multi-block copolymers possess a PDI fitting a<br>
Schultz-Floiy distribution rather than a Poisson distribution. The copolymers are further characterized as having both a polydisperse block distribution and a polydisperse distribution of block sizes and possessing a most probable distribution of black lengths. Preferred multi-block copolymers are those containing 4 or more blocks or segments including terminal blocks. More preferably, the copolymers include at least 5,10 or 20 blocks or segments including terminal blocks.<br>
[66]	Comonomer content may be measured using any suitable technique, with<br>
techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance ("NMR") spectroscopy preferred. Moreover, for polymers or blends of polymers having relatively broad TREF curves, the polymer desirably is first fractionated using TREF into fractions each having an eluted temperature range of 10°C or less. That is, each eluted fraction has a collection temperature window of 10°C or less. Using this technique, said block interpolymers have at least one such fraction having a higher molar comonomer content than a corresponding fraction of the comparable interpolymer.<br><br>
167]	In another aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer, preferably<br>
comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonorners in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks (i.e., at least two blocks) or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a peak (but not just a molecular fraction) which ehites between 40°C and 130°C (but without collecting and/or isolating individual fractions), characterized in that said peak, has a comonomer content estimated by infra-red spectroscopy when expanded using a full width/half maximum (FWHM) area calculation, has an average molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer peak at the same elution temperature and expanded using a full width/half maximum (FWHM) area calculation, wherein said comparable random ethylene interpolymer has the same comonomer(s) and has a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. The full width/half maximum (FWHM) calculation is based on the ratio of methyl to methylene response area [CH3/CH2] from the ATREF infra-red detector, wherein the tallest (highest) peak is identified from the base line, and then the FWHM area is determined. For a distribution measured using an ATREF peak, the FWHM area is defined as the area under the curve between Tj and T2, where Ti and T2 are points determined, to the left and right of the ATREF peak, by dividing the peak height by two, and then drawing a line horizontal to the base line, that intersects the left and right portions of the ATREF curve.   A calibration curve for comonomer content is made using random ethylene/a-olefin copolymers, plotting comonomer content from NMR versus FWHM area ratio of the TREF peak. For this infra-red method, the calibration curve is generated for the same comonomer type of interest. The comonomer content of TREF peak of the inventive polymer can be determined by referencing this calibration curve using its FWHM methyl: methylene area ratio [CH3/CH2] of the TREF peak.<br>
(68)	Comonomer content may be measured using any suitable technique, with<br>
techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy preferred. Using this<br><br>
technique, said blocked interpolymers has higher molar comonomer content than a corresponding comparable interpolymer.<br>
|69J	Preferably, for interpolymers of ethylene and l-octene, the block interpolymer<br>
has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting between 40 and 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.2013) T + 20.07, more preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013) T+ 21.07, where T is the numerical value of the peak efution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C.<br>
|70]	Figure 4 graphically depicts an embodiment of the block interpolymers of<br>
ethylene and 1-octene where a plot of the comonomer content versus TREF elution temperature for several comparable ethylene/1-octene interpolymers (random copolymers) are fit to a line representing (- 0.2013) T + 20.07 (solid line). The line for the equation (-0.2013) T + 21.07 is depicted by a dotted line. Also depicted are the comonomer contents for fractions of several block ethylene/1-octene interpolymers of the invention (multi-block copolymers). All of the block interpolymer fractions have significantly higher 1-octene content than either line at equivalent elution temperatures. This result is characteristic of the inventive interpolymer and is believed to be due to the presence of differentiated blocks within the polymer chains, having both crystalline and amorphous nature.<br>
|71J	Figure 5 graphically displays the TREF curve and comonomer contents of<br>
polymer fractions for Example 5 and Comparative Example F* to be discussed below. The peak eluting from 40 to 130°C, preferably from 60CC to 95°C for both polymers is fractionated into three parts, each part eluting over a temperature range of less than 10°C. Actual data for Example 5 is represented by triangles. The skilled artisan can appreciate that an appropriate calibration curve may be constructed for interpolymers containing different comonomers and a line used as a comparison fitted to the TREF values obtained from comparative interpolymers of the same monomers, preferably random copolymers made using a metallocene or other homogeneous catalyst composition. Inventive interpolymers are characterized by a molar comonomer content greater than the value determined from the calibration curve at the same TREF elution temperature, preferably at least 5 percent greater, more preferably at least 10 percent greater.<br>
(72J	In addition to the above aspects and properties described herein, the inventive<br>
polymers can be characterized by one or more additional characteristics. In one aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more<br><br>
copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130DC, when fractionated using TREF increments, characterized in that said fraction has a molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10, 15,20 or 25 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting between the same temperatures, wherein said comparable random ethylene interpolymer comprises the same comonomer(s), preferably it is the same comonomer(s), and a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the blocked interpolymer.<br>
[73]	Preferably, the above interpolymers are interpolymers of ethylene and at least<br>
one a-olefm, especially those interpolymers having a whole polymer density from about 0.855 to about 0.935 g/cm , and more especially for polymers having more than about 1 mole percent comonomer, the blocked interpolymer has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting between 40 and 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.1356) T + 13.89, more preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.1356) T+ 14.93, and most preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013)T + 21.07, where T is the numerical value of the peak ATREF elution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C.<br>
[74J	Preferably, for the above interpolymers of ethylene and at least one alpha-<br>
olefin especially those interpolymers having a whole polymer density from about 0.855 to about 0.935 g/cm3, and more especially for polymers having more than about 1 mole percent comonomer, the blocked interpolymer has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting between 40 and 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.2013) T + 20.07, more preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013) T+ 21.07, where T is the numerical value of the peak elution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C.<br>
[75]	In still another aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer,<br>
preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in<br><br>
polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C, when fractionated using TREF increments, characterized in that every fraction having a cornonomer content of at least about 6 mole percent, has a melting point greater than about 100°C. For those fractions having a cornonomer content from about 3 mole percent to about 6 mole percent, every fraction has a DSC melting point of about 110°C or higher. More preferably, said polymer fractions, having at least 1 mol percent cornonomer, has a DSC melting point that corresponds to the equation:<br>
Tm &gt; (-5.5926)(mol percent cornonomer in the fraction) + 135.90.<br>
[76)	In yet another aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer,<br>
preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C, when fractionated using TREF increments, characterized in that every fraction that has an ATREF elution temperature greater than or equal to about 76°C, has a melt enthalpy (heat effusion) as measured by DSC, corresponding to the equation:<br>

 <br>
ATREF Peak Comonomer Composition Measurement by Infra-Red Detector<br>
[78]	The comonomer composition of the TREF peak can be measured using an IR4<br>
infra-red detector available from Polymer Char, Valencia, Spain (http:/Ayww.polvmerchar.com/V<br>
[79]	The "composition mode" of the detector is equipped with a measurement<br>
sensor (CH2) and composition sensor (CH3) that are fixed narrow band infra-red filters in the region of 2800-3000 cm*1. The measurement sensor detects the methylene (CH2) carbons on the polymer (which directly relates to the polymer concentration in solution) while the composition sensor detects the methyl (CH3) groups of the polymer. The mathematical ratio of the composition signal (CH3) divided by the measurement signal (CH2) is sensitive to the comonomer content of the measured polymer in solution and its response is calibrated with known ethylene alpha-olefin copolymer standards.<br>
[80]	The detector when used with an ATREF instrument provides both a<br>
concentration (CH2) and composition (CH3) signal response of the eluted polymer during the TREF process. A polymer specific calibration can be created by measuring the area ratio of the CH3 to CH2 for polymers with known comonomer content (preferably measured by NMR). The comonomer content of an ATREF peak of a polymer can be estimated by applying a the reference calibration of the ratio of the areas for the individual CH3 and CH2 response (i.e. area ratio CH3/CH2 versus comonomer content).<br>
f81]	The area of the peaks can be calculated using a full width/half maximum<br>
(FWHM) calculation after applying the appropriate baselines to integrate the individual signal responses from the TREF chromatogram. The full width/half maximum calculation is based on the ratio of methyl to methylene response area [CH3/CH2] from the ATREF infrared detector, wherein the tallest (highest) peak is identified from the base line, and then the FWHM area is determined. For a distribution measured using an ATREF peak, the FWHM area is defined as the area under the curve between Tl and T2, where Tl and T2 are points determined, to the left and right of the ATREF peak, by dividing the peak height by two, and then drawing a line horizontal to the base line, that intersects the left and right portions of the ATREF curve.<br>
|82|	The application of infra-red spectroscopy to measure the comonomer content<br>
of polymers in this ATREF-infra-red method is, in principle, similar to that of GPC/FTIR systems as described in the following references: Markovich, Ronald P.; Hazlirt, Lonnie G.;<br><br>
Smith, Linley; "Development of gel-permeation chromatography-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for characterization of ethyiene-based polyolefin copolymers". Polymeric Materials Science and Engineering (1991), 65,98-100.; and Deslauriers, P.J.; Rohlfing, D.C.; Shieh, E.T.; "Quantifying short chain branching microstructures in ethylene-1-olefin copolymers using size exclusion chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SEC-FTIR)", Polymer (2002), 43, 59-170., both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
[83]	In other embodiments, the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is<br>
characterized by an average block index, ABI, which is greater than zero and up to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, greater than about 1.3. The average block index, ABI, is the weight average of the block index ("BI") for each of the polymer fractions obtained in preparative TREF from 20°C and 110°C, with an increment of 5°C :<br><br>
where BIj is the block index for the ith fraction of the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer obtained in preparative TREF, and w* is the weight percentage of the ith fraction,<br>
[84]	For each polymer fraction, BI is defined by one of the two following equations<br>
(both of which give the same Bl value):<br><br>
where Tx is the preparative ATREF elution temperature for the ith fraction (preferably expressed in Kelvin), Px is the ethylene mole fraction for the ith fraction, which can be measured by NMR or IR as described above. PAB is the ethylene mole fraction of the whole ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer (before fractionation), which also can be measured by NMR or IR. TA and PA are the ATREF elution temperature and the ethylene mole fraction for pure "hard segments" (which refer to the crystalline segments of the interpolymer). As a first order approximation, the TA and PA values are set to those for high density polyethylene homopolymer, if the actual values for the "hard segments" are not available. For calculations performed herein, TA is 372°K, PA is 1.<br><br>
[85]	TAB is the ATREF temperature for a random copolymer of the same<br>
composition and having an ethylene mole fraction of PAB. TAB can be calculated from the following equation:<br><br>
where a and p are two constants which can be determined by calibration using a number of known random ethylene copolymers. It should be noted that a and p may vary from instrument to instrument. Moreover, one would need to create their own calibration curve with the polymer composition of interest and also in a similar molecular weight range as the fractions. There is a slight molecular weight effect If the calibration curve is obtained from similar molecular weight ranges, such effect would be essentially negligible. In some embodiments, random ethylene copolymers satisfy the following relationship:<br><br>
Txo is the ATREF temperature for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ethylene mole fraction of Px- TXo can be calculated from LnPx = a/Txo + P-Conversely, Pxo is the ethylene mole fraction for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ATREF temperature of Tx, which can be calculated from Ln Pxo = a/Tx + p.<br>
[86]	Once the block index (B3) for each preparative TREF fraction is obtained, the<br>
weight average block index, ABI, for the whole polymer can be calculated. In some embodiments, ABI is greater than zero but less than about 03 or from about 0.1 to about 0.3. In other embodiments, ABI is greater than about 0.3 and up to about 1.0. Preferably, ABI should be in the range of from about 0.4 to about 0.7, from about 0.5 to about 0.7, or from about 0.6 to about 0.9. In some embodiments, ABI is in the range of from about 0.3 to about 0.9, from about 0.3 to about 0.8, or from about 0.3 to about 0.7, from about 0.3 to about 0.6, from about 0.3 to about 0.5, or from about 0.3 to about 0.4. In other embodiments, ABI is in the range of from about 0.4 to about 1.0, from about 0.5 to about 1.0, or from about 0.6 to about 1.0, from about 0.7 to about 1.0, from about 0.8 to about 1.0, or from about 0.9 to about 1.0,<br>
(87)	Another characteristic of the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is that<br>
the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer comprises at least one polymer fraction which can be obtained by preparative TREF, wherein the fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn&gt; greater than about<br><br>
1.3. In some embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.6 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.7 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.8 and up to about 1.0, or greater than about 0.9 and up to about 1.0. In other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.2 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0, or greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0. In still other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 0.5, greater than about 0.2 and up to about 0.5, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.5, or greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.5. In yet other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.2 and up to about 0.9, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.8, greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.7, or greater than about 0.5 and up to about 0.6.<br>
[88]	For copolymers of ethylene and an a-olefin, the inventive polymers preferably<br>
possess (1) a PD1 of at least 1.3, more preferably at least 1.5, at least 1.7, or at least 2.0, and most preferably at least 2.6, up to a maximum value of 5.0, more preferably up to a maximum of 3.5, and especially up to a maximum of 2.7; (2) a heat of fusion of 80 J/g or less; (3) an ethylene content of at least 50 weight percent; (4) a glass transition temperature, Tg, of less than -25°C, more preferably less than -30°C, and/or (5) one and only one Tm.<br>
[89]	Further, the inventive polymers can have, alone or in combination with any<br>
other properties disclosed herein, a storage modulus, G\ such that log (G') is greater than or equal to 400 kPa, preferably greater than or equal to 1.0 MPa, at a temperature of 100°C. Moreover, the inventive polymers possess a relatively flat storage modulus as a function of temperature in the range from 0 to 100°C (illustrated in Figure 6) that is characteristic of block copolymers, and heretofore unknown for an olefin copolymer, especially a copolymer of ethylene and one or more C&gt;8 aliphatic a-olefins. (By the term "relatively flat" in this context is meant that log G* (in Pascals) decreases by less than one order of magnitude between 50 and 100°C, preferably between 0 and 100°C).<br>
[90]	The inventive interpolymers may be further characterized by a<br>
thermomechanical analysis penetration depth of 1 mm at a temperature of at least 90°C as well as a flexural modulus of from 3 kpsi (20 MPa) to 13 kpsi (90 MPa). Alternatively, the inventive interpolymers can have a thermomechanical analysis penetration depth of 1 mm at a temperature of at least 104°C as well as a flexural modulus of at least 3 kpsi (20 MPa). They may be characterized as having an abrasion resistance (or volume loss) of less than 90<br><br>
mm3. Figure 7 shows the TMA (1 mm) versus flex modulus for the inventive polymers, as compared to other known polymers. The inventive polymers have significantly better flexibility-heat resistance balance than the other polymers.<br>
[91)	Additionally, the ethylene/ a-olefin interpolymers can have a melt index, I2,<br>
from 0.01 to 2000 g/10 minutes, preferably from 0.01 to 1000 g/10 minutes, more preferably from 0.01 to 500 g/10 minutes, and especially from 0.01 to 100 g/10 minutes. In certain embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a melt index, I2, from 0.01 to 10 g/10 minutes, from 0.5 to 50 g/10 minutes, from 1 to 30 g/10 minutes, from 1 to 6 g/10 minutes or from 0.3 to 10 g/10 minutes. In certain embodiments, the melt index for the ethylene/a-olefin polymers is lg/10 minutes, 3 g/10 minutes or 5 g/10 minutes.<br>
J92]	The polymers can have molecular weights, Mw, from 1,000 g/mole to<br>
5,000,000 g/mole, preferably from 1000 g/mole to 1,000,000, more preferably from 10,000 g/mole to 500,000 g/mole, and especially from 10,000 g/mole to 300,000 g/mole. The density of the inventive polymers can be from 0.80 to 0.99 g/cm3 and preferably for ethylene containing polymers from 0.85 g/cm3 to 0.97 g/cm3. In certain embodiments, the density of the ethylene/a-olefin polymers ranges from 0.860 to 0.925 g/cm3 or 0.867 to 0.910 g/cm3.<br>
[93]	The process of making the polymers has been disclosed in the following patent<br>
applications: U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/553,906, filed March 17,2004; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/662,937, filed March 17,2005; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/662,939, filed March 17,2005; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/5662938, filed March 17,2005; PCT Application No. PCT/US2005/008916, filed March 17, 2005; PCT Application No. PCT/US2005/008915, filed March 17,2005; and PCT Application No. PCT/US2005/008917, filed March 17,2005, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

[104]        Shuttling Agents The shuttling agents employed include diethylzinc, di(i-butyl)zinc, di(n-hexyl)zinc, tri ethylaluminum, trioctylaluminum, triethylgallium, i-butylaluminum bis(dimetbyl(t-buryl)siloxane), i-butylaluminum bis(di(lrimethylsilyl)amide), n-octylaluminum di(pyridine-2-metboxide), bis(n-octadecyl)i-butylaiuminum, i-butylaluminum bis(di(n-pentyl)amide), n-octylaluminum bis(2,6-di-l-butylphenoxide, n-octylaluminum di(ethyl(l-naphthyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(t-butyldimethylsiloxide), eihyiahsrninum di(bis(trimethylsilyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-azacycSoheptaneamide), n-octylaluminum bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-azacycloheptaneamide), n-octylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t-butyl)siloxide, ethyl2inc (2,6-diphenylphenoxide), and ethylzinc (t-butoxide).<br>
[105]	Preferably, the foregoing process takes the form of a continuous solution<br>
process fox forming block copolymers, especially multi-block copolymers, preferably linear multi-block copolymers of two or more monomers, more especially ethylene and a C3.20 olefin or cycloolefm, and most especially ethylene and a C4.20 a-olefin, using multiple catalysts that are incapable of interconversion. That is, the catalysts are chemically distinct. Under continuous solution polymerization conditions, the process is ideally suited for polymerization of mixtures of monomers at high monomer conversions. Under these polymerization conditions, shuttling from the chain shuttling agent to the catalyst becomes advantaged compared to chain growth, and multi-block copolymers, especially linear multi-block copolymers are formed in high efficiency.<br>
[106]	The inventive interpolymers may be differentiated from conventional, random<br>
copolymers, physical blends of polymers, and block copolymers prepared via sequential monomer addition, flux ion a] catalysts, anionic or cationic living polymerization techniques. In particular, compared to a random copolymer of the same monomers and monomer content<br><br>
at equivalent crystallinity or modulus, the inventive interpolymers have better (higher) heat resistance as measured by melting point, higher TMA penetration temperature, higher higb-temperature tensile strength, and/or higher high-temperature torsion storage modulus as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Compared to a random copolymer containing the same monomers and monomer content, the inventive interpolymers have lower compression set, particularly at elevated temperatures, lower stress relaxation, higher creep resistance, higher tear strength, higher blocking resistance, faster setup due to higher crystallization (solidification) temperature, higher recovery (particularly at elevated temperatures), better abrasion resistance, higher retractive force, and better oil and filler acceptance.<br>
[107]        The inventive interpolymers also exhibit a unique crystallization and branching distribution relationship. That is, the inventive interpolymers have a relatively large difference between the tallest peak temperature measured using CRYSTAF and DSC as a function of heat of fusion, especially as compared to random copolymers containing the same monomers and monomer level or physical blends of polymers, such as a blend of a high density polymer and a lower density copolymer, at equivalent overall density. It is believed that this unique feature of the inventive interpolymers is due to the unique distribution of the comonomer in blocks within the polymer backbone. In particular, the inventive interpolymers may comprise alternating blocks of differing comonomer content (including homopolymer blocks). The inventive interpolymers may also comprise a distribution in number and/or block size of polymer blocks of differing density or comonomer content, which is a Schultz-Floiy type of distribution. In addition, the inventive interpolymers also have a unique peak melting point and crystallization temperature profile that is substantially independent of polymer density, modulus, and morphology. In a preferred embodiment, the microcrystalline order of the polymers demonstrates characteristic spherulites and lamellae that are distinguishable from random or block copolymers, even at PDI values that are less than 1.7, or even less than 1.5, down to less than 1.3.<br>
(108]        Moreover, the inventive interpolymers may be prepared using techniques to influence the degree or level of blockincss. That is the amount of comonomer and length of each polymer block or segment can be altered by controlling the ratio and type of catalysts and shuttling agent as well as the temperature of the polymerization, and other polymerization variables. A surprising benefit of this phenomenon is the discovery that as<br><br>
the degree of blockiness is increased, the optical properties, tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties of the resulting polymer are improved. In particular, haze decreases while clarity, tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties increase as the average number of blocks in the polymer increases. By selecting shuttling agents and catalyst combinations having the desired chain transferring ability (high rates of shuttling with low levels of chain termination) other forms of polymer termination are effectively suppressed. Accordingly, little if any p-hydride elimination is observed in the polymerization of ethylene/ a-olefm comonomer mixtures according to embodiments of the invention, and the resulting crystalline blocks are highly, or substantially completely, linear, possessing little or no long chain branching.<br>
[1091	Polymers with highly crystalline chain ends can be selectively prepared in<br>
accordance with embodiments of the invention. In elastomer applications, reducing the relative quantity of polymer that terminates with an amorphous block reduces the intermolecular dilutive effect on crystalline regions. This result can be obtained by choosing chain shuttling agents and catalysts having an appropriate response to hydrogen or other chain terminating agents. Specifically, if the catalyst which produces highly crystalline polymer is more susceptible to chain termination (such as by use of hydrogen) than the catalyst responsible for producing the less crystalline polymer segment (such as through higher comonomer incorporation, regio-error, or atactic polymer formation), then the highly crystalline polymer segments will preferentially populate the terminal portions of the polymer. Not only are the resulting terminated groups crystalline, but upon termination, the highly crystalline polymer forming catalyst site is once again available for reinitiation of polymer formation. The initially formed polymer is therefore another highly crystalline polymer segment Accordingly, both ends of the resulting multi-block copolymer are preferentially highly crystalline.<br>
11101	The ethylene a-olefm interpolymers used in the embodiments of the invention<br>
are preferably interpolymers of ethylene with at least one C3-C20 ct-olefin. Copolymers of ethylene and a C3-C2O a-olefin are especially preferred. The interpolymers may further comprise C4-C18 diolcfin and/or alkenylbenzene. Suitable unsaturated comonomers useful for polymerizing with ethylene include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, alkenylbenzenes, etc. Examples of such comonomers include C3-C20 a -olefins such as propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 3-hexene,<br><br>
1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, l-<iecene and the like. i-octene are especially preferred. other suitable monomers include styrene halo-or alkyl-substituted styrenes vinylbenzocyclobutane naphtbenics cyclopentene cyclohexene cyclooctene></iecene>
[1111        While etbylene/a-olefin interpolymers are preferred polymers, other ethylene/olefin polymers may also be used. Olefins as used herein refer to a family of unsaturated hydrocarbon-based compounds with at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Depending on the selection of catalysts, any olefin may be used in embodiments of the invention. Preferably, suitable olefins are C3-C20 aliphatic and aromatic compounds<br>
containing vinylic unsaturation, as well as cyclic compounds, such as cyclobutene, cyclopentene, dicyclopentadiene, and norbornene, including but not limited to, norbomene substituted in the 5 and 6 position with C1-C20 hydrocarbyl or cyclohydrocarbyl groups. Also included are mixtures of such olefins as well as mixtures of such olefins with C4-C40 diolefin compounds.<br>
J112]        Examples of olefin monomers include, but are not limited to propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene, 1-eicosene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 3-metbyl- 1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 4,6-dimethyl- 1-heptene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, vinylcyclobexane, norbornadiene, ethylidene norbornene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclooctene, C4-C40 dienes, including but not limited to 1 f3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1^-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, other C4-C40 a-olefins, and the like. In certain embodiments, the a-olefin is propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene or a combination thereof. Although any hydrocarbon containing a vinyl group potentially may be used in embodiments of the invention, practical issues such as monomer availability, cost, and the ability to conveniently remove unreacted monomer from the resulting polymer may become more problematic as the molecular weight of the monomer becomes too high.<br>
[113]        The polymerization processes described herein are well suited for the production of olefin polymers comprising monovinylidene aromatic monomers including styrene, o-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, t-butylstyrene, and the like. In particular, interpolymers comprising ethylene and styrene can be prepared by following the teachings<br><br>
herein. Optionally, copolymers comprising ethylene, styrene and a C3-C20 alpha olefin, optionally comprising a C4-C2O diene, having improved properties can be prepared.<br>
[114]        Suitable non-conjugated diene monomers can be a straight chain, branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbon diene having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable non-conjugated dienes include, but are not limited to, straight chain acyclic dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene, 1,6-octadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, branched chain acyclic dienes, such as 5-methyl- 1,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene and mixed isomers of dihydromyricene and dihydroocinene, single ring alicyclic dienes, such as 1,3-cyclopentadiene; 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,5-cyclododecadiene, and multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes, such as tetrahydroindene, methyl tetrahydroindene, dicyclopentadiene, bicyclo-(2,2,l)-hepta-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes, such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB); 5-propenyl-2-norbornene, 5-isopropylidene-2-norbornene, 5-(4-cyclopentenyI)-2-norbornene, 5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbomene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, and norbornadicne. Of the dienes typically used to prepare EPDMs, the particularly preferred dienes are 1,4-hexadiene (HD), 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB), 5-vinylidene-2-norbornene (VNB), 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB), and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). The especially preferred dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norbomene (ENB) and 1,4-hexadiene (HD).<br>
[115]	One class of desirable polymers that can be made in accordance with<br>
embodiments of the invention are elastomeric interpolymers of ethylene, a C3-C20 a-olefin, especially propylene, and optionally one or more diene monomers. Preferred a-olefms for use in this embodiment of the present invention are designated by the formula CH2=CHR*, where R* is a linear or branched alkyl group of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable a-olefms include, but are not limited to, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, I-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-rnethyl-l-pentene, and 1-octene. A particularly preferred a-olefm is propylene. The propylene based polymers are generally referred to in the art as EP or EPDM polymers. Suitable dienes for use in preparing such polymers, especially multi-block EPDM type polymers include conjugated or non-conjugated, straight or branched chain-, cyclic- or polycyclic- dienes comprising from 4 to 20 carbons. Preferred dienes include 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5-ethyIidene-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, and 5-butylidene-2-norbornene. A particularly preferred diene is 5-ethylidene-2-norbomene.<br><br>
1116]	Because the diene containing polymers comprise alternating segments or<br>
blocks containing greater or lesser quantities of the diene (including none) and a-olefin (including none), the total quantity of diene and a-olefin may be reduced without loss of subsequent polymer properties. That is, because the diene and a-olefin monomers are preferentially incorporated into one type of block of the polymer rather than uniformly or randomly throughout the polymer, they are more efficiently utilized and subsequently the crosslink density of the polymer can be better controlled. Such crosslinkable elastomers and the cured products have advantaged properties, including higher tensile strength and better elastic recovery.<br>
J117]	In some embodiments, the inventive interpolymers made with two catalysts<br>
incorporating differing quantities of comonomer have a weight ratio of blocks formed thereby from 95:5 to 5:95. The elastomeric polymers desirably have an ethylene content of from 20 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an a-olefin content of from 10 to 80 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Further preferably, the multi-block elastomeric polymers have an ethylene content of from 60 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0,1 to 10 percent, and an a-olefin content of from 10 to 40 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Preferred polymers are high molecular weight polymers, having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) from 10,000 to about 2,500,000, preferably from 20,000 to 500,000, more preferably from 20,000 to 350,000, and a polydispersity less than 3.5, more preferably less than 3.0, and a Mooney viscosity (ML (1+4) 125°C.) from 1 to 250. More preferably, such polymers have an ethylene content from 65 to 75 percent, a diene content from 0 to 6 percent, and an a-olefin content from 20 to 35 percent.<br>
[118]	The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers can be functionalized by incorporating at<br>
least one functional group in its polymer structure. Exemplary functional groups may include, for example, etbylenically unsaturated mono- and di-functional carboxylic acids, ethylenically unsaturated mono- and di-functional carboxylic acid anhydrides, salts thereof and esters thereof. Such functional groups may be grafted to an ethylene/ a -olefin interpolymer, or it may be copolymerized with ethylene and an optional additional comonomer to form an interpolymer of ethylene, the functional comonomer and optionally other comonomer(s). Means for grafting functional groups onto polyethylene are described for example in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,762,890, 4,927,888, and 4,950,541, the disclosures of<br><br>
these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. One particularly useful functional group is malic anhydride.<br>
[119]        The amount of the functional group present in the functional interpolymer can vary. The functional group can typically be present in a copolymer-type functionalized interpolymer in an amount of at least about 1.0 weight percent, preferably at least about 5 weight percent, and more preferably at least about 7 weight percent The functional group will typically be present in a copolymer-type functionalized interpolymer in an amount less than about 40 weight percent, preferably less than about 30 weight percent, and more preferably less than about 25 weight percent.<br>
1120]        The amount of the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer in the polymer blends disclosed herein depends upon several factors, such as the type and amount of the two polyolefins. Generally, the amount should be sufficient to be effective as a compatibilizer as decribed above. In some embodiments, it should be an a sufficient amount to effect morphology changes between the two polymers in the resulting blend. Typically the amount can be from about 0.5 to about 99 wt%, from about 5 to about 95 wt%, from about 10 to about 90 wt%, from about 20 to about 80 wt%, from about 0.5 to about 50 wt%, from about 50 to about 99 wt%, from about 5 to about 50 wt%, or from about 50 to about 95 wt% of the total weight of the polymer blend. In some embodiments, the amount of the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer in the polymer blends is from about 1% to about 30%, from about 2% to about 20%, from about 3% to about 15%, from about 4% to about 10% by weight of the total weight of the polymer blend." In some embodiments, the amount of the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer in the polymer blends is less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2% or less than about 1%, but greater than about 0.1% by weight of the total polymer blend. Polyolefins<br>
|121]        The polymer blends disclosed herein can comprise at least two polyoelftns, in addition to at least an cthylene/a-olefm interpolymer described above. A polyolefin is a polymer derived from two or more olefins (i.e., alkenes). An olefin (i.e., alkene) is a hydrocarbon contains at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The olefin can be a monoene (Le, an olefin having a single carbon-carbon double bond), diene (/.e, an olefin having two<br><br>

(129]        In other embodiments, the olefin copolymer is derived from (i) a C3.2o olefin substituted with an alkyl or aryl group (eg., 4-methyl-l-pentene and styrene) and (ii) a diene (e.g. butadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene and 1,9-decadiene).

[132|        In other embodiments, the olefin terpolymer is derived from (i) two different monoenes, and (ii) a C3.20 olefin substituted with an alkyl or aryl group. A non-limiting example of such olefin terpolymer includes styrene-ethylene-co-(butene)-styrene (SEBS) block copolymer.<br>
[133]        In other embodiments, one of the at least two polyolefins can be any vulcanizable elastomer or rubber which is derived from at least an olefin, provided that the vulcanizable elastomer can be cross-linked (Le.9 vulcanized) by a cross-linking agent. The vulcanizable elastomer and a thermoplastic such as polypropylene together can form a TPV after cross-linking. Vulcanizable elastomers, although generally thermoplastic in theuncured state, are normally classified as thermosets because they undergo an irreversible process of thermosetting to an unprocessable state. Preferably, the vulcanized elastomer is dispersed in a matrix of the thermoplastic polymer as domains. The average domain size may range from<br><br>
about 0.1 micron to about 100 micron, from about 1 micron to about 50 microns; from about 1 micron to about 25 microns; from about 1 micron to about 10 microns, or from about 1 micron to about 5 microns.<br>
[134]        Non-limiting examples of suitable vulcanizable elastomers or rubbers include ethylene/higher alpha-olefin/polyene terpolymer rubbers such as EPDM. Any such terpolyraer rubber which can be completely cured (cross-linked) with a phenolic curative or other cross-linking agent is satisfactory.  In some embodiments, the terpolymer rubbers can be essentially non-crystalline, rubbery terpolymer of two or more alpha-olefins, preferably copolymerwed with at least one polyene (ley an alkene comprises two or more carbon-carbon double bonds), usually a non-conjugated diene. Suitable terpolymer rubbers comprise the products from the polymerization of monomers comprising two olefins having only one double bond, generally ethylene and propylene, and a lesser quantity of non-conjugated diene. The amount of non-conjugated diene is usually from about 2 to about 10 weight percent of the rubber. Any terpolymer rubber which has sufficient reactivity with phenolic curative to completely cure is suitable. The reactivity of terpolymer rubber varies depending upon both the amount of unsaturation and the type of unsaturation present in the polymer. For example, terpolymer rubbers derived from ethylidene norbomene are more reactive toward phenolic curatives than terpolymer rubbers derived from dicyclopentadiene and terpolymer rubbers derived from 1,4-hexadiene are less reactive toward phenolic curatives than terpolymer rubbers derived from dicyclopentadiene. However, the differences in reactivity can be overcome by polymerizing larger quantities of less active diene into the rubber molecule. For example, 2.5 weight percent of ethylidene norbomene or dicyclopentadiene may be sufficient to impart sufficient reactivity to the terpolymer to make it completely curable with phenolic curative comprising conventional cure activators, whereas, at least 3.0 weight percent or more is required to obtain sufficient reactivity in an terpolymer rubber derived from 1,4-hexadiene. Grades of terpolymer rubbers such as EPDM rubbers suitable for embodiments of the invention are commercially available. Some of the EPDM rubbers are disclosed in Rubber World Blue Book 1975 Edition, Materials and Compounding Ingredients for Rubber, pages 406-410.<br>
[135]	Generally, an terpolymer elastomer has an ethylene content of from about 10%<br>
to about 90% by weight, a higher alpha-olefm content of about 10% to about 80% by weight, and a polyene content of about 0.5% to about 20% by weight, all weights based on the total<br><br>
weight of the polymer. The higher alpha-olefin contains from about 3 to about 14 carbon atoms. Examples of these are propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-octene, 2-ethyl-1-hexene, 1-dodecene, and the like. The polyene can be a conjugated diene such as isoprene, butadiene, chloroprene, and the like; a nonconjugated diene; a triene, or a higher enumerated polyene. Examples of trienes are 1,4,9-decatriene, 5,8-diraethyl-1,4,9-decatriene, 4,9-dimethyl-1,4,9-decatriene, and the like. The nonconjugated dienes are more preferred. The nonconjugated dienes contain from 5 to about 25 carbon atoms. Examples are nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 2,5-dimethyl-l,5-hexadiene, 1,4-octadiene, and the like; cyclic dienes such as cyclopentadtene, cyclohexadiene, cyclooctadiene, dicyclopentadiene, and the like; vinyl cyclic enes such as 1-vinyl-l-cyclopentene, 1 -vinyl-1-cyclohexene, and the like; alkylbicyclo nondienes such as 3-methyl-bicyclo (4,2,1) nona-3,7-diene, 3-ethylbicyclonondiene, and the like; indenes such as methyl tetrahydroindene and the like; alkenyl norbornenes such as 5-ethylidene-2-norbomene, 5-butylidene-2-norbornene, 2-methallyl-5-norbomene, 2-isopropenyl-5-norbornene, 5-(l,5-hexadienyl)-2-norbornene, 5-(3,7-octadieneyl)-2-norbomene, and the like; and tricyclo dienes such as 3-methyl-tricycIo-(5,2,l,02,6)-3,8-decadiene and the like.<br>
[136J        In some embodiments, the terpolymer rubbers contain from about 20% to about 80% by weight of ethylene, about 19% to about 70% by weight of a higher alpha-olefin, and about 1% to about 10% by weight of a nonconjugated diene. The more preferred higher alpha-olefins are propylene and 1-butene. The more preferred polyenes are ethylidene norbornene, 1,4-hexadiene, and dicyclopentadiene.<br>
[137|        In other embodiments, the terpolymer rubbers have an ethylene content of from about 50% to about 70% by weight, a propylene content of from about 20% to about 49% by weight, and a nonconjugated diene content from about 1% to about 10% by weight, all weights based upon the total weight of the polymer.<br>

Any lubricant known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be added to the polymer blends disclosed herein. Non-limiting examples of suitable lubricants include fatty alcohols and their dicarboxylic acid esters, fatty acid esters of short-chain alcohols, fatty acids, fatty acid amides, metal soaps, oligomeric fatty acid esters, fatty acid esters of long-chain alcohols, montan waxes, polyethylene waxes, polypropylene waxes, natural and synthetic paraffin waxes, fluoropolymers and combinations thereof. Where used, the amount of the lubricant in the polymer blend can be from about greater than 0 to about 5 wt%, from about 0.1 to about 4 wt%, or from about 0.1 to about 3 wt% of the total weight of the polymer blend. Some suitable lubricants have been disclosed in Zweifel Hans et al., "Plastics Additives Handbook" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio, 5th edition, Chapter 5, pages 511-552 (2001), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[151J        Optionally, the polymer blends disclosed herein can comprise an antistatic agent. Generally, the antistatic agent can increase the conductivity of the polymer blends and to prevent static charge accumulation. Any antistatic agent known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be added to the polymer blends disclosed herein. Non-limiting examples of suitable antistatic agents include conductive fillers (e.g., carbon black, metal particles and other conductive particles), fatty acid esters (e.g., glycerol monostearate), ethoxylated alkylamines, diethanolarnides, ethoxylated alcohols, alkyisulfonates, alkylphosphates,<br><br>
quaternary ammonium salts, alkylbetaines and combinations thereof. Where used, the amount of the antistatic agent in the polymer blend can be from about greater than 0 to about 5 wt%, from about 0.01 to about 3 wt%, or from about 0.1 to about 2 wt% of the total weight of the polymer blend. Some suitable antistatic agents have been disclosed in Zweifel Hans et a/., 'Plastics Additives Handbook," Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio, 5th edition, Chapter 10, pages 627-646 (2001), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[152]        In further embodiments, the polymer blends disclosed herein optionally comprise a cross-linking agent that can be used to increase the cross-linking density of the polymer blends. Any cross-linking agent known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be added to the polymer blends disclosed herein. Non-limiting examples of suitable cross-linking agents include organic peroxides (e.g., alkyl peroxides, aryl peroxides, peroxyesters, peroxycarbonates, diacylperoxides, peroxyketals, and cyclic peroxides) and silanes (e.g., vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltris(2-methoxyethoxy)silane, vinyltriacetoxysilane, vinylmethyldimethoxysilane, and 3-<br>
methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane). Where used, the amount of the cross-linking agent in the polymer blend can be from about greater than 0 to about 20 wt%, from about 0.1 to about 15 wt%, or from about 1 to about 10 wt% of the total weight of the polymer blend. Some suitable cross-linking agents have been disclosed in Zweifel Hans et aL9 "Plastics Additives Handbook" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio, 5th edition, Chapter 14, pages 725-812 (2001), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[153]        The cross-linking of the polymer blends can also be initiated by any radiation means known in the art, including, but not limited to, electron-beam irradiation, beta irradiation, gamma irradiation, corona irradiation, and UV radiation with or without cross-linking catalyst, U.S. Patent Application No. 10/086,057 (published as US2002/0132923 Al) and U.S. Patent No. 6,803,014 disclose electron-beam irradiation methods that can be used in embodiments of the invention. Preparation of the Polymer blends<br>
|154]        The ingredients of the polymer blends, i.e., the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, the polyolefins (i.e., the first polyolefin and the second polyolefin) and the optional additives, can be mixed or blended using methods known to a person of ordinary skill in the art, preferably methods that can provide a substantially homogeneous distribution of the<br><br>
polyolefin and/or the additives in the ethylene/a-olefin inteipolymer. Non-limiting examples of suitable blending methods include melt blending, solvent blending, extruding, and the like.<br>
[155]        In some embodiments, the ingredients of the polymer blends are melt blended by a method as described by Guerin et cd. in U.S. Patent No. 4,152,189. First, all solvents, if there are any, are removed from the ingredients by heating to an appropriate elevated temperature of about 100°C to about 200*C or about 150°C to about 175°C at a pressure of about 5 torr (667 Pa) to about 10 torr (1333 Pa). Next, the ingredients are weighed into a vessel in the desired proportions and the polymer blend is formed by heating the contents of the vessel to a molten state while stirring.<br>
[156]	In other embodiments, the ingredients of the polymer blends are processed<br>
using solvent blending. First, the ingredients of the desired polymer blend are dissolved in a suitable solvent and the mixture is then mixed or blended. Next, the solvent is removed to provide the polymer blend.<br>
1157]	In further embodiments, physical blending devices that provide dispersive<br>
mixing, distributive mixing, or a combination of dispersive and distributive mixing can be useful in preparing homogenous blends. Both batch and continuous methods of physical blending can be used. Non-limiting examples of batch methods include those methods using BRABENDER® mixing equipments (e.g., BRABENDER PREP CENTER®, available from C. W. Brabender Instruments, Inc., South Hackensack, N.J.) or BANBURY® internal mixing and roll milling (available from Farrel Company, Ansonia, Conn.) equipment. Non-limiting examples of continuous methods include single screw extruding, twin screw extruding, disk extruding, reciprocating single screw extruding, and pin barrel single screw extruding. In some embodiments, the additives can be added into an extruder through a feed hopper or feed throat during the extrusion of the ethylene/a-olefin inteipolymer, the polyolefin or the polymer blend. The mixing or blending of polymers by extrusion has been described in C. Rauwendaal, "Polymer Extrusion", Hanser Publishers, New York, NY, pages 322-334 (1986), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[158]	When one or more additives are required in the polymer blends, the desired<br>
amounts of the additives can be added in one charge or multiple charges to the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, the polyolefins or the polymer blend. Furthermore, the addition can take place in any order. In some embodiments, the additives are first added and mixed or blended with the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer and then the additive-containing interpolymer is<br><br>
blended with the polyolefins. In other embodiments, the additives are first added and mixed or blended with the polyolefins and then with the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer. In further embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is blended with the polyolefins first and then the additives are blended with the polymer blend.<br>
[159]        Alternatively, master batches containing high concentrations of the additives can be used. In general, master batches can be prepared by blending either the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, one of the polyolefins or the polymer blend with high concentrations of additives. The master batches can have additive concentrations from about 1 to about 50 wt%, from about 1 to about 40 wt%, from about 1 to about 30 wt%, or from about 1 to about 20 wt% of the total weight of the polymer blend. The master batches can then be added to the polymer blends in an amount determined to provide the desired additive concentrations in the end products. In some embodiments, the master batch contains a slip agent, an anti-blocking agent, a plasticizer, an antioxidant, a UV stabilizer, a colorant or pigment, a filler, a lubricant, an antifogging agent, a flow aid, a coupling agent, a cross-linking agent, a nucleating agent, a surfactant, a solvent, a flame retardant, an antistatic agent, or a combination thereof. In other embodiment, the master batch contains a slip agent, an anti-blocking agent or a combination thereof. In other embodiment, the master batch contains a slip agent<br>
[160]        In some embodiments, the first polyolefin and the second polyolefin together constitute a thermoplastic vulcanizate where the first polyolefin is a thermoplastic such as polypropylene and the second polyolefin is a curable vulcanizable rubber such as EPDM. The thermoplastic vulcanizates are typically prepared by blending the thermoplastic and curable vulcanizable rubber by dynamic vulcanization. The compositions can be prepared by any suitable method for mixing of rubbery polymers including mixing on a rubber mill or in internal mixers such as a Banbury mixer. In the compounding procedure, one or more additives as described above can be incorporated.   Generally, it is preferred to add the cross-linking or curing agents in a second stage of compounding which may be on a rubber mill or in an internal mixer operated at a temperature normally not in excess of about 60°C.<br>
1161J	Dynamic vulcanization is a process whereby a blend of thermoplastic, rubber<br>
and rubber curative is masticated while curing the rubber. The term "dynamic" indicates the mixture is subjected to shear forces during the vulcanization step as contrasted with "static" vulcanization wherein the vulcanizable composition is immobile (in fixed relative space) during the vulcanization step. One advantage of dynamic vulcanization is that elastoplastic<br><br>
(thermoplastic elastomeric) compositions may be obtained when the blend contains the proper proportions of plastic and rubber. Examples of dynamic vulcanization are described in U.S. Pat Nos. 3,037,954; 3,806,558; 4,104,210; 4,116,914; 4,130,535; 4,141,863; 4,141,878; 4,173,556; 437,404; 4,271,0494,287,324; 4,288,570; 4,299,931; 4,311,628 and 4,338,413, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[162]        Any mixer capable of generating a shear rate of 2000 sec'1 or higher is suitable for carrying out the process. Generally, this requires a high speed internal mixer having a narrow clearance between the tips of the kneading elements and the wall. Shear rate is the velocity gradient in the space between the tip and the wall. Depending upon the clearance between the tip and the wall, rotation of the kneading elements from about 100 to about 500 revolutions per minute (rpm) is generally adequate to develop a sufficient shear rate. Depending upon the number of tips cm a given kneading element and the rate of rotation, the number of times the composition is kneaded by each element is from about 1 to about 30 times per second, preferably from about 5 to about 30 times per second, and more preferably from about 10 to about 30 times per second. This means that material typically is kneaded from about 200 to about 1800 times during vulcanization. For example, in a typical process with a rotor with three tips rotating at about 400 rpm in a mixer having a residence time of about 30 seconds, the material is kneaded about 600 times.<br>
(163]	A mixer satisfactory for carrying out the process is a high shear mixing<br>
extruder produced by Werner &amp; Pfleiderer, Germany. The Wemer &amp; Pfleiderer (W&amp;P) extruder is a twin-shaft screw extruder in which two intermeshing screws rotate in the same directioa Details of such extruders are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,963,679 and 4,250,292; and German Pat. Nos. 2,302,546; 2,473,764 and 2,549,372, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Screw diameters vary from about 53 mm to about 300 mm; barrel lengths vary but generally the maximum barrel length is the length necessary to maintain a length over diameter ratio of about 42. The shaft screws of these extruders normally are made-up of alternating series of conveying sections and kneading sections. The conveying sections cause material to move forward from each kneading section of the extruder. Typically there are about an equal number of conveying and kneading sections fairly evenly distributed along the length of the barrel. Kneading elements containing one, two, three or four tips are suitable, however, kneading elements from about 5 to about 30 mm wide having three tips are preferred. At recommended screw speeds of from about 100 to<br><br>
about 600 rpm and radial clearance of from about 0.1 to about 0.4 mm, these mixing extruders provide shear rates of at least from about 2000 sec"1 to about 7500 sec*1 or more. The net mixing power expended in the process including homogenization and dynamic vulcanization is usually from about 100 to about 500 watt hours per kilogram of product produced; with from about 300 to about 400 watt hours per kilogram being typical.<br>
[164]        The process is illustrated by the use of W&amp;P twin screw extruders, models ZSK-53 or ZSK-83. Unless specified otherwise, all of the plastic, rubber and other compounding ingredients except the cure activator are fed into the entry port of the extruder. In the first third of the extruder, the composition is masticated to melt the plastic and to form an essentially homogeneous blend. The cure activator (vulcanization accelerator) is added through another entry port located about one-third of the length of the barrel downstream from the initial entry port. The last two-thirds of the extruder (from the cure activator entry port to the outlet of the extruder) is regarded as the dynamic vulcanization zone. A vent operated under reduced pressure is located near the outlet to remove any volatile by-products. Sometimes, additional extender oil or plasticizer and colorants are added at another entry port located about the middle of the vulcanization zone.<br>
[165]	The residence time within the vulcanization zone is the time a given quantity<br>
of material is within the aforesaid vulcanization zone. Since the extruders are typically operated under a starved condition, usually from about 60 to about 80 percent full, residence time is essentially directly proportional to feed rate. Thus, residence time in the vulcanization zone is calculated by multiplying the total volume of the dynamic vulcanization zone times the fill factor divided by the volume flow rate. Shear rate is calculated by dividing the product of the circumference of the circle generated by the screw tip times the revolutions of the screw per second by the tip clearance. In other words, shear rate is the tip velocity divided by the tip clearance.<br>
[166]	Methods other than the dynamic curing of rubber/thermoplastic polymer resin<br>
blends can be utilized to prepare compositions. For example, the rubber can be fully cured in the absence of the thermoplastic polymer resin, either dynamically or statically, powdered, and mixed with the thermoplastic polymer resin at a temperature above the melting or softening point of the resin. If the cross-linked rubber particles are small, well dispersed and in an appropriate concentration, the compositions are easily obtained by blending cross-linked rubber and thermoplastic polymer resin. It is preferred that a mixture comprising well<br><br>
dispersed small particles of cross-linked rubber is obtained. A mixture which contains poor dispersed or too large rubber particles can be comminuted by cold milling, to reduce particle size to below about 50 |i, preferably below about 20 u and more preferably to below about 5 ji. After sufficient comminution or pulverization, a TPV composition is obtained. Frequently, poor dispersion or too large rubber particles is obvious to the naked eye and observable in a molded sheet This is especially true in the absence of pigments and fillers. In such a case, pulverization and remolding gives a sheet in which aggregates of rubber particles or large particles arc not obvious or are for less obvious to the naked eye and mechanical properties are greatly improved. Applications of the Polymer blends<br>
[167]        The polymer blends disclosed herein are useful for making a variety of articles such as tires, hoses, belts, gaskets, shoe soles, moldings and molded parts.   They are particularly useful for applications that require high melt strength such as large part blow molding, foams, and wire cables. Additional applications are disclosed in the following U.S. Patent Nos. 6,329,463; 6,288,171; 6,277,916; 6,270,896; 6,221,451; 6,174,962; 6,169,145; 6,150,464; 6,147,160; 6,100,334; 6,084,031; 6,069,202; 6,066,697; 6,028,137; 6,020,427; 5,977,271; 5,960,977; 5,957,164; 5,952,425; 5,939,464; 5,936,038; 5,869,591; 5,750,625; 5,744,238; 5,621,045; and 4,783,579, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[168]	The polymer blends can be used to prepare various useful articles with known<br>
polymer processes such as extrusion (e.g., sheet extrusion and profile extrusion), injection molding, molding, rotational molding, and blow molding. In general, extrusion is a process by which a polymer is propelled continuously along a screw through regions of high temperature and pressure where it is melted and compacted, and finally forced through a die. The extruder can be a single screw extruder, a multiple screw extruder, a disk extruder or a ram extruder. The die can be a film die, blown film die, sheet die, pipe die, tubing die or profile extrusion die. The extrusion of polymers has been described in C. Rauwendaal, "Polymer Extrusion", Hanser Publishers, New York, NY (1986); and M.J. Stevens, "Extruder Principals and Operation" Ellsevier Applied Science Publishers, New York, NY (1985), both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[1691	Injection molding is also widely used for manufacturing a variety of plastic<br>
parts for various applications. In general, injection molding is a process by which a polymer<br><br>
is melted and injected at high pressure into a mold, which is the inverse of the desired shape, to form parts of the desired shape and size. The mold can be made from metal, such as steel and aluminum. The injection molding of polymers has been described in Beaumont et al., uSuccessful Injection Molding: Process, Design, and Simulation" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio (2002), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[170]        Molding is generally a process by which a polymer is melted and led into a mold, which is the inverse of the desired shape, to form parts of the desired shape and size. Molding can be pressureless or pressure-assisted. The molding of polymers is described in Hans-Georg Elias "An Introduction to Plastics" Wiley-VCH, Weinhei, Germany, pp. 161-165 (2003), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[171]        Rotational molding is a process generally used for producing hollow plastic products. By using additional post-molding operations, complex components can be produced as effectively as other molding and extrusion techniques. Rotational molding differs from other processing methods in that the heating, melting, shaping, and cooling stages all occur after the polymer is placed in the mold, therefore no external pressure is applied during forming. The rotational molding of polymers has been described in Glenn Beall, "RotationalMolding : Design, Materials &amp; Processing" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio (1998), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[172]        Blow molding can be used for making hollow plastics containers. The process includes placing a softened polymer in the center of a mold, inflating the polymer against the mold walls with a blow pin, and solidifying the product by cooling. There are three general types of blow molding: extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, and stretch blow molding. Injection blow molding can be used to process polymers that cannot be extruded. Stretch blow molding can be used for difficult to blow crystalline and crystallizable polymers such as polypropylene.  The blow molding of polymers has been described in Norman C. Lee, "Understanding Blow Molding" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio (2000), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[173] The following examples are presented to exemplify embodiments of the invention. All numerical values are approximate. When numerical ranges are given, it should be understood that embodiments outside the stated ranges may still fall within the<br><br>
scope of the invention. Specific details described in each example should not be construed as necessary features of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES Testing Methods<br>
In the examples that follow, the following analytical techniques are employed: GPC Method for Samples 1-4 and A-C<br>
f 174J        An automated liquid-handling robot equipped with a heated needle set to 160°C is used to add enough 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene stabilized with 300 ppmlonol to each dried polymer sample to give a final concentration of 30 mg/mL. A small glass stir rod is placed into each tube and the samples are heated to 160°C for 2 hours on a heated, orbital-shaker rotating at 250 rpm. The concentrated polymer solution is then diluted to 1 mg/ml using the automated liquid-handling robot and the heated needle set to 160°C.<br>
[175]        A Symyx Rapid GPC system is used to determine the molecular weight data for each sample. A Gilson 350 pump set at 2.0 ml/min flow rate is used to pump helium-purged 1,2-dichlorobenzene stabilized with 300 ppm Ionol as the mobile phase through three Plgel 10 micrometer (um) Mixed B 300mm x 7.5mm columns placed in series and heated to 160°C. A Polymer Labs ELS 1000 Detector is used with the Evaporator set to 250°C, the Nebulizer set to 165°C, and the nitrogen flow rate set to 1.8 SLM at a pressure of 60-80 psi (400-600 kPa) N2- The polymer samples are heated to 160DC and each sample injected into a 250 ul loop using the liquid-handling robot and a heated needle. Serial analysis of the polymer samples using two switched loops and overlapping injections are used. The sample data is collected and analyzed using Symyx Epoch™ software. Peaks are manually integrated and the molecular weight information reported uncorrected against a polystyrene standard calibration curve. Standard CRYSTAF Method<br>
[176J        Branching distributions are determined by crystallization analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF) using a CRYSTAF 200 unit commercially available from PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain. The samples are dissolved in 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene at 160°C (0.66 mg/mL) for I hr and stabilized at 95°C for 45 minutes. The sampling temperatures range from 95 to 30°C at a cooling rate of 0.2°C/min. An infrared detector is used to measure the polymer solution concentrations. The cumulative soluble concentration is measured as<br><br>
the polymer crystallizes while the temperature is decreased. The analytical derivative of the cumulative profile reflects the short chain branching distribution of the polymer.<br>
[177]        The CRYSTAF peak temperature and area are identified by the peak analysis module included in the CRYSTAF Software (Version 2001 .b, PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain). The CRYSTAF peak finding routine identifies a peak temperature as a maximum in the dW/dT curve and the area between the largest positive inflections on either side of the identified peak in the derivative curve. To calculate the CRYSTAF curve, the preferred processing parameters are with a temperature limit of 70°C and with smoothing parameters above the temperature limit of 0.1, and below the temperature limit of 0.3. DSC Standard Method (Excluding Samples 1-4 and A-C)<br>
[178]        Differential Scanning Calorimetry results are determined using a TAI model Q1000 DSC equipped with an RCS cooling accessory and an autosampler. A nitrogen purge gas flow of 50 mi/min is used. The sample is pressed into a thin film and melted in the press at about 175°C and then air-cooled to room temperature (25°C). 3-10 mg of material is then cut into a 6 mm diameter disk, accurately weighed, placed in a light aluminum pan (ca 50 mg), and then crimped shut. The thermal behavior of the sample is investigated with the following temperature profile. The sample is rapidly heated to 180°C and held isothermal for 3 minutes in order to remove any previous thermal history. The sample is then cooled to -40°C at 10°C/min cooling rate and held at -40°C for 3 minutes. The sample is then heated to 150 °C at 10°C/min. heating rate. The cooling and second heating curves are recorded.<br>
[179]        The DSC melting peak is measured as the maximum in heat flow rate (W/g) with respect to the linear baseline drawn between -30°C and end of melting. The heat of fusion is measured as the area under the melting curve between -30°C and the end of melting using a linear baseline. GPC Method (Excluding Samples 1-4 and A-C)<br>
[1801	Tte 8C1 permeation chromatographic system consists of either a Polymer<br>
Laboratories Model PL-210 or a Polymer Laboratories Model PL-220 instrument. The column and carousel compartments are operated at 140 °C. Three Polymer Laboratories 10-micron Mixed-B columns are used. The solvent is 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene. The samples are prepared at a concentration of 0.1 grams of polymer in 50 milliliters of solvent containing 200 ppm of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Samples are prepared by agitating lightly for 2<br><br>
hours at 160°C. The injection volume used is 100 microliters and the flow rate is 1.0 ml/minute.<br>
[181]        Calibration of the GPC column set is performed with 21 narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards with molecular weights ranging from 580 to 8,400,000, arranged in 6 "cocktail" mixtures with at least a decade of separation between individual molecular weights. The standards are purchased from Polymer Laboratories (Shropshire, UK). The polystyrene standards are prepared at 0.025 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights equal to or greater than 1,000,000, and 0.05 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights less than 1,000,000. The polystyrene standards are dissolved at 80°C with gentle agitation for 30 minutes. The narrow standards mixtures are run first and in order of decreasing highest molecular weight component to minimize degradation. The polystyrene standard peak molecular weights are converted to polyethylene molecular weights using the following equation (as described in Williams and Ward, L Polvm. ScL Polvm. Let., 6, 621 (1968)): M^y^i™ = 0.43 UMpoiystyrcne).<br>

Optical properties<br>
[186]        Films of 0.4 mm thickness are compression molded using a hot press (Carver Model #4095-4PR1001R). The pellets are placed between polytetrafluoroethylene sheets, heated at 190 °C at 55 psi (380 kPa) for 3 min, followed by 1.3 MPa for 3 min, and then 2.6 MPa for 3 min. The film is then cooled in the press with running cold water at 1.3 MPa for 1 min. The compression molded films are used for optical measurements, tensile behavior, recovery, and stress relaxation.<br>

Cyclic experiments at 300% and 80°C are conducted using an environmental chamber. In the 80 °C experiment, the sample is allowed to equilibrate for 45 minutes at the test temperature before testing. In the 21 °C, 300% strain cyclic experiment, the retractive stress at 150% strain from the first unloading cycle is recorded.

76 mm x 25 mm x 0.4 mm. After equilibrating at 37°C for 45 min in the environmental chamber, the sample was stretched to 50% strain at 333% min*1. Stress was recorded as a function of time for 12 hours. The percent stress relaxation after 12 hours was calculated using the formula: <br>
where Lo is the load at 50% strain at 0 time and L(2 is the load at 50 percent strain after 12 hours.<br>
1194]        Tensile notched tear experiments are carried out on samples having a density of 0.88 g/cc or less using an Instron™ instrument The geometry consists of a gauge section of 76 mm x 13 mm x 0.4 mm with a 2 mm notch cut into the sample at half the specimen length. The sample is stretched at 508 mm min"1 at 21 °C until it breaks. The tear energy is calculated as the area under the stress-elongation curve up to strain at maximum load. An average of at least 3 specimens are reported. TMA<br>
(195]        Thermal Mechanical Analysis (Penetration Temperature) is conducted on 30mm diameter x 3.3 mm thick, compression molded discs, formed at 180°C and 10 MPa molding pressure for 5 minutes and then air quenched. The instrument used is a TMA 7, brand available from Perkin-Elmer. In the test, a probe with 1.5 mm radius tip (P/N N519-0416) is applied to the surface of the sample disc with IN force. The temperature is raised at 5°C/min from 25°C. The probe penetration distance is measured as a function of temperature. The experiment ends when the probe has penetrated 1 mm into the sample. DMA<br>
[196]        Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is measured on compression molded disks formed in a hot press at 180°C at 10 MPa pressure for 5 minutes and then water cooled in the press at 90°C / min. Testing is conducted using an ARES controlled strain rheometer (TA instruments) equipped with dual cantilever fixtures for torsion testing.<br>
1197]        A 1.5mm plaque is pressed and cut in a bar of dimensions 32x12mm. The sample is clamped at both ends between fixtures separated by 10mm (grip separation AL) and subjected to successive temperature steps from -100°C to 200°C (5°C per step). At each temperature the torsion modulus G' is measured at an angular frequency of 10 rad/s, the<br><br>
strain amplitude being maintained between 0.1 percent and 4 percent to ensure that the torque is sufficient and that the measurement remains in the linear regime.<br>
[198]        An initial static force of 10 g is maintained (auto-tension mode) to prevent slack in the sample when thermal expansion occurs. As a consequence, the grip separation AL increases with the temperature, particularly above the melting or softening point of the polymer sample. The test stops at the maximum temperature or when the gap between the fixtures reaches 65 mm. Melt Index<br>
|199]        Melt index, or h, is measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190°C/2.16 kg. Melt index, or IJ0 is also measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190°C/10 kg. ATREF<br>
[2001        Analytical temperature rising elution fractionation (ATREF) analysis is conducted according to the method described in USP 4,798,081 and Wilde, L.; Ryle, T.R.; Knobeloch, D.C.; Peat, I.R.; Determination of Branching Distributions in Polyethylene and Ethylene Copolymers, J. Polym. Sci., 20, 441-455 (1982), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The composition to be analyzed is dissolved in trichlorobenzene and allowed to crystallize in a column containing an inert support (stainless steel shot) by slowly reducing the temperature to 20°C at a cooling rate of 0.1°C/min. The column is equipped with an infrared detector. An ATREF chrornatogram curve is then generated by eluting the crystallized polymer sample from the column by slowly increasing the temperature of the eluting solvent (trichlorobenzene) from 20 to 120°C at a rate of 1.5°C/min. ,3CNMR Analysis<br>
[201]        Tlie samples are prepared by adding approximately 3g of a 50/50 mixture of tetrachloroethane-d2/orthodichlorobenzene to 0.4 g sample in a 10 mm NMR tube. The samples are dissolved and homogenized by heating the tube and its contents to 150°C. The data are collected using a JEOL Eclipse™ 400MHz spectrometer or a Varian Unity Plus™ 400MHz spectrometer, corresponding to a nC resonance frequency of 100.5 MHz. The data are acquired using 4000 transients per data file with a 6 second pulse repetition delay. To achieve minimum signal-to-noise for quantitative analysis, multiple data files are added together. The spectral width is 25,000 Hz with a minimum file size of 32K data points. The<br><br>
samples arc analyzed at 130 °C in a 10 mm broad band probe. The comonomer incorporation is determined using Randall's triad method (Randall, J.C.; JMS-Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys., C29,201-317 (1989), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Polymer Fractionation by TREF<br>
1202]        Large-scale TREF fractionation is carried by dissolving 15-20 g of polymer in 2 liters of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB)by stirring for 4 hours at 160°C. The polymer solution is forced by 15 psig (100 kPa) nitrogen onto a 3 inch by 4 foot (7.6 cm x 12 cm) steel column packed with a 60:40 (v:v) mix of 30-40 mesh (600-425 urn) spherical, technical quality glass beads (available from Potters Industries, HC 30 Box 20, Brownwood, TX, 76801) and stainless steel, 0.028" (0.7mm) diameter cut wire shot (available from Pellets, Inc. 63 Industrial Drive, North Tonawanda, NY, 14120). The column is immersed in a thermally controlled oil jacket, set initially to 160 °C. The column is first cooled ballistically to 125 °C, then slow cooled to 20 °C at 0.04 °C per minute and held for one hour. Fresh TCB is introduced at about 65 mi/min while the temperature is increased at 0.167 °C per minute.<br>
1203]	Approximately 2000 ml portions of eluant from the preparative TREF column<br>
are collected in a 16 station, heated fraction collector. The polymer is concentrated in each fraction using a rotary evaporator until about 50 to 100 ml of the polymer solution remains. The concentrated solutions are allowed to stand overnight before adding excess methanol, filtering, and rinsing (approx. 300-500 ml of methanol including the final rinse). The filtration step is performed on a 3 position vacuum assisted filtering station using 5.0 urn polytetrafluoroethylene coated filter paper (available from Osrnonics Inc., Cat# Z50WP04750). The filtrated fractions are dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C and weighed on an analytical balance before further testing. Melt Strength<br>
1204]        Melt Strength (MS) is measured by using a capillary rheometer fitted with a 2.1 mm diameter, 20:1 die with an entrance angle of approximately 45 degrees. After equilibrating the samples at 190°C for 10 minutes, the piston is run at a speed of 1 inch/minute (2.54 cm/minute). The standard test temperature is I90°C. The sample is drawn uniaxially to a set of accelerating nips located 100 mm below the die with an acceleration of 2.4 mm/sec2. The required tensile force is recorded as a function of the take-up speed of the nip rolls. The maximum tensile force attained during the test is<br><br>
defined as the melt strength. In the case of polymer melt exhibiting draw resonance, the tensile force before the onset of draw resonance was taken as melt strength. The melt strength is recorded in centiNewtons ("cN"). Catalysts<br>

General High Throughput Parallel Polymerization Conditions<br>
[214]        Polymerizations are conducted using a high throughput, parallel polymerization reactor (PPR) available from Symyx technologies, Inc. and operated substantially according toUSP's 6,248,540, 6,030,917,6,362,309,6,306,658, and 6,316,663. Ethylene copolymerizations are conducted at 130°C and 200 psi (1.4 MPa) with ethylene on demand using 1.2 equivalents of cocatalyst 1 based on total catalyst used (1.1 equivalents when MMAO is present). A series of polymerizations are conducted in a parallel pressure reactor (PPR) contained of 48 individual reactor cells in a 6 x 8 array that are fitted with a pre-weighed glass tube. The working volume in each reactor cell is 6000 pL. Each cell is temperature and pressure controlled with stirring provided by individual stirring paddles. The monomer gas and quench gas are plumbed directly into the PPR unit and controlled by automatic valves. Liquid reagents are robotically added to each reactor cell by syringes and the reservoir solvent is mixed alkanes. The order of addition is mixed alkanes solvent (4 ml), ethylene, l-octene comonomer (1 ml), cocatalyst 1 or cocatalyst 1/MMAO mixture, shuttling agent, and catalyst or catalyst mixture. When a mixture of cocatalyst 1 and MMAO or a mixture of two catalysts is used, the reagents are premixed in a small vial immediately prior to addition to the reactor. When a reagent is omitted in an experiment, the above order of addition is otherwise maintained. Polymerizations are conducted for approximately 1-2 minutes, until predetermined ethylene consumptions are reached. After quenching with CO, the reactors are cooled and the glass tubes are unloaded. The tubes are transferred to a centrifuge/vacuum drying unit, and dried for 12 hours at 60 °C. The tubes containing dried polymer are weighed and the difference between this weight and the tare weight gives the net yield of polymer. Results are contained in Table 1. In Table 1 and elsewhere in the application, comparative compounds are indicated by an asterisk (*).<br>
[215]        Examples 1-4 demonstrate the synthesis of linear block copolymers by the present invention as evidenced by the formation of a very narrow MWD, essentially monomodal copolymer when DEZ is present and a bimodal, broad molecular weight distribution product (a mixture of separately produced polymers) in the absence of DEZ. Due to the fact that Catalyst (Al) is known to incorporate more octene than Catalyst (Bl), the different blocks or segments of the resulting copolymers of the invention are distinguishable based on branching or density.<br><br>

[217J        Further characterizing data for the polymers of Table 1 are determined by reference to the figures. More specifically DSC and ATREF results show the following:<br>
[218]        The DSC curve for the polymer of example 1 shows a 115.7°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 158.1 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 34.5°C with a peak area of 52.9 percent. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 81.2°C.<br>
[219]        The DSC curve for the polymer of example 2 shows a peak with a 109.7°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 214.0 J/g.

|221]        The DSC curve for the polymer of example 4 shows a peak with a 104.5°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 170.7 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 30 °C with a peak area of 18.2 percent. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 74.5°C.<br>
|222]        The DSC curve for Comparative Example A* shows a 90.0°C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 86.7 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest<br><br>
peak at 48.5°C with a peak area of 29.4 percent Both of these values are consistent with a resin that is low in density. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 41.8°C.<br>
[223]	The DSC curve for Comparative Example B* shows a 129.8°C melting point<br>
(Tm) with a heat of fusion of 237.0 J/g. The coiresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 82.4°C with a peak area of 83.7 percent. Both of these values are consistent with a resin that is high in density. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 47.4°C.<br>

Examples 5-19. Comparative Examples D*-F*. Continuous Solution Polymerization. Catalyst A1/B2 + DEZ<br>
[225]	Continuous solution polymerizations are carried out in a computer controlled<br>
autoclave reactor equipped with an internal stirrer. Purified mixed alkanes solvent (Isopar™ E available from ExxonMobil Chemical Company), ethylene at 2.70 lbs/hour (1.22 kg/hour), 1-octene, and hydrogen (where used) are supplied to a 3.8 L reactor equipped with a jacket for temperature control and an internal thermocouple. The solvent feed to the reactor is measured by a mass-flow controller. A variable speed diaphragm pump controls the solvent flow rate and pressure to the reactor. At the discharge of the pump, a side stream is taken to provide flush flows for the catalyst and cocatalyst 1 injection lines and the reactor agitator. These flows are measured by Micro-Motion mass flow meters and controlled by control valves or by the manual adjustment of needle valves. The remaining solvent is combined with 1-octene, ethylene, and hydrogen (where used) and fed to the reactor. A mass flow controller is used to deliver hydrogen to the reactor as needed. The temperature of the solvent/monomer solution is controlled by use of a heat exchanger before entering the reactor. This stream enters the bottom of the reactor. The catalyst component solutions are metered using pumps and mass flow meters and are combined with the catalyst flush solvent and introduced into the bottom of the reactor. The reactor is run liquid-full at 500 psig (3.45 MPa) with vigorous stirring. Product is removed through exit lines at the top of the reactor.<br><br>
All exit lines from the reactor are steam traced and insulated. Polymerization is stopped by the addition of a small amount of water into the exit line along with any stabilizers or other additives and passing the mixture through a static mixer. The product stream is then heated by passing through a heat exchanger before devolatilization. The polymer product is recovered by extrusion using a devolatilizing extruder and water cooled pelletizer. Process details and results are contained in Table 2.

The delta between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 7.3°C.<br>
[243]	The DSC curve for the polymer of Comparative Example E* shows a peak<br>
with a 124.0 °C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 179.3 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 79.3°C with a peak area of 94.6 percent Both of these values are consistent with a resin that is high in density. The delta between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 44.6°C.<br>
[244J        The DSC curve for the polymer of Comparative Example F* shows a peak with a 124.8 °C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 90.4 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 77.6°C with a peak area of 19.5 percent The separation between the two peaks is consistent with the presence of both a high crystalline and a low crystalline polymer. The delta between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 47.2°C. Physical Property Testing<br>
[245]        Polymer samples are evaluated for physical properties such as high temperature resistance properties, as evidenced by TMA temperature testing, pellet blocking strength, high temperature recovery, high temperature compression set and storage modulus ratio, G,(25°C)/G,(100°C). Several commercially available polymers are included in the tests: Comparative Example G* is a substantially linear ethylene/1-octene copolymer (AFFINITY®, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative Example H* is an clastomeric, substantially linear ethylene/1-octene copolymer (AFFINITY®EG8100, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative Example I* is a substantially linear ethylene/1-octene copolymer (AFFINITY®PL 1840, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative Example J* is a hydrogenatcd styrene/butadiene/styrene triblock copolymer (KRATON™ G1652, available from KRATON Polymers), Comparative Example K* is a thermoplastic Yulcanizate (TPV, a poly olefin blend containing dispersed therein a crosslinked elastomer). Results are presented in Table 4.<br><br><br>
[246]        In Table 4, Comparative Example F* (which is a physical blend of the two polymers resulting from simultaneous polymerizations using catalyst AI and Bl) has a I mm penetration temperature of about 70°C, while Examples 5-9 have a 1 mm penetration temperature of 100°C or greater. Further, examples 10-19 all have a 1 mm penetration temperature of greater than 85°C, with most having 1 mm TMA temperature of greater than 90°C or even greater than 100°C. This shows that the novel polymers have better dimensional stability at higher temperatures compared to a physical blend. Comparative Example J* (a commercial SEBS) has a good 1 mm TMA temperature of about 107°C, but it has very poor (high temperature 70°C) compression set of about 100 percent and it also failed to recover (sample broke) during a high temperature (80°C) 300 percent strain recovery. Thus the exemplified polymers have a unique combination of properties unavailable even in some commercially available, high performance thermoplastic elastomers.<br>
