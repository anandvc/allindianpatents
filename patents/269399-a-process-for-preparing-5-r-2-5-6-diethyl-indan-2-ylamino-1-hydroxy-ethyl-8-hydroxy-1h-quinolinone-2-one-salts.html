				<td>The present invention provides a process for preparing 5-{a-haJoacetyl)-8-benzyioxy-{iH)- quinolin-2-ones such as 5-(a-chloroacetyl)-8-benzyloxy-(lH)-quinolin-2-one, which are useful intermediates from which to prepare 5-((R)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indan-2-ylam)no}-l- hydroxy-ethyl]-8-hydroxy-(3H)-quinolinone-2-one salts.<br>
5-[(R)-2-(S,6-Diethyl-indan-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyl}-8-hydroxy-(lH)-quinolinone-2-one salts are p-selective adrenoceptor agonists with potent bronchodilator activity. For example, 5-[(R)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indan-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-cthyl]-8-hydroxy-(lW)-quinolinone-2-oBe maleate is especially useful for treating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, the maleate salt has been shown to have a very long duration of action in vitro and in vivo.<br>
In a first aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing 5-(a-haloacety!)-8- substituted oxy-(lH)-quinoIin-2-ones comprising:<br>
(a)	reacting<br>

agent in the presence of a solvent to form a 5-(a-haloacetyl)-8-substitured oxy-{lH}- quinolin-2-Dne.<br>
This process provides the 5-(a-chloroacetyl)-8-ben2yloxy-(IH)-quinolin-2-one in high selectivity and yield, and minimizes or eliminates the formation of regioisomers, such as 7-acetyl-8-benzyloxy-( 1 H)-quinoUn-2-one-( IH).<br>
