				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention refers to a machine tool, employed in particular in order to machine a conical surface.<br>
When manufacturing the engines in particular of automobiles, it is necessary to manufacture certain parts, such as the seatings of valves, with great precision.<br>
To this end, use has been made for many years of tools which have their cutting edges orientated along the angle of the conical surface to be machined. Though it is possible to braze these cutters onto a tool body, then use is made most often of detachable machining cutters designed to be mounted onto a machine tool body in order that it should be possible to change these cutters rapidly when they are worn.<br>
This also enables the machine tool body to be re-used.<br>
The mounting of these cutters must be rigorous in order to enable correct manufacturing of the valve seating. Indeed, accurate positioning of the cutting edge is essential in order to obtain a good seal, and correct exhausting of the gases.<br>
For the manufacturing these valve seatings, the cutter necessarily includes a cutting edge which is placed on a precise angular orientation in relation to the longitudinal axis of rotation of the tool.<br>
To be more precise, a valve seating consists of three successive faces which are orientated differently.<br>
It is therefore necessary to achieve correct angular positioning of the cutter in order to shape these faces. Radial positioning must also be achieved with precision.<br>
It is known to use cutters which have several edges, allowing the cutter to be pivoted whenever an edge is worn.<br>
2<br><br>
There are also different types of mounting in which the machining cutters are held.<br>
Thus, it is known (US-A-2004009046) to use a pressure element attached to the top of the cutter with a screw for retention of the pressure element which applies said pressure element with a certain force.<br>
The tightening force of this screw is therefore not applied directly to the cutter. The cutter partly rests in a stamping presented by the tool.<br>
This hexagonal cutter thus bears onto a flat surface of the tool and in contact with three lateral bearing faces manufactured into the body of the tool. Two bearing faces form an angle whose bisecting line is perpendicular to the cutting edge.<br>
No force, other than that of the reaction to the cutting force, holds the manufacturing cutter onto the bearing faces, and only the pressure of the clamp holds the cutter in position.<br>
The working precision of this tool is therefore inadequate.<br>
This type of tool, designed to use a single type of cutter, is therefore available from one single supplier only.<br>
Moreover, if one of the lateral bearing faces of the stamping is damaged, the tool is no longer usable.<br>
The invention proposes to provide a solution to the particular afore mentionned problems.<br>
To this end, an object of the invention is a machine tool designed to be fitted with a cutter which is retained by a central screw, this tool being characterized in that it includes a plate which is removable in relation to the body of the tool, this plate having a cut-out for the positioning of a machining cutter, where this cut-out consists of two lateral<br>
3<br><br>
faces, known as reference faces, and a third face which bears elastically against said manufacturing cutter.<br>
The invention will be properly understood with the aid of the following description, provided as an example that is not limited to what is shown in the drawings, which illustrate the following:<br>
FIG 1: different views of a machine tool with one cutter<br>
FIG 2: different views of a machine tool with two cutters<br>
FIG 3: different views of a machine tool with one cutter and the means to adjust it<br>
FIG 4: different views of a machine tool with two cutters and the means to adjust them.<br>
FIG 5: different views of details of the machine tool.<br>
Referring to the drawings, we see a machine tool (1) designed in particular to machine the seatings of valves.<br>
This tool has a tool body (2) on which is mounted, at its extremity, at least one machining cutter (3).<br>
This machining cutter is of the type with four faces, with a central hole for a retaining screw (24).<br>
The tool body therefore includes a tapped hole for the retaining screw.<br>
The tool body is designed to be held in a retaining chuck which is capable of rotating, or which is driven in rotation by a means which is appropriate to a machine tool.<br>
4<br><br>
In particular, the tool is designed to machine the seatings of valves, and it therefore works with a cutting edge (3A) that is inclined in relation to the longitudinal axis of the tool so as to machine a conical zone.<br>
According to one characteristic, the tool includes a plate (4) which is removable in relation to the body of the tool, where this plate presents a cut-out (5) for the positioning of a machining cutter with a central hole, this cut-out having two lateral faces (5A, 5B), known as reference faces, and a third face (5C) which bears elastically against said machining cutter.<br>
This pressure face (5C) will therefore apply the cutter onto one of the reference faces.<br>
As an example, figure 5 shows a u-shaped cut-out with positioning faces at right angles, but the positioning faces can be orientated differently depending on the shape of the cutter and the pressure face.<br>
This mounted plate (4) extends into a first zone (4A) along the longitudinal axis of the tool body and into a second zone (4B) which is approximately along the angle of attack of the cutting edge. It is in this second zone that the cut-out (5) is located. The cutter is therefore driven on two faces and held elastically against a third face.<br>
The elastic pressure face is located toward the extremity of the tool.<br>
It can be seen that the positioning and pressure faces are bevelled from the upper face (20) and for part of the height.<br>
The elastic pressure is obtained by local reduction of the material of the plate at the level of the branch of the cut-out (5) holding the pressure face.<br>
5<br><br>
The tool also has a reception plane (6) for the base of this plate and for the cutter. It is in this reception face that the tapped bore designed to be fitted with the retaining screw of the cutter is located.<br>
In order to accommodate this plate, a groove (7) is created in the body, designed to take at least one part of the plate and to hold it in position.<br>
This groove is delimited by the plane (6) receiving the cutter, a second face (17) overhanging this reception face, and a third face (8) at the bottom of the groove.<br>
The bottom (8) of the groove can serve directly as the positioning end-stop for the plate.<br>
A longitudinal end-stop (9) also serves for longitudinal positioning of the plate. As an example, this end-stop (9) is effected by a rod (10) partially passing through the body of the tool. In order to keep the plate applied onto the reception plane, the means of its retention (11) are provided, mounted on the part of the tool body which overhangs the reception plane and presenting one of the faces of the groove.<br>
As an example, these means of retention comprise cylinders (11A) with a flat, each displaced by a screw, the axis of movement being inclined in relation to the plane containing the plate.<br>
Tightening is achieved by moving the cylinder toward the bottom of the groove by means of a screw . A very effective securing of the plate, is then obtained, hence in an excellent quality of cut. This rigid mounting enables the quality of cut to be improved.<br>
With this method, the body of the tool is simple to manufacture, as are the plates (4). The plate(4) can advantageously be made from harder material than that of the body of the tool.<br>
6<br><br>
By choosing the orientation of the cut-out, one can easily change the cutting angle.<br>
Channels (13) extend through the body of the tool in order to spray cutting liquid for cooling of the cutter and of the machined part.<br>
This tool can consist of several plates positioned angularly around its axis of rotation, where each plate can have a different angular orientation and different axial positioning in order to machine several conical surfaces at the same time.<br>
As an alternative, the tool includes adjustment means employed to limit the positioning of the plate and therefore of the cutter.<br>
As an example, the so-called longitudal end-stop (9) can be displaced slightly moved by means of an adjustment screw.<br>
Instead of it being the bottom of the groove that directly constitutes a radial positioning face for the plate, a mobile angular end-stop (14) enables the plate to be pivoted slightly, and therefore the cutter.<br>
For example, this angular end-stop (14) is composed of a conical face held by a screw which engages perpendicularly with the reception plane of the plate.<br>
This arrangement can be adopted both for the longitudinal end-stop and the angular end-stop.<br>
Advantageously, the conical face of the angular or longitudinal end-stop bears onto a field of the plate which is inclined in relation to the plane containing either of the upper and lower faces of said plate so that the contact is linear and not intermittent.<br>
The angle of inclination of the field of the plate (4) with relation to the plane containing the upper face will therefore depend on the choice of the angle of the conical part<br>
of the end-stop.<br>
7<br><br>
It is also possible to orientate the means adjusting so that the faces of the plate, onto which the adjustment end-stops bear are perpendicular to the plane of the upper face of the plate.<br>
It is then merely necessary to orientate the movement axis of the adjusting screw in an appropriate manner. It is also necessary that the contact should be linear.<br>
This results in a very compact tool.<br>
The tool can consist of one or more cutters positioned angularly so at to be able to machine several conical faces at the same time.<br>
8<br><br>
