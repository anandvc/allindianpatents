AND MIXTURES THEREOF<br>

The present invention discloses methods of making a mixture of theaflavin, theafiavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, pharmaceutical compositions of the above mixture of theaflavins, diet supplement compositions of the above mixture of theaflavins and methods for using the above mixtures of theaflavin and pharmaceutical compositions thereof to treat or prevent various diseases. The present invention also discloses methods of making theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin 3,3'-digallate, each as a separate compound, pharmaceutical compositions of the above compounds, diet supplement compositions of the above compounds and methods for using the above compounds to treat or prevent various diseases.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Tea, which is the most widely consumed beverage in the world other than water, is produced from the leaves of Camellia Sinensis and contain significant amounts of flavanoid compounds. Theaflavins, which comprise a mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, as depicted in Figure 1, are typically formed via polymerization of green tea polyphenols (i.e., flavanoids) during fermentation of green tea to black tea. Typically, the concentration of theaflavins in black tea is between about 0.4% to about 1.8% by weight with the concentration of theaflavins in green tea usually being far less.<br>
Theaflavins are responsible for the characteristic color (i.e., brightness) and flavor (i.e., briskness) of black tea. Flavanoids are effective anti-oxidants (Leung et al.,JNutr 2001,131(9):2248-51; Sarkar et al, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2001, 284(l):173-8; Yoshino et al.,Biol. Pharm Bull. 1994, 17(1) 146-149) and may be efficacious against various diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, etc. Further, flavanoids may possess significant anti-inflammatory antimicrobial and antiviral activity.<br>
However, a significant problem in using theaflavins to treat or prevent various diseases is isolating theaflavins, either as a mixture or as individual compounds, in sufficient quantities, from naturally occurring sources using an economical procedure. Thus, what is needed are methods for isolating theaflavins, either as a mixture or as individual compounds, in sufficient quantities in a cost effective manner so that theaflavins, either as a mixture or as individual compounds, may be used to treat or prevent various diseases.<br>

Method of Making Theaflavin Mixtures and Individual Theaflavins<br>
hi one aspect, the current invention provides a method of making a mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate. First, green tea leaves, are contacted with an aqueous buffer to form a reaction mixture. Green tea leaves may be purchased from commercial sources (e.g., Far Tea Leaves, Berkeley, CA; SOTA Instant Japanese Green Tea, Reno, Nevada; FML Tea Trading Co., Ltd., Xiamen, China) and may be used as provided by the supplier or maybe shredded prior to contacting with buffer.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous buffer has a pH of between about 5.0 and about 7.0 (more preferably, between about 6.3 and about 6.5). The molar amount of buffer should be enough to buffer the aqueous solution and may be readily approximated by the skilled artisan, hi one embodiment, the buffer is between about 0.1 M and about 0.3 M. The buffer may be selected from any buffering agent which can be adjusted to the desired pH of the reaction mixture. Methods for selecting an appropriate buffering agent are well know to the skilled artisan. Preferred buffers include phosphate. In one embodiment, the buffering agent is 0.15 M phosphate at pH 6.4. hi another embodiment, the ratio of green tea leaves to aqueous buffer is between about 1:0.5 and about 1:20 on a kilogram to liter basis.<br>
In some cases, the green tea leaves may contain enough residual polyphenol oxidase to convert catechins to theaflavins. In other situations, polyphenol oxidase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ) may be added to the reaction mixture to assist in<br>
formation of theaflavins from catechins. Typically, the ratio of polyphenol oxidase to green tea leaves may vary between about 0.1:1 and about 2:1 (w/w).<br>
The reaction mixture is then contacted with oxygen to initiate fermentation. Typically the reaction is agitated and preferably, is stirred. The amount of oxygen in the reaction mixture may vary between about 20% and about 25% (w/v). The appropriate oxygen flow rate through the reaction mixture will vary with the reaction volume and may be readily determined by the skilled artisan. In one embodiment, the amount of oxygen in the reaction mixture is about 22% (w/v). The temperature of the reaction mixture may vary between about 15 °C and about 80 °C. In one embodiment, the temperature is about 30 °C. In another embodiment, the amount of oxygen in the reaction mixture is about 22% (w/v), the flow rate of oxygen through the reaction mixture is about 20 L/sec, the volume of the reaction mixture is between about 1000 L and about 1200 L, the temperature is about 30 °C and the reaction mixture is stirred.<br>
The reaction mixture is then fermented to form the mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate. Typically, the reaction mixture is fermented between about 0.5 hours and about 1.5 hours. In one embodiment, the reaction mixture is fermented for about 1 hour. It should be noted that the temperature and oxygen concentration of the reaction mixture remain roughly constant during fermentation. Preferably, the reaction mixture is agitated during fermentation, more preferably, the reaction mixture is stirred during fermentation.<br>
Finally, the reaction mixture is separated from the mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate. Preferably, any solids in the reaction mixture are removed. The reaction mixture may be filtered to remove solids. More preferably, the reaction mixture is centrifuged to remove solids. Even more preferably, the reaction mixture is both centrifuged and filtered to remove solids.<br>
The filtered reaction mixture is then contacted with organic solvent, which terminates fermentation. The organic solvent should dissolve appreciable quantities of theaflavins (i.e., theaflavins should be more than sparingly soluble in the selected solvent) and be at least partially immiscible with aqueous solutions (i.e., the aqueous phase and the organic phase should form two phases after mixing). The organic solvent may be selected without undue experimentation by those of skill in the art given the above criteria. In a preferred embodiment, the organic solvent is ethyl acetate. It should be noted that mixtures<br>
of organic solvents can be used in the extractive method, provided the solvent mixture satisfies the above criteria.<br>
Calculating the volume of organic solvent needed for extraction of theaflavins from aqueous solution are well within the capability of the skilled artisan. Preferably, the volume of organic solvent used to extract theaflavins from aqueous solution is between about 1/3 of the volume of the aqueous solution and about three times the volume of the aqueous solution. More preferably, the volume of organic solvent used to extract theaflavins from aqueous solution is about equal to the volume of the aqueous solution.<br>
The aqueous solution may be contacted with as many portions of organic solvent necessary to extract substantially all of the theaflavins into the organic phase. The number of portions of organic solvent necessary to completely extract theaflavins from aqueous solution may be readily determined by one of skill in the art without undue experimentation.<br>
Generally, contacting organic solvent and aqueous solution in a separatory funnel is sufficient to extract theaflavins into organic solvent from aqueous solution. However, in some situations, the organic solvent and aqueous solution may be contacted by other methods well known to the skilled artisan such as magnetic stirring, mechanical stirring, sonication, etc.<br>
The organic solvent containing the theaflavins is then contacted with dilute aqueous base. Preferably, the base is dilute hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate. In one embodiment, the dilute aqueous base is 5% NaHCOa, which is contacted with organic solvent in a separatory funnel. While not wishing to bound by theory, contacting the organic solvent with dilute base presumably removes base soluble impurities from the mixture of theaflavins. The solvent is next separated from the dilute aqueous base solution, preferably, by using a separatory funnel.<br>
In one embodiment, the concentration of the mixture of theaflavins in the reaction mixture after extractive workup comprises between about 5% and about 90% of the total mass of non-volatile material. In another embodiment, the concentration of the mixture of theaflavins in the reaction mixture after extractive workup comprises between about 10% and about 80% of the total mass of non-volatile material. In another embodiment, the concentration of the mixture of theaflavins in the reaction mixture after extractive workup comprises between about 20% and about 70% of the total mass of non-volatile material.<br>
The separated organic solvent is then contacted with a chromatographic media to provide the mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-<br>
3,3'-digallate. Preferably, the organic solution is concentrated before contacting with the chromatographic media. The chromatographic media may be any chromatography support known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the chromatographic media is silica gel. Preferably, the organic solvent containing the mixture of theaflavins is loaded onto chromatographic media, which has been packed in a column and eluted with a second organic solvent to provide the mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate. In one embodiment, the organic solvent containing the mixture of theaflavins is loaded onto a silica gel column and is eluted with 40% ethyl acetate in hexanes. In some situations, batch use of chromatographic media may be preferred. Selection of the type and amount of chromatographic media, choice of eluting solvent, length of column, etc. is within the ambit of those of skill in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate is substantially pure (i.e., free of other material) after elution from the chromatographic media. Preferably, the mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate is greater than 95% pure, more preferably, greater than 97% pure and most preferably, greater than 99% pure as determined by routine analytical methods well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The proportion of the individual theaflavins in the mixture of theaflavins will reflect the proportion of individual theaflavins in green tea leaves and will, accordingly, vary with source of green tea leaves. In one embodiment, the mixture of theaflavins is comprised of between about 40% and about 50% theaflavin, between about 15% and about 25% of theaflavin-3-gallate, between about 10% and about 14% theaflavin-3'-gallate and between about 15% and about 25% of theaflavin-3,3'-digallate. In another embodiment, the mixture of theaflavins is comprised of about 47% theaflavin, about 19% of theaflavin-3-gallate, about 14% theaflavin-3'-gallate and about 20% of theaflavin-3,3'-digallate.<br>
In a second aspect, the current invention provides a method of making theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, each as a separate compound. First, tea polyphenols, are contacted with an aqueous buffer to form a reaction mixture. Tea polyphenols may be purchased from commercial sources (Yuan Xiang Biopharm Company, Ltd., Shanghai, China) and may be used as provided by the supplier. Polyphenol oxidase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ) is added to the reaction mixture.

Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The present pharmaceutical compositions typically contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, so as to provide the form for proper administration to a patient. The compounds of the invention may be present at a level of between about 5%and about 50%(w/w), preferably, about 11% in the pharmaceutical composition. Total amount of the compound of the invention per dose may be between about 70 mg and about 210 mg.<br>
When administered to a patient, the compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle are preferably sterile. Water, saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions may be employed as liquid vehicles. Other suitable pharmaceutical vehicles include excipients such as starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present pharmaceutical compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents may be used. A general discussion of the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions may be found in Remington, 'The Science and Practice of Pharmacy," 19th Edition.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention may be manufactured by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or auxiliaries, which facilitate<br><br>
processing of compounds of the invention into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.<br>
The present pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, emulsions or any other form suitable for oral use. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a capsule (see e.g., Grosswald et al, United States Patent No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical vehicles have been described in the art (see Remington, "The Science and Practice of Pharmacy," 19th Edition, 1995). Orally administered pharmaceutical compositions may contain one or more optional agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry coloring agents and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, when in tablet or pill form, the pharmaceutical compositions may be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compounds of the invention. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard vehicles such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Such vehicles are preferably of pharmaceutical grade.<br>
For oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers, excipients or diluents include water, saline, alkyleneglycols (e.g., propylene glycol), polyalkylene glycols (e.g., polyethylene glycol) oils, alcohols, slightly acidic buffers between pH 4 and pH 6 (e.g., acetate, citrate, ascorbate at between about 5.0 mM to about 50.0 mM), etc. Additionally, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, bile salts, acylcarnitines and the like may be added. For buccal administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, etc. formulated in conventional manner.<br>
When a compound of the invention is acidic or basic, it may be included in any of the above-described formulations as the free acid or free base, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a solvate or hydrate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts substantially retain the activity of the free acid or base, may be prepared by reaction with bases or acids and tend to be more soluble in aqueous and other protic solvents than the corresponding free acid or base form.<br>

Examples<br>
The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples, which describe in detail, preparation of compounds of the invention and methods for assaying for biological activity. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to materials and methods, may be practiced without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1: Preparation and Isolation of the Mixture of Theaflavin, Tbeaflavin-3-gallate, Theaflavin-3'-gallate and Theaflavin-33' digallate<br>
Green tea leaves (100 kg) obtained from FML Tea Trading Co., Ltd., Xiamen, China and 0.15 M phosphate buffer (1000 L, pH 6.4) was added to a slurry fermenter maintained at 30 °C. Oxygen was added to the fermenter at a flow rate of 20 L/sec until the total oxygen concentration was 22%, to initiate fermentation. The reaction mixture was stirred and fermented for about 1 hour under a 22% oxygen atmosphere.<br>
The reaction mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant decanted. The supernatant was filtered to remove solids. About 1000 L of ethyl acetate was added to the aqueous filtrate, which terminated fermentation and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed three times with 1000 L of 5% NaHCOs and ethyl acetate was removed in vacua. Then, the residue was dissolved in a small portion of 40% ethyl acetate/hexanes, loaded onto a column, which contained 150 kg of silica gel and eluted with 40% ethyl acetate/hexanes to provide a mixture of theaflavin , theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-<br>
gallate and theaflavin-3,3' digallate (typically, between about 50 kg to 60 kg) in 99.3% purity as determined by reverse phase High Pressure Reverse Phase Chromatography (HPLC). The mixture of theaflavins comprised 46.8% theaflavin, 18.5% theafiavin-3-gallate, 13.7% theaflavin-3'-gallate and 20.3% theaflavin-353' digallate as determined by HPLC-MS.<br>
Example 2: Preparation and Isolation of Theaflavin, Theaflavin-3-galIate, Tbeaflavin-3'-gallate and Theaflavin-3,3' digallate, Each as a Separate Compound<br>
Tea polyphenol (100 kg), which contains 98.6%, catechins (45.6% epigallocatechin gallate), (Yuan Xiang Biopharm Company, Ltd., Shanghai, China), 1000 L of 0.15 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.4) and 10 kg of polyphenol oxidase was added to a slurry fermenter at 25 °C with stirring. Oxygen at a flow rate of 20 L/sec was added to the fermenter until the total oxygen concentration was 22%, to initiate fermentation. The reaction mixture was stirred and fermented for about 40 minutes under a 22% oxygen atmosphere.<br>
The reaction mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant decanted. The supernatant was filtered to remove solids. About 1000 L of ethyl acetate was added to the aqueous filtrate, which terminated fermentation and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed three times with 1000 L of 5% NaHCOs and ethyl acetate was removed in vacua. Then, the residue was dissolved in a small portion of 40% ethyl acetate/hexanes and divided into 20 separate portions. Each portion was then loaded onto a column containing 150 kg of silica gel and eluted with 40% ethyl acetate/hexanes to provide theaflavin (25 kg), theaflavin-3-gallate (9kg), theaflavin-3'-gallate(6 kg) and theaflavin-3,3' digallate (10 kg), each as a separate compound. The theaflavins were then further purified by recrystallization from ethanol. The final purity of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3' digallate, as determined by HPLC was 99.1%, 98.7%, 97.8% and 99.3%, respectively. The structure of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3' digallate was determined by HPLC-MS.<br>
Example 3: Preparation of Soft Gels of Theaflavins<br>
Beeswax (2 kg) was added to olive oil (500 kg) at 80 °C with stirring for 30 minutes and cooled to 40 °C. A mixture of theaflavins (100 kg), prepared via the method of Example 1, was mixed thoroughly into the above mixture of beeswax and olive oil. The resulting mixture of theaflavins, beeswax and olive oil were placed into a gel comprised of<br>
gelatin powder to prepare the soft gel capsules. Each soft gel capsule is about 700mg of which about 75mg are the mixture of theaflavins.<br>
Example 4: Use of Theaflavins to Elevate Lipid Profile in Rats<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 100 g to 130 g were divided into nine groups of ten rats. The animals were individually housed in stainless-steel cages with screen bottoms in a room maintained at between 22 °C and 24 °C. They were fed stationary feedstuff and water as follows as described in Table 1. In addition the rats in Group TF1-1, TF1-2 or TF1 -3 were fed pure theaflavin in a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively. The animals in group TF2A-2, TF2B-2 or RF3-2 were fed pure theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, respectively in a dosage of 2 mg/kg/day . The animals in group CA-1 and CA-2 were fed catechins in a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day or 2 mg/kg/day, respectively.<br><br>
The Sprague Dawley rats were fed the above diets for eight weeks before sampling. The rats were not fed for 12 hours prior to sampling. The rats were given either theaflavin,<br>
theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate, theaflavin-3,3'-digallate or catechin one hour in advance of collecting the blood sample.<br>
Table 2 Lipids profile of rats after taking catechin or theaflavins<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
As shown in Table 2, the rats in the theaflavin groups had greatly decreased dose dependent plasma levels of total cholesterol ("TC"), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol ("LDL-C") and triglyceride ("TG") when compared with to the control group. Theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate, theaflavin-3,3'-digallate were more effective in reducing plasma levels of TC, LDL-C and TG than catechin.<br>
Example 5: Effect of a Mixture of Theaflavins on Subjects with Mild to Moderate<br>
Hyperlipidemia<br>
Choleve™ is a mixture of theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate prepared as described in Example 1. The clinical trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, which lasts for 12 weeks.<br>
Patients were 19 years of age and older with mild to moderate hyperlipidemia (LDL-C 130-190 mg/dL) on a low fat diet and were recruited from outpatient clinics in six hospitals in China. Patients were excluded if their baseline triglycerides were 350 mg/dL or greater or if they had uncontrolled hypertension ( &gt;160/95 mm Hg). Patients with active pulmonary, hematologic, hepatic, gastrointestinal or renal disease, pre-malignant or malignant disease, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, a history of coronary heart disease or other<br>
atherosclerotic disease were also excluded. Patients with pathological values among routine clinical chemistry or hematological parameters or if they consumed &gt; 32% of daily energy from fat or had a body mass index ^35 were also excluded. Subjects were also excluded if they were taking any lipid lowering medications or drugs that might interfere with lipid metabolism, cardiac or other vasoactive medications including antihypertensive drugs, thyroid hormones, oral contraceptives, cyclic hormone replacement therapy, dietary supplements (e.g., fish oils, niacin at doses &gt;400mg/day, dietary fiber supplements), or antioxidants and they were prohibited from taking these medications during the course of the study. Patients were required to maintain a stable diet and level of physical activity during a 12-week study.<br>
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were met by two hundred and forty patients. After randomization, clinic visits were scheduled in the morning of weeks 4, 8, and 12 after a 12-hour fast. Parameters measured at each visit included body weight, blood pressure and heart rate. Subjects were asked to record study capsules taken, concomitant medications, and any adverse events in subject diaries. Study capsules were dispensed at baseline, week 4, and week 8. Nutrient intake was assessed using 3-day food records completed by the subjects prior to baseline and after eight weeks of treatment. Lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were measured at week -2, week 0, week 4 and week 12. Lipids and lipoproteins were analyzed enzymatically using standard laboratory procedures. The results, which include serum chemistry and hematology tests, were tested on an automatic biochemical instrument (Sybchron Clinical System LX 20, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Shanghai Representative Office Room 3203-3205, Hong Kong Plaza, South Building, 283 Huai Hai Zhong Road, Shanghai, China 200021). Platelet aggregation was induced by adenosine diphosphate and the rate of platelet aggregation was determined by the optical density measurements at 915 run.<br>
Two hundred forty subjects were randomized into the study, and two hundred and twenty subjects completed the trial. The baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. All subjects were Asian with 95% of subjects in the treatment group and 88% in the placebo group finishing the study. Fourteen subjects failed to return, five subjects were discontinued from the study at their request and one subject was terminated for protocol violation.<br>
After four weeks and twelve weeks of oral administration of Choleve™, the serum LDL-C level in the subjects decreased by 9.6% (4.08mmol/l-3.68mmol/L) and 16.4%<br>
(4.08mmol/l-3.40mmol/l) compared to the base line at start (P=0.0001) (see Tables 3 and 4). At the same time, Choleve™ caused 6.7% and 11.3% decrease in the serum TC level (P=0.0001). On the other hand, the LDL-C and TC levels in the placebo group showed no significant changes after four weeks and twelve weeks. However, there are no significant changes in the TG and high density lipoprotein ("HDL") levels between Choleve™ and placebo group after 12 weeks treatment.<br>
