In the case of controlling the arthropod pest which is parasitic on a cultivating plant, for example, the arthropod pests controlling composition of the present invention is sprayed onto the upper side of the cultivating plant, pouring into the vicinities of a root of the cultivation plant and the like.<br>
When the arthropod pests controlling composition of the present invention is used for a control of arthropod pests in agriculture and forestry, the application amount is usually 0.1 to 10,000 g as the compound of the present invention per 1,000 m2. In case of the arthropod pests controlling composition of the present invention are formulated to emulsif iable concentrates, flowables, wettable powders and microcapsules, they are usually applied by spraying after dilution with water to have the concentration of the compound of the present invention to 10 to 10,000 ppm. In case of the arthropod pests controlling composition of the present invention are formulated to oil solutions, dusts and granules, they are usually applied as such.<br>
When the arthropod pests controlling composition of the present invention is used for a control of epidemic, the application amount is usually 0.001 to 100 mg as the compound of the present invention per 1 m2 in case of application for plane surface, and 0 . 001 to 10 mg as the compound of the present invention per 1 m3 in case of application for open space. In the case of the arthropod pests controlling composition of the present invention are formulated to emulsifiable concentrates, flowables, wettable powders and microcapsules, they are usually applied after<br><br>
dilution with water to have the concentration of the compound of the present invention to 0.01 to 100,000 ppm. In case of the arthropod pests controlling composition of the present invention are formulated tt oil solutions, aerosols, smoking agents and poison baits are usually applied as such.<br>

As a result, in the treatment of the compound of the present invention 1 to 9, 11, 13 to 15, 17 to 23, the numbers of the living cotton aphids {Aphis gossypii) were three or less. On the other hand, in the non-treatment,, the number of the living cotton aphids {Aphis gossypii) was twenty or more. Industrial Applicability<br><br>
By using the compound of the present invention, arthropod pests can be controlled.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
