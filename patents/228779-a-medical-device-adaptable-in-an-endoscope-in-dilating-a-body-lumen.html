				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a transparent dilator device for use in a lumen<br>
of a patient's body.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Constriction of natural body lumens, such as those of the human gastrointestinal<br>
tract, can occur in numerous ways. Some strictures are caused by muscular<br>
spasm, others by disease, and others by injury. Regardless of the cause, the<br>
typical method of treatment is to physically dilate the region using a medical<br>
device designed for that purpose.<br>
Several types of devices are used for dilation. One generally established type is a<br>
bougie. Bougie tubes may be in the form of a mercury- or tungsten-filled tube<br>
with a tapered end that gradually opens the strictured esophagus as it is pushed<br>
past the treatment site. These devices come in a series of increasing sizes, each<br>
tube having a single effective dilating diameter, generally between 3.3 and 20<br>
mm (10 and 60 French). (French is a measure of circumference based on the<br>
diameter in millimeters, mm). The bougie is typically introduced blindly after the<br>
physician has judged the proper beginning size with an endoscope. Some<br>
physicians follow a rule of thumb not to dilate a stricture more than three<br>
successive French sizes (3 mm) in a single session. If the lumen has not<br>
satisfactorily been opened after three sizes, the patient returns at a later time for<br>
another treatment session.<br><br>
Another type of device is a wire-guided dilator. These devices are passed into the<br>
patient over a guidewire that has been pre-fed along a lumen of the<br>
gastrointestinal tract. The guidewire keeps the tip of the device in the lumen<br>
while it is being passed, to avoid perforating through the wall of the lumen.<br>
These devices have a single outer dilating diameter and typically have a<br>
radiopaque component so that they are visible under fluoroscopy. The following<br>
patent documents disclose various devices in the art :US 5,366,471; US<br>
6,334,863; US 5,766,202; and GB 2023009A.<br>
A third type of dilating device is a balloon. Balloon dilators may be comprised of<br>
polyethylene, and may be introduced through the working channel of an<br>
endoscope. The physician views the proximal end of a stricture site with an<br>
endoscope and introduces the deflated balloon into the narrowed area. The<br>
balloon is then inflated with saline or other fluid to effectively open the stricture<br>
site pneumatically. Balloons provide the advantages of multiple dilator diameters<br>
with a single intubation, passage through the working channel of an endoscope,<br>
and visualization of a stricture site from the proximal end.<br>
Other devices such as double tapered bougies, pneumatic bougies, illuminating<br>
bougies, solid dilator devices attached to the distal end of an endoscope, and<br>
variable stiffness dilators have been previously described in the art. The following<br>
patent documents disclose various types of devices in the art: US 6,010,520; US<br>
4,832,691; US 5,624,432; US 5,718,666; WO 98/47422.<br>
US 5,188,596 discloses a medical device of the type set forth in the preamble of<br>
the accompanying claim 1.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Applicants have recognized the need for a relatively low cost dilator (disposable<br>
or non-disposable) which is relatively easy and convenient to use, and which<br>
allows the physician to directly visualize the stricture being dilated. In one<br>
embodiment, the present invention provides a medical device for use in dilating a<br>
body lumen. The medical device comprises at least one generally transparent<br>
segment, and a channel associated with the transparent segment sized for<br>
receiving an endoscope. The generally transparent segment includes at least one<br>
outer surface portion having a diameter sized for providing dilation of a body<br>
lumen. The generally transparent segment is non-inflatable. In one embodiment,<br>
the device can comprise a plurality of transparent sections, each section having<br>
an outer surface portion with a different diameter sized for sequential dilation of<br>
a stricture. The medical device can include at least one marking associated with<br>
the transparent segment for indicating the position and/or value of a dilation<br>
diameter.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of medicine, specifically to surgery, urology,<br>
or gastroenterology, in which a physician intends to alter the size of a constricted body lumen<br>
in a patient, or otherwise temporarily or permanently enlarge a portion of a body lumen. By<br>
way of example, the present invention is illustrated and described for application to an<br>
esophageal stricture of a human patient. However, the present invention is applicable for use<br>
in other natural lumens of human patients, including the urinary tract, biliary tract, lower<br>
gastrointestinal tract, or bronchus; and the present invention may also be used in other animals<br>
(e.g. for veterinary medicine), including mammals other than humans.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a wire-guided dilator 10 described in prior art, including a guidewire<br>
channel 13, a first radiopaque marker 14, and a second radiopaque marker 15. Guidewire<br>
channel 13 allows wire-guided dilator 10 to be passed over a previously placed guidewire<br>
along the lumen of a patient. First radiopaque marker 14 and second radiopaque marker 15<br>
are detectable under fluoroscopy to determine the position of wire-guided dilator 10 relative<br>
to a strictured area. This provides confirmation to the physician of dilation to the full<br>
diameter of the device. The fluoroscopy procedure can be costly and can expose the<br>
physician and patient to radiation.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a dilator 18 of the present invention, including a handle 19 at the<br>
device's proximal end, a tube 20, a transparent segment 21, and a tapered tip 22 at its distal<br><br>
end. Handle 19 of FIG. 2 includes a longitudinal channel for receiving an endoscope 50 (see<br>
FIG 3). Handle 19 provides the physician a location to grip dilator 18 and may be made from<br>
an elastic material, such as silicone. In one embodiment, the proximal portion of handle 19<br>
can have an opening (such as an opening in a flexible, elastic seal or boot made of silicone or<br>
a suitable flexible elastic polymeric material), the hole being slightly smaller than the<br>
diameter of the endoscope. Such an arrangement can provide frictional engagement of the<br>
handle 19 with the endoscope 50 due to the drag force encountered in passing the endoscope<br>
through the opening. This feature allows the physician to hold either endoscope 50 or tube 20<br>
in a one-handed fashion to position both the endoscope and the dilator 18 with direct<br>
visualization of a body lumen 60 (FIG. 3) during introduction or advancement of the device.<br>
Tube 20 shown in FIG. 2 may be made of a flexible polymer, examples of which<br>
include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), polyurethane, or silicone.<br>
In one embodiment, tube 20 is made of a transparent flexible polymer, but it may also be<br>
made from an opaque material. A suitable transparent material from which tube 20 can be<br>
manufactured is available as 2222RX-70 Clear 000X from Alpha-Gary Corporation<br>
(Leominster, MA). Commercially available clear flexible PVC tubing such as Kuri Tec K050<br>
0810 from Kuriyama of America Inc. (Elk Grove Village, IL) may also be used for tube 20.<br>
First channel 23 of FIG. 2 is appropriately sized to receive endoscope 50 (see FIG. 3).<br>
Various endoscopes of varying types and sizes may be used inside the present invention,<br>
including, but not limited to, bronchoscopes, colonoscopes, cystoscopes, and gastroscopes.<br>
Endoscope 50 may comprise a fiberscope or a videoscope, and may employ a CMOS<br>
(Complimentary Metallic Oxide Semiconductor) chip, a miniature camera, or other<br>
visualization device. In one embodiment, first channel 23 may be about 2mm greater in<br>
diameter than the diameter of endoscope 50 used in the procedure so that relative motion<br>
between endoscope 50 and dilator 18 can occur smoothly under physician control. By way of<br>
example, a 9.5mm diameter gastroscope could be inserted into an 11.5mm diameter first<br>
channel 23 of dilator 18 to dilate an esophageal stricture. However, dilator 18 can be sized<br>
and configured to accommodate other endoscopes. In various other embodiments, first<br><br>
channel 23 may have a diameter in the range of, but not limited to, about 3mm to about<br>
15mm.<br>
Fourth outer diameter D4 of FIG 2 can be made as small as feasible for reason of<br>
patient tolerance during the procedure. Fourth outer diameter D4 may be the same as the<br>
largest diameter of transparent segment 21, or alternatively, D4 may be less than the largest<br>
diameter in transparent segment 21. The dimensions of first channel 23 and fourth outer<br>
diameter D4 determine the wall thickness of tube 20. This wall thickness should provide<br>
adequate axial stiffness to advance transparent segment 21 of dilator 18 past stricture 61<br>
without kinking, when used in conjunction with endoscope 50. The presence of endoscope 50<br>
inside tube 20 during advancement adds to the stiffness of dilator 18, and greatly reduces the<br>
likelihood of kinking or folding tube 20 during use. When tube 20 is made from a flexible<br>
polymer such as a flexible PVC material, wall thickness including a range from about 1mm to<br>
about 4mm may be used. If a portion of transparent segment 21 is made from a relatively<br>
more rigid material, a wall thickness of 1mm or less may be used.<br>
The length of tube 20 in FIG. 2 should be appropriately sized to comfortably reach the<br>
targeted area within the body while handle 19 remains outside the body for physician control.<br>
A low coefficient of friction on tube 20 allows easy sliding along the surface of body lumen<br>
60. And, because the physician can reposition endoscope 50 within tube 20 to get a different<br>
view, easy sliding of endoscope 50 within tube 20 may also be desired. A suitable lubricant<br>
or low friction material (wet or dry) can be employed. For instance, a lubricating gel may be<br>
used to lower the coefficient of friction between tube 20 and body lumen 60, and between<br>
endoscope 50 and tube 20. Likewise, a suitable lubricant or other low friction material (such<br>
as a coating 31 shown in Figure 4) could be applied to the inner or outer surfaces (or both) of<br>
tube 20 or transparent segment 21 (or both) to facilitate sliding of endoscope 50 within tube<br>
20 and also sliding of tube 20 within body lumen 60.<br>
FIG.3 shows the dilator 18 being used in body lumen 60 to dilate a stricture 61.<br>
Dilator 18 dilates stricture 61 in body lumen 60 under direct visualization by endoscope 50<br>
positioned inside the device, allowing the physician to see along the entire length of stricture<br><br>
61 from the inside out. The invention replaces the current methods of dilating body lumen 60<br>
without direct visualization and improves on current methods of dilating with balloons and<br>
other devices that allow visualization from only the proximal side of stricture 61 during the<br>
procedure. By way of example, this illustration shows the invention used to dilate an<br>
esophageal stricture, but it could be used to dilate constrictions in other body lumens.<br>
Transparent segment 21 shown in FIG. 4 and in FIG. 5 is a transparent portion of the<br>
device through which a physician views the stricture 61 during dilation of stricture 61.<br>
Transparent segment 21 extends from the distal portion of tube 20 and may be made of a<br>
transparent material, including clear PVC, TPE, polyurethane, glass, or polycarbonate.<br>
Attachment means for attaching transparent segment 21 to tube 20 may include a flange with<br>
adhesive, a plurality of mechanical ribs, a plurality of screw-type threads, or other<br>
combinations of geometric projections and adhesives. Tube 20 and transparent segment 21<br>
may also be formed as a single, unitary piece, such as by forming tube 20 and transparent<br>
segment 21 together by molding or casting. Rigid segments may also be incorporated into<br>
transparent segment 21, especially in instances where wall thickness is about 1mm or less.<br>
Such rigid segments could be over-molded in place or fixed by adhesive in a desired location.<br>
In one embodiment, first channel 23 (FIG. 2) extends into transparent segment 21 so that<br>
endoscope 50 may be advanced within transparent segment 21.<br>
The transparency of transparent segment 21 allows direct visualization of tissue<br>
outside the device from endoscope 50 located within the device. Therefore, it can be<br>
desirable to minimize distortion or obstruction of view through transparent segment 21.<br>
Suitable transparency of transparent segment 21 can be accomplished by controlling material<br>
selection and molding finish. The material from which transparent segment 21 is constructed<br>
should be clear, and the mold used should be polished so that the molded part has a smooth<br>
outer surface. Transparent segment 21 may include markings 43 (Figure 5) such as one or<br>
more markings 43 indicating the outside diameter of transparent segment 21 at the<br>
longitudinal position of the particular marking. Anatomical landmarks, color variations,<br>
tissue differences, foreign bodies, and any markings 43 (FIG. 5), and other items of interest<br>
should be recognizable when viewed with endoscope 50 disposed within transparent segment<br><br>
21. An appropriate material for transparent segment 21 can have a haze value of about 5% or<br>
less, and have a light transmission property of about 80% or greater. Haze value is a material<br>
property, expressed in percent, describing the amount of "cloudiness" in a material caused by<br>
particulate impurities, molecular structure, or degree of crystallinity, resulting in scattering of<br>
light and apparent cloudiness. Light transmission is a material property indicating the<br>
percentage of incident light that passes through an object. In addition to using transparent<br>
material to form segment 21, a mold used to create segment 21 can be highly polished to<br>
create a smooth surface that does not distort the view seen through endoscope 50 when the<br>
viewing device of endoscope is disposed inside segment 21 to view lumen tissue outside of<br>
segment 21.<br>
Having a low coefficient of friction of transparent segment 21 allows the device to<br>
slide freely inside body lumen 60, especially during dilation of stricture 61. Lubricating gel,<br>
such as K-Y brand lubricating jelly available from Johnson and Johnson can be used to lower<br>
the coefficient of friction during use. In one embodiment, a coating 31 (FIG. 2) can be<br>
disposed on one or both of the inner and outer surfaces of the transparent segment 21, in<br>
which coating 31 is transparent and has a lower coefficient of friction when hydrated than<br>
when dry. One example of coating 31 is a hydrogel material made by the interaction of poly-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone with one or more isocyanate prepolymers. A coating such as Hydromer®<br>
Lubricious Medical Coatings by Hydromer Inc. (Somerville, NJ) can be used for coating 31.<br>
Such a coating can reduce the drag force along the axis of a lumen during dilation, creating a<br>
more efficient device when compared to existing dilators.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a section view of dilator 18 including a first outer diameter Dl and a<br>
tapered tip 22. Tapered tip 22 may be made of a flexible polymer that is pliable compared to<br>
body tissue and may be attached to the distal end of transparent segment 21. In one<br>
embodiment, tapered tip 22 can be made with the same material as transparent segment 21, if<br>
transparent segment 21 is made of a flexible polymer. In one embodiment, a biomedical<br>
grade of clear flexible PVC having a hardness value of about 60 to 80 on the Shore A scale<br>
can be used to form tapered tip 22 and transparent segment 21. For example, a clear flexible<br>
PVC material such as XV-3450 from PolyOne Corp. (Avon Lake, OH) could be used to mold<br><br>
both transparent segment 21 and tapered tip 22 as a single part. Another material from which<br>
tip 22 and segment 21 may be formed is material designated 2222RX-70 Clear 000X from<br>
Alpha-Gary Corp (Leominster, MA), which material can be gamma stable to allow gamma<br>
radiation to be used for sterilization. Other suitable materials such as TPE or polyurethane<br>
can also be used.<br>
Tapered tip 22 facilitates intubation into body lumen 60 by gradually tapering from a<br>
first outer diameter D1 to a narrow leading segment 34 with an exterior taper angle thetal, as<br>
shown in FIG. 4. In one embodiment, tapered tip 22 includes a second channel 27 in<br>
communication with a conical inner contour 32 and first channel 23 so that the device can be<br>
threaded over a guidewire. Second channel 27 can be sized appropriately for a guidewire,<br>
including diameters in the range from about 0.5mm to about 1.5mm. Exterior taper angle<br>
thetal can be selected to provide a desired amount of radial force transmitted against stricture<br>
61 for a given level of axial force (force parallel to length of the dilator 18) applied by the<br>
physician. Generally, a low value of exterior taper angle provides an efficient, comfortable<br>
transmission of radial force against the stricture, with the trade-off that low values of exterior<br>
taper angle generally increase the length of the dilator 18 that must be inserted past the<br>
stricture. For instance and without limitation, the dilator can have an exterior taper angle<br>
thetal in a range including about 3 degrees to about 15 degrees. In one embodiment, the taper<br>
angle can be between about 6.5 and about 7.5 degrees.<br>
FIG. 4 shows conical inner contour 32 connecting first channel 23 to second channel<br>
27 with an interior taper angle theta2. The connection has a conical shape to reduce the glare<br>
from endoscope 50 during use. Conical inner contour 32 also facilitates molding by allowing<br>
a central core pin to be tapered for ease of removal. In one embodiment, the value of interior<br>
taper angle theta2 is different from value of exterior taper angle thetal to provide a varying<br>
wall thickness along the length of the device, so that radial strength can be tailored as needed<br>
along the length of the device. By way of example, the exterior taper angle thetal can be<br>
about 7 degrees, and the interior taper angle theta2 can be about 6 degrees.<br><br>
In FIG. 4, conical inner contour is shown initiating at the distal end of a segment with<br>
first outer diameter Dl, but other initiation locations are possible. For example, if conical<br>
inner contour 32 initiates at a more proximal location (e.g. forward of the "14 mm" marking<br>
in Figure 4), a thicker wall is created at the distal portion of a segment with first outer<br>
diameter Dl, providing radial stiffness to that area while still allowing endoscope 50 to slide<br>
far enough to view out tapered tip 22 during insertion. Such an arrangement can help ensure<br>
adequate radial strength of in the portion of the device having inner diameter Dl.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts a preferred embodiment of transparent segment 21 comprised of a first<br>
transparent section 21A having a first outer diameter Dl; a second transparent section 21B<br>
having a second outer diameter D2, and a third transparent section 21C having a third outer<br>
diameter D3, each pair of adjacent sections separated by a transition 44. The first, second and<br>
third sections can each be generally cylindrical. Transitions 44 provide a tapered (linear or<br>
curvilinear) transition in diameter from the outer diameter of one section to the outer<br>
diameter of the adjacent section. The transitions can have can have a hollow conical<br>
configuration, such as a conical shape generally the same as that of a truncated cone having a<br>
centrally located passageway. Alternatively, the dilator 18 can have diameters Dl, D2, D3,<br>
and D4 on a single continuous outer surface portion which is tapered linearly or curvilinearly<br>
fromDltoD4.<br>
Figure 5 also shows plurality of markings 43 for the physician to select and position<br>
the desired dilating diameter in the area of stricture 61 during the procedure. Markings 43<br>
provided to be visible through the optical device (e.g. camera, fiber optic cable, etc.)<br>
associated with the endoscope 50 and may have several uses, including delineating the<br>
boundaries of a single dilating diameter, or indicating the numeric value of a dilating<br>
diameter. Markings 43 may be molded into the part, applied with ink, etched on the device,<br>
or applied by any other suitable method. In one embodiment, numerical indications may be<br>
applied to the outer surface of transparent segment 21 in multiple locations, some of which<br>
are readable by endoscope 50 from inside the device (necessitating them to appear backwards<br>
from the exterior of the device, but appearing forward from inside the device), and some of<br>
which are readable from the exterior of the device (appear backward from endoscope 50<br><br>
inside the device). In addition to markings comprising numerals or letters, other embodiments<br>
of plurality of markings 43 may include use of various other indicia, including without<br>
limitation one or more different colors, and/or use of different geometric shapes, such as to<br>
designate different sections or segments, or attributes of different portions of the device. For<br>
instance, a row or column of circles could be used to designate a first section, a pattern of<br>
circles and dashes could designate a second section, and a pattern of circles, dashes, and<br>
squares could designate a third section. Markings 43 can also be coated or otherwise treated<br>
with a substance to make them luminous or glow in reduced lighting.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a cross section of transparent segment 21 and tapered tip 22 of FIG 5<br>
taken at line 6-6 with endoscope 50 positioned inside. A field of view 52 is depicted to<br>
indicate the area in view by the physician. Because endoscope 50 is movable with respect to<br>
dilator 18, a change in the position of endoscope 50 allows the physician to see a different<br>
area of body lumen 60 within field of view 52.<br>
FIGs 7A-7D show four possible steps a physician may use to dilate stricture 61 with<br>
dilator 18 and endoscope 50. FIG. 7A shows the relative positions of endoscope 50 and<br>
dilator 18 upon insertion into body lumen 60 to a location of stricture 61. In this position,<br>
field of view 52 is used to view body lumen 60 during insertion, and to view the proximal<br>
location of stricture 61.<br>
FIG 7B shows endoscope 50 at a first viewpoint 53 so field of view 52 includes first<br>
outer diameter Dl. While viewing plurality of markings 43 for reference, dilator 18 is<br>
advanced into stricture 61 causing dilation to first outer diameter Dl. Plurality of markings<br>
43 may delineate the boundaries of diameter Dl and may also indicate its numerical value. In<br>
this manner, the physician has a visual indication through endoscope 50 of where to position<br>
dilator 18 with respect to stricture 61 for precise dilation to a desired diameter.<br>
FIG. 7C shows a next potential step to further dilate stricture 61 if desired by the<br>
physician. Endoscope 50 is placed at a second viewpoint 54 relative to dilator 18 so that field<br>
of view 52 includes second outer diameter D2. The medical device is further advanced into<br><br>
stricture 61 to further dilate to second outer diameter D2 while viewing another portion of<br>
plurality of markings 43 for reference.<br>
FIG. 7D shows endoscope 50 at a third viewpoint 55 so that field of view 52 includes<br>
third outer diameter D3. Again, the medical device may be further advanced to dilate stricture<br>
61 to third outer diameter D3 while again viewing yet another portion of plurality of markings<br>
43 as a reference. In this manner, the physician can visually examine the entire length of a<br>
stricture with endoscope 50 as the dilation occurs.<br>
An alternative method of use is to first place a guidewire in body lumen 60 of the<br>
patient, then thread dilator 18 over that guidewire using second channel 27, conical inner<br>
contour 32, and first channel 23. Dilator 18 may then slide into the guidewire, after which<br>
endoscope 50 may be placed into first channel 23. The guidewire does not need to be<br>
threaded through the working channel of endoscope 50, but a physician may do so if desired.<br>
The combination of endoscope 50, dilator 18, and guidewire could then be used according to<br>
the steps illustrated in FIGs. 7A-7D.<br>
A physician advancing a dilator through a stricture 61 will normally feel resistance. In<br>
prior art devices where the physician attempts to "blindly" introduce a dilator, perforation or<br>
other damage to the body lumen may occur. Further, if such damage occurs, the physician<br>
may not immediately recognize that damage has occurred. The present invention can permit<br>
the physician to visualize a medical procedure (e.g. dilation of a stricture) as the procedure is<br>
performed, thereby providing the physician with immediate feedback on the state of the tissue<br>
being treated. Such visualization can help in avoiding unintended damage of tissue which<br>
might otherwise occur if the physician is not able to directly visualize the procedure. In the<br>
unlikely even that damage does occur, the physician can immediately notice it and can choose<br>
to cease treatment and begin a new course of action to repair the damage. Direct visualization<br>
provided by endoscope 50 inside dilator 18 allows the physician to know that he/she has not<br>
perforated, bruised, or otherwise damaged body lumen 60.<br><br>
Another useful feature of the dilator 18 is that it provides one with the ability to dilate<br>
to more than one diameter with a single introduction of the device, and with precision. This is<br>
made possible by the ability to see plurality of markings 43 from inside transparent segment<br>
21 to identify a particular dilating diameter. Previously disclosed devices with multiple<br>
diameters rely on tactile feedback, remote markings, or costly pressure meters (e.g. in the<br>
case of balloons) to control the diameter. The intuitive nature of plurality of markings 43<br>
allows the physician to easily select the desired diameter by looking clearly through the<br>
device, along the whole length of stricture 61, adding precision to the device when compared<br>
to current methods, which may involve elaborate measuring schemes.<br>
Dilator 18 can also be less costly to manufacture than some balloon style dilators.<br>
Accordingly, devices of the present invention may be cost effectively packaged and sold as a<br>
single-use, disposable product which does not require cleaning or re-sterilization. Dilator 18<br>
can be pre-sterilized and packaged in a sterile pouch or other suitable package.<br>
Dilator 18 can also provide reliability in terms of dilating diameter compared to<br>
certain balloon type dilators. Some balloons may not hold a constant diameter when inflated,<br>
so the dilation is not as reproducible as a tube of known size being passed through a<br>
constricted area. Dilator 18 provides two-vector shearing of stricture 61. This results from<br>
sliding a tapered-tip device through a narrowed area, thereby applying forces in both the axial<br>
and radial directions. Balloons typically only apply a generally radial directed force to a<br>
stricture.<br>
Dilator 18 can also provide affordable and convenient dilation with the ability to<br>
directly visualize the treatment along the entire length (not just a proximal or distal portion) of<br>
a stricture 61 without the use of expensive or potentially harmful radiographic equipment to<br>
confirm placement. When using radiographic equipment, a dilation procedure is typically<br>
performed in a radiographic suite, which often requires additional logistics of scheduling an<br>
additional appointment and different staffing needs, which in turn can require additional time<br>
and cost. Dilator 18 can provide complete direct visualization with endoscope 50 without the<br>
additional costs or time associated with radiographic equipment.<br><br>
The present invention has been illustrated as having a transparent segment<br>
having generally circular cross-sections, but non-circular cross-sections (e.g.oval,<br>
elliptical, polygonal) can also be used, in which case the term "diameter" will be<br>
understood to refer to the maximum dimension of the non-circular cross-section<br>
used for providing dilation. The present invention may be provided in kit form<br>
with other medical devices, and the kit elements can be pre-sterilized and<br>
packaged in a sealed container or envelope to prevent contamination. The<br>
present invention may be provided as single use disposable device or<br>
alternatively, may be constructed for multiple uses.<br>
While various embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed, it will<br>
be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by<br>
way of example only. Further, each element or component of the present<br>
invention may be alternatively described as a means for performing the function<br>
or functions performed by the element or component. Numerous variations,<br>
changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be<br>
limited only by the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
