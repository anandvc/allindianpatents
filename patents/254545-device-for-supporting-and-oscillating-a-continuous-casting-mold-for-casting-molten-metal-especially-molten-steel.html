				<td>DEVICE FOR SUPPORTING AND OSCILLATING A CONTINUOUS<br>
CASTING MOLD FOR CASTING MOLTEN METAL,<br>
ESPECIALLY MOLTEN STEEL<br>
The invention concerns a device for supporting and oscillating a continuous casting mold for casting molten metal, especially molten steel, in accordance with the introductory clause of Claim 1.<br>
German Offenlegungsschrift DE 101 31 715 Al discloses a device for the continuous casting of molten metals, especially steel, with a continuous casting mold mounted on an oscillating frame. The oscillating frame, together with a base frame, the continuous casting mold, and leaf spring assemblies, which support the oscillation frame, are detachably connected in a self-supporting way with a cantilever that can be connected with the continuous casting frame. The oscillation drive is supported on the cantilever and can be dismounted from the side.<br>
In addition, German Offenlegungsschrift DE 102 44 596 Al discloses a device for the continuous casting of metals with a continuous casting mold, which is supported at both ends on an oscillating frame. The oscillating frame represents a first assembly with a guide element in the form of leaf springs, which<br><br>
is supported on stationary support members. In addition, the device includes an oscillation device for oscillating the<br>
continuous casting mold. Each end of the continuous casting mold is provided with an oscillation device, i.e., one is assigned to each oscillating frame.<br>
Devices of this type move large masses, which consist of the weight of the continuous casting mold with sidewalls (narrow-side plates), a support structure for the sidewalls and for water tanks, a mold frame with guide elements arranged on both sides, and oscillation drives. In addition, there is the frictional force between the surfaces of the cast strand and the mold walls during the downstroke of the oscillation drives. All together, the supporting installations for devices of this type are very heavy and, in addition, require a large amount of space, so that accessibility to the parts and assemblies that are subject to wear is complicated. However, the dismounting or mounting of parts that need to be replaced or maintained is a tedious process that requires a long shutdown of the continuous casting machine. This results in considerable economic disadvantages.<br>
The objective of the invention is to shorten the maintenance, dismounting, and mounting times by means of a suitable structural design and thus to reduce shutdown time and expense.<br><br>
In accordance with the invention, the stated objective is achieved by virtue of the fact that, on each side of the plane of symmetry, the oscillation device can be moved laterally into or out of the first assembly by means of a guideway, which is located below the guide element and extends transversely to the plane of symmetry, that the guideway has a T-slot, and that, at its end facing the guideway, the oscillation device has a flange plate that engages the T-slot.<br>
This greatly increases the accessibility to the oscillation device and results in a shorter shutdown time.<br>
The dismounting or remounting of the oscillation drive, which can also include pairs of oscillation devices, presupposes integration in the stationary region, and therefore the invention provides that each oscillation device is supported on a flange plate in the boundary region between the first dismountable assembly and the stationary assembly.<br>
In order to allow easier, faster, and more complete dismounting or mounting, the invention provides that the second dismountable assembly comprises at least one oscillation device with the piston-cylinder drive and control and switching elements.<br>
A specific embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawing and explained in greater detail below.<br>
â€” Figure 1 is a perspective view of a continuous casting<br><br>
mold with assemblies for guide elements, support members, and oscillation devices installed on both sides.<br>
The device (Figure 1) for supporting and oscillating a continuous casting mold 1 is used for the continuous casting of molten metal, especially molten steel, with guide elements 4, which are arranged on both sides of a plane of symmetry 2 that contains the central longitudinal axis 3 of the cast strand and which can comprise excenters, steering levers, springs of any type, or, as illustrated, leaf springs. The guide elements 4 are linked to stationary support members 5, and the continuous casting mold 1 is supported on both sides on guide elements of this type and on at least one oscillation device 6 per side. Each oscillation device 6 comprises a piston-cylinder drive, control and switching means, e.g., valves, and a hydraulic circuit.<br>
According to Figure 1, a first assembly 7 comprises the guide elements 4 and support members 5. A second assembly 8 comprises the oscillation device 6. In accordance with a special design feature, the second assembly 8 can be dismounted or mounted through a lateral outlet 9 (or inlet) that extends transversely to the plane of symmetry 2 below the guide elements 4 or between guide elements 4. The second dismountable assembly 8 is moved with its cylinder in a laterally directed guideway 9a and can be serviced in a dismounted position, e.g., the cylinder<br><br>
or the piston of the piston-cylinder drive can be changed. Another important feature is that each of the two assemblies can be dismounted and remounted independently of each other with respect to time and location. The first assembly 7 does not need to be removed. Conversely, the entire hydraulic supply circuit of the second assembly 8 can remain in the device and does not need to be opened if maintenance work is being performed only on the first assembly 7.<br>
According to Figure 1, the continuous casting mold 1 with extensions 10 is supported on the first assembly 7. The continuous casting mold 1 does not rest on a mold frame but rather rests directly on the guide elements 4 by its extensions 10.<br>
The guide elements 4, which act as support members 5, are selected as leaf spring assemblies in the illustrated embodiment and are supported centrally between bearing blocks 11 and 12 (Figure 1) .<br><br>

NEW CLAIM 1<br>
1. A device for supporting and oscillating a continuous casting mold (1) for casting molten metal, especially molten steel, where, on each side of a plane of symmetry (2) that contains the central longitudinal axis (3) of the cast strand, the device has:<br>
-- a first assembly, which comprises a guide element (4) that is supported on two stationary support members; and a second assembly (8), which comprises an oscillation device (6) ,<br>
wherein the continuous casting mold (1) is supported on each side of the plane of symmetry (2) on the respective guide element (4) and the respective oscillation device (6) and can be caused to oscillate by means of the oscillation device, wherein<br>
-- on each side of the plane of symmetry (2), the oscillation device (6) can be moved laterally into or out of the first assembly by means of a guideway (9a), which is located below the guide element (4) and extends transversely to the plane of symmetry (2),<br>
-- the guideway (9a) has a T-slot, and<br>
-- at its end facing the guideway (9a), the oscillation device (6) has a flange plate that engages the T-slot.<br><br><br>
together to form a wall frame 20. In this first assembly 7, the support members 5 and the guide elements 4 are viewed as a dismountable unit or assembly 13 in that the bearing blocks 18, 19, which extend parallel to the plane of symmetry 2, and thus the wall frame 20, form an upper support bearing and, with two leaf spring assemblies as guide elements 4, an additional, lower support bearing, which is centrally arranged in each case. The outer mounting bearings for the guide elements 4 are mounted on a cover plate 21 with a support plate 22, and the continuous casting mold 1 is held on these plates by means of guide bars 23.<br>
The bearing blocks 18, 19, which together form the single-piece wall frame 20, are supported and mounted on an intermediate plate 17. The wall frame 20 has openings 20a that provide access to the mold narrow side la.<br>
Below the first assembly 7, which comprises the cover plate 21 and the support plate 22 with guide bars 23 for the continuous casting mold 1, there is a stationary assembly 24, which comprises a base plate 15, support walls 16 and an<br><br>
intermediate plate 17 and is supported on a detachable bearing plate 14 that is stationary on the continuous casting frame. Free spaces 25 for the oscillating movements of the guide elements 4 in the form of leaf springs are provided on both sides on this stationary assembly 24, i.e., on the intermediate plate 17 (cf. Figures 2, 3, and 4).<br>
The stationary assembly 2 4 is mounted on the stationary bearing plate 14 by means of base bolts 26 (Figure 4).<br>
In the illustrated embodiment (Figures 2 to 4) , the oscillation device 6 is supported in the boundary region between the first dismountable assembly 7 and the stationary assembly 24. As a result, when the first assembly 7 has been dismounted, the accessibility to the piston-cylinder drive 6a and the control and switching elements 28 is facilitated to the extent that dismounting of the second dismountable assembly 8 is not always necessary.<br>
According to Figure 4, a stationary mounting structure 29 with cooling water connections 3 0 and 31 is provided on the intermediate plate 17. The cooling water connections 30, 31 are each led to a water connection plate 32, which is mounted on the intermediate plate. If necessary, the entire stationary mounting structure 29 can be detached as an assembly with the<br><br>
stationary base plate 15 and the intermediate plate 17 with the mounting structures 2 9 and can be lifted or set down by crane by means of lifting eyebolts 33.<br><br>
