Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The crystalline polymorph Form I of(-)-4-[4-[4-[4-[[(2R-cis)-5-(2,4-difiuorophenyI) terra hydro-5-(lH-1,2,4-triazol-1-y lmethyl)ruran-3-yl]merhoxy]phenyl]-l-piperazinyl]phenyl-2,4-dihydro-2-[ (S)-l-ethyl-2(S)-hydroxyIpropyl]-3H-l,2,4-triazoI-3-one    provides an antifungal drug having the following advantages compared to its amorphous form in the prior art: lower impurity content and more consistent product quality i.e., more consistent physical characteristics including more consistent color, rate of dissolution and ease of handling; as well as a longer term stability.<br>
The three crystalline polymorphic forms of the compound of formula designated as Form 1, II and HI can readily be distinguished from one another by examination of the characteristic<br>
x-ray Diffraction patterns (see Figures 1-3), the characteristic infrared spectra (see Figures 4-6) and the characteristic Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSL) thermograms (Figures 7-9). Form 1, the most stable form/ did not convert into any other form under normal storage conditions (15°-30°C and protected from light) or under the following stress conditions:<br>
150°C for 2 hours<br>
75°C for 6 weeks<br>
97% relative humidity at ambient temperature for 2 minutes<br>
75% relative humidity at 40°C for 6 weeks<br>
The DSC thermograms shown in Figures 8 and 9indicate that Form II and Form III thermally convert into the more stable Form I at temperatures between 100 and 125°C .The characteristic physico-chemical data of crystalline polymorph Form I of the compound of Formula I are summarized in the following Table.<br><br><br>
All of these advantages inherent in the crystalline polymorph Form I of the compound of this invention would be useful in the development and approval of a pharmaceutical product containing the antifungal drug of formula I.<br>
The crystalline polymorphic form of the compound of Form I may be formed by crystallizing the compound of formula I (as the free base) using a solvent system such as acetonitrile, methanol  in combination with water in a v/v ratio of 1.5:1 tol:1.5, preferably about 1:1; and isopropyl alcohol in combination withwater in a volume/volume (v/v) ratio of 1.5:1 to 1:1.5, preferably about 1:1. The solvent or solvent system were typically healed to reflux and slowly cooled to 60-40°C with agitation and thereafter cooled slowly to room temperature (20°-25°C) or even 0° (with acetonitrile)<br><br>
with continued agitation for 1/2 to 1 hour . The crystalline polymorphic form of the compound of form n may be formed by crystallizing the compound of formula I (as the free base) using a solvent system such as acetone-water in a volume/volume (v/v) ratio of 1.5:1 to 1:1.5, preferably about 1:1., or methylene chloride. The Form III product obtained from methylene chloride also containedsome amorphous form. The solvent or solvent system were typically healed to reflux and slowly cooled without agitation  to room temperature (20°-25°C) The crystalline polymorphic form of the compound of form III may be formed by adding the compound of formula I (as the free base) to a solvent system such as boiling methanol and allowing the resulting solution to cool without agitation to room temperature.<br>

Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain in addition to an anti-fungally effective amount of crystalline polymorph of the compound of formula I as the active ingredient, inert pharma-ceutically acceptable carriers that may be solids or liquids. Solid form compositions include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and<br><br>
suppositories. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluants, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders or tablet disintegration agents; it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active compound. In the tablet the active compound is mixed with carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from about 5 to about 20 percent of the active ingredient.  Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, rragacanth, methycelulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, a low melting wax. cocoa butter and the like. The term "compositions" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, caches are included. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for topical administration. Liquid preparations can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.  Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by adding the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing, sweetening, solubilizing and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can he made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, i.e., natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylceHulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and other well-known suspending agents.<br><br>
Topical formulation useful for nasal or ophthalmic administration are also contemplated. Topical formulation suitable for nasal administration may be solutions or suspensions.  Ophthalmic formulations may be solutions, suspension or ointments.   Ointments usually contain lipophilic carriers such as mineral oil and/or petrolatum. Solution for ophthalmic administration may contain sodium chloride, acid and/or base to adjust the pH as well as purified water and preservatives, which normally contains a non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier may be applied daily to the affected skin until the condition has improved.<br>
The anti-fungally effective amount of the crystalline polymorph of the compound of formula I  for topical administration varies from 0.1 to 20% by weight of the total pharmaceutical composition, which normally contains one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable topical carriers; the pharmaceutical composition may be applied daily to the affected area of the skin until the fungal infection has been irradiated The preferred amount varies from 0.5 to 10% by weight of the total pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The anti-fungally effective amount of the crystalline polymorph of the compound of formula I for oral administration varies from about 1 to 30 mg/day, more preferably about 1 to 20 mg/day and most preferably about 1 to 10 mg/day in single or divided doses.<br>
Parenteral forms to be injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously are usually in the form of a sterile soluon, and may contain salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic.<br>
In general, the parenteral dosage for humans for antifungal use ranges from abou.25 mg per kilogram of body weight per day to about 20 mg kilogram of body weight per day being preferred.<br>
The exact amount, frequency and period of administration of the compound of the present invention for antifungal use will vary, of<br><br>
/<br>
course, depending upon the sex, age and medical condition of the patent as well as the severity of the antifungal infection as determined by the attending clinician.<br>
GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL The compounds of this invention are prepared in accordance with the following Examples using commercially available starting materials.<br>
In solution, no crystalline form exists, and thus the physiochemical solution characteristics, i.e. "H nmr spectra, ultraviolet spectra and specific rotations of the crystalline polymorph and amorphous forms of the compound of formula I are the same.  The "H nmr shown in Figure 10 is consistent with the structure of the compound of formula I. The specific rotation as measured at the D line of sodium at 25°C is -29.4.<br>
