The present Invention relates to novel heterocyclic compounds, to methods for their preparation, to compositions containing them, and to methods and use for clinical treatment of medical conditions which may benefit from immunomodulation, e.g. autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, asthma, transplantation, systemic lupus erythematosis and psoriasis. IVlore particularly the present invention relates to novel heterocyclic compounds, which are CD80 antagonists capable of Inhibiting the interactions between CD80 and CD28, useful for immuno-inhibition.<br>
Background to ttie Invention<br>
The immune system possesses the ability to control the homeostasis between the activation and inactivation of lymphocytes through various regulatory mechanisms during and after an immune response. Among these are mechanisms that specifically inhibit and/or turn off an immune response. Thus, when an antigen is presented by MHC molecules to the T-cell receptor, the T-cells become properly activated only In the presence of additional co-sfimulatory signals. In the absence of these accessory signals there is no lymphocyte activation and either a state of functional Inactivation termed energy or tolerance is induced, or the T-cell is specifically deleted by apoptosis.<br>
One such co-stimulatory signal involves interaction of CD80 on specialised antigen-presenting cells with CD28 on T-cells, and this signal has been demonstrated to be essential for full T-cell activation. {Lenschow e^ al. (1996) Annu. Rev. Immunol., 14, 233-258). It would therefore be desirable to provide compounds which inhibit this CD80/CD28 interaction.<br>

Results<br>
The use of BIAcore biomolecular interaction analysis<br>
Biotinylated human CDBO (hCD80-BT) is a recombinant soluble form of a membrane bound receptor molecule (CD80) which binds to CD28 to initiate T cell activation. The interaction between CD80 and CD28 has been extensively investigated (Collins et al, 2002). Biotinlyated human HLA-A2-tax is the recombinant soluble form of a membrane bound receptor molecule that has been used in this example as a control protein, and is not expected to interact with the compounds.<br>
The BIAcore S51™ system was used for screening the compounds of Examples 1 -4 above. A series S sensor chip CMS was docked onto the BIAcore S51™. Streptavidin was coupled to the carboxymethyi surface using standard amine coupling. The chip surface was activated with 0.2M EDC / 0.05M NHS, followed by binding of streptavidin (0.25 mg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0) and saturation of unoccupied sites with 1 M ethylenediamine.<br><br>
The BIAcore S51 sensor chip has two separate sensor spots for immobilisation of proteins. liCDSO-BT was immobilised on the streptavidin-coated surface of one sensor spot until a response of approximately 3000 RU was observed. A protein to control for non-specific binding of the compound was immobilised on a second sensor spot. The control protein used for these experiments was a biotinylated, soluble form of the human HLA protein.<br>
DMion series of compounds (lOOOnM - 0.05nM) were prepared in running buffer (10 miVl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCI, 0.005% P20; 5% DMSO).<br>
BIAcore S51™ was run at a flow rate of 30 pl/min using running buffer. Compounds and DMSO standard solutions for correction of data for solvent effects were injected. Data were recorded automatically and were analysed using BIAcore S51 Evaluation software.<br>
The interaction between CD80 and the endogenous protein Iigand (CD28) Is highly specific, but relatively weak, with a KD of 4750 nM, and an off-rate of greater than 0.2 s"^ The compounds of Examples 2,3,4,6,7 have greater affinity and longer residence times on CD80 than CD28, having KDS of less than lOOnM, and off-rates of 2x10"^, indicating that the cinnolines will be able to compete effectively with the endogenous Iigand. The cinnolines showed no detectable interaction with the control protein.<br>

Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence Assay<br>
The examples described above were tested in a cell free Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) assay to detennine their activity as inhibitors of the CD80-CD28 Interaction.<br>
In the assay, europium and allophycocyanin (APC) are associated with CD28 and CD80 indirectly {through antibody linkers) to form a complex, which brings the europium and APC into close proximity to generate a signal. The complex comprises the following six proteins: fluorescent label 1, linker antibody 1, CD28 fusion protein, CD80 fusion protein, linker antibody 2, and fluorescent label 2.
