				<td>The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing bulk monolith of Carbon sub sixty fullerene(C6o)-glassf composite useful in device applications as nonlinear optical medium and optical limiter<br>
Fullerenes are a class of recently discovered closed shell carbon molecules having ditlerent optical and opto-electronic properties. Amongst the various homologues of the series which may consist of carbon atoms ranging in number 'from 20 to 980 and even more (Science of Fullerene and carbon nanotudes - M.S. Dresselhaus et al, Academic Press, 1996), the most stable and widely investigated molecules are carbon sub sixty and carbon sub seventy fullerenes. Structurally, C. sub sixty &amp; C. sub seventy have similarity in the sense, they are similar to those of linear quasi-one-dimensional conducting polymers, such as poly-acetylene. This is due to the presence of extended network of conjugated delocalized pi-electrons which are distributed over the spherical fullerene surface. These new compounds have a wide variety of remarkable properties. As in the case with many conjugated polymers, the electrical conductivity of C. sub sixty &amp; C. sub seventy can be varied to make them insulators, semi conducting and even super conducting by controlled n-type doping.<br>
Tutt &amp; Kost (US Patent No.5, 172, 278 dated Dec 15, 1992 ) have first shown that both C.<br>
sub sixty and C. sub seventy fullerene solutions can be used as an optical limiter, transparent to low intensity light but nearly opaque above a critical intensity. It has been shown further, (N. S. Sariciftci, A. J. Heeger, in US Patent No.533183) that fullerenes C. sub sixty and C. sub seventy may be made technologically useful as photoconducting film by incorporating them into suitable organic conducting polymer. However, one of the major difficulties in using fullerenes for all such applications is that they are unstable under ambient environmental condition. Oxygen and water in presence of light are known to react with fullerenes. It is therefore, necessary to encase these materials in an inert host while fabrication of a device using fullerene is considered. Thus incorporation of fullerenes in suitable glass matrix should be of immense benefit as far as various applications like optical limiter and non linear optical medium, photoconductor are concerned. Lui a drawback of use of fullerene-organic polymer composite film is that fullerene is not fully protected from environmental degradation.<br><br>
, Many workers all over the world therefore, tried to develop C. sub sixty and C. sub seventy fullerene-glass composites. There are number of reports of experiment on encasing fullerene C. sub sixty and C. sub seventy in glassy hosts with limited success. In most these cases, however, fullerene was tried to encase in silica host by sol-gel methods, e.g. methods described by R. B. Mattes et al in US Patent No. 5,420,081 dated May 30, 1995 and by Sheng Dai et al in J. of Am Cer. Soc. 75 (1992) 2865. In all these cases, preparation of thin films of dimensions not larger than 13-15 mm x 0.5 mm having clusters of C. Sub sixty fullerene distributed in the host were reported. In some cases, certain derivatives of fullerene have been used to prepare thin plate of silica-C. sub sixty fullerene composite by sol gel method for application as optical limiter (R. Signorini et al SPIE vol. 2854, page 130). In all these cases, C. sub sixty fullerene is not totally protected from the environmental degradation by the water associated with the hosts. F. Lin et al reported [Appl. Phys. Lett. 65 (1994) 2522] preparation of C. sub sixty fullerene doped phosphate glass by melting in a sealed device. S. Mao et al Chinese Patent No. 93112519.7, (1993)] The main drawbacks of the existing methods are as follows:<br>
1)	Drawback of the sol-gel method is that Fullerenes are not totally protected from<br>
environmental degradation in the resulting composites.<br>
2)	The drawback of the Chinese method is that they used a methud of melting in a sealed device<br>
to prevent oxidation and escape of fullerene at high temperature; hence the method is not<br>
suitable for commercial exploitation for preparing bulk monolith.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing bulk monolith of carbon sub sixty fullerene-glass composite useful in device applications as nonlinear optical medium and optical limiter.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing C. sub sixty fullerene - glass composite having C. sub sixty fullerene homogeneously dispersed in the host.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing bulk monolith of the C. sub sixty fullerene - glass composite in the size of relatively large dimensions suitable for different device applications.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing bulk monolith of C. sub sixty fullerene-glass composite which can effectively prevent oxidation and escape of fullerene with the increase of temperature and at the same time simple and versatile for commercial exploitation.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for preparing transparent monolithic glass of carbon sub sixty fullerene - glass composite , said process characterized in that heating at a temperature range of 400-900° C a weather resistant glass composition , having melting point below 800 ° C to obtain a solid mass , crushing the solid mass into granules/powder , adding carbon sub sixty fullerene to the granules/powder in the range of 0.05-0.1 overall wt% , mixing the two intimately , heat treating the mixture in a carbon crucible at a temperature ranging 350 -390 ° C under vacuum , melting the mixture at a temperature in the range of 600-800° C under inert gas atmosphere as described herein , cooling the melt to get desired transparent monolithic glass. In an embodiment of the present invention the glass composition used may be such as 0-50 mole% of phosphorous pentoxide (P205), 0-40 mole% of boron oxide (B203) , 0-30 mole% of bismuth oxide (Bi203), 0-1 mole% of silicon dioxide (Si02), 0-1 mole% of aluminium oxide (AI2O3), 10-45.5 mole% of zinc oxide (ZnO), 10-40 mole% of lead oxide (PbO), 0-0.1 mole % of tin dioxide (Sn02), adding to the mixture 0-5 mole % M20 where M = Na, K, Li.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the phosphorous pentoxide used may be<br>
taken either as it is or in the form of compounds such as ammonium dihydrogen<br>
phosphate, diammonium hydrogen phosphate, phosphoric acid.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the boron oxide used may be taken as<br>
compounds such as boric acid, sodium metaborate.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the lead oxide used is taken form lead<br>
carbonate, red lead.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the bismuth oxide used may be either as<br>
it is or substituted by compounds selected from bismuth nitrate, bismuth chloride, bismuth<br>
hydroxide.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the alkali metal oxide ( M20 , M= Na,<br>
K, Li) used may be taken in the form of respective carbonates. In another embodiment of the present invention the inert gases used may be Helium,<br>
Nitrogen, Argon , or a mixture thereof.<br>

monolith of C. sub sixty fullerene -glass composite which is effective in<br>
homogeneous incorporation of fullerene without environmental degradation<br>
and is suitable for commercial exploitation.<br>
The above novel feature has been obtained through the following inventive<br>
steps:<br>
