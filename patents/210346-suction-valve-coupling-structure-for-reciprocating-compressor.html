				<td>SUCTION VALVE COUPLING STRUCTURE FOR RECIPROCATING COMPRESSOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor and particularly to a suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor, in which the suction valve for opening and closing a gas flow passage is firmly coupled and the coupling structure is simplified, thereby minimizing a dead volume.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, a compressor is a device for compressing a fluid such as air and refrigerant gas. The compressor includes a motor unit installed in the hermetic container for generating driving force, and a compression unit for sucking and compressing gas by receiving the-driving force of the motor unit. In the compressor, if a power source is applied to generate the driving force in the motor unit, the driving force is transmitted to the compression unit, thereby sucking, compressing, and discharging gas in the compression unit.<br>
A reciprocating compressor is a device, in which a piston is coupled to an amateur of a reciprocating motor as a unit without a crank axis. Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the conventional reciprocating compressor.<br>
As shown in  Figure  1, the conventional reciprocating compressor comprises a ring shaped frame 1 supported by an elastic supporting member<br>
(not shown) in a casing V; a cylindrical cover 2 fixed at one side surface of<br>
1<br><br>
the frame 1; a cylinder 3 fixed as a horizontal direction in the middle of the frame 1; an inner stator assembly 4A fixed at an outer circumference surface of an inner side of the frame 1 supporting the cylinder 3, and an outer stator assembly 4B fixed at an inner circumference surface of an outer side of the frame  1  apart from the outer circumference surface of the inner stator assembly 4A with a predetermined air-gap; an amateur 5 inserted in the gap between the inner stator assembly 4A and the outer stator assembly 4B for consisting of the amateur of the reciprocating compressor; a piston 6 fixed to the amateur 5 as a unit for sucking and compressing refrigerant gas by having a slidable movement at the inner portion of the cylinder 3; an inner resonant spring 7A supported at one side surface of the frame 1 and at an inner side of the amateur 5 unified with the piston 6 for having a resonant movement; an outer resonant spring 7B supported at an inner side surface of the cover 2 and at an outer side of the amateur 5 unified with the piston 6 for having a resonant movement; and a discharge valve assembly 8 mounted at an end portion of a discharge side of the cylinder 3 for limiting a discharge of the compressed gas at the time when the piston 6 reciprocates.<br>
Unexplained reference numeral 8a denotes a discharge valve, 8b denotes a spring for supporting the discharge valve, 8c denotes a discharge cover, SP denotes a suction pipe, and DP denotes a discharge pipe.<br>
The conventional reciprocating compressor is operated as followings.<br>
That is, if an electric current is applied to the inner and outer stator assemblies 4A and 4B and the movable 5 has a linear reciprocation, the<br>
piston 6 coupled to the amateur 5 linearly reciprocates in the cylinder 3,<br>
2<br><br>
thereby generating a pressure difference in the cylinder 3. By the pressure difference, refrigerant gas in the casing V is sucked in the cylinder through a refrigerant flow passage F of the piston 6, compressed, and discharged, which is repeated.<br>
In the meantime, Figure 2 is a perspective view showing a suction vaive coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor in accordance with the conventional art, and Figure 3 is a sectional view showing a suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor in accordance with the conventional art,<br>
As depicted, a suction valve 9 for limiting a suction of refrigerant gas which passed through the refrigerant flow passage F and a refrigerant suction hole 6e is fixed to a frontal surface of a head portion 6b of the piston 6 by a fixation bolt B.<br>
Also, the suction valve 9 is formed as a thin disc plate corresponding to an end portion surface S of the head portion 6b of the piston 6.<br>
A cut-off 9c of an opened curve line shape is formed in the disc plate, and has a shape of a question mark, in which the disc plate is divided into a circle shaped part and a ring shaped part.<br>
 The circle shaped part constitutes a fixation portion 9d coupled to the head portion 6b of the piston 6, and the ring shaped part corresponding to an outer portion of the circle shaped part constitutes an open/close portion 9a for opening and closing the refrigerant suction hoie 6e. In the meantime, the suction valve 9 is made from high carbon spring steel which is generally used,<br>
 and  the  piston  6  is  made from  cast iron  having  an  excellent  foundry<br>
3<br><br>
characteristic.<br>
A structure for coupling the suction valve 9 to the piston 6 is as fallowings. First, a screw hole 6d is formed in the middle of the end portion surface S of the head portion 6b of the piston 6, and a through hole 9b for coupling the valve is formed at the fixation portion 9d of the suction valve 9. Then, under a state that the through hole 9b of the suction valve 9 and the screw hole 6d of the piston 6 are .unified, the suction valve 9 is coupled to the piston 6 by inserting the fixation bolt B.<br>
However, in the conventional suction valve coupling structure, since the suction valve 9 formed as a thin plate is coupled by the fixation bolt B, the fixation bolt is minutely loosened in a process that the suction valve 9 is repeatedly opened and closed, which causes a siip rotation of the suction valve 9. According to this, the suction valve deviates from the refrigerant suction hole 6e, thereby lowering a reliability of the compressor.<br>
Also, since a head portion of the fixation bolt B is protruded at an inner portion of the compression space P, a dead volume is generated. According to this, not only compression efficiency is lowered, but also a precise location sensing of an upper dead point and a lower dead point of the piston 6 is not possible by the protruded head portion of the fixation portion B, thereby having a problem to control a stroke for a reciprocal movement of the piston<br>

KR1998-2840A discloses a compression part structure for a linear compressor. In the conventional art, since a flange and a cylinder are separately formed from each other, a mechanical tolerance occurs at the time of fabricating components and coupling the components to each other. Since cores of an inner lamination have to be laminated under a state that a core liner has been thermally fixed to the flange, an assembly process is complicated and a mass production is not easily obtained. When the flange is mal-operated, both the core linear and the inner lamination deposited on the core linear and the inner lamination deposited on the core liner are not used, thereby not effectively utilizing the components. In the invention according to KR1998-2840A, a flange and a cylinder are integrally formed, and an inner lamination is constructed to be coupled thereto as an additional component. As the result, a mechanical tolerance due to a process tolerance or an assembly tolerance is minimized, and cores constituting the inner lamination are easily laminated, thereby facilitating a massive production. Furthermore, since a lamination bed to which the inner lamination is coupled and a flange assembly having a flange portion are formed as additional components, the components can be efficiently utilized at the time of a mal-function occurrence.<br>
TECHNICAL GIST OF THE PESENT INVENTION Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a suction<br>

vaive coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor, in which the suction valve for opening and closing a gas flow passage is firmly coupled and the coupling structure is simplified, thereby minimizing a dead volume.<br>

MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 4 is a sectional view showing a first preferred embodiment of the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention. Referring to Figure 4, a refrigerant flow passage F for circulating refrigerant gas is formed to penetrate an inner portion of the piston 10 inserted in the cylinder 3, and a plurality of refrigerant suction holes 6e are formed at the end portion surface S of the piston head portion 10b in the piston 10.<br>
A suction valve 20 for opening and closing the refrigerant suction holes 6e is directly connected to the piston 10 by welding. At this time, the suction valve 20 is formed as a thin disc plate having an area corresponding to the end portion surface S of the piston 10.<br>
The welding preferably includes a resistance spot welding, a laser<br>
8<br><br>
welding, and a tig welding. An unexplained reference numeral W denotes a welding point.<br>
Figure 5 shows a modification example of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figure 5, a reception recess 30 having a predetermined size is formed at the piston which reciprocates linearly in the cylinder 3 by receiving driving force of the motor unit and has a refrigerant flow passage F for introducing refrigerant gas therein. The reception recess 30 is formed as a recess form having a predetermined depth and an inner diameter. Also, an insertion member 40 having an excellent welding characteristic is fixed to an inner portion of the reception recess 30.<br>
The insertion member 40 having an excellent welding characteristic is formed correspondingly to a shape of the reception recess 30, and preferably made from low carbon steel and stainless steel.<br>
At this time, the insertion member 40 is fixed to an inner portion of the reception recess 30 by brazing. The suction valve 20 for opening and closing the refrigerant flow passage F is connected to the insertion member 40 by welding.<br>
The  suction valve  20  is formed  as  a thin  plate  having  an  area corresponding to the end portion surface S of the piston 10, and the welding between the insertion member 40 and the suction valve 20 preferably includes a resistance spot welding, a laser welding, and a tig welding.<br>
In the structure, a welding intensity of the suction valve 20 is enhanced<br>
by welding the suction valve 20 with the insertion member 40 having an<br>
9<br><br>
excellent welding characteristic,<br>
In the meantime, Figure 6 shows another modification example of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figure 6, a reception recess 50 having a predetermined size is formed at the piston 10 which has a linear reciprocation in the cylinder 3 by receiving driving force of the motor unit and having a refrigerant flow passage F for introducing refrigerant gas therein.<br>
Then, a welding material 60 having an excelfent welding characteristic is directly welded to the reception recess 50 of the piston 10, so that the welding material 60 is melted and fills the reception recess 50. The welding material 60 is preferably Ni-based groups.<br>
Then, the suction valve 20 for opening and closing the refrigerant flow passage F of the piston 10 is welded with the welding material 60 which fills the reception recess 50.<br>
The suction valve 20 is formed  as a thin  plate having an  area corresponding to the end portion surface S of the piston 10, and the welding between the insertion member 40 and the suction valve 20 preferably includes a resistance spot welding, a laser welding, and a tig welding.<br>
In the structure, a welding intensity of the suction valve 20 is enhanced by welding the suction valve 20 with the welding material 60 having an excellent welding characteristic.<br>
Hereinafter, operations and effects of the first preferred embodiment of the suction  valve coupling structure for a  reciprocating  compressor<br>
according to the present invention will be explained.<br>
10<br><br>
First, if driving force of the motor unit is transmitted to the piston 10, and the piston 10 has a linear reciprocation in the cylinder 3, refrigerant gas is sucked in the compression space P of the cylinder 3 through the refrigerant flow passage F formed at an end portion of the piston 10, compressed, and discharged by opening and closing of the discharge valve 8a which constitutes a discharge valve assembly 8, which is repeated.<br>
In said process, since the suction valve 40 for opening and closing the refrigerant flow passage F is coupled to the piston 10 by welding, the coupling state is firm and a slip rotation is not generated even in a process that the suction valve 20 is repeatedly opened and closed, thereby having an excellent ¦ compression performance,<br>
. Also, since the suction valve 20 does not have a protruded portion toward an outer side thereof and is simplified as a flat state, not only a dead volume of the compression space P is excluded, but also a precise location sensing of sn upper dead point and a lower dead point of the piston 10 is possible, thereby controlling a stroke easily for a reciprocal movement of the piston 10.<br>
Hereinafter, the second preferred embodiment of the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention will be explained with reference to the preferred embodiment illustrated in the attached drawings.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 are perspective and longitudinal section views showing a second  preferred embodiment of the suction  valve coupling<br>
structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention,<br>
11<br><br>
and Figures 9 and 10 are frontal views showing another locations of a welding portion of the second preferred embodiment of the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention.<br>
As shown, in the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention, the suction valve is arranged to an end portion surface of the piston 110 which is coupled to the amateur 5 of the reciprocating motor and slidably inserted in the cylinder 3, thereby welding a lateral section surface of the suction valve 120 for opening and closing the refrigerant flow passage F of the piston 110 to a corresponding side of the piston by a laser welding or an electron beam welding which do not generate arc. According to this, parts which receive heat influence of the welding  are   minimized,   and   a  protrusion  by  the  welding   scale   is   not generated.<br>
The piston 110 includes a body portion 111 having a predetermined length, a head portion 112 at a forward side of the body portion 111, a ponnection portion 113 connected to the amateur 5 at a rear side of the body portion 111, and a refrigerant flow passage F formed in the middle of the body portion 111 and at one side of the head portion 112 for guiding refrigerant gas into the cylinder 3.<br>
A welding material insertion recess 112a for forcibly inserting welding rnaterial M which will be explained later is formed in the middle of the head portion 112 to weld the suction valve 120. Also, a plurality of refrigerant suction holes 6e (three holes in drawing) are formed at an edge of the head<br>
portion 112.<br>
12<br><br>
The welding material M is preferably formed with material which makes . the suction vaive 120 of strong elasticity material be smoothly welded.<br>
Also, a cut-off 123 of the suction valve 120 is formed as a question mark shape, and an open/close portion 121 thereof is oppositely arranged to open and close the refrigerant suction holes 6e of the head portion 112. A welding hole 122a corresponding to an end portion surface of the welding material M is formed at a fixation portion 122 located at a center of the suction valve.<br>
As shown in Figure 9, the welding hole 122a is formed as a disc shape, thereby welding an inner circumference surface thereof to the end portion surface of the welding material M, or, as shown in Figure 10, the welding hole 122a is formed as a rectangular slit shape, thereby welding an inner section surface thereof to the end portion surface of the welding material M.<br>
An unexplained reference numeral W denotes a welding portion. The  second  preferred  embodiment of. the  suction  valve  coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention has the foliowing operation effects.<br>
That is, if a power source is applied to the reciprocating motor and the amateur 5 has a linear reciprocation, the piston 110 coupled to the amateur 5 linearly reciprocates in the cylinder 3, thereby sucking refrigerant gas in the hermetic container V, compressing and discharging, which is repeated.<br>
At this time, when the piston 10 reciprocates, if the piston 110 has a<br>
forward movement to compress the refrigerant gas sucked in the cylinder 3,<br>
13<br><br>
the refrigerant gas in the compression space of the cylinder 3 is gradually compressed as a volume of the compression  space  narrows,  and  if a pressure of the compression space is above a predetermined value, the refrigerant gas is discharged by pushing the discharge valve 8a which shields a discharge side of the compression space. At this time, a stroke distance of the piston 10 can be set not to generate a dead volume between the suction valve 120 and the corresponding discharge valve 8a by coupling the suction valve 120 located at the end portion surface of the piston 10 to the piston 110 by welding.<br>
Also, the welding material M having an excellent welding characteristic to the suction valve 120 is forcibly inserted to the end portion surface of the piston 110, so that the welding material M is welded to the suction valve 120, thereby increasing the welding characteristic. Also, since a lateral section surface of the suction valve 120 is welded to the end portion surface of the piston 110 or the end portion surface of the welding material M, coupling force of the two members is divided into a vertical direction and a horizontal direction, thereby having greater resistance in opening and closing the suction valve 120 as onedirection, minimizing influence by welding heat, and not generating a protrusion by the welding scale.<br>
In   the   meantime,    the   second   preferred   embodiment   of   the reciprocating compressor according to the present invention has modification examples in case of the followings,<br>
That is, in the aforementioned preferred embodiment, an additional<br>
welding hole 122a of a circular shape or a rectangular slit shape is formed at<br>
14<br><br>
the fixation portion 122 of the suction valve 120, so that a lateral section surface of the welding hole 122a is welded to the welding material M forcibly inserted to the piston 110. However, in the modification example, as shown in Figure 11, a lateral section surface of the cut-off 123 for cutting the suction valve 120 to classify into the open/close portion 121 and the fixation portion 122 can be welded to the welding material M of the piston 110, or an outer circumference surface of the suction valve 120 can be welded to an outer circumference surface of the piston 110 parallel thereto without forming an additional welding hole.<br>
In said case, an additional welding hole need not to be formed, and a welding coupling force is increased by having the two welding portions.<br>
Hereinafter, the third preferred embodiment of the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention will be explained with reference to the preferred embodiment illustrated in the attached drawings.<br>
Figure 12 is a disassembled perspective view showing one preferred embodiment of the piston of the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention, Figure 13 is an assembled longitudinal section view showing the one preferred embodiment of the piston of the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention, and Figure 14 is a longitudinal section view showing a process that a welding member is welded to the piston.<br>
As shown, the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating<br>
15<br><br>
compressor according to the present invention comprises a piston 211 coupled to the amateur of the reciprocating motor (not shown) and slidably inserted to the cylinder 3 for sucking refrigerant gas in the compression space of the cylinder 3, compressing, and discharging; a suction valve 212 mounted at an end portion surface of the piston 211 for opening and closing the refrigerant flow passage F of the piston 211; and a welding member 213 inserted   between  the  end   portion  surface  of the  piston   211   and  the corresponding suction valve 212 and mounted at the end portion surface of the piston 211 to enhance a welding characteristic of the suction valve 212. The piston 211 is generally made of cast iron and provided with a welding member mounting recess 211a for inserting the welding member 213 at a center of the end portion surface thereof. A diameter of the welding member mounting recess 211a is formed to be larger than that of the welding member 213, so that a leaden metal 214 which will be later explained may be inserted between the welding member mounting recess 211a and the welding member 213.<br>
A diameter of the welding member mounting recess 211a becomes larger toward an outer portion contacted with the atmosphere from an inner portion thereof. As shown in Figures 13 and 14, the welding member mounting recess 211a can be formed as an extended surface 211b chamfered to extend an outer edge thereof, or as shown in Figure 15, the welding member mounting recess 221a can be formed as an extended surface 221b of a sectional shape of a trapezoid-<br>
The welding member 213 is formed by stainless having a melting point<br>
16<br><br>
¦higher than the leaden metal 214, and welded to the welding member mounting recesses 211a and 221a by the leaden metal 214.<br>
Unexplained reference numerals G, 6e, and W respectively denote bubble, refrigerant suction holes, and a welding point.<br>
Hereinafter, a process for fixing the suction valve to the piston of the reciprocating compressor will be explained.<br>
First, the welding member 213 is inserted to the welding member<br>
mounting recess 211a formed at the end portion surface of the piston 211,<br>
and the leaden metal 214 is inserted between the welding member mounting<br>
recess 211a and the welding member 213, then the leaden metal is heated<br>
with a temperature higher than the melting point of the leaden metal 214 so<br>
as to weld the piston 211 and the welding member 213, so that the leaden<br>
metal 214 melts and permeates between the piston 211 and the welding<br>
member 213, thereby reacting the piston 211 with the welding member 213<br>
and cooling them after a predetermined time. According to this, the leaden<br>
metal 214 is hardened again and the two members 211 and 213 are welded<br>
to each other.<br>
Subsequently, the suction valve 212 corresponds to the end portion surface of the piston 211, and the fixation portion (not shown) of the suction valve 212 is welded to the end portion surface of the welding member 213, thereby completing to fix the suction valve 212.<br>
At this time, bubble is generated as the leaden metal 214 melts by being heated, and the bubble is exhausted to a side contacted with the<br>
atmosphere in which density is relatively low. As shown in Figure 14, the<br>
17<br><br>
bubble is more formed toward the atmosphere side above the welding member mounting recess 211a, so that the leaden metal has a density difference between upper and lower portions. According to this, the bubble G generated at the time when the leaden metal 214 melts is fast exhausted to the atmosphere, so that the bubble G scarcely remains between the piston 211 and the welding member 213, thereby reducing an occurrence rate and a size of a pore in a welding surface between the piston 211 and the welding member 213.<br>
In the meantime, even if the welding member mounting recess 221a formed at the end portion surface of the piston 221 is formed'as a trapezoid shape, the assembly processes and the operation effects are same.<br>
The third preferred embodiment of the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention has the following effects.<br>
in said process, a dead volume between the suction valve and the corresponding discharge valve is removed, and the suction valve is firmly fixed to the piston, so that a slip phenomenon of the suction valve is prevented, thereby increasing a reliability of the compressor.<br>
Also, when the leaden metal for welding the welding member to the piston melts, the bubble generated in the leaden metal is exhausted to the atmosphere, so that amount and a size of the bubble which remains after the welding at the leaden metal and the piston or at the welding surface of the leaden   metal   and   the   welding  member  are  greatly  reduced,   thereby<br>
preventing lowering of the welding intensity.<br>
18<br><br>
Also, a minute crack generated when a volume of the bubble expands by high temperature at the time of driving the piston is prevented, and corrosion of the piston and the welding member is prevented by controlling a transposition due to a concentration difference caused by the density difference between each pore.<br>
Hereinafter, the fourth preferred embodiment of the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention will be explained with reference to the preferred embodiment illustrated in the attached drawings.<br>
Figure 16 is a disassembled perspective view showing an,example of the piston of the reciprocating compressor according to the present invention, Figure 17 is an assembled longitudinal section view showing the example of the piston, and Figure 18 is a longitudinal section view showing a process thai a welding member is welded to the piston.<br>
As   shown,   the coupling   suction   valve   coupling   structure   for   a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention comprises a piston 311 coupled to an amateur of the reciprocating motor (not shown) and slidably  inserted   to  the  cylinder  3   for  sucking   refrigerant  gas   in   the compression space of the cylinder 3, compressing, and discharging; a suction valve 312 mounted at an end portion surface of the piston 311 for opening and closing a refrigerant flow passage F of the piston 311; and a welding member 313 inserted between the end portion surface of the piston 311 and the corresponding suction valve 312 and mounted at the end portion surface<br>
of the piston 311 to enhance a welding characteristic of the suction valve 312,<br>
19<br><br>
The piston 311 is generally made of cast iron and provided with a welding member mounting recess 313a for inserting the welding member 31 3 at a center of the end portion surface thereof, A diameter of the weiding member mounting recess 313a is formed to be larger than that of the welding member 313, so that a leaden metal 314 which will be later explained may be inserted between the welding member mounting recess 313a and the welding member 313.<br>
The welding member mounting recess 311a has a same diameter from an inner portion thereof to an outer portion contacted with the atmosphere. However, as shown in Figure 19, it is also possible to form a plurality of channels 311b engraved in intaglio from inside to outside of the inner circumference surface.<br>
The welding member 313 is formed by stainless having a melting point higher than the leaden metal 314, and provided with a port 313a at a center thereof which is formed to penetrate from an inner portion of the welding member mounting recess 311a to an outer portion.<br>
An outer diameter of the port 313a contacted to the atmosphere is formed to be larger than an inner diameter of the welding member mounting recess 311a.<br>
Unexplained reference numerals G, 6e, and W respectively denote bubble, refrigerant suction holes, and a weiding point<br>
Hereinafter, a process for fixing the suction valve to the piston of the reciprocating compressor will be explained.<br>
First, the welding member 313 is inserted to the welding member<br>
20<br><br>
mounting recess 311a formed at the end portion surface of the piston 311, and the leaden metal 314 is inserted between the welding member mounting recess 311a and the welding member 313, then the leaden metal 314 is heated with a temperature higher than a melting point of the leaden metal 314 so as to weld the piston 311 and the welding member 313, so that the leaden metal 314 melts and permeates between the piston 311 and the welding member 313, thereby reacting the piston 311 with the welding member 313 metallically and cooling them after a predetermined time. According to this, the leaden metal 314 is again hardened and the two members 311 and 313 are welded to each other,<br>
Subsequently, the suction valve 312 corresponds to the end portion surface of the piston 311, and the fixation portion (not shown) of the suction valve 312 is welded to the end portion surface of the welding member 313, thereby completing to fix the suction valve 312<br>
At this time, as shown in Figure 18, bubbfe is generated as the leaden metal-314 melts by being heated, and the bubble is exhausted to a side contacted with the atmosphere in which density is relatively low. At this time, since the port 313a is formed at a center of the welding member 313, the bubble G generated at the time when the leaden metal 314 melts is fast exhausted to the atmosphere through the port 313a.<br>
Especially, sines a diameter of the port 313a is larger towards the atmosphere, the density difference between upper and lower portions of the leaden metal 314 becomes greater, thereby exhausting the bubble G to the<br>
atmosphere more faster.<br>
21<br><br>
Also, as shown in Figures 19 and 20, in case that the channel 311 b is additionally formed at the welding member mounting recess 311a of the piston 311, the bubble G is exhausted to the channel 311b of the piston 311 as well as the port 313a of the welding member 313, thereby removing the bubble much faster.<br>
The fourth preferred embodiment of the suction valve coupling structure for a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention has the following effects.<br>
A dead volume between the suction vaive and the corresponding discharge valve is removed, and the suction valve is firmly fixed to the piston, so that a  slip  phenomenon of the suction valve  is  prevented,  thereby increasing a reliability of the compressor.<br>
Also, when the leaden metal for welding the welding member to the piston melts, the bubble generated in the leaden meta! is exhausted to the atmosphere, so that amount and a size of the bubble which remains after the welding at the leaden metal and the piston or at the welding surface of the leaden metal and the welding member are greatly reduced, thereby preventing lowering of the welding intensity.<br>
Also, a minute crack generated when a volume of the bubble expands by high temperature at the time of driving the piston is prevented, and corrosion of the piston and the welding member is prevented by controlling a transposition due to a concentration difference caused by the density difference between each pore.<br>
