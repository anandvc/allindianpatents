In the application no. Hei 7-66249, when the ignition system with the anti-theft feature is installed in a battery less vehicle without making any modification therein a vehicle engine is intermittently activated by using a rectified output of a regular through rectifying a generated output of an AC generator. It is necessary to match a voltage determining output for the anti-theft feature and pulse signal generating timing of a pulse coil with a phase of the rectified output of the regulator. This means that a dedicated AC generator is required for the anti-theft<br>
feature and that layout of the vehicle engine has to be changed, etc. This makes it difficult for these components to be used in normal circumstances.<br>
Further, a battery for a small vehicle such as a motorcycle has a relatively small capacity. Even when the battery is dead after it is not in use for a long time, and so on, measures have to be taken in order to activate the vehicle engine by kick-starting or pushing the vehicle.<br>

[Description of Embodiment]<br>
The present invention will be described with reference to an embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a main part of an ignition control system 1 according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the ignition control system 1 comprises a reference voltage -generating means 16 and an ignition controller 2.<br>
The ignition controller 2 comprises a voltage determining means 17 and a control means 18.<br>
An AC generating means 10, a regulator 11, a main switch 12, a DC load 14, and an ignition coil 15 are arranged around the ignition control system 1. [0017]<br>
A charging coil 10A of the AC generator 10 generates AC power in response to the rotation .of a vehicle engine.<br>
Generally, the AC generator 10 has several poles (e.g., a single phase and 8 poles ), so that the charging coil 10A generates the AC power for operating the vehicle engine in the pole number/2 cycles per rotation thereof (for example, four cycles if there are 8 poles). [0018]<br>
A pulse coil 10B of the AC generator 10 produces one pulse signal Sp per rotation of the vehicle engine.<br>
The regulator 11 rectifies a generated output Va of the charging coil 10A, and outputs a rectified output Vb to the reference voltage generating means 16 of the ignition control system 1 via the main switch 12. [0019]<br>
The reference voltage generating means 16 generates a reference voltage Vr using the rectified output Vb, and outputs the reference voltage Vr to the voltage determining means 17.<br>
The reference voltage generating means 16 cannot generate the reference voltage Vr having a predetermined range when the rectified output Vb of the regulator is insufficient. [0020]<br>
The voltage determining means 17 checks whether or not the reference voltage Vr is in the predetermined range each time the regulator 11 supplies the rectified output Vb. When the reference voltage Vr is not in the predetermined range, the voltage determining means -17 produces a determination signal S17 by integrating determination signals indicative of ignition suspension, and outputs the determination signal S17 to the control means 18.<br>
When the reference voltage Vr is determined to be in the predetermined range, the voltage determining means 17 compares it with the rectified output Vb in order to determine whether or not the rectified output Vb is equal to or larger than the reference voltage Vr.  If not, the voltage determining means 17 provides the.control means 18 with the determination signal S17 which is produced by integrating the determination signals indicative of the ignition suspension.<br>
When the reference voltage Vr is in the predetermined range and when the rectified output Vb is equal to or larger than the reference voltage Vr, the voltage determining means 17 provides the control means 18 with the determination signal S17 which is produced by integrating determination signals indicative of allowance of ignition. [0021]<br>
Even when the pulse signal Sb is input from the pulse coil 10B, the control means 18 does not output an ignition signal S18 to the ignition coil 15 if the determination signal S17 from the voltage determining means 17 has a level lower than a predetermined level.<br>
On the contrary, when the determination signal S17 has a level equal to or larger than the predetermined level, the control means 18 outputs the ignition signal S18 to the ignition coil 15 in response to the pulse signal Sp from the pulse coil 10B. [0022]<br>
The ignition coil 15 ignites the vehicle engine in response to the ignition signal S18 from the control means 18. [0023]<br>
The ignition control system 1 comprises the reference voltage generating means 16, voltage determining means 17 and control means 18, so that the voltage determining means 17 can determine the voltage with—improved reliability. Further, it is not necessary to match the pulse signal generating timing of the pulse coil with the phase of the generated output of the AC generator. Components can therefore be<br>
applied to common use and the invention can provide an economical ignition control system which is applicable to a vehicle without a battery and has an anti-theft feature. [0024]<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a main part of an ignition control system 3 according to the .present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the ignition control system 3 comprises a reference voltage generating means 21 and an ignition controller 4.<br>
The ignition controller 4 comprises a voltage determining means 17 and a digital control means ISA.<br>
The digital control means ISA comprises a CPU (Central Processor Unit) as a main part, an ignition control means 23, an ignition timing computing means 24, an igniting means 25, a pulse cycle measuring means 26, a differential computing means 27, a memory means 38, a pulse cycle estimating means 29, and a memory means 30. [0025]<br>
Fig. 3 shows the operation of the ignition control system 3 of the present invention.<br>
The operation of the ignition control system in Fig. 2 will be described with reference to Fig. 3. [0026]<br>
The reference voltage generating means 21 produces the reference voltage Vr at a Zener diode ZD1 from the rectified output Vb supplied by the regulator 11 via the main switch 13. [0027]<br>
Fig. 3-(l) shows waveforms of the rectified outputs Vb produced by the regulator 11 through rectifying the generated output Va of the AC generator 10 having eight poles.<br>
Fig. 3-(3) shows waveforms of the pulse signals Sp which are equal to an engine speed and are generated by the pulse coil 10B.<br>
[0028]<br>
Referring to Fig. 3-(l), the waveforms of the rectified outputs Vb are four half-wave rectified waveforms Vb(l),<br>
Vb(2), Vb(3) and Vb(4) per rotation of the vehicle engine.<br>
In Fig. 3-(l), a minimum.reference voltage Vr(m) is a Zener voltage of the Zener diode ZDl.<br>
The reference voltage Vr becomes zero when the rectified output Vb of the regulator 11 is equal to or less than the Zener voltage of the Zener diode ZDl. [0029]<br>
The voltage determining means 17 determines whether or not the reference voltage Vr is within the predetermined range, each time the rectified output Vb is output by the regulator 11. If not, the voltage determining means 17 outputs a determination signal S22 (voltage 0) indicative of the ignition suspension.<br>
When the reference voltage Vr is within the predetermined range, the voltage determining means 17 compares it with the rectified output Vb in order to check whether or not the rectified output Vb is equal to or larger than the reference voltage Vr. If not, the voltage determining means 17 provides the ignition control means 23 with the determination signal S22 (voltage 0) indicative allowance of ignition. [0030]<br>
When the reference voltage Vr is within the<br>
predetermined range and when the rectified output Vb is equal to or larger than the reference voltage Vr, the voltage determining means 17 provides the ignition control means 23 with the determination signal indicative of allowance of ignition.<br>
Fig. 3-(2) shows the determination signals {S22(l) -S22(4)} indicative of allowance of ignition of the voltage determining means 17. [0031]<br>
The pulse cycle measuring—means 26 measures cycles of the pulse signals generated by the pulse coil 10B in response to the rotation of the vehicle engine, and outputs a pulse cycle signal Me(t) to the control means 23 and the memory<br>
means 28.<br>
Fig. 3-(3) shows waveforms of the pulse signals Sp.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3-(3), the pulse signals Sp are negative signals Spl(t) and positive signals Sp2(t).<br>
The pulse cycle measuring means 26 measures a period between time ta of the negative signal Spl(+0) and time td of the negative signal Spl(tl). [0032]<br>
The ignition control means 23 provides the igniting means 25 with the ignition control signal S23 on the basis of the determination signal S22, pulse cycle signal Me(t), and an ignition control start signal S24(b) from the ignition timing computing means 24. The ignition control start signal S24(b) will be described later. [0033]<br>
The ignition control means 32 outputs the ignition control signal S23 for permitting ignition in the case of a first rotation of the vehicle engine {when the pulse cycle signal Me(t)
The ignition control means 32 outputs the ignition control signal S23 for suspending ignition in the case of rotations other than the first rotation after the activation of the digital control means 18A (CPU) when the pulse cycle signal Me(t)is less than 26.09 ms. [0034]<br>
When the pulse cycle signal Me(t) is equal to or larger than 26.09 ms, the ignition control means 23 reads, during a latter half of a CPU computing cycle (i.e. while the CPU is not computing), the determination signals {s22(2), S22(3), S22(4) and S22(l)} each time the rectified output Vb is provided, thereby performing majority determination. Specifically, if three or more-determination signals S22 represent allowance of ignition, the ignition control means 32 provides the igniting means 25 with the ignition control signal S23 for permitting the ignition.<br>
When two or more determination signals S22 denote the ignition suspension, the ignition control means 32 provides the ignition means 25 with the ignition control signal S23 for suspending the ignition. [0035]<br>
In the digital control means.18A, the differential computing means 27 and the pulse cycle estimating means 29 compute or process data, which are necessary for the ignition timing computing means 24 to compute ignition timing, during latter halves (tb - td, te -) of the cycle Me(t) shown in Fig. 3-(4). [0036]<br>
The differential computing means 27 computes a differential between the current pulse cycle signal Me(tO) and the previous pulse cycle signal Me(-tl), and outputs a differential signal AMe(tO) to the memory means 28.<br>
The memory means 28 comprises a RAM (Random Access Memory) etc., sequentially stores N pulse cycle signals Me(t) and N differential computation results AM2(t) which are differentials between the N pulse cycle signals Me(t) and their previous pulse cycle signals Me(-t), and sequentially provides the pulse cycle estimating means 29 with N pulse cycle signals Me(n) and differential signals AMe(n).<br>
[0037]<br>
The pulse cycle estimating means 29 sequentially estimates pulse cycles following the current pulse cycle signal Me(tl) on the basis of N pulse cycle signals Me(n) and the differential signals AMe(n), and outputs an estimated pulse cycle signal Me(tl) to the memory means 30. [0038]<br>
The memory means 30 mainly comprises a PROM (Programmable Read only Memory), and stores ignition angle data, i.e. time data, for the estimated pulse cycle signal Me(tl).<br>
Figs. 7-(l) and 7-(2) are graphs showing ignition angle data 0(tl) characteristics with respect to an engine speed Ne(rpm), {where Ne = ,60/Me(Tl) } .<br>
The memory means 30 provides the ignition timing computing means 24 with ignition angle data 6(tl) corresponding to the estimated pulse cycle signal Me(tl) as an address . [0039]<br>
Figs. 7-(l) and 7-(2) are graphs showing ignition angle data 6(tl) characteristics with respect to an engine speed Ne (rpm), {where Ne = 60/Me(Tl)}.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7-(l), the ignition angle data 6(tl) remains unchanged for the engine speeds between {Ne(0)1'Ne <ne i.e. is in a fixed ignition range. for the engine speeds ne between angle data an advancing another range></ne>
The memory means 30 stores these ignition angle data<br>
[0040]<br>
The ignition timing computing means 24 performs computation or processing for deriving ignition timing in the front halves (ta-tb, td-te) of the cycle Me(t) shown in Fig.<br>
Specifically, the ignition timing computing means 24 computes the ignition timing on the basis of the ignition angle data 6(tl) and time ta where the pulse signal Spl(tl) is produced, and outputs an ignition timing signal S24(a) to the igniting means 25 at time tf. [0041]<br>
When the ignition control signals S23 denote allowance of ignition, the igniting means 25 outputs an ignition signal S25 to the ignition coil 15 at the time tf where the ignition timing signal S24(a) is input. —<br>
Conversely, when the ignition control signals S23 denote the ignition suspension, the igniting means 25 does not output any ignition timing signal S24(a) to the ignition coil<br><br>
The foregoing operations are repeatedly carried out. [0042]<br>
Fig. 4 is a context diagram of an ignition control system 3 according to the present invention.<br>
The ignition control system 3 outputs the ignition signal S25 to the ignition coil 15 on the basis of the rectified output Vb and reference voltage Vr from the main switch 13 and the operation of the main switch, and in response to the pulse signal Sp from the pulse coil 10B. [0043]<br>
Fig. 5 is a data flow diagram (DFD) of the ignition control system 3.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, DFDl measures the pulse cycle Me on the basis of the pulse signal Sp, and outputs a pulse cycle signal Me(t) to DFD2 , DFD3 , DFD6, DFD7 , and DFD8 .<br>
DFD2 fixes the ignition timing on the basis of the pulse cycle signal Me(t), and outputs the ignition control signals S23 (denoting fixed ignition) to DFD5. [0044]<br>
DFD6 computes N differentials AMe(n) on the basis of the<br>
pulse cycle signal Me(t), and stores N pulse cycle signals Me(n) and N differentials AMe(n) in memory media.<br>
[0045]<br>
DFD3 reads the ignition angle data 0(tl) corresponding<br>
to the N pulse cycle signals Me(t) from the memory media, corrects the ignition angle data 6(tl) using N differentials AMe(n), and outputs the corrected ignition angle data 0(tl) to DFD4. [0046]<br>
DFD4 computes the ignition timing on the basis of the pulse signal Sp and the ignition angle data 0(tl), and outputs the ignition timing si-gnal S24(a) to DFD5.<br>
DFD5 controls ignition/misfire in response to the ignition control signal S23 and the ignition timing signal S24(a), and outputs the ignition signal to the ignition coil.<br>
[0047]<br>
DFD8 outputs an over-speed protection signal to DFD5 in response to the pulse cycle signal Me(t). [0048]<br>
Fig. 6 shows details of the data flow diagram DFD7.<br>
In Fig. 6, DFD7 checks whether or not the reference voltage Vr is within the predetermined range in (7-1), compares the reference voltage Vr with the rectified output Vb, determines whether or not the rectified output Vb is larger than the reference Vr, and outputs the determination signal S22 to (7-2). [0049]<br>
(7-2) in DFD7 outputs the ignition control signal S23 in response to the pulse cycle signal Me(t) and the determination signal S22. [0050]<br>
As described, the ignition control system 3 comprises the reference voltage generating means 21, voltage determining means 17, ignition control means 23, ignition timing computing means 24, igniting means 25, and pulse cycle measuring means 29 and memory means 30, thereby improving the reliability of the voltage determining means 17, and enabling vehicle engines having different characteristics to be optimally ignited in accordance with engine speeds. Therefore, it is not necessary to match the generation timing of the pulse signal Sp in the pulse coil 10B with the phase of the generated output Va of the AC generator 10, which enables components to be applied to common usage.

Fig. 8 is a block diagram of a main part of an ignition control system 5 according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, the ignition control system 5 comprises a reference voltage generating means 21 and an ignition controller 6.<br>
The ignition controller 6 comprises a voltage determining means 17 and an analog control means 18B.<br>
The analog control means 18B comprises a switch means 41, an igniting power source 42, and an igniting means 43. [0052]<br>
The operation of the ignition control system 5 shown in Fig. 8 will be described with reference to Figs. 11 and 12.<br>
Fig. 11 shows the regular operation of the ignition control system.<br>
Fig. 12 shows the anti-theft operation of the ignition control system. [0053]<br>
The reference voltage generating means 21 generates the reference voltage Vr from the rectified output Vb, supplied from the regulator 11 via the main switch 13, using the Zener diode ZDl, and outputs the reference voltage Vr to the voltage determining means 17. [0054]<br>
Figs, ll-(l) and 12-(1) show waveforms of the rectified output Vb which is obtained by rectifying the generated output Va of the 8-pole AC generator 10, in the regulator 11.<br>
The waveform of the rectified output Vb has four half-waveforms Vb(l), Vb(2), Vb(3) and Vb(4) per rotation of the vehicle engine, as shown in Figs, ll-(l) and 12-(1).<br>
In the drawings, a minimum reference voltage Vr(m) is a Zener voltage of the Zener diode ZDl.<br>
The reference voltage Vr becomes zero when the rectified output Vb of the regulator 11 is equal to or less than the Zener voltage of the Zener diode ZDl. [0055]<br>
Each time the regulator 11 outputs the rectified output Vb, the voltage determining means 17 determines whether or the reference voltage Vr is within the predetermined range. If not, the voltage determining means 17 outputs to the switch means 41 the determination signal S40 {840(1) ~ S40(4)} indicative of the ignition suspension shown in Fig.<br>
[0056]<br><br>
Further, each time the regulator 11 outputs the rectified output Vb, the voltage determining means 17 determines whether or not the reference voltage Vr is within the predetermined range. If the reference voltage Vr is within the predetermined range, the voltage determining means 17 compares the reference voltage .Vr with the rectified output Vb from the regulator 11, and determines whether or not the rectified output Vb is equal to or larger than the reference voltage Vr. If not, the voltage determining means 17 also outputs to the switch means 41 the determination signal S40 {S40(l) - S40(4)} indicative of the ignition suspension, shown in Fig. 12-(2). [0057]<br>
Only when the reference voltage Vr is within the predetermined range and when the rectified output Vb is equal to larger than the reference voltage Vr, the voltage determining means 17 provides the switch means 41 with the determination signal S40 indicative of allowance of ignition shown in Fig. ll-(2). [0058]<br>
The switch means 41 controls the igniting power source 42 of the igniting means 43 in response to the determination signal S40.<br>
When the determination signal S40 denotes allowance of ignition, the switch means 41 controls the igniting power source 42 in order to supply an output S42 (shown in Fig. 11-(3)) to the igniting means 43.<br>
The igniting means 43 outputs an ignition signal S43 (shown in Fig. ll-(4)) to the ignition coil 15 in response to the pulse signal Sp from the pulse coil 10B.<br>
When the determination signal S40 denotes the ignition suspension, the switch means 41 nullifies the output S24 of the igniting power source 42-(-shown in Fig. 12-(3)), and prevents the igniting means 43 from igniting. [0059]<br>
As described, the ignition control system 5 comprises<br>
the reference voltage generating means 21, voltage determining means 17, switch means 41, igniting power source 42, and igniting means 43, thereby improving the reliability of the voltage determining means 17. Therefore, it is not necessary to match the generation timing of the pulse signal Sp in the pulse coil 10B with the .phase of the generated output Va of the AC generator 10, which allows components to be used in common. [0060]<br>

When a determination signal S40 of the voltage determining means 17 denotes allowance of ignition (shown in Fig. ll-(2)), the control switch means 45 is turned off since the switching transistor Trl becomes non-conductive.<br>
Conversely, when the determination signal S40 denotes allowance of ignition (shown in Fig. 12-(2)), the control switch means 45 is turned on since the switching transistor Trl becomes conductive. [0062]<br>
The igniting power source switch means 46 comprises a<br>
biasing resistor R2, a Zener diode ZD2, a switching<br>
transistor Tr2, and a capacitor Cl.<br>
[0063]	-•-<br>
When the determination signal S40 denotes allowance of ignition, the control switch means 45 is turned off, a base terminal of the switch transistor Tr2 is biased by the<br>
biasing resistor R2 and the Zener diode ZD2, the switch transistor Tr2 becomes conductive, the igniting power source switch means 46 is turned on, and the rectified output Vb is applied to the DC-DC converter 47.<br>
The DC-DC converter 47 supplies an igniting voltage S47, so that the igniting means 43.output an ignition signal S43 to the ignition coil. [0064]<br>
When the determination signal S40 denotes the ignition suspension, the control switch means 45 is turned on, the base terminal of the switch transistor Tr2 has a zero potential, the switching transistor Tr2 becomes non-conductive, and the igniting power source switch means 46 is turned off, so that no rectified output Vb is applied to the DC-DC converter 47.<br>
The igniting means 43 suspends ignition since the igniting voltage S47 becomes the zero potential in the DC-DC converter 47. [0065]<br>
Fig. 10 is a block diagram of a main part of an ignition control system 8 according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, the ignition control system 8 comprises a voltage determining means 17 and an analog control means 18D.<br>

The igniting power source switch means 50 comprises a biasing resistor R3, a biasing resistor R4, a Zener diode ZD3, an SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier), a diode Dl, a capacitor C2, and a capacitor C3. [0066]<br>
In the ignition control- system 8, the igniting power source switch means 50 has the SCR as a switching element in place of the transistor which is used for the igniting power source switch means 46 of the ignition control system 7.<br>
[0067]<br>
When a determination signal S40 denotes allowance of ignition, the control switch means 45 is turned off, a gate terminal of the SCR is biased by the biasing resistors (R3, R4), diode Dl and Zener diode ZD2, the SCR becomes conductive, the igniting power source switch means 50 is turned on, and the rectified output Vb is applied to the DC-DC converter 47. [0068]<br>
When the determination signal S40 denotes the ignition suspension, the control switch means 45 is turned on, the SCR has a zero potential at its gate terminal and becomes non-conductive, and the igniting power source switch means 46 is turned on, so that the rectified output Vb is applied to the DC-DC converter 47. [0069]<br>
Fig. 13 is a block diagram of an ignition control system 9 according to the present invention.<br>
The ignition control system 9 comprises a reference voltage generating means 21 and an ignition controller 10.<br>
The ignition controller 10 comprises a voltage determining means 17 and an analog control means 18E.<br>
The analog control means 18E comprises an igniting power source switch means 61 and an igniting means 62.<br>
The igniting power source switch means 61 comprises a protecting resistor R5 and a switching transistor Tr3. [0070]<br>
When the determination signal S40 of the voltage determining means 17 denotes allowance of ignition as shown in Fig. ll-(2), the switch transistor Tr3 becomes non-conductive in the igniting power source switch means 61, the igniting power source switch means 61 is turned off, and an AC voltage Ve of an exciter coil IOC is applied to the igniting means 62 as an igniting power source voltage.<br>
.Conversely, when the determination signal S40 of the voltage determining means 17 denotes the ignition suspension (shown in fig. 12-(2)), the switching transistor Tr3 of the<br>
igniting power source switch means 61 becomes conductive, the igniting power source switch means 61 is turned on, the exciter coil 10C is shorted, and the igniting power source voltage of the igniting means 62 becomes the zero potential. Therefore, the igniting means 62 suspends ignition. [0071]<br>
