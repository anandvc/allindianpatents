This application claims priority from U. S. Provisional Application Serial Nos. 60/284,666; 60/284,667; 60/284. 668; 60/284, 669 all filed April 18, 2001, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chronic pain is a major contributor to disability and is the cause of an untold amount of suffering. The successful treatment of severe and chronic pain is a primary goal of the physician with opioid analgesics being preferred drugs.<br>
Until recently, there was evidence of three major classes of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), with each class having subtype receptors. These receptor classes were designated as p, 6 and K. As opiates had a high affinity to these receptors while not being endogenous to the body, research followed in order to identify and isolate the endogenous ligands to these receptors. These ligands were identified as enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins.<br>
Recent experimentation has led to the identification of a cDNA encoding an opioid receptor-like (ORL1) receptor with a high degree of homology to the known receptor classes. This newly discovered receptor was classified as an opioid receptor based only on structural grounds, as the receptor did not exhibit pharmacological homology. It was initially demonstrated that non-selective ligands having a high affinity for u.. 6 and K receptors had low affinity for the ORL1. This characteristic, along with the fact that an endogenous ligand had not yet been discovered, led to the term"orphan receptor".<br>
Subsequent research led to the isolation and structure of the endogenous ligand of the ORL1 receptor. This ligand is a seventeen amino acid peptide structurally similar to members of the opioid peptide family.<br>
The discovery of the OR1.1 receptor presents an opportunity in drug discovery for novel compounds which can be administered for pain management or other syndromes modulated by this receptor.<br>
All documents cited herein, including the foregoing, are incorporated by reference in their entireties for all<br>
purposes.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is accordingly an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide new compounds which exhibit affinity for the OR1.I receptor.<br>
It is an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide new compounds which exhibit affinity lor the ORLI receptor and one or more of the u., 8 and K receptors.<br>
It is an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide new compounds for treating a patient suffering from chronic or acute pain by administering a compound having affinity for the ORLI receptor.<br>
It is an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide new compounds which have agonist activity at the µ and K receptors which is greater than compounds currently available e. g. morphine.<br>
It is an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide methods of treating chronic and acute pain by administering compounds which have agonist activity at the µ ,  and K receptors which is greater than compounds currently available.<br>
It is an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide methods of treating chronic and acute pain by administering non-opioid compounds which have agonist activity at the fa, 8 and K receptors and which produce less side effects than compounds currently available.<br><br>
It is an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide compounds useful as analgesics, anti-inflammatories, diuretics, anesthetics and neuroprotective agents, anti-hypertensives, anti-anxioltics ; agents for appetite control; hearing regulators ; anti-tussives, anti-asthmatics, modulators of locomotor activity, modulators of learning and memory, regulators of neurotransmitter and hormone release, kidney function modulators, anti-depressants, agents to treat memory loss due to Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, anti-epileptics, anti-convulsants, agents to treat withdrawal from alcohol and drugs of addiction, agents to control water balance, agents to control sodium excretion and agents to control arterial blood pressure disorders and methods for administering said compounds.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful for modulating a pharmacodynamic response from one or more opioid receptors (ORL-l, u., 6 and K) centrally and/or peripherally. The response can be attributed to the compound stimulating (agonist) or inhibiting (antagonist) the one or more receptors. Certain compounds can stimulate one receptor|(e. g., a u, agonist) and inhibit a different receptor (e. g., an ORL-1 antagonist).<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
Nociceptin affinity at the ORL1 receptor for preferred compounds was obtained using the following assay: Membranes from recombinant HEK-293 cells expressing the human opioid receptor- like receptor (ORL-1) (Receptor Biology) were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM HEPES. pH 7.4) (10 ml/10 cm dish) followed by homogenization with a tissue grinder/teflon pestle. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORL-1 receptor membranes were stored at-80°C.<br>
I-unctional SGTPgS binding assays were conducted as follows. ORL-1 membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding final concentrations of 0.066 mg/ml ORL-1 membrane protein, 10 mg/ml saponin, 3 mM GDP and 0.20 nM [35S] GTPgStobindingbuffer(100 mM NaCI, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice. The prepared membrane solution (190 ml/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 ml of 20x concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GI-7B filler plates (Packard) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Brandel) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 ml ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50°C for 2-3 hours. Fifty ml/well scintillation cocktail (BetaScint; Wallac) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well.<br>

(Procedure  Removed)<br>
General procedure for alkylation:<br>
To a solution of the aimine (1 eq) and triethylamine (1 eq) in dimethylformamide, was added 1 eq of alkyl bromide or chloride in one portion. The mixture was stirred and heated at 80°C over night. TLC indicated the reaction was complete. The reaction was quenched by the addition of water followed by 1 N NaOH to pH 10. i he mixture was extracted 2x with Et2O. The combined organic extracts were dried over potassium carbonate and the solvent evaporated, followed by chromatography to give the pure product.<br><br><br>
General procedure for reductive amination:<br>
I o a mixture of ketone or aldehyde (1 eq), amine (1 eq); and acetic acid (1 eq) in methanol, was added sodium cyanohorohydridc (1.4 eq) in one portion. The mixture was stirred over night at room temperature. TLC indicated the reaction was complete. The reaction was quenched by the addition of water followed by 1 N NaOH to pi I 10. The mixture was extracted 2x with Et2O. The combined organic extracts were dried over potassium carbonate and the solvent evaporated, followed by chromatography to give the pure product.<br>

EXAMPLE 9<br>
Nociccptin affinity at the ORLI receptor for preferred compounds was obtained using the following assay: Membranes from recombinant HEK-293 cells expressing the human opioid receptor-like receptor (ORL-1) (Receptor Biology) were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM 1IEPHS. pll 7.4) (10 ml/10 cm dish) followed by homogenization with a tissue grinder/teflon pestle. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORL-1 receptor membranes were stored at-80°C.<br>
Functional SGTPgS binding assays were conducted as follows. ORL-1 membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding final concentrations of 0.066 mg/ml ORL-1 membrane protein, 10 mg/ml saponin, 3 mM GDP and 0.20 nM [3SSJ GTPgS to binding buffer (100 mM NaCI, 10 mM MgCI2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7. 4) on ice. The prepared membrane solution (190 ml/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 ml of 20x concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96- well Unifilter GF/B filter plates (Packard) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Brandel) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 ml ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50°C for 2-3 hours. Fifty ml/well scintillation cocktail (BetaScint; Wallac) was added and plates were counted in aPackard Top-Count for 1 min/well.<br>
Data was analy/ed using the curve fitting functions in GraphPad PRISMO, v. 3.0 and the results are set forth in table 2 below:<br><br>

EXAMPLE 12<br>
Nociccptin affinity at the ORL1 receptor forpreferred compounds was obtained using the following assay:<br>
Membranes from recombinant HEK-293 cells expressing the human opioid receptor-like receptor (ORL-1) (Receptor Biology) were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (2.5 mM MgCl2, 50mM lll:PI S, pH7.4) (10 ml/10 cm dish) followed by homogenization with a tissue grinder/teflon pestle. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30, 000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BtoRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORL-1 receptor membranes were stored at-80°C.<br>
i unciional SGTPgS binding assays were conducted as follows. ORL-1 membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding final concentrations of 0. 066 mg/ml ORL-1 membrane protein, 10 mg/ml saponin, 3 mM GDP and 0.20 nM |35S| GTPgS to binding buffer (100 mM NaCI, 10 mM MgCI2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7. 4) on ice. 1 he prepared membrane solution (190 ml/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 ml of 20x concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96- well Unifilter Gl'/B filter plates (Packard) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Brandel) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 ml ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at SOT for 2-3 hours. Fifty ml/well scintillation cocktail (BetaScint; Wallac) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well.<br><br>
Data was analy/cd using the curve fitting functions in GraphPad PRISMO, v. 3.0 and the results are set forth in table i below:<br>

Procedure:<br>
Sodium hydride 60% dispersion in mineral oil (0.67 g, 16.7 mmol) was washed with dry pentane and then suspended in 80 mL of dry TI IF under N2. Compound 1 (European patent 0029707) (3.80 g, 11.1 mmol) was added, the mixture stirred at room temperature for 15 min and then warmed to 50°C. Ethyl bromide (1.06 mL, I 3.3 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture stirred at 50°C for 18 hr. TLC (SiO2, CH2C12: MeOH 96: 4) showed that the reaction was ca 40% complete. Additional sodium hydride (0.67 g) and ethyl bromide (1.06 mL) were added. After heating at 50°C for an additional 24 hr the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and quenched with water. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer extracted with ethyl acetate (Ix). The combined organic extracts were washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (Ix), dried over MgS()4 and the solvent was evaporated to give the crude product as a yellow solid. Trituration with diethyl ether gave pure 2 as a white solid (3.38 g, 82%).<br>

To a solution of 2 (3. 60 g, 9.74 mmol) in 100 mL of ethyl acetate was added a 25 mL of a 1: 1 mixture of ethyl acetate and concentrated HC1. The mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 2hr. and evaporated to dryness. The residue was neutralized with 50 mL of methanolic ammonia 10:1 and again evaporated to dryness. The residue was suspended in 100 mL a 1: 1 mixture of MeOH and CH2C12, filtered and the filtrate evaporated to dryness to leave an off-white solid. Flash chromatography on silica gel, eluting v\ith CI LCkMeOILNII, (300:10: 1) gave pure 3 as a white crystalline solid (1.98 g, 76%).<br>

EXAMPLE 15<br>
Noeiceplin affinity at the ORL I receptor for preferred compounds was obtained using the following assay:<br>
Membranes from recornbinant HEK-293 cells expressing the human opioid receptor- like receptor (ORL-1) (Receptor Biology) were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM 1IEPKS, pH 7.4) (10 ml/10 cm dish) followed by homogenization with a tissue grinder/teflon pestle. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORL-1 receptor membranes were stored at -80°C.<br>
Functional SGTPgS binding assays were conducted as follows. ORL-1 membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding final concentrations of 0.066 mg/ml ORL-1 membrane protein, 10 mg/ml saponin, 3 mM GDP and 0.20 nM |3SS| GTPgS to binding buffer (100 mM NaCI, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice. The prepared merrlbrane solution (190 ml/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 ml of 20.x concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min al room temperature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96- well Unifilter GF/U Illter plates (Packard) using a 96-weIl tissue harvester (Brandel) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 ml ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 30°C for 2-3 hours. Fifty ml/well scintillation cocktail (BetaScint; Wallac) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well.<br>
Data was analyzed using the curve fitting functions in GraphPad PRISMO, v. 3.0 and the results are set forth in table 4 below:<br>
