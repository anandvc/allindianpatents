(a)	IPCA LABORATORIES LIMITED<br>
(b)	48, Kandivli Industrial Estate, Mumbai - 400 067, Maharashtra, India<br>
(c)	Indian Company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed;<br><br><br>
Technical Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of substituted aminopentylamines, key intermediates in the preparation of anti-malarial, anti-rheumatic agents such as chloroquine sulphate, chloroquine phosphate, chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine base, or theif acid addition salts starting from l-chloro-4-pentanone.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Hydroxy novoldamine, chemically known as 5-(N-ethyI-N-2-hydroxy ethylamino)-2-pentyl)amine and novoldamine, chemically known as 5-(N,N-diethylamino)-2-pentylamine are the intermediates of anti-malarial drugs viz; hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.<br>
US patent 2,365,825 discloses a method for preparation of N,N-diethylamino alcohols, particularly N,N-diethyl-l-amino-4-pentanol which comprises reacting 1,4-pentanediol with diethylamine in the presence of a metal hydrogenation catalyst more specifically Ni /tfeat temperature range within 120-250° C.<br>
US patent 2,442,854 discusses an improved process for preparing the oxime of 1-diethylamino-4-pentanone, an intermediate used in the synthesis of novaldamine. This reported process comprises acidic decarboxylation of [(diethylami no ethyl) ethyl acetoacetate] to obtain 1 -diethylamino-4-pentanone in presence of sulfuric acid.<br>
2.<br><br>
US patent 2,546,658 describes a process for preparation of hydroxy novoldamine, wherein the condensation of l-halo-4-pentanone with N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamine to yield l-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamine)-4-pentanone and its further reductive animation to give 5-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamino)-2-pentylamine, is disclosed.<br>
Hydroxy novoldamine was used as a primary starting material for the preparation of 2-{[4-(7-benz[c] acridinylamino)pentyl]ethylamino}ethanol, which was used as an amebicidal agent was described in US patent no 2,915,523. Starting from 5-chloro-2-pentanone, 2-ethylaminoethanol, sodium chloride and xylene, for 5-(N-ethyl-2-hydroxyehylamino)-2-pentanone was obtained which was reductively hydrogenated to give 2-[(4-amino pentyl)ethyl amino]ethanol, as per this patent.<br>
GB patent 1,157,637 describes a process for the preparation of novoldamine and related amines which comprises of catalytic hydrogenation of methyl glutaronitrile, reductive alkylation of 2-methyl glutaronitrile, hydrolyzing valeronitrile, treating valeramide with an aqueous alkaline solution of an akali metal hypohalite.<br>
US patent 4,910,343 describes a simple and economical method of producing the novel nitro amine compounds which are enamine compound, l-diethylamino-4-nitropenetene-l and its partially reduced counterpart, l-diethylamino-4-nitropentane. These compounds further provide a new synthetic route to the formation of novaldamine.<br>
RO 62684 describes the preparation of N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethyl-l,4-pentanediamine by reacting 5-[N-(2-hydroxyethy) ethylamino]-2-pentanone with ammonia and hydrogen over Raney Nickel.<br>
Novoldamine and hydroxy novoldamine are prepared by various synthetic routes in prior art as described above. But, most of the methods are not practiced due to the complexity of synthesis. The drawback of the processes described in the prior art is that the isolation of the required compound is very difficult because of the higher concentrations of impurities in the product and therefore gives very poor yields of the pure compound.<br><br><br>
The major drawback of the reported processes starting from 1- chloro-4-pentanone is their high reactivity with the amines, leading to uncontrollable exotherm at large scale, formation of impurities which are very difficult to remove, as stated above.<br>
In a nutshell, the process mentioned in prior art are not plant friendly and require repeated purification by high vacuum fractional distillation for getting the product of desired quality, which ultimately leads to increased cost of manufacture. Hence there is a need for development of economically as well as plant friendly process for the title products.<br>
Objectives<br>
•	The main objective of the present invention is to provide a simple plant friendly and economical process for the manufacture of aminopentylamines having desired quality for transferring the latter in to the corresponding quinolines of high purity.<br>
•	A further objective of the present invention is to reduce the reactivity of 1-chloro-4-pentanone to control high exotherm at large scale operations, by protecting the keto group to provide a better quality and yield of the title product.<br>
•	A further objective of the present invention is to provide better reaction condition for reductive amination at lower hydrogen pressure and stoichiometric amounts of catalyst such as Raney Nickel.<br>
