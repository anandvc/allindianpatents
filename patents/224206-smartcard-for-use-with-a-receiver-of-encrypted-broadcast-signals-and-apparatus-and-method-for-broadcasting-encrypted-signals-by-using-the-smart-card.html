An overview of a digital television broadcast and reception system 1000 according to<br>
the present invention is shown in Figure 1. The invention includes a mostly<br>
conventional digital television system 2000 which uses the known MPEG-2<br>
compression system to transmit compressed digital signals. In more detail, MPEG-2<br>
compressor 2002 in a broadcast centre receives a digital signal stream (typically a<br>
stream of video signals). The compressor 2002 is connected to a multiplexer and<br>
scrambler 2004 by linkage 2006. The multiplexer 2004 receives a plurality of further<br>
input signals, assembles one or more transport streams and transmits compressed<br>
digital signals to a transmitter 2008 of the broadcast centre via linkage 2010, which<br>
can of course take a wide variety of forms including telecom links. The transmitter<br>
2008 transmits electromagnetic signals via uplink 2012 towards a satellite transponder<br>
2014, where they are electronically processed and broadcast via notional downlink<br>
2016 to earth receiver 2018, conventionally in the form of a dish owned or rented by<br>
the end user, The signals received by receiver 2018 are transmitted to an integrated<br>
receiver/decoder 2020 owned or rented by the end user and connected to the end user's<br>
television set 2022. The receiver/decoder 2020 decodes the compressed MPEG-2<br>
signal into a television signal for the television set 2022.<br>
A conditional access system 3000 is connected to the multiplexer 2004 and the<br>
receiver/decoder 2020, and is located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in the<br>
decoder. It enables the end user to access digital television broadcasts from one or<br>
more broadcast suppliers. A smartcard, capable of decrypting messages relating to<br>
commercial offers (that is, one or several television programmes sold by the broadcast<br>
supplier), can be inserted into the receiver/decoder 2020. Using the decoder 2020 and<br>
smartcard, the end user may purcnase events in either a subscription mode or a pay-<br>
per-view mode.<br>
An interactive system 4000, also connected to the multiplexer 2004 and the<br>
receiver/decoder 2020 and again located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in<br>
the decoder, enables the end user to interact with various applications via a<br>
modemmed back channel 4002.<br>
The conditional access system 3000 is now described in more detail.<br>
With reference to Figure 2, in overview the conditional access system 3000 includes<br>
a Subscriber Authorization System (SAS) 3002. The SAS 3002 is connected to one<br>
or more Subscriber Management Systems (SMS) 3004, one SMS for each broadcast<br>
supplier, by a respective TCP-IP linkage 3006 (although other types of linkage could<br>
alternatively be used). Alternatively, one SMS could be shared between two broadcast<br>
suppliers, or one supplier could use two SMSs, and so on.<br>
First encrypting units in the form of ciphering units 3008 utilising "mother" smartcards<br>
3010 are connected to the SAS by linkage 3012. Second encrypting units again in the<br>
form of ciphering units 3014 utilising mother smartcards 3016 arc connected to the<br>
multiplexer 2004 by linkage 3018. The receiver/decoder 2020 receives a "daughter"<br>
smartcard 3020. It is connected directly to the SAS 3002 by Communications Servers<br>
3022 via the modemmed back channel 4002. The SAS sends amongst other things<br>
subscription rights to the daughter smartcard on request.<br>
The smartcards contain the secrets of one or more commercial operators. The<br>
"mother" smartcard encrypts different kinds of messages and the "daughter" smartcards<br>
decrypt the messages, if they have the rights to do so.<br>
The first and second ciphering units 3008 and 3014 comprise a rack, an electronic<br>
VME card with software stored on an EEPROM, up to 20 electronic cards and one<br>
smartcard 3010 and 3016 respectively, for each electronic card, one (card 3016) for<br>
encrypting the EGMs and one (card 3010) for encrypting the EMMs.<br>
The operation of the conditional access system 3000 of the digital television system<br>
will now be described in more detail with reference to the various components of the<br>
television system 2000 and the conditional access system 3000.<br>
Multiplexer and Scrambler<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, in the broadcast centre, the digital video signal is<br>
first compressed (or bit rate reduced), using the MPEG-2 compressor 2002. This<br>
compressed signal is then transmitted to the multiplexer and scrambler 2004 via the<br>
linkage 2006 in order to be multiplexed with other data, such as other compressed<br>
data.<br>
The scrambler generates a control word used in the scrambling process and included<br>
in the MPEG-2 stream in the multiplexer 2004. The control word is generated<br>
internally and enables the end user's integrated receiver/decoder 2020 to descramble<br>
the programme.<br>
Access criteria, indicating how the programme is commercialised, are also added to<br>
the MPEG-2 stream. The programme may be commercialised in either one of a<br>
number of "subscription" modes and/or one of a number of "Pay Per View" (PFV)<br>
modes or events. In the subscription mode, the end user subscribes to one or more<br>
commercial offers, or 'bouquets", thus getting the rights to watch every channel inside<br>
those bouquets. In the preferred embodiment, up to 960 commercial offers may be<br>
selected from a bouquet of channels. In the Pay Per View mode, the end user is<br>
provided with the capability to purchase events as he wishes. This can be achieved<br>
by either pre-booking the event in advance ("pre-book mode"), or by purchasing the<br>
event as soon as it is broadcast ("impulse mode"). In the preferred embodiment, all<br>
users are subscribers, whether or not they watch in subscription or PPV mode, but of<br>
course PPV viewers need not necessarily be subscribers.<br>
Both the control word and the access criteria are used to build an Entitlement Control<br>
Message (ECM); this is a message sent in relation with one scrambled program; the<br>
message contains a control word (which allows for the descrambling of the program)<br>
and the access criteria of the broadcast program. The access criteria and control word<br>
are transmitted to the second encrypting unit 3014 via the linkage 3018. In this unit,<br>
an ECM is generated, encrypted and transmitted on to the multiplexer and scrambler<br>
2004.<br>
Bach service broadcast by a broadcast supplier in a data stream comprises a number<br>
of distinct components; for example a television programme includes a video<br>
component, an audio component, a sub-title component and so on. Each of these<br>
components of a service is individually scrambled and encrypted for subsequent<br>
broadcast to the transponder 2014. In respect of each scrambled component of the<br>
service, a separate ECM is required.<br>
The multiplexer 2004 receives electrical signals comprising encrypted EMMs from the<br>
SAS 3002, encrypted ECMs from the second encrypting unit 3014 and compressed<br>
programmes from the compressor 2002. The multiplexer 2004 scrambles the<br>
programmes and transmits the scrambled programmes, the encrypted EMMs and the<br>
encrypted ECMs as electric signals to a transmitter 2008 of the broadcast centre via<br>
linkage 2010. The transmitter 2008 transmits electromagnetic signals towards the<br>
satellite transponder 2014 via uplink 2012.<br>
Programme Reception<br>
The satellite transponder 2014 receives and processes the electromagnetic signals<br>
transmitted by the transmitter 2008 and transmits the signals on to the earth receiver<br>
2018, conventionally in the form of a dish owned or rented by the end user, via<br>
downlink 2016. The signals received by receiver 2018 are transmitted to the<br>
integrated receiver/decoder 2020 owned or rented by the end user and connected to<br>
the end user's television set 2022. The receiver/decoder 2020 demultiplexes the<br>
signals to obtain scrambled programmes with encrypted EMMs and encrypted ECMs.<br>
If the programme is not scrambled, that is, no ECM has been transmitted with the<br>
MPEG-2 stream, the receiver/decoder 2020 decompresses the data and transforms the<br>
signal into a video signal for transmission to television set 2022.<br>
If the programme is scrambled, the receiver/decoder 2020 extracts the corresponding<br>
ECM from the MPEG-2 stream and passes the ECM to the "daughter" smartcard 3020<br>
of the end user. This slots into a housing in the receiver/decoder 2020. The daughter<br>
smartcard 3020 controls whether the end user has the right to decrypt the ECM and<br>
to access the programme. If not, a negative status is passed to the receiver/decoder<br>
2020 to indicate that the programme cannot be dcscrambled. If the end user does<br>
have the rights, the ECM is decrypted and the control word extracted. The decoder<br>
2020 can then descramble the programme using this control word. The MPEG-2<br>
stream is decompressed and translated into a video signal for onward transmission to<br>
television set 2022.<br>
Subscriber Management System (SMS)<br>
A Subscriber Management System (SMS) 3004 includes a database 3024 which<br>
manages, amongst others, all of the end user files, commercial offers (such as tariffs<br>
and promotions), subscriptions, PPV details, and data regarding end user consumption<br>
and authorization. The SMS may be physically remote from the SAS.<br>
Each SMS 3004 transmits messages to the SAS 3002 via respective linkage 3006<br>
which imply modifications to or creations of Entitlement Management Messages<br>
(EMMs) to be transmitted to end users.<br>
The SMS 3004 also transmits messages to the SAS 3002 which imply no<br>
modifications or creations of EMMs but imply only a change in an end user's state<br>
(relating to the authorization granted to the end user when ordering products or to the<br>
amount that the end user will be charged).<br>
As described later, the SAS 3002 sends messages (typically requesting information<br>
such as call-back information or billing information) to the SMS 3004, so that it will<br>
be apparent that communication between the two is two-way.<br>
Entitlement Management Messages (EMMs)<br>
The EMM is a message dedicated to an individual end user (subscriber), or. a group<br>
of end users, only (in contrast with an ECM, which is dedicated to one scrambled<br>
programme only or a set of scrambled programmes if part of the same commercial<br>
offer). Each group may contain a given number of end users. This organisation as<br>
a group aims at optimising the bandwidth; that is, access to one group can permit the<br>
reaching of a great number of end users.<br>
Various specific types of EMM are used in putting the present invention into practice.<br>
Individual EMMs are dedicated to individual subscribers, and are typically used in the<br>
provision of Fay Per View services; these contain the group identifier and the position<br>
of the subscriber in that group. So-called "Group" subscription EMMs arc dedicated<br>
to groups of, say, 256 individual users, and are typically used in the administration of<br>
some subscription services. This EMM has a group identifier and a subscribers'<br>
group bitmap. Audience EMMs are dedicated to entire audiences, and might for<br>
example be used by a particular operator to provide certain free services. An<br>
"audience" is the totality of subscribers having smartcards which bear the same<br>
Operator Identifier (OPI). Finally, a "unique" EMM is addressed to the unique<br>
identifier of the smartcard.<br>
The structure of a typical EMM is now described with reference to Figure 3.<br>
Basically, the EMM, which is implemented as a series of digital data bits, comprises<br>
a header 3060, the EMM proper 3062, and a signature 3064. The header 3060 in turn<br>
comprises a type identifier 3066 to identify whether the type is individual, group,<br>
audience or some other type, a length identifier 3068 which gives the length of the<br>
EMM, an optional address 3070 for the EMM, an operator identifier 3072 and a key<br>
identifier 3074. The EMM proper 3062 of course varies greatly according to its type.<br>
Finally, the signature 3064, which is typically of 8 bytes long, provides a number of<br>
checks against corruption of the remaining data in the EMM.<br>
Subscriber Authorization System (SAS)<br>
The messages generated by the SMS 3004 are passed via linkage 3006 to the<br>
Subscriber Authorization System (SAS) 3002, which in turn generates messages<br>
acknowledging receipt of the messages generated by the SMS 3004 and passes these<br>
acknowledgements to the SMS 3004.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, at the hardware level the SAS comprises in known fashion a<br>
mainframe computer 3050 (in the preferred embodiment a DEC machine) connected<br>
to one or more keyboards 3052 for data and command input, one or more Visual<br>
Display Units (VDUs) 3054 for display of output information and data storage means<br>
3056. Some redundancy in hardware may be provided.<br>
At the software level the SAS runs, in the preferred embodiment on a standard open<br>
VMS operating system, a suite of software whose architecture is now described in<br>
overview with reference to Figure 5; it will be understood that the software could<br>
alteratively be implemented in hardware.<br>
In overview the SAS comprises a Subscription Chain area 3100 to give rights for<br>
subscription mode and to renew the rights automatically each month, a Pay Per View<br>
Chain area 3200 to give rights for PPV events, and an EMM Injector 3300 for passing<br>
EMMs created by the Subscription and PPV chain areas to the multiplexer and<br>
scrambler 2004, and hence to feed the MPEO stream with EMMs. If other rights are<br>
to be granted, such as Pay Per File (PPF) rights in the case of downloading computer<br>
software to a user's Personal Computer, other similar areas are also provided.<br>
One function of the SAS 3002 is to manage the access rights to television<br>
programmes, available as commercial offers in subscription mode or sold as PFV<br>
events according to different modes of commercialisation (pre-book mode, impulse<br>
mode). The SAS 3002, according to those rights and to information received from the<br>
SMS 3004, generates EMMs for the subscriber.<br>
The Subscription Chain area 3100 comprises a Command Interface (Cl) 3102, a<br>
Subscriber Technical Management (STM) server 3104, a Message Generator (MG)<br>
3106, and the Ciphering Unit 3008.<br>
The PPV Chain area 3200 comprises an Authorisation Server (AS) 3202, a relational<br>
database 3204 for storing relevant details of the end users, a local blacklist database<br>
3205, Database Servers 3206 for the database, an Order Centralized Server (OCS)<br>
3207, a Server for Programme Broadcaster (SPB) 3208, a Message Generator (MG)<br>
3210 whose function is basically the same as that for the Subscription Chain area and<br>
is hence not described further in any detail, and the Ciphering Unit 3008.<br>
The EMM Injector 3300 comprises a plurality of Message Emitters (MEs) 3302, 3304,<br>
3306 and 3308 and Software Multiplexers (SMUXs) 3310 and 3312. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, there are two MEs, 3302 and 3304 for the Message Generator 3106, with<br>
the other two MEs 3306 and 3308 for the Message Generator 3210. MEs 3302 and<br>
3306 are connected to the SMUX 3310 whilst MEs 3304 and 3308 are connected to<br>
the SMUX 3312.<br>
Each of the three main components of the SAS (the Subscription Chain area, the PPV<br>
Chain area and the EMM Injector) are now considered in more detail.<br>
Subscription Chain Area<br>
Considering first the Subscription Chain area 3100, the Command Interface 3102 is<br>
primarily for despatching messages from the SMS 3004 to the STM server 3104, as<br>
well as to the OCS 3206, and from the OCS to the SMS. The Command Interface<br>
takes as input from the SMS either direct commands or batch files containing<br>
commands. It performs syntactic analysis on the messages coming from the STM<br>
server, and is able to emit accurate messages when an error occurs in a message<br>
(parameter out of range, missing parameter, and so on). It traces incoming commands<br>
in textual form in a trace file 3110 and also in binary form in a replay file 3112 in<br>
order to be able to replay a series of commands. Traces can be disabled and the size<br>
of files limited.<br>
Detailed discussion of the STM server 3104 is now provided with particular reference<br>
to Figure 6. The STM server is effectively the main engine of the Subscription Chain<br>
area, and has the purpose of managing free rights, the creation of new subscribers and<br>
the renewal of existing subscribers. As shown in the figure, commands are passed on<br>
to the Message Generator 3106, albeit in a different format from that in which the<br>
commands are passed to the STM server. For each command, the STM server is<br>
arranged to send an acknowledgement message to the CI only when the relevant<br>
command has been successfully processed and sent to the MG.<br>
The STM server includes a subscriber database 3120, in which all the relevant<br>
parameters of the subscribers arc stored (smartcard number, commercial offers, state,<br>
group and position in the group, and so on). The database performs semantic checks<br>
of the commands sent by the CI 3102 against the content of the database, and updates<br>
the database when the commands are valid.<br>
The STM server further manages a First In First Out (FIFO) buffer 3122 between the<br>
STM server and the MG, as well as a backup disk FIFO 3124. The purpose of the<br>
FIFOs is to average the flow of commands from the CI if the MG is not able to<br>
respond for a while for any reason. They can also ensure that in the case of a crash<br>
of the STM server or MG no command will be lost, since the STM server is arranged<br>
to empty (that is, send to the MG) its FIFOs when restarted. The FIFOs are<br>
implemented as files.<br>
The STM server includes at its core an automatic renewal server 3126 which<br>
automatically generates renewals, and, if required by the operators, free rights. In this<br>
context, the generation of renewals may be thought of as including the generation of<br>
rights for the first time, although it will be understood that the generation of new<br>
rights is initiated at the SMS. As will become apparent, the two can be treated by<br>
roughly the same commands and EMMs.<br>
Having the STM separate from the SAS, and the automatic renewal server within the<br>
SAS rather than (in known systems) in the SMS 3004, is a particularly important<br>
feature, since it can significantly reduce the number of commands which need to be<br>
passed from the SMS to the SAS (bearing in mind that the SMS and SAS may be in<br>
different locations and operated by different operators). In fact, the two main<br>
commands required from the SMS are merely commands that a new subscription<br>
should be started and that an existing subscription should be stopped (for example in<br>
the case of non-payment). By minimising command exchange between the SMS and<br>
SAS, the possibility of failure of command transfer in the linkage 3006 between the<br>
two is reduced; also, the design of the SMS docs not need to take into account the<br>
features of the conditional access system 3000 generally.<br>
Automatic renewal proceeds in the fashion indicated in the flow diagram of Figure 7.<br>
In order to reduce bandwidth, and given that a very high percentage of all renewals<br>
are standard, renewal proceeds in groups of subscribers; in the preferred embodiments<br>
there arc 256 individual subscribers per group. The flow diagram begins with the start<br>
step 3130, and proceeds to step 3132 where a monthly activation of the renewal<br>
function is made (although of course it will be appreciated that other frequencies are<br>
also possible). With a monthly frequency, rights are given to the end user for the<br>
current month and all of the following month, at which point they expire if not<br>
renewed.<br>
In step 3134 the subscriber database 3120 is accessed in respect of each group and<br>
each individual within that group to determine whether rights for the particular<br>
individual are to be renewed.<br>
In step 3136, a group subscription bitmap is set up according to the contents of the<br>
subscriber database, as shown in Figure 8. The bitmap comprises a group identifier<br>
(in this case Group 1 - "G1") 3138 and 256 individual subscriber zones 3140. The<br>
individual bits is the bitmap are set to 1 or zero according to whether oi not the<br>
particular subscriber is to have his rights renewed. A typical set of binary data is<br>
shown in the figure.<br>
In step 3142 the appropriate commands, including the group subscription bitmap, are<br>
passed to the Message Generator 3106. In step 3143 the Message Generator sets an<br>
obsolescence date to indicate to the smartcard the date beyond which the particular<br>
subscription EMM is not valid; typically this date is set as the end of the next month.<br>
In step 3144 the Message Generator generates from the commands appropriate group<br>
subscription EMMs and asks the Ciphering Unit 3008 to cipher the EMMs, the<br>
ciphered EMMs being then passed to the EMM Injector 3300, which, in step 3146,<br>
injects the EMMs into the MPEG-2 data stream.<br>
Step 3148 indicates that the above described procedure is repeated for each and every<br>
group. The process is finally brought to an end at stop step 3150.<br>
The flow diagram described above with reference to Figure 7 relates in fact<br>
specifically to the renewal of subscriptions. The STM also manages in a similar way<br>
free audience rights and new subscribers.<br>
In the case of free audience rights, available for specific television programmes or<br>
groups of such programmes, these are made available by the STM issuing a command<br>
to the Message Generator to generate appropriate audience EMMs (for a whole<br>
audience) with an obsolescence date a given number of days (or weeks) hence. The<br>
MG computes the precise obsolescence date based on the STM command.<br>
In the case of new subscribers, these are dealt with in two stages. Firstly, on purchase<br>
the smartcard in the receiver/decoder 2020 (if desired by the operator) affords the<br>
subscriber free rights for a given period (typically a few days). This is achieved by<br>
generating a bitmap for the subscriber which includes the relevant obsolescence date.<br>
The subscriber then passes his completed paperwork to the operator managing the<br>
subscriber (at the SMS). Once the paperwork has been processed, the SMS supplies<br>
to the SAS a start command tor that particular subscriber. On receipt by the SAS of<br>
the start command, the STM commands the MG to assign a unique address to the new<br>
subscriber (with a particular group number and position within the group) and to<br>
generate a special, so-called "commercial offer" subscription EMM (as opposed to the<br>
more usual "group" subscription EMM used for renewals) to provide the particular<br>
subscriber with rights until the end of the next month. From this point renewal of the<br>
subscriber can occur automatically as described above. By this two stage process it<br>
is possible to grant new subscribers rights until the SMS issues a stop command.<br>
It is to be noted that the commercial offer subscription EMM is used for new<br>
subscribers and for reactivation of existing subscribers. The group subscription EMM<br>
is used for renewal and suspension purposes.<br>
With reference to Figure 9, a typical subscription EMM proper (that is, ignoring the<br>
header and signature) generated by the above procedure comprises the following main<br>
portions, namely typically a 256 bit subscription (or subscribers' group) bitmap 3152,<br>
128 bits of management ciphering keys 3154 for the ciphering of the EMM, 64 bits<br>
of each exploitation ciphering key 3156 to enable the smartcard 3020 to decipher a<br>
control word to provide access to broadcast programmes, and 16 bits of obsolescence<br>
date 3158 to indicate the date beyond which the smartcard will ignore the EMM. In<br>
fact in the preferred embodiment three exploitation keys are provided, one set for the<br>
present month, one set for the next month, and one for resume purposes in the event<br>
of system failure.<br>
In more detail, the group subscription EMM proper has all of the above components,<br>
except the management ciphering keys 3154. The commercial offer subscription<br>
EMM proper (which is for an individual subscriber) includes instead of the full<br>
subscribers' group bitmap 3152 the group ID followed by the position in the group,<br>
and then management ciphering keys 3154 and three exploitation keys 3156, followed<br>
by the relevant obsolescence date 3158.<br>
The Message Generator 3106 serves to transform commands issued by the STM server<br>
3104 into EMMs for passing to the Message Emitter 3302. With reference to Figure<br>
5, firstly, the MG produces the EMMs proper and passes them to the Ciphering Unit<br>
3008 for ciphering with respect to the management and exploitation keys. The CU<br>
completes the signature 3064 on the EMM (see Figure 3) and passes the EMM back<br>
to the MG, where the header 3060 is added. The EMMs which are passed to the<br>
Message Emitter are thus complete EMMs. The Message Generator also determines<br>
the broadcast start and stop time and the rate of emission of the EMMs, and passes<br>
these as appropriate directions along with the EMMs to the Message Emitter. The<br>
MG only generates a given EMM once; it is the ME which performs its cyclic<br>
transmission.<br>
Again with reference to Figure 5, the Message Generator includes its own EMM<br>
database 3160 which, for the lifetime of the relevant EMM, stores it. It is erased once<br>
its emission duration has expired The database is used to ensure consistency between<br>
the MG and ME, so that for example when an end user is suspended the ME will not<br>
continue to send renewals. In this regard the MG computes the relevant operations<br>
and sends them to the ME.<br>
On generation of an EMM, the MG assigns a unique identifier to the EMM. When<br>
the MG passes the EMM to the ME, it also passes the EMM ID. This enables<br>
identification of a particular EMM at both the MG and the ME.<br>
Also concerning the Subscription Chain area, the Message Generator includes two<br>
FIFOs 3162 and 3164, one for each of the relevant Message Emitters 3302 and 3304<br>
in the EMM Injector 3300, for storing the ciphered EMMs. Since the Subscription<br>
Chain area and EMM Injector may be a significant distance apart, the use of FIFOs<br>
can allow full continuity in EMM transmission even if the links 3166 and 3168<br>
between the two fail. Similar FIFO's are provided in the Pay Per View Chain area.<br>
One particular feature of the Message Generator in particular and the conditional<br>
access system in general concerns the way that It reduces (be length of the EMM<br>
proper 3062 by mixing parameter length and identifier to save space. This is now<br>
described with reference to Figure 10 which illustrates an exemplary EMM (in fact<br>
a PPV EMM, which is the simplest EMM). The reduction in length occurs in the Pid<br>
(Packet or "Parameter" identifier) 3170. This comprises two portions, the actual ID<br>
3172, and the length parameter for the packet 3174 (necessary in order that the start<br>
of the next packet can be identified). The whole Pid is expressed in just one byte of<br>
information, 4 bits being reserved for the ED, and four for the length. Because 4 bits<br>
is not sufficient to define the length in true binary fashion, a different correspondence<br>
between the bits and the actual length is used, this correspondence being represented<br>
in a look-up table, stored in storage area 3178 in the Message Generator (see Figure<br>
5). The correspondence is typically as follows:-<br>
It will be seen that the length parameter is not directly proportional to the actual<br>
length of the packet; the relationship is in part more quadratic rather than linear. This<br>
allows for a greater range of packet length.<br>
Pay Per View Chain Area<br>
Concerning the Pay Per View Chain area 3200, with reference to Figure 5 in more<br>
detail the Authorisation Server 3202 has as its client the Order Centralized Server<br>
3207, which requests information about each subscriber which connects to the<br>
Communications Servers 3022 to purchase a PPV product.<br>
If the subscriber is known from the AS 3202, a set of transactions takes place. If the<br>
subscriber is authorized for the order, the AS creates a bill and sends it to the OCS-<br>
Otherwise, it signals to the OCS that the order is not authorized.<br>
It is only at the end of this set of transactions that the AS updates the end users<br>
database 3204 via the database servers (DBAS) 3206, if at least one transaction was<br>
authorized; this optimizes the number of database accesses.<br>
The criteria according to which the AS authorizes purchase are stored in the database,<br>
accessed through DBAS processes. In one embodiment, the database is the same as<br>
the database accessed by the STM.<br>
Depending on consumer profile, the authorization may be denied<br>
(PPV_Forbidden,Casino_Forbidden ...). These kind of criteria are updated by STM<br>
3104, on behalf of the SMS 3004.<br>
Other parameters are checked, such as limits allowed for purchase (cither by credit<br>
card, automatic payment, or number of authorized token purchases per day).<br>
In case of payment with a credit card, the number of the card is checked against a<br>
local blacklist stored in the local blacklist database 3205.<br>
When all the verifications are successful, the AS:-<br>
1. Generates a bill and sends it to the OCS, which completes this bill and stores<br>
it in a file, this file being later sent to the SMS for processing (customer actual<br>
billing); and<br>
2. Updates the database, mainly to set new purchase limits.<br>
This check-and-generate-bill-if-OK mechanism applies for each command a<br>
subscriber may request during a single connection (it is possible to order e.g. 5 movies<br>
in a single session).<br>
It is to be noted that the AS has a reduced amount of information concerning the<br>
subscriber, by comparison with that held by the SMS. For example, the AS does not<br>
hold the name or address of the subscriber. On the other hand, the AS does hold the<br>
smartcard number of the subscriber, the subscriber's consumer category (so that<br>
different offers can be made to different subscribers), and various flags which state<br>
whether, for example, the subscriber may purchase on credit, or he is suspended or his<br>
smartcard has been stolen. Use of a reduced amount of information can help to<br>
reduce the amount of time taken to authorize a particular subscriber request.<br>
The main purpose of the DBASs 3206 is to increase database performance seen from<br>
the AS, by paralleling the accesses (so actually it does not make much sense to define<br>
a configuration with only one DBAS). An AS parameter determines how many<br>
DBASes should connect. A given DBAS may be connected to only one AS.<br>
The OCS 2307 mainly deals with PPV commands. It operates in several modes.<br>
Firstly, it operates to process commands issued by the SMS, such as product<br>
refreshment (for instance, if the bill is already stored by the SMS, no bill is generated<br>
by the OCS), update of the wallet in the smartcard 3020, and session<br>
cancellation/update.<br>
The various steps in the procedure are:-<br>
1. Identifying the relevant subscriber (using the AS 3202);<br>
2. If valid, generate adequate commands to the Message Generator, in order to<br>
send an appropriate EMM. Commands may be:<br>
Product commands,<br>
Update of the wallet,<br>
Session erasure.<br>
Note that these operations do not imply creation of billing information, since billing<br>
is already known from the SMS. These operations are assimilated to "free products"<br>
purchase.<br>
Secondly, the OCS deals with commands received from the subscribers through the<br>
Communications Servers 3022. These may be received either via a modem connected<br>
to the receiver/decoder 2020, or by voice activation via the telephone 4001, or by key<br>
activation via a MINITEL, PRESTEL or like system whtre available.<br>
Thirdly, the OCS deals with callback requests issued by the SMS. These last two<br>
modes of operation are now discussed in more detail.<br>
In the second type of mode described above it was stated that the OCS deals with<br>
commands received directly from the end user (subscriber) through the<br>
Communications Servers 3022. These include product orders (such as for a particular<br>
PPV event), a subscription modification requested by the subscriber, and a reset of a<br>
parental code (a parental code being a code by which parents may restrict the right of<br>
access to certain programmes or classes of programmes).<br>
The way in which these commands arc dealt with is now described in more detail with<br>
reference to Figure 11.<br>
Product orders by a subscriber involve the following steps:<br>
1. Identifying through the AS the caller who is making a call through the CS<br>
3022 ordering a particular product;<br>
2. Checking the caller's request validity, again using the AS (where the order is<br>
placed using the receiver/decoder 2020, this is achieved by verifying the<br>
smartcard 3020 details);<br>
3. Ascertain the price of the purchase;<br>
4. Check that the price does not exceed the caller's credit limit etc;<br>
5. Receiving a partial bill from the AS;<br>
6. Filling additional fields in the bill to form a completed bill;<br>
7. Adding the completed bill to a billing information storage file 3212 for later<br>
processing; and<br>
S. Sending corresponding command(s) to the PPV Message Generator 3210 to<br>
generate the relevant EMM(s).<br>
The EMM(s) is sent either on the modem line 4002 if the consumer placed the<br>
product order using the receiver/decoder 2020 (more details of this are described<br>
later), or else it is broadcast. The one exception to this is where there is some failure<br>
of the modem connection (in the case where the consumer places the order using the<br>
receiver/decoder); in this event the EMM is broadcast over the air.<br>
A subscription modification requested by a subscriber involves:<br>
1. Identifying the caller (using the AS);<br>
2. Sending information to the Command Interface; the CI in turn forwards this<br>
information to the SMS; and<br>
3. Via the CI, the OCS then receives an answer from the SMS (in terms of the<br>
cost of the modification, if the modification is possible).<br>
If modification was requested using the receiver/decoder, the OCS generates a<br>
confirmation to the SMS. Otherwise, fox example in the case of phone or Minitel, the<br>
subscriber is prompted for confirmation and this answer sent to the SMS via the OCS<br>
and the CI.<br>
Reset of a parental code involves:<br>
1. Identifying the caller (using AS); and<br>
2. Sending a command to the MG to generate an appropriate EMM bearing an<br>
appropriate reset password.<br>
In the case of reset of parental code, the command to reset the code is for security<br>
reasons not permitted to originate from the receiver/decoder. Only the SMS,<br>
telephone and MINITEL or like can originate such a command. Hence in this<br>
particular case the EMM(s) are broadcast only on air, never on the telephone line.<br>
It will be understood from the above examples of different modes of operation of the<br>
OCS that the user can have direct access to the SAS, and in particular the OCS and<br>
AS, in that the Communications Servers are directly connected to the SAS, and in<br>
particular the OCS. This important feature is concerned with reducing the time for<br>
the user to communicate his command to the SAS.<br>
This feature is illustrated further with reference to Figure 12, from which it can be<br>
seen that the end user's Sct-Top-Box, and in particular its receiver/decoder 2020, has<br>
the capability of communicating directly with the Communications Servers 3022<br>
associated with the SAS 3002. Instead of the connection from the end user to the<br>
Communications Servers 3022 of the SAS 3002 being through the SMS 3004 the<br>
connection is directly to the SAS 3002.<br>
In fact, as directly mentioned two direct connections are provided.<br>
The first direct connection is by a voice link via a telephone 4001 and appropriate<br>
telephone line (and/or by MINITEL or like connection where available) where the end<br>
users still have to input a series of voice commands or code numbers but time is saved<br>
compared with the communication being via the SMS 3004.<br>
The second direct connection is from the receiver/decoder 2020 and the input of data<br>
is achieved automatically by the end user inserting his own daughter smartcard 3020<br>
thus relieving the end user of the job of having to input the relevant data which in<br>
rum reduces the time taken and the likelihood of errors in making that input.<br>
A further important feature which arises out of the above discussion is concerned with<br>
reducing the time taken for the resulting EMM to be transmitted to the end user in<br>
order to initiate viewing by the end user of the selected product.<br>
In broad terms, and with reference to Figure 12, the feature is again achieved by<br>
providing the end user's receiver/decoder 2020 with the capability of communicating<br>
directly with the Communications Servers 3022 associated with the SAS 3002.<br>
As described earlier the integrated receiver/decoder 2020 is connected directly to the<br>
Communications Servers 3022 by the modemmed back channel 4002 so that<br>
commands from the decoder 2020 are processed by the SAS 3002, messages generated<br>
(including EMMs) and then sent back directly to the decoder 2020 through the back<br>
channel 4002. A protocol is used in the communication between the CS 3022 and the<br>
receiver/decoder 2020 (as described later), so that the CS receive acknowledgement<br>
of receipt of the relevant EMM, thereby adding certainty to the procedure.<br>
Thus, for example, in the case of a pre-book mode the SAS 3002 receives messages<br>
from the end user via the smartcard and decoder 2020 via its modem and via the<br>
telephone line 4002, requesting access to a specific event/product, and returns a<br>
suitable EMM via the telephone line 4002 and modem to the decoder 2020, the<br>
modem and decoder being preferably located together in a Set-Top-Box (STB). This<br>
is thus achieved without having to transmit the EMM in the MPEG-2 data stream<br>
2002 via the multiplexer and scrambler 2004, the uplink 2012, satellite 2014 and<br>
datalink 2016 to enable the end user to view the event/product. This can save<br>
considerably on time and bandwidth. Virtual certainty is provided that as soon as the<br>
subscriber has paid for his purchase the EMM will arrive at the receiver/decoder 2020.<br>
In the third type of mode of operation of the OCS 3207 described above, the OCS<br>
deals with callback requests issued by the SAS. This is illustrated with reference to<br>
Figure 13. Typical callback requests have the purpose of ensuring that the<br>
receiver/decoder 2020 calls back the SAS via the modemmed back channel 4002 with<br>
the information that the SAS requires of the receiver /decoder.<br>
As instructed by the Command Interface 3102, the subscription chain Message<br>
Generator 3106 generates and sends to the receiver/decoder 202 a callback EMM.<br>
This EMM is ciphered by the Ciphering Unit 3008 for security reasons. The EMM<br>
may contain the time/date at which the receiver/decoder should wake up and perform<br>
a callback on its own, without being explicitly solicited; the EMM may also typically<br>
contain the phone numbers which the terminal must dial, the number of further<br>
attempts after unsuccessful calls and the delay between two calls.<br>
When receiving the EMM, or at the specified tune-date, the receiver/decoder connects<br>
to the Communications Servers 3022. The OCS 3207 first identifies the caller, using<br>
the AS 3202, and verifies certain details, such as smartcard operator and subscriber<br>
details. The OCS then asks the smartcard 3020 to send various ciphered information<br>
(such as the relevant session numbers, when the session was watched, how many times<br>
the subscriber is allowed to view the session again, the way in which the session was<br>
viewed, the number of remaining tokens, the number of prebooked sessions, etc). This<br>
information is deciphered by the PPV chain Message Generator 3210, again using the<br>
Ciphering Unit 3008. The OCS adds this information to a callback information<br>
storage file 3214 for later processing and passing to the SMS 3004. The information<br>
is ciphered for security reasons. The whole procedure is repeated until there is<br>
nothing more to be read from the smartcard.<br>
One particular preferred feature of the callback facility is that before reading the<br>
smartcard (so just after the identification of the caller using the AS 3202 as described<br>
above) a check is made by the SAS 3002 that the receiver/decoder is indeed a genuine<br>
one rather than a pirated version or computer simulation. Such a check is carded out<br>
in the following manner. The SAS generates a random number, which is received by<br>
the receiver/decoder, ciphered, and then returned to the SAS. The SAS deciphers this<br>
number. If the deciphering is successful and the original random number is retrieved,<br>
it is concluded that the receiver/decoder is genuine, and the procedure continues.<br>
Otherwise, the procedure is discontinued.<br>
Other functions which may occur during the callback are erasure of obsolete sessions<br>
on the smartcard, or filling of the wallet (this latter also being described later under<br>
the section entitled "Smartcard").<br>
Also as regards the Pay Per View Chain area 3200, description is now made of the<br>
Communications Servers 3022. At the hardware level, these comprise in the preferred<br>
embodiment a DEC Four parallel processor machine. At the software architecture<br>
level, with reference to Figure 14, in many respects the Communications Servers are<br>
conventional. One particular divergence from conventional designs arises from the<br>
fact that the Servers must serve both receiver/decoders 2020 and voice communication<br>
with conventional telephones 4001, as well possibly as MINITEL or like systems.<br>
It will be noted in passing that two Order Centralized Servers 3207 are shown in<br>
Figure 14 (as "OCS1" and "OCS2"). Naturally any desired number may be provided.<br>
The Communication Servers include two main servers ("CS1" and "CS2") as well as<br>
a number of frontal servers ("Frontal 1" and "Frontal 2"); whilst two frontal servers<br>
are shown in the figure, typically 10 or 12 may be provided per main server. Indeed,<br>
although two main servers CS1 and CS2 and two frontal servers, Frontal 1 and Frontal<br>
2, have been shown, any number could be used. Some redundancy is usually<br>
desirable.<br>
CS1 and CS2 are coupled to OCS1 and OCS2 via high level TCP/IP links 3230,<br>
whilst CS1 and CS2 are coupled to Frontal 1 and Frontal 2 via further TCP/IP links<br>
3232.<br>
As illustrated, CS1 and CS2 comprise servers for "SENDR" (transmission), "RECVR"<br>
(reception), "VTX" (MINITEL, PRESTEL or the like), "VOX" (voice<br>
communication), and "TRM" (communication with the receiver/decoder). These are<br>
coupled to the "BUS" for communication of signals to the Frontal servers.<br>
CS1 and CS2 communicate directly with the receiver/decoders 2020 via their<br>
modemmed back channels 4002 using the X25 public network common protocol. The<br>
relatively low-level protocol between the Communications Servers 3022 and the<br>
receiver/decoders 3020 is in one preferred embodiment based upon the V42 standard<br>
international CCITT protocol, which provides reliability by having error detection and<br>
data re-transmission facilities, and uses a checksum routine to check the integrity of<br>
the re-transmission. An escape mechanism is also provided in order to prevent the<br>
transmission of disallowed characters.<br>
On the other hand, voice telephone communication is carried out via the frontal<br>
Communications Servers, each capable of picking up, say, 30 simultaneous voice<br>
connections from the connection 3234 to the local telephone network via the high<br>
speed "T2" (El) standard telephony ISDN lines.<br>
Three particular functions of the software portion of the Communications Servers<br>
(which could of course alternatively be implemented fully in hardware) are firstly to<br>
convert the relatively low level protocol information received from the<br>
receiver/decoder into the relatively high level protocol information output to the OCS,<br>
secondly to attenuate or control the number of simultaneous connections being made,<br>
and thirdly to provide several simultaneous channels without any mixing. In this last<br>
regard, the Communications Servers play the role of a form of multiplexer, with the<br>
interactions in a particular channel being defined by a given Session ED (identifier),<br>
which is in fact used throughout the communication chain.<br>
Finally as regards the Pay Per View Chain area 3200, and with reference again to<br>
Figure 5, the Server for Programme Broadcast (SPB) 3208 is coupled to one or more<br>
Programme Broadcasters 3250 (which would typically be located remotely from the<br>
SAS) to receive programme information. The SPB filters out for further use<br>
information corresponding to PPV events (sessions).<br>
A particularly important feature is that the filtered programme event information is<br>
passed by the SPB to the MG which in turn sends a directive (control command) to<br>
the ME to change the rate of cyclic emission of the EMMs in given circumstances;<br>
this is done by the ME finding all EMMs with the relevant session identifier and<br>
changing the cycle rate allocated to such EMMs. This feature might be thought of as<br>
a dynamic allocation of bandwidth for specific EMMs. Cyclic EMM emission is<br>
discussed in more detail in the section below concerned with the EMM Injector.<br>
The circumstances in which the cycle rate is changed are now described with reference<br>
to Figure 15, which demonstrates how cycle rate 3252 is raised a short while (say 10<br>
minutes) before a particular PPV programme event until the end of the event from a<br>
slow cycle rate of say once every 30 minutes to a fast cycle rate of say once every 30<br>
seconds to 1 minute in order to meet the anticipated extra user demand for PPV events<br>
at those times. In this way bandwidth can be allocated dynamically according to the<br>
anticipated user demand. This can assist in reducing the overall bandwidth<br>
requirement.<br>
The cycle rate of other EMMs may also be varied. For example the cycle rate of<br>
subscription EMMs may be varied by the Multiplexer and Scrambler 2004 sending the<br>
appropriate bitrate directive.<br>
EMM Iniector<br>
Concerning the EMM Injector 3300, details of the Message Emitters 3302 to 3308,<br>
forming part of the EMM Injector and acting as output means for the Message<br>
Generator, are now described with reference to Figure 16. Their function is take the<br>
EMMs and to pass them cyclically (in the manner of a carousel) via respective links<br>
3314 and 3316 to the Software Multiplexers 3310 and 3312 and thence to the<br>
hardware multiplexers and scramblers 2004. In return the software multiplexers and<br>
scramblers 2004 generate a global bitrate directive to control the overall cycling rate<br>
of the EMMs; to do so, the MEs take into account various parameters such as the<br>
cycle time, the size of EMM, and so on. In the figure, EMM_X and EMM _Y are<br>
group EMMs for operators X and Y, whilst EMM_Z are other EMMs for either<br>
operator X or operator Y.<br>
Further description proceeds for an exemplary one of the Message Emitters; it will be<br>
appreciated that the remaining MEs operate in similar fashion. The ME operates<br>
under control of directives from the MG, most notably transmission start and stop time<br>
and emission rate, as well as session number if the EMM is a PPV EMM. In relation<br>
to the emission rate, in the preferred embodiment the relevant directive may take one<br>
of five values from Very fast to Very slow. The numeric values are not specified in<br>
the directive, but rather the ME maps the directive to an actual numeric value which<br>
is supplied by the relevant part of the SAS. In the preferred embodiment, the 5<br>
emission rates are as follows:-<br>
1. Very fast - every 30 seconds<br>
2. Fast - every minute<br>
3. Medium - every 15 minutes<br>
4. Slow - every 30 minutes<br>
5. Very slow - every 30 minutes<br>
The ME has first and second databases 3320 and 3322. The first database is for those<br>
EMMs which have not yet achieved their broadcast date; these axe stored in a series<br>
of chronological files in the database. The second database is for EMMs for<br>
immediate broadcast. In the event of a system crash, the ME is arranged to have the<br>
ability to re-read the relevant stored file and perform correct broadcast. All the files<br>
stored in the databases are updated upon request from the MG, when the MG wishes<br>
to maintain consistency between incoming directives and EMMs already sent to the<br>
ME. The EMMs actually being broadcast are also stored in Random Access Memory<br>
3324.<br>
A combination of the FIFOs 3162 and 3164 in the Message Generator and the<br>
databases 3320 and 3322 in the Message Emitter means that the two can operate in<br>
standalone mode if the link 3166 between them is temporarily brakes', the ME can<br>
still broadcast EMMs.<br>
The Software Multiplexers (SMUX) 3310 and 3312 provide an interface between the<br>
MEs and the hardware multiplexers 2004. In the preferred embodiment, they each<br>
receive EMMs from two of the MEs, although in general there is no restriction on the<br>
number of MEs that can be connected with one SMUX. The SMUXs concentrate the<br>
EMMs and then pass them according to the type of EMM to the appropriate hardware<br>
multiplexer. This is necessary because the hardware multiplexers take the different<br>
types of EMMs and place them at different places in the MPEG-2 stream. The<br>
SMUX's also forward global bitrate directives from the hardware multiplexers to the<br>
MEs.<br>
One particularly important feature of the ME is that it emits EMMs in random order.<br>
The reason for this is as follows. The Message Emitter has no ability to sense or<br>
control what it emits to the multiplexer. Hence it is possible that it may transmit two<br>
EMMs which are to be received and decoded by the receiver/decoder 2020 back to<br>
back. In such circumstances, further, it is possible that if the EMMs are insufficiently<br>
separated the receiver/decoder and smartcard will be unable to sense and decode<br>
properly the second of the EMMs. Cyclically emitting the EMMs in random order<br>
can solve this problem.<br>
The manner in which randomization is achieved is now described with reference to<br>
Figure 17; in the preferred embodiment the necessary software logic is implemented<br>
in the ADA computer language. A particularly important part of the randomization<br>
is the correct storage of the EMMs in the databases 3320 and 3322 (which arc used<br>
for backup purposes) and in the RAM 3324. For a particular cycle rate and operator,<br>
the EMMs are stored in a two-dimensional array, by rank 3330 (going say from A to<br>
Z) and number in the rank 3332 (going from 0 to N). A third dimension is added by<br>
cycle rate 3334, so that there are as many two-dimensional arrays as there arc cycle<br>
rates. In the preferred embodiment there are 236 ranks and typically 200 or 300<br>
EMMs in each rank; there are 5 cycle rates. A final dimension to the array is added<br>
by the presence of different operators; there are as many three-dimensional arrays as<br>
there are operators. Storage of the data in this fashion can permit rapid retrieval in<br>
the event that the MG wants to delete a particular EMM.<br>
Storage of the EMMs takes place according to the "hash" algorithm (otherwise known<br>
as the "one-way hash function". This operates on a modulo approach, so that<br>
successive ranks are filled before a higher number in the rank is used, and the number<br>
of EMMs in each rank remains roughly constant. The example is considered of there<br>
being 256 ranks. When the MG sends the ME an EMM with identifer (ID) 1, the<br>
rank "1" is assigned to this EMM, and it takes the first number 3332 in the rank 3330.<br>
The EMM with ID 2 is assigned the rank "2", and so on, up to the rank 256. The<br>
EMM with ID 257 is assigned the rank "1" again (based on the modulo function), and<br>
takes the second number in the first rank, and so on.<br>
Retrieval of a specific EMM, for example when deletion of a specific EMM is<br>
requested by the MG, is effected by means of the Inverse of the above. The hash<br>
algorithm is applied to the EMM ID to obtain the rank, after which the number in the<br>
rank is found.<br>
The actual randomization occurs when the EMMs arc, on a cyclical basis, retrieved<br>
from RAM 3324 using the randomization means 3340 which is implemented in the<br>
hardware and/or software of the Message Emitter. The retrieval is random, and again<br>
based on the hash algorithm. Firstly, a random number (in the above example initially<br>
in the range 1 to 256) is chosen, to yield the particular rank of interest. Secondly, a<br>
further random number is chosen to yield the particular number in the rank. The<br>
further random number is selected according to the total number of EMMs in a given<br>
rank. Once a given EMM has been selected and broadcast, it is moved to a second<br>
identical storage area in the RAM 3324, again using the hash function. Hence the<br>
first area diminishes in size as the EMMs are broadcast, to the extent that, once a<br>
complete rank has been used, this is deleted. Once the first storage area is completely<br>
empty, it is replaced by the second storage area before a new round of EMM<br>
broadcast, and vice versa.<br>
In the above fashion, after two or three cycles of the EMMs, statistically the chances<br>
of any two EMMs destined for the same end user being transmitted back to back is<br>
negligible.<br>
At regular intervals whilst the EMMs are being stored the computer 3050 computes<br>
the number of bytes in storage and from this computes the bitrate of emission given<br>
the global bitrate directive from the multiplexer and software multiplexer.<br>
Reference was made above to the backup databases 3320 and 3322. These are in fact<br>
in the preferred embodiment sequential file stores, which hold a backup version of<br>
what is in the RAM 3324. In the event of failure of the Message Emitter and<br>
subsequent restart, or more generally when the ME is being restarted for whatever<br>
reason, a link is made between the RAM and the databases, over which the stared<br>
EMMs are uploaded to RAM. In this way, the risk of losing EMMs in the event of<br>
failure can be removed.<br>
Similar storage of PPV EMMs occurs to that described above in relation to<br>
subscription EMMs, with the rank typically corresponding to a given operator and the<br>
number in the rank corresponding to the session number.<br>
Smartcard<br>
A daughter, or "subscriber", smartcard 3020 is schematically shown in Figure 18 and<br>
comprises an 8 bit microprocessor 110, such as a Motorola 6805 microprocessor,<br>
having an input/output bus coupled to a standard array of contacts 120 which in use<br>
are connected to a corresponding array of contacts in the card reader of the<br>
receiver/decoder 2020, the card reader being of conventional design. The<br>
microprocessor 110 is also provided with bus connections to preferably masked ROM<br>
130, RAM 140 and EEPROM 150. The smartcard complies with the ISO 7816-1,<br>
7816-2 and 7816-3 standard protocols which determine certain physical parameters<br>
of the smartcard, the positions of the contacts on the chip and certain communications<br>
between the external system (and particularly the receiver/decoder 2020) and the<br>
smartcard respectively and which will therefore not be further described here. One<br>
function of the microprocessor 110 is to manage the memory in the smartcard, as now<br>
described.<br>
The EEPROM 150 contains certain dynamically-created operator zones 154, 155, 156<br>
and dynamically-created data zones which will now be described with reference to<br>
Figure 19.<br>
Referring to Figure 19, EEPROM 150 comprises a permanent "card ID" (or<br>
manufacturer) zone 151 of 8 bytes which contains a permanent subscriber smartcard<br>
identifier set by the manufacturer of the smartcard 3020.<br>
When the smartcard is reset, the microprocessor 110 issues a signal to<br>
receiver/decoder 2020, the signal comprising an identifier of the conditional access<br>
system used by the smartcard and data generated from data stored in the smartcard,<br>
including the card ID. This signal is stored by the receiver/decoder 2020, which<br>
subsequently utilises the stored signal to check whether the smartcard is compatible<br>
with the conditional access system used by the receiver/decoder 2020.<br>
The EEPROM 150 also contains a permanent "random number generator" zone 152<br>
which contains a program for generating pseudo-random numbers. Such random<br>
numbers are used for diversifying transaction output signals generated by the<br>
smartcard 3020 and sent back to the broadcaster.<br>
Below the random number generator zone 152 a permanent "management" zone 153<br>
of 144 bytes is provided. The permanent management zone 153 is a specific operator<br>
zone utilised by a program in the ROM 130 in the dynamic creation (and removal) of<br>
zones 154, 155, 156... as described below. The permanent management zone 153<br>
contains data relating to the rights of the smartcard to create or remove zones.<br>
The program for dynamically creating and removing zones is responsive to specific<br>
zone creation (or removal) EMMs which arc transmitted by the SAS 3002 and<br>
received by the receiver/decoder 2020 and passed to the subscriber smartcard 3020.<br>
In order to create the EMMs the operator requires specific keys dedicated to the<br>
management zone. This prevents one operator from deleting zones relating to another<br>
operator.<br>
Below the management zone 153 is a series of "operator ID" zones 154, 155, 156 for<br>
operators 1, 2.....N respectively. Normally at least one operator ID zone will be<br>
preloaded into the EEPROM of the subscriber smartcard 3020 so that the end user can<br>
decrypt programmes broadcast by that operator. However further operator ID zones<br>
can subsequently be dynamically created using the management zone 153 in response<br>
to a transaction output signal generated via his smartcard 3020 by the end user<br>
(subscriber), as will subsequently be described.<br>
Each operator zone 154, 155, 156 contains the identifier of the group to which the<br>
smartcard 3020 belongs, and the position of the smartcard within the group. This data<br>
enables the smartcard (along with the other smartcards in its group) to be responsive<br>
to a broadcast "group" subscription EMM having that group's address (but not the<br>
smartcard's position in the group) as well as to an "individual" (or commercial offers<br>
subscription) EMM addressed only to that smartcard within the group. There can be<br>
256 member smartcards of each such group and this feature therefore reduces<br>
significantly the bandwidth required for broadcasting EMMs.<br>
in order to reduce further the bandwidth required for broadcasting "group" subscription<br>
EMMs, the group data in each operator zone 154, 155, 156 and all similar zones in<br>
the EEPROM of smartcard 3020 and the other daughter smartcards is continually<br>
updated to enable a particular smartcard to change its position in each group to fill<br>
any holes created by e.g. deletion of a member of the group, the holes are filled by<br>
the SAS 3002 as in the STM server 3104 there is a list of such holes.<br>
In this manner fragmentation is reduced and each group's membership is maintained<br>
at or near the maximum of 256 members.<br>
Each operator zone 154, 155, 156 is associated with one or more "operator data<br>
objects" stored in the EEPROM 150. As shown in Figure 19, a series of dynamically<br>
created "operator data" objects 157-165 are located below the operator ID zones.<br>
Each of these objects is labelled with:<br>
a) an "identifier" 1, 2, 3 .... N corresponding to its associated operator 1, 2, 3 ...<br>
N as shown in its left hand section in Figure 19;<br>
b) an "ID" indicating the type of object; and<br>
c) a "data" zone reserved for data, as shown in the right hand section of each<br>
relevant operator object in Figure 19. It should be understood that each operator is<br>
associated with a similar set of data objects so that the following description of the<br>
types of data in the data objects of operator 1 is also applicable to the data objects of<br>
all the other operators. Also it will be noted that the data objects are located in<br>
contiguous physical regions of the EEPROM and that their order is immaterial.<br>
Deletion of a data object creates a "hole" 166 in the smartcard, that is, the number of<br>
bytes that the deleted objects had previously occupied are not immediately occupied.<br>
The thus "freed" number of bytes, or "hole" arc labelled with:<br>
a) an "identifier" 0; and<br>
b) an "ID" indicating that the bytes are free to receive an object.<br>
The next data object created fills the hole, as identified by the identifier 0. In this<br>
manner the limited memory capacity (4 kilobytes) of the EEPROM 150 is efficiently<br>
utilised.<br>
Turning now to the set of data objects associated with each operator, examples of the<br>
data objects are now described.<br>
Data object 157 contains an EMM key used for decrypting encrypted EMM's received<br>
by the receiver/decoder 2020. This EMM key is permanently stored in the data object<br>
157. This data object 157 may be created prior to distribution of the smartcard 3020,<br>
and/or may be created dynamically when creating a new operator zone (as described<br>
above).<br>
Data object 159 contains ECM keys which arc sent by the associated operator (in this<br>
case operator 1) to enable the end user to decrypt the particular "bouquet" of programs<br>
to which he has subscribed. New ECM keys are sent typically every month, along<br>
with a group subscription (renewal) EMM which renews the end user's overall right<br>
to view the broadcast from (in this case) operator 1. The use of separate EMM and<br>
ECM keys enables viewing rights to be purchased in different ways (in this<br>
embodiment by subscription and individually (Pay Per View)) and also increases<br>
security. The Pay Per View (PPV) mode will be described subsequently.<br>
Since new ECM keys are sent periodically, it is essential to prevent a user from using<br>
old ECM keys, for example by switching off the receiver/decoder or re-setting a clock<br>
to prevent expiry of an old ECM key so that a timer in the receiver/decoder 2020<br>
could be overridden. Accordingly operator zone 154 comprises an area (typically<br>
having a size of 2 bytes) containing an obsolescence date of the ECM keys. The<br>
smartcard 3020 is arranged to compare this date with the current date which is<br>
contained in received ECMs and to prevent decryption if the current date is later than<br>
the obsolescence date. The obsolescence date is transmitted via EMMs, as described<br>
above.<br>
Data object 161 contains a 64 bit subscription bitmap which is an exact representation<br>
of the broadcast operator's programs to which the subscriber has subscribed. Every bit<br>
represents a program and is set to "1" if it is subscribed to and "0" if it is not.<br>
Data object 163 contains a quantity of tokens which can be used by the consumer in<br>
PPV mode to buy viewing rights to an imminent broadcast e.g. in response to a free<br>
preview or other advertisement. Data object 163 also contains a limit value, which<br>
may be set to e.g. a negative value to allow credit to the consumer. Tokens can be<br>
purchased e.g. by credit and via the modemmed back channel 4002, or by using a<br>
voice server in combination with a credit card, for example. A particular event can<br>
be charged as one token or a number of tokens.<br>
Data object 165 contains a description of a PPV event, as shown with reference to<br>
table 167 of Figure 20.<br>
The PPV event description 167 contains a "session ID" 168 identifying the viewing<br>
session (corresponding to the program and the time and date of broadcasting) a<br>
"session mode" 169 indicating how the viewing right is being purchased (e.g. in pre-<br>
book mode), a "session index" 170 and a "session view" 171.<br>
In respect of receiving a programme in PPV mode, the receiver decoder 2020<br>
determines whether the programme is one sold in PPV mode. If so, the decoder 2020<br>
checks, using the items stored in the PPV event description 167 whether the session<br>
ID for the programme is stored therein. If the session ID is stored therein, the control<br>
word is extracted from the ECM.<br>
If the session ID is not stored therein, by means of a specific application the<br>
receiver/decoder 2020 displays a message to the end user indicating that he has the<br>
right to view the session at a cost of; say, 25 tokens, as read from the ECM or to<br>
connect to the communications servers 3022 to purchase the event. Using the tokens,<br>
if the end user answers "yes" (by means of remote controller 2026 (see Figure 2)) the<br>
decoder 2020 sends the ECM to the smartcard, the smartcatd decreases the wallet of<br>
the smartcard 3020 by 25 tokens, writes the session ID 168, the session mode 169, the<br>
session index 170 and the session view 171 in the PPV event description 167 and<br>
extracts and deciphers the control word from the ECM.<br>
In the "pre-book" mode, an EMM will be passed to the smartcard 3020 so that the<br>
smartcard will write the session ID 168, the session mode 169, the session index 170<br>
and the session view 171 in the PPV event description 167 using the EMM.<br>
The session index 170 can be set to differentiate one broadcast from the other. This<br>
feature permits authorization to be given for a subset of broadcasts, for example, 3<br>
times out of 5 broadcasts. As soon as an ECM with a session index different from<br>
the current session index 170 stored in the PPV event description 167 is passed to the<br>
smartcard, the number of the session view 171 is decreased by one. When the session<br>
view reaches zero, the smartcard will refuse to decipher an ECM with a different<br>
session index to the current session index.<br>
The initial value of the session view depends only on the way in which the broadcast<br>
supplier wishes to define the event to which it relates; the session view for a<br>
respective event may take any value.<br>
The microprocessor 110 in the smartcard implements a counting and a comparison<br>
program to detect when the limit to the number of viewings of a particular program<br>
has been reached.<br>
Alt of the session ID 168, the session mode 169, the session index 170 and the session<br>
view 171 is the PPV event description 167 may be extracted from the smartcard using<br>
the "call-back" procedure as described previously.<br>
Each receiver/decoder 2020 contains an identifier which may either identify uniquely<br>
that receiver/decoder or identify its manufacturer or may classify it in some other way<br>
in order to enable it to work only with a particular individual smartcard, a particular<br>
class of smartcards made by the same or a corresponding manufacturer or any other<br>
class of smartcards which are intended for use with that class of receiver/decoders<br>
exclusively.<br>
In this manner the receiver/decoders 2020 which have been supplied by one broadcast<br>
supplier to the consumer are protected against the use of non-authorised daughter<br>
smartcards 3020.<br>
Additionally or alternatively to this first "handshake" between the smartcard and the<br>
receiver, the EEPROM of the smartcard 3020 could contain a field or bitmap<br>
describing the categories of receiver/decoders 2020 with which it can function. These<br>
could be specified either during the manufacture of the smartcard 3020 or by a<br>
specific EMM.<br>
The bitmap stored in the smartcard 3020 typically comprises a list of up to 80<br>
receiver/decoders, each identified with a corresponding receiver/decoder ID with which<br>
the smartcard may be used. Associated with each receiver/decoder is a level "1" or<br>
"0" indicating whether the smartcard may be used with the receiver/decoder or not,<br>
respectively. A program in the memory 2024 of the receiver/decoder searches for the<br>
identifier of the receiver/decoder in the bitmap stored in the smartcard. If the<br>
identifier is found, and the value associated with the identifier is "1", then the<br>
smartcard is "enabled"; if not, then the smartcard will not function with that<br>
receiver/decoder.<br>
In addition, if, typically because of an agreement between operators, it is desired to<br>
authorize the use of other smartcards in a particular receiver/decoder, specific EMMs<br>
will be sent to those smartcards to change their bitmap via the transponder 2014.<br>
Each broadcast supplier may differentiate his subscribers according to certain<br>
predetermined criteria. For example, a number of subscribers may be classed as<br>
"VIPs". Accordingly, each broadcast supplier may divide his subscribers into a<br>
plurality of subsets, each subset comprising any number of subscribers.<br>
The subset to which a particular subscriber belongs is set in the SMS 3004. In turn,<br>
the SAS 3002 transmits an EMM to the subscriber which writes information (typically<br>
of length 1 byte) concerning the subset to which the subscriber belongs into the<br>
relevant operator data zone, say 154, of the EEPROM of the smartcard. In turn, as<br>
events are broadcast by the broadcast supplier, an ECM, typically of 256 bits, is<br>
transmitted with the event and indicating which of the subsets of subscribers may view<br>
the event. If, according to the information stored in the operator zone, the subscriber<br>
does not have the right to view the event, as determined by the ECM, programme<br>
viewing is denied.<br>
This facility may be used, for example, to switch off all of a given operator's<br>
smartcards in a particular geographical region during the transmission of a particular<br>
program, in particular a program relating to a sports fixture taking place in that<br>
geographical region. In this manner football clubs and other sport bodies can sell<br>
broadcasting rights outside their locality whilst preventing local supporters from<br>
viewing the fixture on television. In this manner the local supporters are encouraged<br>
to buy tickets and attend the fixture.<br>
Each of the features associated with zones 151 to 172 is considered to be a separate<br>
invention independent of the dynamic creation of zones.<br>
It will be understood that the present invention has been described above purely by<br>
way of example, and modifications of detail can be made within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Each feature disclosed in the description, and (where appropriate) the claims and<br>
drawings may be provided independently or in any appropriate combination.<br>
In the aforementioned preferred embodiments, certain features of the present invention<br>
have been implemented using computer software. However, it will of course be clear<br>
to the skilled man that any of these features may be implemented using hardware.<br>
Furthermore, it will be readily understood that the functions performed by the<br>
hardware, the computer software, and such like are performed on or using electrical<br>
and like signals.<br>
