LIQUID-FILLED CHEWING GUM COMPOSITION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/776,641, filed February 24,2006, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/683,634, filed<br>
May 23, 2005, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/650,758, filed February 7,2005, and is a<br>
continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 11/210,954, filed on August 24, 2005 which<br>
is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 10/925,822, filed August 25,2004, the<br>
contents all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present invention includes compositions for a multi-layer liquid center-filled<br>
chewing gum, which maintains its liquidity for a substantial period of time. The individual gum<br>
pieces which include the compositions of the present invention include a liquid center which may<br>
include encapsulated components is surrounded by a gum region and optionally may be further<br>
coated with an external coating layer.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	Liquid or center-filled gum and other confectionery products are in popular<br>
demand today. Typically, these products have a solid exterior portion and a soft or liquid-type<br>
center. The outer portion can be chewing gum or bubble gum of some type, while the liquid<br>
center portion can be a flavored material typically having a syrup-like consistency.<br>
[0004]	There are also products having a chewing gum or bubble gum core with a hard<br>
sugar or sugarless shell on the exterior. These products include, for example well-known pellet<br>
gum products sold under the brand names Chiclets®, Clorets®, and Dentyne-Ice®. Both liquid<br>
filled and coated gum products are in popular demand.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0005]	Conventional center-filled gum products having a liquid-filled center portion, a<br>
second layer of chewing gum or bubble gum material surrounding the liquid, and a hard outer<br>
shell or coating suffer from undesirable migration of the liquid into the gum base region. This<br>
results in a product which is not commercially acceptable. Loss of the center-fill not only<br>
impacts the initial organoleptic qualities of the gum, i.e., initial liquid "burst", but also may alter<br>
the physical appearance and overall shelf-life stability of the product.<br>
[0006]	One possible cause of the loss in liquidity of the center-fill is from moisture<br>
migration from the center-fill to the surrounding gum layer. This problem has most frequently<br>
been addressed by alteration of the center-fill composition.<br>
[0007]	Patents which included a specifically formulated center-fill composition to<br>
overcome the loss of liquidity problem include: U.S. Patent No. 4,466,983 to Cifrese et al.,<br>
wherein the center-fill included a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate; U.S. Patent No. 4,250,196 to<br>
Friello which provides a center-fill which includes a combination of water and hydrogenated<br>
starch hydrolysate; and U.S. Patent No. 4,252,829 to Terrevazzi ("Terrevazzi") which discloses a<br>
center-fill formulation including propylene glycol and sorbitol.<br>
[0008]	Other attempts to address the loss of liquidity have provided formulations which<br>
are intended to control the water content of the center-fill. Specifically, U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,683,138 to Glass et al provides a low- moisture liquid center-filled gum composition.<br>
[0009]	One common factor of the commercially available center-fill gum compositions is<br>
the size of the gum piece. On average, the weight of such chewing gum pieces is approximately<br>
five grams, such as those disclosed in Terrevazzi. Until the present invention, smaller center-<br>
filled gum pieces, i.e., less than three grams per piece, have not been made and thus the problems<br>
associated with center-filled gum have not existed with such smaller pieces. Smaller gum pieces,<br>
such as 2-3 gram sizes and configurations such as pellet gums, have more surface area relative to<br>
the liquid-fill and thus, maintaining liquidity of the center-fill and preventing migration into and<br>
through the surrounding gum region becomes more critical and challenging.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0010]	There is a need for new gum compositions, and particularly hard or crunchy<br>
coated gums, which provide the desired hard shell coating layer in combination with a center-fill<br>
gum, while resisting loss of liquidity. This is also a need for a center-filled gum, which retains<br>
its liquid center during manufacturing and during its shelf-life, and which can be made in a<br>
reduced piece-size without loss of the liquid-center fill properties. In addition, it would be<br>
desirable to have a center-fill chewing gum with prolonged sensory characteristics, such as<br>
sweetness and flavor intensity.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0011]	In some embodiments, there are compositions and products containing liquid<br>
center-filled compositions which retain their liquidity over time and resist the migration of the<br>
liquid center-fill into the region surrounding the liquid center-fill and/or the solidification of the<br>
center-fill over time. The liquid fill of some embodiments may also include at least one<br>
modified release component.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022]	As used herein the transitional term "comprising," (also "comprises," etc.) which<br>
is synonymous with "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-ended<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps, regardless of its use in the<br>
preamble or the body of a claim.<br>
[0023]	As used herein, the terms "bubble gum" and "chewing gum" are used<br>
interchangeably and are both meant to include any gum compositions.<br>
[0024]	As used herein, the terms "first region," "liquid-fill," and "center-fill" are used<br>
interchangeably and refer to the innermost region of the compositions. The term "center-fill"<br>
does not imply symmetry of a gum piece, only that the "center-fill" is within another region of<br>
the gum piece. In some embodiments, more than one center-fill or liquid fill may be present.<br>
[0025]	As used herein, the terms "second region" and "gum region" are used<br>
interchangeably to refer to a region of the compositions that may be adjacent to or at least<br>
partially surrounding the center-fill, or innermost, region.<br>
[0026]	As used herein, the terms "third region" and "coating" are used interchangeably to<br>
refer to the outermost region of the compositions.<br>
[0027]	As used herein, the term "liquid" refers to compositions which will readily flow<br>
or maintain fluid properties at room temperature and pressure.<br>
[002S]	As used herein, the term "ingredient" and the term "component" are used<br>
interchangeably to describe any additive, fixing, substance, material, agent, active, element, or<br>
part that may be included in the gum compositions of some embodiments.<br>
[0029]	Embodiments described herein provide a multi-component composition which<br>
includes at least one liquid fill region and a gum region which includes a gum base. The<br>
individual gum piece may also include an outer gum coating or shell, which typically provides a<br>
crunchiness to the piece when initially chewed. The individual gum pieces may form a variety<br>
of shapes including pellet, tablet, ball, pillow, chunk, stick and slab, among others.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0030]	In some embodiments, the components of the composition may be in different<br>
configurations depending on the desired shape of the total gum composition. The liquid-fill area<br>
or areas may be in either a concentric configuration with respect to the gum region or in a<br>
layered configuration. A concentric configuration may be acceptable for a ball, pillow or pellet<br>
shape, while a layered configuration may be more suitable for a slab or a stick shape.<br>
[0031]	The center-fill gum composition and other compositions described herein may be<br>
formed by any technique known in the art which includes the method described by U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,280,780 to Degady et al. ("Degady") which is herein incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety. Degady describes an apparatus and method for forming center-filled gum pellets. The<br>
method includes first extruding a liquid-filled rope of a chewing gum layer and passing the rope<br>
through a sizing mechanism including a series of pairs of pulley-shaped roller members. The<br>
roller members "size" the rope or strand of gum material such that it leaves the series of rollers<br>
with the desired size and shape for entering a tablet-forming mechanism.<br>
[0032]	The rope is then led into a tablet-forming mechanism including a pair of rotating<br>
chain die members which are endless chain mechanisms and both rotate at the same speed by a<br>
motor and gear mechanism. Each of the chain mechanisms include a plurality of open curved<br>
die groove members which mate and form die cavities in which the pieces of gum material<br>
(pellets or tablets) are formed. While Degady is limited to the formation of pellet or tablet<br>
shaped pieces, the gum pieces may be of other shapes as described above. The shape of the die<br>
groove members may be altered to provided any desired shape.<br>
[0033]	The gum may optionally be passed through a cooling tunnel either before entering<br>
the tablet-forming mechanism, after exiting the tablet-forming mechanism or both. Cooling of<br>
the rope prior to entering the tablet-forming mechanism may be beneficial to prevent rebound of<br>
the individual pieces and thus an increase in productivity.<br>
[0034]	The cooled pieces of gum material are then fed into a storage container for<br>
conditioning and further processing. At this point, the cooled pieces of gum material could also<br>
be fed directly into a coating tunnel mechanism, such as a rotating tunnel mechanism.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0035]	Whether the pieces of formed gum material are first stored, transported in a<br>
storage container, or fed directly into a coating tunnel or mechanism, the individual pieces of<br>
gum material may subsequently be subjected to a conventional sugar or sugarless coating process<br>
in order to form a hard exterior shell on the liquid-filled gum material. Coating processes or<br>
mechanisms of this type are known. In general, the coating is applied in numerous thin layers of<br>
material in order to form an appropriate uniform coated and finished quality surface on the gum<br>
products. The hard coating material, which may include sugar, maltitol, sorbitol or any other<br>
polyol, including those described herein, and optionally flavoring, is sprayed onto the pellets of<br>
gum material as they pass through a coating mechanism or a coating tunnel and are tumbled and<br>
rotated therein. In addition, conditioned air is circulated or forced into the coating tunnel or<br>
mechanism in order to dry each of the successive coating layers on the formed products.<br>
[0036]	The coating composition may range from about 2% to about 60%, more<br>
specifically, about 20% to about 40% by weight of an individual gum piece which includes a<br>
center-fill, a gum region and a coating; even more specifically, from 25% to 35% and still more<br>
specifically around 30%. The coating may include sugar or polyol such as maltitol as the<br>
primary component, but may also include flavors, colors, etc. as described below in the<br>
discussion of the gum region.<br>
[0037]	The center-filled chewing gum provides resistance from moisture migration from<br>
the center-fill to the gum region by modifying both the polyol composition and gum base<br>
composition present in the gum region. This is in contrast to the aforementioned conventional<br>
approaches and which have not fully addressed the problems associated with manufacturing and<br>
shelf-stability of liquid center-filled products.<br>
[0038]	In some embodiments of the invention, there are included smaller piece-sizes.<br>
For example, the smallest conventional piece sizes of commercially available gum are generally<br>
in pellet forms. These piece-sizes currently range from about 5-7 grams. In some embodiments<br>
liquid filled products have been made using substantially smaller piece sizes, i.e., 50-60%<br>
smaller by weight, without loss of liquidity or migration of liquid into the gum region or beyond<br>
into the coating.    Some inventive embodiments provide a liquid-filled gum piece size range<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
which is greater than about 0.5 grams, more specifically greater than 1.5 grams up to about 3<br>
grams, including the addition of an outer hard coating shell. In addition, in some embodiments a<br>
gum piece may include a center-fill, a gum region including a gum base and an outer coating.<br>
Such gum pieces may be about 2.2 grams total weight per piece.<br>
[0039]	It has been discovered that pieces of such small size and particularly with gum<br>
shapes or configurations having proportionally more liquid-fill surface area as compared to the<br>
weight to the liquid per se, have a greater tendency to lose the liquidity of the center due to the<br>
interaction of different factors. While not limited to a single theory, these factors include the<br>
small amount of liquid-fill in comparison to the surface of the gum region in which the liquid-fill<br>
is in direct contact, the interaction of the type of elastomer with the center-fill (i.e. SBR versus<br>
non-SBR), the compatibility of the gum region components with the liquid-fill components, and<br>
the potential capillary action of the polyol used in the gum region. For example, the structure of<br>
sorbitol, which is customarily used in gum formulations in the United States, does not provide a<br>
tightly packed crystalline structure, giving almost a sponge-like appearance. Therefore, in order<br>
to provide a center-filled gum piece of less than about 3 grams, the present invention alters the<br>
gum and gum base to include a polyol composition having a dense, tightly packed crystalline<br>
structure which is unlike the sponge-like structure in conventional sorbitol gum region<br>
formulations, in order to provide a center-filled gum piece which resists loss of liquidity.<br>

Modality Chewing Gum Composition".<br>
Gum Region<br>
[0041]	The gum region, also referred to as the second region in the claims, provides a<br>
liquid barrier to surround and prevent the liquid-fill from migration and premature release. One<br>
or more cavities can be present in the gum region to house the liquid center-fill. The shape of the<br>
cavity will be largely dictated by the final configuration of the chewing gum piece. By selection<br>
of the ratio of the desired cavity surface area to the liquid-fill weight, optimization of the<br>
reduction in potential liquid-fill migration in to the gum region area can be achieved. This is<br>
particularly useful when the gum piece size is desired to be substantially smaller than<br>
conventional commercialized gum pieces. In particular, liquid-filled pellet gums having sizes of<br>
2 to 3 grams by weight of the entire gum piece have been successfully made. However, smaller<br>
gum pieces, as small as about 0.5 grams are contemplated.<br>
[0042]	In some embodiments, the gum region may have a non-uniform thickness. In<br>
particular, the gum region in layered configuration embodiments may be thinner on the ends than<br>
on the sides of the gum piece.<br>
[0043]	As discussed earlier, some embodiments may incorporate a modified polyol<br>
composition including at least one polyol incorporated into the gum region as discussed herein.<br>
Moreover, the selection of a non-SBR gum base in the gum region, in combination with the<br>
modified polyol composition has been found to be particularly useful in achieving stable liquid-<br>
filled chewing gum compositions.<br>
[0044]	The gum region may include a gum base. The gum base may include any<br>
component known in the chewing gum art. For example, the gum region may include<br>
elastomers, bulking agents, waxes, elastomer solvents, emulsifiers, plasticizers, fillers and<br>
mixtures thereof. Wherein the gum region is included in a three component composition<br>
including a center-fill, a gum region and a coating layer, the gum region may comprise from<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
about 40% to about 97%, more specifically from about 55% to about 65% by weight of the<br>
chewing gum piece, even more specifically about 62%.<br>
[0045]	The gum region may also include a specific polyol composition including at least<br>
one polyol which is from about 30% to about 80% by weight of said gum region, and specifically<br>
from 50% to about 60%. The polyol composition may include any polyol known in the art<br>
including, but not limited to maltitol, sorbitol, erythritol, xylitol, mannitol, isomalt, lactitol and<br>
combinations thereof. Lycasin® which is a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate and may include<br>
sorbitol and maltitol, may also be used.<br>
[0046]	The amount of the polyol composition or combination of polyols used in the gum<br>
region will depend on many factors including the type of elastomers used in the gum base and<br>
the particular polyols used. For example, wherein the total amount of the polyol composition is<br>
in the range of about 40% to about 65% based on the weight of the gum region, the amount of<br>
maltitol may be from about 40% to about 60% in addition to an amount of sorbitol from about 0<br>
up to about 10%, more specifically, an amount of maltitol may be from about 45% to about 55%<br>
in combination with sorbitol from about 5% to about 10%.<br>
[0047]	Maltitol is a sweet, water-soluble sugar alcohol useful as a bulking agent in the<br>
preparation of beverages and foodstuffs and is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,708,396,<br>
which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. Maltitol is made by hydrogenation of<br>
maltose which is the most common reducing disaccharide and is found in starch and other<br>
natural products.<br>
[0048]	The polyol composition which may include one or more different polyols which<br>
may be derived from a genetically modified organism ("GMO") or GMO free source. For<br>
example, the maltitol may be GMO free maltitol or provided by a hydrogenated starch<br>
hydrolysate. For the purposes of this invention, the term "GMO-free" refers to a composition<br>
that has been derived from process in which genetically modified organisms are not utilized.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0049]	Some embodiments may include a polyol composition including maltitol which<br>
has a greater crystalline density than sorbitol. Other polyols which exhibit a greater crystalline<br>
density than sorbitol include xylitol and mannitol. The greater the crystalline density of the<br>
polyol the better the barrier properties are. Specifically, a polyol of a greater crystalline density<br>
results in a structure with fewer pores, which provides less surface area for potential moisture or<br>
fluid migration into the gum region from the liquid-fill.<br>
[0050]	Since sugar (sucrose) is generally accepted as the baseline for comparison of<br>
sweeteners, including polyols, the polyol composition of some embodiments is described<br>
similarly. For example, the polyol composition of may have a sweetness of greater than about<br>
50% of the sweetness of sucrose. More specifically, the polyol composition of the present<br>
invention may have sweetness greater than about 70% the sweetness of sucrose.<br>
[0051]	The polyol composition of some embodiments may also be described in terms of<br>
the solubility of the composition. The solubility of the polyol composition will depend on the<br>
solubility of the one or more polyols included in the composition. For example, if maltitol is the<br>
only polyol included in the polyol composition, the solubility of the polyol composition in water<br>
will be about 60% at 25°C.<br>
[0052]	Blends of different polyols may also be used. Examples of useful polyols are<br>
erythritol, lactitol, xylitol, mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, isomalt, and combinations thereof. Where<br>
a blend of more than one polyol is used, the solubility of the polyol composition will depend on a<br>
weighted ratio of the amount of the polyol in the blend and the solubility of each individual<br>
polyol which is included. For example, a combination of two or more polyols may have a water<br>
solubility range of about 60% to about 72%, if it includes maltitol, which has a water solubility<br>
of 60% at 25°C, and sorbitol, which has a water solubility of about 72% at 25°C. Other suitable<br>
solubility ranges, which depend on the included two or more polyols include the ranges from<br>
about 40% to about 60% at 25°C and 55% to 65% at 25°C. The range of the solubility may vary,<br>
depending on the particular polyols used. Alternative suitable solubilities of a polyol<br>
combination include those having a solubility less than sucrose (i.e., less than 67%).<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0053]	The polyol composition may include particles of a variety of sizes. Specifically,<br>
the average particle size of the polyol composition ranges from about 30 microns to about 600<br>
microns, more specifically from about 30 microns to about 200 microns.<br>
[0054]	The amount of the gum base which is present in the gum region may also vary.<br>
The gum base may be included in the gum region in an amount from about 25% to about 45% by<br>
weight of the gum region. A more specific range of gum base is from about 28% to about 42%<br>
by weight of the gum region. Even more specifically, the range may be from about 28% to about<br>
35% or from about 28% to about 30%.<br>
[0055]	The elastomers (rubbers) employed in the gum base will vary greatly depending<br>
upon various factors such as the type of gum base desired, the consistency of gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes those<br>
gum polymers utilized for chewing gums and bubble gums. Illustrative examples of suitable<br>
polymers in gum bases include both natural and synthetic elastomers. For example, those<br>
polymers which are suitable in gum base compositions include, without limitation, natural<br>
substances (of vegetable origin) such as chicle, natural rubber, crown gum, nispero, rosidinha,<br>
jelutong, perillo, niger gutta, tunu, balata, guttapercha, lechi capsi, sorva, gutta kay, and the like,<br>
and combinations thereof. Examples of synthetic elastomers include, without limitation, styrene-<br>
butadiene copolymers (SBR), polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymers, polyethylene,<br>
polyvinyl acetate and the like, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0056]	Additional useful polymers include: crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
polymethylmethacrylate; copolymers of lactic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates, plasticized<br>
ethylcellulose, polyvinyl acetatephthalate and combinations thereof.<br>
[0057]	The amount of elastomer employed in the gum base may vary depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base used, the consistency of the gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
product. In general, the elastomer will be present in the gum base in an amount from about 10%<br>
to about 60% by weight of the gum region, desirably from about 35% to about 40% by weight.<br>
[0058]	In some embodiments, the gum base may include wax. It softens the polymeric<br>
elastomer mixture and improves the elasticity of the gum base. When present, the waxes<br>
employed will have a melting point below about 60°C, and preferably between about 45°C. and<br>
about 55°C. The low melting wax may be a paraffin wax. The wax may be present in the gum<br>
base in an amount from about 6% to about 10%, and preferably from about 7% to about 9.5%, by<br>
weight of the gum base.<br>
[0059]	In addition to the low melting point waxes, waxes having a higher melting point<br>
may be used in the gum base in amounts up to about 5%, by weight of the gum base. Such high<br>
melting waxes include beeswax, vegetable wax, candelilla wax, carnuba wax, most petroleum<br>
waxes, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0060]	In addition to the components set out above, the gum base may include a variety<br>
of other ingredients, such as components selected from elastomer solvents, emulsifiers,<br>
plasticizers, fillers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0061]	The gum base may contain elastomer solvents to aid in softening the elastomer<br>
component. Such elastomer solvents may include those elastomer solvents known in the art, for<br>
example, terpinene resins such as polymers of alpha-pinene or beta-pinene, methyl, glycerol and<br>
pentaerythritol esters of rosins and modified rosins and gums such as hydrogenated, dimerized<br>
and polymerized rosins, and mixtures thereof. Examples of elastomer solvents suitable for use<br>
herein may include the pentaerythritol ester of partially hydrogenated wood and gum rosin, the<br>
pentaerythritol ester of wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of wood rosin, the glycerol ester<br>
of partially dimerized wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of polymerized wood and gum<br>
rosin, the glycerol ester of tall oil rosin, the glycerol ester of wood and gum rosin and the<br>
partially hydrogenated wood and gum rosin and the partially hydrogenated methyl ester of wood<br>
and rosin, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The elastomer solvent may be employed in the gum<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
base in amounts from about 2% to about 15%, and preferably from about 7% to about 11%, by<br>
weight of the gum base.<br>
[0062]	The gum base may also include emulsifiers which aid in dispersing the<br>
immiscible components into a single stable system. The emulsifiers useful in this invention<br>
include glyceryl monostearate, lecithin, fatty acid monoglycerides, diglycerides, propylene<br>
glycol monostearate, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The emulsifier may be employed in<br>
amounts from about 2% to about 15%, and more specifically, from about 7% to about 11%, by<br>
weight of the gum base.<br>
[0063]	The gum base may also include plasticizers or softeners to provide a variety of<br>
desirable textures and consistency properties. Because of the low molecular weight of these<br>
ingredients, the plasticizers and softeners are able to penetrate the fundamental structure of the<br>
gum base making it plastic and less viscous. Useful plasticizers and softeners include lanolin,<br>
palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, sodium stearate, potassium stearate, glyceryl triacetate,<br>
glyceryl lecithin, glyceryl monostearate, propylene glycol monostearate, acetylated<br>
monoglyceride, glycerine, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Waxes, for example, natural and<br>
synthetic waxes, hydrogenated vegetable oils, petroleum waxes such as polyurethane waxes,<br>
polyethylene waxes, paraffin waxes, microcrystalline waxes, fatty waxes, sorbitan monostearate,<br>
tallow, propylene glycol, mixtures thereof, and the like, may also be incorporated into the gum<br>
base. The plasticizers and softeners are generally employed in the gum base in amounts up to<br>
about 20% by weight of the gum base, and more specifically in amounts from about 9% to about<br>
17%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
[0064]	Plasticizers also include are the hydrogenated vegetable oils and include soybean<br>
oil and cottonseed oil which may be employed alone or in combination. These plasticizers<br>
provide the gum base with good texture and soft chew characteristics. These plasticizers and<br>
softeners are generally employed in amounts from about 5% to about 14%, and more specifically<br>
in amounts from about 5% to about 13.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0065]	Anhydrous glycerin may also be employed as a softening agent, such as the<br>
commercially available United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade. Glycerin is a syrupy liquid<br>
with a sweet warm taste and has a sweetness of about 60% of that of cane sugar. Because<br>
glycerin is hygroscopic, the anhydrous glycerin may be maintained under anhydrous conditions<br>
throughout the preparation of the chewing gum composition.<br>
[0066]	In some embodiments, the gum base of this invention may also include effective<br>
amounts of bulking agents such as mineral adjuvants which may serve as fillers and textural<br>
agents. Useful mineral adjuvants include calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, alumina,<br>
aluminum hydroxide, aluminum silicate, talc, tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate,<br>
calcium sulfate and the like, and mixtures thereof. These fillers or adjuvants may be used in the<br>
gum base compositions in various amounts. The amount of filler, may be present in an amount<br>
from about zero to about 40%, and more specifically from about zero to about 30%, by weight<br>
of the gum base. In some embodiments, the amount of filler will be from about zero to about<br>
15%, more specifically from about 3% to about 11%.<br>
[0067]	A variety of traditional ingredients may be optionally included in the gum base in<br>
effective amounts such as coloring agents, antioxidants, preservatives, flavoring agents, and the<br>
like. For example, titanium dioxide and other dyes suitable for food, drug and cosmetic<br>
applications, known as F. D. &amp; C. dyes, may be utilized. An anti-oxidant such as butylated<br>
hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, and mixtures thereof,<br>
may also be included. Other conventional chewing gum additives known to one having ordinary<br>
skill in the chewing gum art may also be used in the gum base. A variety of components which<br>
may be added to the gum region, or alternatively to the liquid-fill region or coating are described<br>
in greater detail in the section entitled "Additional Components" hereinbelow.<br>
[0068]	Some embodiments extend to methods of making the center-fill gum<br>
compositions. The manner in which the gum base components are mixed is not critical and is<br>
performed using standard techniques and apparatus known to those skilled in the art. In a typical<br>
method, an elastomer is admixed with an elastomer solvent and/or a plasticizer and/or an<br>
emulsifier and agitated for a period of from 1 to 30 minutes. The remaining ingredients, such as<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
the low melting point wax, are then admixed, either in bulk or incrementally, while the gum base<br>
mixture is blended again for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
[0069]	The gum composition may include amounts of conventional additives selected<br>
from the group consisting of sweetening agents (sweeteners), plasticizers, softeners, emulsifiers,<br>
waxes, fillers, bulking agents (carriers, extenders, bulk sweeteners), mineral adjuvants, flavoring<br>
agents (flavors, flavorings), coloring agents (colorants, colorings), antioxidants, acidulants,<br>
thickeners, medicaments, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Some of these additives may serve<br>
more than one purpose. For example, in sugarless gum compositions, a sweetener, such as<br>
maltitol or other sugar alcohol, may also function as a bulking agent.<br>
[0070]	The plasticizers, softening agents, mineral adjuvants, waxes and antioxidants<br>
discussed above, as being suitable for use in the gum base, may also be used in the chewing gum<br>
composition. Examples of other conventional additives which may be used include emulsifiers,<br>
such as lecithin and glyceryl monostearate, thickeners, used alone or in combination with other<br>
softeners, such as methyl cellulose, alginates, carrageenan, xanthan gum, gelatin, carob,<br>
tragacanth, locust bean gum, pectin, alginates, galactomannans such as guar gum, carob bean<br>
gum, glucomannan, gelatin, starch, starch derivatives, dextrins and cellulose derivatives such as<br>
carboxy methyl cellulose, acidulants such as malic acid, adipic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid,<br>
fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof, and fillers, such as those discussed above under the category<br>
of mineral adjuvants.<br>
[0071]	In some embodiments, the gum region may also contain a bulking agent. Suitable<br>
bulking agents may be water-soluble and include sweetening agents selected from, but not<br>
limited to, monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides, sugar alcohols, and mixtures<br>
thereof; randomly bonded glucose polymers such as those polymers distributed under the<br>
tradename Litesse    which is the brand name for polydextrose and is manufactured by Danisco<br>
Sweeteners, Ltd. of 41-51 Brighton Road, Redhill, Surrey, RH1 6YS, United Kingdom.; isomalt<br>
(a racemic mixture of alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-mannitol and alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-1,6-<br>
sorbitol manufactured under the tradename PALATINIT by Palatinit Sussungsmittel GmbH of<br>
Gotlieb-Daimler-Strause 12 a, 68165 Mannheim, Germany); maltodextrins; hydrogenated starch<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
hydrolysates; hydrogenated hexoses; hydrogenated disaccharides; minerals, such as calcium<br>
carbonate, talc, titanium dioxide, dicalcium phosphate; celluloses; and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0072]	Suitable sugar bulking agents include monosaccharides, disaccharides and<br>
polysaccharides such as xylose, ribulose, glucose (dextrose), mannose, galactose, fructose<br>
(levulose), sucrose (sugar), maltose, invert sugar, partially hydrolyzed starch and corn syrup<br>
solids, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0073]	Suitable sugar alcohol bulking agents include sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol,<br>
galactitol, maltitol, erythritol, isomalt and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0074]	Suitable hydrogenated starch hydrolysates include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,279,931 and various hydrogenated glucose syrups and/or powders which contain sorbitol,<br>
maltitol, hydrogenated disaccharides, hydrogenated higher polysaccharides, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are primarily prepared by the controlled catalytic<br>
hydrogenation of corn syrups. The resulting hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are mixtures of<br>
monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric saccharides. The ratios of these different saccharides give<br>
different hydrogenated starch hydrolysates different properties. Mixtures of hydrogenated starch<br>
hydrolysates, such as LYCASIN®, a commercially available product manufactured by Roquette<br>
Freres of France, and HYSTAR®, a commercially available product manufactured by SPI<br>
Polyols, Inc. of New Castle, Delaware, are also useful.<br>
[0075]	The sweetening agents which may be included in the compositions of some<br>
embodiments may be any of a variety of sweeteners known in the art. These are described in<br>
more detail in the "Additional Components" section herein below and may be used in many<br>
distinct physical forms well-known in the art to provide an initial burst of sweetness and/or a<br>
prolonged sensation of sweetness. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include<br>
free forms, such as spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0076]	Desirably, the sweetener is a high intensity sweetener such as aspartame,<br>
neotame, sucralose, and acesulfame potassium (Ace-K). In general, an effective amount of<br>
sweetener may be utilized to provide the level of sweetness desired, and this amount may vary<br>
with the sweetener selected. In some embodiments the amount of sweetener may be present in<br>
amounts from about 0.001% to about 3%, by weight of the gum composition, depending upon<br>
the sweetener or combination of sweeteners used. The exact range of amounts for each type of<br>
sweetener may be selected by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0077]	Coloring agents may be used in amounts effective to produce the desired color.<br>
The coloring agents may include pigments which may be incorporated in amounts up to about<br>
6%, by weight of the gum composition. For example, titanium dioxide may be incorporated in<br>
amounts up to about 2%, and preferably less than about 1%, by weight of the gum composition.<br>
The colorants may also include natural food colors and dyes suitable for food, drug and cosmetic<br>
applications. These colorants are known as F.D.&amp; C. dyes and lakes. The materials acceptable<br>
for the foregoing uses are preferably water-soluble. Illustrative nonlimiting examples include the<br>
indigoid dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Blue No.2, which is the disodium salt of 5,5-indigotindisulfonic<br>
acid. Similarly, the dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Green No.l comprises a triphenylmethane dye and is<br>
the monosodium salt of 4-[4-(N-ethyl-p-sulfoniumbenzylamino) diphenylmethylene]-[l-(N-ethyl<br>
-N-p-sulfoniumbenzyl)-delta-2,5-cyclohexadieneimine]. A full recitation of all F.D.&amp; C.<br>
colorants and their corresponding chemical structures may be found in the Kirk-Othmer<br>
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd Edition, in volume 5 at pages 857-884, which text is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Additional coloring components are described in the<br>
"Additional Components" section hereinbelow.<br>
[0078]	Suitable oils and fats usable in gum compositions include partially hydrogenated<br>
vegetable or animal fats, such as coconut oil, palm kernel oil, beef tallow, and lard, among<br>
others. These ingredients when used are generally present in amounts up to about 7%, and<br>
preferably up to about 3.5%, by weight of the gum composition.<br>
[0079]	Some embodiments may include a method for preparing the improved chewing<br>
gum compositions for the gum region, including both chewing gum and bubble gum<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
compositions. The chewing gum compositions may be prepared using standard techniques and<br>
equipment known to those skilled in the art. The apparatus useful in accordance with some<br>
embodiments comprises mixing and heating apparatus well known in the chewing gum<br>
manufacturing arts, and therefore the selection of the specific apparatus will be apparent to the<br>
artisan.<br>
[0080]	With respect to the center-fill layer, the gum region may have a water activity<br>
greater than or equal to the water activity of the center-fill composition. However, in<br>
compositions wherein a greater water activity is desired in the center or liquid-fill, the water<br>
activity of the center-fill composition may be greater than that of the gum region. A higher<br>
moisture content will aid in hydration of thickeners like xanthan gum and cellulose when present<br>
in the center-fill.<br>
[0081]	The gum region may have a total moisture content of about 14% by weight of the<br>
gum region and more specifically may have a total moisture content from about 9% to about<br>
14% by weight, with a free moisture content of less than about 5%. The center-fill further may<br>
have total moisture content including free and bound moisture from about zero up to about 35%<br>
by weight of said center-fill, specifically about 22%.<br>
Liquid-Fill Composition<br>
[0082]	The center-fill or liquid-fill composition may include any components known in<br>
the art for incorporation with a center-fill composition. This may include glycerin in addition to<br>
one or more other polyols in amounts greater than zero up to about 20%, more specifically, up to<br>
about 10% by weight of the total chewing gum composition, i.e., including a center-fill<br>
composition, a gum region and a coating. More desirably, the center-fill is approximately 8% by<br>
weight of the total chewing gum composition. The other polyol component includes desirably<br>
maltitol, sorbitol, xylitol, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0083]	In some embodiments, the center-fill region may be substantially or completely<br>
filled with the liquid center-fill composition. In some other embodiments, the center-fill region<br>
may be only partially filled with the liquid center-fill composition.<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0084]	In some embodiments, the center-fill region may include two or more center-fill<br>
compositions. The two or more center-fill compositions may be the same or different forms. For<br>
example, some embodiments may contain a mixture of two or more distinct liquids, which may<br>
or may not be miscible. Similarly, some embodiments may contain two or more distinct solids,<br>
semi-solids or gasses in the center-fill region. Mixtures of different center-fill forms also may be<br>
included in some embodiments. For example, a liquid and a solid may be included in the center-<br>
fill region. In some embodiments where two or more liquids are employed in the center-fill<br>
region these may be included in the same or different amounts and may have similar or distinct<br>
characteristics. More specifically, in some embodiments, the two or more center-fill<br>
compositions may differ in a variety of characteristics, such as, viscosity, color, flavor, taste,<br>
sensation, ingredient components, functional components, sweeteners, or the like.<br>
[0085]	In some embodiments, the center-fill composition also may include non-liquid<br>
components, such as, for example, flavor beads, fruit particles, nut particles, flavor particles,<br>
gelatin portions, and the like.<br>
[0086]	The liquid centers may contain those traditional ingredients well known in the<br>
chewing gum and confectionery arts, such as flavoring agents, sweetening agents, and the like,<br>
and mixtures thereof, as described above. In addition to confectionery additives, the liquid<br>
centers may also contain pharmaceutical additives such as medicaments, breath fresheners,<br>
vitamins, minerals, caffeine, fruit juices, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The confectionery<br>
and pharmaceutical agents may be used in many distinct physical forms well known in the art to<br>
provide an initial burst of sweetness and flavor and/or therapeutic activity or a prolonged<br>
sensation of sweetness and flavor and/or therapeutic activity. Without being limited thereto, such<br>
physical forms include free forms, such as spray dried, powdered, and beaded forms, and<br>
encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof. Illustrative, but not limiting, examples of liquid<br>
centers suitable for use in some embodiments include those centers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
3,894,154,4,156,740,4,157,402, 4,316,915, and 4,466,983, which disclosures are incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Specific examples of suitable additional components include taurine,<br>
guarana, vitamins, Actizol™, chlorophyll, Recaldent™ tooth whitening technology, and<br>

Retsyn™.<br>
[0087]	The center-fill composition also may include a natural or synthetic gum such as<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, pectin, propylene glycol aginate, agar and gum tragacanth. These<br>
compositions serve to increase viscosity by reducing the amount of free water in the<br>
composition. The viscosity of the center-fill may range from about 300 cp to about 6,000 cp at<br>
25°C. In liquid-fill compositions which have a greater water activity than the surrounding gum<br>
region, the viscosity may range from about 3,000 cp to about 6,000 cp at 25°C.<br>
[0088]	Xanthan gum may also be used to increase the viscosity of the center-fill<br>
composition. Increasing viscosity of the liquid also helps prevent the liquid from leaking<br>
through the gum piece. Xanthan gum is available under the tradename Keltrol® from Signet<br>
Chemical Corporation.<br>
[0089]	Some embodiments extend to methods of making the improved center-filled<br>
chewing gum compositions. The improved compositions may be prepared using standard<br>
techniques and equipment known to those skilled in the art. The apparatus useful in accordance<br>
with the embodiments described herein comprises mixing and heating apparatus well known in<br>
the chewing gum manufacturing arts, and therefore the selection of the specific apparatus will be<br>
apparent to the artisan Such methods and apparatus are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
3,806,290 and 3,857,963, which disclosures are incorporated herein by reference<br>
Coating Composition<br>
[0090]	The coating composition, when included in the center-fill compositions, may be<br>
applied by any method known in the art including the method described above. The coating<br>
composition may be present in an amount from about 2% to about 60%, more specifically from<br>
about 25% to about 35% by weight of the total center-filled gum piece, even more specifically<br>
about 30% by weight of the gum piece.<br>
[0091]	The outer coating may be hard or crunchy. Typically, the outer coating may<br>
include sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, erythritol, isomalt, and other crystallizable polyols; sucrose<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
may also be used. Furthermore the coating may include several opaque layers, such that the<br>
chewing gum composition is not visible through the coating itself, which can optionally be<br>
covered with a further one or more transparent layers for aesthetic, textural and protective<br>
purposes. The outer coating may also contain small amounts of water and gum arabic. The<br>
coating can be further coated with wax. The coating may be applied in a conventional manner by<br>
successive applications of a coating solution, with drying in between each coat. As the coating<br>
dries it usually becomes opaque and is usually white, though other colorants may be added. A<br>
polyol coating can be further coated with wax. The coating can further include colored flakes or<br>
speckles. If the composition comprises a coating, it is possible that one or more oral care actives<br>
can be dispersed throughout the coating. This is especially preferred if one or more oral care<br>
actives is incompatible in a single phase composition with another of the actives. Flavors may<br>
also be added to yield unique product characteristics.<br>
[0092]	The coating may also be formulated to assist with increasing the thermal stability<br>
of the gum piece and preventing leaking of the liquid fill. In some embodiments, the coating<br>
may include a gelatin composition. The gelatin composition may be added as a 40% by weight<br>
solution and may be present in the coating composition from about 5% to about 10% by weight<br>
of the coating composition, and more specifically about 7% to about 8%. The gel strength of the<br>
gelatin may be from about 130 bloom to about 250 bloom.<br>
[0093]	Other materials may be added to the coating to achieve desired properties. These<br>
materials may include without limitations, cellulosics such as carboxymethyl cellulose, gelatin,<br>
pullulan, alginate, starch, carrageenan, xanthan gum, gum arabic and polyvinyl acetate (PVA).<br>
[0094]	The coating composition may also include a pre- coating which is added to the<br>
individual gum pieces prior to an optional hard coating. The pre-coating may include an<br>
application of polyvinyl acetate (PVA). This may be applied as a solution of PVA in a solvent,<br>
such as ethyl alcohol. When an outer hard coating is desired, the PVA application may be<br>
approximately 3% to 4% by weight of the total coating or about 1% of the total weight of the<br>
gum piece (including a liquid-fill, gum region and hard coating).<br>

WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
Additional Components<br>
[0095]	Additional additives, such as physiological cooling agents, throat-soothing agents,<br>
spices, warming agents, tooth-whitening agents, breath-freshening agents, vitamins minerals,<br>
caffeine, drugs and other actives may also be included in any or all portions or regions of the<br>
chewing gum composition. Such components may be used in amounts sufficient to achieve their<br>
intended effects.<br>
[0096]	Any of the additional components discussed herein may be added to any region of<br>
the center-fill chewing gum composition in their modified release form and/or without modified<br>
release (sometimes referred to as "free" components). In some embodiments, for instance, a<br>
single component may be added to the center-fill chewing gum in its modified release form and<br>
free form. The modified release component and free component may be included together in the<br>
same region of the center-fill chewing gum or, in some embodiments, the two components may<br>
be included in different regions of the gum.<br>
[0097]	In some other embodiments, for instance, two different components that provide<br>
the same functionality, e.g., two different flavors, sweeteners, tastes, sensations, or the like, may<br>
be included in a center-fill chewing gum. In some embodiments, both components may have<br>
modified release properties. Alternatively, in some embodiments, one of the components may be<br>
modified release, whereas the other component may be free. The two components may be<br>
included in the same or different regions of the center-fill chewing gum.<br>
[0098]	Types of individual ingredients for which optional managed release from a<br>
chewing gum composition may be desired, include, but are not limited to sweeteners, flavors,<br>
actives, effervescing ingredients, appetite suppressors, breath fresheners, dental care ingredients,<br>
emulsifiers, flavor potentiators, bitterness masking or blocking ingredients, food acids,<br>
micronutrients, sensates, mouth moistening ingredients, throat care ingredients, colors, and<br>
combinations thereof. Ingredients may be available in different forms such as, for example,<br>
liquid form, spray-dried form, or crystalline form. In some embodiments, a delivery system or<br>
chewing gum composition may include the same type of ingredient in different forms.  For<br>
example, a chewing gum composition may include a liquid flavor and a spray-dried version of<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
the same flavor. In some embodiments, the ingredient may be in its free or encapsulated form<br>
and may be present in any region of the gum composition such as in the center-fill, the gum<br>
region, or the coating.<br>
[0099]	In some embodiments, an ingredient's release is modified such that when a<br>
consumer chews the chewing gum, they may experience an increase in the duration of flavor or<br>
sweetness perception and/or the ingredient is released or otherwise made available over a longer<br>
period of time. Modified release may be accomplished by any method known in the art, such as<br>
by encapsulation. Where modified release is due to encapsulation, this may be accomplished by<br>
a variety of means such as by spray coating or extrusion.<br>
[0100]	Additionally, if early and extended release of the ingredient is desired, the<br>
chewing gum composition may include ingredients without modified release (sometimes referred<br>
to as "free" ingredients), as well as ingredients with modified release. In some embodiments, a<br>
free ingredient may be used to deliver an initial amount or "hit" of an ingredient (e.g., flavor,<br>
cooling agent) or an initial sensation or benefit caused by the ingredient (e.g., flavor, nasal<br>
action, cooling, warming, tingling, saliva generation, breath freshening, teeth whitening, throat<br>
soothing, mouth moistening, etc.).   In some embodiments, the same ingredient can be provided<br>
with modified release characteristics to provide an additional or delayed amount of the same<br>
sensation or benefit. By using both the free ingredient and the ingredient with modified release<br>
characteristics, the sensation or benefit due to the ingredient may be provided over a longer<br>
period of time and/or perception of the sensation or benefit by a consumer may be improved.<br>
Also, in some embodiments the initial amount or "hit" of the ingredient may predispose or<br>
precondition the consumers' mouth or perception of the chewing gum composition.<br>
[0101]	As another example, in some embodiments it may be desirable to provide a<br>
sustained release of an ingredient in a chewing gum composition over time. To accomplish<br>
sustained release, the ingredient may be modified to allow for a lower concentration of the<br>
ingredient to be released over a longer period of time versus the release of a higher concentration<br>
of the ingredient over a shorter period of time.  A sustained release of an ingredient may be<br>
advantageous in situations when the ingredient has a bitter or other bad taste at the higher<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
concentrations.  A sustained release of an ingredient also may be advantageous when release of<br>
the ingredient in higher concentrations over a shorter period of time may result in a lesser<br>
amount of the ingredient being optimally delivered to the consumer.  For example, for a tooth<br>
whitening or breath freshening ingredient, providing too much of the ingredient too fast may<br>
result in a consumer swallowing a significant portion of the ingredient before the ingredient has<br>
had a chance to interact with the consumer's teeth, mucous membranes, and/or dental work,<br>
thereby wasting the ingredient or at least reducing the benefit of having the ingredient in the<br>
chewing gum composition.<br>
Ingredient Release Management<br>
[0102]	In different embodiments, different techniques, ingredients, and/or delivery<br>
systems, may be used to manage release of one or more ingredients in a chewing gum<br>
composition.   In some embodiments, more than one of the techniques, ingredients, and/or<br>
delivery systems may be used.<br>
[0103]	In some embodiments, the delay in availability or other release of an ingredient in<br>
a chewing gum composition caused by encapsulation of the ingredient may be based, in whole or<br>
in part, by one or more of the following: the type of encapsulating material, the molecular weight<br>
of the encapsulating material, the tensile strength of the delivery system containing the<br>
ingredient, the hydrophobicity of the encapsulating material, the presence of other materials in<br>
the chewing gum composition (e.g., tensile strength modifying agents, emulsifiers), the ratio of<br>
the amounts of one or more ingredients in the delivery system to the amount of the encapsulating<br>
material in the delivery system, the number of layers of encapsulating material, the desired<br>
texture, flavor, shelf life, or other characteristic of chewing gum composition, the ratio of the<br>
encapsulating material to the ingredient being encapsulated, etc.  Thus, by changing or<br>
managing one or more of these characteristics of a delivery system or the chewing gum<br>
composition, release of one or more ingredients in a chewing gum composition during<br>
consumption of the chewing gum composition can be managed more effectively and/or a more<br>
desirable release profile for one or more ingredients in the delivery system or the gum<br>
composition may be obtained.  This may lead to a more positive sensory or consumer<br>
experience during consumption of the chewing gum composition, more effective release of such<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
one or more ingredients during consumption of the chewing gum composition, less need for the<br>
ingredient (e.g., more effective release of the ingredient may allow the amount of the ingredient<br>
in the chewing gum composition to be reduced), increased delivery of a therapeutic or other<br>
functional benefit to the consumer, etc. Additionally, in some embodiments, managing the<br>
release rate or profile can be tailored to specific consumer segments.<br>
Encapsulation<br>
[0104]	In some embodiments, one or more ingredients may be encapsulated with an<br>
encapsulating material to modify the release profile of the ingredient.  In general, partially or<br>
completely encapsulating an ingredient used in a chewing gum composition with an<br>
encapsulating material may delay release of the ingredient during consumption of the chewing<br>
gum composition, thereby delaying when the ingredient becomes available inside the consumer's<br>
mouth, throat, and/or stomach, available to react or mix with another ingredient, and/or available<br>
to provide some sensory experience and/or functional or therapeutic benefit.   This can be<br>
particularly true when the ingredient is water soluble or at least partially water soluble.<br>
[0105]	In some embodiments, a material used to encapsulate an ingredient may include<br>
water insoluble polymers, co-polymers, or other materials capable of forming a strong matrix,<br>
solid coating, or film as a protective barrier with or for the ingredient. In some embodiments, the<br>
encapsulating material may completely surround, coat, cover, or enclose an ingredient. In other<br>
embodiments, the encapsulating material may only partially surround, coat, cover, or enclose an<br>
ingredient. Different encapsulating materials may provide different release rates or release<br>
profiles for the encapsulated ingredient.   In some embodiments, encapsulating material used in a<br>
delivery system may include one or more of the following: polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene,<br>
crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polymethylmethacrylate, polylactidacid,<br>
polyhydroxyalkanoates, ethylcellulose, polyvinylacetatephthalate, polyethylene glycol esters,<br>
methacrylicacid-co-methylmethacrylate, ethylene-vinylacetate (EVA) copolymer, and the like,<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
[0106]	In some embodiments, an ingredient may be pre-treated prior to encapsulation<br>
with an encapsulating material. For example, an ingredient may be coated with a "coating<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
material" that is not miscible with the ingredient or is at least less miscible with the ingredient<br>
relative to the ingredient's miscibility with the encapsulating material.<br>
[0107]	In some embodiments, an encapsulation material may be used to individually<br>
encapsulate different ingredients in the same chewing gum composition. For example, a delivery<br>
system may include aspartame encapsulated by polyvinyl acetate.  Another delivery system may<br>
include ace-k encapsulated by polyvinyl acetate. Both delivery systems may be used as<br>
ingredients in the same chewing gum or in other chewing gum compositions. For additional<br>
examples, see U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/683,634 entitled "Methods and Delivery<br>
Systems for Managing Release of One or More Ingredients in an Edible Composition" and filed<br>
May 23,2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
[0108]	In some embodiments, different encapsulation materials may be used to<br>
individually encapsulate different ingredients used in the same chewing gum composition. For<br>
example, a delivery system may include aspartame encapsulated by polyvinyl acetate. Another<br>
delivery system may include ace-k encapsulated by EVA.  Both delivery systems may be used<br>
as ingredients in the same chewing gum or other chewing gum compositions.  Examples of<br>
encapsulated ingredients using different encapsulating materials can be found in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/655,894 filed February 25,2005, and entitled "Process for<br>
Manufacturing a Delivery System for Active Components as Part of an Edible Composition," the<br>
entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
[0109]	In some embodiments, encapsulation may be employed to provide barrier<br>
protection to or from a component rather than to modify the release of the component. For<br>
instance, it often is desirable to limit the exposure of acids to other components in a chewing<br>
gum composition. Such acids may be encapsulated to limit their exposure to other components,<br>
or alternatively, the other components in the chewing gum composition may be encapsulated to<br>
limit their exposure to the acid.<br>

WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
Methods of Encapsulation<br>
[0110]	There are many ways to encapsulate one or more ingredients with an<br>
encapsulating material. For example, in some embodiments, a sigma blade or Banbury™ type<br>
mixer may be used. In other embodiments, an extruder or other type of continuous mixer may be<br>
used. In some embodiments, spray coating, spray chilling, absorption, adsorption, inclusion<br>
complexing (e.g., creating a flavor/cyclodextrin complex), coacervation, fluidized bed coating, or<br>
other process may be used to encapsulate an ingredient with an encapsulating material.<br>
[0111]	Examples of encapsulation of ingredients can be found in U.S. Patent Application<br>

of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.  Other examples of encapsulation<br>
of ingredients can be found in U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 10/955,255 filed<br>

[0112]	In some embodiments, a delivery system may be ground to a powdered material<br>
with a particular size for use as an ingredient in a chewing gum composition.  For example, in<br>
some embodiments, an ingredient may be ground to approximately the same particle size of the<br>
other chewing gum ingredients so as to create a homogeneous mixture.  In some embodiments,<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
the delivery system may be ground to a powdered material with an average particle size such as,<br>
for example, about 4 to about 100 mesh or about 8 to about 25 mesh or about 12 to about 20<br>
mesh.<br>
Tensile Strength<br>
[0113]	In some embodiments, selection of an encapsulating material for one or more<br>
ingredients may be based on tensile strength desired for the resulting delivery system.  For<br>
example, in some embodiments, a delivery system produces delayed or otherwise controlled<br>
release of an ingredient through the use of a pre-selected or otherwise desired tensile strength.<br>
[0114]	In some embodiments, increasing the tensile strength of a delivery system may<br>
increase the delayed or extended release of an ingredient in the delivery system. The tensile<br>
strength for a delivery system may be matched with a desirable release rate selected according to<br>
the type of the ingredient(s) to be encapsulated for the delivery system, the encapsulating<br>
material used, any other additives incorporated in the delivery system and/or a chewing gum<br>
composition using the delivery system as an ingredient, the desired rate of release of the<br>
ingredient, and the like. In some embodiments, the tensile strength of a delivery system which<br>
can be at least 6,500 psi, including 7500,10,000, 20,000, 30,000,40,000, 50,000,60,000,<br>
70,000, 80,000, 90,000,100,000,125,000,135,000, 150,000, 165,000, 175,000,180,000,<br>
195,000,200,000 and all ranges and subranges there between, for example, a tensile strength<br>
range of 6,500 to 200,000 psi.<br>
[0115]	In some embodiments, a delivery system for one or more ingredients can be<br>
provided based on the tensile strength of the delivery system having a specific tensile strength<br>
when compared to a standard. Thus, the design of the delivery system is not focused on one<br>
characteristic (e.g., molecular weight) of one of the materials (e.g., encapsulating material) used<br>
to produce the delivery system. In this manner, a delivery system can be formulated to express a<br>
desired release profile by adjusting and modifying the tensile strength through the specific<br>
selection of the ingredient(s), encapsulating material, additives, amount of the ingredient(s),<br>
amount of encapsulating material, relative amounts of ingredient(s) to encapsulating material,<br>
etc. If a desired tensile strength is chosen for a delivery system, any delivery system that has the<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
desired tensile strength may be used without being limited to a particular encapsulating material<br>
and its molecular weight. The formulation process can be extended to encapsulating materials<br>
that exhibit similar physical and chemical properties as the encapsulating material forming part<br>
of the standard delivery system.<br>
[0116]	In some embodiments, a delivery system for delivering an ingredient may be<br>
formulated to ensure an effective sustained release of the ingredient based on the type and<br>
amount of the ingredient and the desired release rate for the ingredient. For example, it may be<br>
desirable to affect the controlled release of a high intensity sweetener from a chewing gum over a<br>
period of twenty-five to thirty minutes to ensure against a rapid burst of sweetness that may be<br>
offensive to some consumers. A shorter controlled release time may be desirable for other type<br>
of ingredients such as pharmaceuticals or therapeutic agents, which may be incorporated into the<br>
same chewing gum composition by using separate delivery systems for each of these ingredients.<br>
Delivery systems may be formulated with a particular tensile strength associated with a range of<br>
release rates based on a standard. The standard may comprise a series of known delivery<br>
systems having tensile strengths over a range extending, for example, from low to high tensile<br>
strength values. Each of the delivery systems of the standard will be associated with a particular<br>
release rate or ranges of release rates. Thus, for example, a delivery system can be formulated<br>
with a relatively slow release rate by a fabricating a delivering system having a relatively high<br>
tensile strength. Conversely, lower tensile strength compositions tend to exhibit relatively faster<br>
release rates.<br>
[0117]	In some embodiments, encapsulating material in a delivery system may be present<br>
in amounts of from about 0.2% to 10% by weight based on the total weight of the chewing gum<br>
composition, including 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0,1.25, 1.4,1.7, 1.9,2.2, 2.45,2.75, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0,<br>
4.25, 4.8, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.25, 7.75, 8.0, 8.3, 8.7, 9.0, 9.25, 9.5, 9.8 and all values and<br>
ranges there between, for example, from 1% to 5% by weight. The amount of the encapsulating<br>
material can depend in part on the amount of the ingredient(s) component that is encapsulated.<br>
The amount of the encapsulating material with respect to the weight of the delivery system, is<br>
from about 30% to 99%, including 35, 40,45, 50, 55, 60, 65,70,75, 80, 85, 95, 97 and all values<br>
and ranges there between, for example, from about 60% to 90% by weight.<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0118]	In some embodiments, the tensile strength of a delivery system may be selected<br>
from relatively high tensile strengths when a relatively slow rate of release for an ingredient in<br>
the delivery system is desired and relatively lower tensile strengths when a faster rate of release<br>
for an ingredient in the delivery system is desired. Thus, when employing a tensile strength of<br>
50,000 psi for a delivery system, the release rate of the ingredient, will generally be lower than<br>
the release rate of the ingredient in a delivery system having a tensile strength of 10,000 psi<br>
regardless of the type of encapsulating material (e.g., polyvinyl acetate) chosen.<br>
[0119]	In some embodiments, the encapsulating material for a delivery system is<br>
polyvinyl acetate. A representative example of a polyvinyl acetate product suitable for use as an<br>
encapsulating material in the present invention is Vinnapas® B100 sold by Wacker Polymer<br>
Systems of Adrian, Michigan. A delivery system utilizing polyvinyl acetate may be prepared by<br>
melting a sufficient amount of polyvinyl acetate at a temperature of about 65°C to 120°C for a<br>
short period of time, e.g., five minutes. The melt temperature will depend on the type and tensile<br>
strength of the polyvinyl acetate encapsulating material where higher tensile strength materials<br>
will generally melt at higher temperatures. Once the encapsulating material is melted, a suitable<br>
amount of an ingredient (e.g., high intensity sweetener such as aspartame) is added and blended<br>
into the molten mass thoroughly for an additional short period of mixing. The resulting mixture<br>
is a semi-solid mass, which is then cooled (e.g., at 0°C) to obtain a solid, and then ground to a<br>
U.S. Standard sieve size of from about 30 to 200 (600 to 75 microns). The tensile strength of the<br>
resulting delivery system can readily be tested according to ASTM-D638.<br>
[0120]	For additional information regarding how tensile strength of a delivery system<br>
may be used to create managed release of one or more ingredients, see U.S. Patent Application<br>

Composition Having Preselected Tensile Strength" and filed on March 21, 2005, and U.S. Patent<br>

WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
Hydrophobicity<br>
[0121]	In some embodiments, the release of one or more ingredients from a delivery<br>
system may depend on more than tensile strength. For example, the release of the ingredients<br>
may be directly related to the tensile strength of the delivery system and the hydrophobicity (i.e.,<br>
water resistance) of the encapsulating polymer or other material.<br>
[0122]	As a more specific example, when a delivery system is used in a chewing gum,<br>
moisture may be absorbed in the encapsulated ingredient(s) during mastication and chewing of<br>
the chewing gum. This may result in softening of the encapsulating material and releasing of<br>
the ingredient(s) during the mastication and chewing of the chewing gum. The softening of the<br>
encapsulation material depends on the hydrophobicity of the polymer used as the encapsulation<br>
material. In general, the higher the hydrophobicity of the polymer, the longer mastication time<br>
is needed for softening the polymer.<br>
[0123]	As one example, higher hydrophobic polymers such as ethylene-vinylacetate<br>
(EVA) copolymer can be used to increase or otherwise manage ingredient (e.g., sweetener)<br>
release times from encapsulations. The degree of hydrophobicity can be controlled by adjusting<br>
the ratio of ethylene and vinylacetate in the copolymer.   In general, the higher the ethylene to<br>
vinylacetate ratio, the longer time it will take during consumption to soften the encapsulation<br>
particles, and the slower or more delayed will be the release rate of the ingredient.  The lower<br>
the ethylene to vinylacetate ratio, the shorter time it will take during consumption to soften the<br>
encapsulation particles, and the faster or earlier will be the release rate of the ingredient.<br>
[0124]	As illustrated by the discussion above, in some embodiments, release of an<br>
ingredient from a delivery system can be managed or otherwise controlled by formulating the<br>
delivery system based on the hydrophobicity of the encapsulating material, e.g., the polymer, for<br>
the ingredient. Using highly hydrophobic polymers, the release times of the ingredient can be<br>
increased or delayed. In a similar manner, using encapsulating material that is less hydrophobic,<br>
the ingredient can be released more rapidly or earlier.<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0125]	The hydrophobicity of a polymer can be quantified by the relative water-<br>
absorption measured according to ASTM D570-98. Thus, by selecting encapsulating material(s)<br>
for a delivery system with relatively lower water-absorption properties and adding that to a<br>
mixer, the release of the ingredient contained in the produced delivery system can be delayed<br>
compared to those encapsulating materials having higher water-absorption properties.<br>
[0126]	In some embodiments, polymers with water absorption of from about 50 to 100%<br>
(as measured according to ASTM D570-98) can be used. Moreover, to decrease the relative<br>
delivery rate, the encapsulating material can be selected such that the water absorption would be<br>
from about 15% to about 50% (as measured according to ASTM D570-98). Still further, in other<br>
embodiments, the water absorption properties of the encapsulating material can be selected to be<br>
from 0.0% to about 5% or up to about 15% (as measured according to ASTM D570-98). In<br>
other embodiments, mixtures of two or more delivery systems formulated with encapsulating<br>
material having different water-absorption properties can also be used in subsequent<br>
incorporation into a chewing gum composition.<br>
[0127]	Polymers with suitable hydrophobicity which may be used for delivery systems<br>
include homo- and co-polymers of, for example, vinyl acetate, vinyl alcohol, ethylene, acrylic<br>
acid, methacrylate, methacrylic acid and others. Suitable hydrophobic copolymers include the<br>
following non-limiting examples, vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl alcohol<br>
copolymer, ethylene/acrylic acid copolymer, ethylene/methacrylate copolymer,<br>
ethylene/methacrylic acid copolymer.<br>
[0128]	In some examples, the hydrophobic encapsulating material in a delivery system<br>
may be present in amounts of from about 0.2% to 10% by weight based on the total weight of a<br>
chewing gum composition containing the delivery system, including 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0,1.25,<br>
1.4, 1.7,1.9, 2.2, 2.45,2.75, 3.0, 3.5,4.0, 4.25,4.8, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.25, 7.75, 8.0, 8.3, 8.7,<br>
9.0, 9.25, 9.5, 9.8 and all values and ranges there between, for example, froml% to 5% by<br>
weight. The amount of the encapsulating material will, of course, depend in part on the amount<br>
of the ingredient that is encapsulated. The amount of the encapsulating material with respect to<br>
the weight of the delivery system, is from about 30% to 99%, including 35, 40,45, 50, 55, 60,<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
65,70,75, 80, 85, 95,97 and all values and ranges there between, for example, from about 60%<br>
to 90% by weight.<br>
[0129]	In formulating the delivery system based on the selection criteria of<br>
hydrophobicity of the encapsulating material, the encapsulated ingredient can be entirely<br>
encapsulated within the encapsulating material or incompletely encapsulated within the<br>
encapsulating material provided the resulting delivery system meets the criteria set forth<br>
hereinabove. The incomplete encapsulation can be accomplished by modifying and/or adjusting<br>
the manufacturing process to create partial coverage of the ingredient.<br>
[0130]	For example, if ethylene-vinyl acetate is the encapsulating material for an<br>
ingredient, the degree of hydrophobicity can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of ethylene and<br>
vinyl acetate in the copolymer. The higher the ethylene to vinylacetate ratio, the slower the<br>
release of the ingredient.  Using vinylacetate/ethylene copolymer as an example, the ratio of the<br>
vinylacetate/ethylene in the copolymer can be from about 1 to about 60%, including ratios of 2.5,<br>
5, 7.5, 9, 12,18,23, 25,28, 30,35, 42,47, 52, 55, 58.5 % and all values and ranges there<br>
between.<br>
[0131]	In some embodiments, a method of selecting a target delivery system containing<br>
an ingredient for a chewing gum composition is based on the hydrophobicity of the<br>
encapsulating material for the ingredient in the delivery system. The method generally includes<br>
preparing a targeted delivery system containing an ingredient to be encapsulated, an<br>
encapsulating material and optional additives, with the encapsulating material having a pre-<br>
selected or otherwise desired hydrophobicity. The hydrophobicity of the encapsulating material<br>
employed in the targeted delivery system can be selected to provide a desirable release rate of the<br>
ingredient. This selection of the encapsulating material is based on the hydrophobicity of sample<br>
delivery systems having the same or similar ingredient and known release rates of the ingredient.<br>
In a more preferred another embodiment of the invention, the method comprises (a) obtaining a<br>
plurality of sample delivery systems comprising at least one ingredient, at least one<br>
encapsulating material, and optional additives, wherein each of the delivery systems is prepared<br>
with different encapsulating materials having different hydrophobicities; (b) testing the sample<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
delivery systems to determine the respective release rates of the ingredient(s); and (c)<br>
formulating a target delivery system containing the same ingredient(s) with a hydrophobic<br>
encapsulating material corresponding to a desired release rate of the ingredient(s) based on the<br>
obtained sample delivery systems.<br>
[0132]	The method of selecting at least one delivery system suitable for incorporation<br>
into a chewing gum composition preferably can begin by determining a desired release rate for<br>
an ingredient (i.e., a first active component). The determination of the desired release rate may<br>
be from known literature or technical references or by in vitro or in vivo testing. Once the<br>
desired release rate is determined, the desired hydrophobicity of the encapsulating material can<br>
be determined (i.e., a first hydrophobic encapsulating material) for a delivery system (i.e., first<br>
delivery system) that can release the first active component at the desired release. Once the<br>
delivery system is obtained which can deliver the first active component as required it is then<br>
selected for eventual inclusion in a chewing gum composition.<br>
[0133]	The method described above may then be repeated for a second active component<br>
and for additional active components as described via the determination and selection of a<br>
suitable delivery system.<br>
[0134]	For additional information regarding the relationship of hydrophobicity of an<br>
encapsulating material to the release of an ingredient from a delivery system, see U.S. Patent<br>

Release of One or More Ingredients in an Edible Composition" and filed on May 23, 2005, with<br>

Ratio of Ingredient to Encapsulating Material for Ingredient in Delivery System<br>
[0135]	In general, the "loading" of an ingredient in a delivery system can impact the<br>
release profile of the ingredient when the ingredient is used in a chewing gum composition.<br>
Loading refers to the amount of one or more ingredients contained in the delivery relative to the<br>
amount of encapsulating material. More specifically, the ratio of the amount of one or more<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
ingredients in a delivery system to the amount of encapsulating material in the delivery system<br>
can impact the release rate of the one or more ingredients. For example, the lower the ratio or<br>
loading of the amount of one or more ingredients in a delivery system to the amount of<br>
encapsulating material in the delivery system, the longer or more delayed will be the release of<br>
the one or more ingredients from the delivery system.  The higher the ratio or loading of the<br>
amount of one or more ingredients in a delivery system to the amount of encapsulating material<br>
in the delivery system, the faster or earlier will be the release of the one or more ingredients from<br>
the delivery system. This principle can be further employed to manage the release profiles of the<br>
one or more ingredients by using higher loading of ingredients designed to be released early in<br>
combination with lower loading of ingredients designed to be released later. In some<br>
embodiments, the one or more ingredients can be the same or different.<br>
[0136]	As a more specific example, three delivery systems including aspartame<br>
encapsulated with a polyvinylacetate and a fat were created using a conventional mixing process<br>
wherein the polyvinyl acetate first was melted in a mixer.   The aspartame and fat then were<br>
added and the three ingredients were mixed to create a homogenous mixture. The delivery<br>
systems had the following aspartame to polyvinyl to fat ratios: (1) 5:90:5; (2) 15:80:5, (3)<br>
30:65:5. The molten delivery systems were cooled and sized by passing ground powder through<br>
a 420 micron screen.  Three chewing gums where created, each using a different delivery<br>
system.   It was determined that the chewing gum using the first ratio of the ingredients had a<br>
lower or slower release of aspartame that the chewing gums using the second or third ratios of<br>
the ingredients. Similarly, the gum using the second ratio of the ingredients had a lower or<br>
slower release of aspartame than the chewing gum using the third ratio of the ingredients.<br>
[0137]	For additional information regarding the relationship of the ratio of the amount<br>
ingredient in a delivery system to the amount of encapsulating material in the delivery system to<br>
the release of an ingredient from a delivery system, see U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>

[0138]	There are many types of ingredients for which managed release of the ingredients<br>
from a chewing gum composition may be desired. In addition, there are many groups of two or<br>
more ingredients for which managed release of the group of ingredients from a chewing gum<br>
composition may be desired.<br>

mushroom flavor, and a tomato flavor. These flavoring agents may be used in liquid or solid<br>
form and may be used individually or in admixture. Commonly used flavors include mints such<br>
as peppermint, menthol, spearmint, artificial vanilla, cinnamon derivatives, and various fruit<br>
flavors, whether employed individually or in admixture. Flavors may also provide breath<br>
freshening properties, particularly the mint flavors when used in combination with the cooling<br>
agents, described herein below.<br>
[0140]	In some embodiments, other flavorings include aldehydes and esters such as<br>
cinnamyl acetate, cinnamaldehyde, citral diethylacetal, dihydrocarvyl acetate, eugenyl formate,<br>
p-methylamisol, and so forth may be used. Generally any flavoring or food additive such as<br>
those described in Chemicals Used in Food Processing, publication 1274, pages 63-258, by the<br>
National Academy of Sciences, may be used. This publication is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. These may include natural as well as synthetic flavors.<br>
[0141]	Further examples of aldehyde flavorings include but are not limited to<br>
acetaldehyde (apple), benzaldehyde (cherry, almond), anisic aldehyde (licorice, anise), cinnamic<br>
aldehyde (cinnamon), citral, i.e., alpha-citral (lemon, lime), neral, i.e., beta-citral (lemon, lime),<br>

[0142]	In some embodiments, a flavoring agent may be employed in either liquid form<br>
and/or dried form. When employed in the latter form, suitable drying means such as spray drying<br>
the liquid may be used. Alternatively, the flavoring agent may be absorbed onto water soluble<br>
materials, such as cellulose, starch, sugar, maltodextrin, gum arabic and so forth or may be<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
encapsulated. In still other embodiments, the flavoring agent may be adsorbed onto silicas,<br>
zeolites, and the like.<br>
[0143]	In some embodiments, the flavoring agents may be used in many distinct physical<br>
forms. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as spray<br>
dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0144]	Illustrations of the encapsulation of flavors as well as other additional components<br>
can be found in the examples provided herein.   Typically, encapsulation of a component will<br>
result in a delay in the release of the predominant amount of the component during consumption<br>
of a chewing gum composition that includes the encapsulated component (e.g., as part of a<br>
delivery system added as an ingredient to the chewing gum composition).   In some<br>
embodiments, the release profile of the ingredient (e.g., the flavor, sweetener, etc.) can be<br>
managed by managing various characteristics of the ingredient, delivery system containing the<br>
ingredient, and/or the chewing gum composition containing the delivery system and/or how the<br>
delivery system is made. For example, characteristics might include one or more of the<br>
following: tensile strength of the delivery system, water solubility of the ingredient, water<br>
solubility of the encapsulating material, water solubility of the delivery system, ratio of<br>
ingredient to encapsulating material in the delivery system, average or maximum particle size of<br>
ingredient, average or maximum particle size of ground delivery system, the amount of the<br>
ingredient or the delivery system in the chewing gum composition, ratio of different polymers<br>
used to encapsulate one or more ingredients, hydrophobicity of one or more polymers used to<br>
encapsulate one or more ingredients, hydrophobicity of the delivery system, the type or amount<br>
of coating on the delivery system, the type or amount of coating ori an ingredient prior to the<br>
ingredient being encapsulated, etc.<br>

Different delivery systems may use the same or different encapsulating materials.<br>
62<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
[0200]	Illustrations of the encapsulation of multiple ingredients can be found in examples<br>
provided herein.  Typically, encapsulation of the multiple ingredients will result in a delay in the<br>
release of the predominant amount of the multiple ingredients during consumption of a chewing<br>
gum that includes the encapsulated multiple ingredients (e.g., as part of a delivery system added<br>
as an ingredient to the chewing gum). This may be particularly helpful in situations wherein<br>
separate encapsulation of the ingredients may cause them to release with different release<br>
profiles. For example, different high intensity sweeteners may have different release profiles<br>
because they have different water solubilities or differences in other characteristics.<br>
Encapsulating them together may cause them to release more simultaneously.<br>
[0201]	In some embodiments, the release profile of the multiple ingredients can be<br>
managed for a gum by managing various characteristics of the multiple ingredients, the delivery<br>
system containing the multiple ingredients, and/or the chewing gum containing the delivery<br>
system and/or how the delivery system is made in a manner as previously discussed above.<br>
[0202]	The additional components, as described above, may be used in any region of the<br>
gum composition such as in the center-fill, the gum region or the coating as desired. Suitable<br>
amounts for the additional components are set forth in Table 1, below. The amounts in Table 1<br>
generally apply to each of the additional components as they may be added to a gum composition<br>
in a free form, i.e., unencapsulated. In some embodiments, where the additional component is<br>
provided in an encapsulated form, an amount greater than those amounts as set forth in Table 1<br>
may be used due to the modified release profile of the additional component. Also, because<br>
many of the additional components shown in Table 1 are optional, the amounts represent<br>
amounts used when the component is selected for inclusion in the composition. In other words,<br>
the lower limit of 0% is not included even though the additional component is an optional<br>
component.<br>
[0203]	The components listed in Table 1, below, may be added to any region of the<br>
. center-fill gum in their encapsulated and/or unencapsulated forms, as well as in combination with<br>
any of the other optional components. For instance, a single component may be added to a<br>
center-fill gum in its encapsulated and unencapsulated forms. The two different forms of the<br>
63<br><br>
WO 2006/127277	PCT/US2006/018070<br>
component may be added to the same or different region of the center-fill gum in the same or<br>
different amounts.<br>
[0204]	In some embodiments, a single component may be added in two or more different<br>
encapsulated forms. In particular, two or more different encapsulating materials, such as<br>
different polymers, may be used to encapsulate two or more separate portions of the component.<br>
The different encapsulated forms of the same component may be added to the same or different<br>
region of the center-fill gum in the same or different amounts. Further, in some embodiments, an<br>
unencapsulated form of the same component may be added in combination with the two or more<br>
different encapsulated forms. The unencapsulated form of the component may be added to any<br>
region of the center-fill gum in the same or different amount from the encapsulated forms.<br>
Moreover, some embodiments may add an unencapsulated form of a similar component in<br>
combination with the two or more different encapsulated forms. For instance, two encapsulated<br>
forms of a single sweetener may be used in combination with an unencapsulated form of a<br>
different sweetener.<br>
[0205]	In some embodiments, combinations of two or more different components from<br>
Table 1, below, may be employed. In some embodiments, at least one of the components may be<br>
encapsulated, while at least one of the components may be unencapsulated. The multiple<br>
components may be the same type of component, e.g., two different sweeteners, or components<br>
from distinctly different categories, e.g., a sweetener and a warming agent. The different<br>
components may be added to the same or different regions of the center-fill gum in the same or<br>
different amounts.<br>
[0206]	Some embodiments may include multiple components from Table 1, below, each<br>
of which is encapsulated. The multiple encapsulated components may be included in the same or<br>
different regions of the gum in the same or different amounts. The multiple encapsulated<br>
components may be the same type of component or from distinctly different categories.<br>
[0207]	In some embodiments in which multiple encapsulated components are added to<br>
the center-fill gum composition, the multiple components may be encapsulated together or<br>
64<br><br>
WO 2006/127277<br><br>
PCT/US2006/018070<br><br>
separately. In embodiments in which the multiple components are encapsulated together, the<br>
components may be mixed together and encapsulated by a single encapsulating material. In<br>
embodiments in which the multiple components are encapsulated separately, the material used to<br>
encapsulate the components may be the same or different.<br>

prepared according to the compositions in Tables 2-4 above with each region according to the<br>
corresponding components for compositions A-H.<br>
[0211]	The compositions for the gum regions are prepared by first combining talc, where<br>
present, with the gum base under heat at about 85°C. This combination is then mixed with the<br>
maltitol, lecithin and other polyols for six minutes. The flavor blends which include a pre-mix of<br>
the flavors and cooling agents are added and mixed for 1 minute. Finally, the acids and intense<br>
sweeteners are added and mixed for 5 minutes.<br>
[0212]	The liquid fill composition is then prepared by first preparing a pre-mix of the<br>
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, glycerine, and polyols. This pre-mix is then combined with the<br>
colors, flavors, cooling agents, acids and intense sweeteners and mixed.<br>
[0213]	The gum region and liquid-fill compositions are then extruded together and<br>
formed into tablets by the process described above at paragraphs [0031] to [0034] above. The<br>
gum pieces each have a total weight of approximately 2.2g. In the final gum pieces, the gum<br>
region is about 62% by weight, the liquid-fill is about 8% by weight, and the coating is about<br>
30% by weight.<br>

systems which may be used in any region of the gum compositions of some embodiments. The<br>
modified-release ingredients may be added to the center-fill, gum region and/or coating of the<br>
center-fill gum. For instance, the components of examples 1-78 could be added to any of the<br>
liquid-fill, gum region or coating compositions of examples A-X above to form center-fill<br>
chewing gums having modified release characteristics.<br>
[0229]	Some examples may include multiple modified release components from<br>
examples 1-78 in the same or different regions of the center-fill gum. When multiple modified<br>
release components are used in a center-fill gum, the components may be the same type, e.g.,<br>
multiple modified release sweeteners (example 29), or different types, e.g., modified release<br>
sweeteners with a modified release cooling agent (example 31). Moreover, in some examples,<br>
one or more of the modified release components from examples 1-78 may be included in any<br>
region of the center-fill gum in combination with the same component in its free, or<br>
unencapsulated, form. The free and modified release forms of the component may be added to<br>
the same or different regions of the center-fill gum. For instance, the spray-dried strawberry<br>
flavor of example 8, below, could be included in a center-fill composition in combination with a<br>
gum region containing unencapsulated strawberry flavor.<br><br>
