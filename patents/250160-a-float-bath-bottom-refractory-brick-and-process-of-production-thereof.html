				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a refractory brick<br>
to be used for the bottom of a float bath i.e. a tin bath<br>
in float process for production of plate glass, and a<br>
process for its production.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In production of plate glass by float process, a<br>
float bath on which molten glass is discharged from a<br>
glass melting furnace and formed into a ribbon, comprises<br>
a metal casing lined with a refractory brick, and is<br>
filled with molten tin. Glass molten in the melting<br>
furnace is discharged on the surface of the tin bath,<br>
flows on the tin bath and advances to be formed into<br>
smooth plate glass. As usual plate glass (soda lime<br>
glass) for buildings, automobiles, etc., glass containing<br>
about 15 mass% of Na2O is used. Such glass is in contact<br>
with the molten tin at its bottom surface, and at the<br>
interface, Na2O in the glass diffuses into the tin bath.<br>
As a bottom refractory brick for such a float bath,<br>
Chamotte brick containing Al2O3 and SiO2 as the main<br>
components and having a mineral phase mainly comprising<br>
Mullite and Cristobalite is employed in view of<br>
characteristics, usefulness, cost, etc.<br>
Na2O contained in the glass infiltrates from the<br>
surface of the float bath bottom refractory brick into<br>
its inside via the tin bath to form Nepheline, thereby to<br>
form a metamorphic phase different from the matrix of the<br>
refractory brick. The metamorphic phase increases in<br>
thickness with time in a direction perpendicular to the<br>
surface of the tin bath. Since Nepheline has a thermal<br>
expansion coefficient about three times as high as that<br>
of Mullite, peeling of the metamorphic phase from the<br>
matrix due to volume expansion of the metamorphic phase<br>
or due to thermal stress accompanying the change in<br>
temperature conditions of the float bath, i.e. so called<br>
flaking phenomena occur. The flakes, which have a<br>
specific gravity smaller than that of the molten tin,<br>
float up in the tin bath and scar the glass or generate<br>
foreign matters, and they can be a major cause of<br>
inhibiting smooth production of plate glass.<br>
Heretofore, as a float bath bottom refractory brick<br>
which inhibits such flaking phenomena, one having a total<br>
alkali metal content up to 3% to a clay portion (Patent<br>
Document 1) and one employing a silicate material<br>
containing an alkali oxide having a particle diameter of<br>
at most 0.09 mm in an amount of from 1 to 3 mass% (Patent<br>
Document 2) have been disclosed. However, specifically,<br>
they contain two alkali oxides i.e. from 0.1 to 0.4% of<br>
Na20 and from 0.8 to 1.2% of K2O, and they will not<br>
contain 2% or more of K2O. Further, one employing a<br>
material having a particle diameter of at most 90 Âµm,<br>
which has a total content of Na20 and K20 of at most 1<br>
mass% (Patent Document 3) and the like have been known.<br>
However, no document discloses effects of K20 as<br>
disclosed in the present invention.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
As a raw material of the float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick of the present invention, a clayey<br>
material comprising, as represented by mass percentage of<br>
the following oxides, from 30 to 45% of A120 and from 50<br>
to 65% of SiO2 is employed. For the float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick, as a clayey material, one having a Na20<br>
content of at most 1% is used so as to reduce<br>
infiltration of the sodium component from glass diffused<br>
in the tin bath. In description of the composition in<br>
the present invention, % represents mass% unless<br>
otherwise specified.<br>
As an additive to be a K20 source in the present<br>
invention, various potassium compounds may be used, and<br>
it is preferred to use potassium carbonate which is<br>
easily available at a relatively low cost. If the K20<br>
content is less than 2 mass%, the proportion of<br>
Cristobalite tends to be large, whereby it tends to be<br>
difficult to suppress the rate of infiltration of Na20<br>
from glass into the refractory brick via the tin bath,<br>
and it tends to be difficult to prevent flaking<br>
phenomena. On the other hand, if the K20 content exceeds<br>
4 mass%, the Mullite phase after firing tends to reduce,<br>
and the glass phase tends to increase correspondingly,<br>
whereby high temperature properties of the refractory<br>
brick tend to be impaired.<br>
As a specific process of using a clayey material<br>
comprising from 30 to 45% of Al2O3 and from 50 to 65% of<br>
SiO2 and having a Na2O content of at most 1%, and adding<br>
a potassium compound so that the K2O content in the float<br>
bath bottom refractory brick to be produced would be from<br>
2 to 4%, a process of adding a potassium compound as a<br>
K2O source to the above clayey material comprising from<br>
30 to 45% of A12O3 and from 50 to 65% of SiO2, kneading,<br>
molding, firing and then crushing the material to obtain<br>
a granular refractory material, kneading the granular<br>
refractory material, molding it into a shape of desired<br>
float bath bottom refractory brick, followed by firing to<br>
produce a float bath bottom refractory brick (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a first production process) and a process<br>
for producing a float bath bottom refractory brick, which<br>
comprises adding a granular potassium compound to the<br>
clayey material comprising from 3 0 to 45% of Al2O3 and<br>
from 50 to 65% of SiO2, kneading and molding the mixture<br>
into a shape of a desired float bath bottom refractory<br>
brick, followed by firing (hereinafter referred to as a<br>
second production process) may, for example, be<br>
mentioned. However, the method is not limited thereto.<br>
In a case where K2O is contained in the clayey<br>
material in a small amount, the addition amount of the<br>
potassium compound is adjusted so that the K20 content in<br>
the float bath bottom refractory brick to be produced<br>
would be from 2 to 4% considering the content of the K20<br>
contained.<br>
With respect to the reaction with Na20 at the surface<br>
of the float bath bottom refractory brick, as described<br>
above, the reaction rate with Na20 is suppressed by use<br>
of the material containing from 2 to 4% of K20, and the<br>
larger the specific surface area of the particles, the<br>
higher the reactivity. On the other hand, the float bath<br>
bottom refractory brick is produced by kneading, molding<br>
and firing a granular refractory material for production<br>
of the brick, and in view of characteristics required for<br>
the refractory brick to be produced, usually as the<br>
granular refractory material, one containing from 2 0 to<br>
60% of a fine granular portion having a grain size less<br>
than 90 urn, from 20 to 60% of a medium granular portion<br>
having a grain size of from 90 urn to 1 mm and from 20 to<br>
60% of a coarse granular portion having a grain size<br>
exceeding 1 mm, is usually used. With respect to a float<br>
bath bottom refractory block produced by using such a<br>
granular refractory material, a portion comprising the<br>
fine granular portion is most likely to be infiltrated<br>
and eroded by the sodium component from glass diffused in<br>
the tin bath, the medium granular portion is second<br>
likely to be eroded, and the coarse granular portion is<br>
relatively less likely to be eroded. Accordingly, in<br>
order to reduce particularly the infiltration of sodiÂµm,<br>
it is preferred to use a granular refractory material<br>
controlled so that in the fine granular portion having a<br>
grain size less than 90 Âµm, the K20 content would be from<br>
2 to 4% and the Na20 content would be at most 1%.<br>
Further, it is more preferred to employ one controlled so<br>
that in the fine granular portion having a grain size<br>
less than 90 Âµm and in the medium granular portion having<br>
a grain size of from 90 Âµm to 1 mm, the K20 content would<br>
be from 2 to 4% and the Na20 content would be at most 1%.<br>
It is more preferred to employ one controlled so that in<br>
the coarse granular portion having a grain size exceeding<br>
1 mm, the K20 and Na20 contents are as defined above,<br>
that is, in all granular portions, the K20 content would<br>
be from 2 to 4% and the Na20 content would be at most 1%.<br>
As mentioned above, by use of a refractory brick having a<br>
fine granular portion comprising the above material, for<br>
the float bath bottom, the rate of formation of Nepheline<br>
at the surface can be suppressed, and flaking phenomena<br>
can preferably be prevented.<br>
In the first production process, it is preferred<br>
that the granular refractory material containing the K20<br>
source is kneaded,, molded and dried, and then the<br>
resulting molded product is fired at a temperature of<br>
from 1,200Â°C to 1,400Â°C. If the molded product is fired<br>
at a temperature lower than 1,200Â°C, the fired product<br>
will not be stable in terms of mineral phase, and if it<br>
is fired at a temperature higher than 1,400Â°C, the<br>
Mullite phase after firing tends to be small,<br>
specifically, the proportion of the Mullite crystalline<br>
phase will be less than 20%, and the glass phase tends to<br>
excessively increase correspondingly, whereby high<br>
temperature properties of the refractory brick may be<br>
impaired. The fired molded product is crushed by a<br>
crusher and classified into coarse particles having grain<br>
sizes exceeding 1 mm, medium particles having grain sizes<br>
of from 90 Âµm to 1 mm and fine particles having grain<br>
sizes less than 90 Âµm. In such a manner, a material for<br>
production of a float bath bottom refractory brick,<br>
controlled so than the K20 content would be from 2 to 4<br>
mass%, is obtained. Then, the material is kneaded and<br>
molded into a shape of a desired float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick, dried and fired at a temperature within<br>
a range of from 1,200Â°C to 1,400Â°C to obtain a float bath<br>
bottom refractory brick.<br>
In the second production process, in a case where<br>
the clayey material is kneaded, molded, fired and then<br>
crushed to obtain a granular refractory material, to<br>
which a granular potassium compound as a K20 source is<br>
added, the additive as the K20 source has to be uniformly-<br>
dispersed in the Al203-Si02 clayey material, and<br>
accordingly the particles size is preferably at least<br>
matched to the particles size of the material. More<br>
preferably, the addit ive as the K20 source is<br>
preliminarily finely pulverized to a particle size<br>
smaller than that of the fine granular portion of the<br>
material and then kneaded with the clayey material.<br>
When the clayey material originally contains a<br>
desired amount of K20, namely, when a clayey material<br>
comprising from 30 to 45% of Al203, from 50 to 65% of<br>
Si02, at most 1% of Na20 and from 2 to 4% of K20 is used<br>
to produce a float bath bottom refractory brick, which is<br>
used for the float bath bottom, the rate of formation of<br>
Nepheline at the surface can be suppressed, and flaking<br>
phenomena can preferably be prevented.<br>
In the float bath bottom refractory brick<br>
comprising, on the basis of the following oxides, from 3 0<br>
to 45% of Al203, from 50 to 65% of Si02 and at most 1% of<br>
Na20, a proportion of the Cristobalite crystalline phase<br>
higher than 10% means a relatively small amount of the<br>
glass phase in the refractory brick, and absorption of<br>
volume expansion of Nepheline formed on the surface by a<br>
reaction with Na20 from glass infiltrated into the<br>
refractory brick via the tin bath, by the glass phase,<br>
tends to be difficult, and prevention of flaking<br>
phenomena tends to be difficult, such being unfavorable.<br>
The proportion of the Cristobalite crystalline phase<br>
is represented by the percentage of (the mass of<br>
Cristobalite)/{(the mass of Cristobalite)+(the mass of<br>
Mullite)}, and the mass of Cristobalite and the mass of<br>
Mullite can be obtained by employing analytical curves<br>
preliminarily prepared from intensity peaks of<br>
Cristobalite and Mullite measured by an X-ray diffraction<br>
apparatus (8/29 method, Cu-Kal rays).<br>
As a measurement method by an X-ray diffraction<br>
apparatus, the intensity peak of a powdered sample is<br>
measured by a powder X-ray diffraction apparatus, which<br>
is compared with an analytical curve preliminarily<br>
prepared by peak intensities of samples having the<br>
proportions of Cristobalite and Mullite changed in five<br>
stages, thereby to determine the proportion.<br>
On the other hand, in the float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick, a proportion of the Mullite crystalline<br>
phase less than 20% means a relatively large amount of<br>
the glass phase in the refractory brick, and in such a<br>
case, high temperature properties of the refractory brick<br>
tend to be impaired.<br>
The proportion of the Mullite crystalline phase is<br>
represented by the percentage of (the mass of<br>
Mullite)/{(the mass of Cristobalite)+(the mass of<br>
Mullite)}, and the mass of Cristobalite and the mass of<br>
Mullite are measured by the above-described method of<br>
employing an X-ray diffraction apparatus.<br>
If a large brick such as the float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick is produced by press molding by means of<br>
e.g. an oil hydraulic press, laminar defects (lamination)<br>
may form in a plane direction perpendicular to the<br>
direction of the pressure. If the refractory brick is<br>
used for the float bath bottom in a state where the<br>
defects are in parallel with glass in the float bath,<br>
peeling of Nepheline formed by a reaction with Na20 from<br>
glass infiltrated into the refractory brick via the tin<br>
bath from the surface of the refractory brick due to its<br>
volume expansion, i.e. flaking phenomena may be more<br>
accelerated. Accordingly, the direction of pressure at<br>
the time of press molding is preferably such a direction<br>
that the possible direction of lamination would be<br>
perpendicular to glass in the float bath, considering the<br>
direction of installation of the refractory brick in the<br>
float bath.<br>
The float bath bottom refractory brick produced by<br>
any one of the above processes preferably have a porosity<br>
within a range of from 15 to 20%, a bulk specific gravity<br>
within a range of from 2.1 to 2.3 and a compressive<br>
strength within a range of from 3 0 to 70 MPa, so as to<br>
satisfy mechanical strength, etc. as a structure.<br>
Further, in the float bath for production of plate<br>
glass employing the above float bath bottom refractory<br>
brick, flaking phenomena of the float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick can be suppressed, that is, the life of<br>
the float bath bottom refractory brick can be prolonged,<br>
whereby the time period until the float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick is exchanged with the float bath shut<br>
down, will be prolonged. Accordingly, the efficiency of<br>
the float bath will improve, and the cost for exchange<br>
relative to the operation time, can be suppressed to be<br>
relatively low.<br>
Further, in the process for producing glass<br>
employing the float bath employing the above float bath<br>
bottom refractory brick, defects (scars) of glass<br>
accompanying flaking phenomena are reduced, the quality<br>
tends to improve, and the rate of non-defective products<br>
tends to increase. Accordingly, the cost for production<br>
of glass can be suppressed low.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention will be explained in<br>
further detail with reference to Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples.<br>
With respect to an X-ray diffraction measurement<br>
method, measurement was carried out by means of X Pert-<br>
MPD (?/2? method, Cu-Ka1 rays) manufactured by PHILIPS<br>
employing a powder as a sample. Five types of samples<br>
with ratios of Mullite to Cristobalite of 100:0, 75:25,<br>
50:50, 25:75 and 0:100 were preliminarily subjected to<br>
measurement to obtain an analytical curve from the ratios<br>
and the X-ray peak intensities.<br>
Chemical analysis values of Al203-Si02 materials used<br>
in Examples 1 and 2, as represented by mass percentage<br>
based on oxides, are shown in Table 1. The clayey-<br>
material of the material A contains 1.1 massl of K20, and<br>
the clayey material of the material B contains 0.3 massl<br>
of K20.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
To 10 g of the clayey material A, potassium<br>
carbonate as a K20 source was added in an amount of not<br>
added (1.1%), 2, 3 or 4% as calculated as K20 mass% after<br>
mixing. The material having no potassium carbonate added<br>
corresponds to sample 1 (Comparative Example 1), and<br>
mixtures having potassium carbonate added in an amount of<br>
2%, 3% and 4% correspond to sample 2 (Example 1), sample<br>
3 (Example 1) and sample 4 (Example 1), respectively. As<br>
potassium carbonate, one preliminarily pulverized in a<br>
mortar was employed. Kneading was carried out in a<br>
mortar. The kneaded product was put in a mold, and<br>
molded into pellets by means of a pressing machine. The<br>
molded product was fired at 1,3 00Â°C for 24 hours.<br>
The fired product was crushed into granules, and the<br>
obtained granular refractory material was kneaded, molded<br>
into two molded products with a shape of a desired float<br>
bath bottom refractory brick, and the two molded products<br>
were dried and fired at 1,300Â°C and 1,350oC,<br>
respectively, to obtain two types of float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick. The granular refractory material<br>
comprised 30% of a fine granular portion having a grain<br>
size less than 90 Âµm, 30% of a medium granular portion<br>
having a grain size of from 90 Âµm to 1 mm and 40% of a<br>
coarse granular portion having a grain size exceeding 1<br>
mm. The composition of the prepared brick is<br>
substantially the same as the composition of the<br>
material.<br>
Results of X-ray diffraction measurement of test<br>
specimens of the obtained float bath bottom refractory<br>
brick and proportions of crystalline phases are shown in<br>
Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4. Fig. 1 illustrates results of X-ray<br>
diffraction measurement with respect to test specimens<br>
obtained by firing the molded products at 1,300Â°C, Fig. 2<br>
illustrates results of X-ray diffraction measurement with<br>
respect to test specimens obtained by firing the molded<br>
products at 1,350Â°C. Fig. 3 illustrates proportions of<br>
crystalline phases with respect to test specimens<br>
obtained by firing the molded products at 1,3 00Â°C, and<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates proportions of crystalline phases with<br>
respect to test specimens obtained by firing molded<br>
products at 1,350Â°C. The vertical axis represents the<br>
peak intensity of each crystal, and the horizontal axis<br>
represents mass% of K20.<br>
It is confirmed from Figs. 1 and 2 that the peak<br>
intensities representing the proportions of Cristobalite<br>
and quartz decrease, as the mass% of K20 increases to 2,<br>
3 and 4% (Example 1) as compared with no potassium<br>
carbonate is added (proportion of the Cristobalite<br>
crystalline phase is 11%) (Comparative Example 1).<br>
Further, it is confirmed that the proportion of the<br>
cristobalite crystalline phase also decreases. Such<br>
phenomena indicate that a glass phase rich in K20<br>
increases, which suppresses a reaction with Na20 at the<br>
surface of the refractory brick to be used for a float<br>
bath bottom.<br>
Further, as evident from Figs. 3 and 4, the<br>
proportion of the Cristobalite crystalline phase exceeds<br>
10% in a case where no potassium carbonate is added<br>
(Comparative Example 1), and the proportion of the<br>
Cristobalite crystalline phase is less than 10% in a case<br>
where potassium carbonate is added so that the massl of<br>
K20 would be 2, 3 or 4% (Example 1).<br>
Accordingly, it is estimated that flaking phenomena<br>
can be suppressed by use of the float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick of Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In the same manner as in Example 1, to 10 g of the<br>
clayey material B, potassium carbonate as a K20 source<br>
was added in an amount of 0.3 (not added), 2, 3, 4 or 6%<br>
as calculated as K20 mass% after mixing. The material<br>
having no potassium carbonate added corresponds to sample<br>
5 (Comparative Example 2), and mixtures having potassium<br>
carbonate added in an amount of 2%, 3%, 4% and 6%<br>
correspond to sample 6 (Example 2), sample 7 (Example 2),<br>
sample 8 (Example 2) and sample 9 (Comparative Example<br>
3), respectively. As potassium carbonate, one<br>
preliminarily pulverized in a mortar was employed.<br>
Kneading was carried out in a mortar. The kneaded<br>
product was put in a mold and molded into pellets by<br>
means of a pressing machine. The molded product was<br>
fired at 1,300Â°C for 24 hours.<br>
The fired product was crushed into granules, and the<br>
obtained granular refractory material was kneaded and<br>
molded into two molded products with a shape of a desired<br>
float bath bottom refractory brick, and the two molded<br>
products were dried and fired at 1,300Â°C and 1,350Â°C,<br>
respectively, to obtain two types of float bath bottom<br>
refractory brick. The above granular refractory material<br>
comprised 3 0% of a fine granular portion having a grain<br>
size less than 90 urn, 30% of a medium granular portion<br>
having a grain size of from 90 urn to 1 mm and 40% of a<br>
coarse granular portion having a grain size exceeding 1<br>
mm. The composition of the obtained brick is<br>
substantially the same as the composition of the<br>
material.<br>
Results of X-ray diffraction measurement with<br>
respect to test specimens of the obtained float bath<br>
bottom refractory brick and proportions of crystalline<br>
phases are shown in Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8. Fig. 5<br>
illustrates results of X-ray diffraction measurement with<br>
respect to test specimens obtained by firing the molded<br>
products at 1,300Â°C, and Fig. 6 illustrates results of X-<br>
ray diffraction measurement with respect to test<br>
specimens obtained by firing the molded product at<br>
1,350Â°C. Fig. 7 illustrates proportions of crystalline<br>
phases with respect to test specimens obtained by firing<br>
the molded products at 1,300Â°C, and Fig. 8 illustrates<br>
proportions of crystalline phases with respect to test<br>
specimens obtained by firing the molded products at<br>
1,350Â°C. The vertical axis represents the proportion of<br>
each crystalline phase, and the horizontal axis represent<br>
mass% of K20.<br>
It is found that the peak intensities of<br>
Cristobalite and quartz when no potassium carbonate is<br>
added (Comparative Example 2) are still higher than those<br>
of Example 1. This means that the amount of the glass<br>
phase in the refractory brick is small, and accordingly a<br>
reaction with Na20 at the surface of the refractory brick<br>
to be used for a float bath bottom can not be suppressed.<br>
To such a material, potassium carbonate is added in an<br>
amount of 2, 3, 4 or 6% as calculated as K20 mass% after<br>
mixing, followed by firing, whereby the peak intensities<br>
of Cristobalite and quartz reduce in a case where the K2O<br>
content is 2, 3 or 4% (Example 2), and the reaction with<br>
Na20 as described in Example 1 is suppressed. If the<br>
potassium carbonate is added in an amount of 6%<br>
(Comparative Example 3) as calculated as K20 mass% after<br>
mixing, followed by firing, whereby reduction of the peak<br>
intensity of Mullite is remarkable, and the proportion of<br>
Mullite remarkably decreased to at most 2 0% as shown in<br>
Figs. 7 and 8. Namely, the amount of the glass phase is<br>
in excess, and the high temperature properties of the<br>
refractory brick may be impaired. Accordingly, it is<br>
estimated that flaking phenomena can be suppressed by use<br>
of the float bath bottom refractory brick of Example 2.<br>
