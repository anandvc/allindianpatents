The present invention is concerned with the<br>
production of iron ore briquettes suitable for transport<br>
and use in iron making processes.<br>
Methods of agglomerating iron orbs have been in<br>
development since the late 1800's. However, of all the<br>
available processes only the pelletising and sintering<br>
processes are now of significance, but these suffer from<br>
certain disadvantages.<br>
Pelletising consists of two distinct operations;<br>
forming pellets from moist ore fines and then firing them<br>
at a temperature in the region of 1300°C. It is critical<br>
in order to prepare suitable pellets that the ore be<br>
ground very fine, generally to a size where in the order<br>
of 60% of the ore passes 45 pm. It is then formed into<br>
pellets in either a horizontal drum or an inclined disc,<br>
generally with the addition of a suitable binder. The<br>
formed pellets are then fired in a process sometimes<br>
reffered to as induration in shaft kilns,horizontal<br>
travelling grates, or a combination of travelling grates<br>
and rotary kilns. Pelletising is a practicable and<br>
commercially attractive method of agglomerating fine<br>
concentrates, but requires substantial grinding in order<br>
to achieve the required particle sizing which is an energy<br>
intensive process. Pellets made from goethite-hematite<br>
ores require extended Induration times, affecting process<br>
economics. Solid fuel, in the form of coke, is often added<br>
to reduce induration time which results in the production<br>
of noxious emissions (including dioxins, NOX and SOx) .<br>
Sintering consists of granulating moist iron ore<br><br>
fines and other fine materials with solid fuel, normally<br>
coke breeze, and loading the granulated mixture onto a<br><br>
permeable travelling grate. Air is drawn downwards<br>
through the grate as the temperature is raised. After a<br>
short ignition period, external heating of the bed is<br>
discontinued and as the solid fuel in the bed burns a<br>
narrow combustion zone moves downwards through the bed,<br>
each layer in turn being heated to approximately 1300°C.<br>
Bonding takes place between the grains during combustion,<br>
and a strong agglomerate is formed. However, traditional<br>
sintering processes result in high levels of noxious<br>
emissions, particularly sulfur oxides and dioxins, and<br>
therefore the process is undesirable and unsustainable on<br>
environmental grounds.<br>
Briguetting is a process in which there was<br>
commercial interest in the late 1800's and early 1900's,<br>
but production of iron ore briquettes for use as a blast<br>
furnace feed material never reached any significant<br><br>
levels, decreased after 1950, and had ceased by about<br><br>
1960. The process as practised involved the pressing of<br>
ore fines into a block of some suitable size and shape,<br>
and then indurating the block. A wide range of binders<br>
such as tar and pitch and/or other additives such as<br>
organic products, sodium silicate, ferrous sulfate,<br>
magnesium chloride, limestone and cement were tested.<br>
However, the earliest briquetting process, the Grondal<br>
process, simply involved mixing iron ore with water and<br>
pressing into oblong blocks the size of building bricks.<br>
These were then hardened by passing them through a tunnel<br>
kiln heated to 1350°C.	<br>
While developments in briquetting processes have<br>
been generally directed towards the development of<br>
suitable binders, JP 60-243232 describes briquettes that<br>
have a flat shape in order to provide for stable<br>
distribution in a blast furnace. Specifically, the<br>
Japanese specification discloses that the flat-shaped<br>
briquettes are much more easily reduced at higher<br><br><br>
temperatures than conventional spherical pellets. The<br>
briquettes are made with a volume between 2 and 30cc in<br>
order to balance a relatively high compression strength<br>
against an inferior rotary or tumble strength and impact<br>
resistance with increasing size. The Japanese<br>
specification discloses that larger briquettes are less<br>
easily reduced in a blast furnace. However, aside from<br>
the size and shape of the briquettes there is no other<br>
factor described as critical, and, indeed, there is no<br>
detailed description of any other aspect of the production<br>
of the briquettes.<br>
The applicant has carried out extensive research<br>
work into the production of briquettes from iron ore and<br>
has invented a method that can produce briquettes that<br>
have suitable properties for use in blast furnaces and<br>
other direct reduction vessels.	<br><br><br>
The applicant has found that there are a number<br>
of crucial factors in the success of this production<br>
method. These factors include characterising the raw<br>
material on the basis of mineralogy, porosity, size<br>
distribution and chemical composition, and then using this<br>
information to determine the required parameters,<br>
including the most suitable briquette forming parameters<br>
and induration parameters, to manufacture a suitable final<br>
product.	<br><br>
According to the present invention there is<br>

is suitable for use as a blast furnace or other direct<br>
reduction furnace feedstock which includes the steps of:<br>

Iron ore fines are broadly characterised into<br>
four groups on the basis of petrological characteristics,<br>
such as mineralogy, mineral association and particle<br>
texture, porosity, size distribution and chemistry. The<br>
groups are:	<br><br><br><br>
(a)	HC - Dense hematite/magnetite ores;<br>
(b)	GC - Ores containing up to 50% jgoethite; and;<br>
(c)	G - Ores containing predominantly goethite, ie<br>
greater than 50% goethite, such as pisolites,<br>
detritals, and channel iron deposits.<br>
The following pages of the specification refer<br>
to two particular sub-groups of GC ores, namely:<br><br><br>
(i) HG - goethite-containing ores that are<br>
dominated by hematite; and<br><br><br>
(ii) GH - ores with approximately equal<br>
amounts of hematite and goethite.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by, theory, it is<br>
believed that the bonding mechanism in green briquettes<br>
involves a combination of bonds including the mechanical<br>
interlocking of particles, van der Waal's forces, and in<br>
the case of raw material types GC and G, hydrogen bonding<br>
to varying degrees is dependent on the percentage of<br>
hydrated iron species present, eg goethite. Several<br>
characteristics of the feed material have been identified<br>
as having a significant influence on the formation of such<br>
bonds that affect the quality and processing performance<br>
of the green and fired briquettes. These characteristics<br>
are the moisture level of the feed material and its flow<br>
characteristics, the chemical composition of the ore, its size distribution and petrological characteristics and<br>
porosity.	<br><br>
Preferably the feed materials are of the widest<br><br>
size distribution possible in order to achieve a high<br>
packing density and increased bonding of the ore<br>
particles. As noted above, the bonding mechanism of green<br>
briquettes is believed to be through a combination of<br>
bonds arising from the mechanical interlocking of<br><br>
particles, van der Waal's forces, and hydrogen bonding in<br>
the cases of raw material types GC and G. Although a<br>
broad size distribution increases the packing density and<br>
improves the strength of the green briquette, it is<br>
possible to briquette closely sized iron ores.<br>
The top size of the particles is determined by<br>
the crushing process but is preferably less than 2.5 mm in<br>
order to produce briquettes of acceptable fired properties<br><br>
following the induration process. Generally, ore types HC<br>
and HG can be briquetted with coarser top j sizes due to the<br>
lower heat requirements of these raw materials to attain<br>
acceptable fired strength. The top size of the raw<br>
material can be reduced through either crushing or<br>
screening processes. The bottom size of the particles has<br>
no absolute limit, but it is not necessary or desirable,<br>
to grind the ore into very fine particles (as required for<br>
pelletising) as this is an additional economic burden<br>
rendered unnecessary by the present invention. Preferably<br>
less than 10% of the particles pass a 45 µm sieve.<br><br>
Advantageously the pocket dimensions of the<br>
briquetting apparatus should be selected on the basis of<br>
the maximum particle size to be briquetted, as well as for<br>
adequate induration performance, to ensure that<br>
satisfactory briquetting can be achieved. Typically the<br>
maximum particle size to achieve satisfactory briquetting<br>
is 25-30% of the minimum pocket dimension. If the maximum<br><br>
particle size exceeds this specification it may be<br>
necessary to select a larger pocket size.<br>
It is desirable to control feed moisture in order<br>
to optimise green briquette quality and product yield.<br>
Moisture addition should not exceed the level at which<br>
liquid bridging becomes a significant form of inter-<br>
particle bonding. This results in both decreased green<br>
strength and adversely affects thermal stability.<br>
Insufficient moisture can lead to overpressurisation in<br>
the briquette pressing step and adversely affect green<br>
briquette quality and yield.<br>
Depending on the feed characteristics of the ore<br>
to be processed, a moisture content of between 2 and 12 wt<br>
% for the feed material is used to optimise green<br>
briquette quality and product yield. Dense hematite<br>
concentrates (HC) have low optimum briquetting moistures.<br><br>
generally in the range of 2-5 wt %. These concentrates<br>
are often made up of closely sized particles with a smooth<br>
surface texture that generates low strength briquettes<br>
because of decreased interlocking of particles. More<br>
porous goethite-containing ores with up to 50% goethite<br>
(GC) briquette well in the range of 4-8 wt % moisture and<br>
more porous predominantly goethite ores (G) briquette well<br>
in the range of 6-12 wt% moisture. Such ores have a rough<br>
surface texture and shape enhancing their briquetting<br>
characteristics.<br>
Conventional briquetting apparatus may be used in<br>
the method of the invention. In essence, such apparatus<br>
includes two adjacent rolls with pockets which come<br>
together at a nip zone in order to compress the feed<br>
material into adjacent, aligned pockets to produce<br>
briquettes. In the case of the present invention, the<br>
rolls are preferably horizontally aligned to achieve the<br>
required throughput for economic feasibility.<br>
Although briquetting can be carried out over a<br>
wide range of roll pressures depending on the application,<br>
briquetting of iron ores is preferably conducted at roll<br>
pressing forces of 10-140 kN/cm and more preferably at the<br><br>
low end of this range, typically from 10-60 kN/cm. Such<br>
low pressure operation for iron ore briquetting is<br>
significant and makes it possible to achieve high<br>
production rates by the use of wide rolls on the<br>
briquetting machine up to 1.6m in length.<br><br>
Preferably the roll pressure is carefully<br>
controlled within the low pressure range in order to<br>
optimise the briquetting operation. If the roll pressure<br>
is too low, the rolls are forced apart producing a thick<br>
web and distorted briquettes impairing the product yield<br>
and the quality of the briquette, particularly after<br>
induration. If the roll pressure exceeds the optimum.<br><br>
poor closure of the briquettes occurs because of the<br><br>
"clamshell" effect on release of the briquettes from the<br><br>
pocket. The clamshell effect is more pronounced for small<br>
roll diameters and excess roll pressures, which also cause<br>
pocket binding/jamming. Although the density and crush<br>
strength of the green briquettes will be increased, the<br>
impact resistance of the fired briquettes will be severely<br>
impaired.	<br>
Preferably the moisture level is selected to<br>
influence the flow characteristics of the material through<br>
the feed system, and moisture levels of 2-12 wt % for the<br>
feed material are generally suitable. If the moisture<br>
level is too high for the feed system, the feed pressure<br>
is adversely affected resulting in a decreased yield and<br>
some impairment of briquette quality, characterised by a<br>
lower green strength. It the feed material is too low in<br>
moisture for the feed system the resultant feed pressure<br>
will cause clamshelling which may result in decreased<br><br>
yields, increased wear rates of the roll pockets, and<br><br>
inferior fired properties.<br><br>
The briquetting apparatus may be operated with a<br>
pre-compactor feed system or with a gravity feed system.<br>
The latter system is advantageous where high tonnages are<br>
to be briquetted, as in the iron ore industry.<br>
With regard to briquetting presses, a roll<br>
diameter is selected in order to ensure that briquette<br><br>
quality is obtained at an economic production rate. Large<br>
diameter rolls increase production rates, however they<br>
also increase the area of the nip zone. Careful control<br>
of the nip zone facilitates formation of quality green<br>
briquettes and avoids formation of briquettes with an<br>
excessively thick web. Alterations in roll diameter may<br>
also alter the optimum moisture level for feed material<br>
where increased roll diameters represent increases in feed<br><br>
moisture. Roll diameters typically vary from 250 mm - 1200<br>
mm. In order to maximise production, preferably the rolls<br>
are operated at the fastest speed possible whilst<br>
maintaining briquette quality. However, a very low roll<br>
speed may be used if productivity is of a secondary<br>
concern.<br>
I	■ .<br>
Typically, roll speeds in the range of 1 rpm to<br>
20 rpm are employed. It is desirable in order to maintain<br>
quality, particularly at high roll speeds, that the feed<br>
material be presented to the rolls at a rate that matches<br>
the briquette production rate and with a nip zone area<br>
that produces the forces required to form quality<br>
briquettes.<br>
Any suitable roll width may be selected provided<br>
that it is within the pressure capabilities of the<br>
briquetting machine. As briquetting of iron ores is a low<br>
pressure operation, wide rolls are preferred, increasing<br>
the capacity of the machine. The rolls are preferably<br>
horizontally aligned to allow for use with a gravity feed<br>
system. The flow characteristics of iron ores, whether<br>
HC, GC (including H6 and 6H), or G, are suitable for<br>
gravity feeding at the moisture ranges specified above for<br>
each classification.<br>
The pocket shape should not generally be of a<br>
sharp angular nature, but be more smooth and rounded to<br>
improve handling characteristics. By way of example, a<br>
length/width and width/depth ratio of approximately 0.65<br>
is suitable. Pocket shapes also have specific release<br>
angles, 110-120° that combat the tendency for sticking in<br>
the pockets.<br>
The pocket size can be optimised according to the<br>
requirements for the induration process and the raw<br>
material top size and the iron making blast furnace.<br><br>
Typically the briquettes have a volume of between 2 and 30<br>
cc. Preferably the volume is 10 cc or less. More<br>
preferably the volume is 8.5 cc or less. More preferably<br>
the volume is less than 6.5 cc.	<br>
A staggered pocket configuration is preferred as<br>
this makes the optimum use of the available space on the<br>
face of the rolls, and hence maximises throughput.<br>
Preferably the induration method and conditions<br>
are selected having regard to the complex relationship<br>
between raw material characteristics and tie influence of<br>
the briquette dimensions.<br>
Consideration of the relationship between<br>
briquette volume, shape and the petrological<br>
characteristics of the raw material is required. The<br>
chemical composition of the feed material will have a<br>
significant influence on the properties of the fired<br>
briquette. Apart from moisture, the feed material<br>
includes the iron ore made up of iron oxide and gangue<br>
minerals, with the required flux added to give the<br>
required basicity level in the fired briquette. Test<br>
results have shown that the flux should preferably be<br>
finely sized, typically &gt;95% passing 250 µm, in order to<br>
achieve the required properties in the fired briquette.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is<br><br>
believed that the bonding mechanism for fired briquettes<br>
involves diffusion bonding and re-crystallisation of the<br>
iron oxide particles as well as slag bonding at higher<br>
flux levels. Therefore, flux level and faring temperature<br>
and, to a certain extent, firing time have a strong<br>
influence on briquette properties. Elevated basicity<br>
levels may improve reduced strengths as well as indurated<br>
strengths as higher flux levels encourage the formation of<br>
bonding phases which resist demormation under reducing<br><br>
conditions.<br>
Induration may be carried out using a straight<br>
grate, grate-kiln or a continuous kiln type process.<br>
It has been found that green briquettes produced<br>
under an optimised firing profile are thermally very<br>
stable compared to pellets prepared from the same<br>
material. The feed ore for pelletising must be ground to<br>
a fine size, typically up to 60% passing 45 µm, and the<br>
pellets dried slowly at low temperatures, typically 
to avoid spalling. In contrast, as indicated above, the<br>
feed ore for the present invention that can be indurated<br><br>
successfully can be much coarser, with top sizes<br>
preferably up to 2.5 mm, and hence does not need grinding<br>
to the same extent as is required to produce pellets.<br>
This characteristic represents major capital cost<br>
reductions for briquetting operations over traditional<br>
pellet production plants.<br>
An important characteristic of the briquette of<br>
the present invention is the ability to withstand high<br>
temperatures on heating at fast rates, such as heating to<br>
a firing temperature within 30 minutes, more preferably<br>
within 20 minutes. This is in direct contrast with<br>
conventional understanding of how goethitic ores respond<br>
in induration situations, where is has been shown that<br>
they spall when heated too fast through the<br>
dehydroxylation and free water removal zones.<br>
As is indicated above, the thermal stability of<br>
the briquettes of the present invention has been found to<br>
be much greater than pellets and they may be heated at<br>
much faster rates than pellets without spelling. This<br>
allows a much shorter heating cycle. Consequently,<br>
briquette productivity can be significantly higher than<br>
for pellets using the same material. For instance,<br><br>
briquette productivities potentially in the order of<br>
30t/m2.day in a straight grate kiln can be achieved,<br>
compared to pellet productivities of 16t/m2.day for H6 ores<br>
in the same kiln.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Briquetting was performed using three different<br>
roll presses with varying roll diameter, width and feed<br>
systems.<br>
Initial testing was conducted using a Taiyo K-<br>
102A. double roll press, which has a nominal, capacity of<br>
300 kg/hr. This machine has 250 mm diameter rolls of 36<br>
mm width and features a screw-type precompactor. A<br>
schematic showing its main components can be seen in<br>
•Figure 1.<br>
The briquettes produced were pillow- shaped with<br>
nominal dimensions of 13x19x28 mm and a volume of 4 cc.<br>
There was a single row of 30 pockets around the<br>
circumference of each roll.<br>
Of the two rolls, one was fixed whilst the other<br>
"floating roll" was held against the fixed roll by an oil<br>
and gas filled ram. The oil in the ram was pressurised to<br>
provide the desired load force between the rolls.<br>
Briquetting was also performed using a Romarek<br>
BH400 double roll press, with a roll diameter of 450 mm<br>
and a roll width of 75 mm. Feed material was gravity fed<br>
into the nip zone from a feed hopper located above the<br>
rolls. A schematic of its main components can be seen in<br>
Figure 2.<br>
Briquettes of varying dimensions were produced<br>
with the following details:<br><br>
(1)	Nominally 17.5x28x34.3 mm with a volume of<br>
8.9 cc. There was a double row of 48 pockets arranged in<br>
staggered alignment around the circumference of each row<br>
(9 cc Almond forms).	<br>
(2)	Nominally 14.5x22.1x33.9 mm with a volume<br><br>
of 6.3 cc. There was a double row of 60 pockets arranged<br>
in a staggered alignment around the circumference of each<br>
roll(6 cc Almond forms).	<br>
(3)	Nominally 15.2x21.7x22.9 mm with a volume<br>
of 3.9 cc. There was a triple row of 58 pockets arranged<br>
in a staggered alignment around the circumference of each<br>
row (4 cc spherical).	<br>
(4)	Nominally 11.2x17.3x32.1 mm with a volume<br><br>
of 3.9 cc. There was a double row of 72 pockets arranged<br>
in a symmetrical alignment around the circumference of<br>
each roll (4 cc elongate).	<br>
Of the two rolls, one was fixed whilst the other<br>
"floating roll0 was held against the fixed roll by an oil<br>
and gas filled ram. The oil in the ram was pressurised to<br>
provide the desired specific pressing force between the<br>
rolls.	<br>
Briquetting was also conducted using a Koppern<br>
52/6.5 double roll press with a diameter of 650 mm and a<br>
roll width of 130 mm. Feed material was gravity fed into<br>
a nip zone from a hopper located above. Nip zone area was<br><br>
controlled through use of a 'nip zone adjuster'. A<br><br>
schematic of its main components can be seen in Figure 3.<br>
The briquettes produced were 'pillow' shaped with<br>
nominal dimensions of 30x24x16 mm and forms a volume of<br>
7.5 cc. There were four rows of 77 pockets arranged<br>
symmetrically across the face of the roll.<br><br><br>
Of the two rolls, one was fixed Whilst the other<br>
"floating roll" was held against the fixed roll by an oil<br>
and gas filled ram. The oil in the ram was pressurised to<br>
provide the desired specific pressing force between the<br>
rolls.	<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The effect of feed moisture content was<br>
investigated.	<br>
Figure 4 illustrates that feed moisture had a<br>
significant effect on the yield of 6 cc and 4cc briquettes<br>
produced by the briquetting press with 450 mm rolls as<br>
described in Example 1. The feed material was gravity fed<br>
to the rolls while the rolls operated at a fixed roll<br><br>
speed of 20 rpm and a roll pressure of 90kg/cm2.<br>
Feed moisture control is also important as<br>
variation in moisture content affects green properties<br><br>
such as green strength, abrasion resistance and shatter<br>
strengths. This is illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 5 shows the relationship between feed<br>
moisture level and strength for briquettes made with HG<br>
using the 450 mm rolls, a gravity feed system, and a<br>
variety of pocket sizes.<br>
Figure 6 shows the same relationship for<br>
briquettes made with the 650 mm rolls and 7.5 cc pockets<br>
for HG material.	<br>
Green strength tended to increase to a maximum<br>
for the optimum moisture content of approximately 6%. At<br>
moisture levels exceeding 7.5% the green strength was<br>
unacceptably low.<br><br>
Feed moisture had less of an influence on shatter<br>
strength and the green abrasion resistance of the<br>
briquettes.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
As is indicated above, although briguetting<br>
operations can be carried out over a wide range of rolls<br>
pressures, it is preferred that briguetting be carried out<br>
at low pressures. Such low pressure operation for iron<br>
ore briguetting is significant and opens up the<br>
possibility of achieving high production rates with wide<br>
rolls on a briguetting machines.<br>
However, as is indicated above, roll pressure<br>
should be carefully controlled within this low pressure<br>
range if the briguetting operation is to be optimised. If<br>
roll pressure is too low and nip zone area is not<br>
carefully controlled, the rolls are forced apart producing<br>
a thick web and distorted briquettes impairing the product<br>
yield and the quality of the briquette, particularly after<br>
induration. If roll pressure exceeds the optimum, poor<br>
closure of the briquettes occurs because of the<br>
"clamshell" effect on release of the briquette from the<br>
pocket. Although the density and crush strength of the<br>
green briquette will be increased, the impact resistance<br>
of the fired briguette will be severely impaired.<br>
Figure 7 shows the effect of roll pressure on<br>
briguette thickness and quality (measured in terms of<br>
crush strength) for raw material H6 produced in a gravity<br>
fed machine with 450mm diameter rolls with nominal 9 cc<br>
pockets. The figure shows that acceptable green strength<br>
was obtained at roll pressures as low as 60 kg/cm2.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 show the effect of pressing force<br><br>
and resultant green strength that was obtained using the<br>
650 mm diameter rolls. The work was carried out on HG and<br>
6H raw material types and illustrates a similar<br>
relationship between roll pressure and green strength as<br>
with the 450 mm work. Specifically, the figures show that<br>
acceptable green strengths were obtained at pressing<br>
forces of 20 kN/cm.<br>
Pressing force was also found to exert a<br>
significant influence on the shatter strength and the<br>
green abrasion resistance of the briquettes, with both<br>
variables increasing in response to increased roll<br>
pressure.<br>
EXAMPLE 4	<br>
Roll speed was also investigated.<br>
Roll speed, measured in rpm, was found to exert<br>
an influence on the amount of pressure applied to feed<br>
materials.<br>
Increased roll speeds result in shorter residence<br>
time in the nip zone of the rolls and hence lower pressure<br><br>
is exerted for a longer period of time. Roll pressure can<br>
be used primarily to control the amount of pressure<br>
exerted on feed material and roll speed can be altered to<br>
maximise the production rate. However, it is important to<br>
consider the effects of roll speed on briquette thickness<br>
and green strength when optimising the green briquetting<br>
operation.<br>
The effect of roll speed on briquette thickness<br>
and quality (measured in terms of crush strength) for raw<br>
material HQ is shown in Figure 10 for a gravity fed<br>
machine with 450 mm diameter rolls.<br><br>
The Figure shows that thickness and green<br>
strength decreased as roll speed increased.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The process variables of the briquetting machine<br>
as described in Example 1, ie, roll speed, precompactor<br>
speed and roll pressure, and the briquette density were<br>
used to determine an operating window for this particular<br>
system of briquetting.<br>
The diagram shown in Figure 11 is an example of<br>
an operating window for briquetting with 250 mm rolls to<br>
form nominally 4 cc briquettes out of HG material on the<br>
Taiyo press.<br>
To simplify the curves, roll pressure was fixed<br>
at 150 kg/cm2 and precompactor speed was fixed at 20 rpm.<br>
A series of curves are shown for feed moisture from 4 wt %<br>
to 12 wt %. Each represents conditions that resulted in<br>
the formation of whole briquettes.<br>
To the right of the curves there is a region of<br>
low feed pressure where pockets are not filled or the<br>
briquettes are weak and split readily. To the left of the<br>
curves there is a region where the pressure on the feed is<br><br>
too high. Briquettes shear and pocket blockage occurred.<br>
Across the strength range, below 6 kgf, the briquettes<br>
were too weak to withstand pocket release and either<br>
remain in the pockets or split on release, Above 30 kgf,<br>
further compaction could not be achieved. The briquettes<br>
were thick and began to 'clam shell'. The strength range<br>
of 6 to 30 kgf defined the outer limits within which whole<br>
briquettes could be formed with the sample material and<br>
the Taiyo briquetting machine.<br>
To determine the operating window certain product<br><br>
and quality parameters including yield, density, crush<br>
strength and drop/shatter strength need to be considered.<br>
Once these properties are taken into consideration, a<br>
smaller region can be defined which is the operating<br>
region of the briquetting process.<br>
In Figure 11, this region occurs at rolls speeds<br>
between 5 and 9 rpm and green strengths between 6 kgf and<br>
18 kgf.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Green briquettes produced under optimised<br>
conditions were found to be thermally very stable compared<br>
to pellets formed from the same material. This is shown<br>
in Figures 12 and 13.<br>
Figure 12 shows the temperature profiles for the<br>
inlet and outlet gas and three positions within the bed of<br><br>
briquettes during laboratory-scale induration trials<br>
simulating a straight grate process.<br>
The bed temperatures were measured by<br><br>
thermocouples placed at 100, 250 and 500 mm from the top<br>
of the bed.<br>
The briquettes were found to be be thermally<br><br>
stable when heated at fast rates shown in the figures.<br>
The excellent drying performance allowed the inlet gas<br>
temperature to be raised from ambient to 1340°C in ten<br>
ninutes without spalling the briquettes.<br>
Figure 13 shows the temperature profiles for<br>
ariquette induration that produced nominal 4 cc briquettes<br>
of HG ore at productives of 32 t/m2. d and 25 t/xn2 .d. The<br>
figure also shows, by way of comparison, a typical<br>
induration temperature profile for pellets. The pellet<br><br>
profile was an optimised profile so that pellet spalling<br>
was minimised and fired properties were maximised. The<br>
pellet profile produced pellets with a productivity of<br>
16t/m2.d, which is considerably lower than the<br>
productivities of the briquettes. The briquettes and the<br>
pellets were made from the same ore type.<br>
The high productivities for the briquettes was<br>
due to the thermal stability of the green briquettes which<br>
enabled the briquettes to be heated at fast rates.<br>
The thermal stability of the briquettes was found<br>
to be not exclusive to one induration method and to one<br>
ore type.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
A pilot scale grate-kiln system was used to<br>
determine the properties of briquettes as they exited a<br>
grate prior to entry to a kiln.<br>
The equipment consisted of a pot grate and a<br>
batch kiln. To simulate the travelling grate a LGP gas<br>
burner was used to generate the flame temperature. The pot<br>
grate was capable of up and down draught gas flow. The<br>
temperature of the material was measured throughout the<br>
bed using thermocouples set into and through the wall of<br>
the pot. These measurements were assumed to be the<br>
briquette temperature during the firing cycle. Due to the<br>
size of the briquettes tested, it may be that the<br>
temperature measurement shows the external briquette<br>
temperatures and not the internal temperatures. The<br>
temperature measured is most likely a mixture of briquette<br>
outside temperature and gas temperature at that location<br>
in the bed.<br>
Figure 14 shows how the temperature of the<br><br>
briquettes made from GH material (d95 = 1mm) with a green<br>
nominal size of 7.5cc initially increased to a maximum at<br>
approximately 300-400°C average bed temperature, and then<br>
fell to a minimum temperature at -700°C. At higher<br>
temperatures the strength then increased again. The<br>
strength fell to a minimum value at -700°C, which is lower<br>
than the green strength. This is a critical factor for<br>
transport of the material from the grate-to the kiln. As<br>
the strength was lowest at this temperature range, the<br>
maximum amount of degradation could be expected if the<br>
firing profile included transfer from the grate to the<br>
kiln at this temperature.<br>
For a straight grate process, the bed height<br>
selected for the induration process was found to be not<br>
critical and not inhibited by gas permeability generally<br>
selected to avoid deformation of the briquettes at the<br>
lower parts of the bed while achieving a reasonable<br>
productivity. In addition, at briquette volumes exceeding<br>
6 cc, permeability of the bed was not greatly compromised<br>
by bed height. Consequently, the induration process is not<br>
restricted by this variable as is the case with<br>
pelletising operations. Green briquette bed depth can be<br>
selected to optimise productivity without compromising<br>
quality.<br>
A grate-kiln process may offer certain advantages<br>
in terms of producing a better fired product compared to<br>
products obtained from other induration processes. It<br>
also heats the briquettes more uniformly through high<br>
temperature ranges in a way that reduces temperature<br>
gradients within the briquette and avoids differential<br>
shrinkage of the briquette that may lead to cracking.<br>
Also, as all the briquettes are subject to similar firing<br>
temperatures and time in the rotating kiln, briquette<br>
quality is more uniform compared to the straight grate<br>
process.<br><br>
Possibilities also exist for the production of<br>
briquettes suitable for direct reduction processes,<br>
providing a raw material of a suitable grade is used.<br>
EXAMPLE 8	<br>
Firing temperature was investigated.<br>
Briquettes of GH material (d95 = 1mm) 7.5cc were<br>
fired in the grate-kiln pilot rig, all using the same<br>
firing profiles for the grate section. After transfer to<br>
the kiln, the same profile was applied for firing, except<br>
that the firing temperature reached was altered as shown.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 15. <br>
There is a clear indication in Figure 15 that to<br><br>
achieve suitable fired strength in briquettes of this size<br>
the firing temperature in the kiln should be at least<br>
1380°C.<br>
Figure 15 also shows that tumble strength (Tumble<br>
Index - TI) and abrasion resistance (Abrasion Index - AI),<br>
improved with firing temperature.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br><br>
Firing temperature and time at temperature were<br>
investigated.	<br>
Briquettes made from 6H material (d95 = 1mm) with<br>
a nominal size of 7.5cc were fired in a series of grate-<br>
kiln tests. The grate firing profile was the same, with<br>
only the firing time in the kiln at the firing temperature<br>
being changed from 6 to 9 minutes. The total firing time<br>
in the kiln remained the same, the extra time for the<br>
firing was taken from the rate of heating in the kiln, so<br><br>
that the 9 minutes firing time had a quicker heating rate<br>
to 1380° compared to the 6 minutes firing time.<br>
Tests were also conducted with 6.3cc 6H<br>
briquettes using the same firing profile as that used for<br>
the 7.5cc case.<br>
For the nominally 7.5cc size GH briquettes, the<br>
fired strength increased significantly from the longer<br>
firing time in the kiln. This was due to greater heat<br>
penetration of the briquettes during the firing cycle.<br>
The fired properties for the 6.3 cc GH briquettes<br>
were superior to those produced for the 7.5cc case,<br>
inferring that the issue of heat penetration is a<br>
significant issue for fired property generation of the<br>
briquettes. This result also suggests that when heat<br>
penetration in the briquettes is insufficient adequate<br>
strength will not be generated in the fired product.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
The effect of residence time in a grate kiln was<br>
investigated.<br>
Briquettes made from GH material (d95 = 1mm) and<br>
nominally 7.5cc were fired in a pilot scale batch grate<br>
kiln. They were charged green into a kiln that had been<br>
preheated to either 500 or 1000°C. Firing profiles were<br>
imposed on the briquettes and the total residence time<br>
reported. The results are shown in Figure 18.<br>
Figure 18 shows that the fired properties<br>
improved with increasing residence time, suggesting the<br>
importance of heating the product thoroughly to achieve<br><br>
the final properties required.<br>
The effect of rapid heating was not reduced by a<br>
larger bed depth of the grate. This is shown in Figures<br><br>
19 and 20. The green briquette bed was highly permeable<br>
and did not restrict airflow, as often occurs with<br>
pellets. The maximum bed depth useable has not been<br>
defined, but is likely to be greater than 300mm. This far<br>
exceeded that possible for even the best pellet beds in a<br>
grate-kiln system.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
The effect of the chemistry of briquettes was<br>
investigated.<br>
The effect of basicity and temperature on the<br>
fired briquette properties made from HG material was<br>
determined by firing the briquettes in the muffle furnace<br>
at specific temperatures and times. The results are shown<br>
in Figure 21.<br>
Results for the chemical analyses of the fired<br>
briquettes made at varying basicities produced fired<br>
briquettes which varied in grade from 63.81% Fe at a<br>
basicity of 1.2 up to 65.93% Fe for a basicity of 0.2,<br>
reflecting the level of flux addition.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 21, crush strength<br>
increased with both temperature and as basicity increased<br>
from 0.2 to 0.8. This effect becomes more significant as<br>
the temperature increased across the range studied and it<br>
was possible to achieve 300 kgf at 1295°C for 0.6 basicity<br>
and at 1280°C for 0.8 basicity.<br>
The explanation for increased basicity levels<br>
resulting in increased strengths is related to changes in<br><br>
the bonding mechanism. At low basicity levels, bonding of<br>
the particles occurs as a result of recrystallisation of<br>
iron oxide and the formation of iron oxide-iron oxide<br><br>
bonds. At increased basicity levels, melt formation<br><br>
occurs at lover temperatures enhancing melting of iron<br>
oxide crystals, and slag bonding becomes more significant<br>
giving higher strengths for the same temperature.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Reduction testing, using whole briquettes and<br>
standard reduction test methods JIS 8713/IS07215 was<br>
carried out on HG briquettes that were fired at 1300°C for<br>
10 min. The results of reducibility, swell and crush<br>
strength after reduction (CSAR) are shown in Figure 22.<br>
The reducibility index (RI) remained relatively<br>
stable across the range of basicity levels. The RI varied<br>
from 53.8% at a basicity of 0.20 to just over 62.2% at a<br>
basicity of 1.00.<br><br><br>
The swell index showed some response and varied<br>
from 11% at the lowest basicity to 14.8% in the mid-<br>
ranges, decreasing to zero at a basicity of 1.20.<br>
The crush strength after reduction (CSAR) showed a large<br>
response to changes in the basicity level, ranging from 22<br>
kgf at 0.20 basicity to 121 kgf at 1.20 basicity. This<br>
change in reduced strength reflects the fired crush<br>
strength results and is again related to variation in the<br>
bonding phases of the fired briquettes. The low basicity<br>
briquettes were predominantly bonded by iron oxide-iron<br>
oxide bonds, which degrade during reduction. At increased<br>
basicity levels, slag bonding becomes more significant.<br>
These bonds are more stable during reduction, accounting<br>
for the higher reduced strengths and little or no swell at<br>
a basicity of 1.20. Slag bonding also becomes a more<br>
important form of bonding in briquettes made from GH and G<br><br>
where higher Si02 and Al2O3 levels result in increased flux<br>
additions. Such briquettes generally prove stronger after<br>
reduction as the reduction process does not result in the<br>
breakdown of non-ferrous bonding phases. High grade ores,<br>
such as HC, which require low flux addition rely almost<br>
solely on oxide-oxide bonding and hence have lower<br>
strength after reduction values.<br>
Many modifications may be made to the embodiments<br>
of the present invention described above without departing<br><br>
 from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
