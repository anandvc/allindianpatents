				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>THIS INVENTION relates to the depolymerization of fluoropolymers. It relates in<br>
particular to a process for depolymerizing fluoropolymers, and to an installation for<br>
depolymerizing fluoropolymers.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for<br>
depolymerizing fluoropolymers, which includes<br>
continuously feeding a solid fluoropolymer, in particulate form, into a more-or-<br>
less horizontally orientated cylindrical first reaction zone, with the fluoropolymer<br>
particles entering the first reaction zone at or near one end thereof;<br>
continuously rotating, within the first reaction zone, a central axle from which<br>
protrudes at least one paddle, with the rotating paddle serving to advance the<br>
fluoropolymer particles along the first reaction zone while agitating them;<br>
as the fluoropolymer particles pass along the first reaction zone, subjecting them<br>
to an elevated temperature, thereby to depolymerise the fluoropolymer into a fluoro-<br>
containing compound-rich gas phase;<br>
if necessary, withdrawing a residual solids phase at or near the other end of the<br>
first reaction zone;<br>
withdrawing the gas phase at or near the other end of the first reaction zone;<br>
optionally, passing the gas phase through a second reaction zone which is also at<br>
an elevated temperature; and<br>
quenching the gas phase, thereby to recover the fluoro-containing compounds as<br>
gaseous products.<br>
While the fluoropolymer can contain only carbon and fluorine atoms, it may, in some<br>
embodiments, contain also hydrogen atoms, and even heteroatoms such as oxygen or<br>
chlorine.<br>
The fluoropolymer may be a filled or an unfilled not directly usable material such as<br>
polytetrafiuoroethylene	('PTFE'),	tetrafiuoroethylene	hexafluoropropylene<br>
vinylidenefluoride ('THV'), fluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymer ('FEP'),<br>
perfiuoroalkoxy copolymer ('PFA'), or the like. By 'filled' is meant that the fluoropolymer<br>
may contain elements or substances such as silica (glass), copper, bronze, carbon (graphite),<br><br>
etc which were originally added to fluoropolymer to impart specific properties thereto. Once<br>
such material has been used and has thus become, mechanically, a not directly usable<br>
material, but suitable for use as the feedstock in the method of the invention, it will still<br>
contain these filling elements. In the method of the invention, these fluoropolymers are<br>
depolymerized, and the more desirable fluoro-containing compounds formed therefrom.<br>
If desired or necessary, the solid particulate feedstock may be pretreated to remove surface<br>
contaminants such as oil and dirt, eg by means of solvent extraction, washing or a pre-<br>
heating step to oxidize the dirt and oil contaminants.<br>
More particularly, the fluoropolymer may be polytetrafluoroethylene ('PTFE') with the<br>
fluoro-containing compounds including tetrafluoroethylene ('TFE'), hexafluoropropylene<br>
('HFP'), hexafluoroethane ('HFE'), octafluoropropane ('OFP') and<br>
octafluorocyclobutane ('OFCB') and its isomers.<br>
The feedstock particles, ie the fluoropolymer particles, may vary in size from 5mm<br>
particles up to chunks of a few centimetres.<br>
The residual solids phase may comprise undepolyrnerized fluoropolymer and/or<br>
precipitated filler materials present in the fluoropolymer.<br>
The more-or-less horizontally orientated cylindrical first reaction zone may be provided<br>
by a tubular reactor, which is thus located more-or-less horizontally.<br>
A plurality of sets of paddles or blades may be provided in the tubular reactor, with the<br>
blades of one set being spaced longitudinally along the axle relative to those of an<br>
adjacent set. Each set of blades may thus comprise a number of blades spaced apart<br>
around the axle.<br>
The outer edges of the blades or paddles will then pass along the inner periphery of the<br>
tubular reactor with scraping clearance so that any material that adheres to the wall of the<br>
reactor is thereby dislodged. The paddle arrangement comprising the rotating axle and<br>
the paddles, may include a screw on the one end of the axle adjacent to an inlet of the<br><br>
reactor for supplementary advancement of the solid particles before depolymerization.<br>
The general dimensions (length of screw, pitch of the screw, number of paddles, spacing<br>
of paddles, scraping clearance, etc) of the screw and the paddles may vary.<br>
The tubular reactor may, in particular, be a stationary reactor provided with suitable<br>
heating means. The heating means may comprise a series of resistance heaters, induction<br>
heaters, gas or oil burners, or any other appropriate means. The arrangement of the<br>
heating means may define different heating zones which may be at different temperatures.<br>
While the tubular reactor can be located horizontally, it can also, if desired, be located at<br>
a slight angle to the horizontal, eg up to about 10Â° above or below the horizontal.<br>
The rotational speed of the axle may be between 1 and 20 rpm, typically between 1 and 5<br>
rpm. The speed of the axle may be variable.<br>
The rotational speed of the axle, and hence the rotational speed of the blades, as well as<br>
the angle of inclination of the reactor relative to the horizontal, also constitute variables<br>
for adjusting the product make-up or composition.<br>
The elevated temperature in the tubular reactor may be from 400Â°C to 1000Â°C. The<br>
reaction pressure in the tubular reactor may be either below or above atmospheric<br>
pressure, eg may be from 1 to 300kPa(a), typically from 5 to 88kPa(a).<br>
It will be appreciated that the reaction conditions, ie the reaction temperature, the reaction<br>
pressure and the residence time of the fluoropolymer particles in the reactor, can be<br>
selected so as to produce desired ratios of fluoro-containing compounds relative to each<br>
other or even to optimize the production of a particular fluoro-containing compound such<br>
as high purity TFE.<br>
The second reaction zone will also be provided by a reactor.<br>
The second or post reactor, when present, can be used to assist in optimizing the<br>
production of a particular compound or of different ratios of compounds relative to each<br><br>
other, and functions by increasing the residence time of the fluoro-containing compound-<br>
rich gas phase. The reaction conditions, ie the reaction temperature and the reaction<br>
pressure, in the second reactor may thus be similar to those in the tubular reactor;<br>
however, it is to be appreciated that they can instead be different.<br>
Typically, the residence time in the tubular reactor can range from 1 to 30 minutes, while<br>
the residence time in the second reactor will typically be less than about 5 minutes.<br>
The post reactor may operate within a temperature range of 100Â°C to 1000Â°C and may<br>
operate at a different temperature than the tubular reactor, and within a pressure range of<br>
lkPa to 300kPa(a). The residence time inside the post reactor depends on the specific<br>
product composition that is desired. For longer chain products (&gt;C4) the residence times<br>
are generally longer than for shorter chain products (ï£C4). It is, however, very important<br>
to quench the product after the post reactor in order to form the desired product<br>
composition and to prevent the formation of undesired compounds like the very toxic<br>
perfluoroisobutylene ('PFIB').<br>
By 'quenching' is meant that the gas phase is cooled down from the reaction temperature<br>
of 400Â°C to 1000Â°C to less than about 200Â°C in less than 1 second.<br>
The process is characterized thereby that it does not require the use of a carrier gas such<br>
as steam or an inert gas, ie the fluoropolymer particles can be depolymerised in the<br>
absence of a carrier gas; however, the depolymerization can arbitrarily be effected with<br>
such a carrier gas for a particular purpose, if desired.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an installation for<br>
depolymerizing fluoropolymers, which installation includes<br>
a more-or-less horizontally orientated tubular reactor;<br>
feed means for feeding a solid fluoropolymer, in particulate form, into the tubular<br>
reactor, at or near one end thereof;<br>
a paddle arrangement in the tubular reactor, with the paddle arrangement<br>
comprising a central axle, drive means for driving the axle to rotate, and at least one<br>
paddle protruding from the axle;<br><br>
heating means for heating the inside of the tubular reactor;<br>
solid phase withdrawal means at or near the other end of the tubular reactor;<br>
gas phase withdrawal means at or near the other end of the tubular reactor;<br>
optionally, a second heatable reactor operatively connected to the gas phase<br>
withdrawal means of the tubular reactor; and<br>
quench means for quenching a gas phase that is withdrawn from the tubular<br>
reactor or from the second reactor.<br>
The tubular reactor may, in particular, be a stationary reactor.<br>
The paddle or blade may be sized such that it passes with limited clearance along the<br>
inner surface of the tubular reactor, in order to dislodge any material that adheres to the<br>
inner surface.<br>
The heating means may comprise at least one resistance heater in or on the tubular<br>
reactor. For example, a series of resistance heaters may be provided. Instead, the heating<br>
means may comprise an induction heater, a gas burner, an oil burner, or the like. The<br>
heating means may be arranged to define different heating zones in the reactor, with the<br>
different heating zones being heatable to different temperatures.<br>
The solid phase withdrawal means may comprise a conduit leading from the reactor, with<br>
the conduit being fitted with a suitable valve means. Similarly, the gas phase withdrawal<br>
means may comprise a conduit fitted with suitable valve means.<br>
The quench means may comprise a quench probe, which may be the same or similar to<br>
that described in WO 01/58584 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The second reactor may also be a tubular reactor fitted with heating means such as a<br>
resistance heater.<br>
The feed means may comprise a hopper and conduit arrangement adapted to feed the<br>
particulate fluoropolymer into the reactor at said one end thereof.<br><br>
The solid phase and gas phase withdrawal means may be similar to those of known<br>
tubular reactors, and may be provided with suitable seal means to maintain pressure levels<br>
inside the tubular reactor.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying<br>
diagrammatic drawing, which shows an installation for depolymerizing fluoropolymers,<br>
according to the invention.<br>
In the drawing, reference numeral 10 generally indicates an installation according to the<br>
invention, for depolymerizing fluoropolymers.<br>
The installation 10 includes a horizontally orientated tubular paddle oven reactor 12,<br>
mounted on stands 14. While the reactor 12 is shown orientated exactly horizontally, it<br>
can, if necessary, be tilted at angles slightly above or below the horizontal, ie up to 10Â°<br>
above or below the horizontal. In other words, the reactor 12 can be tilted so that its far<br>
end 18 is located at a higher level than its near end 16, or can be tilted so that its far end is<br>
located at a lower level than its near end 16. In such case, it shall naturally be provided<br>
with suitable adjustment means (not shown) for adjusting its degree of tilt, eg with a<br>
cradle-like fulcrum mounted on one of the stands 14 and a hydraulic or mechanical height<br>
adjusting drive supportively mounted on the other stand 14. Alternatively, the reactor<br>
may have a pivot point at the centre of a support framework. Manual or automatic means<br>
for adjusting the height may be used, and may be situated on either end of the reactor so<br>
that the reactor pivots to a position above or below the horizontal.<br>
The reactor 12 includes a paddle arrangement 19 comprising a central axle 20 which is<br>
rotatably mounted in the ends 16 and 18 of the reactor, and which is provided with drive<br>
means in the form of a speed controllable electric motor 22. At the near end 16 of the<br>
reactor, a feed screw 24 is provided around the axle 20. A plurality of circumferentially<br>
and longitudinally spaced paddles or blades 26 protrude radially outwardly from the axle<br>
20. Each blade or paddle 26 may be in the form of a solid plate. Instead, however, each<br>
blade 26 may be in the form of one or more spokes protruding outwardly from the axle<br>
and a blade or paddle component mounted to the distal ends of the spokes.  The paddles<br><br>
or blades 26 are sized such that they pass with limited or scraping clearance around the<br>
inside of the wall of the reactor 12 as the axle 20 rotates.<br>
A number of sets of the blades or paddles 26 are thus provided, with each set of blades<br>
being spaced longitudinally along the axle 20 relative to an adjacent set of blades. Each<br>
set of blades comprises a number of blades, eg 4, circumferentially or symmetrically<br>
spaced about the axle 20. The blades or paddles 26 of one set are staggered relative to<br>
those of an adjacent set, when the arrangement 19 is viewed end-on.<br>
By means of the speed control motor 22, the rotational speed of the axle 20 and hence of<br>
the screw 24 and paddles 26, can be varied between 1 and 20 rpm, eg between 1 and 5<br>
rpm.<br>
A polymer inlet 28 is provided in the reactor near its end 16, with a screw feeder 30<br>
leading from a fluoropolymer hopper 32 to the inlet 28.<br>
A solids phase outlet 34 is provided in the reactor at the end 18, as is a gas phase outlet<br>
36. The outlet 34 is provided with a double valve system (not shown) for withdrawing<br>
solid phase while maintaining reactor pressure.<br>
The reactor 12 is also provided with pressure control means (not shown) for controlling<br>
the pressure in it. The pressure control means may comprise a vacuum pump connected<br>
downstream of the gaseous outlet 36 and suitable vacuum seals on the central axis where<br>
it is rotatably mounted in the ends 16 and 18 of the reactor.<br>
A second or post reactor 38, which is also of tubular form and which is provided with a<br>
resistance heater, is mounted vertically to the outlet 36, while a quench probe 40 is in turn<br>
mounted to an outlet of the reactor 38. The quench probe 40 is self-cleaning, and can be<br>
as described in WO 01/58584 which is hence incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The quench probe 40 thus includes an elongate water cooled cylindrical outer component.<br>
The outer component has a central passageway into which protrudes equally spaced<br>
elongate  radially  inwardly protruding teeth  or scrapers  (not  shown).     Inside the<br><br>
passageway of the outer component is located, with peripheral clearance, an elongate<br>
water cooled cylindrical inner component (not shown). Equally spaced elongate radially<br>
outwardly protruding teeth or scrapers (not shown) are provided on the inner component,<br>
with the teeth of the one component being spaced circumferentially from the teeth on the<br>
other component. The teeth may extend the full length of the inner and outer<br>
components, and the inner and outer components may be of substantially the same length.<br>
The inner component is provided with drive means (not shown) such as a spring loaded<br>
piston driven arm, for driving it to oscillate relative to the outer component. Removal of<br>
solid contaminants from the inner and outer components is thus achieved by the<br>
oscillating teeth.<br>
The quench probe 40 is thus a double annular water cooled probe designed to cool the gas<br>
phase that forms inside the reactor 12, down from 600Â°C to 800Â°C to below 200Â°C, eg to<br>
ambient temperature, in less than 1 second. The probe is self-cleaning to prevent<br>
blockages thereof since solidified or sublimated material forms on the surfaces of the<br>
probe in use.<br>
The reactor 12 is heated by means of a plurality of longitudinally spaced resistance<br>
heaters 42.<br>
In use, particles of a filled or unfilled solid fluoropolymer, eg PTFE, are fed from the<br>
hopper 32, by means of the screw feeder 30, into the reactor inlet 28. Initially the<br>
particulate fluoropolymer is advanced along the reactor by means of the screw 24,<br>
whereafter its further general advancement along the reactor is effected by means of the<br>
rotating paddles 26, which also serve simultaneously to agitate the particles. The rotating<br>
paddles 26 enhance continuous movement, and consequently also heat transfer, of the<br>
fluoropolymer through the reactor 12. The paddles 26 also provide a scraping action that<br>
constantly dislodges any particles or polymer melt from the wall of the reactor 12.<br>
The fluoropolymer particles may range in size from about 5mm up to chunks of a few<br>
centimetres, depending on the size of the reactor 12 and feeder 30 combination.<br><br>
The process is characterized thereby that no carrier gas such as steam or an inert gas is<br>
introduced into the reactor 12, although such a carrier gas may be introduced deliberately<br>
for certain effects or applications.<br>
When a fluoropolymer such as PTFE is depolymerised, it undergoes several phase<br>
changes. As indicated, it is introduced into the reactor in the form of solid particles.<br>
When heated, it is transformed into a viscous, liquid state and eventually sublimates into a<br>
mixture of fluoro-containing compounds in gaseous form.<br>
The reactor 12 thus has a number of operational parameters, which will dictate the rate of<br>
product formation, ie the rate at which the fluoro-containing gaseous product compounds<br>
are formed, as well as the product composition or slate. These parameters are reaction<br>
temperature, reaction pressure, rotational speed of the axle 20 and hence the paddles 26,<br>
the rate at which the polymer is fed into the reactor, the reactor inclination or tilt angle<br>
and the residence time of the fluoropolymer particles in the reactor.<br>
By using more than one resistance heater, different temperature zones can be created<br>
inside the reactor 12. For example, a preheating first zone of the reactor, extending about<br>
one-half of its length from its end 16, and an adjacent high temperature zone in a second<br>
portion of the reactor, where depolymerization takes place and/or where complete<br>
depolymerization is ensured, may be provided.<br>
The post reactor 38 is also typically provided with resistance heaters, and its function is to<br>
increase the residence time of the product gas exiting from the reactor 12 through the<br>
gaseous outlet 36.<br>
If desired, the post reactor 38 may be positioned further away from the paddle reactor 12.<br>
A quench probe (not shown) and a filter (not shown) may then be positioned between the<br>
paddle reactor 12 and the post reactor 38.<br>
A number of experiments were conducted on a laboratory setup in accordance with the<br>
installation 10. In the laboratory scale installation, the reactor 12 had the following<br>
dimensions: 150mm diameter and 1m long.  Two resistance heaters supplied heat to the<br><br>
reactor which had 10 sets of 4 paddles 26 each on the central axis 20. The pressure inside<br>
the reactor was regulated by a valve mounted on top of a vacuum pump. The outlet of the<br>
vacuum pump was connected to an analytical system where an inline gas chromatograph<br>
(GC) analyzed the product gas on a continuous basis.<br>
In each of the experimental runs, 5kg of fluoropolymer was continuously fed into the<br>
reactor 12 by means of the hopper 32 and the screw feeder 30. It will be appreciated that<br>
the speed of the screw feeder 30 can be adjusted to change the feedstock feed rate. No<br>
carrier gas such as steam or an inert gas was introduced into the reactor 12.<br>
The reactor 12 was fitted with 2 resistance heaters arranged side-by-side along the length<br>
of the reactor, with the resistance heaters having a combined power input of 6kW. By<br>
using more than one such heater, different temperature zones can be achieved inside the<br>
reactor 12, as hereinbefore described.<br>
All solid filler and undepolymerized materials (residues) were discharged, as a solids<br>
phase, through the solids outlet 34 using a double valve system (not shown) and collected<br>
in a waste container (not shown).<br>
The gas phase containing the fluoro-containing compounds that formed as the<br>
fluoropolymer depolymerised, was discharged through the gas outlet 36. In this<br>
laboratory setup, the post reactor 38 was not present; instead, a self-cleaning oscillating<br>
quench probe 40 was mounted directly to the outlet 36, in a vertical orientation.<br>
Quenching, ie the rapid cooling down of the product gases from the reaction temperature<br>
of 400Â°C to 1000Â°C to less than 200Â°C in less than 1 second, is essential in order to reduce<br>
formation of undesired compounds such as poisonous PFIB and to manipulate the final<br>
product composition. A further purpose of the vertical self-cleaning quench probe is to<br>
scrape off all solids that are deposited onto its cold surfaces. This fine powder falls back<br>
into the reactor 12 where it can be further depolymerized or discharged via the solids<br>
outlet 34.<br>
The reactor 12 and quench probe 40 could be operated at pressures above or below<br>
atmospheric pressure.    By controlling the pressure, the yield and composition of the<br><br>
product slate can be manipulated. Controlling the pressure at above atmospheric pressure<br>
is effected by means of natural pressure accumulation in the reactor and a regulated<br>
pressure relief valve, while controlling the pressure at below atmospheric pressure is<br>
effected by means of a vacuum pump (not shown) and suitable vacuum seals (not shown)<br>
and a choke valve upstream of the vacuum pump.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A series of test runs were conducted on a laboratory scale installation 10.<br>
Before each test run the reactor was evacuated in order to substantially remove all air and<br>
moisture.<br>
In the respective runs, 5kg of graphite-, glass- and bronze-filled PTFE, unfilled PTFE,<br>
tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene-vinylidine fluoride ('THV'), fluorinated<br>
ethylene propylene copolymer ('FEP') or perfluorinated-alkoxy ("PFA") were fed, in<br>
particulate form, into the reactor 12 for depolymerization. The fluorine-containing<br>
product compounds were withdrawn as a gas phase through the reactor outlet 36 and<br>
subjected to quenching in the quench probe 40. Any solid residue was collected through<br>
the solids outlet 34.<br>
In each case the reactor temperature and pressure combination was varied. The<br>
experimental results are given in Tables 1 to 5 hereunder.<br>
Table 1 summarises the results of filled as well as un-filled PTFE depolymerization.<br>
Some unexplained scatter was observed among the results, eg for bronze filled PTFE, but<br>
substantially the trends for product composition of depolymerization products were found<br>
to be consistent with similar published results. Generally the TFE concentration peaked at<br>
about 600Â°C and at pressures of about 20kPa and less. With increasing pressure and<br>
temperature the TFE concentration dropped and HFP and OFCB concentrations<br>
increased. The formation of HFE and OFP occurred as was expected at higher pressures<br>
(&gt;50kPa) and at temperatures that are above 800Â°C.<br><br>
Table 2 summarises experiments that were performed on the depolymerization of PFA.<br>
Experiments were performed at lower temperatures (
point of PFA as apposed to PTFE. The results were similar to that seen during PTFE<br>
depolymerization. At low pressures the TFE concentration peaked at more than 97 molar<br>
% and the HFP and OFCB concentrations were at a minimum. At higher pressure levels<br>
the TFE concentration decreases to about 40% and the HFP and OFCB concentrations<br>
increased.<br>
Table 3 summarises the depolymerization data for FEP depolymerization. Once again the<br>
same trends are observed. The TFE concentration decreases and the HFP and OFCB<br>
concentrations generally increase as the pressure increases.<br>
Table 4 is a summary of the depolymerization experiments for THV. Again similar<br>
trends were obtained as with PTFE, PFA and FEP.<br>
Table 5 is a comparison of the waste that is generated when different fluoropolymers are<br>
depolymerised according to the present invention as opposed to using steam for the<br>
depolymerization. From this set of data it is conclusive that steam depolymerization<br>
generates 2-3 orders of magnitude more waste than carrier-gas free depolymerization at<br>
controlled pressures.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
*         These values were obtained from literature.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A further series of tests was conducted on the same laboratory setup as in Example 1, to<br>
confirm the results of Example 1 and to demonstrate the versatility of the preferred<br><br>
embodiment regarding depolymerisation of filled PTFE in terms of the selectivity of the<br>
yield of monomers like TFE, HFP and OFCB even without the post reactor 38 and further<br>
to demonstrate more specifically the effectiveness of the polishing post reactor 38 in fine<br>
tuning the selectivity. It also confirmed that the polymer matrix can be completely<br>
separated from the filler material and be depolymerised effectively and reproducibly. For<br>
the sake of good comparison these tests were performed using one filler type only.<br>
Graphite filled PTFE was selected because of its abundant availability as scrap and the<br>
inertness of this particular filler material.<br>
As with Example 1, the essential process parameters of temperature, pressure, residence<br>
time (and hence reactor inclination and paddle rotation rate) and feed rate were<br>
predetermined by the desired product mix. As the particulate filled PTFE is moved<br>
through the hot reactor 12 by the combined action of the screw 24 and paddles 26, the<br>
PTFE sublimates and depolymerises resulting in the filler material being separated from<br>
the product gas. The solid residue moves through the whole reactor with close contact to<br>
the hot sides, ensuring high depolymerization efficiency (&gt;80%). After complete<br>
depolymerization of the fluoropolymer matrix the filler material drops into outlet 34<br>
where the filler is batch wise extracted without compromising the reactor integrity and<br>
leak tightness. The product gas leaves the reactor via outlet 36 through quench probe 40.<br>
The final product gas is then filtered and analysed by means of a GC as well as a GCMS,<br>
ie a gas chromatograph followed in series by a mass spectrometer.<br><br><br>
Table 6 summarizes the results of tests that were conducted without the post reactor 38.<br>
The reactor conditions were selected primarily to produce HFP and OFCB at the selected<br>
temperature of 600Â°C. During these experiments the quench rate was maintained<br>
constant, but not optimised. This is why significant quantities of the non-monomeric<br>
chains like HFE and OFP as well as the undesired toxic PFIB were observed. The trends<br>
of the TFE, HFP and OFCB were nevertheless similar to those of PTFE depolymerization<br>
in a well controlled small vertical reactor as described in WO 01/58584. The higher the<br>
pressure the lower the TFE and HFP yield and the higher the OFCB yield. The high HFP<br>
yield at low pressures can be contributed to the long gas residence time inside the reactor<br>
(typically 1 minute). Very little TFM was formed as might be expected.<br>
Whenever the desired product gas composition is not accomplished by the<br>
depolymerization reaction the composition can be optimised by means of a post reactor.<br>
The post reactor 38 is usually installed between the outlet 36 and the quench probe 40.<br>
This reactor is typically operated under different conditions than the paddle reactor 12.<br>
For example, in the experiments summarised in Table 7 the object was to optimise the<br>
HFP yield by post reacting a crude gas such as that generated by the paddle reactor 12.<br>
This can be achieved by tuning the post reactor 38 to specific operating conditions<br>
favourable for the formation of HFP. The advantage is that such polishing can happen in<br>
situ without the crude product gas being handled in between at all.<br>
In order to demonstrate that conversion of TFE into HFP can be done effectively by a<br>
post reactor, even if the reactor and its conditions were not yet optimised, a post reactor<br>
38, made of a Â½ inch stainless steel tube, 1.5 meters in length and designed for a TFE<br>
flow rate of 1 kg/h was mounted downstream of a vertical depolymerization reactor such<br>
as that described in WO 01/58584. This was done to be able to sample the crude product<br>
gas before it enters the post reactor. For the purpose of these tests the upstream vertical<br>
reactor was operated under conditions similar to the fourth sample in Table 6 (i.e. 90kPa<br>
at 600Â°C) and the post reactor at a temperature of 800Â°C and an absolute pressure of 88<br>
kPa, i.e. all at near ambient atmospheric pressure.<br><br>
Table 7 summarizes two distinct experiments on unfilled PTFE with the post reactor in<br>
place (Sample 1 &amp; 2), which must be judged against the independent control run (first<br>
row, Table 7) sampled from the vertical depolymerization reactor before treatment with<br>
the post-reactor. In Sample 1 the conversion rate of TFE into other products was a<br>
surprising 96% (only 2.6% of the 73.3% TFE remained). Amongst the conversion<br>
products more than 70% was converted into HFP (at least [75.1% (HFP) - 18.3% (HFP)]<br>
of [73.3% (TFE) - 2.6% (TFE) + 8.5% (OFCB)] = 72%). In total the HFP concentration<br>
was raised to 75.1% of the final product. Unfortunately, during this experiment 13.5% of<br>
the product was converted to the undesirable, highly toxic PFIB. The quench system was<br>
subsequently optimised where after the yield of PFIB was reduced to 7.6% (Sample 2).<br>
However, the HFP yield dropped to 64.9%, but the OFCB yield increased to 10.6%. It is<br>
envisaged that with further optimisation the PFIB formation can be reduced to acceptable<br>
levels. TFE, HFP and OFCB are the high value products that are sought after.<br><br>
The depolymerization of filled PTFE was successfully performed and the<br>
depolymerization product was successfully converted to HFP as an example of the ease of<br>
optimizing the system for a specific product. This system could be operated at a variety<br>
of temperatures and pressures and optimised for a wide variety of products including C1,<br>
C2, C3, and C4 fluorocarbon products, ie. fluorocarbon products having 1, 2, 3 and 4<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
The Applicant is aware that depolymerization of PTFE can be performed by different<br>
processes such as in a rotating kiln reactor in the presence of steam, or in a fluidized bed<br>
reactor in the presence of steam, or in a static oven where the depolymerization process<br>
takes place in batches. These processes can make use of various heating sources such as<br><br>
resistance heating, gas heating or radio frequency (RF) induction heating. The product<br>
yield for TFE is usually improved by performing the process under reduced pressure up to<br>
near vacuum. Since vacuum-tightness has proven to be difficult in a rotary kiln, steam is<br>
often used to reduce the partial pressure of the product gas mixture and it simultaneously<br>
acts as an additional heating source. It is also used to reduce air leakage into the product<br>
stream in view of the explosive nature of TFE. However, the disadvantages of steam<br>
systems are the large amount of waste that is generated (for example dilute hydrogen<br>
fluoride (HF) effluent - see Table 5), expensive materials of construction that are required<br>
to eliminate corrosion problems, high operating cost, additional utilities like steam<br>
generators, effluent handling facilities, etc. These disadvantages are substantially<br>
minimised when the depolymerization process takes place without the addition of a<br>
carrier gas such as steam or any other inert gas.<br>
In case of a fluidised bed reactor a disadvantage of using steam as the fluidising agent and<br>
heat source is the clogging and tunnelling of the very viscous molten PTFE phase. This<br>
may demand either batch operation with intermittent cleaning steps or means of<br>
continuous agitation while maintaining the bed stable and fluent.<br>
The carrier-gas free depolymerization of, for example, PTFE that can be achieved with<br>
the present invention, can be used to obtain high purity TFE, since no contaminating<br>
carrier gas, which is usually in excess, has to be removed. Other main products that also<br>
form are HFP, hexafluoroethane (HFE), octafluoropropane (OFP) and OFCB. The<br>
process of the invention also allows for optimization for any one of these products.<br>
The biggest concern in PTFE depolymerization reactors is the formation of hot viscous<br>
PTFE or low molecular mass solid PTFE that tends to cause blockages, which is a real,<br>
intrinsic problem in the known PTFE depolymerization processes and reactors. After<br>
several extensive experimental runs, there proved to be no blockages in the reactor 12.<br>
Tests were also performed to evaluate the residence time of solid PTFE inside the reactor.<br>
This was found to be dependent on the tilt angle of the reactor and the speed of the paddle<br>
screw.<br><br>
The experimental results obtained indicate that by means of the process and installation of<br>
the present invention, various fluoropolymers can be depolymerised and their residues<br>
handled successfully and continuously with no blockages of the reactor. Depending on<br>
the desired product mix, it is also possible to alter the product slate by incorporating a<br>
post reactor, as hereinbefore described.<br>
As opposed to the disadvantages of steam depolymerization, this invention presents a<br>
novel process and installation where carrier-gas free depolymerization is effected in an<br>
essentially horizontal, stationary reactor 12 with an axially rotating paddle-screw<br>
arrangement 19 at pressures above or below ambient pressure conditions and at different<br>
reactor temperatures.<br>
The installation 10 is able to depolymerise filled as well as unfilled fluoropolymers, for<br>
example PTFE. Utilising the present paddle oven, similar results as those for conventional<br>
depolymerization methods are achieved. The advantages of the process and installation<br>
of the invention over conventional depolymerization processes include:<br>
â¢	Continuous depolymerization of fluoropolymers such as filled PTFE under a<br>
range of pressure conditions of materials that conventionally require batch<br>
processing<br>
â¢	Simplicity of operation<br>
â¢	Less waste generated<br>
â¢	Lower operating cost<br>
The installation 10 may also be operated with a carrier gas if the need for this arises.<br><br>

zone, a central axle from which protrudes at least one paddle, continuously rotates. The<br>
rotating paddle serves to advance the fluoropolymer particles along the reaction zone<br>
while agitating them. As the fluoropolymer particles pass along the reaction zone, they<br>
are subjected to an elevated temperature, thereby depolymerizing the fluoropolymer into a<br>

other end of the first reaction zone, as is the gas phase. Optionally, the gas phase is<br>
passed through a second reaction zone which is also at an elevated temperature. The gas<br>
phase is quenched, thereby to recover the fluoro-containing compounds as gaseous<br>
