				<td>Heteroatora substituted metallocenfc compounds for olefin polyinerization catalyst systems and methods for preparing thereof<br>
The present invention relates to novel metallocene catalyst systems for homo- and copolymeiization of olefins, especially propylene, ethylene and higher alpha-olefins, in the presence of a cocatalyst, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO). Especially the invention relates to metallocenes with heteroatom substituted indenyl and indenyl derivative ligands, a method for tlieir preparation, and their use in polymerization of olefuis, especially propylene and ethylene.<br>
Chiral C-2 symmetric bis(indetiyl) ansa-metallocenes are precursors to highly active catalysts for stereoselective polymerization of alphaolefms. The peifonnance characteristics of these systems are different, the variations bemg induced by size and position of the substituents. E.g. dimethylsilylene bridged 2,2"-dunetliyI-4,4"-diaiyl substituted bis(iiidenyl) zirconocenes developed by Brintzinger and co¬workers (Organometallics 1994, 13, 964) and Spaleck et al, (OrganometalUcs 1994, 13, 954), produce isotactic polypropylenes witlt catalyst activities and polymer properties comparable to those obtained with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts.<br>
The area of electronically altered bis(indenyl) metallocenes has remained relatively unexplored. Previously, it has been reported that halogen or alkoxy substitution in he in
:he present invention concerns novel metallocene complexes I with en oxygen atom irectly bonded to the 2-position of a pentahapto indenyl moiety, e.g., racemic thylenebis(2-(teft-butyldimethylsiloxy)indeny()zirconium dichloride, and their app-cation in polymerization of olefms. These complexes I, in combination with MAO r oflier activators, form highly active catalyst systems for homo- and copoly-\erization of olefins. E.g., the I/MAO catalyst systems polymerizes propylene to ighly isotactic polypropylene. The propylene and ethylene polymerization activity<br><br>
of I/MAO exceeds those of several conventional ansa»metaIIocene/MAO catalyst systems, such as dimethylsilylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydromdenyI)zirconiujn dichlo-ride/MAO, under similar polymerization conditions. The novel catalyst systems are very stable and retain their high activities at exceptionally low [Al]:[Zrl ratios.<br>
According to the invention a new catalyst precursor is obtained, in which a siloxy substitution in the 2-position of 5-membered ring of an indenyl-type compound has been carried out. Thereby it is possible to produce metallocene compounds, in which an oxygen atom is directly bonded to the 2-position of a pentahapto indenyl moiety.<br><br>
