Process for the polymerization of olefins<br>
The present invention relates to a multistep process for preparing heterophasic propylene<br>
copolymers, by using a particular class of metallocene compounds.<br>
Multistep processes for the polymerization of olefins, carried out in two or more reactors, are<br>
known from the patent literature and are of particular interest in industrial practice. The<br>
possibility of independently varying, in any reactors, process parameters such as temperature,<br>
pressure, type and concentration of monomers, concentration of hydrogen or other molecular<br>
weight regulator, provides much greater flexibility in controlling the composition and properties<br>
of the end product compared to single-step processes. Multistep processes are generally carried<br>
out using the same catalyst in the various steps/reactors. The product obtained in one reactor is<br>
discharged and sent directly to the next step/reactor without altering the nature of the catalyst.<br>
WO 01/48034 describes a class of bis indenyl metallocene compounds wherein the indenyl<br>
moieties are substituted in position 4 with a substituted aryl radical. This document exemplifies<br>
the use of this class of metallocene compounds in a multistage process.<br>
WO 05/058916 relates to a class of bis indenyl metallocene compounds wherein at least one<br>
indenyl moiety is substituted in position 5 and 6 with a condensed ring. This documents describes<br>
in a generical way a process for preparing an heterophasic polymer. It describes only the<br>
polymers that can be prepared in each stage without explaining how each step has to be carried<br>
out.<br>
The applicant now surprisingly found that when a particular class of bis indenyl metallocene<br>
compounds is used for the preparation of an heterophasic polymer in particular process<br>
conditions it is possible to achieve in high yield a polymer having an high molecular weight. In<br>
particular the rubber phase of the heterophasic polymer results to have a very high molecular<br>
weight.<br>
Therefore an object of the present invention is a multistep process comprising the following<br>
steps:<br>
step a) polymerizing propylene and optionally one or more monomers selected from ethylene or<br>
alpha olefins of formula CH-CHT1, wherein T1 is a C2-C10 alkyl radical in the presence<br>
of a catalyst system supported on an inert carrier, comprising:<br>
i)        one or more metallocene compounds of formula (I):<br><br><br>
ii)     an alumoxane or a compound capable of forming an alkyl metallocene cation; and optionally<br>
iii) an organo aluminum compound; step b) contacting, under polymerization conditions, in a gas phase, propylene or ethylene with one or more alpha olefins of formula CH2=CHT, wherein T is hydrogen or a C1-C10 alkyl radical, and optionally a non-conjugated diene, in the presence of the polymer obtained in step a) and optionally in the presence of an additional organo aluminum compound; provided that an homopolymer is not produced;<br>
wherein the amount of the polymer obtained in step a) ranges from 5% by weight to 90% by weight of the polymer obtained in the whole process and the amount of polymer obtained in step b) ranges from 10% by weight to 95% by weight of the polymer obtained in the whole process;<br>

The catalysts system to be used in the process of the present invention is   supported on an inert<br>
carrier. This is achieved by depositing the metallocene compound i) or the product of the reaction<br>
thereof with the component ii), or the component ii) and then the metallocene compound i) on an<br>
inert support. The support can be a porous solid such as talc, a sheet silicate, an inorganic oxide<br>
or a finely divided polymer powder (e.g. polyolefin). Suitable inorganic oxides may be found<br>
among the oxides of elements of groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the Periodic Table of the<br>
Elements. Examples of oxides preferred as supports include silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, and<br>
also mixed oxides of the elements calcium, aluminum, silicon, magnesium or titanium and also<br>
corresponding    oxide    mixtures,    magnesium    halides,    styrene/divinylbenzene    copolymers,<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene. Other inorganic oxides which can be used alone or in combination<br>
with the abovementioned preferred oxidic supports are, for example, MgO, Z1O2, Ti02 or B2O3.<br>
A suitable class of supports which can be used is that constituted by porous organic supports<br>
functionalized with groups having active hydrogen atoms. Particularly suitable are those in which<br>
the organic support is a partially crosslinked styrene polymer. Supports of this type are described in<br><br>
European application EP-633 272.<br>
Another class of inert supports particularly suitable for use according to the invention is that of<br>
polyolefin porous prepolymers, particularly polyethylene.<br>
A further suitable class of inert supports for use according to the invention is that of porous<br>
magnesium halides such as those described in International application WO 95/32995.<br>
The support materials used preferably have a specific surface area in the range from 10 to<br>
1 000 m /g, a pore volume in the range from 0.1 to 5 ml/g and a mean particle size of from 1 to<br>

on the surface. The support can also be treated chemically using customary desiccants such as<br>
metal alkyls, preferably aluminum alkyls, chlorosilanes or SiCl4, or else methylaluminoxane.<br>
Appropriate treatment methods are described, for example, in WO 00/31090.<br>
The inorganic support material can also be chemically modified For example, treatment of silica<br>
gel with (NH4)2SiF6 leads to fluorination of the silica gel surface, or treatment of silica gels with<br>
silanes containing nitrogen-, fluorine- or sulfiir-containing groups leads to correspondingly<br>
modified silica gel surfaces.<br>
Organic  support materials  such as finely divided polyolefin powders  (e.g. polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene or polystyrene) can also be used and are preferably likewise freed of adhering<br>
moisture, solvent residues or other impurities by means of appropriate purification and drying<br>
operations before use. It is also possible to use functionalized polymer supports, e.g. supports<br>

at least one of the catalyst components can be immobilized. The solid compound obtained by<br>
supporting the catalyst system object of the present invention on a carrier in combination with the<br><br>

Examples<br>
General characterization<br>
Intrinsic viscosity (IV) in decahydronaphthalene<br>
The intrinsic viscosity in Decahydronaphthalene (DHN)   was determined on an Ubbelohde<br>
viscometer PVS 1 with an S 5 measuring head (both from Lauda) in decalin at 135°C. To prepare<br>
the sample, 20 mg of polymer were dissolved in 20 ml of decalin at 135°C over a period of 2<br>
hours. 15 ml of the solution were placed in the viscometer; the instrument carried out a minimum<br>
of three running-out time measurements until a consistent result had been, obtained. The IV was<br>
calculated from the running-out times according to IV = (t/t0~l)*l/c where t: mean of the<br>
running-out time of the solution, tO: mean of the running-out time of the solvent, c: concentration<br>
of the solution in g/ml.<br>
Intrinsic viscosity (IV) in tetrahydronaphthalene<br>
The measurement for examples 1-5 were done in tetrahydronaphthalene (THN) solution obtained<br>
by dissolving the polymer at 135°C for 1 hour.<br>
Xylene soluble fraction at 25°C<br>
2.5g of polymer were dissolved in 250 ml of o-xylene under stirring at 135°C for 30 minutes,<br>
then the solution was cooled to 25°C and after 30 minutes the insoluble polymer was filtered. The<br>
resulting solution was evaporated in nitrogen flow and the residue was dried and weighed to<br>
determine the percentage of soluble polymer.<br>
Melting Temperature Tm<br><br>
Calorimetric measurements were performed by using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC<br>
Mettler. The instrument is calibrated with indium and tin standards. The weighted sample (5-10<br>
mg), was sealed into aluminum pans, heated to 200°C and kept at that temperature for a time long<br>
enough (5 minutes) to allow a complete melting of all the crystallites. Successively, after cooling<br>
at 20°C/min to -20°C. After standing 5 minutes at 0°C, the sample was heated to 200°C at a rate<br>
of 20°C/min. In this second heating run, the peak temperature was assumed as melting<br>
temperature (Tm) and the area as the global melting hentalpy (AH).<br>
Gel permeation chromatography<br>
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out at 145°C in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using<br>
a GPC apparatus 150C from Waters. The data were evaluated using the software Win-GPC from<br>
HS-Entwicklungsgesellschaft    furwissenschaftliche    Hard-    und    Software    mbH,    Ober-<br>
Hilbersheim. The calibration of the columns was carried out by means of polypropylene<br>
standards having molar masses of from 100 to 107 g/mol. Mass average molar masses (Mw) and<br>
number average molar masses (Mn) of the polymers were determined. The Q value is the ratio of<br>
mass average (Mw) to number average (Mn).<br>
Chemicals and characterization.<br>
All chemicals were handled using standard Schlenk techniques.<br>
Methylalumoxane (MAO) was received from Albemarle as a 30% wt/wt toluene solution and<br>
used as such and the silica was received from 1NEOS ( ES70Y, 100 microns).<br>

was prepared according to the procedure described in WO 01/48034. Preparation of supported catalyst system<br>
6,3 g SiC&gt;2 are placed in a round flask equipped with a KPG stirrer and suspended at 0 °C in 30 ml toluene. Via a dropping funnel 15.1 ml MAO are slowly added at 0 °C. After addition, the suspension is allowed to come to room temperature (RT), and is then stirred for 2 h. The reaction mixture is placed in a stirred glass flask equipped with filter (size P3), where the solvent is filtered off. The residual is suspended in 20 ml toluene, stirred for 15 min at room temperature, and filtered. The support is suspended in 20 ml toluene, then brought to 80°C, and stirred for 30 min at this temperature before hot filtration. Again, the support is suspended in 20 ml toluene, then brought to 80°C, and stirred for 30 min at this temperature before hot filtration. The MAO/silica is suspended at 15 °C in 20 ml toluene. Under stirring, a solution of 0.25 mmol (207 mg, 40|imol/g carrier) of the metallocene indicated in table 1 in 2 ml MAO and 2 ml toluene is slowly added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 h at 15 °C, and after raising the temperature to 40 °C, again stirred for 2 h. Then, it is filtered. The residual solid is washed 3 times at 60 °C with 20 ml toluene each (stirring: 3 x 30 min). After the last filtration, the reaction product is transferred with some toluene into a glass ftit (size P3), and filtered again. The catalyst is transfer after drying at RT in high vacuum until weight constant. Polymerization examples 1-3 (multistep polymerization) Step a)<br><br>
A 2.5 L autoclave, previously kept overnight under nitrogen purge, is added with 2 mmol<br>
Triethylaluminum (TEA) (as 10% w/v hexane solution) as reactor scavenger. Also 0.5 bar-g of<br>
propylene are fed to prevent air insertion in the reactor.<br>
Prepolymerization: 252 g propylene are fed in the autoclave at 0°C. The catalytic system is<br>
injected in the reactor and propylene is prepolymerized at 30°C for 5 minutes. At the end of this<br>
step the reactor temperature was raised from 30 to 70°C (in 10 minutes). During the temperature<br>
increase also 59 cc H2 are fed, corresponding to 2.63 mmol H2.<br>
Propylene polymerization in bulk this step is carried out at 30 bar-g pressure and 70°C until the<br>
liquid propylene is totally consumed, and the pressure inside the reactor starts to decrease. When<br>
this step is completed, the PP matrix polymerization time is recorded and the pressure is released<br>
down to 0.1 bar-g propylene; at the same time the temperature decreases to 30°C.<br>
Stepb)<br>
Ethylene and propylene at a molar ratio ethylene(C2)/propylene(C3)+ethylene(C2) of 0.5 are fed<br>
in the reactor to reach the pressure of 21 bar-g then the temperature is raised to 60°C and the<br>
ethylene/propylene mixture is fed at constant pressure until 232g of monomers are consumed.<br>
Then the reactor is vented and cooled down to room temperature; thus, the reaction is stopped.<br>
The polymer is collected and dried at reduced pressure and 60°C.<br>
The resulting polymer has been subjected to xylene extraction at 25°C according to the procedure<br>
described above. The fraction of polymer soluble in xylene at 25°C has been taken as the amount<br>
of ethylene propylene copolymers produced in the process. The polymerization data are reported<br>
in table 1.<br><br><br>
A 2.5 L autoclave, previously kept overnight under nitrogen purge, is added with 2 mmol Triethylaluminum (TEA) (as 10% w/v hexane solution) as reactor scavenger. Also 0.5 bar-g of propylene are fed to prevent air insertion in the reactor.<br>
Prepolymerization: 134 g propylene are fed in the autoclave at 0°C. The catalytic system is injected in the reactor and propylene is prepolymerized at 30°C for 5 minutes. At the end of this step the reactor temperature was raised from 30 to 80°C (in 10 minutes). Propylene polymerization in gas phase: this step is carried out at 24 bar-g pressure and 80°C until 70 grams of propylene are consumed and the pressure inside the reactor starts to decrease. When this step is<br><br>
completed, the PP matrix polymerization time is recorded and the pressure is released down to<br>
0.1 bar-g propylene; at the same time the temperature decreases to 30°C.<br>
Step b) Ethylene and propylene are fed in the reactor at a molar ratio (ethylene (propylene +<br>
ethylene)) of 0.3 and the temperature is raised to reach the pressure of 21 bar-g and the<br>
temperature of 70°C. Then the ethylene/propylene mixture is fed at constant pressure until 23 2g<br>
of monomers are consumed.<br>
Then the reactor is vented and cooled down to room temperature; thus, the reaction is stopped.<br>
The polymer is collected and dried at reduced pressure and temperature.<br>
