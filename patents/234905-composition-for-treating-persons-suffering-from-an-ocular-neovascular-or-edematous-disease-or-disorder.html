				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
This application claims priority from U.S.S.N. 60/425,574, filed November 12,2002.<br>
There are many agents known to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). For example, steroids functioning to inhibit angiogenesis in the presence of heparin or specific heparin fragments are disclosed in Crum, et al., A New Class of Steroids Inhibits Angiogenesis in the Presence of Heparin or a Heparin Fragment, Science, Vol. 230:1375-1378, December 20,1985. The authors refer to such steroids as "angiostatic" steroids. Included within this class of steroids found to bo angio* ta% are the dihydrc- a \ leirahydro metabolites of co'%o! and cortexolone. In a follow-up study diiecled to testing a hypothesis as to the mechanism by which the steroids inhibit angiogenesis, it was shown that heparin/angiostatic steroid compositions cause dissolution of the basement membrane scaffolding to which anchorage dependent endothelia are attached resulting in capillary involution; see, Ingber, et al., A Possible Mechanism for Inhibition of Angiogenesis by Angiostatic Steroids: Induction of Capillary Basement Membrane Dissolution, Endocrinology Vol. 119:1768-1775,1986.<br>
A group of tetrahydro steroids useful in inhibiting angiogenesis is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,975,537, Aristoff, et al. The compounds are disclosed for use in treating head trauma, spinal trauma, septic or traumatic shock, stroke, and hemorrhage shock. In addition, the patent discusses the utility of these compounds in embryo implantation and in the treatment of cancer, arthritis, and arteriosclerosis. Some of the steroids disclosed in Aristoff et al. are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,771,042 in combination with heparin or a heparin fragment for inhibiting angiogenesis in a warm blooded animal.<br>
Compositions of hydrocortisone, "tetrahydrocortisol-S," and U-72.745G, each in combination with a beta cyclodextrin, have been shown to inhibit corneal neovascularization: Li, et al., Angiostatic Steroids Potentiated by Sulphated Cyclodextrin Inhibit Corneal Neovascularization, Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Vol. 32(11):2898-2905, October, 1991. The steroids alone reduce neovascularization somewhat but are not effective alone in effecting regression of neovascularization.<br>
Tetrahydrocortisol (THF) has been disclosed as an angiostatic steroid in Folkman, et al., Angiostatic Steroids, Ann. Surg., Vol. 206(3), 1987, wherein it is suggested angiostatic steroids may have potential use for diseases dominated by abnormal neovascularization, including diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, and retrolental fibroplasia.<br>
It has been previously shown that certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can inhibit angiogenesis and vascular edema in pathologic conditions. The ability of most NSAIDs to influence vascular permeability, leading to edema, and angiogenesis appears to be associated with their ability to block the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (COX-1 an
As described in commonly owned U.S. application Serial No. 09/929,381, it was found that certain 3-benzoylphenlacetic acids and derivatives, which are NSAIDs, are useful for treating angiogenesis-related disorders.<br>
Histones are nuclear proteins that form octameric particles around which chromosomal DMA is wound in a repeating fashion. This DMA storage mode helps to fit extremely long DMA molecules in the nucleus, helps to stabilize DMA against damage, and serves to regulate the accessibility of DMA to transcription factors. Histones have long, positively charged lysine tails that are electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA, thus serving to form the DNA-histone complex. In this state transcription factors do not have access to DNA, and therefore gene expression is repressed. Acetylation of the lysine nitrogens causes local unwinding of the DNA-histone complex and allows transcription factor access, thus facilitating gene expression. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme family catalyze the conversion of N-acetylated lysines back to the unacetylated state, causing re-formation of the histone-DNA complex and thus repress gene transcription.<br>
One theory is to the oncogenic transformation of a cell j-osits fhe importance of the imbalance between pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogen ic signals. More specifically, loss of function mutations in genes coding for tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53 and p21, have been correlated with cancer progression. Agents that promote the expression of tumor suppressor proteins and/or induce poorly differentiated cancer cells to undergo differentiation are the subject of many approaches to cancer therapy.<br>
The HDAC enzyme family, by repressing gene transcription, repress the expression of pro-differentiation and tumor-suppiessor proteins. Thus inhibition of this enzyme family is being investigated as an anti-cancer therapeutic strategy. In particular, several HDAC inhibitors have shown promise in pre-clininal models of various cancers. For example, the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been reported to be a potent inducer of cancer cell differentiation (Munster et. al., Cancer Research, Vol. 61:8492-8497, 2001), to arrest cancer cell growth in vitro (Butler et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 99:11700-11705, 2002), to shrink tumors in animal models (Butter et. nl., Cancer Res., Vol. 60:5165-5170, 2000) showed almost no dose-limiting toxicity in phase I clinical trials including no suppression of white blood cell production, which is very<br>
unusual for an anticancer agent (Kelly et. al., Proc. Amer. Soc. Clin. Oncol., Vol. 20:87a, 2001), and is currently in phase II clinical trials. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that HDAC enzyme activity promotes angiogenesis by inhibiting tumor suppressor protein expression (Kim et. al., Nature Medicine, Vol. 7:437-443, 2001) and that HDAC inhibitors, including SANA, can inhibit VEGF-induced neovascularization (Deroanne et. al., Oncogene, Vol. 21:427-436, 2002).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to the use of HDAC inhibitors to treat persons suffering from an ocular neovascular or edematous disease or disorder.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Posterior segment neovascularization is the vision-threatening pathology responsible for the two most common causes of acquired blindness in developed countries: exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic ;etinopathy (I"JR). Currently the only approved treatments for the posterior segment NV that occurs during exudative AMD are laser photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy with Visudyne®; both therapies involve occlusion of affected vasculature which results in localized laser-induced damage to the retina. Surgical interventions with vitrectomy and membrane removal are the only options currently available for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. No strictly pharmacologic treatment has been approved for use against posterior segment NV, although several different compounds are being evaluated clinically, including, for example, anecortave acetate (Alcon, Inc.), EYE 001 (Eyetech), and rhuFabV2 (Genentech) for AMD and LY333531 (Lilly) and Fluocinolone (Bausch &amp; Lomb) for diabetic macular edema.<br>
In addition to changes in the retinal microvasculature induced by hyperglycemia in diabetic patients leading to macular edema, proliferation of neovascular membranes is also associated with vascular leakage and edema of the retina. Where edema involves the macula, visual acuity worsens. In diabetic retinopathy, macular edema is the major cause of vision loss. Like angiogenic disorders, la*er photocoagulation is used to stabilize or resolve the edematous condition. While reducing further development of edema, laser photocoagulationis a cytodestructive procedure, that, unfortunately will alter the visual field of the affected eye.<br>
An effective pharmacologic therapy for ocular NV and edema would likely provide substantial efficacy to the patient, in many diseases thereby avoiding invasive surgical or damaging laser procedures. Effective treatment of the NV and edema would improve the patient's quality of life and productivity within society. Also, societal costs associated with providing assistance and health care to the blind could be dramatically reduced.<br>
It is believed that HDAC inhibitors (Compounds) among other utilities, inhibit VEGF induced neovascularization and are therefore useful for treating a human patient suffering from an ocular NV or edematous disease or disorder, such as, diabetic retinopathy, chronic glaucoma, retinal detachment, sickle cell retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, rubeosis iritis, uveitis, neoplasms, Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis, neovascular glaucoma, comeal neovascularization, neovascularization resulting from combined vitrectomy and lensectomy, retinal ischemia, choroidal vascular insufficiency, choroidal thiombosis, carotid artery ischemia, contusive ocular injury, retinopathy uf prematurity, retinal vein occlusion, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, comeal angiogenesis, retinal microvasculopathy, and retinal (macular) edema. They are particularly attractive given the low mechanism-related toxicity (for reviews on the classes of compounds which function as HDAC inhibitors and are being investigated for oncology applications, see: Marks et. al., Nature Reviews Cancer, Vol. 1:194-202, 2001; Marks et. al., Curr. Opin. Oncol., Vol. 13:477-483, 2001).<br>
