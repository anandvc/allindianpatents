"TWO     STAGE     FLUID     CATALYTIC     CRACKING     PROCESS     FOR SELECTIVELY PRODUCING C2 TO C4 OLEFINS"<br>
EXXON RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING COMPANY, a corporation of Delaware, of 1545 Route 22 East, P.O. Box 900, Annandale, New Jersey 08801-0900 [formerly located at 180 Park Avenue, Florham Park, New Jersey 07932-0390], United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
TWO STAGE FLUID CATALYTIC CRACKING PROCESS FOR SELECTIVELY PRODUCING O, TO C4 OLEFINS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a two stage process for selectively producing C2 to C4 olefins from a gas oil or resid.   The gas oil or resid is reacted in a first stage comprised of a fluid catalytic cracking unit wherein it is converted in the presence of conventional large pore zeolitic catalyst to reaction products, including a naphtha boiling range stream. The naphtha boiling range stream is introduced into a second stage comprised of a process unit containing a reaction zone, a stripping zone, a catalyst regeneration zone, and a fractionation zone. The naphtha feedstream is contacted in the reaction zone with a catalyst containing from about 10 to 50 wt. % of a crystalline zeolite having an average pore diameter less than about 0.7 nanometers at reaction conditions which include temperatures ranging from about 500 to 650°C and a hydrocarbon partial pressure from about 10 to 40 psia. Vapor products are collected overhead and the catalyst particles are passed through the stripping zone on the way to the catalyst regeneration zone. Volatiles are stripped with steam in the stripping zone and the catalyst particles are sent to the catalyst regeneration zone where coke is burned from the catalyst, which is then recycled to the reaction zone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The need for low emissions fuels has created an increased demand for light olefins for use in alkylation, oligomerization, MTBE and ETBE synthesis processes. In addition, a low cost supply of light olefins, particularly propylene, continues to be in demand to serve as feedstock for polyolefin, particularly polypropylene production.<br>
Fixed bed processes for light paraffin dehydrogenation have recently attracted renewed interest for increasing olefin production. However,<br><br>
these types of processes typically require relatively large capital investments as well as high operating costs. It is therefore advantageous to increase olefin yield using processes, which require relatively small capital investment. It would be particularly advantageous to increase olefin yield in catalytic cracking processes.<br>
Catalytic cracking is an established and widely used process in the petroleum refining industry for converting petroleum oils of relatively high boiling point to more valuable lower boiling products, including gasoline and middle distillates, such as kerosene, jet fuel and heating oil. The pre-eminent catalytic cracking process now in use is the fluid catalytic cracking process (FCC) in which a pre-heated feed is brought into contact with a hot cracking catalyst which is in the form of a fine powder, typically having a particle size of about 10-300 microns, usually about 60-70 microns, for the desired cracking reactions to take place. During the cracking, coke and hydrocarbonaceous material are deposited on the catalyst particles. This results in a loss of catalyst activity and selectivity. The coked catalyst particles, and associated hydrocarbon material, are subjected to a stripping process, usually with steam, to remove as much of the hydrocarbon material as technically and economically feasible. The stripped particles containing non-strippable coke, are removed from the stripper and sent to a regenerator where the coked catalyst particles are regenerated by being contacted with air, or a mixture of air and oxygen, at an elevated temperature. This results in the combustion of the coke which is a strongly exothermic reaction which, besides removing the coke, serves to heat the catalyst to the temperatures appropriate for the endothermic cracking reaction. The process is carried out in an integrated unit comprising the cracking reactor, the stripper, the regenerator, and the appropriate ancillary equipment. The catalyst is continuously circulated from the reactor or reaction zone, to the stripper and then to the regenerator and back to the reactor. The circulation rate is typically adjusted relative to the feed rate of the oil to maintain a heat balanced operation in which the heat produced in the regenerator is sufficient for maintaining the cracking reaction with the circulating regenerated<br><br>
catalyst being used as the heat transfer medium. Typical fluid catalytic cracking processes are described in the monograph Fluid Catalytic Cracking with Zeolite Catalysts, Venuto, P.B. and Habib, E. T., Marcel Dekker Inc. N.Y. 1979. which is incorporated herein by reference. As described in this monograph, catalysts which are conventionally used are based on zeolites, especially the large pore synthetic faujasites, zeolites X and Y.<br>
Typical feeds to a catalytic cracker can generally be characterized as being a relatively high boiling oil or residuum, either on its own, or mixed with other fractions, also usually of a relatively high boiling point. The most common feeds are gas oils, that is, high boiling, non-residual oils, with an initial boiling point usually above about 230°C, more commonly above about 350°C, with end points of up to about 620°C. Typical gas oils include straight run (atmospheric) gas oil, vacuum gas oil, and coker gas oils.<br>
While such conventional fluid catalytic cracking processes are suitable for producing conventional transportation fuels, such fuels are generally unable to meet the more demanding requirements of low emissions fuels and chemical feedstock production. To augment the volume of low emission fuels, it is desirable to increase the amounts of light olefins, such as propylene, iso- and normal butylenes, and isoamylene. The propylene, isobutylene, and isoamylene can be reacted with methanol to form methyl-propyl-ethers, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), and tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME). These are high octane blending components which can be added to gasoline to satisfy oxygen requirements mandated by legislation. In addition to enhancing the volume and octane number of gasoline, they also reduce emissions. It is particularly desirable to increase the yield of ethylene and propylene which are valuable as a chemical raw material. Conventional fluid catalytic cracking does not produce large enough quantities of these light olefins, particularly ethylene. Consequently, there exits a need in the art for methods of producing larger quantities of ethylene and<br><br>
propylene for chemicals raw materials, as well as other light olefins for low emissions transportation fuels, such as gasoline and distillates.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,830,728 discloses a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit that is operated to maximize olefin production. The FCC unit has two separate risers into which a different feed stream is introduced. The operation of the risers is designed so that a suitable catalyst will act to convert a heavy gas oil in one riser and another suitable catalyst will act to crack a lighter olefin/naphtha feed in the other riser. Conditions within the heavy gas oil riser can be modified to maximize either gasoline or olefin production. The primary means of maximizing production of the desired product is by using a specified catalyst.<br>
Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,936 to Arco teaches a process for the preparation of propylene from C4 or higher feeds by a combination of cracking and metathesis wherein the higher hydrocarbon is cracked to form ethylene and propylene and at least a portion of the ethylene is metathesized to propylene. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,026,935 and 5,043,522.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,069,776 teaches a process for the conversion of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock by contacting the feedstock with a moving bed of a zeolitic catalyst comprising a zeolite with a pore diameter of 0.3 to 0.7 nm, at a temperature above about 500°C and at a residence time less than about 10 seconds. Olefins are produced with relatively little saturated gaseous hydrocarbons being formed. Also, U.S. Patent No. 3,928,172 to Mobil teaches a process for converting hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks wherein olefins are produced by reacting said feedstock in the presence of a ZSM-5 catalyst.<br>
A problem inherent in producing olefin products using FCC units is that the process depends upon a specific catalyst balance to maximize production. In addition, even if a specific catalyst balance can be maintained to<br><br>
maximize overall olefin production, olefin selectivity is generally low due to undesirable side reactions, such as extensive cracking, isomerization, aromatization and hydrogen transfer reactions. Therefore, it is desirable to maximize olefin production in a process that allows a high degree of control over the selectivity of C2, C3 and C4 olefins.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a two stage process for selectively producing C2 to C4 olefins from a gas oil or resid. The gas oil or resid is reacted in a first stage comprised of a fluid catalytic cracking unit wherein it is converted in the presence of conventional large pore zeolitic catalyst to reaction products, including a naphtha boiling range stream. The naphtha boiling range stream is introduced into a second stage comprised of a process unit comprised of a reaction zone, a stripping zone, a catalyst regeneration zone, and a fractionation zone. The naphtha feedstream is contacted in the reaction zone with a catalyst containing from about 10 to 50 wt. % of a crystalline zeolite having an average pore diameter less than about 0.7 nanometers at reaction conditions which include temperatures ranging from about 500 to 650°C and a hydrocarbon partial pressure from about 10 to 40 psia. Vapor products are collected overhead and the catalyst particles are passed through the stripping zone on the way to the catalyst regeneration zone. Volatiles are stripped with steam in the stripping zone and the catalyst particles are sent to the catalyst regeneration zone where coke is burned from the catalyst, which is then recycled to the reaction zone.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The feedstream of the first stage of the present invention is preferably a hydrocarbon fraction having an initial ASTM boiling point of about 600°F. Such hydrocarbon fractions include gas oils (including vacuum gas oils), thermal oils, residual oils, cycle stocks, topped whole crudes, tar sand oils, shale oils, synthetic fuels, heavy hydrocarbon fractions derived from the destructive hydrogenation of coal, tar, pitches, asphalts, and hydrotreated feed stocks derived from any of the foregoing.<br>
The feed is reacted (converted) in a first stage, preferably in a fluid catalytic cracking reactor vessel where it is contacted with a catalytic cracking catalyst that is continuously recycled.<br>
The feed can be mixed with steam or an inert gas at such conditions that will form a highly atomized stream of a vaporous hydrocarbon-catalyst suspension which undergoes reaction. Preferably, this reacting suspension flows through a riser into the reactor vessel. The reaction zone vessel is preferably operated at a temperature of about 800-1200°F and a pressure of about 0-100 psig.<br>
The catalytic cracking reaction is essentially quenched by separating the catalyst from the vapor. The separated vapor comprises the cracked hydrocarbon product, and the separated catalyst contains a carbonaceous material (i.e., coke) as a result of the catalytic cracking reaction.<br>
The coked catalyst is preferably recycled to contact additional hydrocarbon feed after the coke material has been removed. Preferably, the coke is removed from the catalyst in a regenerator vessel by combusting the coke from the<br><br>
component and an inert catalyst framework component. Preferably, each component of the catalyst is held together by use of an inorganic oxide matrix component.<br>
The active porous inorganic oxide catalyst framework component catalyzes the formation of primary products by cracking hydrocarbon molecules that are too large to fit inside the tetrahedral framework oxide component. The active porous inorganic oxide catalyst framework component of this invention is preferably a porous inorganic oxide that cracks a relatively large amount of hydrocarbons into lower molecular weight hydrocarbons as compared to an acceptable thermal blank. A low surface area silica (e.g., quartz) is one type of acceptable thermal blank. The extent of cracking can be measured in any of various ASTM tests such as the MAT (microactivity test, ASTM # D3907-8). Compounds such as those disclosed in Greensfelder, B. S., et al.. Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, pp. 2573-83, Nov. 1949, are desirable. Alumina, silica-alumina and silica-alumina-zirconia compounds are preferred.<br>
The inert catalyst framework component densifies, strengthens and acts as a protective thermal sink. The inert catalyst framework component used in this invention preferably has a cracking activity that is not significantly greater than the acceptable thermal blank. Kaolin and other clays as well as a-alumina, titania. zirconia, quartz and silica are examples of preferred inert components.<br>
The inorganic oxide matrix component binds the catalyst components together so that the catalyst product is hard enough to survive interparticle and reactor wall collisions. The inorganic oxide matrix can be made from an inorganic oxide sol or gel which is dried to "glue" the catalyst components together. Preferably, the inorganic oxide matrix will be comprised of oxides of silicon and aluminum. It is also preferred that separate alumina phases be incorporated into the inorganic oxide matrix. Species of aluminum oxyhydroxides-g-alumina, boehmite, diaspore, and transitional aluminas such as a-alumina, b-<br><br>
alumina, g-alumina, d-alumina, e-alumina, k-alumina, and r-alumina can be employed. Preferably, the alumina species is an aluminum trihydroxide such as gibbsite, bayerite, nordstrandite, or doyelite. The matrix material may also contain phosphorous or aluminum phosphate.<br>
A naphtha boiling range fraction of the product stream from the fluid catalytic cracking unit is used as the feedstream to a second reaction stage to selectively produce C2 to C4 olefins. This feedstream for the second reaction stage is preferably one that is suitable for producing the relatively high C2, C3, and C4 olefin yields. Such streams are those boiling in the naphtha range and containing from about 5 wt. % to about 35 wt. %, preferably from about 10 wt. % to about 30 wt. %, and more preferably from about 10 to 25 wt. % paraffins, and from about 15 wt. %, preferably from about 20 wt. % to about 70 wt. % olefins. The feed may also contain naphthenes and aromatics. Naphtha boiling range streams are typically those having a boiling range from about 65°F to about 430°F, preferably from about 65°F to about 300°F. Naphtha streams from other sources in the refinery can be blended with the aforementioned feedstream and fed to this second reaction stage.<br>
The second stage is performed in a process unit comprised of a reaction zone, a stripping zone, a catalyst regeneration zone, and a fractionation zone. The naphtha feedstream is fed into the reaction zone where it contacts a source of hot, regenerated catalyst. The hot catalyst vaporizes and cracks the feed at a temperature from about 500°C to 650°C, preferably from about 500°C to 600°C. The cracking reaction deposits carbonaceous hydrocarbons, or coke, on the catalyst, thereby deactivating the catalyst. The cracked products are separated from the coked catalyst and sent to a fractionator. The coked catalyst is passed through the stripping zone where volatiles are stripped from the catalyst particles with steam. The stripping can be preformed under low severity conditions in order to retain adsorbed hydrocarbons for heat balance.   The stripped catalyst is then passed to the regeneration zone where it is regenerated<br><br>
by burning coke on the catalyst in the presence of an oxygen containing gas, preferably air. Decoking restores catalyst activity and simultaneously heats the catalyst to, e.g., 650°C to 750°C. The hot catalyst is then recycled to the reaction zone to react with fresh naphtha feed. Flue gas formed by burning coke in the regenerator may be treated for removal of particulates and for conversion of carbon monoxide, after which the flue gas is normally discharged into the atmosphere. The cracked products from the reaction zone are sent to a fractionation zone where various products are recovered, particularly C2, C3, and C4 fractions.<br>
While attempts have been made to increase light olefins yields in the FCC process unit itself, the practice of the present invention uses its own distinct process unit, as previously described, which receives naphtha from a suitable source in the refinery. The reaction zone is operated at process conditions that will maximize C2 to C4 olefin, particularly propylene, selectivity with relatively high conversion of C5+ olefins. Catalysts suitable for use in the second stage of the present invention are those which are comprised of a crystalline zeolite having an average pore diameter less than about 0.7 nanometers (nm), said crystalline zeolite comprising from about 10 wt. % to about 50 wt. % of the total fluidized catalyst composition. It is preferred that the crystalline zeolite be selected from the family of medium pore size (
 <br>
Medium pore size zeolites that can be used in the practice of the present invention are described in "Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types", eds. W. H. Meier and D.H. Olson, Butterworth-Heineman, Third Edition, 1992, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The medium pore size zeolites generally have a pore size from about 5A, to about 7A and include for example, MFI, MFS, MEL, MTW, EUO, MTT, HEU, FER, and TON structure type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Non-limiting examples of such medium pore size zeolites, include ZSM-5, ZSM-12, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, ZSM-34, ZSM-35, ZSM-38, ZSM-48, ZSM-50, silicalite, and silicalite 2. The most preferred is ZSM-5, which is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,702,886 and 3,770,614. ZSM-11 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979; ZSM-12 in U.S. Patent No. 3,832,449; ZSM-21 and ZSM-38 in U.S. Patent No. 3,948,758; ZSM-23 in U.S. Patent No. 4,076,842; and ZSM-35 in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,245. All of the above patents are incorporated herein by reference. Other suitable medium pore size zeolites include the silicoaluminophosphates (SAPO), such as SAPO-4 and SAPO-11 which is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,440,871; chromosilicates; gallium silicates; iron silicates; aluminum phosphates (ALPO), such as ALPO-11 described in U.S. Patent No. 4,310,440; titanium aluminosilicates (TASO), such as TASO-45 described in EP-A No. 229,295; boron silicates, described in U.S. Patent No. 4,254,297; titanium aluminophosphates (TAPO), such as TAPO-11 described in U.S. Patent No. 4,500,651; and iron aluminosilicates. In one embodiment of the present invention the Si/Al ratio of said zeolites is greater than about 40.<br>
The medium pore size zeolites can include "crystalline admixtures" which are thought to be the result of faults occurring within the crystal or crystalline area during the synthesis of the zeolites. Examples of crystalline admixtures of ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,229,424 which is incorporated herein by reference. The crystalline admixtures are themselves medium pore size zeolites and are not to be confused with<br><br>
physical admixtures of zeolites in which distinct crystals of crystallites of different zeolites are physically present in the same catalyst composite or hydrothermal reaction mixtures.<br>
The catalysts of the second stage of the present invention are held together with an inorganic oxide matrix component. The inorganic oxide matrix component binds the catalyst components together so that the catalyst product is hard enough to survive interparticle and reactor wall collisions. The inorganic oxide matrix can be made from an inorganic oxide sol or gel which is dried to "glue" the catalyst components together. Preferably, the inorganic oxide matrix is not catalytically active and will be comprised of oxides of silicon and aluminum. It is also preferred that separate alumina phases be incorporated into the inorganic oxide matrix. Species of aluminum oxyhydroxides-g-alumina, boehmite, diaspore, and transitional aluminas such as a-alumina, b-alumina, g-alumina, d-alumina, e-alumina, k-alumina, and r-alumina can be employed. Preferably, the alumina species is an aluminum trihydroxide such as gibbsite, bayerite, nordstrandite, or doyelite.<br>
Preferred second stage process conditions include temperatures from about 500°C to about 650°C, preferably from about 525°C to 600°C; hydrocarbon partial pressures from about 10 to 40 psia, preferably from about 20 to 35 psia; and a catalyst to naphtha (wt/wt) ratio from about 3 to 12, preferably from about 4 to 10, where catalyst weight is total weight of the catalyst composite. It is also preferred that steam be concurrently introduced with the naphtha stream into the reaction zone, with the steam comprising up to about 50 wt. % of the hydrocarbon feed. Also, it is preferred that the naphtha residence time in the reaction zone be less than about 10 seconds, for example from about 1 to 10 seconds. The above conditions will be such that at least about 60 wt. % of the C5+ olefins in the naphtha stream are converted to C4- products and less than about 25 wt. %, preferably less than about 20 wt. % of the paraffins are converted to C4- products, and that propylene comprises at least about 90 mol %.<br><br>
preferably greater than about 95 mol % of the total C3 reaction products with the weight ratio of propylene/total C2- products greater than about 3.5.   It is also preferred that ethylene comprises at least about 90 mol % of the C2 products, with the weight ratio of propylene:ethylene being greater than about 4, and that the "full range" C5+ naphtha product is enhanced in both motor and research octanes relative to the naphtha feed. It is within the scope of this invention that the catalysts of this second stage be precoked prior to introduction of feed in order to further improve the selectivity to propylene. It is also within the scope of this invention that an effective amount of single ring aromatics be fed to the reaction zone of said second stage to also improve the selectivity of propylene vs ethylene. The aromatics may be from an external source such as a reforming process unit or they may consist of heavy naphtha recycle product from the instant process.<br>
The first stage and second stage regenerator flue gases are combined in one embodiment of this invention, and the light ends or product recovery section may also be shared with suitable hardware modifications. High selectivity to the desired light olefins products in the second stage lowers the investment required to revamp existing light ends facilities for additional light olefins recovery. The composition of the catalyst of the first stage is typically selected to maximize hydrogen transfer. In this manner, the second stage naphtha feed may be optimized for maximum C2, C3, and C4 olefins yields with relatively high selectivity using the preferred second stage catalyst and operating conditions. Total high value light olefin products from the combined two stages include those generated with relatively low yield in the first stage plus those produced with relatively high yield in the second stage.<br>
The following examples are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not to be taken as limiting the present invention in any way.<br><br>
Examples 1-12<br>
The following examples illustrate the criticality of process operating conditions for maintaining chemical grade propylene purity with samples of cat naphtha cracked over ZCAT-40 (a catalyst that contains 2SM-5) which had been steamed at 1500 F for 16 hrs to simulate commercial equilibrium. Comparison of Examples 1 and 2 show that increasing Cat/Oil ratio improves propylene yield, but sacrifices propylene purity. Comparison of Examples 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 shows reducing oil partial pressure greatly improves propylene purity without compromising propylene yield. Comparison of Examples 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 shows increasing temperature improves both propylene yield and purity. Comparison of Examples 11 and 12 shows decreasing cat residence time improves propylene yield and purity. Example 13 shows an example where both high propylene yield and purity are obtained at a reactor temperature and cat/oil ratio that can be achieved using a conventional FCC reac/or/regenerator design for the second stage.<br><br><br><br>
Examples 14-17<br>
The cracking of olefins and paraffins contained in naphtha streams (e.g. FCC naphtha, coker naphtha) over small or medium pore zeolites such as ZSM-5 can produce significant amounts of ethylene and propylene. The selectivity to ethylene or propylene and selectivity of propylene to propane varies as a function of catalyst and process operating conditions. It has been found that propylene yield can be increased by co-feeding steam along with cat naphtha to the reactor. The catalyst may be ZSM-5 or other small or medium pore zeolites. Table 2 below illustrates the increase in propylene yield when 5 wt % steam is co-fed with an FCC naphtha containing 38.8 wt. % olefins. Although propylene yield increased, the propylene purity is diminished. Thus, other operating conditions may need to be adjusted to maintain the targeted propylene selectivity.<br>
