 passage of time Electricity was also invented and its uses were known and it was found to be very useful in driving the industrial revolution much forward. Electricity as a means of energy gained importance and gradually machines   could   run   exclusively   on   electric   current,   were<br><br>
introduced. The advantages of using these machines were that they make use of electricity to run these machines, which brought in great reduction in cost of production. Gradually household equipments were made to run with electricity. As it was used, the inherent hazard also came to light, which was in t he form of Shocks, short circuits and fire accidents. It was found that electricity should be conducted very carefully to avoid hazards necessitated in developing a safety feature that could help to sustain the above hazards and safe guard Human life and also increase the life span of Equipments.<br>
The advent of industrial revolution has demanded a more efficient and cost effective way of doing things, there was a demand for a system, which could replace the old method of doing work with the help of men and animals and there emerges energy in the form of electricity.<br>
When this useful energy is being distributed through cables due to some reasons there rises a sudden surge in the supply or there is high voltage, resulting in short circuit and sometimes can prove to be very fatal to the person handling the equipment and the equipment itself. These fault current must be handled properly for proper utilization of the energy otherwise they result in short circuits and sometimes fatal accidents. The excess electricity must be dissipated in a very effective and efficient manner by the safety features installed in the delivery system such as Earthing system , safety fuse to prevent any major mishap. This safety features are not very effective in maintaining the system because of the poor power dissipation by the system to the Earth Mass.<br><br>
The Earthing methods consist of any available Galvanized mild steel pipes, Galvanized Iron Plates, Copper Plates, Copper Pipes, Cast Iron Pipes, Solid rods of Steel/ Copper, and pipe inserted into pipe. These are used along with salt Charcoal, and or chemical/ Acidic compound to reduce the soil resistance at the cost of life of the Earthing apparatus.The traditional Earthing is directly in contact with the soil and the chemical, which are used as backfill resulting in fast corrosion/oxidation and they loose their properties hence the risk factor to humans, buildings and equipments increases manifold.<br>
Moreover these methods require constant monitoring and regular maintenance, which is not very practicable, as often these things are neglected or are at the bottom end of everyone's maintenance list, hence whenever there is any fault we fine that the Earthing apparatus is not functioning properly which leads to accidents thereby causing harm to equipments and humans alike. These methods that are being used for past so many years without any improvement fall short of the expectations of today's needs. Also we have come across quite number of accidents, which are results of improper Earthing and/or negligence in maintaining the existing Earthing.<br>
All the methods, which have been described above are being used for a very long time without any change. The modern developments has necessitated in safer methods of dealing with short circuits and lighting strikes. Event he Bureau of Indian Standards only has a code of practice, which is being followed since very long period of time suggesting various methods that<br><br>
could be followed to do the Earthing; no considerable developments have been done since long.<br>
With the advent of more and more sensitive and efficient equipments, which require high degree of safety, the acute necessity for a device that can cater to the needs of the industry and home has become the need of the hour.<br>
The Present Invention after ascertaining these needs of the wonderful modern technology of the Earthing System is an instrument, which is highly advanced in overcoming the above said drawbacks of the existing system. The method described in this specification has domestic as well as industrial applications. The new Instrument developed is cost effective, very efficient, long lasting and requires less maintenance.<br>
The equipment for safe Earthing has a very long life span, has negligible fluctuation in performance, more cross sectional primary conducting area, and more surface conduction area, lending lower expenses, assuring very high caliber of safety to human life, buildings, and efficient equipments by the unique design of innovative approach, using material in an authenticated manner as described in detail hereafter. The Materials are such that they do not harm the soil and it's surrounding and is Non -Hazardous.<br><br>
Description: <br>
For making the safe Earthing equipment a good conductor of electricity is the basic need, everything else is then added on to make the equipment as stable, efficient and safe as possible. However in the present invention the inventors have made innovative breakthroughs in order to make the equipment user friendly, more stable, resistant to corrosion and other natural factors which affect the equipment and its performance, are also able to take on more sudden outbursts of electricity or lightning strikes repeatedly and effectively. The method in which it is manufactured is described herein detail and the materials which are needed to make this possible are also described.<br>
The materials that are needed to make the equipment are:<br>
•	Metal Strips/Rod with the terminal holes on top as shown in figure 1<br>
•	Casing pipe<br>
•	A compound matrix filled inside the pipe surrounding the Metal strip as shown in figure 1.<br>
•	The semi Conical Solid base is provided to protect the Earthing from getting corroded through the bottom.<br>
It is recommended to use the metal strips as it has been found through research that strips are the best medium for the fault current to pass instantaneously and withstand high load currents repeatedly. The metal strip can be of any section viz flat, angular, square,  circular,  rectangular,  I  -section,  Channel  sections  etc.<br><br>
Referring to the Figure 1 it is seen that one end of the Primary Earthing strip is welded/brazed at the centre of the semi conical solid base. The Outer casing pipe is then fitted around the primary Earthing and is joined to the top edge of the semi conical solid base by welding/ brazing.<br>
The Outer casing pipe can be of any section namely circular, square, rectangular, and triangular to house the inner Strip/ Rod of any section as stated for the outer casing. The primary Earthing strip/Rod have 2 holes on the open end as the terminal for connecting wire/strip (grounding Conductor) coming from the equipment that is to be earthed. The cavity between the casing and strip is filled with the compound.<br>
The primary Earthing preferably which is in the form of strip/rods made of various metals like Mild Steel, Galvanized Iron, Copper, Brass, Aluminum, stainless steel of all grades as per the requirements of the customer need and based on the power loadings. The materials depend on the soil, weather, moisture content of the soil and precision equipments for highly sensitive equipments. This primary Earthing is inserted into the pipe which also acts as the terminal runs till the bottom of the unit and is wedged by welding/brazing to the centre of the solid metallic semi conical base.<br>
The pipe of different metals like Mild steel, Mild Steel Galvanized Iron, Copper, Brass, Aluminum, Stainless Steel of all grades usually same as primary Earthing is used for the casing and acts as the secondary Earthing and the periphery of the pipe is connected to the edge of the semi conical solid base by welding/brazing.<br><br>
The solid metallic semi conical base is fitted for the safety of the entire unit from getting corroded fast, since the base is the weakest part of any Earthing system which is buried well into the ground and prone to fast corrosion. It also provides safety while installation lending a very long life by avoiding the corrosion to penetrate inside the unit. The metal for the conical base is essentially made of same material to that of metallic pipe. The unit is filled with the compound whose properties are highly conductive and non-corrosive is filled inside the annular space between the casing and the metallic strip. The unit is the sealed from the top leaving only the terminal to be exposed for the connection.<br>
The Earthing system should dissipate the incoming fault current instantaneously into the earth mass which is taken care by unique construction of encasing the primary Earthing strips/ Rods inside the secondary casing i.e. pipe. The pipe casing is to safeguard and increase the life of the primary Earthing strip. The strips are used instead of the rods as they provide more surface area and also the required low surge impedance.<br>
The invention also states a chemical composition for use in Earthing Apparatus to improve conductivity comprising a low resistance material which is essentially of high conductivity, an anti-corrosion agent, a metallic binder and additives. The chemical composition consist of 20-99% of the low resistance material comprising Carbon which has very low resistivity in the range of 8-42 (μm is used to provide low resistance to the short circuit current. The carbon can be used in any form viz activated<br><br>
carbon or pure Graphite or Charcoal or Mineral clay or combination of the said above forms.<br>
The carbon can also be added with the existing alkali or alkaline metal salts like soda ash or sodium chloride or calcium chloride can also be used in varying composition with the carbon to provide the necessary resistivity there by meeting the customer needs economically.<br>
The chemical composition also has the anticorrosion agent in the range from 2-20% by weight on the entire composition of the compound there by the viability of undergoing the corrosion under the soil and weathering conditions is being prevented. The anticorrosion agent used is essentially Chromium or copper or Zinc salts like chromium sulphate or copper sulphate or copper powder . Zinc compounds are more preferably used when galvanized iron is used as the metallic strip or metallic pipe. The chemical composition also has 2-5% binder substantially of continuous metal phase in the said above composition. The binders used are essentially borate compound or salts of boric acid or borax or inert rosin compounds can also be used as alternative for low power rating customers.<br>
Some additives are also forms a part of the composition to improve conductivity which includes alkali and alkaline earth metal salts as stated earlier.<br>
The compound matrix that is filled in between the pipe and strip/rods maintains a very low resistance for the fault current to dissipate in the surrounding earth mass as fast as it is passing<br><br>
through. The sealant is provided at the top of the equipment which is already known in the art to prevent the compound from natural weathering conditions.<br>
This unit can be fitted in multiple strips with proper spacing so that the surface area can be increased as per the requirement without much ado.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings:<br>
The figure 1 shows the detailed parts of the Equipment for Safe Earthing which consist of metallic strip (2) with two terminal holes (1) for connecting the earthing cables from the electrical system, a Outer Casing pipe (4) made of metal which forms the casing for the low resistive material composition (3) filled in the annular space between the strip (2) and the casing pipe (4), a semi conical metallic base (5) which is welded / brazed to the metallic casing pipe (4) and a sealant(6) usually asphaltic material to prevent the composition from the natural weather .<br>
Uses<br>
All machines and sophisticated equipments are run with the help of electricity, electronic equipments which run on low voltages are being used in the field of communication, software, more or less in almost all the industries which also uses electricity as the power for its working. So all the electrical and electronic equipments and machines need to have a safety feature installed for the equipment life and also for the person operating them.<br>
The traditional methods with inconsistency in performance and gross failures makes inevitable as these sensitive equipment are being introduced in large scale and to develop a safety mechanism and to protect these equipments and to prevent the hazards they could cause during faults the present invention gives the solution.<br><br>
With the use of the apparatus as described herein regular maintenance can be avoided saving manpower, money and replacements for a long period of time.<br>
This method of Earthing system would save the soil from getting affected by the harmful chemicals used to reduce the soil resistance in the existing methods like Sodium Chloride, Charcoal, acidic Chemicals and alkali's.<br>
This method when used for communication equipments can reduce the step and touch potential and surge impedance. In case of Lightning strikes, this system can withstand high amount of load repeatedly and effectively to protect the sensitive equipments from getting damaged as the fault lightning current passes very fast to the ground. This method of Earthing functions very well in very adverse soil conditions with minimum ground development by using natural good soil.<br>
The use of the Safe Earthing System in electrical system both for Industrial or Domestic Purpose to dissipate the excess short circuit current in the electrical system for grounding or earthing, thereby provides safety to the equipments as well the person handling the same.<br>
Example:<br>
The present invention uses Galvanized Iron (hereafter named as GI) pipe for the casing and for the primary Earthing GI which is in the form of Metallic Strip, is inserted into the pipe which also acts as the terminal and runs till the bottom of the unit. To counter the weakest part of any Earthing system, which is buried well into the<br><br>
ground, the equipment was sealed with an EN 8 solid GI conical base for the safety for the entire unit from getting corroded fast as well as safety while installation lending a very long life and constant performance of the equipment. To make it an effective medium through which the high load of fault current would pass instantaneously and repeatedly the cavity between the casing and the metallic strip is filled with the compound whose properties are highly conductive material and   non-corrosive in nature.<br><br><br><br>
