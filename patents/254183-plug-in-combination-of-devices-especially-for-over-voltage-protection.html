Field of the Present Invention<br>
The invention relates to plug-in combination of devices, especially for over voltage protection comprising a pedestal type base and one or more plug-in modules, said modules receiving the over voltage protection elements, as well as contact elements and mating contact elements that are disposed in the base and in the plug-in module, according to generic term of patent claim 1.<br>
Background of the Present Invention<br>
Over voltage protection device according to the art of the day, in many cases plug-in combination of devices consists of a base and a plug-in module is arranged.<br>
In the base, connecting terminals for contacting of electrical conductors are arranged as well as corresponding housing for the insertion of plug-in modules is present. Moreover base elements receive which comprises one or several plug-in contacts of plug-in modules so that the required mechanical and electrical contact as well as the corresponding holding of plug-in module is given in the base.<br>
The actual over voltage protection elements are located in the plug-in module, for ex. spark gap, varistors, gas discharger or similar ones.<br>
In many cases the bases are formed as U-shaped bodies where in the open sides of U-shaped body of plug-in module are comprised wherein the plug-in module is seated on the connecting limbs of U-shaped parts. Moreover the base consists on its assembling side, receiving elements which enables so called rare rail fitting.<br>
The advantage of brief illustrated function stretching between base and plug-in module consists in the fact that in the revision work or maintenance work the plug-in module can be separated without the connecting terminals opened or the corresponding equipment should be switched for voltage free. The withdrawn and separated plug-in module can then be investigated outside of the electrical setup under the help of special checking device and if necessary exchanged or replaced.<br><br>
Prior Art References of the Present Invention<br>
In view of the art of the day for example these are referred DE 36 39 533 C2, DE 295 19 313U1.DE 100 01 667 CI and DE 20 2004 006 227 Ul.<br>
While planning of plug-in contact arrangement between base and plug-in module, one needs to take a note as a special problem, that the wave form 10/350 (is and 8/20 (is or net frequency of short circuit current is laid down for the fall in discharge by its flowing surge current.<br>
Specially in the case of over voltage - lightning current arrestor as required in the market, partly high surge current up to 100 kA should be supplied many times by these contacts for almost free of burning and free of vear. Corresponding inspections are anchored in the product standards for over voltage protection device.<br>
In order to control such type of large surge currents, therefore, one has to choose very large contact force between the individual contact elements. This has a consequence, that the plug-in module according to the state of the art can be separated only with the help of increased power expenditure and in most case only with the help of special tools. Hence this requires an additional tool and has a considerable disadvantage for the application of device. In addition to that it has a potential danger that exists during handling with the tool within the arrestor for unwanted tri pops of a disturbing arch and there exists a danger for the human beings as well as to the equipment.<br>
In such case when the contact force between the contact elements is applied very less, in fact through this the separation of plug in module is simplified, however there exists a danger under the influence of electro dynamic forces during surge current process to give unwanted jumping out of the plug in module from the base, so that according to rules complete function of the device doesn't give any protective measures.<br>
A combination of pedestal device and inserting element is already known from PCT-WO 95/12905, wherein the inserting element for example is a device for protection of over voltage. The pedestal device consists of U-like shape in the lateral view, wherein both the limbs of U-shaped sides, the connecting terminals for supply, a connecting<br><br>
terminal for earthing as well as auxiliary contact terminal are provided. At the back side of pedestal type device, an arrangement for fixing the same is provided on assembly rail. The inserted element is assumed between the sides of the pedestal device and there it is fixed on both sides of inserted elements provided with detent projections which are placed behind all the detent projections in the pedestal type vessel. In addition to that in the cell connector of pedestal device spring contacts are provided, rigid contact springs are provided in the insert elements, with the pedestal type device placed with the locating insert elements.<br>
The earlier known design for the combination of pedestal type device and insertion element is so arranged that the insert element can be exchanged without needing to demount the pedestal type device. The detent projections which according to the description of art of the day very few times a side walls of inserting elements which is turned back the internal surface of sides of pedestal type devices are provided, in fact with the counter detent at the pedestal type device it can enter in detent connection, however the holding forces are insufficient in the direct formation of detent projection on a spring type part of insert elements. The surge current appearing in lightning current discharge lead to such a high forces that even with at he locating device of plug-in module regarding the support unit there exists a danger that plug-in module may move out from support unit.<br>

Fig. 5— A detailed representation of fixed detent insert parts with part wise path breaking cover and pressure plate and<br>
Fig. 6— Various views of detent insert parts.<br>
As it is clear from Fig. 1, the plug-in module 1 consists of support unit 4 and a cover 5.<br>
Under the cover 5 for example the actual active components of over voltage arrester are located in support unit 4 and stands in electrical connection for the plug-in contacts 2.<br>
The plug-in contacts 2 are arranged as large surface metallic blocks preferably at the oppositely lying sites arranged in symmetry.<br>
On the cover 5 designed operative surfaces 6' is located on both sides of narrow sides as pressure plate 6.<br>
This can be integrated economically into the designing of cover elements, since they are arranged moveably on the upper side by a mechanically designed hinged surface 7.<br>
With mechanical force operation these are moved inside on the operative surface 6' whereby a stopping plate 8 of supporting unit (4) can function as path limitation.<br>
The available path of pressure plate 6 is so adjusted that the detent projection 9 steps out from its counter part 9'. (See fig.2) so that locating device is nullified).<br><br>
As shown in the detailed example two detent projections 9 are provided in each case on the front ends, so that plug-in module 1 is totally available over four fixed points and with that balanced out correspondingly and without warpage it is held in the required position.<br>
The surface of activation surface 6' is provided with a structure so that an easy removal of plug-in module 1 is possible without excess energy.<br>
In addition to that the base of supporting unit 4 is carried out as trough shaped bottom of understructure, a coding pin or a remote activated contact 100 is shown.<br>
From the base of above mentioned understructure includes stopping edge, stopping surface or stopping pins 10, which acts as pressure points referring on each of the accompanying spring units 11. (Fig. 2).<br>
The supporting unit 4 shows in the region of understructure detent projection 110, which in complimentary gaps 111 of cover 5, engages this arresting.<br>
The detent projection 9 of detent insertion part 200(See fig. 4 to fig. 6) are carried out as slant or slide surfaces 112 whereby the respective wedge peaks are oriented in the direction of plug-in.<br>
As one can see clearly in the presentation of figures the cover 5 is placed in the lower region which can be moved wedge shaped form whereby the upper part of the cover 5 posses a spherical or arc shaped.<br>
Each plug-in module 1 is provided preferably with two or four symmetrically arranged plug-in contact elements 2. Through the designing of plug-in contact elements 2 as moving part or fixed part it is possible to carry out relatively large surge currents almost wear free by the large surface contact elements. The uniformly distributed on the base the arrangement of single plug-in contacts distributed uniformly on the lower side ensures a uniform homogeneous power distribution so that even with large electro<br><br>
dynamic powers doesn't lead to a deformation or for edge deformation of plug-in module within the base.<br>
The base of combination of devices possess according to the presentation of figure 2 and 3 a U-form. Here it shows the base plate 12 to open U-shaped side 120 as well as a connecting piece 121.<br>
In the open piece 120 of bottom 12 the above mentioned gaps 9' are moulded for the detent projections 9 of detent insertion parts 200 of plug-in module 1.<br>
The connecting piece 121 shows gaps 122 for the spring like mechanical energy saver and its activation.<br>
The open piece 120 posses guiding rail 13 as designed in the invention for easy and correct insertion of respective plug-in module 1.<br>
Further the connecting piece 121 shows on its upper surface a complimentary form to the lower side of understructure of plug-in module 1 wherein lower part of the connecting piece housings 123 are provided for respective spring units 11 which comprises from top an access for the stopping edges 10 of understructure of plug-in module 1.<br>
As shown in the fig. 2 and 3 it is clear that supporting of spring units 11 which are provided in each case comprises at least one helical spring against the base of the pedestal type base.<br>
In addition in the connecting piece 121 at least a gap 124 is provided for a code pin or as access for telecommunication contact.<br>
For reinforcing and stabilizing of total arrangement of base, the connecting piece 121 shows both sides a pin 125.<br><br>
In the plug-in condition (see fig. 3) the plug-in module 1 remains with the cover upper part and accessible to the pressure plates located there.<br>
During the insertion of plug-in module 1 in the base plate 12 carried through guiding rail and the production of required electrical contact between corresponding plug-in contacts 2 and counter pieces in the lower part, the applied mechanical power is used for that purpose in order to pre stress the mechanical energy saver 3 or 11 located in the lower part 12.<br>
This is realized by corresponding stop edges, stop pins or stop surfaces and pressure points provided there.<br>
For example in each of the lower part 12 four spring units 11 are preferably integrated. The number and the symmetric positioning ensure an optimum homogeneity of power effect.<br>
By the definite constructive design of mechanical energy saver 3 especially the selection of a suitable spring elements and their spring characteristics allows varying the employed shifting force and with linked shifting path by a wider area.<br>
During loosening of detent projection 9 from the gaps 9' by exercising a pressure force on the pressure plate 6 or activation surface 6' the detent projection 9 comes into external contact with the gaps 9'. Consequently the plug-in module 1 by using of saved mechanical energy in the spring unit can easily be removed without additional mechanical means or tools.<br>
The design and the way of functioning according to the invention, detent insertion parts for receiving of a special security and mechanically rigid detent connection might be explained clearly basing on the figure 4 to 6.<br>
The detent insertion parts 200 displayed in figure 6 in two views shows front side (right side of display) to sloped or wedge surface 112 which are arranged on a connection piece 201.<br><br>
In the spacing area between the slope or wedge surface 112 an offset 202 is provided, on its base arresting edge 203 are shaped, which spreads essentially parallel to the connecting pin 201.<br>
