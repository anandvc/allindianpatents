A HIGH SPEED SHIFTER CIRCUIT<br>
QUALCOMM INCORPORATED,<br>
an American company of 5775 Morehouse Drive , San Diego, California 92121-1714, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/085990	PCT/US2005/006632<br>
A HIGH SPEED SHIFTER CIRCUIT<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0001]       The present  disclosure relates  generally to  digital  circuits,  and  more specifically, to high speed shifter circuits for digital applications-<br>
Background<br>
[0002] Digital systems are used extensively today in almost every electronic application. These digital systems may be thought of as switching networks constructed with an array of combinational and/or sequential circuits. One type of sequential circuit that is commonplace in digital systems is the shift register. The shift register is generally constructed from a serial arrangement of storage elements and can shift binary information in one or both directions.<br>
[0003| Many digital applications require nothing more than a simple shift register that is capable of shifting the input one bit at a time. However, in some applications, it is desirable to shift the input an arbitrary number of bits in a single operation. For these applications, combinational circuits have be used in place of the traditional shift register. These combinational circuits include logarithmic and barrel shifters, which tend to be slow, require an immense amount of hardware, and consume an inordinate amount of power.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, there is need for a shifter circuit that can shift binary information by any number of bits in single operation. The shifter circuit should be relatively fast with less hardware and reduced power consumption than traditional barrel and logarithmic shifters.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] In one aspect of the present invention, a shifter circuit is capable of shifting a plurality of input data bits to the left or right by a number of bit positions as a function of a binary value of a plurality of shift control bits. The shifter circuit includes a first shifter element configured to perform one of two shifting operations on the input data bits to produce a plurality of first output bits, a first one of the shift control bits being<br><br>
WO 2005/085990	PCT/US2005/006632<br>
used to select the shifting operation performed by the first shifter element. The shifter circuit also includes a second shifter element configured to perform at least one shifting operation on the first output bits to produce a plurality of second output bits, each of said at least one shifting operation being selectable from two shifting operations, a different one of the shift control bits being used to select each of said at least one shifting operation performed by the second shifter element. The shifter circuit further includes a third shifter element configured to perform one of two shifting operations on the second output bits, a second one of the shift control bits being used to select the shifting operation performed by the third shifter element.<br>
[0006] In another aspect of the present invention, a shifter circuit is capable of shifting a plurality of input data bits to the left or right by a number of bit positions as a function of a binary value of a plurality of shift control bits. The shifter circuit includes first shifting means for performing one of two shifting operations on the input data bits to produce a plurality of first output bits, a first one of the shift control bits being used to select the shifting operation performed by the first shifting means. The shifter circuit also includes second shifting means for performing at least one shifting operation on the first output bits to produce a plurality of second output bits, each of said at least one shifting operation being selectable from two shifting operations, a different one of the shift control bits being used to select each of said at least one shifting operation performed by the second shifting means. The shifter circuit further includes third shifting means for performing one of two shifting operations on the second output bits, a second one of the shift control bits being used to select the shifting operation performed by the third shifting means.<br>
[0007] In a further aspect of the present invention, a method is used to shift a plurality of input data bits to the left or right by a number of bit positions as a function of a binary value of a plurality of shift control bits. The method includes performing a shifting operation on the input data bits to produce a plurality of first output bits, and using a first one of the shift control bits to select, from two shifting operations, the shifting operation performed on the input data bits. The method also includes performing at least one shifting operation on the first output bits to produce a plurality of second output bits, and using a different one of the shift control bits to select, from two shifting operations, each of said at least one shifting operation performed on the first output bits.   The method further includes performing a shifting operation on the<br><br>
WO 2005/085990	PCT/US2005/006632<br>
second output bits, and using a second one of the shift control bits to select, from two shifting operations, the shifting operation performed on the second output bits.<br>

[0014] A conceptual block diagram of novel ??z-bit shifter circuit is shown in FIG. 1, where m is the number of input data bits. The shifter circuit 102 may be a combinational circuit that shifts the input data bits 104 left or right by a number of bit positions specified by a binary value defined by n shift control lines 106. The n shift control bits may be in twos complement form. Depending on the n shift control bits, the input data bits may be shifted in one direction up to 2(n-1)-bit positions or shifted in the other direction up to (2(n-1)-1) bit positions. By way of example, in a shifter circuit controlled by 5 shift control bits, the input data bits may be shifted to the right up to 16 bit positions and shifted to the left up to 15 bit positions. The relationship between the shift control bits and the shifting operation performed by the shifter circuit 102 may be defined by the designer. One example of this relationship is shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>

[0015] In Table 1, the absolute value of the binary value of the shift control bits is equal to the number of bit positions that the input data bits are shifted. If the binary value of the shift control bits is a negative number, then a right shift operation is performed. If the binary value of the shift control bits is a positive non-zero number, then a left shift operation is performed.<br>
[0016] The binary value of the shift control bits may be represented by the following equation:<br><br>
WO 2005/085990	PCT/US2005/006632<br>
£aj.2i+(-l)-.2-1	(1)<br>
i=o<br>
where: at is the i* shift control bit; and<br>
n is the number of shift control bits.<br>
{0017]       Equation (1) may be rewritten as:<br><br>
n-2<br>
(-l)^.2-2+ £ (2ai-l)-2(i-,)<br>
Li=l<br><br>
+ a0-l	(2)<br><br>
[0018]       Equation (2) has three components: (1) ac -1<br>
B-2<br>
(2)2 (2a,--l)^^<br>
M<br>
^(-l)*1" •21'-2<br>
[0019] These components may be implemented in a three-stage shifter circuit as shown in FIG. 2. The shifter circuit 102 may have a first shifter element 202 implementing the first component of equation (2), a second shifter element 204 implementing the second component of equation (2), and a third shifter element 206 implementing the third component of equation (2). Each shifter element may be used to perform a shifting operation in accordance with Table 1 independent of the shifting operations performed by the other shifter elements.<br>
[0020] The following example is illustrative of this approach. Table 1 calls for the input data bits to be shifted left by six bit positions when the shift control bits are "00110." The same result may be obtained by combining three separate shift operations in accordance with equation (2). The first component may be solved by substituting "0" for aa. The computation result is "-1", which according to Table 1, requires the input data bits to be shifted by one bit position to the right. The second component may be solved by substituting "0" for a^, "1" for at, and "1" for «/. The computational result is<br><br>
WO 2005/085990	PCT/US2005/006632<br>
"-1", which according to Table 1, requires the input data bits to be shifted by one more bit position to the right. Finally, the third component may be solved by substituting "0" for a4. The computational result is "8", which according to Table 1, requires the input data bits be shifted eight bit positions to the left. Accordingly, if the input data bits are shifted twice to the right by one bit position and then shifted to the left by eight bit positions, the result is that the input data bits are shifted to the left by six bit positions.<br>
[0021] Returning to FIG. 2, the first shifter element 202 may be used to implement [(aa — 1)]. If aa is equal to "0", then the computational result is "-1", which according to Table 1, requires the input data bits to be shifted to the right by one bit position. If aa is equal to "1", then the computational result is "0", which according to Table 1, is a no shift operation. Thus, the first shifter element 202 may be implemented to shift the input data bits to the right by one bit position if aa is equal to "0", and to perform a no shift operation if aa is equal to "1".<br>
[0022)       The    second    shifter    element    204    may    be    used    to    implement<br>
V-2<br>
£ (2a{ -1)-2(M)   .   The shifter circuit 102, the second shifter element 204 may<br>
include (n-2) stages. The / stage of the second shifter element may be used to perform either a right shift or a left shift by 2(I-1) bit positions depending on the value of a,-.<br>
[0023] As an illustrative example, the second shifter element 204 is shown in FIG. 2 for a 5-bit shifter circuit. This second shifter element 204 has three stages. The first stage 208 may be used to compute the second component of equation (2) with /' equal to "1M, the second stage 210 may be used to compute the second component of equation (2) with /' equal to "2", and the third stage 212 may be used to compute the second component of equation (2) with i equal to (n-2) or "3".<br>
[0024] The computational result of the first stage 208 with a, equal to "0" is "-1", which according to Table 1, requires a right shift operation by one bit position. The computational result of the first stage 208 with a\ equal to "1" is "1", which according to Table 1, requires a left shift operation by one bit position. Thus, the first stage 208 maybe implemented to perform a shift right operation by one bit position if a} is equal to "0", and to perform a shift left operation by one bit position if a; is equal to "1".<br>
[0025] The computational result of the second stage 210 with 02 equal to "0" is "-2", which according to Table 1, requires a right shift operation by two bit positions.<br><br>
WO 2005/085990	PCT/US2005/006632<br>
The computational result of the second stage 208 with 02 equal to "1" is "2", which according to Table 1, requires a left shift operation by two bit positions. Thus, the second stage 210 may be implemented to perform a shift right operation by two bit positions if a2 is equal to "0", and to perform a shift left operation by two bit positions if a2 is equal to "1".<br>
[0026] The computational result of the third stage 212 with a3 equal to "0" is "-4", which according to Table 1, requires a right shift operation by four bit positions. The computational result of the third stage 212 with a3 equal to "1" is "4", which according to Table 1, requires a left shift operation by four bit positions. Thus, the third stage 212 may be implemented to perform a shift right operation by four bit positions if 03 is equal to "0", and to perform a shift left operation by four bit positions if as is equal to "1".<br>
[0027] The third shifter element 206 may be used to implement [(- l)aa-1' • 2n-2 J. In the illustrative example of FIG. 2, the third shifter element 206 is shown for a 5-bit shifter circuit. In this example, if a4 is equal to "0", then the computational result is "8", which according to Table 1, requires a left shift operation by eight bit positions. If a* is equal to "1", then the computational result is "-1", which according to Table 1, requires a right shift operation by eight bit positions. Thus, the third shifter element 206 may be implemented to perform a left shift operation by eight bit positions if a4 is equal to "0", and to perform a right shift operation by eight bit positions if a4 is equal to "1". Generally speaking, the third shifter element 206 may be implemented to perform a right or left shift operation by 2(n-2) bit positions depending on the value of an-1<br>
[0028] Each shifter element in the shifter circuit 102 may be implemented in a variety of ways. By way of example, programmable logic may be used to implement the shifting operations. Suitable programmable logic devices include programmable gate arrays (FPGA), ROM memory, RAM memory, flash memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, CD-ROM, and the like. Hardware implementations include discrete gate logic, transistor logic, and the like. In at least one embodiment of the shifter circuit 102, an arrangement of multiplexer circuits may be used as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0029] Referring to FIG. 3, a first multiplexer circuit 302 may be used to implement the first shifter element 202. The first multiplexer circuit 302 may be implemented with (m+1) 2:1 multiplexers. In this configuration, one 2:1 multiplexer is used for each input <br>
WO 2005/085990							PCT/US2005/006632<br>
10<br>
data bit with an extra 2:1 multiplexer to retain the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the input data bits should a shift right operation be called for by the shift control bit a0. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, six 2:1 multiplexers may be used to implement the first shifter element 202 of the shifter circuit 102. For simplicity of illustration, the six 2:1 multiplexers are represented as a 12:6 multiplexer circuit.<br>
[0030] The input data bits 304 provided to the input of the first multiplexer circuit 302 includes the 5-input data bits in the 5 most significant bit positions and a "0" in the least significant bit position. The shifted input data bits 306 provided to the input to the first multiplexer circuit 302 includes the 5-input data bits in the 5 least significant bit positions with the sign bit extended left into the most significant bit position.<br>
10031] A second multiplexer circuit 308 may be used to implement the first stage 208 of the second shifter element 204. The 6-bit output from the first multiplexer circuit 302 may be applied to the input of the second multiplexer circuit 304 such that the 6-bits are shifted to the right by one bit position if the shift control bit aj is "0" or shifted to the left by one bit position of the shift control bit m is "1". The second multiplexer circuit 308 may be implemented with six 2:1 multiplexers, one for each of the 6-bits output from the first multiplexer circuit 302. Two additional 2:1 multiplexers, one on each side, may be used to retain the LSB in connection with two left shift operations, or to retain the MSB in connection with a no-shift operation followed by a left shift operation. Thus, the second multiplexer circuit 308 is represented as a 16:8 multiplexer circuit.<br>
[0032] The shifted data bits 310 provided to the input of the second multiplexer circuit 308 includes the 6-bit output from the first multiplexer circuit 302 in the six most significant bit positions and "00" in the two least significant bit positions. The shifted data bits 312 provided to the input to the second multiplexer circuit 308 includes the 6-bit output from the first multiplexer circuit 302 in the six least significant bit positions with the sign bit extended left into the two most significant bit positions.<br>
[0033] A third multiplexer circuit 314 may be used to implement the second stage 210 of the second shifter element 204. The 8-bit output from the second multiplexer circuit 308 may be applied to the input of the third multiplexer circuit 314 such that the 8-bits are shifted to the right by two bit positions if the shift control bit a^ is "0" and shifted to the left by two bit positions if the shift control bit a2 is "1".   The third<br><br>
WO 2005/085990	PCT/US2005/006632<br>
multiplexer circuit 314 may be implemented with eight 2:1 multiplexers, one for each of the 8-bits output from the second multiplexer circuit 304.     Four additional  2:1 multiplexers, two on each side, may be used to retain the LSB and the MSB under all possible shift operations.   Thus, the third multiplexer circuit 314 is represented as a 24:12 multiplexer circuit.<br>
(0034 J The shifted data bits 316 provided to the input of the third multiplexer circuit 314 includes the 8-bit output from the second multiplexer circuit 308 in the eight most significant bit positions and "0000" in the four least significant bit positions. The shifted data bits 318 provided to the input to the third multiplexer circuit 314 includes the 8-bit output from the second multiplexer circuit 308 in the eighth least significant bit positions with the sign bit extended left into the four most significant bit positions.<br>
[0035] A fourth multiplexer circuit 320 may be used to implement the third stage 212 of the second shifter element 204. The 12-bit output from the third multiplexer circuit 314 may be applied to the input of the fourth multiplexer circuit 320 such that the 12-bits are shifted to the right by four bit positions if the shift control bit a3 is "0" and shifted to the left by four bit positions if the shift control bit as is "1". The fourth multiplexer circuit 320 may be implemented with twelve 2:1 multiplexers, one for each of the 12-bits output from the third multiplexer circuit 314. Eight additional 2:1 multiplexers, four on each side, may be used to retain the LSB and the MSB under all possible shift conditions.
