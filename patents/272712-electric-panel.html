The differential switch comprises, for each of the breaking circuits, a mechanism for interrupting the breaking circuits and differential detection means for detecting a differential fault in one of the breaking circuits of the feeder units, said detection means commanding said mechanisms for interrupting the circuits.<br>
Thus, when an electric overload or short-circuit fault occurs in one of the feeder units, it is the switch of the breaking circuit concerned of the feeder unit that opens, whereas when a differential fault occurs in one of the breaking circuits of the feeder units, it is the breaking circuits of the main unit that open.<br>
In this type of construction, although centralization of the differential function has been performed, constitution of the assembly remains costly and enables the differential function to be withdrawn in operation for economy reasons.<br>

But other advantages and features of the invention will become more clearly apparent from the following detailed description which refers to the accompanying drawings given for example purposes only and in which:<br>
-Figure 1 represents the wiring diagram of an electric panel according to the prior art,<br>
-Figure 2 represents the wiring diagram of an electric panel according to a particular<br>
embodiment of the invention,<br>
-Figure 3 represents the wiring diagram of an electric panel according to another particular<br>
embodiment of the invention,<br>
-Figure 4 represents the wiring diagram of a two-pole electric panel according to the<br>
invention, and<br>
-Figures 5,6 and 7 represent the wiring diagram of an electric panel respectively for the<br>
three figures, according to three different embodiments of the control means of the<br>
breaking mechanisms of the main unit.<br>
In the figures, an electric panel T can be seen comprising a main unit 1 and feeder units 2, the main unit 1 being either a differential switch or a differential circuit breaker and the feeder units 2 being circuit breakers or protection modules.<br>
In figure 1, an electric panel T according to the prior art comprises a differential switch 1 and feeder circuit breakers 2. The differential switch 1 comprises a neutral breaking circuit 3 and a phase breaking circuit 4. The neutral breaking circuit 3 is electrically connected to the neutral connecting strip 5 whereas the phase breaking circuit 4 is connected in series with the different phase breaking circuits 6 of the feeder units 2. Each breaking circuit 3,4 of the main unit 1 comprises a switch 7,8. Each feeder unit 2 comprises an electric phase breaking circuit 6. Each of these phase breaking circuits 6 of these feeder units 2 comprises, connected in series, a thermal means for detecting an electric overload 9, a magnetic means for detecting a short-circuit 10 and an electric contact 11. The main circuit breaker I also comprises means for detecting a differential fault 12 which may occur on one of the feeders, said means for detecting commanding the above-mentioned switches 7,8 of the feeder unit 1.<br><br>
The electric panel T also comprises individual circuit breakers 13 electrically connected to the electric phase line 14 but not protected by the above-mentioned means for detecting a differential fault 12.<br>
In operation, when a differential fault occurs in one of the breaking circuits of the feeder units 2, it is the electric contacts 7,8 of the main switch 1 which open. When an electric overload or short-circuit fault occurs in one of these breaking circuits 6, it is the contact 11 of the feeder unit 2 on which the fault is located which opens.<br>
In figure 2, the electric panel T according to a particular embodiment of the invention comprises a main differential circuit breaker 1 and feeder circuit breakers 2, each differential circuit breaker I comprising a neutral breaking circuit 3 and a phase breaking circuit 4 and each feeder unit 2 comprising an electric phase protection circuit 6. According to the invention, each phase protection circuit 6 of the feeder units 2 comprises only a means for detecting an electric overload 9 commanding control means 15 of the switches 7,8 of the main unit 1. The phase breaking circuit 4 of the main unit 1 comprises the magnetic means 16 for detecting a short-circuit occurring in the circuits 6 of the feeder units 2, said main unit 1 always comprising the above-mentioned means for detecting a differential fault 12.<br>
It can also be seen in this figure that the individual circuit breakers 13 are fed by a phase line 17 electrically connected to the above-mentioned phase line 14 of the main unit 1 and also comprise, as in the above-mentioned main unit 1, magnetic detection means 18 in series with an electric contact 19, said means 18 commanding opening of said contact 19. In operation, when a differential fault or a short-circuit fault occurs in one of the phase circuits 6 of the feeder units 2, the magnetic means for detecting a short-circuit 16 and the means for detecting a differential fault 12 open the switches 7,8 of the main unit 1. When an overload fault occurs in one of these circuits 6, the control means 15 of the feeder units 2 command opening of the electric switches 7,8 of the main unit 1.<br>
In figure 3, an electric panel T according to another embodiment of the invention comprises the same elements as in the embodiment of figure 2, the only difference being that each electric phase circuit 6 of the feeder units 2 further comprises a deliberate opening switch 20 of the phase circuits of the feeder units 2, and also indicating means 21, controlled by the overload detection means 9, whereby it can be known which feeder caused centralized tripping.<br><br>
In figure 4, according to another embodiment of the invention, the main unit 1 comprises a<br>
neutral breaking circuit 3 and two phase breaking circuits 4,22 and the feeder units 2<br>
comprise two electric phase circuits 6,23.<br>
Tripping of the main unit 1 by the feeder units 2, or specific modules, will be able to be<br>
performed mechanically according to principles known in the prior art or electrically when<br>
the main unit comprises a differential function, by closing of a contact in the specific<br>
module, the latter being able to be connected in parallel with the test function of the main<br>
unit.<br>
According to the particular embodiment illustrated in figure 5, the control means  15<br>
comprise a bar 24 extending transversely to the feeder units  2,  said bar 24 being<br>
commanded by the means for detecting an electric overload 9 and commanding the<br>
switches 7,8 of the main circuit breaker 1.<br>
According to the embodiment illustrated in figure 6, the control means 15 comprise an<br>
idle-mounted part 25 belonging to the module 30 actuated by the above-mentioned means<br>
for detecting an electric overload 9, the part 25 being linked in rotation to one same part 26<br>
of a neighbouring module 29, this same part 26 of the module adjacent to the group<br>
incomer unit 1 performing tripping thereof.<br>
According to another embodiment illustrated in figure 7, the control means 15 comprise an<br>
electric contact 27 in parallel on the test circuit 28 of the main unit 1.<br>
An electric panel of simple design wherein the function of the main unit is essential to ensure operation of the system has therefore been achieved by means of the invention. These solutions enable the cost of the global function to be substantially reduced by eliminating the contact and instantaneous tripping functions which are centralized in the main unit, the major advantage being the obligation to have the main function to ensure the general function of the system.<br>
It should be noted that each feeder unit will be the object of a specific module able to integrate more or less functions.<br>
Naturally the invention is not limited to the embodiments described and illustrated which<br>
have been given for example purposes only.<br>
The panel will therefore be able to perform the differential function or not.<br><br>
On the contrary, the invention extends to encompass all the technical equivalents of the means described as well as combinations thereof if the latter are performed according to the spirit of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
