				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to the removal of sulfur-containing compounds from diesel fuel and, more particularly, their removal by a combination of oxidation and extraction steps.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The removal of sulfur compounds from petroleum streams has been of considerable importance in the past and is even more so today due to environmental considerations. Gas effluent from the combustion of organic materials, such as coal, almost always contain sulfur compounds and sulfur removal processes have concentrated on removing hydrogen sulfide since it has been considered a significant health hazard and also because it is corrosive, particularly when water is present. With increasing emphasis on eliminating or minimizing sulfur discharge to the atmosphere, attention is turning to the removal of other sulfur compounds from gas streams.<br>
The removal of sulfur compounds and particularly chemically-combined sulfur, such as organosulfur compounds, from feedstreams is highly desirable to meet environmental concerns and to prevent potential catalyst deactivation as well as equipment corrosion.<br>
Typically, hydrocarbon products contain various amounts of sulfur compounds in the form of, for example, chemically-combined sulfur, such as inorganically combined sulfur and organically combined sulfur, i.e., organosulfur compounds.<br>
The presence of organosulfur compounds in hydrocarbon streams results naturally, as well as from the introduction of organosulfur compounds, into the hydrogen streams during conventional processes for producing and treating hydrocarbon products.<br>
As previously indicated, if chemically-combined sulfur, such as organosulfur compounds, are not removed from the hydrocarbon streams, the presence of organosulfur compounds in the resultant hydrocarbon products, including natural gas, paraffins, olefins and aromatics, particularly gasoline, diesel or other fuels, can cause corrosion of processing equipment and engine parts, as well as other deleterious effects, particularly when water is present.<br>
Oxidative desulfurization research for diesel and other oil streams has been ongoing for over 100 years. The following table summarizes patents granted from 1941 to 1976 addressed to oxidative desulfurization.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Paris-Marcano received two patents for oxidative desulfurization of petroleum using<br>
nitric acid with hydrogen peroxide, U.S.P. 5,017,280 and 5,087,350. Gore of Petrostar received two patents for oxidative desulfurization U.S. 6,274,785 and 6,160,193. Cabrerra received a patent for a complex oxidative desulfurization patent assigned to UOP 6,171,478. Kappas from Unipure received two patents for oxidative desulfurization using performic acid: U.S.P. 6,402,940 and 6,406,616. Ohsohl of Unipure has received two patents, 5,985,137 and 5,948,242, for desulfurization of crude oil.<br>
Jeanblanc received a patent, WO/001 5734, for radiative assisted oxidative desulfurization. Sulfur-containing carbonaceous materials are desulfurized by reaction with a mixture of an oxidizing agent and an oxygenated solvent such as diethyl ether under alkaline conditions at a temperature preferably ranging from ambient temperature to about 121°C and pressure of about 1 to 2 atmospheres. The use of radiation - such as X-ray, infrared, visible microwave, or ultraviolet radiation, alpha, beta or gamma radiation, other atomic radiation emanating from a radioactive material, or ultrasound - facilitates desulfurization. The products of the reaction are a desulfurized carbonaceous material in which the sulfur content is, for example, less than about 1% and separated sulfur compounds.<br>
Yen, U.S.P. 6,402,939, at Cal Tech received a patent for ultrasonic assisted oxidative desulfurization. Gunnerman has obtained several patents using ultrasonic assistance: U.S.P. 6,500,219 and 6,652,592. Stowe disclosed a process to oxidatively desulfurize hydrocarbon oil with ultrasonic assistance in U.S.P. 5,547,563.Cullen disclosed in four recent U.S. patent applications assigned to Petrosonics oxidative, reactive, ultrasonic desulfurization technology: Serial Number 10/411,796 filed April 11, 2003, Sulfone Removal Process; Serial Number 10/429,369 filed May 5, 2003, Process For Generating<br>
and Removing Sulfbxides from Fossil Fuel; Serial No. 10/431,666 filed May 8, 2003, Treatment of Crude Oil Fractions, Fossil Fuels &amp; Products Thereof with Sonic Energy; and Serial Number 10/644,255 filed August 20, 2003, entitled Treatment of Crude Oil Fractions, Fossil Fuels &amp; Products Thereof.<br>
Collins, in U.S. Patent 5,847,120 and 6,054,580 disclosed long-lived tetra-amidomacriocyclic ligand complexes of iron as homogeneous oxidation catalysts to promote peroxide oxidations. The complex provides a stable, long-lived oxidation catalyst or catalyst activator.<br>
Kocal in U.S. Patent 6,277,271 August 21, 2001 assigned to UOP discloses a process for the desulfurization of a hydrocarbonaceous oil This is a process for the desulfurization of hydrocarbonaceous oil wherein the hydrocarbonaceous oil and a recycle stream containing sulfur-oxidated compounds is contacted with a hydro desulfurization catalyst in a hydrodesulfurization reaction zone to reduce the sulfur level to a relatively low level and then contacting the resulting hydrocarbonaceous stream from the hydrodesulfurization zone with an oxidizing agent to convert the residual, low level of sulfur compounds into sulfur-oxidated compounds. The residual oxidizing agent is decomposed and the resulting hydrocarbonaceous oil stream containing the sulfur-oxidated compounds is separated to produce a stream containing the sulfur-oxidated compounds and a hydrocarbonaceous oil stream having a reduced concentration of sulfur-oxidated compounds. At least a portion of the sulfur-oxidated compounds is recycled to the hydrodesulfurization reaction zone.<br>
In another UOP assigned patent, Kocal in U.S. Patent No. 6,368,495 granted April 9, 2002 discloses the removal of sulfur-containing compounds from liquid hydrocarbon streams using hydrogen peroxide on air, with heterogeneous transition metal catalysts. The<br><br>
process more specifically addresses the removal of thiophenes and thlophene derivatives from a number of petroleum fractions, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene. In the first step of the process, the liquid hydrocarbon is subjected to oxidation conditions hi order to oxidize at least some of the thiophene compounds to sulfones. Then, these sulfones can be catalytically decomposed to hydrocarbons (e.g. hydroxybiphenyl) and volatile sulfur compounds (e.g., sulfur dioxide). The hydrocarbon decomposition products remain in the treated liquid as valuable blending components, while the volatile sulfur compounds are easily separable from the treated liquid using well-known techniques such as flash vaporization or distillation.<br>
Cabrera discloses in U.S. Patent 6,174,178 granted January 9, 2001, a process for the desulfurization of a hydrocarbonaceous oil. A process for the desulfurization in which the hydrocarbonaceous oil is contacted with a hydrodesulfurization catalyst in a hydrodesulfurization reaction zone to reduce the sulfur level to a relatively low level and then contacting the resulting hydrocarbonaceous stream from the desulfurization zone with an oxidizing agent to convert the residual, low level of sulfur compounds into sulfur-oxidated compounds. The resulting hydrocarbonaceous oil stream containing the sulfur-oxidated compounds is separated after decomposing any residual oxidizing agent to produce a stream containing the sulfur-oxidated compounds and a hydrocarbonaceous oil stream having a reduced concentration of sulfur-oxidated compounds.<br>
Shum teaches in U.S. Patent No. 4,772,731 granted September 20, 1988, the epoxidatkm of olefins with molybdenum dioxo dialkyleneglycolate compositions. Production of novel molybdenum dioxo dialkyleneglycolate compositions, especially adapted for use as catalysts in the epoxidation of olefmic compounds with an organic hydroperoxide, by reaction of<br>
molybdenum trioxide with particular dialkylene glycol compounds at specified elevated temperatures while removing water,<br>
Shum discloses in U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,655 granted July 14, 1998, an epoxidation process using an alkylammonium phosphate-stabilized peroxotungstate compound as catalyst. Olefins are selectively converted to epoxides using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant in a single liquid phase reaction, system characterized by a liquid phase comprised predominantly of an organic solvent. The reaction is catalyzed by a compound comprised of a phosphate-stabilized peroxotungstate species having a W:P atomic ratio of 2:1. This invention pertains to methods of converting olefins to epoxides in a single liquid phase using hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst in salt or acid form comprising a species corresponding to (RiNfePWjO^OH).<br>
Venturelto in U.S. Patent No. 5,274,140 discloses a process for olefin epoxidation by reaction with hydrogen peroxide according to a double phase technique (i.e., a biphasic reaction system containing both an aqueous phase and an oganic phase). The catalyst system consists of a first component which is at least one element selected from W, Mo, V or a derivative thereof and a second component which is at least one derivative selected from the derivatives of P and As. The mutual atomic ratio of the catalyst components is between 12 and 0.1, but preferably is between 1.5 and 0.25.<br>
Venturello in U.S. Patent No. 4,562,276 and 4,595,671 describes epoxidation catalysts for olefmic compounds, both in a homogeneous aqueous phase as well as in a heterogeneous phase. The catalysts correspond to the formula QaXW^O^-iu wherein Q represents a cation of an anionic salt, X is either P or As, while nK), 1, or 2. The atomic ratio of W:P, where X=P, thus must be 4. The use of such compositions in an epoxidation wherein the reactants are maintained in a single substantially organic phase is not disclosed.<br>
Bonsignore in U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,849 teaches a class of compounds based on tungsten and diphosphonic acids which contain active oxygen atoms and cationic groups derived from onium salts. Such compounds are said to catalyze olefm oxidation reactions in double phase reaction systems containing both an organic phase and an aqueous phase. The compounds contain two phosphorus atoms and five tungsten atoms and thus have a W:P atomic ratio of 5:2.<br>
However, the biphasic reaction systems of the type described in the aforementioned patents have a number of disadvantages which limit their usefulness in large scale commercial practice. The need to use a phase transfer agent contributes significantly to the cost of operation. Mass transfer problems are frequently encountered, particularly for relatively volatile olefins such as propylene. Additionally, there are considerable engineering difficulties associated with operating two phase reactors and phase separators. Thus, there is a need to develop active catalysts capable of providing high selectivity to epoxide during operation of a single phase epoxidation process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of the present invention is directed to the desulfurization of a full-range, hydro treated diesel oil with an aqueous oxidizing agent in the presence of a catalyst and a co-catalyst, and thereafter selectively removing the oxidized compounds by solvent extraction. Optionally, the foregoing steps are followed by solvent stripping and recovery, and finally by a polishing step.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The attached figure is a schematic drawing of the process of the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
9<br>
As can be seen by reference to the attached drawing sheet, hydrotreated diesel in a storage tank 10 is fed into reactor column 12 where it is subjected to continuous oxidation by reaction with an aqueous oxidant and a complex catalyst which is fed into the top of column 12 from a storage tank 14. The aqueous oxidant can be, for example, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite or sodium peroxysulfate which is catalyzed by a complex catalyst, followed by a continuous liquid-liquid extraction of the diesel oil by a mixture of water and a polar solvent.<br>
The process serves to desulfurize full range hydrotreated diesel oil with a boiling range of about 240°C to about 360°C. The process consists of treating the diesel oil in a countercurrent or a stirred tank reactor with an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide hi the presence of a catalyst and a co-catalyst which is also known as a phase transfer agent. This action results hi effecting the oxidation of the sulfur species present hi the hydrotreated (HT) diesel at a nominal level of 1000 ppm w/w of total sulfur. The sulfur species present are oxidized to their corresponding sulfoxides, sulfones, sultines, sultones, sulfonates, sulfinates, or even to sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide and sulfite and sulfate.<br>
The catalyst employed may be selected from a number of homogeneous or heterogeneous oxidation catalysts including tetraamidomacrocylic iron complexes, tetraalkylammonim polyoxometallates, dioxomolybdenum diglycolate, transition metal tetraphenylporphyrin, transition metal acetylacetonate, bismuthomolybdates, dioxomolybdenum aminodiglycolate, tetraalkylammonim metal sulfbtetraphenylporphyrin, molybdotungstic acid phosphonates, as well as many others. These may include quaternary ammonium salts of polyoxometallates, simple metal oxides, Venturello, Campos-Martin, Bressan, Shum, Collins-Horwitz, Beardon, Folin-Denis Reagent, Benedict, Bonsignore, Changwen Hu, Mere Te, Keggin, Dawson, Bearden,<br>
and Merox type catalysts. These may include tetraoctyl-ammonium phosphotungstate, peroxo molybdotungstic phosphonate, phosphomolybdic acid, dioxomolybdenum amino-diisopropanolate, triphosphono-polyperoxotungstate, bismuthomolybdic acid, sodium sulfophthalocyanine cobalt peroxide.<br>
The co-catalysts are employed to enhance and accelerate reactions which though favored thermodynamically, are very slow due to mass transfer issues. They may be anionic cationic and nonionic, with cationic phase transfer agents being preferred. In the present invention, the co-catalyst in each case is the quaternary amine salt used in the synthesis.<br>
These salts do not always have to be pre-formed prior to the reaction, but may be formed in-sttu, by adding the transition metal salt or acid and then adding to the same solvent sytem, for example, aqueous peroxide, the phase transfer agent, such as a quaternary ammonium halide. Representative phase transfer agents are methyltrioctyl-ammonium bromide, ceryltrimethylammonium bromide, tetrabutyl ammonium chloride, tetradecyl pyridhim chloride, and tetradecyl pyridinium bromide.<br>
The oxidation reaction takes place in a countercurrent reactor 12, which may be static, stirred, agitated, with oscillating or rotating discs, at a temperature between 50 to 1501°C preferably between about 70 and about 110°. Raffinate from the oxidation which contains residual catalyst, spent or residual oxidant, is recycled to the oxidant-catalyst storage tank 14, where make-up catalyst and oxidant are added.<br>
The concentration of the catalysts may be between about 0.001 and about 1.00, by weight % on oxidant, and preferably between about 0.01 and about 0.10 weight %. Oxidant concentrations may vary between about 1% and about 100%, by weight, but are typically between about 10% and about 50%, and in the case of hydrogen peroxide are preferably between<br>
about 15% and about 30%, by weight, in the aqueous phase. Oxidants vary by chemical type, oxidation potential, efficacy, stability, solubility and persons of ordinary skill in the art can establish readily the useful and effective concentrations of oxidant. Oxidants which can be used in the present process include hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypchlorite, sodium or potassium peroxydisulfate or peroxymonosulfate, t-butyl hydroperoxide, perchloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, performic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The second step of the process involves the removal of the oxidized compounds by contacting the distillate with a selective extraction solvent in column 16. As reported in the literature concerning the ODS process, the liquid-liquid extraction technique using water-soluble polar solvents, such as DMSO, DMF, methanol, and acetonitrile, is usually employed. DMSO and DMF have a high extractability for sUlfones but have a high boiling point, which is close to the boiling point of the sulfones, and thus they may not be reused for further extraction based on recovery by distillation. Methanol and acetonitrile are preferred for use as the extraction solvent, since they have relatively low boiling points and are separated easily from the sulfones and other oxidized sulfur species by distillation. When methanol and acetonitrile are contacted with light oil, a large quantity of aromatics is extracted simultaneously with the sulfones. The addition of water, however, suppresses the extractability of the aromatics. Examples of polar solvents include those with high values of the Hildebrand solubility parameter .delta.; liquids with a .delta, higher than about 22 have been successfully used to extract these compounds. Examples of polar liquids, with their Hildebrand values, are shown in the following:<br>
Table IT. Hildebrand Values of Various Useful Polar Solvents<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
However, as will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art, mere polarity considerations are insufficient to define successful extraction solvents. Methanol, for instance, has sufficient polarity, but its density, 0.79 g/cc, is about the same as that of a typical light oil, making separations very difficult. Other properties to consider include boiling point, freezing point, viscosity, and surface tension. Surprisingly, the combination of the properties exhibited by DMSO make it an excellent solvent for extracting oxidized sulfur and nitrogen compounds from liquid light oil, but unfortunately it contains a large proportion of sulfur. Heteroatom solvents containing nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur must be very volatile to ensure stripping of the solvent out of the diesel oil. The preferred solvents in this process are acetonitrile and methanol, due to their polarity, volatility, and low cost.<br>
In the second stage or step, the oxidized sulfur compounds are extracted in countercurrent extractor 16 of the Karr, Scheibel, or other configuration of countercurrent or stirred tank<br>
extractor to remove tne oxidized sulfur compounds from the diesei oil. The extraction phase is composed of an aqueous solution containing from about 10 to about 30% water in a polar organic solvent, including acetonitrile, methanol, or other solvent. Therefore, the solvents should be sufficiently polar to be selective for polar compounds in the process of extraction.<br>
In a third stage of the process a stripper column is employed to remove traces of the solvent from the diesel oil. The solvent is recovered and sent to the solvent recovery fractionator 20.<br>
In a fourth stage of the process, the extraction-rich solvent is recovered in a stripper recovery flash evaporator (not shown). Bottoms from the evaporator are purged to a sulfone storage tank to be sold as petrochemical intermediates, or added to fuel oil or crude oil.<br>
In a fifth stage of this process, the diesel oil is passed through an adsorbent polishing column which removes the last traces of sulfur to below 10 ppm w/w from the diesel oil. Many adsorbents can be used for this purpose, including activated carbon, silica gel, alumina and other inorganic adsorbents. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, a new adsorbent comprised of polar polymers coated onto inert, but high surface area supports, such as silica gel, alumina, and activated carbon are utilized. These polymers include, among other candidates, polysulfones, polyacrylonitrile, polystyrene, polyester terepthalate, polyurethane, and other polymers which demonstrate affinity for oxidized sulfur species. The advantage of using the polymer coated onto the support is that the adsorption and desorbtion processes are rapid and reversible, and the adsorbates are easily recovered, and the column is easily regenerated by extraction with a suitable solvent and dried.<br>

EXAMPLE 1. TETRAOCTYL-AMMONIUMPHOSPHOTUNGSTATE Carlo Venturello Catalyst {(C8H17)4N}3PW4O2-4 FW 2550.99)<br>
A.       Preparation of Venturello Catalyst: Sodium tungstate, Na2WO4.2H2O (3.30 g, 10 mmol) was weigned to a 250 ml beaker and 7 ml of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 was added and stirred at 25 °C until a colorless solution was obtained. To this solution, was added 1.0 ml 85 % phosphoric acid H3PO4 and the whole was diluted to 50 ml with water. To the resultant solution, 2.5 g of tetraoctylammonium chloride (Aldrich) in methylene chloride was added dropwise with stirring over about 2 min. Stirring was continued for an additional 15 mm. The<br>
organic phase was then separated, filtered, and evaporated at room temperature overnite to give 3.5 g of a colorless syrup.<br>
B.	Oxidation of Arabian Light Gas Oil: A 100-ml sample of full range (FR) hydrotreated<br>
(HT) Arabian Light Gas Oil (ALGO) containing 910 ppm w/v of total sulfur was heated to 85 °C<br>
with stirring on a stirring hot plate. A 50-ml portion of 15 % w/w hydrogen peroxide in water<br>
was added then 50 mg of catalyst described above in A. Preparation of Venturello Catalyst,<br>
tris(cetyltrimethylammonium) phophotungstate (Venturello Catalyst) was added. The reaction<br>
was continued for 15 minutes then the reactants were cooled and poured into a 250-ml separatory<br>
funnel. The aqueous peroxide lower phase was withdrawn and discarded. A sample of the oil<br>
phase was analyzed by gas chromatography with a Sievers Sulfur Chemiluminescence Detector<br>
(GC-SCD), and compared with a sample of the original FR HT ALGO. The chromatogram<br>
showed the presence of apparently the same amount of sulfur, but the sulfur peaks were<br>
displaced until later in the chromatogram, indicating the formation of sulfones. Sulfur analysis<br>
showed the oxidized sample to contain 880 ppm w/v sulfur, allowing for analytical error,<br>
indicating no removal of the sulfur.<br>
C.	Batch Extraction Of Oxidized Oil: The 100 ml sample of oil phase prepared in B above,<br>
Oxidation of Arabian Light Gas Oil, was extracted twice with 50 ml portions of acetonitrile<br>
containing 10 % v/v distilled water. After the second extraction, 98 ml of oil was recovered, and<br>
analyzed for total sulfur and was found to contain 60 ppm sulfur w/v. The oil sample was<br>
analyzed by GC-SCD and the original and oxidized sulfur peaks were practically all removed.<br>
The two extracts were combined and were evaporated overnight to a dry oil, and was then<br>
analyzed by GCMS and GC-SCD. The GC-SCD indicated the presence of the<br>
alkyibenzothiophene-dioxides and alkyldibenzothiophene-dioxides that were present originally in the oxidate oil. GCMS results indicated the presence of methyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, and tetramethyl benzothiophene sulfones and dibenzothiophene sulfones.<br>
D.	Countercurrent Extraction Of Oxidized Oil: A 100-ml sample of full range (FR)<br>
Hydrotreated (HI) Arabian Light Gas Oil (ALGO) containing 910 ppm w/v of total sulfur was<br>
oxidized as in B above, Oxidation of Arabian Light Gas Oil, but was not extracted. The 100 ml<br>
sample of oxidized oil containing approximately 900 ppm w/v sulfur as sulfones, was transferred<br>
to a 2.5 cm by 75 cm fritted countercurrent extraction apparatus containing 50 cm of glass beads<br>
of 3 mm diameter. A Hitachi L2000 laboratory pump was used to pump 150 ml of<br>
acetonitrile:water 90:10 v/v at 10 ml/min upward through the fritt and through the oxidized oil<br>
After countercurrent extraction with the mixed polar solvent, the oil was withdrawn from the<br>
extraction apparatus and analyzed by GC-SCD and for total sulfur. No sulfur peaks were<br>
detected in the extracted oil, and total sulfur analysis gave a value of 25 ppm w/v.<br>
