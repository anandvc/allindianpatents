2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
There         is       an	internal       combustion    engine      mounted<br>
on	a        vehicle,        which	is    installed  with    a        rotational    angle<br>
detecting      apparatus        for        detecting       a       rotational       angle     of      a<br>
1A<br><br>
rotating shaft for determining cylinders and identifying a rotational number of the engine. As such a rotational angle detecting apparatus, there is one shown by Fig. 23 through Fig. 25. In Fig. 23, numeral 102 designates an internal combustion engine, numeral 104 designates a crank shaft which is a rotating shaft, numeral 106 designates a crank timing pulley which is a rotational motion transmitting member and numeral 108 designates a rotational angle detecting apparatus. The internal combustion engine 102 is installed to attach a timing belt pulley 106 wrapped with a timing belt (not illustrated) which is an endless rotational motion transmitting member on one end side in the axial direction of the crank shaft 104 axially supported by a cylinder block 110 which is an engine constituting member.<br>
The rotational angle detecting apparatus 108 is installed with a sensing rotor 112 which is an identifier member for identifying a rotational angle to project from a side face of the timing belt pulley 106 attached to the crank shaft 104. As shown by Fig. 24 and Fig. 25, the sensing rotor 112 is installed with projected portions 116 constituting an identifier portion in correspondence with the rotational angle of the crank shaft 104 at a peripheral edge 114 to project to an outer side in a diameter direction.<br>
2<br><br>
The rotational angle detecting apparatus 108 is installed with a sensor 118 constituting detecting means for detecting the rotational angle of the crank shaft 104 by identifying the projected portions 116. The sensor 116 is installed to attach to the cylinder block 110 around the peripheral edge 114 of the sensing rotor 112 to direct to a center in the diameter direction and to dispose on the lower side of the crank shaft 104. The rotational angle detecting apparatus 108 detects the crank angle which is the rotational angle by identifying the projected portions 116 in correspondence with the rotational angle by the sensor 118.<br>
Further, as a rotational angle detecting apparatus, there is one shown by Fig. 26 and Fig. 27. The rotational<br><br>
angle detecting apparatus 208 shown by Fig. 26 and Fig. 27 is installed to attach a sensing rotor 212 at a shaft end of a cam shaft 204 which is a rotating shaft.  The sensing . rotor 212 is installed with projected portions 216 in correspondence with the rotational angle of the cam shaft<br><br>
204 to project from a peripheral edge 214.<br>
The rotational angle detecting apparatus 208 is installed to attach a sensor case 220 covering the sensing rotor 212 to a cylinder head (not illustrated) which is an engine constituting member. A sensor 218 for detecting the rotational angle of the cams shaft 204 by identifying the<br>
3<br><br>
projected portions 216, is attached to the sensor case 220 around the peripheral edge 214 of the sensing rotor 212 to direct to a center in a diameter direction and to dispose at a side of the cam shaft 204. The rotational angle detecting apparatus 208 detects a cam angle which is the rotational angle by identifying the projected portions 216 in correspondence with the rotational angle by the sensor 218.<br>
Further, as a rotational angle detecting apparatus, there is one shown by Fig. 28. A rotational angle detecting apparatus 308 shown by Fig. 28, is installed to attach a sensing rotor 312 at a side face of a timing belt pulley 306 which is a rotational motion transmitting member attached to a shaft end of a cam shaft 304 constituting a rotating shaft by attaching bolts 322 and to project projected portions 316 in correspondence with the rotational angle of the cam shaft 304 from a peripheral edge 314 of the sensing rotor 312 to outer sides in the diameter direction.<br>
The rotational angle detecting apparatus 308 is installed with a sensor 318 for detecting the rotational angle of the cam shaft 304 by identifying the projected portions 316. The sensor 318 is attached to a cylinder head, not illustrated, to direct to a center of the sensing rotor 312 in the diameter direction and to dispose<br>
	4<br><br>
at a side of the cam shaft 304. The rotational angle detecting apparatus 308 detects a cam angle which is the rotational angle by identifying the projected portions 316 in correspondence with the rotational angle by the sensor 318.<br>
As such a rotational angle detecting apparatus of an internal combustion engine, there is one in which a sensing rotor constituting an identifier member for identifying a rotational angle and a sensor are integrally integrated to a case to thereby constitute an integral member and the integral member is integrated to an internal combustion engine as disclosed in JP-A-8-14814 and JP-A--8-144799.<br>
Further, as a rotational angle detecting apparatus of an internal combustion engine, there is one in which a sensor constituting detecting means is attached to a cylinder head or a head cover to direct to a center in a diameter direction of a sensing rotor constituting an identifier member for identifying the rotational angle as disclosed in JP-A-8-121206, JP-A-8-312512 and JP-A-9-280084.<br>
Further, as a rotational angle detecting apparatus of an internal combustion engine, there is one in which an identifier member in correspondence with a rotational angle is installed on an inner side face of a rim portion<br>
5<br><br>
of a cam pulley attached to a cam shaft and a sensor constituting detecting means is attached to a head cover to direct to the inner side face of the rim portion installed with the identifier portion as disclosed in JP-A-5-180613.<br>
Further, as a rotational angle detecting apparatus of an internal combustion engine, there is one in which a sensing rotor constituting an identifier portion for identifying a rotational angle is press-fitted and fixed to a timing belt pulley as disclosed in JP-A-8-135478 and there is one in which a sensor constituting detecting means is installed to attach to a cam cap of a cam shaft to direct to projected portions in correspondence with a rotational angle of a rear face of a cam pulley as disclosed in JP-A-9-88626.<br>
However, according to each of the conventional rotational angle detecting apparatus shown by Fig. 22 through Fig. 28, the identifier member for identifying the rotational angle is installed on the side face of the rotational motion transmitting member attached to the rotating shaft and the detecting means is arranged around the peripheral edge of the identifier member to direct to the center in the diameter direction.<br>
Therefore, there is a drawback in the rotational motion transmitting member installed with the identifier<br>
6<br><br>
member in which the rotational motion transmitting member is large-sized which gives rise to an increase in weight and gives rise to an increase in the length of the rotating shaft in the axial direction and layout of the detecting means is restricted.<br>
Further, when the rotational motion transmitting member installed to. the rotating shaft is a sprocket, the identifier portion in correspondence with the rotational angle needs to install to separate from a teeth portion of the sprocket such that the teeth portion installed at a peripheral edge of the sprocket is not erroneously identified as the identifier portion in correspondence with the rotational angle which is installed at the peripheral edge  of the identifier member for identifying the rotational angle.<br>
Therefore, similar to the above-described, there is a drawback in which the rotational motion transmitting member installed with the identifier member gives rise to an increase in the length in the axial direction of the rotating shaft, becomes large-sized and gives rise to an increase in weight and layout of the detecting means is restricted.<br>
Further, when a separate identifier member for identifying the rotational angle is attached to a rotational  motion  transmitting  member  attached  to  a<br>
7<br><br>
rotating shaft, there poses a problem in which the positioning accuracy of the identifier member for identifying the rotational angle relative to the rotating shaft gets deteriorated owing to an error in the position of attachment of the rotational motion transmitting member relative to the rotating shaft as well as an error in the position of attachment of the identifier member relative to the rotational motion transmitting member.<br>
Accordingly, there is a drawback in the identifier portion in correspondence with the rotational angle installed to the identifier member in which a deviation is caused in a position of the rotational angle, erroneous detection of the rotational angle is caused in the detecting means and a   reliability of  control by   the   rotational angle is deteriorated.<br>

35<br><br>
16 and detects the rotational angle by identifying the identifier portions 58 by the sensor 60 installed on the side of the chain cover 50-<br>
As shown by Fig. 12, the sensor 60 generates a voltage which differs in accordance with the distance al to the identifying face 56 and the distance a2 to the bottom face 68 of the identifier portion 58 in the groove shape and forms the generated voltage in a rectangular wave in accordance with the threshold level by a built-in sensor circuit (not illustrated) as shown by Fig. 14.

The rotational angle detecting apparatus 52 according to the second embodiment is installed with the identifier portions 58 in correspondence with the rotational angle of the intake cam shaft 14 to be opposed to the chain cover 50 at the identifying face 56 of the sensing rotor 54 installed integrally with the intake side attaching portion 32 of the intake cam shaft 16 and installed with the sensor 60 for detecting the rotational angle by identifying the identifier portions 58 on the side of the chain cover 50.<br>
Accordingly, the rotational angle detecting apparatus<br>
36<br><br>
52 according to the second embodiment can achieve an effect similar to that of the first embodiment.<br>
The rotational angle detecting apparatus 52 according to the second embodiment is installed with the identifier portions 58 in correspondence with the rotational angle of the intake cam shaft 14 to be opposed to the chain cover 50 at the identifying face 56 of the sensing rotor 54 installed integrally with the intake side attaching portion 32 of the intake sprocket 28 and accordingly, when the intake sprocket 28 is attached to the intake cam shaft 16, it can be attached easily without interfering with an attaching jig (not illustrated) and the weight can be reduced.<br>
That is, when the intake sprocket 28 and the exhaust sprocket 30 are attached to the intake cam shaft 16 and the exhaust cam shaft 18, firstly, the intake cam shaft 16 and the exhaust cam shaft 18 are fixed by positioning them to the cylinder head 6 by the intake side through hole 24 and the exhaust side through hole 26 for positioning, successively, the intake sprocket 28 and the exhaust sprocket 30 are positioned to the intake cam shaft 16 and the exhaust cam shaft 18 by the intake side notch portion 40 and the exhaust side notch portion 42 for positioning and press-fitted to the intake side attaching boss portion 20 and exhaust side attaching boss portion 22 by the<br>
37<br><br>
intake sidle attaching hole  3 6 and the exhaust  side attaching hole 38.<br>

At this occasion, when the identifier portions 58 are projected from the identifying face 56 of the sensing rotor 54, an attaching jig interferes with the identifier portions 58 and the respective sprockets 28 and 30 cannot be rotated.<br>
According to the rotational angle detecting apparatus 52 of the second embodiment, the identifier portions 58 are installed to recess from the identifying face 56 of the sensing rotor 54 and accordingly, when the intake sprocket 28 is attached to the intake cam shaft 16, the attaching jig does not interfere with the identifier portions 58, the intake sprocket 28 can easily be attached and the weight can be reduced,<br>

Therefore, there is a case in which the sensor 60 erroneously recognizes the intake side notch portion 40 for positioning as the identifier portion 58 and detects it as a signal of the rotational angle as shown by Fig- 15. In this case, there is a drawback in which the reliability of control by rotational angle is deteriorated.<br>
As shown by Fig. 11, the rotational angle detecting apparatus 52 according to the second embodiment is installed with the identifier portions 58 in the peripheral direction on the outer side in the diameter direction of the identifying face 56 on the side opposed to the chain cover 50 of the sensing rotor 54 and installed with the intake side notch portion 40 installed in the intake side attaching hole 36 disposed at the identifying face 56 on the inner side of the identifier portion 58 in the diameter direction on trie diameter line L the same as that of one of the identifier portions 58 at the identifying face 56.<br>
