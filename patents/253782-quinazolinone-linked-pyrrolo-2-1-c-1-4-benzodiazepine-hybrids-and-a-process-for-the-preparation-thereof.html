				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to quinazolinone linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepine hybrids of general formula 5, useful as potential anti tumour agents and a process for the preparation thereof. Particularly it relates to a process for the preparation of 7-methoxy-8-[n-(6-chloro-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-1-quinazolinyl) alkyloxy]-(11aS)-1,2,3,11a-tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-5-one with aliphatic chain length variations for these compounds. The structural formula of these novel quinazolinone linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines is given below.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
formula 5 wherein, R is an alkyl group selected from H, Cl, F and<br>
and n=1 , 2 or 3.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INEVNTION<br>
Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine antitumour antibiotics are commonly known as anthramycin class of compounds. In the last few years, a growing interest has been shown in the development of new pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs). These antibiotics react covalently with DMA to form an N2-guanine adduct that lies within the minor groove of duplex DMA via an acid-labile aminal bond to the electrophilic imine at the N10-C11 position (Kunimoto, S.; Masuda, T.; Kanbayashi, N.; Hamada, M.; Naganawa, H.; Miyamoto, M.; Takeuchi, T.; Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot., 1980, 33, 665.; Kohn, K. W. and Speous, C. L. J. Mol. Biol., 1970, 51, 551.; Hurley, L. H.; Gairpla, C. and Zmijewski, M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 1977, 475, 521.; Kaplan, D. J. and Hurley, L. H. Biochemistry, 1981, 20, 7572). The molecules have a right-handed twist, which allows them to follow the curvature of the minor groove of B-form double-stranded DMA spanning three base pairs. A recent development has been the linking of two PBD units<br>
through their C-8 positions to give bisfunctional-alkylating agents capable of cross-linking DMA (Thurston, D. E.; Bose, D. S.; Thomson, A. S.; Howard, P. W.; Leoni, A.; Croker, S. J.; Jenkins, T. C.; Neidle, S. and Hurley, L. H. J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 8141).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Recently, PBD dimers have been developed that comprise of two C2-exo-methylene substituted DC-81 subunits tethered through their C-8 position via an inert propanedioxy linker (Gregson, S. J.; Howard, P. W.; Hartely, J. A.; Brooks, N. A.; Adams, L. J.; Jenkins, T. C.; Kelland, L. R. and Thurston, D. E. J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 737). Recently, a noncross-linking mixed imine-amide PBD dimers have been synthesized that have significant DMA binding ability and potent antitumour activity<br>
(Kamal, A.; Ramesh, G. Laxman, N.; Ramulu, P.; Srinivas, O.; Neelima, K.; Kondapi, A.<br>
K.; Srinu, V. B.; Nagarajaram, H. M. J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 4679).<br>
Naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines belong to a group of antitumour<br>
antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species. Recently, there is much impetus for the<br>
PBD systems as they can recognize and bind to specific sequence of DMA. Examples<br>
of naturally occurring PBDs include anthramycin, DC-81, tomaymycin, sibiromycin and<br>
neothramycin.<br>
However, the clinical efficacy for these antibiotics is hindered by several limitations, such as poor water solubility, cardiotoxicity, development of drug resistance and metabolic inactivation.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide novel quinazolinone linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepine hybrids, useful as antitumour agents.<br>
