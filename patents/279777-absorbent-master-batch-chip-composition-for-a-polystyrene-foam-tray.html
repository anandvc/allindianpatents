Field of the Invention<br>
 The present invention relates to an absorbent resin composition, and more specifically, to <br>
an absorbent master batch resin composition that is added to a polystyrene resin for preparing <br>
a polystyrene foam tray.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
 A polystyrene foam tray is widely in use as a tray for packaging a product. <br>
Specifically, the polystyrene foam tray is widely in use for packaging a fish, a fruit, and the <br>
like, as well as all sorts of meats, such as fresh meat, a chicken, and the like. In other words, <br>
all sorts or fish, or meat, such as pork, a beef, a chicken, and the like, are put in a tray, are <br>
packaged with a wrap, and then are put into circulation.<br>
 Meat or fish that is put in the polystyrene foam tray releases water, so that the released <br>
water will fill inside the packaged tray. Most of the released water mixes with a blood of <br>
meat or fish, so that the water mixed with a blood will fill in the tray. The water mixed with a <br>
blood that fills in the polystyrene foam tray is looked bad, and also is hygienically bad.<br>
 Nevertheless, the polystyrene foam tray does not have an absorbent property and a <br>
hygroscopic property in itself, so that the water mixed with a blood could not be removed. A <br>
way for packaging the content altogether with a specific component, such as an absorbent <br>
material or a hygroscopic material inside the tray was attempted, but the way had no effect.<br>
 Therefore, the inventors decided that if the polystyrene foam tray can absorb water or <br>
water mixed with a blood released from content, such as meat or fish, the above-mentioned <br>
problem would be resolved. So, the inventors developed a new master batch chip <br>
composition having an excellent absorbent property, which is added to the polystyrene resin.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
 The object of the present invention is to provide a new master batch chip composition <br>
that is added to a polystyrene resin for preparing a polystyrene foam tray having an excellent <br>
absorbent property.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the new <br>
master batch chip composition having an excellent absorbent property, which is added to the <br>
polystyrene resin.<br>
 Another object of the present invention is to provide a polystyrene foam tray having <br>
an excellent absorbent property by adding the master batch chip composition having an <br>
absorbent property to the polystyrene resin.<br>
 The above-mentioned objects and other objects can be achieved according to the <br>
present invention as described in the following.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
 An absorbent master batch chip composition for a polystyrene foam tray according to the <br>
present invention includes about 1-80 parts by weight of an organic anionic sulphonate <br>
represented by the following Chemical Formula I or the following Chemical Formula II, <br>
about 1-75 parts by weight of a calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and about 1-50 parts by weight <br>
of talc, with respect to 100 parts by weight of a polystyrene basic resin including a general <br>
purpose polystyrene (GPPS), a high impact polystyrene (HIPS), and the like:<br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br>
 <br>
wherein,<br>
R and R1 are C13-18 alkane residual group.<br>
 A representative organic anionic sulphonate is a secondary n-alkane sulphonate, and a <br>
surfactant, such as a linear alkyl sulphonate (LAS), a linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LABS), <br>
an alpha olefine sulfonate (AOS), a sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), and the like can be <br>
preferably used.<br>
The calcium carbonate has the role of a compatibilizer for the uniform absorption and<br>
<br>
<br>
mixing of the organic anionic sulphonate, and the talc has the role of a nucleating agent, <br>
which ensures that cells are small and uniformly distributed during foaming.<br>
 Master batch chips are produced by mixing the ingredients of the master batch chip <br>
composition in a super mixer such that the organic anionic sulphonate is uniformly distributed <br>
in the basic resin, extruding from an extruder and then cutting into pellets.<br>
 The absorbent master batch chip prepared by the present invention mixes to the polystyrene <br>
resin to prepare a sheet phase, and the prepared polystyrene sheet is vacuum-moulded to <br>
prepare the polystyrene foam tray as a final product.<br>
Hereinafter, the detailed description of the present invention will be descried in detail.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
 The present invention relates to an absorbent master batch resin composition that is <br>
added to a polystyrene resin for preparing an absorbent polystyrene foam tray.<br>
 The absorbent master batch chip composition according to the present invention is <br>
used for preparing the polystyrene foam tray that can absorb water by mixing the absorbent <br>
master batch chip composition with the polystyrene resin. In addition, the absorbent master <br>
batch chip composition according to the present invention is used for providing a hygienic <br>
stable packaging and a visually clean packaging by absorbing water or water mixed with a <br>
blood that is released when all sorts of fish as well as fresh meats are packaged into the <br>
polystyrene foam tray.<br>
 A main material of the absorbent polystyrene foam tray according to the present <br>
invention is a polystyrene resin, and mixes with the absorbent master batch chip composition <br>
according to the present invention to prepare as the sheet phase. And then the sheet phase is <br>
vacuum-moulded to prepare trays in various sizes and shapes. The main material is the <br>
polystyrene resin, but other resin, such as an ethyl vinyl alcohol (EVA), a polyethylene (PE), <br>
polystyrene, SBS (styrene-butadiene-styrene), and the like can be partially included in <br>
adequate amount.<br>
 A basic resin of the absorbent master batch chip composition according to the present <br>
invention is polystyrene. The resin used in the present invention is a general purpose <br>
polystyrene (GPPS), a high impact polystyrene (HIPS), or the mixed polystyrene thereof. The<br>
 <br>
<br>
mixture of the general-purpose polystyrene and the high impact polystyrene may be <br>
preferably used, and the ratio preferably is within about 50~70 to 50~30 with respect to <br>
weight rate.<br>
 The organic anionic sulphonate is added in the range of about 1~80 parts by weight <br>
with respect to 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene basic resin. The organic anionic <br>
sulphonate has the structure represented by the following Chemical Formula I or Chemical <br>
Formula II:<br>
 <br>
wherein,<br>
R and R1 are C13-18 alkane residual group.<br>
 A representative organic anionic sulphonate is a secondary n-alkane sulphonate, and a <br>
surfactant, such as a linear alkyl sulphonate (LAS, represented by the following Chemical <br>
Formula III), a linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LABS, represented by the following Chemical <br>
Formula IV), an alpha olefine sulfonate (AOS, represented by the following Chemical <br>
Formula V), a sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS, represented by the following Chemical Formula <br>
VI), and the like can be preferably used:<br>
[Chemical Formula III]<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
 The organic anionic sulphonate used in the present invention can use a carboxylate, such as <br>
a long chain fatty acid alkali salt (soap), N-acrylamino acid salt, an alkyl ether carbon acid <br>
salt, an acylated peptide, and the like; sulphonate, such as an alkyl sulphonate, alkyl benzene <br>
and alkyl amino acid salt, an alkylnaphthalene sulphonate, sulphosuccinate, and the like; <br>
sulfuric acid ester salt, such as a sulfated oil, an alkyl sulphate, an alky ether sulphate, an alkyl <br>
amyl ether sulphate, an alkyl amide sulphate, and the like; an anionic surfactant, such as an <br>
alkyl phosphate, an alkyl ether phosphate, an alkyl aryl ether phosphate, and the like, as an <br>
anionic surfactant.<br>
 About 1~75 parts by weight of the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and about 1~50 parts by <br>
weight of talc are mixed with 100 parts by weight of the polystyrene basic resin. The carbon<br>
 <br>
<br>
carbonate has the role of a compatibilising agent for the uniform absorption and mixing of the <br>
organic anionic sulphonate, and the talc has the role of a nucleating agent, which ensures that <br>
cells are small and uniformly distributed during foaming.<br>
 Master batch chips are produced by mixing the ingredients of the master batch chip <br>
composition in a super mixer such that the organic anionic sulphonate is uniformly distributed <br>
in the basic resin, extruding from an extruder and then cutting into pellets. When mixing in <br>
the super mixer, the organic anionic sulphonate is melted by a self-heat generated from the <br>
mixer, and then the melted organic anionic sulphonate is absorbed into the calcium carbonate <br>
and the talc to be uniformly distributed in the resin. The uniformly mixed mixture is extruded <br>
in the extruder, cooled, and then cut into pellets to prepare the master batch chip. The <br>
absorbent master batch chip prepared by the present invention is mixed with the polystyrene <br>
resin to prepare a sheet phase, and the prepared polystyrene sheet is vacuum-moulded to <br>
prepare the polystyrene foam tray as a final product. About 1-20 parts by weight of the <br>
absorbent master batch chip according to the present invention is added to 100 parts by weight <br>
of the polystyrene resin to mould the sheet phase. Preferably, about 5~10 parts by weight of <br>
the absorbent master batch chip according to the present invention is added to 100 parts by <br>
weight of the polystyrene resin. The moulded sheet phase is vacuum-moulded to prepare trays <br>
in various sizes and shapes.<br>
 The absorbent polystyrene foam tray prepared by the present invention can absorb about <br>
water of 2/1 coffee cup per a tray within 30 minutes. When water can be generally absorbed <br>
within 2 hours for packaging a fresh meat or fish, there is no problem visually or hygienically. <br>
Nevertheless, the absorbent rate of the absorbent polystyrene foam tray according to the <br>
present invention is better than the above-mentioned absorbent rate.<br>
 The present invention will be all specifically described by the following embodiments, <br>
which are just described for the purpose of illustration and are not limited to the scope of the <br>
present invention.<br>
