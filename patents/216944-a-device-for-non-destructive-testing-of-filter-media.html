				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a device for non-destructive testing of filter media with control of all design parameters in hand, said device can be employed for evaluating the performance of many filtering process like dialysis in kidney in human body for cleaning of blood, biological plant's growth and pollution control of dust for industries dealing with cement production and automobile filters. More particularly, the present invention provides a device for non-destructive testing of filter media especially for automobile units, with control of all designing parameters in hand.<br>
ABBREVIATIONS<br>
The following are the abbreviations used in the specification:<br>
GSM: Grams per Square Meter<br>
PSD:   Pore Size Distribution<br>
DPSD:Dust Particle Size Distribution<br>
DHC: Dust Holding Capacity<br>
NOF: Number of Fibers<br>
AFM: Automobile Filter Media<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present manufacturing of automobile filter media, designing of the filter media is done on the basis of data and results obtained through cumbersome methods of actual experiments performed in testing laboratories. This approach of designing of media is not only very laborious and time consuming but is also not cost effective. The whole exercise involves manpower, raw material, lab level machines and time, which become countable when a number of exercises have to be performed.<br>
One of the major concerns of nearly all industries is to optimize their process parameter to arrive at an optimal product. Like-wise in filter paper manufacturing industries, it requires a close care of many sensitive process and product parameters to produce a filter paper of desired quality. It is not feasible to play with altogether different process parameters at manufacturing level to produce a desired product, as it is time consuming and not a cost-effective approach.<br><br>
Presently filter paper manufacturing companies take care of many process parameters like GSM, paper thickness, flow of pulp, temperature, consistency of pulp, speed of paper machine and other chemical properties. During our study on filter paper and its choking mechanism, many more parameters were extracted out which affect the performance of a filter during running process, they are:<br>
1.	Fiber's formulation<br>
2.	Fiber's length, width and density<br>
3.	Fiber's orientation distribution, which is also an indication of paper machine at<br>
which it was manufactured.<br>
4.	Paper GSM<br>
5.	Paper Thickness<br>
PERCEPTION AND FACTS ABOUT THE EXISTING PRODUCT (AFM)<br>
PERCEPTION OF FILTER MEDIA<br>
All hydraulic systems have a common need for protection from harmful contaminants entering the system. If the fluid is unfiltered, the contaminants may enter into the hydraulic system and damage and premature sensitive components like pumps, valves and motors. The job of the media is to capture the contaminant particles and allow the fluid to flow through<br>
Media is a term used to describe any material that is used to filter particles out of a fluid flow stream. In order for fluid to go through, the media must have holes or channels to direct the fluid flow and allow it to pass. Therefore, Filter Media is a porous mat of fibers that captures particles by causing fluid to twist, turn and accelerate during passage.<br>
SOME FACTS ABOUT COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE FILTER MEDIA<br>
•       A filter media has two sides: [a] Scree Side<br>
[B] Felt Side<br><br>
The Scree side is marked with parallel lines and the distance between each line corresponds to the minimum height of the paper.<br>
•	Direction of flow is from Felt side to Scree side.<br>
•	Grooving is done to increase the area and trap dust particles in between them.<br>
Differential papers are provided with different groove depths.<br>
•	IMPREGNATION is done to increase the mechanical strength and to avoid fiber<br>
disintegration to the engine or other parts.<br>
•	Resin coating provides the resistance against washing away the fibers.<br>
•	CURING of resin is heating of filter media.<br>
•	GSM is the weight of the filter media per unit square meter of area.<br>
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXISTING SYSTEM<br>
The theoretically perfect filter media would remove 100% of all types of contaminants while offering infinite capacity and complete indestructibility. Recognizing the impossibility of this ideal, the designers of filter paper must strike the best possible balance between the capacity and efficiency needed to protect a filtered system. If the paper is too efficient, it will have a short life. If it is not efficient enough, the filtered system will not be adequately protected. The manufacturer of filter media, therefore, seeks a balance among the properties of strength, porosity and permeability, selecting the fiber, the weight and the thickness of paper that will meet performance requirements specified by the designer of each particular filtered system.<br>
The performance of filter media can be studied under different design parameters. It is very cumbersome job to study the effect of all design parameters individually or in combination of more than one design parameters, even at lab level, as it involves time, money and manpower. The subject of fiber selection and combination is much too complex as different fibers have different effect on porosity of media.<br><br>
Further, there doesn't exist a system or a method for the non-destructive testing of the filter media. Therefore, there is a need to provide a system or a method to effectively design a filter media and test the filter media for its performance.<br>
In the present invention, the applicants have developed a new device which provides a tool to study and design the media with all controlling parameters in hand.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device for non-destructive testing of a filter media with control of all design parameters in hand.<br>

STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for non-destructive testing of a filter media, said device comprising:<br>
(a)	a first input means (1) comprising of an optical microscope adapted to directly<br>
output fiber characteristics or an user interface, wherein the fiber characteristics<br>
are length, width, density and formulation of the fiber;<br>
(b)	a filter media designing means (2) such as herein described coupled to the first<br>
input means for receiving the fiber characteristics, constructing the filter media<br>
and obtaining filter media characteristics, wherein the filter media characteristics<br>
are mean pore size, maximum pore size and pore size distribution;<br>
(c)	a second input means (3) selected from the group comprising of flow rate sensors,<br>
viscosity sensors, dust particle size distribution sensors, dust addition rate sensors<br>
and  pressure  sensors  for obtaining  fluid  characteristics,  wherein the  fluid<br>
characteristics are flow rate, viscosity, dust particle size distribution, dust addition<br>
rate and terminating pressure drop of the fluid, and<br>
(d)	a processing means (4) coupled to the filter media designing means and the<br>
second input means for receiving the input data and superimposing pore size<br>
distribution of the fiber with the dust particle size distribution of the fluid as<br>
obtained from the filter media designing means to calculate the life, beta ratio and<br>
efficiency of the filter media, wherein the said processing means comprises of a<br>

probability that the dust particle may stick to a surface of a filter media, a third<br><br>
probability generating means for generating probability that the dust particle may get trapped in volume of the filter media and probability that the particles may cross surface and volume of the filter media and come to secondary side of the filter<br>
The testing of the filter media broadly consists of two parts:<br>
1.	Generation of filter media: The filter media is generated by distributing the fibers in<br>
2-d plane with time as 3" dimension. This part gives three performance indices of the<br>
media:<br>
[a]	Mean Pore Size<br>
[b]	Maximum Pore Size<br>
[c]	Pore Size Distribution (PSD)<br>
2.	Test Rig Operation: In this part, the PSD is superimposed with DPSD with time to<br>
evaluate the performance of the media. This part deduces the ultimate aim of the<br>
modeling in terms of Life i.e. DHC and efficiency of media. This device takes into<br>
account the basic parameters like flow of oil, DPSD, dust addition rate and area of<br>
filter that are obtained from corresponding fluid flow sensors.<br>
The present invention is further described in the following examples which are given by the way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: GENERATION OF FILTER MEDIA Fiber Statistics<br>
A filter media is a porous mat of fibers that capture particles and allow the fluid to flow through. The fibers are characterized by:<br>
1.	Length<br>
2.	Width<br>
3.	Density<br>
4.	Orientation of distribution in space and<br>
5.	Formulation of fibers<br><br>
However, for a known GSM of filter paper, there are different types of fibers in a pulp blend. Thus, formulation of fiber is the fifth and very important characterizing parameter of filter media. Hence,<br>
On image analysis of fibers for different grades of automobile filter media, fibers are found to be cylindrical in shape with their length and width of the order of microns (nm). From the modeling point of view, fibers are taken as parallel piped shape over these length scales, such that they occupy a certain fixed length and width in two dimensional plane area. As the fibers fall, they occupy two dimensional area which continuously results in decrease in that two dimensional area under consideration to form voids. The weight of a unit fiber may be determined as follows: Say, 'L', 'W and 'd' represent the length, width and density of a fiber, then Volume of a unit fiber =  r2 L; where r (radius of fiber) = W/2 and Weight of a unit fiber = r2 L d<br>
Say, there are 'n' types of fibers in a filter media with different formulations by weight, then number of fibers for a given formulation say Fn is given by: Fn = (Wt. of formulation) / (Wt. of a unit respective fiber) And the total number of fibers i.e. NOF, in a pulp blend is given by:<br>
n=l The total number of fibers so obtained is distributed at certain orientation in a 2-d plane<br>
sequentially with time as 3rd dimension to generate a filter media. The orientation distribution of fibers is explained in next section.<br>
Example 2:    Orientation Distribution of Fibers<br>
Orientation of fiber is defined as the angle the fiber makes with the X-axis. Orientation of fibers in a filter media plays a very important role in controlling the porosity of the media. The approach provides a tool for studying the effect of orientation of fibers on the performance of the filter media. On microscopic study of filter media under the sophisticated optical microscope, it is deduced that 10 to 15% of fibers lie at 20°, another 10-15% of fibers lie at 150°, and rest 70 to 80% of fibers fall at random orientation angle.<br><br>
This feature has been modeled by incorporating two Guassian Distributions of fiber's orientation with peaks atθ0=20° andθ 0=150° and standard deviation (a) of 20° in each case respectively. And the rest 70% of fibers are plotted at random angles from 0 to 180° angles.<br>
Example 3:    Fiber Mesh Formation<br>
Once all the required parameters as discussed in section 6.3.1 are known, the plotting of fibers is done with the help of computer. A random number generator is employed to generate initial positions (x1,y1) and their orientation angle 0. With initial co-ordinates and orientation angle 0, the end point co-ordinate of fiber can be obtained in the following way:<br>
X2 = X1 + L. Cos θ	Y2= Y1 + L. Sin θ<br>
It is necessary that the co-ordinates generated are uniformly random so that the fibers are uniformly distributed in the given area under consideration, with no biasing.<br>
The computer randomly generates straight fibers in 2-d area with a given length, width and orientation angle; and sequentially in time, so that they overlap. The time sequence is interpreted as the layered depth sequence, by specifying the total number of fibers and thickness of the filter media. The entire process results in an image of the filter media on computer screen. Two such images are shown in Figure-1, a SEM image of actual fiber mesh in a filter media and Figure-2, a simulated image using the computer.<br>
Example 4:    Pore Size and Distribution Determination<br>
A special algorithm named "Catch, Eat and Die" determines the pore sizes and their distribution of the filter media modeled on computer. In this algorithm, once the seed of a pore is caught, it is eaten i.e. counted with all its neighbors of same nature, giving area of that very pore and made dead i.e. placed aside so that they are not counted again. Once all sites of a pore are caught and eaten, the algorithm extracts another pore seed and same process is repeated till the whole paper is scanned. A pore size distribution array is initiated, in which pores with their respective sizes and frequency are stored.<br>
The statistical analysis of pore size distribution array gives the mean pore size, maximum pore size and pore size distribution for the filter media under consideration.<br><br>
The mean pore size and pore size distribution are the two main input parameters which participate in determining the life and efficiency of the filter media. These inputs with other test parameters are provided to the 2nd part i.e. Test Rig Operation of the model, which determines the life and efficiency of the filter media.<br>
Example 5:    TEST RIG OPERATION<br>
This part basically models the mechanism of filtration process. A block diagram is shown below that makes the clear vision of filtration process. The principle adopted in this model is based on the natural filling of pores with the dust particles. In mathematical modeling, a probability of trapping of dust particles into the pores has been made in accordance with particle's size and pore's size. This means that when a dust particle of diameter 'd' is exposed to filter site, it very firstly locates the biggest pore from where it can easily come out. Hence the probability of dust particle of diameter 'd' to be trapped in the biggest pore is maximum and go on decreasing as the size of pores decreases. The availability of pores is also a constituent of the probability of trapping.<br>
Example 6:    MODELLING<br>
The pore size distribution obtained from 1st part becomes input for the Test Rig Operation. This PSD is super imposed with the Dust Particle Size Distribution (DPSD) along with following test parameters:<br>
[a]	Flow Rate<br>
[b]	Area of Filter<br>
[c]	Initial Dust<br>
[d]	Dust Addition Rate<br>
[e]	Viscosity of Oil<br>
As the test rig loop starts, dust particles start reaching to filter site. The pores start getting filled with dust particles in accordance of their probability determined on the basis of particle's size and pore's size. This is basically a probability-based superimposition of dust particle size distribution on pore size distribution.<br>
Till, we have discussed the probability of dust particles depending upon the available no. of pores and their sizes. The probability of dust particles to be trapped either at the<br><br>
surface or in the volume of the filter also plays an important role in choking mechanism of a filter. Hence following three more types of trapping probabilities have been considered in this model:<br>
(i)       Probability of the particles that it may stick at surface of the filter.<br>
(ii)      Probability of the dust particle that it may cross the surface but trap in the<br>
volume of the filter (iii)     Probability of particles that may cross the filter surface and volume and comes<br>
in secondary side of the filter i.e. filtrate We will discuss all these three probability in details one by one below:<br>
Example 7:    Probability of the particles that it may stick at surface of the filter<br>
hi the present model, a sticking probability factor is employed to simulate the particles<br>
being captured by the surface of the filter. As the sticking of particles on surface increases, the pressure across the filter starts building up. Also more and more particles will come onto the surface of the filter, probability of particles trapping in the volume and coming in secondary side will increase. Probability of filling of pores with dust particles is employed in such a way that there is maximum variable probability of smallest particle to go into the biggest pore depending upon the availability of the pore.<br>
Example 8:     Probability of the dust particle that it may cross the surface but trap<br>
in the volume of the filter<br>
When a dust particle cross surface of filter, there are two probabilities for particles; it<br>
may either be trapped in the volume of filter or cross the volume and comes out in the secondary as a filtrate. As compared to surface, there is many fold space in the volume of the filter to accommodate the dust. But as the pores at surface are blocked by the bigger particles the space of the volume of filter remains unused. If somehow, this space is utilized to accommodate the dust, the life of filter will become many times as compared to existing.<br>
Example 9:    Probability of particles that may cross the filter surface and volume and comes in secondary side of the filter i.e. filtrate.<br>
The oil and contaminants mixture when passes through a filter has probability that<br>
particles may pass through the filter and accumulate on the other side i.e. secondary side of the filter. This process goes on with time and accumulated particles add wear and tear to the machine. On the test rig, the particles are being reversed to the input volume and<br><br>
after a long time span a steady state occurs, if no extra impurity is added with time. The ration of number of particles at primary side i.e. in the sump volume and number particle in secondary side after filtration gives the p ratio of ISO standard.<br>
Px = (Number Particles in Primary Side &gt; x / (Number of Particle in Secondary Side &gt; x); where x is the size of particle.<br>
Though the particle going in secondary side in the model, during real time operation goes to the atmosphere and into machine parts. At the primary side, some of the particles added from the atmosphere and a cycle are complete. Although, the cycle is not reversible, because source and sink for the contaminant is atmosphere. Hence, filter life and efficiency are variable at different atmospheric conditions and dust level in air.<br>
As the time passes, the availability of pores go on decreasing, thereby the pressure drop across the filter go on increasing, due to accumulation of dust particles at the surface of the filter. The pressure drop (AP) building-up across the filter is a function of flow rate (q), media thickness (th) and total number of pores (n) available of all sizes. It may be written as:<br>
AP = f(q,th,n) A graph is plotted by taking time on x-axis and pressure drop and dust accumulation on<br>
filter media on y-axis. Thus, by studying the graph, the life i.e. dust accumulated on filter media can be obtained at any desired value of pressure drop, which is dust holding capacity of filter media.<br>
The Beta ratio (px) and efficiency of filtration are given by:<br>
Px =(Number Particles in Primary Side&gt;x)/(Number of Particle in Secondary Side&gt;x) and<br>
(Efficiency)x = (l-(l/px))*100; where x is the size of dust particle.<br>
