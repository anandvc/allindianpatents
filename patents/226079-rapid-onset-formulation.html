RAPID ONSET FORMULATION<br><br><br>
DUCHESNAY, INC., of 2925 Boulevard Industriel, Chomedey, Laval [Quebec] H7L 3W9, Canada.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
-1-<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
RAPID ONSET FORMULATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
5<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a rapid onset formulation, preferably in form of an enterically coated tablet, for a medicament comprising a synergistic duo of active ingredients namely, doxylamine succinate and <br>
10 	pyridoxine HCI, hereinafter referred to as "DS-P". DS-P is useful in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, especially, but not limited to, during pregnancy, hereinafter referred to as "NVP". Thus the present invention is concerned with all known and future therapeutic indications of DS-P.<br>
15      THE PRIOR ART<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of DS-P are known. The current formulation, commercially available in Canada under the name Diclectin (Duchesnay Inc.) comprises the following active ingredients: pyridoxine HCI and Doxylamine succinate. It additionally comprises the following excipients: <br>
20 	lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium trisilicate, silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate.<br>
Diclectin is the world's most studied drug in regard to its safety during pregnancy. Because of its excellent safety profile, Diclectin is the drug of <br>
25 	choice for the treatment of NVP. The current formulation is sugar coated and suffers from drawbacks, one of which being its delayed onset of action. However, the current formulation once ingested, can take more than 4 hours before the two active ingredients (pyridoxine HCI and doxylamine succinate) reach nearly full dissolution in the small intestines, where it is<br><br>
-2-<br>
absorbed.   This delay is often considered too long for patients, such as women suffering from NVP, who require urgent relief of symptoms.<br>
Another drawback of the current formulation is related to patient <br>
5	compliance. Women suffering from NVP often complain of hyper olfaction, which means that various odors and tastes can trigger nausea or vomiting problems. The smell and taste of sugar on the current sugar coated formulation as well as the use of organic solvents and phthalates in the preparation of the currently used enteric coating, bothers many pregnant <br>
10 	    women to the point where the intake of the drug is essentially inhibited.<br>
The size of the currently available tablet is also problematic. A smaller size tablet would improve patient compliance since women suffering from NVP often have problems swallowing. Furthermore, a smaller tablet looks less <br>
15	 harmful than a bigger one and patients will have the impression that they are taking a lesser amount of drug. This will in turn significantly increase patient compliance.<br>
Finally, the current formulation contains lactose.  This is objectionable for 20     those patients suffering from lactose intolerance.<br>
Thus, it is desirable to provide patients suffering from nausea and vomiting an improved rapid onset formulation overcoming the drawbacks of the prior art. <br>
25<br>
However, since DS-P is orally delivered as an enteric coated tablet, the novel oral formulation must transit through the stomach unscathed and rapidly release both active ingredients once the dosage form reaches its intended destination, namely the intestines.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The main challenge surmounted by the present invention was to arrive at a dosage form capable of overcoming the drawbacks of the prior art while simultaneously delivering the synergistic duo of active ingredients for rapid <br>
5 	onset. It was also important to provide a formulation exhibiting similar dissolution curves for both active ingredients so as to avoid the dissolution of one active ingredient to the detriment of the other. This was important in view of the synergistic therapeutic effect of the duo of active ingredients.<br>
10     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general terms, the invention provides a new aqueous enteric-coated formulation comprising DS-P, the formulation exhibiting a dissolution profile indicative of a rapid onset.<br>
15 The invention also seeks to provide a pharmaceutical composition having specific in-vitro dissolution profiles indicative of rapid onset of the active ingredients. The pharmaceutical composition being suitable for simple and reproducible manufacture.<br>
20 Further scope of applicability will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. It should be understood however, that this detailed description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, is given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become<br>
25     apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts two examples of dissolution profiles in accordance to the<br>
rapid  onset formulation  of the  present invention  in  comparison  to  a<br><br>
-4-<br>
dissolution profile of the prior art formulation. The first dissolution profile (example 1) corresponds to a rapid onset formulation from which nearly 100% of both active ingredients is released within .45 minutes. The second dissolution profile (example 2) corresponds to a rapid onset formulation <br>
5	from which approximately 95% of both active ingredients is released within 120 minutes. The last and comparative dissolution profile (prior art) corresponds to the currently available formulation from which approximately 100% of the pyridoxine HCI and approximately 90% of the doxylamine succinate is released within 240 minutes. <br>

Figure 2 is a schematic flowchart of the preferred manufacturing process of a preferred formulation in accordance with the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
15   	  Other objects and attendant features of the present invention will become readily appreciated, as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment described for the purpose of illustration.<br>
20     In  a  broad  sense,  the  invention  provides  a  rapid  onset formulation comprising pyridoxine HCI and doxylamine succinate.<br>
The formulation of the present invention may be used in the human and . veterinary fields of medicine whenever symptoms of nausea and/or <br>
25 	vomiting require medical intervention. Since the formulation of the present invention is intended for medicinal purposes, then the formulation and its components should be pharmaceutically acceptable. The preferred formulation is in the form of an oral dosage form such as a tablet, pill or encapsulated beads or solution. The most preferred formulation is a tablet.<br><br>
-5-<br>
The tablet of the present invention is preferably capable of transiting through the stomach unscathed.   To test this feature, the tablet of the present invention was tested to resist disintegration in simulated gastric fluid "SGF" for a minimum period of 1 hour. <br>
5<br>
    In accordance with the present invention, the formulation will satisfy the<br>
    following dissolution profiles when measured in 1000 ml phosphate buffer<br>
    at pH 6.8 and 37°C in a type 2 dissolution apparatus at 100 rpm; preferably<br>
     measured by high performance liquid chromatography:<br>
10	(a) at least about 40% of the total amounts of each of pyridoxine HCI<br>
and  doxylamine  succinate  are  dissolved  after  30  minutes  of<br>
measurement;<br>
(b)	at least about 70% of the total amounts of each of pyridoxine HCI<br>
and  doxylamine  succinate  are  dissolved  after  60  minutes   of<br>
15	measurement;<br>
(c)	at least about 80% of the total amounts of each of pyridoxine HCI<br>
and doxylamine succinate are dissolved after 90 minutes of<br>
measurement;<br>
(d)	at least about 90% of the total amounts of each of pyridoxine HCI<br>
20	and doxylamine succinate are dissolved  after  120  minutes  of<br>
measurement;<br>
In the present invention, any reference to dissolution profile should be construed as referring to the results of a dissolution test in which the <br>
25	 amount of pyridoxine HCI and of doxylamine succinate released is measured in 1000 ml phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 and 37°C using a USP (United States Pharmacopoeia) type 2 dissolution apparatus at 100 rpm; preferably measured by high performance liquid chromatography.<br><br>

Example of method of manufacture<br>
. The   formulation   of  the   present   invention   was   prepared   using   the<br>
ingredients shown in Table 1, above.   Doxylamine succinate and silicon<br>
dioxide NF are pre-blended in a 2 cu. Ft. V-Blender.   The resulting pre-<br>
5     blend is then milled through a Quadro Co Mill, Model 196S, equipped with<br>
a 40 mesh screen.<br>
Pyridoxine HCI is also milled through a Quadro Co Mill, Model 196S, equipped with a 40 mesh screen.    The milled pyridoxine HCI is then <br>
10  	   combined with the doxylamine / silicon dioxide NF pre-blend and the combined mixture blended.<br>
Microcrystalline Cellulose is milled through a 40 mesh screen and split into two approximately equal portions.   One portion is subsequently combined<br>
15 in a 650L Gallay Bin with the previously formed pre-blend containing both the active ingredients, followed by the addition of the second portion. The loaded material is then blended followed by the addition of magnesium trisilicate and sodium croscarmellose. The newly formed mixture is blended.   The addition of magnesium stearate followed by an additional<br>
20     blending completes the preparation of the core formulation.<br>
The final blend is compressed in tablet form and is subsequently seal coated, enteric coated using a suitable commercially available aqueous enteric coating and top coated for aesthetics.   The overall manufacturing <br>
25   	  process is depicted in Figure 2.<br>
All coating steps using the ingredients of Table 2, namely, the seal coat on the core, the enteric coating and the opadry white (color coat)  are<br><br>
-13-<br>
advantageously performed in a Vector Hi (trade-mark) coater pan equipped with a peristaltic pump.<br>
Example 2<br>

It follows from these results that the prior art formulation, exhibits a noticeably slower dissolution pattern when compared with the novel <br>
5	 formulations. Indeed, after 90 minutes averages of only 60% doxylamine and 67% pyridoxine HCI are dissolved. A slower in-vivo dissolution profile is indicative of a delayed onset of action. The novel formulations, as depicted by examples 1 and 2, show markedly faster onset dissolution<br><br>
-19-<br>
profiles resulting in a rapid onset of action. The new formulations overcome most, if not all of the drawbacks associated with the prior art.<br>
