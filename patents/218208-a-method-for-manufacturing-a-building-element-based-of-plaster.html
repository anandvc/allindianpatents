				<td>a mold in the shape of the element 10 be manufactured, packing the mixture- into me mold and then opposing any volume increase in the mold as the piaster sets. The volume expansion of the plaster that occurs as it hydrates and crystallizes is thus uunosed, resulting in  of the crystalline matrix of the plaster rn me manufactured element. Such molded, elements are used-hi <br>
.building when umnolded and have mechanical and physical properties that are equivalent to : building stone. The can be assembled without Joints because of the  dimensional accuracy One disadvantage of that known msthod is trial the opposed expansion of the plaster in the mold results hi a - substantial increase in the pressure in the mold. Since the element is Innmolded by displacing one of the plates of the mold between the side -walls of the mold, which  are fixed with respect to each other, "the force that has to be applied to the mold plate for i unmoldrng has to be greater than the friction resulting from the pressure of the element on the <br>
side walls of the mold and is very high. Thus, to carry out said known method, very powerful <br>
Psses have to be used and they are very heavy and expensive. It ma}7 even become impossible <br>
I to remove the elements from the molds without destroying them.  Further, smce at least the major portion of the plaster sets in the mold, each mold is v immobilized tor a relatively long psnod prior to imrnolding, which considerably decreases the : maniiiaetxiring rate and means that a large number of molds has to he used: fus is expensive. <br>
US patent 1,703,097 discloses a method for making artificial marble wherein a mixture of plaster and water is compressed into a mold at a pressure of about 100-500 bars. However, the quantity of water in the mold is equal to the amount corresponding to the transformation of plaster into gypsum, i.e. the amount required for the plaster hydration (see col. 1, lines 44-46) and the duration of the compression is not disclosed.<br>
US patent 3,809,566 discloses also a method for making a building product from plaster, the method consisting in placing a mixture of plaster and water in a mold and in compressing the mixture into the mold, the mixture containing a quantity of water which approximately corresponds to the amount required for the plaster hydration or which is lower than this amount (see the examples 1 to 23 wherein the quantity of water is comprised between 16 and 20 cc. for 100 grams of plaster). The duration of the compression is not disclosed.<br>
It has been found by the inventor that when a pressure lower than about 150 bars (at 20°C) is applied to a mixture of plaster and water in the mold and when the mixture does not contain approximately twice the amount of water required for the plaster hydration, it is not possible to inhibit the crystallization of plaster, so that this crystallization is made under pressure in the mold and it is very difficult to withdraw the element from the mold.<br>
The present invention permits to avoid this drawback, because the combination of the claimed pressure and of the claimed quantity of water permits to inhibit the crystallization of the plaster.<br>
It should also be noted that the crystallization of the plaster begins immediately when plaster is in contact with water and that no means, except the present invention, is known in the art for inhibiting this crystallization.<br>
When a mixture of plaster and water contains only the quantity of water necessary for the plaster hydration, it is not possible to inhibit the plaster crystallization even if the pressure applied to the mixture is equal to or larger than the above mentioned threshold of about 150 bars at 20°C.<br>
It is only when the mixture of plaster and water contains approximately twice the quantity of water necessary for the plaster hydration, that the application of a pressure equal to about 150 bars (at 20°C) to the mixture can inhibit the plaster hydration.<br>
Because substantially no crystallization of plaster is produced in the mold, there is substantially no plaster expansion in the mold and the molded element can be unmolded easily.<br>
It results from the above that the invention recited in new claim 1 is neither disclosed nor suggested by the cited prior documents and patentably differentiates therefrom.<br>
The aim of the invention is to provide a method that can overcome the disadvantages of the known technique.<br>
This reduces the quantity of water required in the mixture to a minimum value while keeping the mixture sufficiently fluid to be homogeneously compressed into the mold.   The advantage of reducing the quantity of water in the mixture is to reduce the final porosity of the manufactured element.<br>
In accordance with a further feature of the invention, the method consists of initially compressing said mixture into the mold to reduce voids in the mixture to a minimum value or close to a minimum, then increasing the pressure applied to the mixture to at least said threshold value.<br>
To increase said pressure, the invention advantageously envisages driving at least one element having a reduced cross section compared with the corresponding cross section of the cavity of the molding in the mold into the mixture. The pressure in the mold can then be increased while exerting a relatively low force on the end of the element.<br>
Preferably, a plurality of said elements are used, which may, for example, be cylindrical rods guided in translation and sealingly mounted in orifices in one or more walls of the mold and to which axial thrust is applied.<br>
Clearly, it is possible to use any other appropriate means known to the skilled person to increase the pressure inside the mold to a value above said threshold value by means of which the solubility of the plaster in water is increased, examples of said means being pressure multipliers, systems of levers, articulated systems, etc, of the type used in hydraulic presses.<br>
The invention will be better understood and other characteristics, details and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description made with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
•	Figure 1 is a diagrammatic cross section of a device for manufacturing a building<br>
element in accordance with the invention;<br>
•	Figure 2 is a diagrammatic axial cross section of the device of Figure 1;<br>
•	Figure 3 is an organigram of the principal steps in the method of the invention.<br>
for manufacturing a building element in accordance with the invention, said mold being in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped and comprising four rigid, non-deformable side walls 12 permanently fixed together and an upper plate 14 and a lower plate 16 which are movably mounted with respect to the side walls 12.<br>
The lower plate 16 rests on the table of a hydraulic press, while the upper plate 14 is associated with the movable plate of the press to be able to exert a compressive force on the mixture placed inside the mold 10.<br>
Optionally, and as shown diagrammatically, the lower plate 16 may carry a projecting part 20 with a semi-oval shape, for example, intended to form a cavity in the element to be manufactured.<br>
The mixture to be introduced into the mold 10 comprises plaster and a minimum quantity of water, substantially corresponding to twice the quantity of water required for the plaster hydration and crystallization reaction at atmospheric pressure.<br>
hi known manner, the plaster is a calcium sulfate semihydrate obtained by heating gypsum, which is a calcium sulfate dihydrate. Plaster that is currently commercially available comprises a certain number of additives, in particular set retarding agents. However, in the method of the invention, pure plaster can also be used, i.e., without an additive, or plaster of mediocre quality, containing non-calcined elements which form setting accelerators.<br>
The mixture introduced into mold 10 also preferably comprises a granular filler such as sand, for example, or any other type of filler that is inert or chemically compatible with the plaster, as indicated above. The quantity of filler in the mixture can vary fairly widely, as can the granulometry of the filler. As an example, the mixture introduced into the mold may comprise about 30% to 50% by weight of plaster and about 70% to 50% by weight of filler. The quantity of water in said mixture depends on the temperature and on<br>
by weight of plaster in the majority of cases. Clearly, said values are given solely by way of example, to provide an idea, and can vary fairly widely as a function of the temperature and compression of the mixture in the mold. In a preferred implementation of the invention, the mixture contains 37 parts by weight of water per 100 parts by weight of plaster and is compressed to a pressure of 150 bars when the temperature is 20°C to 25°C.<br>
When manufacturing a building element in accordance with the invention, the following procedure is followed:<br>
The upper plate 14 of the mold is withdrawn, and a mixture of plaster, filler and water in the proportions indicated above is poured into the mold mounted on the press. Preferably, the plaster and filler are dry mixed and the plaster hydration water is added at the last minute, for example when introducing the mixture into mold 10 or just prior thereto.<br>
The next step consists of packing the mixture in the mold to eliminate as far as possible the air contained in the mixture and any excess water, which can escape via the clearance of a few hundredths to a few tenths of millimeters between the side walls 12 and the plates 14 and 16 of the mold. The packed mixture in the mold is compressed, for example by lowering the upper plate 14 of the mold to a predetermined depth substantially corresponding to the desired depth of the building element to be manufactured. Said depth is advantageous defined by abutment of the plate 14 on the side walls 12 of the mold.<br>
The pressure applied to the mixture of plaster, filler and water in the mold is then increased to a threshold value beyond which the plaster is dissolved in the water. This limiting value depends on the temperature and also on the plaster used and is, for example, about 100 bars at 15°C, about 150 bars at 20-25°C, and 170-180 bars at 40°C.<br>
said threshold value, as application of a much higher pressure (for example twice the threshold value) only slightly affects the final result.<br>
The consequence of said compression of the mixture in the mold and of an increase in the solubility of the plaster is that the plaster set is blocked and no plaster crystallization takes place in the mixture.    This phenomenon can be explained as follows: plaster crystallization only occurs after the plaster dissolves in the water and the solution formed by the plaster and water is saturated to allow a calcium sulfate dihydrate germination-growth process to be initiated.    Compression of the mixture in the mold above said threshold value has the effect of increasing the solubility of the plaster in the water and thus does not allow saturation of the solution, which would initiate said germination-growth process.   Said compression is exerted for a time, for example about 10 to 15 seconds, sufficient for air and excess water in the mixture to be evacuated from the mold. On reducing or ending said compression, a state is reverted to in which the solubility of the plaster in water is lower, the solution then becomes saturated and brisk germination-growth is initiated with rapid crystallization of the plaster in the mixture in the form of small compact crystals that are substantially smaller than the crystals obtained during crystallization at atmospheric pressure.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this pressure reduction is advantageously accomplished by unmolding the building element. Unmolding is carried out when the plaster has not yet set and is rendered possible as the high compression of the mixture in the mold produces a solid element. Unmolding is easy to accomplish, for example by lifting the upper plate and removing the side walls 12 of the mold, by vertical translation. The plaster in the unmolded element crystallizes rapidly at a rate which is typically a few minutes and is two to three times faster than the crystallization rate of plaster at atmospheric pressure in a mixture of stoichiometric proportions.<br>
are comparable with or superior to those of dressed stone used in building,  hi particular,<br>
•}<br>
the compressive strength of an element of the invention is over 300 kg/cm".<br>
Said elements can be used for building a few minutes after unmolding. Their dimensional accuracy means that they can be put together by stacking them on top of each other without joints and without external coatings, as described in the prior art cited above.<br>
To reduce the porosity of said elements and improve their behavior towards water and gel, the mixture introduced into the mold contains a minimum quantity of water and a small quantity of a fluidifier, for example a deflocculant. Advantageously, said defiocculating agent is melamine in a quantity of less than 0.5% by weight with respect to the plaster.<br>
The presence of said fluidifier can reduce to a minimum the quantity of water in the mixture while retaining sufficient fluidity of the mixture to allow it to be compressed into the mold substantially homogeneously and isostatically.<br>
The means used to carry out the method of the invention can include a conventional hydraulic press with sufficient power to compress the mixture into the mold at a pressure of at least 150 bars.<br>
It is also possible to use less powerful means that can, for example, compress the mixture into the mold at a pressure of the order of 80 bars, by combining them with other means such as those shown in Figures 1 and 2, which- enable the pressure in the mold to be increased to a value of about 140 to 150 bars using a relatively low hydraulic power.<br>
The means shown in Figures 1 and 2 include cylindrical rods 22 which are sealingly mounted in translation in orifices in the lower plate 16 of the mold and which are associated with thrust means to allow them to be introduced at least in part into the mixture compressed in the mold.<br>
The rods 22 are retracted and do not project into the interior of the mold; the desired quantity of said mixture is injected into the mold, packed and compressed to about 80 bars using the upper plate 14 of the mold. A thrust is then exerted on the lower ends of rods 22 to drive them at least partially into the mixture compressed in the mold.<br>
Embedding the rods 22 into the mixture can increase the pressure on said mixture to a value of about 150 bars using a much lower thrust than if said internal pressure were obtained by displacing the upper plate 14 of the mold.<br>
Driving the rods 22 into the mixture also compensates for small errors in dosing the mixture which can occur in practice. As an example, if the quantity of mixture introduced into the mold is slightly lower than the theoretical value, rods 22 will be driven further into the mixture to produce an internal pressure of about 150 bars. Conversely, if the quantity of mixture introduced into the mold is slightly higher than the theoretical value, the internal pressure of 150 bars in the mold will be reached by driving the rods 22 to a lesser extent.<br>
Clearly, said rods can be mounted in orifices of the upper plate 14 of the mold and/or the short side walls 12 of the mold.<br>
To facilitate unmolding, an opening mold can be used, i.e., a mold in which the side walls 12 are not rigidly fixed together and can be spaced apart from each other. In this case, the following procedure can be used:<br>
The side walls of the mold are brought together at the sides of the element to be manufactured and are fixed in position. The procedure indicated above is then carried out by introducing the mixture into the mold, packing it and compressing it to about 150 bars. To unmold it, the upper plate 14 of the mold is withdrawn and the walls 12 are spaced away from each other laterally. The means for displacing walls 12 and for fixing said walls in position may be mechanical or hydraulic.<br>
in the organigram of Figure 3.<br>
This organigram shows a step 26 for dry mixing plaster and filler, a step 28 for introducing the mixture of plaster, filler and water into the mold 10, a step 30 for packing the mixture into the mold, a step 32 for compressing the mixture into the mold at a pressure of the order of 150 bars, for example, a step 34 for unmolding the element obtained and a final step 36 in which the plaster is allowed to crystallize in the open air.<br>
Step 30 lasts 10 to 15 seconds and step 32 lasts 20 to 30 seconds, for example, the progressive increase of the pressure between steps 30 and 32 allowing the constituents of the mixture to settle properly. The pressure is kept at the limiting value, in this instance 150 bars, for about 10 to 15 seconds, then is removed for unmolding; step 34 lasts about 15 seconds. The total duration of the compression and unmolding steps is about 60 seconds, giving the manufacturing rate per press and per mold (about 60 elements per hour).<br>
The elements produced can be used for building a few minutes after being unmolded and are erected by being placed one on top of the other without joints because of their high dimensional accuracy. They become a coherent mass in a few minutes by pouring liquid plaster between the elements in known manner.<br>
The building elements of the invention can have a shape and dimensions corresponding to that of conventional cement blocks. They can also have different shapes and dimensions depending on their destination. In particular, beams, lintels, slabs, panels, etc, can be formed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
