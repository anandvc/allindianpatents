ticularly, to a broadcast/multicast service based on user location information.<br>
Background Art<br>
A broadcast/multicast service, which provides sky wave broadcast or various sup-<br>
plementary information to mobile terminals, is a new type of service including both a<br>
broadcast service that usable information is provided by a service provider to all the<br>
clients who have subscribed for its service and a multicast service that information is<br>
provided only to a certain group of clients who have previously subscribed for a<br>
specific subject or contents.<br>
Since the broadcast/multicast service can simultaneously provide the same in-<br>
formation to multiple clients, network resources can be effectively managed, and in<br>
line with this, symbols for providing a high bandwidth application through the<br>
effective management of the network resources is increasing, hi addition, clients'<br>
demands for a high level of services can be satisfied by providing diverse high speed<br>
services.<br>
Clients can select only a favored service among various offered information to<br>
receive it, and in this respect, a method for selectively receiving information based on<br>
location information of a client has not been defined.<br>
In addition, a related art broadcast/multicast service does not define a method for<br>
allowing a server to classify multimedia type information or various contents based on<br>
a location service of a user and provide it.<br>
Namely, me related art broadcast/multicast service has a problem that the same in- .<br>
formation is simultaneously provided to multiple clients and the clients are to receive<br>
the information unconditionally regardless of their location.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
A broadcast/multicast service method based on user location information in<br>
accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference to the ac-<br>
companying drawings.<br>
The present invention proposes interface and operation between a terminal<br>
providing user's favored contents or information and one or more servers based on user<br>
location information. In particular, the present invention proposes a broadcast/<br>
multicast service by which a server filters various contents or information based on<br>
user location information and provides it to users in a pertinent service area. In this<br>
case, the server can provide the service to every user in the pertinent area, provide the<br>
corresponding service to a terminal which requests the service in the corresponding<br>
area, or provide the corresponding service to an area requested by the user.<br><br>
In the present invention, when a user requests a broadcast/multicast service<br>
provided in a particular area, a broadcast/multicast server checks location information<br>
of the user and provides contents or information of the pertinent area. In this case, the<br>
broadcast/multicast server checks the user location information through a location<br>
server or checks user location information transmitted from the terminal.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram showing the construction of a broadcast/multicast<br>
system in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the broadcast/multicast system includes a contents provider<br>
10, a broadcast/multicast server 30 which checks area information from contents and<br>
information received from, the contents provider 10 and provides the contents and in-<br>
formation to a corresponding area through a broadcast/multicast service, a terminal 50<br>
which receives the contents and information from the broadcast/multicast server 30<br>
and transmits information inputted by a user, and a location server 20 which checks<br>
location information of the terminal 50. In this case, the contents provider 10 can si-<br>
multaneously provide one or more contents to one or more terminals by using the<br>
broadcast/multicast service.<br>
The terminal 50 includes a broadcast/multicast client receiving or requesting the<br>
broadcast/multicast service, and a location client receiving or requesting location in-<br>
formation of a corresponding terminal. In this case, the broadcast/multicast client and<br>
the location client are sort of modules installed in the terminal.<br>
A network for actually transmitting the contents and information between the<br>
terminal and the broadcast/multicast server includes an MBMS (Multimedia<br>
Broadcast/Multicast Service) of a 3GPP, a BCMCS (Broadcast Multicast ServiceO of a<br>
3GPP2, or a DVB (Digital Video Broadcast). The network is comprehensively called<br>
BDS (Broadcast Distribution System).<br>
The MBMS and BCMCS have both uplink channel and downlink channel, so in-<br>
terfacing between the broadcast/multicast server and the terminal in the same network<br>
can be possible. However, in case of the DVB, it has only the downlink channel, so if<br>
the terminal wants to perform communication with the broadcast/multicast server, it<br>
must be connected with a mobile communication network such as an EV-DO<br>
(Evolution Data Only) or a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) in order<br><br>
to use the uplink channel.<br>
The system constructed as described above operates as follows.<br>
The broadcast/multicast server receives contents from the contents provider and<br>
stores it. When the broadcast/multicast server receives current location information of<br>
a terminal from the location server or from a terminal which requests corresponding<br>
contents, it transmits contents to be provided to the pertinent area, among the stored<br>
contents, to the terminal of a user.<br><br>
The broadcast/multicast server receives certain contents from the contents provider,<br>
classifies and stores it in a corresponding service area, receives current location in-<br>
formation of a terminal from the location server or from the terminal requesting<br>
corresponding contents, and transmits contents provided in the corresponding area to<br>
the terminal of the user.<br>
Although the broadcast/multicast server does not receive a service request from the<br>
terminal, it can provide contents and information corresponding to a current location of<br>
the terminal, and can transmit contents provided to a specific area requested by the<br>
user to the corresponding terminal regardless of the current location information of the<br>
service-requested terminal.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 are signal flow charts showing a broadcast/multicast service method<br>
based on user location information, in which the broadcast/multicast service can be im-<br>
plemented through a terminal of which a broadcast/multicast client and a location<br>
client can be connected to the same network. In this case, the network is the MBMS of<br>
the 3GPP or the BCMCS of the 3GPP2.<br>
Figure 2 is a signal flow chart of a broadcast/multicast service method in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, in which the broadcast/<br>
multicast server, which intends to transmit contents or information related to location<br>
information, directly receives location information of a corresponding terminal from<br>
the location server.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the broadcast/multicast service system includes a contents<br>
provider 10, a location server 20, a broadcast/multicast server 20, a terminal 50 and an<br>
end user 60 that checks contents and information outputted to the terminal 50 and<br>
inputs certain information. The contents and information are transferred, to the terminal<br>
50 through a BDS 40. The terminal 50 includes a BDS receiver 51, a broadcast/<br>
multicast and location client 53. In this case, because the broadcast/multicast client and<br>
the location client of the terminal 50 are connected to the same network, the two clients<br>
are assumed as one entity, namely, the broadcast/location client 53.<br>
The broadcast/multicast server 30 receives one or more contents from the contents<br>
provider 10 (step S11). The contents include information on area to which cor-<br>
responding contents are scheduled to be transmitted, namely, information on an area to<br>
which the corresponding contents can be provided.<br>
Upon receiving the contents, the broadcast/multicast server 30 generates a service<br>
guide by using a service time, place (location) and a related schedule of each contents,<br>
and transmits each service guide to terminals 50 of an every area where the broadcast/<br>
multicast service is provided. In this case, the broadcast/multicast server' 30 can store<br>
the contents received from the contents provider in two ways. The first one is receiving<br>
and storing the contents, and the second one is checking area information included in<br><br>
the contents and storing the corresponding contents according to each service area as<br>
classified. The service guide includes an entire contents list which can be provided by<br>
the broadcast/multicast server or a contents list that a user has previously requested or<br>
discriminately selected based on preference information registered when the user<br>
subscribes for the service.<br>
In the case that each program or contents of the service guide includes area in-<br>
formation, condition information with respect to a factor for discriminating a specific<br>
area, contents based on location, and service features providing each contents must be<br>
included in a corresponding service guide entry.<br>
For example, the factor for discrirninating a specific area includes a name of an<br>
area, a detailed address, a postal code number, accurate location coordinates, or the<br>
like, the contents include classification information as to whether corresponding<br>
contents are an advertisement or weather information or the like, the service features<br>
include information whether corresponding contents are used for only one time or pe-<br>
riodically used or whether it is provided when a terminal enters or moves out of a<br>
specific area. Information included in the service guide entry is to be described in<br>
detail.<br>
When the terminal 50 receives the service guide through the BDS receiver 51, it<br>
displays the service guide through the broadcast/location client 53 so that the user 60<br>
can check the service guide (step S13).<br>
The user 60 checks several programs and contents from the displayed service guide<br>
and selects a service guide entry corresponding to contents desired to be received at a<br>
specific position or at its location among the contents (step S14). Then, a broadcast/<br>
multicast request message is transmitted to the broadcast/multicast server 30 through<br>
the broadcast/location client 53. In this case, the broadcast/multicast request message<br>
includes information of contents selected by the user and service features as to whether<br>
the contents is used for one time or periodically provided, or information whether the<br>
contents are provided when a terminal enters or moves out of a specific area, and an ID<br>
of the terminal. The contents information can include information on an area where the<br>
corresponding contents are provided.<br>
When the broadcast/multicast server 30 receives the broadcast/multicast request<br>
message from the broadcast/location client 53, it transmits a location tracking request<br>
message to the location server 20 (step S16).<br>
Upon receiving the location tracking request message, the location server 20 checks<br>
whether the location information of the corresponding terminal can be disclosed<br>
(which, for example, means that a specific terminal is set whether to allow for a third<br>
party to perform location tracking on the specific terminal itself, which is also called a<br>
'privacy check') (step S17), and if user's permission is required for the location<br><br>
tracking, the location server 20 transmits a notification message with respect to<br>
permission of location tracking to the user 60, and the user transmits a response<br>
message to the notification message (step S18).<br>
Location tracking of the terminal is performed between the location server 20 and<br>
the location client 53 (step S19). The location tracking can be performed by using an<br>
existing location tracking method defined in the 3GPP or 3GPP2 or by using a SUPL<br>
(Secure User Plane Location).<br>
The location server 20 transmits a calculated location tracking value through a<br>
response message to the location tracking request message to the broadcast/multicast<br>
server 30 (step S20), and the broadcast/multicast server 30 transmits only contents cor-<br>
responding to the current location tracking value among contents which have been<br>
selected by the user through the BDS 40 to the terminal 50 (step S21). in this case, the<br>
contents include the location tracking value of the corresponding terminal.<br>
In the process of transmitting the contents by the broadcast/multicast server 30, in<br>
case that the contents received from the contents provider 10 are classified and stored<br>
according to each service area, contents of the corresponding service area are<br>
transmitted to the terminal 50, whereas if the received contents are stored as it is,<br>
contents that can be provided to me corresponding service area, among the stored<br>
contents, is transmitted to the terminal 50.<br>
The contents are transferred to the broadcast/location client 53 through the BDS<br>
receiver 51 (step S21), and. the broadcast/location client 53 outputs the corresponding<br>
contents for user's checking (step S22).<br>
Figure 4 illustrates items included in a service guide entry in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
The items shown in Figure 4 are optionally added to indicate corresponding area in-<br>
formation when contents list including area information is transmitted.<br>
Of the items, 'broadcase_area' indicates including of area information for<br>
broadcasting/multicasting contents and includes 'target_area' or 'hor_acc' as sub-items.<br>
'target_area' is an item for a part to which contents are provided and includes sub-<br>
items of 'shape', 'cc', 'name_area' or 'zip_code'. 'hor_area' indicates a broadcast region<br>
with certain accuracy on a plane, which is, for example, used for setting a certain area<br>
on an electronic map.<br>
'shape' is used to indicate a geographical form, 'cc' is a country code expressed by<br>
1~3 digits, 'name_area' indicates a regional name, and 'zip_code' is an area code give to<br>
each area, corresponding to a postal code number.<br>
The broadcast/multicast server 30 can divide a contents service area by using the<br>
. items. For example, when a specific is to be provided to a specific city, the broadcast/<br>
multicast server 30 optionally includes the items 'broadcast_area', 'target_area' and<br><br>
name_area = specific city' on a list of the corresponding contents.<br>
The optional items are not only used for indicating a service available area of the<br>
contents list in the service guide but also for limiting an area to which each contents<br>
list is transmitted or an area to which contents are transmitted.<br>
The location tracking request message that the broadcast/multicast server 30<br>
transmits to the location server 20 and the response message with respect to the<br>
location tracking request message that the location server transmits to the broadcast<br>
multicast server 30 can be expressed in the XML (extensible Markup Language) by<br>
using each factor and attribute defined in an MLP (Mobile Location Protocol) spec-<br>
ification.<br>
Figures 5 to 7 and 8 to 14 illustrate a location tracking request message and a cor-<br>
responding response message expressed in an XML (extensible Markup Language). In<br>
detail, Figures 5 to 7 illustrate embodiments of messages used for tracking a location<br>
only one time, and Figures 8 to 14 illustrate embodiments of messages used for<br>
tracking a location periodically or tracking a location when a specific event occurs.<br>
Specifically, Figure 5 shows a general one-time location tracking request message<br>
corresponding to a location tracking request message, which includes an ID of a<br>
terminal which requests location tracking, location tracking accuracy having time<br>
delay and spatial accuracy, a type of a location tracking value, and setting of a priority<br>
level.<br>
Figure 6 shows an ACBI message with respect to the general one-thr.e location<br>
tracking request, which can include a result value such as whether location tracking is<br>
successful.<br>
Figure 7 shows a response message with respect to the general one-time location<br>
tracking request, which includes only a location tracking value.<br>
Figure 8 shows a periodical location tracking request message, and Figure 9 shows<br>
a location tracking message in case where a specific even occurs, namely, for example,<br>
when a terminal enters or moves out of a specific area.<br>
The location tracking message includes an ID of a terminal which requests location<br>
tracking, discrimination as to whether it is periodical location tracking or location<br>
tracking with respect to occurrence of a specific event, and a period for requesting<br>
location tracking, its start time and termination time in case of the periodical location<br>
tracking, and characters of an event (e.g., whether a terminal enters, moves out of or<br>
located within a specific area) and a name or an accurate location value of a specific<br>
area in case of tracking a location with respect to occurrence of a specific event. The<br>
location tracking message includes location tracking accuracy having time delay and<br>
spatial accuracy, a type of a location tracking value, and setting of a priority level.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show ACK messages with respect to the periodical location<br><br>
tracking request or the location tracking request in occurrence of a specific event,<br>
namely, showing embodiment of a case where a response can be made to a location<br>
tracking request and a case where a response cannot be made to a location tracking<br>
request.<br>
Figure 12 shows a location tracking value transmitted as a response message with<br>
respect to a periodical location tracking request or a location tracking request when a<br>
specific event occurs.<br>
Figure 13 shows a cancellation message with respect to the periodical location<br>
tracking request or the location tracking request in case where a specific event occurs,<br>
and Figure 14 shows an ACK message with respect to a minimum message.<br>
Namely, the broadcast/multicast server 30 transmits the one-time location tracking<br>
request message, the periodical location tracking request message or the location<br>
tracking request message in occurrence of a specific event to the location server 20<br>
according to characteristics of contents selected by a user.<br>
In order for the broadcast/multicast server 30 to transmit only the contents cor-<br>
responding to the location tracking value, a process for matching information on each<br>
contents received from the contents provider 10 and information of the terminal is<br>
required.<br>
Figure 15 shows a search table of a database of the broadcast server 30, which<br>
includes items of a service area, a list of contents provided to' each service area, an ID<br>
of a terminal subscribed for a service, a user input value.<br>
For example, a terminal with an ID of A1 is set to receive contents of an ad-<br>
vertisement, weather, stock information but not contents of fashion. Then, when a<br>
location tracking value of the terminal corresponding to the area 'A', the broadcast/<br>
multicast server transmits the contents of the advertisement, weather and security in-<br>
formation and does not transmit the contents of fashion. In this case, by adding such an<br>
item of area information as shown in Figure 4 as an option to the contents transmitted<br>
to the area 'A', the service area can be restricted.<br>
Figure 3 is a signal flow chart of a broadcast/multicast service method in<br>
accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, in which the<br>
broadcast/multicast server which transmits contents related to area information<br>
receives location information of a corresponding terminal from the terminal (user).<br>
The broadcast/multicast server 30 receives one or more contents from the contents<br>
provider 10 (step S31), generates a service guide by using a service time, a service<br>
position and a schedule of (he contents, and then transmits the service guide to<br>
terminals 50 of every area where the broadcast/multicast service is provided through<br>
the BDS 40 (step S32). In this case, the broadcast/multicast server 30 can check area<br>
information included in the contents, classify corresponding contents according to each<br><br>
service area and store it, orstore the corresponding contents without classification. The<br>
service guide includes an entire contents list that can be provided by the broadcast/<br>
multicast server 30 or includes a contents list selected based on preference information<br>
that the user has been previously requested or registered when having subscribed for<br>
the service.<br>
Upon receiving the service guide through the BDS receiver 51, the terminal 50<br>
displays the service guide through the broadcast/location client 53 to allow the user 60<br>
to check the service guide (step S33).<br>
When the user 60 selects contents desired to be received at a specific location or at<br>
his/her current location among the contents of the displayed service guide (step S34), a<br>
broadcast/multicast request message is transmitted to the broadcast/multicast server 30<br>
through the broadcast/location client 53 (step S35). In this case, the broadcast/multicast<br>
request message includes information on an area to which the contents selected by the<br>
user is provided.<br>
The broadcast/location client 53 transmits also a location tracking request message<br>
to the location server 20 as well as the broadcast/multicast request message (step S36).<br>
In this case, the location tracking request message is transmitted as a format of a one-<br>
time location tracking request message, a periodical location tracking request message<br>
or a location tracking request message in case where a specific event occurs.<br>
Upon receiving the location tracking request message, the location server 20<br>
calculates a location tracking value by using an existing location tracking method or an<br>
SUPL (step S37), includes the location tracking value in a response message with<br>
respect to the location tracking request, and then transmits it to the broadcast/location<br>
client 53 of the corresponding terminal (step S38).<br>
Upon receiving the response message, the broadcasflocation client 53 transfers the<br>
location tracking value to the broadcast/multicast server 30 (step S39), and the<br>
broadcast/multicast server 30 transmits only contents corresponding to the location<br>
tracking value among the contents selected by the user to the terminal 50 through the<br>
BDS 40 (step S40). In this case, the contents include the location tracking value of the<br>
corresponding terminal. Herein, in case that the broadcast/multicast server 30 classifies<br>
the contents which have been received from the contents provider 10 according to each<br>
area and stores it, it transmits the contents of the corresponding service area to the<br>
terminal 50, whereas if broadcast/multicast server 30 stores the contents without clas-<br>
sification of the service area, it transmits the contents of the corresponding service area<br>
among the stored contents to the terminal 50.<br>
The contents transferred, to the broadcast/location client 53 through the BDS<br>
receiver 51 are outputted for user's checking (step S41).<br>
Figure 16 is a signal flow chart of a broadcast/multicast service method in<br><br>
accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention, and Figure 17 is a signal flow chart of a broadcast/multicast service method in accordance with a fourth<br>
embodiment of the present invention, showing implementation of a broadcast/multicast<br>
service through a terminal whose broadcast/multicast client and location client cannot<br>
be connected with the same network. In this case, the broadcast/multicast service is<br>
received through the DVB. while a location information request is transmitted through<br>
the 3GPP or the 3GPP2. Because the DVB has only the downlink channel without an<br>
interaction channel, the location information is transmitted through the uplink channel<br>
of a network defined in the 3GPP and the 3GPP2.<br>
As shown in Figures 16 and 17, a terminal 150, which receives a broadcast/<br>
multicast service through a DVB network 140, includes a DVB receiver 151, a<br>
broadcast/multicast client 153, a mobile client 155 for transmitting a location tracking<br>
request message to a broadcast/multicast server 130 or to a location server 120, and a<br>
user 160. Namely, the broadcast/multicast client 153 operates as a reception dedicated<br>
client and the mobile client 155 operates as a transmission dedicated client for<br>
transmitting specific information except for transmitting current location information<br>
of a corresponding terminal to the broadcast/multicast server 130.<br>
The broadcast/multicast service method in case where the broadcast'multicast<br>
server 130 which is to transmit contents related to area information directly receives<br>
location information of a corresponding terminal 150 from the location server 120 will<br>
now be described with reference to Figure 16.<br>
When the broadcast/multicast server 130 receives one or more contents from the<br>
contents provider 110 (step S51), it generates a service guide by using a service time, a<br>
service position and a schedule of the contents, and then transmits the service guide to<br>
terminals 150 of every area where the broadcast/multicast service is provided through<br>
the BDS 40 (step S52). In this case, the broadcast/multicast server 130 can check area<br>
information included in the contents, classify corresponding contents according to each<br>
service area and store it, or store the corresponding contents without classification. The<br>
service guide includes an entire contents list that can be provided by the broadcast/<br>
multicast server 130 or includes a contents list selected based on preference in-<br>
formation that the user has been previously requested or registered when having<br>
subscribed for the service.<br>
The service guide which has been received through the BDS receiver 51 is<br>
displayed through the broadcast/multicast client 153 for user's checking (step S53).<br>
When the user 160 selects contents desired to be received at his/her current location<br>
or at a specific location among the contents of the displayed service guide (step S54),<br>
the mobile client 155 transmits a broadcast/multicast request message to the broadcast/<br>
multicast server 130 (step S35). In this case, the broadcast/multicast request message<br><br>
can include information on an area to which the contents selected by the user is<br>
provided.<br>
Upon receiving the broadcast/multicast request message, the broadcast/multicast<br>
server 130 transmits a location tracking request message to the location server 120<br>
(step S56), and the location server 120 checks whether the location information of the<br>
corresponding terminal 150 can be disclosed (step S57). If user's permission is required<br>
with respect to the location tracking, the location server 120 transmits a notification<br>
message with respect to permission of the location tracking to the user 160 and then<br>
receives a response message (step S58). In this case, the location tracking request<br>
message is transmitted as a format of a one-time location tracking request message, a<br>
periodical location tracking request message or a location tracking request message in<br>
case where a specific event occurs.<br>
The location server 120 calculates a location tracking value by using an existing<br>
location tracking method or an SUPL (step S59), and transmits the location tracking<br>
value through a response message with respect to the location tracking request to the<br>
broadcast/multicast server 130 (step S60).<br>
The broadcast/multicast server 130 transmits only contents corresponding to the<br>
location tracking value among the contents selected by the user to the terminal 150<br>
through the DVB 140 (step S61), and the broadcastfmulticast client 153 receives and<br>
outputs the contents (step S62).<br>
Herein, in case that the broadcast/multicast server 130 classifies the contents which<br>
have been received from the contents provider 110 according to each area and stores it,<br>
it transmits the contents of the corresponding service area to the termin;al 150, whereas<br>
if broadcast/multicast server 130 stores the contents without classification of the<br>
service area, it transmits the contents of the corresponding service area among the<br>
stored contents to the terminal 150.<br>
The broadcast/multicast service method in case where the broadcast/multicast<br>
server which transmits contents related to area information directly receives location<br>
information of a corresponding terminal 150 from the terminal will now be described<br>
with reference to Figure 17.<br>
When the broadcast/multicast server 130 receives one or more contents from the<br>
contents provider 110 (step S71), it generates a service guide by using a service time, a<br>
service position and a schedule of the contents, and then transmits the service guide to<br>
terminals 150 of every area where the broadcast/multicast service is provided through<br>
the BDS 40 (step S72). In this case, the broadcast/multicast server 130 can check area<br>
information included in the contents, classify corresponding contents according to each<br>
service area and store them, or store the corresponding contents without classification.<br>
The service guide includes an entire contents list that can be provided by the broadcast/<br><br>
multicast server 130 or includes a contents list selected based on preference in-<br>
formation that the user has been previously requested or registered when having<br>
subscribed for the service.<br>
The service guide is received by the broadcast/multicast client 153 through a DVB<br>
receiver 151 of the terminal 150, and the broadcast/multicast client 153 displays it to<br>
allow a user 160 to check it (step S73).<br>
When the user 160 selects a service guide entry of contents desired to be received at<br>
his/her current location or at a specific location (step S74), the mobile client 155 tr<br>
ansmits a broadcast/multicast request message to the broadcast/multicast server 130<br>
(step S75) and a location tracking request message to the location server 120 (step<br>
S76). In this case, the broadcast/multicast request message and me location tracking<br>
request message are transmitted to the broadcast/multicast server 130 and to the<br>
location server 120 through the uplink of the 3GPP or 3GPP2, not through the DVB<br>
network 140.<br>
Upon receiving the location tracking message, the location server 120 calculates a<br>
location tracking value by using an existing location tracking method o:r an SUPL (step<br>
S77), includes the location tracking value in a response message with respect to the<br>
location tracking request, and then transmits it to the mobile client 155 of the cor-<br>
responding terminal 150 (step S78).<br>
Upon receiving the response message, the mobile client 155 transfers the location<br>
tracking value to the broadcast/multicast server 130 (step S79), and the broadcast/<br>
multicast server 130 transmits only contents corresponding to the location tracking<br>
value among the contents that can be provided to the corresponding terminal, to the<br>
terminal 150 through the DVB network 140 (step S80). In this case, the contents<br>
include the location tracking value of the corresponding terminal. Herein, in case that<br>
the broadcast/multicast server 130 classifies the contents which have been received<br>
from the contents provider 110 according to each area and stores it, it transmits the<br>
contents of the corresponding service area to the terminal 150, whereas if broadcast/<br>
multicast server 30 stores the contents without classification of me service area, it<br>
transmits the contents of the corresponding service area among the stored contents to<br>
the terminal 150.<br>
Upon receiving the contents through the DVB receiver 151, the broadcast/multicast<br>
client 153 outputs the contents (step S81).<br>
In this embodiment, when the broadcast/multicast server receives a response for<br>
specific contents from the terminal, it provides the corresponding contents to the<br>
terminal. In this respect, however, although the broadcast/multicast server does not<br>
receive a request for contents from the terminal, it can check a location of the terminal<br>
through the location server to selectively provide contents according to a current<br><br>
location of the terminal, or can provide contents requested by the user regardless of the<br>
current location of the tenninal.<br>
For example, when the broadcast/multicast server 30 receives contents from the<br>
contents provider 10, it can check the terminal positioned in a specific area through the<br>
location server 20 and transmit contents that can be provided to the coi.Tesponding area<br>
to terminals 50 within the area.<br>
In addition, when the broadcast/multicast server 30 receives contents from the<br>
contents provider 10, it can classify/store the contents according to a service area by<br>
using area information of the contents, and then, when a terminal requests contents of a<br>
specific area, the broadcast/multicast server 30 transmits contents of the corresponding<br>
area to the terminal 50.<br>
As so far described, the broadcast/multicast service method based on user location<br>
information in accordance with the present invention has many advantages.<br>
That is, for example, because only pre-set information or contents is/are selectively<br>
provided based on user location information, a waste of a communication channel can<br>
be prevented.<br>
In addition, since the user selectively receives contents or information according to<br>
his/her current location, user's satisfaction and convenience with respect to a service<br>
can be enhanced.<br>
The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied<br>
to other types of apparatuses: The description of the present invention is intended to be<br>
illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications,<br>
and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. In the claims, means-<br>
