				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the<br>
purification of marigold oleoresin and a purified marigold<br>
oleoresin obtained according to the method.<br>
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
The recent scientific researchers have reported that<br>
lutein, a kind of carotenoid, is associated with risk reduction<br>
for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) caused by oxidative<br>
damage to macular area of retina (for instance, cf. non-patent<br>
literature 1), and that lutein is effective for prevention of<br>
arteriosclerosis, prevention of cataract or suppression of<br>
carcinogenesis and etc. (for instance, cf. non-patent<br>
literatures 2, 3 and 4} . As such lutein is useful as a health<br>
food, a dietary supplement, a food color, a pharmaceutical color<br>
and a medicinal drug, and the use of lutein has been expected.<br>
Lutein is contained in fruits such as oranges, peaches ,<br>
papayas, prunes and mangos in the form of lutein-fatty<br>
acid ester and is also present in many flowers and vegetables,<br>
particularly in petals of marigold flowers remarkably.<br>
Marigold oleoresin is obtained in the manner that dried and ground<br>
marigold flowers are extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent such<br>
as hexane, petroleum ether and etc. or with a chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbon solvent such as dichloromethane and etc. , then the<br>
solvent is removed from the extract. The feature of most of<br>
commercially available marigold oleoresin is a solid or a paste<br>
having a high viscosity at room temperature, and the content<br>
of lutein-fatty acid ester in oleoresin is usually 14 to 20%<br>
as ester (for instance, cf. patent literature 1).<br>
In order to use lutein as a health food and a dietary<br>
supplement, soft capsules which encapsulate the said marigold<br>
oleoresin with gelatin film are prepared. Particularly when the<br>
content is oily, it is said that soft capsules are the best of<br>
all in terms of easy handling due to the encapsulation of a liquid,<br>
protection and stabilization of the contents, homogeneity of<br>
the contents, masking of taste and odor, and their highly<br>
value-added impression (cf. non-patent literature 5, etc.).<br>
Soft capsules are usually produced by die-cutting method in which<br>
a fixed amount of contents infused between 2 sheets of gelatin<br>
is punched out. To produce soft capsules of the said marigold<br>
oleoresin, it is necessary to liquidize the said marigold<br>
oleoresin by heating and fusing in order, because the content<br>
must be a liquid having a viscosity capable of being injected<br>
by a metering pump, not more than 20,000cps, for instance,<br>
according to a rotary die method (cf. non-patent literature 5,<br>
etc.) .<br>
However, there is no warming and heating process at<br>
a temperature of not less than 40°C in the production of soft<br>
capsules, since gelatin, a raw material of soft capsule, loses<br>
its formability at a temperature of not less than 40°C (cf.<br>
non-patent literature 5, etc.). Thus, it is difficult to heat,<br>
fuse, and fill in the said marigold oleoresin.<br>
For this reason a method of liquidizing the saidmarigold<br>
oleoresin at room temperature by diluting and dissolving with<br>
the addition of an edible vegetable oil is taken. This method,<br>
however, has a disadvantage that the number of capsules taken<br>
per one time or one day increases because of the decrease in<br>
a lutein content per one capsule.<br>
In addition to the above, a product forming a slurry<br>
at room temperature and containing not less than 15% of total<br>
carotenoids which is produced by suspending lutein-fatty acid<br>
ester extracted from marigold flowers with an edible vegetable<br>
oil is commercially available. However, this product has a<br>
disadvantage, in addition to the low content of lutein-fatty<br>
acid ester, that it entirely becomes solid and is impossible<br>
to be filled in soft capsules when it is heated and fused at<br>
about 80°C for sterilization and then cooled to a room<br>
temperature.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Marigold oleoresin used in the present invention is<br>
obtained by drying flowers of marigold which is a member of the<br>
Compositae family (Tagetes erecta WILLD.), grinding the dried<br>
product, optionally converting into pellets, extracting with<br>
an organic solvent, usually hexane, and removing the solvent<br>
from the extract. The feature is a solid or a paste at room<br>
temperature and has a specific odor. It contains lutein-fatty<br>
acid ester as the main component, usually together with fatty<br>
acid esters of zeaxanthin and cryptoxanthin. Hence, the<br>
lutein-fatty acid ester in the present invention indicates total<br>
carotenoid esters containing the all of them mentioned above.<br>
In the method of the present invention, marigold<br>
oleoresin is subjected to supercritical fluid extraction using<br>
high-pressure carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide becomes a<br>
supercritical state at above the critical point (Temperature:<br>
31.3°C, Pressure: 72.9 atm) and manifests a good solubility.<br>
Furthermore, a selective extraction can be carried out with such<br>
supercritical fluid by adjusting the pressure of a supercritical<br>
fluid supplied to an extraction vessel since the dissolving power<br>
of the supercritical fluid can be adjusted by changing pressure<br>
or temperature. The extraction vessel used for a step of<br>
supercritical extraction in the present invention may be the<br>
one which is well known per se in the present field. For instance,<br>
an extraction vessel shown in Fig. 2 in page 6 of the official<br>
gazette of Japanese Patent Publication S63-112659 can be used.<br>
To be more precise, marigold oleoresin is placed in<br>
an extraction vessel as it is or with an edible oil and fat.<br>
As for the edible oil and fat used herein, a vegetable oil and<br>
fat such as rape-seed oil, corn oil, soybean oil, cotton-seed<br>
oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, palm oil, coconut palm oil,<br>
etc. ; an animal oil and fat such as a fish oil, etc. ; or middle<br>
chain saturated fatty acid triglyceride, etc., are listed as<br>
examples. Addition of an edible oil and fat makes the viscosity<br>
of an extracted substance low and suppresses foaming, as a result<br>
the extraction procedure becomes easy. As for a diluent to adjust<br>
the viscosity of an extracted substance, other than the<br>
above-mentioned edible oils and fats, for instance, ethanol,<br>
hexane, acetone, glycerin, propylene glycol, etc. are used. The<br>
additional amount of these diluents may be about 10 to 100 parts<br>
by weight, preferably about 15 to 50 parts by weight, based on<br>
100 parts by weight of marigold oleoresin.<br>
Ethane, ethylene, propane, toluene, dinitrogen<br>
monoxide, etc. can be used as a supercritical fluid supplied<br>
to an extraction vessel, although carbon dioxide is popular.<br>
The components extracted by carbon dioxide in the supercritical<br>
state are recovered by evaporating carbon dioxide while<br>
decreasing the pressure in a separator vessel and is removed.<br>
In the processing method of supercritical extraction,<br>
though it is not necessarily limited, separation of carbon<br>
dioxide from a solvent is carried out preferably on the condition<br>
of (490 to 588) x 104 Pa(=N/m2) and at the temperature of 40 to<br>
60°C after carrying out supercritical extraction under<br>
the critical condition of (980 to 2940) x 104 Pa(=N/m2),<br>
preferably (1470 to 2450) x 104 Pa(=N/m2) at critical temperature<br>
to80°C, preferably at 40°C to 60°C. Extracted components include<br>
a residual organic solvent, free fatty acids and a residue<br>
comprising accompanying substances which can be identified only<br>
to a certain extent, other than odor components. The edible<br>
oil and fat added as a diluent is almost completely extracted<br>
and removed on the condition of 1176 x 104 Pa(=N/m2) at not less<br>
than 40°C. The extraction time is, for instance, about 1 to<br>
about 30 hours, preferably about 3 hours to about 20 hours, but<br>
it is not limited to the above.<br>
The end point of extraction is determined by extraction<br>
ratio as a criterion as it is difficult to identify the components<br>
affecting the viscosity of marigold oleoresin. Although an<br>
extraction ratio is a ratio of an extract to a substance to be<br>
extracted and varies depending on the quality of the substance<br>
to be extracted, extraction is usually carried out under the<br>
condition of extraction ratio of not less than 10%, preferably<br>
not less than 15%, more preferably not less than 20%.<br>
Then, marigold oleoresin subjected to supercritical<br>
fluid extraction is dissolved in a ketone solvent. Examples<br>
of a ketone solvent used here are acetone, methylethylketone,<br>
diethylketone, etc. , and acetone is preferable. The amount of<br>
acetone is 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 3 parts<br>
by weight, based on 1 part by weight of oleoresin.<br>
A mixture of oleoresin and acetone is stirred for about<br>
0.5 to 1 hour at 40 to 55°C, preferably at 45 to 50°C while keeping<br>
moderate refluxing. The mixture is slowly cooled to 10 to 30°C,<br>
preferably 15 to 25°C over a period of usually 2 to 4 hours.<br>
The cooled mixture is filtered through filter paper or filter<br>
fabric with filter aid, if necessary, such as diatomite.<br>
Purified marigold oleoresin is obtained by concentrating the<br>
filtrate under reduced pressure and removing wheref rom acetone.<br>
The residual solvent in purified marigold oleoresin is removed<br>
at a temperature not exceeding 50°C, under reduced pressure,<br>
preferably in an atmosphere of nitrogen gas.<br>
The method according to the present invention consists<br>
of the combination of a step of subjecting oleoresin to<br>
supercritical fluid extraction and a step of dissolving oleoresin<br>
in a ketone solvent, cooling the solution and removing the<br>
ingredient which precipitated in solution. Although either<br>
step may be carried out first, preferably a step of subjecting<br>
oleoresin to supercritical fluid extraction is carried out first,<br>
followed by a step of dissolving the extract in a ketone solvent,<br>
cooling the solution and removing the ingredient which<br>
precipitated in solution.<br>
The purified marigold oleoresin obtained in the present<br>
invention is a liquid or a paste having a low viscosity at room<br>
temperature, in which the content of lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
is not less than 20% , sometimes not less than 30% . The said purified<br>
marigold oleoresin having the viscosity of not more than 20,000<br>
mPa.s, preferably not more than 10,000 mPa.s, more preferably<br>
not more than 5,000 mPa.s is easily obtained. As a result of<br>
this, it has become possible to produce soft capsules containing<br>
highly concentrated lutein-fatty acid ester.<br>
Soft capsules of marigold oleoresin obtained according<br>
to the present invention can be produced by the method known<br>
per se, such as immersion method, stamping method, dripping<br>
method, etc. The shape of soft capsule is not particularly<br>
limited and any shape such as football shape, oblong shape,<br>
spherical shape, triangular shape, teardrop shape, diamond shape,<br>
etc. may be employed, and among which a football shape is usually<br>
preferred. The amount of purified marigold oleoresin of the<br>
present invention per soft capsule is about 50 to 5,000mg,<br>
preferably about 250 to 300 mg. Purified marigold oleoresin<br>
in soft capsules is stable for a long period of time. Soft<br>
capsules of marigold oleoresin are useful as a health food, a<br>
dietary supplement, a food color, a pharmaceutical color and<br>
a medicinal drug.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
The following examples specifically illustrate the<br>
present invention.<br>
A METHOD OF MEASURING THE CONTENT OF LUTEIN-FATTY ACID ESTER<br>
About 0.1g of test sample was accurately measured and<br>
dissolved in hexane to make a 100ml solution. It was diluted<br>
with hexane so that the resultant solution had absorbance ranging<br>
from 0.3 to 0.7, and then the maximum absorbance of the diluted<br>
solution around 445nm was measured by a spectrophotometer. The<br>
content of lutein-fatty acid ester was calculated by the<br>
following formula.<br>
Content(%)=<br>
( (Absorbance ? Weight of Sample) x Dilution Ratio)? 1,394 x 100<br>
Note: 1,394 is absorbance coefficient at 445nm.<br>
VISCOSITY DETERMINATION<br>
According to "Method 2: Rotatory Viscosity<br>
Determination" in "28. Viscosity Determination Method"<br>
mentioned in the 7th edition of THE JAPAN'S SPECIFICATIONS AND<br>
STANDARDS FOR FOOD ADDITIVES, viscosity was determined. For<br>
determination. No.4 rotor was used and number of rotation was<br>
chosen depending on presumed viscosity. Furthermore, the<br>
determination time of 30 seconds was fixed.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
100g of marigold oleoresin (lutein-fatty acid ester:<br>
16.9 wt%) was placed in a 1-L extraction vessel and, after<br>
supplying supercritical carbon dioxide of 1764 x 104 Pa(=N/m )<br>
at 50 ºC into the vessel, subjected to extraction. The resulting<br>
extract solution was separated in a separator vessel under a<br>
decreased pressure of 490 x 104 Pa(=N/m2) and a raised temperature<br>
of 60°C. As a result, 24.4g of the extract was obtained.<br>
Next, about 75g of the extract residue was mixed with<br>
190ml of acetone and dissolved while heating the mixture to 50°C.<br>
The solution was slowly cooled to 20°C over a period of about<br>
3 hours, the generated insoluble substance was removed by<br>
filtration and the filtered solution was concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure. As a result, about 71g of purified marigold<br>
oleoresin (lutein-fatty acid ester: 23.8 wt%) was obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
100g of marigold oleoresin (lutein-fatty acid ester:<br>
23 .3 wt%) and 30g of rape-seed oil were placed in a 1-L extraction<br>
vessel and, after supplying supercritical carbon dioxide of 1764<br>
x 104 Pa(=N/m2) at 50°C into the vessel, subjected to extraction.<br>
The resulting extract solution was separated in a separator<br>
vessel under a decreased pressure of 490 x 104 Pa(=N/m2) and a<br>
raised temperature of 60°C. As a result, 50.1g of the extract<br>
was obtained.<br>
Next, 79 . 9g of the extract residue was mixed with 210ml<br>
of acetone and dissolved while heating the mixture to 50°C. The<br>
solution was slowly cooled to 20°C over a period of about 3 hours,<br>
the generated insoluble substance was removed by filtration,<br>
and the filtered solution was concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
As a result, about 76g of purified marigold oleoresin<br>
(lutein-fatty acid ester: 30.5wt%) was obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
100g of marigold oleoresin (lutein-fatty acid ester:<br>
26.9 wt%) was mixed with 250 ml of acetone and dissolved by warming<br>
to 50 °C. The solution was slowly cooled to 20 °C over a period<br>
of about 3 hours and the generated insoluble substance was removed<br>
by filtration. The filtrated solution was concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure, as a result 94. 8g of the extract was obtained.<br>
Next, 94.8g of the extract and 30g of rape-seed oil<br>
were placed in a 1-L extraction vessel and, after supplying<br>
supercritical carbon dioxide of 1764 x 104 Pa(=N/m2) at 50°C into<br>
the vessel, subjected to extraction. The resulting extract<br>
solution was separated in a separator vessel under a decreased<br>
pressure of 490 x 104 Pa(=N/m2) and a raised temperature of 60°C,<br>
and 45.5g of the extract was obtained. About 79g of purified<br>
marigold oleoresin (lutein-fatty acid ester: 32.9 wt%) was<br>
obtained as the extract residue.<br>
Viscosity of marigold oleoresin (starting material)<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to the present invention, marigold oleoresin<br>
having a low viscosity and a high lutein content is obtained<br>
by combining a step of subjecting oleoresin to supercritical<br>
fluid extraction and a step of dissolving marigold oleoresin<br>
in a ketone solvent, cooling the solution and removing the<br>
ingredient which precipitated in solution such as phospholipids,<br>
etc. The purified marigold oleoresin obtained according to the<br>
present invention can be filled in soft capsules and is useful<br>
as a health food, a dietary supplement, a food color, a<br>
pharmaceutical color and a medicinal drug.<br>
