				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a bearing element with a metallic support body, a bearing metal layer arranged on top and a polymer layer arranged over the latter, whereby the polymer layer comprises a polyimide resin, molybdenum sulphide (MoS2) and graphite, a motor<br>
with a shaft which is mounted by a bearing element, whereby the bearing element com-<br>
prises at least one metal support body and a beaming metal layer arranged over the latter,<br>
as well as the use of a lubricating varnish made from a polymer. <br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Coatings of tribologically stressed components or surfaces need to satisfy various differ-<br><br>
ent requirements. On the one hand, a coating is required that as low friction as possible, that is relatively soft and which can therefore adapt well to wear-related abrasion and lu-bricating partners. On the other hand, it needs to have a sufficiently high degree of me-chanical stability and strength in order to absorb the static and the dynamic vibrational<br><br>
loads and thus increase its fatigue strength and lifetime. Developments, for example in<br>
the motor industry, are moving towards greater specific performance, in order to increase<br>
effectiveness in particular with respect to ever stricter standards relating to exhaust gas, and thereby increase the profitability and ecofriendliness of internal combustion engines. A large number of components in an internal combustion engine are affected by this development, such as for example the radial lubricating bearings that are highly stressed by<br><br>
very high torques and the continually increasing ignition pressures for optimising the<br><br>
combustion process, for example in a direct injection turbo diesel engine. By means of<br><br>
the high-performance injection systems of these engines the components of the injection pumps and their measuring instruments are also subject to these high stresses, or other components such as rams, pins or rollers are affected by the high loads. Aluminium al-loys are frequently used for these components, as thereby a good ratio can be achieved between the properties obtained and the requirejd costs.<br>
The most recent developments in this field increasingly show the use of so-called lubri-cating varnishes - even though their use has been known about in principle for several years.<br><br>
Thus, e.g. DE 22 06 400 A describes a bonding material with a metallic support body and a frictional or lubricating layer bonded by adhesive to the support body made of thermally highly resistant plastics, which contains thermosetting polyimide resins and additives improving the running properties of the bearing, such as polytetrafluoroethyl-ene, metallic bearing alloys or the like, whereby the friction and/or the lubricating layer<br>
contains the polyimide resins and the additives Improving the running property as a mix-<br><br>
ture of fine-grained or fine-powdered material, and contains polyimide varnish as the binding agent, which bonds the fine-grained or fine-powdered mixture in the frictional<br>
and/or lubricating layer as well as the frictional |or lubricating layer itself to the support<br><br>
body. The lubricating layer can in this case contain between 70 and 20 wt. % thermoset-ting polyimide resins and about 30 to 80 wt. % self-lubricating additives. Graphite, mo-lybdenum and oxides are named as the self-lubricating additives.<br>
From EP 0 939 106 A a lubricating coating material is known which as a matrix material contains PTFE or PTFE in combination with other fluorothermoplasts, the melting point of which lies above 260Â°C, whereby at least one  powdered polyaramide is included, the proportion of which relative to the total amount of PTFE or the mixture of PTFE and other fluorothermoplasts and the polyaramideis 10 to 50 vol. %.<br>
Also in EP 1 236 914 A a lubricating bearing is described which has a resin coating on a bearing metal layer, whereby the resin coating has a thermosetting resin with specific physical properties in an amount from 70 to 30 vol.% with self-lubricating additives in an amount from 30 to 70 vol. %, and whereby th|e Vickers hardness level is not greater than 20. The resin can for example be apolyamide imide resin. Molybdenum disulphide,<br>
graphite, boron nitride, tungsten disulphide, polytetrafluoroethylene, lead etc. are named<br><br>
as self-lubricating additives.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The underlying objective of the invention is to provide a bearing element with a polymer<br>
coating which has improved properties.<br><br>
This objective of the invention is solved independently in that the proportion of polyim-<br>
ide resin in the polymer layer of the bearing element is selected from a range with a<br>
lower limit of 60% and an upper limit of 80%, the proportion of M0S2 is selected from a<br>
range with a lower limit of 15% and an upper limit of 25% and the proportion of graphite<br><br>
is selected from a range with a lower limit of 5% and an upper limit of 15%, whereby the proportion of the polyimide resin is preferably related to the dissolved polyimide resin in the solvent to be removed, i.e. to the proportion of resin in the varnish to be applied, by<br>
an engine, in which to prevent material transfer from the shaft to the bearing element<br><br>
with a fixed shaft a polymer layer is arranged of the bearing metal layer, and by the use<br><br>
of a lubricating varnish for this.<br>
Compared to lubricating varnish coatings already used in the field of lubricating bearings the composition according to the invention shows in a surprising manner, despite the high proportion of M0S2 and graphite in the polyimide resin, an unexpected improve-ment in the wearing resistance of the bearing element. It is unexpected, as with less poly-imide resin, which can be seen as a bonding agent for the friction-reducing additives, it would be expected that the cohesiveness of the layer would deteriorate and that the latter would "break up". This does not occur with the selected proportions of MoS2 and graph-ite, in particular with the ratio of the proportion of MoS2 to graphite, whereby the Appli-cant has developed no theory for this at the current time. It is suspected however that there is an interaction between the MoS2 and the graphite particles.<br>
In addition to the improved wearing resistance with the bearing element according to the<br>
invention the resistance to cavitation is also improved. Furthermore, there is a reduction<br><br>
in its tendency to corrode.	<br>
It is also an advantage that the polymer layer according to the invention can be applied<br><br>
directly onto the bearing metal layer, i.e. a nickel layer, as used for conventional lubricat-ing bearings known from the prior art, is no logger needed as a diffusion barrier, so that a<br>
bearing element according to the invention is not only equally as good in terms of its<br><br>
mechanical properties as conventional multilayered lubricating bearings, but it is also more economical to produce the bearing element of the invention.<br>
It is also advantageous that the polymer layer according to the invention is not limited to<br>
special bearing elements but according to current knowledge can be applied onto every<br>
bearing metal.<br>
In the past bearings were subject to failure where aluminium was used as the bearing material, presumably due to material transfer and microwelding of the bearing material<br>
onto the shaft caused by micromovements. These kinds of material transfers can occur<br><br>
when the shaft lies at rest on the bearing, and the whole system makes micromovements, e.g. when transporting an assembled engine to the site of use, or during the operation of several motors adjacent to one another, when not all of the latter are running simultaneously. With the motor according to the  invention this is prevented in an advantageous manner by the polymer layer, as said layer has practically no affinity to steel. However, even if there is a very small transfer of material, for example the embedding of the lubricating varnish into the roughness profile of the shaft, this is not in fact a problem as the pairing lubricating varnish-lubricating varnish creates even less<br>
friction than the pairing lubricating varnish-steel.<br>
In embodiments of the invention the proportion of the polyimide resin, preferably related<br>
i<br>
to polyimide resin with solvent, can be selected from a range with a lower limit of 65% and an upper limit of 75% or a lower limit of 67.5% and an upper limit of 72.5% or the proportion of polyamide resin can be 70%.      <br>
It is also advantageous that the proportion of MoS2 is selected from a range with a lower limit of 17% and an upper limit of 22% or a lower limit of 18.5% and an upper limit of 21.5% or the proportion of M0S2 is 20%.<br>
Furthermore, according to further developments of the invention the proportion of graph-<br><br>
ite is selected from a range with a lower limit of 7% and an upper limit of 13% or an up-<br><br>
per limit of 8.5% and an upper limit of 11.5% cjr the proportion of graphite is 10%.<br>
With all of these embodiments - or with all of the following data on the lower and upper range limits - it is possible for the respective proportions to be selected if necessary from the respective limit ranges between the lower limits and upper limits.<br>
It has proved to be particularly advantageous if a polyamide imide resin is used as the polyimide resin for the polymer layer.<br>
By means of the aforementioned measures it is not only possible to optimise all of the properties of the polymer layer, but it is also possible to adapt individual properties specifically, such as e.g. wearing resistance, corrosion resistance, resistance to friction weld-<br><br>
ing etc., to the respective area of use, even if the further properties of the polymer layer are not improved to the same extent.<br>
The M0S2 platelets can have an average length selected from a range with a lower limit of 10 Î¼m and an upper limit of 40 Î¼m or a lowejr limit of 15Î¼m and an upper limit of 35 Î¼m or a lower limit of 18 Î¼m and an upper limit of 25 Î¼m and/or an average width, se-lected from a range with a lower limit of 10Î¼m and an upper limit of 40 Î¼m or an lower limit of 15 Î¼m and an upper limit of 35Î¼m or a lower limit of 18 Î¼m and an upper limit of 25 Î¼m and/or an average height, selected from a range with a lower limit of 2 nm and an upper limit of 20 nm or a lower limit of 5 nni and an upper limit of 15 nm or a lower limit of 5 nm and an upper limit of 8 nm.<br>
It is also possible for graphite to be used with a particle size selected from a range with a<br>
lower limit of 2 Î¼m and an upper limit of 8Î¼m.<br>
The ratio of MoS2 to graphite can be selected according to a further development of the invention from a range with a lower limit of 1.5 : 1 and an upper limit of 4.5 : 1.<br>
In this way the self-lubricating behaviour of the polymer layer can be varied over broad limits, so that if necessary taking into consideration the respective proportions of MoS2<br><br>
]<br>
or graphite, i.e. on varying the proportion ratios of these two additives to polyimide resin, at least one of the properties of the polymer layer can be adapted in particular to the respective application.<br>
The bearing metal layer can be formed by an alloy, selected from a group comprising aluminium base alloys, tin-based alloys, lead-based alloys, copper-based alloys, CuPb-based alloys, AlSn-based alloys, alloys with a base of AlZn, AISi, AlSnSi, CuAl, CuSn, CuZn, CuSnZn, CuZnSn, CuBi and AIBi, whereby the latter are well known with respect<br>
to their properties from the relevant literature on bearing elements and need not be dis-<br>
cussed in more detail here. In this case the advantage is that the adhesiveness of the<br>
polymer layer to these bearing metal materials is improved even without the use of otherwise necessary adhesive intermediate layers.<br>
As already mentioned, it is also advantageous if the polymer layer is arranged directly on the bearing metal layer, so that conventionally used diffusion barrier layers such as e.g. nickel barriers need not be used.<br>
It is also possible, particularly with sufficient adhesiveness that the bearing metal layer is arranged directly on the support body, i.e. without intermediate layers and adhesive means, whereby the assembly of the bearing element can be simplified and thus the<br>
manufacturing costs can also potentially be lowered.<br><br>
It has also proved to be advantageous after the testing of the bearing element according to the invention, if the surface of the polymer layer has an arithmetic average roughness value Ra according to DIN EN ISO 4287 or ASME B 46.1, selected from a range with a lower limit of 0.2 Î¼m and an upper limit of 1.5 Î¼m or a lower limit of 0.5Î¼m and an u-per limit of 1.0 nm or a lower limit of 0.8 Î¼m arid an upper limit of 0.9 Î¼m, or if accord-<br><br>
ing to further embodiments the surface of the pcjlymer layer has a maximum roughness profile height Rz according to DIN EN ISO 4287 or ASME B 46.1, selected from a range with a lower limit of 0.5 Î¼m and an upper limit of 10 Î¼m or a lower limit of 3 Î¼m and an upper limit of 8 Î¼m or a lower limit of 5 Î¼m and an upper limit of 6 Î¼m.<br>
By these means it is achieved, on the one hand, that during the warm-up phase due to the<br><br>
profile tips there is a smaller contact surface to the shaft to be mounted - as viewed rela-tive to the entire inner surface of the bearing element -, and thereby lower friction, as would be expected purely from the material selection or a polyimide resin-steel pairing, and, on the other hand, after this warm-up phase the tips are worn away so far that the bearing has the necessary play tolerances.<br>
The polymer layer can have an average thickness selected from a range with a lower limit of 1 Î¼m and an upper limit of 40 Î¼m or a lower limit of 3 Î¼m and an upper limit of 30 Î¼m or a lower limit of 4 Î¼m and an upper limit of 25 Î¼m, whereby the bearing element can be adapted according to the respective application, such as e.g. large bearings or small bearings, and thus a corresponding optimising of the cost can be achieved with long-term reliable, uniform properties of the besiring element.<br>
The polymer layer advantageously has a Vickers hardness, selected from a range with a lower limit of 20 HV and an upper limit of 45 HV or a lower limit of 22 HV and an up-per limit of 35 HV or a lower limit of 25 HV and an upper limit of 30 HV, whereby suitably improved lubricating properties can be obtained with sufficient fatigue strength of the bearing element<br>
In particular the bearing element is designed as a lubricating bearing shell or half-shell or bearing bush.<br>
The polymer layer used in a motor with a fixed shaft for a bearing element is formed in particular by a polymer layer with a composition according to the invention. It is also possible however, that the polymer layer is formed by a polymer, selected from a group comprising polytetrafluoroethylene, polyimide resins, epoxy resins, phenol resins, poly-amide 6, polyamide 66, polyoxymethylene, silicons, polyaryl ether ketones, polyaryl ether-ether ketones, polyvinylidene difluorides, polyethylene sulphides, whereby there can be a corresponding adjustment to the expec :ed movement, as these polymers have completely different properties, in particular with respect to the material transfer from the shaft to the bearing element which is caused by the micro-movement.<br>
In this case the polymer layer can also include friction-reducing additives, such as e.g.<br><br><br>
M0S2, graphite, boron nitride (hexagonal), tungsten disulphide, PTFE, lead, so that said polymer layer can not only be used to ensure "transport safety" but at least in the warm-up phase of the engine can be used to provide a suitable reduction in sliding friction between the bearing element and the shaft.<br>
As already mentioned, on a bearing element a lubricating varnish can be used consisting of a polymer, in particular selected from a group comprising polytetrafluoroethylene, polyimide resins, epoxy resins, phenol resins, polyamide 6, polyamide 66, polyoxy-methylene, silicons, polyaryl ether ketones, polyaryl ether-ether ketones, polyvinylidene difluorides, polyethylene sulphides, to produce a polymer layer as a protective layer to prevent the transfer of material from a fixed shaft onto the bearing element. In this way it is possible to complete engines directly at the manufacturers without having to take spe-cial precautions or without running the risk that during the transport of the already com-pleted engines the material of the bearing becomes welded to the shaft. It is thus possible to supply such components in a preassembled form to the respective customer, in particu-lar the car industry, which is known to be following the trend of increasingly buying fin-ished components, with lower damage rates to the components.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br><br>
For a better understanding of the invention the letter is explained in more detail with<br>
reference to the following figures. In a schematically simplified view:<br>
Fig. 1      shows a bearing element according to the invention in the form of a lubricating bearing half-shell;	<br>
Fig. 2     shows a diagram in which the respective critical limit is shown as a function of varying proportions of M0S2 and graphite.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Firstly, it should be mentioned that in various embodiments described the same parts are provided with the same reference numbers and the same component names, whereby the disclosures contained throughout the entire description can be applied to the same parts<br>
with the same reference number and same component names, The indications of position<br>
used in the description, such as e.g. top, bottom side etc. relate to the Figure being de-scribed at the time and should be transposed to new positions after a change in position.<br>
Furthermore, individual features or combinations of features from the various different embodiments that are shown and described can form independent inventive solutions in<br>
their own right.	<br><br>
The bearing element 1 according to Fig, 1 is made up of a support body 2, a bearing<br><br>
metal layer 3 and a polymer layer 4 as a running layer. The support body 2 is usually<br>
made of steel but can of course also be made of comparable materials which can perform<br>
the same or similar function, i.e. provide the mechanical strength of the bearing element<br>
1. The mechanical strength of the entire bearing element 1 is thus dependent on the re<br>
spective area of use, so that for example various different copper alloys such as e.g.<br>
brass, bronzes can be used. In addition the support body 2 ensures a certain degree of<br>
stability of shape.	<br><br>
The bearing metal layer 3 is formed by a bearing metal alloy. The latter in this embodiment comprises an aluminium matrix in which at least one soft phase and hard particles<br>
are embedded. The at least one soft phase can be formed by at least one element from a first element group comprising tin, antimony, indium and bismuth. The hard particles can e.g. be formed by at least one element of a second element group comprising copper, manganese, cobalt, chromium and iron or by the elements scandium and/or zirconium. It is also possible that these hard particles are formed by intermetallic phases in particular the latter elements or the elements of the second element group with aluminium or by intermetallic phases formed by the said elements.<br><br><br>
Of course, any other soft phases and/or hard paiticles known from the prior art can be contained in the bearing metal alloy.	<br>
By means of the soft phase it is possible to give the bearing element 1 emergency operat-<br>
ing properties if defects occur in the polymer layer 4 due to the operation of the bearing<br>
element 1 and thus the bearing metal layer 3 comes into contact at least almost directly with a component to be mounted, e.g. a shaft. Thus the bearing element 1 is also given the ability to embed the hard particles originating from abrasion after the use of the bear-ing element 1. The hard particles give the aluminium alloy the necessary mechanical strength.<br>
Alloys based on tin, bismuth, indium, lead or aluminium are also suitable for the bearing<br>
metal layer 3 as well as alloys with a high lead content CuPb- or AlSn- or AIBi base. In<br>
particular higher tin-containing tin bases alloys are advantageous. Even lead-free copper<br>
based alloys can be used.	<br>
Copper-based bearing metals that could be used would be for example CuPb22Sn2, CuPblOSnlO, CuPbl5Sn7, CuSn6, CuSn4 Znl.  In particular lead-free copper alloys with a base of CuAl, CuSn, CuZn, CuSnZn, CuZnSn and CuBi base are advantageous with respect to the lower level of pollution.<br>
Tin-based bearing metals that could be used would be for example SnSb8Cu4, SnSbl2Cu6Pb.<br>
Lead-based bearing metals that could be used would be for example PbSb10Sn6,<br>
PbSbl5Snl0,PbSbl5SnAs.	<br>
Aluminium based bearing metals can form e.g. AlSn40, AlSn20, AlSn25, AlSn10, AlSn6<br>
etc.<br>
It is also possible to use bearing metals with an AlZn base, such as e.g. AlZn4SiPb or an AISi base, such as e.g. AlSil lCuMgNi or an AISnSi- base such as e.g. AlSn20Si4.<br><br>
According to the invention the polymer layer 4 Consists of a polyimide resin, molybdenum sulphide and graphite, whereby the proportion of the polyimide resin in the polymer layer 4<br>
is selected from a range with a lower limit of 60 % and an upper limit of 80%, the propor-<br><br>
tion of MoS2, selected from a range with a lower limit of 15% and an upper limit of 25% and the proportion of graphite selected from a range with a lower limit of 5% and an upper limit of 15%.<br>
The resin can be provided in at least one solvent, in particular an organic solvent, such as<br><br>
e.g. xylol, which can improve its processability The proportion of solvent can here be selected from a range with a lower limit of 40 wt.% and an upper limit of 80 wt.%, in particular with a lower limit of 50 wt.% and an upper limit of 70 wt.%, preferably with a lower limit of 60 wt % and an upper limit of 65 wt. % relative to the resin proportion, i.e. resin with solvent. Thus the dry resin content, in particular the polyamide imide resin can be selected from a range with a lower limit of 20 wt. % and an upper limit of 50 wt. %, in particular a lower limit of 30 wt. % and an upper limit of 40 wt. %, preferably a lower limit of 35 wt. % and an upper limit of 37.5 wt. %. In this respect a polymer layer 4 applied according to the invention can have for example a dry composition of 35 wt. % polyamide imide resin, 45 wt. % M0S2 and 20 wt. % graphite, or a dry composition which is calculated from the given value ranges for the individual contents of the poly-mer layer 4.<br>
If necessary, said polymer layer 4 can contain further additives to increase its mechanical<br>
strength, such as for example fibre matrices, such as e.g. aramide fibres, hard materials,<br><br>
such as e.g. carbides, oxides, nitrides. These kinds of additives are already known from the prior art for these kinds of polymer layers 4 for bearing elements 1, for example from EP 1 236 914 Al. Thus it is possible e.g. to use hard materials made of CrC2, Fe3C4, PbO, ZnO, CdO, Al2O3, SiO2, SnC2, SiC, Si3N4., whereby their proportions can vary within the usual limits such as e.g., described in this EP-A1.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if hard particles are used to adjust the frictional value<br>
which are already contained in the layer 3.<br>
It is also particularly advantageous if the ratio between the proportions of M0S2 and<br><br>
graphite in the polymer layer 4 is selected from a range of 1.5 : 1 to 4.5 : 1, for example 1.5: l to<br>
2.5:1.<br>
With the composition for the polymer layer 4 according to the invention it is possible to produce a running layer with good lubrication and emergency operation properties, if necessary even permitting dry running. The lattir is characterised in particular by requir-ing little maintenance. It is possible to operate using very little lubricant or no lubricant at all. If necessary water can be used for lubrication which is particularly advantageous if the bearing element 1 according to the invention is used e.g. for pumps. As well as a cor-responding reduction in weight a lower sensitivity to bearing end pressure can be ob-served.<br>
The bearing element 1 according to the invention can be used instead of the design as a lubricating bearing half-shell, as shown in Fig. 1, in other areas, for example as a thrust ring, lubricating bush etc., in particular for use in the motor industry.<br>
Table 1 lists examples of compositions selected from the ranges according to the inven-tion for the proportions of polyimide resin with solvent to be removed, M0S2 and graph-ite for the polymer layer 4, whereby the latter of course are not intended to be limiting<br>
for the invention, but these examples merely display the character of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
Bearing elements 1 with this composition were produced consisting of a steel protective shell onto which a CuPb22Sn2 bearing metal was applied and then the polymer layer 4 on top. It was shown in the subsequent investigations that with this composition very similar properties for the bearing element 1 can be produced, so that in the following these properties are discussed with reference to a bearing element 1 only by way of ex-ample with a polymer layer 4, containing 70% polyimide resin, 20% MoS2 and 10% graphite.<br>
With regard to a critical limit for frictional welding of 100% for the bearing according to the invention a standard bearing from the prior art with a PTFE coating on AlSn 40 has by comparison a limit that is about 87% worse under the same experimental conditions.<br>
The wearing resistance was measured on a bearing with the same dimensions and the same lubrication conditions. It was shown that the polymer layer 4 according to the invention had a wearing resistance 8 times better than a PTFE layer.<br>
In further investigations the polymer layer 4 with this composition according to the invention was applied onto a bearing metal layer made of CuPb22Sn2 or AlSn25, and it<br><br>
was discovered that the wearing resistance varies within +/- 5% of the value achieved with AlSn40, which means that the polymer layer 4 according to the invention can be<br>
applied at least onto all current bearing metals without their excellent properties chang-<br><br>
ing considerably.<br>
Corresponding improvements can also be achieved with respect to corrosion.<br><br>
In Fig. 2 the critical corrosion limit is given in percent against the proportion of graphite and the proportion of oS2 both in percent, whereby for the composition 70% resin, 20% MoS2 and 10% graphite the value 100% is standard, and the respective figures can be taken from Table 2. From this graphic it can be seen clearly that the polymer layer 4 according to the invention, i.e. bearing elements 1 provided with the layer have much better results with respect to the critical corrosion limit than corresponding polyimide resin layers, which are known from the prior art.<br><br>
With regard to the self-lubricating behaviour it has been found that the properties can be improved if MoS2 platelets are used which have the dimensions already mentioned above.<br>
It is also an advantage if graphite is used with a particle size selected from a range with a lower limit of 2 Î¼m and an upper limit of 8Î¼m.<br>
A further improvement of the properties, in particular the wear resistance to cavitation and the resistance to corrosion, both in warm-up mode and continuous operation, can be<br>
achieved if a bearing element 1 is produced with the polymer layer 4 composed accord-<br>
ing to the invention, in which said polymer layer 4 has a roughness profile, with values<br>
for the roughness profile Rz according to DIN ISO 4287 or ASME B 46.1 or arithmetic average roughness values Ra also according to DIN ISO 4287 or ASME B 46.1 accord-ing to the already described values or selected  from the ranges given.<br><br>
The manufacture of the bearing element 1 according to the invention is carried out so that the bearing metal layer 3 is formed on a metal support body 2 using methods known from the prior art, such as e.g. rolling, casting, sintering, electrolyte deposition or by means of a sputtering method.. The polymer layer 4 according to the invention can also be applied onto said bearing metal layer 3 using methods known from the prior art, such as e.g. a spraying method or spreading method, whereby the polymer layer can subsequently be heat treated. Suitable pretreatments are also known from the prior art which means that they need not be discussed here.<br>
The polymer layer 4 according to the invention is particularly suitable for the equipment of bearing elements 1 for engines, whereby said polymer layer 4 is used as a protective layer or "packaging layer" to avoid the transfer of material from the shaft to the bearing metal or bearing element 1 and prevent microwelding, which can lead to engine failure. In order to obtain and increase this effect it is also possible to coat the shaft itself with the polymer layer 4. Generally, the polymer layer 4 can be used as a so-called protective layer to prevent such microwelding caused by the transfer of material from a mounted component to a corresponding bearing component.<br>
For this design of a protective layer or "packaging layer" for the transport of already assembled engines with fixed shafts, in addition to the particularly suitable polymer layer 4 according to the invention, polymer layers can also be used that are based on polytetra-fluoroethylene, polyimide resins, epoxy resins, phenol resins, polyamide 6, polyamide 66, polyoxymethylene, silicons, polyaryl ether ketones, polyaryl ether-ether ketones, polyvinylidene difluorides, polyethylene sulphides, as well as mixtures thereof, whereby also self-lubricating additives such as e.g. MoS2, graphite, hexagonal BN, diverse metal sulphides etc. can be added to said polymers, as well as the already mentioned hard par-ticles.<br>
The exemplary embodiments show possible design variants of the bearing element 1,<br>
whereby it should be mentioned at this point, tnat the invention is not restricted to the embodiments shown in particular, but rather various different combinations of the indi-<br><br>
vidual embodiment variants are possible, and these possible variations are within the capability of one skilled in this technical field based on the technical teaching of the present invention. Thus all conceivable design variants are covered by the protection of this patent that are possible by combining individual details of the embodiments shown and<br>
described.<br>
For form's sake it should be mentioned that for a better understanding of the structure of the bearing element 1 the latter and its components are not completely true to scale and/or have been enlarged and/or reduced in size.<br>
The underlying objective of the independent solutions according to the invention can be<br>
taken from the description.	</td>
