TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
N-SUBSTITUTED 11YDROXYPYR1MIDINONE CARBOXAMIDE INHIBITORS<br>
OF HIV INTEGRASE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to N-substituted 5-hydroxy-6~oxo-l,6-dihydropyrimidinc-4-carboxamides and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, their synthesis, and their use as inhibitors of the HIV intcgrase enzyme.   The compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of the present invention are useful for preventing or treating infection by HIV and for treating or delaying the onset of AIDS.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of the complex disease that includes progressive destruction of the immune system (acquired immune deficiency syndrome; AIDS) and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system. This virus was previously known as LAV. HTLV-II1, or ARV. A common feature of retrovirus replication is the insertion by virally-encoded integrase of proviral DNA into the host cell genome, a required step in HIV replication in human T-lymphoid and monocytoid cells. Integration is believed to be mediated by integrase in three steps: assembly of a stable nucleoprotein complex with viral DNA sequences; cleavage of two nucleotides from the 3' termini of the linear proviral DNA; covalent joining of the recessed 3* OH termini of the proviral DNA at a staggered cut made at the host target site. The fourth step in the process, repair synthesis of the resultant gap, may be accomplished by cellular enzymes.<br>
Nucleotide sequencing of HIV shows the presence of a pol gene in one open reading frame [Ratner, L. et al., Nature, 313, 277(1985)]. Amino acid sequence homology provides evidence that the pol sequence encodes reverse transcriptase, integrase and an HIV protease [Toh, H. et al., EMBO J. 4, 1267 (1985); Power, M.D. et al.. Science, 231, 1567 (1986); Pearl, L.H. et al.. Nature, 329. 351 (1987)]. All three enzymes have been shown to be essential for the replication of HIV.<br>
It is known that some antiviral compounds which act as inhibitors of HIV replication are effective agents in the treatment of AIDS and similar<br><br>
diseases, including reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as azidothymidine (AZT) and efavirenz and protease inhibitors such as indinavir and nelftnavir. The compounds of this invention are inhibitors of HIV integrase and inhibitors of HIV replication. The inhibition of integrase in vitro and HIV replication in cells is a direct result of inhibiting the strand transfer reaction catalyzed by the recombinant integrase in vitro in HIV infected cells. The particular advantage of the present invention is highly specific inhibition of HIV integrase and HIV replication.<br>
SUMMARY OF Till- INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel hydroxypyrimidinone carboxamides. These compounds are useful in the inhibition of HIV integrase, the prevention of infection by HIV. the treatment of infection by HIV and in the prevention, treatment, and delay in the onset of AIDS and/or ARC, either as compounds or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts or hydrates (when appropriate), or as pharmaceutical composition ingredients, whether or not in combination with other HIV/AIDS antivirals, anti-infectives, immunomodulators, antibiotics or vaccines.

In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants which are themselves known to those of ordinary skill in this art, but arc not mentioned in greater detail. Furthermore, other methods for preparing compounds of the invention will be readily apparent to the person of ordinary skill in the art in light of the following reaction schemes and examples. Unless otherwise indicated, all variables are as defined above.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by coupling suitable substituted alkyl l-alkyI-l,6-dihydro-5-hydroxy-6-oxopyrimidine-4-carboxylates (or carboxylic acids or halides) with the appropriate amines, as represented by Scheme I. In the scheme, P is H or a protective group, typically an ester (e.g., benzoate or pivalate) that is normally removed under the conditions employed to convert the the methyl ester to the amide. The ester protective group is typically used to purify the 2-substituted-5,6 dihydroxypyrimidine-4-carboxylates after their synthesis when the unprotected product cannot be crystallized from the reaction crude and/or for synthetic reasons.<br><br><br>
Methods for coupling carboxylic acid derivatives with amines to form carboxamides are well known in the art. Suitable methods are described, for example, in Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1985, pp. 370-376. Amines of formula 1-1 can be prepared using the methods described in Richard Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations. VCH Publishers Inc, 1989, pp 385-438, or routine variations thereof.<br>
Methyl l-alkyl-l,6-dihydro-5-hydroxy-6-oxopyrimidine-4-carboxylates of formula 1-2 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 2, wherein amidoxime 2-1 can be reacted with DMAD in an appropriate solvent and at a suitable temperature to give the intermediate dihydroxypyrimidine 2-2, followed by protection of the 5-hydroxy group in 2-2 with a suitable protecting agent such as benzoate or pivalate to give 2-3, and then alkylation of nitrogcn-1 to afford 1-2. This procedure is described in the literature [Culbertson et al., J Ileterocycl Chew, 1979, J_6 (7): 1423-24]. Dihydroxypyrimidine 2-2 can be isolated or directly protected to give 2-3. The alkyl group can be introduced on Ni by reaction of 2-3 with an alkylating agent in the presence of an inorganic base (e.g., cesium carbonate).  If a mixture of N- and O-alkylated derivatives results, the desired N-alkylated product 1-2 can be separated by flash chromatography. Scheme 2 is exemplified in Example 1.<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
(- ~i<br>
Methyl l-alkyl-l,6-dihydro-5-hydroxy-6-oxopyrimidine-4-carboxyIates of formula 1-2 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 3, wherein an N-alkylamidoxime 3-1 can be reacted with dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate to give the unprotected 1-2 (P- 11). The unprotected compound can be isolated as such or it can be converted to 1-2 by reaction with a suitable protecting group. Scheme 3 is exemplified in Example 2.<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
Amidoximes 2-1 and 3-1 are prepared from the corresponding nitriles by chemistry described herein (see Example 1, Step 1 and Example 2, Step 2). Nitriles can be prepared from carboxylic acids by various procedures known in the an.<br><br>
including, for example, conversion to carboxamides by the procedure of of Pozdnev<br>
{Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 30: 5193) (see also, Example 6, Step 2), and dehydration of<br>
the amide by the procedure of Waldmann {Tetrahedron 1994, 50: 11865) (see also,<br>
Example 6, Step 3).<br>
Compounds of the present invention of general formula 3-3 or 3-6 can<br>
be prepared in accordance with Scheme 3, Parts 1 and 2, wherein haloderivative 3-1<br>
or 3-4 can be synthesized by the bromination or chlorination of a suitable substrate affording a -CH2Br, -CI bCI, -CHBr-, or -CMC!- group, followed by displacement of<br>
the halogen with a nucleophile ("Nu") such as an amine, thiol, or alcoholatc to obtain the nucleophile-substituted methyl ester intermediate 3-2 or 3-5, which need not be isolated. Elaboration of the methyl ester functionality into the carboxamide will afford the final product 5-3 or 3-6. Scheme 3 is exemplified in Example 5.<br>
Scheme 3 - Part I<br><br><br><br>
Scheme 4 depicts the preparation of compounds of the invention that contain an alkylated aliphatic amine in the substituent at the 2 position. Nitrogen alkylation is achieved via a reductive amination or alkylation. The nitrogen alkylation can be performed before formation of the amide {via 4-3) or after formation of the amide {via 4-2) depending on the substrate, with suitable deprotection as necessary. Scheme 4 is exemplified in Examples 6 to 8 below.<br><br><br>
Compounds of the present invention with general formula 5-3 containing an acylated nitrogen or sulfonylated nitrogen in the substituent at the 2-position, can be prepared following Scheme 5. Acylation or sulfonylation of the nitrogen in the 2-substituent of the pyrimidine core provides compound 5-2, which can bo elaborated into the final amide 5-3 by reaction of a suitable amine in a polar solvent. Scheme 5 is exemplified in Examples 9 to 12 below.<br><br><br>
The preparation of compounds that feature a carboxamide at the 2 position of the pyrimidine core can be achieved as shown in Scheme 6, wherein a starting material bearing a 2-ethyl- and a 4-methylcarboxyIate functionality (6-1) is employed. This strategy will allow the regioselective elaboration of the 4-methyl ester into the carboxamide by reaction with a suitable amine. The other ester bond in the 2 position can then be further elaborated. Scheme 6 is exemplified in Example 13 below.<br><br><br>
Compounds of the present invention of formula 7-2 can be prepared by reaction of aldehydes or ketones 7-1 with suitable amines under reductive alkylation conditions, as shown in Scheme 7. Scheme 7 is cxcmplifed in Kxample 14 below.<br><br><br>
In the processes for preparing compounds of the present invention set forth in the foregoing schemes and exemplified in the examples below, functional groups in various moieties and substituents may be sensitive or reactive under the reaction conditions employed and/or in the presence of the reagents employed. Such sensitivity/reactivity can interfere with the progress of the desired reaction to reduce the yield of the desired product, or possibly even preclude its formation. Accordingly, it may be necessary or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. Protection can be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973 and in T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups can be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known in the art. For example, in preparing the compounds of the invention it is sometimes necessary to protect one or more amino groups (e.g., amino groups present in substituents at the 2-position of the pyrimidinone ring)<br><br>
with, for example, a 13oc or Cbz group or to protect hydroxy (e.g., the 5-hydroxy group on the with, for example, a benzoyl or benzyl group. The Boc group pan be removed by acid treatment (e.g., TFA) either before or after formation of the final amide at C-6 of the pyrimidinone nucleus. The Cbz and benzyl groups are typically removed by catalytic hydrogenation or under strong acid conditions, either prior to or following formation of the final amide. The benzoyl group can be removed concurrently with the formation of the final amide. Examples 6 and 12 below illustrate the use of a Boc protective group and of Boc, benzoyl and benzyl protective groups in the preparation of compounds of the invention.<br><br>
The preparation of compounds that feature a bis oxalamide at the 2 position of the pyrimidine core can be achieved as shown in Scheme 8. wherein a<br><br>
starling material bearing a basic nitrogen at the 2- position of the pyrimidinc carboxyamide (8-1) is employed. This strategy will allow to obtain the final compound (8-3) following two possible procedures: by simple coupling of monoamide oxalic acid to the amine (8-1) or by the acylation of the basic nitrogen of (8-1) with dimethyl oxalate to give the ester intermediate (8-2) that is converted to the final compound by heating in presence of amine in appropriate solvent. Scheme 8 is exemplified in Examples 17, 18, and 20 below.<br>
The following examples serve only to illustrate the invention and its practice. The examples are not to be construed as limitations on the scope or spirit of the invention.<br>
