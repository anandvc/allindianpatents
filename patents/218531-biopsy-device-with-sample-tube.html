312 through a gear train. The gear train can comprise a pimon gear 308, and internnediate<br>
gear 314, and a driven gear 318. Tbe pirion gear can be mounted to the drive shaft of<br>
motor 304, and the motor 304 and internnediate gear 314 can be supported by a bracket<br>
316 which can be attached to a distal face of the journal housing 312,<br>
[0037] 	The driven gear 318 can be mounted to journal 306. Journal 306 is supported for rotation <br>
about a longitudinal axis by bearings 310. Journal 306 includes a longitudinally<br>
extending central bore 334 therethrough. Journal 306 has a threaded feature 306c<br>

-7-<br>
passagsway therethrougrh for cammnicating vacuum from vacuum line 410 to sample<br>
tube 406. The recover 448 can be configured m releasably lock into the floating piston<br>
404 by any suitable mechanism, such as a twist lock mechanismcomprising relaiting<br>
bosses 404a on the floating piston 404 and corresponding receiver slots 408a on the strath,<br>
receiver 408. The twist lock mechanism allows the receiver 408 and sample tube 406 to<br>
be releasably coupled to the biopsy device, such that the sample tube 406 can be inserted<br>
into the device, and then withdrawn from the device once one or more samples have been<br>
received in sample tube 406. A circular magnet 408b can be disposed in a recess in the<br>
distal face at the straw recever 408 - An o-ting 404b can be provided in a groove. on the<br>
outer surface of floating piston 404 to provide sealing with the inner surface of tube 516<br>
as piston 404 iranslates within tube 516, The rear axial vacuum lint 410 can be prtss fit<br>
into the rear of receiver 408 and enables vacuum to be drawn through the center of the<br>
sample tube 406 as the device is operated,<br>
[0040]	 A purtion of the journal assemble 300 can be sized and shaped to fit inside the distal end<br>
of clear, thin-wall tube 516, Tube 516 can be made from a light weight transparent<br>
material, such as clear plastic or polymetic inaterial, to permit viewing of the device<br>
during operation. The proximal end of the needle assembly 100 can then be positioned<br>
over a reduced diameter distal end portion of the clear, thin-wall tube 5l6 that-extends<br>
distally from a lip feature 516 of the tube 516, The needle assembly 100 and journal<br>
assembly 300 can be attached to the thin wall tube 516 by any suitable means, such as by<br>
a pturallty of screws<br>
[0041]	 The main piston assembly 200 is supported for translation within the clear. thin-walled<br>
tube 516 and is positioned proximally of the jounrnal assembly 300. The main piston<br>
assembly 200 is keyed to the tube. 516 by a piston guide tab 204a (figure 3) on the main<br>
piston 204 and a channel feature 516a (Figure la) located on the tube 516. Tab 204a<br>
rides in channel 516a to allow main piston assembly 200 to translate axially inside the<br>
tube 516 while preventing the main piston 204 from rotating relative to the tube 516. An<br><br>
WO2004/052212	PCT/US2003/039364<br>
-8-<br>
o-ring 208 seated in a groove on the outer surface of main piston 204 provides an air scal<br>
between the main piston 204 and inner surface of tube 516.<br>
[0042] 	The floating pision assembly 100 can be disposed inside the clear, thin-wall rube 516 end<br>
is positiuned between the main piston assembly 200 and the end cap 514. The end cap<br>
514 can be fasleted to the proximal end of the tube 516 by any suitable means including<br>
by fasteners, snap fit, or threaded engsgement, O-ring 404b seated in e groove on the<br>
outside surface of floating piston 404 provides an air seal between the floating piston 404<br>
and the inside surface of tube 516.<br>
[0043] 	A return spring, 512 is captured between the main pision assembly 200 and floating piston<br>
assembly 400. The distal end of the return spring 512 can be scated in cavity 214 of main<br>
piston 204, and the proximal end off the return spring 512 can be seated within annular<br>
seat 405 of floating pislon 404, The rethen spring 512 provides constant forward (distal)'<br>
biasing force against the main piston assembly 200 Therefor, when the main piston<br>
assembly 200 is in its rearward (proximal) rnost position, the distal end of threaded<br>
feature 204b is maintained in contact with the proximal end of a journal threaded feature<br>
306c due to the spring force provided by spring 512. The bissing spring force provided<br>
by spring 512 also maintains two engagement wings 206b on the cutter clutch 206 in<br>
engagement with channel slot features 306b of the journal 306. Engngement of the wings<br>
206b with slot features 306b causes cutter clutch 206 (and so cutter 210) to rotate when<br>
journal 306 is rotated by motor 304. in the embodiment shown, piston 204 does not<br>
rotate.<br>
[0044]	 Engagement of the journal's intermal threads 306c with the main piston's external threads<br>
204b causes cutter clutch 206 (and so cutter 210) in advance in lcad. screw fashion at a<br>
specd based on the number of threads per inch and the spied of rotation of thejournal.<br>
With this mechanism, translation and rotation of cutter 210 is provided by rotation of<br>
journal 306 driven by a stogie motor 304 -<br><br>
WO2004/052212	PCT/US2003/039364 <br>
-9-<br>
[0045] 	The motor 304 can be operated to rotate clockwise, advancing and romting the cutter 210<br>
so the distal end of the cutter 210 advances in the upper lumen of needle 104 past the<br>
tissue receiving port 104 and cuts a tissue sample through the lateral port 104c in the<br>
needle assemble 100. Oncs the cutter 210 has fully tranalated past the needle lateral post<br>
104c, the main pistons threaded feature 204b "rides" off the distal end of the journal's<br>
threaded, feature 306c, thereby preventing further translation forward. However, the<br>
motor 304 can be operated to continue to rotate a predetermined number of rotations,<br>
rotating the journal's channel featura 306b and therefore the cuttet 210 for additional<br>
revolutions to guarantee the tissue sample has been completely separated from the main<br>
body of tissue being sampled.<br>
[0046]	Once the main piston assembly 200 has translated to its forward most (distal most)<br>
position, the clinch return spring-320 is compressed, pushing against the cutter clutch<br>
206, to keep the proximal end of the main piston's threads (204b) and the distal end of<br>
the journal's threads [306c) in constant contact with, sach other. The spring 320 provides<br>
a biasing force to cnsure the threads will engage and the main piston assembly 200 will<br>
retracl when the motor 304 is operafed in reverse,<br>
[0047] 	The end cap 514 can includs a Hall effect sensor. The Hall effect sensor in conjunction<br>
with magnet 108b associated with the receiver 408, can provide a signal when the sample<br>
tube is removed from the device, which signal can be used to turn the external vacuum<br>
though tube 406 on and off, or otherwise control the external vacuum source.<br>
[0048] 	The hollow needle 104 can be positioned into a tissus.mass, such as with the aid of any<br>
suitable imaging device. To begin operation of the biopsy device the assembly of the<br>
sample tube 406, magnet 408b. receiver 408. and vacuum line 410 can be inserted, into<br>
and releasably coupled to the floating piston 404 using the bosses 404a, Upon insertion<br>
of the receiver 408 through the end cap 514 the external vacuum source can be turned on<br>
via the Hall effect sensor 510 and the magnet 408b that is supported inside the receiver<br>
408,<br><br>

[0049]	 To activate the biopsy device, the physician can depress 506. Lever" 506 activates an<br>
electranaichanical momentary contact switch 508 to begin rotation of motor 304 and<br>
journal 306. Rotation of journal 306 draws main piston assembly 200 forward (distally)<br>
[0050]	 Referring to Figure 1 a, after the cutter 210 has advanced forward completely to sever a<br>
tissue; sample, vacuum can be applied from an external source through a vacuum tube 504<br>
and port 516b in lube 516 that communicates vacuum into a chamber 516 on the distal<br>
side of the floating piston 404. Vrcuom inchamber 5l6c pulls the. floating piston 404-<br>
forward, so that the distal end 406b of the sample tube 406 advances inside the cutter<br>
210. With the cutter 210 My advanced, the distal end of the sample tube 406 advances<br>
to the distal end of the needle lateral port 104c, thereby encapsulating the tissue sample<br>
with slight radial compression applied to the tissue sample, Once the tissue sample is<br>
encapsulated, the vacuum to line 504 can be turned off and atmospheric pressure can be<br>
provided to the distal face of the floating piston 404, so that the return spring 512 pushes<br>
the floating pislon assembly 400 back to the retracted position shown in figure la.<br>
[0051] 	The physician may then press the button 506, which activates the electromechanical<br>
switch 508 a second tints, causing the motor 304 to rotate in the opposite direction,<br>
thereby retracting the cutter 210.the clutch return spring 320 prasses the pistin<br>
assemhly 200 back onto the journal's threcadcd feature 306c. so that engagement is<br>
ensured, the journal 306 spitis in the opposite direction, causing the piston assembly 200<br>
to retract so the distal end 210b cutter 210 is positioned just proximal of the proximal<br>
end of the lareral needle port 104c, Accordingly, the full travel of the cutter 210 can be<br>
from just proximalof the port 104c to just distal of port 104c_<br>
[0052] 	To take.a second tissue sample, the user presses lever 506 to activate the<br>
electromechanical switch 508 ard provide motor 304 rotation in the Forward direction to<br>
rotate- and translate the cutter through the needle lateral port 104c, so.as to sever tissue<br>
drawn into port 104c by vacuum provided via luincn 104b. After the .cutter 210 has<br>
complctely scparrated a second tissue specimen vacuam pressure can again be applied<br><br>
WO2004/052212	PCT/US2003/039364<br>
-11-<br>
via port 516b to the distal face of the floating piston 404, so that piston 404 and sample<br>
tube 406 are advanced, with the disial end of tubs 405 advanced to the distal end of the<br>
needle lateral port 104c, The second tissue sample is encapsulated by the-sample tube<br>
406. As the second tissue sample enters the sample tube 406, the first tissue sample is<br>
displaced rearward into the sample tube 406 In this manner, multiple samples can be<br>
stacked within a sample tube 406 until the sample tube 406 contains s plurality of tissue<br>
specimens<br>
[0053]	 Figure 7 illustrates stocking of successive tissue samples 3100A-3100C in sample tube<br>
406. The sample tube inner diameter can be sized so that the cut tissue samples ant<br>
slightly compressed within the sample tube.<br>
[0054] 	When the tube 406 contains the desired number of severed lissus specimens, the user<br>
may reicase the sample tube 406 by rotaling the receiver 408a slighcly expose the wider<br>
portion of the slots 408a to allow the slots 408a to clear the retaining bosses 404a, When<br>
the receiver 408 is removed with the sample tube 406 attached, magnw 408b within the<br>
straw receiver 408 passes a Hall effect sensor 510 in end cap 514. which tan provide-a<br>
signal for use in larning off the extemal vacuum source communicating through vacuum<br>
line 410,<br>
[0055]	 In one embodiment, a tissue; retention feature in the wall of tube 406, such as rectangular<br>
notch 406a, is provided near the distal end of the sample tube 406. Notch 406a can allow<br>
the most reccntly acquired sample near the distal end of the sample tubs 406 to expand or<br>
bulgp slightly our, of opening provided by notch 406a the notch thereby aids in retaining<br>
the most recently obtained sample within sample lube 406. Additinally, vacuun applied<br>
to samples from vacuum line 410 through the sample tube 406 can apply a force to the<br>
distal end of the tissue sample, which can assist in balancing any axial vacuum force that<br>
may be applied to the tissue simples by vacuum provided through intelumen vacuum<br>
holes 104e. Other suitable tissue retention features. such as one or more indentations in<br>
the bibe wall could be employed to assist in retaming tissuc sample-<br><br>
WO2004/052212	PCT/US2003/039364<br>
-12 -<br>
[0056] 	To remove tissue samples from the sample tube 406 once the tube 406 has been removed<br>
from tube 516. the user may remove tube 406 from receiver 408. The user may then<br>
cover the rectangular notch 406a with a finger, compressing the sample back into the<br>
sample tube 406, while pushing a rod through the sample tube 406 to push the samples<br>
out of the tube. Once the sample has traveled past the rectangular notch 406a. the finger<br>
can be removed and the sample(s) can be pushed out of the tube. Alternatively, a satire<br>
filled syringe may be attached to one end of the sample tube 406; and saline may be used<br>
to push the samples out of the tube 406,<br>
[0057] 	Referring to figure 6, needle 104 can includc needle slot 104d between the upper cutter<br>
lumen 104a and lower vacuum lumen 104b, When vacuum is applied from the external<br>
vacuum source through the inlet port 108a (Figure 2) to the needle lower lomen 104b,<br>
vacuum is applied both through the proximal needle slit 104d and the lateral vacuum<br>
holes 104e. Staggered radial holes 210a (these holes can be circular, rectangular, or any<br>
other suitable shape) in the cutter 210 align with and communicate with the distal needle<br>
slot 104d as the distal end of the cutter 210 rotates and translates through the needle<br>
lateral port 104c. Therefore, vacuum is communicated to ths internal lumen of the cutter<br>
210 from the lower lumen 104b via the distal slit 104d and the staggered radial cutter<br>
holes 2l0a. In this way, during sampling, and even with tissue samples in tube 406.<br>
vacuum is applied both laterally to the tissue, through Inierlumen vacuum holts 104e as<br>
well as axially through cutter 210 via the distal needle slot l04d and cutter holes 2l0a to<br>
assist in maximizing tissue sample size. Vacuum provided by vacuum line 410 through<br>
sample lube 406 and then through cutter210 cat provide axial vacuum force for assisting<br>
m obtaining suitable samples- through porl 104c whan there are no previously severed<br>
samples in sample tube 406- Slot l04d and cutter holes 2l0a can be employed to provide<br>
axtal vacuum at the port 104c even if samples arc present in the samplt tube 406-<br>
[0058] 	Figure 8 shows an alteniative embodiment of sample tube 406 having an interual wall<br>
448 to provide a first sample lumen 462 and a second vacuum lumen 464, Each of lumen<br>
462 and 464 can bc in communiction with a source of vacuum such as that provided via<br><br>
WO2004/052212	PCT/US2003/039364<br>
-13-<br>
vacuum line 410. Vacuum lumen 464 can employed lo provide axial vacuum at port<br>
104c when samples are present in lumen 462 of Sample tube 406.<br>
