				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of cleaning an electronic filter during filtration<br>
and to an electric filter according to the features of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The emission system of an electric filter is formed of negatively charged emission<br>
electrodes and of separation electrodes in a zero position or of ground plates<br>
(the separation system, functioning as a positive pool). The gas to be purified of<br>
particles is fed through the emission system of the electric filter and the gas<br>
flows in the emission system between positively and negatively charged<br>
electrodes. Since a tension of approximately 100 kV typically exists between the<br>
positively and negatively charged electrodes, such a tension provides corona<br>
discharges between the electrodes. The corona discharges cause the particles,<br>
when they flow through such a corona discharge, to be mainly negatively<br>
charged and attached to the positively charged plates, whereas the positive<br>
particles are attached to the emission electrodes.<br>
Different electric filter applications are used for instance in power stations, pulp<br>
mills and in various metallurgical prpcesses, in which the electric filters tend to<br>
separate particles from the hot gases fed therethrough.<br>
It is previously known in electrical filters to shake the separation electrodes at<br>
regular intervals when the electric filter is being used, i.e.during filtration, in<br>
order to purify the separation electrodes of the particles attached thereto during<br>
filtration. The idea is that the particles removed by shaking fall to the lower part<br>
of the electric filter that is preferably but not necessarily provided with a bottom<br>
hopper.<br><br>
What becomes a problem is that when separation electrodes are shaken during<br>
filtration, some of the particles removed from the separation electrodes by<br>
shaking are conveyed from the electric filter, since a gas flow flows through the<br>
electric filter. Thus, what is known as "rapping loss" is created.<br>
One solution to the problem is to close the gas flow flowing through the electric<br>
filter completely when the separation electrodes of the electric filter are shaken,<br>
but this causes a break in filtration Another known solution to the problem is of<br>
the kind in which two electric filters are used in parallel and in which the gas flow<br>
is closed during shaking through the electric filter that is shaken.<br>
Publication US 3,988,130 discloses an electric filter that allows reducing the gas<br>
flow in gas channels adjoining the separation electrode to be shaken by shaking<br>
means when such a separation electrode to be shaken by the shaking means is<br>
shaken simultaneously allowing gas to flow through the other gas channels of<br>
the electric filter. Thus, the separation electrodes are allowed to be shaken while<br>
using the electric filter without having to stop the electric filter. In this solution,<br>
another gas flow is directed against the gas flow flowing in the gas channel so<br>
that the gas flow substantially stops in the gas channel concerned. When the<br>
separation electrode adjoining the gas channel is shaken, the particles removed<br>
from the separation electrode may fall freely for instance to the bottom hopper<br>
at the bottom of the electric filter. A problem associated with this prior art<br>
solution is that a fairly complicated and space-requiring solution is required to<br>
direct a second gas flow against the gas flow flowing in the gas channel.<br><br>
Publication JP8187450 discloses another electric filter that allows reducing the<br>
gas flow in gas channels adjoining a separation electrode to be shaken by a<br>
shaking means when such a separation electrode to be shaken by the shaking<br>
means is shaken simultaneously allowing gas to flow through the other gas<br>
channels of the electric filter. This prior art solution comprises a moving-type<br>
curtain that can be moved in front of the up-flow end of the gas intervals, thus<br>
preventing the gas flow out of the gas channel. When the separation electrode<br>
adjoining the gas channel is shaken, the particles removed from the separation<br>
electrodes may freely fall for instance to a bottom hopper at the bottom of the<br>
electric filter. A problem in this solution is to move the moving-type curtain<br>
reliably in dirty conditions in the electric filter.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a new method of cleaning an electric<br>
filter during filtration and an electric filter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the invention, a gas flow flowing through an electric filter is limited during<br>
shaking in the part of the electric filter in which a separation electrode to be<br>
shaken is located so that the velocity of the gas flow flowing through the electric<br>
filter in said part is reduced or is more preferably as close as possible to zero, is<br>
most preferably zero. To be more precise, the gas flow is at least partly limited<br>
or substantially completely closed in the gas channel adjoining the separation<br>
electrode to be shaken when the separation electrode is shaken. In the solution<br>
according to the invention this is carried out simultaneously as gas is allowed to<br>
flow through the electric filter in other parts of the electric filter. In other words,<br>
gas is allowed to flow freely through other gas channels. The solution according<br>
to the invention allows a particle layer removed by shaking from the separation<br>
electrodes to fall as freely as possible to the lowe part of the electric filter<br>
without stopping the filter.<br><br>
In this invention the gas flow is limited in the gas channel adjoining the<br>
separation electrode to be shaken by moving a first perforated plate arranged in<br>
the gas channel in relation to a second perforated plate arranged in the same<br>
gas channel as the first perforated plate. The first perforated plate is provided<br>
with first apertures and the second perforated plate is provided with second<br>
apertures. The first perforated plate is moved in relation to the second<br>
perforated plate into a closed position so that the second perforated plate covers<br>
at least partly at least one of the first apertures provided in the first perforated<br>
plate and thus limits the gas flow through the first aperture, and so that the first<br>
perforated plate covers at least partly at least one of the second apertures in the<br>
second perforated plate and thus limits the gas flow through the first apeture.<br>
Alternatively the first perforated plate and the second perforated plate may be<br>
such that when moving the first perforated plate in relation to the second<br>
perforated plate into a closed position, the second perforated plate covers all the<br>
first apertures in the first perforated plate and thus prevents the gas flow<br>
through the first apertures, and the first perforated plate correspondingly covers<br>
all the second apertures in the second perforated plate and thus prevents the<br>
gas flow through the second apertures. In this embodiment the first perforated<br>
plate and the second perforated plate preferably form a closed plate wall that<br>
prevents gas flow.<br>
The first perforated plate and the second perforated plate form in an open<br>
position, i.e. in a state in which gas may flow through the first<br><br>
apertures in the first perforated plate and through the second apertures in the<br>
second perforated plate, preferably but not necessarily, a gas distribution cur-<br>
tain providing a pressure loss that balances the gas flow. The first perforated<br>
plate and the second perforated, plate forming the gas distribution curtain are<br>
preferably but not necessarily arranged at the end of the gas channel from<br>
which gas is removed from the gas channel while gas flows through the gas<br>
channel.<br><br>
 The method and electric fiiter according to the invention pro-<br>
vide such an advantage that a small or insignificant rapping loss is achieved. In<br>
other words, only a small amount of particles or no particles separated from<br>
the separation electrodes by shaking are conveyed with the gas flow out of the<br>
electric filter.<br>
The closing means solution according to the invention pro-<br>
vides such an advantage that it takes up very little space in the electric filter.<br>
This is particularly advantageous if an electric filter in use is provided with such<br>
a closing means solution. The first perforated plate as well as the second per-<br>
forated plate can be made very thin. The first perforated plate and the second<br>
perforated plate are preferably but not necessarily arranged in the gas channel<br>
successively and fastened to one another in the gas flow direction, and there-<br>
fore require very little space while moving in relation to one another. In addi-<br>
tion, the means for moving the first perforated plate in relation to the second<br>
perforated plate can be made very compact.<br>
 In the solution according to the invention the gas flow is lim-<br>
ited at least partly or the gas flow is closed substantially completely, preferably<br>
but not necessarily, in the gas channel on both sides of the separation elec-<br>
trode to be shaken.<br>
 In accordance with the invention, the gas flow is timed at<br>
least partlyin the gas channel adjoining the separation electrode to be shaken<br>
by moving the first perforated plate arranged in the gas channel in relation to<br>
the second perforated plate arranged in the same gas channel so that the first<br>
perforated plate covers at least partly at least one of the second apertures in<br>
the second perforated plate and thus at least partly prevents the gas flow<br>
through the second aperture, or so that the second perforated plate covers at<br>
least one of the first apertures in the first perforated plate and thus at least<br>
partly prevents the gas flow through the first aperture.<br><br>
Each gas channel adjoining the separation electrode to be shaken by the shaking<br>
means is preferably but not necessarily provided with closing means so that in<br>
the gas channel the velocity of the gas flow can be reduced or more preferably is<br>
as close as possible to zero, or is most preferably zero when the separation<br>
electrode adjoining the gas channel is shaken. At least one set of closing means,<br>
more preferably but not necessarily all closing means comprise a first perforated<br>
plate and a second perforated plate.<br>
A preferred embodiment is provided with an ordering means arranged to close<br>
the closing means in a certain predetermined order.<br>
A preferred embodiment is provided with a synchoronizing means arranged to<br>
co-ordinate the operation of the shaking means and preferably but not<br>
necessarily such that the closing means at first limit at least partly the gas flow<br>
or close the gas flow substantially completely in the gas channel and thereafter<br>
shakes the separation electrode adjoining the gas channel by the shaking means.<br>
A preferred embodiment is provided with both an ordering means arranged to<br>
act on the closing means in such a manner that the gas flow is at least partly<br>
limited or is completely prevented in the gas channel in a certain predetermined<br>
order and a synchronizing means that functionally combines the ordering means<br>
and the shaking means or the closing means and the shaking means, the<br>
shaking means thus performing the shaking of a particular separation electrode<br>
when the gas flow in the gas channel adjoining the particular separation<br>
electrode is at least partly limited or substantially completely prevented.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the following, the invention will be explained in greater detail by means of the<br>
preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic side view in cross-section showing an electric filter, and<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic view showing an upper part of closing means.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention primarily relates to a method of purifying an electric filter during<br>
filtration. In other words the invention primarily relates to a<br><br><br>
method of purifying separation electrodes 1 in the electric filter of particles (not<br>
shown) attached thereto during filtration. The purification is carried out by<br>
shaking the separation electrodes 1 while the gas (not shown) to be purified of<br>
particles flows into a chamber 2 of the electric filter, particles are removed by<br>
means of an emission system 3 provided in the chamber 2 of the electric filter<br>
and the gas (not shown) purified of particles is removed from the chamber 2 of<br>
the electric filter.<br>
 In this method gas containing particles is fed to the chamber<br>
2 of the electric filter by feeding [means 4. The gas containing particles is fed<br>
further to gas channels in the emission system 3 provided in the chamber 2,<br>
the gas channels being formed between two separation electrodes 1 in the<br>
emission system 3 provided in the chamber 2 and including at least one elec-<br>
trically charged emission electrode 6. What is achieved is electric charging of<br>
the particles in the gas channels 5 and attachment to the separation electrodes<br>
1 and then the gas at least partly purified of particles is removed from the gas<br>
channels 5 of the emission system 3. Gas that is at least partly purified of par-<br>
ticles is removed from the chamber 2 of the electric filter through exhaust<br>
means 7. <br>
 It is possible that the emission electrode 6 is for instance a<br>
plate-like emission electrode 6 that divides a single gas channel 5 between two<br>
separation electrodes 1 into two gas channels 5.<br>
 In this method, the separation electrode 1 is shaken by shak-<br>
ing means'8 for removing particles attached to the separation electrode 1 from<br>
the separation electrode 1. The shaking means 8 may preferably but not nec-<br>
essarily be provided with the structure described in publication EP 0 833 693<br>
B1.<br>
 The gas flow is limited in this method by closing means 9 at<br>
least partly in such a gas channel 5, which adjoins the separation electrode 1<br>
to be shaken by the shaking means 8 when such a separation electrode 1 to<br>
be shaken by the shaking means 8 and adjoined to the gas channel 5 is<br>
shaken. In the method according to the invention, this is carried out simultane-<br>
ously as gas to be purified of particles is fed to at feast one other gas channel<br>
5, the electric charging of the particles in the gas is achieved in said at least<br>
one other gas channel 5 as well as the attachment of the particles to such<br>
-separation electrodes 1 adjoined to said at least one other gas channel 5, and<br><br>
gas that is at least partly purified of particles is removed from said one other<br>
gas channel 5.<br>
 More precisely; the gas flow is limited in this method by the<br>
closing means 9 comprising a first perforated plate 10 and a second perforated<br>
plate 12 by moving the first perforated plate 10 arranged in the gas channel-5<br>
and provided with first apertures. 11 in relation to the second perforated plate<br>
12 arranged in the same gas channel 5 as the first perforated plate 10 and pro-<br>
vided with second apertures 13 so that the second perforated plate 12 at least<br>
partly covers at least one of the first apertures 11 in the first perforated plate<br>
and thus limits the gas flow through the first aperture 11, or so that the first per-<br>
forated plate 10 at least partly covers at least one of the second apertures 13<br>
in the second perforated plate 12 and thus limits the gas flow through the sec-<br>
ond aperture13.<br>
 Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is limited by the<br>
closing means 9 in the gas channel 5 on both sides of the separation electrode<br>
1 to be shaken at least partly by the shaking means 8 when such a separation<br>
electrode 1 to be shaken by the shaking means 8 is shaken by the shaking<br>
means 8.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is limited in the<br>
gas channel 5 by limiting the gas flow into the gas channel 5.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is limited in the<br>
gas channel 5 by limiting the gas flow out of the gas channel 5. The Figure<br>
shows an arrangement that is applicable to this embodiment.<br>
preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is limited in the<br>
gas channel 5 by limiting the gas flow into the gas channel 5 and out of the gas<br>
channel 5.<br>
preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is limited in the<br>
gas channel 5 before the separation electrode 1 is shaken.<br>
preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is opened in the<br>
gas channel 5 some time after the separation electrode 1 has been shaken.<br>
preferably but hot necessarily the gas flow is closed substan-<br>
tially completely by the closing means 9 in such a gas channel 5 which adjoins<br>
the separation electrode 1 to be shaken by the shaking means 8 when the<br>
separation code 1 adjoined to the gas channel 5 and to be shaken by the<br>
shaking means is shaken. In the method according to the invention, this is car-<br>
ried out simultaneously as the gas to be purified of particles is fed to at least<br><br>
one other gas channel 5 and electric charging of the particles in the gas is<br>
achieved in at least one other gas channel 5 as well as the attachment of the<br>
particles to such separation electrodes 1, which are adjoined to the at least<br>
one other gas channel 5, and gas at least partly purified of particles is removed<br>
from said one other gas channel5.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is limited by the<br>
closing means 9 comprising the first perforated plate 10 and the second perfo-<br>
rated plate 12 by moving the first perforated plate 10 arranged in the gas<br>
channel 5 and provided with the first apertures 11 in relation to the second per-<br>
forated plate 12 arranged in the same gas channel 5 as the first perforated<br>
plate 10 and provided with the second apertures 13 in such a manner that the<br>
second perforated plate 12 covers all the first apertures 11 in the first perfo-<br>
rated plate 10 and thus prevents the gas flow through the first apertures 11, or<br>
in such a manner that the first perforated plate 10 covers all the second aper-<br>
tures 13 in the second perforated plate 12 and thus prevents the gas flow<br>
through the second apertures 13.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is closed substan-<br>
tially completely in the gas channel 5 on both sides of the separation electrode<br>
1 to be shaken by the shaking means 8 when such a separation electrode 1 to<br>
be shaken by the shaking means 8 is shaken.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is closed substan-<br>
tially completely in the gas channel 5 by preventing the gas from flowing into<br>
the gas channel 5.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is closed substan-<br>
tially completely in the gas channel 5 by preventing the gas from flowing out of<br>
the gas channel 5.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is closed substan-<br>
tially completely in the gas channel 5 by preventing the gas from flowing into<br>
the gas channel 5 and preventing the gas from flowing out of the gas channel<br>
5.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is closed substan-<br>
tially completely in the gas channel 5 before the separation electrode 1 is<br>
shaken.	<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow is opened in the<br>
gas channel 5 some time after the; separation electrode 1 has been shaken.<br><br>
It is obvious for those skilled in the art that the emission elec-<br>
trode 6 can also if necessary be shaken and that with a corresponding method<br>
the gas'flow can be limited in the gas channel 5 adjoining the emission elec-<br>
trode 6 to be shaken or closed substantially completely.<br>
The invention also relates to an electric filter comprising, a<br>
chamber 2 including feeding means 4 for feeding gas to be purified of particles<br>
to the chamber 2, the chamber 2 including an emission system 3 comprising<br>
several separation electrodes 1 forming gas channels 5 between them, the gas<br>
channels 5 being provided with emission electrodes 6 that can be electrically<br>
charged, and the chamber 2 including exhaust means 7 for feeding gas puri-<br>
fied of particles from the chamber 2.<br>
In the Figure the separation electrodes 1 are substantially<br>
rectangular metal plates.<br>
It is possible that at least one emission electrode 6 in at least<br>
one gas channel 5 is provided with such a structure that divides the gas chan-<br>
nel 5 between the separation electrode 1 into two gas channels 5. It is possible<br>
for instance that the structure includes such emission electrodes 6, which are<br>
substantially rectangular metal plates.<br>
The electric filter also comprises shaking means 8 for shak-<br>

cles can be fed to at least one other gas channel 5 and gas that is at least<br>
partly purified of particles can be removed from the at least one gas channel 5.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow can at least partly<br>
be limited/by the closing means 9 in the gas channel 5 on both sides of the<br>
separation electrode 1 to be shaken by the shaking means 8.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow can be limited by<br>
the closing means 9 into the gas channel 5.<br>

the closing means 9 out of the gas channel 5.<br>
Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow can be limited by<br>
the closing means 9 into the gas channel 5 and out of the gas channel 5.<br><br>
 Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow can be substan-<br>
tially completely closed by the closing means 9 in such a gas channel 5, which<br>
adjoins the separation electrode 1 to be shaken by the shaking means 8 simul-<br>

channel 5 can be substantially completely closed by the closing means 9.<br>
 Preferably but not necessarily the gas flow into the gas<br>
channel 5 and out of the gas channel 5 can be substantially completely closed<br>
by the closing means 9.<br>
 In the Figures the closing means 9 comprise a first perfo-<br>
rated platen 0 arranged in the gas channel 5 and provided with first apertures<br>
11. In the Figures the closing means 9 also comprise a second perforated<br>
plate 12 arranged in the same gas channel 5 as the first perforated plate 10<br>
and provided with second apertures 13.<br>
 The first perforated plate 10 can be moved in relation to the<br>

9	on the right comprising the first perforated plate 10 and the second perfo-<br>
rated plate 12 is in the open position.<br>
 The first perforated plate 10 can also be moved in relation to:<br>
the second perforated plate 12 into a closed position, in which the second per-<br>
forated plate 12 at least partly covers at least one of the first apertures 11 in<br>
the first perforated plate 10 and thus at least partly limits the gas flow through<br>
the first aperture 11, and in which the first perforated plate 10 at least partly<br>
covers at least one of the second apertures 13 in the second perforated plate<br>
12 and thus at least partly limits the gas flow through the second aperture 13.<br>
 More preferably but not necessarily the first perforated plate<br>
10	can be moved in relation to the second perforated plate 12 to such a closed<br><br>
position, in which the second perforated plate 12 covers all the first apertures<br>
11 in the first perforated plate 1.0 and thus prevents the gas flow through the<br>
first apertures 11 and in which the first perforated plate 10 correspondingly<br>
covers all the second apertures 13 in the second perforated plate 12 and thus<br>
prevents the gas flow through the second apertures 13. In Figure 2 the closing<br>
means 9 on the left comprising the first perforated plate 10 and the second<br>
perforated plate 12 is in such a closed position.<br>
The separation system of the electric filter shown in the Fig-<br>
ures comprises several gas channels-5 and each gas channel is provided with<br>
the closing means 9 comprising the first perforated plate 10 and the second<br>
perforated plate 12.<br>
 Alternatively the closing means 9 may comprise another type<br>
of arrangement to at least partly limit the gas flow or to close it substantially<br>
completely in the gas channel 5. Examples of such arrangements include ro-<br>
tatable doors, butterfly valves or the like.<br>
 The electric filter preferably comprises an ordering means 14<br>
arranged to activate the closing means 9 in the gas channels 5 in a certain pre-<br>
determined order so that the gas flow is at least partly limited or is substantially<br>
completely closed in the gas channels 5 in a certain predetermined order.<br>
 The ordering means 14 referred to in the Figures comprises<br>
a camshaffi. The camshaft 15 is provided with cams 16 arranged to act on<br>
the first perforated plates 10 in such a manner that the first perforated plates<br>
10 move in a certain predetermined order in relation to the second perforated<br>
plates 12 between the open position and the closed position.<br>
 The camshaft 15 extends above the closing means 9 com-<br>
prising the first perforated plate 10 and the second perforated plate 12 and<br>
comprises cams 16, which rotate with the camshaft about the longitudinal axis<br>
thereof while the camshaft rotates about the longitudinal axis (not indicated<br>
with a reference numeral) thereof.<br>
 The cams 16 of the camshaft 15 are arranged to lift in a cer-<br>
tain predetermined order either<br>
(i) one first perforated plate 10 in one gas channel 5 so that the gas<br>
flow through the first apertures 11 in the first perforated plate 10 and the sec-<br>
ond apertures 13 in the second perforated plate 12 is at least partly limited or<br>
substantially completely prevented in the gas channel 5 moving on one side of<br>
the separation electrode 1, or<br><br>
(ii) two first perforated plates 10 in two adjacent gas channels 5 ad-<br>
joining the same separation electrode 1 so that the gas flow through the first<br>
apertures 11 in the first perforated plate 10 and the second apertures 13 in the<br>
second perforated plate 12 is at least partly limited or substantially completely<br>
prevented in the gas channel 5 on both sides of the separation electrode 1.<br>
 Alternative (i) is applicable to be used for instance on the<br>
borders of the emission system,.in which a gas channel 5 typically moves only<br>
on one side of the separation electrode 1. Cf. for instance the outermost gas<br>
channels in Figure 2.<br>
 In the Figures the first perforated plates 10 are functionally<br>
connectedio the cams by means of arm arrangements 17 fastened to the first<br>
perforated plates 10.<br>
In the arrangement shown in the Figures, the first perforated<br>
plates 10 are arranged to return into the open position by means of gravity.<br>
When falling down, the first perforated plate 10 is preferably but not necessar-<br>
ily arranged to be shaken and thus to be purified of particles.<br>
 Alternatively the camshaft 15 may be replaced by another ar-<br>
rangemen which is in a certain predetermined order arranged to lift one first<br>
perforated plate 10 so that the gas flow through the first apertures 11 in the<br>
first perforated plate 10 and the second apertures 13 in the second perforated<br>
plate 12 is at least partly limited or substantially completely prevented in such a<br>
gas channel which adjoins the separation electrode to be shaken by the shak-<br>
ing means.<br>
 The electric filter preferably comprises a synchronizing<br>
means (not shown) arranged to co-ordinate the function of the closing means 9<br>
and the shaking means 8.<br>
 The synchronizing means may be a mechanical device that<br>
connects the closing means 9 to the shaking means 8. Alternatively the syn.-<br>
chronizing means may be a device that sends for instance a signal from the<br>
closing means 9 to the shaking means 8 about the fact that the closing means<br>
9 have at least partly or completely closed the gas channel 5 and that the<br>
shaking means 8 are able to shake the separation electrode 1 adjoining the<br>
gas channel 5.<br>
 The synchronizing means is preferably but not necessarily<br>
arranged to activate the shaking means 8 not until the closing means 9 has at<br><br>
least partly limited or substantially completely closed the gas flow in the gas<br>
channel 5.<br>
 The synchronizing means is preferably but not necessarily<br>
arranged to open the closing means 9 some time after the separation electrode<br>
1 has been shaken.<br>
 is obvious for those skilled in the art that the electric filter<br>
may also comprise an arrangement for shaking at least one emission electrode<br>
6 and a corresponding arrangement for limiting or closing the gas flow in the<br>
gas channel 5 adjoining the emission electpode 6.<br>
 is obvious for those skilled in the art that as technology ad-<br>
vances the basic idea of the invention can be implemented in various ways.<br>
The invention and the preferred; embodiments thereof are therefore not re-<br>
stricted to the above examples but they may vary within the scope of the<br>
claims.<br><br><br>
