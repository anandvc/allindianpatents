				<td>The present invention relates to a filtration and electrostatic precipitation device for the collection of particulates.<br>
PROBLEMS IN THE ART<br>
In facilities such as power plants or factories, the facilities may produce particulate air pollutants which may consist of solid material entrained in a gaseous medium, liquid particles, fine fume-type particles, various types of smoke, nuisance dust, or any type of suspended solid material which is not easily separated from the gaseous medium by gravitational force. Similarly, in industries such as food industries, pharmaceutical industries, or chemical industries may produce very fine powders which must by collected. Such dust may originate from a variety of sources including the combustion or thermal processing of fuels or waste materials, chemical processing, food processing, cement kilns, or powder handling, for example.<br>
One prior art method of reducing the particulate air pollutants involves the use of a conventional pulse-jet baghouse. A typical pulse-jet baghouse includes a number of individual bags or filtration tubes which are four to six inches in diameter, eight to twenty feet long, and are mounted within and suspended from a tube sheet. The particulate dust is collected on the outside surfaces of the bags while the flue gas passes through the bag fabric to the inside, where it exits through the top of the bags into a clean air plenum and subsequently out the stack. Cages are installed inside the bags to prevent them from collapsing during the normal filtration process. To clean the bags, air nozzles are installed above each bag. By applying a quick burst of high pressure air directed inside the bags, the bags are cleaned. This burst of air causes a rapid expansion of the bag and momentarily reverses the direction of gas flow through the bag, which helps to clean the dust off the bags. In a typical prior art baghouse, the bags are oriented in a rectangular array spaced a few inches apart. The bags are usually cleaned with the burst of air one row at a time in sequence, with approximately fifteen bags per row. As a result of the small bag spacing and forward filtration through the two rows of bags adjacent to the row being cleaned,<br>
much of the dust that is removed from one row of bags is simply recollected on the adjacent rows of bags. As a result, only the very large agglomerates of dust reach the hopper after supplying the burst of air through the bags. This phenomenon of redisbursion and collection of dust after bag cleaning is a major obstacle to operating prior art baghouses at higher filtration velocities, also known as air-to-cloth (A/C) ratio.<br>
One prior art method of controlling particulate air pollutants is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,904,283 issued to Hovis et al. on Feb. 27, 1990. This prior art method integrates filtration and electrostatic precipitation in one step. A high voltage electrode is installed in the center of the filter bags, with the grounded electrodes woven into the bags. One major problem with this method is that there is no effective way of transferring the collected dust from the bags to the hopper without reentrainment and recollection.<br>
Another prior art method of controlling particulate air pollutants is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,511 issued to Plaks et al. on Jun. 8, 1993. This method involves the placement of high voltage electrodes between pulse-jet-cleaned bags. Again, a major disadvantage of this method is that there is no effective way to transfer the dust from the bags to the hopper without reentrainment and recollection.<br>
Another prior art method of controlling particulate air pollutants is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,024,681 and 5,158,580 issued to Chang on Jun. 18, 1991 and Oct. 27, 1992. This prior art method uses a high ratio fabric filter installed downstream from an electrostatic precipitator and includes the option of installing a separate precharger section between the precipitator and fabric filter. Again, there is no effective way for removing the dust from the bags without reentrainment and recollection.<br>
Another prior art method of controlling particulate air pollutants is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,357,151 issued to Helfritch et al. on Nov. 2, 1982. This prior art method discloses a particulate collection method which uses electrostatic collection and filtration combined into the same housing in<br>
which high voltage electrodes are spaced between cylindrical perforated grounded surfaces as a filter outer shell and a pleated filter medium inside the cylindrical shell. This method has similar disadvantages.<br>
Therefore, a need can be seen for an apparatus and method for effectively and efficiently controlling particulate air pollutants.<br>

A further feature of the present invention is the provision of a method and apparatus for controlling particulate air pollutants using the combination of a filter element and an electrostatic precipitation zone which overcomes problems found in the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention will be described as it applies to its preferred embodiment. It is not intended that the present invention be limited to the<br>
described embodiment. It is intended that the invention cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalencies which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an advanced hybrid particulate collector (AHPC) of the present invention. An AHPC vessel 10 includes a pair of side walls 12 and a pair of end walls 14 which together form a chamber. Disposed below the side walls 12 and end walls 14 is a hopper 16 which, as is described below, collects particulates. Located on each end wall 14 is an inlet duct 18 which serves as a flue gas inlet or dirty air inlet for the AHPC vessel 10. Located on the upper portion of the AHPC vessel 10 is a clean gas plenum 20 which is connected to outlet ducting 22 which serves as a flue gas outlet. In operation, polluted flue gas is introduced into the AHPC vessel 10 through the inlet ducts 18 and cleaned gas is removed via the outlet ducting 22. The particulate air pollutants removed from the flue gas are eventually collected in the hopper 16.<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the AHPC vessel 10 with the top and bottom surfaces of the clean gas plenum 20 removed to reveal the inside of the chamber. Similarly, FIG. 3 shows the AHPC vessel 10 with the clean gas plenum 20, one of the inlet ducts 18, the outlet duct 22, and one of the side and end walls 12 and 14 removed.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, a plurality of filter bags 24 are arranged in rows within the AHPC vessel 10. The filter bags 24 are preferably comprised of elongated cylindrical bags disposed around a wire cage (not shown). The upper end of the filter bags 24 are open and are in communication with the clean gas plenum 20 (via a tube sheet). The bags 24 are sealed at their lower ends. The bottom end of the filter bags 24 are closed. When gas is introduced into the AHPC vessel 10 via the inlet ducting 18, the gas flows through the bags 24 into the clean air plenum 20. In this way, the gas introduced into the AHPC vessel 10 must flow through the filter bags 24 before leaving the AHPC vessel 10. In the preferred embodiment, the flow of<br>
gases through the AHPC vessel 10 flows at a filtration velocity in the range of 8 to 24 feet per minute.<br>
Between each row of filter bags 24 is a grounded plate 26. Between each row of filter bags 24 and each adjacent grounded plate 26 is an electrode grid 28. Each of the electrode grids 28 is insulated from the AHPC vessel 10 by the insulators 30. Each electrode grid 28, along with its adjacent grounded plate 26, form an electrostatic precipitation (ESP) zone 32. An ESP zone 32 is therefore formed on each side of each row of filter bags 24. In this way, as is described below, when gas containing particulates passes through the ESP zones 32, the particulates are collected on the grounded plates 26. The bags 24, electrode grids 28, and grounded plates 26 are preferably spaced apart such that the electrode grids 28 are closer to the grounded plates 26 than they are to the bags 24. In one embodiment, the distance from each bag 24 to the adjacent electrode grid 28 is in the range of 51% to 80% of the total distance from the bag 24 to the adjacent grounded plate 26. Also shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 are a plurality of baffles 34 which serve to direct the gas from the inlet ducts 18 into the ESP zones 32.<br>
FIG. 5 is a top schematic view of the AHPC vessel 10 illustrating the layout of the filter bags 24, the ESP zones 32, and the baffling. The arrows shown in FIG. 5 illustrate the direction of the flow of gas through the AHPC vessel 10. As shown, the gas is introduced into the chamber where it is directed into the ESP zones 32 by the baffles 34. The gas then flows through the filter bags 24, into the clean gas plenum 20, and out through the outlet ducting 22 (described below).<br>
FIGS. 6-8 are enlarged sectional views of one row of filter bags. FIGS. 6-8 illustrate the operation of the present invention in detail.<br>
To completely understand the operation of the present invention, it is helpful to look at the housing of the AHPC vessel 10 as being divided into five zones which are in continuous fluid contact. Zone 1 is comprised of the inlet ducting and baffling whose purpose is introducing the dirty gas to the<br>
collection zones. Zone 2 is the electrostatic collection area and consists of the plurality of high voltage electrodes, or electrode grids 28, and grounded collection plates 26. Zone 3 is the filtration area and consists of the plurality of filter elements, or filter bags 24. Zone 4 is the dust collection hopper 16 located below Zones 2 and 3. Zone 5 is the clean plenum area above Zones 2 and 3 and includes bag cleaning blowback pipes and nozzles 44, a plenum area to access the bags 24, and outlet ducting 22 to pass the cleaned gas to the fan and discharge stack (not shown).<br>
FIG. 6 shows the normal particulate collection mode of the present invention. As was mentioned above, dirty gas is introduced into the AHPC vessel 10 by the inlet ducting 18 (Zone 1). The air baffles 34 cause the gas to flow into the ESP zones 32, which are located between the electrode grids 28 and the grounded plates 26 (FIG. 5). The baffles 34 cause the gas to flow in a turbulent manner as is illustrated by the arrows 36. As a result of the electric field produced by the electrode grid 28 and the grounded plates 26, the particulates in the ESP zone immediately become charged and migrate toward the grounded plate 26 at a velocity (migration velocity) dependent upon the particle charge and the electric field strength. Since all of the gas flow must eventually pass from Zone 2 into Zone 3 and through the bags 24, there is a velocity component perpendicular to the plates that passes the wires, or electrode grid 28. Since migration velocity of particles moving toward the plates 26 will be greater than the gas velocity component moving toward the bags 24, most of the particles will collect on the plates 26 rather than be carried past the electrode grid 28 to the bags 24. Under ideal laminar flow conditions, only particles with migration velocities smaller than the gas velocity toward the bags 24 would reach the bags 24 during normal filtration. However, because of some flow maldistribution and the presence of turbulent flow, a small fraction of the dust (less than 10%) might reach the bags 24 during normal collection operation. However, collection of the particles that do reach the filtration surface of the bags 24 is enhanced as a result of the particle charging. Charged particles are more readily collected because there is an additional coulomb force to drive the particles to a grounded or neutral surface. In addition, a dust cake formed from the charged particles will become porous, which produces a lower pressure<br>
drop. Ultra high fine-particle collection is achieved by removing over 90% of the dust before it reaches the fabric, precharging the particles, and using appropriate membrane and fabric to collect particles that do not reach the filtration surface with a high efficiency. After flowing through the bags 24, the gas flows upward into the clean air plenum 20 as is illustrated by the arrows 42. As a result, the gas entering the clean air plenum 20 is very clean. The clean gas is then sent to the stack via the outlet ducting 22 (FIG. 1).<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates the bag cleaning process. Since the dust accumulates on the grounded plates 26 and filter bags 24, it must be periodically removed and transferred from Zones 2 and 3 to the hopper 16, or Zone 4. Located above each filter bag 24 is a pulse nozzle 44 which is capable of directing a pulse of air down through the filter bags 24. One row of the bags 24 at a time is cleaned with a reverse pulse of pressurized air or gas from the pulse nozzles 44. The pulse has sufficient energy to dislodge most of the dust from the bags 24. Larger agglomerates fall to the hopper 16 and are transferred directly from Zone 3 to Zone 4. However, much of the dust is reentrained into particles too small to fall directly to the hopper. While these are small particles, they were agglomerated into much larger particles than are originally collected on the bags. As discussed above, in conventional baghouses these particles would immediately recollect on the bags 24. With the present invention, the bags 24 are pulsed with sufficient energy and volume to propel the reentrained dust past the high voltage wires and back into Zone 2, the ESP zone, where they immediately become charged and are trapped on the plates 26. Since these reentrained particles are much larger than those originally collected on the bags, they are trapped in the ESP zone much more easily than the original fine particles.<br>
To improve the cleaning process, the present invention may utilize a two-tiered cleaning pulse. A first, high-pressure short-duration pulse is followed by a second, lower-pressure longer duration pulse. Preferably, the first pulse is in the range of 15 to 150 psig, with a duration in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 seconds. The second pulse is in the range of 1 to 15 psig, with a duration in<br>
the range of 0.5 to 10 seconds. Conversely, the first pulse is in the range of 1 to 15 psig, with a duration in the range of 0.5 to 10 seconds. The second pulse then is in the range of 15 to 150 psig, with a duration in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 seconds. Of course, the present invention may use a single pulse, or more than two pulses.<br>
Preferably, the plates 26 are cleaned near the end of the bag cleaning process with the electric field shut off for 0.1 to 8 seconds to release the dust from the plates 26. In another embodiment, the polarity of the electric field is reversed during the bag cleaning and plate rapping steps.<br>
The alternative rows of bags 24, electrode grids 28, and plates 26 act as an "electronic curtain" to prevent the reentrained dust from being collected on the same bags 24. The plates 26 prevent the dust from being recollected on adjacent rows of bags 24.<br>
Periodically, the dust layers 38 must be cleaned from the grounded plates 26. FIG. 8 illustrates a plate rapping process which removes the dust and particulates from the grounded plates 26, or transfers the dust from Zone 2 to the hopper 16, or Zone 4. With the high voltage disconnected from the electrode grid 28, the grounded grids 26 are rapped or vibrated to dislodge large agglomerates which then fall in the hopper 16. A fraction of the dust is reentrained as particles too small to reach the hopper 16. Most of the reentrained particles are recollected on the plates 26. Any remaining fine dust, reentrained as a result of rapping, that penetrates the ESP Zone 32 will be collected at an ultrahigh collection efficiency by the filter bags 24. Plate cleaning may also be accomplished without disconnecting the high voltage.<br>
FIG. 9 shows an alternative embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9 shows an AHPC vessel 10A which is substantially the same as the AHPC vessel 10 shown in FIG. 1 except for the differences illustrated below. In the AHPC vessel 10A, the dirty flue gas is introduced from below the rows of filter bags 24 rather than from the sides. As shown in FIG. 9, a flue gas inlet<br>
ducting I8A is located below the chamber of the AHPC vessel 10A so that the dirty flue gas is introduced below the rows of filter bags 24 and ESP zones 32. The flue gas must pass upward into the channels defined by adjacent grounded plates in order to reach the filter bags 24. The outlet ducting 22A and clean gas plenum 20A are the same as that shown in FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 10 shows another alternative form of the present invention. FIG. 10 shows an AHPC vessel 10B which is substantially the same as the AHPC vessel 10 as shown in FIG. 1 except that the ESP zones 32B extend downward farther than the bags 24B. The purpose of this alternative embodiment is to capture a larger portion of the dust before it reaches the filter bags 24. This difference is best illustrated by comparing FIG. 10 with FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 11 shows another alternative embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 11 is a diagram similar to FIG. 5 except that the ESP zones 32C extend horizontally beyond the rows of filter bags 24C. In this way, the gas introduced by the inlet ducting 18C must pass through extend ESP zones 32 before reaching the filter elements or filter bags 24C. With this embodiment, the flue gas must pass through an extended electrostatic zone 32B before it reaches the bag area. The purpose of this embodiment is to ensure the capture of a larger portion of the dust before it reaches the filter bags 24. A difference in this embodiment is illustrated best by comparing FIG. 11 with FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 12 is another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment shown in FIG. 12 is substantially the same as the embodiment shown in FIG. 5 except that the ESP zones 32D form a zigzag pattern. As shown, the grounded plates 26D and electrode grids 28D comprise a plurality of straight segments arranged as shown. Alternatively, the grounded plates 26D and/or electrode grids 28D could be curved or form patterns other than the zigzag pattern show.<br>
For the best results, the filter bags 24 of the present invention should be comprised of a sophisticated fabric which can achieve ultra high collection efficiency and can also endue frequent high energy pulsing. In addition, the selected fabric should be reliable under the most severe chemical environment likely to be encountered (for example, high SO3). The filter bags 24 are preferably comprised of Gore-Tex® membrane on Gore-Tex® felt consisting of a microporous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane laminated to a felted or fabric backing material such as that manufactured by W.L. Gore and Associates, Inc. Another alternative filter element comprises the use of a filter cartridge which could be comprised of both paper or fabric. The preferred filter cartridge is comprised of a cartridge known as the Gore-Tex® light pulse filter cartridge manufactured by W.L. Gore and Associates, Inc. In addition, any other suitable paper or fabric filter type may be used. Another alternative filter element is a ceramic gas filter. One example of a suitable ceramic gas filter is manufactured by CeraMem Separations under the name CeraMem®.<br>
Electrode grid 28 is preferably comprised of high voltage corona discharge electrodes, either in the form of wires or a rigid frame. Preferably, directional corona electrodes are used so that the corona is forced to the plate side of the electrode rather than to the backside. In addition, any other type of conventional electrode may be employed. In an alternative embodiment, the bags 24 can be protected by including a row of grounded wires located between the electrode grid 28 and the bags 24. However, typically, this extra row of grounded wires is not necessary, except under severe sparking conditions. Another optional embodiment involves the use of multiple vessels for use with large power plants, for example.<br>
There is major synergism between the ESP and filtration modes of the present invention, each improving the operation of the other. The filter elements collect the excess ESP emissions during normal operation and during rapping, and the ESP collects the reentrained dust from the filter elements upon cleaning, which will greatly enhance the ability to control<br>
pressure drop and operate at high A/C ratios. The present invention results in a high collection efficiency and requires a much lower plate collection than with conventional ESP devices and much less filtration area than in conventional baghouses. In the preferred embodiment, the fabric is operated at an A/C ratio of 12 ft./min. The corresponding required plate area would be a specific collection area (SCA) of 72 square feet of collection are per thousand acfm. A baghouse operating at an A/C ratio of 2 ft./min. has the same collection area as an ESP with an SCA of 500. Therefore, the device of the present invention operating at an A/C ratio of 12 ft./min. would offer an 83% reduction in fabric area over a conventional baghouse operating at 2 ft./min. and an 86% reduction in plate area over a conventional ESP with an SCA of 500. The combined collection area in the present invention would be 69% lower than either the conventional baghouse or ESP.<br>
The performance of the present invention may also be improved by injecting upstream of the baghouse a small but conditioning effective amount of ammonia gas (NH3) and sulfur trioxide (SO3) in sequence. When this is done, the pressure drop across the baghouse is less and the amount of particulate matter in the smoke stack emissions is reduced by significant amounts. This method is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,030 entitled "Process of Flue Gas Conditioning Applied to Fabric Filtration" issued to Miller et al. on Jul. 23, 1990 which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention has been set forth in the drawings and specification, and although specific terms are employed, these are used in a generic or descriptive sense only and are not used for purposes of limitation. Changes in the form and proportion of parts as well as in the substitution of equivalents are contemplated as circumstances may suggest or render expedient without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as further defined in the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
