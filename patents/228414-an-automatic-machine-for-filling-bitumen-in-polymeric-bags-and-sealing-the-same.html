				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an automatic machine for riling bitumen in polymeric bags and<br>
sealing the same. More particularly, this invention pertains to a novel machine that is capable of<br>
filling all grades of bitumen in self-dissolving bags of polymeric material, thereby obviating the<br>
need to use costly steel drums and also saving in heating time along with complete utilisation of<br>
bitumen.<br>
Conventionally bitumen had to be transported / carried to the road building site either in bulk or<br>
in steel drums of capacity varying between 150 and 200 kg. In case of bulk transportation of<br>
bitumen, there has to be a bulk storage tank(s) at the site. Prior to actual use, the contents of the<br>
tank has to be heated to bring bitumen into an usable form, which involves considerable energy<br>
cost, and farther the application site from the storage tank, greater will be the energy cost on<br>
account of heating of the bitumen mass prior to actual application. Another drawback of bulk<br>
transportation of bilumen is that the tanker carrying bitumen has to return empty as it is not<br>
suitable for carrying / transporting other materials. Moreover, in a large country like India,<br>
transportation of higher grade bitumen to far-flung areas poses a lot of difficulties, particularly<br>
for taking the contents out of the tanker without adequate heating and storage facilities.<br>
The alternative mode of transporting bitumen is in steel drum, which is widely practiced in<br>
developing countries like India. Apart from the cost of the empty drums, packing cost comes to<br>
around Rs. 2500, 00 per metric tonne. The bitumen carrying drums also suffer from cumbersome<br>
handling procedure and loss of cargo space during transportation due to the gap between the<br>
circular drums, which eventually results in higher freight charges. Bitumen-filled drums have<br>
been found to develop leakages on storing due to rusting and corrosion from acidic components.<br>
Drums if stacked in the open, there is a distinct possibility of rainwater entering or seeping in,<br>
thereby aggravating the incidence of corrosion and necessitating higher pre-usage heating for<br>
longer periods for taking out bitumen. Pre-usage heating of bitumen drums has to be done<br>
extremely carefully, and often labourers handling the drums or carrying molten bitumen alter<br>
heating sustain serious burn injuries mainly on account of high latent heat of the contents which<br><br>
under ambient conditions is a plastic mass with high viscosity. These characteristics of bitumen<br>
result in at least 3% residual loss of bitumen due to sticking to the walls and bottom of the<br>
drums. Repeated heating of the drums to take out bitumen shortens the life and they tend to<br>
develop leaks at the seams through which bitumen oozes out, posing a hazard to the workmen<br>
handling the heated material.<br>
The present invention aims at overcoming the drawbacks of the conventional mode of handling<br>
and transporting bitumen by providing an automatic machine which virtually eliminates the<br>
hazards and effects considerable cost saving, - not to speak of ease of transportation and<br>
convenience of storage.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide an automatic machine for filling bitumen in<br>
polymeric bags and sealing the same.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an automatic machine which uses a plastic tube in<br>
collapsed state to impart a bag form by shearing and sealing the bottom thereof by application of<br>
heat and/or pneumatic pressure, opening the mouth of the bag and filling it with molten bitumen,<br>
sealing the upper lip and releasing the bitumen-filled bag into a cooling tank.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide an automatic machine for filling the bitumen<br>
in plastic bags wherein the plastic/polymeric bag material is self-dissolving, i.e. the container<br>
bags dissolve in molten bitumen in the course of preheating, thereby eliminating material loss.<br>
Another object of this invention is to use heating means, either electrical or gaseous fuel, to bring<br>
bitumen into a fluid form which is led through suitable pipeline, usually insulated, to be filled<br>
into the polymeric bags which arc then led into a cooling tank for converting bitumen into<br>
substantially solid form for ease of handling, storage and transportation.<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an automatic machine for filling bitumen in<br>
self-dissolving polymeric bags, wherein the sequential unit operations are carried out with the<br>
help of electronic controllers or microprocessors programmed for such performancc(s).<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide an automatic machine for filling bitumen in<br>
self-dissolving polymeric bags, which is fabricated from indigenously available raw materials,<br>
and the controllers arc made with the help of chips and components available in the open market<br>
in India.<br>
The foregoing objects arc achieved by the present invention pertaining to an automatic machine<br>
for filling bitumen in polymeric bags and scaling the same, which comprises<br>
(a)	means for feeding collapsed polymeric tubular body with an arrangement for shearing<br>
and scaling, thereby forming a bag;<br>
(b)	means for heating bitumen and leading the molten bitumen through a pipeline meant<br>
therefor;<br>
(c)	means for opening the mouth of the bag and allowing a predetermined amount of molten<br>
bitumen to be poured inside and automatically scaling the mouth of the bitumen-filled<br>
bag and<br>
(d)	sensors and controllers for sensing and synchronizing the sequential operations of<br>
shearing, scaling the bottom, filling the bag with bitumen, scaling the upper lip of the bag<br>
and releasing the bitumen-filled bag onto a conveyor, chute, pallet or a suitable receptacle<br>
to be led into a cooling tank.<br>
The different "means" referred to before and hereinafter in this specification may be<br>
enumerated as follows:<br>
(i) 'Means for feeding collapsed polymeric tubular body' this is a bag-forming<br>
continuous feeding through rollers rotating in mutually opposite directions from<br>
rolled polymeric film, which is equipped with a cutting knife to cut the tubular film at<br>
desired length and by heat-scaling at bottom part of the tubular body, there is formed<br>
an open-top bag capable of holding a predetermined quantity of bitumen (usually 25<br>
kg/bag) programmed to be poured in each bag.<br><br>
(ii) 'Means for heating bitumen and leading the molten bitumen through a pipeline'—<br>
bitumen is kept in a big receptacle (usually a kettle) or a reservoir equipped with<br>
heating means, either electrical or gaseous, at a controlled temperature to maintain the<br>
bitumen in a molten condition, which flows through a pipeline for filling the<br>
polymeric bag with the help of a transfer pump operated in a fixed time cycle to<br>
achieve an exact mass of molten bitumen being poured in each bag.<br>
(iii) 'Means for opening the mouth of the bag and allowing a predetermined amount of<br>
molten bitumen to be poured inside' top of the polymeric bag is opened<br>
pneumatically followed by allowing molten bitumen to be filled in till a fixed<br>
quantity of bitumen passes into each bag, whereafter pouring is cut off through the<br>
control system and the top edge of the bitumen filled bag is heat scaled.<br>
The term "predetermined quantity" used before and hereinafter in this specification refers to<br>
the mass (in kg.) of molten bitumen to be filled in each polymeric bag. Usually it is 25 kg.<br>
per bag, but the dimension/size of the bag and consequently the quantum of contents may be<br>
altered as per requirement.<br>
Quantity of the molten bitumen being poured in a polymeric bag is controlled by a timer,<br>
which brings the transfer pump to a stop. The top open bag is closed pneumatically and<br>
second scaling (at the top) is activated by electronic controller and the filled bag is heat<br>
scaled to produce a fool-proof, scaled bitumen packet.<br>
Thereafter the bitumen-filled bag is allowed to fall on a belt conveyor fitted below the filling<br>
point to transfer the bag with its hot contents into a cooling water tank where bitumen gets<br>
solidified.<br>
In this continuous operation, the bitumen-filled bags can be stacked one on top of the other<br>
for convenient storage. Use of self-dissolving polythene bags is another important feature of<br>
this invention which ensures total utilization of material without any loss and/or wastage. It<br>
has also been observed that presence of molten polythene imparts enhanced water repellency<br>
to the top surface of roads receiving mastic-asphalt treatment.<br><br>
Filling of bitumen into polymeric bags, thus constituting unit loads that can be transported<br>
easily by conventional means, and then melting the polymeric bags with the bitumen<br>
contained therein is a novel process by itself. This would result in higher strength of the<br>
molten bitumen for the purpose of road laying, totally eliminating the wastage due to residual<br>
bitumen in their containers, which is a common phenomenon, and reduced cost and<br>
complication in transporting the bitumen as compared with the prior methods.<br>
Polymer sheet used for the purpose of making bags to be filled with bitumen is usually LDPE <br>
(low density polythene) formed into an endless tube. Such tubes arc severed at predetermined<br>
intervals and the bottom end thereof is scaled by application of pneumatic pressure. The<br>
endless tube in a collapsed form is passed over guide rollers and placed in front of the cutting<br>
unit, which automatically cuts the tube at any predetermined length, and the first scaling unit<br>
activated by a programmable controller seals the lower end of the tube. The thus formed bag<br>
is carried to a spreader unit where the mouth of the bag is opened and molten bitumen from<br>
the heated bitumen reservoir is led through insulated pipeline and poured into the bag. After<br>
release of a predetermined quantity of bitumen, pneumatically operated second scaling unit is<br>
activated by the electronic controller and the bitumen-filled bag mouth is automatically<br>
scaled. The bag with its content is allowed to fall on an endless conveyor and is led into a<br>
cooling tank wherein bitumen gets hardened. The bitumen-filled bags can be stacked one on<br>
top of the other just like cement bags and conveniently stored for future use without loss of<br>
any storage space. Use of self-dissolving polythene bags is another important aspect of this<br>
invention which ensures complete utilization of raw material, namely, bitumen, without any<br>
wastage whatsoever.<br>

In Fig. 1, (1) is the main structural frame of the machine, (2) denotes polythene tube in a<br>
collapsed state passing through a plurality of rollers (3), the last pair serving as the guide rollers,<br>
(4) stands for the driving means for main guide roller which is a motor. (5) is the polythene sheet<br>
cutting unit and (6) is the motor / driver for the cutting unit. One end of the polythene tube is<br>
sealed by the initial sealing unit (7) and the tubular body is firmly held in place by the gripper<br>
unit (8), leading to formation of a bag open at one end and closed at the other.<br>
Fig.2 shows the arrangement for filling bitumen after opening of the bag, followed by sealing of<br>
the bitumen filled bag, wherein (9) is the blower for bitumen inlet pipe and (10) is the driver /<br>
motor for film opener (16). Bitumen is made to travel under gravity through the feeder pipe (11)<br>
from main tank (not shown). The feeder pipe is usually wrapped with insulating material like<br>
asbestos threads to prevent clogging by heat loss and consequent solidification of bitumen. There<br>
is usually provided a M.S. pipe (12) accommodating the blower to bitumen feeder pipe. The<br>
molten bitumen is led to an outlet (13) positioned above the polythene bag which is acted upon<br>
by the bag-spreading unit (15), and alter filling the bag mouth is sealed by the sealing unit (14).<br>
Fig.3 depicting the front sectional view of the automatic machine of this invention shows the<br>
locations of guide rollers (3), sheet cutting unit (5), initial sealing unit (7), bitumen feeder pipe<br>
(11), final sealing unit (14), bag-spreading unit (15) and driver for film opener (16), as already<br>
illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 of the aforementioned drawings. The polythene bag after its initial<br>
bottom sealing is automatically moved to the feeding unit wherein (17) stands for air cylinders<br>
(5) for initial sealing unit and (18) is the air cylinder bringing about translational movement of<br>
the bags sealed at one end, positioning it right below the bitumen filling station. Bitumen is<br>
stored in tank (19) and maintained in a fluid state by using heating means (20). Heating may be<br>
done either electrically or by burning gaseous fuel. Prior to filling, the bag mouth has to be<br>
opened and kept in a spread out condition. (21) is the driver for spreading unit and (22) is the air<br>
cylinder for actuating movement of the spreader unit. (23) and (24) are air cylinders for bringing<br><br><br>
about movement of the final sealing unit, and for controlling bitumen filling inside the polythene<br>
bags.<br>
The synchronous operations like cutting of polythene tubular body to a desired length,<br>
transporting it to the filling station, opening and spreading of bag mouth, filling the bag with<br>
predetermined amount of molten bitumen, sealing the bag mouth and releasing the sealed bag<br>
onto the endless conveyor for being led into a cooling tank are taken care of by electronic<br>
controllers, suitably programmed, which are assembled from chips and sensors available in the<br>
open market. Usually a multiplicity of controllers are used for the sake of convenience, such as<br>
(i) guiding operations like bag cutting and sealing the lower end, (ii) bag opening and spreading<br>
and (iii) bag filling with bitumen followed by final sealing.<br>
The process of the present invention is completely automatic with bitumen supplies drawn from<br>
a bitumen tank and the material feed for the bags fabricated from polythene film rolls. On<br>
starting the operation, the machine starts with cutting and bottom sealing of individual polythene<br>
bag, which is held in position by grippers and thereafter shifted to filling station. Pneumatic<br>
openers widen the mouth of the bag and a pump drawing liquefied bitumen from the supply tank<br>
starts immediately. The open-mouthed bag is positioned just under the bitumen delivery pipe,<br>
and the pump discharges liquid bitumen inside the bag with a time-adjusted delivery ensuring<br>
release of a fixed amount of bitumen in each polybag. The bag is sealed immediately after filling<br>
is over and the bag with its content is fed into a conveyor, which delivers the bag into the cooling<br>
tank.<br>
The advantages of the subject invention may be summarized as under:<br>
1.	The machine and component parts thereof are available indigenously and does not require<br>
any sophisticated machinery for its fabrication, which renders the machine considerably cost<br>
effective;<br>
2.	There is a direct cost saving on the packing charges to the extent of around Rs. 1000.00 per<br>
MT.<br><br>
3.	There is also considerable savings due to elimination of wastage as residue in the steel<br>
drums.<br>
4.	The polybag material is so chosen that they completely melt at 160°C. Hence the bags with<br>
their contents can be introduced directly into the tar boilers of the bitumen plants, thereby<br>
totally eliminating residual losses and obviating preheating as in the case of steel drums.<br>
5.	Polythene, which melts with bitumen, enhances the quality intended for its purpose, and<br>
increases road life.<br>
6.	Bitumen filled polybags can be stored even in the open for prolonged period of time without<br>
any loss or leakage.<br>
7.	The polybags can be stacked like cement bags which requires less space and renders handling<br>
considerably easy.<br>

9.	An automatic machine as claimed in Claim 3. wherein the lip of the filled bitumen bags is<br>
cleaned before scaling, or bitumen is prevented from sticking to the lips of the bags by<br>
known means, like efficiently closing the mouth of the bitumen tap, or diverting the flow<br>
of hot bitumen away from the lip by using direction control valves, or hot-air currents, so<br>
that efficient scaling of the upper lip after filling is achieved.<br>
10.	An automatic machine for filling bitumen in polymeric bags and scaling the same,<br>
substantially as hereinbefore described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Dated this I6th day of February, 2006.<br><br>
Conventional mode of filling and transportation of bitumen is by using<br>
round steel drums. Apart from cost of empty drums, packing cost is also<br>
considerable and there is loss of cargo space due to circular shape of the<br>
drums. Bitumen-filled drums often develop leakages on storing due to rusting<br>
and corrosion from acidic component. Storage of bitumen-filled drums in the<br>
open is susceptible to action of rainwater and taking out the contents from<br>
the drums necessitates heating, but same amount of bitumen is lost. Handling<br>
of molten bitumen from steel drums is also hazardous.<br>
The present invention overcomes the above difficulties by using polymer<br>
bags for filling bitumen which can be conveniently stacked like cement bags.<br>
This invention provides an automatic machine for filling bitumen in polymeric<br>
bags and sealing the same, which comprises -<br>
(a)	means for feeling (3) collapsel polymeric tubular body (2) with an<br>
arrangement for shearing (5) and sealing (7), thereby forming<br>
a bag;<br>
(b)	means for heating bitumen (9) an leading the molten bitumen<br>
through a pipeline meant therefor (ll):<br>
(c)	means for opening the mouth of the bag (15) allowing a predetermined<br>
amount of molten bitumen to be poured inside and automatically<br>
sealing the mouth of the bitumen-filled bag (14) and<br>
(d)	sensors and controllers (21, 22, 23 and 24) for sensing and<br>
synchronizing the sequential operations of shearing, sealing the<br>
bottom, filling the bag with bitumen, sealing the upper lip of the<br>
bag and releasing the bitumen-filled bag onto a conveyor, chute,<br>
pallet or a suitable receptacle to be led into a cooling tank.</td>
