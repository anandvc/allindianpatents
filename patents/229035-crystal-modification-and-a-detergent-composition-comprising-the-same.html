Crystalline Modifications of Triazinylaminostilbenes Crystalline Modification<br>
This invention relates to a novel polymorph crystal form of the compound of formula (1)<br><br>
a process for its preparation and the use thereof.<br>
The compound of formula (1) is known as an amorphous modification only.<br>
The ability of a substance to exist in more than one crystal form is defined as polymorphism and these different crystal forms are named "polymorph modifications" or "polymorphs". In general, polymorphism is affected by the ability of a molecule of a substance to change its conformation or to form different intermolecular or intra-molecular interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds, which is reflected in different atom arrangements in the crystal lattices of different polymorphs. Polymorphism is found in several organic compounds. The different polymorphs of a substance possess different energies of the crystal lattice and, thus, in solid state they show different physical properties.<br>
A useful tool for the differentiation of crystal modification is the X-ray diffraction, such as for example the powder X-ray diffraction.<br>
Due to the fact that the crystal form and therefore also the powder X-ray diffraction pattern is among others dependent on the degree of dryness, the content of water is specified for each spectrum.<br>
The content of water is measured by common known analytical methods. In the present application, the content of water has been measured by the Karl Fischer Titration.<br>
All X-ray powder spectra data have been obtained by X-ray diffraction on a powder sample of the new crystal modification in the instrument X'Pert powder diffractometer PANalytical<br><br>
inside a closed Anton Paar measuring stage using CuK« radiation. The followong conditions have been set:<br>
•	tube power 40kV/40mA<br>

•	time per step 2s<br>
•	room temperature.<br>

Furthermore, the detergent can optionally contain enzymes. Enzymes can be added to detergents for stain removal. The enzymes usually improve the performance on stains that are either protein- or starch-based, such as those caused by blood, milk, grass or fruit juices. Preferred enzymes are cellulases, proteases, amylases and lipases. Preferred enzymes are<br><br>
cellulases and proteases, especially proteases. Cellulases are enzymes which act on<br>
cellulose and its derivatives and hydrolyze them into glucose, cellobiose,<br>
cellooligosaccharide. Cellulases remove dirt and have the effect of mitigating the roughness<br>
to the touch. Examples of enzymes to be used include, but are by no means limited to, the<br>
following:<br>
proteases as given in US-B-6,242,405, column 14, lines 21 to 32;<br>

cellulases as given in US-B-6,242,405, column 14, lines 57 to 64.<br>
The enzymes can optionally be present in the detergent. When used, the enzymes are usually present in an amount of 0.01 - 5% by weight, preferably 0.05 - 5% and more preferably 0.1 - 4% by weight, based on the total weight of the detergent.<br>
Further preferred additives for the detergents according to the invention are polymers that, during the washing of textiles, inhibit staining caused by dyes in the washing liquor that have been released from the textiles under the washing conditions (dye fixing agents, dye transfer inhibitors). Such polymers are preferably polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyvinylimidazoles or polyvinylpyridine N-oxides which may have been modified by the incorporation of anionic or cationic substituents, especially those having a molecular weight in the range from 5000 to 60 000, more especially from 10 000 to 50 000. Such polymers are usually used in an amount of from 0.01 to 5 %, preferably 0.05 to 5 % by weight, especially 0.1 to 2 % by weight, based on the total weight of the detergent. Preferred polymers are those given in WO-A-02/02865 (see especially page 1, last paragraph and page 2, first paragraph).<br>
The detergents used will usually contain one or more auxiliaries such as soil suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose; salts for adjusting the pH, for example alkali or alkaline earth metal silicates; foam regulators, for example soap; salts for adjusting the spray drying and granulating properties, for example sodium sulphate; perfumes; and also, if appropriate, antistatic and softening agents; such as smectite clays; photobleaching agents; pigments; and/or shading agents. These constituents should, of course, be stable to any bleaching system employed. Such auxiliaries can be present in an amount of, for example, 0.1 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10 % by weight, especially 0.5 to 5 % by weight, based on the total weight of the detergent.<br><br>
The detergent compositions can take a variety of physical forms including powder, granular, tablet and liquid forms. Examples thereof are conventional powder heavy-duty detergents, compact and supercompact heavy-duty detergents and tablets, like heavy-duty detergent tablets. One important physical form is the so-called concentrated granular form adapted to be added to a washing machine.<br>
Of importance are also the so-called compact (or supercompact) detergents. In the field of detergent manufacture, a trend has developed recently towards the production of compact detergents which contain increased amounts of active substance. In order to minimize energy expenditure during the washing process, the compact detergents are required to operate efficiently at temperatures as low as 40°C, or even at room temperatures, e.g. at 25°C. Such detergents usually contain only low amounts of fillers or processing aids, like sodium sulfate or sodium chloride. The amount of such fillers is usually 0-10% by weight, preferably 0 - 5% by weight, especially 0 -1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the detergent. Such detergents usually have a bulk density of 650 -1000 g/1, preferably 700 -1000 g/l and especially 750 -1000 g/l.<br>
The detergents can also be present in the form of tablets. Relevant characteristics of tablets are ease of dispensing and convenience in handling. Tablets are the most compact delivery of solid detergents and have a bulk density of, for example, 0.9 to 1.3 kg/litre. To enable fast disintegration laundry detergent tablets generally contain special disintegrants: -Effervescents such as carbonate/hydrogencarbonate/citric acid; -swelling agents like cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, cross-linked poly(N-<br>
vinylpyrrollidone); -quickly dissolving materials such as Na (K) acetate, or Na (K) citrate; -rapidly dissolving water-soluble rigid coating such as dicarboxy acids. The tablets can also contain combinations of any of the above disintegrants.<br>
The detergent may also be formulated as an aqueous liquid comprising 5 - 50, preferably 10 - 35% water or as a non-aqueous liquid detergent, containing not more than 5, preferably 0 - 1 wt.% of water. Non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions can contain other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6<br><br>
carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1 f2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers. The detergents can also be present as the so-called "unit liquid dose" form.<br>
This detergent treatment of textiles can be conducted as a domestic treatment in normal washing machines.<br>
The textile fibres treated may be natural or synthetic fibres or mixtures thereof. Examples of natural fibres include vegetable fibres such as cotton, viscose, flax, rayon or linen, preferably cotton and animal fibres such as wool, mohair, cashmere, angora and silk, preferably wool. Synthetic fibres include polyester, polyamide and polyacrylonitrile fibres. Preferred textile fibres are cotton, polyamide and wool fibres, especially cotton fibres. Preferably, textile fibres treated according to the method of the present invention have a density of less than 200 g/m2.<br>

The process is usually conducted in the temperature range of from 5 to 100°C, especially 5 to 60°C. Preferred is a temperature range of 5 to 40°C, especially 5 to 35°C and more preferably 5 to 30°C.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 11. Laundry products are typically at pH 9 - 11.

A further advantage of the present invention is that the detergent composition delivers improved whiteness performance and fabric feel. Furthermore the compounds and especially the mixtures show very good results with respect to exhaustion properties.<br>
