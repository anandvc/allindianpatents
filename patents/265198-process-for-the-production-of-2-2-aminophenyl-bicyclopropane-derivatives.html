				<td>Process for the production of anilines<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-(2-aminophenyl)-bicyclopropanes, and to novel nitrobenzene intermediates for use in that process.<br>
2-(2-Aminophenyl)-blcyclopropanes, such as, for example, unsubstituted 2-(2-aminophenyl)-bicyclopropane, are valuable intermediates for the preparation of ortho-bicyclopropyl-carboxanilide fungicides, such as are described, for example, in WO 03/074491.<br>
In WO 03/074491, a process for the preparation of 2-(2-aminophenyl)-bicyclopropanes is described (see Scheme 1):<br>
Scheme 1:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 According to WO 03/074491, ketones of formula (A), wherein R3 may be, inter alia, unsubstituted or substituted cyclopropyl, are reacted, for example, first with bromine and methanol and then with triphenylphosphine. The compounds of formula (B) obtained are converted in a two-step reaction into compounds of formula (C) wherein Hal is bromine or iodine (first, reaction with sodium hydride, then reaction with 2-bromobenzaldehyde or<br>
2-iodobanzaldehyde, respectively). Compounds of formula (C) can be converted into the corresponding 2-(2-halophenyl)-bicyclopropanes (D) by Kishner cyclisation, which proceeds by way of a ∆2-pyrazoline. For that purpose, compounds of formula (C) are reacted, with heating, with hydrazine, as a result of which the corresponding ∆2-pyrazolines are formed. Subsequently, potassium hydroxide is added for isomerisation, and renewed heating is carried out to remove N2.2-(2-Halophenyl)-bicyclopropanes (D) can be aminated in a two-step reaction to form the corresponding 2-(2-aminophenyl)-bicyclopropanes (F). For that purpose, first of all benzophenone imine, sodium tert-butanolate, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)-dipalladium (Pdadbaa) and racemic 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphine)-1,1'-binaphthyl (BINAP) are added. The resulting imjnes (E) are reacted in the second reaction step, for example with hydroxylamine and sodium acetate, to form the corresponding 2-(2-aminophenyl)-bicyclo-propanes (F).<br>
Such a reaction procedure is not suitable, however, for the preparation of 2-(2-aminophenyl)-bicyclopropanes, especially for large-scale preparation processes, because of the costly palladium-containing catalysts and ligands, such as, for example, BINAP.<br>
In WO 03/074491, two further routes for the preparation of 2-(2-aminophenyl)-bIcyclo-propanes are described. A first route is by way of nitration of bicyclopropyl-benzenes. It has been found, however, that the reaction is not workable in view of the fact that the cydopropyl ring linked directly to the benzene ring has increased reactivity in bicyclopropyl-benzenes with respect to electrophiles. A second route is by way of application of the Simmons-Smith reaction (Zn/Cu, CH2l2 with ether as solvent) to 1-((E/Z)-2-cydopropylvinyl)-2-nitrobenzenes. In that case, too, the reaction has been found to be unsuitable for the preparation of 2-(2-nitrophenyl)-bicyclopropanes, since the reactivity of the double bond is too low.<br>
The aim of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of 2-(2-amlnophenyl)-bicyclopropanes that allows such compounds to be prepared in an economically advantageous manner in high yields and in good quality.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 R2 and R3 are each independently of the others hydrogen or methyl, which<br>
comprises<br>
a) reaction of a compound of formula II<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined for formula I, either<br>
a1) with triphenylphosphine dibromide or triphenylphosphine dichloride or<br>
a2) with RSO2CI, wherein R is C1-C4alkyl, C1-C4fluoroalkyl, benzyl, phenyl, nitrophenyl,<br>
halophenyl or C1-C6alkylphenyl, in the presence of a base,<br>
to form a compound of formula III<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X is bromine, chlorine or OSO2R, wherein R is C1-C4alkyl, C1-C4fluoroalkyl, benzyl, phenyl, nitrophenyl, halophenyl or C1-C6alkylphenyJ, and R1, R2 and R3 are as defined for formula I; and b) reaction of that compound in the presence of a base to form a compound of formula IV<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined for formula 1; and<br>
c) conversion of that compound in the presence of a reducing agent into a compound of<br>
formula I.<br>
Ortho-bicyclopropylcarboxanilide fungicides are generally chiral molecules that occur in isomerio forms. Accordingly they exist as trans/cis isomers based on the substitution pattern of the cyclopropyl ring linked directly to the benzene ring. It is known that the f ungicidal activity of compounds such as are described, for example, in WO 03/074491, can be influenced by the stereochemistry. It has been found In the case of the ortho-bicyclopropyl-carboxanilide fungicides described therein that the trans isomers generally have higher fungfcidal activity. The development of a process that enables the production of a marked excess of trans ortho-blcyclopropylcarboxanilide fungicides is therefore extremely desirable.<br>
The reaction sequence described in WO 03/074491 (Scheme 1) yields a trans:cis ratio of the 2-(2-aminophenyl)-bicyclopropane isomers of about 2:1.<br>
A further aim of the present invention is accordingly to provide a process for the preparation of 2-{2-aminophenyl)-btcyclopropanes having a significantly higher proportion of trans isomers.<br>
The process according to the invention allows compounds of formula 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

to be produced wherein R1 R2 and R3 are each independently of the others hydrogen or methyl and wherein the ratio of compounds of formula la (trans)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

Halogen in the context of halophenyl is generally fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
Fluoroalkyl groups having a chain length of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms are, for example, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 1-fluoroethyl, 2-fluoroethyl, 2-fluoroprop-2-yl, pentafluoroethyl, 2,2,3,3-tetrafiuoroethyl, pentafluoroethyl or heptafluoro-n-propyl; fluoroalkyl groups are preferably trichloromethyl, fluoromethyl, dichlorofluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl or heptafluoro-n-propyl.<br>

The present invention is explained in greater detail by way of the following Examples:<br>
Example P1: Preparation of 2-(2-nitrophenyn-bicycloropane: A mixture of 0.5 g of 1-cyctopropyl-3-(2-nitrophenyl)-propan-1-ol (2.26 mmol), 0.26 g of triethylamine (2.6 mmol) and 12 ml of dichloromethane is cooled to a temperature of 5°C and 0.28 g of methanesulfonic acid chloride, dissolved in 3 ml of dichloromethane, is added dropwise. The resulting mixture is stirred for 16 hours at ambient temperature. The organic phase is washed with ice-water and dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated by evaporation. 1-Cyc!opropyl-3-(2-nitrophenyl)-propyl methanesuifonate is obtained in the form of a crude product, which is used directly in the cyclisation.<br>
