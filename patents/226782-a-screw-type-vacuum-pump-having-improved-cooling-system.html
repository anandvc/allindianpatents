				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a screw-type vacuum pump comprising a pump housing<br>
with rotors arranged therein, a liquid cooling system for the rotors and a drive<br>
motor. More particularly, the invention relates to a screw-type vacuum pump<br>
having improved cooling system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
From DE - A-198 20 523 a screw -type vacuum pump with these characteristics<br>
Is know. Said document discloses, moreover, the multiple problems Involved in<br>
cooling screw-type vacuum pumps when these shall be built for, and operated at<br>
high performance densities - compact and operating at high rotational speeds.<br>
BE 1008367 discloses a screw compressor with two cooling systems. The first<br>
cooling system is using oil, which is Injected into the pumping gap and cooled by<br>
heat exchanger 6,7. The second system uses an air stream, produced by a fan.<br>
The invention refers to a screw vacuum pump (not compressor). The heat<br>
exchanger according to the Invention Is located adjacent the Inlet 24 of outer<br>
housing 22, while the prior art heat exchanger Is located at the outlet 11 of the<br>
outer housing 9. The prior art solution cannot have the effect to pre-warm the<br>
cooling air. Therefore claim 1 is novel and Inventive, as the citation does not<br>
disclose any hint to the Idea of the Inventors, allowing the pump to 'breathe'.<br>
The effect as discloses in new claim 3 Is that, what the inventors call 'breathing<br>
of the screw vacuum pump'. DE 2 217 022 describes a liquid ring pump. The<br><br>
construction and the field of use of such pumps are completely different from<br>
construction and use of screw vacuum pumps.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It Is the task of the present Invention to improve the cooling system for a screw-<br>
type vacuum pump having the aforementioned characteristics. This task is solved<br>
through the features of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The additional cooling system in accordance with the present invention for<br>
cooling the pump housing from the outside, specifically by way of an Impelled air<br>
flow produced by a fan linked to the motor, for example, considerably relieves<br>
the liquid cooling system for the rotors accommodated within the pump of stress.<br>
In addition, it is possible with the aid of the impelled air flow to also cool a heat<br>
exchanger through which the cooling liquid of the rotor cooling system flows.<br><br>
the present invention allows the implementation of a cooling for a screw-type<br>
vacuum pump in which the entire machine is air cooled although in addition a<br>
liquid cooling system for the rotors is present. The produced heat is in fact<br>
dissipated by two different heat carriers (liquid for the inner rotor cooling<br>
system, outer cooling system, outer cooling air flow) finally the heat, however, is<br>
in total dissipated by the cooling air flow. This also applies to the dissipation of<br>
secondary heat flows produced by motor losses, gear and bearing losses etc.<br>
Further advantages and details of the present invention shall be explained with<br>
reference to an embodiment depicted schematically in the accompanying<br>
drawing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRWAING<br>
Fig. 1 - Is a longitudinal transverse view of a vacuum pump in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the drawing figure, the screw -type vacuum pump which is to be cooled is<br>
designated as 1, Its pump chamber housing with 2, its rotors with 3,4, its inlet<br>
with 5 and the gear/motor chamber housing with 6, the latter being adjacent<br>
with respect to the pump chamber housing 2 with the rotors 3,4. An outlet on<br>
the delivery side is not depicted. Accommodated in the housing 6 is the gear<br>
chamber 7, the motor chamber 8 with eth drive motor 9 and a further chamber<br>
10, being a component of the liquid cooling circuit for the rotors 3,4.<br><br>
The rotors 3,4 are equipped with shafts 11,12 which penetrate the gear chamber<br>
7 and the motor chamber 8. Through bearings in the separating wails between<br>
pump chamber and gear chamber 7 (separating wall 13) as well as motor<br>
chamber 8 and cooling liquid chamber 10 (separating wall 14), the rotor 3,4 are<br>
suspended in a cantilevered manner. The separating wall between gear chamber<br>
7 and motor chamber 8 is designed as 15. Accommodated in the gear chamber 7<br>
is a pair of	<br><br>
toothed wheels 16, 17 effecting the synchronous rotation of the rotors 3, 4. The rotor<br>
shaft 11 is simultaneously the drive shaft of the motor 9. The motor 9 may even be<br>
equipped with a drive shaft differing from the shafts 11, 12. In the instance of such a<br>
solution its drive shaft terminates in gear chamber 7 and is equipped there with a<br>
toothed wheel which intermeshes with one of the synchronising toothed wheels 16, 17<br>
(or a further toothed wheel, not depicted, of the shaft 12).<br>
Shaft 11 penetrates the chamber 10, is run out of the housing 6 of the pump 1 and<br>
carriers at its unoccupied end the wheel 20 of a ventilator or fan 21. A housing 22<br>
encompassing the pump 1 serves the purpose of guiding the air movement produced<br>
by blade wheel 20, said housing being open (apertures 23, 24) in the area of both face<br>
sides.<br>
In the sense of the present invention, the fan 21 is operated such that the aperture 24<br>
on the fan/motor side forms the air inlet aperture. Assigned to this aperture is a heat<br>
exchanger 25 through which the cooling liquid of the internal rotor cooling system<br>
flows. Expediently, the heat exchanger 25 is located upstream of fan 21 so that it<br>
simultaneously forms a means of touch protection for the blade wheel 20. The<br>
advantage of this arrangement is, that the air flow cooling the pump chamber housing<br>
2 of the pump 1 is pre-warmed. In this manner it is achieved that thermal expansions<br>
of the pump chamber housing 2 are allowed to such an extent that the rotors 3, 4<br>
attaining during operation of pump 1 relatively high temperatures, do not come into<br>
contact with the housing 2. Preferably, the housing 2 and the rotors 3, 4 are made of<br>
aluminium for the purpose of improving heat conductance. Moreover, the housing 2<br>
may exhibit fins for improving the thermal contact. Through the size of the heat<br><br>
exchanger 25 and also through the degree by which the pump chamber housing 2 is<br>
equipped with fins, the gap between the rotors 3, 4 and the housing 2 is adjusted.<br>
The cooling liquid circuit for cooling the rotors 3, 41) is depicted only schematically. In<br>
the German patent applications 197 45 616, 199 63 171.9 and 199 63 172.7 cooling<br>
systems of this kind are described in detail. The shafts 11 and 12 serve the purpose of<br>
conveying the coolant (oil, for example) to and from the rotors 3, 4. In the example of<br>
the depicted embodiment, the coolant exiting the rotors 3, 4 collects in the motor<br>
chamber 8. From there the coolant is supplied through the line 26 to the heat<br>
exchanger 25. The air flow produced by fan 21 dissipates the heat which was<br>
dissipated by the cooling liquid in the rotors 3, 4. The liquid exiting the heat exchanger<br>
25 is supplied through the line 26 to the chamber 10. In a manner not depicted in detail<br>
it passes from there through bores in the shafts 11, 12 to the rotors 3, 4, flows there<br>
through cooling ducts and passes through the shafts 11, 12 back into the motor<br>
chamber 8.<br>
It has been found to be expedient to adjust the cooling system such that approximately<br>
half of the heat generated by the pump is first dissipated by the cooting liquid and<br>
thereafter removed through the heat exchanger 25, and such that the other half is<br>
dissipated directly by the cooling air flow.<br>
Translator's note: The German text states "4, 5" here whereas "3.4" would be more in line with the<br>
drawing figures and the remainder of the text. Therefore "3, 4" has been assumed for the translation.<br><br>
In all, the characteristics in accordance with the present invention allow a further<br>
increase in the performance density of a screw-type pump. The pump may be<br>
designed to be smaller and may be operated at higher surface temperatures.<br>
The housing 22 serving the purpose of guiding the outer air flow has, in addition, the<br>
function of providing a means of touch protection.<br><br>
