For a more complete understanding of the instant invention reference is now made to the following description taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figure 1 of the drawings shows in elevation the current practice of Installation of hydraulic bral<e system namely the front brake in a motor cycle .></e><br>
Figure 2 of the drawings shows in elevation the master cylinder assy.<br>
Figure 3 of the drawings shows in elevation the caliper assembly and<br>
Figure 4 of the drawings shows in elevation an embodiment of the invention of integral braking system according to the invention.<br>
The Integrated Braking System concept is explained taking motorcycle / scooter (any two wheeler, powered or unpowered like motor cycle or scooter or mountain bicycle) as an example.<br>
Following are the shortcomings of the existing installation.<br>
1.  Normally, no bleed screw is provided in the master cylinder, in the example of two wheeler hydraulic braking system.<br>
2. Bleed screw Is provided in the caliper. The head difference between master cylinder and the caliper is such that bleeding the system to remove air completely is very difficult and time consuming.<br><br>
3. It is possible to bleed the system completely in the production line using evacuate and fill concepts. It is very costly. The service centers cannot afford to install / invest on the evacuate and fill component<br>
4. A flexible hose connects the master cylinder and caliper. It consumes certain volume of brake fluid displaced from the master cylinder to cater for its expansion under pressure. This results in additional lever travel.<br>
5.  In the Foundry aspect, for one vehicle set. it needs two dies and pours twice to get one caliper casting and one master cylinder casting.<br>
6.  In the manufacturing aspect, it needs a separate machining line and assembly line for caliper and master cylinder.<br>
7. Though hydraulic braking system is advantageous over mechanical drum brake system, it is expensive compared to a drum brake system.<br>
Figure (1) shows the current practice of installation of the hydraulic brake system, for example, the front brake system in a motor cycle.<br>
Hydraulic braking system consists of the following: -<br>
A master cylinder assembly (A) installed in the handle bar.<br><br>
A caliper assembly (C) installed in the fork (F).<br>
A hose assembly (B) connecting the master cylinder assembly (A) and<br>
caliper assembly (C), using banjo bolts (E) and gasket (G)<br>
A rotor assembly (D) installed in the wheel, which rotates when the<br>
vehicle is moving.<br>
Figure (2) shows the master cylinder assembly. As illustrated in figure(2) the master cylinder assembly (A) is installed in the handle bar on the right hand side. The master cylinder consists of body (1), spring (2), primary seal (3), plunger (4), secondary seal (5), circlip (6), boot (7). hand lever (8), diaphram (9), reservoir cap (10).<br>
As illustrated in figure (3) which shows the caliper assembly, consists of body (11). pistons (12)(13) (example is taken from a twin pot caliper), piston seal (14)(15), wiper seal (16)(17), friction pads (18)(19), sliding pin (20)(21). dust preventing boots (22) (23), carrier (24) and bleed screw. The caliper is installed in the fork tube. Both master cylinder and the caliper are connected by means of flexible hose (B). The brake rotor (D) is installed in the wheel that rotates along with wheel.<br><br>
To address the above shortcomings retaining the advantage of a hydraulic brake system, the integral brake system idea is invented.<br>
As illustrated in figure (4) the master cylinder body (1) and caliper body (11) is integrated as a single piece using conventional casting technique. A rotor assembly (D) is installed in the wheel. The integrated braking assembly is installed  in  the  appropriate  location.  The  integrated  braking  assembly  is connected to the hand lever* by means of cable and suitable lever. When the hand lever is actuated during brake application the cable connected to the hand lever is actuated which in turn actuates the suitable lever provided in the integrating braking assembly. The levers provided in the integrated brake assembly in turn moves the plunger(4) forward compressing the spring (2) and the primary seal(3) compresses the brake fluid in the system and transfers to the caliper area under pressure through passage (25). The secondary seal (5) prevents the fluid leak through the master cylinder mouth. The plunger (4) is retained by means of the circlip (6) and covered using a boot (7) to prevent from dust entry inside the master cylinder. This pressure developed in the caliper area actuate the caliper piston(12)(13) or pistons. The seal (14) (15) assist the caliper piston to return to the home position after pressure release.   The seal (16) (17) prevents the dust entry into the caliper. If it is twin pot caliper, both the pots are connected through the passage (26) and so on for multiple pot caliper. The caliper pistons (12)(13)<br><br>
in turn moves the friction material (18) against the rotating disc(D) attached to the automotive wheel . After the friction material (18) touches the rotating disc (D), the pressure available in the system pushes the integral body (1 &amp; 11) in the opposite direction tnus pusning the triction material (19) against the rotating disc (D) on the other side of the disc (D). Thus a clamping force is created and the rotating disc (D) is slowed down or stopped depending upon the pressure developed effecting the braking ftinction.<br>
By using this Integral Braking System design, the brake hose which connects the master cylinder, and the caliper (as in conventional system) is eliminated . The bleeding of this system is more effective. Replacing the existing drum brake with IBS is very simple and inexpensive.<br>
The master cylinder is used to displace the brake fluid into the caliper and generate pressure to result in clamping force on to the rotor. The salient feature of the invention is that both the master cylinder and the caliper are integrated into an single assembly that is installed on to the fork where caliper is installed in the existing system.<br>
The function of the hydraulic braking system in existing vehicle is as follows :-<br><br>
The lever (8) is pressed to apply the brake. This displaces the brake fluid in the system to the caliper assembly.<br>
As volume of brake fluid is displaced into the caliper, the pads (18 &amp; 19) are moved and the pressure developed in the system is transmitted as a clamping force on to the rotor (D).<br>
This function result in either stopping the vehicle completely or slowing down the vehicle depending upon the load applied on the hand lever of the master cylinder.<br>
It is herein explained the function of a hydraulic brake system in accordance with state of art technology and the current practice of installation.<br>
As explained the master cylinder is used to displace the brake fluid into the caliper and generates pressure to result in clamping force on to the rotor. The innovation claimed is that both the master cylinder (A) and the caliper(C) are integrated into single assembly that is installed on to the fork where caliper (C) is Installed in the existing system.<br><br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
a) By this arrangement, the short coming enumerated herein is eliminated in such a way, that one bleed screw is provided which is adequate to bleed the integral system.<br>
b) By integrating the master cylinder with the caliper,  the short coming enumerated herein is elijninated since there is no head difference.<br>
c) Hence bleeding the brake system to remove the air becomes very simple, effective and consumes minimum most time. No evacuate and fill equipment is required for bleeding the system.<br>
d) By this innovation, the flexible hose is eliminated to connect the master cylinder and the caliper This eliminates the short coming enumerated herein. No additional lever travel is required to cater for hose expansion.<br>
e) It is also ensured that no joints provided between master cylinder and caliper thus leak free brake system.<br>
f) One single die can be designed and one pour of metal is enough to get an integrated   casting.   This   innovation   thus   eliminates   the   short  coming<br><br>
enumerated herein, that is, two dies and two pours of the casting resulting in saving of metal and cost.<br>
g) One machining line and one assembly line are adequate to produce the integrated braking component. Thus, this innovation eliminates the short coming enumerated herein and thereby simplifying the manufacture and saving cost.<br>
h) By this innovation, the flexible hose (B), the banjo bolts (E) and Gaskets<br>
(G) both at master cylinder and caliper ends, the mounting holder and the<br>
bolts for the master cylinder are eliminated.  This eliminates the short<br>
coming enumerated herein and makes the hydraulic brake system less<br>
expensive.<br>
i) Suitable levers mounted on to the Integral Braking System can operate the master cylinder piston. These levers can be operated by the conventional cable system used in drum brake installation.<br>
j) This facilitates the vehicle manufacturer to make use of the components used for drum brake installation, like, hand lever, hand lever mounting brackets, stop light switch and the cables.<br><br>
k) The rider will see no difference in the handle bar but feel good and stable when applies the brake.<br>
I) The vehicle manufacturer need not invest on new lever development when they offer hydraulic brake system on the same model as an option to the end user.<br>
m) The existing braking function is retained in the Integral Braking System (IBS).<br><br>
Salient feature of the Invention<br>
