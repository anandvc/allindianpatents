				<td>A LASAR DEVICE WITH FREQUENCY CONVERSION<br>
The present invention relates to frequency conversion of laser radiation by means of<br>
non-linear interaction of laser radiation with a suitable non-linear optical material. In<br>
particular the invention relates to intracavity Second Harmonic Generation (SHG), also<br>
called Frequency Doubling (FD), and intracavity Optical Parametric Oscillation (OPO).<br>
The invention can be also applied to intracavity Third and Fourth Harmonic Generation<br>
as well as for intracavity Raman Frequency Shifting (RFS).<br>
In a non-linear frequency conversion process the efficiency for conversion of laser<br>
power at a fundamental frequency into power at combined frequencies (for example,<br>
the second harmonic frequency) is strongly dependent on the intensity of radiation<br>
interacting with the non-linear optical material (non-linear crystals). In practice,<br>
interacting intensities within a range of 106 - 108 W/cm2 are needed for achieving<br>
practically significant conversion efficiencies, even for the best non-linear crystals<br>
known. To increase the interacting intensity it is common to focus the radiation incident<br>
upon the non-linear crystal.<br>
In the case of continuous wave (CW) lasers of low and moderate powers an increase of<br>
the intensity by focusing is still not enough for obtaining reasonable conversion<br>
efficiencies, and a further enhancement of laser light intensity inside the non-linear<br>
crystal remains necessary. This can be achieved by placing the non-linear crystal within<br>
the laser cavity, where radiation power is increased compared with the power available<br>
from outside the cavity of the same laser, providing power enhancement inside the<br>
crystal by tens or even hundreds of times. Such schemes are discussed in, for example,<br>
W. Koechner, "Solid-State Laser Engineering", Third Edition, Springer-Verlag, 1992.<br>
However, such an intracavity arrangement (for example, for SHG or OPO), which<br>
provides a satisfactory condition for interaction within the non-linear crystal, generally<br>
does not allow for high efficiency of a laser system as whole This is because the<br>
condition for large enhancement of the fundamental frequency power inside the laser<br>
cavity is at variance with the condition for maximum extraction of the power available<br>
from the laser at a particular level of pump power supplied to the laser<br>
For maximum out-coupling of the generated power from the laser the useful cavity loss<br>
needs to be of a certain (optimal) value that increases with increase of pump power.<br>
The cavity loss comprises two parts, the first part being the useful loss due to the laser<br>
output and the second part being an internal (also called useless) cavity loss as the<br>
result of inevitable power dissipation from the laser cavity due to scattering, re-<br>
absorption, residual reflection and/or transmission by cavity components, and other<br>
factors. For effective interaction inside the non-linear crystal the power enhancement<br>
factor always needs to be high. This can be achieved by decreasing the cavity loss to a<br>
value as small as reasonably possible, which, however, results in the condition for out-<br>
coupling the laser power straying from its optimum value.<br>
As a result of the relationship between the intracavity power enhancement and optimal<br>
power extraction from the laser cavity, the overall efficiency of intracavity SHG (or<br>
other intracavity frequency conversion processes such as OPO) with respect to pump<br>
power applied to the laser is low, usually far below 10%.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above intracavity arrangement for frequency conversion of<br>
laser radiation is high sensitivity of the laser output to small environmental changes,<br>
thermal effects, scattering by air, and the like. As the cavity loss is kept at a small<br>
value, small external disturbances can noticeably change the balance between the useful<br>
and internal loss of the laser cavity, leading to a strong variation of the laser output.<br>
This decreases the laser stability and necessitates stabilisation measures and tight<br>
tolerances in the laser components used.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to eliminate or reduce one or more of the above<br>
disadvantages of the intracavity frequency conversion of laser radiation, in particular<br>
(but not exclusively) for intracavity SHG and intracavity OPO, providing improvement<br>
of overall laser system efficiency and stability.<br>
The inventor has established a new concept for intracavity frequency conversion, the<br>
concept termed Double ENhanced IntraCAvity Frequency Conversion (DENICAFC)<br>
and, in particular but not exclusively, Double ENhanced IntraCAvity Frequency<br>
Doubling (DENICAFD) that is based on using a complex cavity capable of enhancing<br>
power interacting with the non-linear crystal in two steps (double enhancement) with<br>
respect to the power available from outside the laser cavity.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a laser device with<br>
frequency conversion, the device comprising a complex optical cavity comprising two<br>
cavity parts with first and second different levels of circulating intracavity power<br>
wherein at least one non-linear crystal is placed within the cavity part of higher<br>
circulating power and an active medium in the cavity part of lower circulating power.<br>
The advantage of achieving power enhancement in two steps, with the total<br>
enhancement factor being the product of the enhancement factors in each step, is that it<br>
provides additional freedom in design allowing both the condition for high<br>
enhancement of the interacting laser power inside the intracavity non-linear crystal and<br>
the condition for maximum power output from the laser to be satisfied simultaneously.<br>
These two steps of enhancement will now be explained in more detail.<br>
In said complex optical cavity the first cavity part provides the initial step of power<br>
enhancement and comprises at least a laser cavity back mirror, highly reflective about a<br>
laser radiation fundamental frequency ?, and an active (gain) medium.<br>
The first cavity part may also include polarisation and/ or wavelength selectors. The<br>
first cavity part may also include cavity loss modulators, for example as used for Q-<br>
switching. There will generally be provided suitable pumping means for the active<br>
(gain) medium.<br>
It will be understood that the term "active (gain) medium" refers to any suitable laser<br>
material, in particular but not necessarily a solid state (for example crystalline, glassy,<br>
semiconductor, semiconductor compound such as Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting<br>
Laser - VCSEL - structures , etc.) laser material that, being pumped or excited<br>
appropriately, is capable of amplifying and emitting radiation within a certain spectral<br>
range.<br>
The second cavity part of the complex cavity comprises a resonant reflector<br>
incorporating at least one non-linear crystal. As a result of having an optical non-<br>
Jinearity built-in this cavity part functions as a non-linear resonant reflector at the laser<br>
fundamental frequency, ?. The backward reflectivity of the non-linear resonant<br>
reflector, with respect to radiation incident upon it from the first cavity part, is self-<br>
regulated by the presence of a non-linear crystal to be as close to the optimal value for<br>
out-coupling the fundamental frequency power circulating within the first cavity part.<br>
Placing a non-linear optical medium for frequency conversion within a resonant<br>
reflector layout makes use of the power enhancing property of the resonant cavity part.<br>
This also gives rise to and use of an additional feature of the resonant reflector, namely,<br>
self regulation of its backward reflectivity at the fundamental frequency co close to the<br>
optimal value with regard to power out-coupling from the first part of the laser cavity.<br>
Thus the second part of the laser cavity as described above, being the non-linear<br>
resonant reflector, provides the second step of power enhancement for intracavity<br>
frequency conversion, and at the same time performs as an optimal output coupler,<br>
therefore allowing for maximum extraction of power. The self regulation property<br>
results in improved stability and more relaxed tolerances in manufacture and/or<br>
alignment of cavity components.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, suitable for intracavity frequency conversion, said<br>
second cavity part of said complex optical cavity is formed by two end mirrors, highly<br>
reflective about the fundamental laser radiation frequency co, and a beamsplitter mirror,<br>
partially transmitting/reflecting about the fundamental laser radiation frequency co,<br>
wherein all three minors are arranged in a configuration to provide resonant reflection<br>
backward to the first cavity part, and incorporates a non-linear element within the<br>
optical path between the beamsplitter and one of said end mirrors.<br>
The frequency conversion may include processes such as second, third and fourth<br>
harmonic generation, optical parametric oscillation and intracavity Raman frequency<br>
shifting.<br>
In addition to the above reflectivity conditions about the laser radiation fundamental<br>
frequency ? for the mirrors of the second cavity part comprising the non-linear<br>
resonant reflector part of the complex optical cavity, the reflectivity of these mirrors<br>
about a combined frequency (for example the second harmonic, or OPO generated, or<br>
Raman shifted frequency) can be chosen so as to output the laser radiation power at<br>
said combined frequency in desired direction(s).<br>
For the case of uni-directional output, one of the end mirrors of the non-linear resonant<br>
reflector part is made highly reflective at the combined frequency, while at least one of<br>
the beamsplitter and the second end mirror at the combined frequency is made<br>
relatively transmissive, dependent on the desired direction of the output power<br>
In another preferred embodiment, suitable for intracavity frequency tripling and<br>
quadrupling, said second cavity part of the laser cavity as described above incorporates<br>
two non-linear crystals, one phase-matched for SHG (? + ?) and another phase-<br>
matched for tripling (? + 2?) or quadrupling (2? + 2?), wherein in addition to the<br>
reflectivity conditions about the laser radiation fundamental frequency co ail three<br>
mirrors of the second cavity part of the laser cavity also can be highly reflective about<br>
the frequency 2? to enhance the second harmonic power within the non-linear crystals<br>
as well. The choice for reflectivity of these mirrors at the third or fourth harmonic<br>
remains dependent on the desired direction of the output<br>
The back mirror of said first cavity part may be fabricated on the appropriate end of the<br>
active (gain) medium.<br>
The complex cavity is preferably configured so as to maximise laser output, and hence<br>
to maximise the laser efficiency with respect to the pump power supplied to the gain<br>
medium. The complex cavity is preferably configured so as to provide minimal<br>
sensitivity of output power to cavity loss variations caused by external disturbances.<br>
The mirror curvatures of first and second parts of the complex laser cavity can be<br>
chosen and the mirrors configured so as to match the transverse and longitudinal mode<br>
structure of the laser beam within the complex cavity.<br>
There is further provided a method of laser radiation frequency conversion in<br>
accordance with the apparatus as described above.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a known laser cavity layout commonly used for intracavity SHG;<br>
Figure 2 shows a laser cavity configuration suitable for double enhanced intracavity<br>
frequency doubling according to one embodiment of the invention,<br>
Figure 3 shows an alternative cavity configuration suitable for double enhanced<br>
intracavity frequency doubling;<br>
Figure 4 shows a laser cavity configuration suitable for double enhanced, intracavity<br>
frequency tripling or quadrupling.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 shows a layout of laser cavity principal optical components previously<br>
proposed for intracavity frequency doubling, where the cavity back mirror 20, active<br>
(gain) medium 21, non-linear crystal 30, and mirror 31 comprise a linear type (as<br>
opposed to a ring geometry) laser cavity, folded by cavity folding mirror 32 for<br>
allowing uni-directional extraction of generated power at frequency 2? (second<br>
harmonic). The waved arrow 34 indicates that an appropriate pump of the active<br>
medium 21 is arranged. In such a layout all three mirrors 20, 32, and 31 are made<br>
highly reflective at the laser fundamental frequency. Commonly, the reflectivity of<br>
these mirrors are made as close to 100% as technologically possible by mirror<br>
manufacturers. For uni-directional extraction of second harmonic power the mirror 31<br>
is also made highly reflective at frequency 2?, while the folding mirror 32 is made as<br>
transparent as possible at frequency 2?. Thus the cavity resonates and enhances the<br>
circulating laser power at the fundamental frequency ?. Power at a combined frequency<br>
of 2?, being the combined frequency generated by non-linear interaction within the<br>
crystal 30, is ejected as indicated by path 36 via the folding mirror 32, after each<br>
"forward-backward" (round-trip) passing through non-linear crystal 30<br>
In this scheme the only useful loss of the generated fundamental frequency power is by<br>
non-linear conversion into the second harmonic power by the non-linear crystal 30, and<br>
is usually less than 1% per cavity round-trip in the case of continuous wave (CW)<br>
lasers of small or moderate powers (in the range of milliwatts to a few watts). Despite<br>
careful measures to minimise the internal cavity loss by using anti-reflection (AR)<br>
coatings at the non-linear crystal and active medium end surfaces and forming the<br>
cavity mirror 20 onto the rear surface 38 of the laser gain medium 21, the remaining<br>
reflections of AR-coated surfaces and residual transmission of the cavity mirrors at the<br>
fundamental frequency ?, along with cavity diffraction loss, scattering and re-<br>
absorption inside the active medium and non-linear crystal, introduce a significant<br>
useless loss of the generated fundamental power that can be comparable and even in<br>
excess of 1 % per cavity round trip. As a result, the total cavity loss is dominated by the<br>
internal (useless) part therefore making overall laser efficiency rather small with<br>
respect to the pump power and very sensitive to any outside disturbances.<br>
Figure 2 shows an embodiment of an apparatus for implementing a method of what we<br>
shall term double enhanced intracavity frequency doubling (DENICAFD). The first<br>
part of a complex cavity comprises as before the cavity back mirror 20, with high<br>
reflectivity at the laser fundamental frequency ?, and active (gain) medium 21 It may<br>
also include other optical elements such as polarisation and/or wavelength selectors 40,<br>
42, and cavity loss modulator 44. The cavity back mirror 20 can also be deposited onto<br>
the rear surface 38 of the active medium 21. The waved arrow 34 in the drawing<br>
indicates that an appropriate pump of the active medium 21 is arranged<br>
The second part of the laser cavity makes up the non-linear resonant reflector and<br>
comprises two end mirrors 45 and 46, highly reflective at the laser fundamental<br>
frequency ?, a beamsplitter mirror 48 being partially reflective at the frequency ?, and<br>
a non-linear crystal 30 of an appropriate orientation to provide the phase matching<br>
condition for frequency doubling. To achieve the highest efficiency of the laser, the<br>
reflectivity of the mirrors 20, 45 and 46 should be made as close to 100% as<br>
technologically possible at the required fundamental laser frequency, ?. The<br>
appropriate partial reflectivity value of the beamsplitter mirror 48 is any value lying<br>
within some range around the reflectivity that would be chosen for an oplimal output<br>
coupler, if such a coupler were to be used (instead of the non-linear resonant reflector)<br>
simply to extract maximum power from the laser at the fundamental frequency. The<br>
skilled person is familiar with the criteria for establishing the optimal reflectivity for<br>
such an arrangement.<br>
In the cavity layout of Figure 2 the non-linear crystal 30 is shown, by way of example<br>
only, within the non-linear resonant reflector path between the mirrors 48 and 45, that<br>
is, angled to the optical axis of the first part of the cavity The non-linear crystal can be<br>
also placed in the path between the mirrors 46 and 48. There is no specific restriction<br>
on choosing the angle (for example 90°) of folding the non-linear resonant reflector<br>
part of the laser cavity with respect to the optical axis of the first cavity part, (and<br>
accordingly, the angle of tilting the beamsplitter mirror 48) except those dictated by<br>
convenience of design and alignment.<br>
With the above reflectivities of the laser cavity mirrors the fundamental frequency<br>
power circulating inside the cavity of Figure 2 has two different levels' a lower level<br>
within the cavity path between the cavity back mirror 20 and beamsplitter mirror 48,<br>
and a higher level within the non-linear resonant reflector path between the mirrors 46,<br>
48 and 45. The lower level, however, is already an enhanced level of the fundamental<br>
frequency power as compared with what it would be outside the laser cavity. Thus, for<br>
the non-linear crystal being placed within the non-linear resonant reflector part of the<br>
laser cavity there are two stages of enhancement of the fundamental frequency power.<br>
Due to the optical non-linearity being incorporated within the resonant reflector, the<br>
backward reflectivity (in the direction of the cavity back mirror 20) is self regulated to<br>
be close to the optimal value for out-coupling the fundamental frequency power that is<br>
circulating within first part of the laser cavity This provides the condition for the<br>
maximum second harmonic output with respect to the pump power supplied to the<br>
active (gain) medium and hence the optimum laser efficiency, and provides minimal<br>
sensitivity of the laser output to the laser cavity internal loss variations due to external<br>
disturbances and limited spec tolerances of the laser cavity components.<br>
To arrange for the uni-directional output of the second harmonic power from the laser,<br>
the reflectivitities of the mirrors 45, 48 and 46 at the frequency 2? must be chosen<br>
appropriately. In the case as shown in Figure 2, for example, the mirror 45 is also<br>
highly reflective at 2? and the beamsplitter mirror 48 is highly transmittive at 2?<br>
Hence, the second harmonic output power is directed as shown by path 36.<br>
Alternatively, for the second harmonic power to be output through the mirror 46, the<br>
latter should be highly transmittive at the frequency 2?, while both the mirror 45 and<br>
the beamsplitter mirror 48 should be highly reflective at 2?.<br>
Figure 3 shows an alternative laser cavity layout for the implementation of double<br>
enhanced intracavity frequency doubling. The requirement for the cavity minor's<br>
reflectivities at the laser fundamental frequency are the same as in the case of the layout<br>
of Figure 2, except for the reflectivity value of the beamsplitter mirror 48. The<br>
reflectivity of mirror 48, for optimal performance of the laser at the fundamental<br>
frequency ?, must in this case be approximately equal to the transmission of the<br>
beamsplitter mirror 48 of the layout of Figure 2. There are no specific restrictions either<br>
with regard to choosing the angle between optical axis of first and second parts of the<br>
cavity, or with regard to in which path of the second part of the cavity (resonant<br>
reflector) to place a non-linear crystal. Again, as in the case of the layout shown in<br>
Figure 2, the reflectivities of the mirrors 45, 48 and 46 at the second harmonic<br>
frequency 2? are chosen appropriately to provide uni-directional second harmonic<br>
output in the desired direction.<br>
In both the above cases the curvatures of the mirrors comprising the complex laser<br>
cavity and distances between them are chosen such as to match the transverse and<br>
longitudinal mode structure of the laser beam within the cavity. The criteria for this<br>
selection are familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
Figure 4 shows an extension of the cavity layout of Figure 2 for use in double enhanced<br>
intracavity frequency tripling In this case a second non-linear crystal 50, in an<br>
orientation to phase-match the sum frequency process (? + 2?), is placed within the<br>
resonant reflector part of the laser cavity. The mirrors 45, 46, and made 48 are highly<br>
reflective about the second harmonic frequency 2?, while the condition for their<br>
reflectivity about the fundamental frequency ? remains the same as in the case of<br>
Figure 2. Accordingly, for uni-directional output of the third harmonic power indicated<br>
by path 52, the mirror 45 is also highly reflective at the frequency 3? while the<br>
beamsplitter mirror 48 is highly transmitting at the frequency 3?.<br>
By choosing the phase matching conditions of the second non-linear crystal 50 in the<br>
layout of Figure 4 for further doubling the second harmonic frequency 2?, with<br>
appropriate reflectivities of the resonant reflector mirrors at the fourth harmonic<br>
frequency 4?, a double enhanced intracavity frequency quadrupling can be achieved.<br>
The skilled reader will appreciate that the invention is not limited to the specific<br>
implementations and applications detailed above. The configurations discussed above<br>
are also suitable for implementation of this invention in more general sense of what<br>
may be termed double enhanced intracavity frequency conversion (DENICAFC), for<br>
example intracavity optical parametric oscillation (OPO) or intracavity Raman<br>
frequency shifting (RFS). In such cases the phase matching conditions for a non-linear<br>
crystal as well as reflectivity of the resonant reflector mirrors have to be chosen<br>
accordingly about frequencies of the idler and signal waves (OPO) or about<br>
corresponding Stock's frequencies (RFS).<br>
