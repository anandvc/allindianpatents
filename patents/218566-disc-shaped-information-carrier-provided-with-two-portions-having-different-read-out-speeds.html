				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a disc-shaped information carrier with a substrate<br>
and an information layer which comprises optically readable elementary marks with a<br>
substantially uniform density, said information layer being provided with a first portion<br>
comprising marks to be read out at a first read-out speed and a second portion comprising<br>
marks to be read out at a second read-out speed higher than the first read-out speed.<br>
A known optically readable disc-shaped information carrier is the CD.<br>
The elementary marks of the information layer of the CD comprise tiny pits which are<br>
provided along tracks in the information layer. The density of the marks is defined by an<br>
interspacing present between the tracks and an interspacing present between the marks on a<br>
track. Besides the standard CD, which can contain an audio program of well over an hour, a<br>
high-density CD (HDCD) is known having an information layer where the interspacings<br>
present between the tracks, the interspacings present between the marks on a track, and the<br>
pits themselves are substantially smaller than on a standard CD. The amount of information<br>
which the high-density CD can accommodate is thus substantially greater than the amount of<br>
information on the standard CD.<br>
Since the available space on a high-density CD is comparatively large, the<br>
information layer of a high-density CD can be provided with more than one portion, such as,<br>
for example, a first portion and a second portion, the information of the first portion being<br>
suitable, for example, for being read out at a first read-out speed and the information of the<br>
second portion being suitable, for example, for being read out at a second read-out speed<br>
which is substantially higher than the first read-out speed. The term "read-out speed" is<br>
understood to mean the number of elementary marks to be read out per unit time, also called<br>
bit rate in the case of a CD. The read-out speed of each of the two portions is determined<br>
inter alia by the nature of the information present on each portion of the information layer.<br>
A disadvantage of a disc-shaped information carrier of the kind mentioned<br>
in the opening paragraph is that the information carrier can only be fully read out by means<br>
of an optical read-out unit which has a comparatively wide range of rotational speeds.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a disc-shaped information<br>
carrier of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph which is capable of complete read-out<br>
by means of a read-out unit whose range of rotational speeds is as limited as possible.<br>
According to the invention, the disc-shaped information carrier is for this<br>
purpose characterized in that the second portion of the information layer is at a greater<br>
distance to a center of the disc-shaped information carrier than is the first portion of the<br>
information layer. The rotational speed of the disc-shaped information carrier is determined<br>
by a quotient of the read-out speed with which the information is to be read and a distance<br>
between the information to be read and the center of the disc-shaped information carrier. As<br>
a result, the rotational speed of the information carrier is comparatively high during the read-<br>
out of information present close to the center of the information carrier and comparatively<br>
low during the read-out of information present adjacent the outer edge of the information<br>
carrier. Since the second portion of the information layer with the comparatively high,<br>
second read-out speed is at a greater distance to the center of the information carrier than is<br>
the first portion of the information layer having the comparatively low, first read-out speed,<br>
according to the invention, a difference between the rotational speed during the read-out of<br>
the first portion and the rotational speed during the read-out of the second portion is<br>
substantially reduced. As a result, the information carrier according to the invention is fully<br>
readable by means of a read-out unit having a range of rotational speeds which is as limited<br>
as possible, so that the read-out unit can be provided with an optimized drive unit.<br>
A special embodiment of a disc-shaped information carrier according to<br>
the invention is characterized in that the first portion comprises a first version of an audio<br>
recording and the second portion comprises a second version of said audio recording<br>
different from the first version. In this special embodiment, in which the available space on<br>
the information layer is utilized in an effective manner, the two portions of the information<br>
layer comprise two different versions of one and the same audio recording. A user of the<br>
information carrier thus has the possibility, for example, of choosing between two different<br>
technical versions of the audio recording, or the information carrier is suitable, for example,<br>
for use in two different types of read-out units.<br>
A further embodiment of a disc-shaped information carrier according to<br>
the invention is characterized in that the first version comprises a two-channel version of the<br>
audio recording, while the second version is a six-channel version of the audio recording.<br>
The result of this is that a user of the disc-shaped information carrier has an interesting<br>
choice, for example, between a two-channel playback and a six-channel playback of the<br>
audio recording.<br>
A yet further embodiment of a disc-shaped information carrier according to the<br>
invention is characterized in that the first portion and the second portion are provided on<br>
the information carrier by means of mutually differing transformation methods. The first<br>
portion comprises, for example, information transformed by the DSD method (bit stream<br>
method), whereas the second portion comprises, for example, information transformed<br>
by the PCM method (pulse code modulation method). As a result, the information carrier<br>
is suitable, for example, for use in two different kinds of read-out units.<br>
A special embodiment of a disc-shaped information carrier according to the<br>
invention is characterized in that the first portion and the second portion are provided on<br>
the information carrier by mutually corresponding transformation methods.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawing, in which<br>
Fig. 1 diagrammaticaliy shows a disc-shaped information carrier according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a relation between a rotational speed of a known information carrier<br>
and a distance to a center of the information carrier, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a relation between a rotational speed of the information carrier of<br>
Fig. 1 and a distance to a center of the Information carrier.<br>
The disc-shaped information carrier 1 according to the invention<br>
diagrammaticaliy shown in Fig. 1 comprises a disc-shaped, transparent, synthetic-<br>
resin substrate 3 on which a comparatively thin reflecting information layer 5 is<br>
provided, which layer comprises optically readable elementary marks. The information<br>
layer 5 is readable by means of an optical beam from a side of the substrate 3 facing<br>
away from the information layer 5. The elementary marks of the information layer 5<br>
comprises tiny pits which are provided along substantially circular tracks in the<br>
information layer 5. The information layer 5 has a substantially uniform density which<br>
is defined by an interspacing present between the consecutive tracks and an<br>
interspacing present between the elementary marks on a track. The information layer<br>
5 is readable by means of a read-out unit suitable for this purpose, which unit<br>
rotates the information carrier 1 about an axis of rotation 9 which passes through a<br>
center 7 of the information carrier 1, an optical beam generated by the read-out unit<br>
following the tracks of the information layer 5.<br>
As is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1, the information layer 5<br>
comprises a first portion 11 of optically readable marks and a second portion 13 of optically<br>
readable marks. The first portion 11 of the information layer 5 is suitable for being read out<br>
at a first read-out speed, whereas the second portion 13 of the information layer 5 is suitable<br>
for being read out at a second read-out speed which is substantially higher than the first read-<br>
out speed. The term "read-out speed" is understood to mean the number of elementary marks<br>
to be read out per unit time in order to achieve a correct playback of the information present<br>
on the information layer 5, this being subject inter alia to the nature of the information to be<br>
read out.<br>
As was mentioned above, the information carrier 1 is rotated about the<br>
axis of rotation 9 during read-out. The rotational speed ? is determined by a quotient of the<br>
read-out speed and a distance r between the information to be read and the center 7 of the<br>
information carrier 1. As a result, the rotational speed ? is comparatively high during the<br>
read-out of information close to the center of the CD (comparatively small value of r) and<br>
comparatively low during the read-out of information adjacent an outer edge of the CD<br>
(comparatively high value of r) in the case of a standard CD having a single, constant read-<br>
out speed. Fig. 2 diagrammatically shows a relation between the rotational speed ? of such a<br>
standard CD and the distance r to the center of the CD. The difference between the<br>
maximum rotational speed ?max and the minimum rotational speed ?MIN is comparatively<br>
great, so that it is only possible to read out the standard CD fully by means of a read-out<br>
unit having a sufficiently wide range of rotational speeds.<br>
As Fig. 1 shows, the second portion 13 of the information layer 5 of the<br>
information carrier 1 according to the invention is at a greater distance to the center 7 of the<br>
information carrier 1 than is the first portion 11 of the information carrier 1. Since the read-<br>
out speed of the second portion 13 is substantially higher than the read-out speed of the first<br>
portion 11, and the rotational speed of the information carrier 1 is determined by the quotient<br>
of the read-out speed and the distance between the information to be read and the center 7 of<br>
the information carrier 1, it follows that the difference between the rotational speed of the<br>
information carrier 1 during reading of the first portion 11 and the rotational speed of the<br>
information carrier 1 during reading of the second portion 13 is comparatively small. Fig. 3<br>
diagrammatically shows a relation between the rotational speed ?" of the information carrier<br>
1 according to the invention and the distance r to the center 7 of the information carrier 1.<br>
The difference between the maximum rotational speed ?"max and the minimum rotational<br>
speed ?"MIN is considerably smaller than the difference shown in Fig. 2 between the<br>
maximum rotational speed ?max the minimum rotational speed ?mIN for the standard<br>
CD. As a result, the information carrier 1 can be fully read out by means of a read-out unit<br>
which has only a limited range of rotational speeds.<br>
The first portion 11 and the second portion 13 of the information layer 5<br>
comprise, for example, a first version and a second version of one and the same audio<br>
recording, respectively. The first version corresponds, for example, to a two-channel version<br>
of the audio recording provided on the first portion 11 by the DSD transformation method<br>
(bit stream method or 1-bit oversampled audio signal method), whereas the second version<br>
corresponds, for example, to a six-channel version of the audio recording provided on the<br>
second portion 13 by the PCM transformation method (pulse code modulation method). A<br>
user of the information carrier 1 thus has a choice, for example, between the two versions of<br>
the audio recording mentioned above, or the information carrier 1 can be read out, for<br>
example, by means of two different kinds of read-out units, i.e. by means of a read-out unit<br>
suitable for reading out information transformed by the DSD transformation method and a<br>
read-out unit suitable for reading out information transformed by the PCM transformation<br>
method.<br>
In the disc-shaped information carrier 1 according to the invention as<br>
described above, the first portion 11 is suitable for being read out at a first read-out speed,<br>
while the second portion 13 is suitable for being read out at a second read-out speed which is<br>
substantially higher than the first read-out speed. It is noted that the first read-out speed and<br>
the second read-out speed themselves need not have constant or substantially constant values.<br>
Thus, for example, the first read-out speed and the second read-out speed may each have an<br>
average value, the values of the two read-out speeds being allowed to deviate from the<br>
respective average values by, for example, at most 10%.<br>
It is further noted that a disc-shaped information carrier according to the<br>
invention may alternatively be provided with more than two portions. Thus an information<br>
carrier according to the invention may be provided, for example, with three portions, a first<br>
portion provided adjacent the center of the information carrier having a comparatively low<br>
read-out speed, a third portion provided adjacent an outer edge of the information carrier<br>
having a comparatively high read-out speed, and a second portion provided between the first<br>
portion and the third portion having a read-out speed which is higher than the read-out speed<br>
of the first portion and lower than the read-out speed of the third portion.<br>
The first portion 11 of the information carrier 1 according to the invention<br>
as described above comprises a first version of an audio recording, while the second portion<br>
13 comprises a second version of the same audio recording. It is noted that the two portions<br>
of an information carrier according to the invention may also be assigned in a different<br>
manner such as, for example, an arrangement in which the first portion comprises a version<br>
of a first audio recording and the second portion a version of a second audio recording.<br>
It is finally noted that the two portions of the information carrier<br>
according to the invention may also be provided on the information carrier by one and the<br>
same transformation method such as, for example, the DSD transformation method or the<br>
PCM transformation method.<br>
We claim,<br>
1. A disc-shaped information carrier with a substrate and an information layer which comprises<br>
optically readable elementary marks with a substantially uniform density, which information<br>
layer is provided with a first portion comprising marks to be read out at a first read-out speed<br>
and a second portion comprising marks to be read out at a second read-out speed higher<br>
than the first read-out speed, wherein the second portion is at a greater distance to a center<br>
of the disc-shaped information carrier than is the first portion, and wherein the first portion<br>
comprises a first version of an audio recording and the second portion comprises a second<br>
version of the audio recording different from the first version.<br>
