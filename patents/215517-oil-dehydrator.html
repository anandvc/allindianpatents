				<td>TITLE<br>
OIL DEHYDRATOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the<br>
lubrication and hydraulic industry, and particularly to<br>
an apparatus and a process used for the removal of free,<br>
emulsified, or dissolved water from oil, and more<br>
generally, from liquids of low volatility.<br>
2. Discussion of the Related Art<br>
Oil is used in lubrication and hydraulic systems.<br>
It is widely recognized that the presence of water has<br>
deleterious effects on the oil in such systems, the<br>
components in the systems, and the operation of the<br>
systems. It is well known chat corrosion; oil<br>
oxidation, chemical wear and tear, reduced bearing<br>
fatigue life, and loss of lubricity may result when<br>
water contamination enters a lubrication or hydraulic<br>
system. These deleterious effects can be directly<br>
attributed to water present in free, emulsified or<br>
dissolved form.<br>
Consequently, significant efforts have been made to<br>
remove water from oil in order to provide optimal<br>
performance of lubrication and hydraulic systems. The<br>
devices and systems that have been used to remove water<br>
contamination include settling tanks or reservoirs,<br>
centrifuges, water absorbing filters, and vacuum<br>
dehydration oil purifiers. However, these have had<br>
significant limitations in either their water removal<br>
capabilities, ease of operation, capital costs, or<br>
operating costs, as will be discussed.<br>
Settling tanks remove bulk quantities of "free"<br>
water from oil based on the difference in their<br>
densities and gravitational settling. To be effective<br>
in removing "free" water, settling tanks require large<br><br>
residence times and a significant amount of floor space.<br>
However, they are ineffective in separating oil-water<br>
emulsions and are not capable of removing dissolved<br>
water.<br>
Centrifuges accelerate the gravitational settling<br>
of water from oil by imposing centrifugal force on the<br>
fluid that, in effect, elevates the gravitational force.<br>
Centrifuges are effective in removing free water from<br>
the oil. However, these centrifuges are generally<br>
expensive, and have limited capability of separating<br>
oil-water emulsions. They cannot remove dissolved water<br>
from the oil.<br>
Water absorbing filters use special filter media<br>
that absorbs water from the oil. As the water is<br>
absorbed, the media swells, the flow is restricted, and<br>
the pressure drop across the filter rises. When the<br>
pressure drop reaches a predetermined level, the water<br>
absorbing filter is removed, disposed of, and a new<br>
filter is installed. These water-absorbing filters are<br>
effective in removing free water but have marginal<br>
effect in removing emulsified or dissolved water from<br>
the oil. In addition, water-absorbing filters have a<br>
limited capacity for water. Therefore, they must be<br>
replaced once they are saturated with water.<br>
Consequently, they are typically only used in<br>
applications where trace amounts of water are present.<br>
In applications where water concentrations are higher,<br>
the cost of continuously replacing water-absorbing<br>
filters becomes very high.<br>
Several types of vacuum dehydration oil purifiers<br>
have been used for oil dehydration. These generally<br>
operate under the principle of vacuum distillation, mass<br>
transfer of moisture from the oil to dry air, or a<br>
combination of the two.<br>
In vacuum distillation, a vacuum is applied to<br>
reduce the boiling point of the water. For example,<br>
while the boiling point of water is 100°c (212°F) at 1013<br><br>
mm H20 (29.92"Hg) barometric pressure (standard<br>
atmospheric pressure), its boiling point at 100 mm H,0<br>
(approximately 26" Hg of vacuum) is only 50°C (122°F) .<br>
By applying a sufficient vacuum relative to the<br>
temperature of the oil, the water in the oil will<br>
evaporate from the oil into the low-pressure air<br>
(vacuum), thus dehydrating the oil.<br>
Flowing the oil into a contactor vessel which has a<br>
vacuum applied to it by means of a vacuum pump is the<br>
typical means by which this is achieved. In order to<br>
maximise the water vaporisation rare in a given vessel,<br>
large surface area-to-volume ratios of oil are<br>
preferred. This can be accomplished by means of flowing<br>
the oil over structured packing, random packing,<br>
cascading plates, spinning discs, or other methods well<br>
known in the vacuum distillation and contactor fields.<br>
The oil usually enters at the top of the contactor and<br>
flows gravitationally downward over the packing,<br>
spreading into relatively thin films. The oil collects<br>
in the bottom of the vessel where it must be pumped out<br>
by means of an oil pump. Examples of these are U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,604,109 by Koslow and U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,133,880 by Lundquist,et al. Heat may be added to the<br>
oil in order to reduce the amount of vacuum needed.<br>
Vacuum is applied to lower the water boiling point,<br>
and to increase the water removal rate. Heat may also<br>
be applied to increase the water removal rate. However,<br>
great care must be taken in not applying too much heat<br>
and/or vacuum because more and more of the lower<br>
molecular weight hydrocarbons in the oil will also be<br>
vaporized as the temperature and/or vacuum is increased<br>
to levels below their boiling points. It should be<br>
understood that any liquid with a boiling point less<br>
than water will also be removed. This may, or may not<br>
be desirable, depending upon the application.<br>
Mass transfer-based systems use similar contactor<br>
vessels. However, rather than relying on distillation<br><br>
for removal of the water, dry air or gas is continuously<br>
passed countercurrently upwards across the oil that<br>
flows downward. Water molecules in the oil will move<br>
via a concentration gradient into the relatively drier<br>
air. The now humid air is drawn from the contactor by a<br>
vacuum pump or blower and exhausted to atmosphere. It<br>
is not necessary to heat the oil more than the boiling<br>
point of water in order for the water to vaporize.<br>
Therefore, less heat and/or vacuum can be used for water<br>
removal with a mass transfer-based system than in vacuum<br>
distillation systems.<br>
While vacuum distillation and mass transfer systems<br>
do remove free, emulsified and dissolved water, they<br>
have several drawbacks that have prevented their<br>
widespread use. In both systems, liquid level controls<br>
are used within the vessel in order to ensure that the<br>
oil level does not become so low so that the oil pump<br>
runs dry. The liquid level controls also function to<br>
ensure that the oil level does not become so high that<br>
the vacuum vessel fills with oil. This would reduce or<br>
eliminate the water removal efficiency of the vessel and<br>
may even lead to the oil entirely filling the vessel and<br>
overflowing into the vacuum pump.<br>
Vacuum purifiers are also subject to foaming within<br>
the vessels as water is vaporized within the oil. This<br>
foam has a lower specific gravity than the oil and can<br>
cause malfunctioning of the liquid level controls and a<br>
reduction in the performance of the purifier.<br>
Due to the very nature of the use of heaters,<br>
controls, pumps, etc., purifiers are relatively complex<br>
pieces of equipment. In addition, the type of packing<br>
used, the viscosity of the oil, and the airflow rate,<br>
limit the flow rates through contactor vessels. This<br>
usually results in very large vessels being used<br>
relative to the amount of flow. When packaged with all<br>
of the necessary oil pumps, vacuum pumps, heaters,<br>
controls, electrical panels and connections, the system<br><br>
becomes quite large and expensive. With the number of<br>
components and complexity of these systems, the<br>
maintenance and operating costs are usually quite high<br>
as well.<br>
Due to their ability to remove free, emulsified or<br>
dissolved water from oil, vacuum dehydration oil<br>
purifiers have become the desired method for water<br>
removal from oil. However, the drawbacks associated<br>
with vacuum oil purifiers have prohibited these<br>
purifiers from being" widely used and/or are not<br>
practical on the majority of lubrication or hydraulic<br>
systems. Because of their relatively large size and<br>
costs, they are limited to non-mobile, stationary<br>
applications, and are not practical for use on mobile<br>
equipment.<br>
Due to their high capital cost, they are typically<br>
not permanently installed in a system unless it is a<br>
relatively large, expensive lubrication or hydraulic<br>
system. Instead, they are usually shared by several<br>
systems by using one to purify the oil on one machine or<br>
reservoir for a period of time, and then move it to<br>
another machine, etc. However, when the purifier is<br>
being used in this manner, the oil in the machines that<br>
are not connected to the purifier can become<br>
contaminated with water. This oil will remain<br>
contaminated until the purifier can be reattached to<br>
them and the oil dehydrated again. Thus, those skilled<br>
in the art have continued to search for better ways to<br>
remove oil from water. Applicants have directed their<br>
efforts toward membrane based systems.<br>
Membrane based systems have been used to remove<br>
water from organic systems. It must, however, be<br>
recognized that the presence of pores or defects in a<br>
membrane used for this purpose will result in the<br>
hydraulic permeation of the oil to the permeate side.<br>
This situation will result in the loss of oil. It will<br>
also allow the non-volatile oil to coat the permeate<br><br>
side of the membrane, thereby fouling the membrane and<br>
reducing its effectiveness in permeating water.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 4,857,081 to Taylor discloses a<br>
process for the dehydration of hydrocarbons or<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon gases or liquids. This process<br>
is based on a cuproammonium regenerated cellulose<br>
membrane. Cuproammonium regenerated cellulose membranes<br>
are known to those skilled in the art to have a<br>
structure of mutually connected passages or pores (U. S.<br>
patent No. 3,888,771 to Isuge et al) . These membranes<br>
are also said to have a distribution of pores of the<br>
order of 10-90 A, with a mean of 30 A (U. S. Pat. No.<br>
3,888,771 to Isuge et al, U. S. Pat. No. 5,192,440 to<br>
Sengbusch) . The mechanism for separation of water from<br>
the liquid organic phase through this cuproammonium<br>
regenerated cellulose is that of dialysis. The<br>
permeating species permeates the membrane as a liquid.<br>
Since the membrane has pores, it permits hydraulic<br>
permeation through it. Water-soluble species may<br>
permeate through it as well. This precludes its utility<br>
in the dehydration of oil, as the oil will always have a<br>
finite solubility in water.<br>
Even if Taylor were satisfactory for dehydration<br>
of oil, the structure of Taylor will itself cause<br>
defects. The molecular structure of the regenerated<br>
cellulose membranes is maintained by the presence of<br>
moisture. Upon removal of the moisture from the<br>
hydrophilic membrane, the pores-undergo large capillary<br>
stresses which can lead to, shrinkage and cracking of the<br>
membrane. Since the membranes have pores of various<br>
sizes the capillary stresses formed during drying result<br>
in differential stresses throughout the membrane<br>
microstructure. This differential stress is known to<br>
cause cracks or "defects" in the membrane. If such a<br>
membrane is used to dehydrate a closed system, the<br>
moisture in the membrane will be eventually stripped<br>
out. This results in the creation of cracks or<br><br><br>
"defects" as described above. These "defects" will now<br>
cause the hydraulic transport of oil through the<br>
membrane.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 5,182,022 to Pasternak et al<br>
discloses a pervaporation process for the dehydration of<br>
ethylene glycol. The ethylene glycol is completely<br>
miscible with water, and is characteristic of<br>
pervaporation applications where the mixtures to be<br>
separated are fully miscible. The sulfonated<br>
polyethylene resin membrane that is used permits<br>
substantial quantities of ethylene glycol to permeate.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the<br>
permeation of such quantities of ethylene glycol is due<br>
to hydraulic permeation through defects (see definition<br>
below), which are present in the discriminating layer.<br>
The invention does not require a defect-free<br>
discriminating layer because the loss of the non-aqueous<br>
phase is tolerable. This is not the case in the<br>
dehydration of oil in a lubrication and hydraulic<br>
system.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 5,464,540 to Friesen discloses a<br>
process for the removal of a component from a liquid<br>
feed mixture via the process of pervaporation. The<br>
sweep stream in the Friesen et al patent is comprised of<br>
a component of the feed stream that is not to be removed<br>
and is introduced to the module as a vapor. In column<br>
5, lines 8 to 13, Friesen et al postulates that the<br>
process can be used to dehydrate oils such as sesame oil<br>
and corn oil. However, in the examples provided in the<br>
patent, Friesen et al only provides performance data for<br>
the dehydration of organic compounds of high volatility,<br>
much in excess of sesame oil and corn oil. In<br>
particular, Friesen provides examples for the<br>
dehydration of acetone, toluene, and ethanol.<br>
Consequently, it is clear that Friesen fails to<br>
recognize and teach the need for a defect free (as<br>
described hereinbelow) non-porous membrane for the<br><br>
dehydration of these types of oils. Those skilled in<br>
the art may also question the feasibility of providing a<br>
sweep stream of corn oil or sesame oil vapor.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 5.552.023 to Zhou discloses a<br>
membrane distillation technique for the dehydration of<br>
ethylene glycol. This process employs a porous<br>
membrane. This is unattractive for the dehydration of<br>
oils because of the likelihood that the porous support<br>
will get wetted out and hydraulically permeate the<br>
fluids.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 6,001,2 57 to Bratton et al discloses<br>
a zeolite membrane that is substantially defect-free for<br>
the purpose of dehydration of various liquids. As noted<br>
in column 4, lines 12-15 of Bratton, the use of the<br>
zeolite membrane is critical to the function of the<br>
apparatus, as it can be used to separate any two liquids<br>
where only one liquid can pass through the zeolite<br>
membrane. Zeolite membranes use zeolitic-type<br>
materials, which are also known as molecular sieves, and<br>
contain a network of channels formed from silicon/oxygen<br>
tetrahedrons joined through the oxygen atoms. Column 2,<br>
lines 46-49, indicate that the material should be<br>
"substantially free of defects", without defining the<br>
extent of "substantially" or the implied meaning of<br>
"defect". Such a membrane cannot be used for the<br>
dehydration of oils because the presence of defects,<br>
described hereinbelow, will result in the hydraulic<br>
permeation of oil to the permeate side.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the<br>
following terms, as used throughout the application, are<br>
intended to convey the meanings defined hereinbelow:<br>
Definitions:<br>
"Defect", as used herein, is used to indicate an<br>
aperture through the membrane of sufficient size to<br>
allow hydraulic permeation of the liquid of low<br>
volatility through the membrane.<br><br>
"Defect free", therefore, indicates a membrane<br>
containing no apertures of sufficient magnitude to allow<br>
hydraulic permeation of liquids through the membrane,<br>
instead limiting the passage of materials through the<br>
membrane to solution diffusion. Hydraulic permeation of<br>
oil will tend to occur when permanent apertures (i.e.<br>
pinholes) of a diameter greater than or equal to the<br>
molecular size of oil are present in a membrane. It is<br>
expected chat the molecular size of the oil molecules is<br>
greater than 5 to 10 Angstroms, however since oil<br>
consists of fractions of different molecular size, the<br>
exact value will depend on the chemical makeup of the<br>
particular oil being dehydrated. Thus defect free<br>
membranes are limited to apertures of a smaller diameter<br>
than the molecular size of the oil molecules.<br>
"Non-porous" indicates membranes that do not<br>
contain what are commonly referred to as pores, that is<br>
permanent apertures of at least the molecular size of<br>
the oil molecules, which as discussed above is expected<br>
to be greater than 5 to 10 Angstroms, but absolutely<br>
dependent on the particular type of oil being<br>
dehydrated.<br>
While a defect free membrane, as used herein, is<br>
inevitably non-porous, a non-porous membrane, as used<br>
herein, is not necessarily defect free. In theory, a<br>
non-porous membrane would be one that is defect free,<br>
i.e. free from defects as described above. This implies<br>
that, a defect free membrane would have the same gas<br>
permeability/selectivity as a dense film made from the<br>
same material. In practice, however, this is not the<br>
case. For example, Pinnau and Koros (Pinnau, I. And<br>
Koros, W., "Gas-Permeation Properties of Asymmetric<br>
Polycarbonate, Polyestercarbonate, and Fluorinated<br>
Polyimide Membranes Prepared by the Generalized Dry-Wet<br>
Phase Inversion Process," J. Applied Polymer Science<br>
Vol. 46 1195-1204 (1992)) and Pesek (Pesek, S. "Aqueous<br>
Quenched Asymmetric Polysulfone Flat Sheet and Hollow<br><br>
Fiber Membranes Prepared by Dry/Wet Phase Separation"<br>
Dissertation submitted to The University of Texas at<br>
Austin (1993)) have defined a defect-free gas separation<br>
membrane as a membrane that has 75% to 85% of the<br>
perselectivity of a dense film. It can be shown that, a<br>
membrane that has 85% of the permselectivity can contain<br>
a significant number of defects that would allow for the<br>
hydraulic permeation of oil.<br>
Consider a membrane consisting of a polysulfone<br>
selective layer supported by a substructure of<br>
negligible resistance. At 35ºC, polysulfone has an<br>
oxygen permeability of 1.4 barrer (Membrane Handbook)<br>
and an O2/N2, selectivity of 5.6. Consider the thickness<br>
of the polysulfone selective layer to be 700 A. This<br>
thickness is typical for commercially available<br>
membranes. Accordingly, the permeance of this selective<br>
layer for oxygen would be 20 GPU and for nitrogen 3.57<br>
GPU. According to Pinnau and Koros (1992) this<br>
polysulfone membrane would be considered defect free if<br>
the O2/N2, selectivity was 85% of the dense film, or in<br>
this case 4.76. Obviously according to the definition<br>
of the present invention, this membrane contains<br>
defects. If the defects are small enough, the flow<br>
through the defects will be governed by knudsen<br>
diffusion. If the defects are large, then flow through<br>
the defects will be convective (or viscous) and will<br>
obey the Hagen-Poiseuille law. The table below<br>
illustrates the number of defects of different size that<br>
would result in a O2/N2, selectivity of 4.76 for a 1<br>
square meter polysulfone module.<br><br><br><br>
Knudsen Diffusion Through	Defects in		Selective Layer		<br>
Defect Diameter (A)		25		50	100<br>
Number of Defects		1.22E+1	1	1.53E+10	1.91E+9<br>
Surface Porosity (Defect Area/Total Area)		6.0E-7		3.0E-7	1.5E-7<br><br>
Convective Flow Through Defects in Selective Layer, 1 psig Applied Pressure					<br>
Defect Diameter (»m)		0.5		1	2<br>
Number of Defects		39700		247	15<br>
Surface Porosity (Defect Area/Total Area)		7.8E-10		1.9E-10	4.9E-11<br>
The average size of the defects listed in the above<br>
table are large enough to allow hydraulic permeation of<br>
oil through the defects and render a oil dehydration<br>
module commercially unviable. However, for an<br>
application such as gas separation, the presence of the<br>
defects merely reduces the efficiency of the separation<br>
but does not render the module commercially unviable.<br>
In theory, a non-porous membrane would be one that<br>
is defect free, i.e. free from defects as described<br>
above. In practice, however, this is not the case. As<br>
practiced, and as recognized by one skilled in the art,<br>
a membrane that is regarded as being non-porous will<br>
allow hydraulic permeation up to a certain factor,<br>
typically sufficient to reduce its gas selectivity by up<br>
to 85% from the intrinsic selectivity of the dense film,<br>
and will still be considered a non-porous membrane.<br>
Thus, such a membrane would actually have a relatively<br>
small but still significant number of pores. The actual<br>
number of pores that would be acceptable in a "non-<br>
porous" membrane would be related to the size of the<br>
pores and the properties of the materials being<br><br>
separated by the membranes. As used herein, the defect<br>
free membranes refer to non-porous membranes that are<br>
non-porous as defined hereinabove, and not non-porous as<br>
the term is generally used in the art. For the<br>
successful practice of the present invention, the<br>
membrane must be "non-porous" and "defect-free" as the<br>
terms are defined herein.<br>
"Oil" is used to indicate a low volatility chemical<br>
material. Typically, the oil will comprise many<br>
fractions of different molecular weight and molecular<br>
structure in a mixture.<br>
"Semi-permeable" indicates a membrane that allows<br>
permeation of certain materials while being resistant to<br>
the transport of other materials. Such a membrane can<br>
also be referred to as a discerning membrane.<br>
"Wetting" indicates the spreading of a liquid over<br>
a surface.<br>
"Fouling" indicates adding a resistance to mass<br>
transfer through an undesirable action such as filling<br>
the porous substructure of the membrane with oil, or<br>
coating the sweep side of the membrane with oil.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a membrane based<br>
process for removing free, emulsified or dissolved water<br>
from oils or other liquids of low volatility. This<br>
process is such that it may be used on mobile equipment<br>
while in operation and moving, as well as on stationary<br>
equipment and processes. The operation of this process<br>
is simple, while the equipment in question is small and<br>
compact making it practical and cost effective for<br>
systems of all sizes.<br>
The present invention further provides for a<br>
defect-free discriminating layer, or membrane, which<br>
does not permit the hydraulic permeation of liquids<br>
through it, restricting permeation to transport through<br>
the discriminating layer. The invention further<br><br>
provides for the removal of the vapors permeating<br>
through the discriminating layer. Thus, the present<br>
invention provides an apparatus and method for more<br>
efficiently separating free, emulsified and dissolved<br>
water from oil.<br>
Specifically, this invention relates to the process<br>
of using a non-porous, defect free membrane to remove<br>
water selectively from oils. More particularly, the<br>
process consists of removing water from the oil stream<br>
of concern by contacting the oil with one side ("feed<br>
side") of a semi-permeable membrane. The membrane<br>
divides a separation chamber into the feed side into<br>
which the oil is fed, and a permeate side from which the<br>
water is removed. The permeate side is maintained at a<br>
low partial pressure of water through presence of<br>
vacuum, or by use of a sweep gas. The water in the oil<br>
may be either in the dissolved form, or, as a separate<br>
phase, either emulsified, dispersed or "free." The<br>
membrane material is one that is of the appropriate<br>
chemical compatibility with the oil, while selectively<br>
permitting the transport of water across it. The<br>
membrane is chemically compatible with the oil if it<br>
does not chemically react with the oil, or if its<br>
physical properties such as size, strength,<br>
permeability, and selectivity are not adversely affected<br>
by contact with the oil.<br>
Thus, one of the objects of the present invention<br>
is to overcome the shortcomings of conventional oil<br>
dehydration techniques, and provide a new apparatus and<br>
a process for dehydrating oil that overcomes these<br>
limitations.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an<br>
oil dehydrator that removes free, emulsified or<br>
dissolved water from oils.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an oil dehydrator that is simple to operate.<br><br><br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an oil dehydrator that is relatively small and<br>
compact.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an oil dehydrator that is cost effective.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an oil dehydrator that is practical to use on<br>
small and large systems.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an oil dehydrator that may be used on mobile<br>
equipment while in operation and moving.<br>

invention will be apparent from the following<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is to be understood that the specific devices<br>
and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and<br>
described in the following description, are exemplary<br>
embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the<br>
appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other<br>
physical characteristics relating to the embodiments<br>
disclosed herein should not be considered as limiting,<br>
unless the claims expressly state otherwise.<br>
Before describing the preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, incorporated herein as if fully rewritten are<br>
the Membrane Handbook, pages 3-15, published by Van<br>
Nostrand Reinhold, 1992 and the Handbook of Industrial<br>
Membranes First Edition, pages 56-61, 1995.<br>
According to the present invention, there is an<br>
apparatus and a process with utility in the<br>
discriminating removal of water, or other highly<br>
volatile solvents, from a broad class of liquids of low<br>
volatility. A liquid of low volatility is defined as a<br>
liquid with a normal boiling point greater than that of<br>
water (100°C) . Water may thus be categorized as a liquid<br>
of high volatility. It is necessary to recognize that<br>
components that may exhibit low volatility in the pure<br>
state may behave non-ideally in a mixture. This can<br>
result in a greater apparent rate of evaporation of a<br>
component from a mixture than would be expected from<br>
pure component volatilities. Preferably, the present<br>
invention is involved in the separation of water from<br>
oil.<br>
More specifically, the process of dehydrating the<br>
oil consists of the following steps: contacting one side<br><br>
of a non-porous, defect-free, semi-permeable membrane<br>
with a liquid stream containing at least oil and water,<br>
wherein the membrane divides a separation chamber into a<br>
feed-side, into which the feed liquid mixture is fed,<br>
and a permeate side, from which the water is withdrawn;<br>
maintaining a partial chemical potential gradient for<br>
water such that the water preferentially permeates<br>
through the membrane from the feed side to the permeate<br>
side; removing, from the permeate side, the water that<br>
has permeated; and removing, from the feed side of the<br>
membrane the oil that is dehydrated. The term "chemical<br>
potential gradient" may also be referred to as an<br>
"activity gradient" or as a "partial pressure gradient.<br>
The term "partial pressure gradient" is understood to<br>
mean the difference between the water vapor pressure on<br>
the permeate side and the equilibrium water vapor<br>
pressure cirresponding to the water concentration in the<br>
oil.<br>
The device for dehydrating the oil consists of a<br>
vessel containing at least a nonporous, semi-permeable,<br>
defect-free membrane interposed in said vessel in such a<br>
fashion as to divide the interior of the vessel into at<br>
least one feed-side space and one permeate space; at<br>
least one inlet opening to the feed space; at least one<br>
outlet opening to the feed space; and at least one<br>
outlet opening to the permeate space. Such an apparatus<br>
would enable flowing the oil-water mixture in through<br>
the inlet opening, and contacting at least one side of<br>
the semi-permeable membrane; maintaining a chemical<br>
potential gradient for water such that the water<br>
preferentially permeates through the membrane from the<br>
feed side to the permeate side; removing, from the<br>
permeate side, the water that has permeated through the<br>
outlet opening; and removing from the feed side of the<br>
membrane, the oil that is dehydrated, through the outlet<br>
opening.<br><br>
The membrane can be in any form or shape as long as<br>
a surface suitable for separation is provided. Common<br>
examples of this include self-supported films, hollow<br>
fibers, composite sheets, and composite hollow fibers.<br>
The hollow fiber membranes may be potted or otherwise<br>
disposed so that the fibers are nominally parallel to<br>
each other. The fibers of the composite hollow fiber<br>
membrane or the hollow fiber membrane may be helically<br>
wound or twisted. Alternatively, the fibers may also be<br>
woven into a mat. In the case of a membrane that is<br>
composed of flat sheets or mats of fibers, the sheets or<br>
mats may be spirally wound. In addition, spacers may<br>
separate the sheets or mats.<br>
The membrane used is made, at least in part, of a<br>
thin, defect-free, dense, nonporous, discriminating<br>
layer (the term "discriminating layer" may also be<br>
referred to as "skin") and a support structure. In an<br>
alternate embodiment, the discriminating layer may be<br>
self-supporting; however, this is not required to<br>
practice the invention. To those skilled in the art, it<br>
is clear that dense, nonporous, discriminating layers<br>
may have defects in the discriminating layer. When such<br>
a discriminating layer is used for separating a mixture<br>
of gases, or of liquids, non-discriminating transport<br>
may occur through these defects. In the case of such a<br>
discriminating layer used to separate a gas mixture, the<br>
transport through the discriminating layer occurs by<br>
"solution-diffusion", whereas transport through the<br>
defects occur by Knudsen diffusion. This has been<br>
documented by Clausi Clausi, N. "Formation and<br>
Characterization of Asymmetric Polyimide Hollow Fiber<br>
Membranes for Gas Separation" Dissertation submitted to<br>
The University of Texas at Austin (1998). When such a<br>
defect-containing discriminating layer is used to<br>
separate a mixture of liquids, non-discriminating<br>
hydraulic transport will occur through these defects.<br>
The hydraulic permeation through these defects will<br><br>
result in liquid permeation to the permeate side of the<br>
membrane. While such non-discriminating transport is<br>
acceptable in some applications, it is not acceptable in<br>
other uses.<br>
An example of a defect-free, dense, nonporous<br>
discriminating layer is that of a solution cast dense<br>
membrane. These membranes are very well known in to<br>
those skilled in the art. A defect-free, dense,<br>
nonporous discriminating layer with a dehydration rate<br>
that is commercially viable, may be made by solution<br>
casting such films with a sufficiently thin thickness as<br>
to permit the desired dehydration rate. Potential<br>
defects may be eliminated by multiple coats of the<br>
solution cast polymer, with intermediate cross-linking<br>
steps.<br>
In the specific instance of oil dehydration, the<br>
hydraulic permeation of oil to the permeate side will<br>
result in the loss of oil from the system, rendering the<br>
dehydrator commercially non-viable, and will result in<br>
the fouling of the permeate side of the membrane. If<br>
the discriminating layer is supported on the permeate<br>
side, the hydraulically permeated oil will fill the<br>
porous support and foul the membrane by offering a<br>
resistance to the transport of water. Further, since<br>
the oil is unlikely to evaporate, or if evaporation does<br>
occur, it will not evaporate faster than the rate of<br>
hydraulic permeation through the defects, the presence<br>
of defects will irreversibly foul the membrane and<br>
reduce the rate of dehydration. Further, if the<br>
membrane is not completely defect-free, the sweep that<br>
may be used on the permeate side to sweep away the<br>
moisture may pass through the membrane and thus be<br>
entrained in the "clean" oil. This may create foam in<br>
the oil, and is thus undesirable.<br>
The mechanism of transport through such a the<br>
defect-free, dense, nonporous discriminating layer is<br>
through "solution-diffusion." To those skilled in the<br><br>
art, the term "solution-diffusion" is understood to mean<br>
the dissolution of the permeating species into the<br>
discriminating layer, followed by diffusion through the<br>
discriminating layer, followed by de-sorption on the<br>
permeate face of the discriminating layer. The oil and<br>
water exist in the liquid phase on the feed side of the<br>
membrane, whereas, the permeated species are removed<br>
from the permeate face of the discriminating layer in<br>
the vapor, or gas phase. If the discriminating layer<br>
contains any defects, hydraulic permeation will occur<br>
through the discriminating layer resulting in the<br>
transport of liquids to the permeate side. As described<br>
above, this situation will foul the membrane and result<br>
in the loss of oil from the system, both leading to a<br>
commercially non-viable product.<br>
Pervaporation, to those skilled in the art, is<br>
understood to mean the separation of a mixture of<br>
liquids that are completely miscible through a dense,<br>
nonporous discriminating layer. Further, pervaporation<br>
is understood to mean that the components permeate<br>
through the discriminating layer at a finite rate and<br>
are removed on the permeate side as a vapor. Further,<br>
in the case of pervaporative dehydration, in the event<br>
of a defective discriminating layer, the hydraulic<br>
transport of the non-aqueous phase to the permeate side<br>
is not catastrophic. This is because the non-aqueous<br>
phase has a high vapor pressure and is easily<br>
evaporated. This is the case even for low volatility<br>
components such as ethylene glycol which when mixed with<br>
water can exhibit significant non-expected behavior<br>
compared to the pure component.<br>
Porous membranes such as those used for micro-<br>
filtration, ultra-filtration, and dialysis are not<br>
suitable, as the low volatility fluid will permeate the<br>
pores, and foul the membrane.<br>
Included as suitable membranes are dense, nonporous<br>
polymer films or asymmetric membranes with relatively<br><br>
dense discriminating layers, or skins, on one, or both,<br>
surfaces of a support structure. Dense, nonporous<br>
membranes are made either by "phase inversion," or by<br>
"solution casting." In the case of phase inversion, a<br>
polymer-solvent-nonsolvent system is forced to<br>
precipitate by evaporating the solvent, extracting the<br>
solvent, or introducing nonsolvent into the system.<br>
Phase inversion results in a non-homogeneous, porous<br>
polymer matrix which may or may not be symmetric, and<br>
which may or may not have a region of dense, nonporous<br>
polymer. A dense, nonporous discriminating layer may be<br>
formed by phase separation by the appropriate choice of<br>
solvent-nonsolvent systems and precipitation systems.<br>
In the case of solution casting, a suitable polymer-<br>
solvent system is permitted to gel and then dry.<br>
Solution cast polymers are typically not porous and are<br>
homogenous films. In both cases, the dense, nonporous<br>
film may be formed on another support structure. The<br>
dense, nonporous discriminating layer formed by both<br>
methods is likely to have defects (U. S. Pat. No.<br>
4,230,463). Methods to post treat these discriminating<br>
layers to reduce defects substantially have also been<br>
reported by Henis and Tripodi (Henis, J. and Tripodi,<br>
M., "Composite Hollow Fiber Membranes for Gas<br>
Separation: The Resistance Model Approach, " J. Membr.<br>
Sci. (8) 233-245 (1981)). These methods to reduce these<br>
defects involve repeatedly coating the defective<br>
membrane until all the defects are eliminated. The<br>
secondary coat may be based on the same polymer as the<br>
original layer, or based on a different polymer.<br>
A defect-free, dense, nonporous, discriminating layer<br>
may be formed by solution casting a sufficiently thick<br>
homogenous polymer film. It has also been demonstrated<br>
by Pfromm that ultra-thin, defect-free, dense, nonporous<br>
discriminating layers may be formed (Pfromm, P. H. "Gas<br>
transport properties and aging of thin and thick films<br><br>
made from amorphous glassy polymers" Dissertation<br>
submitted to The University of Texas at Austin (1994)).<br>
The transport characteristics of gases through a<br>
defect-free, dense, nonporous, homogeneous polymer film,<br>
to those skilled in the art, is typically considered an<br>
"intrinsic" property of the polymer (Clausi, 1998) . The<br>
intrinsic permeability of the polymer, for example, is<br>
independent of the thickness of the discriminating<br>
layer. If such a discriminating layer is used to<br>
separate a mixture of gases, and the layer is either a<br>
free standing film, or a composite on a support with<br>
negligible transport resistance compared to the<br>
discriminating layer, the ratio of the permeabilities of<br>
the specific mixture is also an intrinsic property of<br>
the polymer under these specified conditions. This<br>
ratio is called the intrinsic selectivity of the polymer<br>
to the specified gas components.<br>
If the dense, nonporous, discriminating layer does<br>
not exhibit the "intrinsic" selectivity to a particular<br>
combination of gases, it is likely that this<br>
discriminating layer contains defects. This is because<br>
the defects permit non-discriminating transport of the<br>
components to be separated. This technique is commonly<br>
used, by those skilled in the art, to determine the<br>
presence of defects in discriminating layers, when the<br>
porous support offers negligible resistance to flow<br>
(Clausi, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,422). This technique<br>
may be used to determine the presence or absence of<br>
defects regardless of the mechanism of formation of the<br>
discriminating layer. If it is verified that the<br>
discriminating layer is defect free, it will not permit<br>
the non-discriminating transport of gases or liquids,<br>
and in the case of liquid permeation, the permeating<br>
species will de-sorb from the membrane as a vapor.<br>
The thin, dense, nonporous discriminating layer may<br>
be a separate layer. It may also be formed at nominally<br>
the same time, and integrally with, the support<br><br>
structure. It may consist of the same material as the<br>
support structure, or a different material in a<br>
composite form. The composite membrane has a dense<br>
layer that is attached to the support structure. The<br>
dense, nonporous, discriminating layer may be formed as<br>
a separate step at a later time. These composite films,<br>
fibers, or sheets may be porous or nonporous. The<br>
sheets, preferably, are flat, though this is not<br>
required to practice the invention. These fibers, films<br>
or sheets may be potted on one or more sides to separate<br>
the feed from the permeate space. The discriminating<br>
layer in such a membrane may be identical to or<br>
different from the support structure that may be<br>
composed of porous organic or inorganic polymer, ceramic<br>
or glass. The preferred embodiment would be a composite<br>
sheet or composite hollow fiber with a thin, dense,<br>
nonporous, discriminating layer of polymer on one or<br>
both faces of the support. In the case of a symmetric<br>
or asymmetric membrane, the liquid may contact the<br>
membrane on either side, although the preferred<br>
embodiment would be the one that minimizes the boundary<br>
layer on the feed side.<br>
The dense nonporous layer, or skin, may also be an<br>
integral part of the membrane and formed at least<br>
nominally at the same time as the support structure.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to forming the<br>
dense nonporous layer at the same time as the support<br>
structure. The invention may also be practiced by<br>
forming the dense nonporous layer as a component (a.k.a.<br>
composite part) of the membrane. The dense nonporous<br>
layer may be formed at a different time than the support<br>
structure. In this case, the dense nonporous layer is<br>
subsequently attached to the support structure.<br>
The support structure may be porous or nonporous.<br>
The dense nonporous skin, or the support structure, may<br>
be polymeric in nature. The dense nonporous skin, or<br>
support structure, may be an inorganic or organic<br><br>
polymer. The polymer may be a linear polymer, a<br>
branched polymer, a crosslinked polymer, a cyclolinear<br>
polymer, a ladder polymer, a cyclomatrix polymer, a<br>
copolymer, a terpolymer, a graft polymer, or a blend<br>
thereof.<br>
The liquid of low volatility may wet the porous<br>
support structure. Alternatively, the porous support<br>
structure may be treated so that the liquid of low<br>
volatility does not wet the structure. However, this is<br>
not required to practice the invention. The invention<br>
may still be practiced when the porous support structure<br>
is not wetted with the liquid of low volatility.<br>
Furthermore, the invention may still be practiced when<br>
the porous support structure is treated such that the<br>
structure is not wetted with the liquid of low<br>
volatility. Preferably, the porous support structure is<br>
of such a nature that the low volatility liquid does not<br>
wet the structure.<br>
In the situation wherein the membrane consists of a<br>
dense, nonporous layer, or skin, on only one side, the<br>
presence of defects in the dense, nonporous layer would<br>
likely result in passage of the oil, as discussed above.<br>
If the oil hydraulically permeates through the membrane<br>
it will likely evaporate at a slower rate than the<br>
water, or not at all, thus fouling the membrane and<br>
reducing dehydration rates. Consequently, the preferred<br>
embodiment would be one that has a defect free, dense,<br>
nonporous, discriminating layer, or skin, on one or both<br>
sides of the porous support structure. It is necessary<br>
to have a defect free, dense, nonporous, discriminating<br>
layer so that the oil cannot hydraulically permeate<br>
through defects in the discriminating layer. An<br>
advantage of having a defect free, dense, nonporous,<br>
discriminating layer on both sides of the porous<br>
structure is that the potential of hydraulic transport<br>
of the oil is diminished further.<br><br><br>
In the case of hollow fibers, the feed may contact<br>
the membrane in the bore of the fiber, or on the outside<br>
of the fiber. The preferred embodiment would be the one<br>
where the liquid is fed on the outside to provide lower<br>
operating pressure drop.<br>
The discriminating layer, or skin, may be composed<br>
of any family of polymers that is chemically compatible<br>
with the feed as long as the dense, nonporous layer does<br>
not permit the transport of the oil in substantial<br>
quantities. The discriminating layer, or skin, is<br>
chemically compatible with the oil if it does not<br>
chemically react with the oil, or if its physical<br>
properties such as size, strength, permeability, and<br>
selectivity are not adversely affected by contact with<br>
the oil. The dense, nonporous layer may be composed of<br>
polymers including, but not restricted to, polymers such<br>
as polyimides, polysulfones, polycarbonates, polyesters,<br>
polyamides, polyureas, poly(ether-amides), amorphous<br>
Teflon, polyorganosilanes, alkyl celluloses and<br>
polyolefins.<br>
The liquid may be contacted with the membrane in a<br>
countercurrent, co-current, crossflow, or radial<br>
crossflow configuration. The flow may be such that<br>
either, none, or both streams {i.e., feed and permeate)<br>
are well mixed or unmixed. The feed stream is<br>
preferably well mixed.<br>
The liquid stream containing the low volatility<br>
liquid (e.g. oil) and the water may be fed into the<br>
vessel to contact the defect-free, dense, nonporous<br>
layer of the membrane. However, the operation of the<br>
invention is not limited to feeding the liquid into the<br>
vessel to contact the dense nonporous layer. The<br>
invention may also be practiced by feeding the liquid<br>
into the vessel to contact the membrane on the side<br>
without the dense nonporous layer or skin.<br>
The water partial pressure on the permeate side may<br>
be reduced by the application of vacuum, or by the use<br><br>
of a sweep gas with a low water vapor partial pressure,<br>
such as carbon dioxide, argon, hydrogen, helium,<br>
nitrogen, methane, or preferably air. The permeate<br>
flow, including the sweep, is preferably in the<br>
countercurrent, crossflow or radial crossflow mode. The<br>
pressure of the permeate may be equal to or less than<br>
the pressure of the feed.<br>
Alternatively, the pressure of the permeate may be<br>
greater than the pressure of the feed. An example of<br>
when the pressure of the permeate is greater than the<br>
pressure of the feed would be when the permeate is<br>
removed by a sweep gas. The sweep gas may be comprised<br>
of dehydrated compressed air or nitrogen such that the<br>
pressure on the permeate side is greater than the<br>
pressure on the feed side of the vessel. Typically in<br>
this scenario, the activity of the high volatility<br>
liquid being removed from the feed is locally greater on<br>
the feed side than on the permeate side.<br>
With membrane based oil dehydration, it is<br>
preferable to filter the incoming fluid. Filtration may<br>
be used to remove particulate matter or bulk water<br>
entrained in the stream. Any of the techniques known in<br>
the art to filter a fluid is suitable. This can prevent<br>
the destruction of the discriminating layer by<br>
particulate matter entrained in this stream.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the membrane consists<br>
of a hollow fiber with a dense, defect-free, nonporous<br>
discriminating layer on one or both sides of the porous<br>
support structure. In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
feed side boundary layer is minimized. In addition, in<br>
the preferred embodiment, the pressure drop across the<br>
feed side is minimized. The permeated water may be<br>
withdrawn, from the permeate side, by means of a vacuum<br>
or a sweep. This water will be in the vapor, or gas,<br>
phase. The sweep may be in the form of a gas or a<br>
liquid. In addition, the sweep may have a lower<br><br>
activity for water than that of the low volatility<br>
liquid.<br>
This device may be applied in situations where<br>
vacuum purifiers and other conventional dehydrators are<br>
used. This process or device may be used to treat oil<br>
in a "kidney-loop" system, where the oil dehydrator is<br>
connected to a reservoir that is part of a piece of<br>
equipment. The oil is withdrawn from the process<br>
reservoir, processed through the dehydrator, and then<br>
returned to the reservoir. The oil dehydrator may be<br>
operated continuously or intermittently while the main<br>
system is operating, or while it is at rest. This<br>
device may also be used "off-line" to treat the fluid in<br>
a reservoir. This reservoir is not connected to any<br>
piece of operating equipment and serves as a container<br>
for conditioning the fluid.<br>
In addition to conventional applications, this<br>
device may be used "in-line". Since the feed and<br>
permeate spaces are separated by a dense, nonporous<br>
barrier, it is possible to operate the device such that<br>
the feed and permeate are at different pressures.<br>
Consequently, the device may be operated in such a way<br>
that the oil is at the pressure of the system in which<br>
it is used. Consequently, this opens the possibility of<br>
using such a device and process "in-line," which is the<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention. The need for<br>
conventional off-line or kidney-loop systems is reduced<br>
and may be eliminated. Being able to use the present<br>
invention in-line and at system pressure allows it to be<br>
compact and lightweight and useful on virtually ail<br>
hydraulic or lubrication equipment. It can, also, be<br>
used on stationary or mobile equipment since additional<br>
power; pumps and controls are not required.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein like<br>
numerals refer to the same elements, Fig. 1 is a flat<br>
sheet embodiment of a semi-permeable membrane 18. The<br>
membrane 18 includes the non-porous, defect-free,<br><br><br>
discriminating layer, or skin, 22 and the support<br>
structure 24. The discriminating layer or skin 22 may<br>
be present on either, or both, sides of the support<br>
structure 24.<br>
Referring to Figs. 13-14, a modification of the<br>
semi-permeable membrane 18 is shown wherein the<br>
discriminating layer or skin 22 is formed integrally<br>
with the support structure 24 by methods known in the<br>
membrane art. As before, the discriminating layer or<br>
skin 22 may be present on either, or both, sides of the<br>
support structure 24.<br>
In Fig. 2, two flat sheet semi-permeable membranes<br>
18 are separated by a plurality of feed channel spacers<br>
34. The spacers 34 may be made or formed of a variety<br>
of materials well known in the art, including potting<br>
compounds. Each membrane 18 has skin 22 and support<br>
structure 24. Permeate collection spacer 25, which is<br>
constructed to prevent the feed and permeate streams<br>
from mixing, is interposed between membrane 18 and<br>
spacers 34. Membranes 18 are separated by feed channel<br>
spacers 34.<br>
Depicted in Fig. 3 is a hollow fiber embodiment of<br>
the semi-permeable membrane 20. In this embodiment,<br>
hollow fiber membrane 20 includes the discriminating<br>
layer 22 and the support structure 24. The<br>
discriminating layer may be on the inside or outside of<br>
the fiber, or both sides of it.<br>
Referring to Figs. 15-16, there is shown a<br>
modification of the hollow fiber membrane 20 wherein the<br>
discriminating layer or skin 22 is formed integrally<br>
with the support structure 24 by methods known in the<br>
membrane art. As before, the discriminating layer or<br>
skin 22 may be present on either, or both, sides of the<br>
support structure 24.<br>
Shown in Fig. 4A is a plurality of the hollow fiber<br>
semi-permeable membranes 20 woven into a mat 30. In<br>
terms of weaving or web technology, the hollow fiber<br><br>
membranes 20 would typically consticute the weft of the<br>
mat 30. A plurality of fillers 28 are used to weave the<br>
hollow fiber membranes 20 into a mat. The fillers 28<br>
are used in the traditional sense of weaving a mat or<br>
web.<br>
A cross sectional view along section line B-B of<br>
Fig. 4A is shown in Fig. 4B. The reference numerals<br>
used in Fig. 4B indicate the same elements as previously<br>
identified. Any weaving type process may be used to<br>
create hollow fiber mats, provided it does not damage<br>
the fibers.<br>
In Fig. 4C mat 30 is shown spirally wound.<br>
Typically, a feed channel spacer 34, such as a potting<br>
compound 35, will have been applied proximate the ends<br>
of mat 30, and will fill the spaces between the hollow<br>
fibers 20, as will be discussed further below.<br>
In Fig. 4D, two hollow fiber semi-permeable<br>
membranes 20 are helically wound to form a "rope" 32.<br>
In Fig. 5, a flat sheet semi-permeable membrane 1B<br>
is spirally wound using known spiral-wound<br>
configurations and techniques which provide for a feed<br>
space and a permeate space in the spiral wound module.<br>
Before spirally winding the membrane 18, a feed channel<br>
spacer 34 was disposed on the discriminating layer 22.<br>
More than one flat sheet semi-permeable membrane 20 may<br>
be spirally wound at the same time. Typically, a<br>
plurality of flat sheet semi-permeable membranes 18 will<br>
be disposed horizontally to each other. The membranes<br>
18 may or may not be separated by spacers 34. The<br>
assembly of the horizontally disposed plurality of flat<br>
sheet membranes 20 is then spirally wound on to core 60<br>
(if used). Typically, the spiral would be wound<br>
tighter, and the feed channel spacer 34 would contact<br>
permeate collection spacer 25.<br>
In Fig 6, the invention with a vacuum permeate mode<br>
is depicted. A water containing feed 40 is introduced<br>
to the feed side of a membrane separator vessel 42 so<br><br>
that the oil is efficiently contacted with the membrane<br>
18. The feed 40 may optionally be heated before coming<br>
in contact with the membrane 20. The dehydrated low<br>
volatility liquid is removed from the vessel 42 in an<br>
effluent 44. The permeate 46 is withdrawn by means of a<br>
vacuum pump 48. Optionally, the feed 40 may flow<br>
parallel or perpendicular to the membrane 2 0 and the<br>
permeate 46 may also flow parallel or perpendicular to<br>
the membrane 20 or any combination thereof. Optionally,<br>
the vessel 42 may be heated.<br>
Clearly, the vessel 42 should be sized<br>
appropriately to the desired flow rate of the feed 40,<br>
the desired operating pressure drop, and the amount of<br>
water to be removed. The permeate 46 is illustrated in<br>
the crossflow configuration, but, the feed 40 and the<br>
permeate 46 may also flow in relation to each other in<br>
countercurrent flow, co-current flow, or radial cross<br>
flow.<br>
The sweep gas mode is demonstrated in Figs. 7 and 8<br>
where there is an inlet on the permeate side of membrane<br>
20 for a sweep fluid 50. The feed stream can be<br>
filtered as shown in Fig. 8 by means of a filter 52.<br>
In Figs. 9,10,11, and 12 the fluid on the bore side<br>
of the hollow fiber 2 0 is separated from the fluid on<br>
the shell side by means of a potting compound 34. In<br>
Fig. 11, the oil exits by means of a perforated core 60.<br>
The perforated core 60 is a conventional perforated core<br>
with a housing 62 having a perforated section 64 and an<br>
outlet 68. The perforated section includes a plurality<br>
of perforations 66. The outlet 68 is in communication<br>
with the effluent 44 of the vessel 42. The perforations<br>
may be any suitable size or configuration. The liquid<br>
of low volatility flows over the housing 62 and the<br>
perforated section 64. The low volatility liquid enters<br>
the housing 62 through the perforations 66. The low<br>
volatility liquid exits the perforated core 60 through<br>
the outlet 68.<br><br><br>
In addition to lubricating oils, this device and<br>
process may also be used for dehydrating other fluids,<br>
such as vegetable or food grade oils, silicones, or<br>
other fluids of low volatility.<br>
The terms and expressions that have been used in<br>
the foregoing specification are used as terms of<br>
description and not of limitation, and there is no<br>
intention in the use of such terms and expressions of<br>

fiber, the dense, nonporous layer being formed at a<br>
different time than a support structure in the hollow<br>
fiber.<br>
81. The device as now claimed to claim 67, wherein the<br>
defect-free, nonporous, semi-permeable membrane includes<br>
a dense, nonporous layer as a composite part of a flat<br>
sheet, the dense, nonporous layer being formed at a<br>
different time than a support structure in the flat<br>
sheet.<br>
82. The device as now claimed to claim 67, wherein the<br>
defect-free, nonporous, semi-permeable membrane includes<br>
a support structure in a hollow fiber, the hollow fiber<br>
having a dense, nonporous layer on at least one of the<br>
bore and the outside faces.<br>
83. The device as now claimed to claim 67, wherein the<br>
defect-free, nonporous, semi-permeable membrane includes<br>
a support structure in a flat sheet, the flat sheet<br>
having a dense, nonporous layer on at least one of its<br>
sides.<br>
84. The device as now claimed to claim 67, wherein the<br>
defect-free, nonporous, semi-permeable membrane consists<br>
of a dense, nonporous layer on a porous or nonporous<br>
hollow fiber, and the liquid of low volatility is fed on<br>
one of the side with the dense, nonporous layer, and the<br>
side without the dense, nonporous layer.<br>
85. The device as now claimed to claim 67, wherein the<br>
defect-free, nonporous, semi-permeable membrane consists<br>
of one or more dense, nonporous layers on a porous or<br>
nonporous hollow fiber, wherein the oil is fed on one of<br>
the inside and the outside of the fibers.<br>
86. The device as now claimed to claim 67, wherein the<br>
defect-free, nonporous, semi-permeable membrane consists<br>
of one or more dense nonporous layers on a porous or<br>
nonporous hollow fiber, wherein the fibers are helically<br>
wound.<br>
87. The device as now claimed to claim 67, wherein the<br>
defect-free, nonporous, semi-permeable membrane consists<br>
of one or more dense nonporous layers on a porous or<br>
nonporous flat sheet, wherein the flat sheets are<br>
spirally wound.<br>
88. The device as now claimed to claim 67, wherein the<br>
defect-free, nonporous, semi-permeable membrane consists<br>
of one or more dense nonporous layers on a porous or<br>
nonporous flat sheet, wherein spacers separate the flat<br>
sheets.<br>
A method and apparatus for the removal of free, emulsified, or<br>
dissolved water from liquids of low volatility, such as oil, is<br>
shown. The liquid of low volatility is removed by contacting the<br>
fluid stream of concern with one side of a defect feed semi—<br>
permeable membrane (18). The membrane divides a separation<br>
chamber (42) into a feed side into which the stream of fluid (40)<br>
is fed, and a permeate side (46) from which the water is removed.<br>
The permeate side (46) of the chamber (42) is maintained at a<br>
low partial pressure of water through presence of vacuum, or by<br>
use of a sweep gas (50).</td>
