				<td>DRIVE MECHANISM FOR A VACUUM TREATMENT APPARATUS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority from European Patent Application No: 04 012 663.3 filed<br>
May 28. 2004. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0002] The invention relates to a drive mechanism for a vacuum treatment apparatus, by which a<br>
plurality of substrate holders can be transported on a circulatory path about an axis from an entry<br>
airlock through at least one treatment chamber to an exit airlock, a stationary supporting column<br>
being disposed in the center of the circulatory path, on which a rotatory drive chamber is borne,<br>
on the outer sides of which control rods are disposed for rotation and radial displacement of the<br>
substrate holders; a stationary motor is fastened on the supporting column in the rotatory drive<br>
chamber, and rotatory displacement drives for the control rods are disposed, each of which<br>
passes through one of the walls of the drive chamber and is in active connection with a<br>
corresponding substrate holder.<br>
[0003] Such an apparatus serves preferably, but not exclusively, for planar rectangular or square<br>
substrates in an at least substantially vertical position, containing a vacuum chamber with at least<br>
two treatment chambers distributed evenly on the periphery of the vacuum chamber and open on<br>
the chamber side, an entry airlock, an exit airlock and a rotatory arrangement of substrate holders<br>
within the vacuum chamber with a drive mechanism for the sequential rotation and the<br>
advancement and withdrawal of the substrate holders relative to the treatment chambers.<br>
[0004] Continuously working treatment or coating apparatus which are operated under vacuum<br>
to the limit of the power of the vacuum pump units, and in which different treatments are<br>
performed on so-called substrates at individual treatment stations, contain as a rule the following<br>
units:<br>
[0005] a) at least one vacuum chamber<br>
[0006] b) at least one vacuum system or pumping system<br>
[0007] c) treatment stations with treatment sources accessible from the vacuum chamber<br>
[0008] d) in some cases interior airlock valves at the entry of the treatment stations<br>
[0009] e) supply systems for the treatment sources (electric power and/or gas sources)<br>
[0010] f) at least one airlock system with lock valves for letting the substrates pass in and<br>
out of the vacuum chamber<br>
[0011] g) transport systems for bidimensional or multidimensional transport of the<br>
substrates<br>
[0012] h) substrate holders or carriers in cooperation with the transport systems, and<br>
[0013] i) in some cases input units for the preparation and/or the removal of the substrates<br>
ahead of the airlock system of the apparatus.<br>
[0014] Insofar as apparatus with rotatory and in some cases radial transport paths and treatment<br>
stations or chambers connected to at least one, at least substantially rotationally symmetric main<br>
vacuum chambers are concerned, such apparatus are also called "cluster apparatus."<br>
[0015] The treatment processes used are preheating (outgassing) and cooling of the substrates,<br>
vacuum vapor depositing, cathode sputtering, plasma treatment (e.g., glowing for cleaning and<br>
preparing for adhesion), the PVD process, the CVD process and the PCVD process, for which<br>
numerous process parameters and apparatus components are known. Herein, "P" stands for<br>
"physical," "C" for "chemical." "V" for "vacuum" and "D" for deposition." A number of these<br>
processes, whose names have established themselves in international parlance, can be performed<br>
reactively (with the input of reaction gases or gas mixtures) or non-reactively (in the presence of<br>
inert gases). Also, etching processes for surface treatment include the production of certain<br>
"surface patterns" and contact lines on the substrates. All process steps and components of<br>
apparatus are also involved, depending on the requirements to be made of the end products, are<br>
concerned in the subject matter of the invention.<br>
[0016] In the historical development, first the continuous "cluster apparatus" are used for<br>
relatively small substrates such as diskettes, chips, memories and wafers. However, considerable<br>
problems are faced in their further development in connection with larger substrates such as<br>
window panes and displays, such as the dimensions of the apparatus, the space required for<br>
handling the substrates and in some cases the substrate holders, e.g., raising to a substantially<br><br>
vertical position substrates presented in a horizontal position, the danget of elastic deformation,<br>
breakage and/or mechanical damage to the substrates and/or their coatings, and contamination,<br>
especially due to the accumulation of coatings on components that are present in the apparatus<br>
temporarily or for long periods, and the stalling off of these impurities by various process<br>
parameters, especially temperature fluctations or mechanical effects.<br>
[0017] Thus, according to EP 0 136 562 Bl to be discussed below, each substrate is delivered<br>
lying flat to an airlock system, first lifted upward therein with a lifting device, and then turned by<br>
a turning device to a vertical position in which it is fastened to a substrate holder. When it exits<br>
in a second airlock system the order of these steps is then reversed. In the case of rectangular<br>
substrates of large area this would lead to considerable space problems, large-capacity airlocks<br>
and chambers, as well as long evacuation periods and/or high-capacity evacuation pumps.<br>
[0018] European Patent EP 0 136 562 B1 has disclosed a continuous cathode sputtering<br>
apparatus for small circular substrates such as diskettes, semiconductors and wafers. The outer<br>
chamber is provided equidistantly on the circumference with an airlock apparatus and four<br>
chamber-like treatment stations. Apparatus such as these also belong to the "cluster apparatus."<br>
[0019] Between and outer and an inner chamber a polygonal pot is mounted for rotation, and on<br>
its frame five substrate holders are arranged by means of leaf springs which when in the active<br>
position close the airlock apparatus by means of gaskets and a valve function. The radial<br>
movements of the substrate holders, which remain always in the vacuum chamber, are produced<br>
synchronously only in the stationary state by a central cone and five push rods which are carried<br>
in the frame of the inside chamber and are brought through its wall at about half-height, and<br>
consequently cannot rotate with it. Also stationary is the drive with its cone.<br>
[0020] The substrate holder pot is rotated step-by-step by an additional drive. To be able to<br>
rotate the substrate holder pot within the vacuum chamber from station to station, the said push<br>
rods must be retracted cyclically out of the circular or cylindrical path of movement of the<br>
substrate holder pot and then thrust forward again. About the harmonization and adaptation of<br>
the tangential and radial speed curves by the drive mechanism, nothing is stated or indicated, on<br>
account of the small size of the substrates if for no other reason.<br>
Due to the constant Increase in substrate dimensions and the<br>
reduction of stiffness and strength because of the reduction of<br>
substrate thickness as development advances, new problems have<br>
arisen which have led to very complex and expensive principles of<br>
construction and complicated procedures.<br>
The Invention is addressed to the problem of Improving a drive<br>
mechanism of the kind described in the beginning to the effect that<br>
substrates even of great area, standing at a slight angle to the<br>
vertical and not fastened to the substrate holders, can be carried<br>
largely smoothly through a vacuum treatment apparatus and treated.<br>
As a result of additional developments of the Invention, principles of<br>
construction and operations are given consideration, which lead to an<br>
additional reduction of the floor area, chamber capacities, evacuation<br>
time and a further simplification of the handling of the substrates<br>
outside and inside of the vacuum chamber, and nevertheless<br>
especially to a definite reduction of the danger of contamination of<br>
the substrates by particles from coatings that spall off.<br>
The solution of the stated problem is obtained according to the<br>
invention, in the drive mechanism described in the beginning, by the<br>
features namely that<br>
a) the motor is affixed to a stationary bearing case in which a<br>
relatable star-shaped arrangement of cantilevers is journaled<br>
concentric with the supporting column,<br>
b) the cantilevers are pin-jointed at one end to bell-crank levers<br>
which have at least one pivot pin,<br>
c) the other ends of the belt-crank levers are pin-jointed each to<br>
one of the control rods, and<br>
d) the pivot pins of the bell-crank levers are guided in a<br>
stationary control groove whose shape determines the radial<br>
movements of the control rods.<br>
By this solution the stated problem is solved satisfactorily to the full<br>
extent and especially principles of construction of the drive<br>
mechanism are given which lead to harmonious and smooth<br>
movements of the substrate holders on their paths of movement<br>
which are continuous within the periphery.<br>
[0030] As a result of further developments of the invention, it is especially advantageous<br>
whenever either individually or in combination:<br>
[0031] the control rods are carried in radial guides which are fastened to the rotatable<br>
drive chamber.<br>
[0032] the first control groove is situated in a stationary control plate underneath the<br>
bell-crank levers,<br>
[0033] the bell-crank levers are sickle-shaped and are curved and arranged radially<br>
outward, and their pivot pins, which are guided by the first control groove, are disposed in the<br>
center area of the bell-crank levers,<br>
[0034] the ends of the bell-crank levers turned away from the cantilevers are joined to the<br>
control rods through connecting rods,<br>
[0035] the first radial cam in the circumferential direction has a continuous periodical<br>
undulate shape, by whose maximum radial distance from the axis the end position can be<br>
determined with regard to the particular treatment chamber.<br>
[0036] within the first stationary radial cam a second stationary radial cam is disposed;<br>
that furthermore on the rotatable star-shaped arrangement of cantilevers at least one swivel joint<br>
is disposed, on which a bell-crank lever is provided whose one end is guided by the second radial<br>
cam and whose other end is connected by a link to the drive chamber, such that its<br>
circumferential speed is periodically variable, superimposed upon the radial displacement of the<br>
substrate holders,<br>
[0037] on each of the diametrically opposite points on the star-shaped array of cantilevers<br>
there is a swivel joint, each with a bell-crank lever which is joined in each case by a link to the<br>
drive chamber,<br>
[0038] the end of the link remote from the at least bell-crank lever is joined by a pivot<br>
pin to the drive chamber,<br>
[0039] the pivot pin is joined by an angle piece and a counter-piece to an adjacent corner<br>
of the drive chamber,<br>
[0040] to each of the rotatable cantilevers there is at least one position transmitter which<br>
is in active connection with corresponding stationary position receivers,<br>
[0041] the angular position of all cantilevers as well as their association with one of the<br>
treatment chambers as well as with the transfer chamber can be determined by signals from the<br>
position transmitters and position receivers,<br>
[0042] four cantilevers, one transfer chamber and three treatment chambers are arranged<br>
on the periphery of the axis with an equidistant angular distribution.<br>
[0043] the drive mechanism is disposed with the drive chamber between the bottom of an<br>
interior chamber part and the bottom of an outer chamber part,<br>
[0044] four pairs of horizontal cantilevers are fastened to the drive chamber in a<br>
crosswise arrangement and on them parallelogram linking means are suspended whose bottom<br>
ends are joined by additional horizontal cantilevers to the substrate holders,<br>
[0045] the substrate holders are aligned upward toward the axis at angles of 3 to 15<br>
degrees, and/or if<br>
[0046] a horizontal linear row of airlocks is arranged in a direction tangential to the axis<br>
on the chamber part and consists of the entrance airlock, the transfer chamber and the exit airlock<br>
through which the substrates can be guided at an angle of 3 to 15 degrees.<br>
[0047] An embodiment of the subject matter of the invention and its manner of operation and<br>
advantages are further explained below with the aid of Figures 1 to 7. It is emphasized that the<br>
invention is not limited to a four-chamber principle with a transfer chamber and three treatment<br>
chambers, and that the total number of chambers including the airlock chambers and the drive<br>
mechanism with its angular positions can be varied upward and downward depending on the<br>
product specification.<br>

[0052] Figure 5 a schematic representation of the superimposed movements within a<br>
vacuum apparatus in the circumferential direction and in radial directions,<br>
[0053] Figure 6 a side view, partially sectioned axially, of the core of a vacuum apparatus<br>
of Figure 5 with the drive chamber and two substrate holders suspended thereon and shifted<br>
outwardly, and<br>
[0054] Figure 7 a perspective external view of a complete apparatus for the use of means<br>
according to Figures 1 to 6.<br>
[0055] In Figure 1, a non-rotating supporting column 1 with an axis A-A is represented, about<br>
which a system of four substrate holders described further below can be rotated. On this support<br>
post 1 a discoidal radial cam plate 2, likewise non-rotating, is fastened, and, spaced above it, a<br>
drive unit 3 with a motor 4 and a bearing housing 5. In the space between the radial cam plate 2<br>
and the bearing housing 5 there is a complex system of control elements which will be further<br>
described below, and which is rotatable as a whole about the axis A-A.<br>
[0056] The entire system of control elements and drive unit 3 is surrounded by a drive chamber 6<br>
of square plan, not shown here in detail, which can rotate about the axis A-A, the innermost<br>
circumferential edge is indicated by a dash-dotted line 7. At the four lateral walls of the rotatable<br>
drive chamber 6. four radial guides 8 are fastened with equidistant angular distribution, each with<br>
a control rod 9 movable radially to the axis A-A, which bear at their outer ends pivots 10 for the<br>
control of substrate holders described further below.<br>
[0057] The control plate 2 bears, shown here only partially, two continuous radial cams milled<br>
within its perimeter, namely a first, outer radial cam 11 and a second, inner radial cam 12, whose<br>
courses are shown completely in Figure 2, also in relation to one another.<br>
[0058] Directly beneath the stationary bearing housing 5 a rotatable cross 13 is borne therein,<br>
having four cantilevers 14 set equally apart, of which only two are visible in Figure 1. They<br>
engage with their outer ends by means of pivot bearings 15 one end of each of four bell-crank<br>
levers 16, and their other ends, not visible here, are in working connection with the control rods<br>
9, as will be further described later.<br>
[0059] In their middle portion the bell-crank levers 16 are engaged with pivot pins 17 and guide<br>
rolls underneath the bell-crank levers 16 in the outer radial cam 11. The bell-crank levers 16 are<br>
shown here with a sickle shape. Determinative, however, is the angular position of two virtual<br>
straight lines in each case, which run from the pivot bearing 15 to the pivot pin 17 on the one<br>
hand, and from the latter to the point of articulation with the corresponding control rod on the<br>
other. The angle "a" with the apex in the axis of the pivot pin 17 can be between 60 and 120<br>
degrees (see Fig. 4, top).<br>
[0060] Just in Figure 2 it becomes evident that, due to the gradual transitions between the<br>
relatively outer radial cam sections 1 la and the relatively inner radial cam sections 1 lb, smooth<br>
radial movements of the control rods 9 are made possible.<br>
[0061] In Figure 3, wherein part of the control cam elements is omitted, it is also evident that the<br>
bell-crank levers 16 are joined to the control rods 9 at the ends remote from the cantilevers 14<br>
through a connecting rod 18 and a first joint 19. The second joint is concealed by the cover<br>
plates of the radial guides 8, which are open at the bottom for this purpose, as it is shown in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
[0062] Since now the control of the radial movements by the relative motion between the outer<br>
radial cam 11 of the control plate 2 and the rotating control rods 9 has been described, it will now<br>
be explained how the control of the superposed periodically variable rotatory speed of the control<br>
rods 9 by the rotatory relative movement between the inner radial cam 12 in control plate 2 and<br>
the rotating control rods 9 operates.<br>
[0063] As it likewise appears from Figure 3, two diametrically opposite swivel joints 20 are<br>
placed on the rotary cross 13 with the cantilevers 14 situated thereon and an additional bell-crank<br>
lever 21 can turn to a limited degree on each. The bell-crank levers 21 have each two pivot pins<br>
22 and 23 of which the first ones are partially concealed and are guided by a roller not shown<br>
(concealed) in the inner radial cam 12. The angular positions of the pivot pins 22 and 23 relative<br>
to the swivel joint 20 have the angle "b" which is represented in Figure 3, upper right and lower<br>
left. This angle can be chosen between 60 and 120 degrees depending on space conditions and<br>
movements. Due to the diametrical arrangement of two bell-crank levers 21, inevitably<br>
occurring radial forces are compensated, yet it is basically possible to make do with only one of<br>
the bell-crank levers 21.<br>
[0064] It is also clear from figure 2 that, due to the gradual or harmonic transitions between the<br>
relatively outer radial cam sections 12a and the relatively inner radial cam sections 12b, smooth<br>
radial movements of the pivot pins 22 are made possible. The circumferential speed of the gear<br>
chamber 6 in the direction of the two outside arrows depends on these radial movements,<br>
according to the lever lengths and the angular position of the pivot pins 22 and 23 relative to the<br>
pivot pin 20.<br>
[0065] The pivot pins 23 are joined each by a link 24 and an additional pivot pin 25 to one<br>
corner piece 26 which is fastened, and to a limited extent adjustable, to each corner block 27<br>
which is joined to the drive chamber 6 in two diametrically opposite corners. Thus the<br>
circumferential speed of the drive chamber 6 is varied gradually and periodically between<br>
maximum levels and stand-still, depending on the shape of the inner radial cam 12. Stand-still<br>
occurs whenever the control rods 9 are either exactly in front of the receiving chamber for the<br>
substrates or exactly in front of one of the treatment chambers.<br>
[0066] Figure 4 shows, carrying forward the reference numbers, components of the controlling<br>
drive after dismounting the drive unit 3 with the motor 4 and the bearing housing 5. It can be<br>
seen that the controlling drive has advanced the gear chamber 6 by an angle of 90 degrees<br>
clockwise, shown by the position of the pivot pin 25, corner piece 16 and block 27 in the lower<br>
right corner. This movement is followed by the rotary cross 13, the pivot pin 20, the bell-crank<br>
lever 21 and all radial guides 8 with the control rods 9. For the sake of clarity, one of the<br>
bell-crank levers 21 in Figure 3 with its connecting elements has been omitted; it would then<br>
have to be in the upper left.<br>
[0067] Figures 1 and 4 also show the following. Three position transmitters 28 are disposed on<br>
the cantilevers 14 and on the bearing housing 5, which is not shown here, and thus three position<br>
receivers 30 are fastened on one cantilever 29 in a coaxial complementary coverage possibility,<br>
with which it has the following relationship: by corresponding data transmission and evaluation<br>
it is possible not only to determine the position of the cantilevers 14 and the control rods 9 with<br>
respect to the treatment chambers and the transfer chambers within the airlock series, but also to<br>
know which control rod 9 is opposite which chamber.<br>
[0068] Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of the composite movements in the<br>
circumferential direction and in the radial direction. Parallel to the section line E-E is a row 31<br>
of airlocks consisting of an entry airlock 32 of a transfer chamber 33 and an exit airlock 34. The<br>
airlock row 31 contains vacuum valves 35 of a known kind.<br>
[0069] The linear direction of the step-wise transport of the substrates standing at an angle, or of<br>
substrates carried without substrate holders, through the airlock row 31 is indicated by the series<br>
of arrows 36. A treatment chamber 37 lies opposite the transfer chamber 33. Inside of an<br>
annular space 38 the harmonic or gradual sequences of movement are indicated by heavy arrow<br>
lines. The rotatory movement takes place, starting from the transfer chamber 33, by 90 degrees<br>
each time along the continuous arrow line 39. At the four stopping points directly in front of the<br>
transfer chamber 33 and the treatment chambers 40, 37 and 41 the advancement and withdrawal<br>
of the substrates are indicated by radial arrows 42. The advancement of the substrates is<br>
performed up to immediately in front of shielding frame-like apertures 43 which are disposed in<br>
the opening areas of the treatment chambers 40, 37 and 41. Sealing action between the<br>
substrates and these apertures 40 is not necessary, however, for the reason that the extremely thin<br>
substrates cannot or need not make any contribution thereto. As soon as the rearward<br>
movements of the substrate holders are completed, the latter are rotated by 90 degrees in front of<br>
the next-following treatment chamber, at the end of the treatment in front of the transfer chamber<br>
33, for further transport into the exit airlock 34.<br>
[0070] The extremely compact, space and bulk saving structure of the apparatus can be seen in<br>
Figure 5, especially the fact that the substrate holders do not have to be airlocked out into the<br>
atmosphere. In all cases, even substrate holders perforated in the airlock chambers 32 and 34 are<br>
arranged with a supply of compressed gas over the entire substrate surface and rollers are<br>
disposed at the bottom end, so that the substrates can be pushed up without friction on gas<br>
cushions onto the substrate holders and removed from them again. For evacuation, and while the<br>
substrates are standing still on their holders, the gas supplies are momentarily shut off. This also<br>
applies to the period in which the substrates are on their substrate holders 52 in the annular space<br>
38.<br>
[0071] In Figure 6 a central driving mechanism 44 is shown, having a vertical axis A-A, a<br>
coaxial mounting flange 45 and the gear chamber 6, in which the system according to Figures 1<br>
to 4 is arranged. The mounting flange 45 serves for fastening to a bottom 46, only partially<br>
shown, of the vacuum chamber. To the corners of the rotatable gear chamber 6 a total of eight<br>
cantilevers 47 are fastened, which thrust with props 48 against the gear chamber 6 (see also<br>
Figure 3 in this regard).<br>
[0072] At the cantilevers 47, which are parallel to one another in pairs and form a right-angle<br>
cross, a total of eight parallelogram links 49 hang down from upper pivots. The bottom ends of<br>
the parallelogram link arrangements 49 are mounted on horizontal cantilevers 50 in the form of<br>
U-shaped hangers with legs parallel to one another, whose outwardly pointing ends are<br>
connected each by a horizontal crosspiece 51 of a frame-like substrate holder 52, and serve for<br>
substrates not shown here. At the top the substrate holders 52 are aligned rearward at an angle<br>
between 3 and 15 degrees from the perpendicular.<br>
[0073] The two substrate holders 52 shown can therefore move opposite one another in the<br>
direction of the arrows 53 and can move substantially radially toward one another. It is to be<br>
emphasized that only two of the substrate holders 52 are shown. The other two substrate holders,<br>
which are situated in front of and in back of the gear chamber 6, are not shown for the sake of<br>
ease in viewing. They are likewise movable radially in opposite directions, and at right angles to<br>
the two arrows 53.<br>
[0074] The gear chamber 6 is integrated into a vacuum chamber with the vertical axis A-A. This<br>
vacuum chamber consists of an inner, pot-shaped chamber portion 54 with a bottom 55 into<br>
which the upper end portion of the supporting column 1 is inserted so as to be unable to rotate<br>
and is made vacuum-tight by means of a flange 56. Vertical support is provided by anchor bars<br>
57 whose effective length is variable by means of adjusters 67 shown in Figure 7. Of these only<br>
two of these anchor bars 57 are shown which lie in back of the vertical section plane (E-E in<br>
Figure 5) and are suspended according to Figure 7 on radial gusset plates 66.<br>
[0075] The vacuum chamber furthermore has an outer chamber part 64 (see Figure 7) in the<br>
form of a four-cornered truncated pyramid with the bottom 46 through which a lower<br>
prolongation 58 of the gear chamber 6 is brought in a vacuum-tight but rotatable manner.<br>
[0076] Between the horizontal bottoms 46 and 55 are the important rotatable parts of the drive<br>
mechanism 44. The rotatable substrate holders 52 reach upward from below into the annular<br>
chamber 38 (see Figure 5) and are displaceable with radial components of movement.<br>
Slide-through passages through the cylindrical wall of the inner chamber portion 54 are not<br>
present. The displacements of the substrate holders 52 take place instead through the previously<br>
described parallelogram link systems 49 in which the position of the rocker pivot results from the<br>
definition, "parallelogram-link systems." What takes place, therefore, is a symmetrical rotation<br>
about a center position. By making the length of the links sufficient for a predetermined size of<br>
the pivot angle or radial component of movement, it can be brought about that the vertical<br>
component of movement is as small as possible.<br>
[0077] In contrast to slide-through passages, such rocker pivots produce virtually no wear and<br>
tear nor any dust of coating materials which might affect the quality of coatings on the<br>
substrates. Furthermore, the point of application (or engagement) at the cantilever 50 on the<br>
substrate holders 52 takes place at their bottom edges, not in the center of the substrate as in the<br>
subject matter of EP 0 136 562 Bl. The bottom pivots of the previously described parallelogram<br>
link arrangements 49 lie only with the least possible space above the upper sides of the<br>
cantilevers 50 and on the backs of the substrate holders 52, so that any wear debris is unable<br>
even for this reason to reach the outsides of the substrates.<br>
[0078] It is furthermore apparent from Figure 6 that the outer ends of the horizontal control rods<br>
9 for the cyclic movements of the previously described parallelogram link arrangements 49<br>
protrude from the gear chamber 6 and engage the inner links at the pivots 10.<br>
[0079] Figure 7 now shows, carrying forward the same reference numbers, a perspective exterior<br>
view of a complete apparatus for the use of means according to Figures 1 to 6. The entry airlock<br>
32 and exit airlock 34 are indicated in broken lines on both sides of the transfer chamber 33. The<br>
sloping entry slot 59 of the transfer chamber 33 is shown, and likewise a pump connection 60<br>
attached to it, with a shut-off slide valve 61 and a vacuum cryopump 62. Clearly visible is the<br>
ribbing 63 of the transfer chamber 33 and treatment chamber 41 to withstand the atmospheric<br>
pressure. Between the interior chamber portion 54 and the exterior chamber portion 64 there is<br>
an annular cover 65 sealed on the periphery, above which the gusset plates 66 are situated which<br>
lead to adjusting means 67 for the adjustment of the anchor struts 57 inside of the chamber<br>
portion 54.<br>
[0080] The extremely compact, space-saving construction of the apparatus is apparent<br>
especially in Figures 5 to 7, especially the fact that the substrate holders do not have to be passed<br>
through airlocks to enter the atmosphere.<br>
