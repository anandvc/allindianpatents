SUBSTITUTED 4-ALKOXYOXAZOL DERIVATIVES AS PPAR AGONISTS<br>
The present invention is concerned with novel substituted oxazole derivatives, their manufacture and their use as medicaments. In particular, the invention relates to compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1	is alkyl, fluoro-lower-alkyl, cycloalkyl, bicyclic cycloalkyl, or tricyclic<br>
cycloalkyl;<br>
R2	is hydrogen, lower-alkyl, or fluoro-lower-alkyl;<br>
R , R , R , and R independently from each other are hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, lower-alkyl, fluoro-lower-alkyl, hydroxy-lower-alkyl, lower-alkoxy-lower-alkyl, lower-alkoxy, fluoro-lower-alkoxy, hydroxy-lower-alkoxy, lower-alkoxy-lower-alkoxy, or lower-alkenyl, wherein at least one of R , R , R , or R is not<br>
hydrogen, or<br>
R3 and R4 are bonded to each other to form a ring together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, and R and R together are -CH=CH-S-, -S-CH=CH-, -CH=CH-0-, -0-CH=CH-, -CH=CH-CH=CH-, -0-(CH2)2.3-, -(CH2)2-3-0-, or -(CH2)3.5-, and R5 and R6 are as defined above,<br>
R7	is lower-alkyl, fluoro-lower-alkyl, lower-alkenyl, aryl, or aryl-lower-alkyl;<br>
R8	is hydrogen or lower-alkyl;<br>
n	is 1,2 or 3;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or pharmaceutically acceptable esters thereof.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPAR's) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor super family, which are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating gene expression. Various subtypes thereof have been identified and cloned. These include<br><br>
PPARa, PPARfJ (also known as PPARS), and PPARy. There exist at least two major isoforms of PPARy. While PPARyl is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, the longer isoform PPARy2 is almost exclusively found in adipocytes. In contrast, PPARa is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and heart. PPAR's modulate a variety of body responses including glucose- and lipid- homeostasis, cell differentiation, inflammatory responses and cardiovascular events.<br>
Diabetes is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is impaired, because he has partially lost the ability to respond properly to the action of insulin. In type II diabetes (T2D), often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which afflicts 80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries, the Isles of Langerhans in the pancreas still produce insulin. However, the target organs, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin stimulation, and the body compensates by producing unphysiologically high levels of insulin. In later stage of disease, however, insulin secretion decreases due to exhaustion of the pancreas. In addition to that T2D is a metabolic-cardiovascular disease syndrome. Among the comorbidities associated with T2D are for example insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
Current first line treatment for diabetes generally involves low fat - and glucose - diet and exercise. However, compliance can be moderate and as the disease progresses, treatment with hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin, becomes necessary. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby reverting blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and thus abolishing, or at least reducing, the requirement for exogenous<br>
T* \ A	T*\ A<br>
insulin. Pioglitazone (Actos    ) and rosiglitazone (Avandia    ) belong to the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first representatives who had been approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side effects including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone), and they increase body weight in humans. Therefore, new, better and more efficacious drugs for the treatment of NIDDM are urgently needed. Recent studies provide evidence that a coagonism on PPARa and PPARy would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e. such compounds should improve the lipid profile in addition to the normalization of glucose- and insulin-levels (Keller and Wahli: Trends Endocrin. Metab. 1993; 4:291-296, Macdonald and Lane: Current Biology Vol.5 pp.618-621 (1995)). Recent observations suggest furthermore that there is an independent PPARa mediated effect on insulin-sensitzation that could result secondary to the reduction in lipids (Guerre-Millo et al; J Biol Chem2000; 275:16638-16642). Consequently, the incorporation of PPARa<br><br>
activity into PPARy agonists is expected to give rise to more efficacious drugs for the treatment and/or prevention of diabetes.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the art, inasmuch as they bind to and activate both, PPARct and PPARy, simultaneously and very efficiently. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-glycemic effect of PPARy activation with the anti-dyslipidemic effect of PPARct activation. Consequently, plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin sensitization), triglycerides lowered and HDL cholesterol increased (=improved lipid profile). In addition, such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Since multiple facets of the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPARoc and y coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention further exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to known compounds.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) can be manufactured by the methods given below, by the methods given in the examples or by analogous methods. Appropriate reaction conditions for the individual reaction steps are known to a person skilled in the art. Starting materials are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods analogous to the methods given below, by methods described in references cited in the text or in the examples, or by methods known in the art.<br>
Homochiral compounds of formula (I) (compounds 10 and 11 in scheme 1 and compounds 6 and 7 in scheme 3) can be prepared according to the methods depicted in scheme 1 and 3 or by analogous methods.<br>
Racemates of compounds of formula (I) (compounds 9 and compounds 10 in scheme 2 and compounds 9 and 11 in scheme 4) can e. g. be synthesized according to the methods depicted in scheme 2 or 4 or by analogous methods. The optically pure (S)-enantiomer can then be prepared from racemates of compounds of formula (I) by methods known in the art, such as separation of the antipodes via diastereomeric salts by crystallization with optically pure amines such as e. g. (R) or (S)-l-phenyl-ethylamine, (R) or (S)-l-naphthalen-l-yl-ethylamine, brucine, quinine, quinidine, or by separation of the antipodes by specific chromatographic methods using either a chiral adsorbens or a chiral eluent.<br><br><br>

The well known chiral auxiliary 2 [(S)-4-benzyl-oxazolidin-2-one] is condensed with an alkoxy-acetyl chloride 1 in the presence of a strong base like n-butyl lithium in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran at temperatures around -78 C to produce building block 3 (step a). The latter is then treated according to literature precedence [Tetrahedron<br><br>
Asymmetry (1999), 10, 1353-1367] with dibutylboron-triflate and a tertiary amine like triethylamine in dichloromethane to generate the corresponding boron enolate, which is subsequently reacted at low temperatures with aldehydes 4 (prepared as outlined in schemes 5-11) resulting in compounds 5 (step b). In these aldol products 5, one of all four possible stereoisomers is strongly predominating (stereochemistry as indicated without rigorous proof with respect to the benzylic position). Compounds 5 are converted into phenolic intermediates 8 via a three step sequence encompassing: i) carefully controlled ester formation using only a minimal excess of an alkali alcoholate in the corresponding alcohol as solvent or in solvents like tetrahydrofiiran or dioxane at temperatures ranging from -20 C to room temperature to give ester compounds 6 (step c); ii) removal of the benzylic hydroxy group in 6 with a reducing agent like e. g. triethylsilane in the presence of a Lewis acid, like boron-trifluoride, or a protic acid, like trifluoroacetic acid, in a suitable solvent like trifluoroacetic acid itself or dichloromethane between 0 C and 60 C to yield protected phenol compounds 7 (step d); iii) ensuing removal of the protecting group, e. g. a benzyl group, by standard technology, e. g. catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen and a catalyst like palladium or by using dimethyl sulfide and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate in a solvent like dichloromethane between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent to give phenolic compounds 8 (step e); the order of the three reaction steps c, d, e is interchangeable, and catalytic hydrogenation can also be used for the simultaneous removal of the benzylic hydroxy function and a benzyl protecting group, preferably using palladium on charcoal as catalyst in the presence of an acid like oxalic acid in solvents like alcohols at temperatures around room temperature and a hydrogen pressure up to 100 bar.<br>
Alkyl-oxazole compounds 9 (prepared as outlined in schemes 12 and 13) are condensed with phenols 8 according to well known procedures: if R9 represents a hydroxy group e. g. via Mifswnofow-reaction, e. g. with triphenylphosphine and di-tert-butyl-, diisopropyl-, or diethyl-azodicarboxylate as reagents; this transformation is preferably carried out in a solvent like toluene, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Alternatively, if R9 represents a halide, mesylate or tosylate moiety, the aryl-oxazole compounds 9 can be reacted with phenols 8 in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of a weak base like cesium or potassium carbonate at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 140 C, preferably around 50 C, to yield ether compounds 10 (step f)- Those can optionally be hydrolyzed according to standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like LiOH or NaOH in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water leading to carboxylic acids 11 (step g). If carefully controlled reaction conditions are applied as detailed in the experimental part, hardly any racemisation occurs during this reaction sequence. The optical purity of compounds 10<br><br>
and 11 can be determined by chiral HPLC or by 1H-NMR-spectroscopy in the presence of a chiral solvent like l-(9-anthryl)-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanol, and has been found higher than 95% in all cases exemplified.<br><br>
Aldehydes 1 (prepared as outlined in schemes 5-11) can be reacted with a Wittigsalt 2 such as (l,2-diethoxy-2-oxoethyl)triphenyl phosphonium chloride or (l,2-dimethoxy-2-oxoethyl)triphenyl phosphonium bromide in solvents like isopropanol, dichloromethane, or tetrahydrofuran, or mixtures thereof in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-guanidine, preferably<br>
e<br>
between 0 C and the reflux temperature of the solvents, giving acrylic esters 3 as E and/or Z isomers (step a). Hydrogenation of cinnamic esters 3 using palladium on charcoal as<br><br>
catalyst, preferably at room temperature and 1 atm. pressure of hydrogen, in solvents like methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof, affords racemic esters 7, provided that the protecting group can be cleaved reductively (step e).<br>
Alternatively, aldehydes 1 are reacted with the enolate of alkoxy-acetic acid esters 4 (preferably the lithium-enolate, prepared at -78 C by treatment of 4 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran), preferably at temperatures around -78 C, in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, giving the aldol product 5 as a mixture of diasteromers (step b). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy group as described above for the conversion of compounds 6 to compounds 7 in scheme 1 yields racemic esters 6 (step d); ensuing removal of the protecting group, e. g. a benzyl group, can then be performed by standard technology as described for the conversion of compounds 7 to compounds 8 in scheme 1 to give phenolic compounds 7 (step g). Catalytic hydrogenation can also be used to convert in one step benzyl protected hydroxy compounds 5 into phenolic compounds 7 (step f) as described for the conversion of compounds 6 to compounds 8 in scheme 1. The cleavage of the protective function can also be performed before the removal of the benzylic hydroxy group; in such a case, similar reaction conditions can be chosen for the removal of the benzylic hydroxy group as just described for the transformation of compounds 5.<br>
As an alternative method, compounds 5 can be treated with catalytic amounts of an acid like para toluene sulfonic acid in a solvent like benzene or toluene, preferably under conditions allowing the removal of the water formed (e. g. with a Dean Stark trap or in the presence of molecular sieves) at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents to yield cinnamic esters 3 (step c).<br>
The transformation of phenolic intermediates 7 into esters 9 and / or acids 10 can be performed in perfect analogy as described for homochiral phenolic intermediates 8 in scheme 1 (steps h and i).<br><br><br>
Homochiral alpha-alkoxy-phenyl-propionic acid esters of formula 6 and free acids of formula 7 can also be prepared according to a linear synthetic sequence depicted in scheme 3. Thus, reaction types already described in scheme 1 are used in a different order beginning with the condensation of alkyl-oxazole synthons 1 (prepared as outlined in schemes 12 and 13) with phenols 2 (prepared as outlined in schemes 5-11) affording ether compounds 3 bearing an aldehyde moiety (step a). In case R3, R4, R5, or R6 contain a functional group, which might not be compatible with the following reaction steps, e.g. a<br><br>
phenolic OH-function, then a protective group should be attached to such a functional group, e. g. a tert-butyl-dimethyl-silyl moiety. Such a protective group can then be removed at a suitable stage later in the reaction sequence.<br>
These ether compounds 3 are then reacted with the chiral synthons (compounds 3 in scheme 1) to form aldol-adducts 4 (step b). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy function in compounds 4 leads to compounds 5 (step c), which can be converted into the corresponding esters 6 (step d) or acids 7 (step e) as described for the analogous reactions in scheme 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
Optionally, ester compounds 6 can be hydrolysed to acids 7 (step f)- The optical purity of compounds 6 and 7 can be determined by chiral HPLC or by !H-NMR-spectroscopy in the presence of a chiral solvent like l-(9-anthryl)-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanol and has been found to be higher than 95% in all cases exemplified.<br><br><br><br>
Alkyl-oxazole compounds 2 (prepared as outlined in schemes 12 and 13) are condensed with phenols 1 or aldehydes 6 (prepared as outlined in schemes 5-11) in perfect analogy as described for homochiral phenolic intermediates 8 and alkyl-oxazole compounds 9 in scheme 1; thus ether compounds 3 or aldehydes 5 are obtained (step a). The former are then subjected to bromomethylation, e. g. by treatment with trioxane and HBr, preferably 62% aq. HBr, in an inert solvent, preferably dichloromethane, preferably at 0 C, giving a highly reactive, often quite unstable electrophile 4 (step b). The electrophile 4 is suitable to alkylate an enolate of alkoxy-acetic acid esters 7 (R8 = lower alkyl), preferably the lithium-enolate, prepared at -78 C by treatment of 7 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofiiran, to give esters 9 (step d). To increase the reactivity of the enolate nucleophile, the reaction is<br><br>
preferably performed in the presence of a cosolvent like hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) or l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidinone (DMPU).<br>
Alternatively, aldehyde compounds 5, which are also available from ether intermediates 3 by Vilsmeier formylation or through formylation with dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, preferably in dichloromethane at temperatures between -78 C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step c), are reacted with an enolate of alkoxy-acetic acid esters 7 as described for the analogous reaction of compounds 1 and compounds 4 in scheme 2 giving the aldol products 8 as a mixture of diasteromers (step e). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy group in compounds 8 leads to racemic esters 9 (step f), as described for the analogous reactions in scheme 1, 2 and 3, respectively.<br>
Alternatively, aldehydes 5 can be reacted with a Wittigsah as described for the conversion of compounds 1 to compounds 3 in scheme 2 giving acrylic esters 10 as E and/or Z isomers (step g). Hydrogenation of acrylic esters 10 as described for the analogous reaction in scheme 2 leads to compounds 9 (step h). Hydrolysis of racemic ester compounds 9 can be performed in perfect analogy as described for homochiral compounds 10 in scheme 1 leading to carboxylic acids 11 (step i).<br>
Aldehydes 4 (scheme 1), aldehydes 1 (scheme 2), aldehydes 2 (scheme 3), and aldehydes 6 (scheme 4) are known or can be synthesized by methods known in the art. Examples for possible syntheses of these key intermediates are given in schemes 5-11.<br><br>
Known phenols 1 can be transformed into aldehydes 3 either by known formylation reactions such as e. g. the Vilsmeier formylation, by treatment with hexamethylene<br><br>
tetramine under acidic conditions, e. g. in the presence of sulfuric acid or, preferably, with trifluoroacetic acid as solvent between 0 C and the reflux temperature of trifluoroacetic acid, or by formylation with dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, preferably in dichloromethane at temperatures between -78C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step a); alternatively, a two step procedure might be used: introduction of a halogen atom into the para position, e.g. by use of N-bromo- or N-iodo-succinimide, e. g. in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and tetrahydrofuran preferably at ambient temperature, followed by a metal halogen exchange, realized by treatment with an alkyl-lithium reagent like n-butyllithium, preferably at temperatures around -78 C, and quenching the resulting aryl-Li with a formyl transfer reagent like N,N-dimethylformamide or N-formyl-piperidine (steps b and c). Alternatively, a carbonylation reaction can be used for the introduction of the formyl group in step c, e. g. by use of sodium formate, bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II) dichloride and CO gas in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide, preferably at temperatures around 100°C.<br><br>
4-Hydroxy-benzofuran 5 (R6=H) [Synthetic Communications (1986), 16(13), 1635-1640; Helvetica Chimica Acta (1933), 16,121-129] and 4-hydroxy-benzothiophene 9<br><br>
(R6=H) [Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho (2001), 2001048876A2] are known. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3-diones 1 carrying variable substituents R6 at the 5-position can be reacted with bromo-pyruvic acid in methanol in the presence of a base like potassium hydroxide at temperatures between 0°C and the reflux temperature of methanol followed by treatment with hydrochloric acid at around 100°C to give fiiran-carboxylic acids 3 (step a). Treatment of these fiiran-carboxylic acids 3 in an inert solvent like decahydro-naphthalene in the presence of a hydrogen acceptor like dodecene and palladium on carbon, preferably at reflux, provides carboxy-benzofurans 4 (step b), which are decarboxylated to benzofurans 5, e. g. by using copper powder in quinoline at temperatures between 200°C and 240°C (step c). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 5, benzofurans 5 can finally be converted into formylated benzofuran intermediates 6 (step d).<br>
Treatment of 2-thiophenecarbaldehyde 7 with suitable vinyl-lithium- or vinyl-magnesium-derivatives in solvents like tetrahydrofiiran or 1,2-dimethoxy-ethane, preferably in a temperature range between -78°C and room temperature, followed by in situ treatment with acetic anhydride yields thiophenes 8 with variable substitution R6 (step e). Treatment of thiophenes 8 with carbon monoxide, preferably at a pressure of 20 to 60 bar, a palladium catalyst like palladium acetate, a phosphine like triphenylphosphine, in solvent mixtures which may typically contain acetic anhydride, triethylamine, toluene or tetrahydrofiiran, preferably in a temperature range between 100°C to 160°C, affords after saponification of the acetate function benzothiophenes 9 (step f)- Similar to the transformations described in scheme 5, benzothiophenes 9 can finally be converted into formylated benzothiophene intermediates 10 (step g).<br><br><br>
2-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaIdehyde 1, optionally substituted with bromine in position 5, can be transformed into benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol 6 or 5-bromo-benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol 6. This sequence can be carried out in analogy to the method described in J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1 1983(12), 2973-7 for the transformation of 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde into benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol. It involves the following steps: treatment with N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran in the presence of an aqueous base like potassium hydroxide in water or in the presence of an organic base like diisopropyl-ethyl-amine, preferably at temperatures between 0°C and room temperature, generates thionocarbamates 2 (step a); thermal rearrangement of compounds 2 without solvent or preferably in an inert solvent like diphenyl ether at temperatures between 200°C and 280°C leads to arylthiocarbamates 3<br><br>
(step b); saponification in a solvent like an alcohol with a base like sodium or potassium hydroxide, preferably between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents, leads then to thiophenols 4 (step c); reaction of these thiophenols 4 with sodium chloroacetate in water or a water / alcohol mixture in the presence of a base like sodium or potassium hydroxide in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents produces then benzothiophene-carboxylic acids 5 (step d); decarboxylation, e. g. in quinoline in the presence of copper bronze at temperatures between 200°C and 240°C, followed by cleavage of the methyl ether function, e. g. by treatment with aqueous hydrobromic acid in acetic acid at reflux, then yields benzo[b]thiophen-7-ols 6 (step e). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 5, benzo[b]thiophen-7-ols 6 can finally be converted into formylated benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol intermediates 7 (step f)-<br>
7-Hydroxy-benzofuran is known [J. Med. Chem. (1987), 30(1), 62-7] and commercially available. In a sequence similar to that described above, the 5-bromo-analogue can be prepared from 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde 1 by reaction with ethyl chloro-actetate in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate at temperatures between 60°C and 120°C yielding benzofuran carboxylic acid 8 (step g). Decarboxylation as described above and ensuing ether cleavage, preferably with pyridine hydrochloride at temperatures around 200°C, then leads to 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofuran 9 (step h). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 5, 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofuran 9 can finally be converted into formylated 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofuran intermediate 10 (step i).<br><br><br>
l-Hydroxy-4-formyl-naphthalene 1 and 2,3-annelated phenols 2 with a ring size of 5, 6 and 7 are commercially available or known [see J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1988), 110(19), 6471-6480; U.S. (2000) 6121397; PCT Int. Appl. (1999) WO99/10339]. Similar to the transformations described in scheme 5, 2,3-annelated phenols 2 can be converted into formylated 2,3-annelated phenols 3 (step a).<br>
3-Bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 5, an intermediate carrying a functionality, which allows synthetic modifications at a later stage, can be prepared from 3-nitro-l-methoxy-naphthalene 4 [Monatsh. Chem. (1992), 123(6-7), 637-645] by well established procedures, i. e. reduction of the nitro function, e. g. by hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst, followed by diazotisation, Sandmeyer reaction and cleavage of the<br><br>
methyl ether function giving 3-bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 5 (steps b, c, d). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 5,3-bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 5 can be converted into 3-bromo-4-formyl-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 6 (step e).<br>
2,3-Annelated carboxylic acids 7 are known, their 3-bromo analogues 8 are known or can be prepared by established methods of bromination of aromatic nuclei [J. Org. Chem. (1978), 43(11), 2167-70; Ger. Offen. (1977), DE 2633905] (step f). Such 3-bromo-benzoic acids can then be converted into the corresponding phenols 9 by known methods such as e. g. exhaustive reduction with borane to the corresponding alcohol, oxidation, e. g. using Swern conditions (oxalyl chloride / dimethylsulfoxide / triethylamine in dichloromethane, -78°C to room temperature), to the corresponding aldehyde, followed by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation with peracetic acid (40%) in acetic acid (steps g, h, i). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 5, phenols 9 can be converted into intermediates 10 (step k).<br><br><br>
Bromo-methoxy compound 1 characterized by an annelated dihydro-2H-pyran ring is known [Can. J. Chem. (1982), 60(16), 2093-8]. Cleavage of the methoxy ether function with pyridine hydrochloride at temperatures around 200°C leads to 3-bromo-phenol 2 (step a). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 5, compound 2 can be converted into intermediate 3 (step b).<br>
The isomeric building block can be obtained as follows: Carboxylic acid 4 [U.S. (1999), US 5856529 A] can be brominated to give the 3-bromo derivative 5 (step c), which can be transformed into phenol 6 by a sequence analogous to that described for the transformation of compounds 8 into compounds 9 in scheme 8 (steps d, e, f)- Similar to the transformations described in scheme 5, phenol 6 can be converted into intermediate 7 (step g).<br><br>
3-Bromo-phenols 1 (intermediates 6, scheme 7, intermediates 9, scheme 7, intermediates 5, scheme 8, intermediates 9, scheme 8, as well as intermediates 2 and 6, scheme 9), optionally carrying a protective function, can be converted into analogous phenols 2 carrying variable substituents R by first transforming the bromo-compound into the corresponding aryl-lithium derivative (e. g. by using an alkyl lithium reagent in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, preferably at a temperature around -78°C) and then quenching the latter with a variety of electrophiles using methods well known in the art (step a). For the synthesis of phenols (R =OH), the aryl lithium compounds are reacted with trimethyl-borate at temperatures between -78°C and the reflux temperature of tetrahydrofuran, followed by oxidation, e. g. with N-methyl morpholine N-oxide or H2O2 / NaOH, preferably at the reflux temperature of tetrahydrofuran [compare Synlett 1995(09), 931-932]. These phenols 2 with R6 equal OH can then be transformed into the corresponding ether compounds by well known methods. Similar to the reaction sequence described in scheme 5, phenolic compounds 2 can finally be converted into phenolic aldehyde intermediates 3 (step b).<br><br><br>
Phenols 1, optionally protected, can be further functionalized into phenols 2 carrying additional substutents R5 by known methods of electrophilic aromatic substitution. In many cases, mixture of ortho / para - substitution-, and ortho / para -disubstitution-products will be formed in ratios depending on the precise reaction conditions. In such cases, the reaction conditions can be optimized in order to achieve the highest possible yield of mono-ortho product; optionally, product mixtures can also be separated into pure isomers by known methods such as silica gel chromatography (step a). 4-Formyl compounds 3 can be obtained from phenols 1, optionally protected, by transformations as described in scheme 5 (step b). 4-Formyl compounds 3 can then again be used as starting materials applying known methods of electrophilic aromatic substitutions leading to compounds 4 carrying an additional R5 substituent (step c). Alternatively, compounds 4 may be obtained from phenols 2 by transformations as described in scheme 5 (step d).<br><br><br>
Aldehydes 1 (scheme 12) are commercially available or known. They are condensed with diketo-monoximes 2 according to literature precedence (Chem. Ber. (1915), 48,897) in the presence of a strong acid, typically HC1, in a polar solvent like AcOH to yield the oxazole-N-oxides 3 (step a). Subsequent treatment with POCI3 in dichloromethane under reflux provides the corresponding primary chlorides 4 (Chem. Pharm. Bull (1971), 19, 2050; step b). We have surprisingly found, that this method works also with alkyl-oxazole-N-oxides. However, if R1 in 1 contains a hydrogen atom alpha to the carbonyl group, the reaction proceeds in a regio-unselective manner, and the isomers have to be separated by chromatography, optionally after the next step. These intermediates are either used as such, transformed according to well established methods into the corresponding alcohols or activated alcohols like mesylates or tosylates, or into the bromides or iodides, or finally further elaborated via SN2-reaction with NaCN to give, via nitrils 5 (step c), exhaustive hydrolysis (step d) and reduction (step e), e. g. withborane in tetrahydrofuran, the building blocks 7.<br>
4-Chloromethyl-2-alkyl-oxazoles 4 with R equal hydrogen are preferably prepared from the corresponding alkyl carboxamides and 1,3-dichloroacetone as described e. g. in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (2000), 10(17), 2041-2044.<br><br><br>
N-Acyl-glycine esters 1 (scheme 13) are either commercially available, known, or can be prepared by standard operations of N-acylation. Mono-allylated esters 2 can easily be obtained by double deprotonation of 1 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like LiHMDS<br>
a<br>
in an aprotic solvent like tetrahydrofuran, typically at -78 C, followed by treatment with allyl bromide, to produce selectively the C-alkylated products 2 (step a). Standard hydrolysis generates intermediate acids 3 (step b), which are then transformed, following well established literature precedence (J. Med. Chem. (1996), 39, 3897), into compounds 4 (step c). Ring-closure to the oxazole using trifluoro-acetic acid and trifluoro-acetic anhydride or Burgess-reagent (methyl-N-triethylammoniosulfonyl-carbamate) generates key intermediates 5 (step d), which, finally, are elaborated via hydroboration to the target<br><br>
alcohols 6, e. g. with 9-BBN in THF and ensuing oxidative work-up with H2O2 and NaOH (step e). Alternatively, the double bond in 5 can be cleaved oxidatively, e. g. with catalytic amounts of Os04 and NaI04 in a mixture of THF, water and tBuOH, to yield, after reduction of the thereby obtained aldehyde, e. g. with NaBH4 in EtOH, the alcohol 7 (step 5     f).<br><br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Background information on the performed assays can be found in: Nichols JS et al. "Development of a scintillation proximity assay for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand binding domain", (1998) Anal. Biochem. 257: 112-119.<br>
Full-length cDNA clones for human PPARa and mouse PPARy were obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively, cloned into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and mammalian expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and Gal4 DNA binding domain proteins fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa (aa 167 to 469). To accomplish this, the portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from the full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al.).<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
PPARa receptor binding was assayed in TKE10 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KC1, 2mM EDTA, O.lmg/ml fatty acid free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well 2.4 ug equivalent of GST-PPARa-LBD fusion protein and radioligand, e.g. 40000 dpm 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylamino) -3- {4- [1,1 -ditritio-2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy] -phenylj-propionic acid, were incubated in 100 ul volume at RT for 2 hrs. Bound ligand was removed from unbound ligand by solid phase separation using MultiScreen plates (Millipore) filled with 80 ul of SG25 according to the manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
PPARy receptor binding was assayed in TKE50 (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KC1, 2mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well reaction an 140 ng equivalent of GST-PPARy-LBD fusion protein was bound to 10 ug SPA beads (PharmaciaAmersham) in a final volume of 50 ul by shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for lh at RT and centrifiiged for 2 min at 1300g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed and the semidry pellet containig the recptor-coated beads was resolved in 50 ul of TKE. For radioligand binding e.g. 10000 dpm 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylamino)-3-{4-[l,l-ditritio-2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}-propionic acid in 50 ul were added, the reaction incubated at RT for lh and scintillation proximity counting performed. All binding assays were performed in 96 well plates and the amount of bound ligand measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates (Packard).<br><br>
Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10"4 M unlabelled compound. Dose response curves were done in triplicates within a range of concentration from 10"10 M to 10"4 M.<br>
Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95%02:5%C02 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the pFA-PPARy-LBD or pFA-PPARcx-LBD expression plasmids plus a reporter plasmid and an expression plasmid encoding the secretable form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a normalization control. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 ul of the supernatant was recovered and analyzed for SEAP activity (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The remainder of the supernatant was discarded, 50 ul PBS was added per well followed by one volume of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction. Luminescence for both SEAP and luciferase was measured in a Packard TopCount. Luciferase activity was normalized to the SEAP control and transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-activation over cells incubated in the absence of the substance. EC50 values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>
The the free acids of the compounds of the present invention (R8 is hydrogen) exhibit IC50 values of 0.1 nM to 50 (iM, preferably 1 nM to 10 ^lM for PPARa and PPARy. The compounds further exhibit EC50 values of 0.1 nM to 50 ^M, preferably 1 nM to 10 fiM for PPAR a and PPARy. Compounds, in which R8 is not hydrogen are converted in vivo to compounds in which R8 is hydrogen. The following table shows measured values for some selected compounds of the present invention and for a compound already known in the art (e.g.: Rosiglitazone, Drugs 1999, Vol 57(6), 921-930).<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to about 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on the dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.1-500 mg, preferably 0.5-100 mg, of a compound of formula (I).<br>
