				<td>IMAGE DISPLAY METHOD AND IMAGE DISPLAY APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an image display method and an image display apparatus in which surface and internal conditions of an examined object can be simultaneously displayed.<br>
A method conventionally practiced in diagnostic medical applications comprises: acquiring data for the human internal tissue by image information acquisition means such as an X-ray CT (Computed Tomography) apparatus or a magnetic resonance image diagnostic apparatus; storing once the acquired data in image information storage means such as a magnetic tape, a magnetic disc, an optical disc or a semiconductor memory; randomly accessing the image information storage means to reconstruct an appropriate tomographic image; and displaying the image on display means such as a CRT.<br>
The prior art includes a technique in which an X-ray CT apparatus or the like is employed to scan a plurality of slices to acquire a plurality of tomographic images which are used to produce an image closely resembling one viewed by endoscope observation. The technique has been disclosed by the present Applicant in Japanese Patent Application No. 8-187185 (1996).<br>
In the above conventional technique, the surface condition of the internal wall etc. of the internal body tissue such as intestine tissue is represented when a three-dimensional (3D) image as viewed from a virtual endoscope is displayed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
- First Embodiment -<br>
The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 is a configuration diagram showing an image display apparatus in accordance with a frst embodiment of the present invention in combination with image information acquisition means and image information storage means in an X-ray CT apparatus.<br>
An image display apparatus 101 of the present invention comprises an image processor 2, a display 3 and an input device 4.<br>
The image processor 2 includes a two-dimensional (2D) image production and display portion 2a, a CT number range input portion 2b, a viewpoint location /field-of-view (FOV) centerline direction input portion 2c, an endoscope mode three-dimensional (3D) image production and display portion 2d. a cross-sectional location input portion 2e and a peripheral image production and display portion 2f.<br>
A scanner 1a scans a patient K at different slice locations (a slice refers to a planar region imaged by tomography) and acquires scan data for a plurality of slices.<br>
Image storage means 1b stores the scan data.<br>
The 2D image production and display portion 2a in the image processor 2 processes the scan data for the plurality of slices to generate 2D image data for each slice, and displays a 2D image on the display 3.<br>
The operator reads from the 2D image a CT number range of the internal .body structure (such as ventriculus or blood vessel) of which the endoscope mode 3D image is to be produced, and inputs the CT number range via the input device 4.<br>
The CT number range input portion 2b in the image processor 2 receives the input CT number range and passes it to the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d.<br><br>
The operator determines a viewpoint location (a virtual endoscope lens position) in the internal space of the internal body tissue and inputs the viewpoint location via the input device 4. A FOV centerline direction (an optical axis direction of a virtual endoscope lens) is also input via the input device 4.<br>
The viewpoint location / FOV centerline direction input portion 2c in the image processor 2 receives the input viewpoint location and FOV centerline direction and passes them to the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d.<br>
The endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d in the image processor 2 extracts from the 2D image data for each slice the pixels within the CT number range in the FOV which extends radially from the viewpoint toward the FOV centerline direction to produce a 3D image as viewing a wall surface of the internal body tissue, and displays the 3D image on the display 3.<br>
The operator determines a cross-sectional location within a predetermined range lying near the viewpoint location, and inputs the cross-sectional location via the input device 4.<br>
The cross-sectional location input portion 2e in the image processor 2 receives the input cross-sectional location and passes it to the peripheral image production and display portion 2f.<br>
The peripheral image production and display portion 2f in the image processor 2 produces a tomographic image of a cross section perpendicular to the FOV centerline at the cross-sectional location based on the 2D image data, and produces a peripheral image (see Fig. 8) obtained by removing the 3D image region from the tomographic image, to display the tomographic image on the display 3.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart of a procedure in which the image display apparatus 101 is employed to display the endoscope mode 3D image .<br>
In Step V1, the patient K is scanned at different slice locations,<br><br>
and data sets for a plurality of sequential 2D images are acquired. The sequential 2D images S1 - S7 are illustrated in Fig. 4. In the 2D images S1 - S7, reference symbol D designates the large intestine. Reference symbol K designates the lumen, i.e., the internal space of the large intestine D.<br>
Each 2D image S1 - S7 is a tomographic image in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis. The z-axis is the axis along which the patient K is moved in the scanner 1, the x-axis is the horizontal axis perpendicular to the z-axis, and the y-axis is the vertical axis perpendicular to the z-axis.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3 again, in Step V2, the operator selects an appropriate 2D image from the sequential images using the input device 4. For example, the image S5 is selected from among the 2D images S1 - S7.<br>
In Step V3, the operator reads from the selected 2D image a CT number range of the internal body tissue (e.g., the large intestine) of which the endoscope mode 3D image is to be produced, and inputs the CT number range. For example, if the CT number range of the pixels in the large intestine D in the 2D image S5 is "equal to or above 300", "300" is input as the minimum value of the CT number range (and, if necessary, the maximum value may be input).<br>
In Step V4, the operator determines a viewpoint location in the internal space of the internal body tissue and inputs the viewpoint location. For example, as shown in Fig. 5, a cursor U is positioned at a point within the lumen K, the internal space of the large intestine D, and the position is selected. The FOV centerline direction is also input. For example, the "depth direction" of the displayed 2D image is specified.<br>
Referring Fig. 3 again, in Step V5, the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d in the image processor 2 extracts from the 2D image data for each slice the pixels within the CT<br>
o<br>
number range in the FOV which extends radially from the viewpoint<br><br>
toward the FOV centerline direction to produce a 3D image as viewing a wall surface of the internal body tissue. For example, the 3D image T shown in Fig. 2 is produced. In the drawing, reference symbol A designates a tumor developed on the wall of the large intestine D.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3 again, in Step V6, the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d in the image processor 2 displays the 3D image T in the left screen region GL on the display 3 as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
In Step V7, a check is made whether the operator changed the viewpoint location or the FOV centerline direction. If a change was made, the process returns to Step V5 to update the 3D image; otherwise it goes to Step V8. That is, while the viewpoint location or the FOV centerline direction is being changed, the 3D image continues to be varied according to the change, and when the change is stopped at a certain 3D image, the process goes to Step V8.<br>
In Step V8, the peripheral image production and display portion 2f in the image processor 2 defines the frontmost location contained in the 3D image as a cross-sectional location.<br>
In Step V9, the pixels in a cross section perpendicular to the FOV centerline at the cross-sectional location are extracted from the 2D image data to produce a tomographic image. For example, as shown in Fig. 7, a part of the wall of the large intestine D which is contained in the FOV and lies in the location nearest to the viewpoint E1 is defined as a cross section Q1, for which a tomographic image is produced. Then the 3D image region is removed from the tomographic image to produce the peripheral image C shown in Fig. 8.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3 again, in Step V10, the peripheral image production and display portion 2f in the image processor 2 displays the peripheral image C in the right screen region GR on the display 3 as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3 again, in Step V11, a cross-sectional location<br><br>
indication SL is displayed on the 3D image T as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
In Step V12, a check is made whether the operator changed the cross-sectional location. If a change was made, the process returns to Step V5 to update the peripheral image, and displays the peripheral image in Step V10 and the cross-sectional location indication in Step 11. For example, if the cross-sectional location is moved toward the depth direction, the display as shown in Fig. 11 is formed.<br>
In Step V13, a check is made whether the operator changed the viewpoint location or the FOV centerline direction. If a change was not made, the process returns to Step V12 to maintain the current display; otherwise it goes to Step V14.<br>
In Step V14, the peripheral image C is removed to restore the display as shown in Fig. 6. The process then returns to Step V5. That is, when the viewpoint location or the FOV centerline direction was changed, the 3D image T is varied according to the change, and while the 3D image T is being varied, the peripheral image C is not displayed.<br>
By using the image display apparatus 101 in accordance with the first embodiment, the endoscope mode 3D image T is displayed in the left screen region-on the display 3, and the peripheral image C is displayed in the right screen region when the viewpoint is fixed, which enables the surface condition and the internal condition (such as CT numbers of the internal of tissue) of the tumor A to be simultaneously displayed.<br>
Moreover, in Step V10, the tomographic image may be displayed just as it is. Furthermore, in Step V9, a cross-sectional image of the internal body tissue in a cross section perpendicular to the FOV centerline at the cross-sectional location may be produced based on the 3D data to display the cross-sectional image in Step V10.<br>
- Second Embodiment -<br><br>
Figure 12 is a configuration diagram showing an image display apparatus in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention in combination with image information acquisition means and image information storage means in an X-ray CT apparatus.<br>
The X-ray CT apparatus 200 comprises an image processor 12, a display 3 and an input device 4.<br>
The image processor 12 includes a 2D image production and display portion 2a, a CT number range input portion 2b, a viewpoint location / FOV centerline direction input portion 2c, an endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 12d, a cross-sectional location input portion 2e, a cross-sectional image production portion 12f and a superimposed image display portion 12g.<br>
A scanner 1 scans a patient K at different slice locations and acquires scan data for a plurality of slices.<br>
The 2D image production and display portion 2a in the image processor 12 processes the scan data for the plurality of slices to generate 2D image data for each slice, and displays a 2D image on the display 3.<br>
The operator reads from the 2D image a CT number range of the internal body tissue (such as ventriculus or blood vessel) of which the endoscope mode 3D image is to be produced, and inputs the CT number range via the input device 4.<br>
The CT number range input portion 2b in the image processor 12 receives the input CT number range and passes it to the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 12d.<br>
The operator determines a viewpoint location in the internal space of the internal body tissue and inputs the viewpoint location via the input device 4. The FOV centerline direction is also input via the input device 4.<br>
The viewpoint location / FOV centerline direction input portion 2c in the image processor 12 receives the input viewpoint location and<br><br>
FOV centerline direction and passes them to the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 12d.<br>
The endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 12d in the image processor 12 extracts from the 2D image data for each slice the pixels within the CT number range to generate 3D data of the Internal body tissue, produces a 3D image (see Fig. 2) representing a wall surface of the internal body tissue as seen in the FOV which extends radially from the viewpoint toward the FOV centerline direction based on the 3D data, and displays the 3D image on the display 3.<br>
The operator determines a cross-sectional location within a predetermined range lying near the viewpoint location, and inputs the cross-sectional location via the input device 4.<br>
The cross-sectional location input portion 2e in the image processor 12 receives the input cross-sectional location and passes it to the cross-sectional image production portion 12f.<br>
The cross-sectional image production portion 12f in the image processor 12 produces a cross-sectional image (see Fig. 14) of the internal body tissue in a cross section perpendicular to the FOV centerline at the cross-sectional location based on the 3D data.<br>
The superimposed image display portion 12g in the image processor 12 combines the 3D image with the cross-sectional image to display a superimposed image (see Fig. 15) on the screen of the display 3.<br>
Figure 13 is a flow chart of a procedure in which the image display apparatus 201 is employed to display the endoscope mode 3D image.<br>
In Step W1, the patient K is scanned at different slice locations, and data sets for a plurality of sequential 2D images are acquired. .   The sequential 2D images S1 - S7 are illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
In the 2D images S1 - S7, reference symbol D designates the large intestine. Reference symbol K designates the lumen, i.e., the<br><br>
internal space of the large intestine D.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13 again, in Step W2, the operator selects an appropriate 2D image from the sequential images using the input device 4. For example, the image S5 is selected from among the 2D images S1 -S7.<br>
In Step W3, the operator reads from the selected 2D image a CT number range of the internal body tissue (e.g., the large intestine D) of which the endoscope mode 3D image is to be produced, and inputs the CT number range. For example, if the CT number range of the pixels in the large intestine D in the 2D image S5 is "equal to or above 300", "300" is input as the minimum value of the CT number range (and, if necessary, the maximum value may be input).<br>
In Step W4, the operator determines a viewpoint location in the internal space of the internal body tissue and inputs the viewpoint location. For example, as shown in Fig. 5, a cursor U is positioned at a point within the lumen K, the internal space of the large intestine D, and the position is selected. The FOV center!ine direction is also input. For example, the "depth direction" of the displayed 2D image is specified.<br>
Referring Fig. 13 again, in Step W5, the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 12d in the image processor 12 extracts from the 2D image data for each slice the pixels within the CT number range to generate 3D data of the internal body tissue, and produces a 3D image representing a wail surface of the internal body tissue as seen in the FOV which extends radially from the viewpoint toward the FOV centerline direction based on the 3D data. For example, the 3D image T shown in Fig. 2 is produced. In the drawing, reference symbol A designates a tumor developed on the wall of the large intestine D.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13 again, in Step W6, the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 12d in the image processor 12 displays the 3D image Ton the display 3.<br><br>
In Step W7, a check is made whether the operator changed the viewpoint location or the FOV centerline direction. If a change was made, the process returns to Step W5 to update the 3D image (however, the 3D data need not be regenerated); otherwise it goes to Step W8. That is, while the viewpoint location or the FOV centerline direction is being changed, the 3D image continues to be varied according to the change, and when the change is stopped at a certain 3D image, the process goes to Step W8.<br>
In Step W8, the cross-sectional image production portion 12f in the image processor 12 defines the frontmost location contained in the 3D image as a cross-sectional location.<br>
In Step W9, the pixels in a cross section perpendicular to the FOV centerline at the cross-sectional location are extracted from the 3D data to produce a cross-sectional image. For example, the cross-sectional image E shown in Fig. 14 is produced.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13 again, in Step W10, the superimposed image production portion 12g in the image processor 12 removes a front region relative to the cross-sectional location from the 3D image, combines it with the cross-sectional image to produce a superimposed image, and displays the superimposed image I as shown in Fig. 15.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13 again, in Step W12, a check is made whether the operator changed the cross-sectional location. If a change was made, the process returns to Step W9 to update the cross-sectional image, and produces and displays the superimposed image in Step W10.<br>
In Step W13, a check is made whether the operator changed the viewpoint location or the FOV centerline direction. If a change was not made, the process returns to Step W12 to maintain the current display; otherwise it goes to Step W14.<br>
In Step W14, the superimposed image I is removed to restore the display as shown in Fig. 6. The process then returns to Step W5. That is, when the viewpoint location or the FOV centerline direction<br><br>
was changed, the 3D image T is varied according to the change, and while the 3D image Tis being varied, the superimposed image I is not displayed.<br>
By using the image display     apparatus 201 in accordance with the second embodiment, the endoscope mode 3D image Tis displayed on the screen of the display 3, and the superimposed image I obtained by combining the 3D image T with the cross-sectional image E is displayed on the screen when the viewpoint is fixed, which enables the surface condition and the internal condition (such as CT numbers) of the tumor A to be simultaneously displayed.<br>
Moreover, in Step W9, a tomographic image may be produced in a cross section perpendicular to the FOV centerline at the cross-sectional location based on the 2D image data, and may be combined with the 3D image for display in Step W10.<br>
In the above embodiment, although the description is made regarding the case in which a plurality of 2D image data sets are employed to produce a 3D image, 3D volume data may be used.<br>
- Third Embodiment -<br>
Figure 16 is a configuration diagram showing an image display apparatus in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention in combination with image information acquisition means and image information storage means in an X-ray CT apparatus.<br>
The image display apparatus 301 comprises an image processor 22, a display 3 and an input device 4.<br>
The image processor 22 includes a 2D image production and display portion 2a, a CT number range input portion 2b, a viewpoint location / FOV centerline direction / rotational angle input portion 22c, an endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d, a synchro reference image production and display portion 22f and a normal reference image production'and display portion 22g.<br><br>
By "normal reference image" is meant a reference image based on a coordinate axis assumed to be fixed relative to the image information acquisition means (i.e., the scanner in this embodiment), and by "synchro reference image" is meant a reference image based on a coordinate axis assumed to be established each time according to a viewpoint location, a FOV centerline direction and a rotational angle specified during endoscope mode imaging.<br>
A scanner 1 scans a patient K at different slice locations (a slice refers to a planar region imaged by tomography) and acquires scan data for a plurality of slices.<br>
The 2D image production and display portion 2a in the image processor 22 processes the scan data for the plurality of slices to generate 2D image data for each slice, and displays a 2D image on the display 3.<br>
The operator reads from the 2D image a CT number range of the internal body tissue (such as ventriculus or blood vessel) of which the endoscope mode 3D image is to be produced, and inputs the CT number range via the input device 4.<br>
The CT number range input portion 2b in the image processor 22 receives the input CT number range and passes it to the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d.<br>
The operator determines a viewpoint location (a virtual endoscope lens position) in the internal space of the internal body tissue and inputs the viewpoint location via the input device 4. A FOV centerline direction (an optical axis direction of a virtual endoscope lens) is also input via the input device 4. Furthermore, a rotational angle is input via the input device 4. (The rotational angle represents a rotational angle around a pivot of the endoscope. When the rotational angle is 0° , the screen vertical axis of the display 3 displaying the endoscope mode 3D image corresponds to the spatial vertical axis, and when the rotational angle is 90° , the screen horizontal axis of the display 3 displaying the endoscope mode 3D<br><br>
image corresponds to the spatial horizontal axis.)<br>
The viewpoint location / FOV centerline direction / rotational angle input portion 22c in the image processor 22 receives the input viewpoint location, FOV centerline direction and rotational angle, and passes them to the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d.<br>
The endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d in the image processor 22 extracts from the 2D image data for each slice the pixels within the CT number range in the FOV which extends radially from the viewpoint location toward the FOV centerline direction to produce a 3D image as viewing a wall surface of the internal body tissue, and displays the 3D image on the display 3. The orientation of the display of the 3D image is determined so that the spatial direction corresponding to the rotational angle coincides with the screen vertical axis.<br>
The operator specifies and inputs via the input device 4 which of the normal reference image and the synchro reference image is to be displayed as a reference image.<br>
If the operator selects the normal reference image display, the normal reference image production and display portion 22g in the image processor 22 produces a tomographic image in a plane parallel to the x-y plane shown in Fig. 4 and passing through the viewpoint location based on the 2D image data, and displays the image as a normal axial image. The normal reference image production and display portion 22f also produces a tomographic image in a plane parallel to the z-y plane shown in Fig. 4 and passing through the viewpoint location, and displays the image as a normal sagittal image. Furthermore, the normal reference image production and display portion 22f produces a tomographic image in a plane parallel to the z-x plane shown in Fig. 4 and passing through the viewpoint location, and displays the image as a normal coronal image.<br>
On the other hand, if the operator selects the synchro reference<br><br>
image display, the synchro reference image production and display portion 22f in the image processor 22 produces a tomographic image in a plane perpendicular to the FOV centerline and passing through the viewpoint location (SAP in Fig. 20) based on the 2D image data, and displays the image as a synchro axial image (SA in Fig. 23). The synchro reference image production and display portion 22g also produces a tomographic image in a plane parallel to the spatial axis which corresponds to the screen vertical axis of the display 3 displaying the 3D image, and containing the viewpoint location and the FOV centerline (SSP in Fig. 21), and displays the image as a synchro sagittal image (SS in Fig. 23). Furthermore, the synchro reference image production and display portion 22g produces a tomographic image in a plane parallel to the spatial axis which corresponds to the screen horizontal axis of the display 3 displaying the 3D image, and containing the viewpoint location and the FOV centerline (SCP in Fig. 21), and displays the image as a synchro coronal image (SC in Fig. 23).<br>
Figures 17-19 are flow charts of a procedure in which the image display apparatus 301 is employed to display the endoscope mode 3D image.<br>
In Step R1, the patient K is scanned at different slice locations, and data sets for a plurality of sequential 2D images are acquired.<br>
The sequential 2D images S1 - S7 are illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
In the 2D images S1 - S7, reference symbol D designates the large intestine. Reference symbol K designates the lumen, i.e., the internal space of the large intestine D.<br>
Each 2D image S1 - S7 is a tomographic image in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis. The z-axis is the axis along which the patient K is moved in the scanner 1, the x-axis is the horizontal axis perpendicular to the z-axis, and the y-axis is the vertical axis perpendicular to the z-axis.<br>
Referring to Fig. 17 again, in Step R2, the operator selects an<br><br>
appropriate 2D image from the sequential images using the input device 4, For example, the image S5 is selected from among the 2D images S1 -S7.<br>
In Step R3, the operator reads from the selected 2D image a CT number range of the internal body tissue (e.g., the large intestine D) of which the endoscope mode 3D image is to be produced, and inputs the CT number range. For example, if the CT number range of the pixels in the large intestine D in the 2D image S5 is "equal to or above 300", "300" is input as the minimum value of the CT number range (and, if necessary, the maximum value may be input).<br>
In Step R4, the operator determines a viewpoint location in the internal space of the internal body tissue and inputs the viewpoint location. For example, as shown in Fig. 5, a cursor U is positioned at a point within the lumen K, the internal space of the large intestine D, on the 2D image S5, and the position is selected. The FOVcenterline direction and the rotational angle are also input. For example, if the home position is input via a keyboard of the input device 4, the FOV centerline direction is +z direction and the rotational angle is 0" . Furthermore, if a track ball in the input device 4 is rotated, the FOV centerline direction and the rotational angle can be rotated to establish a coordinate axis corresponding to the endoscope mode. Referring Fig. 17 again, in Step R5, the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d in the image processor 22 extracts from the 2D image data for each slice the pixels within the CT number range in the FOV which extends radially from the viewpoint toward the FOV centerline direction to produce a 3D image as viewing a wall surface of the internal body tissue.<br>
In Step R6, the endoscope mode 3D image production and display portion 2d in the image processor 22 displays a 3D image T in the upper-left screen region with a display orientation such that a spatial direction corresponding to the rotational angle coincides with the axis perpendicular to the display screen, as shown in Fig. 23.<br><br>
In Step R7, a check is made whether the operator changed the viewpoint location, the FOV centerline direction or the rotational angle. If a change was made, the process returns to Step R5 to update the 3D image; otherwise it goes to Step R8. That is, while the viewpoint location, the FOV centerline direction or the rotational angle is being changed, the 3D image continues to be varied according to the change, and when the change is stopped at a certain 3D image, the process goes to Step R8.<br>
In Step R8, a check is made whether the operator specified the synchro reference image as a reference image. If so specified, the process goes to Step R9 in Fig. 18, otherwise to Step R15 in Fig. 19. In Step R9 in Fig. 18, the synchro reference image production and display portion 22f in the image processor 22 defines the viewpoint location as a cross-sectional location.<br>
In Step R10, the synchro reference image production and display portion 22f extracts from the 2D image data the pixels in the synchro axial plane SAP perpendicular to the FOV centerline SC and containing the viewpoint E1 as shown in Fig. 20 to produce a tomographic image, and displays the image in the upper-right screen region as a synchro axial image SA as shown in Fig. 23.<br>
Figure 20 illustrates the relationship among the internal body tissue (i.e., the large intestine in this example) which is an object for image display, the coordinate system (x, y, z) assumed to be fixed relative to the image information acquisition means, and the coordinate systems (x1, y', z') and (X1, Y', z') established each time the endoscope mode is executed.<br>
In Fig. 20, the z'-axis is a coordinate axis parallel to the FOV center axis SC. The Y'-axis is an axis which is contained within the z-y plane and perpendicular to the z'-axis, and the y'-axis is an axis which is formed by rotating the Y'-axis by the rotational-angle 9 around the z'-axis. The X'-axis is an axis which is perpendicular to the z'-axis and the Y'-axis, and the x'-axis is an axis which is<br><br>
perpendicular to the z'-axis and the y'-axis.<br>
Referring to Fig. 18 again, in Step R11, the synchro reference image production and display portion 22f extracts from the 2D image data the pixels in the synchro sagittal plane SSP parallel to the z'-y' plane and containing the viewpoint E1 as shown in Fig. 21 to produce a tomographic image, and displays the image in the lower-right screen region as a synchro sagittal image SS as shown in Fig. 23.<br>
Referring to Fig. 18 again, in Step R12, the synchro reference image production and display portion 22f extracts from the 2D image data the pixels in the synchro coronal plane SCP parallel to the z'-x' plane and containing the viewpoint E1 as shown in Fig. 21 to produce a tomographic image, and displays the image in the lower-left screen region as a synchro coronal image SC as shown in Fig. 23.<br>
Referring Fig. 18 again, in Step R13, a check is made whether the operator changed the viewpoint location, the FOV centerline direction or the rotational angle. If a change was made, the process goes to Step R14; otherwise it maintains the current display.<br>
In Step R14, all of the images are removed, and the process returns to Step R5 in Fig. 17.<br>
When "NO" is selected in Step R8 in Fig. 17, the normal reference image production and display portion 22g in the image processor 22 defines the visual position as a cross-sectional location in Step R15in Fig. 19.<br>
In Step R16, the normal reference image production and display portion 22g extracts from the 2D image data the pixels in the normal axial plane NAP perpendicular to the z-axis and containing the viewpoint E1 as shown in Fig. 22 to produce a tomographic image, and displays the image in the upper-right screen region as a normal axial image.<br>
Referring to Fig. 19 again, in Step R17, the normal reference image production and display portion 22g extracts from the 2D image data the pixels in a plane parallel to the z-y plane and containing the<br><br>
viewpoint E1 to produce a tomographic image, and displays the image<br>
in the lower-right screen region as a normal sagittal image.<br>
In Step R18, the normal reference image production and<br>
display portion 22g extracts from the 2D image data the pixels in a<br>
plane parallel to the z-x plane and containing the viewpoint E1 to<br>
produce a tomographic image, and displays the image in the lower-left<br>
screen region as a normal coronal image.<br>
In Step R19, a check is made whether the operator changed the<br>
viewpoint location, the FOV centerline direction or the rotational angle.<br>
If a change was made, the process goes to Step R20; otherwise it<br>
maintains the current display.<br>
In Step R20, all of the images are removed, and the process<br>
returns to Step R5 in Fig. 17.<br>
By using the image display apparatus 301 in accordance with the third embodiment, the endoscope mode 3D image Tis displayed on the screen of the display 3, and the reference images are displayed in the other screen regions when the viewpoint is fixed. This enables the operator to spatially recognize the current FOV centerline direction clearly.<br>
Although the above embodiments describe cases in which a scanner of an X-ray CT apparatus is employed as image information acquisition means and the image display apparatus of the present invention forms part of the X-ray CT apparatus system, the image display apparatus of the present invention can be operated separately from the image information acquisition means so long as the image display apparatus is placed under circumstances in which the apparatus can access systematically stored image information.<br>
Also, although the above embodiments describe cases in which a scanner of an X-ray CT apparatus is employed as image information acquisition means, the image information on the human internal body tissue may be acquired by any other means, such as an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) apparatus.<br><br>
Moreover. although the image information acquisition means and the image information storage means are described as being conceptually separated, they can also be understood to be included in an image diagnostic apparatus system, such as an X-ray CT apparatus or an MRI apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, since a scanner of an X-ray CT system is employed as image information acquisition means in the above embodiments, a step for inputting the CT value as a parameter representing the image signal intensity is included in the image display process, but what should be input as such a parameter may be appropriately selected according to the image information acquisition means employed, including whether the step for inputting such a parameter is to be included in the process.<br>
Additionally, large intestine tissue is cited as an object to be displayed in the description of the above embodiments, but the image display method in accordance with the present invention applies suitably to any other tissue which may have a cavity therein, such as small intestine, stomach, esophagus, trachea, urethra, vagina, uterus or oviduct.<br>
