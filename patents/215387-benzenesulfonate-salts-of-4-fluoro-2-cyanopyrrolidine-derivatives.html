BENZENESULFONATE   SALTS  OF 4-FLUORO-2-CYANOPYRROLIDINE  DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL  FIELD<br>
The  present  invention  relates   to  benzenesulfonate salts  of   4-fluoro-2-cyanopyrrolidine  derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND  ART<br>
Dipeptidyl  peptidase  IV  (DPPIV),   a  member  of  serine protease,   is  widely  distributed  in  tissues   (e.g.,   kidney, liver)   and  plasma  and  is  involved  in  the  metabolism  of various  physiologically  active  peptides.<br>
A  compound  known  as  a  DPPIV  inhibitor  is   (2S,4S)-2-cyano-4-fluoro-l-[(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethyl)ethylamino]-acetylpyrrolidine   (WO02/38541).    However,   this  compound has  low  solid-state  stability  in  free  form,   and  its  salts with  mineral  or  organic  acids  disclosed  in  the  application are  also  disadvantageous  in  terms  of  low  solid-state stability,   low  stability  under  humidified  conditions  and difficulties  in  their  synthesis,   etc.<br>
The  present  invention  aims  to  provide  4-fluoro-2-cyanopyrrolidine  derivatives  that  have  an  excellent  DPPIV inhibition  activity  as  well  as  physical  properties   (e.g., stability)   required  for  pharmaceutical  preparations.<br>
DISCLOSURE  OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
1<br><br>
To  achieve  the  object  stated  above,   the  inventors  of the  present  invention  have  conducted  various  studies  on 4-fluoro-2-cyanopyrrolidine  derivatives  and  thus  have found  that  preferred  stable  compounds  can  be  obtained  when 5      the  derivatives  are  converted  into  salt  form  with<br>
benzenesulfonic  acid.    This  finding  led  to  the  completion of  the  present  invention.<br>
Namely,   the  present  invention  is  directed  to  a benzenesulfonate  salt  of   (2S,4S)-2-cyano-4-fluoro-l-I(2-10      hydroxy-1,1- dimethyl) ethylamino ] acetylpyrrolidine represented  by  Formula   [I]:<br><br>
BEST  MODE   FOR  CARRYING  OUT  THE   INVENTION<br>
15	The  benzenesulfonate  salt  of  the  present  invention<br>
may  be  prepared  as  follows:   (2S,4S)-2-cyano-4-fluoro-l-[(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethyl)ethylamino]acetylpyrrolidine obtained  as  described  in  WO02/38541  is  dissolved  in  an appropriate  solvent  and  mixed  with  benzenesulfonic  acid  or<br>
20     a  hydrate  thereof,   either  directly  or  in  dissolved  form, followed  by  filtration  to  collect  the  resulting<br>
-  2  -<br><br>
precipitate  as  a  target  product  after  addition  of  a  poor solvent,   if  necessary.    When  using  the  above  procedure, the  compound  of  the  present  invention  can  be  readily-obtained  in  uniform  crystal  form  with  excellent 5      crystallinity,   as  compared  to  other  salt  compounds   (e.g., tosylate  salt).    It  was  also  possible  to  produce  more stable  compositions  in  terms  of  stability  when  mixed  with formulation  ingredients  commonly  used  for  formulating pharmaceutical  preparations.<br>
10	The  compound  of  the  present  invention  can  inhibit<br>
dipeptidyl  peptidase  IV in  vivo,   thus  enhancing  insulin activity  and  improving  glucose  metabolism.    The  compound of  the  present  invention  can  also  contribute  to  inhibition of  neuropeptide  Y  metabolism,   inhibition  of  T  cell<br>
15      activation,   inhibition  of  cancer  cell  adhesion  to  the endothelium,   and  prevention  of  HIV  virus  entry  into lymphocytes.<br>

25      diseases.<br>
Examples  of  pharmaceutical  preparations  for  immune diseases  include  immunosuppressive  agents  for  use  in tissue  transplantation,   for  example,   cytokine  release<br>
-  3  -<br><br>
inhibitors  for  various  autoimmune  diseases  such  as inflammatory  enteritis,  multiple  sclerosis  and  chronic rheumatoid  arthritis   (RA),   as  well  as  agents  useful  for preventing  or  treating  AIDS  by  blocking  HIV  entry  into 5      T-cells  and  agents  for  preventing  metastasis,   especially metastasis  of  breast  and  prostate  tumors  to  the  lung.<br>
The  pharmaceutical  preparation  of  the  present invention  can  be  administered  systemically  or  topically via  oral  route  or  parenteral   (e.g.,   intrarectal,<br>
10      subcutaneous,   intramuscular,   intravenous,   percutaneous) routes.<br>
For  use  as  a  pharmaceutical  preparation,   the compound  of  the  present  invention  may  be  formulated  into any  desired  dosage  form  selected  from  solid  compositions,<br>
15      liquid  compositions  and  other  compositions,   as  appropriate for  the  intended  purpose.    The  pharmaceutical  preparation of  the  present  invention  can  be  prepared  by  blending  the compound  of  the  present  invention  with  pharmaceutically acceptable  carrier(s).

Test  Example  1   [Testing  for  weight  change  under  humidified conditions]<br>
Each  analyte   (10.0  mg)  was  metered  into  a  microtube (diameter:   8  mm,   length:   50  mm)   and  allowed  to  stand  in  a<br>
20     desiccator  containing  water  in  such  a  manner  as  to  keep the  tube  from  coming  into  contact  with  water.    The desiccator  was  allowed  to  stand  at  room  temperature.    The analytes  were  monitored  for  their  state  and  measured  for their  weight  with  time.    Changes  in  weight  were  expressed<br>
25      as  percentages   (%).<br><changes in weight and state><br>
-   7  -<br><br><br>
The  hydrochloride  salt  of  Reference  Example  1  and the  methanesulfonate  salt  of  Reference  Example  2  both 5      absorbed  moisture  and  thus  deliquesced,   whereas  the<br>
benzenesulfonate  salt  of  Example  1  showed  no  change  in weight  and  no  deliquescence.<br>
Test  Example  2   [Solid-state  stability  testing]<br>
10	Each  analyte   (about  1  mg)  was  precisely  metered  and<br>
stored  in  a  screw-capped  test  tube  covered  with  aluminum foil  for  light  shielding,   which  was  sealed  under  heated conditions   (70°C)   or  opened  under  heated  and  humidified conditions   (40°C,   75%  RH).    The  remaining  percentage  of 15      each  drug  was  measured  in  the  following  manner.    After completion  of  a  given  period  of  storage,   the  test  tubes were  supplemented  with  10  ml  HPLC  mobile  phase  to  dissolve the  analytes  and  then  provided  for  quantification  by  HPLC. The  results  were  compared  in  area  with  the  initial  values 20      obtained  before  heating  or  before  heating  and<br>
humidification  to  calculate  the  remaining  percentage  of drugs,<br>
-   8  -<br><br><br><br>
1999).    A  drug  substance  and  additives  were  metered  into  a screw-capped  test  tube  according  to  Recipe  A  (10  mg  drug substance,   68  mg  crystalline  cellulose,   2  mg  magnesium stearate)   or  Recipe  B   (10  mg  drug  substance,   68  mg  lactose, 2  mg  hydrogenated  oil)   and  mixed  in  a  rotary  mixer  (MIX-ROTAR  VMR-5,   Iuchi  Seieido  Co.,   Ltd.,   Japan)   for  1  hour. The  mixture  according  to  Recipe  A  or  B  was  further  stirred using  a  vortex  mixer   (TOUCH  MIXER  MT-31,   Yamato  Scientific Co.,   Ltd.,   Japan),   provided  that  Recipe  A  was   supplemented with  no  additional  ingredient,   while  Recipe  B  was supplemented  with  16  \µ  purified  water.    The  mixtures  were stored  at   65°C  for  1  week  under  sealed  and  completely light-shielded  conditions  and  then  measured  for  drug content  after  storage  to  calculate  the  remaining percentage  of  each  drug  in  each  recipe.<br>
The  drug  content  was  determined  in  the  following manner.    The  stored  samples  were  supplemented  with  10  ml of  50%  methanol,   ultrasonicated  for  30  minutes   (using  a BRANSONIC   5200,   BRANSON  Co.)   to  disperse  and  extract  the drugs,   and  then  shaken  in  a  shaker  for  1  hour.    The resulting  solutions  were  transferred  to  50  ml  measuring flasks  and  the  solutions  remaining  in  the  test  tubes  were also  collected  by  washing  with  50%  methanol,   followed  by filling  up  to  50  ml  with  50%  methanol.    The  flasks  were further  ultrasonicated  for  30  minutes.    The  resulting solutions  were  each  filtered  through  a  0.45  µm  membrane filter,   5  ml  of  which  was  sampled  and  filled  up  with  50% methanol  in  a  10  ml  measuring  flask  for  use  as  a  sample<br>
-   10  -<br><br>
solution  and  then  quantified  by  HPLC.    HPLC  conditions were  the  same  as  used  in  Test  Example  2.<br><br>
In  the  case  of  Recipe  A,   the  remaining  percentage  of drug  was  reduced  to  91.6%  in  the  methanesulfonate  salt  of Reference  Example  2,   whereas  there  was  almost  no  reduction in  the  remaining  percentage  of  the  benzenesulfonate  salt of  Example   1.    Likewise,   even  in  the  case  of  Recipe  B where  the  methanesulfonate  salt  showed  a  remaining percentage  reduced  to  74.5%,   the  benzenesulfonate  salt maintained  a  remaining  percentage  of  90%  or  more.<br>
The  compound  of  Example  1  was  confirmed  to  resist deterioration  even  when  supplemented  with  formulation ingredients  used  for  formulating  pharmaceutical preparations,   thus  enabling  the  provision  of  formulated compositions  stable  enough  as  pharmaceutical  preparations.<br>
INDUSTRIAL  APPLICABILITY<br>
The  compound  of  the  present  invention  can  be  readily obtained  in  high-purity  uniform  crystal  form  with excellent  stability  under  highly  humidified  conditions. This  fact  eliminates  risks  such  as  powder  adhesion  onto machines  and  reduced  flowability  during  preparation,   and<br>
enables  a  stable  supply  of  pharmaceutical  preparations<br>
