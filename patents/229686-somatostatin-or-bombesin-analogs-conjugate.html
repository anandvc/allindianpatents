DIAGNOSTIC OR THERAPEUTIC SOMATOSTATIN OR BOMBESIN ANALOG CONJUGATES ANT) USES THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention The invention relates to somatostatin and bombesin analogs and uses thereof for targeting compounds useful in the detection., diagnosis or treatment of disease.<br>
Backgi'ound The toxic side effects of many therapies^ including standard treatments for cancers, effectively limit the amount of agent that may be administered to a patient. Additionally, many agents cause organ-specific toxicities, further limiting the dose that may be delivered to the target tissue. For instance, the cardiotoxicity of many anthracycline family members reduces the maximum therapeutic dose available for this group of chemotherapeutic agents. Targeted dmg delivery of various detectable or therapeutic agents can lower toxicity in nomial tissue and increase the efficacy of t*eatment by allowing concentrated localized effects on specific tissues.<br>
Somatostatin, bombesin, or other biologically active peptide analogs have been used to detect tumor cells over expressing receptors specific for the peptides (see for example Denzler and Reubi, Cancer 85(1):188-198, 1999). Somatostatin, bombesin, and many other biologically active peptide agonist analogs are rapidly internalized after binding to their receptors (Luldnius et al, Acta One, 38:383-387, 1999; UOTQ\ Biochem, Pharmacol 47(l):63-76, 1994). This internalization of the peptide analogs may result in translocation to the cell nucleus (Chen et al, Am, J. Physiol Renal Physiol 279:F440-F448, 2000; Homick et al., J. Nucl Med, 41(7):1256-1263, 2000; Janson et al, J. Nucl MeJ. 41(9):1514-1518,2000).<br><br>
Somatostatin analogs bind particular somatostatin receptor subtypes that are present on the surface of specific nomial or diseased tissues. Somatostatin receptors are up-regulated in specific diseased tissues including inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, a variety of tumor types, and blood vessels supplying many tumors, often in a subtype-specific mamier. (Denzler  -and Reubi, Cancer, 85:188-198, 1999; PlonoM^sld et al, Cancer Res. 60(11):2996-3001, 2000; Kahan et d\,Jnt J. Cancer S2(4):592-598, 1999; Gulec et al., Surg. Res. 97(2):131-137, 2001). Similarly, receptors specific for another biologically active peptide, substance P, can be up-regulated in various diseases (Id.). Somatostatin-related urotensin II peptide receptors have been found to be expressed on a number of neural tumors (Takahashi et al., Peptides 22:1175-1179, 2001). Receptors for GnRH II ligands/analogs have been located on many peripheral tissues of interest including breast, prostate, and the GI tract (Neill et ah, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 282:1012-1019; Millar et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Set USA 98:963609641, 2001).<br>
At least five somatostatin receptors subtj^es have been characterized, and rumors can express various receptor subtypes (Shaer et al., Int. J. Cancer 70:530-537, 1997). Naturally occurring somatostatin and its analogs exliibit differential binding to these receptor subtypes, allowing precise targeting of a peptide analog to specific diseased tissues.<br>
The physical and chemical properties of many compounds such as c}4otoxic agents make their conjugation to biologically active peptides problematic. The agent or drug may reduce the specificits^ of binding or the biological activity of the peptide analog, limiting its effectiveness as a targeting agent. Additionally, therapeutic and cytotoxic agents may have chemical properties that cause reduced solubility and promote accumulation of drug-peptide analogs in certain organs, thus increasing toxicity and reducing efficacy. Effective means are needed to link cytotoxic agents to a targeting agent such as somatostatin, bombesin, or another biologically active peptide<br><br>
and to decrease non-target uptake of the cytotoxic agents, while retaining the activity of each component, thus maximizing therapeutic effects and minimizing toxicity.<br>
Furthennore, while iodinization and astatination (see Vaidyanathan et al, Nucl Med. Biol 27(4):329-337, 2000) hold great promise for use in imaging and possibly in aiding freatment of diseases associated with increased expression of a factor specific for a biologically active peptide, problems exist with the methods now available for labeling a range of peptide analogs. The use of labeled biologically active peptides has been studied in various systems. Radioactive halogens such as iodine have great potential as tumor imaging and cytotoxic agents. Promising isotopes mclude   "I (K.S. Sastiy, Am. Assoc. Phys. Med. 19:1361-1370, 1992; Mariano, J. Nucl. Med. 41(9):1519-1521, 2000), ^^^I (Wheldon et ah, Radiother. Oncol, 21:91-99, 1991), ^^^1 (Blower et al., Eur, J. Nucl Med. 25:101-108, 1998; Janson et al, /. Nuc. Med 41(9):1514-1518, 2000; Mariani et al 1 Nuc. Med 41(9):1519-1521, 2000), and ^'"^I (Glaser et al., J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. 44(6):465-4S0, 2001). There are several problems associated with the addition of radioactive iodine atoms to peptides (Bakker et al., Eur. J. Nucl Med 23(7):775-781, 1996). One is the rapid loss of iodines from L-Tyr residues by specific de-iodination enzymes (Kawai et al., Nucl Med. Biol 17(4):369-76, 1990). Another problem is the gi'eat increase in hydrophobicity produced by addition of iodine to a peptide agent, which is associated with increased accumulation of radioactivity in the liver, interfering with tumor imaging and promoting severe toxicity. A further problem is loss of binding affinity when tyrosines next to the pharmacophore are iodinated. A linlcer capable of facilitating labeling of a variety of biologically active peptides without deleterious in vivo accumulation is needed.<br><br>

Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and from the claims.<br>
Definitions In accordance with the present invention, by "therapeutic agenf is meant any compound that is used in the detection, diagnosis or treatment of human disease. Such compounds may be naturally occurring, modified, or synthetic. Therapeutic agents may promote or inhibit any biological process<br><br>
implicated in a human disease pathway. Preferred disease targets include, but are not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, neoplastic cells or aberrantly proliferating cells, carcinoid syndrome, acromegaly, and angiogenesis. A therapeutic agent may be, for example, antineoplastic, including cytotoxic. Antineoplastic agents maybe alkylating agents, antibiotics, antimetabolites, hoiTnonal agonists or antagonists, tubulin inhibitors, topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, or immunoraodulators. They may operate through other mechanistic pathways, or antineoplastic agents may be supplementary potentiating agents.<br>
By "cytotoxic agent" is meant any naturally occurring, modified, or synthetic compound that is toxic to tumor cells. Such agents are useful in the ti'eatment of neoplasms, as well as inflammatoiy diseases, autoimmune disorders, and in the ti-eatment of other symptoms or diseases characterized by cell proliferation or a hyperactive cell population. Cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents, antibiotics, antimetabolites, tubulin inhibitors, topoisomerase 1 and II inhibitors, hormonal agonists or antagonists, or immunomodulators. They may also be cytotoxic when activated by light or infi-ared (Photofrin, IR dyes; A^ar. Biotechnol 19(4):327-331, 2001). They may operate through other mechanistic pathways, or c\toxic agents may also be supplementary potentiating agents.<br>
By "detectable label" is meant any type of label which, when attached to a peptide agent, renders the compound detectable. A detectable label may be toxic or non-toxic, and may have one or more of the following attiibutes, without restriction: fluorescence (Kiefer et ah, WO 9740055), color, toxicity (e.g., radioactivity, e.g., a y-emitting radionuclide. Auger-emitting radionuclide, p-emitting radionuclide, an a-emitting radionuchde, or a positron-emitting radionuclide), radiosensitivity, or photosensitivit\\ Although a detectable label may be directly attached to an amino acid residue of an analog of the invention, a detectable label may also be indirectly attached, for example, by being complexed with a chelating gi*oup that is attached (e.g., linked via a covalent<br><br>
bond or indirectly linked) to an amino acid residue of an analog. A detectable label may also be indirectly attached to an analog by the ability of the label to be specifically bound by a second molecule. One example of this t}^e of an indirectly attached label is a biotin label that can be specifically bound by the second molecule, streptavidin. The second molecule may also be linlced to a ■ moiety that allows neutron capture (e.g., a boron cage as described in, for example, Kahl et al, Proc. NatL Acad. Sci USA 87:7265-7269,1990).<br>
A detectable label may also be a metal ion from heavy elements or rare<br>
earth ions, such as Gd ', Fe ', Mn   , or Cr"^ (see, for example. Invest Radiol: 33(10):752-761, 1998). Preferred radioactive detectable labels are radioactive iodine labels (e.g., '"I,     L ^ I, " 1, or     I) that are capable of being coupled to each D- or L-Tyi' or D- or L-4-amino-Phe residue present in the analogs of the invention. Preferred non-radioactive detectable labels are the many loiown dyes that are capable of being coupled to NH2-terminal amino acid residues.<br>
Prefen-ed examples of detectable labels that may be toxic to cells include<br>
l'?2    P3    124     125<br>
ricin. diptheria toxin, and radioactive detectable labels (e.g.,  "I, "I,     L      I,<br>

"Peptide" refers to both short chains, commonly refen-ed to as peptides, oligopeptides, or ohgomers, and to longer chains, up to about 100 residues in length. Peptides may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids, and linkages other than peptide bonds. "Peptides" include amino acid sequences modified either by natural processes, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Modifications may occur anywhere in a pol}^eptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains, and the amino or carboxyl termini.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
A family of peptide agents has been developed that utilizes a novel, universal linking sequence. The linking sequence enables conjugation of therapeutic agents^ cytotoxic agents, chelating groups, or detectable labels to biologically active peptides without substantial loss of biological potency of the targeting segment of the peptide agent. These peptide agents or analogs may additionally include a hydrophilic biodistribution enhancing segment in another aspect of the invention, increasing potency of treatment by targeting the analogs away from the liver towards rapid elimination via the kidney.<br>
A peptide agent of the invention is of the general fomiula:<br>
X-Y-Z^Q (FoiTOula I) wherein X is optionally selected from cytotoxic agents, a therapeutic agents, detectable labels or chelating groups; Y is an hydrophihc element; Q is a biologically active peptide such as somatostatin or bombesin, and Z is a linlcing peptide that, when bonded to Q at the N-teraiinus or to a compatible side-chain amino gi'oup of Q, presences at least 50% of the biological activity of Q. An example of a substitution of Q is position 6 of the GnRH peptides. This position is very tolerant of substitution of, for instance, D-Lys, the epsilon amino gi'oup of which could be used for the described attachment of cytotoxic or radioactive groups with retention of receptor affmit}^ Z has the formula; A-B-C-E-F where A is D-Lys, D-Tyi', D-Ser, or L-Ser, or is deleted; B is D-Lys or D-T)T, or deleted; C is Lys, Ser, hSer, Nle, Abu, Nva, (2,3, or 4) 3-p}a*idy]-Ala 9 (Pal), Om, Dab, Dap, 4-NH2-Phe, D-4-OH-Pro, or L-4-OH-Pro, or is deleted; E is D-Lys, D-Tyi\ D-Ser, D-OH-Pro, L-4-OH-Pro, D-Asn, L-Asn, D-Asp, L-Asp, D-Glu, L-Glu, D-Gln, or L-Ghi; and F is D-Lys, D-Tyr, D-Ser, D-OH-Pro, L-4-OH-Pro, 3-iodo-D-Tyr, 3-5 diido-D-Tyi-, 3-astatine-D-Tyi% 3-5 astatine-D-Tyr, 3-bromo-D-Tyr, 3-5 dibromo-D-Tyr, D-Asn, L-Asn, D-Asp, L-Asp, D-Glu, L-Glu, D-Gln, or L-Gln; provided that when A, B, C, and E are Tyr, Tyi*, Lys, and Tyr, respecitively, F is not Lys; and when A, B, C, and E are<br><br>
Lys, Tyi", Lys, and Tyi\ respectively, E is not Tyr or Lys; and when A and B are deleted, and C and E are Lys and Tyr, respectively, F is not Tyi* or Lys. The Z peptide linker may thus be 2, 3, 4, or 5 residues in length.<br>

Additional sequences of peptide agents of the invention are found in Table 1.<br>
The present invention circumvents the accumulation of toxic peptide analog in tissues, through inclusion of both the Z linker^ containing hydrophilic resides, and optional inclusion of an elongated hydrophilic linlcer. These linkers promote rapid elimination of intact, non-bound peptide agents tlirough the kidneys. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a, p-poly(N-hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide (PHEA), and polyvinylalcohol (PVA) gi-oups contained in this invention are also Icnown to be excellent promoters of rapid renal secretion which is correlated generally with lower potential drug toxicities (Yamoaka et al, J. Pharmacol Scl, 83:601-606, 1994; Rypacek et al, PflugersArcL, 392:211-217, 1982; Yamoaka et al, J. Phaim. Pharmacol, 47:479-486, 1995). We posit that these groups also promote lowered toxicity emanating from bioavailable, non-interaalized conjugates.<br>
The peptide agents of the invention include a universal linldng sequence designed to presence full biological potency of the peptide analogs when conjugated to a cytotoxic agent. A peptide analog of the invention has a biological potency that is preferably greater than or equal to the parent peptide analog from which it is derived, with a specificity that is greater, lesser, or equivalent to the parent peptide's target specificity. For example, a somatostatin analog may bind to more somatostatin receptor subtypes than naturally occurring somatostatin, or it may bind to a particular receptor subtype. Some analogs of the invention contain D-isomers of amino acids or<br><br>
analogs thereof, facilitating stable coupling of cytotoxic agents while retaining high receptor affmity and biological potency of the peptide analog. Preferably a cytotoxic agent will be coupled via a linkage likely to encourage release of free cytotoxic agent intracellularly.<br>
Additionally, because the somatostatin analogs of the invention are ^'ariously hydrophilic, they are water-soluble and, thus, have enlianced use as compared to previous hydrophobic analogs. The hydrophilic analogs described herein are soluble in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and other bodily fluids, as well as in urine, facilitating excretion by the Icidneys. This hydrophilic character facilitates the delivery of the analogs of the invention to almost every area of the body. The invention also discloses specific hydrophihc elements for incorporation into peptide analogs, allowing modulation of the analog's hydrophilicity to adjust for the chemical and structural nature of the various conjugated c}^otoxic agents.<br>
Somatostatin agonist analogs are rapidly internalized after binding to their receptors (see Lukinius et ah Acta One, 38:383-387. 1999) and can thus be used as vectors for targeting various therapeutic agents - such as traditional tumor cyctotoxic agents. It is possible that the specificity of such anti-timior agents can be drastically improved since many tumor types heavily overexpress somatostatin type 2 receptors.   In this maimer, we propose that the toxic side effects associated with all conjugatable c^^otoxic agents can be usefully lowered as long as a potent hybrid molecule can be designed which retains very high affmity for somatostatin receptors.<br>
The invention features the use of a linking sequence, referred to as Z in formula I, which we have found enables many long N-teiToinal amino acid sequences and large molecules to be conjugated to the N-temiinus of the somatostatin analogs with full retention of agonist potency.   This linldng sequence can be used to add longer, enzymatically stable (via use of D-amino acids), hydrophihc peptide sequences (the Y element of formula I) designed to tarset the resulting coniugates away from the liver towards rapid elimination<br><br>
via the Iddney. Alternatively, a hydrophilic polymer may be linked to the peptide analog via the Z linker. Tliis promotes lowered toxicity emanating from non-internalized conjugates.<br>
The peptide analog also includes an element, denoted as Y in foraiula I, which may be optimized to facilitate biodistribution of the particular peptide    ' agent conjugated to a cytoxic or therapeutic group, or a chelating gi'oup or detectable label. The Y linlcer may be a peptide or a polymer such as PEG or PVA. If Y is a hydrophilic peptide, Y may be 1 to 50 amino acids in length, or more preferably 3 to 15 residues in length. For example, Y maybe 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, IS, 19 or20 amino acid residues in length. Wlien a peptide, Y may contain charged or non-polar amino acids, their analogs or derivatives that are naturally occun-ing, synthetic or modified.<br>
The linking sequences of the invention are used to conjugate a biologically active peptide refeired to as Q in formula I, to various therapeutic or diagnostic agents, referred to as X in formula I. The component X of fonnula I can be any known cytotoxic or therapeutic moiety, e.g., Antineoplastic agents such as: Acivicin; Aclambicin; Acodazole Hydrochloride; Acronine; Adozelesin; Adriamycin; Aldesleuldn; Alti'etamine; Ambomycin; A. metantrone Acetate; Aminoglutethimide; Amsacrine; Anastrozole; Anthramycin; Asparaginase; Asperlin; Azacitidine; Azetepa; Azotomycin; Batimastat; Benzodepa; Bicalutamide; Bisantrene Hydrochloride; Bisnafide Dimesylate; Bizelesin; Bleomycin Sulfate; Brequinar Sodium; Bropiiimine; Busulfan; Cactinomycin; Calusterone; Camptothecin; Caracemide; Carbetimer; Carboplatin; Carmustine; Cambicin Hydrochloride; Carzelesin; Cedefingol; Chlorambucil; Cirolemycin; Cisplatin; Cladribine; Combretestatin A-4; Crisnatol Mesylate; Cyclophosphamide; Cytarabine; Dacarbazine; DACA (N- [2- (Dimethyl-amino) ethyl] acridine-4-carboxamide); Dactinomycin; Daunorubicin Hydrochloride; Daunomycin; Decitabine; Dexomiaplatin; Dezaguanine; Dezaguanine Mesylate; Diaziquone; Docetaxel; Dolasatins; Doxorubicin; Doxorubicin Hydrochloride; Droloxifene;<br><br>

The peptide agents of the invention can be modified or labeled to facilitate diagnostic or therapeutic uses. Detectable labels such as a ' radioactive, fluorescent, heavy metal, or other agents may be bound to the peptide agents of the invention. Single, dual, or multiple labeling of a peptide agent may be advantageous. For example, dual labeHng with radioactive iodination of one or more residues combined with the additional coupling of, for example,^^^ via a chelating group to amine-containing side or reactive<br><br>
groups, would allow combination labeling. This may be useful for specialized diagnostic needs such as identification of widely dispersed small neoplastic cell<br>
masses.<br>
Peptide analogs of the invention may also be modified, for example, by halogenation of the tyi'osine residues of the compound. Halogens include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, or astatine. Such halogenated peptide agents may be detectably labeled, e.g. if the halogen is a radioisotope such as, for example, '^F, ^^Br, "Br. ^"^I, '"^I, '^'l, '"l.. '=^1, ^^'l or ^"At. Halogenated compounds of the invention contain a halogen covalently bound to at least one amino acid, and preferably to D-Tyr residues in each peptide agent molecule. Other suitable detectable modifications include binding of other compounds (e.g., a fluorochrome such as fluorescein) to a lysine residue of the analog, particularly an analog having a linker including lysines.<br>
Radioisotopes for radiolabeling the biological peptide agents of the invention include any radioisotope that can be covalently bound to a residue of the analog. The radioisotopes can be selected fi*om radioisotopes that emit either beta or gamma radiation, or alternatively, the peptide agents can be modified to contain chelating groups that, for example, can be covalently bonded to lysine residue(s) of the analog. The chelating gi'oups can then be modified to contain any of a variety of radioisotopes, such as gallium, indium, technetium, ytterbium, rhenium, or thalhum (e.g., ^'^I, ^'Ga, ^^^In, ^^mTc, '\\ ^^^Re).<br>
\^Tiere the peptide agent is modified by attacliment of a radioisotope, preferable radioisotopes are those having a radioactive half-life corresponding to, or longer than, the biological half-life of the agent used. More preferably, the radioisotope is a radioisotope of a halogen atom (e.g. a radioisotope of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), even more preferably ^Br, ^'Br, 'Bx, '\ '\ '\ '-% '-\ '\ or -"At.<br>
Conjugates that include radioactive metals are useful in radiographic imaging or radiotherapy. Preferred radioisotopes also include ^^"^Tc, ^^Cr,<br><br>
'Ga, ^^Ga, ^^^In, ''\% ^^V 'Y, 'Y, ^^^Sm, ^^^o^^^^Dy, ^^Cu, '\u, ''RU, '^Rt, '^'RC, ^'?h, '^^Bi, '^-Bi, '^'Bi, and -^^Bi. The choice of metal is deteiTnined based on the desired therapeutic or diagnostic application.<br>
The metal complexes of the invention are useful as diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents. A detectable label may be a metal ion from heavy elements* or rare earth ions, such as Gd"' , Fe"* , Mn ", or Cr ". Conjugates that include paramagnetic or superparamagnetic metals are useful as diagnostic agents in MR] imaging applications. Paramagnetic metals that may be used in the conjugates include, but are not limited to, cliromium (III), manganese (II), iron (II). iron (III), cobalt (II), nickel (II), copper (II), praseodymium (III), neodymium (III), samarium (III), gadolinium (III), terbium (III), dysprosium<br>
(III), holmium (III), erbium (III), and ytterbium (III).   Preferably, the polymer<br>
'	111<br>
has a relaxtivity of at least 10, 12, 15, or 20 niM" sec" Z', wherein Z is the<br>
concenti'ation of paramagnetic metal.<br>
Chelating groups may be used to indirectly couple detectable labels or other molecules to the peptide agents of the invention. Chelating gi-oups may link peptide agents with radiolabels, such as a bifunctional stable chelator may be linked to one or more tenninal or internal amino acid reactive groups. They may be linked via an isothiocyanate P-Ala or appropriate non a-anjino acid linker which prevents Edman degradation. Examples of chelators known in the art include, for example, the ininocarboxylic and polyaminopolycarboxylic reactive groups, DTPA (N,N-Bis[2-[bis(carboxymethyl)amino]ethyl]glycine), and DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraaazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-teti'aacetic acid).<br>
The cytotoxic or therapeutic conjugates of the invention can employ any of the large number of loiown somatostatin analogs that recognize the somatostatin receptor, e.g., those described in the definitions above. Preferably, the somatostatin analog portion of the conjugate contains between 10 and 18 amino acids, and includes the core sequence: cyclo[Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Tlir-Cys]. Preferably, the C-tenninus of the analog is: Thr-NH2.<br><br>
iiombesm analogs as disclosed herein may also be conjugated to cytotoxic or therapeutic agents in the peptide agents of the invention.<br>
The somatostatin analog can be coupled directly to the cytotoxic or therapeutic agent using known chemical methods, or the tAvo moieties can be coupled via an indirect linkage. For example, the analog may be attached to a chelating group that is attached to the cytotoxic or therapeutic agent. Chelating groups include, but are not limited to, an iminodicarboxyhc group or a polyaminopolycarboxylic group. For general mediods. see, e.g., Liu et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 12(4):653, 2001; Cheng et ai., WO 89/12631; IGeffer et. al, WO 93/12112; Albert et al., U.S.P.N. 5,753,627: and WO 91/01144 (each of which are hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
Specitlc targeting of labeled, therapeutic or c}^otoxic agents allows selective destruction of tumors expressing receptors specific for biologically active peptides. For example, the tumors expressing somatostatin receptors includes neoplasms of the lung, breast, prostate, colon, brain, gastrointestinal tract, neuroendocrine axis, liver, kidney, etc. (see Schaer et al., Int. J. Cancer, 70:530-537, 1997; Chave et ah, Br. J. Cancer 82(1 ):124-130, 2000; Evans et al, Br. J. Cancer 75(6):79S-803, 1997). Cytotoxic somatostatin peptide analogs may also be specific for tumor vasculatures, or angiogenic blood vessels, such as those which over-express somatostatin receptors (see Denzler and Reubi, Cancer 85:188-198, 1999; Gulec et al., /. Surg. Res. 97(2):131-137, 2001; Woltering et al., 1 Surg Res. 50:245, 1991/.<br>
Peptide agents of the invention may be administed to a mammalian subject, such as a human, directly or in combination with any phannaceutically acceptable carrier or salt Icnown in the art. PhaiTnaceutically acceptable salts ma\' include non-toxic acid addition salts or metal complexes that are commonly used in the phamiaceutical industr}'. Examples of acid addition salts include organic acids such as acetic, lactic, pamoic.. maleic, citric, mahp, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, palmitic, suberic, salicyhc, tartaric, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, or trifluoroacetic acids or the like; polymeric ■<br>
r<br><br>
acids such as taimic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, or the like; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid phosphoric acid, or the like. Metal complexes include zinc, iron, and the hke.   One exemplary phamiaceutically acceptable carrier is physiological saline. Other physiologically acceptable carriers and their fomiulations are known to one skilled in the art and described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, (18^^ edition), ed. A. Gennaro, 1990, Mack Pubhshing Company, ■ Easton, PA.<br>
Phannaceutical fonnulations of a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide agent of the invention, or phamiaceutically acceptable salt-thereof, can be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., intramuscular, intoperitoneal, intravenous, or subcutaneous injection, inhalation, inti'adermally, optical drops, or implant), nasally, vaginally, rectally, sublingually, or topically, in admixture with a phamiaceutically acceptable earner adapted for the route of administration.<br>
Methods well known in the art for maldng fomiulations are found, for example, in Remington's Phairnaceutical Sciences (18^ edition), ed. A. Gennaro, 1990, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared in solid or liquid forms according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of phamiaceutical compositions. The compositions may optionally contain sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming, and/or preserving agents in order to provide a more palatable preparation. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and gi'anules. In such sohd forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert phamiaceutically acceptable canier or excipient. These may include, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, sucrose, starch, calcium phosphate, sodium phosphate, or kaolin. Binding agents, buffering agents, and/or lubricating agents (e.g., magnesium stearate) may also be used. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.<br><br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral adminisfration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and soft gelatin capsules. These forms contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water or an oil medium. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and suspending agents."<br>
Formulations for parenteral administi-ation include sterile aqueous or non- aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of suitable vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, gelatin, hydrogenated naphalenes, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Such fonnulations may also contain adjuvants, such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. Biocompatible, biodegi-adable lactide polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, orpolyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copohTOers may be used to control the release of the compounds. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for the polypeptides of the invention include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolynier panicles, osmotic pumps, implantable infiision systems, and liposomes.<br>
Liquid formulations can be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, or by irradiating or heating the composiiions. Alternatively, they can also be manufactured in the fonn of sterile, solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to active substances, excipients such as coca butter or a suppository wax. Compositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients Icnown in the art. Formulations for inhalation may contain excipients, for example, Jactose, or maybe aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or may be oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops or spray, or as a gel.<br><br>
The amount of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention can be varied. One skilled in the ait will appreciate that the exact individual dosages may be adjusted somewhat depending upon a variety of factors, including the polypeptide being administered, the time of administi'ation, the route of administotion, the nature of the fomiulation, the rate of excretion, the ■ nature of the subject's conditions, and the age, weight, health, and gender of the patient. In addition, the severity of the condition targeted by the biologically active peptide such as somatostatin or bombesin will also have an impact on the dosage level. Generally, dosage levels of between 0.1 jJ-g/kg to 100 mg/kg of body weight are administered daily as a single dose or divided into multiple doses. Preferably, the general dosage range is between 250 |J.g/kg to 5.0 mg/lvg of body weight per day. Wide variations in the needed dosage are to be expected in view of the differing efficiencies of the various routes of administi'ation. For instance, oral administration generally would be expected to require higher dosage levels than administi'ation by intravenous injection. Variations in these dosage levels can be adjusted using standard empirical routines for optimization, which are well loiown in the art. In general, the precise therapeutically effective dosage will be detennined by the attending physician in consideration of the above identified factors.<br>
The polypeptides of the invention can be administered in a sustained release composition, such as those described in, for example, U.S.P.N. 5,672,659 and U.S.P.N. 5,595,760. The use of immediate or sustained release compositions depends on the type of condition being treated. If the condition consists of an acute or over-acute disorder, a treatnient with an immediate release fomi will be preferred over a prolonged release composition. Alternatively, for preventative or long-term treatments, a sustained released composition will generally be prefen-ed.<br>
Polypeptides of the present invention can be prepared in any suitable manner. The polypeptides may be isolated from naturally occuiiing sources, recombinantly produced, or produced synthetically, or produced by a<br><br>
combination of these methods. The synthesis of short peptides is well laiown in the art. See e.g., Stewart et al. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (Pierce Chemical Co., 2d ed., 19S4). The peptides of the present invention can be synthesized according to standard peptide synthesis methods loiown in the art and exempHfied in Example 1 below.<br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following examples, which are in no way intended to be limiting of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of di-cesinm salt of (-^)-amethopterin (methotrexate).<br>
Methoti-exate (0.75 niniole) was dissolved in 200 ml of water to which was added cesium bicarbonate (1.5 mmol). The yellow solution was stirred for 4 hours, evaporated under reduced pressure, and the oily residue dissolved in ethanol. This was evaporated from anliydrous ethanol 3 times to remove residual water.<br>
