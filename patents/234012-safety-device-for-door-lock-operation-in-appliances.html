				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates a safety device for door lock<br>
operation in appliances.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Appliances such as Washing Machine and Dishwasher use water as<br>
prime media for carrying out the desired operation of washing or<br>
cleaning. Depending on the design feature, the temperature of water<br>
during part of the operation can vary upto 95° C. All such appliances<br>
carry a loading port or hole for loading articles to be cleaned or washed<br>
into appliances.<br>
After loading the articles the port or hole is closed by the door<br>
which gets locked to the main body or cabinet by the device "Door<br>
Lock'\ After closing the door, the appliances are switched on for electric<br>
power supply.<br>
The door lock is functional from the start operation or program or<br>
cycle till the end of operation or program or cycle. At the end of cycle the<br>
door lock unlocks the door for subsequent opening to take out the articles<br>
from the appliances.<br>
The door lock used in the appliances now days are basically<br>
operating on the thermistor and bimetal principle and they are called<br>
thermal door locks. This concept is used in practically all the machines.<br>
In some machines the door locks used are of magnetic type also.<br>
Door Lock operation in general is illustrated in relation to Fig 1,<br>
wherein door lock has three contact terminals 'L' for input live power<br>
supply. 'N' for input neutral power supply and 'C for output live power<br>
supply. The slider 3 for locking plunger 5, bi-metallic strip 2 for<br>
deflecting spring contact plate 4, thermister 1 for heating bi-metallic strip<br>
2, plunger 5 for locking the door of the appliance, spring contact plate 4<br>
for making contact of terminal 'L' and 'C and upward and downward<br>
movement of slider 3, spring 6 for return movement of plunger 5. All<br>
prime components are covered in housing 7.<br>
With the closure of door of appliance, the plunger 5 slides against<br>
the pressure of spring 6 to the position where the "locking" function takes<br>
place. At this position the portion P of the plunger 5 comes below the<br>
hole at the portion H on the housing 7. When appliance is switched "ON"<br>
the power supply through electric circuit of the appliance is available<br>
between L &amp; N where as L &amp; C are open for the current path. Due to<br>
supply between L &amp; N the thermister I gets heated and the heat is<br>
transmitted to bimetallic strip 2. Bimetallic strip at a particular<br>
temperature which is defined by the constituting metals of the bimetallic<br>
strip, buckles. This in turn deflects the contact plate 4 to establish current,<br>
path between L &amp; C as well as to lock the sliding movement of plunger 5<br>
through slider 3. The door lock is in locked condition throughout the<br>
working cycle of appliance or till such time power supply is available to<br>
the door lock.<br>
At the end of working cycle, the power supply to the door lock gets<br>
cut off. As a result the thermister (I) cools down, bimetallic strip 2<br>
restores the original position. This deflects the contact plate 4 which in<br>
turn deflects slider 3 to unlock the sliding movement of plunger 5.<br>
Unless taken care of by some other design, such door lock, in case<br>
of non-availability of power supply or supply failure, restore to the<br>
unlock condition thereby unlocking the door.<br>
Under "no power" situation where in appliance is also under<br>
incomplete operation cycle with water inside (in between start and end<br>
position) if user intentionally or unintentionally opens the door, the water<br>
splashes out of the appliance. Depending on selection of operating<br>
parameters and stage of operation, water can be of any temperature upto<br>
95° centigrade. Under all such and similar situations, it is unsafe to have a<br>
stage of "unlocked door" in between the operating cycle of the appliance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a safety device for<br>
door lock ensuring the locked condition of the door under the situation<br>
when water chamber of the appliances carries water inside.<br>
The another object of the present invention is to provide a safety<br>
device for door lock for preventing the door from opening when water<br>
chamber of the appliance carries water inside and prevents hot or cold<br>
water spilling out of the appliance resulting in the safety of the user as<br>
well as reduces inconvenience due to spillage.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a safety device<br>
for door lock operation in appliances, which comprises:<br>
a spring loaded plunger (7) for locking upward movement of spring<br>
loaded slider (8);<br>
a rubber diaphragm (6) for sensing air pressure;<br>
a spring loaded slider (8) for locking plunger (5) of the door lock;<br>
a pressostat for controlling the level of water in the water chamber.<br>
The safety device of the present invention, in the absence of water,<br>
in the water chamber, the air column pressure on rubber diaphragm (6) is<br>
released, thus making the spring loaded plunger (7) slide in the direction<br>
of the rubber diaphragm, which results in the movement of the spring<br>
loaded slider (8) from its position; thus releasing the plunger of the door<br>
lock for its sliding movement to unlock the door of the appliance;<br>
The safety device of the present invention, in the presence of water<br>
in the water chamber, the air pressure in the elastic tube (9) presses the<br>
said rubber diaphragm (6) which slides the spring loaded plunger (7)<br>
which in turn pushes the spring loaded slider (8), which in turn locks the<br>
position of the door lock plunger (5) which results in the locking of the<br>
door of an appliance in presence of water irrespective of availability of<br>
power supply and the said plunger (5) of the door lock is unable to slide<br>
back under the effect of the spring.<br>
The safety device establishes a link between the water content in<br>
the appliance chamber where articles are physically cleaned or washed<br>
and the door lock. It enables door lock to retain locked condition of door<br>
irrespective of availability of power supply when the water is present in<br>
the water chamber.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
We shall now describe the main invention with reference to<br>
accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration but does<br>
not restrict the scope of invention<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the operation of the door lock in prior art<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the various components of the safety device for<br>
door lock of the present invention.<br>
Brief description of safety device for door lock operation in<br>
appliance is described in relation to Fig. 2. Safety device consists of<br>
spring loaded plunger 7 for locking upward movement of slider 8, rubber<br>
diaphragm 6 for sensing air pressure and sliding spring loaded plunger 7,<br>
spring loaded slider 8 for locking plunger 5 of door lock (Fig. 2). These<br>
prime components are encased in housing and assembled in door lock 1<br>
as shown in Fig.2. The sliding path of plunger 7 and sliding path of slider<br>
8 are intersecting each oilier as shown in Fig. 2. Rubber diaphragm is<br>
linked to pressostat through air passage in additional elastic lube 9 with<br>
the help of'T joint 4. Rectangular hole 'FT is provided in the housing for<br>
movement of slider 8 (Fig. 2) of safety device. Slot 'P' provided on<br>
plunger 5 to be used for locking movement of plunger 5 by safety device<br>
slider (Fig. 2).<br>
Pressostat or pressure switch is the component used in appliance<br>
which determines and controls the level of water in the water chamber.<br>
Level of water detected through the pressure of air column in the elastic<br>
tube 3 which is connected to the water chamber through rubber hose.<br>
Spring loaded slider 8 is linked to the plunger 5 of the door lock as shown<br>
in figure 2.<br>
Operation of the safety device (Fig. 2) of the present invention -<br>
On availability of water in the water chamber, the air pressure in the<br>
elastic tube 9 presses the rubber diaphragm 6 which slides the spring<br>
loaded plunger 7.<br>
This movement of plunger 7 pushes the spring loaded slider 8,<br>
which in turn locks the position of door lock plunger as shown in figure<br>
2. Under this condition even if the power supply to the door lock fails or<br>
terminated, the plunger 5 of the door lock as shown in figure 1 will not be<br>
able to slide back under the effect of the spring. As a result the door of<br>
the appliance will remain in locked condition when the water is available<br>
in the water chamber.<br>
The situation where in water chamber does not contain water will<br>
effectively release the air column pressure on rubber diaphragm 6. This in<br>
turn will make spring loaded plunger 7 slide in the direction of rubber<br>
diaphragm.<br>
As a result spring loaded slider 8 will move from its position there<br>
by releasing plunger of the door lock for its sliding movemert to unlock<br>
the door of the appliance.<br>
