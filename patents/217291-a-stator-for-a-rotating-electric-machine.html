				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a stator for a rotating electric machine, and in particular it relates to a stator for a rotating electric machine having a magnet assembly which is press fit inside a yoke.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
One example of a permanent magnet rotating electric machine which has been proposed in the past is shown in Figure 7. A stator of this rotating electric machine includes a hollow, substantially cylindrical yoke 1 made from mild steel having soft magnetic properties, and a magnet assembly 3 is secured to the inner peripheral surface 2 of the yoke 1 by press fitting. The magnet assembly 3 has a plurality of magnets 4 which are disposed at prescribed intervals in the circumferential direction of the magnet assembly 3 and which form magnetic poles, and a magnet holder 5 in the form of a cylindrical frame which retains the magnets 4 inside the yoke 1 A rear cap 7 which holds a bearing 6 is provided at one end of the stator, i.e., at the open end of the yoke 1. A rotor 9 is rotatably supported by bearing 6 and by another bearing 8 located at the closed end of the yoke 1.<br>
Figure 8 is an exploded axonometric view of the stator of the rotating electric machine shown in Figure 7. As shown in this figure, the magnet assembly 3 of the stator includes a plurality of magnets 4, a plurality of covers 10 each of which is disposed on the radially inner side of one of the magnets 4,<br><br>
and a magnet holder 5 which holds the covers 10 and the magnets 4 in a prescribed relationship. When installed in a rotating electric machine, the magnet assembly 3 includes four magnets 4 and four covers 10, but for ease of illustration, only one of the magnets 4 and the associated cover 10 are shown in Figure 8. Each magnet 4 has an arcuate (fan-shaped) transverse cross section and a substantially rectangular outline when viewed in elevation. Each magnet 4 also has a first end surface 11, a second end surface 12, and two side surfaces 13 extending between the end surfaces 11 and 12. Each cover 10, which is formed by bending a sheet of material, covers the radially inner side and both side surfaces 13 of one of the magnets 4. Each cover 10 also includes two flanges, each of which extends away from one of the side surfaces 13 of the associated magnet 4 in the circumferential direction of the stator.<br>
The magnet holder 5 is a generally cylindrical frame including a first ring portion 15 having first support surfaces 14 which abut against and support the first end surface 11 of each magnet 4, a second ring portion 17 having a second support surface 16 which abuts against and supports the second end surface 12 of each magnet 4, and a plurality of connecting portions 18 which connect the first and second ring portions 15 and 17 to each other. In the following description, the sides the ring portions 15 and 17 which face the end surfaces 11 or 12 of the magnets 4 and on which the support surfaces 14 and 16 are formed will be referred to as the first sides of the ring portions, and the opposite sides of the ring portions 15 and 17 which face away from the magnets 4 will be referred to as the second sides thereof. The magnet holder 5 is typically made of an electrically insulating synthetic resin or similar material. The magnet holder 5 serves to hold the magnets 4 inside the yoke 1 in prescribed positions so as to form magnetic poles.    In this example, the outer<br><br>
Periphery of the upper end of the second ring portion 17 is beveled towards its second side so as to facilitate press fitting of the magnet holder 5 into the yoke 1 and so as to conform to the curved shape of the inner surface of the closed end of the yoke 1.<br>
Projections 19 and 20 which each contact the magnets 4 over a portion of the surface of the magnets 4 are provided on the first ring portion 15 and the connecting portions 18, respectively, of the magnet holder 5 in order to reduce friction between the magnets 4 or the covers 10 and the magnet holder 5 so as to facilitate assembly, and in order to absorb dimensional errors when the magnets 4 equipped with the covers 10 are installed in the magnet holder 5. Accordingly, the first support surfaces 14 which contact and support the first end surfaces 11 of the magnets 4 comprise the top surfaces of the projections 19 provided on the first ring portion 15, and the second support surface 16 is the flat surface of the first side of the second ring portion 17. Figures 9 and 10 are developed elevations of the magnet assembly 3 in an assembled state. As shown in these figures, in this example, each projection 19, which defines one of the first support surfaces 14, is provided at roughly the center of the width measured in the circumferential direction of the corresponding magnet 4, and only the central portion of the width of each magnet 4 in the circumferential direction contacts one of the projections 19. Therefore, a small gap G1 is present between the first side of the first support ring 15 and the first end surface 11 of the corresponding magnet 4 in those portions of the magnet 4 not contacting the corresponding projection 19. The width in the circumferential direction of the gap G1 on either side of the projection 19 where the magnet 4 is not supported by the projection 19 is L1.<br>
The magnets 4 and covers 10 are pressed into the magnet holder 5 to assemble the magnet assembly 3 shown in Figure 7, and then the first ring<br><br>
portion 15 is pressed upwards from below by a press fitting force P as shown by an arrow in Figure 10 to press fit the magnet assembly 3 inside the yoke 1 and thereby assemble a stator for a rotating electric machine.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, the press fitting force P which is applied when press fitting the magnet assembly 3 into the yoke 1 is applied to the first ring portion 15 of the magnet holder 5. Accordingly, when the magnet assembly 3 is press fit inside the yoke 1, the press fitting force P is transmitted to the first end surface 11 of each magnet 4 only through the first support surfaces 14 of the projections 19 of the first ring portion 15. On the other hand, the friction forces F1 and F2 between the yoke 1 and the magnets 4 act on the magnets 4 in the opposite direction from the press fitting force P. Therefore, only a force corresponding to frictional force F2 acts as a resultant force on the unsupported region outside of the first support surface 14 where the gap G1 is present, and a large shearing force acts on the widthwise end portions 21 of the first support surface 14. This shearing force produces a moment which is proportional to the circumferential width L1 of the gap G1 and which increases as press fitting proceeds, the variation in the press fitting force P becomes large, and eventually cracks 33 are formed in the magnets 4 or chipping thereof takes place. In this manner, the force acting on the magnets 4 at the end portions 21 of the first support surface 14 increases as the width LI of the unsupported region (the width of gap G1) increases.<br>
The unsupported region (the region where gap 01 is present) can be eliminated along with the problems resulting from the gap G1 by having each first support surface 14 of the first ring portion 15 be a flat surface which contacts the entire area of the first end surface 11 of the corresponding magnet 4. However, in this case, the frictional force between the magnets 4 and the magnet holder 5 becomes too large, and it becomes extremely difficult to press<br><br>
the magnets 4 into the magnet holder 5, so such an arrangement is not practical. As shown in Figure 11, it has also been proposed to form a flat first support surface 14 on the first ring portion 15 and to separate it from the magnets 4 so as to form a gap G2 between the first end surface 11 of the magnets 4 and the first support surface 14, with the gap G2 having approximately the same circumferential width as the first end surface 11 of the magnets 4, so that only one end surface of the magnets 4 is supported, i.e., the second end surface 12 which contacts the second ring portion 17. However, in this case, the magnets 4 can easily falloff the magnet holder 5, so it is necessary to hold the magnets 4 by some means until immediately before press fitting, and even after press fitting, the magnets 4 are not necessarily strongly held by the magnet holder 5, so providing such a gap G2 may cause a worsening of noise an^ vibrations of a rotating electric machine employing the magnet assembly 3. Therefore, the presence of this gap G2 is not desirable.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
A number of preferred embodiments of a stator for a rotating electric machine according to the present invention will be described while referring to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 shows a permanent magnet rotating electric machine equipped with a first embodiment of a stator for a rotating electric machine according to the present invention, and Figures 2-5 illustrate the stator of Figure 1 in greater detail. The overall structure of this rotating electric machine is similar to that of the rotating electric machine shown in Figures 7 - 9, and the same or corresponding parts as in Figures 7 - 9 are affixed with the same reference numbers. Accordingly, the following description will concentrate on the differences in structure.<br>
Figure 2 is an exploded axonometric view of a portion of the stator of the rotating electric machine shown in Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a developed elevation of a portion of the stator. Like the stator shown in Figures 7-9, this embodiment of a stator includes a cylindrical yoke 1 having an open end and a closed end, and a magnet assembly 3 press fit inside the yoke 1. The magnet assembly 3 includes a magnet holder 5 and a plurality of magnets 4 and associated covers 10 held by the magnet holder 5 so as to form magnetic poles<br><br>
of the rotating electric machine. When the magnet assembly 3 is completely assembled, it includes four magnets 4 and four covers 10, but for simplicity, only one of the magnets 4 and its cover 10 are shown in Figure 2. Like the magnet holder 5 of Figure 8, the magnet holder 5 of Figure 2 is a cylindrical frame made of an electrically insulating synthetic resin or similar material and including a first ring portion 25, a second ring portion 26 spaced from the first ring portion 25 in the lengthwise direction of the magnet holder 5, and a plurality of connecting portions 18 connecting the first and second ring portions 25 and 26 to each other. Each of the connecting portions 18 is equipped with a plurality of projections 20 for contacting a side surface 13 of one of the magnets 4. The first side of the first ring portion 25 (the side which faces the first end surfaces 11 of the magnets 4) has a flat upper surface without projections which defines a first support surface 28, and the first side of the second ring portion 26 (the side which faces the second end surfaces 12 of the magnets 4) has a plurality of projections 27 for reducing friction so as to facilitate the insertion of the magnets 4 into the magnet holder 5 and for absorbing a certain amount of dimensional errors between the magnets 4 and the magnet holder 5. Each of the projections 27 has an upper surface which defines a second support surface 29 which contacts the second end surface 12 of one of the magnets 4 over a portion of the circumferential width of the magnet 4, i.e., over less than the entire area of the second end surface 12. The distance in the lengthwise direction of the magnet holder 5 between the first support surface 28 and each of the second support surfaces 29 is such that when the magnets 4 are inserted into the magnet holder 5, the first end surface 11 of each magnet 4 contacts the first support surface 28, and the second end surface 12 contacts one of the second support surfaces 29.<br>
The stator of Figure 2 is assembled by inserting the magnets 4 and<br><br>
associated covers 10 into the magnet holder 5 to form a magnet assembly 3 and then press fitting tlie magnet assembly 3 into the yoke 1. Since the first support surface 28 of the first ring portion 25 is flat and extends over the entire area of the first end surface 11 of each magnet 4, the press fitting force P which is applied to the first ring portion 25 during press fitting is distributed over the 3ntire first end surface 11 of each magnet 4, and there is substantially no circumferential width to any gaps between the magnets 4 and the first support surface 28 where the magnets 4 are unsupported. Therefore, damage to the magnets 4 due to the action of the press fitting force and frictional forces opposing the press fitting force is prevented.<br>
Each of the second support surfaces 29 of the second ring portion 26 contacts less than the entire area of the second end surface 12 of one of the magnets 4 so that the frictional force between the magnets 4 and the second support surfaces 29 is not so large as to impede the insertion of the magnets 4 into the magnet holder 5. As shown in Figure 3, in the illustrated example, each of the projections 27 on the second ring portion 26 is located near the center of the width in the circumferential direction of one of the magnets 4, and a small gap G is present between the second ring portion 26 and the second end surface 12 of each magnet 4 on either widthwise side of the projection 27 in the circumferential direction of the magnet 4. In Figure 3, a single projection 27 is provided for each magnet 4, but it is also possible for there to be a plurality of projections 27 for each magnet 4 spaced from each other in the circumferential direction of the magnet 4.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the press fitting force P which is applied to the magnet assembly 3 when it is press fit into the yoke 1 of a stator of a rotating electric machine is transmitted from the entire first support surface 28, which is flat, to the entire area of the first end surface 11   of each magnet 4.<br><br>
Accordingly, the press fitting force P is distributed over a broad area and applied substantially uniformly, and the frictional forces F3 and F4 between the magnets 4 and the yoke 1 are also supported by the first support surfaces 28. Therefore, excessive moments are not applied to the magnets 4 and damage is not imparted thereto. Accordingly, insertion of the magnets 4 into the magnet holder 5 can be easily carried out with a simple structure, and press fitting of the magnet assembly 3 into the yoke 1 can be rapidly carried out without taking any particular cautions to prevent damage to the magnets 4.<br>
Figure 4 is a developed elevation of a portion of a magnet assembly 3 of another embodiment of a stator for a rotating electric machine according to the present invention. This stator includes a cylindrical magnet holder 5 including a first ring portion 31 corresponding to the first ring portion 25 of Figure 3, a second ring portion 34 corresponding to the second ring portion 26 of Figure 3, and a plurality of connecting portions 18 connecting the first and second ring portions 31 and 34 to each other. Each of the connecting portions 18 is equipped with a plurality of projections 20 for contacting a side surface 13 of one of the magnets 4. In this embodiment, the first ring portion 31 includes a plurality of projections 32 formed on its first side in the space between two adjoining connecting portions 18 and spaced from each other in the circumferential direction of the first ring portion 31, and the top surface of each projection 32 defines a first support surface 33 for contacting a portion of the first end surface 11 of one of the magnets 4. In the illustrated example, three of the projections 32 are provided at equal intervals in the space between two adjoining connecting portions 18, and a small gap G2 is present between the first ring portion 31 and the first end surface 11 of a magnet 4 contacting the projections 32 in the regions between adjoining projections 32 and between a projection 32 and an adjoining connecting portion 18.   The width L2 of each<br><br>
gap G2 measured in the circumferential direction of the magnet holder 5 is extremely small compared to the width L1 of the gaps G1 for the magnet assembly 3 shown in Figure 10 when comparing two magnet assemblies 3 of the same size. Therefore, the moments which act on portions of a magnet 4 disposed in the magnet holder 5 where the magnet 4 is not supported by one of the first support surface 33, which correspond in magnitude to the size of the gaps G2, are small, so there is no cracking or chipping of the magnets 4. In this example, the surface of the first side of the second ring portion 34 defines a flat second support surface 35 which extends over and contacts the entire area of the second end surface 12 of each magnet 4, as in the example shown in Figure 9. However, it is also possible for the second ring portion 35 to have one or more projections (like projection 27 of Figure 3, for example) associated with each magnet 4, with each projection defining a second support surface which contacts only a portion of the area of the second end surface 12 of one of the magnets 4. In this embodiment, both the first support surfaces 33 and the second support surface 35 extend over a large area of the end surfaces 11 and 12 of the magnets 4, so more stable support of the magnets 4 is provided.<br>
Figure 5 is an exploded axonometric view of a portion of another embodiment of a stator for a rotating electric machine according to the present invention. Like the preceding embodiment, this embodiment includes a cylindrical yoke 1 like that of the embodiment of Figure 2 and a magnet assembly 3 which is press fit inside the yoke 1. The magnet assembly 3 includes a cylindrical magnet holder 5 and a plurality of magnets 4 and associated covers 10 held by the magnet holder 5 so as to form magnetic poles of a rotating electric machine. In an assembled state, the magnet assembly 3 is equipped with four magnets 4 and four covers 10, but for ease of illustration, only one of the magnets 4 and its cover 10 are shown in Figure 5.   The<br><br>
magnet holder 5 includes a first ring portion 41, a second ring portion 34 spaced from the first ring portion 41, and a plurality of connecting portions 18 connecting the first and second ring portions 41 and 34 to each other. Each of the connecting portions 18 is equipped with a plurality of projections 20 for contacting a side surface 13 of one of the magnets 4.<br>
The first ring portion 41 includes a plurality of circumferential projections<br>
42	each extending continuously between two adjoining connecting portions 18 along the radially inner region of the first ring portion 41.   A radial projection<br>
43	extends substantially radially outwards from each of the circumferential projections 42 to the outer periphery of the first ring portion 41. The top surface of each circumferential projection 42 and the associated radial projection 43 defines a first support surface 44 for supporting the first end surface 11 of one of the magnets 4. The second ring portion 34 is identical to the second ring portion 34 of Figure 4 and has a flat surface on its first side defining a second support surface 35. When the magnet assembly 3 is assembled, each of the magnets 4 and its associated cover 10 are inserted into the magnet holder 5 with the first end surface 11 of the magnet 4 contacting one of the first support surfaces 44 and with the second end surface 12 of the magnet 4 contacting the second support surface 35. Each first support surface 44 contacts the radially inner region of the first end surface 11 of one of the magnets 4 over the entire circumferential width of the magnet 4 and a small portion of the radially outer region of the first end surface 11 along the radial projection 43. Because the first support surface 44 contacts the first end surface 11 of the magnet 4 over the entire circumferential width of the magnet 4, there are no gaps present between the circumferential projection 42 and the first end surface 11 of the magnet 4, so debris such as chips from the magnets 4 can be prevented from reaching the rotor when the stator is installed in a<br><br>
rotating electric machine. In addition, because each first support surface 44 contacts the first end surface 11 of a magnet 4 over a broad area, moments which could produce cracking or chipping of the magnet 4 during press fitting of the magnet assembly 3 into the yoke 1 are prevented. The radial projections 43 act to stabilize the support of the magnets 4.<br>
Figure 6 is an axonometric view of a portion of a magnet holder 5 of another embodiment of a stator according to the present invention. The magnet holder 5 includes a first ring portion 41 which is similar to the first ring portion 41 of the embodiment of Figure 5, but which includes a plurality of radial projections 45 extending substantially radially outwards from each circumferential projection 42 of the first ring portion 41, with the radial projections 45 being disposed at equal intervals in the circumferential direction of the first ring portion 41 between adjoining connecting portions 18 of the magnet holder 5. The top surface of the circumferential projection 42 and the associated radial projections 45 together define a first support surface 44 for contacting the first end surface 11 of a magnet 4. In the illustrated example, there are three radial projections 45 for each magnet 4, but a different number of radial projections 45 may be employed. With this structure, the magnets 4 can be supported still more stably. The structure and operation of this embodiment are otherwise the same as for the preceding embodiment.<br>
A stator for a rotating electric machine according to the present invention as described above can provide benefits such as the following.<br>
(1) At least one of the end surfaces of each magnet of the stator is contacted over only a portion of its area by the corresponding support surface of the magnet holder, so the frictional force between the magnets and the magnet holder can be maintained at a level which does not interfere with insertion of the magnets into the magnet holder.   Therefore, the magnets can<br><br>
be easily inserted into the magnet holder.<br>
(2)	In one embodiment, a first support surface is a flat surface vi/hich<br>
contacts substantially the entire area of one end surface of each magnet, so<br>
during press fitting of the magnet assembly into the yoke, excessive moments<br>
are not applied to the magnets, and press fitting can be carried out without<br>
damage to the magnets.<br>
(3)	In another embodiment, first support surfaces comprise the<br>
surfaces of a plurality of projections formed on the first ring portion. Each<br>
magnet is contact by the first support surfaces over a large region of its first<br>
end surface, so in this case as well, there is no damage to the magnets due to<br>
the application of excessive moments during press fitting of the magnet<br>
assembly into the yoke.<br>
(4)	In another embodiment, first support surfaces comprise the top surface of a circumferential projection and of a radial projection extending from the circumferential projection. Each circumferential projection contacts the radially inner region of one end surface of one of the magnets over the entire circumferential width of the magnet, while the radial projection supports a portion of the radially outer region of the end surface. As a result, there are no gaps between the radially inner region of the magnet and the first ring portion, so debris such as pieces of the magnet which have fallen off the magnet are prevented from entering into the interior of the stator through gaps and reaching the rotor of a rotating electric machine with which the stator is employed, and support of the magnets can be stabilized by the radial projection.<br>
(5)	In yet another embodiment, a plurality of radial projections extend from each circumferential projection, so the magnets can be supported still more stably.<br><br>
 WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A stator for a rotating electric machine comprising:<br>
A hollow cylindrical yoke having an open end and a closed end; and<br>
a magnet assembly which is press fit inside the yoke, the magnet assembly comprising:<br>
a plurality of magnets each having a rectangular outline as viewed in elevation, an arcuate transverse cross section, a first end surface, and a second end surface; and<br>
a cylindrical magnet holder comprising a first ring portion, a second ring portion spaced from the first ring portion and positioned closer to the closed end of the yoke than the first ring portion, and a plurality of connecting portions connecting the first and second ring portions, each of the magnets being mounted on the magnet holder between two of the connecting portions to define magnetic poles of the stator with the first end surface of each magnet contacting the first ring portion and the second end surface of each magnet contacting the second ring portion, at least one end surface of each magnet contacting one of the ring portions of the end surface, partially, the first ring portion contacting the first end surface of each magnet over a sufficiently large area of the first end surface to prevent damage to the magnets during press fitting of the magnet assembly into the yoke.<br>
2.	A stator for a rotating electric machine as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first ring portion has a flat surface which contacts the first end surface of each magnet over the entire area of the first end surface, and the second ring portion has a projection associated with each magnet, each projection contacting the second end surface of one of the magnets of the second end surface, partially.<br>
3.	A stator for a rotating electric machine as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first ring portion comprises a plurality of projections associated with each magnet  each projection contacting the first end surface of one of the magnets of the first end surface, partially.<br><br>
4.	A stator for a rotating electric machine as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first<br>
ring portion comprises a circumferential projection extending in a circumferential<br>
direction of the first ring portion and a radial projection extending from the<br>
circumferential projection in a radially outwards direction of the first ring portion, the<br>
circumferential projection contacting only a radially inner region of the first end<br>
surface of one of the magnets over the entire circumferential width of the first end<br>
surface, and the radial projection contacting a portion of a radially outer region of the<br>
first end surface.<br>
5.	A stator for a rotating electric machine as claimed in claim 4, wherein the first<br>
ring portion comprises a plurality of radial projections each extending from the<br>
circumferential projection in a radially outwards direction of the first ring portion and<br>
each contacting a portion of a radially outer region of the first end surface.<br>
