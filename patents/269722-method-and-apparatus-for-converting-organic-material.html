				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONVERTING ORGANIC MATERIAL<br>
Description:<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for intensifying the energy content of an organic material by converting the material into hydrocarbons and the resulting product thereof.<br>
Background:<br>
The world's energy demand is increasing, and the fossil fuel sources are depleted, leading to increasing competition for the available energy sources, and thereby hampering economical growth by high energy prices. To overcome this situation renewable energy sources must be brought into exploitation. The only renewable energy source with sufficient capacity to cover significant parts of the energy demand is biomass conversion. Biomass is efficiently converted into heating and electricity by existing technologies, but transportation fuels, which accounts for one third of the total energy consumption, must be available as high energy density fluids, preferably compatible with fossil fuels like diesel oil and gasoline. Therefore technologies for transforming and intensifying the energy content of biomass are required. At the same time all kinds of waste are produced all over the world from factories, households etc., and as a result waste disposal has increased to an insuperable amount of waste over the last decades. Dumping of waste has become an increasingly problem and therefore a cheap effective dispose of waste has become increasingly more important.<br>
A known method of waste disposal is refuse incineration. But numerous wastes are due to the high water content not suitable for incineration, e.g. sewage sludge and industrial waste water treatment residues. Incineration of such wastes require additional energy input, i.e. the overall process energy is negative.<br>
In view of this new methods have been developed for treatment of such wastes. However these known methods are still very limited in regards to the kind of waste, which may be treated in the same apparatus and in regards to how much of the converted waste which is turned into recyclable products. Additionally, the energy of the organic material, which is converted into recyclable products are still very low compared to the amount of energy<br>
added to the method. Therefore in  order to make conversion of organic<br>
material commercial interesting there is still a need of a more energy effective<br>
process.<br>
Furthermore, known methods have shown that char and soot deposit inside<br>
the apparatus in such an amount that regular cleaning of the apparatus is<br>
needed.   Such   cleaning   operations   are   time   consuming   and   therefore<br>
expensive.<br>
Corrosion of the materials used for making apparatus for the converting of<br>
organic material  has  in  known  methods  been  such  a  problem that the<br>
materials for these components had to be chosen in a more expensive group<br>
of materials.  This  problem  of corrosion  has  increased  the  cost  of the<br>
apparatus for the converting and therefore decreased the incentive for using<br>
converting of waste instead of refuse incineration.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
An objective of the present invention is to provide an improved method and an improved apparatus for converting organic material, such as waste, sludge, biomass etc., into recyclable products, such as hydrocarbon fuel, which method at least partly overcome or at least mitigate the aforementioned problems and disadvantages.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved recyclable product from the conversion of organic material, which improved product is reusable as some kind of energy. These objectives and several others objectives, which will become evident below are obtained by a first aspect of the present invention by providing a method for converting an organic material into hydrocarbon fuels, comprising the steps of:<br>
-	pressurising said organic material in a fluid to a pressure above 225 bar,<br>
and<br>
-	heating said organic material in said fluid to a temperature above 200 C in<br>
the presence of a homogeneous catalyst comprising a compound of at least<br>
one element of group IA of the periodic table of elements,<br>
wherein the method further comprises the steps of:<br>
-	contacting said organic material in said fluid with a heterogeneous catalyst<br>
comprising a compound of at least one element of group IVB of the periodic<br>
table and/or alpha-alumina, and<br>
- adjusting said fluid to a pH value of above 7.<br>
An improved method for converting organic material into recyclable products is hereby obtained. By contacting the organic material with a heterogeneous catalyst comprising a compound of at least one element of group IVB of the periodic table and/or alpha-alumina, the catalyst may be reused and a continuously converting of organic material is possible. Thereby the amount of catalyst spent for converting one amount of organic material is decreased whereby the cost for converting the material is considerable decreased. Additionally, the process time has been decreased considerably due to the fact that dividing the catalyst process into two separate processes increases the velocity of conversion.<br>
Furthermore, by adjusting the fluid to above 7 the corrosion of the materials used for the involved components in the apparatus is considerably decreased. The corrosion of these materials has decreased to such an amount that cheap standard materials may be used for the construction of the apparatus. According to another aspect of the present invention the method may comprise the step of maintaining the pH value of said fluid containing said organic material in the range 7-14, such as 7-12 and preferably in the range 7-10 such as in the range 7-9.5. It is hereby obtained that when converting the organic material into hydrocarbon fuel the corrosion of the materials used for the involved components of the apparatus is substantial decreased to at least an insignificant amount of corrosion.<br>
Furthermore, according to an aspect of the present invention the method may comprise the step of pre-treating the organic material at a pressure of 4-15 bar at the temperature of 100-170 C for a period of 0.5-2 hours. By pre-treating the organic material at this pressure, the organic material is pre-converted whereby the subsequent conversion may be performed more quickly than without the pre-treatment.<br>
Subsequently, the pre-treating step may according to another aspect of the invention comprise a step of size reducing of the material such as a cutting, grinding, milling, or sieving step or a combination thereof. By such a size reduction the conversion process of the organic material is performed even more quickly than without the size reduction.<br>
Additionally, the pre-treating step may comprise the step of adding additives to the fluid according to the present invention, whereby the conversion<br>
process is improved even further in regards to speed of the conversion time and in regards to the resulting product from the conversion of the organic material into hydrocarbon fuels. The product resulting from the conversion of the organic material may by adding these additives be regulated, so that the resulting product may have variable composition of oil, methanol, water, water soluble organlcs, water soluble salts, etc. It is then possible to adjust the recyclable product in regards to the wishes of the subsequent use of the products.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention the step of pre-treating may comprise the step of adjusting the pH of said fluid comprising said organic material to above 7. It hereby obtained to adjustment of the pH value in the fluid comprising the organic material at an early stage of the conversion process, whereby the process time for the conversion is reduced. By the step of pre-treating the fluid comprising the organic material it is possible to increase the amount of solid-state material in the fluid, which again leads to a higher rate of conversion and thereby a higher production capacity. This results in a more efficient and cost saving converting of organic material.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention the method may further comprise a step of separating particles from the fluid comprising the organic material. By separating particles before contacting the fluid comprising the organic material with the heterogeneous catalyst the product resulting from the conversion process, such as oil, is then substantially free of being bound to these particles and therefore much more reusable straight after this conversion process. A second process, such as an refinery is thereby dispensable.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention the method may further comprise a second step of heating the fluid. The temperature of fluid comprising the organic material is hereby adjustable just before contacting the heterogeneous catalyst, whereby the process is optimised, which leads to a reduced process time. Furthermore, by separating the particles away from the fluid at such an early stage a substantially amount of energy for transporting the separated particles is saved, which again decreases the amount of energy spend in the conversion process as a total.<br>
Additionally, the method may according to the invention comprise a second separating of particles, which step is merely for safety reason in regards to the first step of separating particles. This step reduces for the same reasons as the first step of separating particles the total amount of energy spend for the conversion process.<br>
Furthermore, the method may according to the invention comprise a step of cooling the fluid. By cooling the fluid the resulting product from converting of the organic material may be optimized in relations to the composition of product.<br>
Advantageously, the step of cooling may according to the present invention be performed by heat exchanging with the first step of heating and/or a step of pre-heating the fluid in the pre-treating step. It is hereby obtained to reuse the heat from the fluid, which needs to cool down before the second part of conversion into the recyclable products, in the fluid in the first part of conversion process before contacting the fluid with the heterogeneous catalyst. The total amount of energy for the converting of organic material is thereby kept to a minimum.<br>
Said method may according to one aspect the present invention further comprise a step of separation gas from the fluid, such as fuel gas. By separating this gas one kind of recyclable product is obtained, which was an objective of the invention.<br>
The method may according to one aspect the present invention further comprise the step that the fuel gas is used for heating the fluid in the second heating step. By using the separated gas it is reused in converting the organic material and therefore resuable.<br>
Furthermore, the method may according to the invention further comprise a step of filtrating water and water soluble organics from oil and water soluble salts in a first membrane-filter. By this separating a recyclable products is obtained and a further converting into recyclable products is possible. In an aspect of the present invention the water and water soluble organics are transformed into electricity in a direct methanol fuel cell. This is one way of using one of the recyclable products of the present invention. It may also be regarded as a subsequent step of converting the recycle products into a usable product in form of electricity.<br>
The method may also according to another aspect of the present invention comprise a second step of filtering water soluble organics from the water, such as an purification of methanol in a second membrane-filter. By this conversion step one recycle product is obtained.<br>
Subsequently, said one or more membrane-filters may be selected from the group of membrane processes comprising ultra-filtration, nano-filtration, reverse osmosis or pervaporation or a combination thereof. By this selection different kinds of recycle products are obtainable.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the water and water soluble organics after the second filtering step may be transformed into drinkable water in a process of reverse osmosis. By the method comprising the process of reverse osmosis one very usable recyclable product is obtained. According to one aspect of the present invention, the water soluble organic may comprising up-concentrated methanol may be re-circulated to the pre-treating step. A further optimization of the converting method is hereby obtained, and the converted product of up-concentrated methanol is reused. Additionally, the method may according to one aspect of the invention comprise a phase separator, whereby separation of oil as product is obtained. According to one aspect of the present invention, the step of contacting the organic material in the fluid with a heterogeneous catalyst may be performed while the temperature is kept substantially constant. By keeping the temperature constant in the contacting step the contacting of the fluid with the heterogeneous catalyst is kept in the same condition and the conversion is therefore constant throughout the contacting step. A further advantage is that the equilibriums and reaction rates of the chemical reactions involved in the conversion are kept constant throughout the contacting step, thereby ensuring uniformity in the products formed by the conversion. In another aspect of the present invention, the temperature in the step of contacting may be in the range 200-650 °C, such as in the range 200-450 °C, and preferably in the range 200-374 °C, and even more preferably in the range 250-374 °C, such as in the range 275-350 °C. By keeping these low temperatures the conversion process is using less energy in converting the same amount of organic material than at higher temperatures. A low temperature together with a pH value above 7 decreases the corrosion of the materials used for the apparatus in which the present method is performed.<br>
A low temperature in the contacting step increases the fraction of the organic material being converted into hydrocarbon fuels, and thereby the oil production capacity of the contacting step. At such low temperatures the solubility of salts is high compared to higher temperature whereby the conversion process is further advantageous due to almost no salts depositing occurs inside the apparatus. Furthermore, at such low temperatures the organic material is less converted into soot and tar, which products are not very recyclable. Finally such low temperature allows construction of the apparatus from less corrosion resistant materials, further improving the competitive.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the pressure for said conversion may be in the range 225-600 bars, such as in the range 225-400 bars and preferably in the range 225-350 bars, such as in the range 240-300 bars. By using pressures inside these ranges it is obtained that standard components and equipment may be used for the present method whereby the cost of the conversion process and apparatus is substantially decreased compared to the same at higher pressures.<br>
Furthermore, the method may according to the invention further comprise the step of contacting is done in less than 30 minutes, such as less than 20 minutes, preferably less 10 minutes, such as less than 7,5 minutes, and even more preferably in the range 0,5-6 minutes, such as in the range 1-5 minutes. By contacting the fluid at in a short period the conversion process time is decreased without decreasing the conversion processing of organic material substantially.<br>
Additionally, the compound of at least one element of group IVB of the periodic table may comprise zirconium and/or titanium according to another aspect of the present invention. By using zirconium and/or titanium as a heterogeneous catalyst the conversion process time is decreased without decreasing the conversion processing of organic material. In another aspect of the present invention the compound of at least one element of group IVB of the periodic table may be on an oxide and/or hydroxide form or a combination of the two. By using the heterogeneous catalyst on an oxide and/or hydroxide form the conversion process time is decreased without decreasing the conversion processing of organic material. Advantageously, the compound of at least one element of group IVB of the<br>
periodic table is at least partly on a sulphate or sulphide form according to another aspect of the present invention. By using the heterogeneous catalyst on a sulphate or sulphide form the conversion process time is decreased without decreasing the conversion processing of organic material. According to one aspect of the present invention, the heterogeneous catalyst may further comprise at least one element selected from the group consisting of Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Cr, W, Mn, Mo, V, Sn, Zn, Si in an amount up to 20 % by weight, such as an amount up to 10 % by weight, preferably in an amount up to 5 % by weight, such as up to 2,5 % by weight. By using the aforementioned heterogeneous catalyst together with one or more elements of this group the conversion process time is substantially decreased without decreasing the conversion processing of organic material. Furthermore, these elements may be on an oxide and/or hydroxide form according to another aspect of the present invention, whereby the conversion process time is further decreased without decreasing the conversion processing of organic material.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention said heterogeneous catalyst may be in the form of a suspended particles, tablets, pellets, rings, cylinders, a honey comb structure, a fibrous structure and/or a combination of these. The advantage of said heterogeneous catalyst structures is to control the flow distribution of the organic material stream being contacted with the catalyst, while ensuring reasonable pressure drop and contact to all of the catalyst surface.<br>
Additionally, said heterogeneous catalyst is at least partly contained in a reactor according to another aspect of the present invention. It is hereby possible to reuse that part of the catalyst, which is inside the reactor. Advantageously, said reactor is a fixed bed reactor according to another aspect of the present invention.

By having this BET surface area, the conversion process time is further decreased without decreasing the<br>
quality of the conversion process, as sufficient catalytic active surface area is ensured.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, said heterogeneous catalyst may comprise at least one surface area stabilizer selected from the group consisting of Si, La, Y or Ce or a combination thereof. By having this surface stabilizer, the catalyst service lifetime time is further expanded without decreasing the quality of the conversion process.

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention will in the following be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 show schematic drawing of laboratory scale set-up,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a general process flow sheet,<br>
Fig.   3  shows one aspect of product  recovery  according  to the  present<br>

Fig. 6 shows yet another aspect of product recovery according to the present invention.<br>
The drawings are schematically and shown for the purpose of illustration. Fig. 1 is a schematic drawing of the laboratory set-up used for the tests given in the examples. The pre-treated fluid containing the homogeneous catalysts and organic material to be converted is supplied to the system at the position A. The fluid is pressurized by means of the pump 1 and is heated to approximately 230 C in the heater 2 comprising a heat exchanger and a temperature controller TIC. A second fluid is supplied to the system at position B. This stream is pressurized by means of the pump 3 and heated in the heater 4 to the temperature necessary to obtain the desired conversion temperature of the mixed fluid streams at position 4, comprinsing a heat exchanger and a temperature controller TIC. The heterogeneous catalyst is located in the tubular catalytic reactor 5. After contact with the heterogeneous catalyst, the fluid containing the converted organic material is cooled to ambient temperature in the cooler 6, and filtered in the filter 7 for separation and collection of suspended particles. Subsequently the fluid is expanded to ambient pressure over the valve 8. The system pressure is maintained by controlling the flow through 8, utilizing the pressure controller PIC. The expanded fluid temperature is measured with the thermocouple 9. The liquid fraction of the stream is collected in a liquid trap 10, and the gas is vented off from the trap at position G. The flow rate of the produced gas is continuously measured by a gas meter placed in H (not shown). The composition of the gas is analysed by gas chromatography (not shown) of a small sample taken through I, at controlled pressure established by the flow control valve and the pressure controller (PIC) 11.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic drawing of a preferred aspect of a method according to the present invention. Organic material for conversion is received in a feed storage (not shown on the figure). Said organic material may comprise a wide range of biomass and wastes, and may also comprise fossil fuels such coal, shale, orimulsion, heavy fractions of crude oil etc. Many aspects according to the present invention involve treatment of organic material from a mixture of different sources of material as just mentioned.<br>
The feed storage will typically have a capacity corresponding to three days of plant operation. The feed storage is preferably a concealed and agitated silo, such as an agitated concrete silo. A fluid containing the organic material is pumped to the pre-treatment step 1 at position A.<br>
The first part of the pre-treatment comprises in this aspect a size reduction of the feed e.g. by cutting, grinding, milling and/or sieving the material. This size reduction may be an integral part of feeding pump (not shown). During the feeding operation to the pre-treatment the pressure of the fluid containing the organic material to be treated is increased to a pressure in the range 4-15 bars. In the second part of the pre-treatment the fluid containing said organic material is typically maintained in a pre-treatment vessel for a period of 0,5-2 hours. The pre-treatment vessel is preferably an agitated vessel, which is maintained at a temperature of 100-170 C, and preferably in the range 110 to 140 C. The energy for this pre-heating of said fluid comprising said organic material to be converted is preferably supplied, by recovering heat from one of the process streams to be cooled. In the figure this is illustrated by integrating the heat exchanger 2 in vessel for recovery of heat from the process stream D.<br>
The pH in the pre-treatment vessel is adjusted to a value above 7, and preferable in the range 8-10. This pH adjustment is in many aspects according to the present invention performed by adding additives to the vessel either directly into the pre-treatment vessel and/or through its inlet, e.g. by adding a base, which may also comprise an element of group IA of the periodic table. Non-limiting examples of such additives are KOH, NaOH, K2CO3, Na2CO3, ash from biomass or coal combustion. Such additives may be added to the vessel through a stream S either streaming into stream A or streaming directly into the vessel 1. Feed of the stream S may be provided by a feeding pump (not shown).<br>
During the residence in the pre-treatment vessel larger molecules such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are hydrolyzed, and cells from biomass addition is opened facilitating the release of cell contents, such as salts. For a number of potential feedstock this cell opening involve release of catalysts such as potassium from the feedstock itself, thereby allowing for a very efficient process. A number of other additives may also enhance the pre-conversion of the organic material and are further advantageous for the<br>
subsequent processing. Such other additives include alcohols, such as methanol, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and/or ketones. In a preferred aspect of the invention a number of such additives being utilized in the pre-treatment, are produced in-situ in the process and re-circulated to the pre-treatment step as shown by the streams E and F. Typical compositions of these recirculation streams is further described in relation to the figures 3-5. A fluid stream containing pre-converted organic material is withdrawn from pre-treatment vessel by the feed pump 3, and pressurized to the operating pressure e.g. 250 bars. The feed pump may comprise a plunger pump. After pressurization the fluid containing the pre-converted organic material, the homogeneous catalyst and other additives is heated in the first heating step 4 by heat exchange with the hot converted product stream from the catalytic reactor. The temperature of the fluid containing the pre-converted organic material will in many applications according to the present invention be in the order of 20-30 °C below the operating temperature of the catalytic reactor. During this first heating step the organic material in the feed is further thermally decomposed. A number of undesirable side reactions may proceed during this thermal decomposition, such soot and char formation. Besides reducing the overall efficiency of the process, this may lead to operational problems such as plugging or reduced efficiency of heat exchanger, and deposition on downstream equipment. The aforementioned additives reduce these undesirable side reactions and enhance further the conversion of the organic material into desirable products. From the heat exchanger 4, the fluid containing said pre-converted organic material may pass a first particle separation device 5 for collection of suspended particles, which may be formed during said pre-conversion during heat-up. This particles separation device 5 may comprise any conventional means for particle separation, e.g. a cyclone, a filter, a gravimetric settling chamber etc. Particles collected are withdrawn from the process shown by the stream B.<br>
After the first particle separation device 5 the fluid containing said pre-converted organic material is mixed with a re-circulating stream from the catalytic reactor. This mixing will typically increase the temperature of the mixed fluid with 10-20 C, and the recirculation will further introduce desirable compounds for the further conversion into the feed.After mixing with the re-circulation stream the mixed fluid passes to a trimheater (second heating unit) 6, wherein the temperature is raised to the operating temperature of the catalytic reactor 7. The trimheater 6 may in many aspects according to the present invention be a gas or oil fired heater, and is preferably at least partly fuelled by re-circulating gas and/or other fuel products produced in the process. In a preferred aspect, this trimheater is fuelled by re-circulating the produced gas denoted I in fig. 3. The re-circulation of said produced gas I may include a purification step. In the catalytic reactor 7, the fluid containing homogeneous catalyst, additives, and pre-converted organic material is contacted with the heterogeneous catalyst. The heterogeneous catalyst will typically be contained in a tubular fixed bed, and the catalytic reactor may comprise multiple tubular fixed beds. During the conversion a dissolved fuel gas, a water soluble organics and an oil is generally produced. The product distribution is adjustable within a wide range of concentration of resulting products as shown in the examples below, and may be controlled by selecting a suitable combination of residence time, re-circulation flow rate, reaction temperature, and concentration of homogeneous catalyst and additives. Part of the product stream from the catalytic reactor is re-circulated by the pump 8, and mixed with the fluid containing the pre-converted organic material as described above.<br>
The remaining part corresponding to the mass flow of the fluid containing the pre-converted organic material before mixing with the re-circulating stream is withdrawn to the second particle separation device 9. As for the first particle separation device this second particles separation device may comprise any conventional means for particle separation e.g. a cyclone, a filter, a gravimetric settling chamber etc. The main feature is to provide a hot separation of potential suspended particles produced oil prior to cooling and expansion to avoid adsorption of the oil to the suspended particles. However, in a number of applications of the present invention e.g. for feedstock with a low ash content this particle separation device may be optional. Particles collected in the second particle separation device are withdrawn from the process shown by the stream C.<br>
Subsequent to the passage of the second particle separation device the fluid stream is cooled in by heat exchange with the feed stream in the heat exchanger 4, and in the heat exchanger 2 and expanded to a pressure in the range 75-225 bars over the expansion valve 10, and separated in the product recovery system 11. Some of the separated fluid stream from the product recovery system 11, such as the streams F and/or E may be re-circulated to the pre-treatment step as described above. The product recovery system 11 is further illustrated and described below in the figures 3-6. The separation system, illustrated in figure 3, comprises a gas-liquid separator 12, separating the gas products in stream I and the liquid products in stream J. In an aspect the gas product is used internally for fuelling the trimheater 6. The liquid products are further separated in a first membrane filter 13. The membrane filtration separation is pressure driven, and in many applications applying a nano- or ultrafiltration membrane. The filtration retentate in stream L includes parts of the feed water, the oil product and the dissolved inorganic compounds, e.g. salts from the feedstock and the homogenous catalyst. The oil product is separated from stream L in an oil separator (phase separator unit) 14 operating at atmospheric conditions, and forming the oil product stream H. The remaining water and dissolved inorganic compounds forms stream 0. The main part of stream O is recycled to the pre-conversion 1, 2 in stream E, thereby recycling the homogenous catalyst, while a purge stream P is discharged to balance the inorganic compound input from the feedstock.<br>
The further processing of the membrane filtration permeate, denoted stream K, is illustrated in figure 4-6. Stream K contains smaller water soluble organics like C 1 - 4 alcohols and carboxylic acids.<br>
In one aspect illustrated in fig. 4 stream K is fed to a separation unit (membrane filter) 15, producing pure water of drinking water quality in stream G and a stream of water soluble organics in stream F. The separation unit 15 is in an aspect of the invention a reverse osmosis membrane unit, comprising a multitude of membrane modules. The retained water soluble organics in stream F are recycled to the pre-conversion step 1, 2. In a further aspect, illustrated in fig. 5, stream K is split into a concentrated water soluble organics stream F and an organics depleted water stream Q. The separation unit 16 involved is in many applications a membrane separation driven by temperature or concentration gradients, like membrane distillation or pervaporation.<br>
The water stream Q is further purified in a polishing step 17, producing the pure water stream G. The polishing step 17 is preferably an activated carbon filter or like means for absorption of very low concentrations of impurities from a water stream.<br>
In an aspect illustrated in fig. 6 the water soluble organic stream K is fed to a direct methanol fuel cell 18, producing electricity and a process water stream R. The direct methanol fuel cell 18 might include feed stream and effluent conditioning steps.<br>

Additionally the following are definitions used in the description of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The term hydrocarbon fuel is in the present invention intended to define all<br>
hydrocarbon based fuels, which may or may not comprise other elements<br>
than carbon and hydrogen, e.g. some of said hydrocarbons may comprise<br>
oxygen and other elements e.g. in the form of groups of alcohols, aldehydes,<br>
ketones, carboxylic acid, ester, esthers etc. and reaction products thereof.<br>
The membrane processes of the present invention is well known in the prior art (e.g. W.S. HO et al, "Membrane Handbook", Van Nordstrand Reinhold, p. 103-132,p.263-446,<br>
1992, ISBN 0-442-23747-2, K. Scott, "Handbook of Industrial Membranes" Elsevier Science Publishers, 1995, p. 3-163, p. 331-355, p.575-630, ISBN 1 85617 233 3)<br>
The surface areas referred to throughout this specification and claims are the nitrogen BET surface areas determined by the method described in the article by Brunauer, P. Emmett and E. Teller, J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 60, p. 309 (1938). This method depends on the condensation of nitrogen into the pores, and is effective for measuring pores with pore diameters in the range of 10 A to 600 A. The volume of nitrogen adsorbed is related to the surface area per unit weight of the support.<br>
It is well known in the prior art that the activity of a catalyst is proportional to the surface area (BET), and that catalysts may show a significant activity drop over time, when subjected to e.g. hydrothermal conditions as used in relation to the present invention. In order to minimize such potential activity loss a surface area stabilizer is incorporated intothe heterogeneous catalyst. Red Mud is a waste product of bauxite processing via the Bayer process. It comprises oxides and hydroxides of mainly aluminium, iron, titanium, silicon, and sodium.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
