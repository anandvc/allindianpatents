5-(1-piperazinyl)benzofuran-2-carboxamide is an impor-<br>
tant intermediate for pharmaceutical active ingredi-<br>
ents. This is described, for example, in DE 19730989,<br>
WO 9857953, EP 738722, EP 736525, DE 4414113,<br>
DE 4333254 or DE 4101686.<br>
Benzofuran derivatives as precursors are also des-<br>
cribed, for example, in DE 19514567.<br>
Processes are known for the preparation of heterocyclic<br>
aromatic amines or arylamines, for example from<br>
EP 0 802 173, in which a transition-metal catalyst is<br>
used.<br><br>
General amination reactions are described in a review<br>
article by J.F. Martinez in Angew, Ch. Int. 37, 2046-<br>
2062. Other processes for the preparation of tertiary<br>
arylamines using a catalyst composed of a trialkyl-<br>
phosphine and palladium are disclosed in JP 10-310561<br>
(Kokai application), Appl. No. 9-119477 or JP 11-80346<br>
(Kokai application), Appl. No. 9-245218.<br>
A process for the preparation of arylamines with<br>
transition-metal catalysis has been described by<br>
S.L. Buchwald et al. in US 5,576,460. Another process<br>
for the preparation of aromatic amines from chlorinated<br>
aromatic compounds in the presence of a palladium<br>
catalyst is described in EP 0 846 676, by J.F. Hartwig<br>
et al. in J. Org. Chem. 1999, pp. 5575-5580, or S.L.<br>
Buchwald et al. in J.A.C.S. 1999, 121, 9550-9561.<br>
In Tetrahedron Letters 39 (1998) 617-620, M. Nishiyama<br>
describes the synthesis of N-arylpiperazines from aryl<br>
halides and piperazine with transition-metal catalysis.<br>
Surprisingly, studies in the course of the synthesis of<br>
medicaments which are described, for example, in<br>
DE 43 33 254 (EP 0 648 767) have shown that 5-(l-<br>
piperazinyl)benzofuran-2-carboxamide can be obtained in<br>
at least comparable or higher overall yield compared<br>
with the prior art, crucial advantages which may be<br>
mentioned here being the fact that the reaction is<br>
simple to carry out and product isolation is con-<br>
sequently simple.<br>
Another consequence of this is the low solvent and<br>
energy consumption.<br>
If L in the compounds of the formulae I, II or IV is a<br>
reactively esterified OH group, this is preferably<br>
alkylsulfonyloxy having 1-6 carbon atoms (preferably<br>
methylsulfonyloxy or trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy) , aryl-<br>
sulfonyloxy having 6-10 carbon atoms (preferably<br>
phenyl- or p-tolylsulfonyloxy, furthermore also<br><br>
2-napthalenesulfonyloxy) or alternatively fluoro-<br>
sulfonyloxy.<br>
R1 is alkyl or benzyl. Alkyl here has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or<br>
6 carbon atoms, preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms,<br>
particularly preferably, for example, methyl or ethyl,<br>
furthermore propyl, isopropyl, furthermore also butyl,<br>
isobutyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl.<br>
In the compounds of the formula I, L is preferably Cl,<br>
furthermore also Br.<br>
R2 is H or an amino protecting group. R2 is particularly<br>
preferably an amino protecting group.<br>
The term "amino protecting group" is known in general<br>
terms and refers to groups which are suitable for<br>
protecting (blocking) an amino group against chemical<br>
reactions, but which are easy to remove after the<br>
desired chemical reaction has been carried out else-<br>
where in the molecule. Typical such groups are, in<br>
particular, unsubstituted acyl, aryl, aralkoxymethyl or<br>
aralkyl groups. Since the amino protecting groups are<br>
removed after the desired reaction (or reaction<br>
sequence), their type and size are furthermore not<br>
crucial; however, preference is given to those having<br>
1-20, in particular 1-8, carbon atoms. The term "acyl<br>
group" in connection with the present process and the<br>
present compounds should be understood in the broadest<br>
sense. It covers acyl groups derived from aliphatic,<br>
araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxylic acids<br>
or sulfonic acids and, in particular, alkoxycarbonyl,<br>
aryloxycarbonyl and especially aralkoxycarbonyl groups.<br>
Examples of acyl groups of this type are alkanoyl, such<br>
as acetyl, propionyl, butyryl; aralkanoyl, such as<br>
phenylacetyl; aroyl, such as benzoyl or tolyl; aryl-<br>
oxyalkanoyl, such as phenoxyacetyl; alkoxycarbonyl,<br>
such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, 2,2,2-tri-<br>
chloroethoxycarbonyl, BOC (tert-butoxycarbonyl) ,<br>
2-iodoethoxycarbonyl; aralkyloxycarbonyl, such as CBZ<br><br>
(carbobenzoxycarbonyl), also referred to as "Z"),<br>
4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, FMOC (9-fluorenylmethoxy-<br>
carbonyl); arylsulfonyl, such as Mtr (4-methoxy-2,3,6-<br>
trimethylphenylsulfonyl).<br>
R2 is very particularly preferably benzyl or BOC.<br>
An amino protecting group can be removed from a<br>
compound of the formula III - depending on the protect-<br>
ing group used - using, for example, strong acids,<br>
advantageously using TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) or<br>
perchloric acid, but also using other strong inorganic<br>
acids, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid,<br>
strong organic carboxylic acids, such as trichloro-<br>
acetic acid, or sulfonic acids, such as benzene- or<br>
p-toluenesulfonic acid. The presence of an additional<br>
inert solvent is possible, but is not always necessary.<br>
Suitable inert solvents are preferably organic<br>
solvents, for example carboxylic acids, such as acetic<br>
acid, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane,<br>
amides, such as dimethylformamide, halogenated hydro-<br>
carbons, such as dichloromethane, furthermore also<br>
alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, and<br>
water. Also suitable are mixtures of the above-<br>
mentioned solvents. TFA is preferably used in excess<br>
without addition of a further solvent, and perchloric<br>
acid is preferably used in the form of a mixture of<br>
acetic acid and 70% perchloric acid in the ratio 9:1.<br>
The reaction temperatures are advantageously between<br>
about 0 and about 50°, preferably between 15 and 30°.<br>
The BOC group is preferably cleaved off using TFA in<br>
dichloromethane or using approximately 3 to 5N hydro-<br>
chloric acid in dioxane at 15-30°.<br>
Protecting groups which can be removed hydrogeno-<br>
lytically (for example CBZ cr benzyl) can be cleaved<br>
off, for example, by treatment with hydrogen in the<br>
presence of a catalyst (fcr example a noble-metal<br>
catalyst, such as palladium, advantageously on a<br>
support, such as carbon). Suitable solvents here are<br>
those mentioned above, in particular, for example,<br><br>
alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, or amides, such<br>
as DMF. The hydrogenolysis is generally carried out at<br>
temperatures between about 0 and 100° and pressures<br>
between about 1 and 200 bar, preferably at 20-30° and<br>
1-10 bar.<br>
R3 is preferably H.<br>
R3 and R4 are preferably methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or<br>
phenoxy.<br>
R4 and R5 are in particular together carbonyl.<br>
In the compounds of the formula IV, Hal is preferably<br>
Br.<br>
The compounds of the formula IV and V can also be in<br>
dimeric form which can be cleaved back to the<br>
corresponding salicylaldehydes, in which L and R2 have<br>
the meanings indicated:<br><br>
R7 is alkyl. Alkyl here has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms, particular<br>
preference being given, for example, to methyl or<br>
ethyl, furthermore propyl, iscpropyl, furthermore also<br>
butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or tert-buryl.<br>
In the compounds of the formulae IV and V,<br>
=N-C(R7)2 is preferably =N-C(CH3)2,<br>
=N-C(R8)2 is preferably =N-C (phenyl) 2,<br>
=N-OR7 is preferably =N-OCH3,<br>
=N-N[(R7)2] is preferably =M-N [ (CH3) 2] ,<br>
=N-N[(R8)2] is preferably =N-N[ (phenyl)2 ].<br><br>
The compounds of the formulae I and IV are either knowr<br>
or are otherwise prepared by methods known per se, as<br>
described in the literature (for example in the<br>
standard works, such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der<br>
organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry] ,<br>
Georg-Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart), to be precise under<br>
reaction conditions which are known and suitable for<br>
said reactions. Use can also be made here of variants<br>
which are known per se, but are not mentioned here in<br>
greater detail.<br>
Process variant a)<br>
The reaction of 5-bromosalicylaldehyde with a compound<br>
of the formula I and subsequently with formamide is<br>
carried out as a one-pot reaction in a suitable inert<br>
solvent with addition of a base.<br>
Examples of suitable inert solvents are hydrocarbons,<br>
such as hexane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene or<br>
xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as trichloro-<br>
ethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrachloromethane,<br>
chloroform or dichloromethane, ethers, such as diethyl<br>
ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or<br>
dioxane; glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol mono-<br>
methyl or monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl<br>
ether (diglyme); ketones, such as acetone or butanone;<br>
nitriles, such as acetonitrile; sulfoxides, such as<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); carbon disulfide; nitro<br>
compounds, such as nitromethane or nitrobenzene;<br>
optionally also mixtures of said solvents with one<br>
another.<br>
The reaction time, depending on the conditions used, is<br>
between a few minutes and 14 days, and the reaction<br>
temperature is between about 0° and 150°, preferably<br>
between 60° and 120°.<br><br>
The reaction time is very particularly preferably<br>
between 4 and 20 hours and the temperature between 90<br>
and 115°.<br>
Suitable bases are compounds such as, for example, Na,<br>
K or Cs carbonate.<br>
A one-pot reaction is subsequently carried out with<br>
formamide, preferably in the presence of an organic<br>
base, preferably an alkali metal alkoxide, such as, for<br>
example, Na tert-butoxide, and its corresponding<br>
alcohol, to give 5-Hal-benzofuran-2-carboxamide (II) .<br>
In (II), Hal is preferably Br.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out at from 0 to<br>
60°.<br>
Other processes to give (II) are described, for<br>
example, in Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 1971; 4329, and by 0.<br>
Darin et al. in Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1975; 160-194.<br>
The one-pot reaction described above proceeds in better<br>
yield than said reactions.<br>
The reaction of (II) with R2-piperazine to give the<br>
compound of the formula III is carried out in a suit-<br>
able inert solvent, a base and in the presence of a<br>
transition-metal catalyst.<br>
Transition metals which can be employed include PdCl2<br>
or Pd(OAc)2 or other Pd2+ derivatives, which are pre-<br>
reduced, for example using NaBH4 or phosphines (the<br>
step can be omitted in the case of an excess of ligand<br>
R3P) or Pd(0) species, such as, for example, Pd(DBA)2 or<br>
Pd2(DBA)3 (DBA = dibenzylideneacetone).<br>
To this range of Pd complexes can be added corres-<br>
ponding ligand complexes of nickel or copper.<br>
Furthermore, ligands which can be employed are N,N-<br>
diarylimidazolium salts analogously to J. Huang et al.,<br>
Org. Lett. 1, 1999, 1307-1309.<br>
The phosphine or aza/phosphine ligands employed include<br>
tris-ortho-tolylphosphine<br><br>
tricyclohexylphosphine<br>
1-(2-diphenylphosphino-l-naphthyl)isoquinoline (QUINAP)<br>
1, 8-bis (dimethylarnino) naphthalene<br>
Phe2P-CH2-PPhe2<br>
in particular also P(tert-butyl)3 = P(t-Bu)3<br>
1, 1'-bis(diphenylphosphano)ferrocene (DPPF as complex<br>
DPPFxPdCl2)<br>
2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl (= BINAP)<br>
(S)-dibutphos = 1-(2-di-tert-butylphosphanylphenyl)-<br>
ethyldimethylamine<br>
1-(N, N-dimethylamino)-1'-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-<br>
biphenyl<br>
1-(di-t-butylphosphino)biphenyl<br>
1,1'-bis(di-t-butylphosphino)oiphenyl<br>
(t-Bu)2P-(CH2)n-P(t-Bu)2 n = 1,2,3<br>
(t-Bu)2P-(CH2)m-X-(CH2)n-P(t-Bu)2 m,n = 1, 2, 3; X = 0,<br>
or alternatively<br>
DBCPF = 1,1'-bis(di-tert-butylphosphino)ferrocene.<br>
Examples of suitable solvents are hydrocarbons, such as<br>
benzene, toluene, xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons,<br>
such as, for example, dichlorornethane; ketones, such as<br>
acetone, butanone; ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran<br>
(THF) or dioxane; nitriles, such as acetonitrile,<br>
optionally also mixtures of these solvents with one<br>
another.<br>
The reaction time, depending on the conditions used, is<br>
between a few minutes and 14 days, and the reaction<br>
temperature is between 0° and 180°, normally between<br>
30° and 130°.<br>
Examples of suitable bases are alkali metal alkoxides,<br>
such as, for example, Na tert-butoxide.<br><br>
Process variant b)<br>
The reaction of compounds of the formula IV with R2-<br>
piperazine is carried out under conditions as described<br>
under variant a) .<br>
R4 and R5 are optionally converted into a carbonyl<br>
group. The subsequent one-pot reaction of the compound<br>
of the formula V with the compound of the formula I and<br>
subsequently with formamide is likewise carried out<br>
under conditions as described above. The elimination of<br>
R2, if R2 ‡ H, is also carried out under the conditions<br>
described.<br>
A base of the formula I or of the formula V can be<br>
converted into the associated acid-addition salt by<br>
means of an acid, for example by reaction of equivalent<br>
amounts of the base and the acid in an inert solvent,<br>
such as ethanol, followed by evaporation. Particularly<br>
suitable acids for this reaction are those which give<br>
physiologically acceptable salts. Thus, it is possible<br>
to use inorganic acids, for example sulfuric acid,<br>
nitric acid, hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric<br>
acid or hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acids, such as<br>
orthophosphoric acid, sulfamic acid, furthermore<br>
organic acids, in particular aliphatic, alicyclic,<br>
araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic monobasic or<br>
