				<td>Introduction to the Field of the Invention:<br>
In one aspect, this invention relates to a method for improving the thermal resistance of objects<br>
and/or working surfaces exposed to high temperatures in iron steel manufacturing.<br>
In another aspect, this invention relates to objects and/or working surfaces exposed to high<br>
temperatures in steel manufacturing having improved thermal resistance.<br>
Prior Art and Drawbacks:<br>
In the manufacture of steel, the production of iron from the ores is the first major step. This is<br>
universally carried out in a majority of installations with the help of a blast furnace where iron ore,<br>
reducing agent like coke and fluxing agent like limestone are used. It is well known that a blast<br>
furnace is a counter current heterogeneous reactive heat transfer system involving dynamic<br>
interaction between gaseous, liquid and solid phases. Pre-heated air. one of the inputs for iron<br>
making, is introduced through cast high purity copper tuyeres. The tuyeres are important<br>
components of blast furnaces. The tuyeres, 18-20 in number, are double-walled, high purity<br>
(around 99.5%) cast copper structures, through which pre-heated air (1100°C) is introduced into<br>
the blast furnace. These tuyeres are located at the intersection of bosh and the hearth of the<br>
furnace along the entire periphery. As the tuyeres are exposed to the hottest region in the blast<br>
furnace, where the raceway adiabatic flame temperature, RAFT, may frequently exceed 2000° C,<br>
the tuyeres are cooled internally by circulating water. The tuyere failure may take place due to<br>
accidental contact with burning coke particles/lumps, slag or hot metal drops leading to highly<br>
localized thermal load on relatively small area causing burn out. The sudden tuyere failure<br>
adversely affects the stable operation of blast furnace and consequently, its productivity.<br>
It is known to apply thermal barrier coatings to the tuyere to withstand this failure.<br>
Thus for example, US Patent 5989488 suggests a blast tuyere of a blast furnace, comprising:<br>
A tuyere trunk having a tuyere body and a tuyere nose said tuyere body and tuyere nose each<br>
having a cooling chamber, at least the upper half of the outer surface of a portion of said tuyere<br>
trunk projecting into said blast furnace being coated with a shell layer made of a material having a<br>
higher melting point then the melting point of Cu and higher than the temperature of a hot metal in<br>
said blast furnace, and a metal jacket fitted onto the outside of said shell layer.<br>
Japanese Patent 11217611 suggest almost the same modified tuyere.<br>
Japanese Patent 09302405 suggest a procedure to improve the service iives of furnaces and to<br>
reduce the cost of lining refractories, at the time of melting a stainless steel in blast furnaces, by<br>
alternately executing smelting reduction blowing and de-carburization blowing in the same blast<br>
furnace.<br>
In Japanese Patent No. 09268305, it is proposed to make it possible to smoothly execute the<br>
work to withdraw a blast furnace tuyere sonde of a water cooled structure by forming a dry film of<br>
molybdenum disuifide on the outside surface of the main body of this blast furnace tuyere sonde.<br>
These prior art and other practices in industry fail short of increasing the life cycle of tuyeres to<br>
make the system and practice economical.<br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose an improved method for increasing the iife of<br>
tuyeres by applying highly thermal resistant ceramic coatings on to the desired surface.<br>
It is another object of this invention to propose such a method by which the performance<br>
characteristics of the tuyeres can be improved.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose such a method, which will need only indigenously<br>
avaiiabie material for coating the desired areas of the tuyeres.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to propose such a method whose technique is simple and<br>
does not require high skilled labour or expert supervision.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose an improved tuyere having higher thermal<br>
resistance than hitherto possible and having extended life and improved performance<br>
characteristics.<br>
A still more object of this invention is to propose such an improved tuyere which can be fully<br>
indigenously made.<br>
The overall blast furnace operation becomes very economical and efficient.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be more clear from the following paragraphs.<br>

Brief Description of the Drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross-section of the portion of the tuyere, which in normal operations, hangs<br>
inside the blast furnace<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings:<br>
It will be seen from the drawings that the tuyere (1), is double walled (1a, 1b) with an annular<br>
chamber (1C) at its nose end for circulating cooling water.<br>
Under use conditions, the nose portion (2) remains inside the blast furnace at the intersection of<br>
the bosh and the hearth of the furnace.<br>
Since, the tuyeres are mounted in the usual manner around this region circumferentially, these<br>
mounting details are neither shown in the drawings nor do these form any novel feature of the<br>
invention. Usually 18-20 such tuyeres are mounted as per practice in industry.<br>
In the nose portion, marked by numeral (2), there is provided a high thermal resistant coating as<br>
per the features of this invention.<br>
As against the prior art coatings, known to us and discussed earlier, we have departed from the<br>
same and have successfully provided a combination ceramic coating of materials of high thermal<br>
resistance.<br>
Our investigations have shown that yttria stabilized zirconia coating would be well suited for our<br>
purposes.<br>
In order to promote the adhesion of the top coat to extend the life of the coating, we have found<br>
that an initial bond coating would be ideal.<br>
We have been able to successfully provide a long lasting combination ceramic coating on the<br>
exposed portion of the tuyere by employing an intermediate metal alloy bond coating on the bare<br>
outer surface of the copper tuyeres.<br>
The metal alloy has been carefully selected after several trials. Simulated experiments have been<br>
conducted to arrive at an idea! combination of the metal alloy bond coat and the combination<br>
ceramic top coat.<br>
The top coat is shown by the numeral 3 which covers the nose portion as well as the conical<br>
portion of the tuyere.<br>
Additional Details of the Invention:<br>
Thermal barrier coatings applied to the exposed/working surfaces of the tuyere lead to<br>
considerable reduction in the incidence of tuyere failure on account of burn-out. The ceramic<br>
coatings provide a thermal barrier to the heat flux between the hot 7one of the furnace and the<br>
tuyere members. The coatings are applied to the flat nose surface of tuyeres, which is exposed to<br>
the high temperature in the furnace and conico-cylindrical surface of the tuyere, which hangs<br>
inside the furnace; this is roughly 5-7 inches from the nose (Figure 1). The main properties, which<br>
are taken into account for selection of thermal barrier coatings are high melting point of the<br>
ceramic material, its low thermal conductivity, its phase stability at the tuyere body temperature,<br>
its bonding characteristics with the copper substrate and commercial availability of the bond<br>
powders/materials.<br>
The invention will now be more clearly described with reference to the example.<br>
Fresh copper tuyeres were coated by argon plasma spray deposition technique after careful<br>
surface preparation. Ni-Cr-Ai-Y alloy bond coat was followed by the ceramic 8% ytiria (Y2O3)<br>
stabilized zirconia (ZrO2) top coat. The coated tuyeres were then installed in predetermined and<br>
vulnerable positions in a blast furnace to avaluate their performance under plant working<br>
conditions.<br>
In order to promote adhesion of ceramic 8% yttria (Y2O3) stabilized zirconia (ZrO2) with the tuyere<br>
substrate, a bond coat of Ni-Cr-AI-Y alloy (15-19% Cr, 3-5% Al, 3-5% Y, balance Ni) was initially<br>
applied on copper tuyere surface. The coating materials tor Ni-Cr-AI-Y bond coat and 8% yttria<br>
(Y2O3) stabilized ZrO2 top coat are essentially powders with granulometric particle sizes of<br>
-100+325 mesh and -230 mesh respectively. The surface to be coated (Figure 1) was machined<br>
down by 1-2 mm on diameter followed by grit blasting for better mechanical anchorage of the<br>
coatings. The surface was then degreased with acetone and preheated to 120-150° C with an<br>
argon plasma torch. Initially, the bond coat of Ni-Cr-AI-Y alloy was deposited on the tuyere<br>
surface. Following argon plasma spray parameters were employed.<br>
Current - 700-800 Amperes<br>
Voltage - 40-60 volts DC.<br>
Stand-off distance of plasma spray gun from job surface - 4 to 6 inches.<br>
Around 0.4 mm thickness of bond coat was built up in four runs. The job surface was then<br>
allowed to coo! to around 50-100° C. Following this, the top coat was deposited. The overall<br>
thickness of the coating (bond coat and top coat included) was around 1.0 to 2.0 mm. The coating<br>
powders employed were commercially available plasma grade powders. The tuyeres were<br>
mounted onto a horizontal turn table and rotated at 3-4 r.p.m. during the coating process.<br>
Following the application of the coating, the surface was allowed to cool to the ambient<br>
temperature and the surface was inspected for cracks and other defects.<br>
The plasma coating results in dense, adherent and mechanically stable zirconia coating, which<br>
acts as a thermal barrier to the heat flux, thus ieading to significant improvement in the service life<br>
of the tuyeres. The coated tuyeres exhibited a service life of more than 500 days as compared<br>
with the average service life of 72 days for an un-coated tuyere. This translates into an<br>
augmentation in service life by nearly 7 times.<br>
Advantages of the Invention:<br>
The advantages are many.<br>
1. This is a technical advancement in the field having International application and importance.<br>
2. The longevity of tuyere being increased, there are less interruptions in blast furnace operation<br>
and hence more production time is utilized.<br>
3. Since replacement or repair of tuyere is reduced considerably, the process of producing pig<br>
iron in a blast furnace is economical.<br>
4. Inventories and stores are reduced.<br>
5. Capital investment is controlled.<br>
