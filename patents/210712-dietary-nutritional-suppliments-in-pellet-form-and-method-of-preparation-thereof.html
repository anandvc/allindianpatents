The  following  specification particularly  describes  the  nature  of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
                                   1<br><br>
The present invention relates to dietary nutritional supplements in pellet form and method of preparation thereof.<br>
In one aspect the invention includes the composition of dietary nutritional supplements in pellet or granule form. The pellet composition is prepared using protein, amino acid, vitamin, fat, carbohydrate and mineral in adequate amount.<br>
In another aspect the invention includes the method of preparation of pellet (granule) containing dietary nutritional supplements. The pellet dose is recommended to give any individual. Intake of pellet adds nutritional value to the physiological processes of one"s body. Prior Art:<br>
Nutritional supplements are widely used to fulfill nutritional requirements of human. These nutritional supplements contain vitamins, minerals and other substances that play important role in physiological requirements and deficiency of these supplements leads to malnutrition.<br>
Proteins play important role in formation of cytoskeletons, immunoglobulins, and hormone. Under certain conditions protein catabolized to supply energy. Protein intake also facilitates maintenance of electrolyte and water balance in body.<br>
2<br><br>
Carbohydrates are chief source of energy. Degradation product of carbohydrates utilized for synthesis of other substances such as fatty acid, cholesterol, and amino acid. It yields 4.0 C/gm energy.<br>
Fats (Lipids) are important dietary constituent. It yields 9.5 C/gm energy. Some of fats are important constituents of cell wall and cell organelles like mitochondrion etc.<br>
Vitamin A plays important role in vision, reproduction, epithelialization, bone and teeth formation. It also has antioxidant properties.<br>
Vitamin D3 deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. It helps in mineralization and calcification of bones.<br>
Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is considered as antiberiberi factor. It is also required as a cofactor for some enzyme. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is important for healthy hair and mucous membrane. Requirements of vitamin B2 increases during pregnancy, lactation, and injury/burns. It also helps in production of red blood cells and antibodies. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) plays important role in formation of shingomyelin, intra mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis, DNA and RNA synthesis.<br>
3<br><br>
Vitamin C helps in collegen synthesis, absorption of iron, electron<br>
transport system, activation of enzyme (e.g. arginase and papain), inhibition of enzyme (e.g. urease and B-amylase), formation of carnitine. Vitamin C in both leucocytes and platelets is found to be lowered significantly in women taking oral contraceptive pills. Vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy.<br>
Vitamin E has antioxidant property. Vitamin E deficiency causes muscular dystrophy, hemolytic anemia, nocturnal muscle cramps, intermittent claudication, fibrocystic breast disease and atherosclerosis.<br>
Vitamin K is important in blood coagulation, oxidative phosphorylation and increases capacity of calcium binding protein to deposit calcium in the tissues concerned.<br>
Folic acid plays important role in synthesis of DNA and RNA, red blood cells, white blood cells. Folic acid deficiency leads to anemic condition.<br>
Panthothenic acid is esstintial for (3- oxidation, biosynthesis of fatty acids and synthesis of adrenal gland hormone.<br>
4<br><br>
Vitamin D3 niacin acts as a pellagra-preventing factor. It is necessary for production of sex hormones, helps to lower cholesterol and maintain blood circulation.<br>
Calcium is an important mineral mainly found in bone and teeth. It helps in process of bone formation, teeth formation, blood coagulation, neuromuscular transmission, a excitability of nerves, muscle contraction, permeability of gap junction and secondary or tertiary messenger in hormone action.<br>
Phosphorous plays important role in energy transfer, acid-base balance, and enzymatic action. It is one of the constituent of phospholipids, nucleotides/nucleic acids, lipoproteins, phosphoproteins. Iron is an important constituent of haemoglobin, and myoglobin. It is required for action of different enzymes (e.g. xanthine oxidase, cytochrome C reductase). Deficiency of iron leads to anemic condition.<br>
Magnesium is extremely essential for life and is present as intracellular ion in all living cells and tissues. Magnesium is involved as a cofactor and as an activator to wide spectrum of enzymatic action. It is one of the constituents of bone and teeth. It also exerts an effect on neuromuscular irritability.<br>
5<br><br>
Manganese acts either as a cofactor or as an activator of many enzymes. It plays important role in animal reproduction, bone formation, carbohydrate metabolism, porphyrin synthesis, fat metabolism and proteoglycan synthesis.<br>
Copper requires in enzymatic action (e.g. cytochrome oxidase, tyrosinase), maturation of elastin, formation of bones and maintenance of myelin sheath of nerve fibers. Copper helps in the utilization of iron for haemoglobin synthesis. In invertebrates haemocyanin is found which functions as haemoglobin in the storage and transport of oxygen.<br>
Zinc is needed for release of vitamin A from liver into the blood and thus increases its plasma level and its utilization in rhodopsin synthesis. It also helps in insulin secretion, growth and reproduction, wound healing and biosynthesis of mononucleotides.<br>
Chromium is a true potentiator of insulin. In protein energy malnutrition (PEM) states, chromium supplementation is beneficial for weight gain. When chromium is supplied in deficient diets it decreases serum cholesterol levels and prevents or decreases athermanous plaque formation in aorta.<br>
6<br><br>
A positive role of selenium in human health has been suggested. It is needed for action of glutathione peroxidase, which enzyme functions in the cytosol as part of a multi-component antioxidant defense system within the cell. Selenium helps in retention of vitamin E in the blood plasma lipoproteins.<br>
In prior art various oral and/or parental dosage forms containing nutritional supplements were supplemented to individuals, to suppress the nutritional deficiency occur in many individuals because of lack of such nutritional supplements.<br>
Patent WO2004034986 describes novel agglomerated granular protein-rich nutritional supplements able to be absorbed directly onto the tongue or rapidly dissolved in aqueous liquids, as well as methods for supplementing the nutritional needs of individuals of various ages, genders, and levels of activity.<br>
Patent WO 01/01789 describes a gelled nutritional composition and a method of providing nutrition to patient suffering from dysphagia. Gelled nutritional composition comprising whey protein, carbohydrate source, minerals and vitamins. The composition is suitable for dysphagia patients, children and athletes.<br>
7<br><br>
Patent WO 2004/060342 describes nutritional supplement composition containing a mixture of whey protein, amino acids, and other beneficial constituents, and a method for making the composition in nutritionally compact, easy-to-use form i.e. in gel form.<br>
Patent WO 01/50889 discloses nutritional drink, which can with good tolerance be taken by persons suffering from feeling of nausea, or which are expected to be sick when consuming food or drink. Energy value of drink is preferably 40-60 Kcal/100 ml drink, osmolality 350-400 mOsmol/kg water. Nutritional drink contains proteins 0.5-5 gm/100 ml drink, carbohydrate 6-20 gm/100 ml drink, salts and acidifying agents to maintain pH 3 and 6, aroma, flavouring agents and vitamins.<br>
US patent 6,716,466 describes a balanced food powder and a method of enhancing the energetic and protein content of a food without affecting the taste of the food, which comprise providing a powder composition of neutral flavour comprising at least one fat or oil source, at least one protein source &amp; maltodextrin. Wherein energetic amount of protein is about 20%-30%, fat or oil is about 40%-50%, maltodextrin is about 25%-35% of the composition and adding the powder composition to food wherein the powder composition does not change the flavour of food.<br>
8<br><br>
Nutritional supplements are also available in powder or uneven granular form in commercial market. The powder contains protein, vitamins, minerals etc. It has different bulk density (specific gravity). Nutritional value of the protein, vitamin, carbohydrate, minerals present in powder form do not remain intact and these ingredients get segregated due to different bulk density during the time of packing, handling of powder in manufacturing unit and during transportation of the powder from one place to another. Consequently those contents present in packing having higher specific gravity get settle down, leads to unequal application of therapeutic dose. Thus the patient taking the spoonful dose of the powder does not contain uniform quantity of all the ingredients. Moreover, the fine powder contains the sucrose, is highly hygroscopic and easily absorbs the moisture from environment; due to this reason the final product have lower stability and decomposition of the product takes place. Intake of spoonful powder dose stick to teeth &amp; mouth cavity. Fine powder produces lumps on dispersing it in milk or water.<br>
To come over and control these problems the present invention is made to provide dietary nutritional supplements in pellet form and method of preparation thereof.<br>
9<br><br>
The field of invention:<br>
It is an objective of the present invention is to provide granules or pellets of dietary nutritional supplements, which is given to any individual, any time, any place. The pellet contains protein, amino acid, carbohydrate, vitamins, fat and minerals as nutritional supplements.<br>
It is another objective of the invention is the method used to prepare dietary nutritional supplements in pellet form in uniform size and weight. Size and weight uniformity of the pellet containing dietary nutritional supplements aids nonsegregation of pellet during packing, handling and transportation. Consequently the content uniformity of the pellet dosage form is maintained.<br>
In the present invention all nutritional supplements are taken in powder form and then pellets or granules are prepared. In the said invention method of preparing pellets, sugar pellets are coated with other ingredients to prepare more stable pellet (granule).<br>
In the preparation of pellets nutritional supplements are tasteful and flavoured, is taken with/without milk or water. It is easily dispersed in milk or  water,  without  forming  lump  in  dispersion.   Moreover,  the  pellet<br>
10<br><br>
formulation does not stick to teeth and mouth cavity so it is more favorable for any individual.<br>
