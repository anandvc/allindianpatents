ORGANOLEPTICALLY ACCEPTABLE IBUPROFEN ORAL DOSAGE FORMULATIONS,<br>
METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE SAME<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 119 (e), this application claims priority to the filing dates of: United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/733,127 filed November 2, 2005 and United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No, 60/8iQ,417 filed on June 1, 2006; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
INTRODUCTION Background of the Invention<br>
Sore throat, laryngitis, mouth and throat ulcers, excessive mucus and other mouth and throat irritations typically accompany common colds, influenza and like ailments. A variety of different medications, including medications available over-the-counter, have been developed to treat these types of maladies. Such medications include: Dyclonine lozenges (e.g., as sold under the trademark SUCRETS™); benzocaine + menthol lozenges (e.g., as sold under the trademark CEPACOL™); menthol lozenges (e.g., as sold under the trademark VICKS™); and aspirin containing chewing gum (e.g., as sold under the trademark ASPERGUM™).<br>
Ibuprofen (2-(p-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) which is known to possess analgesic and antipyretic activities. It is useful in the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with various maladies, including the common cold, toothaches, headaches, backaches, menstrual cramps (Dysmennorhea), the muscular aches and pains associated with Premenstrual Syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, as well as in the reduction of fever.<br>
As such, like other NSAlDs, ibuprofen has become widely used in prescription and over-the-counter formulations for the treatment of pain associated with inflammation, both minor and chronic. One of its drawbacks, however, is that Ibuprofen has an unpleasant, bitter taste which tends to limit its acceptability in many oral dosage forms. Methods of alleviating this limitation have included attempts at masking the bitter taste with flavored and/or sweetened mediums or by<br><br>
coating the ibuprofen with substances which prevent it from contacting the taste buds during oral administration. For example, oral ibuprofen formulations currently available over the counter include suspensions of ibuprofen in oral sugar syrup containing formulations.<br>
JP-4-26618 describes ibuprofen containing lozenges and their use in the treatment of sore throat. To overcome the bitterness of the ibuprofen active agent and thereby make the lozenge organoleptically acceptable, the disclosed lozenge formulations include a significant amount of cyclodextrin (e.g., at least twice as much cyclodextrin as ibuprofen) as a masking agent.<br>
Because of the relatively expensive cost of cyclodextrin, there is continued interest in the development of new organoleptically acceptable oral ibuprofen formulations, e.g., formulations in which cyclodextrin is present in smaller amounts than that taught in JP-4-26618, if at all. Relevant Literature<br>

Any recited method can be carried out in the order of events recited or in any other order which is logically possible.<br>
As reviewed above, the present invention provides organolepticaliy acceptable ibuprofen oral solid dosage formulations, as well as methods for making and using the same. In further describing representative embodiments of the invention in greater detail, the organolepticaliy acceptable formulations are reviewed first in greater detail, followed by a review of representative protocols for making the formulations and a review of representative applications in which the formulations find use.<br>
ORGANOLEPTICALLY ACCEPTABLE IBUPROFEN ORAL SOLID DOSAGE FORMULATIONS<br>
As summarized above, the subject invention provides organolepticaliy acceptable ibuprofen oral solid dosage formulations. As the formulations are organoleptically acceptable, they can contact the taste receptors of a recipient's mouth and be considered generally acceptable to the senses of the recipient, particularly to the sense of taste. More particularly, the organoleptically acceptable formulations of this invention are those solid oral formulations in which the unpleasant and bitter taste of ibuprofen is sufficiently masked. Specifically, when using the evaluation protocol reported in the Experimental Section below, the unpleasant and bitter taste of ibuprofen is considered to be sufficiently masked if the composition scores 2 1 or iess, e.g., 0 or less, such as A or less, including -2.<br><br>
In a general sense, the subject formulations are not limited to ibuprofen formulations, but instead may be viewed as propionic acid derivative formulations. Propionic acid derivatives are a well known class of analgesic compounds. As used herein propionic acid derivatives are understood to include, but are not limited to, ibuprofen, naproxen, benoxaprofen, naproxen sodium, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, fenbuprofen, ketoprofen, indoprofen, pirprofen, carpofen, oxaprofen, pranoprofen, microprofen, tioxaprofen, suproprofen, alminoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen and bucloxic acid. The structural formula is set forth in U.S. Pat No. 4,923,898, hereby incorporated by reference. Propionic acid derivatives as defined herein are defined as pharmaceutically acceptable analgesics/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs having a free -CH(CH3)COOH or -CH2 CH2 COOH or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt group, such as -CH(CH3)COO~Na+ or CH2 CH2 COO-Na+, which are typically attached directly or via a carbonyl functionality to an aromatic ring system.<br>
For convenience and ease of description, the present invention is described herein, primarily in terms of ibuprofen formulation embodiments. As such, the subject formulations of these representative ibuprofen formulation embodiments include an effective amount of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is a widely used, well known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory propionic acid derivative. Ibuprofen is chemically known as 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-propionic acid. As used herein, ibuprofen is understood to include 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Suitable ibuprofen salts include arginine, lysine, histidine, as well as other salts described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,279,926, 4,873,231, 5,424,075 and 5,510,385, the contents of which are incorporated by reference. It should be noted that the ibuprofen active agent may be present as a racemic mixture or as a stereoisomer, e.g., as the S(+) or R(-) ibuprofen sterioisomers.<br>
The amount of ibuprofren present in the subject formulations may vary, so long as it is effective to acheive the intended purpose of the formulation, e.g., to provide sore throat pain relief to a subject in need thereof, as further reviewed below. In representative embodiments, the amount of ibuprofen present in the formulation ranges from about 5 to about 600 mg, such as from about 20 to about 400 mg, including from about 50 to about 200 mg.<br><br>
In addition to the ibuprofen active agent, the subject formulations also include a masking component By masking component is meant a component that is made up of one or more agents which provides for sufficient masking of the ibuprofen bitterness to make the formulation organoleptically acceptable. In representative embodiments, the masking component is made of one or or more of a cooling agent, an organic acid and a cycodextrin. In certain embodiments, the masking component includes two or more of a cooling agent, an organic acid and a cyclodextrin, including all three of a cooling agent, an organic acid and a cyclodextrin.<br>
As such, certain embodiments of the subject invention include one or more cooling agents. By "cooling agent" is meant an agent that, when contacted with skin of a subject, imparts a cooling sensation or effect to the subject. Cooling agents can be selected from any of a wide variety of materials. Included among such materials are carboxamides, menthol, ketals, diols, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the cooling agent is an acyclic amide, where representative acyclic amides include compounds of the formula:<br><br>
where<br>
Ri, R2 and F¾ are each C•i -C5 alkyl and together provide a total of at least 5, such as from about 5-10 carbon atoms; and R' is Ci -C5 alkyl, C•i -C8 hydroxyalkyl or alkylcarboxyalkyl of up to 8 carbon atoms. In this group R1 is in representative embodiments, methyl, ethyl or n-propyl and one or both of R2 and R3 is branched in an alpha or beta position relative to the carbon atom marked (*). In representative embodiments, the cooling agent is N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl butamide (also known as WS-23; CAS # 51115-67-4). The above compounds can be produced using any convenient protocol, where representative protocols are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,296,255. Other representative cooling agents of interest include, but are not limited to: linalool, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, cyclohexanecarboxamide, N-ethyl-5-<br><br>
metyhy-2-(1-methylethyl) (also known as WS-3; CAS # (39711-79-0), Flescolat MGA (Haarman &amp; Reimer), Frescolat ML (Haarmann &amp; Reimer), PMD38 (Takasago), CoolactP (Takasago) and Cooling Agent 10 (Takasago). Additional preferred cooling agents are selected from the group consisting of menthol, 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2~diol known as TK-10 manufactured by Takasago; menthols and menthyls, where these as used herein include dextro- and levorotatory isomers of these compounds and racemic mixtures thereof TK-10 is described in U.S. Pat. No, 4,459,425, Amano et al., issued JuL 10, 1984. WS-3 and other agents are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,163, Watson, et al., issued Jan. 23,1979; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, as well as various oils, such as peppermint oil, spearmint oil, and the like.<br>
The amount of cooling agent that is present in the formulation is an amount sufficient (e.g., by itself or in combination with other masking agents of the masking component) to mask or hide the bitterness of ibuprofen and thereby make the formulation organoleptically acceptable. In representative embodiments, based on the ratio to ibuprofen, the amount ratio of cooling agent to ibuprofen present in the formulation ranges from about 0.25 to about 2,such as from about 0.5 to about 1.5,and including from about 0.5 to about 1.<br>
The masking component may also Include one or more organic acids, including amino acids. Organic acids of interest include, but are not limited to: glycolic acid, lactic acid, methyl lactic acid, palycarobxlyic acids, e.gM malic acid, citric acid, tartronic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acidetc. Amino acids of interest include, but are not limited to: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, cysteine, cystine, methionine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, glutamine, arginine, lysine, 5-hydroxylysine, histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, 3-hydroxyproline, 4-hydroxyproIine, proline, homocysteine, homocystine, homoserine, ornithine, citrulline, creatine, asparaginic acid, 3-aminopropanoic acid, theanine, 2-aminobutanoic acid, 4-aminobutanoic acid, 2-amino-2-methylpropanoic acid, 2-methyl-3-aminopropanoic acid, 2,6-diaminopimelic acid, 2-amino-3-phenylbutanoic acid, phenylglycine, canavanine, canaline, 4-hydroxyarginine, 4-hydroxyornithine, homoarginine, 4-hydroxyhomoarginine, ß -lysine, 2,4-diaminobuianoic acid, 2,3-diaminopropanoicacid, 2-methylserine, 3-<br><br>
phenylserine betaine, sulfur-containing amino acids, such as taurine, cysteinesulfinic acid, methionine sulfoxide and methionine sulfone.<br>
The amount of organic acid (including amino.acid) masking agent that is present in the formulation is an amount sufficient (e.g., by itself or in combination with other masking agents of the masking component) to mask or hide the bitterness of ibuprofen and thereby make the formulation organolepticaliy acceptable. In representative embodiments, based on the ratio to ibuprofen, the amount ratio of organic acid to ibuprofen present in the formulation ranges from about 0.5 to about 4,such as from about 1 to about 3,and including from about 1 to about 2.<br>
In representative embodiments, the masking component includes a cyclodextrin. The cyclodextrin may be any convenient cyclodextrin or mixture of cyciodextrins, including a-, ß- or y-cyclodextrins. In representative embodiments, cyclodextrin is ß- cyclodextrin. A feature of embodiments of the invention is that, when present, the total amount of cyclodextrin in a given formulation is less than twice the amount of ibuprofen active agent in the formulation, such as less than about 1.5 times the amount of ibuprofen active agent, including less than about 1 times the amount of ibuprofen active agent, in terms of mass.<br>
As summarized above, the subject formulations are orally acceptable solid formulations. The solid formulations may be present in a number of different formats, where representative formats include, but are not limited to: lozenges, troches, tablets, liquid formulations such as gargles and sprays, and gums. The term "lozenge" as used herein is intended to embrace all dosage forms where the product is formed by cooling a sugar-based or sugar alcohol based (e.g., sorbitol) molten mass containing the active material. The term "tablet" as used herein is intended to embrace unit dosage forms made from compressed powders or granules or compressed pastes. Solid dosage forms may be prepared by methods which are well known in the art for the production of lozenges, tablets, troches, capsules or chewing gums and may contain other ingredients known in such dosage forms such as acidity regulators, opacifiers, stabilizing agents, buffering agents, flavorings, sweeteners, coloring agents, buffering agents, sweeteners and preservatives.<br><br>
For example, solid formulations of the present invention may be prepared as lozenges by heating the lozenge base (e.g., a mixture of sugar and liquid glucose) under a vacuum to remove excess water. The remaining components are then blended into the mixture. The resulting mixture is then drawn into a continuous cylindrical mass from which the individual lozenges are formed. The lozenges are then cooled, subjected to a visual check and packed into suitable packaging. One form of suitable packaging is a blister pack of a water-impermeable plastics material (e.g., p6lyvinyichioride) closed by a metallic e.g., aluminium foil. The patient removes the lozenge by applying pressure to the blister to force the lozenge to rupture and pass through the metal foil seal Lozenges will normally be sucked by the patient to release the ibuprofen. Where desired, ethanol can be used to dissolve ibuprofen, menthol, WS-23, and WS-3.<br>
As for preparation of a troche, a wet granulation method can be used generally to prepare granules for tabletting into a troche formulation. Ethanol can be used to dissolve ibuprofen, menthol, WS-23, and WS-3, if necessary. After granulation, the wet granule is dried ,then mixed with lubricant ,and finally tabletted into a troche,<br>
Masticable solid dosage formulations may be made by the methods used to prepare chewable candy products or chewing gums. For example, a chewable solid dosage form may be prepared from an extruded mixture of sugar syrup to which the ibuprofen has been added with optional addition of whipping agents, humectants, lubricants, flavors and colorings. (See Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Volume 1, Second Edition edited by H A Lieberman, L Lachman and J B Schwartz published in 1989).<br>
As such, a variety of different solid dosage formulations are provided by the subject invention. Furthermore, the solid dosage formulations do not need a special procedure for their preparation, as they may be readily produced using conventional procedures. For example, taste-masking agents, diluents, binders, or other appropriate additives can be added to ibuprofen, to which water or organic solvents are added, if necessary, and then mixed evenly to be compacted or to be granulated, and then mixed with lubricant to be compacted. For a diluent, sugar is mainly used and one or more types of sugar such as white sugar, powder sugar, lactose, fructose, starch syrup, reduced malt sugar, D- mannitol, D-sorbitol, and<br><br>
sucrose. For a binder, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, corn starch, gelatin and arabic gum are used. For a lubricant, magnesium stearate, talc, sucrose fatty acid ester and such are properly selected and used.<br>
In many embodiments, the methods of manufacture may be characterized by including a first step of producing an intermediate composition, which composition includes the active agent and masking component, and then a second step of producing the oral dosage formulation from the intermediate composition.<br>
METHODS OF USING SUBJECT FORMULATIONS<br>
The subject organoieptically acceptable ibuprofen solid oral dosage formulations find use in applications of delivering ibuprofen to a subject in need thereof, particularly to a laryngopharynx (e.g., throat) location of a subject. In practicing the invention, the dosage may be placed in the mouth of the subject, e.g., by the subject itself or a caregiver therefore, whereupon the subject holds the formulation in its mouth to obtain the desired benefit, where the term holding is used broadly to include sucking, chewing, etc, depending on the particular type of formulation.   In this manner, the direct action of ibuprofen dissolved in saliva or oral cavity is exerted on mucosal membrane, e.g., for treatment of sore throat.<br>
In practicing the subject methods, a formulation may be administered a single time or a plurality of times over a given time period, e.g., the course of the disease condition, e.g., inflammation, being treated, where the dosing schedule when a plurality of formulations are administered over a given time period may be hourly, daily etc.<br>
The above described formulations and methods find use in any application in which the administration of ibuprofen to a subject, particularly to a laryngopharynx location thereof, is desired. Among other applications, the subject methods as described herein are effective for treating inflammation, aches, etc., including the maladies reviewed in the introduction section of this application, e.g., sore throat, hoarse voice, etc.<br>
Generally such subjects are "mammals" or "mammalian,h where these terms are used broadly to describe organisms which are within the class mammalia,<br><br>
including the orders carnivore (e.g., dogs and cats), rodentia (e.g., mice, guinea pigs, and rats), and primates (e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and monkeys). In many embodiments, the hosts will be humans.<br>
In representative embodiments, the subject methods find use in the treatment of a sore throat. In yet other embodiments, the subject methods find use in the treatment of hoarse voice, e.g., as may occur from extended periods of voice use, e,g., speaking, singing etc. By treatment is meant at least an amelioration of pain afflicting the host, where amelioration is used in a broad sense to refer to at least a reduction in the magnitude of pain. As such, treatment also includes situations where the pain is completely inhibited, e,g. prevented from happening, or stopped, e.g. terminated, such that the host no longer suffers from the pain. As such, treatment includes both curing and managing a pain, e.g., of a sore throat.<br>
KITS<br>
Also provided are kits, where the subject kits at least include one or more, e.g., a plurality of, organoleptically acceptable oral solid dosage formulations, as described above. The subject formulations in the kits may be present in a package. The formulations of the kits are typically present in individual pouches or analogous containers, to preserve the composition of the formulations until use. The subject kits also generally include instructions for how to use the formulations, where the instructions typically include information about how to administer the formulation, dosing schedules etc. The instructions are generally recorded on a suitable recording medium. For example, the instructions may be printed on a substrate, such as paper or plastic, etc. As such, the instructions may be present in the kits as a package insert, in the labeling of the container of the kit or components thereof (i.e. associated with the packaging or subpackaging) etc. In other embodiments, the instructions are present as an electronic storage data file present on a suitable computer readable storage medium, e.g. CD-ROM, diskette, etc.<br><br>
The following practical and comparative examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
1.	Working example 1<br>
After 1.0 g of ibuprofen and 0.5 g of l-menthol were dissolved in 2 ml of EtOH, the resultant solution was added to 4g of D-sorbitol in a motor, and the resultant composition was kneaded well. After the composition was dried at room temperature overnight, it was pulverized by motor, sieved with 0.5mm opening, and then mixed with 0.1g of Mg-st (magnesium stearate) for 10 seconds. The prepared granules were put into a molder for tabletting (13 mm in diameter, in 1.5-2.0t pressure for 20 secs.),to obtain 20 troches, each of which weighed 200 mg (36.4 mg of ibuprofen, 18.2 mg of l-menthol).<br>
2.	■     Working example 2<br>
1.0 g of ibuprofen and 0.5 g of WS-23 (commercialized cooling compound; N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl butamide; from Millennium Specialty Chemicals) were dissolved in 2 ml of EtOH, and the resultant solution was added to 4 g of D-sorbitol in a motor.
