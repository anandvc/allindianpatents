SPECIFICATION<br>
NON-AQUEOUS ELECTROLYTIC SOLUTION FOR LITHIUM SECONDARY BATTERY AND LITHIUM SECONDARY BATTERY USING THE SAME<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a lithium secondary-battery showing excellent cycle characteristics, and a non-aqueous electrolytic solution advantageously used in preparation of the lithium secondary battery excellent in cycle characteristics.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The lithium secondary battery has recently been widely used for example, as an electric source for drivpppo ing small-sized electronics. The lithium secondary bat-tery has a basic structure comprising a positive elec-trode, a negative electrode and a non-aqueous electro-lytic solution, which are contained in a sealed cell. The positive electrode preferably comprises a complex oxide of lithium such as LiCo02, and the negative elec-trode preferably comprises a carbon material or metallic lithium. A carbonate such as ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PC) has been advantageously used in the non-aqueous electrolytic solution for the lithium secondary battery.<br>
The recent lithium secondary battery requires a fur-ther improvement on battery performance such as cycle characteristics of the battery and electric capacity.<br>
In a lithium secondary battery, a complex oxide of lithium such as LiCo02, LiMn204 and LiNi02 is often used as a positive electrode material. A process of recharg-ing the battery causes a local oxidation and decomposi-<br><br>
tion reaction of a part of a solvent contained in a nonaqueous electrolytic solution. A decomposition product inhibits an ordinary electrochemical reaction of the battery to lower battery performance. The reason is considered that a solvent is electrochemically oxidized along an interface between the positive electrode material and the non-aqueous electrolytic solution.<br>
In a lithium secondary battery, a highly crystallized carbon material such as natural or artificial graphite is often used as a negative electrode material. A process of recharging the battery causes a local reduction and decomposition reaction of a part of a solvent contained in a non-aqueous electrolytic solution. Ethylene carbonate (EC) is widely used as a solvent of the non-aqueous electrolytic solvent. Ethylene carbonate may particularly be reduced and decomposed to lower battery performance while repeating charge and discharge.<br>
Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 8(1996)-45545 and U.S. Patent No. 5,626,981 recommend adding a vinylene carbonate compound to a non-aqueous electrolytic solution to improve battery performance of the lithium secondary battery. It is further reported that the cycle life is lengthened using the electric solution containing the vinylene carbonate compound.<br>
Japanese Patent Provisional Publication Nos. 2000-195545, 2001-313072, 2002-100399 and 2002-124297 and U.S. Patent No. 6,479,191 Bl recommend adding an alkyne compound to a non-aqueous electrolytic solution to improve battery performance of the lithium secondary battery.  It is further reported that the cycle life is lengthened using the electric solution containing the alkyne compound.<br>
Increase in density of a positive electrode composition layer or a negative electrode composition layer has recently been examined to enlarge capacity of the lithium<br><br>
secondary battery. Japanese Patent Provisional Publica-tion No. 2003-142075 describes a lithium secondary bat-tery comprising a positive electrode composition layer having a density of 3.3 to 3.7 g/cm3 provided on aluminum foil, and a negative electrode composition layer having a density of 1.4 to 1.8 g/cm3 provided on copper foil. It is further reported that the obtained lithium secondary battery has high energy density and high safety, and can be preserved at an elevated temperature.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
Problems to be solved by the invention<br>
As is described in the above-mentioned documents, battery performance such as cycle characteristics can be improved by adding a vinylene carbonate compound or an alkyne compound to a non-aqueous electrolytic solution of a lithium secondary battery.<br>
The conventional lithium secondary battery comprises positive electrode and negative electrode composition layers of relatively low density. The battery performance such as the cycle characteristics can be improved by adding a vinylene carbonate compound or an alkyne compound to a non-aqueous electrolytic solution of the conventional lithium secondary battery.<br>
On the other hand, the recent lithium secondary battery comprises positive electrode and negative electrode composition layers of high density. The present inventors have found that cycle characteristics are scarcely improved by adding the above-mentioned additive to the non-aqueous electrolytic solution of the recent lithium secondary battery. The inventors have further found that the electrolytic solution is decomposed in the battery to cause shortage (dry up) of the electrolytic solution.<br><br>
The cycle characteristics mean a feature of keeping a high charge capacity after repeating charge and discharge operations many times.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a non-aqueous electrolytic solution that has solved the above-mentioned problems of the non-aqueous electrolytic solution for the lithium secondary battery.<br>

The non-aqueous electrolytic solution according to the present invention contains both a specific amount of a vinylene carbonate compound and a specific amount of an alkyne compound. The non-aqueous electrolytic solution can be advantageously used in a lithium secondary battery of high capacity comprising a positive electrode and negative electrode composition layers of high density. The lithium secondary battery comprising the non-aqueous electrolytic solution according to the present invention is improved in cycle characteristics without causing phenomenon of dry up. The function and effect have not yet clarified, but are considered to be obtained by a strong film formed on a negative electrode using both the vinylene carbonate compound and the alkyne compound. The improvement on the cycle characteristics is obtained using the non-aqueous electrolytic solution according to the present invention. The improvement is also effective in a conventional lithium secondary battery comprising positive electrode and negative electrode layers of relatively low density.<br>
Effect of the invention<br>
The cycle characteristics of the lithium secondary battery are improved by using the non-aqueous electrolytic solution according to the present invention. The non-aqueous electrolytic solution according to the present invention is particularly effective in improving cycle characteristics of a lithium secondary battery (of high charge capacity) comprising positive electrode or negative electrode composition layer of high density.<br><br>
Best mode for carrying out the invention<br>
In the vinylene carbonate compound according to the present invention represented by the formula (I), each of R1 and R2 independently is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. R1 and R2 can be identical, for exam-ple, both can be methyl or both can be ethyl.  R1 and R2 can be different from each other, for example, they can be a combination of methyl and ethyl.<br>
Examples of the vinylene carbonate compound repre-sented by the formula (I) include vinylene carbonate, 4-methyl-1,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4-ethyl-l, 3-dioxolen-2-one, 4-propyl-1,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4-butyl-l,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4-tert-butyl-1,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4,5-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4,5-diethyl-l,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4,5-dipropyl-l,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4,5-dibutyl-l,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4,5-di-tert-butyl-1,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4-ethyl-5-methyl-l,3-dioxolen-2-one, 4-methyl-5-butyl-l, 3-dioxolen-2-one and 4-methyl-5-tert-butyl-l,3-dioxolen-2-one. Vinylene carbonate is particularly preferred.<br>

An excess amount of the alkyne compound contained in the non-aqueous electrolytic solution might change con-ductivity of the electrolytic solution to lower battery performance. The electrolytic solution contains the al-kyne compound preferably in an amount of 10 wt.% or less, more preferably in an amount of 5 wt.% or less, and most preferably in an amount of 3 wt.% or less.  On the other hand, it is difficult to form a film from an extremely small amount of the alkyne compound. Therefore, shortage of the alkyne compound might cause insufficient battery performance. The electrolytic solution contains the al-kyne compound preferably in an amount of 0.01 wt.% or<br><br>
more, more preferably in an amount of 0.05 wt.% or more, and most preferably in an amount of 0.1 wt.% or more. Accordingly, the non-aqueous electrolytic solution contains the alkyne compound preferably in an amount of 0.01 to 10 wt.%, more preferably in an amount of 0.05 to 5 wt.%, and most preferably in an amount of 0.1 to 3 wt.%.<br>

There is no specific limitation with respect to the structure of the lithium secondary battery according to the present invention. Examples of the structure include a coin-shaped battery comprising a positive electrode, a negative electrode and a separator in the form of one or more layers, and a cylindrical or square-shaped battery<br><br>

The void volume ratio is preferably in the range of 30 to 60%, more preferably in the range of 35 to 55%, and most preferably in the range of 40 to 50%. The void ratio is so adjusted to improve the battery capacity. The thickness of the separator for the battery is preferably thin to increase the energy density.

range of 3.3 to 3.9 g/cm3, and most preferably in the range of 3.4 to 3.8 g/cm3.  If the density of the positive electrode is more than 4.0 g/cm3, it is substantially difficult to prepare the battery. The negative electrode composition layer formed on copper foil has a density preferably in the range of 1.3 to 2.0 g/cm3, more pref-erably in the range of 1.4 to 1.9 g/cm3, and most pref-erably in the range of 1.5 to 1.8 g/cm3.

The electrode layer of the negative electrode according to the present invention has a thickness (per one surface of the collector) preferably in the range of 1 to 100 μm, and more preferably in the range of 3 to 70 μm. If the thickness is smaller than the preferred range, the quantity of an active material in the electrode material layer is lowered to decrease the battery capacity.  If the thickness is larger than the preferred range, the cycle characteristics or the rate characteristics are unfavorably degraded.<br>
There is no specific limitation with respect to the structure of the lithium secondary battery. Examples of the structure include a coin-shaped battery, a cylindri-cal battery, a square-shaped battery and a laminated bat-tery, each of which comprises a positive electrode, a negative electrode, a porous separating membrane and an electrolytic solution.<br>

The bat-tery can also be charged and discharged at a temperature of lower than 100°C, and preferably at a temperature of lower than 80°C.<br>
A safety valve can be attached to a sealing plate to prevent the inner pressure from increasing in the lithium secondary battery according to the present invention. A part of the battery such as a battery cell (can) or a gasket can be cut to prevent the pressure from increas-ing. At least one of various conventional safety attach-ments (for example overcurrent-preventing devices such as a fuse, a bimetal and a PTC element) is preferably attached to the battery.<br>
Two or more lithium secondary batteries according to the present invention can be placed in a battery package while arranging the batteries in series or parallel.

(Preparation of lithium secondary battery and measurement of battery performance)<br>
With 94 wt.% of LiCo02 (active cathode material), 3 wt.% of graphite (conductive material) and polyvinylidene fluoride (binder) were mixed. To the mixture, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (solvent) was added. A surface of aluminum foil was coated with the resulting solution. The mixture was dried, molded under pressure, and heated to form a positive electrode composition layer (cathode).<br>
With 95 wt.% of artificial graphite (active anode material) having a graphitic crystalline structure with a distance (d002) °f 0.335 nm between the lattice between lattice faces (002), 5 wt.% of polyvinylidene fluoride (binder) was mixed. To the mixture, l-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (solvent) was added. A surface of copper foil was coated with the resulting solution. The mixture was dried, molded under pressure and heated to form a negative electrode composition layer (anode).<br>
The positive electrode, the negative electrode and a separator comprising a micro porous polyethylene film (thickness: 20 ym) were placed in a battery vessel. The non-aqueous electrolytic solution was poured into the battery. Carbon dioxide having the dew point of -60°C was introduced into the battery, and the battery was sealed to prepare a cylindrical battery having the size of 18650 (diameter: 18 mm, height: 65 mm). A pressure-discharging opening and an inner current breaker (PTC element) were attached to the battery. The positive electrode composition layer has the density of 3.5 g/cm3, and the negative electrode composition layer has the density of 1.6 g/cm3. The positive electrode composition layer has the thickness of 70 μm (per one surface of the<br><br>
collector), and the negative electrode composition layer has the thickness of 60 ym (per one surface of the collector) .<br>
The 18 650 battery was charged with the constant current of 2.2 A (1C) at a high temperature (60°C) to reach 4.2V, The battery was further charged under the constant voltage for 3 hours in total to reach the final voltage of 4.2 V. The battery was discharged under the constant current of 2.2 A (1C) to reach the final voltage of 3.0 V. The cycle of charge and discharge was repeated. The initial discharging capacity (mAh) was the substantially same (1.01) as the result using 1M of LiPF6-EC/PC/MEC (volume ratio: 30/5/65) containing no alkyne compound as the non-aqueous electrolytic solution (Comparison Example 1 described above). The battery per-formance was measured after 300 cycles. The remaining rate of the discharging capacity to the initial discharg-ing capacity (100%) was 82.5%.<br>
After the cycle test was repeated five times, the 18650 battery was fully charged to reach 4.2V at the or-dinary temperature (20°C), and further charged with the constant current of 2.2A (1C) for 2 hours to conduct an excessive charge test.
