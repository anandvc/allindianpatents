CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119 (e) of United States<br>
Provisional Application Serial No. 60/762,780, filed January 27, 2006, which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to methods and compounds capable of decreasing<br>
hypoxia inducible factor (HTF) hydroxylase enzyme activity, thereby increasing the stability<br>
and/or activity of HIF. In particular, the compounds increase endogenous erythropoietin, ex<br>
vivo and in vivo.<br>
State of the Art<br>
[0003] Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS<br>
(Per/Arnt/Sim) transcriptional activator that mediates changes in gene expression in response<br>
to changes in cellular oxygen concentration. HTF is a heterodimer containing an oxygen-<br>
regulated α-subunit (HTFα), and a constitutively expressed β-subunit (HIFβ), also known as<br>
aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter (ARNT). In oxygenated (normoxic) cells, HIFα<br>
subunits are rapidly degraded by a mechanism that involves ubiquitination by the von Hippel-<br>
Lindau tumor suppressor (p VHL) E3 ligase complex. Under hypoxic conditions, HlFα is not<br>
degraded, and an active HIFα/β complex accumulates in the nucleus, and activates the<br>
expression of several genes including glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters, erythropoietin<br>
(EPO), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). (Jiang, et al., (1996) J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
271:17771-17778; lliopoulus, et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93:10595-10599;<br>
Maxwell, et al., (1999), Nature, 399:271-275; Sutter, et al., (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,<br>
97:4748-4753; Cockman, et al., (2000) J. Biol. Chem., 275:25733-25741; and Tanimoto, et al.,<br>
(2000) EMBO. J. 19:4298-4309.)<br>
[0004] Levels of HIFα arc elevated in most cells in response to hypoxia, and HIFα is induced<br>
in vivo when animals are subjected to anemia or hypoxia. HIFα levels rise within a few hours<br>
after the onset of hypoxia, and induce numerous beneficial cellular processes including<br><br>
cytoprotective effects, enhanced erythropoiesis, and physiological adaptation to ischemic or<br>
hypoxic states. Induction of HIFα is potentially beneficial in conditions such as myocardial<br>
acute ischemia and early infarction, pulmonary hypertension, inflammation, and anemia.<br>
[0005] HIFα levels are also increased by a number of factors that mimic hypoxia, including<br>
iron chelators such as desfcrrioxaminc (DFO), and divalent metal salts such as CoCl2.<br>
Additionally, compounds originally identified as inhibitors of procollagen prolyl hydroxylase<br>
enzymes have been found to stabilize HIFα. Examples of such compounds can be found, e.g.,<br>
in Majamaa et al. (1984) Eur J Biochem 138:239-245; Majamaa et al. (1985) Biochem J<br>
229:127-133; Kivirikko and Myllyharju (1998) Matrix Biol 16:357-368; Bickel et al. (1998)<br>
Hepatology 28:404-411; Friedman et al. (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:4736-4741;<br>
Franklin (1991) Biochem Soc Trans 19:812-815; and Franklin et al. (2001) Biochem J<br>
353:333-338. Additionally, compounds that stabilize HIFα have been described in, e.g.,<br>
International Publication Nos. WO 03/049686, WO 02/074981, WO 03/080566, WO<br>
2004/108681, and WO 2006/094292.<br>
[0006] There remains a need for compounds that are effective in the prevention of disorders<br>
associated with HIF, including anemia, and tissue damage caused by ischemia that occurs due<br>
to, e.g., atherosclerosis, diabetes, and pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary embolism, and<br>
the like. Thus, compounds that modulate HIF, which can be used to treat, and prevent HIF-<br>
associated disorders including conditions involving anemia, ischemia, and hypoxia, are<br>
provided herein.<br>

[0041] The term "anemia" as used herein refers to any abnormality in hemoglobin or<br>
erythrocytes that leads to reduced oxygen levels in the blood. Anemia can be associated with<br>
abnormal production, processing, or performance of erythrocytes and/or hemoglobin. The<br>
term anemia refers to any reduction in the number of red blood cells and/or level of<br>
hemoglobin in blood relative to normal blood levels.<br>
[0042] Anemia can arise due to conditions such as acute or chronic kidney disease,<br>
infections, inflammation, cancer, irradiation, toxins, diabetes, and surgery. Infections may be<br>
due to, e.g., virus, bacteria, and/or parasites, etc. Inflammation may be due to infection or<br>
autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Anemia can also be associated with<br>
blood loss due to, e.g., stomach ulcer, duodenal ulcer, hemorrhoids, cancer of the stomach or<br>
large intestine, trauma, injury, surgical procedures, etc. Anemia is further associated with<br>
radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and kidney dialysis. Anemia is also associated with HIV-<br>
infected patients undergoing treatment with azidothymidine (zidovudine) or other reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitors, and can develop in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, e.g.,<br>
with cyclic cisplatin- or non-cisplatin-containing chemotherapeutics. Aplastic anemia and<br>
myelodysplastic syndromes are diseases associated with bone marrow failure that result in<br>
decreased production of erythrocytes. Further, anemia can result from defective or abnormal<br>
hemoglobin or erythrocytes, such as in disorders including microcytic anemia, hypochromic<br>
anemia, etc. Anemia can result from disorders in iron transport, processing, and utilization,<br>
sec, e.g., sideroblastic anemia, etc.<br>

anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, bone marrow transplantation, Churg-Strauss<br>
syndrome, Diamond Blackfan anemia, Fanconi's anemia, Felty syndrome, graft versus host<br>
disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, hemolytic uremic syndrome, myelodysplastic<br>
syndrome, nocturnal paroxysmal hemoglobinuria, osteomyelofibrosis, pancytopenia, pure red-<br>
cell aplasia, purpura Schoenlein-Henoch, sideroblastic anemia, refractory anemia with excess<br>
of blasts, rheumatoid arthritis, Shwachman syndrome, sickle cell disease, thalassemia major,<br>
thalassemia minor, thrombocytopenic purpura, etc.<br><br>
[0045] The term "erythropoietin-associated conditions" is used inclusively and refers to any<br>
condition associated with below normal, abnormal, or inappropriate modulation of<br>
erythropoietin. Erythropoietin-associated conditions include any condition wherein an increase<br>
in EPO level would provide therapeutic benefit. Levels of erythropoietin associated with such<br>
conditions can be determined by any measure accepted and utilized by those of skill in the art.<br>
Erythropoietin-associated conditions include anemic conditions such as those described above.<br>
[0046] Erythropoietin-associated conditions further include neurological disorders and/or<br>
injuries, including cases of stroke, trauma, epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease and the like,<br>
wherein erythropoietin may provide a neuroprotective effect. Neurodegenerative diseases<br>

routine cloning techniques, for example by using all or part of a HIFα gene sequence described<br>
above as a probe to recover and determine the sequence of a HIFα gene in another species.<br>
[0049] A fragment of HIFα includes any fragment retaining at least one functional or<br>
structural characteristic of HIFα. Fragments of HIFα include, e.g., the regions defined by<br>
human HIF-1α from amino acids 401 to 603 (Huang et al., supra), amino acid 531 to 575<br><br>
(Jiang et al. (1997) J Biol. Chem 272:19253-19260), amino acid 556 to 575 (Tanimoto et al.,<br>
supra), amino acid 557 to 571 (Srinivas et al. (1999) Biochem Biophys Res. Commun<br>
260:557-561), and amino acid 556 to 575 (Ivan and Kaelin (2001) Science 292:464-468).<br>
Further, HIFα fragments include any fragment containing at least one occurrence of the motif<br>
LXXLAP. (See Gcnbank Accession No. Q16665.)<br>

acid sequence" and like terms are not meant to limit the amino acid sequence to the complete<br>
native sequence associated with the recited protein molecule.<br>
[0051] The term "related proteins" as used herein, for example, to refer to proteins related to<br>
HTFα prolyl hydroxylase, encompasses other 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzymes, especially<br>
those family members that similarly require Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, and oxygen to maintain<br>
hydroxylase activity. Such enzymes include, but are not limited to, e.g., procollagen lysyl<br>
hydroxylase, procollagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), an<br>
asparaginyl hydroxylase responsible for regulating transactivation of HIFα. (GenBank<br>

[0111] The compounds of the present invention, or compositions or medicaments thereof,<br>
can also be used to increase endogenous erythropoietin (EPO). The compounds, or<br>

found in disorders such as microcytic anemia, hypochromic anemia, aplastic anemia, etc.<br>
[0112] The compounds can be used to increase endogenous EPO in a subject undergoing a<br>

anemic patient being treated with azidothymidine (zidovudine) or other reverse transcriptase<br>
inhibitors, an anemic cancer patient receiving cyclic cisplatin- or non-cisplatin-containing<br>
chemotherapeutics, or an anemic or non-anemic patient scheduled to undergo surgery.<br>

D. Synthesis of Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0115] The compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting<br>
materials using the following general methods and procedures. Tt will be appreciated that<br>
where typical or preferred process conditions(i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mol ratios of<br>
reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless<br>
otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or<br>
solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine<br>
optimization procedures.<br>
[0116] Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting<br>
groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired<br>
reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable<br>
conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the<br>
art. For example, numerous protecting groups are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts,<br>
Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and<br>
references cited therein.<br><br>
[0117] Furthermore, the compounds of this invention may contain one or more chirai centers.<br>
Accordingly, if desired, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers,<br>
i.e., as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as stereoisomer-enriched mixtures. All<br>
such stereoisomers (and enriched mixtures) are included within the scope of this invention,<br>
unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers (or enriched mixtures) may be prepared using,<br>
for example, optically active starting materials or stereoselective reagents well-known in the<br>
art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such compounds can be separated using, for example,<br>
chirai column chromatography, chirai resolving agents and the like.<br>
[0118] The starting materials for the following reactions are generally known compounds or<br>
can be prepared by known procedures or obvious modifications thereof. For example, many of<br>
the starting materials are available from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Co.<br>
(Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA), Bachem (Torrance, California, USA), Emka-Chemce or Sigma<br>
(St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Others may be prepared by procedures, or obvious modifications<br>
thereof, described in standard reference texts such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic<br>
Synthesis, Volumes 1-15 (John Wiley, and Sons, 1991), Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon<br>
Compounds, Volumes 1-5, and Supplementals (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989), Organic<br>
Reactions, Volumes 1-40 (John Wiley, and Sons, 1991), March's Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry, (John Wiley, and Sons, 5th Edition, 2001), and Larock's Comprehensive Organic<br>
Transformations (VCH Publishers Inc., 1989).<br>
[0119] The isoquinolines 300,1000, and 1100 of this invention can be prepared by the<br>
synthetic protocols illustrated in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
[0120] R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are as defined herein. Compound 100 (wherein PG1 refers to a<br>
suitable protecting group such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, etc.) are reacted with at least a<br>
stoichiometric amount and preferably an excess of a suitable alpha-amino acid, compound 200<br>
(particularly, but not limited to, glycine). The reaction is conducted under conventional<br>
coupling conditions well known in the art. In one embodiment, the reaction is conducted in the<br>
presence of sodium methoxide or another suitable base in methanol or another suitable solvent<br>
under elevated reaction temperatures and particularly at reflux. The reaction is continued until<br>
it is substantially complete which typically occurs within about 1 to 72 h. Alternatively, the<br><br>
reaction can be performed at elevated temperatures in a microwave oven. Upon reaction<br>
completion, the compound 300 can be recovered by conventional techniques such as<br>
neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like.<br>
[0121] Alternatively, coupling of compound 100 (typically as the corresponding free acid)<br>
with compound 200 (typically as ester derivatives) can proceed via conventional peptide<br>
coupling procedures well known in the art. This coupling reaction is typically conducted using<br>
well-known coupling reagents such as carbodiimides, BOP reagent (benzotriazol-1-yloxy-<br>
tris(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphonate) and the like. Suitable<br>
carbodiimides include, by way of example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l-(3-<br>
dimethylamino-propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (DECT) and the like. Tf desired, polymer<br>
supported forms of carbodiimide coupling reagents may also be used including, for example,<br>
those described in Tetrahedron Letters, 34(48), 7685 (1993). Additionally, well-known<br>
coupling promoters, such as N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and the like, may<br>
be used to facilitate the coupling reaction. This coupling reaction is typically conducted by<br>
contacting the corresponding free acids of compound 100 with about 1 to about 2 equivalents<br>
of the coupling reagent and at least one equivalent, preferably about 1 to about 1.2 equivalents,<br>
of an ester of compound 200, in an inert diluent such as dichloromethane, chloroform,<br>
acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide and the like. Generally, this reaction is<br>
conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 37°C for about 12 to about 24<br>
hours. Upon completion of the reaction, the corresponding ester of compound 300 is recovered<br>
by conventional methods including neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography,<br>
filtration, and the like, and is then transformed into compound 300 by hydrolysis.<br>
[0122] Alternatively, compound 100 (typically as the corresponding free acid) can be<br>
converted into an acid halide and the acid halide coupled with the ester of compound 200 to<br>
provide for the esters of compound 300. The acid halide of compound 100 can be prepared by<br>
contacting compound 100 (typically as the corresponding free acid) with an inorganic acid<br>
halide such as thionyl chloride, phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous tribromide, or<br>
phosphorous pentachloride, or, particularly, with oxalyl chloride under conventional<br>
conditions. Generally, this reaction is conducted using about 1 to 5 molar equivalents of the<br>
inorganic acid halide or oxalyl chloride, either neat or in an inert solvent such as<br>
dichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride, at temperature in the range of about 0°C to about<br>
80°C for about 1 to about 48 hours. A catalyst, such as DMF, may also be used in this<br>
reaction.<br><br>
[0123] The acid halide (not shown) is then contacted with at least one equivalent, preferably<br>
about 1.1 to about 1.5 equivalents, of an ester of compound 200, in an inert diluent such as<br>
dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about -70°C to about 40°C for about 1 to about<br>
24 hours. Preferably, this reaction is conducted in the presence of a suitable base to scavenge<br>
the acid generated during the reaction. Suitable bases include, by way of example, tertiary<br>
amines such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methyl-morpholine, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction can be conducted under Schotten-Baumann-type conditions using<br>
aqueous alkali such as sodium hydroxide and the like. Upon completion of the reaction, the<br>
ester of compound 300 is recovered by conventional methods including neutralization,<br>
extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration, and the like, and is then transformed into<br>
compound 300 by hydrolysis.<br>
[0124] Compound 100 may be obtained by cyanation of compound 500 (wherein X is Cl, Br,<br>
or I; and PGl refers to a suitable protecting group such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, etc.) with a<br>
suitable cyanide source such as, by way of example, CuCN, Zn(CN)2, etc. The cyanation may<br>
occur in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as, by way of example, palladium catalyst such<br>
as tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (see, e.g., Sundenneier et al. (2003) Eur. J. Inorg.<br>
Chem 2003(19):3513-3526) and/or additives using a suitable solvent such as, by way of<br>
example, DMF or N.N-dimethylacetarnide. Upon reaction completion, compound 100 can be<br>
recovered by conventional techniques such as neutralization, extraction, precipitation,<br>
chromatography, filtration and the like; or, alternatively, used in the next step without<br>
purification and/or isolation. Compound 100 obtained by this method may be further altered by<br>
modifying its R1, R2, R3, and/or R4 moieties, e.g., if R3 is OCH2Ph, the R3 moiety can be<br>
transformed into OH using conventional reduction techniques (particularly by hydrogenation<br>
catalyzed by palladium on carbon, etc.).<br>
[0125] Alternatively, compound 400 (wherein X is selected from Cl, Br, or I) may be reacted<br>
with a suitable cyanide source such as, by way of example, CuCN, Zn(CN)2, etc. to give<br>
compound 300. The cyanation may be carried out as described above. Upon reaction<br>
completion, compound 300 can be recovered by conventional techniques such as<br>
neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like; or,<br>
alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or isolation. Compound 400 may<br>
be obtained by reaction between compound 500 (wherein X is selected from Cl, Br, or I; and<br>
PG1 refers to a suitable protecting group such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, etc.) and compound 200<br>
in analogy to the corresponding reactions between compound 100 and compound 200 (Scheme<br><br>
1; also, see U.S. Patent No. 6,093,730 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No.<br>
2006/217416, which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
[0126] Alternatively, the 4-hydroxy group of compound 500 can be alkylated with suitable<br>
reagents such as, by way of example, alkyl halides, alkyl sulfates, benzyl halides, diazo<br>
compounds, etc. The alkylation may take place in the presence of suitable base such as<br>
CS2CO3 and/or additives using a suitable solvent such as, by way of example, DMF to give<br>
compound 600 (wherein PG2 is preferably but not limited to, methyl). Upon reaction<br>
completion, compound 600 can be recovered by conventional techniques such as<br>
neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like; or,<br>
alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0127] Compound 600 (wherein X is selected from Cl, Br, or I) can be reacted with a suitable<br>
cyanide source such as, by way of example, CuCN, Zn(CN)2, etc., to give compound 700. The<br>
cyanation may be carried out as described above. Hydrolysis of compound 700 using<br>
conventional standard conditions provides compound 800. Upon reaction completion,<br>
compound 800 can be recovered by conventional techniques such as neutralization, extraction,<br>
precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like; or, alternatively, used in the next step<br>
without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0128] Coupling of compound 800 with compound 900 (wherein PG3 refers to a suitable<br>
protecting group such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, etc.; preformed or generated in situ from its salts<br>
by addition of a suitable base) can proceed via conventional peptide coupling procedures well<br>
known in the art and as described above. The coupling reaction is typically conducted by<br>
contacting compound 800 with about 1 to about 2 equivalents of the coupling reagent and at<br>
least one equivalent, preferably about 1 to about 1.2 equivalents, of compound 900, in an inert<br>
diluent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide and the like and, if required, in the presence of a suitable base. Generally,<br>
this reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 37°C for about 12<br>
to about 24 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, compound 1000 is recovered by<br>
conventional methods including neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography,<br>
filtration, and the like, and can then be transformed into compound 1100 by hydrolysis.<br>
[0129] Alternatively, compound 800 can be converted into an acid halide and the acid halide<br>
coupled with compound 900 to provide compound 1000. The acid halide of compound 800<br>
can be prepared by contacting compounds 800 with an inorganic acid halide or with oxalyl<br>
chloride under conventional conditions, e.g., as described above. The acid halide (not shown)<br>
is then contacted with at least one equivalent, preferably about 1.1 to about 1.5 equivalents of<br><br>
compound 900 in an inert diluent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from<br>
about -70 °C to about 40 °C for about 1 to about 24 hours. Preferably, this reaction is<br>
conducted in the presence of a suitable base to scavenge the acid generated during the reaction.<br>
Suitable bases include tertiary amines such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methyl-<br>
morpholinc, and the like. Alternatively, the reaction can be conducted under Schottcn-<br>
Baumann-type conditions using aqueous alkali such as sodium hydroxide and the like. Upon<br>
completion of the reaction, compound 1000 is recovered by conventional methods including<br>
neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration, and the like, and can then<br>
be transformed into compound 1100 by hydrolysis (Scheme 1).<br>

phosphorous oxychloride or phosphorous oxybromide using a suitable solvent such as<br>
acetonitrile or toluene particularly at reflux temperature gives compound 500 wherein X is Cl<br>
or Br, respectively. The reaction typically occurs within about 1 to 72 h. Alternatively, the<br>
reaction can be performed at elevated temperatures in a microwave oven. Upon reaction<br>
completion, compound 500 can be recovered by conventional techniques such as<br>
neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like; or,<br>
alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0132] Alternatively, compound 1300 can be halogenated using conventional methods to<br>
give compound 500 wherein X is Cl, Br, or I. The halogenation of compound 1300 can be<br>
performed with a stoichiometric amount or slight excess of, e.g., N-bromosuccinimidc in the<br><br>
presence of a catalytic amount of benzoylperoxide, azobisisobutyronitrile, or another suitable<br>
free radical initiator, in CCl4, benzene, or another suitable solvent known to one skilled in the<br>
art typically at reflux temperature or higher temperatures using a microwave oven. Upon<br>
reaction completion, compounds 500 can be recovered by conventional techniques such as<br>
neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like; or,<br>

butanol at an elevated temperature of about 95-100°C for about 1 to 4 h. Compound 1500 is<br>
either commercially available or are easily obtained by reacting the phthalic acid, compound<br>
1400 or its derivatives (particularly the corresponding acid anhydrides) with an cquimolar<br>
amount of glycine or salts of glycine esters (particularly hydrochloride salts of glycine methyl,<br>
ethyl or butyl ester) neat typically at 150 to 250 °C for 15 to 90 min until no water is released.<br>
If glycine is used, the product (R = H) is esterified using conventional methods, e.g., by<br>
refiuxing in a suitable alcohol such as methanol or ethanol in the presence of a concentrated<br><br>
sulfuric acid, etc. Compound 1400 and its derivatives, e.g., the corresponding acid anhydrides,<br>
are either commercially available or are easily accessible by reacting compound 1600 with an<br>
excess of phenol ArOH in a suitable solvent such as, e.g., DMF, in the presence of a base such<br>
as, by example, an excess of potassium carbonate. The resulting compound 1700 is readily<br>
hydrolyzcd by rcfluxing in a solution of KOH in watcr/mcthanol (typically 1 to 3 days) to give<br>
the compound 1400.<br>
[0135] Alternatively, compound 1400 can be obtained by analogous methods from<br>
compound 1800. Reaction between compound 1800 and phenol ArOH provides compound<br>
1900, which can be readily hydrolyzed to the corresponding phthalic acid, compound 1400.<br>
Bipheny]-2,3-dicarboxylic acid can be obtained by oxidation of compound 2000 with<br>
potassium permanganate in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. Alternatively, compound<br>
1500 can be obtained by reacting compound 2100 with an excess of a phenolate such as, by<br>
way of example, sodium phenolates ArONa, typically by heating in DMF. The resulting<br>
phthalimide, compound 2200, can be transformed to compound 1500 by N-alkylation with an<br>
excess of a haloacetic acid ester such as, by way of example, the methyl or ethyl esters of<br>
bromoacetic acid, using conventional methods such as refluxing in a suitable solvent such as<br>
acetone in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium carbonate. Compound 1500 can<br>
be obtained analogously by N-alkylation of commercially available phthalimides, compound<br>
2400. Alternatively, compound 1500 can be obtained by N-alkylation of compound 2100<br>
using methods as described above. The resulting compound 2300 can be transformed to<br>
compound 1500 by reaction with phenols ArOH in a suitable solvent, such as<br>
dimcthylacctamidc at 105°C, in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium carbonate.<br>
Alternatively, compound 1500 with a phenolic OH group can be transformed to the<br>
corresponding phenol ethers by O-alkylation using conventional methods such as, by way of<br>
example, refluxing with electrophiles such as methyl iodide (Mel), isopropyl iodide (iPrI),<br>
butyl iodide (BuI), etc. in the presence of a base or by alkylating the phenolic OH group with<br>
an alcohol such as cyclohexanol using a variant of the Mitsunobu reaction.<br>
[0136] Compound 1300, for use in the reactions above, can be obtained using the methods<br>
outlined in Scheme 4 (see also US2006/217416).<br><br><br>
[0137] R1, R2, R3, and R4 axe as defined herein. Compound 2500 (particularly wherein R is<br>
methyl or ethyl, and X is Cl, Br, or I; preformed or generated in situ by anion exchange using<br>
sodium iodide) is reacted with a protected glycine ester, compound 2600 (particularly wherein<br>
PG1 is methyl or ethyl and PG4 is toluene-4-sulfonyl or 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl) in the presence<br>
of a suitable base such as potassium carbonate, optionally in the presence of sodium iodide, in<br>
a suitable solvent such as DMF at, e.g., room temperature for about 2 to 24 h. Upon reaction<br>
completion, the resulting compound 2700 can be recovered by conventional techniques such as<br>
neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like; or,<br>
alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or isolation. Alternatively,<br>
compound 2700 with a phenolic OH group can be transformed to the corresponding phenol<br>
ethers by O-alkylation using conventional methods such as, by way of example, refluxing with<br>
electrophiles such as benzyl bromide, etc. in the presence of a base.<br>
[0138] Compound 2700 wherein PG4 is, e.g., 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, can be cyclized to<br>
compound 2800 by treatment with a suitable base such as, by way of example, 2 equivalents of<br>
potassium tert-butoxide, in THF at 0°C for about 1 h and then room temperature for about 3 h.<br>
Upon reaction completion, the resulting compound 2800 can be recovered by conventional<br>
techniques such as neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the<br>
like; or, alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or isolation. Compound<br>
2800 is then treated with thionyl chloride, e.g., about 1.5 equivalents, in a suitable solvent such<br>
as dichloromethane at 0°C for about 1 h and then room temperature for about 3 h. Upon<br>
reaction completion, the resulting compound 1300 can be recovered by conventional<br><br>
techniques such as neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the<br>
like; or, alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or isolation. Alternatively,<br>
compound 2700 wherein PG4 is, e.g., toluene-4-sulfonyl, can be cyclized by treatment with a<br>
suitable base such as, by way of example, 3 to 4 equivalents of sodium methoxide in methanol<br>
at room temperature for 3 h to 3 d. Upon reaction completion, the resulting compound 1300<br>
can be recovered by conventional techniques such as neutralization, extraction, precipitation,<br>
chromatography, filtration and the like; or, alternatively, used in the next step without<br>
purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0139] Compound 1300 can be further altered by modifying its R1, R2, R3, and/or R4<br>
moieties. For example, R2 is SPh then the R2 moiety can be transformed into SO2Ph using<br>
conventional oxidation techniques such as, by way of example, treatment with m-<br>
chloroperoxybenzoic acid in methylenechloride at room temperature. Alternatively, if R4 is,<br>
e.g., iodine, the iodine atom can be substituted with phenols ArOH such as, e.g., ortho-, metha-<br>
, and para-methoxyphenol, to give the corresponding 8-aryloxy isoquinolines by reacting the<br>
iodo-isoquinoline with AxOH, e.g., 5 equivalents in a suitable solvent such as DMF at reflux<br>
temperature in the presence of a suitable base, such as 5 equivalent of cesium carbonate, and a<br>
suitable catalyst, such as 1 equivalent of CuCl and 0.4 equivalents of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-<br>
heptane-3,5-dione, for about 15 min. Upon reaction completion, the resulting compound 1300<br>
can be recovered by conventional techniques such as neutralization, extraction, precipitation,<br>
chromatography, filtration and the like; or, alternatively, used in the next step without<br>
purification and/or isolation.<br>

methods outlined in Scheme 5 (see also US2006/217416).<br><br><br>
[0141] R1, R2, R3, and R4 are as defined herein. Compound 2500, particularly ortho-toluic<br>
acid esters such as 3100, 3300, 3400, or 3800 wherein R is, e.g., methyl or ethyl, can be<br>
halogcnatcd, by way of example, by addition of a stoichiometric amount or a slight excess of<br>
N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of a catalytic amount of benzoylperoxide,<br>
azobisisobutyronitrile, or another suitable free radical initiator in CCl4, benzene or another<br>
suitable solvent at, e.g., reflux temperature. Upon reaction completion, compound 2500 can be<br>
recovered by conventional techniques such as neutralization, extraction, precipitation,<br>
chromatography, filtration and the like; or, alternatively, used in the next step without<br>
purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0142] Compound 3100 is accessible typically by reacting a mixture of the sodium salt of<br>
compound 2900, a slight excess of a sodium phenolate ArONa, a catalytic amount of copper<br>
bronze, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene at, e.g., reflux temperature for about 2 h. Upon reaction<br>
completion, compound 3000 can be recovered by conventional techniques such as<br>
neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like; or,<br>

3200 are easily converted to the corresponding esters, compounds 3100 and 3300, respectively,<br>
using conventional methods such as refluxing in a suitable alcohol such as methanol or ethanol<br>
in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid; or refluxing together with an alkylating reagent<br>
such as dimethylsulfate in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a suitable<br>
solvent such as dicthylkctonc. Compound 3400 can be obtained by adding compound 3300, an<br>
excess of phenol, an excess of cesium carbonate, and an excess of 1-naphthoic acid, molecular<br>
sieves, a catalytic amount of ethyl acetate, and an appropriate solvent such as anhydrous<br>
toluene to a catalytic amount of copper(I) trifluoromethanesulfonate-benzene complex at room<br>
temperature. The mixture is refluxed under nitrogen for about 2 days before it is cooled to<br>
room temperature and filtered. Compound 3400 can be recovered by conventional techniques<br>
such as neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like; or,<br>
alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or isolation. Alternatively, a<br>
mixture of compound 3300, an excess of an appropriately substituted phenol, an excess of<br>
cesium carbonate, an excess of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dione, and copper (T) chloride in<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone can be heated at 100 to 150°C for 1-5 days, cooled to room<br>
temperature, and quenched with water. Compound 3400 can then be recovered by<br>
conventional techniques such as neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography,<br>
filtration and the like; or, alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or<br>
isolation. Compound 3800 are easily accessible by treatment of 3700 with tert-buryl-<br>
dimethylsilylchloride.<br>
[0143] Alternatively, compound 2500 is obtained by reaction of appropriately substituted<br>
phthalidcs such as compound 3600 with suitable halogenating reagents such as, by way of<br>
example, 1.3 equivalents of thionylchloride in the presence of suitable catalysts such as boric<br>
acid and triphenylphosphine oxide at 130 to 140°C for about 18 h followed by treatment with<br>
an appropriate alcohol such as methanol. Compound 2500 can be recovered by conventional<br>
techniques such as neutralization, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the<br>
like; or, alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or isolation. Compound<br>
3600 is easily obtained by reacting 3500 with benzylzinc bromide using a variant of the<br>
Negishi coupling.<br>
E. Compound Testing<br>
[0144] The biological activity of the compounds of the invention may be assessed using any<br>
conventionally known methods. Suitable assay methods are well known in the art. The<br><br>
following assays are presented only as examples and are not intended to be limiting. The<br>
compounds of the invention are active in at least one of the following assays.<br>
[0145] It is contemplated that due to the cyano substitution at the C-1 position of the<br>
isoquinoline compounds, the compounds of the invention show surprising and unexpected<br>
improved efficacy over comparable compounds not possessing cyano at the C-1 position. For<br>
example, compounds having a cyano at the C-1 position of the isoquininoline ring, when<br>
compared to corresponding compounds having, for example, hydrogen, methyl, or halogen, at<br>
the C-1 position are more than 2-fold, more particularly, more than 4-fold, even more<br>
particularly more than 10-fold or 50-fold more potent at increasing circulating erythropoietin<br>
levels. Examples of this are more thoroughly discussed in Example 54.<br>
a.	Cell-based HIFα stabilization assay<br>
[0146] Human cells derived from various tissues are separately seeded into 35 mm culture<br>
dishes and grown at 37°C, 20% O2, 5% CO2 in standard culture medium, e.g., DMEM, 10%<br>
FBS. When cell layers reach confluence, the media is replaced with OPTI-MEM media<br>
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA) and cell layers are incubated for approximately<br>
24 hours in 20% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Compound or 0.013% DMSO is then added to existing<br>
medium, and incubation is continued overnight.<br>
[0147] Following incubation, the media is removed, centrifuged, and stored for analysis (sec<br>
VEGF and EPO assays below). The cells are washed two times in cold phosphate buffered<br>
saline (PBS) and then lysed in 1 mL of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl,<br>
0.5% IGEPAL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO), and a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular<br>
Biochemicals) for 15 minutes on ice. Cell lysates are centrifuged at 3,000 xg for 5 minutes at<br>
4 °C, and the cytosolic fractions (supernatant) are collected. The nuclei (pellet) are<br>
resuspended and lysed in 100 μL of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1<br>
mM dithiothreitol, and a protease mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), centrifuged at 13,000<br>
xg for 5 minutes at 4 °C, and the nuclear protein fractions (supernatant) are collected.<br>
[0148] Nuclear fractions are analyzed for HIF-1α using a QUANTIKINE immunoassay<br>
(R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
b.	Cell-based VEGF and EPO ELISA assays<br>
[0149] Conditioned media collected from cell cultures as described above is analyzed for<br>
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or erythropoietin (EPO) expression using an<br><br>
appropriate QUANTUKINE immunoassay (R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions.<br>
c. HIF-PH assay<br>
[0150] Ketoglutaric acid a-[l-14C]-sodium salt, Ketoglutaric aci4-[l-14C]-sodium salt, alpha-<br>
ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, and HPLC purified peptide may be obtained from commercial<br>
sources, e.g., Perkin-Elmer (Wellesley MA), Sigma-Aldrich, and SynPep Corp. (Dublin CA),<br>
respectively. Peptides for use in the assay may be fragments of HlFα as described above or as<br>
disclosed in International Publication WO 2005/118836, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
HIF-PH, e.g., HIF-PH2 (EGLNl) can be expressed in, e.g., insect Hi5 cells and partially<br>
purified, e.g., through a SP ion exchange chromatography column. Enzyme activity is<br>
determined by capturing 14CO2 using an assay described by Kivirikko and Myllyla (1982,<br>
Methods Enzymol 82:245-304). Assay reactions contain 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μM oc-<br>
kctoglutaric acid sodium salt, 0.30 μCi/ml, ketoglutaric acid a-[1-14C]- sodium salt; 40 μM<br>
FeSO4, lmM ascorbate, 1541.8 units/mL Catalase, with or without 50 μM peptide substrate<br>
and various concentrations of compound of the invention. Reactions are initiated by addition<br>
of HIF-PH enzyme.<br>
[0151] The peptide-dependent percent turnover is calculated by subtracting percent turnover<br>
in the absence of peptide from percent turnover in the presence of substrate peptide. Percent<br>
inhibition and IC50 are calculated using peptide-dependent percent turnover at given inhibitor<br>
concentrations. Caiculation of IC50 values for each inhibitor is conducted, e.g., using GraFit<br>
software (Erithacus Software Ltd., Surrey UK).<br>
[0152] The compounds of the present invention when tested in assays, demonstrated<br>
improved activity as compared to non-cyano compounds, as shown in Table 1 below. Table 1<br>
can be found in example 54.<br>
F. Pharmaceutical Formulations and Routes of Administration<br>
[0153] The compounds of the present invention can be delivered directly or in<br>
pharmaceutical compositions along with suitable carriers or excipients, as is well known in the<br>
art. Various treatments embodied herein can comprise administration of an effective amount<br>
of a compound of the invention to a subject in need, e.g., a subject having or at risk for anemia<br>
due to, e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes, cancer, AIDS, radiation therapy, chemotherapy,<br>
kidney dialysis, or surgery. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a mammalian subject,<br>
and in a most preferred embodiment, the subject is a human subject.<br><br>
10154] An effective amount of a compound can readily be determined by routine<br>
experimentation, as can the most effective and convenient route of administration and the most<br>
appropriate formulation. Various formulations and drug delivery systems are available in the<br>
art. See, e.g., Gennaro, A.R., ed. (1995) Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra.<br>
[0155] Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, transmucosal,<br>
nasal, or intestinal administration and parenteral delivery, including intramuscular,<br>
subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular,<br>
intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. The compound or<br>
composition thereof may be administered in a local rather than a systemic manner. For<br>
example, a compound or composition thereof can be delivered via injection or in a targeted<br>
drug delivery system, such as a depot or sustained release formulation.<br>
[0156] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by<br>
any of the methods well-known in the art, such as by conventional mixing, dissolving,<br>
granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing<br>
processes. As noted above, the compositions of the present invention can include one or more<br>
physiologically acceptable carriers such as excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing<br>
of active molecules into preparations for pharmaceutical use.<br>
[0157] Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. For<br>
injection, for example, the composition may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in<br>
physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological<br>
saline buffer. For transmucosal or nasal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to<br>
be permeated arc used in the formulation. Such penetrants arc generally known in the art. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the present compounds are prepared in a<br>
formulation intended for oral administration. For oral administration, the compounds can be<br>
formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be<br>
formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and<br>
the like, for oral ingestion by a subject. The compounds may also be formulated in rectal<br>
compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional<br>
suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
[0158] Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as solid excipients,<br>
optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding<br>
suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in<br>
particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose<br><br>
preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin,<br>
gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethylceliulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents<br>
may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt<br>
thereof such as sodium alginate. Also, wetting agents such as sodium dodccyl sulfate may be<br>
included.<br>
[0159] Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated<br>
sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and<br>
suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the<br>
tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active<br>
compound doses.<br>
[0160] Pharmaceutical preparations for oral administration include push-fit capsules made of<br>
gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or<br>
sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such<br>
as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and,<br>
optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended<br>
in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols, in<br>
addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in<br>
dosages suitable for such administration.<br>
[0161] In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention can be administered<br>
transdcrmally, such as through a skin patch, or topically. In one aspect, the transdermal or<br>
topical formulations of the present invention can additionally comprise one or multiple<br>
penetration enhancers or other effectors, including agents that enhance migration of the<br>
delivered compound. Transdermal or topical administration could be preferred, for example, in<br>
situations in which location specific delivery is desired.<br>
[0162] For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present<br>
invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from<br>
pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or<br>
any other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the appropriate dosage unit may be<br>
determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, for<br>
example, gelatin, for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated. These typically<br>
contain a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br><br>
[0163] Compositions formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus<br>
injection or continuous infusion can be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in<br>
multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as<br>
suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory<br>
agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Formulations for parenteral<br>
administration include aqueous solutions or other compositions in water-soluble form.<br>
[0164] Suspensions of the active compounds may also be prepared as appropriate oily<br>
injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame<br>
oil and synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous<br>
injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension,<br>
such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may<br>
also contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow<br>
for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may<br>
be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water,<br>
before use.<br>
[01651 As mentioned above, the compositions of the present invention may also be<br>
formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by<br>
implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection.<br>
Thus, for example, the present compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or<br>
hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange<br>
resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
[0166] Suitable carriers for the hydrophobic molecules of the invention arc well known in the<br>
art and include co-solvent systems comprising, for example, benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar<br>
surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer, and an aqueous phase. The co-solvent system<br>
may be the VPD co-solvent system. VPD is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of<br>
the nonpolar surfactant polysorbate 80, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to<br>
volume in absolute ethanol. The VPD co-solvent system (VPD:5W) consists of VPD diluted<br>
1:1 with a 5% dextrose in water solution. This co-solvent system is effective in dissolving<br>
hydrophobic compounds and produces low toxicity upon systemic administration. Naturally,<br>
the proportions of a co-solvent system may be varied considerably without destroying its<br>
solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components<br>
may be varied. For example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used instead of<br>
polysorbate 80, the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied, other biocompatible<br><br>
polymers may repiace polyethylene glycol, e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and other sugars or<br>
polysaccharides may substitute for dextrose.<br>
[0167] Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic molecules may be employed.<br>
Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for<br>
hydrophobic drugs. Liposomal delivery systems arc discussed above in the context of gene-<br>
delivery systems. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed,<br>
although usually at the cost of greater toxicity. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered<br>
using sustained-release systems, such as semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic<br>
polymers containing the effective amount of the composition to be administered. Various<br>
sustained-release materials are established and available to those of skill in the art. Sustained-<br>
release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few<br>
weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of<br>
the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed.<br>
[0168] For any composition used in the various treatments embodied herein, a therapeutically<br>
effective dose can be estimated initially using a variety of techniques well known in the art.<br>
For example, in a cell culture assay, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a<br>
circulating concentration range that includes the ICjo as determined in cell culture. Dosage<br>
ranges appropriate for human subjects can be determined, for example, using data obtained<br>
from cell culture assays and other animal studies.<br>
[0169] A therapeutically effective dose of a compound refers to that amount of the compound<br>
that results in amelioration of symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a subject. Toxicity<br>
and therapeutic efficacy of such molecules can be determined by standard pharmaceutical<br>
procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the LD50 (the dose<br>
lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the<br>
population). The dose ratio of toxic to therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which can<br>
be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are<br>
preferred.<br>
[0170] Dosages preferably fall within a range of circulating concentrations that includes the<br>
ED50 with little or no toxicity. Dosages may vary within this range depending upon the dosage<br>
form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of<br>
administration, and dosage should be chosen, according to methods known in the art, in view<br>
of the specifics of a subject's condition.<br>
[0171] Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of<br>
the active moiety that are sufficient to modulate a desired parameter, e.g., endogenous<br><br>
erythropoietin plasma levels, i.e. minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary<br>
for each compound but can be estimated from, for example, in vitro data. Dosages necessary<br>
to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration.<br>
Compounds or compositions thereof should be administered using a regimen which maintains<br>
plasma levels above the MEC for about 10-90% of the duration of treatment, preferably about<br>
30-90% of the duration of treatment, and most preferably between 50-90%. In cases of local<br>
administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be<br>
related to plasma concentration. Alternatively, modulation of a desired parameter, e.g.,<br>
stimulation of endogenous erythropoietin, may be achieved by 1) administering a loading dose<br>
followed by a maintenance dose, 2) administering an induction dose to rapidly achieve the<br>
desired parameter, e.g., erythropoietin levels, within a target range, followed by a lower<br>
maintenance dose to maintain, e.g., hematocrit, within a desired target range, or 3) repeated<br>
intermittent dosing.<br>
[0172] The amount of compound or composition administered will, of course, be dependent<br>
on a variety of factors, including the sex, age, and weight of the subject being treated, the<br>
severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, and the judgment of the prescribing<br>
physician.<br>
[0173] The present compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device<br>
containing one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. Such a pack or<br>
device may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or<br>
dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. Compositions<br>
comprising a compound of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier<br>
may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an<br>
indicated condition. Suitable conditions indicated on the label may include treatment of<br>
conditions, disorders, or diseases in which anemia is a major indication.<br>

ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein, and are specifically contemplated.<br>

dissolved in aqueous solution containing twice as much sodium hydroxide, mole-for-mole, as<br>
compound and dextrose as tonicity agent. Male Swiss Webster mice were dosed by tail vein<br>
injection with the compound, and blood samples were collected into EDTA and heparin 4<br>
hours post TV dosing. The samples were analyzed using a mouse erythropoietin<br>
QUANTIKJNE ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis MN) according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions. Compounds of the present invention showed measurable increase<br>
in plasma erythropoietin levels. Further, compounds containing the cyano substitution at C-1,<br>
as presently claimed, surprisingly produce higher, e.g., at least two times higher, plasma<br>
erythropoietin levels than a comparable compound containing a hydrogen, chloro, bromo, or<br>
methyl at C-1 position at a given dose. Table 1 below illustrates the fold difference (i.e., the<br>
level of improvement) between erythropoietin levels achieved by compounds of the invention<br>
compared to erythropoietin levels achieved by compounds having the same structure except the<br>
cyano group at the C-1 position is replaced as shown below, tested under the same conditions<br>
