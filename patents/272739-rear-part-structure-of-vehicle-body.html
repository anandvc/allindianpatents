				<td>This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-243145 filed September 19, 2007, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to a rear part structure of a vehicle body including a rear floor of a vehicle body, a floor side member which is coupled to one side of a lower surface of the rear floor in a width direction of a vehicle so as to extend in a longitudinal direction of a vehicle, and a wheel house inner panel of which a lower end portion is coupled to the floor side member.<br>
In the past, a related-art rear part structure of a vehicle body was configured such that a wheel inner panel portion on the side of a floor side member was formed just by one sheet of plate (see Patent Document 1).<br>
Patent Document 1:   Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003- 165468A<br>
According to the related-art rear part structure of the vehicle body described above, since the wheelhouse inner panel portion on the side of the floor side member is formed just by one sheet of plate, rigidity of the wheelhouse inner panel is not sufficient and rigidity of an overhang portion<br>
of the vehicle body which is disposed in the rear side of a rear suspension becomes weak. As a result, a problem arises in that unpleasant vibration or noise easily occurs. In addition, a problem arises in that road noise generated from a tire as a noise source is easily transmitted to the vehicle interior through the wheelhouse inner panel.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a rear part structure of a vehicle body capable of improving rigidity of the overhang portion of the vehicle body which is disposed in the rear side of the rear suspension to prevent unpleasant vibration or noise from occurring in the vehicle body and of preventing the road noise generated from a tire as a noise source from being transmitted through the wheelhouse inner panel to allow the vehicle interior to be silent.<br>
According to an aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a rear part structure of a vehicle body, comprising: a rear floor of a vehicle body, a floor side member coupled to one side of a lower surface of the rear floor in a width direction of a vehicle, the floor side member extending in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle; a wheelhouse inner panel including; a lower end portion which is coupled to the floor side member; a first vertical wall portion which extends upward from an outer end portion of the lower end portion in the width direction of the vehicle; a first horizontal wall portion which extends outward in the<br>
width direction of the vehicle from an upper end portion of the first vertical wall portion; and a second vertical wall portion which extends upward from an outer end portion of the first horizontal wall portion in the width direction of the vehicle, wherein the lower end portion of the wheelhouse inner panel, the first vertical wall portion, the first horizontal wall portion and the second vertical wall portion are extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle; wherein an auxiliary member panel is coupled to an outer surface of the wheel house inner panel in the width direction of the vehicle such that the auxiliary member panel, the first vertical wall portion and the first horizontal wall portion form a closed cross section.<br>
With such a configuration, since the auxiliary member panel which forms the closed cross section together with the first horizontal wall portion and the first vertical wall portion of the wheel house inner panel is coupled to the outer surface of the wheelhouse inner panel in the width direction of the vehicle, it is possible to strengthen rigidity of the wheel house inner panel.<br>
As a result, it is possible to strengthen rigidity of the overhang portion of the vehicle body which is disposed in the rear side of the rear suspension and thus to prevent unpleasant vibration or noise from occurring in the vehicle body.<br>
In addition, it is possible to prevent road noise generated from a tire as a noise source from being transmitted to the vehicle interior through the wheel house inner panel and thus to allow the vehicle interior to be silent.<br>
The rear part structure may further comprise: a rear skirt panel<br>
coupled to an rear end portion of the rear floor in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and formed into a vertical plate shape so as to partition a vehicle interior from a vehicle exterior; and a flange formed in an rear end portion of the auxiliary member panel in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and fixed and welded to the rear skirt panel in a state that the flange overlaps with the rear skirt panel from a front side of the vehicle. With such a configuration, it is possible to strongly position and fix the auxiliary member panel in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, and thus to further strengthen rigidity of the wheel house inner panel.<br>
The auxiliary member panel may include; a first opposed wall portion which is opposed to the first horizontal wall portion; a second opposed wall portion which is extends upward from an outer end portion of the first opposed wall portion in the width direction of the vehicle and is opposed to the first vertical wall portion; an upper bent portion bent outward from an upper end portion of the second opposed wall portion in the width direction of the vehicle; and a lower bent portion bent downward from an inner end portion of the first opposed wall portion in the width direction of the vehicle; the upper bent portion may be fixed and welded to the second vertical wall portion in a state that the upper bent portion overlaps with the second vertical wall portion from the outside in the width direction of the vehicle; and the lower bent portion may be fixed and welded to a lower end portion of the first vertical wall portion and a side wall of the floor side member in a state that the lower bent portion overlaps with the lower end portion and the side wall from the outside in the width direction of the vehicle.   With such a<br>
configuration, it is possible to simply form the closed cross section (auxiliary member) by the auxiliary member panel, the first vertical wall portion and the first horizontal wall portion and to more surely strengthen rigidity of the wheel house inner panel.<br>
The second opposed wall portion may be connected to an upper end portion of a shock absorber. With such a configuration, it is possible to dispose the upper end portion of the shock absorber above the rear floor. That is, since the height of the rear floor is not limited by the shock absorber, it is possible to lower the floor height of the rear floor and to broaden the vehicle interior.<br>
In addition, in the auxiliary member panel with the second opposed wall portion to which the upper end portion of the shock absorber is connected, since the lower bent portion is fixed and welded to the outer side wall of the floor side member having high rigidity in the width direction of the vehicle while overlapping with the outer side wall from the outside in the width direction of the vehicle, rigidity of the auxiliary member panel becomes strong, and thus it is possible to surely and stably receive a vertical force input from the shock absorber.<br>
A concave portion may be formed in the second opposed wall portion so as to be depressed inward in the width direction of the vehicle; a nut may be fixed and welded to a rear surface of a bottom wall of the concave portion and a first bolt insertion hole may be formed in the bottom wall of the concave portion to correspond to the nut; a bracket formed with a second bolt<br>
insertion hole may be fixed and welded to the second opposed wall portion on both sides of the concave portion in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle so as to be suspended on the concave portion; and an attachment bolt may be inserted through the first bolt insertion hole, a third bolt insertion hole which is formed in the upper end portion of the shock absorber, and the second bolt insertion hole so as to be threaded into the nut.<br>
With such a configuration, it is possible to support the upper end portion of the shock absorber through both the bottom wall of the concave portion of the second opposed wall portion and the bracket suspended on the second opposed wall portion on both sides of the concave portion. Accordingly, it is possible to stably support the shock absorber, and thus to improve traveling stability of the vehicle.<br>
Then, it is possible to simplify the support structure of the shock absorber and to easily attach the upper end portion of the shock absorber to the auxiliary member panel with the bracket and the second opposed wall portion.<br>
For instance, in a structure in which the nut is fixed to the rear surface (a surface on the vehicle interior) of the wheel house inner panel, a space of the vehicle interior become small due to the nut which is protruded to the vehicle interior, but in the above-described configuration according to the invention, since the nut is fixed and welded to the rear surface of the bottom wall of the concave portion of the second opposed wall portion, the nut does not protrude to the vehicle interior, and thus it is possible to broaden the space of the vehicle interior.<br>
The bracket may be formed into a flat plate shape and an upper end portion of the bracket may be fixed and welded to the second opposed wall portion above the concave portion. With such a configuration, it is possible to simplify the structure of the bracket and to more strongly fix the bracket to the auxiliary member panel with the second opposed wall portion.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to provide the rear part structure of the vehicle body capable of improving rigidity of the overhang portion of the vehicle body which is disposed in the rear side of the rear suspension to prevent unpleasant vibration or noise from occurring in the vehicle body and of preventing the road noise generated from a tire as a noise source from being transmitted through the wheelhouse inner panel to allow the vehicle interior to be silent.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, an exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A rear part structure of a vehicle body according to the invention has a configuration in which the left side and the right side are symmetric with each other, and a rear part structure of a vehicle body on the light side will be described in the embodiment.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 to 4, the rear part structure of the vehicle body is configured such that a pair of left and right floor side members 2 are respectively joined to left and right lower surfaces of the rear floor 1 of a vehicle body so as to extend in the longitudinal direction of a vehicle, and the lower end portion of a wheelhouse inner panel 3 is connected to each of the floor side members 2.<br>
The wheelhouse inner panel 3 includes a circular arc-shaped upper surface portion 4 which is disposed above a vehicle wheel, a front surface portion 5 which is disposed in the front side of the vehicle wheel, and a side surface portion 6 which extends downward from the end portion of the upper surface portion 4 on the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle. A plurality of reinforcing ribs 7 are formed in the upper surface portion 4 and<br>
the side surface portion 6 so as to extend in the vertical direction and in the width direction of the vehicle and to be sequentially formed therein to be away from each other with a predetermined interval therebetween in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Then, the lower end portion of the side surface portion 6 (the lower end portion of a first vertical wall portion 11 described below) is bent toward the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle, and a bent lower end portion 8 is fixed by welding to the lower surface of one side portion 9 of the rear floor 1 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle while overlapping with the lower surface thereof from the downside (see Figs. 3 and 4).<br>
The floor side member 2 is formed into a U-shape in a sectional view to be opened upward, a side wall 16 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle extends upward more than a side wall 15 on the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle, and then an extending upper end portion 10 is fixed by welding to the lower end portion of the side surface portion 6 while overlapping with the lower end portion thereof from the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle. The side wall 16 of the floor side member 2 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle is inclined so as to be positioned at a position on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle as it is closer to the upper end portion thereof (see Figs. 3 and 4).<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a spring receiver 27 which receives and supports a coil spring of a suspension from the upside is provided in a first lower wall portion 14A of the lower wall 14 of the floor side member 2, the first lower<br>
wall portion 14A being positioned below the center portion of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. The first lower wall portion 14A having the spring receiver 27 formed thereon is configured to have a large width so as to correspond to the diameter of the coil spring, but a second lower wall portion 14B which is disposed in the rear side of the vehicle with respect to the first lower wall portion 14A and a third lower wall portion 14C which is disposed in the front side Fr of the vehicle with respect to the first lower wall portion 14A are configured to have a width narrower than that of the first lower wall portion 14A<br>
An upper end portion 17 of the side wall 15 of the floor side member 2 on the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle is bent toward the inside D1 of the width direction of the vehicle, and is fixed by welding to the lower surface of the rear floor 1 while overlapping with the lower surface from the downside. That is, the floor side member 2, the rear floor 1, and the lower end portion 8 of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 which is bent toward the inside D1 of the width direction of the vehicle form a closed cross section. With such a structure, rigidity of the floor side member 2 and a peripheral portion thereof becomes strong, and thus rigidity of the rear floor 1 becomes strong.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 4, in the rear side of the vehicle with respect to the spring receiver 27, the first vertical wall portion 11 which erects from a coupling portion 20 connected to the floor side member 2, a first horizontal wall portion 21 which is bent from the upper end portion of the first vertical<br>
wall portion 11 toward the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle, and a second vertical wall portion 12 which erects from the end portion of the first horizontal wall portion 21 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle are formed in the side surface portion 6 of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 so as to extend in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. A connection portion 13 between the first vertical wall portion 11 and the first horizontal wall portion 21 is formed into a circular arc shape in a sectional view. In addition, the first vertical wall portion 11 erects in a perpendicular direction, and the second vertical wall portion 12 erects so as to be inclined upward and outward. The second vertical wall portion 12 is connected to the upper surface portion 4 of the wheelhouse inner panel 3.<br>
In addition, an auxiliary member panel 22 which forms a closed cross section together with the first vertical wall portion 11 and the first horizontal wall portion 21 of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 is fixed by welding to a surface of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle and the side wall 16 of the floor side member 2 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle, and thus the auxiliary member panel 22, the first vertical wall portion 11, and the first horizontal wall portion 21 form an auxiliary member 30 having a closed cross section.<br>
Specifically, the auxiliary member panel 22 includes a first opposed wall portion 31 which is opposed to the first horizontal wall portion 21 from the downside, a second opposed wall portion 32 which erects from the end portion of the first opposed wall portion 31 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle to be opposed to the first vertical wall portion 11, an<br>
upper bent portion 33 which is bent from the upper end portion of the second opposed wall portion 32 toward the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle, and a lower bent portion 34 which is bent downward from the end portion of the first opposed wall portion 31 on the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle.<br>
The upper bent portion 33 is fixed by welding to the second vertical wall portion 12 of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 while overlapping with the second vertical wall portion 12 from the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle. The lower bent portion 34 is fixed by welding to the lower end portion of the first vertical wall portion 11 and the upper portion of the side wall 16 of the floor side member 2 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle while overlapping with the lower end portion thereof and the upper portion thereof from the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle.<br>
That is, the lower bent portion 34 is fixed by welding to the upper end portion 10 in which the side wall 16 of the floor side member 2 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle extends and a side wall portion 16A below the extending upper end portion 10 while overlapping with the upper end portion 10 and the side wall portion 16A along the upper and lower joint portions between the rear floor 1 and the lower end portion 8 of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 from the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle. Accordingly, the second opposed wall portion 32 is opposed to the first vertical wall portion 11 from the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle,  and the first  opposed wall portion  31 is  opposed to the first<br>
horizontal wall portion 21 from the downside. Then, the auxiliary member 30 which is formed by the auxiliary member panel 22, the first vertical wall portion 11, and the first horizontal wall portion 21 so as to have a closed cross section extending in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle is formed above the floor side member 2 on the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle.<br>
By forming the auxiliary member 30 having a closed cross section, rigidity of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 becomes strong, and thus a closed cross section formed by the floor side member 2, the rear floor 1, and the lower end portion 8 of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 which is bent toward the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle may be small.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the end portion of the rear floor 1 on the rear side of the vehicle is joined to a rear skirt panel 19 with a vertical plate shape which partitions the vehicle interior from the vehicle exterior. The rear skirt panel 19 is fixed by welding to a flange 22F which is formed in the rear end portion of the auxiliary member panel 22 in a protruding manner while overlapping with the flange 22F from the front side Fr of the vehicle. That is, the rear end portion of the closed cross section of the auxiliary member 30 which is formed by the auxiliary member panel 22 is closed by the rear skirt panel 19, thereby improving rigidity thereof.<br>
In addition, the front end portion of the auxiliary member 30 is disposed at a position of the first lower wall portion 14A where the spring receiver 27 of the floor side member 2 is formed in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle.   That is, the auxiliary member panel 22 is disposed at the<br>
lower end portion of the first vertical wall portion 11 and the side wall 16 of the floor side member 2 corresponding to the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle by the second lower wall portion 14B which is disposed in the rear side of the vehicle with respect to the first lower wall portion 14A and has a width narrower than that of the first lower wall portion 14A, thereby forming the auxiliary member 30. Accordingly, it is possible to minimize the protruding amount in which the auxiliary member 30 protrudes to the inside of the wheelhouse and to strengthen the vehicle body in the rear side of the vehicle with respect to the spring receiver 27. At this time, the floor side member 2 is formed in the vehicle body in the rear side of the vehicle and the vehicle body is configured to have a narrow width.<br>
In addition, a concave portion 23 is formed in the auxiliary member panel 22 in such a manner that the second opposed wall portion 32 is depressed toward the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle so that an upper portion and a side portion are opened along the second opposed wall portion 32 and the first opposed wall portion 31. The concave portion 23 is formed into a longitudinal rectangular shape when viewed from the side. A nut N is fixed by welding to a rear surface of a bottom wall 35 corresponding to a surface of the concave portion 23 on the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle, and a first bolt insertion hole S1 is formed in the bottom wall 35 of the concave portion 23 in a concentric shape so as to correspond to the nut N. That is, the nut N is disposed in the closed cross section surrounded by the bottom wall 35, the first horizontal wall portion 21, and the first vertical wall portion 11 of the wheelhouse inner panel 3, and in<br>
the closed cross section of the auxiliary member 30, the bottom wall 35 on the inside Dl of the width direction of the vehicle is continuous before and after the concave portion 23.<br>
Then, one sheet of rectangular flat bracket 29 having a second bolt insertion hole S2 is suspended on a second opposed wall portion 32A on both sides of the concave portion in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Both end portions 29A of the bracket 29 which is positioned at both sides of the concave portion 23 (at both sides in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle) is fixed by welding to the second opposed wall portion 32A while overlapping with the second opposed wall portion 32A from the outside D2 of the width direction of the vehicle. An upper end portion 29B of the bracket 29 is fixed by welding to a second opposed wall portion 32B on the upper portion of the concave portion 23. That is, the upper end portion 29B of the bracket 29, the second upper opposed wall portion 32B, and the second vertical wall portion 12 of the side surface portion 6 of the wheelhouse inner panel 3 are formed into a single body while being fixed by welding to one another and overlapping with one another. Accordingly, it is possible to strengthen attachment strength in which the bracket 29 and the auxiliary member panel 22 are attached to the wheelhouse inner panel 3 and to strengthen the concave portion 23 of the auxiliary member panel 22, thereby improving rigidity of the auxiliary member 30.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 3, the concave portion 23 is configured as an attachment portion on the side of the vehicle body to which a shock<br>
absorber 50 of a rear suspension is attached. That is, the auxiliary member 30 is configured as an attachment portion to which the rear suspension is attached. At this time, an upper end portion 50J of the shock absorber 50 is inserted into the concave portion 23 so as to be disposed between the bracket 29 and the bottom wall 35 of the concave portion 23. Specifically, an attachment bolt 49 is inserted through the first bolt insertion hole S1 of the auxiliary member panel 22, a third bolt insertion hole S3 which is formed in the upper end portion 50J of the shock absorber 50 of the rear suspension, and the second bolt insertion hole S2 of the bracket 29 to thereby be screw-connected to the nut N, so that the upper end portion 50J of the shock absorber 50 is connected to the auxiliary member 30. As shown in Fig. 3, the upper end portion 50J of the shock absorber 50 is disposed between the bracket 29 and the bottom wall 35 of the concave portion 23 of the auxiliary member panel 22, and thus rigidity of the attachment is high because both sides of the upper end portion 50J are supported. Then, the upper end portion 50J of the shock absorber 50 can be disposed above the rear floor and the shock absorber 50 can be disposed in the rear side of the vehicle with respect to the spring receiver 27 of the floor side member 2 which is configured to have a narrow width. Accordingly, it is possible to minimize the protruding amount in which the shock absorber 50 protrudes to the inside of the wheelhouse. That is, since the height of the rear floor is not limited by the shock absorber, it is possible to lower the height of the rear floor and to broaden the vehicle interior.<br>
