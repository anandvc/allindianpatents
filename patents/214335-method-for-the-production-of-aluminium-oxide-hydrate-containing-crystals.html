				<td>The invention relates to a method for the production of aluminium hydrate containing crystals, aluminium hydrate containing crystals obtained by this- method, a composition containing an aluminium hydrate phase as well as the use of aluminium hydrate containing crystals and phases.<br>
The production of aluminium from bauxite today employs mainly the so-called Bayer method. For the recovery of aluminium with high purities in large scale operations it is desirable that the precursors for the aluminium production which originated from the Bayer method are also of high purity. The Bayer method uses naturally occurring raw material bauxites. These bauxities usually contain a number of impurities which, during the Bayer process, should be separated from the product to be processed to yield aluminium.<br>
Important products from which aluminium is produced are aluminium hydrates, preferably aluminium tridydrate. This aluminium trihydrate is not only a precursor for the aluminium production but for a number of products based on aluminium oxide.<br>
Besides the fact that the quality of the aforementioned products is impaired by these impurities, they also negatively affect the efficient processing of the aluminium hydrate crystals. For instance the crystal growth of aluminium hydrate crystals is impaired by the presence of oxalates to such an extent that only in the subsequent processing steps is it possible to obtain small sized crystals which even then can be processed only unsatisfactorily.<br>
EP 286 034 discloses a method of reducing the percentage rate of small size aluminium trydydrage crystals by adding to the pregnant liquor an effective amount of two mutually<br><br>
Soluble components (A) and (B), component (A) being a surfactant which will disperse component (B) in the pregnant liquor and component (B) being an oil.<br>
This method has disadvantages since it involves using a two-component system which must be premixed prior to being employed in the Bayer process.<br>
US 4,578,255 discloses a Bayer process, wherein the purity of the products obtained from the Bayer process is achieved by adding water-soluble, vinylic cationic polymer with quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
Also this method is in need of improvement in as far as a polymer is added in this process which must initially be synthesized from monomers at much cost and effort.<br>
WOJ39/30794 discloses a Bayer process, wherein the clarification, filtration and scale control of "red mud containing liquors is accomplished by emulsion polymers, in particular high molecular weight poly acrylates, in the presence of surfactants, which for instance can be Q-Cio linear or branched alkyl phenol ethoxylate.<br>
Besides the fact that, just as in the preceding disclosure, an auxiliary agent is also used in the instance, which must initially be polymerized from monomers, the processes concerned here are cleaning process on the red side" and not process step in the production of aluminium oxide hydrate containing crystals which are undertaken on the "white side" of the Bayer process.<br>
The object of the present invention in general is to overcome disadvantages arising from the prior art.<br>
A further task set for the invention is to provide aluminium oxide hydrate crystals of high purity.<br>
