METHOD FOR THE CATALYTIC PRODUCTION OF HYDROCODONE AND HYDROMORPHONE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S, Patent Application No. 10/495,503, filed November 5, 2003. U.S. Patent Application No. 10/495,503 claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/425,360 filed November 11, 2002. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the catalytic production of hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and analogs thereof, and more particularly to a method for catalytically converting codeine and morphine into hydrocodone and hydromorphone, respectively.<br>
Hydrocodone and hydromorphone are opioid analgesics having similar qualities to codeine and morphine. Conventional methods for producing hydrocodone and hydromorphone typically involve a two step oxidation/reduction route from codeine and morphine. Unfortunately, these methods are expensive and inefficient. Attempts to improve efficiency have included the use of catalytic methods. Known methods include the use of me tallies, typically Ru, Rh, Pd and Pt on activated carbon as well as metallic complexes. The preparation of these catalysts is difficult, yields are poor, and isolation of the product is often burdensome.<br>
Other catalytic methods, including the use of finely-divided platinum or palladium in an acidic media, are environmentally undesirable. Enzymatic methods of conversion have also been attempted, but as with the methods of catalysis discussed above, these methods are costly and difficult to scale up.<br>
There is therefore a need for an improved method of conversion that is easily scaled up and economical for manufacturing purposes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An aspect of the present invention is to provide a method for the catalytic conversion of a compound of Formula I into a compound of Formula II utilizing at least one transition metal complex as catalyst,<br><br><br>
wherein R1 is H, alky], aryl or acyl.<br>
la one aspect of the present invention the transition metal complex is of the formula [M(PR3R4R5)nXm]p; wherein M is a Group Vffl transition metal; R3, R4 and R5 are selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl, alkoxyl, phenoxyl and combinations thereof; X is a halide or an anion; n is 1,2, 3 or 4; m is 1 or 2; and p is at least 1.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a one step method for the conversion of codeine or morphine into hydrocodone or hydromorphone, respectively.<br>
These are merely illustrative aspects of the present invention and should not be deemed an all-inclusive listing of the innumerable aspects associated with the present invention. These and other aspects will become apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the following disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
There is provided a method for the conversion of a compound according to Formula I to a compound according to Formula II,<br><br><br>
wherein R1 is H, alkyl, aryl or acyl.<br>
The method of the present invention is especially useful where R1 is methyl or H, i.e., codeine or morphine, respectfully, leading to the formation of hydrocodone or hydromorphone, respectfully.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the transition metal catalysts of the present invention comprise a transition metal complex [M(PR3R4R5)nXm]p, wherein M is preferably a Group VIII transition metal; R , R and R are independently selected from alkyl, aryl, and alkoxyl, phenoxyl groups; X is a halide or an anion; n is 1, 2, 3 or 4; and m is 1 or 2. These complexes are capable of polymerizing, therefore p is at least 1. When all three of the R groups are alkoxyl, phenoxyl or combinations thereof, the ligand of the complex is termed a tertiary phosphite. If at least one of the R groups is not an alkoxyl or phenoxyl, then the ligand of the complex is termed a tertiary phosphine. Preferred metals include Rh, Ru, Pd and Pt. The halide, X, is typically CI or Br. Anions include but are not limited to BF4, PF6, C104, CH02, CF3C02, CF3S03) CH3CO2, ArC02, CH3SO3, p-tolylS03, HS04 and H2P04. R2 is an alkyl or aryl group, with phenyl being preferred. Many of these catalysts are commercially available, or are easily prepared as is known in the art.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the transition metal catalysts of the present invention comprise a transition metal complex of a tertiary phosphine halide, [M(PR23)nXm]p, wherein M is preferably a Group VIII transition metal; R2 is an alkyl or aryl; X is a halide or an anion; n is 1, 2, 3 or 4; and m is 1 or 2. These<br><br>
complexes are capable of polymerizing, therefore p is at least 1. Preferred metals include Rh, Ru, Pd and Pt. The halide, X, is typically CI or Br. Anions include but are not limited to BF4, PF6, C104, CH02, CF3C02, CF3S03, CH3C02, ArC02, CH3SO3, p-tolylS03, HSO4 and H2P04. R2 is an alkyi or aryl group, with phenyl being preferred. Many of these catalysts are commercially available, or are easily prepared as is known in the art. It is noted that the catalysts of the formula [M(PR 3)nXm]p are a subgroup of the broader group of catalysts [M(PR3R4R5)nXm]p.<br>
The complexes of the present invention maybe comprised of solid supported tertiary phosphines/phosphites, including but not limited to polymer supported tertiary phosphines/phosphites, silical supported tertiary phosphines/phosphites and resin-bound tertiary phosphines/phosphites. In the case of solid supported tertiary phosphines/phosphites, one of the R groups typically contains a linking group connecting a phosphine/phosphite and a solid phase, as is well known in the art, A non-limiting example of a solid supported tertiary phosphine useful in the present invention is the copolymer prepared from the monomer p-styryldiphenylphosphine also known as diphenyl(p-vinylphenyl)phosphine with styrene or silical supported tertiary, phosphines made from treating silica with (EtO)3SiCH2CH2PPh2. There are solid supported tertiary phosphines/phosphites that are commercially available.<br>
In Formula I and Formula II, alkyi groups useful therein typically include those having from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. Aryl groups in Formula I and Formula II include phenyl and substituted phenyl groups.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the metal is Rh and the complex is of the formula [Rh(PR3R4R5)nXm]p; wherein R3, R4 and R5 are selected from the group consisting of alkyi, aryl, alkoxyl, phenoxyl and combinations thereof; X is a halide or an anion; n is 1,2,3 or 4; m is 1 or 2; and p is at least 1.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the transition metal is Rh, and the metal complex is of the formula [Rh(PR23)nX]p, wherein R2 is an alkyi or aryl, X is a halide, n is 1,2 or 3, and p is at least 1, or of the formula [Rh(PR23 )nY] p, wherein R2 is an alkyi or aryl, n is 1,2 or 3, p is at least 1 and Y is an anion, preferably including BF4, PF6, CIO4, CH02, CF3C02, CF3SO3, CH3CO2, ArC02, CH3SO3, p-tolylS03, HS04 or H2PO4.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the transition metal is Ru and the metal complex is of the formula [Ru(PR3R4R5)nXm]p; wherein R3, R4 and R5 are selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl, alkoxyl, phenoxyl and combinations thereof; X is a halide or an anion; n is 1,2, 3 or 4; m is 1 or 2; and p is at least 1.<br>
In another embodiment the transition metal is Ru and the metal complex is of the formula [RuX2(PR23 )n] P wherein R is an alkyl or aryl, X is a halide, n is 1,2, 3 or 4; and p is at least 1 or of the formula [RuYX(PR23)n] p wherein R” is an alkyl or aryl and wherein n=3, p is at least 1, Y=H and X=C1; n=3, Y=H and X=H; n=4, X=H, Y=H; or n=2, 3 or 4, p is at least 1 and X=Y=C104, CF3S03, PF6 or BF4, CH02, CH3C02, ArC02) CH3S03, p-tolylS03, HS04 or H2P04.<br>
A suitable method for producing an illustrative Ru complex of the present invention involves refluxing a Ru salt, for example RuCl3xH20 with an excess of triphenylphosphine in alcohol to form the complex [Ru(P(C6H5)3)3Cl2]p.<br>
An illustrative Rh complex of the present invention is also commercially available, or can be prepared by refluxing rhodium trichloride with triphenylphosphine in alcohol, typically methanol or ethanol.<br>
In another illustrative embodiment of the present invention the Rh-, Ru-, and/or Ir-complex can be bound to a tertiary copolymer of styrene, divinylbenzene, and diphenyl(p-vinylphenyI)phosphine also known as p-styryldiphenylphosphine, illustrated in Formula IQ:<br><br>
Optionally, other monomers may be substituted or added to optimize certain physical properties of the overall polymeric catalyst. Illustrative examples include but are not limited to, ethylene dimethacrylate, p-bromostyrene, and crosslinking agents such as divinylbenzene, butadiene, diallyl maleate, diallyl phthalate, glycol dimethacrylate, and other di- or triolefins. Other phosphine containing monomers bound to the styrene ring can have, in addition to diaryl substitutions, dialkyl, branched<br><br>
and cyclic dialkyl, dialkoxyl or mixed substitutions or these. Illustrative examples utilizing styrene are shown in Formulas IV and V.<br><br>
The polymeric complex makes up a composition of matter consisting essentially of an intrinsically porous solid organic styrene-divinyl benzene copolymer; a substituent phosphine group chemically bonded through phosphorus to a carbon atom of said polymer; and a Group VIII metal chemically bonded to said substituent phosphine which composition is substantially insoluble in the solvent(s).<br>
In an illustrative embodiment the polymeric support is composed of a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer containing 2 to 20 mole percent divinylbenzene, in which 0.5 to 7 mole percent, preferably 5 to 6 mole percent of the pendant phenyl groups from the copolymerized styrene contain the diphenylphosphine moiety at the para position. The composition of the polymer support is 75 to 97.6 mole percent styrene, 2 to 20 percent divinylbenzene and 0.4 to 6 percent p-diphenylphosphenostyrene.<br>
As to the amount of ruthenium complex in the catalyst, typically the Ru/pendant atom ratio is preferably at least 0.001 and is more preferably about 0.5 to an upper limit set by the point at which the polymer support will no longer take up complex, for example about 1.2.<br>
The polymeric complex may be made by contacting a solution of the Group VIII metal salt complex in solution with the polymer support. For practical application, the metal complex is dissolved in a suitable solvent including but not limited to water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, isobutyl alcohol, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide and mixtures thereof. The Group VIII metal complex solution should be at least 10-6 M in the ruthenium complex but is preferably about 10”3 M in the ruthenium complex.<br>
In this illustrative embodiment, the polymer portion of the catalyst is intrinsically porous. Porosity of the polymer portion of the catalyst imparts increased activity to the catalyst With catalysts having an organic polymer portion which is not<br><br>
intrinsically porous, porosity may be induced into the polymer portion by solvent swelling. Combinations of the above-noted solvents can be manipulated to produce various degrees of swelling of the polymer portion of the catalyst, as is well known in the art.<br>
The catalytic conversion of the present invention has the further economic advantage of being able to convert a salt of codeine or morphine, for example codeine hydrochloride or morphine hydrochloride, to hydrocodone or hydromorphone, respectively.<br>
Further, the catalysts of the present invention facilitate high value metal recovery of the metal containing solid catalyst. When recovered by conventional methods known in the art, the metal of the present catalyst results in an improved recovery percentage. This further reduces material and labor costs, as well as simplifying processing/workup. For purposes herein, the term recovery is meant to encompass recovery, recycling and/or regeneration of the metal.<br>
In the embodiments wherein the catalyst is on a fixed support, the catalyst/support can be placed in a column or container as part of a loop reactor. In a non-limiting illustrative example codeine in alcohol that is heated in a reactor can be pumped or gravity fed through a catalyst bed and cycled back to the reactor until the desired conversion to hydrocodone is produced. The advantages of this method include that many cycles (perhaps several batches) of product may be obtained with a given bed. The catalyst value is then easily recovered and sent back for reprocessing. The purification workup is simplified because the catalyst is not present in the solution. For practical reasons, the concentration of Group VIE metals must be below about 10 ppm in the product. On cooling, the product would crystallize out of solution in high purity, to be recovered by filtration or centrifugation.<br>
Many process designs, as are well known in the art, could be utilized with the process of the present invention.<br>
The reaction of the present invention may be accomplished by any conventional process. A suitable process includes dissolving the reactant of Formula I in a suitable solvent in a reaction vessel. Suitable solvents include but are not limited to alcohols, preferably primary and secondary lower alkyl alcohols. The reaction vessel is then<br><br>
flushed with an inert atmosphere, typically nitrogen. The catalyst is added and the reaction mixture is refluxed under the inert atmosphere until the conversion is essentially complete, typically at least about an hour. The reaction mixture is cooled and crystals of the product are collected. The product may be purified by recrystallization in a suitable solvent as is well known in the art, or by any other suitable conventional method of purification.<br>
In an alternative embodiment a tertiary amine, for example triethylamine, is added to the reaction mixture when the preferred Ru complex catalyst is used. The tertiary amine reduces the formation of side products, primarily the alkaloid neopine, a potential side product in reactions of the present invention utilizing the preferred Ru catalyst.<br>
In another alternative embodiment the alkaloid compound is added to the reactants that form the catalyst and the catalyst formation reaction takes place in the presence of the alkaloid. The ability to form the catalyst and subsequently accomplish the catalytic conversion in the same reaction vessel further enhances the economy of the reaction.<br>
Examples Example 1<br>
Codeine, 50.00 g, was dissolved in 200 ml methanol in a three-neck flask at room temperature. The flask was equipped with a condenser and nitrogen. The flask was flushed with nitrogen for five minutes with one neck opened. The catalyst, 0.50g of RhCl(P (C6H5)3)3 was added to the solution. The flask was then flushed with nitrogen for another five minutes, and the open neck was closed. The reaction mixture was stirred under nitrogen and heated to reflux for four hours, then cooled to 0°C for 30 minutes. The resulting crystals were removed by filtration. The collected crystals were washed four times with 10ml cold methanol (5 °C), and dried in air for one hour yielding pale yellow crystals (41.50 g, yield 83%). The filtrate was pumped down to dryness to give 6.14 g yellow solid. The solid residue was dissolved in 40 ml refluxing methanol and cooled to 0°C for 30 minutes and filtered. The collected crystals were washed four times with 3 ml portions of cold methanol (5°C) and air dried for 2 hours<br><br>
yielding 3.41 g (6.8%) white crystals. HPLC analysis and NMR spectra confirm that the product is pure hydrocodone.<br>
Example 2<br>
Morphine, 50.00 g, was suspended in 500 ml methanol in a three neck flask equipped with condenser and nitrogen input and outlet. After refluxing under nitrogen for five minutes, one neck of the flask was opened. A catalyst, 0.50g RhCl(P(C6H5)3)3 was added to the container. The opened neck was closed with a stopper. The reaction mixture was stirred under nitrogen and heated to reflux for 6 hours, cooled down to 0°C for 30 minutes, and filtered. The collected solid was washed four times with cold methanol (5°C) and dried in air for 20 minutes. The solid was kept under vacuum (15 mm Hg) at room temperature for 1 hour, yielding a white powder (38.83 g, yield 77.7%). The filtrate was distilled under nitrogen until only 200 ml of solution remained. It was cooled down to 0°C for 30 minutes and filtered, yielding a white powder. The product was washed twice with 20 ml each and then once with 10ml of cold methanol (5°C) dried in air for 40 minutes to yield 3.48 g of a white powder product. HPLC analysis and NMR spectra confirm product is pure hydromorphone.<br>

The reaction mixture was flushed with N2 for 3 minutes, after which 0.25 ml triethylamine was added, and the mixture flushed with N2 for another 3 minutes. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux with stirring under N2 for 72 hours. The resulting solid was found to be hydromorphone.<br><br>
Example 7<br>
Codeine, 5.09 g, 25.4 mg RuCI3xH20 and 95.9 mg P(C6H5)3 were added to 25 ml ethanol in a three neck flask. The flask was flushed with N2 for 5 minutes. The mixture was heated until reactants dissolved, and then refluxed, under nitrogen, overnight. The resulting solution was washed twice with 5 ml each MeOH and air dried to yield 3.31 g product. Analysis determined the presence of hydrocodone and Ru catalyst.<br>
Example 8<br>

Example 9<br>
Ru Polymer Catalyst Conversion to Hydrocodone: Codeine, 50.00 g, is added to 200 ml methanol contained in a three necked flask equipped with condenser and nitrogen input and outlet. The mixture is taken to reflux under nitrogen. A polymer phosphine anchored Ru catalyst, 5 g (1 mole % Ru) is added to the container. The reaction mixture is stirred under nitrogen at reflux for several hours. An additional 800 ml of methanol is added and heating is continued for 30 minutes. The polymer catalyst is recovered for recycle by filtration of the hot liquor. About 800 ml of methanol is removed from the filtrate by distillation. The liquor is then cooled to 0°C and maintained at that temperature for at least about 30 minutes. The product is collected by filtration, washed four times with cold methanol (5°C) and air dried. The product is placed under vacuum (75% yield. The purity and identity of the hydrocodone is confirmed by HPLC, H1 and C13 NMR and MS analyses.<br>
