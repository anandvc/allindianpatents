THE PATENT ACT 1970     [39 OF 1970]     <br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
"PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF POLYHALOGENATED CINNAMIC ACIDS AND CINNAMIC ACID DERIVATIVES OF FORMULA (III)"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany<br>
GRANTED<br>
26-7-2007<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to new polyhalogen-substituted cinnamic acids and cinnamic acid derivatives and a process for the preparation of known and new poly-halogenrsubstituted cinnamic acids and cinnamic acid derivatives.<br>
Known halogen-substituted cinnamic   acids  and cinnamic  acid  derivatives  are intermediates   for  the  production  of  agrochemicals   and  pharmaceuticals   (see DE-A2244 761, WO 95/30645, WO 94/26692, WO 94/7893, WO 94/26693 and US-A 5 753 655).<br>
2,4-Difluorocinnamic acid and its esters of the formula (II) can be prepared by reacting benzyl halides of the formula (I) with acetic anhydride or benzaldehydes of the formula (I) with malonic acid or malonic acid esters.<br>
The following reaction equation illustrates this:<br><br>
A = OH or O-alkyl.<br>
A disadvantage here is the high reaction temperature needed, the unsatisfactory yield and the difficult accessibility of the compounds of the formula (T). Monatshefte der Chemie 90, 680 (1959) describes the reaction of 2,4-difluorobenzaldehyde with<br><br><br>
acetic anhydride at 180°C, 2,4-difluorocinnamic acid being obtained in 77% yield.<br>
IQ  another  route  for the preparation  of a halogen-substituted cinnamic  acid derivative, 2,4-difluoro-bromobenzene is used as a starting material and this is reacted with acrylic acid with addition of triphenylphosphinepalladium dichloride and potassium carbonate in dimethylformamide at 145 to 150°C in the course of 6 hours. The corresponding cinnamic acid derivative is obtained in a yield of only 54%   (Russ. J. Org. Chem. 33 (4), 563-569 (1997)). The yield is still unsatisfactory here and high reaction temperatures and long reaction times are also needed.<br>
Finally,   it   is   known   from   EP-A-584 043    that   compounds   of   the   type Ar-CHRa-CHRbRc can be prepared if diazonium salts of the type AR-N2® are reacted with compounds of the type CRa=CRbRc with formation of compounds of the type Ar-CHRa=CRbRc and the reaction is carried out in the presence of homogeneous palladium catalysts and with addition of 1 to 10 equivalents of base. This process is particularly suitable for the preparation of compounds in which the Ar radical is substituted by a sulphonic acid group, i.e. a strongly polar group. In addition to this restriction, it is disadvantageous that in this process large amounts of bases have to be added, which means additional costs and makes necessary a complicated work-up of the reaction mixture. .<br>
EP-A-584 264 describes a similar process to that of .EP-A-584 043. However, the reaction is carried out in the additional presence of arylphosphanes, which is associated with further costs and further additional outlay.<br>
There is thus still the need for a process for the preparation of polyhalogenated cinnamic acids and cinnamic acid derivatives in which, in a simple manner, at moderate temperatures, with short reaction times, without addition of base and without necessary addition of arylphosphanes, the desired products are accessible in a higher yield than hitherto.<br><br>
Le A 34 067-DEQ2<br><br>
A process for the preparation of polyhalogenated cinnamic acids and cinnamic acid derivatives of the formula (HI) has now been found<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are identical or different and in each case represent hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine, at least two of these radicals being other than hydrogen and<br>
X        represents OR-5 or N(R6)(R7), where<br>
R5       represents hydrogen, optionally substituted C1-C10-alkyl, optionally substituted phenyl or benzyl and<br>
R6 and R7 are identical or different and in each case represent optionally substituted C1-C10-alkyl and<br>
R8       represents hydrogen, chlorine, bromine or optionally substituted C1-C10-alkyl,<br>
which is characterized in that a diazonium salt of the formula (IV)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the meaning indicated in formula (HI) and<br>
A® represents an equivalent of halide, hydrogensulphate, nitrate, acetate or tetra-fluoroborate ions or xh an equivalent of sulphate ions or 1/3 an equivalent of phosphate ions,<br><br>
is reacted with acrylic acid or an acrylic acid derivative of the formula (V)<br>
in which<br>
X        has the meaning indicated in formula (HI) and<br>
R8       represents hydrogen, chlorine, bromine or optionally substituted C1-C10-alkyl,<br>
in the presence of a homogeneous, palladium-containing catalyst at -5 to +100°C.<br>
The process according to the invention is most preferably carried out without addition of base. The amount of base which can be added per mol of diazonium salt of the formula (IV) is generally 0.5 mol or less, preferably 0.1 mol or less and more preferably 0.05 mol.<br>
Advantageously and most preferably, the process according to the invention is carried out without addition of arylphosphanes. The amount of arylphosphanes which can be added per mol of palladium is generally 4 mol or less, preferably 1 mol or less and more preferably 0.1 mol or less.<br><br><br>
Lc A 34 067-DEQ2<br><br><br><br><br><br>
If the radicals R5, R6, R7 and R8 are optionally substituted alkyl radicals, suitable substituents can be, for example, halogen, hydroxyl or C6-C12-aryl radicals. 1 or 2 of these substituents can be present, for example, per radical selected from the group consisting of R5, R6, R7 and R8.<br>
Preferably, R1 represents hydrogen or chlorine, R2 represents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine, R3 represents hydrogen or chlorine and R4 represents fluorine or chlorine, at least one of the radicals R1, R2 and R3 being other than hydrogen.<br>
R5 preferably represents hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or benzyl. R6 and R7 preferably represent methyl or ethyl. R8 preferably represents hydrogen or methyl. A® preferably represents an equivalent of chloride, hydrogensulphate or acetate or 1/2 an equivalent of sulphate.<br>
Suitable homogeneous, palladium-containing catalysts are, for example, palladium(II) and palladium(O) compounds such as PdCl2, PdBr2, Pd(N03)2, H2PdCl4, Pd(CH3COO)2, Na2PdCl4, K2PdCl4, Pd(H) acetylacetonate, tetra-(triphenylphosphine)Pd and tris-(dibenzylideneacetone)Pd2. PdCl2, Pd(CH3COO)2 and Pd(II) acetylacetonate are preferred.<br>
The respective palladium-containing catalyst can be employed, for example, in an amount from 0.001 to 10 mol%, preferably based on the diazonium salt of the formula (IV).<br>
Preferred reaction temperatures are those from +20 to +80°C, in particular those from +40 to +65°C.<br>
The process according to the invention can optionally be carried out with the addition of simple solvents. Useful simple solvents include for example water, alcohols such as for example C1-C6~alkyl alcohols, carboxylic acids such as for example formic acid, ethers such as for example tetrahydrofuran and nitriles, such as for example<br><br><br><br>
Le A 34 067-DE02<br>
acetonitrile.<br>
The diazonium salts of the formula (IV) can be prepared in a manner known per se (see, for example, Houben-Weyl, Volume X/3, pages 7 to 113) from the corresponding anilines by reaction with sodium nitrite in acidic aqueous solution or by reaction of methyl nitrite in acidic methanol. The diazonium salts can be employed in the process according to the invention in the form of the reaction mixture obtained during their preparation, preferably after the destruction of nitrite which may still be present. Isolation of the diazonium salts is not necessary.<br>
Preferred compounds of the formula (V) are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acryl-amide and methacrylamide.<br>
Based on 1 mol of diazonium salt of the formula (IV), it is possible to employ, for example, 0.5 to 2 mol of acrylic acid or acrylic acid derivatives of the formula (V). This amount is preferably 0.9 to 1.5 mol.<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out so that, for example, firstly an aniline of the formula<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the meaning indicated in formula (HI),<br>
is converted with sodium nitrite in aqueous sulphuric acid solution or with an alkyl nitrite such as methyl, ethyl, butyl or amyl nitrite, preferably methyl nitrite, in acidic,<br><br><br><br>
Le A 34 067-DE02<br><br>
e.g. sulphuric acid-containing methanol, into a diazonium salt of the formula (IV), nitrite which may be present in the reaction mixture obtained is destroyed by addition of amidosulphonic acid, the reaction mixture treated in this way is added dropwise at reaction temperature to a mixture of acrylic acid or an acrylic acid derivative of the formula (V) with a homogeneous, palladium-containing catalyst and optionally a simple solvent such as water, methanol, ethanol or isopropanol and optionally after a stirring time the prepared product of the formula (HI), if appropriate after cooling and/or dilution with water, is separated off, e.g. by filtration, distillation or phase separation.<br>
The process according to the invention has the advantages that it produces polyhalogen-substituted cinnamic acids and cinnamic acid derivatives in high yields in a simple manner, at low temperatures, in short reaction times, without large amounts and preferably without additions of bases, without large amounts and preferably without absolutely necessary additions of arylphosphanes. Moreover, no special solvents such as amide solvents, e.g. dimethylformamide, are needed.<br>
The present invention further relates to new polyhalogenated cinnamic acids and cinnamic acid derivatives of the formula<br><br><br>
(III"),<br><br>
in which<br>
R2"      represents chlorine and R4" represents fluorine or R2"      represents fluorine and R4" represents chlorine.<br><br><br>
Le A 34 067-DE02<br><br>
One possibility of preparation of the new compounds of the formula (IIT) has been described above. Their utility is illustrated below.<br>
The polyhalogenated cinnamic acids and cinnamic acid derivatives of the formula (HI) including those of the formula (AT) can be converted by hydrogenation of the double bond (1st step) and subsequent cyclization (2nd step) into indanone derivatives of the formula<br><br>
in which<br><br><br><br>
R1 to R4 have the meaning indicated in formula (HI) and<br>
R8       represents hydrogen, bromine, chlorine or optionally substituted C1-C10-alkyl.<br>
Compounds of the general formula (VIla) in which R8 represents hydrogen can be converted in a manner known per se by halogenation into the corresponding compounds of the general formula (VIla) in which R8 represents bromine or chlorine.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the general formula (VIla) in which R8 represents bromine or chlorine can be converted in a manner known per se, for example by palladium-catalysed carbonylation reactions with carbon monoxide and a suitable nucleophile, into indanone derivatives of the formula (VIIb)<br><br><br>
Le A 34 067-DE02<br><br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
R1 to R4 have the meaning indicated in formula (HI) and<br>
R9       represents COOH, CONH2 or COOR10, where<br><br><br><br>
R10     denotes C1-C4-alkyl.<br>
The 1st step can be carried out, for example, by hydrogenating with hydrogen in the presence of platinum or palladium, if appropriate at elevated pressure, and the 2nd step can be carried out, for example, by converting the arylproprionic acids obtained into the corresponding acid chlorides and cyclizing these with the aid of Friedel-Crafts catalysts to give the indanones of the general formula (VIla).<br>
From these indanones and those of the formula (VIIb), agrochemical and pharmaceutical active compounds and liquid-crystalline materials are accessible analogously to known processes (see, for example, WO 95/29171, EP-A 538 134, EP-A 401 166 and JP-A 06-263 663).<br><br>
The new compounds of the formula (HI") widen the range of the indanones available and thus to prepare and to test potential active compounds in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical field and also in the field of liquid-crystalline substances.<br><br><br>
