				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
MAINTENANCE HISTORY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR<br>
CONSTRUCTION MACHINE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a construction<br>
machine maintenance history information management system<br>
that is suitable for managing the maintenance history<br>
information about hydraulic excavators and other<br>
construction machines.<br>
Background Art<br>
When a hydraulic excavator or other construction<br>
machine was to be inspected in the past, a worker, who<br>
belonged, for instance, to a construction machine<br>
manufacturer or servicing company, visited a work site with<br>
having a maintenance form (checklist) and wrote maintenance<br>
results into the maintenance form. Then, the worker brought<br>
the maintenance form back and typed the maintenance results<br>
by use of a terminal to enter them into a management server.<br>
The maintenance result input process was not efficiently<br>
performed because it took a lot of trouble to write the<br>
maintenance results into the maintenance form and to type<br>
them by use of the terminal. To solve such a problem, a<br>
maintenance information transmission/reception system is<br>
proposed, for instance, by Patent Document 1. This<br>
maintenance information transmission/reception system<br>
1<br>
 <br>
includes a cellular phone, which allows the user to enter,<br>
for instance, hydraulic excavator maintenance results and<br>
transmit the entered information, and a management server,<br>
which is installed, for instance, at a manufacturer's<br>
facility or at a servicing company to transmit information<br>
to and receive information from the cellular phone.<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A-2002-325060<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
For example, a large-size hydraulic excavator for use<br>
in soil/stone excavation at a large work site is generally<br>
operated continuously for productivity improvement purposes.<br>
If, for instance, an abnormality occurs in the hydraulic<br>
excavator, it is necessary to stop its operation for a long<br>
period of time and to change the execution of a production<br>
plan depending on the severity of the abnormality. A known<br>
technology for handling such a situation is used to furnish<br>
the hydraulic excavator, for instance, with a plurality of<br>
sensors and a data control device that processes and stores<br>
detected data fed from the sensors. With the known<br>
technology, fault diagnostics can be performed by<br>
referencing the detected data stored in the data control<br>
device, and the hydraulic excavator downtime can be reduced.<br>
Further, some hydraulic excavator faults and abnormalities<br>
are detected only through visual inspection, and it is<br>
desired that such faults and abnormalities be detected<br>
before the hydraulic excavator malfunctions. For such a<br>
2<br>
 <br>
reason, hydraulic excavator maintenance is regarded as<br>
important, and the number of maintenance items and the<br>
frequency of maintenance have relatively increased.<br>
Furthermore, fault diagnostics can be performed in<br>
accordance with the temporal relationship between<br>
maintenance history data and the data detected from an<br>
abnormal hydraulic excavator. More specifically, if, for<br>
instance, an overheat or other similar abnormality is<br>
encountered in a situation where the normality of a radiator<br>
is indicated by the maintenance history data obtained from a<br>
radiator maintenance performed immediately before the<br>
occurrence of such an abnormality, it can be judged that the<br>
abnormality is highly attributable to a device other than<br>
the radiator. Fault diagnostics can then be performed by<br>
referencing the detected data related to devices other than<br>
the radiator. Consequently, fault diagnostics can be<br>
carried out more rapidly with increased precision.<br>
However, the above-mentioned conventional technology<br>
does not propose a definite method for acquiring temporal<br>
information about the maintenance history data. Therefore,<br>
there is room for improvement. If, for instance, the date<br>
and time of the hydraulic excavator disagrees with the date<br>
and time of the cellular phone for some reason in a<br>
situation where the maintenance history data is generated<br>
with reference to the date and time of the cellular phone,<br>
it may be impossible to accurately determine the temporal<br>
relationship between the maintenance history data and the<br>
occurrence of a hydraulic excavator abnormality. Further,<br>
3<br>
 <br>
if the maintenance history data is generated, for instance,<br>
by entering the operating time indicated by an indicator on<br>
the hydraulic excavator, it is probable that incorrect data<br>
may be entered and that the entered data may vary from one<br>
person to another. This again may make it impossible to<br>
accurately determine the temporal relationship between the<br>
maintenance history data and the occurrence of a hydraulic<br>
excavator abnormality.<br>
A first object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a construction machine maintenance history information<br>
management system that is capable of enhancing the<br>
reliability of temporal information about maintenance<br>
history data.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a construction machine history information<br>
management system for generating maintenance history data<br>
that can be used to accurately determine the temporal<br>
relationship between the maintenance history data and the<br>
occurrence of a construction machine abnormality.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
(1) In accomplishing the above objects, according to<br>
one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
maintenance history information management system for a<br>
construction machine, comprising: a data control device<br>
being incorporated to process operating time or date and<br>
time; and a mobile terminal including control means for<br>
displaying construction machine maintenance items on display<br>
means, input means for enabling a worker to enter data for<br>
4<br>
 <br>
the maintenance items displayed on the display means, and<br>
storage means for storing the data entered through the input<br>
means as maintenance history data; wherein the mobile<br>
terminal inputs the operating time or date and time from the<br>
data control device via first communication means and stores<br>
the maintenance history data in the storage means in<br>
association with the input operating time or date and time.<br>
In the present invention, the construction machine<br>
includes the data control device that processes the<br>
operating time or date and time. When, for instance, the<br>
construction machine is to be inspected, the mobile terminal<br>
is communication-connected to the data control device via<br>
the first communication means so that the data control<br>
device inputs the operating time or date and time into the<br>
mobile terminal. When the worker uses the input means to<br>
enter data (e.g., the data about maintenance execution,<br>
maintenance results, countermeasure, or<br>
replenishment/replacement amount of oil or the like) for the<br>
maintenance items displayed on the display means of the<br>
mobile terminal, the entered data is handled as the<br>
maintenance history data, associated with the construction<br>
machine operating time or date and time, and stored in the<br>
storage means. The worker displays the maintenance history<br>
data stored in the storage means of the mobile terminal, for<br>
instance, on the display means, or outputs it to a<br>
management server via second communication means.<br>
In the present invention, the mobile terminal can<br>
acquire temporal information, such as the operating time or<br>
5<br>
 <br>
date and time, from the data control device of the<br>
construction machine and store the acquired temporal<br>
information about the construction machine in association<br>
with the maintenance history data, as described above. As a<br>
result, the reliability of the temporal information about<br>
the maintenance history data is higher than when, for<br>
instance, the temporal information is manually entered into<br>
the mobile terminal. Further, since the construction<br>
machine's temporal information is used as the reference, the<br>
temporal relationship between the maintenance history data<br>
and the occurrence of a construction machine abnormality can<br>
be determined with increased precision. This makes it<br>
possible to perform fault diagnostics more rapidly with<br>
increased accuracy.<br>

circumference of the swing wheel 12. The swing hydraulic<br>
motor is driven so that the swing body 4 swings relative to<br>
the track body 3.<br>
The front operating mechanism 5 is, for instance, of<br>
a loader type. It comprises a boom 13 turnably mounted on<br>
the swing body 3, an arm 14 turnably mounted on the leading<br>
end of the boom 13, and a bucket 15 turnably mounted on the<br>
leading end of the arm 14. The boom 13, arm 14, and bucket<br>
15 are operated respectively by telescopic motions of boom<br>
hydraulic cylinders 16, arm hydraulic cylinders 17, and<br>
bucket hydraulic cylinders 18.<br>
The housings 6A, 6B house engines 19, radiators 20<br>
16<br>
 <br>
positioned behind the engines 19, and hydraulic pumps 21<br>
positioned in front of the engines 19. The hydraulic pumps<br>
21 are driven by the engines 19 to supply hydraulic oil to a<br>
plurality of hydraulic actuators (e.g., the aforementioned<br>
track hydraulic motors, swing hydraulic motor, boom<br>
hydraulic cylinders 16, arm hydraulic cylinders 17, and<br>
bucket hydraulic cylinders 18).<br>
A fuel tank 22 for storing fuel for the engines 19<br>
and a hydraulic oil tank 23 for storing hydraulic oil for<br>
the hydraulic pumps 21 are positioned between the housings<br>
6A, 6B. A plurality of control valves 24 are positioned in<br>
front of the hydraulic oil tank 23 to control the hydraulic<br>
oil flow from the hydraulic pumps 21 to the aforementioned<br>
hydraulic actuators in accordance with the operation of<br>
control levers (not shown) in the cab 7. oil coolers 25 for<br>
and a lubricator (not shown) are positioned in front area of<br>
the right-side housing 6B. The oil coolers 25 cool the<br>
fluid that returns from the hydraulic actuators. The<br>
lubricator supplies lubricating oil, for instance, to the<br>
swing wheel 12 and the movable sections of the front<br>
operating mechanism 5.<br>
In the hydraulic excavator 1 configured as described<br>
above, there is mounted a controller network 26 for<br>
collecting operation data, which is the data about the<br>
operating status of each maintenance target. Fig. 3 is a<br>
schematic diagram that illustrates the configuration of the<br>
controller network 26 while depicting one embodiment of the<br>
construction machine maintenance history information<br>
17<br>
 <br>
management system according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3 and Fig. 2, the controller<br>
network 26 comprises a first network 28A connected to engine<br>
monitoring devices 27A, 27B or the like, a second network<br>
28B connected to a vehicle body control device 29 or the<br>
like, and a data recording device (data control device) 30<br>
connected to these networks 28A, 28B.<br>
The engine monitoring devices 27A, 27B are connected<br>
respectively to engine control devices 31A, 31B for<br>
controlling the two engines 19. Although the details of the<br>
engine control devices 31A, 31B are not depicted, the engine<br>
control devices 31A, 31B input, for instance, the engine<br>
speeds detected by revolution speed sensors and the governor<br>
rack positions detected by position sensors, and control<br>
fuel injection devices to regulate the fuel injection<br>
amounts of the engines 19. Although the details of the<br>
engine monitoring devices 27A, 27B are not depicted, the<br>
engine monitoring devices 27A, 27B input, for instance, the<br>
blow-by pressures of the engines 19 detected by pressure<br>
sensors and the cooling water temperatures of the radiators<br>
20 detected by temperature sensors. The operation data<br>
about the operating status of the engines 19 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as the engine-related data), which is input into<br>
the engine control devices 31A, 31B and engine monitoring<br>
devices 27A, 27B, is output to the data recording device 30<br>
through the first network 28A.<br>
The vehicle body control device 29 controls the<br>
vehicle body of the hydraulic excavator 1 and detects the<br>
18<br>
 <br>
operation data about the vehicle body. Although the details<br>
of the vehicle body control device 29 are not depicted, the<br>
vehicle body control device 29 exercises so-called total<br>
horsepower control by inputting the engine speeds detected<br>
by the revolution speed sensors and controlling the delivery<br>
rate of the hydraulic pumps 21 in accordance with the engine<br>
speeds to ensure that the total input torque of the<br>
hydraulic pump 21 is not greater than the engine output<br>
torque. Further, the vehicle body control device 29 inputs<br>
the hydraulic oil temperature detected by a oil temperature<br>
sensor and controls cooling fan motors for the oil coolers<br>
25 to ensure that the hydraulic oil temperature is constant.<br>
Furthermore, the vehicle body control device 29 inputs, for<br>
instance, the ON/OFF signal of a key switch (not shown) that<br>
operates to drive the engines 19. The operation data about<br>
the vehicle body of the hydraulic excavator 1 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as the vehicle body related data), which is<br>
input into the vehicle body control device 29, etc., is<br>
output to the data recording device 30 through the second<br>
network 28B.<br>
The data recording device 30 inputs and records the<br>
aforementioned engine related data and vehicle body related<br>
data. Further, the data recording device 30 judges whether<br>
the engines 19 are running (e.g., the data recording device<br>
30 may read the engine speed related data and judge whether<br>
the read engine speeds are higher than a predetermined<br>
engine speed or read key switch ON/OFF data and judge<br>
whether the key switch is ON), and computes the operating<br>
19<br>
 <br>
time (hour meter) of the engines 19 by making use of the<br>
temporal information of a timer, and records the computed<br>
operating time in association with the date and time<br>
(international standard time) that is constantly corrected<br>
based on the time indicated by a GPS device (not shown). It<br>
should be noted that the data recording device 30 records an<br>
operating time initial value that prevails when the<br>
hydraulic excavator 1 is delivered.<br>
The controller network 26 also comprises a plurality<br>
of communication connectors 32A, 32B, 32C. The<br>
communication connector 32A is connected to the data<br>
recording device 30 and positioned within the cab together<br>
with the data control device 30. The plurality of<br>
communication connectors 32B (eight connectors in Fig. 2)<br>
are connected to the first network 28A and positioned in<br>
engine chambers within the housings 6A, 6B together with the<br>
engine monitoring devices 27A, 27B. The plurality of<br>
communication connectors 32C (four connectors in Fig. 2) are<br>
connected to the second network 28B and positioned in pump<br>
chambers within the housings 6A, 6B together with the<br>
vehicle body control device 29. A mobile terminal 34 is<br>
included as a major feature of the present embodiment. The<br>
mobile terminal 34 can be communication-connected via a<br>
communication cable 33A for connecting to and disconnecting<br>
from the communication connector 32A, or a communication<br>
cable 33B for connecting to and disconnecting from the<br>
plurality of communication connectors 32B, 32C. The mobile<br>
terminal 34 mainly inputs data (e.g., the data about<br>
20<br>
 <br>
maintenance execution, maintenance results, countermeasure,<br>
or replenishment/replacement amount of oil or the like) on a<br>
plurality of maintenance items for the hydraulic excavator 1<br>
and creates maintenance history data.<br>
The functions of the mobile terminal 34, which is an<br>
essential part of the present embodiment, will now be<br>
described in detail. Fig. 4 is a block diagram illustrating<br>
the functional configuration of the mobile terminal 34.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the mobile terminal 34 is, for<br>
instance, a tablet personal computer. The mobile terminal<br>
34 comprises a storage device 35 (storage means) for storing<br>
control programs and maintenance history data, etc., a CPU<br>
36 (control means) for performing arithmetic processing in<br>
accordance with the control programs stored in the storage<br>
device 35, a RAM 37 for temporarily storing data that is<br>
arithmetically processed by the CPU 36, a monitor 38<br>
(display means), a display interface 39 for outputting a<br>
display signal to the monitor 38, a tablet 41 (input means)<br>
provided in front face of the monitor 38 to detect the<br>
contact of a pen 40 manipulated by a worker, a communication<br>
interface 42 for inputting data from the data recording<br>
device 30 via the communication cables 33, and a<br>
communication interface 44 for performing data input/output<br>
operations in relation, for instance, to a management server<br>
43 (see Fig. 21) as described later.<br>
The storage device 35 of the mobile terminal 34 has a<br>
program storage area 35a and a data storage area 35b. The<br>
program storage area 35a stores the control programs (e.g.,<br>
21<br>
 <br>
maintenance input program, maintenance history display<br>
program, maintenance interval setup program, and option<br>
setup program). The data storage area 35b stores, for<br>
instance, the maintenance history data (e.g., daily<br>
maintenance history, weekly maintenance history, monthly<br>
maintenance history, requested action history,<br>
countermeasure history, oil replenishment/replacement<br>
history, and findings) created by the maintenance input<br>
program and setup data that is set by the maintenance<br>
interval setup program and option setup program. In the<br>
present embodiment, the maintenance input program can be<br>
started only by a worker who performs maintenance tasks.<br>
The maintenance interval setup program and option setup<br>
program can be started only an administrator who is<br>
privileged, for instance, to change the settings. The<br>
maintenance history display program can be started by the<br>
worker and administrator. The control process performed by<br>
each control program will be described in detail below.<br>
(1) Maintenance input<br>
Figs. 5A and 5B show the transitions of a main screen<br>
that is displayed on the monitor 38 when the maintenance<br>
input program is started.<br>
When the maintenance input program starts, a<br>
communication condition input screen 45 is displayed on the<br>

communication baud rate input field 45b. When the worker<br>
operates the list display button (45f or 45g) (by bringing<br>
the pen 40 into contact with the associated display area),<br>
an input list (not shown), which lists a plurality of input<br>
terms, appears. More specifically, when the worker operates<br>
the list display button 45f, an input list (not shown)<br>
appears to list, for instance, "COM1", "COM2", and so on.<br>
When the worker selects, for instance, "COM1" from the input<br>
list, the input list closes, and "COM1" is entered into the<br>
communication port input field 45a. When the worker<br>
operates the input list display button 45g, an input list<br>
(not shown) appears to list, for instance, "14,400 bps",<br>
"28,800 bps", and so on. When the worker selects, for<br>
instance, "14,400 bps" from the input list, the input list<br>
closes, and "14,400 bps" is entered into the communication<br>
baud rate input field 45b.<br>
When the worker operates the communication button 4 5d<br>
in the communication condition input screen 45, the<br>
communication between the data recording device 30 and<br>
mobile terminal 34 starts under the communication conditions<br>
entered in the communication port input field 45a and<br>
communication baud rate input field 45b, and the displayed<br>
screen is changed to a machine information input screen 46.<br>
In this instance, data such as the model name and serial<br>
number of the hydraulic excavator 1, the operating time<br>
23<br>
 <br>
initial value prevailing at the time of delivery, and the<br>
operating time and date/time (international standard time)<br>
acquired at the beginning of communication is input from the<br>
data recording device 30 to the mobile terminal 34. If the<br>
communication between the data recording device 30 and<br>
mobile terminal 34 cannot be established for some reason,<br>
the worker can operate the resume button 45c in the<br>
communication condition input screen 45 to change the<br>
displayed screen in a state where the communication is not<br>
established. Operating the exit button 45e in the<br>
communication condition input screen 45 terminates the<br>
maintenance input program.<br>
The machine information input screen 4 6 has a<br>
customer code input field 46a, a hydraulic excavator model<br>

46g, a hydraulic excavator delivery date input field 46h,<br>
and an execution button 46i. The data (the model name and<br>
serial number of the hydraulic excavator 1 and the operating<br>
time prevailing at the beginning of communication) acquired<br>
from the data recording device 30 is displayed in the model<br>
name display field 46b, serial number display field 46c, and<br>
operating time display field 46d.<br>
A list display button 46j is positioned to the right<br>
of the front operating mechanism type input field 4 6e. When<br>
the worker operates the list display button 46j, an input<br>
24<br>
 <br>
list (not shown) appears to list, for instance, "loader",<br>
"backhoe", and so on. When the worker selects, for instance,<br>
"loader" from the input list, the input list closes, and<br>
"loader" is entered into the front operating mechanism type<br>
input field 46e.<br>
keyboard display buttons 46k are positioned to the<br>
right of the customer code input field 46a and engine<br>
identification number input fields 46f, 46g. When the<br>
worker operates the keyboard display button 4 6k, a keyboard<br>
dialog screen 47 shown in Fig. 6 appears. The keyboard<br>
dialog screen 47 has, for instance, a plurality of input<br>

A calendar display button 461 is positioned to the<br>
right of the delivery date input field 46h. When the worker<br>
operates the calendar display button 461, a calendar dialog<br>
screen (not shown) appears. The calendar dialog screen<br>
lists the days of a month and allows the worker to switch<br>
the list from one month to another. When the worker selects<br>
25<br>
 <br>
a particular date from the calendar dialog screen, the<br>
calendar dialog screen closes, and date data (e.g., in<br>
year/month/day format) is entered into the delivery date<br>
input field 46h.<br>
When the worker operates the execution button 46i in<br>
the machine information input screen 46, the storage device<br>
35 stores machine data (the aforementioned customer code,<br>
hydraulic excavator model name and serial number, operating<br>
time initial value prevailing at the time of delivery, type<br>
of the front operating mechanism 5, identification numbers<br>
of the engines 19, and delivery date), and the displayed<br>
screen is changed to a maintenance information input screen<br>

the associated maintenance target display screen (e.g., the<br>
overall view or enlarged detail view (not shown) of the<br>
hydraulic excavator 1, which indicates a maintenance target)<br>
appears. This enables the worker to perform a maintenance<br>
task while confirming a maintenance target.<br>
The worker can enter data into the data input field<br>
58d while viewing the previous data display field 58e. A<br>
"YES" button 58f is provided for a maintenance item (e.g., a<br>
maintenance item related to cleaning) which only maintenance<br>
execution data is input to. When the worker operates the<br>
"YES" button 58f, the word "YES" is entered into the data<br>
input field 58d to indicate that a maintenance task is<br>
performed. An "OK" button 58g, an "NG" button 58h, and an<br>
"ACT" button 58i are provided for a maintenance item (e.g.,<br>
a maintenance item related to level inspection) which a<br>
maintenance result or the like is input. When the worker<br>
operates the "OK" button 58g, the word "OK" is entered into<br>
the data input field 58d to indicate that an acceptable<br>
maintenance result is obtained. On the other hand, when the<br>
worker operates the "NG" button 58h, the word "NG" is<br>
entered into the data input field 58d to indicate that an<br>
unacceptable maintenance result is obtained (a problem is<br>
encountered and not corrected). If the worker operates the<br>
"ACT" button 58i when any remedial action is taken after an<br>
unacceptable maintenance result is obtained, a<br>
countermeasure input screen 59 shown in Fig. 8 appears.<br>
30<br>
 <br>
The countermeasure input screen 59 has a<br>
countermeasure input field 59a and an execution button 59b.<br>
A keyboard display button 59c and a list display button 59d<br>
are positioned to the right of the countermeasure input<br>
field 59a. When the worker operates the keyboard display<br>
button 59c, the keyboard dialog screen 47 appears. A<br>
countermeasure is input into the countermeasure input field<br>
59a when the keyboard dialog screen 47 is operated as<br>
described above. On the other hand, when the worker<br>
operates the list display button 59d, an input list (not<br>
shown) appears to list, for instance, "ADJUSTED", "REPAIRED",<br>
"REPLACED", "REFILLED", or other countermeasure. When the<br>
worker selects a countermeasure from the input list, the<br>
input list closes, and the selected countermeasure is<br>
entered into the countermeasure input field 59a. When the<br>
worker subsequently operates the execution button 59b in the<br>
countermeasure input screen 59, a combination of the<br>
maintenance item and the countermeasure input in the<br>
countermeasure input field 59a is handled as countermeasure<br>
history data and stored in the storage device 35 in<br>
association with the machine data and maintenance data.<br>
Further, the countermeasure input screen 59 closes, and the<br>
word "ACT" is entered into the data input field 58d to<br>
indicate that remedial action is taken. If the data input<br>
field 58d is blank, it means that no maintenance has been<br>
performed.<br>
When the worker operates the execution button 54a in<br>
the daily maintenance input screen 54, a combination of the<br>
31<br>
 <br>
maintenance item in the daily maintenance input screen 54<br>
and the data input in the data input field 58d is handled as<br>
daily maintenance history data and stored in the storage<br>
device 35 in association with the machine data and<br>
maintenance data. Further, the displayed screen is returned<br>
to the daily/weekly maintenance input menu screen 52.<br>
Similarly, when the worker operates the execution button 56a<br>
in the weekly maintenance input screen 56, a combination of<br>
the maintenance item in the weekly maintenance input screen<br>
56 and the data input in the data input field 58d is handled<br>
as weekly maintenance history data and stored in the storage<br>
device 35 in association with the machine data and<br>
maintenance data. Further, the displayed screen is returned<br>
to the daily/weekly maintenance input menu screen 52.<br>
When the worker operates the<br>
replenishment/replacement amount button 53c in the<br>
daily/weekly maintenance input menu screen 52, the displayed<br>
screen is changed to a replenishment/replacement amount<br>
input screen 60 (see Fig. 7C). The<br>
replenishment/replacement amount input screen 60 has the<br>
basic information display area 50, a<br>
replenishment/replacement amount input area 61, an amount<br>
unit display field 60a, and an execution button 60b. The<br>
amount unit display field 60a shows a unit that is selected<br>
by the option setup program as described later. The<br>
replenishment/replacement amount input area 61 displays a<br>
plurality of oil items (engine oil, gear oil, hydraulic oil,<br>
water, grease, fuel, etc.) that is to be replenished and<br>
32<br>
 <br>
replaced. A name display field 61a, a data input field 61b,<br>
and a previous data display field 61c are provided for each<br>
oil item.<br>
The worker can enter data into the data input field<br>
61b while viewing the previous data display field 61c A<br>
numeric keypad display button 61d is positioned to the right<br>
of the data input field 61b. When the worker operates the<br>
numeric keypad display button 61d, a numeric keypad dialog<br>
screen 62 shown in Fig. 9 appears. The numeric keypad<br>
dialog screen 62 has a plurality of input buttons 62a (e g<br>
"0" to "9"), a display field 62b for displaying a numerical<br>
value input through the input buttons 62a, a clear button<br>
62c for deleting all numerals displayed in the display field<br>
62b, a backspace button 62d for deleting the last numeral<br>
and an execution button 62e. When the worker operates the<br>
execution button 62e after operating the input buttons 62a<br>
in the numeric keypad dialog screen 62 to display an input<br>
numerical value in the display field 62b, the numeric keypad<br>
dialog screen 62 closes, and the numerical value is entered<br>
into the data input field 61b.<br>
When the worker operates the execution button 60b in<br>
the replenishment/replacement amount input screen 60 a<br>
combination of the oil item and the numerical value input in<br>
the data input field 61b (and the unit displayed in the<br>
amount unit display field 60a) is handled as<br>
replenishment/replacement history data and stored in the<br>
storage device 35 in association with the machine data and<br>
maintenance data. Further, the displayed screen is returned<br>
33<br>
 <br>
to the daily/weekly maintenance input menu screen 52.<br>
Furthermore, when the main menu button 53d in the<br>
daily/weekly maintenance input menu screen 52 is operated,<br>
the displayed screen is returned to the maintenance input<br>
main menu screen 49.<br>
When the worker operates the new findings button 53e<br>
in the daily/weekly maintenance input menu screen 52, the<br>
new findings button 54b in the daily maintenance input<br>
screen 54, or the new findings button 56b in the weekly<br>
maintenance input screen 56, the displayed screen is changed<br>
to a new findings input screen 103 shown in Fig. 22. Also,<br>
when the worker operates a new findings button 64c in a<br>
monthly maintenance input menu screen 63 (see Fig. 10A), a<br>
new findings button 65b in a monthly maintenance input<br>
screen 65A, 65B (see Figs. 10A and 10B), or a new findings<br>
button 68b in an outstanding maintenance input screen 68<br>
(see Fig. 11), which will be described later, the displayed<br>
screen is changed to the new findings input screen 103. The<br>
new findings input screen 103 has the basic information<br>
display area 50, a new findings input area 104, a back<br>
button 103a, and a main menu button 103b. The new findings<br>
input area 104 has a location input field 104a, a part input<br>
field 104b, a symptom input field 104c, a damage level input<br>
field 104d, a picture input field 104e, a countermeasure<br>
input field 104f, a replacement part input field 104g, a<br>
comment input field 104h, a save button 104i, a recall<br>
button 104j r a clear button 104k, and a submit button 1041.<br>
A list display button 104m and a picture display<br>
34<br>
 <br>
button 104n are positioned to the right of the location<br>
input field 104a. When the worker operates the list display<br>
button 104m, a first input list appears, for instance, to<br>
list the locations of first items shown in Fig. 23. When<br>
the worker selects a location from the first input list, a<br>
second input list appears to list the detailed locations<br>
(second item locations) of the selected first item location.<br>
When the worker selects a location from the second input<br>
list, the second input list closes, and the location<br>
selected from the first and second item listings is entered<br>
into the location input field 104a. On the other hand, when<br>
the worker operates the picture display button 104n, the<br>
overall view (not shown) of the hydraulic excavator appears.<br>
When the worker selects the location of a first item, which<br>
is described above, from the overall view of the hydraulic<br>
excavator, an enlarged detail view representing the selected<br>
location appears. When the worker selects a detailed<br>
location (the location of a second item as described above)<br>
from the enlarged detail view, the enlarged detail view<br>
disappears, and the selected location is entered into the<br>
location input field 104a.<br>
A list display button 104o is positioned to the right<br>
of the part input field 104b. When the worker operates the<br>
list display button 104o, a first input list appears, for<br>
instance, to list categories of the first item shown in Fig<br>
24. When the worker selects one of the categories (e.g.,<br>
electrical part, component, or others) in the first input<br>
list, a second input list appears to list parts belonging to<br>
35<br>
 <br>
the selected category. When the worker selects one of the<br>
parts in the second input list, the second input list closes,<br>
and the part selected from the second item is entered into<br>
the part input field 104b. If the worker selects and<br>
operates a category (e.g., hose, frame, welded portion, or<br>
wire) of the first item not corresponding to the second item<br>
in the first input list, the transition to the second input<br>
list is not performed. In addition, the first input list<br>
closes, and the category selected from the first item is<br>
entered into the part input field 104b.<br>
A list display button 104p is positioned to the right<br>
of the symptom input field 104c. When the worker operates<br>
the list display button 104p, an input list appears to list<br>
various symptoms such as a scratch, crack, leak, clog, burst,<br>
looseness, malfunction, short circuit, and open circuit.<br>
When the worker selects a symptom from the input list, the<br>
input list closes, and the selected symptom is entered into<br>
the symptom input field 104b.<br>
In the damage level input field 104d, selectable<br>
levels such as "Heavy", "Light", "Fair", and "Information<br>
Only" are displayed together with check boxes, and one of<br>
the check boxes can be selected.<br>
A picture input button 104q is positioned above the<br>
picture input field 104e. When the worker operates the<br>
picture input button 104q, a screen (not shown) for<br>
selecting picture data stored in the storage device 35<br>
appears. When picture data is selected from the screen, the<br>
selected picture is displayed in the input field 104e.<br>
36<br>
 <br>
A countermeasure input button 104r is positioned to<br>
the right of the countermeasure input field 104f. When the<br>
worker operates the countermeasure input button 104r, the<br>
countermeasure input screen 59 appears. When the worker<br>
operates the execution button 59b after entering a<br>
countermeasure in the countermeasure input field 59a in the<br>
countermeasure input screen 59, the countermeasure input<br>
screen 59 closes, and the countermeasure is entered into the<br>
countermeasure input field 104f. If, in this instance,<br>
"REPLACED" is entered into the countermeasure input field<br>
104f, the keyboard dialog screen 47 appears. A number is<br>
then entered in the replacement part input field 104g when<br>
the keyboard dialog screen 47 is operated as described above.<br>
A keyboard display button 104s is positioned to the<br>
right of the comment input field 104h. When the worker<br>
operates the keyboard display button 104s, the keyboard<br>
dialog screen 47 appears. Text data is then entered into<br>
the comment input field 104h when the keyboard dialog screen<br>
47 is operated as described above.<br>
When the worker operates the save button 104i, the<br>
data entered in the input fields 104a-104h is handled as new<br>
findings data and temporarily stored in the storage device<br>
35 in association with the machine data and maintenance data<br>
(it should be noted that the temporarily stored new findings<br>
data cannot be output, for instance, to the management<br>
server 43). When the worker subsequently operates the<br>
recall button 104j, the temporarily stored new findings data<br>
is read and entered into the input fields 104a-104h. If the<br>
37<br>
 <br>
worker operates the clear button 104k, the input fields<br>
104a-104h become blank. If the worker operates the submit<br>
button 1041, the data entered in the input fields 104a-104h<br>
is handled as new findings data and stored in the storage<br>
device 35 in association with the machine data and<br>
maintenance data (the stored new findings data can be output,<br>
for instance, to the management server 43).<br>
When the worker operates the back button 103a in the<br>
new findings input screen 103, the displayed screen is<br>
returned to the previous screen. When the main menu button<br>
103b in the new findings input screen 103, the displayed<br>
screen is returned to the maintenance input main menu screen<br>
49.<br>
Returning to Fig. 5B, if the worker operates the<br>
monthly maintenance button 51c in the maintenance input main<br>
menu screen 49, the displayed screen is changed to the<br>
monthly maintenance input menu screen 63 shown in Fig. 10A.<br>
The monthly maintenance input menu screen 63 has the basic<br>
information display area 50 and a menu display area 64. The<br>
menu display area 64 has, for instance, five maintenance<br>
type buttons 64a (parts replacement button, oil draining<br>
button, cleaning button, visual inspection button, and<br>
greasing button in Fig. 10A), the aforementioned new<br>
findings button 64c, and a main menu button 64b. When the<br>
worker operates a maintenance type button 64a, the displayed<br>
screen is changed to the monthly maintenance input screen<br>
(the screens 65A and 65B are representatively shown in Figs.<br>
10A and 10B), which displays maintenance items that fall<br>
38<br>
 <br>
under the category indicated by the operated maintenance<br>
type button.<br>
The monthly maintenance input screen (e.g., 65A or<br>
65B) has the basic information display area 50, a<br>
maintenance input area 66, an execution button 65a, and the<br>
new findings button 65b. The maintenance input area 66<br>
displays maintenance tasks that are to be performed monthly<br>
(e.g., at intervals of 250 operating hours or multiples of<br>
250 operating hours). The maintenance input area 66 has a<br>
plurality of sheets 67 that displays a list of maintenance<br>
items classified by maintenance target (engines, engine oil,<br>
gear oil, drive system, hydraulic system, etc.). When the<br>
tab 67a of a sheet 67 indicating a maintenance target is<br>
operated, the corresponding sheet 67 is selected and<br>
displayed. The sheet 67 has an item number button 67b, an<br>
item description display field 67c, a data input field 67d,<br>
and a previous data display field 67e for each maintenance<br>
item. When the worker operates the item number button 67b,<br>
the associated maintenance target display screen (not shown)<br>
appears. This enables the worker to perform a maintenance<br>
task while confirming a maintenance target.<br>
The worker can enter data into the data input field<br>
67d while viewing the previous data display field 67e. A<br>
"YES" button 67f is provided for a maintenance item, for<br>
instance, in the monthly maintenance input screen 65A that<br>
appears when the parts replacement button 64a is operated,<br>
that is, a maintenance item which only maintenance execution<br>
data is input to. When the worker operates the "YES" button<br>
39<br>
 <br>
67f, the word "YES" is entered into the data input field 67d.<br>
An "OK" button 67g, an "NG" button 67h, and an "ACT" button<br>
67i are provided for a maintenance item, for instance, in<br>
the monthly maintenance input screen 65B that appears when<br>
the visual inspection button 64a is operated, that is, a<br>
maintenance item which a maintenance result or the like is<br>
input to. When the worker operates the "OK" button 67g, the<br>
word "OK" is entered into the data input field 67d. When<br>
the worker operates the "NG" button 67h, the word "NG" is<br>
entered into the data input field 67d. If the worker<br>
operates the "ACT" button 67i when any remedial action is<br>
taken after an unacceptable maintenance result is obtained,<br>
the countermeasure input screen 59 described above appears.<br>
When the worker operates the execution button 59b<br>
after entering countermeasure data in the countermeasure<br>
input field 59a in the countermeasure input screen 59, a<br>
combination of the maintenance item and the data input in<br>
the countermeasure input field 59a is handled as<br>
countermeasure history data and stored in the storage device<br>
35 in association with the machine data and maintenance data.<br>
Further, the countermeasure input screen 59 closes, and the<br>
word "ACT" is entered in the data input field 67d.<br>
When the worker operates the execution button 65a in<br>
the monthly maintenance input screen (e.g., 65A or 65B), a<br>
combination of the maintenance item and the data entered in<br>
the data input field 67c is handled as monthly maintenance<br>
history data and stored in the storage device 35 in<br>
association with the machine data and maintenance data.<br>
40<br>
 <br>
Further, the displayed screen is returned to the monthly<br>
maintenance input menu screen 63. Furthermore, when the<br>
main menu button 64b in the monthly maintenance input menu<br>
screen 63 is operated, the displayed screen is returned to<br>
the maintenance input main menu screen 49.<br>
Returning to Fig. 5B, if the worker operates the<br>
outstanding maintenance button 51d in the maintenance input<br>
main menu screen 49, the displayed screen is changed to the<br>
outstanding maintenance input screen 68 (see Fig. 11), which<br>
displays outstanding maintenance items extracted from<br>
maintenance items, for instance, in the daily maintenance<br>
input screen 54, weekly maintenance input screen 56, and<br>
monthly maintenance input screens 67A, 67B. Fig. 12 is a<br>
flowchart showing control procedure of an outstanding<br>
maintenance item extraction process.<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, step 100 is performed first to<br>
determine whether the data input field 58d (or 67d) for each<br>
maintenance item is blank. If "YES", "OK", "NG", or "ACT"<br>
is input in the data input field 58d (or 67d), the<br>
determination of step 100 is not satisfied and processing<br>
proceeds to step 110. In step 110, the associated<br>
maintenance item is set in the un-indication state.<br>
On the other hand, if the data input field 58d (or<br>
67d) is blank in step 100, the determination is satisfied<br>
and processing proceeds to step 120. Step 120 is performed<br>
to determine whether "NG" is input in the previous data<br>
display field 58e (or 67e) for each maintenance item. If<br>
"NG" is input in the previous data display field 58e (or<br>
41<br>
 <br>
67e), the determination of step 120 is satisfied and<br>
processing proceeds to step 130. In step 130, the<br>
associated maintenance item is set in the indication state.<br>
In other words, an outstanding maintenance item is extracted.<br>
On the other hand, if the previous data display field<br>
58e (or 67e) is "YES", "OK", "ACT", or blank in step 120,<br>
the determination is not satisfied and processing proceeds<br>
to step 140. In step 140, the actual operating time is<br>
calculated by determining the difference between the<br>
operating time prevailing at the beginning of communication<br>
and the operating time initial value prevailing at the time<br>
of delivery which are acquired from the data recording<br>
device 30. Next, step 150 is performed to read maintenance<br>
interval data (operating time standard, which will be<br>
described in detail later in conjunction with the<br>
maintenance interval setup program) from the storage device<br>
35 in accordance with the model name of the hydraulic<br>
excavator 1 acquired from the data recording device 30, and<br>
to determine whether the actual operating time is not<br>
shorter than the maintenance interval. If the actual<br>
operating time is shorter than the maintenance interval, the<br>
determination of step 150 is not satisfied and processing<br>
proceeds to step 110. The associated maintenance item is<br>
set in the un-indication state in step 110.<br>
On the other hand, if the actual operating time is<br>
not shorter than the maintenance interval in step 150, the<br>
determination is satisfied and processing proceeds to step<br>
160. Step 160 is performed to determine whether maintenance<br>
42<br>
 <br>
has been performed at the maintenance interval (actually<br>
within a predefined permissible maintenance period that is<br>
based on specified maintenance interval) in accordance with<br>
the previous maintenance history data stored in the storage<br>
device 38. If maintenance has been performed at the<br>
maintenance interval, the determination of step 160 is<br>
satisfied and processing proceeds to step 110. The<br>
associated maintenance item is set in the un-indication<br>
state in step 110. On the other hand, if maintenance has<br>
not been performed at the maintenance interval, the<br>
determination of step 160 is not satisfied and processing<br>
proceeds to step 130. The associated maintenance item is<br>
set in the indication state in step 130. In other words, an<br>
outstanding maintenance item is extracted.<br>
The outstanding maintenance item extraction process<br>
described above may be performed when the worker operates<br>
the execution button 48g in the maintenance information<br>
input screen 48. Further, if there is any outstanding<br>
maintenance item, the displayed screen may be changed to the<br>
outstanding maintenance input screen 68, and if there is no<br>
outstanding maintenance item, the displayed screen may be<br>
changed to the maintenance input main menu screen 49.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that outstanding maintenance<br>
items be extracted just before a point of maintenance<br>
recommendation time. Therefore, step 150 may be performed<br>
to judge whether the actual operating time is not shorter<br>
than the maintenance interval minus a predetermined period.<br>
Returning to Fig. 11, the outstanding maintenance<br>
4 3<br>
 <br>
input screen 68 has the basic information display area 50, a<br>
maintenance input area 69, an execution button 68a, and the<br>
new findings button 68b. The maintenance input area 69<br>
displays outstanding maintenance items extracted as<br>
described above. The maintenance input area 69 has a<br>
plurality of sheets 70 that displays a list of maintenance<br>
items classified by maintenance type (parts replacement, oil<br>
draining, cleaning, appearance inspection, greasing, level<br>
inspection, visual inspection, etc.). When the tab 70a of a<br>
sheet 70 indicating a maintenance type is operated, the<br>
corresponding sheet 70 is selected and displayed. The<br>
configuration of the sheet 70 is not described here because<br>
it is the same as for the aforementioned sheets 58, 67.<br>
When the execution button 68a in the outstanding<br>
maintenance input screen 68 is operated, the associated<br>
maintenance history data (daily maintenance history data,<br>
weekly maintenance history data, and monthly maintenance<br>
history data) is stored in the storage device 35 in<br>
association with the machine data and maintenance data.<br>
Further, the displayed screen is returned to the maintenance<br>
input main menu screen 49.<br>
Returning to Fig. 5B, if the worker operates the<br>
replenishment button 51e in the maintenance input main menu<br>
screen 49, the displayed screen is changed to a<br>
replenishment amount input screen 71 shown in Fig. 13. The<br>
replenishment amount input screen 71 is used to enter a<br>
replenishment amount for a replenishment operation in the<br>
case that there is a person who periodically effects<br>
44<br>
 <br>
replenishment in addition to a person who performs<br>
maintenance (replenishment and replacement tasks included).<br>
The replenishment amount input screen 71 has a basic<br>
information display area 50A (this area is obtained by<br>
removing the maintenance date/time display field 50e from<br>
the basic information display area 50), a date input field<br>
71a for entering a replenishment date, a time input field<br>
71b for entering replenishment time, a replenishment item<br>
input field 71c, a replenishment amount input field 7Id, an<br>
amount unit display field 71e, and an execution button 71f.<br>
The amount unit display field lie displays a unit that is<br>
selected by the option setup program as described later.<br>
numeric keypad display buttons 71g for enabling to<br>
open the numeric keypad dialog screen 62 are positioned to<br>
the right of the date input field 71a, time input field 71b,<br>
and replenishment amount input field 71d. A replenishment<br>
date, time, and amount is input into the date input field<br>
71a, time input field 71b, and replenishment amount input<br>
field 71d when the numeric keypad dialog screen 62 is<br>
operated as described above. A list display button 71h is<br>
positioned to the right of the replenishment item input<br>
field 71c. When the worker operates the list display button<br>
71h, an input list (not shown) appears to list, for instance,<br>
"ENGINE OIL", "GEAR OIL", and so on. When the worker<br>
selects, for instance, "ENGINE OIL" from the input list, the<br>
input list closes, and "ENGINE OIL" is entered in the<br>
replenishment item input field 46e.<br>
When the execution button 71f in the replenishment<br>
45<br>
 <br>
amount input screen 71 is operated, the replenishment date<br>
and time (local time) entered in the date input field 71a<br>
and time input field 71b is converted to international<br>
standard time. Further, the converted date and time<br>
(international standard time), the operating time indicated<br>
in the operating time display field 50d of the basic<br>
information display area 50A, and the maintenance personnel<br>
name indicated in the name display field 50f are stored in<br>
the storage device 35 as replenishment data. In addition, a<br>
combination of the replenishment item entered in the<br>
replenishment item input field 71c, the amount entered in<br>
the replenishment amount input field 7Id, and the unit<br>
indicated in the amount unit display field lie is handled as<br>
replenishment history data and stored in the storage device<br>
35 in association with the machine data and replenishment<br>
data. Furthermore, the displayed screen is returned to the<br>
maintenance input main menu screen 49.<br>
Returning to Fig. 5B, if the worker operates the<br>
requested action button 51g in the maintenance input main<br>
menu screen 49, the displayed screen is changed to a<br>
requested action input screen 105 (see Fig. 25) that<br>
displays additionally set maintenance items. The requested<br>
action input screen 105 has the basic information display<br>
area 50, a maintenance input area 106, and an execution<br>
button 105a. The maintenance input area 106 has an item<br>
number button 106a, an item description display field 106b,<br>
a replacement parts display field 106c, and a data input<br>
field 106d for each maintenance item. When the worker<br>
16<br>
 <br>
operates the item number button 106a, the associated<br>
maintenance target display screen (not shown) appears. This<br>
enables the worker to perform a maintenance task while<br>
confirming a maintenance target. If a parts replacement<br>
task is indicated in the item description display field 106b,<br>
the associated replacement part number is indicated in the<br>
replacement parts display field 106c.<br>
An "OK" button 106e, an "NG" button 106f, and an<br>
"ACT" button 106g are provided for a maintenance item which<br>
a maintenance result or other similar data is input to.<br>
When the worker operates the "OK" button 106e, the word "OK"<br>
is entered into the data input field 106d to indicate that<br>
an acceptable maintenance result is obtained. When the<br>
worker operates the "NG" button 106f, the word "NG" is<br>
entered into the data input field 106d to indicate that an<br>
unacceptable maintenance result is obtained (a problem is<br>
encountered and not corrected). If the worker operates the<br>
"ACT" button 106g when any remedial action is taken after an<br>
unacceptable maintenance result is obtained, the<br>
countermeasure input screen 59 described above appears.<br>
When the worker operates the execution button 59b<br>
after entering countermeasure data in the countermeasure<br>
input field 59a of the countermeasure input screen 59, a<br>
combination of the maintenance item and the data entered in<br>
the countermeasure input field 59a is handled as<br>
countermeasure history data and stored in the storage device<br>
35 in association with the machine data and maintenance data.<br>
Further, the countermeasure input screen 59 closes, and the<br>
47<br>
 <br>
word "ACT" is entered into the data input field 106d.<br>
When the worker operates the execution button 105a in<br>
the requested action input screen 105, a combination of the<br>
maintenance item and the data entered in the data input<br>
field 106d is handled as requested action history data and<br>
stored in the storage device 35 in association with the<br>
machine data and maintenance data. Further, the displayed<br>
screen is returned to the maintenance input main menu screen<br>
49.<br>
Returning to Fig. 5B, if the worker operates the<br>
machine information button 51a in the maintenance input main<br>

"ENGINE OIL" is entered into the replenishment item input<br>
field 89e.<br>
When the worker operates the submenu button 89h in<br>
the replenishment amount input screen 89, the replenishment<br>
date/time (local time) entered in the date input field 89a<br>
and time input field 89b is converted to the international<br>
standard time. Further, the converted date/time<br>
(international standard time), the operating time entered in<br>
the operating time input field 89c, and the replenishment<br>
personnel name entered in the name input field 8 9d are<br>
stored in the storage device 35 as replenishment data.<br>
Furthermore, a combination of the replenishment item entered<br>
in the replenishment item input field 89e and the<br>
58<br>
 <br>
replenishment amount entered in the replenishment amount<br>
input field 89f (plus the unit displayed in the amount unit<br>
display field 89g) is handled as replenishment history data<br>
and stored in the storage device 35 in association with the<br>
machine data and replenishment data. Moreover, the<br>
displayed screen is returned to the maintenance history<br>
display main menu screen 73. Operating the exit button 73e<br>
in the maintenance history display main menu screen 73<br>
terminates the maintenance history display program.<br>
(3) Maintenance interval setup<br>
Fig. 19 shows the transition of a screen that is<br>
displayed on the monitor 38 when the maintenance interval<br>
setup program is started. The present embodiment can change<br>
the maintenance intervals variously for all monthly<br>
maintenance items.<br>
When the maintenance interval setup program starts,<br>
an interval setup menu screen 90 is displayed as shown Fig.<br>
19. The interval setup menu screen 90 has a model name<br>
input field 90a for entering the model name of the hydraulic<br>
excavator 1, a plurality of maintenance type buttons 90b<br>
(parts replacement button, oil draining button, cleaning<br>
button, visual inspection button, and greasing button in Fig<br>
19), and an exit button 90c. A list display button 90d is<br>
positioned to the right of the model name input field 90a.<br>
When the administrator operates the list display button 90d,<br>
an input list (not shown) appears to list various hydraulic<br>
excavator model names (prestored model names or model names<br>
input and stored from the data recording device 30). When<br>
59<br>
 <br>
the administrator selects a model name from the input list,<br>
the input list closes, and the selected model name is<br>
entered in the model name input field 90a.<br>
When the administrator operates one of the plurality<br>
of maintenance type buttons 90b, the displayed screen is<br>
changed to an interval setting input screen (the screen 91A<br>
is representatively shown in Fig. 19), which displays<br>
maintenance items that fall under the category indicated by<br>
the operated maintenance type button.<br>
The interval setting input screen (e.g., 91A) has a<br>
model name display field 91a, an interval setting input area<br>
92, a default button 91b, and an execution button 91c. The<br>
model name display field 91a displays a model name entered<br>
in the model name input field 90a of the interval setup menu<br>
screen 90. The interval setting input area 92 has a<br>
plurality of sheets 93 that display a list of maintenance<br>
items classified by maintenance target (e.g., engine system,<br>
engine oil, gear oil, drive system, or hydraulic system).<br>
When the tab 93a of a sheet 93 indicating a maintenance<br>
target is operated, the corresponding sheet 93 is selected<br>
and displayed. The sheet 93 has an item description display<br>
field 93b and an interval input field 93c for each<br>
maintenance item. A list display button 93d is positioned<br>
to the right of the interval input field 93c. When the<br>
administrator operates the list display button 93d, an input<br>
list (not shown) appears to list, for instance, a plurality<br>
of minimum interval units (basic units). When the<br>
administrator selects a minimum interval unit from the input<br>
60<br>
 <br>
list, the input list closes, and the selected minimum<br>
interval unit is entered into the interval input field 93c.<br>
If the administrator operates the default button 91c, ail<br>
the interval input fields 93c of a displayed sheet 93 revert<br>
to an initial value (e.g., "250").<br>
When the administrator operates the execution button<br>
91c in the interval setting input screen (e.g., 91A), a<br>
combination of the maintenance item and the minimum interval<br>
unit entered in the interval input field 93b is handled as<br>
basic interval data for the model indicated in the model<br>
name display field 91a and stored in the storage device 35.<br>
Further, the displayed screen is returned to the interval<br>
setup menu screen 90.<br>
The CPU 36 in the mobile terminal 34 computes the<br>
maintenance interval for each maintenance item in accordance<br>
with the basic interval data stored in the storage device 35,<br>
and stores the computed maintenance intervals in the storage<br>
device 35 as maintenance interval setting data. More<br>
specifically, recommended maintenance interval data for<br>
various hydraulic excavator models (e.g., manufacturer-<br>
recommended maintenance intervals for each maintenance item)<br>
are prestored in the storage device 35, and a multiple of<br>
the minimum interval unit for each maintenance item that is<br>
closest to a recommended interval value is selected as an<br>
interval setting. If, for instance, the minimum interval<br>
unit is 300 hours in a situation where the recommended<br>
interval value is 4000 hours, 3900 hours and 4200 hours,<br>
which are multiples of 300 hours, are compared. Since 3900<br>
61<br>
 <br>
hours is closer to the recommended interval value (4000<br>
hours) than 4200 hours, an interval setting of 3900 hours is<br>
selected. The aforementioned process for extracting<br>
outstanding maintenance items is performed in accordance<br>
with the maintenance interval setting data described above.<br>
An alternative would be to display the aforementioned<br>
interval setting for each maintenance item and allow the<br>
administrator to change the interval setting without<br>
exceeding the recommended interval value although such an<br>
alternative is not indicated in the drawings or the like.<br>
(4) Option setup<br>
Fig. 20 shows a screen that is displayed on the<br>
monitor 38 when the option setup program is started.<br>
When the option setup program starts, an option setup<br>
screen 94 is displayed as shown in Fig. 20. The option<br>
setup screen 94 has a country/region input field 94a, an<br>
amount unit input field 94b, an update button 94c, and an<br>
exit button 94d. List display buttons 94e, 94f are<br>
positioned to the right of the country/region input field<br>
94a and amount unit input field 94b. When the administrator<br>
operates the list display button 94e, an input list (not<br>
shown) appears to list a plurality of countries/regions (and<br>
the time differences from the international standard time).<br>
When the administrator selects a country/region from the<br>
input list, the input list closes, and the selected<br>
country/region is entered into the country/region input<br>
field 94a. On the other hand, when the administrator<br>
operates the list display button 94f, an input list (not<br>
62<br>
 <br>
shown) appears to list, for instance, "gallon", "Liter", and<br>
so on. When the administrator selects, for instance,<br>
"gallon" from the input list, the input list closes, and<br>
"gallon" is entered into the amount unit input field 94b.<br>
When the administrator operates the update button 94c<br>
in the option setup screen 94, the data entered in the<br>
country/region input field 94a and amount unit input field<br>
94b are stored in the storage device 35 as option setting<br>
data, and the option setup program terminates. If the<br>
administrator operates the exit button 94d in the option<br>
setup screen 94, the option setup program terminates<br>
immediately.<br>
In accordance with the time difference from the<br>
international standard time included in the option setting<br>
data, the date/time (international standard time) acquired<br>
from the data recording device 30 (or stored in the storage<br>
device 35) and the date/time (local time) to be displayed on<br>
screen are converted as described above. Further, the unit<br>
included in the option setting data is displayed in the<br>
aforementioned amount unit display fields 60a, 71e, 89g.<br>
The operations and advantages of the present<br>
embodiment will now be described.<br>
When, for instance, the engine system 19 is to be<br>
inspected for monthly maintenance purposes, the worker moves<br>
into the engine chamber in the housing 6A (or 6B) of the<br>
hydraulic excavator 1, and connects the mobile terminal 34<br>
to the communication connector 32B through the communication<br>
cable 33B, and operates the mobile terminal 34 to enter the<br>
63<br>
 <br>
operating time and date/time from the data control device 30<br>
to the mobile terminal 34. Further, the worker operates the<br>
mobile terminal 34 to display engine system maintenance<br>
items on the monitor 38, and performs maintenance as<br>
specified, and operates the mobile terminal 34 to enter-<br>
maintenance result data for the purpose of indicating<br>
whether acceptable maintenance results are obtained. The<br>
mobile terminal 34 handles the input data for maintenance<br>
items as maintenance history data and stores it in<br>
association with the operating time and date/time of the<br>
hydraulic excavator 1. The worker causes the monitor 38 to<br>
display the maintenance history data stored in the mobile<br>
terminal 34.<br>
The worker may output the maintenance history data<br>
stored in the mobile terminal 34, for instance, to the<br>
management server 43. Fig. 21 is a schematic diagram<br>
exemplifying the configuration of an information network<br>
including the management server 43.<br>
As shown in Fig. 21, the information network 95<br>
comprises a customer network 96 and a manufacturer network<br>
98. The customer network 96 is positioned, for instance, in<br>
an office near the work site for the hydraulic excavator 1.<br>
The manufacturer network 98 is connected to the customer<br>
network 96 via a communication link 97 (e.g., the Internet<br>
based on a public circuit). The customer network 96<br>
comprises the management server 43 and an information<br>
terminal 100. The management server 43 inputs the<br>
maintenance history data from the mobile terminal 34, which<br>
64<br>
 <br>
is communication-connected through the communication cable<br>
99 or the like (or via a wireless communication link), and<br>
stores the input maintenance history data. The information<br>
terminal 100 is connected to the management server 43. The<br>
manufacturer network 98 comprises a management server 101<br>
and an information terminal 102. The management server 101<br>
checks whether the maintenance history data in the<br>
management server 43 of the customer network 96 is updated.<br>
If the maintenance history data is updated, the management<br>
server 101 performs a download automatically or with a<br>
customer's approval. The aforementioned maintenance history<br>
display program is installed on the information terminals<br>
100, 102. In the information terminals 100, 102, the<br>
maintenance history data stored in the management servers 43,<br>
101 is displayed on the monitor in accordance with the<br>
operation.<br>
As described above, the present embodiment enables<br>
the mobile terminal 34 to acquire the operating time and<br>
date/time from the data recording device 30 of the hydraulic<br>
excavator 1 and store the acquired temporal information<br>
about the hydraulic excavator 1 in association with the<br>
maintenance history data. Consequently, the reliability of<br>
the temporal information about the maintenance history data<br>
can be made higher than when, for instance, the temporal<br>
information is manually entered into the mobile terminal 34.<br>
Further, since the temporal information about the hydraulic<br>
excavator 1 is used as the reference, the temporal<br>
relationship between the maintenance history data and the<br>
65<br>
 <br>
occurrence of a hydraulic excavator abnormality can be<br>
determined with increased precision. This makes it possible<br>
to perform fault diagnostics on the hydraulic excavator 1<br>
more rapidly with increased accuracy.<br>
Further, the present embodiment makes it possible to<br>
carry the mobile terminal 34 in accordance with a<br>
maintenance target of the hydraulic excavator, and to<br>
connect the mobile terminal 34 to the communication<br>
connector 32B or 32C via the communication cable 33B (or<br>
connect the mobile terminal 34 to the communication<br>
connector 32A via the communication cable 33A), and to enter<br>
the operating time, date/time, and other data from the data<br>
recording device 30 into the mobile terminal 34. Therefore,<br>
the data can be entered into the mobile terminal 34 near a<br>
maintenance target that is accessed for maintenance purposes.<br>
This makes it possible to increase operating efficiency.<br>
The data recording device 30 may alternatively be<br>
communication-connected to the mobile terminal 34 via a<br>
wireless communication link or the like instead of the<br>
communication connectors 33A, 33B, 33c and communication<br>
cables 32A, 32B. Such a modified embodiment also provides<br>
the same advantages as the present embodiment described<br>
above.<br>
Furthermore, the mobile terminal 34 according to the<br>
present embodiment opens the daily maintenance input screen<br>
54, weekly maintenance input screen 56, and monthly<br>
maintenance input screen (e.g., 65A or 65B), which<br>
respectively display maintenance items that are classified<br>
66<br>
 <br>
by maintenance intervals (daily, weekly, and monthly<br>
maintenance intervals). The daily maintenance input screen<br>
54 and weekly maintenance input screen 56 have the plurality<br>
of sheets 58 that displays maintenance items classified by<br>
maintenance type, and selectively display one of the<br>
plurality of sheets 58. The monthly maintenance input<br>
screens (e.g., 65A or 65B) display maintenance items<br>
classified according to maintenance type, and have a<br>
plurality of sheets 67 that display maintenance items<br>
classified by maintenance target, and selectively displays<br>
one of the plurality of sheets 67. The use of the above<br>
screen configuration increases maintenance efficiency. The<br>
method for displaying the maintenance items is not limited<br>
to the one described above. The maintenance items to be<br>
displayed may alternatively be classified by maintenance<br>
intervals, maintenance type, maintenance target, or a<br>
combination of these. Such a modified embodiment also<br>
provides the same advantages as the present embodiment<br>
described above.<br>
Moreover, the mobile terminal 34 opens the<br>
outstanding maintenance input screen 68, which extracts and<br>
displays outstanding maintenance items automatically or in<br>
accordance with the worker's operation. This permits the<br>
worker to readily confirm maintenance items that are still<br>
not remedied although they are found to be nonconforming or<br>
have not been inspected although they are due for<br>
maintenance. The outstanding maintenance items may<br>
alternatively be displayed in a different manner (e.g.,<br>
67<br>
 <br>
displayed against a different background color or within a<br>
frame) within, for instance, the daily maintenance input<br>
screen 54, weekly maintenance input screen 56, and monthly<br>
maintenance input screen (e.g., 65A, or 65B) instead of<br>
opening the outstanding maintenance input screen 68. Such a<br>
modified embodiment also provides the same advantages as the<br>
present embodiment described above.<br>
The present embodiment described above assumes that<br>
the tablet mobile terminal 34 is used. Alternatively,<br>
however, a mobile terminal equipped, for instance, with a<br>
keyboard may be used. The use of such an alternative mobile<br>
terminal also provides the same advantages as the present<br>
embodiment. Further, the present embodiment assumes that<br>
the present invention is applied to a huge hydraulic<br>
excavator 1. However, the present invention is not limited<br>
to the use of a huge hydraulic excavator. For example, the<br>
present invention may also be applied to large- or medium-<br>
size excavators for use at various construction work sites<br>
and small-size excavators for use at small-scale work sites.<br>
Further, the present invention is also applicable to cranes<br>
and other machines in addition to hydraulic excavators. The<br>
present invention provides the same advantages even when it<br>
is applied to machines other than huge hydraulic excavators.<br>
