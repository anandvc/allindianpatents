				<td>Composition comprising an HDAC inhibitor in combination with a retinoid<br>
The present invention is directed to compositions, which contain a combination of at least one histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC inhibitor) and a retinoid. The composition is preferably a cosmetic preparation. It was found that the combination of a HDAC inhibitor and a retinoid is in particular useful for treating wrinkies but also for thickening the epidermis, for improving hair growth and lightening the skin up to an even skin tone.<br>
Together, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) determine the acetylation status of histones. The acetylation affects the regulation of gene expression. Inhibitors of HDACs nave been found to alter the transcription of a small number of genes. Histone proteins organize DNA into nucleosomes, which are regular repeating structures of chromatin. The nucleosome contains 146 bp of DNA wrapped around the core histone octamer. The histone octamer is composed of a H3/H4 tetramer and two H2A/H2B dimers. These proteins are very basic and highly conserved throughout evolution. AII 4 core histones nave an amino-terminal tail. This is lysine rich and contains about half of the positively charged residues and rnost of the post-translational modification sites of these histones. The N-terminal tail of the histone passes through and around of the enveloping DNA double helix. It nas been proposed that there is a 'histone code1 or 'epigenetic code' defined by specific modifications of the N-terminal tails such as deacetylation / acetylation, that regulate the transcriptional activity of specific genes. This modification is needed for multiprotein complexes to form the transcription-activating and transcription-repressing molecular machinery.<br>
The acetylation status of chromatin is dependent on both HAT and HDAC activity. HDACs are involved primarily in the repression of gene transcription by virtue of the compaction of chromatin structure that accompanies the removal of charge neutralizing acetyl groups from the histone N-terminal tails.<br>
In humans 3 classes of HDAC have been identified that are mainly divided by their structural homology and might be involved in modeling the structure of chromatin. Class l HDACs includes HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDACS whereas class II includes HDAC4,<br>
HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9 and HDAC10. HDAC class l and II map each to different chromosomal sites and are known to be sensitive for inhibitors. The third class of HDACs is the conserved SIR2 family of proteins (SIRT 1 to 7) that are absolute dependent on NAD* for activity and are insensitive to known inhibitors.<br>
HDAC inhibitors are thought to prolong the hyperacetylated status or induce the hyperacetylation of specific genes via the class l and II enzymes and by the competition between HDAC and HAT to the nucleosomes. By that HDAC inhibitors are inducing or stimulating the transcription of specific genes. Inhibitors of HDACs are proving to be an exciting therapeutic approach to cancer as it was found that they căuşe growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis of many tumor cells by altering the transcription of a small number of genes. One good overview of presently known HDAC inhibitors can be found in Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 2002, 12 (9), pages 1375-1384.<br>
WO 98/00127 discloses certain retinoyloxy-substituted alkylene butyrates and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are said to be suitable for treating cancer and other proliferative diseases. Furthermore, these compounds are said to be useful in methods of inhibiting histone deacetylase, ameliorating wrinkles, treating or ameliorating dermatologica! disorders, inducing wound healing, treating cutaneous ulcers and treating gastrointestinal disorders, A combination of butyric acid and retinoic acid is said to be known as differentiating or anti-proliferating agent for the treatment of cancer. Combinations of a HDAC inhibitor with retinol are not disclosed.<br>
Human skin undergoes certain normal cornification processes, which give the skin its characteristic appearance. Casual factors or externai factors such as a raw climate, wind, photodamage and irritation triggered by the sun, rain and snow, however, disturb this normal condition of the skin, and there appears a roughness, a formation of scales (for example on the scalp), an excessive keratinization and similar phenomena. Furthermore, in the course of aging of the skin various signs appear that are especially reflected by a change in the structure and function of the skin. One of these signs is the appearance of fine lines and deep wrinkles, the size and number of which increase with age. The microrelief of the skin becomes less uniform and is of unisotropic nature. In parallel with age the skin becomes more sensitive towards disturbing influences, either intrinsic or extrinsic, which may result in itch, redness or even darker spots, particular on hands and the facial<br>
area due to pigmentation disorders. These unwanted signs may lead to an undesired age judgment of a person.<br>
Cosmetic preparations are essentially useful for skin care. One aim of skin care in the cosmetic sense is to strengthen or rebuild the skin's natural function as a barrier against environmental influences (e.g. UV-light, dirt, Chemicals and microorganisms) and against the loss of endogenous substances (e.g. water, natural lipids, electrolytes). If this function becomes impaired, increased resorption of toxic or allergenic substances or attack by microorganisms may result, leading to toxic or allergic skin reactions.<br>
Another aim of skin care is to compensate for the loss by the skin of lipids and water caused by daily washing. This is particularly important, if the natural regeneration ability is inadequate. Furthermore, skin care products should protect against environmental influences, in particular against sun and wind, and delay skin aging.<br>
Strengthening or thickening of the epidermis together with an optimized skin barrier lipid synthesis can rebuild the skin's barrier ability and is therefore of significant cosmetic value. Reduced transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is a sign for an intact lipid barrier. Such an intact barrier acts also as first defense line to protect against the appearance of skin wrinkles.<br>
Of particular importance for anti-aging cosmetics is to inhibit the senescence of skin cells in order to keep their regular metabolic level on a constant and beneficia! level.<br>
Another strategy to fight wrinkles is to stimulate the collagen synthesis in the dermis. A number of degradative processes act on the collagen matrix and is triggered by extrinsic factors like UV radiation, pollution in general and particular cigarette smoke or intrinsic factors like chronic and subchronic inflammation. Destruction and/or impaired repair efficacy leads to a denser and less elastic macro structure of the dermis, which in turn leads to the formation of deep wrinkles. Enhancing the de novo synthesis of collagen or other structural proteins of the dermis is considered a valuable therapy to reduce the existing wrinkles and to protect against the appearance of new wrinkles.<br>
Retinoids are known to stimulate collagen synthesis and also to modulate degradative processes for example by reducing the expression of matrix metallo proteases (MMPs) at a<br>
genetic level. It has also been suggested that retinoids are stimulating the formation of the natural MMP inhibitors cal!ed TIMPs, Furthermore retinoids are enhancing ceti renewal and differentiation. By means of those mechanisms retinoids are truly skin anti-aging ingredients. However, even their efficacy is well established, there is a demand in the cosmetic industry tofurther maximize their benefits.<br>
Therefore a variety of combination has been suggested. EP-A 610 511 discloses combinations of viîamin A and an anti-inflammatory agent. HDAC inhibitors are not described. WO 02/02074 and WO 98/13020 disclose that certain compounds enhance the conversion of retinyl esters and retinoi to retinoic acid and are useful in combination with retinoids. The document is not directed to HDAC inhibitors. WO 01/74307 discloses combinaîions of prostaglandin derivatives with vitamin A. HDAC inhibitors are not disclosed. WO 98/36742 discloses the combination and use of Vitamin A and MMP enzyme inhibitors for the treatment of chronological aging effects on human skin, however, HDAC inhibitors are noi mentioned. Retinoi and derivatives thereof in combination with a certain skin lightening acid is known to be useful in the repair of photo-damaged skin or the prevention of photo-damage to skin foliowing the exposure to UV-Jight, see e.g. WO 94/09756. WO 01/08650 discloses the use of certain fatty acids together with certain retinoids. The fatty acids used are effective PPAR agonists as described in US 2003/0003068. Thus, a combination of PPAR agonists with retinoids is also useful, AII combinations mentioned above are state of the art and can be further combined and improved with the present combination of a retinoid with a HDAC inhibitor described in this document.<br>
US 6538030 discloses the use of Phenylbutyric acid and derivatives for the treatment of radiation fibrosis or skin ulcers. It also describes topical formulations. However the document does not mention combinations with retinoids and treatment of age related phenomena.<br>
US 03/0206946 reports the use of HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of inflammation of the skin and provides a therapy for treatment of connective tissue diseases. It also provides compositions for topical treatment. It did not report a combination with a retinoid or the use to treat skin aging.<br>
Hair loss or alopecia is a common affliction of hurnans. The most common form of hair loss in both males and females is patterned boldness or androgenic aiopecia.<br>
Hair follicles range in size from small, superficial, vellus follicles to large, deep, terminal follicles. The cyclic growth phases of hair follicles are telogen (resting), anagen I-III (developing), anagen IV-VI (growing) and catagen (involuting).<br>
In the development of androgenic alopecia there is the gradual diminution of follicle size, with conversion of large, terminal follicles, producing thick, pigmented hair fibers (terminal hair) to small vellus follicles producing fine, non-pigmented hair fibers (vellus hair). In addition, the proportion of growing anagen follicles declines.<br>
There exists a wide variety of literature regarding cosmetic preparations, in particular for cosmetic preparations for treating wrinkles and for promoting hair growth. As examples of the extensive literature it can be referred e.g. to GB 906,000, EP-A 699 429 or WO 03/086342.<br>
WO 98/17273 reports the use of butyric acid and derivatives for the protection of hair loss. The document does not mention a necessity of a particular butyric acid derivative to be also a HDAC inhibitor neither does it mention a combination with a retinoid. Compositions, which contain butyric acid derivatives, often contain small amounts of free butyric acid or such small amounts of free butyric acid develop during storage or application of the composition. Such compositions are disadvantageous for skin and scalp treatment because of the resulting malodor.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present application is the provision of novei compositions, in particular of cosmetic preparations for treating and preventing wrinkles, thickening of the epidermis and preventing and treating of hair loss, but also preparations which are useful against other conditions which are observed with skin aging due to environmental or other externai influences or due to age. The new compositions should have an activity, which is comparable to the activity of known cosmetic preparations but preferably is better than the activity of the prior art preparations.<br>
This problem is solved on the basis of the unexpected finding that a combination of an HDAC inhibitor and a retinoid, in particular with retinal or its precursors described for exampie in WO 97/27836 and EP-A 391033, retinol or a retinol derivative shows synergistic activity in cosmetic applications and related pharmaceutical applications, in particular for<br>
treating and preventmg skin wrinkles, prevention and treatment of hair loss, skin lightening and prevention and treatment of age spots, as well as thickening and fortifying the epidermis, treatment of cellulite, but also for ameliorating the effects of aging of the skin, which may be caused by externai or environmental hazards or by the natural aging of the skin.<br>
It was found that the HDAC inhibitors have excellent effect in cosmetic applications and related pharmaceutical applications, in particular for treating and preventing skin wrinkles, prevention and treatment of hair loss, skin lightening and prevention and treatment of age spots, as well as thickening and fortifying the epidermis, treatment of cellulite, but also for ameliorating the effects of aging of the skin, which may be caused by externai or environmental hazards or by the natural aging of the skin. Therefore, the present appiication is generally directed to compositions, in particular pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions, preferably cosmetic compositions, containing one or more HDAC inhibitors as defined hereinafter which contain a retinoid or which do not contain a retinoid. However, the retinoids show a synergistic effect with the HDAC inhibitors, and therefore, combinations of HDAC inhibitors with a retinoid are preferred. In the foilowing the invention will be described with respect to these combinations of HDAC inhibitors and retinoids, but it should be understood that in all those compositions described herein the retinoid could also be absent.<br>
Accordingly, the present appiication provides a composition comprising at least one HDAC inhibitor in combination with a retinoid and a cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable excipient ordiluent. Preferred are retinoids, which are different from retinoic acid.<br>
HDAC inhibitors are well known in the art and described in many patents and patent applications. The present invention is not restricted to specific HDAC inhibitors. Known HDAC inhibitors can roughly be divided in the subclasses of non-peptide hydroxamic acids, cyclic peptides, benzamides, phenylalkyl carboxylic acids, butyric acid analogues and electrophilic ketones. According to the invention, non-peptide hydroxamic acids, and phenylalkyl carboxylic acids are preferred. Butyric acid analogues can be used according to the invention, but there is the risk that butyric acid is formed during manufacturing, storage or appiication of the cosmetic preparation, which can lead to an unacceptable smell of the product or a person having applied it. Also the raw material has to be purified from free butyric acid down to the ppm range at high costs. Therefore, butyric acid analogues, in<br>
particular the retinoyloxy (substituted) alkylene butyrate compounds disclosed in WO 98/00127 and in particular butyric acid are preferably not present in the cosmetic preparations of the present invention.<br>
A preferred class of HDAC inhibitors are non-peptide hydroxamic acid inhibitors which are disclosed e.g in WO 97/35990, US-A 5,369,108, US-A 5,608,108, US-A 5,700,811, WO 01/18171, WO 98/55449, WO 93/12075, WO 01/49290, WO 02/26696, WO 02/26703, JP 10182583, WO 99/12884, WO 01/38322, WO 01/70675 and WO 02/22577.

The term "composition" as used in the present invention also encompasses an embodiment wherein the composition is present in two separate paris, wherein one part contains the HDAC inhibitor and the other part contains the retinoid. The two separate paris of the composition can be topical compositions or oral compositions or one composition is for topical application and the other is for oral application. Regarding the preparation, the ingredients, the contents and dosages of the separate parts of the composition, it can be referred to the above disclosure regarding the compositions of the present invention which contain both the HDAC inhibitor and the retinoid in admixture.<br>
The ratio of the HDAC inhibitor to the retinoid is preferably 1000:1 to 1:1000, more preferably about 100:1 to 1:100 and in particular 30:1 to 1:30.<br>
The HDAC inhibitors or the retinoid can also be present as hydrates or solvates, and the hydrates and solvates of the active ingredients are also encompassed by the present invention.<br>
The foilowing examples exemplify the invention, but they shouid not be construed as limiting the invention.<br>

Example 57: Biologica! synergism between Retinol and Trichostatin A on human keratinocytes<br>
This example illustrates how the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A and Retinol work synergistically. An in vitro cell culture of human primary keratinocytes has been chosen as test system. This in vitro cell culture model is useful to study differentiation processes and is able to simulate the in vivo situation in human skin (Poumay et al., 1999). To monitor differentiation processes in vitro and in vivo transglutaminase 1 is a well known marker molecule (Polakowska et al., 1999).<br>
Culture of epidermal keratinocytes<br>
Epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from human foreskin biopsies and cultured in keratinocyte serum free rnedium (KSFM made by GIBCO) in a growth chamber with 37°C and 5 % C02 At the second passage, cells were transferred to 6 well plates and allowed to reach approximately 50% surface confluence.<br>
Expression of transglutaminase 1 (TG1) by differentiating keratinocytes<br>
Retinol and TSA were solubilized in ethanol or ethanol/tetrahydrofuran respectively. Retinol solutions were handled under yellow light conditions only. When keratinocyte cultures hâd reached the appropriate confluence, the KSFM medium was supplemented with 1.3 rnM calcium, in order to induce keratinocyte differentiation and thus also induce TG1 expression, and treatment was started with either retinol in concentrations of 1x10-10 M and for TSA at 10-9 M, or the two substances in combination. For every sample, medium and treatment substances were changed twice daily.<br>
Seventy-two hours after the beginning of the treatment, cells were harvested and the RNA extracted. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA. Relative quantification of TG1 mRNA transcript levels in control versus treatment cultures were determined using multiplexed real time PCR analysis. Repression level is given as a multiplicator relative to the non-treated test ceti. The result is shown in figure 1, ROH designates retinol.<br>
Retinol and TSA alone showed only weak modulation of the terminal differentiation process in epidermal keratinocytes. Surprisingly in combination an impressive synergism emerges. The differentiation marker TG1 in human epidermal keratinocytes was more than 6-fold downregulated.<br>
The enzyme transglutaminase 1 is a well-known and accepted differentiation marker in human epidermal cells. Cultures with keratinocytes expressing this marker are a model to simulate the differentiation process of the skin. Slowing this process down results in an improved epidermal thickness. According to the invention a HDAC inhibitor and a retinoid slowed down the process with maximum effect when applied together.<br>
Assessment on collagen production, melanogenesis and lipostasis<br>
Synergism leading to improved collagen production can be assessed with cultured fibroblasts. Influences on melanogenesis can be investigated with cultured melanocytes and changes in the balance of lipolysis and lipogenesis (lipostasis) can be detected with cultured adipocytes.<br>
Assessment of accelerated hair growth and protection hair growth<br>
The ability of the compounds and compositions of the present invention to stimulate or protect hair growth can be investigated with a mouse model described for example in WO 9817273. Instead of using Cyclophosphamide (Neostar, Pharmacia) to damage hairfollicle Mitomycin or Methotrexate can be used. It is also possible to detect hair growth acceleration with newborn mice. They have a synchronized hair cycle and approximately after 3 weeks all hair follicles go into the telogen phase. Then the animals are treated and it is evaluated how fast and to what extend the hair is growing. Similar tests using in vitro or in vivo setups can also be found in J. Invest. Dermato. symposium proceedings 3rd Int. Meeting of Hair Research Societies, 8/1, p.39 - 45 (2003).<br>
It also is possible to perform a clinical study including males suffering from alopecia using the TrichoScan analysis tool described in R. Hoffmann, J. Invest. Dermato. symposium proceedings 3rd Int. Meeting of Hair Research Societies, 8/1, p. 109-115 (2003),<br><br><br><br><br>
