				<td>The invention relates to indole derivatives or benzimidazole derivatives which inhibit kB kinase, to processes for preparing them and to their use as pharmaceuticals.<br>
Patent application WO 94/12478 describes, inter alia, indole derivatives which inhibit blood platelet aggregation. Patent applications WO 01/00610 and WO 01/30-774 describe indole derivatives and benzimidazole derivatives which are able to modulate NFKB_.<br>
NFKB is a heterodimeric transcription factor which is able to activate a large number of genes which encode, inter alia, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, TNFa or IL-6. NFKB is present in the cytosol of cells, where it is complexed with its naturally occurring inhibitor IKB. Stimulation of the cells, for example by cytokines, leads to the IKB being phosphorylated and subsequently broken down proteolytically. This proteolytic breakdown leads to the activation of NFKB, which then migrates into the nucleus of the cell, where it activates a large number of proinflammatory genes. In diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (in connection with inflammation), osteoarthritis, asthma, cardiac infarction, Alzheimer"s diseases, diabetes Type II, "inflammatory bowel disease" or atherosclerosis, NFKB is activated to beyond the normal extent. The inhibition of NFKB is also of value in the treatment of cancer since it is used in such treatment on its own or to augment the cytostatic therapy. It has been demonstrated that pharmaceuticals such as glucocorticoids, salicylates or gold salts, which are used in the therapy of rheumatism, inhibit the NFKB-activating signal chain at various points or interfere directly with the transcription of the genes.<br>
The first step in the abovementioned signal cascade is the breakdown of IKB. This phosphorylation is regulated by the specific IKB kinase. Thus far, no inhibitors are known which inhibit IKB kinase specifically.<br>
The known inhibitors of IKB kinase frequently suffer from the disadvantage of lacking the specificity of inhibiting only one class of kinases. For example, most inhibitors of IKB kinase inhibit several different kinases at the same time because the structures of the catalytic domains of these<br><br>
kinases are similar. Consequently, the inhibitors act, in an undesirable manner, on many enzymes, including those which possess the vital function.<br>
Patent application WO 01/30774 has already described indole derivatives which are able to modulate NFKB and which exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on IKB kinase. However, the compounds which are disclosed in WO01/30774l_and are described in the examples, also exhibit a powerful inhibitory effect on other kinases, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C and casein kinase II. However, when their specificity is improved, some of these indole derivatives then exhibit a decrease in their ability to inhibit IKB kinase. Furthermore, the blood plasma level which can be achieved with the compounds disclosed in WO 01/30774 is insufficient for administering these derivatives orally.<br>
In the endeavor to obtain effective compounds for treating rheumatoid arthritis (in association with inflammation), osteoarthritis, asthma, cardiac infarction, Alzheimer"s diseases, cancer diseases (potentiation of treatments with cytotoxic agents) or atherosclerosis, it has now been found that the indole derivatives and benzimidazole derivatives according to the invention do not suffer from the abovementioned disadvantages. The indole derivatives and benzimidazole derivatives according to the invention are powerful inhibitors of IKB kinase, in this connection inhibiting kinases very selectively, and have a high blood plasma level following oral administration.<br>

The term "halogen" is understood as meaning fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The terms "-(C-|-C5)-alkyl" or "-(C-|-C5)-alkoxy" are understood as meaning hydrocarbon radicals whose carbon chain is straight-chain or branched and contains from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, n-butyl, pentyl or tertiary-butyl. The expression "heteroaryl radical from the group of the unsaturated, partially saturated or completely saturated rings which are derived from pyridine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, pyridazine, pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, isoxazole, thiazole and isothiazole" is understood as meaning, for example, compounds such as piperazine, pyrazoline, imidazoline, pyrazolidine, imidazolidine, tetrahydropyridine, isoxazoline, isoxazolidine, morpholine, isothiazoline, isothiazolidine, tetrahydro-1,4-thiazine or piperidine.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are prepared, for example, as described in patent applications WO 01/00610 and WO 01/30774. Either the starting<br><br>
compounds for the chemical reactions are known or they can be readily prepared using methods known from the literature.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for preparing the compound of the formula I and/or a stereoisomeric form of the compound of the formula I and/or a physiologically tolerated salt of the compound of the Formula I, which comprises a)       reacting a compound of the formula IV,<br><br>
in which R1, R2 and R4 are defined as in formula I, with an acid chloride or an activated ester of the compound of the formula III,<br><br>
where D1 is-COOH and R11, X, M and R3 are defined as in formula I, in the presence of a base or, where appropriate, of a dehydrating agent in solution, and converting the product into a compound of the formula I,<br>
 separating a compound of the formula I, which has been prepared by method a) and which, on account of its chemical structure, appears in enantiomeric forms, into the pure enantiomers by means of forming salts with enantiomerically pure acids or bases, chromatography on chiral stationary phases or derivatization using chiral enantiomerically pure compounds such as amino acids, separating the resulting diastereomers and eliminating the chiral auxiliary groups, or<br>
 either isolating the compound of the formula I which has been prepared by methods a) or b) in free form or, when acidic or basic groups are present, converting it into physiologically tolerated salts.<br><br>
derivatives are prepared using a method described in Houben-Weyl "Methoden der Org. Chemie" [Methods of Org. Chemistry], volume E6-2A or E6-2B. Thus, in order to prepare the indole carboxylic acid derivatives or benzimidazole carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula III, hydrazinobenzoic acids and aryl ketones or heteraryl ketones are preferably reacted at 145°C in the presence of polyphosphoric acid as solvent. The necessary hydrazinobenzoic acids are prepared using methods which are familiar to the skilled person, e.g. from the corresponding benzoic acid anilines; aryl ketones or heteroaryl ketones are also prepared using methods with which the skilled person is familiar, e.g. from the corresponding acid chlorides or nitriles, by reacting them with organometallic compounds, for example.<br>
Coupling methods of peptide chemistry which are well-known per se to the skilled person (see, e.g., Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], volumes 15/1 and 15/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1974), are advantageously used for condensing the compounds of the formula IV with those of the formula III. Compounds such as carbonyldiimidazole, carbodiimide such as dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide or diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), 0-((cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)-methylene)-amino)-N,N,N",N"-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU) or propyl-phosphonic anhydride (PPA) are suitable for use as condensing agents or coupling reagents.<br>
The condensations can be carried out under standard conditions. In the condensation, it is as a rule necessary for the nonreacting amino groups which are present to be protected with reversible protecting groups. The same applies to carboxyl groups which are not involved in the reaction, with these groups preferably being present, during the condensation, as -(Ci-C6)-alkyl esters, benzyl esters or tert-butyl esters. An amino group protection is not necessary if the amino groups are still present in the form of precursors such as nitro groups or cyano groups and are only formed by hydrogenation after the condensation. After the condensation, the protecting groups which are present are eliminated in a suitable manner. For example, NO2 groups (guanidino protection in amino acids), benzyloxycarbonyl groups and benzyl groups in benzyl esters can be eliminated by hydrogenation. The protecting groups of the tert-butyl type<br><br>
are eliminated under acidic conditions while the 9-fluorenylmethyloxy-carbonyl radical is removed using secondary amines.<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceuticals which are characterized by an effective quantity of at least one compound of the formula I and/or a physiologically tolerated salt of the compound of the formula I and/or an optionally stereoisomeric form of the compound of the formula I, together with a pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically tolerated carrier substance, additive and/or other active compounds and auxiliary substances.<br>
Because of their pharmacological properties, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for the prophylaxis and therapy of all those diseases whose course involves an increased activity of IKB kinase. These diseases include, for example, chronic diseases of the locomotory apparatus, such as inflammatory, immunologically or metabolism-mediated acute and chronic arthritides, arthropathies, rheumatoid arthritis, or degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthroses, spondyloses, diabetes Type II, inflammatory bowel disease, loss of cartilage following joint trauma or a relatively long period of joint immobilization following meniscus or patella injuries or ligament ruptures, or diseases of the connective tissue, such as collagenoses and periodontal diseases, myalgias and disturbances of bone metabolism, or diseases which are due to overexpression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) or an increased concentration of TNFa, such as cachexia, multiple sclerosis, craniocerebral trauma, Crohn"s disease and intestinal ulcers, or diseases such as atherosclerosis, stenoses, ulceration, Alzheimer"s diseases, muscle breakdown, cancer diseases (potentiation of treatment with cytotoxic agents), cardiac infarction, gout, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, viral infections such as flu, hepatitis, HIV infections, AIDS, or diseases caused by adenoviruses or herpesviruses, parasitic infections such as malaria or leprosy, fungal or yeast infections, meningites, chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis or asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute synovitis, tuberculosis, psoriasis, diabetes, treatment of acute or chronic rejection reactions on the part of the organ recipient against the transplanted organ, chronic graft-versus-host diseases and inflammatory vascular diseases. The abovementioned diseases can be treated much more specifically, and with a smaller side-effect spectrum, with the compounds which are used in<br><br>
accordance with the invention because it is essentially only IKB kinase which is inhibited.<br>
The pharmaceuticals according to the invention can be administered by means of oral, inhalative, rectal or transdermal administration or by means of subcutaneous, intraarticular, intraperitoneal or intravenous injection. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for producing a pharmaceutical which comprises bringing at least one compound of the formula I together with a pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically tolerated excipient and, where appropriate, other suitable active compounds, additives or auxiliary substances, into a suitable form for administration.<br>
Examples of suitable solid or galenic preparation forms are granules, powders, sugar-coated tablets, tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, juices, suspensions, emulsions, drops or injectable solutions, and also preparations with protracted active compound release, in the preparation of which customary auxiliary substances, such as carrier substances, disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners and solubilizers, are used. Frequently employed auxiliary substances which may be mentioned are magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugars, talc, milk protein, gelatin, starch, cellulose and its derivatives, animal and vegetable oils, such as cod liver oil, sunflower oil, groundnut oil or sesame oil, polyethylene glycol and solvents, such as sterile water and monohydric or polyhydric alcohols, such as glycerol. The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably produced and administered in dosage units, with each unit containing, as the active constituent, a particular dose of the compound of the formula I according to the invention. In the case of solid dosage units, such as tablets, capsules, sugar-coated tablets or suppositories, this dose can be up to about 1 000 mg, preferably from about 50 mg to 300 mg, and, in the case of injection solutions in ampoule form, up to about 300 mg, preferably from about 10 mg to 100 mg. Depending on the activity of the compound according to the formula I, daily doses of from about 20 mg to 1 000 mg of active compound, preferably of from 100 mg to 500 mg, are indicated for treating an adult patient of about 70 kg in weight. However, higher or lower daily doses may also possibly be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered either by means of a<br><br>
once-only administration in the form of a single dosage unit, or of several smaller dosage units, or by means of the multiple administration of subdivided doses at predetermined intervals.<br>
As a rule, mass-spectroscopic methods (FAB-MS, ESI-MS) are used for determining end products. Temperatures are given in degrees centigrade; RT denotes room temperature (from 22°C to 26°C). Abbreviations which are used are either explained or correspond to the customary conventions. The invention is explained in more detail below with the aid of examples.<br>

Pharmacological examples IKB kinase ELISA:<br>
The activity of the IKB kinase was determined using an ELISA which consisted of a biotinylated substrate peptide, which contained the amino acid sequence of the IKB protein from serine 32 to serine 36, and a specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibody (e.g. obtained from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA, cat.: 9240) which only bound to the phosphorylated form of the IKB peptide. This complex was immobilized on an antibody-binding (protein A coated) plate and detected using a conjugate composed of a biotin-binding protein and HRP (e.g. streptavidin-HRP). The activity was quantified with the aid of a standard curve which was constructed using substrate phosphopeptide.<br>
Implementation:<br>
In order to obtain the kinase complex, 10 ml of HeLa S3 cell extract S100 were diluted with 40 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, brought to 40% with respect to ammonium sulfate and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The precipitated pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of SEC buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-glycerophosphate), centrifuged at 20 000 g for 15 minutes and filtered through a 0.22 pm filter. The sample was loaded onto a 320 ml Superose-6 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) which had been equilibrated with SEC buffer and which was operated at 4°C with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions which were located at the migration time of the 670 kDa molecular weight standard were combined for the activation. Activation was achieved by means of a 45-minute incubation with 100 nM MEKK1A, 250 µM MgATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mM 2-glycerophosphate and 2.5 µM microcystin-LR at 37°C. The activated enzyme was stored at -80°C.<br>
The test substances (2 µl), which were dissolved in DMSO, were preincubated, at 25°C for 30 minutes, with 43 µl of activated enzyme (diluted 1:25 in reaction buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM p-glycerophosphate, 2.5 µM microcystin-LR). 5 µl of substrate peptide (biotin-(CH2)6-DRHDSGLDSMKD-CONH2) (200 µM) were then added, after which the mixture was incubated for one hour and the reaction was stopped with 150 µl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA, 50 mM<br><br>
EDTA, antibody [1:200]. 100 µl of the stopped reaction mixture or of a<br>
standard	phosphopeptide        dilution        series        (biotin-(CH2)6-<br>
DRHDS[P03]GLDSMKD-CONH2) were then transferred to a protein A plate (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, USA), after which the plate was incubated for 2 hours while being shaken. After 3 washing steps with PBS, 100 µl of 0.5 jig/ml streptavidin-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (diluted in 50 mM HEPES/0.1% BSA) were added for 30 minutes. After 5 washing steps with PBS, 100 µL of TMB substrate (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were added and the color development was stopped by adding 100 µL of 0.18 M sulfuric acid. The absorption was measured at 450 nm. The standard curve was produced by linear regression corresponding to a 4-parameter dose-effect relationship. This standard curve was used to quantify the enzyme activity or its inhibition by the test substances.<br>

For this, in each case about 25 mg of compound 28 per kg of body weight of the mice, were administered, wet-ground in 0.5% hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), orally as a suspension (by way of a probang). Blood samples were taken after 0.25; 0.5; 1; 2; 4; 6 and 8 hours (sacrificial blood was withdrawn from in each case 2 animals at each of the time points mentioned). The blood samples were converted into heparin plasma. The plasma samples were stored at-20°C until analyzed. Analysis:<br>
The plasma samples were thawed. The plasma proteins which interfered with the analysis were then precipitated with acetonitrile. Processing: 50 µl of plasma + 20 µl of internal standard (5 ng/ml) + 50 µI of buffer (2 mMol ammonium formate solution, pH 2.6/acetonitrile, 40:60, v/v) were mixed for about 10 sec on a Whirlmixer. 150 µl of acetonitrile were<br><br>
then added and the whole was mixed once again for about 10 sec. The<br>
samples were then centrifuged (Hettich, EBA 12, about 12 000 revolutions<br>
per minute). The supematants (in each case about 200 µl) were transferred<br>
to glass tubes. 70 µl of the supernatant were injected.<br>

Protein tyrosine kinase<br>
As examples of the specificities of the IKB kinase inhibitors which had been<br>
discovered, their IC50 values were determined in the case of the kinase<br>
enzyme protein tyrosine kinase.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinase activity was determined using the appropriate test<br>
kit from Upstate Biotechnologie in accordance with the manufacturer"s<br>
instructions and at an ATP concentration of 50 \M. As a difference from the<br>
manufacturer"s method, Multi-Screen plates (Millipore; phosphocellulose<br>
MS-PH, cat. MAPHNOB10, or Durapore PVDF, cat. MADVNOB 50), were<br>
used, together with the appropriate exhaust system, instead of phospho-<br><br>
cellulose filters. Poly (Glu, Tyr 4:1) (Sigma cat. P0275) was used as the test kit substrate at a test concentration of 1 mg/ml. The plates were then measured in a Wallac MicroBeta scintillation counter. 100 µM of the test substance were used in each case.<br>
The test substance was tested in a duplicate determination. The IC50 calculations were performed using the GraFit 3.0 software package.<br>
The IC50 for N-[(S)-2-diphenylamino-1-(5-oxo-4,5-dihydro[1,3,4]oxadiazol-2-yl)ethyl]-2-(2-methylaminopyrimidin-4-yl)-1H-indole-5-carboxamide (compound 28) in the protein tyrosine kinase assay was 82.5 µM.<br>
Comparison experiment: The compound<br><br>
was prepared as described in WO 01/30774 and is termed the comparison compound below. The comparison compound was administered to male NMRI mice. For this, in each case about 50 mg of the comparison compound per kg of body weight of the mice were administered orally as a suspension in 0.5% HEC (by way of a probang). Blood samples were taken after 0.25; 0.5; 1; 2; 4; 6 and 8 hours (sacrificial blood was withdrawn from in each case 2 animals at each of the time points mentioned). The blood samples were converted into heparin plasma. The plasma samples were stored at -20°C until analyzed. Analysis: The analysis was carried out using HPLC/UV.<br>
Processing: 50 µl of plasma + 20 µl of internal standard (5 ug/ml) + 50 µl of buffer (1% formic acid/acetonitrile, 40:60, v/v) were mixed for about 10 sec on a Whirlmixer. 150 µl of acetonitrile were then added and the whole was mixed once again for about 10 sec. The samples were then centrifuged (Hettich, EBA 12, about 12 000 revolutions per min). The supematants (in each case about 200 µl) were transferred to glass tubes. 100 µl of the supernatant were injected.<br><br>
The respective supernatant was used to determine the plasma level content of the comparison compound by means of HPLC/UV in accordance with the following method:<br>

At 0.01 ug/mL, the lower detection limit was identical to that when employing LC-MS/MS in the example using the compound 28.<br>
Results: The plasma level of the comparison compound was at most 1.5 ug/mL. The exposure, measured as the AUC = area under the curve, was 1.7 ug/mL x h.<br>
In comparison with the example using the compound 28, the maximum blood plasma level was about 60% lower in the comparison experiment even though, at 50 mg/kg, the comparison compound was administered at a dose which was twice as high as in the case of compound 28. The AUC values which were determined for the comparison compound also give the same result.<br>
In the above-described protein tyrosine kinase assay, the IC50 for the comparison compound was 46.35 pM. The IC50 is therefore markedly better than in the case of compound 28.<br><br>
The improvement in the specificity with regard to the IKB kinase becomes even clearer when the ratios of the IC50 values for protein tyrosine kinase relative to IKB kinase are compared. In the case of compound 28, this ratio is 1650 (82.5/0.05) while in the case of the comparison compound it is 46.35 (46.35/1.0; in accordance with the data from WO 01/30774).<br>
The specificity ratios and/or plasma levels and exposure of the other examples were determined in an analogous manner.<br><br>
