				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a planar carbon segment commutator for use with<br>
brushes which bear axially against planar contact surfaces of the commutator, instead of<br>
bearing radially as in the case of a cylindrical commutator.<br>
It is known, for example from Indian Patent No. 178 439 (EP 05 83 892) to<br>
provide a planar commutator in which a plurality of commutator terminals are mounted<br>
on a commutator base and overmoulded with carbon segments. However, the terminals<br>
of these known planar commutators each have tangs to which the armature winding of<br>
an electric motor has to be connected.<br>
A number of known methods for effecting such connections are in popular use.<br>
Where the winding is formed of low temperature wire, it is usual to employ a soft solder<br>
and flux method. Alternatively a cold crimp onto wire that has been stripped of insulation<br>
is used in order effect a connection. When dealing with high temperature wires it is<br>
necessary to apply heat, and also possibly to apply flux so as to remove the coating of<br>
insulation from the ends of the wire.<br>
However, there are a number of inherent problems and undesirable side effects<br>
associated with all of the foregoing methods.<br>
Heat causes embrittlement of the copper wire which is used for most armature<br>
windings and encourages rapid oxidation. The use of heat also demands a strong<br>
structure to support the commutator in order to minimise plastic distortion. This<br>
requirement usually demands the use of high temperature compression grade<br>
moulding material. A further common problem is caused by the accidental stripping<br>
of insulation during winding of the armature which is often automated. As the<br>
wire passes over the metal of the commutator damage can be caused to the wire<br>
insulation and such damage will often be manifest as a short circuited winding.<br>
Additionally, there is always a danger of slack in the winding wire causing fretting under<br>
the acceleration due to centrifugal and inertial forces.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a planar carbon segment<br>
commutator comprising :<br>
a commutator base of insulating material, the base having a rotational axis and<br>
front and rear surfaces extending, at least in part, transversely to the rotational axis ;<br>
a plurality of commutator terminals each of which comprises a terminal portion<br>
and a contact portion ; and<br>
a plurality of carbon segments formed on the front surface of the base and over<br>
the contact portions, respectively, of the terminals,<br>
characterised in that the contact portion of each terminal extends through a<br>
respective first aperture in the base and is bent to lie against or in close proximity to the<br>
front surface of the base, and the terminal portion of each terminal has a cutting edge<br>
for cutting insulation on a connector portion of a winding and a slot which, in use,<br>
straddles and grips said connector portion.<br>
Preferably, the commutator includes a housing having a plurality of housing<br>
recesses for receiving respective terminal portions.<br>
Preferably, each housing recess has associated therewith means for positioning<br>
connector portions of the winding relative to each recess, the base, the terminals and<br>
the housing being such that with a single translational movement of the base relative to<br>
the housing, the terminal portions enter the housing recesses, the cutting edges strip<br>
insulation from connector portions of the winding and the slots establish and maintain<br>
electrical contact with connector portions of the winding by insulation displacement.<br>
Preferably, the base has a cylindrical skirt extending rearwardly of its rear<br>
surface for receiving the housing.<br>
Preferably, the front surface of the base has a plurality of recesses and each<br>
contact portion overlies a respective recess and has at least one aperture through which<br>
material forming a respective commutator segment extends into the recess to assist in<br>
anchoring the segment to the terminal.<br>
Preferably, the base has a plurality of second apertures communicating with the<br>
recesses and through which material forming the commutator segments extends to<br>
assist in anchoring the segments to the base.<br>
Preferably, the base has a plurality of third apertures through which material<br>
forming the commutator segments extends to assist in anchoring the commutator<br>
segments to the base.<br>
The invention will now be more particularly described, by way of example, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view from the front and side of a commutator base of<br>
one embodiment of a planar commutator according to a first aspect of the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view from the rear and one side of the commutator<br>
base shown in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a plan view of the assembled commutator;<br>
Figure 4 is an underneath plan view of the assembled commutator;<br>
Figure 5 is a section taken along the line A - A of Figure 3;<br>
Figure 6 is a section taken along the line B - B of Figure 4;<br>
Figure 7 is a perspective view of a commutator terminal on an enlarged scale;<br>
Figure 8 is a developed view of the terminal shown in Figure 7;<br>
Figure 9 is a perspective view of a housing for the terminals; and<br>
Figure 10 is a fragmentary sectional view of part of the housing of Figure 9.<br>
The commutator shown in the drawings is intended for use with small electric<br>
motors, particularly permanent magnet dc motors.<br>
Referring firstly to Figures 1 and 2, the commutator base 10 shown therein is of<br>
moulded material and comprises a circular front wall 11 and a cylindrical skirt 12<br>
extending rearwardly from the front wall 11. The base 10 also has a central boss 13 by<br>
which the base 10 can be fitted to an armature shaft (not shown).<br>
A plurality of circumferentially spaced axially extending ribs 14 are provided<br>
on the inner surface of the skirt 12, for a purpose that will be explained later.<br>
The front wall 11 has a central aperture 45 aligned with the boss 13, eight, equi-<br>
angularly spaced, elongate radially extending recesses 15 and an elongate, slit-like,<br>
aperture 16 radially aligned with each recess 15.<br>
Each recess 15 communicates at its radially inner end with an aperture 17.<br>
Each recess 15 is also associated with two apertures 18, one on either side of a<br>
respective recess 15 and adjacent its radially outer end.<br>
The front wall 11 also has an outer ring of angularly spaced apart slots 19.<br>
The commutator terminal 20 shown in Figures 7 and 8 comprises a terminal<br>
portion 21 and a contact portion 22. The contact portion 22 is in the form of a finger<br>
having three apertures 23,24 and 25 therein. The terminal portion 21 is rectangular (as<br>
shown in developed view) with its minor axis coincident with the longitudinal axis of<br>
the contact portion 22. The terminal portion 21 has a central cut out portion 26 which<br>
is symmetrical with respect to both the major and minor axes of the terminal portion 21.<br>
The cut out portion 26 reduces from its largest width at the centre of the terminal<br>
portion 21 to two slots 27. Two cutters 28 project a short distance into each slot 27.<br>
These cutters 28 form sharp edges for cutting insulation on a connector portion of an<br>
armature winding. The terminal portion 21 also has two barbs 29 for a purpose which<br>
will become apparent later.<br>
To assemble the terminals 20 to the base 10, the fingers 22 are pressed through<br>
respective apertures 16 in the base 10 and the fingers 22 are then bent over respective<br>
recesses 15 to extend radially inwards.<br>
Carbon commutator segments 30 are then formed on the front wall 11 of the<br>
commutator base 10 over the fingers 22. This may be achieved by hot pressing a disc<br>
of green graphite material onto the front wall 11 and then cutting the disc into eight<br>
individual segments 30. Green graphite material is a graphite mixture prior to sintering<br>
or heat treating during which the binder material is set. During the hot pressing, the<br>
binder is softened (possibly liquified) and this allows the mixture to flow under<br>
pressure through the apertures 23, 24 and 25 in the fingers 22 and into the recesses 15,<br>
into the slots 19 and through the apertures 17 and 18, as best shown in Figures 5 and 6,<br>
to anchor the disc to the base 10. The binder, being of thermoset material such as<br>
phenolic resin, once melted and cooled becomes heat resistant, creating a stable contact<br>
surface for the commutator. As an alternative to the hot pressing process an<br>
overmoulding process can be used. In this latter process, the components, namely the<br>
commutator base 10 and the terminals 20 are placed into a mould and graphite material<br>
is injected into the mould after the latter has been closed. The hot pressing or moulding<br>
process creates a good electrical connection with the fingers 22.<br>
Referring now to Figures 9 and 10, there is shown therein a housing 35 for the<br>
terminal portions 21 of the terminals 20. This housing 35 is of crown-like shape and<br>
has a central boss 36 for receiving the armature shaft and eight radially outwardly<br>
extending housing portions 37 equally spaced around the circumference of the boss 36.<br>
Each of the housing portions 37 defines a housing recess 38 and is used to effect<br>
connection between a respective portion of the armature winding and one of the<br>
terminal portions 21 of the terminals 20. Each housing portion 37 has side walls 39, an<br>
end wall 40, and a cover 41. The side walls 39 are parallel to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the boss 36.<br>
A stump 42 projects centrally from the internal surface of the end wall 40 and<br>
extends within the housing portion 37 for approximately half the length of the side walls<br>
39. The stump 42 extends parallel with the longitudinal axis of the boss 36 and is only<br>
connected to the housing 35 by the end wall 40. Each side wall 39 has a slot 43 which<br>
extends parallel to the longitudinal axis of the boss 36, from the commutator end of the<br>
housing 35 for a length which terminates at the level of the free end of the stump 42. A<br>
portion of an armature winding can be passed through the slots 43 so that the winding<br>
portion rests on the end of the stump.  /<br>
During assembly of the armature of an electric motor, the housing 35 is placed<br>
on the armature shaft. The lead wire of the armature winding is inserted into one of the<br>
housing portions 37 by laying the end of the wire in the slots 43 provided in the side<br>
walls 39. The wire is drawn back into the housing portion 37 until it rests against the<br>
stump 42. From this start, the first armature coil is wound. At the end of the first coil<br>
winding, the armature is indexed and the wire is laid in the same manner in the next<br>
housing portion 37 without breaking the continuity of the wire. This process is repeated<br>
until all coils have been wound and the tail end of the winding is then laid in the slots<br>
43 of the first housing portion 37 and pushed back until it is adjacent to the lead end<br>
which was placed against the stump 42 at the beginning of the winding operation. The<br>
wire is then cut and the armature removed from the winding machine.<br>
The housing 35 now has a winding portion comprising insulated wire laying in<br>
each of the housing portions 37. Each of the winding portions is under tension and is<br>
pulled tight against the respective stump 42. The commutator base 10, together with<br>
the terminals 20 and commutator segments 30, is then slid along the armature shaft so<br>
that the terminal portions 21 of the terminals enter respective housing portions 37 and<br>
the housing portions lie between the ribs 14. As each terminal portion 21 approaches<br>
a winding portion held in a housing portion 37, the slots 27 move over the wire. The<br>
cutters 28 severe the insulation on the wire which is deformed as the slots move over<br>
the wire. Intimate metal to metal contact is thereby provided between the wire and the<br>
terminal portions 20. The barbs 29 grip the cover 41 of the housing 35 and therefore<br>
retain the terminal portions 21 within the housing 35.<br>
This manner of manufacture of a commutator lends itself to an automated<br>
process. No application of heat is required and the associated risk of distorting the<br>
housing 35 is therefore avoided. No embrittlement of the winding wire is caused and<br>
problems associated with oxidation are also avoided. The use of flux is negated and<br>
there is no chemical reaction or consequent erosion resulting from the connection. The<br>
armature winding can be a single continuous winding and the danger of introducing<br>
slack by breaking the winding to effect a connection to each coil can be avoided.<br>
The above embodiment is given by way of example only and various modifications will<br>
be apparent to persons skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
