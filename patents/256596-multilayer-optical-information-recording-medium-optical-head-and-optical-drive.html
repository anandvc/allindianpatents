DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to a<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium, an optical<br>
head, and an optical drive, and more particularly relates<br>
to a multilayer optical information recording medium with<br>
multiple recording layers, an optical head for the<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium, and an<br>
optical drive capable of recording, reproducing, and/or<br>
deleting information on the multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Patent document 1 discloses a method of optically<br>
writing, reading, and/or deleting information on a<br>
conventional multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium having at least two recording layers and two guide<br>
layers; and an apparatus for writing, reading, and/or<br>
deleting information on the conventional multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium. FIG. 14 shows the structure<br>
of an exemplary recording medium described in patent<br>
document 1. The exemplary recording medium includes<br><br>
multiple recording layers 3 and one tracking layer (control<br>
layer) 5 for the multiple recording layers 3.<br>
Patent document 2 discloses a recording medium<br>
made by stacking control layers used for tracking and<br>
layers made of a photosensitive material. Patent document 3<br>
discloses an optical memory device in which a recording<br>
layer is provided next to a core layer made of resin or a<br>
clad layer made of resin and a barrier layer is provided<br>
between the recording layer and the core layer or the clad<br>
layer to prevent them from blending.<br>
Also, patent document 4 discloses a multilayer<br>
optical recording medium made by stacking recording layers<br>
and non-recording layers alternately using adhesive sheets<br>
each made up of an optical recording layer containing a<br>
photosensitive material and an adhesive layer.<br>

However, in a multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium having a structure as described above, as<br>
the number of layers increases, fluctuation of reflectance<br><br>
caused by differences in the wavelength or incidence angle<br>
of light becomes greater and wavelength dependence becomes<br>
greater. In other words, the amount of reflected light in<br>
recording or reading a signal fluctuates depending on the<br>
wavelength or incidence angle of the light. This<br>
fluctuation causes an increase in noise and results in a<br>
decrease in the S/N ratio.<br>
Also, in a multilayer optical recording medium<br>
with a control layer used for tracking as shown in FIG. 14,<br>
as the number of recording layers increases, the distance<br>
between each recording layer and the control layer<br>
increases. This makes it difficult to position a laser beam<br>
accurately.<br>
Further, since the recording layers are formed<br>
just above the control layer, methods that can be used to<br>
process the control layer are limited and therefore<br>
flexibility in designing the control layer is reduced.<br>
Meanwhile, in recent years, with the development<br>
of digital technologies and the improvement in data<br>
compression techniques, optical disks such as a digital<br>
versatile disk (DVD) have gotten a lot of attention as<br>
media for recording information such as music, movies,<br>
photographs, and computer programs (hereafter, may also be<br>
called "contents"). Also, as the prices of optical disks<br><br>
become lower, optical drives for recording and/or<br>
reproducing information on optical disks have become<br>
widespread.<br>
As the data sizes of contents increase year by<br>
year, there is an increasing demand for an optical disk<br>
with higher storage capacity. One way to increase the<br>
storage capacity of an optical disk is to provide multiple<br>
recording layers. Currently, development of optical disks<br>
having multiple recording layers (hereafter, may also be<br>
called "multilayer disks" or "multilayer optical disks")<br>
and optical drives for recording/reproducing information on<br>
such multilayer disks are very active.<br>
However, if the number of recording layers in a<br>
conventional optical disk is increased, the amount of light<br>
reflected from a recording layer decreases as the distance<br>
between the recording layer and the incidence plane<br>
increases, because light is absorbed by other recording<br>
layers. As a result, the amount of light reflected from a<br>
distant recording layer decreases to such a level that it<br>
is difficult to detect a signal. Also, a conventional laser<br>
diode may not be powerful enough to record information on<br>
such a multilayer optical disk. These problems have been<br>
limiting the number of recording layers in an optical disk.<br>
To solve the above problems and thereby to<br>
increase the number of recording layers, multilayer disks<br><br>
using two-photon absorption materials have been proposed<br>
(see, for example, patent documents 5 and 6). The<br>
refractive index of a two-photon absorption material<br>
changes when it absorbs two photons simultaneously. The<br>
proposed multilayer disks utilize this characteristic of<br>
two-photon absorption materials. On a proposed multilayer<br>
disk, information is recorded by changing the refractive<br>
index of target areas. These refractive index changed areas<br>
are called pits. More specifically, information is<br>
represented by the lengths and combination of refractive<br>
index changed areas and refractive index unchanged areas.<br>
The probability of occurrence of two-photon<br>
absorption is proportional to the square of an applied<br>
optical-electric field (intensity of an incident light).<br>
Therefore, two-photon absorption occurs only in an area<br>
where the energy of an incident light is concentrated. When<br>
an incident light is focused by a lens, two-photon<br>
absorption occurs only around the focal point and does not<br>
occur in other areas where the incident light is not<br>
focused. In other words, the refractive indices of<br>
recording layers other than that on which incident light is<br>
focused do not change and those recording layers transmit<br>
the incident light without changing its intensity.<br>
Therefore, in this case, increasing the number of recording<br><br>
layers does not make it difficult to detect a signal or<br>
cause recording power shortage problems.<br>
Thus, using two-photon absorption materials makes<br>
it possible to increase the number of recording layers and<br>
thereby to greatly increase the storage capacity of an<br>
optical disk. However, as in the case of conventional<br>
multilayer disks, forming guide tracks on each of the<br>
recording layers results in increased costs.<br>
To obviate this problem, multilayer disks having<br>
guide tracks on a layer other than recording layers have<br>
been proposed (see, for example, patent documents 7 and 8).<br>
Patent document 7 discloses a recording medium<br>
having a servo layer. With the disclosed recording medium,<br>
servo control is performed by detecting reflected light<br>
from the servo layer. However, if the recording medium is<br>
tilted in the radial direction in relation to the incidence<br>
angle of light, a tracking error may occur on a data layer<br>
that is distant from the servo layer. For example, on a<br>
data layer that is 1 mm distant from the servo layer, when<br>
the recording medium is tilted 1 degree in relation to the<br>
incidence angle of the light, the focal point of the light<br>
is shifted as much as 17.4 µm. On a Blu-ray disk with a<br>
track pitch of 0.32 µm, 17.4 µm is equivalent to about 50<br>
tracks. For this reason, the recording medium disclosed in<br>
patent document 7 requires a tilt control that is different<br><br>
from that for a recording medium with a few recording<br>
layers. Also, although a small light spot can be formed on<br>
a data layer where a two-photon absorption material is used,<br>
a light spot becomes large on the servo layer where no two-<br>
photon absorption material is used. This problem makes it<br>
difficult to increase the track density of a recording<br>
medium and thereby makes it difficult to increase the<br>
storage capacity per data layer.<br>
Patent document 8 discloses an optical information<br>
recording medium including a first layer having alternate<br>
convexities and concavities and a second layer having<br>
alternate convexities and concavities. In this case,<br>
however, it is very difficult to accurately align the<br>
convexities and concavities on the first and second layers.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention are<br>
described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a drawing illustrating the configuration<br>
of a first exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The first embodiment of the present<br>
invention is described below with reference to FIG. 1. As<br>
shown in FIG. 1, in the first exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium, a first middle layer 2, a<br>
first recording layer 3, a second middle layer 2, and a<br>
second recording layer 3 are stacked on a substrate 1. In a<br>
similar manner, for example, five recording layers 3 and<br>
six middle layers 2 are stacked to form a recording layer<br>
unit. Further, a separating layer (spacer layer) 4 is<br>
stacked on the recording layer unit. Thus, the first<br>
exemplary multilayer optical information recording medium<br>
is produced by stacking multiple recording layer units and<br>
one or more spacer layers 4 alternately on the substrate 1.<br>
To form a recording mark on the recording layer 3<br>
of the first exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium, light with a light source wavelength is<br><br>
focused (a light spot is formed) on the recording layer 3<br>
using an objective lens.<br>
In this embodiment, the recording layer 3 may be<br>
made of a material the refractive index of which is<br>
increased by a light spot or a material the refractive<br>
index of which is decreased by a light spot. The thickness<br>
of the recording layer 3 is preferably smaller than the<br>
depth of a light spot. On the other hand, the thickness of<br>
the middle layer 2 is preferably equal to or larger than<br>
the depth of a light spot.<br>
The refractive index in an area where a recording<br>
mark is formed and the refractive index in an area where no<br>
recording mark is formed are different. Therefore, the<br>
reflectance at the surface boundary between the middle<br>
layer 2 and the recording layer 3 differs depending on<br>
whether a recording mark is formed. The difference in<br>
reflectance results in the difference in intensity of<br>
reflected light. Information on the first exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium is read as<br>
the difference in intensity of reflected light.<br>
For the substrate 1, materials such as glass,<br>
crystalline oxide, polycarbonate, and polyolefin that are<br>
transparent to a light source wavelength may be used. For<br>
the middle layer 2, a material that is transparent to a<br>
light source wavelength may be used. For the recording<br><br>
layer 3, a material that absorbs a part of light with a<br>
light source wavelength may be used. The middle layer 2 is,<br>
for example, formed by applying a resin such as polyvinyl<br>
alcohol or ethylene vinyl alcohol. Also, the middle layer 2<br>
may also be formed by fusion-bonding, extruding, laminating,<br>
or vapor-depositing a transparent resin, such as<br>
polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyamide, epoxy, or urethane<br>
resin, or its film.<br>
Further, the material for the middle layer 2 is<br>
not limited to organic materials. The middle layer 2 may be<br>
formed by vapor-depositing or sputtering a material such as<br>
glass or an oxide. The recording layer 3 may be formed by<br>
applying or vapor-depositing a mixture of a resin, such as<br>
polymethyl methacrylate or polystyrene, and a photochromic<br>
dye, such as spiropyran, diarylethene, or fulgide, the<br>
refractive index or absorption wavelength of which changes<br>
by absorption of light with a specific light source<br>
wavelength. On a recording layer containing a photochromic<br>
dye, information can be recorded by causing multiphoton<br>
absorption, for example, two-photon absorption, using a<br>
short pulse, high-power laser. The separating layer (spacer<br>
layer) 4 may be formed using substantially the same method<br>
and materials as those used for forming the middle layer 2.<br>
Also, the spacer layer 4 may be an adhesive layer or a<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer.<br><br>
Also, a barrier layer (not shown) may be provided<br>
between the recording layer 3 and the middle layer 2. The<br>
barrier layer prevents a solvent used in one layer from<br>
dissolving the other layer and thereby makes it possible to<br>
form each layer by applying a solution. In other words, the<br>
barrier layer makes it easer to form the recording layer 3<br>
and the middle layer 2. The barrier layer may also make it<br>
easier to reduce the thickness of the recording layer 3 and<br>
the middle layer 2 to increase light transmission.<br>
The characteristics of the first exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium are<br>
described below with reference to FIGs. 2 and 3. FIG. 2 is<br>
a graph showing the relationship between the number of<br>
layers in the first exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium shown in FIG. 1 and its<br>
reflectance. More specifically, the graph shows changes in<br>
the reflectance, measured from the side opposite to the<br>
substrate 1, when the total number of the middle layers 2<br>
and the recording layers 3 is changed between 5 and 50. The<br>
changes in the reflectance are calculated by just changing<br>
the total number of the middle layers 2 and the recording<br>
layers 3 without taking into account the effects of the<br>
spacer layer 4 and the substrate 1.<br>
In the calculation, refractive index n2 of the<br>
recording layer 3 is set to 1.6, refractive index n3 of the<br><br>
middle layer 2 is set to 1.5, and light source wavelength λ<br>
is set to 0.66 µm. In FIG. 2, the solid line shows the<br>
reflectances when the thickness of the recording layer 3 is<br>
λ/4n2 and the thickness of the middle layer 2 is an odd<br>
multiple of λ/4n3; and the dotted line shows the<br>
reflectances when the thicknesses of the recording layer 3<br>
and the middle layer 2 are slightly different from λ/4n2<br>
and an odd multiple of λ/4n3.<br>
As the graph shows, when the thickness of the<br>
middle layer 2 is an odd multiple of λ/4n3, the reflectance<br>
of the first exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium increases sharply as the total number of<br>
layers increases. This means that light cannot reach a<br>
layer that is distant from the side opposite to the<br>
substrate 1 and is therefore not preferable.<br>
FIG. 3 is a graph showing the relationship between<br>
the thickness of the middle layer 2 and the reflectance of<br>
the first exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium. In this calculation, the thickness of the<br>
recording layer 3 is fixed at λ /4n2 and the thickness of<br>
the middle layer 2 is varied. The reflectance at five<br>
layers is indicated by a dotted arrow and the reflectance<br>
at 50 layers is indicated by a solid arrow. The exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium used in<br>
this calculation includes 10 recording layer units each<br><br>
composed of five layers. As the graph shows, with a large<br>
number of layers, the reflectance becomes high when the<br>
middle layer 2 has one of certain thicknesses that exist at<br>
regular intervals.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferable to avoid a<br>
combination of a thickness and a refractive index (optical<br>
path length: the product of a thickness and a refractive<br>
index) of the middle layer 2 which combination results in<br>
increased reflectance as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Also, when producing a multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium by stacking multiple recording<br>
layer units each composed of at least one recording layer 3<br>
and one middle layer 2, the thicknesses and the refractive<br>
indices of the middle layers 2 among the recording layer<br>
units are not necessarily the same and are preferably<br>
varied. Further, the optical path length (the product of a<br>
thickness and a refractive index) of the spacer layer 4 is<br>
preferably an even multiple of λ/2.<br>
When a recording medium is produced by alternately<br>
stacking recording layer units and the spacer layers 4, the<br>
spacer layer 4 with the optical path length as described<br>
above contributes to preventing the decrease in light<br>
transmission of the recording medium even when each of the<br>
recording layer units have a high reflectance.<br><br>
FIG. 4 is a drawing illustrating the configuration<br>
of a second exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The second embodiment of the present<br>
invention is described below with reference to FIG. 4. As<br>
shown in FIG. 4, in the second exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium, a first recording layer 3 is<br>
formed on a substrate 1. In the first recording layer 3,<br>
recording marks 3a, which are recording spots each having a<br>
refractive index different from the surrounding area, are<br>
horizontally arranged at intervals; and layers of the<br>
horizontally arranged recording marks 3a are vertically<br>
(perpendicularly to the substrate 1) arranged at regular<br>
intervals.<br>
In this embodiment, the recording layer 3 in which<br>
the recording marks 3a are horizontally and vertically<br>
arranged at intervals is treated as a recording layer unit.<br>
A spacer layer 4 is stacked on the recording layer 3. On<br>
the spacer layer 4, a second recording layer 3 is stacked.<br>
As in the first recording layer 3, the recording marks 3a<br>
are horizontally and vertically arranged at intervals in<br>
the second recording layer 3. Another spacer layer 4 is<br>
stacked on the second recording layer 3. Thus, the second<br>
exemplary multilayer optical information recording medium<br><br>
is produced by alternately stacking the recording layers 3<br>
and the spacer layers 4.<br>
The recording mark 3a is formed by focusing light<br>
with a light source wavelength (by forming a light spot) on<br>
the recording layer 3 using an objective lens. In this<br>
embodiment, the recording layer 3 may be made of a material<br>
the refractive index of which is increased by a light spot<br>
or a material the refractive index of which is decreased by<br>
a light spot. The refractive index in the recording mark 3a<br>
and the refractive index in the surrounding area are<br>
different. Therefore, the reflectance in an area differs<br>
depending on whether a recording mark is formed. The<br>
difference in reflectance results in the difference in<br>
intensity of reflected light. Information on the second<br>
exemplary multilayer optical information recording medium<br>
is represented by the difference in intensity of reflected<br>
light.<br>
For the substrate 1, the same materials described<br>
in the first embodiment may be used. The recording layer 3<br>
may be formed by applying or vapor-depositing a mixture of<br>
a resin, such as polymethyl methacrylate or polystyrene,<br>
and a photochromic dye, such as spiropyran, diarylethene,<br>
or fulgide, the refractive index or absorption wavelength<br>
of which changes by absorption of light with a specific<br>
light source wavelength. On a recording layer containing a<br><br>
photochromic dye, information can be recorded by causing<br>
multiphoton absorption, for example, two-photon absorption,<br>
using a short pulse, high-power laser. The separating layer<br>
(spacer layer) 4 may be formed using substantially the same<br>
method and materials as those used for forming the middle<br>
layer 2 in the first embodiment. Also, the middle layer 2-<br>
in the first embodiment may be used instead of the spacer<br>
layer 4.<br>
The second exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium has characteristics similar to<br>
those of the first exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium shown in FIGs. 2 and 3. The interval<br>
(distance) between the layers of the recording marks 3a in<br>
the second embodiment corresponds to the thickness of the<br>
middle layer 2 in the first embodiment. When the interval<br>
between the layers of the recording marks 3a is an odd<br>
multiple of λ/4n2 (λ is the light source wavelength and n2<br>
is the refractive index of the recording layer 3), the<br>
reflectance of the second exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium increases sharply as the<br>
number of the layers of the recording marks 3a increases.<br>
This means that light cannot reach a layer that is distant<br>
from the side opposite to the substrate 1 and is therefore<br>
not preferable.<br><br>
Also, with a large number of layers, the<br>
reflectance becomes high when the interval between the<br>
layers of the recording marks 3a takes certain values that<br>
exist at regular intervals. Accordingly, it is preferable<br>
to avoid a combination of an interval between the layers of<br>
the recording marks 3a and a refractive index of the<br>
recording layer 3 (optical path length: the product of an<br>
interval and a refractive index) which combination results<br>
in increased reflectance.<br>
Also, when producing a multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium by stacking multiple recording<br>
layer units each composed of one recording layer 3, the<br>
intervals between the layers of the recording marks 3a and<br>
the refractive indices of the recording layers 3 among the<br>
recording layer units are not necessarily the same and are<br>
preferably varied. Further, the optical path length (the<br>
product of a thickness and a refractive index) of the<br>
spacer layer 4 is preferably an even multiple of 1/2.<br>
When a recording medium is produced by alternately<br>
stacking multiple recording layer units, each of which is<br>
composed of one recording layer 3 in which the recording<br>
marks 3a are horizontally and vertically arranged at<br>
intervals, and the spacer layers 4, the spacer layer 4 with<br>
the optical path length as described above contributes to<br>
preventing the decrease in light transmission of the<br><br>
recording medium even when each of the recording layer<br>
units have a high reflectance.<br>
FIG. 5 is a drawing illustrating the configuration<br>
of a third exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium according to a third embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The third embodiment of the present<br>
invention is described below with reference to FIG. 5. As<br>
shown in FIG. 5, the third exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium has a structure similar to<br>
that of the first exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium shown in FIG. 1, except that a first<br>
adhesive layer 6, a control layer 5, and a second adhesive<br>
layer 6 are formed between the substrate 1 and the middle<br>
layer 2. Grooves used for tracking are formed on the<br>
control layer 5 and the refractive index of the control<br>
layer 5 is different from that of the adhesive layer 6. The<br>
refractive index of the control layer 5 may be higher or<br>
lower than that of the adhesive layer 6.<br>
On the second adhesive layer 6, the middle layers<br>
2 and the recording layers 3 are stacked alternately as in<br>
the first exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium. Also, the spacer layer 4 is stacked on<br>
top of them. The third exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium is produced by stacking sets<br>
of the above mentioned layers.<br><br>
In the third embodiment, a recording layer unit is<br>
made up of five recording layers 3 and six middle layers 2,<br>
and one control layer 5 is provided for each recording<br>
layer unit. However, the present invention is not limited<br>
to this configuration. As a value obtained by a formula<br>
[(thickness of recording layer 3) x number of layers +<br>
(thickness of middle layer 2) x number of layers] increases,<br>
the distance between the control layer 5 and the most<br>
distant recording layer 3 increases. In a tracking method<br>
that uses light beams from two light sources, a large<br>
distance between the control layer 5 and the recording<br>
layer 3 results in a low accuracy in positioning a light<br>
spot of a recording light beam. For this reason, the number<br>
of layers in a recording layer unit is preferably no more<br>
than 100.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 5, grooves<br>
are formed on a surface of the control layer 5, which<br>
surface is closer to the substrate 1, to detect a tracking<br>
error using a push-pull method. However, grooves may be<br>
formed on the opposite surface of the control layer 5. Also,<br>
tracking guides formed by refractive index modulation may<br>
be used instead of grooves. Further, the pattern of the<br>
grooves is not limited to a specific pattern. For example,<br>
the grooves may be formed concentrically or spirally.<br><br>
Other configurations and characteristics of the<br>
third exemplary multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium are substantially the same as those of the first<br>
exemplary multilayer optical information recording medium.<br>
The control layer 5 may be formed by applying a UV curing<br>
resin and by pressing a transparent stump with a patterned<br>
indented surface onto the applied UV curing resin. For the<br>
adhesive layer 6, an adhesive or a pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive made of resin may be used.<br>
FIG. 6 is a drawing illustrating the configuration<br>
of a fourth exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium according to a fourth embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The fourth embodiment of the present<br>
invention is described below with reference to FIG. 6. The<br>
fourth exemplary multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium is produced by adding the control layers 5 and the<br>
adhesive layers 6 according to the third embodiment shown<br>
in FIG. 5 to the structure of the second exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium shown in<br>
FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 6, the first adhesive layer 6, the<br>
control layer 5, and the second adhesive layer 6 are formed<br>
between the substrate 1 and the first recording layer 3,<br>
and between the spacer layer 4 and the second recording<br>
layer 3. Other configurations and characteristics of the<br>
fourth exemplary multilayer optical information recording<br><br>
medium are substantially the same as those of the second<br>
and third exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording media.<br>
FIG. 7 is a drawing illustrating the configuration<br>
of a fifth exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium according to a fifth embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The fifth embodiment of the present<br>
invention is described below with reference to FIG. 7. The<br>
fifth exemplary multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium has a structure similar to that of the first<br>
exemplary multilayer optical information recording medium<br>
shown in FIG. 1, except that spacer layers 4-1 and 4-2 have<br>
different thicknesses. The optical path lengths of the<br>
spacer layers 4 may be varied by changing their refractive<br>
indices instead of changing their thicknesses. Other<br>
configurations and characteristics of the fifth exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium are<br>
substantially the same as those of the first exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium. The<br>
difference in thickness between the spacer layers 4 is<br>
preferably, but not limited to, about 0 to λ/2 or more in<br>
terms of optical path length.<br>
FIG. 8 is a drawing illustrating the configuration<br>
of a sixth exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium according to a sixth embodiment of the<br><br>
present invention. The sixth embodiment of the present<br>
invention is described below with reference to FIG. 8. The<br>
sixth exemplary multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium has a structure similar to that of the second<br>
exemplary multilayer optical information recording medium<br>
shown in FIG. 4, except that spacer layers 4-1 and 4-2 have<br>
different thicknesses. The optical path lengths of the<br>
spacer layers 4 may be varied by changing their refractive<br>
indices instead of changing their thicknesses. Other<br>
configurations and characteristics of the sixth exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium are<br>
substantially the same as those of the second exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium. The<br>
difference in thickness between the spacer layers 4 is<br>
preferably, but not limited to, about 0 to λ/2 or more in<br>
terms of optical path length.<br>
FIG. 9 is a drawing illustrating the configuration<br>
of a seventh exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium according to a seventh embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The seventh embodiment of the present<br>
invention is described below with reference to FIG. 9. The<br>
seventh exemplary multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium has a structure similar to that of the first<br>
exemplary multilayer optical information recording medium<br>
shown in FIG. 1, except that middle layers 2-1, 2-2, and 2-<br><br>
3 have different thicknesses and/or recording layers 3-1,<br>
3-2, and 3-3 have different thicknesses. The optical path<br>
lengths of the middle layers 2 and/or the recording layers<br>
3 may be varied by changing their refractive indices<br>
instead of changing their thicknesses. Other configurations<br>
and characteristics of the seventh exemplary multilayer<br>
optical information recording medium are substantially the<br>
same as those of the first exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium. The difference in thickness<br>
between the middle layers 2 or between the recording layers<br>
3 is preferably, but not limited to, about 0 to λ/2 or more<br>
in terms of optical path length. Also, the difference in<br>
thickness is preferably varied irregularly.<br>
FIG. 10 is a drawing illustrating the<br>
configuration of an eighth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium according to an eighth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The eighth embodiment<br>
of the present invention is described below with reference<br>
to FIG. 10. The eighth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium has a structure similar to<br>
that of the second exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium shown in FIG. 4 except that the layers of<br>
the recording marks 3a in recording layers 3-1, 3-2, and 3-<br>
3 are arranged at different intervals 3b-l, 3b-2, and 3b-3<br>
(distances between the layers of the recording marks 3a are<br><br>
different among the recording layers 3) and, as a result,<br>
the recording layers 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 have different<br>
thicknesses. The optical path lengths of the recording<br>
layers 3 may be varied by changing their refractive indices<br>
instead of changing the intervals between the layers of the<br>
recording marks 3a. Other configurations and<br>
characteristics of the eighth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium are substantially the same as<br>
those of the second exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium. The difference in thickness<br>
between the recording layers 3 is preferably, but not<br>
limited to, about 0 to λ/2 in terms of optical path length.<br>
Also, the difference in thickness is preferably varied<br>
irregularly.<br>
FIG. 11 is a drawing illustrating the<br>
configuration of a ninth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium according to a ninth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The ninth embodiment<br>
of the present invention is described below with reference<br>
to FIG. 11. The ninth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium has a structure similar to<br>
that of the third exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium shown in FIG. 5, except that the first<br>
adhesive layer 6 and the control layer 5 are formed in the<br>
middle of each recording layer unit composed of the middle<br><br>
layers 2 and the recording layers 3 rather than between the<br>
substrate 1 and the middle layer 2. As shown in FIG. 11, in<br>
the ninth exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium, the second adhesive layer 6 shown in FIG.<br>
5 is omitted and the middle layer 2 is formed directly on<br>
the control layer 5. Other configurations and<br>
characteristics of the ninth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium are substantially the same as<br>
those of the second exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium.<br>
FIG. 12 is a drawing illustrating the<br>
configuration of a tenth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium according to a tenth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The tenth embodiment<br>
of the present invention is described below with reference<br>
to FIG. 12. As shown in FIG. 12, the tenth exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium has a<br>
structure similar to that of the fourth exemplary<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium shown in<br>
FIG. 6, except that the first adhesive layer 6 and the<br>
control layer 5 are formed between the recording layers 3<br>
rather than between the spacer layer 4 and the recording<br>
layer 3. In the tenth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium, the second adhesive layer 6<br>
is omitted and the recording layer 3 is formed directly on<br><br>
the control layer 5. Other configurations and<br>
characteristics of the tenth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium are substantially the same as<br>
those of the fourth exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium.<br>
FIG. 13 is a drawing illustrating the<br>
configuration of an exemplary signal recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus according to an eleventh embodiment of the<br>
present invention for recording and reproducing a signal on<br>
a multilayer optical information recording medium according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment, the third exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium shown in FIG. 5 is used as an<br>
exemplary optical recording medium to describe exemplary<br>
signal recording and reproduction processes by the<br>
exemplary signal recording/reproducing apparatus.<br>
The eleventh embodiment of the present invention<br>
is described below with reference to FIG. 13. In the<br>
exemplary signal recording/reproducing apparatus shown in<br>
FIG. 13, a light beam emitted from a light source 11 (first<br>
light source) passes through a lens 12, a polarization beam<br>
splitter 13, a dichroic prism 14, a 1/4 wavelength plate 15,<br>
and an objective lens 16; and is thereby focused on a track<br>
on the control layer 5 in the exemplary optical recording<br>
medium. The light beam reflected from the track on the<br><br>
control layer 5 passes through the objective lens 16, the<br>
1/4 wavelength plate 15, and the dichroic prism 14; is<br>
reflected by the polarization beam splitter 13; passes<br>
through a condenser lens 17, a pinhole 18 (first pinhole),<br>
condenser lenses 19 and 20, and a cylindrical lens 21; and<br>
is thereby focused on a quadrant detector 22.<br>
Focusing a light beam with the condenser lens 20<br>
and the cylindrical lens 21 causes astigmatism and thereby<br>
causes the focused light beam to have two focal points. The<br>
quadrant detector 22 is positioned between the two focal<br>
points. The diameter of the pinhole 18 placed between the<br>
condenser lenses 17 and 19 is, for example, slightly larger<br>
than that of the light spot formed by the condenser lens 17.<br>
This allows a light beam to pass through the pinhole 18<br>
even when the light beam is not accurately focused on the<br>
control layer 5.<br>
Another light beam emitted from another light<br>
source 23 (second light source) passes through a lens 24;<br>
is reflected by a polarization beam splitter 25; passes<br>
through condenser lenses 26 and 27; is reflected by the<br>
dichroic prism 14; passes through the 1/4 wavelength plate<br>
15 and the objective lens 16; and is thereby focused on the<br>
recording layer 3 in the exemplary optical recording medium.<br>
A positioning mechanism such as a coil is provided for the<br><br>
objective lens 16 to adjust the position of the objective<br>
lens 16.<br>
The light beam reflected from the recording layer<br>
3 passes through the objective lens 16 and the 1/4<br>
wavelength plate 15; is reflected by the dichroic prism 14;<br>
passes through the condenser lenses 27 and 26, the<br>
polarization beam splitter 25, a condenser lens 28, and a<br>
pinhole 29 (second pinhole); and is thereby focused on a<br>
photodetector 30.<br>
The light source 23 and the pinhole 29 are placed<br>
in confocal positions. The condenser lenses 26 and 27 form<br>
a beam expander and function as a positioning mechanism.<br>
The focal point of a light beam in the exemplary optical<br>
recording medium can be changed by changing the positions<br>
of the condenser lenses 26 and 27 along the optical axis.<br>
In other words, the focal point of a light beam from the<br>
light source 23 can be adjusted along the optical axis by<br>
changing the distance between the condenser lenses 26 and<br>
27. The diameter of the pinhole 29 is preferably equal to<br>
or around that of a light spot formed by the condenser lens<br>
28.<br>
In the exemplary signal recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus as described above, a light beam emitted from the<br>
light source 11 is focused on a track on the control layer<br>
5 and the distance between the condenser lenses 26 and 27<br><br>
is adjusted so that a light beam emitted from the light<br>
source 23 is focused on a point that is a specific distance<br>
away along the optical axis from the focal point of the<br>
light beam emitted from the light source 11. This mechanism<br>
makes it possible to focus the light beam emitted from the<br>
light source 23 on a specific recording layer 3. Also, as<br>
described above, the light beam emitted from the light<br>
source 11 is reflected by the track and enters the quadrant<br>
detector 22, and the quadrant detector 22 generates a<br>
signal. Based on the signal generated by the quadrant<br>
detector 22, a focus error signal is obtained by an<br>
astigmatism method and a track error signal is obtained by<br>
a push-pull method. The obtained signals are used to<br>
control the position of the objective lens 16.<br>
The exemplary signal recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus may also be configured to include multiple sets<br>
of the light source 23 and the photodetector 30 and thereby<br>
to record and reproduce information on multiple recording<br>
layers 3 using multiple light beams. Further, the exemplary<br>
signal recording/reproducing apparatus may be configured to<br>
include multiple sets of the light source 11 and the<br>
quadrant detector 22 and thereby to simultaneously perform<br>
focus servo control for plural recording layers 3. In this<br>
case, a dynamic focusing unit such as a liquid crystal<br><br>
focusing element is necessary in the exemplary signal<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus.<br>
A twelfth embodiment of the present invention is<br>
described below. According to the twelfth embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the control layer 5 in the third or<br>
ninth exemplary multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium is configured to store information on the<br>
arrangement of the recording layers 3 and the middle layers<br>
2 in a corresponding recording .layer unit and information<br>
on the locations of the recording layers 3 and the middle<br>
layers 2 in the medium. Also, the control layer 5 in the<br>
fourth or tenth exemplary multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium is configured to store information on the<br>
horizontal and vertical arrangements of the recording marks<br>
3a in a corresponding recording layer 3 and information on<br>
the locations of the recording marks 3a in the medium.<br>
The above information can be recorded by<br>
physically forming lands and pits on the control layer 5 at<br>
the same time when grooves used for tracking are formed on<br>
the control layer 5. Other configurations and<br>
characteristics of the exemplary multilayer optical<br>
information recording media according to the twelfth<br>
embodiment are substantially the same as those of the<br>
exemplary multilayer optical information recording media<br>
according to other embodiments.<br><br>
In a multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium according to an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the total number of the recording layers 3 is preferably<br>
from several tens to several hundreds, and the number of<br>
layers in a recording layer unit is preferably from several<br>
to 100. When materials and specifications of a product are<br>
taken into account, the thickness of the recording layer 3<br>
and the middle layer 2 is preferably from 0.1 µm to several<br>
tens of µm, and the thickness of the spacer layer 4 is<br>
preferably between 1 and about 100 µm. Also, the thickness<br>
of the middle layer 2 is preferably equal to or larger than<br>
that of the recording layer 3.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a<br>
multilayer optical information recording medium that makes<br>
it possible to reduce the fluctuation in the amount of<br>
reflected light in recording or reading a signal even when<br>
the wavelength or incidence angle of the light varies and<br>
thereby to prevent the S/N ratio from decreasing; and to<br>
accurately position a laser beam even when the number of<br>
recording layers is large. Such a multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium is suitable, for example, to<br>
be used with an optical disk filing system or an optical<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus for recording<br>
information such as video data.<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium includes multiple recording layer units in each of<br>
which one or more recording layers and one or more middle<br>
layers are stacked alternately; and one or more spacer<br>
layers; wherein the recording layer units and the spacer<br>
layers are stacked alternately in a depth direction of the<br>
optical recording medium. The spacer layers make it<br>
possible to control and optimize the optical phase change<br>
between the multiple recording layer units and thereby to<br>
reduce the fluctuation in reflectance or in the amount of<br>
reflected light even when the wavelength or incidence angle<br>
of the light varies.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium includes multiple recording layers treated as<br>
recording layer units in each of which recording marks each<br>
having a refractive index different from that of a<br>
surrounding area are arranged so as to form multiple layers<br>
of the recording marks, wherein the recording marks in each<br>
of the layers of the recording marks are horizontally<br>
arranged at intervals and the layers of the recording marks<br>
are vertically arranged at intervals; and one or more<br>
spacer layers; wherein the recording layers and the spacer<br>
layers are stacked alternately in a depth direction of the<br><br>
optical recording medium. In such a multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium, varying the thicknesses or<br>
refractive indices of the spacer layers or varying the<br>
vertical distances between the layers of the recording<br>
marks among the recording layers makes it possible to<br>
change relative phase of light when the light is<br>
transmitted through the layers. This, in turn, makes it<br>
possible to reduce the fluctuation in reflectance or in the<br>
amount of reflected light by mutual interference even when<br>
the wavelength or incidence angle of the light varies.<br>
A multilayer optical information recording medium<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention may also<br>
include a control layer used for tracking for each of the<br>
recording layer units and/or an adhesive or pressure-<br>
sensitive adhesive layer. Further, the control layer may be<br>
configure to store information on the arrangements of<br>
layers or recording marks in a corresponding one of the<br>
recording layer units and information on locations of the<br>
layers or the recording marks in the optical recording<br>
medium. Such configurations make it possible to perform<br>
tracking accurately for each of the recording layer units<br>
and to process the control layer with various methods.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is descried<br>
below with reference to FIGs. 15 through 24. FIG. 15 is a<br><br>
drawing illustrating an exemplary structure of an optical<br>
disk 100 that is a multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, the optical disk 100 includes<br>
a cover layer C and three multilayer units (U1, U2, and U3)<br>
stacked on the cover layer C. In FIG. 15, the Z direction<br>
indicates a direction along the thickness of the optical<br>
disk 100 (upward direction in FIG. 15). A laser beam LB is<br>
emitted from a light source positioned upstream of the<br>
optical disk 100 in the Z direction.<br>
The cover layer C is the lowest layer of the<br>
optical disk 100. Therefore, the laser beam LB is incident<br>
on the lower surface of the cover layer C (the lower<br>
surface of the cover layer C is the incidence plane). The<br>
multilayer unit Ul is stacked on the upper surface of the<br>
cover layer C, the multilayer unit U2 is stacked on the<br>
upper surface of the multilayer unit Ul, and the multilayer<br>
unit U3 is stacked on the upper surface of the multilayer<br>
unit U2.<br>
Each of the multilayer units Ul through U3<br>
includes a guide track layer S and an information layer M.<br>
The guide track layer S corresponds to light with<br>
a wavelength between 390 and 420 nm. Guide grooves (or<br>
tracks) are formed spirally or concentrically on the guide<br><br>
track layer S. Also, the guide tracks are formed so as to<br>
wobble at intervals.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, the information layer M is<br>
positioned downstream of the guide track layer S in the Z<br>
direction and is composed of five recording layers D and<br>
five resin layers G stacked alternately. In other words,<br>
one guide track layer S is provided for five recording<br>
layers D. Also, in each of the multilayer units, the guide<br>
track layer S is positioned closer to the incidence plane<br>
than the recording layers D.<br>
Each of the recording layers D is made of a two-<br>
photon absorption material that is suitable for light with<br>
a wavelength between 650 and 680 nm. Information is<br>
recorded on the recording layer D in a photon mode.<br>
Examples of two-photon absorption materials include<br>
photorefractive crystal, photopolymer, and photochromic<br>
materials.<br>
In a photon-mode recording, the refractive index<br>
of an area exposed to a light spot changes in proportion to<br>
the light intensity distribution of the light spot.<br>
Therefore, the diameter of a spot formed by photon-mode<br>
recording is about 0.71 (= 1/2) times as large as that of<br>
a spot formed by normal recording. For example, as shown in<br>
FIG. 17, a pit recorded by two-photon absorption (length:<br>
Dz2, width: Dr2) is smaller than a pit recorded by normal<br><br>
one-photon absorption (length: Dz1, width: Dr1). Therefore,<br>
two-photon absorption recording makes it possible to record<br>
information at a recording density higher than in one-<br>
photon absorption recording even when light with a same<br>
light source wavelength is used (see "Two-photon absorption<br>
recording on photochromic material using laser diode",<br>
Teruhiro Shiono, OPTRONICS, July 2005, No. 28, p 174,<br>
published by the Optronics Co., Ltd.). In other words, two-<br>
photon absorption recording makes it possible to increase<br>
the storage capacity of an optical disk. Each value on the<br>
horizontal scale of the graph in FIG. 17 indicates a<br>
distance from the center of a pit.<br>
As described above, one way to increase the<br>
storage capacity of an optical disk is to increase the<br>
number of recording layers in the optical disk. At the same<br>
time, it is important to increase the storage capacity of<br>
each recording layer. To increase the storage capacity of<br>
each recording layer, it is preferable to record<br>
information at a high density using light with a wavelength<br>
as short as possible. However, at the current state of<br>
technology, it is difficult to find a two-photon absorption<br>
material suitable for blue light. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable to use a two-photon absorption material suitable<br>
for green light or red light. Since green-light emitting<br>
laser diodes are not being mass-produced currently, in this<br><br>
embodiment, a two-photon absorption material suitable for<br>
red light is used for the recording layer D. Even with red<br>
light, a spot with a diameter about 0.71 (= 1/√2) times as<br>
large as that of a spot formed by one-photon absorption<br>
recording can be formed on the recording layer D and<br>
therefore information can be recorded at a density as high<br>
as that possible with blue light.<br>
The guide track layer S contains no two-photon<br>
absorption material. Since two-photon absorption materials<br>
degrade when they are exposed to light in the spectrum from<br>
blue to ultraviolet, it is preferable not to use two-photon<br>
absorption material for a layer that is, for example,<br>
irradiated with an ultraviolet ray in a production process<br>
(for example, 2P process) for curing an ultraviolet curing<br>
resin or an adhesive.<br>
As described above, the guide track layer S<br>
contains no two-photon absorption material. Therefore, if<br>
red light for the recording layer D is also used for the<br>
guide track layer S, the diameter of a spot cannot be<br>
reduced to a satisfactory level and it becomes difficult to<br>
increase the storage capacity per recording layer.<br>
Generally, the diameter of a spot is proportional to a<br>
value obtained by the following formula:<br>
wavelength/numerical aperture (NA) of lens. Therefore, even<br>
on a layer with no two-photon absorption material, the<br><br>
diameter of a spot can be reduced by using light with a<br>
short wavelength. In this embodiment, blue light, which has<br>
a wavelength shorter than that of light used to irradiate<br>
the recording layer D, is used to irradiate the guide track<br>
layer S. Using blue light makes it possible to narrow the<br>
pitch between tracks (track pitch) on the guide track layer<br>
S and thereby makes it possible to increase the storage<br>
capacity per recording layer. And the increased storage<br>
capacity per recording layer, in turn, makes it possible to<br>
increase the storage capacity of an optical disk. Also, a<br>
narrower track pitch makes it possible to accurately<br>
perform servo control on a high-density recording medium.<br>
Meanwhile, forming a guide track layer S and<br>
multiple recording layers D as a multilayer unit improves<br>
the tilt tolerance of an optical disk. Take, for example,<br>
an information layer M including five recording layers each<br>
having a thickness of 3 µm (the total thickness of the<br>
information layer M is 3 µm x 5 = 15 µm) . In this case,<br>
even when the optical disk 100 is tilted 1 degree in<br>
relation to the incidence angle of light, the focal point<br>
of the light is shifted only 0.26 µm. With an optical disk<br>
having the above structure, even when the track pitch is as<br>
narrow as 0.32 µm like a Blu-ray disk, the focal point of<br>
the light may not be shifted out of a target track and<br>
therefore information can be recorded/reproduced reliably<br><br>
by performing conventional tilt control. In other words,<br>
the optical disk 100 satisfies the condition expressed by-<br>
formula (1) shown below. In formula (1), n indicates the<br>
number of recording layers in each multilayer unit, d<br>
indicates the thickness of each recording layer, and p<br>
indicates a track pitch.<br><br>
In summary, an optical disk with a structure where<br>
the guide track layers S and the information layers M are<br>
stacked alternately provides, even when the optical disk<br>
includes a large number of recording layers, a tilt<br>
tolerance that is substantially equal to that of an optical<br>
disk having only a few recording layers and thereby makes<br>
it possible to stably and reliably record/reproduce<br>
information.<br>
An exemplary configuration of an optical pickup<br>
123 that is an optical head according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention is described below with reference to<br>
FIGs. 18 through 21.<br>
As shown in FIG. 18, the optical pickup 123<br>
includes a light source LD1, a polarization beam splitter<br>
151, a collimator lens 152, an aberration correction<br>
optical element 153, a dichroic prism 154, a 1/4 wavelength<br>
plate 155, an objective lens 160, a light source LD2, a<br>
detection lens 156, a photodetector PD1, a half mirror 159,<br><br>
a diffractive-optical element 158, a collimator lens 157,<br>
photodetector PD2, and a driving mechanism (not shown) for<br>
driving the objective lens 160.<br>
The light source LD1 includes a laser diode that<br>
emits light with a wavelength of about 405 nm. The light<br>
source LD1 emits light at its maximum intensity in the Z<br>
direction. The light emitted from the light source LD1 is,<br>
for example, p-polarized. Hereafter, the light emitted from<br>
the light source LD1 is also called a "servo beam".<br>
The polarization beam splitter 151 is positioned<br>
downstream of the light source LD1 in the Z direction. The<br>
reflectance of the polarization beam splitter 151 differs<br>
depending on the polarization state of an incoming light.<br>
In this embodiment, for example, the reflectance of the<br>
polarization beam splitter 151 is low for a p-polarized<br>
light and high for an s-polarized light. Therefore, most of<br>
the servo beam emitted from the light source LD1 can pass<br>
through the polarization beam splitter 151.<br>
The collimator lens 152 is positioned downstream<br>
of the polarization beam splitter 151 in the Z direction<br>
and substantially collimates the servo beam from the<br>
polarization beam splitter 151.<br>
The aberration correction optical element 153 is<br>
positioned downstream of the collimator lens 152 in the Z<br><br>
direction and corrects the aberration of an incoming light<br>
beam.<br>
The light source LD2 includes a laser diode array<br>
having at least five light-emitting parts each of which<br>
emits light with a wavelength of about 660 nm. The light<br>
source LD2 emits five light beams in the -Y direction. The<br>
five light beams emitted from the light source LD2 are, for<br>
example, p-polarized. Hereafter, the light beams emitted<br>
from the light source LD2 are also called<br>
"recording/reproducing beams".<br>
The half mirror 159 is positioned downstream of<br>
the light source LD2 in the -Y direction and bends the<br>
light path of a part of an incoming light beam at right<br>
angles.<br>
The diffractive-optical element 158 is positioned<br>
downstream of the half mirror 159 in the -Y direction and<br>
diffracts an incoming light. The light paths of the five<br>
recording/reproducing beams from the half mirror 159 are<br>
changed by the diffractive-optical element 158 so that<br>
their light axes join and their divergence angles differ<br>
from each other.<br>
The collimator lens 157 is positioned downstream<br>
of the diffractive-optical element 158 in the -Y direction<br>
and substantially collimates the five recording/reproducing<br>
beams from the diffractive-optical element 158. However,<br><br>
since the five recording/reproducing beams from the<br>
diffractive-optical element 158 have different divergence<br>
angles, each of the beams from the collimator lens 157<br>
becomes parallel, slightly divergent, or slightly<br>
convergent.<br>
The dichroic prism 154 is positioned downstream of<br>
the aberration correction optical element 153 in the Z<br>
direction and downstream of the collimator lens 157 in the<br>
-Y direction. The dichroic prism 154 bends the light path<br>
of light with a wavelength of about 660 nm (a<br>
recording/reproducing beam) at right angles.<br>
The 1/4 wavelength plate 155 is positioned<br>
downstream of the dichroic prism 154 in the Z direction and<br>
gives an optical phase difference of a 1/4 wavelength to an<br>
incoming light.<br>
The objective lens 160 is positioned downstream of<br>
the 1/4 wavelength plate 155 in the Z direction and focuses<br>
light from the 1/4 wavelength plate 155. As shown in FIGs.<br>
19 through 21, each of the five recording/reproducing beams<br>
LB2 is focused on a different one of the recording layers D<br>
in a multilayer unit, and the servo beam LB1 is focused on<br>
the guide track layer S in the multilayer unit.<br>
The detection lens 156 is positioned downstream of<br>
the polarization beam splitter 151 in the Y direction and<br>
gives astigmatism to light that is returned from the guide<br><br>
track layer S and reflected by the polarization beam<br>
splitter 151 in the Y direction.<br>
The photodetector PD1 is positioned downstream of<br>
the detection lens 156 in the Y direction and receives<br>
light from the detection lens 156.<br>
The photodetector PD2 is positioned downstream of<br>
the half mirror 159 in the -Z direction and receives light<br>
returned from the information layer M and reflected by the<br>
half mirror 159 in the -Z direction.<br>
The driving mechanism includes a focusing actuator<br>
for finely adjusting the position of the objective lens 160<br>
in the focus direction that is along the light axis of the<br>
objective lens 160; and a tracking actuator for finely<br>
adjusting the position of the objective lens 160 in the<br>
tracking direction that is orthogonal to a tangent to a<br>
track.<br>
The working of the optical pickup 123 configured<br>
as mentioned above is described below. In the descriptions<br>
below, it is assumed that the five recording layers D in<br>
the multilayer unit U2 of the optical disk 100 are target<br>
recording layers.<br>
The linearly polarized (p-polarized) servo beam<br>
LB1 emitted from the light source LD1 enters the<br>
polarization beam splitter 151. Most of the servo beam LB1<br>
passes through the polarization beam splitter 151; is<br><br>
substantially collimated by the collimator lens 152; is<br>
aberration-corrected by the aberration correction optical<br>
element 153; and enters the dichroic prism 154. The servo<br>
beam LB1 passes through the dichroic prism 154; is<br>
circularly-polarized by the 1/4 wavelength plate 155; and<br>
is focused on the guide track layer S in the multilayer<br>
unit U2 by the objective lens 160.<br>
The light beam reflected from the guide track<br>
layer S in the multilayer unit U2 (returned light beam) is<br>
circularly-polarized in a direction opposite to that of the<br>
circular polarization of the incoming servo beam LB1. The<br>
returned light beam enters the 1/4 wavelength plate 155 via<br>
the objective lens 160 and is linear-polarized (s-<br>
polarized) in a direction that is orthogonal to that of the<br>
linear polarization of the incoming servo beam LB1. Then,<br>
the returned light beam passes through the dichroic prism<br>
154, the aberration correction optical element 153, and the<br>
collimator lens 152, and enters the polarization beam<br>
splitter 151.<br>
The returned light beam is reflected by the<br>
polarization beam splitter 151 in the Y direction and, via<br>
the detection lens 156, received by the photodetector PD1.<br>
As in a conventional optical disk apparatus, the<br>
photodetector PD1 includes multiple light-receiving<br>
elements (or multiple light-receiving areas) each outputs a<br><br>
signal (control signal) containing information such as<br>
wobble signal information and servo information (focus<br>
error information, tracking error information, and so on).<br>
Each of the light-receiving elements (or light-receiving<br>
areas) generates a signal in proportion to the amount of<br>
received light by photoelectric conversion.<br>
On the other hand, the linearly polarized (p-<br>
polarized) five recording/reproducing beams LB2 emitted<br>
from the light source LD2 enter the half mirror 159. The<br>
five recording/reproducing beams LB2 from the half mirror<br>
159 pass through the diffractive-optical element 158 and<br>
the collimator lens 157; and enter the dichroic prism 154.<br>
The light paths of the five recording/reproducing beams LB2<br>
are bended by the dichroic prism 154 in the Z direction.<br>
Then, the five recording/reproducing beams LB2 are<br>
circularly polarized by the 1/4 wavelength plate 155; and<br>
focused on the five recording layers D in the multilayer<br>
unit U2 by the objective lens 160.<br>
The five light beams reflected from the five<br>
recording layers D in the multilayer unit U2 (returned<br>
light beams) are circularly-polarized in a direction<br>
opposite to that of the circular polarization of the<br>
incoming recording/reproducing beams LB2. The returned<br>
light beams enter the 1/4 wavelength plate 155 via the<br>
objective lens 160 and are linear-polarized (s-polarized)<br><br>
in a direction that is orthogonal to that of the linear<br>
polarization of the incoming recording/reproducing beams<br>
LB2. Then, the returned light beams are reflected by the<br>
dichroic prism 154 in the Y direction; pass through the<br>
collimator lens 157 and the diffractive-optical element<br>
158; and enter the half mirror 159. The returned light<br>
beams are reflected by the half mirror 159 and received by<br>
the photodetector PD2. The photodetector PD2 includes five<br>
light-receiving elements (or five light-receiving areas)<br>
where each element (or area) receives a different one of<br>
the five returned light beams and outputs a signal<br>
containing information such as reproduction information.<br>
Each of the light-receiving elements (or light-receiving<br>
areas) generates a signal in proportion to the amount of<br>
received light by photoelectric conversion. In other words,<br>
the photodetector PD2 can read signals from the five<br>
recording layers D at the same time.<br>
As described above, since the photodetector PD1<br>
for receiving a light beam representing servo information<br>
and the photodetector PD2 for receiving light beams<br>
representing reproduction information are provided<br>
separately, each of the photodetectors can be configured to<br>
best suit its purpose. For example, a low-speed<br>
photodetector may be used as the photodetector PD1 and a<br>
high-speed photodetector may be used as the photodetector<br><br>
PD2. Especially, it is preferable to design an optical<br>
drive using a low-speed photodetector as the photodetector<br>
PD1 for receiving a short-wavelength light that is<br>
comparatively difficult to detect. Also, since a servo beam<br>
with a fixed intensity can be used for both recording and<br>
reproduction, no gain switch is necessary for the<br>
photodetector PDl. This makes it possible to simplify the<br>
circuit configuration of the photodetector PDl.<br>
Further, a Si-PIN photodiode with a wide dynamic<br>
range may be used for the photodetector PDl and an<br>
avalanche photodiode (APD) with a high multiplication<br>
factor may be used for the photodetector PD2. A Si-PIN<br>
photodiode is suitable for accurate detection of a light<br>
beam representing servo information which detection<br>
requires a wide dynamic range and linearity to the amount<br>
of light. On the other hand, an avalanche photodiode can<br>
amplify a weak light beam representing reproduction<br>
information which light beam is reflected from the<br>
recording layer D having a low reflectance.<br>
An exemplary configuration of an optical disk<br>
apparatus 120 that is an optical drive according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described below with<br>
reference to FIG. 22.<br>
As shown in FIG. 22, the optical disk apparatus<br>
120 includes a spindle motor 122 for rotating an optical<br><br>
disk, the optical pickup 123, a seek motor 121 for driving<br>
the optical pickup 123, a laser control circuit 124, an<br>
encoder 125, a drive control circuit 126, a reproduction<br>
signal processing circuit 128, a buffer RAM 134, a buffer<br>
manager 137, an interface 138, a flash memory 139, a CPU<br>
140, and a RAM 141. Arrows in FIG. 22 indicate flow of<br>
signals and information and do not represent all<br>
connections between the blocks. The optical disk apparatus<br>
120 is usable for recording/reproducing information on the<br>
optical disk 100.<br>
The reproduction signal processing circuit 128<br>
obtains, for example, address information, a<br>
synchronization signal, and servo signals such as a focus<br>
error signal and a tracking error signal based on the<br>
output signals (photoelectric conversion signals) from the<br>
photodetector PD1. Also, the reproduction signal processing<br>
circuit 128 obtains RF signals from the recording layers D<br>
based on the output signals (five photoelectric conversion<br>
signals) from the photodetector PD2.<br>
The servo signals are output to the drive control<br>
circuit 126, the address information is output to the CPU<br>
140, and the synchronization signal is output to the<br>
encoder 125 and the drive control circuit 126. Further, the<br>
reproduction signal processing circuit 128 performs<br>
decoding and error detection on each of the RF signals and<br><br>
then stores the RF signal as reproduced data via the buffer<br>
manager 137 in the buffer RAM 134. When an error is<br>
detected in an RF signal, the reproduction signal<br>
processing circuit 128 performs error correction before<br>
storing the RF signal in the buffer RAM 134. The address<br>
information contained in the reproduced data is output to<br>
the CPU 140.<br>
The drive control circuit 126 generates driving<br>
signals for the driving mechanism of the optical pickup 123<br>
based on servo signals from the reproduction signal<br>
processing circuit 128 and outputs the driving signals to<br>
the optical pickup 123. The optical pickup 123 performs<br>
tracking control and focus control according to the driving<br>
signals. The drive control circuit 126 generate a driving<br>
signal for driving the seek motor 121 and a driving signal<br>
for driving the spindle motor 122 according to an<br>
instruction from the CPU 140. The driving signals are<br>
output to the seek motor 121 and the spindle motor 122.<br>
The buffer RAM 134 temporarily stores, for example,<br>
data to be recorded on the optical disk 100 (recording<br>
data) and data reproduced from the optical disk 100<br>
(reproduced data). Data input/output to or from the buffer<br>
RAM 134 is controlled by the buffer manager 137.<br>
The encoder 125, according to an instruction from<br>
the CPU 140, retrieves recording data in the buffer RAM 134<br><br>
via the buffer manager 137; modulates the recording data;<br>
attaches an error correcting code to the recording data;<br>
and generates recording signals to be written on the<br>
information layer M of the optical disk 100. For example,<br>
to record information on the five recording layers D, five<br>
recording signals are generated. The generated recording<br>
signals are output to the laser control circuit 124.<br>
The laser control circuit 124 controls the light<br>
emission power of each of the light sources of the optical<br>
pickup 123.<br>
When recording information, a driving signal for<br>
the light source LD2 is generated based on the recording<br>
signal, recording conditions, light emission<br>
characteristics of the laser diode array of the light<br>
source LD2, and so on. For example, to simultaneously<br>
record information on the five recording layers D, five<br>
driving signals are generated for the five light-emitting<br>
parts of the laser diode array.<br>
The interface 138 enables two-way communication<br>
between the optical disk apparatus 120 and an upstream<br>
apparatus 190 (for example, a personal computer). The<br>
interface 138 is a standard interface such as an AT<br>
attachment packet interface (ATAPI), a small computer<br>
system interface (SCSI), or a universal serial bus (USB).<br><br>
The flash memory 139 stores, for example, programs<br>
written in code that the CPU 140 can understand, light<br>
emission characteristics of the laser diode of the light<br>
source LD1, light emission characteristics of the laser<br>
diode array of the light source LD2, and recording<br>
conditions including recording power and recording strategy<br>
information.<br>
The CPU 140 controls the operations of other units<br>
in the optical disk apparatus 120 according to the programs<br>
stored in the flash memory 139 and stores, for example,<br>
control data in the RAM 141 and the buffer RAM 134.<br><recording process><br>
An exemplary recording process in the optical disk<br>
apparatus 120, which recording process is performed when<br>
recording of user data is requested from the upstream<br>
apparatus 190, is described below with reference to FIG. 23.<br>
The flowchart shown in FIG. 23 corresponds to a set of<br>
processing algorithms executed by the CPU 140. In the<br>
exemplary recording process, it is assumed that user data<br>
are recorded on multiple recording layers.<br>
When a recording command is received from the<br>
upstream apparatus 190, the initial address of a program<br>
corresponding to the flowchart shown in FIG. 23 is set in<br>
the program counter of the CPU 140 and a recording process<br>
is started.<br><br>
In step 401, the CPU 140 instructs the drive<br>
control circuit 126 to cause the spindle motor 122 to<br>
rotate the optical disk 100 at a specified linear velocity<br>
(or angular velocity) and reports the reception of the<br>
recording command from the upstream apparatus 190 to the<br>
reproduction signal processing circuit 128.<br>
In step 403, the CPU 140 analyzes the recording<br>
command and determines target recording layers and a target<br>
multilayer unit based on the addresses specified in the<br>
recording command. Then, the CPU 140 reports the determined<br>
information to the reproduction signal processing circuit<br>
128, the drive control circuit 126, the encoder 125, and<br>
the laser control circuit 124. Based on the determined<br>
information, the drive control circuit 126 controls the<br>
objective lens 160 so that the servo beam LB1 is focused on<br>
the guide track layer S in the target multilayer unit. Also,<br>
the CPU 140 determines light-emitting parts of the light<br>
source LD2 that are to be driven and light-receiving<br>
elements (or light-receiving areas) of the photodetector<br>
PD2 that are to generate signals.<br>
In step 405, the CPU 140 refers to address<br>
information obtained based on an output signal from the<br>
photodetector PD1 and instructs the drive control circuit<br>
126 to cause the seek motor 121 to seek the optical pickup<br>
123 so that a light spot is formed around a target position<br><br>
corresponding to the specified address. If seek operation<br>
is not necessary, this step is skipped.<br>
In step 407, the CPU 140 permits recording of data.<br>
With the permission, the encoder 125 and the laser control<br>
circuit 124 causes the optical pickup 123 to record data on<br>
the target recording layers substantially at the same time.<br>
During the recording, tracking control and focus control<br>
described above are performed at specified timings.<br>
In step 409, the CPU 140 determines whether the<br>
recording of data is completed. If the recording of data is<br>
not completed, the recording is continued and the CPU 140<br>
performs this step again after a specified period of time.<br>
If the recording of data is completed, the recording<br>
process is terminated. In the exemplary recording process,<br>
data are recorded on multiple recording layers<br>
substantially at the same time. Therefore, the exemplary<br>
recording process makes it possible to reduce the time for<br>
recording.<br><reproduction process><br>
An exemplary reproduction process in the optical<br>
disk apparatus 120, which reproduction process is performed<br>
when reproduction of data is requested from the upstream<br>
apparatus 190, is described below with reference to FIG. 24.<br>
The flowchart shown in FIG. 24 corresponds to a set of<br>
processing algorithms executed by the CPU 140. In the<br><br>
exemplary reproduction process, it is assumed that data on<br>
multiple recording layers are reproduced.<br>
When a reproduction command is received from the<br>
upstream apparatus 190, the initial address of a program<br>
corresponding to the flowchart shown in FIG. 24 is set in<br>
the program counter of the CPU 140 and a reproduction<br>
process is started.<br>
In step 501, the CPU 140 instructs the drive<br>
control circuit 126 to cause the spindle motor 122 to<br>
rotate the optical disk 100 at a specified linear velocity<br>
(or angular velocity) and reports the reception of the<br>
reproduction command from the upstream apparatus 190 to the<br>
reproduction signal processing circuit 128.<br>
In step 503, the CPU 140 analyses the reproduction<br>
command and determines target recording layers and a target<br>
multilayer unit based on the addresses specified in the<br>
reproduction command. Then, the CPU 140 reports the<br>
determined information to the reproduction signal<br>
processing circuit 128, the drive control circuit 126, and<br>
the laser control circuit 124. Based on the determined<br>
information, the drive control circuit 126 controls the<br>
objective lens 160 so that the servo beam LB1 is focused on<br>
the guide track layer S in the target multilayer unit. Also,<br>
the CPU 140 determines light-emitting parts of the light<br>
source LD2 that are to be driven and light-receiving<br><br>
elements (or light-receiving areas) of the photodetector<br>
PD2 that are to generate signals.<br>
In step 505, the CPU 140 instructs the drive<br>
control circuit 126 to cause the seek motor 121 to drive<br>
the optical pickup 123 so that a light spot is formed<br>
around a target position corresponding to the specified<br>
address. If seek operation is not necessary, this step is<br>
skipped.<br>
In step 507, the CPU 140 permits reproduction of<br>
data. With the permission, the optical pickup 123 and the<br>
reproduction signal processing circuit 128 reproduce data<br>
on the target recording layers substantially at the same<br>
time. The reproduced data are stored in the buffer RAM 134.<br>
When the reproduced data reach a specified amount, the<br>
reproduced data are transferred to the upstream apparatus<br>
190.<br>
In step 509, the CPU 140 determines whether the<br>
reproduction of data is completed. If the reproduction of<br>
data is not completed, the reproduction is continued and<br>
the CPU 140 performs this step again after a specified<br>
period of time. If the reproduction of data is completed,<br>
the reproduction process is terminated. In the exemplary<br>
reproduction process, data on multiple recording layers are<br>
reproduced substantially at the same time. Therefore, the<br><br>
exemplary reproduction process makes it possible to reduce<br>
the time for reproduction.<br>
As described above, in the optical disk 100<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
guide track layer S functions as a guide layer.<br>
In the optical pickup 123 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the light source D1<br>
emits a light beam with a first wavelength, the light<br>
source LD2 emits light beams with a second wavelength, the<br>
photodetector PD1 receives a light beam reflected from a<br>
guide layer, and the photodetector PD2 separately receives<br>
multiple light beams reflected from multiple recording<br>
layers.<br>
In the optical disk apparatus 120 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the reproduction<br>
signal processing circuit 128, the CPU 140, and programs<br>
executed by the CPU 140 constitute a processing unit. A<br>
part or the whole of the processing implemented by the<br>
programs executed by the CPU 14 0 may be implemented by<br>
hardware.<br>
As described above, the optical disk 100 according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention includes multiple<br>
multilayer units each including the guide track layer S<br>
(guide layer) corresponding to light with a wavelength<br>
between 390 and 420 nm (a first wavelength) and multiple<br><br>
recording layers D made of a two-photon absorption material<br>
and corresponding to light with a wavelength between 650<br>
and 680 nm (a second wavelength). This structure provides a<br>
high capacity multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium with a tilt tolerance that is substantially equal to<br>
that of a recording medium having only a few recording<br>
layers.<br>
With the optical disk 100 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a laser beam with a<br>
wavelength of 660 nm may be used as a recording/reproducing<br>
beam; and a laser beam with a wavelength of 405 nm may be<br>
used as a servo beam. This eliminates the need to use an<br>
expensive laser such as a femtosecond laser and thereby<br>
makes it possible to produce an optical pickup and an<br>
optical disk apparatus for recording/reproducing<br>
information on the optical disk 100 at low costs.<br>
In the optical disk 100 according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention, one guide track layer S is<br>
provided for multiple recording layers D. This structure<br>
eliminates the need to form guide grooves on each recording<br>
layer and thereby makes it possible to simplify a part of<br>
the production process.<br>
In the optical disk 100 according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the guide track layer S and the<br>
recording layers D are provided separately. With this<br><br>
structure, a servo beam does not form a small light spot<br>
near recording layers and, therefore, even when blue light<br>
is used for the servo beam, degradation of recording layers<br>
made of a two-photon absorption material, which is<br>
sensitive to blue through ultraviolet light, can be<br>
prevented.<br>
In the optical disk 100 according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the guide track layer S is<br>
positioned closer to the incidence plane than the<br>
information layer M. With this structure, the substrate<br>
thickness that a servo beam passes through becomes small.<br>
Therefore, even when blue light is used for the servo beam<br>
and even when the optical disk 100 is tilted 1 degree in<br>
relation to the objective lens 160, highly accurate servo<br>
information can be obtained. In other words, the optical<br>
disk 100 has a high tilt tolerance.<br>
The optical pickup 123 according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention uses a blue-light emitting laser<br>
diode as the light source of a servo beam and therefore is<br>
able to accurately obtain signals for servo control from<br>
the optical disk 100.<br>
The optical pickup 123 according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention uses a blue-light emitting laser<br>
diode as the light source of a servo beam and red-light<br>
emitting laser diodes for the light source of<br><br>
recording/reproducing beams. This configuration makes it<br>
possible to reduce the size and costs of an optical pickup.<br>
In the optical pickup 123 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the focal point of<br>
light with a wavelength of about 405 nm is closer to the<br>
objective lens 160 than that of light with a wavelength of<br>
about 660 nm. This configuration prevents degradation of<br>
the recording layers D in the optical disk 100. Also, since<br>
the refractive index of glass generally becomes higher as<br>
the wavelength of light becomes shorter, it is rather easy<br>
to design an objective lens with a short focal length for<br>
short wavelength light. More specifically, an inexpensive<br>
lens designed to handle both short wavelength light and<br>
long wavelength light implemented by using chromatic<br>
aberration of a lens material may be used as an objective<br>
lens.<br>
In the optical pickup 123 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a photodetector for<br>
receiving a reflected servo beam and a photodetector for<br>
receiving reflected recording/reproducing light beams are<br>
provided separately. This configuration makes it possible<br>
to optimize the response speed, gain, sensitivity,<br>
modulation characteristic, and so on of each photodetector<br>
so that each photodetector can generate an appropriate<br>
signal.<br><br>
The optical disk apparatus 120 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention includes the optical<br>
pickup 123 described above and is therefore able to<br>
accurately record, reproduce, and/or delete information on<br>
the optical disk 100.<br>
In the embodiments described above, the optical<br>
disk 100 includes three multilayer units. However, the<br>
number of multilayer units in the optical disk 100 is not<br>
limited to three.<br>
In the embodiments described above, each<br>
multilayer unit includes five recording layers. However,<br>
the number of recording layers in a multilayer unit is not<br>
limited to five. When the number of recording layers in<br>
each multilayer unit is less/more than five, the number of<br>
light-emitting parts of the light source LD2 may be changed<br>
according to the number of recording layers.<br>
Also, a multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
may have a structure like that of an optical disk 100a<br>
shown in FIG. 25. In the optical disk 100a, multiple guide<br>
track layers (S1, S2, and S3) are stacked on the upper<br>
surface of the cover layer C; and multiple information<br>
layers (Ml, M2, and M3) are stacked on top of the guide<br>
track layers (S1, S2, and S3). In the optical disk 100a,<br>
the distance between the guide track layer S1 and the<br><br>
information layer M1, the distance between the guide track<br>
layer S2 and the information layer M2, and the distance<br>
between the guide track layer S3 and the information layer<br>
M3 are the same distance t.<br>
In the optical disk 100a, as shown FIGs. 26<br>
through 28, the guide track layer S1 is used for servo<br>
control when recording/reproducing information on the<br>
information layer Ml, the guide track layer S2 is used for<br>
servo control when recording/reproducing information on the<br>
information layer M2, and the guide track layer S3 is used<br>
for servo control when recording/reproducing information on<br>
the information layer M3. Therefore, in this case, the<br>
objective lens 160 is configured so that the distance<br>
between the focal point of the servo beam LB1 and the focal<br>
point of the closest one of the recording/reproducing beams<br>
LB2 equals the distance t.<br>
Also, in the optical disk 100a, the guide track<br>
layers S1 through S3 are positioned closer to the incidence<br>
plane than the information layers M1 through M3. Therefore,<br>
even when a servo beam moves from one guide track layer to<br>
another, the servo beam does not pass through a recording<br>
layer. This prevents reflection (flare) of the servo beam<br>
from layers other than the target layer and thereby makes<br>
it possible to obtain a stable servo signal and to perform<br>
servo control at high speed without interruption.<br><br>
Further, in the optical disk 100a, recording<br>
layers and guide track layers are separated. This structure<br>
makes it possible to simplify the production process.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a multilayer optical information recording<br>
medium may have a structure like that of an optical disk<br>
100b shown in FIG. 29. In the optical disk 100b, a filter<br>
layer F is provided between a set of guide track layers and<br>
a set of information layers. The filter layer F reflects<br>
light with a wavelength between 390 and 420 nm and<br>
transmits light with a wavelength between 650 and 680 nm.<br>
In other words, the filter layer F reflects the servo beam<br>
LB1 and thereby prevents the servo beam LB1 from reaching<br>
the recording layers D made of a two-photon absorption<br>
material. This, in turn, eliminates one of the causes that<br>
degrade the recording layers D and makes it possible to<br>
reliably record/reproduce information.<br>
According to still another embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a multilayer optical information<br>
recording medium may have a structure like that of an<br>
optical disk 100c shown in FIG. 30. The optical disk 100c<br>
includes multiple multilayer units (UN1, UN2, ...) each<br>
including multiple guide track layers and multiple<br>
information layers.<br><br>
The optical pickup 123 may be easily adapted for<br>
the optical disk 100a by changing the effective diameters<br>
of the servo beam LB1 and the recording/reproducing beams<br>
LB2 according to the distance t in the optical disk 100a<br>
and by changing the numerical aperture of the objective<br>
lens 160.<br>
According to embodiments of the present invention,<br>
the wavelength of light emitted from the light source LD1<br>
is preferably between 390 and 420 nm and the wavelength of<br>
light emitted from the light source LD2 is preferably<br>
between 650 and 680 nm.<br>
In the above embodiments, the guide track layer S<br>
corresponds to light with a wavelength between 390 and 420<br>
nm and the recording layer D corresponds to light with a<br>
wavelength between 650 and 680 nm. However, the wavelength<br>
range of the light for the guide track layer S and the<br>
wavelength range of the light for the recording layer D are<br>
not limited to the above ranges as long as the wavelength<br>
ranges do not overlap. Even when the wavelength ranges are<br>
different from those described above, the light source LD1<br>
emits light for the guide track layer S and the light<br>
source LD2 emits light for the recording layer D.<br>
The optical disk apparatus 120 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is configured to record<br>
and reproduce information on an optical disk. However, the<br><br>
optical disk apparatus 120 may be configured to only<br>
reproduce information on an optical disk.<br>
The optical disk apparatus 120 and the optical<br>
pickup 123 according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention are configured to record/reproduce information on<br>
multiple recording layers at substantially the same time.<br>
However, the optical disk apparatus 120 and the optical<br>
pickup 123 may be configured to record/reproduce<br>
information on one recording layer at a time. In this case,<br>
the light source LD2 may be configured to include only one<br>
light-emitting part. Also, the photodetector PD2 may be<br>
configured to include only one light-receiving element (or<br>
light-receiving area).<br>
In the above embodiments, guide grooves are formed<br>
on the guide track layer S. However, guide pits (prepits)<br>
may be formed on the guide track layer S instead of the<br>
guide grooves. Also, both grooves and prepits may be formed<br>
on the guide track layer S.<br>
The guide track layer S may be designed to be<br>
recordable. A recordable guide track layer S makes it<br>
possible to further increase the storage capacity of an<br>
optical disk. In this case, like a hybrid disk, the guide<br>
track layer S may be used, for example, to store read-only<br>
programs or security data. Also, recording such data<br>
according to the Blu-ray standard makes it possible to use<br><br>
a signal processing system of an optical disk apparatus<br>
conforming to the Blu-ray standard and thereby makes it<br>
possible to reduce the production costs of an optical disk<br>
apparatus.<br>
Further, the guide track layer S may contain pre-<br>
recorded information such as a unit number to identify its<br>
location in an optical disk. Such identification<br>
information helps reduce the time to access the guide track<br>
layer S or to jump between multiple guide track layers S.<br>
As described above, an embodiment of the present<br>
invention provides a high capacity multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium with a tilt tolerance that is<br>
substantially equal to that of a recording medium having<br>
only a few recording layers. Another embodiment of the<br>
present invention provides an optical head that can<br>
accurately receive a signal from a multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Still another embodiment of the<br>
present invention provides an optical drive that can<br>
accurately record, reproduce, and/or delete information on<br>
a multilayer optical information recording medium according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the<br>
specifically disclosed embodiments, and variations and<br>
modifications may be made without departing from the scope<br><br>
of the present invention.<br>
The present application is based on Japanese<br>
