				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a composition especially useful as a pharmaceutical<br>
solutibility excipient, the method of producing same, and the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions obtained thereby. In particular, the invention has applicability to increasing<br>
the solubility of poorly soluble therapeutically active compounds.<br>
The invention provides a pharmaceutical solubility enhancing excipient for a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a poorly water soluble therapeutically active<br>
compound, said excipient comprising a mixture of:<br>
(a) saturated or unsaturated polyglycolyzed glycerides, and<br>
(b) polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block copolymers,<br>
The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a solid<br>
state solution or solid state dispersion of a poorly water soluble therapeutically active<br>
compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, said excipient comprising a<br>
mixture of:<br>
(a) saturated or unsaturated polyglycolyzed glycerides, and<br>
(b) polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block copolymers,<br>
whereby the solubility of the poorly soluble therapeutically active compound in the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is enhanced.<br>
The invention further provides methods for making the above compositions. In<br>
the first instance (a) and (b) are mixed to form an excipient mixture. In the second<br>
instance, to form a pharmaceutical composition, heating said polyglycolyzed glycerides<br>
and polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block co-polymer sufficiently to melt the<br>
ingredients.<br>
adding the therapeutic agent to the molten mixture of polyglycolyzed glycerides<br>
and polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block co-polymer<br>
maintaining the mixture at a sufficient temperature for a sufficient time to dissolve<br>
or disperse the pharmaceutical agent.<br>
The method aspect of the invention further comprises adding one or more optional<br>
eecipients, whereby:<br>
(A) the solubility of the therapeutically-active compound in the polyglycolyzed<br>
glyceride:polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block co-polymer mixture is<br>
increased, or<br>
(B) the melting point of the non-drug components is set, whereby at least one<br>
melting point peak belonging to the non-drug components is present<br>
between 30-80°C in the final composition, when analyzed by thermal<br>
analytical techniques.<br>
The method aspect of the invention further comprises.<br>
maintaining the resulting mixture in the molten form, with constant stirring to<br>
ensure homogenous distribution of the drug in the system, and then<br>
subjecting the molten mixture to one or more of the following operations:<br>
I) allowing the mixture to congeal to a solid mass, and then<br>
extruding the mixture through a hot melt extruder into a powder;<br>
II) milling the mixture using equipment that would maintain the<br>
milling conditions at room temperature or below the melting point<br>
of the non-drug components of the system to enable milling the<br>
composition into a powder;<br>
III) spray-congealing the mixture in a spray drier or fluidized bed drier<br>
to a powder;<br>
IV) congealing the mixture onto one or more optional exctpients in a<br>
spray drier, fluidized bed drier, rotor, high shear granulator,<br>
planetary mixer, blender, or any conventional food and<br>
pharmaceutical processing equipment;<br>
V) formulating the above-mentioned powders in pharmaceutical<br>
tablets, capsules, powders for inhalation, suppositories,<br>
suspensions, and emulsions; or<br>
VI) congealing said mixture onto a solid pharmaceutical tablet capsule<br>
or granule.<br>
It has been discovered that by utilizing a mixture of: (a) saturated or unsaturated<br>
polyglycolyzed glycerides, as exemplified by the commercial Gelucire compositions and<br>
(b) polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block copolymers, as exemplified by the<br>
commercial Pluronic surfactants, it is possible to prepare solid state solutions or solid state<br>
dispersions containing poorly soluble therapeutically active compounds, which<br>
compositions, in turn, provide a high degree of solubility to the therapeutic agent.<br>
Gelucires are polyglycolyzed glycerides prepared by the alcoholysis reaction of<br>
natural oils with polyoxyethylene glycols. They are mixtures of monoesters, diesters<br>
and/or triesters of glycerides of long chain C5 to C12 fatty acids, and in polyethylene<br>
glycol mono-and/or diesters of long chain fatty acids. These preparations have a wide<br>
range of melting points of from about 33°C to 64°C, as well as a wide range of<br>
hydrophilic/lipophilic balance values (HLB) from about 1 to about 14. The Gelucires of<br>
particular interest in the present invention have an HLB of above 10.<br>
The first number in the nomenclature of a Gelucire denotes its melting point,<br>
whereas the second number provide the HLB value. The preferred Gelucires of the<br>
present invention are grades 44/13 and 50/13.<br>
The Pluronic surfactants are block copolymers of polyoxyethylene and<br>
polyoxypropylene, generally having an average molecular weight from about 3,000 to<br>
about 15,000. The ethoxylated portion of the blocked copolymer generally constitutes<br>
from about 30 to about 80% by weight of the molecule. Particularly good results are<br>
achievable with Pluronic F68, F108 and F127, but in any case, it is to be noted that the<br>
Pluronic constituent should also have an HLB above 10, irrespective of the particular<br>
grade which is selected. For example, Pluronic F108 has an average molecular weight of<br>
14,600, a polyoxyethylene content of about 80 weight % and an HLB value in excess of<br>
24, and Pluronic F127 has an average molecular weight of 12,600, a polyoxyethylene<br>
content of about 70 weight % and an HLB value from 18 to 23.<br>
The weight ratio of the combined saturated polyglycolyzed glycerides:<br>
polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block co-polymer generally range between 0.10-99.9<br>
to 99.9:0.10, with preferred ratios being 1:9, 2:8, 3:7, 4:6, 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, 8.2, and 9:1.<br>
These combinations especially the 5:5 ratio, yields a mixture having a melting point in the<br>
range of 44-70°C, preferably 50°C-70oC.<br>
The composition of saturated polyglycolized glyceride and polyglyoxyproplyene-<br>
block copolymer is combined with a therapeutic agent, wherein said composition is<br>
present in the final composition, the latter including the therapeutic agent, in a range of<br>
about 0.10-99.9% by weight, with the preferred range being 5-75% by weight of the final<br>
composition. Poorly soluble agents, e.g., therapeutic agents which have an intrinsic water<br>
solubility of less than 10.0 g/1 are particularly benefitted by the present invention<br>
Examples of drugs in this category are drugs belonging to the dihydropyridine class of<br>
compounds (e.g., nifedepine, felodipine, nicardipine), omperazole, spironolactonc,<br>
furosemide, terbutaline, riboflavine, gemfibrozil, indomethacin, ibuprofen, phenytoin,<br>
glyburide. In addition, any drug which has a water solubility of less than 10.0 g/l<br>
belonging to, for example, cardiovascular, cholesterol lowering, anti-hypertensive,<br>
antiepileptic, hormonal, hypogrycemic, antiviral, immunosuppressive, antihistaminic, nasal<br>
decongestant, antimicrobial, antiarrthrytic, analgesic, antimycobacterial, anticancer,<br>
diuretic, antifungal, antiparasitic, protein, peptide, CNS stimulants, CNS depressants, 5-<br>
HT inhibitors, anti-schizophrenia, anti-Alzheimer, antipsoriatic, steroidal, oligonucleotide,<br>
antiulcer, proton pump inhibitor, anti asthmatic, bronchodialators, thrombolytics, vitamin<br>
class of therapeutic agents, any combinations thereof may be used in this composition in<br>
order to form solid state solutions and dispersions.<br>
The final composition optionally comprises the following further excipients at 5-<br>
95%, especially 10-70% by weight of the final composition. Examples of the further<br>
excipients include, but are not limited to ascorbyl palmitate, glycerol, glyceryl monooleate,<br>
glyceryl monostecate, glyceryl palmitosterate, triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides,<br>

sterates, polyvinyl alcohol, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyl sterates, polyethylene glycol<br>
hydroxysterate, polyoxyethylene alcohols, anionic, cationic, amphiphillic compounds,<br>
carbohydrates (lactose, maltodcxtrins, sucrose, starch, etc.), polyols (sorbitol, mannitol,<br>

inorganic compounds (calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate), polyoxyethylene castor<br>
oil derivatives, propylcnc carbonate, anionic emulsifying wax, white wax, yellow wax,<br>
hydrogenated vegetable oil, triacetin, triethyl citrate and other plasticizers (food and<br>
pharmaceutical grade), lecithin, phospholipids, soybean oil, sesame oil, cotton seed oil,<br>
sunflower oil, peanut oil, mineral oil, hydrogenated castor oil, water soluble and insoluble<br>
derivatives of cellulose (e.g. ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, HPMC, HPC, cellulose<br>
acetate phthalate, etc.), methacrylates and polymethacrylates (e.g., Eudragit®), canola oil,<br>
benzoic acid and its salts, methyl-, propyl- and butyl-para-amino benzoic acid (paraben)<br>
(preservatives), organic acids (e.g., fumaric, adipic, maleic, etc.), ethyl alcohol, saccharine,<br>
cyclamate sodium, and other artificial sweeteners, food and pharmaceutical flavoring<br>
agents, bioflavanoids (e.g., quercetin, isoquercetin), citrus bioflavanoids (e.g., naringin),<br>
citrus bioflavanoid complexes, and other agents that inhibit the enzyme cytochrome P450<br>
4A4 (also called as CYP3A4), galactose oligosaccharides (example of a functional<br>
carbohydrate), lubricant (e.g. magnesium sterate), anti-caking agent (e.g., silicon dioxide,<br>
sodium aluminum silicate, magnesium trisilicate, talc, etc.,), gums (locust bean gum, gum<br>
arabic, arabinogalactan, etc.); and any combination of said excipients.<br>
To enhance the solubility, of the therapeutically active agent, an aspect of this<br>
invention provides that the composition of the therapeutic reactive agent, the<br>
polyglycolyzed glyceride and the polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block co-polymer<br>
is formed into a solid state solution or solid state dispersion.)<br>
A solid state solution is defined as a solution of the drug in a solid form. A solid<br>
state solution of a drug is characterized by the lack of a melting point peak at the melting<br>
point of the drug indicating the absence of the solid state of the drug. A solid state<br>
solution-dispersion is defined as a system in which part of the system may be in the solid<br>
solution form and part of it may be in the form of a finely dispersed solid form in the<br>
system. This solid, state solution - dispersion is further defined as a system in which more<br>
than 1% of the total drug content can exist as a solid solution and more than 1% of the<br>
drug can exist as a solid dispersion with a particle size distribution such that 90% of the<br>
particles have a diameter less than 10 microns. The weight ratio between the solid state<br>
solubilized drug: dispersed drug may be in the range of 1.0-100:99-0. It is desirable that<br>
30-100% of the drug exists as a solid state solution. The ratio of the amount of drug<br>
present in the form of a solid state solution to the amount present as a solid dispersion is<br>
easily ascertained by the use of techniques in thermal analysis such as Differential<br>
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and Differential<br>
Scanning Microcalorimetry. The crystallinity of the drug is easily determined by X-ray<br>
diffraction. Furthermore, when determined by thermal analytical techniques it is desirable<br>
that the final composition have at least "one" distinct melting peak in the range of 30-<br>
80°C associated with the melting point of the non-drug components of the final<br>
composition.<br>
To produce the final composition polyglycolyzed glycerides and<br>
polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block co-polymer are heated sufficiently to form a<br>
melt of the ingredients, for example to at least about 20°C above the combined melting<br>
point. The therapeutic agent is added gradually to the molten mixture of polyglycolyzed<br>
glycerides and polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block co-polymer. It is preferable to<br>
mill or micronize the drug to a particle size range such that the particle diameter of 90%<br>
of the particles is less than 75 microns. The mixture is maintained at a sufficient<br>
temperature, for example, at least about 20°C above the combined melting point of the<br>
polyglycolyzed glycerides; polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block co-polymer mixture<br>
for a sufficient time to dissolve or disperse the pharmaceutical agent.<br>
The optional excipients may be added to the above mentioned system to,<br>
(A) Increase the solubility of the drug in the polyglycolyzed glycerides;<br>
polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylenc block co-polymer system.<br>
(B) Set the melting point of the non-drug components, such that at least "one"<br>
melting point peak belonging to the non-drug components is present<br>
between 30-80°C in the final composition, when analyzed by thermal<br>
analytical techniques.<br>
The resulting mixture is then maintained in the molten form, for example, at least<br>
20°C above the combined melting point of the non-drug components, with constant<br>
stirring to ensure homogenous distribution of the drug in the system. Thereafter, the<br>
mixture may be subjected to one or more of the following operations:<br>
I) Allowed to congeal to a solid mass, and then extruded through a hot melt<br>
extruder into a powder.<br>
II) Milled using equipment that would maintain the milling conditions at room<br>
temperature or below the melting point of the non drug components of the<br>
system to enable milling the composition into a powder.<br>
III) Spray congealed in a spray drier or fluidized bed drier to a powder.<br>
IV) Congealed onto one or more of said excipients in a spray drier, fluidized bed<br>
drier, rotor, high shear granulator, planetary mixer, blender, or any<br>
conventional food and pharmaceutical processing equipment.<br>
V) The above mentioned powders may then be used in the formulation of<br>
conventional, specialised, and novel pharmaceutical dosage forms such as<br>
tablets, capsules, powders for inhalation, suppositories, suspensions, and<br>
emulsions.<br>
VI) Alternatively, the molten mixture can be congealed into or onto a solid<br>
pharmaceutical dosage form such as, for example, a tablet, capsule, and/or<br>
granule.<br>
The entire disclosure of all applications, patents and publications, cited above and<br>
below, and also U.S. provisional application 60/063,338 filed October 27, 1997 are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the<br>
preceding description, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following<br>
preferred specific embodiments are. therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and<br>
not limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever.<br>
In the foregoing and in the following examples, all temperatures are set forth<br>
uncorrected in degrees Celsius and unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages<br>
are by weight.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1:<br>
Three grams of Gelucire of 50/13 and 3 grams of Pluronic F68 are melted and<br>
two grams of nifedipine are dissolved therein. The resultant solution is added to 4 grams<br>
of sorbitol while stirring. The resultant solution is then cooled down and passed through<br>
a 20 mesh screen. The resultant paniculate solids were solid solutions.<br>
Example 2:<br>
In this example, felodipine is employed as the active pharmaceutical agent. Thus,<br>
1.5 grams of Gelucire 50/13 and 1.5 grains of Pluronic F68 were melted together and 1<br>
gram of felodipine was added thereto. This resultant solution was then introduced into<br>
4 grams of Sorbitol P300® while stirring. After mixing, the solution was cooled and<br>
ultimately passed through a 20 mesh screen. The resultant paniculate solids were in a<br>
solid state solution-dispersion system.<br>
Example 3:<br>
In this example, felodipine is employed as the active pharmaceutical agent. Thus,<br>
1.5 grams of Gelucire 50/13 and 1.5 grams of Pluronic F68 were melted together and 1.5<br>
grams of felodipine was added thereto. This resultant solution was then introduced into<br>
4 grams of Sorbitol P300® while stirring. After mixing, the solution was cooled and<br>
ultimately passed through a 20 mesh screen. The resultant paniculate solids were in a<br>
solid state solution system.<br>
Example 4:<br>
In this example, felodipine is employed as the active pharmaceutical agent. Thus,<br>
1 gram of Gelucire 50/13 and 1 gram of Pluronic F68 were melted together and 1.5 grams<br>
of felodipine was admixed. This resultant solution was then added to 2.67 grams of<br>
Avecil, a brand of microcrystalline cellulose. After mixing, the solution was cooled and<br>
ultimately passed through a 20 mesh screen. The resultant paniculate solids were in a<br>
solid state solution-dispersion system.<br>
For the purposes of increasing the melting point of the composition of Examples<br>
2, 3 and 4, Pluronic F127 can be substituted for Pluronic F68.<br>
To determine the improvement achieved by the present invention with respect to<br>
the solubility of pure felodipine, the formulations of Examples 3 and 4 were evaluated by<br>
the following technique.<br>
The solubility characteristics of the compositions of Examples 3 and 4 as<br>
compared to pure felodipine were evaluated, as follows:<br>
6.8 mg of felodipine and 34.8 mg of the composition of Example 3 and 34.2<br>
Example 4 are respectively placed into 500 ml of a 40% PEG solution<br>
maintained at 37°C.<br>
The solution was stirred with a paddle stirrer at 50 rpm. The absorbency was measured<br>
with a Hitachi spectrometer at 362 nm. The percent release is based on the standard<br>
curve: absorbents = 0.216 cone, (mg/900 ml)-0.00274, and the following results were<br>
obtained.<br>
From the above table, it is dear that the present invention provides a substantially<br>
enhanced solubility as compared to the pure drug.<br>
Example 5:<br>
For the production of tablets 121.5 mg of HPMC (hydropropylmethyl cellulose)<br>
are mixed with 21.1 gm of Sorbitol Instant P300®, 246.88 mg of Microcrystalline<br>
Cellulose and 59.62 mg of the composition of Example 3. 1 mg of magnesium stearate<br>
was then added to the above mixture with stirring The resultant mixture was tableted in<br>
a Carver® press under a pressure of 2 tons.<br>
Example 6:<br>
Another tablet was produced from the composition of Example 3 by the method<br>
of Example 5 except in this case, the amount of Example 3 was 59.52 mg,<br>
Microcrystalline Cellulose 231.98 mg, Sorbitol Instant P300® 45 mg and HPMC 112.5<br>
mg, with sodium stearyl fumeratc (PRUV)® being substituted for magnesium stearate.<br>
The resultant tablet has 10% sorbitol.<br>
Example 7:<br>
In this example, a 15% sorbitol tablet is produced in the same manner as the last<br>
example except that the amount of sorbitol is 67.5 mg and the amount of Microcrystalline<br>
Cellulose is 209.48 mg.<br>
