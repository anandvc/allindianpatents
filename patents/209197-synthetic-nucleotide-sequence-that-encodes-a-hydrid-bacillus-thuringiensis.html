Novel insecticidal toxins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal crystal proteins<br>
The invention relates to novel insecticidal toxins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal crystal proteins, nucleic acid sequences whose expression results in said toxins, and methods of making and methods of using the toxins and corresponding nucleic acid sequences to control insects.<br>
Insect pests are a major cause of crop losses. Solely in the US, billions of dollars are lost every year due to infestation by various genera of insects. In addition to losses in field crops, insect pests are also a burden to vegetable and fruit growers, to producers of ornamental flowers, and they are a nuisance to gardeners and homeovvners.<br>
Insect pests are mainly controlled by intensive applications of chemical insecticides, which are active through inhibition of insect growth, prevention of insect feeding or reproduction, or death of the insects. Good insect control can thus be reached, but these chemicals can sometimes also affect other, beneficial insects. Another problem resulting from the wide use of chemical pesticides is the appearance of resistant insect varieties. This has been partially alleviated by various resistance management strategies, but there is an increasing need for alternative pest control agents.<br>
Biological insect control agents, such as Bacillus thuringiensis strains expressing insecticidal toxins have also been applied with satisfactory results, offering an alternative or a complement to chemical insecticides. Bacillus thuringiensis belongs to the large group of gram-positive, aerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. Unlike other very closely related species of Bacillus such as B. cereus or B. anthracis, the majority of the hitherto known Bacillus thuringiensis species produce in the course of their sporulation a parasporal inclusion body which, on account of its crystalline structure, is generally referred to also as a crystalline body. This crystalline body is composed of insecticidally active crystalline protoxin proteins, the so-called 6-endotoxins. These protein crystals are responsible for the toxicity to insects of Bacillus thuringiensis. The 5-endotoxin does not exhibit its insecticidal activity until after oral intake of the crystalline body, when the latter is dissolved in the intestinal juice of the target insects. In most cases the actual toxic component is released from the protoxin as a result of proteolytic cleavage caused by the action of proteases from the digestive tract of the insects.<br><br>
The 5-endotoxins of the various Bacillus thuringiensis strains are characterized by high specificity with respect to certain target insects, especially with respect to various Lepidoptera, Coleoptcra and Diptera larvae, and by a high degree of activity against these larvae. A further advantage in using 5-endotoxins of Bacillus thuringiensis resides in the fact that the toxins are harmless to humans, other mammals, birds and fish.<br>
Based on sequence homology and insecticidal specificity. Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins have been categorized into different classes. Best studied are the Cryl class of proteins, which are produced as 140 kDa pro-toxins and are active towards lepidopterans. To some extent the mode of action of crystal proteins has been elucidated. After oral uptake the crystals dissolve in the alkaline environment of the larval midgut. The solubilized proteins are subsequently processed by midgut proteinases (e.g. trypsin) to a proteinase-resistant toxic fragment of about 65kDa that binds to receptors on epithelial cells of the insect midgut and penetrates the cell membrane. This eventually leads to bursting of the cells and death of the larvae.<br>
The activity spectrum of a particular crystal protein is to a large extent determined by the occurrence of receptors on the midgut epithelial cells of susceptible insects. The spectrum is co-determined by the efficiency of solubilization of the crystal protein and its proteolytic activation in vivo. The importance of the binding of the crystal protein to midgut epithelial receptors is further demonstrated where insects have developed resistance to one of the crystal proteins in that the binding of crystal proteins to midgut epithelial cells in resistant insects is significantly reduced.<br>
In the past several years, the genes coding for some of these crystal proteins have been isolated and their expression in heterologous hosts have been shown to provide another tool for the control of economically important insect pests. In particular, the expression of insecticidal toxins in transgenic plants, such as Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins, has provided efficient protection against selected insect pests, and transgenic plants expressing such toxins have been commercialized, allowing farmers to reduce applications of chemical insect control agents. Furthermore, it is also possible to express recombinant toxins that have a chosen combination of functions designed to enhance the degree of insecticidal activity against a particular insect or insect class, or to expand the spectrum of insects against which the toxin<br><br>
protein is active. For example, chimeric insecticidal proteins can be constructed having novel sequences not found in nature by combining the toxin portion from one 5-endotoxin with the protoxin (tail) portion of a different 5-endotoxin. See, for example, WO 98/15170, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Toxic fragments of crystal proteins are thought to be composed of three distinct structural domains.  Domain  I, the most  N-terminal domain, consists of 7 a-helices and probably is partially or entirely inserted in the target cell membrane. Domain II comprises ? R-sheets in a so-called Greek key-conformation.   Domain II is believed by most researchers to interact with receptors and to thereby determine toxin specificity.    Indeed, there is much evidence implicating domain II residues in specific toxicity and in high affinity binding. Domain III, the most C-terminal domain, consists of two 6-sheets in a so-called jellyroU conformation and has also been implicated in determining specificity. Swapping domain III between toxins, such as by in vivo recombination between the coding regions, can result in changes in specific activity.   Binding experiments using such hybrids have shown that domain III is involved in binding to putative receptors of target insects, suggesting that domain III may exert its role in specificity through a role in receptor recognition. If projected on Cryl sequences, domain I runs from about amino acid residue 28 to 260, domain II from about 260 to 460 and domain III from about 460 to 600.  See, Nakamura et al., Agric. Biol Chem. 54(3); 715-724 (1990); Li et al, Nature 353: 815-821 (1991); Ge et al, J- Biol Chem. 266(27): 17954-17958 (1991); and Honee et al, Mol Microbiol 5(11): 2799-2806 (1991); each of which are incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,131, incorporated herein by reference describes Bacillus thuringiensis hybrid toxin fragments comprising at their C-terminus domain HI of a first Cry protein and at its N-terminus domains I and II of a second Cry protein. Such hybrid crystal proteins have altered insecticidal specificity.   For example, the H04 hybrid toxin, which is also described in De Maagd et al, Appl Environ. Microbiol 62(5): 1537-1543 (1996), comprises at its N-terminus domains I and II of CrylAb and at its C-terminus domain III of CrylC.   H04 is reportedly highly toxic to Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm) compared with the parental CrylAb toxin and significantly more toxic than the CrylC parental toxin.  See also, Bosch et al, FEMS Microbiology Letters 118: 129-134 (1994); Bosch et al, Bio/Technology 12: 915-918 (1994); De<br><br>

Despite the previous successes realized by incorporation of insect resistant gent^s through breeding programs and genetic engineering, there remains a long-felt but unfulfilled need to discover new and effective insect control agents. Particularly needed are control agents that are targeted to economically important insect pests such as European Com Borer and Fall Army Worm and that efficiently control insect species resistant to existing insect control agents. Furthermore, agents whose application minimizes the burden on the environment are desirable.<br>
The present invention addresses the aforementioned needs by providing novel gene sequences that encode hybrid Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, including synthetic nucleotide sequences optimized for expression in plants. In preferred embodiments, the novel gene sequences encode varying forms of the hybrid Bacillus thuringiensis delta-endotoxin H04, the toxin portion of which contains domains I and II of CrylAb and domain III of CrylC. The hybrid Bacillus thuringiensis toxins encoded by the novel gene sequences are highly active against economically important insect pests such as fall armyworm, pink bollworm, tobacco budworm, European cornborer, and diamondback moth. The hybrid Bacillus thuringiensis toxins can be used in multiple insect control strategies, resulting in maximal efficiency with minimal impact on the environment.<br>
The invention is further drawn to the hybrid insecticidal toxins resulting fi-om the expression of the nucleotide sequences of the invention, and to compositions and formulations containing the hybrid insecticidal toxins, which are capable of inhibiting the ability of insect pests to survive, grow or reproduce, or of limiting insect-related damage or loss in crop plants. The invention is further drawn to a method of making the hybrid toxins and to methods of using the nucleotide sequences, for example in transgenic plants to confer insect resistance, and to methods of using the toxins, and compositions and formulations comprising the toxins, for example applying the toxins, composition, or formulation to insect infested areas, or to prophylactically treat insect susceptible areas or plants to confer protection or resistance against harmful insects. The hybrid toxins can be used in multiple insect control strategies, resulting in maximal efficiency with minimal impact on the environment.<br><br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
"Activity" of the toxins of the invention is meant that the toxins function as orally active insect control agents, have a toxic effect, or are able to disrupt or deter insect feeding, which may or may not cause death of the insect. When a toxin of the invention is delivered to<br><br>
the insect, the result is typically death of the insect, or the insect does not feed upon the source that makes the toxin available to the insect.<br>
"Associated with / operatively linked" refer to two nucleic acid sequences that are related physically or functionally. For example, a promoter or regulatory DNA sequence is said to be "associated with" a DNA sequence that codes for an RNA or a protein if the two sequences are operatively linked, or situated such that the regulator DNA sequence will affect the expression level of the coding or structural DNA sequence.<br>
"Binding site" means a site on a molecule wherein the binding between site and toxin is reversible such that the Ka between site and toxin is on the order of at least 104 dm3 mole'-1<br>
A "chimeric gene" is a recombinant nucleic acid sequence in which a promoter or regulatory nucleic acid sequence is operatively linked to, or associated with, a nucleic acid sequence that codes for an mRNA or which is expressed as a protein, such that the regulator nucleic acid sequence is able to regulate transcription or expression of the associated nucleic acid sequence. The regulator nucleic acid sequence of the chimeric gene is not normally operatively linked to the associated nucleic acid sequence as found in nature.<br>
A "coding sequence" is a nucleic acid sequence that is transcribed into RNA such as mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, sense RNA or antisense RNA. Preferably the RNA is then translated in an organism to produce a protein.<br>
Complementary: "complementary" refers to two nucleotide sequences that comprise antiparaUel nucleotide sequences capable of pairing with one another upon formation of hydrogen bonds between the complementary base residues in the antiparaUel nucleotide sequences.<br>
"Conservatively modified variations" of a particular nucleic acid sequence refers to those nucleic acid sequences that encode identical or essentiaUy identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid sequence does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionaUy identical nucleic acids encode any given polypeptide. For instance the codons CGT, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG aU encode the amino acid arginine. Thus, at every position where an arginine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded protein. Such nucleic acid variations are "sUent variations" which are one species of "conservatively modified variations."<br><br>
Every nucleic acid sequence described herein which encodes a protein also describes every possible silent variation, except where otherwise noted. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except ATG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule by standard techniques. Accordingly, each "silent variation' of a nucleic acid which encodes a protein is implicit in each described sequence.<br>
Furthermore, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions deletions or additions that alter, add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids (typically less than 5%, more typically less than 1%) in an encoded sequence are "conservatively modified variations," where the alterations result in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. The following five groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: Aliphatic: Glycine (G), Alanine (A), Valine (V), Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I); Aromatic: Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y)*, Tryptophan (W); Sulfur-containing: Methionine (M), Cysteine (C); Basic: Arginine (R), Lysine (K), Histidine (H); Acidic: Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E), Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q). See also, Creighton (1984) Proteins, W.H, Freeman and Company. In addition, individual substitutions, deletions or additions which alter, add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in an encoded sequence are also "conservatively modified variations."<br>
To "control" insects means to inhibit, through a toxic effect, the ability of insect pests to survive, grow, feed, and/or reproduce, or to limit insect-related damage or loss in crop plants. To "control" insects may or may not mean killing the insects, although it preferably means killing the insects.<br>
Corresponding to: in the context of the present invention, "corresponding to" or "corresponds to" means that when the nucleic acid coding sequences or amino acid sequences of different 5-endotoxins of Bacillus thuringiensis are aligned with each other, the nucleic or amino acids that "correspond to" certain enumerated positions are those that align with these positions but that are not necessarily in these exact numerical positions relative to the particular 5-endotoxin's respective nucleic acid coding sequence or amino acid sequence.<br><br>
Likewise, when the coding or amino acid sequence of a particular 5-endotoxin (for example, CrylB) is aligned with the coding or amino acid sequence of a reference 5-endotoxin (for example, CrylAb), the nucleic acids or amino acids in the CrylB sequence that "correspond to' certain enumerated positions of the CrylAb sequence are those that align with these positions of the CrylAb sequence, but are not necessarily in these exact numerical positions of the CrylB toxin's respective nucleic acid coding sequence or amino acid sequence.<br>
To "deliver" a toxin means that the toxin comes in contact with an insect, resulting in toxic effect and control of the insect. The toxin can be delivered in many recognized ways, e.g., orally by ingestion by the insect or by contact with the insect via transgenic plant expression, formulated protein composition(s), sprayable protein composition(s), a bait matrix, or any other art-recognized toxin delivery system.<br>
"Expression cassette" as used herein means a nucleic acid sequence capable of directing expression of a particular nucleotide sequence in an appropriate host cell, comprising a promoter operably linked to the nucleotide sequence of interest which is operably linked to termination signals. It also typically comprises sequences required for proper translation of the nucleotide sequence. The expression cassette comprising the nucleotide sequence of interest may be chimeric, meaning that at least one of its components is heterologous with respect to at least one of its other components. The expression cassette may also be one which is naturally occurring but has been obtained in a recombinant form useful for heterologous expression. TypicaUy, however, the expression cassette is heterologous with respect to the host, i.e., the particular nucleic acid sequence of the expression cassette does not occur naturally in the host cell and must have been introduced into the host cell or an ancestor of the host cell by a transformation event. The expression of the nucleotide sequence in the expression cassette may be under the control of a constitutive promoter or of an inducible promoter which initiates transcription only when the host cell is exposed to some particular external stimulus. In the case of a multicellular organism, such as a plant, the promoter can also be specific to a particular tissue, or organ, or stage of development.<br>
Gene: the term "gene" is used broadly to refer to any segment of DNA associated with a biological function. Thus, genes include coding sequences and/or the regulatory sequences required for their expression. Genes also include nonexpressed DNA segments that, for<br><br>
example, form recognition sequences for other proteins. Genes can be obtained from a variety of sources, including cloning from a source of interest or synthesizing from known or predicted sequence information, and may include sequences designed to have desired parameters.<br>
"Gene of interest" refers to any gene which, when transferred to a plant, confers upon the plant a desired characteristic such as antibiotic resistance, virus resistance, insect resistance, disease resistance, or resistance to other pests, herbicide tolerance, improved nutritional value, improved performance in an industrial process or altered reproductive capability. The "gene of interest" may also be one that is transferred to plants for the production of commercially valuable enzymes or metabolites in the plant.<br>
As used herein, "H04" refers to the hybrid Bt toxin described in De Maagd et al, Appl Environ. Microbiol. 62(5): 1537-1543 (1996), the toxin fragment of which comprises at its N-terminus domains I and II of Cryl Ab and at its C-terminus domain III of CrylC.<br>
Heterologous nucleic acid sequence: The terms "heterologous nucleic acid [or DNA] sequence", "exogenous nucleic acid [or DNA] segment" or "heterologous gene," as used herein, each refer to a sequence that originates from a source foreign to the particular host cell or, if from the same source, is modified from its original form. Thus, a heterologous gene in a host cell includes a gene that is endogenous to the particular host cell but has been modified through, for example, the use of codon optimization. The terms also includes non-naturaUy occurring multiple copies of a naturally occurring sequence. Thus, the terms refer to a nucleic acid segment that is foreign or heterologous to the cell, or homologous to the cell but in a position within the host cell nucleic acid in which the element is not ordinarily found. Exogenous nucleic acid segments are expressed to yield exogenous polypeptides.<br>
A "homologous" nucleic acid [or DNA] sequence is a nucleic acid [or DNA] sequence naturally associated with a host cell into which it is introduced.<br>
"Homologous recombination" is the reciprocal exchange of nucleic acid fragments between homologous nucleic acid molecules.<br>
"Homoplastidic" refers to a plant, plant tissue or plant cell wherein all of the plastids are genetically identical. This is the normal state in a plant when the plastids have not been transformed, mutated, or otherwise genetically altered. In different tissues or stages of development, the plastids may take different forms, e.g., chloroplasts, proplastids, etioplasts, amyloplasts, chromoplasts, and so forth.<br><br>
The terms "identical" or percent "identity" in the context of two or more nucleic acid or protein sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the sequence comparison algorithms described below or by visual inspection.<br>
"Insecticidal" is defined as a toxic biological activity capable of controlling insects, preferably by killing them.<br>
A nucleic acid sequence is "isocoding with" a reference nucleic acid sequence when the nucleic acid sequence encodes a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as the polypeptide encoded by the reference nucleic acid sequence.<br>
An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule or an isolated enzyme is a nucleic acid molecule or enzyme that, by the hand of man, exists apart from its native environment and is therefore not a product of nature. An isolated nucleic acid molecule or enzyme may exist in a purified form or may exist in a non-native environment such as, for example, a recombinant host cell.<br>
A "juncture" between toxin domains in a hybrid toxin, i.e., between domains II and III of a hybrid insecticidal toxin according to the invention, is the homologous crossover region or site in the hybrid. Amino acids to the left of the crossover site are from one parental toxin, whereas amino acids to the right of the crossover site are from the other parental toxin.<br>
Mature Protein: protein that is normally targeted to a cellular organelle and from which the transit peptide has been removed.<br>
Minimal Promoter: promoter elements, particularly a TATA element, that are inactive or that have greatly reduced promoter activity in the absence of upstream activation. In the presence of a suitable transcription factor, the minimal promoter functions to permit transcription.<br>
Native: refers to a gene that is present in the genome of an untransformed cell.<br>
Naturally occurring: the term "naturally occurring" is used to describe an object that can be found in nature as distinct from being artificially produced by man. For example, a protein or nucleotide sequence present in an organism (including a virus), which can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory, is naturally occurring.<br><br>
Nucleic acid: the term "nucleic acid" refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g. degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences and as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al, Nucleic Acid Res. 19: 5081 (1991);Ohtsuka^rc//-, 7. BioL Chem. 260: 2605-2608 (1985); Rossolini ^f a/., Moi Cell Probes 8: 91-98 (1994)). The terms "nucleic acid" or "nucleic acid sequence" may also be used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, and mRNA encoded by a gene.<br>
"ORF' means Open Reading Frame.<br>
By "part" of a protein is meant a peptide comprised by said protein and having at least 80%<br>
of the consecutive sequence thereof.<br>
A "plant" is any plant at any stage of development, particularly a seed plant.<br>
A "plant cell" is a structural and physiological unit of a plant, comprising a protoplast and a cell wall. The plant cell may be in form of an isolated single cell or a cultured cell, or as a part of higher organized unit such as, for example, plant tissue, a plant organ, or a whole plant.<br>
"Plant cell culture" means cultures of plant units such as, for example, protoplasts, cell culture cells, cells in plant tissues, pollen, pollen tubes, ovules, embryo sacs, zygotes and embryos at various stages of development.<br>
"Plant material" refers to leaves, stems, roots, flowers or flower parts, fruits, pollen, egg cells, zygotes, seeds, cuttings, cell or tissue cultures, or any other part or product of a plant.<br>
A "plant organ" is a distinct and visibly structured and differentiated part of a plant such as a root, stem, leaf, flower bud, or embryo.<br>
"Plant tissue" as used herein means a group of plant cells organized into a structural and functional unit.   Any tissue of a plant in planta or in culture is included.   This term<br><br>
includes, but is not limited to, whole plants, plant organs, plant seeds, tissue culture and any groups of plant cells organized into structural and/or functional units. The use of this term in conjunction with, or in the absence of, any specific type of plant tissue as listed above or otherwise embraced by this definition is not intended to be exclusive of any other type of plant tissue.<br>
A "promoter" is an untranslated DNA sequence upstream of the coding region that contains the binding site for RNA polymerase II and initiates transcription of the DNA. The promoter region may also include other elements that act as regulators of gene expression.<br>
A "protoplast" is an isolated plant cell without a cell wall or with only parts of the cell wall.<br>
Purified: the term "purified," when applied to a nucleic acid or protein, denotes that the nucleic acid or protein is essentially free of other cellular components with which it is associated in the natural state. It is preferably in a homogeneous state although it can be in either a dry or aqueous solution. Purity and homogeneity are typically determined using analytical chemistry techniques such as'polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. A protein which is the predominant species present in a preparation is substantially purified. The term "purified" denotes that a nucleic acid or protein gives rise to essentially one band in an electrophoretic gel. Particularly, it means that the nucleic acid or protein is at least about 50% pure, more preferably at least about 85% pure, and most preferably at least about 99% pure.<br>
Two nucleic acids are "recombined" when sequences from each of the two nucleic acids are combined in a progeny nucleic acid. Two sequences are "directly" recombined when both of the nucleic acids are substrates for recombination. Two sequences are "indirectly recombined" when the sequences are recombined using an intermediate such as a cross-over oligonucleotide. For indirect recombination, no more than one of the sequences is an actual substrate for recombination, and in some cases, neither sequence is a substrate for recombination.<br>
"Regulatory elements" refer to sequences involved in controlling the expression of a nucleotide sequence. Regulatory elements comprise a promoter operably linked to the nucleotide sequence of interest and termination signals. They also typically encompass sequences required for proper translation of the nucleotide sequence.<br><br>
Substantially identical: the phrase "substantially identical," in the context of two nucleic acid or protein sequences, refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that have at least 60%, preferably 80%, more preferably 90, even more preferably 95%, and most preferably at least 99% nucleotide or amino acid residue identity, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by visual inspection.  Preferably, the substantial identity exists over a region of the sequences that is at least about 50 residues in length, more preferably over a region of at least about 100 residues, and most preferably the sequences are substantially identical over at least about 150 residues. In a most preferred embodiment, the sequences are substantially identical over the entire length of the coding regions. Furthermore, substantially identical nucleic acid or protein sequences perform substantially the same function.<br>
For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.<br>
Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith &amp; Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math, 2: 482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman &amp; Wunsch, J. Mol BioL 48: 443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson &amp; Lipman, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85: 2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFTT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by visual inspection (see generally, Ausubel et al, infra).<br>
One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et at., J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 (1990). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identiiying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is<br><br>
referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al, 1990). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always &gt; 0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always 
In addition to calculating percent sequence identity, the BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin &amp; Altschul, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 90: 5873-5787 (1993)). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a test nucleic acid sequence is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid sequence to the reference nucleic acid sequence is less than about 0.1, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.<br>
Another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. The phrase "hybridizing specifically to" refers to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule only to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture (e.g., total cellular) DNA or RNA. 'Bind(s) substantially" refers to complementary hybridization between a probe nucleic acid and a target nucleic acid and<br><br>
embraces minor mismatches that can be accommodated by reducing the stringency of the hybridization media to achieve the desired detection of the target nucleic acid sequence.<br>
"Stringent hybridization conditions" and "stringent hybridization wash conditions" in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments such as Southern and Northern hybridizations are sequence dependent, and are different under different environmental parameters. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen (1993) Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes part I chapter 2 "Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid probe assays" Elsevier, New York. Generally, highly stringent hybridization and wash conditions are selected to be about 5"C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. Typically, under "stringent conditions" a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence, but to no other sequences.<br>
The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Very stringent conditions are selected to be equal to the Tm for a particular probe. An example of stringent hybridization conditions for hybridization of complementary nucleic acids which have more than 100 complementary residues on a filter in a Southern or northern blot is 50% formamide with 1 mg of heparin at 42oC, with the hybridization being carried out overnight. An example of highly stringent wash conditions is 0.1 5M NaCl at IT'C for about 15 minutes. An example of stringent wash conditions is a 0.2x SSC wash at 65°C for 15 minutes (see, Sambrook, infra, for a description of SSC buffer). Often, a high stringency wash is preceded by a low stringency wash to remove background probe signal. An example medium stringency wash for a duplex of, e.g., more than 1(X) nucleotides, is Ix SSC at 45°C for 15 minutes. An example low stringency wash for a duplex of, e.g., more than 100 nucleotides, is 4-6x SSC at 40oC for 15 minutes. For short probes (e.g., about 10 to 50 nucleotides), stringent conditions typically involve salt concentrations of less than about 1.0M Na ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3, and the temperature is typically at least about 30°C. Stringent conditions can also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. In general, a signal to noise ratio of 2x (or higher) than that observed for an unrelated probe in the particular hybridization assay indicates detection of a specific<br><br>
hybridization. Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially identical if the proteins that they encode are substantially identical. This occurs, e.g., when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code.<br>
The following are examples of sets of hybridization/wash conditions that may be used to clone homologous nucleotide sequences that are substantially identical to reference nucleotide sequences of the present invention: a reference nucleotide sequence preferably hybridizes to the reference nucleotide sequence in 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5 M NaPO4, 1 mM EDTA at 50oC with washing in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50°C, more desirably in 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5 M NaPO4, 1 mM EDTA at 50°C with washing in IX SSC, 0.1 % SDS at 50°C, more desirably still in 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5 M NaP04, 1 mM EDTA at 50°C with washing in 0.5X SSC, 0.1 % SDS at 50°C, preferably in 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5 M NaPO4, 1 mM EDTA at 50°C with washing in 0.1 X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50°C, more preferably in 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5 M NaPO4, 1 mM EDTA at 50°C  with washing in 0.1 X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C.<br>
A further indication that two nucleic acid sequences or proteins are substantially identical is that the protein encoded by the first nucleic acid is immunologically cross reactive with, or specifically binds to, the protein encoded by the second nucleic acid. Thus, a protein is typically substantially identical to a second protein, for example, where the two proteins differ only by conservative substitutions.<br>
The phrase "specifically (or selectively) binds to an antibody," or "specifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with," when referring to a protein or peptide, refers to a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of the protein in the presence of a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein and do not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions may require an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. For example, antibodies raised to the protein with the amino acid sequence encoded by any of the nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be selected to obtain antibodies specifically immunoreactive with that protein and not with other proteins except for polymorphic variants. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies<br><br>
specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays. Western blots, or immunohistochemistry are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York "Harlow and Lane"), for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity. Typically a specific or selective reaction will be at least twice background signal or noise and more typically more than 10 to 100 times background. A "subsequence" refers to a sequence of nucleic acids or amino acids that comprise a part of a longer sequence of nucleic acids or amino acids (e.g., protein) respectively.<br>
"Synthetic" refers to a nucleotide sequence comprising structural characters that are not present in the natural sequence. For example, an artificial sequence that resembles more closely the G+C content and the normal codon distribution of dicot and/or monocot genes is said to be synthetic.<br>
'Transformation" is a process for introducing heterologous nucleic acid into a host cell or organism. In particular, "transformation" means the stable integration of a DNA molecule into the genome of an organism of interest. Transformed cells, tissues, or insects are understood to encompass not only the end product of a transformation process, but also transgenic progeny thereof.<br>
'Transformed / transgenic / recombinant" refer to a host organism such as a bacterium or a plant into which a heterologous nucleic acid molecule has been introduced. The nucleic acid molecule can be stably integrated into the genome of the host or the nucleic acid molecule can also be present as an extrachromosomal molecule. Such an extrachromosomal molecule can be auto-replicating. Transformed cells, tissues, or plants are understood to encompass not only the end product of a transformation process, but also transgenic progeny thereof. A 'non-transformed", "non-transgenic", or "non-recombinant" host refers to a wild-type organism, e.g., a bacterium or plant, which does not contain the heterologous nucleic acid molecule.<br>
Nucleotides are indicated by their bases by the following standard abbreviations: adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and guanine (G). Amino acids are likewise indicated by the following standard abbreviations: alanine (Ala; A), arginine (Arg; R), asparagine (Asn; N), aspartic acid (Asp; D), cysteine (Cys; C), glutamine (Gin; Q), glutamic acid (Glu; E),<br><br>
glycine (Gly; G), histidine (His; H), isoleucine (He; I), leucine (Leu; L), lysine (Lys; K), methionine (Met; M), phenylalanine (Phe; F), proline (Pro; P), serine (Ser; S), threonine (Thr; T), tryptophan (Trp; W), tyrosine (Tyr; Y), and valine (Val; V). Furthermore, (Xaa; X) represents any amino acid.<br>
This invention relates to novel nucleic acid sequences whose expression results in novel toxins, and to the making and using of the toxins to control insect pests. In particular, the present invention concerns synthetic gene sequences optimized for expression in plants that encode varying forms of the hybrid Bacillus thuringiensis delta-endotoxin H04, the toxin portion of which contains domains I and II of Cryl Ab and domain III of CrylC. The hybrid gene encoding the H04 hybrid toxin, as constructed from the native crylAb and CrylC genes is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,131 and De Maagd et al, Appl Environ, Microbiol 62(5): 1537-1543 (1996). The preferred method for constructing the synthetic H04 genes of the invention is set forth in WO 93/07278. The hybrid Bacillus thuringiensis toxins encoded by the novel gene sequences are highly active against economically important insect pests such as fall armyworm, pink bollworm, tobacco budworm, European comborer, and diamondback moth. The hybrid Bacillus thuringiensis toxins can be used in multiple insect control strategies, resulting in maximal efficiency with minimal impact on the environment.<br>
The present invention encompasses DNA molecules comprising nucleotide sequences that encode the insecticidal toxins of the invention. The present invention further encompasses recombinant vectors comprising the nucleic acid sequences of this invention. In such vectors, the nucleic acid sequences are preferably comprised in expression cassettes comprising regulatory elements for expression of the nucleotide sequences in a host cell capable of expressing the nucleotide sequences. Such regulatory elements usually comprise promoter and termination signals and preferably also comprise elements allowing efficient translation of proteins encoded by the nucleic acid sequences of the present invention. Vectors comprising the nucleic acid sequences are usually capable of replication in particular host cells, preferably as extrachromosomal molecules, and are therefore used to amplify the nucleic acid sequences of this invention in the host cells. In one embodiment, host cells for such vectors are microorganisms, such as bacteria, in particular Bacillus thuringiensis or E coli. In another embodiment, host cells for such recombinant vectors are endophytes or epiphytes. A preferred<br><br>
host cell for such vectors is a eukaryotic cell, such as a plant cell.   Plant cells such as maize cells are most preferred host cells.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, an insecticidal toxin of the invention is expressed in a plant. In this case, transgenic plants expressing effective amounts of the toxins protect themselves from insect pests. When the insect starts feeding on such a transgenic plant, it also ingests the expressed toxins. This will deter the insect from further biting into the plant tissue or may even harm or kill the insect.<br>
The nucleic acid sequences described in this application can be incorporated into plant cells using conventional recombinant DNA technology. Generally, this involves inserting a coding sequence of the invention into an expression system to which the coding sequence is heterologous (i.e., not normally present) using standard cloning procedures known in the art. The vector contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein-coding sequences. A large number of vector systems known in the art can be used, such as plasmids, bacteriophage viruses and other modified viruses. Suitable vectors include, but are not limited to, viral vectors such as lambda vector systems A,gtll, λgt10 and Charon 4; plasmid vectors such as pBI 121, pBR322, pACYC177, pACYC184, pAR series, pKK223-3, pUC8, pUC9, pUC18, pUC19, pLG339, pRK290, pKC37, pKClOl, pCDNAII; and other similar systems. Transformed cells can be regenerated into whole plants such that the nucleotide sequences of the invention confer insect resistance to the transgenic plants.<br>
Plants transformed in accordance with the present invention may be monocots or dicots and include, but are not limited to, maize, wheat, barley, rye, sweet potato, bean, pea, chicory, lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, turnip, radish, spinach, asparagus, onion, garlic, pepper. celery, squash, pumpkin, hemp, zucchini, apple, pear, quince, melon (e.g., watermelon), plum, cherry, peach, nectarine, apricot, strawberry, grape, raspberry, blackberry, pineapple, avocado, papaya, mango, banana, soybean, tomato, sorghum, sugarcane, sugarbeet, sunflower, rapeseed, clover, tobacco, carrot, cotton, alfalfa, rice, potato, eggplant, cucumber, Arabidopsis, and woody plants such as coniferous and deciduous trees. Once a desired nucleotide sequence has been transformed into a particular plant species, it may be propagated in that species or moved into other varieties of the same species, particularly including commercial varieties, using traditional breeding techniques.<br><br>
For their expression in transgenic plants, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may require modification and optimization. Although in many cases genes from microbial organisms can be expressed in plants at high levels without modification, low expression in transgenic plants may result from microbial nucleotide sequences having codons that are not preferred in plants.   It is known in the art that all organisms have specific preferences for codon usage and the codons of the nucleotide sequences described in this invention can be changed to conform with plant preferences, while maintaining the amino acids encoded thereby. Furthermore, high expression in plants is best achieved from coding sequences that have at least 35% about GC content, preferably more than about 45%, more preferably more than about 50%, and most preferably more than about 60%. Microbial nucleotide sequences which have low GC contents may express poorly in plants due to the existence of ATTTA motifs which may destabilize messages, and AATAAA motifs which may cause inappropriate polyadenylation. Although preferred gene  sequences may be adequately expressed in both  monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species, sequences can be modified to account for the specific codon preferences  and  GC  content  preferences  of monocotyledons  or  dicotyledons  as  these preferences have been shown to differ (Murray et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 17: 477-498 (1989)). In addition, the nucleotide sequences are screened for the existence of illegitimate splice sites that may cause message truncation.    All changes required to be made within the nucleotide sequences such as those described above are made using well known techniques of site directed mutagenesis, PCR, and synthetic gene construction using the methods described in the published patent applications EP 0 385 962, EP 0 359 472, and WO 93/07278.<br>
For efficient initiation of translation, sequences adjacent to the initiating methionine may require modification. For example, they can be modified by the inclusion of sequences known to be effective in plants. Joshi has suggested an appropriate consensus for plants (NAR 15: 6643-6653 (1987)) and Clontech suggests a further consensus translation initiator (1993/1994 catalog, page 210). These consensuses are suitable for use with the nucleotide sequences of this invention. The sequences are incorporated into constructions comprising the nucleotide sequences, up to and including the ATG (whilst leaving the second amino acid unmodified), or alternatively up to and including the GTC subsequent to the ATG (with the possibility of modifying the second amino acid of the transgene).<br><br>
Expression of the nucleotide sequences in transgenic plants is driven by promoters shown to be functional in plants. The choice of promoter will vary depending on the temporal and spatial requirements for expression, and also depending on the target species. Thus, expression of the nucleotide sequences of this invention in leaves, in ears, in inflorescences (e.g. spikes, panicles, cobs, etc), in roots, and/or seedlings is preferred. In many cases, however, protection against more than one type of insect pest is sought, and thus expression in multiple tissues is desirable. Although many promoters from dicotyledons have been shown to be operational in monocotyledons and vice versa, ideally dicotyledonous promoters are selected for expression in dicotyledons, and monocotyledonous promoters for expression in monocotyledons. However, there is no restriction to the provenance of selected promoters; it is sufficient that they are operational in driving the expression of the nucleotide sequences in the desired cell.<br>
Preferred promoters that are expressed constitutively include promoters from genes encoding actin or ubiquitin and the CaMV 35S and 19S promoters. The nucleotide sequences of this invention can also be expressed under the regulation of promoters that are chemically regulated. This enables the insecticidal toxins to be synthesized only when the crop plants are treated with the inducing chemicals. Preferred technology for chemical induction of gene expression is detailed in the published application EP 0 332 104 and US patent 5,614,395. A preferred promoter for chemical induction is the tobacco PR-la promoter.<br>
A preferred category of promoters is that which is wound inducible. Numerous promoters have been described which are expressed at wound sites and also at the sites of phytopathogen infection. Ideally, such a promoter should only be active locally at the sites of infection, and in this way the insecticidal toxins only accumulate in cells which need to synthesize the insecticidal toxins to kill the invading insect pest. Preferred promoters of this kind include those described by Stanford et al, Mol. Gen. Genet, 215: 200-208 (1989), Xu et al, Plant Molec. Biol 22: 573-588 (1993), Logemann et al, Plant Cell 1: 151-158 (1989), Rohrmeier &amp; Lehle, Plant Molec. Biol. 22: 783-792 (1993), Firek et ai, Plant Molec. Biol 22: 129-142 (1993), and Warner et al., Plant J. 3: 19J-201 (1993).<br>
Preferred tissue specific expression patterns include green tissue specific, root specific, stem specific, and flower specific. Promoters suitable for expression in green tissue include many which regulate genes involved in photosynthesis and many of these have been cloned<br><br>
from both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. A preferred promoter is the maize PEPC promoter from the phosphoenol carboxylase gene (Hudspeth &amp; Grula, Plant Molec. Biol. 12: 579-589 (1989)). A preferred promoter for root specific expression is the maize mctallothionein-like (MTL) promoter described by de Framond (FEBS 290: 103-106 (1991); EP 0 452 269. A preferred stem specific promoter is that described in US patent 5,625,136 sand which drives expression of the maize trpA gene.<br>
Especially preferred embodiments of the invention are transgenic plants expressing at least one of the nucleotide sequences of the invention in a root-preferred or root-specific fashion. Further preferred embodiments are transgenic plants expressing the nucleotide sequences in a wound-inducible or pathogen infection-inducible manner.<br>
In addition to the selection of a suitable promoter, constructions for expression of an insecticidal toxin in plants require an appropriate transcription terminator to be attached downstream of the heterologous nucleotide sequence. Several such terminators are available and known in the art {e.g. tml from CaMV, E9 from rbcS). Any available terminator known to function in plants can be used in the context of this invention.<br>
Numerous other sequences can be incorporated into expression cassettes described in this invention. These include sequences which have been shown to enhance expression such as intron sequences {e.g. from Adhl and bronzel) and viral leader sequences {e.g. from TMV, MCMV and AMV).<br>
It may be preferable to target expression of the nucleotide sequences of the present invention to different cellular localizations in the plant. In some cases, localization in the cytosol may be desirable, whereas in other cases, localization in some subcellular organelle may be preferred. Subcellular localization of transgene encoded enzymes is undertaken using techniques well known in the art. Typically, the DNA encoding the target peptide from a known organelle-targeted gene product is manipulated and fused upstream of the nucleotide sequence. Many such target sequences are known for the chloroplast and their functioning in heterologous constructions has been shown. The expression of the nucleotide sequences of the present invention is also targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or to the vacuoles of the host cells. Techniques to achieve this are well-known in the art.<br>
Vectors suitable for plant transformation are described elsewhere in this specification. For Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, binary vectors or vectors carrying at least one T-<br><br>
DNA border sequence are suitable, whereas for direct gene transfer any vector is suitable and linear DNA containing only the construction of interest may be preferred. In the case of direct gene transfer, transformation with a single DNA species or co-transformation can be used (Schocher et al Biotechnology 4: 1093-1096 (1986)). For both direct gene transfer and Agrohacterium-mediated transfer, transformation is usually (but not necessarily) undertaken with a selectable marker which may provide resistance to an antibiotic (kanamycin, hygromycin or methotrexate) or a herbicide (basta). Examples of such markers are neomycin phosphotransferase, hygromycin phosphotransferase, dihydrofolate reductase, phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, 2, 2-dichloroproprionic acid dehalogenase, acetohydroxyacid synthase, 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-phosphate synthase, haloarylnitrilase, protoporhyrinogen oxidase, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, dihydropteroate synthase, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, and P-glucuronidase. Another type of marker providing for positive selection is the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (MPI/PMI) gene, which provides the ability to metabolize mannose mannose-6-phosphate isomerase. The choice of selectable or screenable marker for plant transformation is not, however, critical to the invention.<br>
The recombinant DNA described above can be introduced into the plant cell in a number of art-recognized ways. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the choice of method might depend on the type of plant targeted for transformation. Suitable methods of transforming plant cells include microinjection (Crossway et al., BioTechniques 4:320-334 (1986)), electroporation (Riggs et al, Proc, Natl. Acad, ScL USA 55.-5602-5606 (1986), Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Hinchee et al., Biotechnology 6:915-921 (1988); See also, Ishida et al, Nature Biotechnology 14:745-150 (June 1996) for maize transformation), direct gene transfer (Paszkowski et al, EMBO J. 3.2717-2722 (1984); Hayashimoto et al. Plant Physiol, 9i;857-863 (1990)(rice)), and ballistic particle acceleration using devices available from Agracetus, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin and Dupont, Inc., Wilmington, Delaware (see, for example, Sanford et al., U.S. Patent 4,945,050; and McCabe et al., Biotechnology 6.-923-926 (1988)).

A particularly preferred set of embodiments for the introduction of recombinant DNA molecules into maize by microprojectile bombardment can be found in Koziel et al, Biotechnology 11: 194-200 (1993), Hill et al, Euphytica 55:119-123 (1995) and Koziel et al, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 792:164-\1\ (1996). An additional preferred embodiment is the protoplast transformation method for maize as disclosed in EP 0 292 435. Transformation of plants can be undertaken with a single DNA species or multiple DNA species (le. co-transformation) and both these techniques are suitable for use with a coding sequence of the invention.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, a nucleotide sequence of the present invention is directly transformed into the plastid genome. A major advantage of plastid transformation is that plastids are generally capable of expressing bacterial genes without substantial modification, and plastids are capable of expressing multiple open reading frames under control of a single promoter. Plastid transformation technology is extensively described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,451,513, 5,545,817, and 5,545,818, in PCX application no. WO 95/16783, and in McBride et al (1994) Proc. Natl Acad. ScL USA 91, 7301-7305. The basic technique for chloroplast transformation involves introducing regions of cloned plastid DNA flanking a selectable marker together with the gene of interest into a suitable target tissue, e.g., using biolistics   or   protoplast    transformation    (e.g.,    calcium   chloride    or   PEG    mediated<br><br>
transformation).    The  1 to  1.5 kb flanking regions, termed targeting sequences, facilitate homologous recombination with the plastid genome and thus allow  the replacement or modification of specific regions of the plastome.   Initially, point mutations in the chloroplart 16S rRNA and rpsl2 genes conferring resistance to spectinomycin and/or streptomycin are utilized as selectable markers for transformation (Svab, Z., Hajdukiewicz, P., and Maliga, P. (1990) Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 8526-8530; Staub, J. M., and Maliga, P. (1992) Plant Cell 4,  39-45).     This resulted  in  stable homoplasmic  transformants  at  a frequency of approximately one per 100 bombardments of target leaves.   The presence of cloning sites between these markers allowed creation of a plastid targeting vector for introduction of foreign genes (Staub, J.M., and Maliga, P. (1993) EMBO J, 12, 601-606). Substantial increases in transformation frequency are obtained by   replacement of the recessive rRNA or r-protein antibiotic  resistance  genes  with a dominant  selectable  marker,  the  bacterial  aadA  gene encoding the spectinomycin-detoxifying enzyme aminoglycoside-3'-adenyltransferase (Svab, Z., and Maliga, P. (1993) Proc. Natl Acad, Sci. USA 90, 913-917). Previously, this marker had been used successfully for high-frequency transformation of the plastid genome of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Goldschmidt-Clermont, M. (1991) Nucl. Acids Res. 19: 4083-4089).   Other selectable markers useful for plastid transformation are known in the art and encompassed within the scope of the invention.   Typically, approximately 15-20 cell division cycles following transformation are required to reach a homoplastidic state. Plastid expression, in which genes are inserted by homologous recombination into all of the several thousand copies of the circular plastid genome present in each plant cell, takes advantage of the enormous copy number advantage over nuclear-expressed genes to permit expression levels  that can  readily exceed   10%  of the total soluble plant  protein.  In  a preferred embodiment, a nucleotide sequence of the present invention is inserted into a plastid targeting vector and transformed into the plastid genome of a desired plant host. Plants homoplastic for plastid genomes containing a nucleotide sequence of the present invention are obtained, and are preferentially capable of high expression of the nucleotide sequence.<br>

The invention will be further described by reference to the following detailed examples. These examples are provided for purposes of illustration only, and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified.

Example 1: Expression and Purification of an H04 Toxin Fragment<br>
A truncated form of the H04 hybrid toxin gene (described in De Maagd et ai, Appl Environ. Microbiol 62(5): 1537-1543 (1996), which encodes a Bt toxin consisting essentially of domains I and n of CrylAb and domain EI of CrylC, is cloned into an expression vector such as pBluescript SK-, Bacillus shuttle vector, or pET 21b(+) for overexpression in E. coli. Cells are grown in LB media containing 50 micrograms/ml ampicillin for 24 to 48 h at 37°C shaker (250 rpm). Cells are harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 7,000 rpm. The pellet is sonicated with a Bronson sonifier for 2 min 30 sec with 2 sec pulse. Complete sonication is checked under microscope. Soluble fractions are removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting pellet containing crystal proteins is washed 4-5 times with 2% Triton X-100 containing 0.5 M NaCl. Continuous washing is done with 0.5 M NaCl (4-5 times) and the final pellet is washed with distilled water (2 times). The resulting pellet is solubilized in 50 mM Na2CO3 buffer containing 10 mM dithiothreitol at 37°C for 2 h. Solubilized protein is separated from insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein samples are dialyzed with 50 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.0 buffer for bioassays.<br>
Example 2: Bioassays<br><br>
LC50's are performed on fall armyworm, pink bollworm, tobacco budworm, and European comborer using purified truncated H04 protein that is produced, for example, as described above in Example 1.  Results are as follows:<br>
LC50 fall armyworm     133 ng/cm2<br>
LC50 pink bollworm    691 ng/cm2<br>
LC50 tobacco budworm        299 ng/cm2<br>
LC50 European comborer     31 ng/cm2<br>
Example 3: Synthetic H04 Gene Construction<br>
A synthetic nucleotide sequence encoding the toxin portion of H04 is designed by backtranslating the amino acid sequence of the H04 hybrid toxin fragment described in De Maagd et al, Appl Environ. Microbiol 62(5): 1537-1543 (1996) (domains I and 11 of CrylAb and domain III of CrylC) using the "Backtranslation" program found in the University of Wisconsin GCG group of programs using a maize preference codon table (Murray et ai, Nucl Acids Res. 17:477-498, 1989, incorporated herein by reference). Preferably, the most frequently used maize codon is used for each amino acid, as described in WO 93/07278,<br>
The synthetic nucleotide sequence encoding the toxin portion of H04 may be constructed in several fragments. Each fragment is constructed by hybridization of ten pairs of oligomers 60-75 nucleotides in length representing both strands of the gene. An approximately 15 nucleotide overlap is designed between sequential oligonucleotide pairs for correct orientation and assembly. Oligonucleotides may be synthesized by, for example, Genosys Biotechnologies Inc., TX. Each pair of oligomers is hybridized and phosphorylated using the enzyme polynucleotide kinase from, e.g.. New England Biolabs, Inc., MA using conditions specified by the vendor. Kinased fragment pairs are then hybridized and ligated into a high copy plasmid vector containing, e.g., an ampicillin resistance gene and transformed into, e.g., competent DH5a cells. The cells are plated onto ampicillin containing media and incubated overnight at 37 C. Colonies are screened for inserted DNA. The DNA is sequenced and clones containing the correct sequence are selected. The fragments are then joined by restriction digestion, ligation and transformation using unique restriction sites between the fragments.<br><br>
SEQ ID NO:3 shows the synthetic nucleotide sequence encoding the 631-amino acid toxin portion of H04 (without a protoxin tail region), and SEQ ID NO:4 shows the amino acid sequence of the H04 toxin encoded by the synthetic nucleotide sequence depicted in SEQ ID NO:3. SEQ ID NO: 11 shows the nucleotide sequence of construct pNOV1308, which contains the constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter operatively linked to the synthetic H04 gene sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:3.<br>
In addition to the above-described synthetic gene (SEQ ID N0:3) that encodes only the toxin portion of the H04 hybrid (domains I and 11 of CrylAb and domain III of CrylC), additional synthetic H04 genes are constructed with all or a portion of the synthetic crylAb tail region described in U.S. Patent No. 5,625,136 (herein incorporated by reference) fused to the 3' end of the H04 toxin portion. These synthetic H04 gene sequences with crylAb tails are described below:<br>
SEQ ID NO:5 shows a synthetic nucleotide sequence encoding the toxin portion of H04 plus a full-length CrylAb tail portion, and SEQ ID N0:6 shows the amino acid sequence of the H04 + CrylAb tail encoded by the synthetic nucleotide sequence depicted in SEQ ID N0:5. SEQ ED NO: 12 shows the nucleotide sequence of construct pNOV1436, which contains the root-preferred maize MTL promoter operatively linked to the synthetic H04 gene sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:5. SEQ ID NO:13 shows the nucleotide sequence of construct pNOV1441, which contains the constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter operatively linked to the synthetic H04 gene sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:5.<br>
SEQ ID NO:7 shows another synthetic nucleotide sequence encoding the toxin portion of H04 plus a full-length CrylAb tail portion, and SEQ ID N0:8 shows the amino acid sequence of the H04 + CrylAb tail encoded by the synthetic nucleotide sequence depicted in SEQ ID N0:7. SEQ ID NO: 14 shows the nucleotide sequence of construct pNOV1305, which contains the constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter operatively linked to the synthetic H04 gene sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:7. SEQ ID NO: 15 shows the nucleotide sequence of construct pNOV1313, which contains the constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter operatively linked to the synthetic H04 gene sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:7.<br>
SEQ ID NO:9 shows a synthetic nucleotide sequence encoding the toxin portion of H04 plus only the first 40 amino acids of the CrylAb tail, and SEQ ID NO: 10 shows the amino acid sequence of the H04 + 40-amino acid truncated CrylAb tail encoded by the synthetic nucleotide<br><br>
sequence depicted in SEQ ID N0:9. SEQ ID NO: 16 shows the nucleotide sequence of construct pNOV1435, which contains the root-preferred maize MTL promoter operatively linked to the synthetic H04 gene sequence set forth in SEQ ED NO:9. SEQ ID NO: 17 shows the nucleotide sequence of construct pZU578, which contains the Arabidopsis actin-2 promoter operatively linked to the synthetic H04 gene sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:9.<br>
Example 4: Modification of Coding Sequences and Adjacent Sequences<br>
The nucleotide sequences described in this application can be modified for expression in transgenic plant hosts. A host plant expressing the nucleotide sequences and which produces the insecticidal toxins in its cells has enhanced resistance to insect attack and is thus better equipped to withstand crop losses associated with such attack.<br>
The transgenic expression in plants of genes derived from microbial sources may require the modification of those genes to achieve and optimize their expression in plants. In particular, bacterial ORFs that encode separate enzymes but that are encoded by the same transcript in the native microbe are best expressed in plants on separate transcripts. To achieve this, each microbial ORE is isolated individually and cloned within a cassette which provides a plant promoter sequence at the 5' end of the ORE and a plant transcriptional terminator at the 3' end of the ORE. The isolated ORE sequence preferably includes the initiating ATG codon and the terminating STOP codon but may include additional sequence beyond the initiating ATG and the STOP codon. In addition, the ORE may be truncated, but still retain the required activity; for particularly long ORFs, truncated versions which retain activity may be preferable for expression in transgenic organisms. By "plant promoter" and "plant transcriptional terminator" it is intended to mean promoters and transcriptional terminators which operate within plant cells. This includes promoters and transcription terminators which may be derived from non-plant sources such as viruses (an example is the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus).<br>
In some cases, modification to the ORE coding sequences and adjacent sequence is not required. It is sufficient to isolate a fragment containing the ORE of interest and to insert it downstream of a plant promoter. Eor example, Gaffney et al (Science 261: 754-756 (1993)) have expressed the Pseudomonas nahG gene in transgenic plants under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and the CaMV tml terminator successfully without modification of the<br><br>
coding sequence and with x bp of the Pseudomonas gene upstream of the ATG still attached, and y bp downstream of the STOP codon still attached to the nahG ORF. Preferably as little adjacent microbial sequence should be left attached upstream of the ATG and downstream of the STOP codon. In practice, such construction may depend on the availability of restriction sites.<br>
In other cases, the expression of genes derived from microbial sources may provide problems in expression. These problems have been weU characterized in the art and are particularly common with genes derived from certain sources such as Bacillus, These problems may apply to the nucleotide sequence of this invention and the modification of these genes can be undertaken using techniques now well known in the art. The following problems may be encountered:<br>
1. Codon Usage.<br>
The preferred codon usage in plants differs from the preferred codon usage in certain microorganisms. Comparison of the usage of codons within a cloned microbial ORF to usage in plant genes (and in particular genes from the target plant) will enable an identification of the codons within the ORF which should preferably be changed. Typically plant evolution has tended towards a strong preference of the nucleotides C and G in the third base position of monocotyledons, whereas dicotyledons often use the nucleotides A or T at this position. By modifying a gene to incorporate preferred codon usage for a particular target transgenic species, many of the problems described below for GC/AT content and illegitimate splicing will be overcome.<br>
2. GC/AT Content.<br>
Plant genes typically have a GC content of more than 35%. ORF sequences which are rich in A and T nucleotides can cause several problems in plants. Firstly, motifs of ATTTA are believed to cause destabilization of messages and are found at the 3' end of many short-lived mRNAs. Secondly, the occurrence of polyadenylation signals such as AATAAA at inappropriate positions within the message is believed to cause premature truncation of transcription. In addition, monocotyledons may recognize AT-rich sequences as splice sites (see below).<br><br>
3. Sequences Adjacent to the Initiating Methionine.<br>
Plants differ from microorganisms in that their messages do not possess a defined ribosome binding site. Rather, it is believed that ribosomes attach to the 5' end of the message and scan for the first available ATG at which to start translation. Nevertheless, it is beli-^ved that there is a preference for certain nucleotides adjacent to the ATG and that expression of microbial genes can be enhanced by the inclusion of a eukaryotic consensus translation initiator at the ATG. Clontech (1993/1994 catalog, page 210, incorporated herein by reference) have suggested one sequence as a consensus translation initiator for the expression of the E. coli liidA gene in plants. Further, Joshi (NAR 15: 6643-6653 (1987), incorporated herein by reference) has compared many plant sequences adjacent to the ATG and suggests another consensus sequence. In situations where difficulties are encountered in the expression of microbial ORFs in plants, inclusion of one of these sequences at the initiating ATG may improve translation. In such cases the last three nucleotides of the consensus may not be appropriate for inclusion in the modified sequence due to their modification of the second AA residue. Preferred sequences adjacent to the initiating methionine may differ between different plant species. A survey of 14 maize genes located in the GenBank database provided the following results:<br><br>
This analysis can be done for the desired plant species into which the nucleotide sequence is being incorporated, and the sequence adjacent to the ATG modified to incorporate the preferred nucleotides.<br>
4. Removal of Illegitimate Splice Sites.<br><br>
Genes cloned from non-plant sources and not optimized for expression in plants may also contain motifs which may be recognized in plants as 5' or 3' splice sites, and be cleaved, thus generating truncated or deleted messages. These sites can be removed using the techniques well known in the art.<br>
Techniques for the modification of coding sequences and adjacent sequences are well known in the art. In cases where the initial expression of a microbial ORP is low and it is deemed appropriate to make alterations to the sequence as described above, then the construction of synthetic genes can be accomplished according to methods well known in the art. These are, for example, described in the published patent disclosures EP 0 385 962, EP 0 359 472 and WO 93/07278, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. In most cases it is preferable to assay the expression of gene constructions using transient assay protocols (which are well known in the art) prior to their transfer to transgenic plants.<br>
Example 5: Construction of Plant Expression Cassettes<br>
Coding sequences intended for expression in transgenic plants are first assembled in expression cassettes behind a suitable promoter expressible in plants. The expression cassettes may also comprise any further sequences required or selected for the expression of the transgene. Such sequences include, but are not restricted to, transcription terminators, extraneous sequences to enhance expression such as introns, vital sequences, and sequences intended for the targeting of the gene product to specific organelles and cell compartments. These expression cassettes can then be easily transferred to the plant transformation vectors described below. The following is a description of various components of typical expression cassettes.<br>
1. Promoters<br>
The selection of the promoter used in expression cassettes will determine the spatial and temporal expression pattern of the transgene in the transgenic plant. Selected promoters will express transgenes in specific ceil types (such as leaf epidermal cells, mesophyll cells, root cortex cells) or in specific tissues or organs (roots, leaves or flowers, for example) and the selection will reflect the desired location of accumulation of the gene product.  Alternatively,<br><br>
the selected promoter may drive expression of the gene under various inducing conditions. Promoters vary in their strength, i.e., ability to promote transcription. Depending upon the host cell system utilized, any one of a number of suitable promoters can be used, including the gene's native promoter. The following are non-limiting examples of promoters that may be used in expression cassettes.<br>
a.	Constitutive Expression, the Ubiquitin Promoter:<br>
Ubiquitin is a gene product known to accumulate in many cell types and its promoter has been cloned from several species for use in transgenic plants (e,g. sunflower - Binet et al Plant Science 79: 87-94 (1991); maize - Christensen et al Plant Molec. Biol. 12: 619-632 (1989); and Arabidopsis - Norris et al. Plant Mol Biol 21:895-906 (1993)). The maize ubiquitin promoter has been developed in transgenic monocot systems and its sequence and vectors constructed for monocot transformation are disclosed in the patent publication EP 0 342 926 which is herein incorporated by reference. Taylor et al (Plant Cell Rep. 12: 491-495 (1993)) describe a vector (pAHC25) that comprises the maize ubiquitin promoter and first intron and its high activity in cell suspensions of numerous monocotyledons when introduced via microprojectile bombardment. The Arabidopsis ubiquitin promoter is ideal for use with the nucleotide sequences of the present invention. The ubiquitin promoter is suitable for gene expression in transgenic plants, both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Suitable vectors are derivatives of pAHC25 or any of the transformation vectors described in this application, modified by the introduction of the appropriate ubiquitin promoter and/or intron sequences.<br>
b.	Constitutive Expression, the CaMV 35S Promoter:<br>
Construction of the plasmid pCGN1761 is described in the published patent application EP 0 392 225 (Example 23), which is hereby incorporated by reference. pCGN1761 contains the "double" CaMV 35S promoter and the tml transcriptional terminator with a unique EcoRI site between the promoter and the terminator and has a pUC-type backbone. A derivative of pCGN1761 is constructed which has a modified polylinker which includes NotI and Xhol sites in addition to the existing EcoRI site. This derivative is designated pCGN1761ENX. pCGN1761ENX is useful for the cloning of cDNA sequences or coding sequences (including microbial ORE sequences) within its polylinker for the purpose of their expression under the<br><br>
control of the 35S promoter in transgenic plants. The entire 35S promoter-coding sequence-tml terminator cassette of such a construction can be excised by Hindlll, SphI, Sail, and Xbal sites 5' to the promoter and Xbal, BamHI and Bgll sites 3' to the terminator for transfer to transformation vectors such as those described below. Furthermore, the double 35S promoter fragment can be removed by 5' excision with Hindlll, SphI, Sail, Xbal, or Pstl, and 3' excision with any of the polylinker restriction sites (EcoRI, NotI or XhoT) for replacement with another promoter. If desired, modifications around the cloning sites can be made by the introduction of sequences that may enhance translation. This is particularly useful when overexpression is desired. For example, pCGN1761ENX may be modified by optimization of the translational initiation site as described in Example 37 of U.S. Patent No. 5,639,949, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
c. Constitutive Expression, the Actin Promoter:<br>
Several isoforms of actin are known to be expressed in most cell types and consequently the actin promoter is a good choice for a constitutive promoter. In particular, the promoter from the rice Actl gene has been cloned and characterized (McEIroy et al. Plant Cell 2: 163-171 (1990)). A 1.3kb fragment of the promoter was found to contain all the regulatory elements required for expression in rice protoplasts. Furthermore, numerous expression vectors based on the Actl promoter have been constructed specifically for use in monocotyledons (McElroy et al Mol. Gen. Genet. 231: 150-160 (1991)). These incorporate the i4c//-intron 1, AdhI 5' flanking sequence and Adhl-miron 1 (from the maize alcohol dehydrogenase gene) and sequence from the CaMV 35S promoter. Vectors showing highest expression were fusions of 35S and Actl intron or the Actl 5' flanking sequence and the Actl intron. Optimization of sequences around the initiating ATG (of the GUS reporter gene) also enhanced expression. The promoter expression cassettes described by McElroy et al (Mol. Gen. Genet. 231: 150-160 (1991)) can be easily modified for gene expression and are particularly suitable for use in monocotyledonous hosts. For example, promoter-containing fragments is removed from the McElroy constructions and used to replace the double 35S promoter in pCGN1761ENX, which is then available for the insertion of specific gene sequences. The fusion genes thus constructed can then be transferred to appropriate transformation vectors.   In a separate report, the rice Actl promoter with its first intron has<br><br>
also been found to direct high expression in cultured barley cells (Chibbar et al Plant Cell Rep. 12:506-509(1993)).<br>
d.  Inducible Expression, the PR-1 Promoter:<br>
The double 35S promoter in pCGN1761ENX may be replaced with any other promoter of choice that will result in suitably high expression levels. By way of example, one of the chemically regulatable promoters described in U.S. Patent No. 5,614,395, such as the tobacco PR-la promoter, may replace the double 35S promoter.    Alternately, the Arabidopsis PR-1 promoter described in Lebel et al, Plant J. 16:223-233 (1998) may be used. The promoter of choice is preferably excised from its source by restriction enzymes, but can alternatively be PCR-amplified using primers that carry appropriate terminal restriction sites.   Should PCR-amplification  be  undertaken,   then  the  promoter  should  be  re-sequenced to  check for amplification errors after the cloning of the amplified promoter in the target vector.   The chemically/pathogen regulatable tobacco PR-la promoter is cleaved from plasmid pCIB1004 (for construction, see example 21 of HP 0 332 104, which is hereby incorporated by reference) and transferred to plasmid pCGN1761ENX (Uknes et ai. Plant Cell 4: 645-656 (1992)). pCIB1004 is cleaved with Ncol and the resultant 3' overhang of the linearized fragment is rendered blunt by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase.   The fragment is then cleaved with Hindlll and the resultant PR-la promoter-containing fragment is gel purified and cloned into pCGN1761ENX from which the double 35S promoter has been removed.   This is done by cleavage with Xhol and blunting with T4 polymerase, followed by cleavage with Hindlll and isolation  of the  larger vector-terminator containing  fragment  into  which the pCIB1004 promoter fragment is cloned.   This generates a pCGN1761ENX derivative with the PR-la promoter and the tml terminator and an intervening polylinker with unique EcoRI and NotI sites.  The selected coding sequence can be inserted into this vector, and the fusion products {i.e. promoter-gene-terminator) can subsequently be transferred to any selected transformation vector, including those described infra. Various chemical regulators may be employed to induce expression of the selected coding sequence in the plants transformed according to the present   invention,   including   the   benzothiadiazole,   isonicotinic   acid,   and   salicylic   acid compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,523,311 and 5,614,395.<br><br>
e.	Inducible Expression, an Ethanol-Inducible Promoter:<br>
A promoter inducible by certain alcohols or ketones, such as ethanol, may also be used to confer inducible expression of a coding sequence of the present invention. Such a promoter is for example the alcA gene promoter from Aspergillus nidulans (Caddick et al. (1998) Nat. Biotechnol 16:177-180). In A. nidulans, the alcA gene encodes alcohol dehydrogenase J, the expression of which is regulated by the AlcR transcription factors in presence of the chemical inducer. For the purposes of the present invention, the CAT coding sequences in plasmid palcA:CAT comprising a alcA gene promoter sequence fused to a minimal 35S promoter (Caddick et al. (1998) Nat. Biotechnol 16:177-180) are replaced by a coding sequence of the present invention to form an expression cassette having the coding sequence under the control of the alcA gene promoter. This is carried out using methods well known in the art.<br>
f.	Inducible Expression, a Glucocorticoid-Inducible Promoter:<br>
Induction of expression of a nucleic acid sequence of the present invention using systems based on steroid hormones is also contemplated. For example, a glucocorticoid-mediated induction system is used (Aoyama and Chua (1997) The Plant Journal 11: 605-612) and gene expression is induced by application of a glucocorticoid, for example a synthetic glucocorticoid, preferably dexamethasone, preferably at a concentration ranging from 0.1 mM to ImM, more preferably from lOmM to lOOmM. For the purposes of the present invention, the luciferase gene sequences are replaced by a nucleic acid sequence of the invention to form an expression cassette having a nucleic acid sequence of the invention under the control of six copies of the GAM upstream activating sequences fused to the 35S minimal promoter. This is carried out using methods well known in the art. The trans-acting factor comprises the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Keegan et al. (1986) Science 231: 699-704) fused to the transactivating domain of the herpes viral protein VP16 (Triezenberg et al. (1988) Genes Devel. 2: 718-729) fused to the hormone-binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (Picard et al. (1988) Cell 54: 1073-1080). The expression of the fusion protein is controlled by any promoter suitable for expression in plants known in the art or described here. This expression cassette is also comprised in the plant comprising a nucleic acid sequence of the invention fused to the 6xGAL4/minimal promoter. Thus, tissue- or organ-specificity of the fusion protein is achieved leading to inducible tissue- or organ-specificity of the insecticidal toxin.<br><br>
g.  Root Specific Expression:<br>
Another pattern of gene expression is root expression. A suitable root promoter is the promoter of the maize metallothioncin-like (MTL) gene described by de Framond (FEBS 290: 103-106 (1991)) and also in U.S. Patent No. 5,466,785, incorporated herein by refen-^nce. This "MTL" promoter is transferred to a suitable vector such as pCGN176IENX for the insertion of a selected gene and subsequent transfer of the entire promoter-gene-terminator cassette to a transformation vector of interest,<br>
h.  Wound-Inducible Promoters:<br>
Wound-inducible promoters may also be suitable for gene expression. Numerous such promoters have been described {e.g. Xu et al. Plant Molcc. Biol. 22: 573-588 (1993), Logemann et al. Plant Cell i: 151-158(1989), Rohrmeier &amp; Lehle, Plant Molec. Biol. 22: 783-792 (1993), Firek et al. Plant Molec. Biol. 22: 129-142 (1993), Warner et al. Plant J. 3: 191-201 (1993)) and all are suitable for use with the instant invention. Logemann et aL describe the 5' upstream sequences of the dicotyledonous potato wunt gene. Xu et al. show that a wound-inducible promoter from the dicotyledon potato (pin2) is active in the monocotyledon rice. Further, Rohrmeier &amp; Lehle describe the cloning of the maize Wipl cDNA which is wound induced and which can be used to isolate the cognate promoter using standard techniques. Similar, Firek et al. and Warner et al. have described a wound-induced gene from the monocotyledon Asparagus officinalis, which is expressed at local wound and pathogen invasion sites. Using cloning techniques well known in the art, these promoters can be transferred to suitable vectors, fused to the genes pertaining to this invention, and used to express these genes at the sites of plant wounding,<br>
i.  Pith-Preferred Expression:<br>
Patent Application WO 93/07278, which is herein incorporated by reference, describes the isolation of the maize trpA gene, which is preferentially expressed in pith cells. The gene sequence and promoter extending up to -1726 bp from the start of transcription are presented. Using standard molecular biological techniques, this promoter, or parts thereof, can be transferred to a vector such as pCGN1761 where it can replace the 35S promoter and be used<br><br>
to drive the expression of a foreign gene in a pith-preferred manner. In fact, fragments containing the pith-preferred promoter or parts thereof can be transferred to any vector and moditled for utility in transgenic plants.<br>
j.  Leaf-vSpecillc Expression:<br>
A maize gene encoding phosphoenol carboxylase (PEPC) has been described by Hudspeth &amp; Grula (Plant Molec Biol 12: 579-589 (1989)). Using standard molecular biological techniques the promoter for this gene can be used to drive the expression of any gene in a leaf-specific manner in transgenic plants.<br>
k.  Pollen-Specific Expression:<br>
WO 93/07278 describes the isolation of the maize calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) gene which is expressed in pollen cells. The gene sequence and promoter extend up to 1400 bp from the start of transcription. Using standard molecular biological techniques, this promoter or parts thereof, can be transferred to a vector such as pCGN1761 where it can replace the 35S promoter and be used to drive the expression of a nucleic acid sequence of the invention in a pollen-specific manner.<br>
1.  Receptor Mediated Transactivation In The Presence Of A Chemical Ligand: U.S.  Patent No. 5,880,333, incorporated herein by reference, describes a system whereby class II hormone receptors such as Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP),   which   function  together  as  a  heterodimer,  regulate  the  expression  of a  target polypeptide in a plant cell in the presence of an appropriate chemical ligand, e.g. tebufenozide.<br>
2. Transcriptional Terminators<br>
A variety of transcriptional terminators are available for use in expression cassettes. These are responsible for the termination of transcription beyond the transgene and its correct polyadenylation. Appropriate transcriptional terminators are those that are known to function in plants and include the CaMV 35S terminator, the tml terminator, the nopaline synthase terminator and the pea rbcS E9 terminator. These can be used in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. In addition, a gene's native transcription terminator may be used.<br><br>
3.  Sequences for the Enhancement or Regulation of Expression Numerous sequences have been found to enhance gene expression from within the transcriptional unit and these sequences can be used in conjunction with the genes of this invention to increase their expression in transgenic plants.<br>
Various intron sequences have been shown to enhance expression, particularly in monocotyledonous cells. For example, the introns of the maize AdhI gene have been found to significantly enhance the expression of the wild-type gene under its cognate promoter when introduced into maize cells. Intron 1 was found to be particularly effective and enhanced expression in fusion constructs with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (Callis et al. Genes Develop. 1; 1 183-1200 (1987)). In the same experimental system, the intron from the maize bronze I gene had a similar effect in enhancing expression, Intron sequences have been routinely incorporated into plant transformation vectors, typically within the non-translated leader.<br>
A number of non-translated leader sequences derived from viruses are also known to enhance expression, and these are particularly effective in dicotyledonous cells. Specifically, leader sequences from Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV, the "W-sequence"), Maize Chlorotic Mottle Virus (MCMV), and Alfalfa Mosaic Virus (AMV) have been shown to be effective in enhancing expression (e.g. Gallic et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 15; 8693-8711 (1987); Skuzeski et al. Plant Molec. Biol. 15: 65-79 (1990)).<br>
4. Targeting of the Gene Product Within the Cell<br>
Various mechanisms for targeting gene products are known to exist in plants and the sequences controlling the functioning of these mechanisms have been characterized in some detail. For example, the targeting of gene products to the chloroplast is controlled by a signal sequence found at the amino terminal end of various proteins which is cleaved during chloroplast import to yield the mature protein (e.g. Comai et al. J. Biol. Chem. 263: 15104-15109 (1988)). These signal sequences can be fused to heterologous gene products to effect the import of heterologous products into the chloroplast (van den Broeck, et al. Nature 313: 358-363 (1985)). DNA encoding for appropriate signal sequences can be isolated from the 5' end of the cDNAs encoding the RUBISCO protein, the CAB protein, the EPSP synthase<br><br>
enzyme, the GS2 protein and many other proteins which are known to be chloroplast localized. See also, the section entitled "Expression With Chloroplast Targeting" in Example 37 of U.S. Patent No. 5,639,949.<br>
Other gene products are localized to other organelles such as the mitochondrion and the peroxisome {e.g. Unger et ciL Plant Molec. Biol. JJ: 41 1-418 (1989)). The cDNAs encoding these products can also be manipulated to effect the targeting of heterologous gene products to these organelles. Examples of such sequences are the nuclear-encoded ATPases and sperific aspartate amino transferase isoforms for mitochondria. Targeting cellular protein bodies has been described by Rogers et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 6512-6516(1985)).<br>
In addition, sequences have been characterized which cause the targeting of gene products to other cell compartments. Amino terminal sequences arc responsible for targeting to the ER, the apoplast, and extracellular secretion from aleurone cells (Koehler &amp; Ho, Plant Cell 2: 769-783 (1990)). Additionally, amino terminal sequences in conjunction with carboxy terminal sequences are responsible for vacuolar targeting of gene products (Shinshi et al Plant Molec. Biol. 14: 357-368 (1990)).<br>
By the fusion of the appropriate targeting sequences described above to transgene sequences of interest it is possible to direct the transgene product to any organelle or cell compartment. For chloroplast targeting, for example, the chloroplast signal sequence from the RUBISCO gene, the CAB gene, the EPSP synthase gene, or the GS2 gene is fused in frame to the amino terminal ATG of the transgene. The signal sequence selected should include the known cleavage site, and the fusion constructed should take into account any amino acids after the cleavage site which are required for cleavage. In some cases this requirement may be fulfilled by the addition of a small number of amino acids between the cleavage site and the transgene ATG or, alternatively, replacement of some amino acids within the transgene sequence. Fusions constructed for chloroplast import can be tested for efficacy of chloroplast uptake by in vitro translation of in vitro transcribed constructions followed by in vitro chloroplast uptake using techniques described by Bartlett et al In: Edelmann et al (Eds.) Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology, Elsevier pp 1081-1091 (1982) and Wasmann et al Mol. Gen. Genet. 205: 446-453 (1986). These construction techniques are well known in the art and are equally applicable to mitochondria and peroxisomes.<br><br>
The above-described mechanisms for cellular targeting can be utilized not only in conjunction with their cognate promoters, but also in conjunction with heterologous promoters so as to effect a specific cell-targeting goal under the transcriptional regulation of a promoter that has an expression pattern different to that of the promoter from which the targeting signal derives.<br>
Example 6: Construction of Plant Transformation Vectors<br>
Numerous transformation vectors available for plant transformation are known to those of ordinary skill in the plant transformation arts, and the genes pertinent to this invention can be used in conjunction with any such vectors. The selection of vector will depend upon the preferred transformation technique and the target species for transformation. For certain target species, different antibiotic or herbicide selection markers may be preferred. Selection markers used routinely in transformation include the nptll gene, which confers resistance to kanamycin and related antibiotics (Messing &amp; Vierra. Gene 19: 259-268 (1982); Bevan et al.. Nature 304:184-187 (1983)), the bar gene, which confers resistance to the herbicide phosphinothricin (White et al., Nucl. Acids Res 18: 1062 (1990), Spencer et al. Theor. Appl. Genet 79: 625-631 (1990)), the hph gene, which confers resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin (Blochinger &amp; Diggelmann, Mol Cell Biol 4: 2929-2931), and the dhfr gene, which confers resistance to methatrexate (Bourouis et al., EMBO J. 2£Z}: 1099-1104 (1983)), the EPSPS gene, which confers resistance to glyphosate (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,940,935 and 5,188,642), and the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase gene, which provides the ability to metabolize mannose (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,767,378 and 5,994,629).<br>
1. Vectors Suitable for Agrobacteriiim Transformation<br>
Many vectors are available for transformation using Agrobacteriiim tumefaciens. These typically carry at least one T-DNA border sequence and include vectors such as pBIN19 (Bevan, Nucl. Acids Res. (1984)) and pXYZ. Below, the construction of two typical vectors suitable iox Agrobacteriiim transformation is described.<br>
a. pCro200 and pCIB2001:<br><br><br>
2.  Vectors Suitable for non-Agrobacierium Transformation<br><br>
Transformation without the use of Agwhacteriiim tumefaciens circumvents the requirement for T-DNA sequences in the chosen transformation vector and consequently vectors lacking these sequences can be utilized in addition to vectors such as the ones described above which contain T-DNA sequences. Transformation techniques that do not rely on Agarohacterium include transformation via particle bombardment, protoplast uptake {e.g. PEG and clectroporation) and microinjection. The choice of vector depends largely on the preferred selection for the species being transformed. Below, the construction of typical vectors suitable for non-Agrobaclerium transformation is described.<br>
a. pCIB3064:<br>
pCIB3064 is a pUC-derived vector suitable for direct gene transfer techniques in combination with selection by the herbicide basta (or phosphinothricin). The plasmid pCIB246 comprises the CaMV 35S promoter in operational fusion to the E. coli GUS gene and the CaMV 35S transcriptional terminator and is described in the PCT published application WO 93/07278. The 35S promoter of this vector contains two ATG sequences 5' of the start site. These sites are mutated using standard PCR techniques in such a way as to remove the ATGs and generate the restriction sites Sspl and PviiII. The new restriction sites are 96 and 37 bp away from the unique Sail site and 101 and 42 bp away from the actual start site. The resultant derivative of pCIB246 is designated pCIB3025. The GUS gene is then excised from pCIB3025 by digestion with Sail and Sad, the termini rendered blunt and religated to generate plasmid pCIB3060. The plasmid pJIT82 is obtained from the John Innes Centre, Norwich and the a 400 bp Smal fragment containing the bar gene from Streptomyces viridochromogenes is excised and inserted into the Hpal site of pCIB3060 (Thompson et al. EMBO J 6: 2519-2523 (1987)). This generated pCIB3064, which comprises the bar gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and terminator for herbicide selection, a gene for ampicillin resistance (for selection in E. coli) and a polylinker with the unique sites Sphi PslL Hindlll, and BamHL This vector is suitable for the cloning of plant expression cassettes containing their own regulatory signals.<br>
b. pSOG19 and pSOG35:<br><br>
pSOG35 is a transformation vector that utilizes the E. coli gene dihydrofolate reductase (DFR) as a selectable marker conferring resistance to methotrexate. PCR is used to amplify the 35S promoter (-800 bp), intron 6 from the maize Adhl gene (-550 bp) and 18 bp of the GIJS untranslated leader sequence from pSOGlO. A 250-bp fragment encoding the E. coli dihydrofolate reductase type II gene is also amplified by PCR and these two PCR fragments arc assembled with a SacI-PslI fragment From pB1221 (CJontech) which comprises the pUC19 vector backbone and the nopaline synthase terminator. Assembly of these fragments generates pS0G19 which contains the 35S promoter in fusion with the intron 6 sequence, the GUS leader, the DHFR gene and the nopaline synthase terminator. Replacement of the GUS leader in pS0G19 with the leader sequence from Maize Chlorotic Mottle Virus (MCMV) generates the vector pSOG35. pSOG19 and pSOG35 carry the pUC gene for ampicillin resistance and have Hindlll, Sphl, PstI and EcoRI sites available for the cloning of foreign substances.<br>
3.  Vector Suitable for Chloroplast Transformation<br>
For expression of a nucleotide sequence of the present invention in plant plastids, plastid transformation vector pPH143 (WO 97/32011, example 36) is used. The nucleotide sequence is inserted into pPH143 thereby replacing the PROTOX coding sequence. This vector is then used for plastid transformation and selection of transformants for spectinomycin resistance. -Alternatively, the nucleotide sequence is inserted in pPH143 so that it replaces the aadH gene. In this case, transformants are selected for resistance to PROTOX inhibitors.<br>
Example 7: Transformation<br>
Once a nucleic acid sequence of the invention has been cloned into an expression system, it is transformed into a plant cell. Methods for transformation and regeneration of plants are vvell known in the art. For example, Ti plasmid vectors have been utilized for the delivery of foreign DNA, as well as direct DNA uptake, liposomes, electroporation, micro-injection, and microprojectiles. In addition, bacteria from the genus Agrohacterium can be utilized to transform plant cells.   Below are descriptions of representative techniques for transforming<br><br>
both   dicotyledonous  and   monocotyledonous  plants,   as  well  as  a  representative  plastid transformation technique.<br>
I. Transformation of Dicotyledons<br>
Transformation techniques for dicotyledons are well known in the art and include Agrobacterium-based techniques and techniques that do not require Agrobacteriiim. Non-Agrohacterium techniques involve the uptake of exogenous genetic material directly by protoplasts or cells. This can be accomplished by PEG or electroporation mediated uptake, particle bombardment-mediated delivery, or microinjection. Examples of these techniques are described by Paszkowski et ai, EMBO J 3: 21 \1-2122 (1984). Potrykus et ciL, MoL Gen. Genet. 199: 169-177 (1985), Reich et al, Biotechnology 4: 1001-1004 (1986), and Klein et al. Nature 3_27: 70-73 (1987). In each case the transformed cells are regenerated to whole plants using standard techniques known in the art.<br>
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a preferred technique for transformation of dicotyledons because of its high efficiency of transformation and its broad utility with many different species. Agrobacteriiim transformation typically involves the transfer of the binary vector carrying the foreign DNA of interest {e.g, pCIB200 or pCIB200l) to an appropriate Agrobacteriiim strain which may depend of the complement of vir genes carried by the host Agrobacteriiim strain either on a co-resident Ti plasmid or chromosomally {e.g. strain CIB542 for pCIB200 and pCIB200I (Uknes et ai Plant Cell 5: 159-169 (1993)). The transfer of the recombinant binary vector to Agrobacterium is accomplished by a triparental mating procedure using E. coli carrying the recombinant binary vector, a helper E. coli strain which carries a plasmid such as pRK2013 and which is able to mobilize the recombinant binary vector to the target Agrobacteriiim strain. Alternatively, the recombinant binary vector can be transferred to Agrobacteriiim by DNA transformation (Hofgen &amp; Willmitzer, Nucl. Acids Res. 16: 9877 (1988)).<br>
Transformation of the target plant species by recombinant Agrobacterium usually involves co-cultivation of the Agrobacterium with explants from the plant and foUows protocols well known in the art. Transformed tissue is regenerated on selectable medium carrying the antibiotic or herbicide resistance marker present between the binary plasmid T-DNA borders.<br><br>
Another approach to transforming plant cells with a gene involves propelling inert or biologically active particles at plant tissues and cells. This technique is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,945,050, 5,036,006, and 5,100,792. Generally, this procedure involves propelling inert or biologically active particles at the cells under conditions effective to penetrate the outer surface of the cell and afford incorporation within the interior thereof. When inert particles are utilized, the vector can be introduced into the cell by coating the particles with the vector containing the desired gene. AJternatively, the target cell can be surrounded by the vector so that the vector is carried into the cell by the wake of the particle. Biologically active particles (e.g., dried yeast cells, dried bacterium or a bacteriophage, each containing DNA sought to be introduced) can also be propelled into plant cell tissue.<br>
2. Transformation of Monocotyledons<br>
Transformation of most monocotyledon species has now also become routine. Preferred techniques include direct gene transfer into protoplasts using PEG or electroporation techniques, and particle bombardment into callus tissue. Transformations can be undertaken with a single DNA species or multiple DNA species (i.e. co-transformation) and both these techniques are suitable for use with this invention. Co-transformation may have the advantage of avoiding complete vector construction and of generating transgenic plants with unlinked loci for the gene of interest and the selectable marker, enabling the removal of the selectable marker in subsequent generations, should this be regarded desirable. However, a disadvantage of the use of co-transformation is the less than 100% frequency with which separate DNA species are integrated into the genome (Schocher et ai Biotechnology 4: 1093-1096 (1986)).<br>
Patent Applications EP 0 292 435, EP 0 392 225, and WO 93/07278 describe techniques for the preparation of callus and protoplasts from an elite inbred line of maize, transformation of protoplasts using PEG or electroporation, and the regeneration of maize plants from transformed protoplasts. Gordon-Kamm et ai (Plant Cell 2: 603-618 (1990)) and Fromm et ai (Biotechnology 8: 833-839 (1990)) have published techniques for transformation of A188-derived maize line using particle bombardment. Furthermore, WO 93/07278 and Koziel et ai (Biotechnology JJ.: 194-200 (1993)) describe techniques for the transformation of elite inbred lines of maize by particle bombardment.   This technique utilizes immature maize embryos of<br><br>
1.5-2.5 mm length excised from a maize car 14-15 days after pollination and a PDS-lOOOHe Biolistics device for bombardment.<br>
Transformation of rice can also be undertaken by direct gene transfer techniques utilizing protoplasts or particle bombardment. Protoplast-mediated transformation has been described for Japonica-iypcs and Indica-iypes (Zhang et ciL Plant Cell Rep 7: 379-384 (1988); Shimamoto et al. Nature 338: 274-277 (1989); Datta et al. Biotechnology 8: 736-740 (1990)). Both types are also routinely transformable using particle bombardment (Christou et al Biotechnology 9: 957-962 (1991)). Furthermore, WO 93/21335 describes techniques for the transformation of rice via electroporation.<br>
Patent Application EP 0 332 581 describes techniques for the generation, transformation and regeneration of Pooideae protoplasts. These techniques allow the transformation of Dactylis and wheat. Furthermore, wheat transformation has been described by Vasil et al (Biotechnology 10: 667-674 (1992)) using particle bombardment into cells of type C long-term regenerable callus, and also by Vasil et al (Biotechnology H: 1553-1558 (1993)) and Weeks et al (Plant Physiol. 102: 1077-1084 (1993)) using particle bombardment of immature embryos and immature embryo-derived callus. A preferred technique for wheat transformation, however, involves the transformation of wheat by particle bombardment of immature embryos and includes either a high sucrose or a high maltose step prior to gene delivery. Prior to bombardment, any number of embryos (0.75-1 mm in length) are plated onto MS medium with 3% sucrose (Murashiga &amp; Skoog, Physiologia Plantarum J_5: 473-497 (1962)) and 3 mg/1 2,4-D for induction of somatic embryos, which is allowed to proceed in the dark. On the chosen day of bombardment, embryos are removed from the induction medium and placed onto the osmoticum {i.e. induction medium with sucrose or maltose added at the desired concentration, typically 15%). The embryos are allowed to plasmolyze for 2-3 h and are then bombarded. Twenty embryos per target plate is typical, although not critical. An appropriate gene-carrying plasmid (such as pCIB3064 or pSG35) is precipitated onto micrometer size gold particles using standard procedures. Each plate of embryos is shot with the DuPont Biolistics® helium device using a burst pressure of --1000 psi using a standard 80 mesh screen. After bombardment, the embryos are placed back into the dark to recover for about 24 h (still on osmoticum). After 24 hrs, the embryos are removed from the osmoticum and  placed  back  onto   induction  medium  where  they  stay  for  about  a  month before<br><br>
regeneration. Approximately one month later the embryo explants with developing embryogenic callus are transferred to regeneration medium (MS + 1 mg/liter NAA, 5 mg/liter GA), further containing the appropriate selection agent (10 mg/1 basta in the case of pCIB3064 and 2 mg/I methotrexate in the case of pSOG35). After approximately one month, developed shoots are transferred to larger sterile containers known as "GA7s" which contain half-strength MS. 2% sucrose, and the same concentration of selection agent.<br>
Tranformation of monocotyledons using Agrobacterium has also been described.   See, WO 94/00977 and U.S. Patent No. 5,591,616, both incorporated herein by reference.<br>
3. Transformation of Plastids<br>
Seeds of Nicotiana tahacum c.v. 'Xanthi nc' are germinated seven per plate in a 1" circular array on T agar medium and bombarded 12-14 days after sowing with 1μm tungsten particles (MIO, Biorad, Hercules, CA) coated with DNA from plasmids pPH143 and pPH145 essentially as described (Svab, Z. and Maliga, P. (1993) PNAS 90, 913-917). Bombarded seedlings are incubated on T medium for two days after which leaves are excised and placed abaxial side up in bright light (350-500 pmol photons/mVs) on plates of RMOP medium (Svab, Z., Hajdukiewicz, P. and Maliga, P. (1990) PNAS 87, 8526-8530) containing 500μglml spectinomycin dihydrochloride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Resistant shoots appearing underneath the bleached leaves three to eight weeks after bombardment are subcloned onto the same selective medium, allowed to form callus, and secondary shoots isolated and subcloned. Complete segregation of transformed plastid genome copies (homoplasmicity) in independent subclones is assessed by standard techniques of Southern blotting (Sambrook et al., (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor). BamHI/EcoRI-digested total cellular DNA (Mettler. I. J. (1987) Plant Mol Biol Reporter 5, 346-349) is separated on 1% Tris-borate (TBE) agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham) and probed with ^^P-labeled random primed DNA sequences corresponding to a 0.7 kb BamHLHindlll DNA fragment from pC8 containing a portion of the rps7/12 plastid targeting sequence. Homoplasmic shoots are rooted aseptically on spectinomycin-containing MS/IB A medium (McBride, K. E. et al. (1994) PNAS 91, 7301-7305) and transferred to the greenhouse.<br><br>
Example 8: Breeding<br>
The plants obtained via tranformation with a nucleic acid sequence of the present invention can be any of a wide variety of plant species, including those of monocots and dicots; however, the plants used in the method of the invention are preferably selected from the list of agronomically important target crops set forth supra. The expression of a gene of the present invention in combination with other characteristics important for production and quality can be incorporated into plant lines through breeding. Breeding approaches and techniques are known in the art. See, for example, Welsh J. R., Fundamentals of Plant Genetics and Breeding, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY (1981); Crop Breeding, Wood D. R. (Ed.)

The genetic properties engineered into the transgenic seeds and plants described above are passed on by sexual reproduction or vegetative growth and can thus be maintained and propagated in progeny plants. Generally said maintenance and propagation make use of known agricultural methods developed to fit specific purposes such as tilling, sowing or harvesting. Specialized processes such as hydroponics or greenhouse technologies can also be applied. As the growing crop is vulnerable to attack and damages caused by insects or infections as well as to competition by weed plants, measures are undertaken to control weeds, plant diseases, insects, nematodes, and other adverse conditions to improve yield. These include mechanical measures such a tillage of the soil or removal of weeds and infected plants, as well as the application of agrochemicals such as herbicides, fungicides, gametocides, nematicides, growth regulants, ripening agents and insecticides.<br>
Use of the advantageous genetic properties of the transgenic plants and seeds according to the invention can further be made in plant breeding, which aims at the development of plants with improved properties such as tolerance of pests, herbicides, or stress, improved nutritional value, increased yield, or improved structure causing less loss from lodging or shattering. The various breeding steps are characterized by well-defined human intervention such as selecting the lines to be crossed, directing pollination of the parental lines.<br><br>
or selecting appropriate progeny plants. Depending on the desired properties, different breeding measures are taken. The relevant techniques are well known in the art and include but arc not limited to hybridization, inbreeding, backcross breeding, multiline breeding, variefv blend, interspecific hybridization, aneuploid techniques, etc. Hybridization techniques also include the sterilization of plants to yield male or female sterile plants by mechanical, chemical, or biochemical means. Cross pollination of a male sterile plant with pollen of a different line assures that the genome of the male sterile but female fertile plant will uniformily obtain properties of both parental lines. Thus, the transgenic seeds and plants according to the invention can be used for the breeding of improved plant lines, that for example, increase the effectiveness of conventional methods such as herbicide or pestidice treatment or allow one to dispense with said methods due to their modified genetic properties. Alternatively new crops with improved stress tolerance can be obtained, which, due to their optimized genetic 'equipment", yield harvested product of better quality than products that were not able to tolerate comparable adverse developmental conditions.<br>
Example 9: Seed Production<br>
In seed production, germination quality and uniformity of seeds are essential product characteristics, whereas germination quality and uniformity of seeds harvested and sold by the farmer is not important. As it is difficult to keep a crop free from other crop and weed seeds, to control seedbome diseases, and to produce seed with good germination, fairly extensive and well-defined seed production practices have been developed by seed producers, who are experienced in the art of growing, conditioning and marketing of pure seed. Thus, it is common practice for the farmer to buy certified seed meeting specific quality standards instead of using seed harvested from his own crop. Propagation material to be used as seeds is customarily treated with a protectant coating comprising herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides, or mixtures thereof Customarily used protectant coatings comprise compounds such as captan, carboxin, thiram (TMTD®), methalaxyl (Apron®), and pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic®). If desired, these compounds are formulated together with carriers, surfactants or application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in<br><br>
formulation art to protect against damage caused by bacterial, fungal or animal pests. The protectant coatings may be applied by impregnating propagation material with a liquid formulation or by coating with a combined wet or dry formulation. Other methods cf application are also possible such as treatment directed at the buds or the fruit.<br>
Example 10:  Maize Plant Analysis<br>

Rice plants transformed with plasmid pNOVI305  via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation give 100% mortality against European cornborcr and fall armyworm.   ELISA 5       data is set forth below:<br><br><br>
Example 12. Cabbage Plant Analysis<br>
Cabbage plants transformed with plasmid pZU578 (SEQ ID NO: 17) via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation were tested against Plutella xyiostidla (Diamondback moth).<br>
     Transgenic and control plants were infested with 16 larvae (1-3 instar), 4 on each of 4 leaves transferred with a paint brush from a caged Plutella culture (with cabbage plants). Infested plants were transferred to Ixlxlm cages for the duration of the test. Control plants included non-transformed cabbage plants (susceptible control) and non-transformed cabbage plants sprayed with the commercial Bt pesticide Dipel (resistant control). Scoring (after 2 weeks)<br>
I       vvas: - = no damage (or only tiny holes = resistant); + = large holes on plant (= susc); ++ many large holes, plant heavily damaged (= susc). Dipel plants always scored -, susceptible controls scored ++. Insect damage ratings for transgenic and control plants and ELISA data is set forth below.<br><br><br><br>
