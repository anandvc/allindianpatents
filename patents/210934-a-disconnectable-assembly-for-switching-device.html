COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (SECTION 10)<br>
A DISCONNECTABLE ASSEMBLY FOR SWITCHING DEVICE<br>
LARSEN &amp; TOUBRO LIMITED<br>
L&amp;T House, Ballard Estate,<br>
MumPai - 400 001 .Mharashtra State, India<br>
An Indian company duly registered and incorporated under<br>
Company's Act, 1956.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Technical field<br>
This invention relates to "A DISCONNECTABLE ASSEMBLY FOR SWITCHING DEVICE". This disconnectable assembly is aimed at enhancing the useful life of switching device by simplifying the connection &amp; disconnection between current carrying parts &amp; the mechanism, and thus the replacement of moving contacts at the end of its electrical life in minimum downtime &amp; with minimum efforts &amp; skill.<br>
Background<br>
The electrical life of any switching device is generally several times lesser than its mechanical life.<br>
By replacing the electrical parts, the product can be used upto it's mechanical life.<br>
A number of designs presently available are such that current switching parts are either not replaceable at all or are not easily replaceable at the user's end. This necessitates sending the product back to manufacturer's premises/service centers or else requisitioning specialists from the supplier.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Some designs, which offer ease of replacement, need expensive parts or high manufacturing/assembly skills.<br>
Yet another way to achieve is by way of complex driving arm of mechanism shaft.<br><br>
Yet another way of achieving pole replacing is by attaining pole cage design, this however necessities use of bolted joins &amp; copper part &amp; thus weakness in electrical parts.<br>
Our invention aims at providing effective, innovative &amp; economic solution for above listed shortcomings.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to provide easy replacement of moving contacts of current switching device, henceforth called "Main Contact Assembly".<br>
Main contact assembly comprises of Fix contact assembly &amp; Moving contact assembly. Switching devices generally have one or more poles. Each pole comprises of one nO. of Fix contact assembly &amp; Moving contact assembly. Fix contact assembly is generally easy to replace in most available designs &amp; is not the subject of invention here. Entire current switching device is housed in an insulated housing made up of two parts -named front cover &amp; rear cover.<br>
Moving contact assembly comprises, assembly of spring-loaded set of contacts hinged at their lower ends and coupled together with the help of Anchor Bar. Circuit breaker is in service i.e carrying current only when Fix contact assembly &amp; Moving contact assembly are in contact with each other; that completes the electrical circuit (current carrying path).<br>
To move this moving contact assembly with desired velocity &amp; make contact with Fix contact assembly &amp; to retain it in the same position with maintaining desired pressure between two contact surfaces of Fix contacts &amp; Moving contacts, equal to or more force is required from the<br><br>
other side; hence Moving contact assembly is connected to a Mechanism through it's; driving arm &amp; in turn through disconnectable assembly.<br>
Disconnectable assembly comprises of four parts namely Anchor bar, entering connector, receiving connector &amp; Locking stud to lock the two connectors. At least one of the entering &amp; receiving connectors are made up of insulating material. Locking stud locks entering connector &amp; receiving connector &amp; can be assembled / removed from top; which is essential since access to Moving contact assembly is only from top. Entering connector remains permanently attached to the Anchor Bar passing through no. of spring loaded Moving contacts. The front cover has openings through which the driving arm of the mechanism drives the disconnectable assembly. Depending on making &amp; breaking of moving contact assembly with Fix contact assembly driving arm of mechanism has two well-known stable positions known as - OPEN &amp; CLOSED.<br>
For easy Moving contact assembly replacement, the two covers forming housing have to be always separated but the most important pre-requirement is easy disconnection of moving contact assembly from the driving arm. Similarly, after new moving contact assembly is housed, equally easy re-connection is needed after the two covers; front cover &amp; rear cover, are fastened.<br>
In the present invention, for disconnecting moving contact assembly, once the switching device is totally disconnected from the main power supply i.e it is not electrically live in any way, is first brought in CLOSED position i.e Moving contact assembly is in contact with Fix contact assembly. This makes the Locking stud head accessible from top of the housing, which has opening from top but is covered with arc-chute used for arc quenching at the time of short circuit, when the switching device is in service. Hence to access this Locking stud one need to remove the arc-chute first. The<br><br>
same Locking stud is not accessible from top of housing in OPEN position of driving arm of mechanism, hence it is required to bring driving arm of mechanism in it's ClOSED position to remove Locking stud. Once the driving arm of mechanism is brought to it's CLOSED position, Locking stud can be removed easily with the help of a normal screw-driver.<br>
Once the Locking stud is withdrawn; then the driving arm of mechanism is brought in OPEN condition because in CLOSED position of driving arm of mechanism, it is not possible to separate two connectors since there is no place to move the Moving contact assembly at rear side. Hence the two pieces of disconnector assembly get disengaged because of removing of Locking studs only when the driving arm of mechanism is brought to it's OPEN position. In the present invention the aforesaid housing can be easily separated and the moving contact assembly(ies) can be dislodged with the rear cover.<br>
For re-connection, the rear cover carrying the Moving contact assembly(ies) is fastened with the front cover, when the driving arm of mechanism is in OPEN mode.<br>
Receiving connector has a projection at it's bottom, which rests on the designed surface provided in Front cover when the driving arm of mechanism is in OPEN position. In the same position Moving contact assembly &amp; hence projection in entering connector which because of smaller projection at it's bottom sits in desired orientation; can be moved manually &amp; aligned / partially inserted in the cavity to adapt the same. Subsequently when the mechanism is brought to it's CLOSED position; this partially inserted entering connector gets fully inserted in the cavity provided in receiving connector to adapt the same. Further the Locking stud can be aligned with hole in receiving connector first &amp; then can be<br><br>
locked with the nut provided in entering connector because of external threads on the Locking stud.<br>
The locking stud is consequently inserted &amp; the two connector pieces become inseparable. The complete Moving contact assembly replacement is thus achieved in very easy way.<br>
For satisfactory operation of switching device under abnormally high fault conditions, the stability of this disconnectable assembly is very important. This is ensured by creating butting surfaces in more than one plane.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows partial side sectional view of a circuit breaker in CLOSED position.<br>
Figure 2 shows partial side sectional view of a circuit breaker in OPEN position.<br>
Figure 3 shows yet another partial side sectional view when receiving connector is sitting in the specifically designed position &amp; entering connector is ready to negotiate its entry.<br>
Figure 4 shows exploded isometric view of the two parts of connector, locking stud and Anchor Bar.<br>
Figure 5 shows the sectional view of Connectors, Anchor Bar &amp; Butting Surfaces.<br><br>
Description of the preferred embodiment<br>
The invention will now be described with the help of above referred drawings, which are non-restrictive examples. They are duly marked with appropriate numerals for convenient reference.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, First bring the driving arm (6a) of mechanism, hence switching device in CLOSED position, the head (4) of Locking stud (1) having suitable cut (4a) to adapt a screwdriver, connecting receiving connector (2) &amp; entering connector (3); is accessible from top opening in housing assembly made by joining front cover (6) &amp; rear cover (7); hence can be removed by common tools like screwdriver.<br>
Once the Locking stud (1) is taken out, driving arm of mechanism is brought to it's OPEN position, which is essential to separate entering connector (3) &amp; receiving connector (2), since there is no space to move Moving contact assembly (8) at rear side in rear cover (7) in it's CLOSED position as can be seen from FIG.1; the bolts (5) which fasten the front cover (6) and rear cover (7) are loosened &amp; removed &amp; the rear cover (7) is pulled out along with Moving contact assembly (8) &amp; Fix contact assembly (8a).<br>
For re-connection, the rear cover (7) duly fitted with new Moving contact assembly(ies) (8) is fastened with the front cover (6). For re-connection it is essential to bring the driving arm (6a) of mechanism i.e switching device in OPEN condition first; to facilitate initial entry of entering connector (3) in the cavity (2b) provided in receiving connector (2).<br>
As shown in Figure 3, once the driving arm (6a) of mechanism is brought to OPEN condition, by virtue of the specially designed profile (9) of front cover (6) &amp; specially designed profile (10) of receiving connector (2), the entering connector (2) sits in the designed position. Similarly, due to the<br><br>
co-ordinated design of profile (11) of entering connector (3) &amp; design of profile (12) of Moving contact assembly (8), entering connector (3) which restricts the complete rotation of entering connector &amp; (3) i.e. it doesn't get any access at it's rear side &amp; hence sits in a desired orientation. A mild guidance to projection (3b) in entering connector (3) attached to Moving contact assembly (8) ensures partial entry of entering connector (3). If in this position of receiving connector (2) &amp; entering male connector (3); the switching device is brought to it's CLOSED position, then the complete entry of entering connector (3) takes place because of the design.<br>
Entering connector (3) has circular cavity (3a) in it &amp; a threaded nut trapped in it to adapt threaded Locking stud (1). Also, receiving connector (2) carries a through circular cavity (2a) in it; which once entering connector (3) gets fully inserted in receiving connector (2) that has the butting surfaces [(14) as ref in Fig 5 ] which ensures the stability of the connectors, Anchor bar (13) which is tightly fitted to the entering connector such that they can have relative movement there excessive gap between Anchor Bar [(13) as ref in Fig 5] &amp; entering connector (3), axis of cavity (3a) in entering connector (3) gets aligned with the axis of cavity (2a) in receiving connector (2); hence clears the path of Locking stud (1) once entered in the cavity (2a) in receiving connector (2) from top. Once entering connector (3) gets fully inserted in the cavity (2a) in receiving connector (2); the Locking stud (1) is re-engaged &amp; locked from top. This completes the Moving contact assembly (8) replacement.<br><br>
