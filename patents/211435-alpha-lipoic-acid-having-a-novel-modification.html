				<td>Alpha-lipoic acid having a novel modification<br>
Alpha-lipoic acid is used in pharmaceutical<br>
formulations for oral administration both in infusion<br>
solutions and in solid pharmaceutical formulations. For<br>
this, synthetically produced, racemic DL-alpha-lipoic<br>
acid, which is also referred to as RS-thioctic acid, is<br>
employed.<br>
One enantiomer of alpha-lipoic acid, R-thioctic acid,<br>
occurs as a natural substance in virtually all animal<br>
and plant cells. As a coenzyme in the oxidative<br>
decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids (e.g. pyruvic<br>
acid), R-thioctic acid is of essential importance.<br>
Thioctic acid is pharmacologically active and has anti-inflammatory <br>
and antinociceptive (analgesic) as well as<br>
cytoprotective properties. An important medical indication <br>
is the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy.<br>
Furthermore, thioctic acid is used in cosmetics and for<br>
nutritional supplementation, e.g. on account of its<br>
antioxidative action. The use of R-thioctic acid<br>
appears particularly advantageous here, since this is<br>
present in naturally identical form (see also<br>
EP 0 572 922 A1), and is only incorporated into the<br>
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex as a cofactor in natural<br>
form (Oehring et al., Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 373,<br>
333-335, 1992). According to more recent results (Baur<br>
et al., Klin. Wochenschr. 1991, 69(15), 722-4),<br>
thioctic acid may possibly gain importance in the<br>
control of the illness caused by HIV-1 and HTLV-IIIB<br>
viruses.<br>
In the pure optical isomers of thioctic acid (R and S<br>
form, i.e. R-thioctic acid and S-thioctic acid), unlike<br>
the racemate, the R enantiomer mainly has antiinflammatory <br>
activity and the S enantiomer mainly<br>
antinociceptive activity (see also EP 0 427 247 A2). To<br>
achieve a selective action, the preparation and use of<br>
the pure enantiomers is therefore of great importance.<br>
For the specific preparation of the pure enantiomers,<br>
R- or S-thioctic acid, a number of processes are known<br>
which as a rule include an enantioselective synthesis<br>
step for the production of a suitable chiral precursor<br>
or intermediate. All processes known hitherto require a<br>
high synthetic outlay, or efforts to deplete the<br>
undesired enantiomer, and have hitherto not facilitated<br>
use on the industrial scale.<br>
The melting range of the pure enantiomers of thioctic<br>
acid (47 to 49°C) is lower compared with the racemic<br>
compound (58-61°C). In the preparation of solid pharmaceutical <br>
formulations, which as a rule proceeds under<br>
compression or compaction, the use of pressure on the<br>
material is indispensable, so that on the one hand<br>
warming and on the other hand melting of the thioctic<br>
acid takes place. Concentrated solutions of thioctic<br>
acid or its melts polymerize immediately and can no<br>
longer be converted into a crystalline form by cooling.<br>
In the case of pure enantiomers of thioctic acid, this<br>
effect is strongly pronounced on account of the lower<br>
melting point. For therapeutic use of the pure enantiomers, <br>
which is desirable per se, the use of basic salts<br>
was proposed (see also EP 702 953 A2).<br>
The object of the present invention is to prepare<br>
thioctic acid which contains the desired enantiomer in<br>
enriched form, and at the same time, on the other hand,<br>
to discover a modification or form which, on account of<br>
its physical properties, behaves during processing as<br>
largely as possible like racemic thioctic acid.<br>
If, in the preparation of thioctic acid by a suitable<br>
synthetic preparation process, one enantiomer is<br>
enriched, but still not completely, surprisingly,<br>
during crystallization from suitable solvents, thioctic<br>
acid is obtained which contains the prevailing<br>
enantiomer enriched, but does not behave like the<br>
corresponding solid mixtures of the crystalline<br>
racemate with pure crystalline R- or S-thioctic acid.<br>
The novel modification formed shows an X-ray powder<br>
diffractogram which does not correspond to those of the<br>
racemate, the pure enantiomers or mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to thioctic acid having a<br>
predominant content of one enantiomer, preferably<br>
having an enantiomer ratio of 60:40 to 97:3, which is<br>
present in a novel modification. In Figures 1 and 2,<br>
the typical X-ray diffractogram recordings of racemic<br>
RS-thioctic acid and of pure R-thioctic acid, which are<br>
known from the literature, are shown. Furthermore,<br>
Figures 3 to 5 show X-ray powder diffractograms which<br>
originate from crystallized thioctic acid which is<br>
prepared from solutions of thioctic acid enriched in<br>
pure enantiomers. In Figure 3, a thioctic acid having a<br>
content of R enantiomer of 66% and 34% S enantiomer is<br>
illustrated, in Figure 4 with a content of R enantiomer<br>
of 76% and 24% S enantiomer and in Figure 5 a thioctic<br>
acid having a content of R enantiomer of 95% with 5%<br>
S enantiomer.<br>
Surprisingly, the thioctic acid according to the invention <br>
exhibits a melting range of 48 to 59°C, which<br>
differs from the expected eutectic melting range of 44<br>
to 48°C. Furthermore, it facilitates preferred pharmaceutical <br>
processing and has a better temperature<br>
stability compared with the pure enantiomer.<br>
The crystallization of the thioctic acid can be<br>
performed in a suitable organic solvent. Examples of<br>
organic solvents which can also contain water are,<br>
inter alia, aliphatic hydrocarbons having a carbon<br>
chain length of between 3 and 10 carbon atoms, aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons which are liquid, esters of aliphatic or<br>
cycloaliphatic carboxylic acids having 2 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms and aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols having 1<br>
to 6 carbon atoms, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols<br>
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, ethers and glycol ethers or<br>
homogeneous mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
Particularly preferred solvents are ethyl acetate,<br>
hexane, cyclohexane, pentane, heptane, diisopropyl<br>
ether, toluene, ethanol and their homogeneous mixtures.<br>
The purity and composition of the thioctic acids<br>
obtained was determined by means of analysis on a<br>
chiral HPLC column. The melting ranges were determined<br>
by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)<br>
with a heating rate of 2°K/min. The present invention<br>
makes it possible to make the enantiomers of thioctic<br>
acid accessible for various applications in enriched<br>
form, which can be obtained crystalline and pure in a<br>
simple and economical manner from solutions thereof.<br>
The invention is illustrated in greater detail by the<br>
following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
41.2 g of racemic thioctic acid were dissolved in a<br>
mixture of 960 ml of cyclohexane and 240 ml of ethyl<br>
acetate at 40°C and 12.0 g (100 mmol) of<br>
S-(-)-a-methylbenzylamine were then slowly added<br>
dropwise.<br>
The mixture was then cooled to 25°C, and the<br>
precipitate was filtered off with suction and washed<br>
with cyclohexane-ethyl acetate mixture. 660 ml of water<br>
were added to the filtrate and a pH of 1-1.5 was set at<br>
room temperature using about 10% strength hydrochloric<br>
acid. The phases were separated and the aqueous phase<br>
was extracted a further time with 60 ml of cyclohexaneethyl <br>
acetate mixture.<br>
The combined organic phases were distilled in vacuo to<br>
about 1/5 of the original volume.<br>
The distillation residue obtained was cooled to -5 to<br>
-10°C and stirred for crystallization.<br>
The precipitate was filtered off, washed and dried.<br>
