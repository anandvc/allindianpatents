				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of energetic coordination compound tris carbohydrazide nickel perchlorate (NCP) with desired particle morphology and bulk density. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing NCP with bulk density in the range of 0.85 to 0.9 g/cm3.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART DESCRIPTION<br>
Detonators are the key devices needed to initiate an explosive train. The detonators contain a small quantity of a sensitive explosive as a means of its initiation. The inorganic azides {lead azide (LA) and silver azide (SA)} are generally used as an ingredient in detonator composition. Mercury fulminate was the first choice as an initiator. It still finds use as one of the ingredients in some of the cap compositions.<br>
However, disadvantage of using mercury fulminate is that it is highly prone to mechanical stimuli. Another disadvantage of mercury fulminate is that it has poor stability during storage. Yet another disadvantage of mercury fulminate is that it gets "dead pressed" and becomes insensitive to ignition by flash when compressed under a pressure of 200 MPa. Service lead azide (SLA) replaced mercury fulminate as it does not get dead pressed. The disadvantage of using SLA as initiatory compound is that it is highly sensitive towards impact and friction and is highly prone to hazards during manufacturing and handling. Another disadvantage of SLA is its instability in presence of moisture and carbon dioxide resulting in the formation of hazardous hydrazoic acid on exposure to them. Yet another disadvantage of SLA is its poor compatibility with other metals like copper used for detonator casing resulting in the formation of the azides (copper azide).<br>
Recently, a basic lead azide (BLA) has replaced SLA in most of the detonators in India. Although, BLA containing lead oxide in combination with SLA overcomes some of the problems associated with SLA alone, inherent drawbacks of SLA persist though to a lesser extent. Yet another disadvantage of BLA is its relative insensitivity to flame. Lead styphnate (LS) is another initiatory compound, which is widely used to render BLA flash sensitive. The disadvantage of using LS is that it is having less initiating power than other initiatory explosives and cannot be used as a main initiator. Another disadvantage of using LS is its high sensitivity to electrostatic charge. Yet another disadvantage of LS is that it accelerates the decomposition of LA into hydrazoic acid and thereby facilitates the formation of hazardous products.<br>
The standard tubular detonators normally contains ASA composition (Azide, Styphnate, Aluminium) which contains mixture of service lead azide (65%), lead styphnate (32.5%) and aluminium powder (2.5%), which is pressed above the initially pressed base charge of high explosive tetryl/penta erithritoltetranitrate. The disadvantage of using ASA composition is similar to above described drawbacks of lead azide and lead styphnate.<br>
Efforts are on to replace these commonly used initiatory explosives by introducing lead (Pb) free chemical compounds having lower sensitivity and greater stability. 5-cyanotetrazolatepentaamine cobalt (III) perchlorate (CP) is one such type of lead free initiator. It has been reported as possible replacements for primary explosives such as LA and LS. The disadvantage of CP is that one of the starting materials used for its preparation is cyanqgens, which is one of the banned chemical due to severe environmental protection agency (EPA) restrictions.<br>
Efforts are on to replace CP by another energetic co-ordination compound Bis(5-nitrotetrazolato)tetraamine cobalt perchlorate (BNCP), which is found to have greater explosive output than CP and undergoes deflagration to detonation to transition (DDT) with less confinement. This material is of interest for low voltage, hot wire detonator applications like semiconductor bridge detonators.<br>
Tris carbohydrazide nickel perchlorate (NCP) is another energetic co-ordination compound. It is thermally stable even at temperature above 300°C, has free flow morphology with bulk density of 0.85-0.90 g/cm3. To the best of the Inventors knowledge none of the publications reports the actual process for the preparation of NCP and its use in detonators. Although, Beijing Institute of technology, China and Mendeleev University of Technology, Russia have reported the preparation of similar energetic co-ordination compounds for energetic ballistic modifier applications, none of these institutes mention the potential use of NCP as an initiator compound.<br>
Initiator compounds for the detonators have been placed by the United States Military manual under category number 27. The ideal qualities which the initiator compounds should have are also given in the category.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of energetic coordination compound Tris carbohydrazide nickel perchlorate (NCP) for use as an initiator compound.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of NCP having bulk density in the range of 0.85 to 0.90 g/cm3 and with free flow morphology. Yet another object of the present invention is to utilize NCP thus prepared alone and in combination with tetryl (CE) for detonator applications.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of Tris carbohydrazide nickel perchlorate (NCP) of desired particle size of 90-200 microns having bulk density of 0.85-0.90 g/cm3 with free flow morphology. The process of the present invention involves the reaction of nickel perchlorate hexahydrate with carbohydrazide at elevated temperature. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature for 1 to 2 hours under constant stirring to obtain NCP crystals having particle size in the range of 90 to 200 microns. The Tris carbohydrazide nickel perchlorate thus obtained is filtered, washed (with propanol) and dried at 60 to 80°C. The NCP having particle size in the range of 90-200 micron was pressed in detonator No. 27 at 7-8 MPa pressure with dwell time of 45-60 seconds and detonated with the aid of safety fuse on a witness plate (3-4 mm lead plate). The incorporation of NCP into detonators containing tetryl, resulted in punched neat holes having 7 to 8 mm diameter.<br>

e.	filtering the blue crystals and washing the same to obtain tris-carbohydrazide nickel<br>
perchlorate.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention wherein in step (a), the carbohydrazide solution and the nickel perchlorate hyxahydrate solution are aqueous solutions.<br>

obtained are washed with water and subsequently with methyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol or<br>
propyl alcohol isopropyl alcohol.<br>

perchlorate hyxahydrate solution is in the range of 0.01 to 0.3 moles and preferably between<br>

carbohydrazide solution is in the range of 0.01 to 1.05 moles and preferably 0.01 to 0.70 moles.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the process for preparing NCP<br>
is carried out in the following manner:<br>

In another set of experiments, tetryl (500 to 600 mg) was filled in the tubular detonators and pressed at 7-8 MPa pressure with dwell time of 45 -60 seconds. NCP (300-400 mg) was pressed above to the pressed tetryl at 7-8 MPa under identical consitions. Safety fuse of 20 cm length was inserted into the filled tubular detonator tube touching the filled NCP layer and crimped softly. The filled tubular detonator tube was vertically placed on the lead plate of 3-4 mm thickness and then safety fuse was ignited using safety match. The diameter of the neat punched hole formed was measured.<br>
