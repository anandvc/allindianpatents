				<td>AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT AND METHOD OF STRESS TESTING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to stress testing for microprocessors and other<br>
agents in a computer system. More specifically, the present invention relates to an on-die<br>
validation functional unit block ("FUB") provided in an agent such as a microprocessor.<br>
[2]	In a computer system, an "agent" may include any device that communicates with<br>
other devices via a common communication bus using a common bus interface protocol<br>
Typical agents include microprocessors, memory controllers, bridge interface circuits,<br>
digital signal processors and application specific integrated circuits As can be<br>
appreciated, a modern agent may include several hundreds of thousands of transistors<br>
fabricated into a single integrated circuit. Although circut validation are simulated before<br>
the circuit designs are fabricated in an operable curcuit validation testing is<br>
necessary to ensure that the integrated circuit behaves in practice as the design<br>
intends.<br>
[3]	Validation testing includes stress testing Stress testing involves pushing the<br>
operating conditions of an agent to its performance links to determine that the agent's<br>
actual behavior matches simulated predictions. Stress testing, however, is a costly,<br>
complicated hit-or-miss process because it traditionally is performed through software-<br>
controlled algorithms. When an integrated circuit is manufactured, traditional stress<br>
testing requires that the integrated circuit execute program instructions that are designed<br>
to place the agent in a predetermined condition of stress. For example, software may be<br>
written to cause two different processors to continually read and modify data at the same<br>
memory location By creating contention between the two processors, it provides an<br>
opportunity for validation personnel to observe the behavior of the processors as they<br>
compete over the same piece of data. Of course, the precise instant when the desired<br>
stress event occurs cannot be predicted. Thus, diagnostic personnel must observe<br>
thousands of bus transactions to determine when (sometimes, if) the stress event occurs<br>
Not only is it expensive to design stress-testing software, it is expensive to review and<br>
interpret stress testing results<br>
[4]	Software-controlled algorithms do not provide much control at all. To test the<br>
functioning of external bus logic, the circuitry within an agent that controls the agent's<br><br>
interface to the external bus, it is desirable to maintain a sustained level of high traffic on<br>
the bus. Software-controlled algorithms can be interrupted by context switches by the<br>
operating system and other events. This can tower the level of traffic on the bus.<br>
Additionally, there is no way to software-controlled algorithms cannot respond to events<br>
on the external bus sufficiently quickly to guarantee that timing relationships can be<br>
maintained on the bus to test certain bus events. Indeed, there are many events that<br>
validation engineers would like to test that cannot be sensed by software at all. All ot<br>
these issues reduce the efficiency of validation testing through software.<br>
[5]	Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved validation testing scheme<br>
for use in a processor or other agent.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[13]	Embodiments of the present invention provide a validation FUB for an agent, a<br>
hardware system within the agent that places a computer system in a stress condition. A<br><br>
validation FUB may monitor transactions posted on an external bus and generate other<br>
transactions in response to the monitored transactions. The validation FUB may be a<br>
programmable element whose response may be defined by an external input<br>
Accordingly, the validation FUB may test a wide variety of system events.<br>
[14]	FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of FUBs in an agent 100 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. An agent 100 may include a core 110 and data<br>
request handler 120 provided in communication with an external bus 130. The data<br>
request handler 120 may interface with the bus 130 via an external bus controller ("EBC")<br>
140. The EBC 140 manages the progress of transactions on the external bus 130. The<br>
core 110 may read and modify data as it executes program instructions. It may generate<br>
data requests to the data request handler 120, to read data from or store data to<br>
predetermined memory locations of a system memory (not shown).<br>
[15]	The data request handler 120 may receive data requests from the core 110 and<br>
from possibly other sources (not shown) within the agent 100. H interprets the data<br>
requests and, if the agent must communicate with other agents to fully the request, it<br>
generates an external bus transaction in response thereto. The data request handler 120<br>
may include various queues for management of the data requests and may interface with<br>
other FUBs, for example internal caches (not shown), to manage the data requests in<br>
this regard the architecture and operation of an agent 100 is well-known.<br>
[13]	An embodiment of the present invention may introduce a validation FUB 150 into<br>
an agent 100. The validation FUB 150 may be coupled to the EBC 140 to observe<br>
transactions posted on the external bus 130. In response to a predetermined triggering<br>
condition, the validation FUB 150 may generate data for a new transaction, called a<br>
"harassing" bus transaction, to be posted on the external bus 130. Several different<br>
types of triggering conditions are possible. When a new external bus transaction is<br>
observed, a harassing transaction may be generated if a request type of the new<br>
transaction matches a predetermined type. The first external bus transaction is said to<br>
be a "triggering" transaction. Alternatively, ail external bus transaction (except harassing<br>
transactions from the validation FUB 150) may be triggering transactions. In this case,<br>
harassing bus transactions would be generated for every transaction on the external bus<br>
130.<br>
[17]	An agent 100 may include a selection multiplexer ("MUX") 160 to select<br>
transaction data from either the data request handler 120 or the FUB.	In one<br><br><br>
embodiment, the MUX 160 may be controlled solely by the validation FUB 150. In an<br>
alternate embodiment, shown in phantom, the MUX 160 may be controlled both by the<br>
validation FUB 150 and by the core 110. In this case, data requests from the core 110<br>
may have a higher priority than the data requests from the validation FUB 150 This<br>
alternate embodiment is discussed in greater detail herein.<br>
[18]	The validation FUB 150 may provides several advantages for stress testing over<br>
prior, software-controlled schemes. The validation FUB 150 operates within the clock<br>
domain of the agent in which it sits and, therefore, can create stress test events with<br>
greater reliability than would be available in a software-controlled algorithm. In certain<br>
applications, the validation FUB 150 can observe a triggering bus transaction and<br>
generate a new "harassing" bus transaction as the very next bus transaction. Thus, using<br>
the foregoing example where two agents compete for the same piece of data, the<br>
validation FUB 150 of the present embodiment can be used in a such a way so as to<br>
ensure that a harassing bus transaction is generated in-response to each and every bus<br>
transaction requesting the contested data. Each time a transaction requesting the data is<br>
observed, the validation FUB may generate-another bus transaction addressing the same<br>
data Thus, the hit-or-miss nature of software-controlled algorithms can be avoided<br>
[19]	Because the validation FUB 150 operates within the clock domain of the agent, a<br>
clock that often is much faster than the clock domain of the external bus, it may generate<br>
stress conditions with much finer timing relationships than were previously possible.<br>
Consider an embodiment where the external bus is a pipelined bus. In a pipelined bus<br>
protocol, such as the bus protocol defined for the Pentium Pro® processor, data is<br>
requested in a bus transaction. A bus transaction may be organized into a variety of<br>
phases. For the Pentium Pro® processor, the bus transaction includes an arbitration<br>
phase, a request phase, an error phase, a snoop phase, a response phase and, finally, a<br>
data phase. Each type of data request does not proceed through all possible phases A<br>
pipelined bus may permit several bus transactions to be in progress on the bus<br>
simultaneously but each request must be in a different phase: Thus, after first transaction<br>
concludes the request phase and enters the error phase, a second transaction may enter<br>
the request phase. Transitions among the various phases occurs at the clock domain of<br>
the external bus. For more information reference may be made to the Pentium® Pro<br>
Family	Developer's	Manual,	Volume	1:	Specifications<br>
(http://developer intel.com/design/pro/MANUALS/242690.HTM)<br><br>
[20]	The validation FUB 150, because it may operate in the domain of the agent's<br>
clock, may detect and respond to triggering conditions often while the triggering bus<br>
transaction remains pending on the external bus. Thus, in an embodiment, a validation<br>
FUB 150 may generate and post a harassing transaction on the bus before the<br>
transaction that triggered it concludes. No known stress testing technique permits an<br>
agent to capture and respond to a triggering transaction while the triggering transaction<br>
remains pending on an external bus<br>
[21]	The validation FUB 150 provides another advantage in that it can stress test a<br>
single-processor computing system. Software-controlled stress testing typically required<br>
at least two processors each executing custom software to generate desired stress test<br>
scenarios. A validation FUB 150 may eavesdrop on transactions generated by the agent<br>
in which it is located and may generate harassing transactions in response to<br>
transactions observed on the external bus. Further, no special software is necessary.<br>
Thus, instead of investing time and money to develop custom software appJ/cations for<br>
multiple processors, a validation FUB 150 permits developers to stress test their agents in<br>
a single-agent system executing off-the-shelf software packages The validation FUB<br>
150, therefore, can dramatically reduce development costs for integrated circuit<br>
developers<br>
[22]	FIG 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method of operation 1000 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Operation may begin when a new transaction is<br>
posted on the external bus According to the embodiment, transaction data may be<br>
captured by the validation FUB (box 1010). The validation FUB may determine whether a<br>
request type of the transaction matches a predetermined triggering condition (box 1020).<br>
If so, the validation FUB may generate harassing transaction data using an address<br>
captured from the external bus transaction (box 1030) The new data request may be<br>
output to the EBC (box 1040). If the captured data request did not match the<br>
predetermined triggering condition, the method may end.<br>
[23]	Optionally, when the captured request type data matches a triggering condition,<br>
the captured address may be modified (box 1050, shown in phantom) For example, the<br>
captured address may be incremented or decremented by a cache line increment. As is<br>
known, memory systems typically are organized into predetermined units commonly<br>
called "cache lines." For example, in the Pentium Pro® processor, commercially<br>
available from Intel Corporation, cache lines are 32 bytes in length. In other processors,<br><br>
cache lines may have different lengths. By incrementing (or decrementing) a latched<br>
address by a cache line unit, the validation FUB 150 may direct transactions to adjacent<br>
locations in system memory. In such an embodiment, rather than direct a new external<br>
transaction to the same address as was observed on the external bus, the validation FUB<br>
150 may direct the new external transaction to an adjacent cache line.<br>
[24]	In another embodiment, captured address may be incremented or decremented<br>
by amounts that are less than a cache line unit Although agents may exchange data in<br>
cache line-sized units, bus transactions typically address system memory using<br>
addresses having granularities that are smaller than a cache line increment. Such<br>
techniques permit computer systems to identify a data "chunk," data units that are smaller<br>
than a cache line size, that is needed by the requesting agent. By addressing the specific<br>
chunk that the agent needs, other agents (such as a memory controller or another agent<br>
that stored the data) may order delivery of the requested cache line in such a way to<br>
provide the requested chunk first, before delivery of other portions of the cache line. For<br>
example, in the Pentium Pro® system, a data phase of an external bus transaction may<br>
occur over four cycles, each transferring an 8 byte chunk In such a system, the<br>
requested chunk may be transferred in a first cycle, followed by the remaining chunks<br>
from the cache fine in later cycles.<br>
[25]	In this embodiment, where a captured address may be incremented or<br>
decremented by an amount that is less than a cache line unit, the validation FUB 150<br>
may cause a new external bus transaction to be posled on the external bus. The new<br>
bus transaction would have an address that refers to the same cache line in system<br>
memory that was referenced by the captured bus transaction but may refer to a different<br>
chunk within the cache line than did the captured bus transaction.<br>
[26]	When captured addresses are modified and included within harassing<br>
transactions, different system operating conditions may be stress tested. As is known,<br>
during operation, agents often retrieve data from consecutive locations in system<br>
memory For example, executable program instructions often are stored in sequential<br>
locations of system memories Data arrays and other structure also often are stored in<br>
sequential locations of system memories By incrementing or decrementing captured<br>
addresses by a cache line increment, a validation FUB 150 may retneve data that is likely<br>
to be requested by another agent in a computer system The validation FUB 150, in<br>
essence, wou/d retrieve data tn anticipation that another agent will need the data in the<br><br>
near future and can permit stress testing of data contention devices within the computer<br>
system.<br>
[27]	An embodiment of the present invention imposes a priority scheme among data<br>
requests from the core 100 and the validation FUB 150. Returning to FIG 1, data<br>
requests from the validation FUB 150 are shown being input to the MUX 160 along with<br>
data requests from the data request handier 120. Thus, data requests from the validation<br>
FUB 150 may be thought as "competing" with the data request handler 120 for the<br>
resources of the external bus 130. According to an embodiment, the MUX 160 may be<br>
controlled not only by the validation FUB 150 but also by the data request handler 120 in<br>
such an embodiment, the MUX 160 may select a data request from the data request<br>
handler 120 when the core 100 is generating data requests to the data request handler<br>
120. The MUX 160 may select data requests from the validation FUB 150 when there are<br>
no data requests being generated by the core 100 Thus, data requests from the data<br>
request handler 120 may be processed with higher priority than requests from the<br>
validation FUB 150 This feature permits stress testing to occur while a computer system<br>
performs useful work<br>
[28]	FIG. 3 illustrates an agent 200 according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention In this embodiment, an agent 200 may include a core 210 and a data request<br>
handler 220 as in the foregoing embodiment In this embodiment, the data request<br>
handier 220 may field data requests from various sources within the agent 200 and may<br>
generate externa! bus transactions to fulfill the data requests. It may interface with the<br>
bus 230 via an external bus interface ("EBI") 240 which may include electrical drivers and<br>
interface circuitry to generate and capture electrical signals on the bus 230. In this<br>
regard, the operation of the agent 200 is well-known<br>
[29]	In an embodiment, the agent 200 may include a validation FUB 250 The<br>
validation FUB 250 may interface with the EBI 240 to observe transactions on the<br>
external bus 230. The validation FUB 250 may output harassing data requests to the<br>
data request handler 220. In this embodiment, the data request handler 220 may include<br>
an arbiter 260 for managing data requests input to the data request handler 220 from the<br>
core 210 and various other sources The data request handler 220 would include other<br>
processing elements 270 to manage and fuffill the data requests. In this embodiment, the<br>
validation FUB 250 may input data requests to the data request handler 220 which would<br>
be processed in the same manner as a data request from any other source within the<br><br>
agent 200. Thus, data requests from the validation FUB 250 could be queued by the data<br>
request handler 220 and possibly may be fulfilled within the agent 200 itself, depending<br>
upon operating conditions.<br>
[30]	The embodiment of FIG. 3 optionally may operate according to a priority scheme<br>
among data requests. Shown in phantom, the arbiter 260 may be controlled not only by<br>
the validation FUB 250 but also by the core 210. White data requests are being<br>
generated by the core 210, the arbiter 260 may admit the core data requests to the<br>
exclusion of data requests from the validation FUB 250. At other times, the arbiter 260<br>
may admit data requests from the validation FUB 250.<br>
[31]	FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a valid for according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The validatin may include a transaction latch 310, a<br>
request library 320 and a controler 330. Transaction 310 may receive<br>
transaction data from the external bus 130 and elsewhere within the<br>
validation FUB 300. The request library active a register memory or other data<br>
structure storing data requests. The controler 330 may manage operation of the<br>
validation FUB 300.<br>
[32]	According to an embodiment, the request library 320 may store data patterns<br>
corresponding to each of the data requests that can be handled by the data request<br>
handler 120 (FlG. 1). The request library 320 may receive latched address data from the<br>
transaction latch 310. Under management from the controller 330, the request library 320<br>
may append address data received from the transaction latch 310 to a request pattern<br>
stored within to form a data request. The request library 320 may output the data request<br>
to the MUX 360. Thus, the validation FUB 300 may generate new data requests in<br>
response to transactions on the external bus.<br>
[33]	The controller 330 may be a programmable state machine, in an embodiment,<br>
having registers (not shown) that store information identifying the data transactions to<br>
which the validation FUB 300 should respond. As shown in FIG. 4. the controller 330<br>
may include a first register 332 to store transaction type data and a second register 334<br>
to store a data request index. The transaction type data may determine the triggering<br>
condition to which the validation FUB 300 should respond. The first register 332 may be<br>
a CAM register or some other register having match detection logic. During an<br>
initialization mode, transaction type data may be loaded into the first register 332<br>
Thereafter, during stress testing, the controller 330 may receive transaction type data<br><br><br>
from transactions posted on the external bus 130 If the newly receive transaction type<br>
data matches the transaction type data stored during initialization, the controller 330 may<br>
determine to output a new data request from the validation FUB 300<br>
[34]	The data request index may determine how the validation FUB 300 will respond to<br>
a triggering condition. It may be stored in a second register 334, loaded into the register<br>
during initialization. The data request index can address a data request pattern stored in<br>
the instruction library 320 When the controller 330 determines that a transaction type<br>
match occurs with respect to the first register 332, it may apply the index value from the<br>
second register 334 to the instruction library 320 and cause data for a harassing<br>
transaction to be read out. As noted, the instruction library 320 may append an address<br>
value received from the transaction latch 310 with the data request pattern from the<br>
library to create a valid data request.<br>
[35]	As discussed above, the instruction library 320 may receive address data directly<br>
from the transaction latch 310. This embodiments.permits the validation FUB 300 to<br>
generate external bus transactions (via the data request handler 120) that are directed to<br>
the same data referenced in the triggering bus transaction. In an alternate embodiment,<br>
the instruction library 320 may generate data requests ';o addresses that are related, but<br>
not identical, to the addresses received from the transaction latch 310<br>
[36]	FIG 4 illustrates in phantom an optional address manipulator 340 operating under<br>
management of the controller 330. The address manipulator 340 may perform arithmetic<br>
operations on address data from the transaction latch 310 It may output altered address<br>
data to the instruction library 320. For example, the address manipulator 340 may<br>
increment or decrement an address by a cache line increment. Alternatively, the address<br>
manipulator may increment or decrement the address by a chunk value.<br>
[37]	To integrate the validation FUB 300 into existing designs, it may be advantageous<br>
to do so in ways that do not require changes to the data request handlers provided in the<br>
existing designs. In such applications, it may not be feasible to provision the request<br>
library with every data request defined for the agent For example, in some designs,<br>
memory write requests, 10 write requests, interrupt requests, interrupt acknowledgment<br>
requests and purge requests may require significant changes to request and response<br>
logic to support such data requests if they were generated by the validation FUB 300<br>
rather than some other component within an agent In such embodiments, these requests<br><br>
may be omitted from the transaction library to simplify use of the validation FUB 300 in<br>
those designs.<br>
[38]	In another embodiment, instructions may be omitted from the transaction library if<br>
their use could violate cache coherency or other system inregrity mechanisms. As is<br>
known, many multiprocessor computer systems operate according to a cache coherency<br>
scheme in which each item of data stored in a processor is assigned a coherency state.<br>
The state of the data determines how the processor may use the data. For example, in<br>
the known "MESI" protocol, data may be assigned to one of four states:<br>
•	Invalid -- Although the agent may have cached a copy of data, the copy<br>
is unavailable to the agent. When the agent requires the data, the<br>
agent must fetch the data from external memory or from another<br>
cache.<br>
•	Shared - A cached copy is valid and possesses the same value as is<br>
stored in external memory. The agent may only read the data. Copies<br>
of the data may be stored in (he caches of other agents. An agent may<br>
not modify data in shared state without first performing an external bus<br>
transaction to ensure that the agent has exclusive control over the<br>
copy of data.<br>
•	Exclusive - The cached copy is valid and may possess the same value<br>
as is stored in external memory. When an agent caches data in<br>
exclusive state, it may read and write (modify) the data without an<br>
external cache coherency check.<br>
•	Modified — The cached copy is valid and is dirty. It may be more<br>
current than the copy stored in external memory. The data must be<br>
invalid in all other agents.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a transaction library may omit<br>
certain transactions that could cause a system to violate cache coherency rules. For<br>
example, a zero data length transactions such as BRLO (bus read line with zero length),<br>
lO reads and other transactions that require coherency support may be omitted in an<br>
embodiment.<br>
[39]	FIG. 5 illustrates an embodiment of a processor 400 constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention The processor 400 may include a bus<br>
sequencing unit 410 ("BSU") and a core 420. Both the BSU 410 and the core 420 may<br>
operate at much greater speeds than are associated with an external bus 430. The<br>
external bus 430 interconnects the processor 400 with other components such as other<br>
processors, memories and other devices (not shown)<br><br><br>
[40]	BSUs per se are known. They may include an arbiter 440, a cache memory 450,<br>
an internal queue 460 and an external transaction queue 470 The arbiter 440 may<br>
receive requests from a variety of inputs, such as from the core 420 and perhaps from<br>
other sources. Requests may include a request code representing the type of request<br>
being made and, where appropriate, an address identifying a memory location to which<br>
the request is directed.<br>
[41]	The cache 450 may be an internal memory. As is known, relative to core cache<br>
memories (not shown), the cache 450 typically possesses much greater capacity. For<br>
example, a typical cache 450 may be a 256 memory By contrast a core data cache may<br>
be a 16K memory and a core instruction cache may be an 16K memory The cache 450<br>
may be a unified cache, one that stores both instruction data and variable data<br>
(collectively, "data"). The BSQ 400 also may interface with higher levels of cache (not<br>
show), which may 3H or more in size.<br>
[42]	Read requests from the arbiter 440 may be input to both the cache 450 and to the<br>
internal queue 460 The cache 450 may include control logic (not shown) that can<br>
determine whether the requested data is stored in the cache 450. If so, the request is<br>
said to "hit" the cache 450. The cache 450 will furnish the requested data to the core 420<br>
over a communication path (also not shown). Otherwise, the request is said to "miss" the<br>
cache. The cache 450 may communicate a hit or a miss to the internal queue 430 over a<br>
line 452.<br>
[43]	The internal queue 460 may include control circuitry and buffer memory to<br>
process requests from the arbiter 430. The internal queue 460 also receives hit/miss<br>
indicators from the cache 450. If a read request hits the cache 450, the internal queue<br>
460 may permit the queued request to terminate as it advances out of the queue 460.<br>
But if a read request misses the cache 450, the request should be completed by<br>
retrieving the requested data from an external memory (not shown). In this case, when<br>
the read request advances out of the internal queue 460 the internal queue 460 may<br>
cause the request to be entered in the external transaction queue 470<br>
[44]	The external transaction queue 470 also may include control circuitry and buffer<br>
memory. It may cause external bus transactions to be posted on the external bus 430<br>
pursuant to queued requests issued from within the agent. The external transaction<br>
queue 470 may control operation of the bus 430 via an external bus controller 480.<br>
Typically, a bus protocol will have been defined for the bus 430, the external transaction<br><br>
queue 470 and external bus controller 480 may generate and receive signals in<br>
accordance with such a protocol.<br>
[45]	In an alternate embodiment, the internal queue 450 and external transaction<br>
queue 470 may be replaced by a unitary queue. Accordingly, FIG. 5 illustrates the<br>
internal queue 460 and external transaction queue 473 as included in a single<br>
"transaction queue " The principles of the present invention find application with either<br>
embodiment. In this regard, the operation and structure of a BSQ 410 is well known.<br>
[46]	According to an embodiment, a validation FUB 490 may observe data requests<br>
posted within the BSQ 410 and generate harassing transactions in response thereto In<br>
one embodiment, the validation FUB 490 may capture data requests output by the arbiter<br>
440 The validation FUB 490 may compare data identifying the request type and source<br>
to determine whether to generate a new data request If so, Ihe new data request may be<br>
output to the arbiter 440 lor independent processing.<br>
[47]	In this embodiment, the BSQ 410 may process both the captured data request<br>
and the new data request as independent transactions The processing of two<br>
independent transactions directed to the same address may lead to certain performance<br>
boundary conditions within the BSQ 410 itself And, of course, evaluating the processor's<br>
performance in the event of the boundary conditions is one of the goals of stress testing.<br>
[48]	In another embodiment, shown in phantom, the validation FUB 490 also may<br>
monitor the hit/miss outputs of the internal cache 450. In such an embodiment, triggering<br>
conditions may be defined for the validation FUB 490 based not only upon the request<br>
type of a data request but also based on whether requested data is present in the internal<br>
cache 450<br>
[49]	As described above, a validation FUB 150 (FIG. 1) may generate a harassing bus<br>
transaction in response to a triggering bus transaction observed on the external bus 130<br>
(FIG 1). In an alternate embodiment, a validation FUB 150 may generate a harassing<br>
bus transaction in the absence of new transactions on the external bus 130. Many bus<br>
protocols identify the onset of a new transaction with a predetermined signal In the bus<br>
protocol of the Pentium Pro® processor, assertion of an ADS# signal indicates the onset<br>
of a new transaction. A new transaction may be posted on the bus during each bus clock<br>
cycle. In an embodiment, a validation FUB 150 may track the number of consecutive<br>
cycles that expire without a new transaction being posted on the external bus. If the<br><br><br>
number exceeds a predetermined threshold (e.g. 2), the validation FUB 150 may<br>
spontaneously generate a harassing transaction. The harassing transaction may be<br>
directed to an address last captured from an external bus transaction, perhaps having<br>
been modified (incremented or decremented).<br>
[50]	As noted, the validation FUB may be provided within an agent in a computer<br>
system. A validation FUB need be provided in only one of the agents in the system to be<br>
able to stress test the system. FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary computer system 500<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention The computer system 500 may<br>
include multiple agents 510-560 each coupled to a common communication bus 570. Of<br>
the agents, four are shown as processors 510-540. Other agents include a system<br>
memory 550 and an 10 interface 560. A validation FUB 515 is illustrated as being a<br>
member of one of the processors 510 but, alternatively, could be provided in one or more<br>
of the other agents 520-560.<br>
[51]	FIG. 7 illustrates another exemplary computer system 600 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention Again, multiple agents 610-630 are coupled to a<br>
common communication bus 640. In this example, only one agent 610 is shown as a<br>
processor. A memory controller 620 and 10 interface 630 also are shown in FIG 7. In<br>
this example, a validation FUB 625 is shown as a member of the memory controller.<br>
Alternatively, the validation FUB could be a member of the lO interface 630(not shown).<br>
[52]	Several embodiments of the present invention are specifically illustrated and<br>
described herein. However, it will be appreciated that modifications and variations of the<br>
present invention are covered by the above teachings and within the purview of the<br>
