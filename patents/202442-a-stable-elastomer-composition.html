Stabilizers and antiozonants for elastomers<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising an elastomer susceptible to oxidative, thermal, dynamic, or light- and/or ozone-induced degradation and, as stabilizer, at least one compound of the S-substituted 4-(3-mercapto/sulfinyl-2-hydroxypropyl-amino)diphenylamine type, and also to the use of the stabilizers to prevent contact discoloration of substrates coming into contact with elastomers, and as antiozonants for elastomers to prevent oxidative, thermal, dynamic, or light- and/or ozone-induced degradation, and also to a process for preventing contact discoloration of substrates coming into contact with elastomers, and to a process for stabilizing elastomers, which comprises incorporating into these, or applylng to these, at least one compound of the S-substituted 4-(3-mercapto/sulfinyl-2-hydroxypropylamino)diphenylaminetype.<br>
Rubber products (vulcanizates), like all polymers, are susceptible to oxidative, thermal, dynamic or light-induced degradation, A particular factor causing damage to diene rubber vulcanizates is ozone. Ozone attacks the carbon-C6rbon double bonds, of which many remain in the rubber (vulcanizate), and, via the mechanism known as ozonolysis, causes damage which is apparent as typical surface cracking, and failure of the rubber product. The damage is particularly serious when the rubber product is under dynamic stress.<br>
To prevent ozone damage, antioxidants selected from the class consisting of para-phenylenediamines [see RusselA. Mazzeo et al., "Tire Technology International" 1994, pp. 36 - 46; or Donald E. Miller et al.. Rubber World, 200 (5), 13-23 (1989)] are generally added to vulcanizates. These compounds have very good protective action, especially under dynamic conditions, but develop a strong intrinsic colour (discolouring) and, as a result of high migration rate, these compounds give severe contact discoloration (staining), i.e. the dye transfers to other substrates/products on direct contact. This means that the stabilizers employed in the prior art cannot be used as stabilizers for rubber products which are free from carbon black or are "non-black", and they are also unsuitable for (black) rubber products which comprise carbon black and are intended for use in direct contact with pale-coloured products.<br>
There continues, therefore, to be a need for colour-stable stabilizers which prevent ozone damage to rubber products, in particular to pale-coloured rubber products. There also<br><br>
continues to be a need for stabilizers which, although they may have an intrinsic colour, are unable, for example as a result of chemical bonding to the rubber chains, to transfer the colour to other products.<br>
The use of compounds of the 1-alkylthio-2-hydroxy-3-aminopropane type as stabilizers for lubricants, hydraulic fluids or metalworking fluids is known from U.S. 4,863,621, for example.<br>
It has now been found that compounds of the S-alkylated 4-(3-mercapto/sulfinyl-2-hydroxy-propylamino)diphenylamine type are particularly suitable as stabilizers for elastomers sus¬ceptible to oxidative, thermal, dynamic, or light- and/or ozone-induced degradation.<br>
The present invention therefore provides compositions comprising<br>
a)	a naturally occurring or synthetic elastomer susceptible to oxidative, thermal, dynamic, light-induced and/or ozone-induced degradation, and<br>

Compounds of the formula I may, for example, be prepared in a manner similar to that of Example 1 disclosed in U.S. 4,863,621, by reacting the epoxides of the formula II with the amines of the formula III<br><br>
The reaction takes place in the melt or in the presence of a suitable protic or aprotic solvent, such as xylene, ethanol or 2-propanol. The reaction preferably takes place in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g. salicylic acid or Fulcat22B, in amounts of from 0.05 to 10%, in particular 0.5 to 5%, based on the total weight of the compounds of the formulae II and III.<br><br>
The reaction is carried out at temperatures of from 100 to 220°C, for example, in particular at from 110 to 170°C, e.g. at from 120 to 150°C. During the reaction it is preferable for the compound of the formula II to be used in a molar excess over the compound of the formula III. A specifically preferred molar ratio of the compound of the formula II to the compound of the formula III is from 1.05 :1 to 1.5 :1.<br>
The compounds of the formula I in which m is 1 (sulfoxides) may be obtained by known methods, for example, from the compounds of the formula I in which m is 0 (thioethers), by oxidation. An example of a suitable and specifically preferred oxidant is hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Oxidation of the thioethers with an oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide, can also give sulfinyl compounds which, in the case where n=2, have been oxidized at only one sulfur. If the radical R' contains sulfur, oxidation of this sulfur is also possible, and mixtures of compounds can therefore be produced which have each been oxidized or not at the appropriate sulfur. All conceivable permutations are possible. These mixtures are likewise suitable as good stabilizers for elastomers, to prevent their oxidative, thermal, dynamic, or light- and/or ozone-induced degradation, and/or as stabilizers to prevent contact discoloration of substrates coming into contact with elastomers.<br>
The compounds of the formulae II and III are known from the literature and are in some cases commercially available.<br>
Component b) is suitable for stabilizing elastomers, in particular pale-coloured elastomers, to prevent oxidative, thermal, dynamic, or light- and/or ozone-induced degradation.<br>
Elastomers are to be understood as meaning macromolecular materials which after considerable deformation under a small load at room temperature rapidly regain approximately their original shape.

"Elastomers", pp. 388-393, 1997, VCH Veriagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany or "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, fifth, completely revised edition. Volume A 23", pp. 221-440 (1993).<br>

Particular preference is given to polydiene vulcanizates, halogen-containing polydiene vulcanizates, polydiene copolymer vulcanizates, in particular styrene-butadiene copolymer vulcanizates, and ethylene-propylene terpolymer vulcanizates.<br>
Component b) is usefully added to the elastomer to be stabilized in amounts of from 0.05 to 10%, for example from 0.1 to 5%, preferably from 0.5 to 3.0%, based on the weight of the elastomer to be stabilized.<br><br>

The examples below further illustrate the invention. Data in parts or percentages are based on weight.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of 4-{N-isopropyl-N-[3-(n-octylthio)-2-hydroxypropyl]amino}diphenyl-amine (compound 101, Table 1).<br>
A mixture of glycidyl n-octyl thioether (31.6 g) and 4-isopropylaminodiphenylamine [27.2 g. Vulkanox 4010 (RTM), Bayer] and salicylic acid (0.8 g) is stirred for 8 hours at 150°C. The reaction mixture is diluted with hexane and washed with saturated sodium carbonate solution and water. Concentration of the organic phase by evaporation followed by drylng at<br><br>
220'C/0.02 mbar gives 51.2 g (99.5%) of 4-{N-isopropyl-N-[3-(n-octylthio)-2-hyclroxypropyl]-amino}diphenylamine (compound 101, Table 1) as a viscous oil. Empirical formula C26H40N2OS (428.68). Analysis calculated: C 72.85; H 9.41; N 6.53; S 7.48%. Analysis found: C 71.94; H 9.63; N 5.87; S 7.86%. EI-MS: 428 (M*), 239 (M minus the radical octyl-SCH2CH(OH), base peak).<br>
In a manner similar to that of Example 1 and using glycidyl tert-nonyl thioether instead of glycidyl n-octyl thioether, 98% of 4-{N-isopropyl-N-[3-(tert-nonylthio)-2-hydroxypropyl]-amino}diphenylamine (compound 102, Table 1) is obtained as a viscous oil. Molecular weight C27H42N2OS (M 442.71). Analysis calculated: C 73.25; H 9.56; N 6.33; S7.24%. Analysis found: C 73.21; H 9.70; N 6.26; S 7.33%. EI-MS: 442 (M*), 239 (M minus tert-nonyl-SCH2CH(OH), base peak).<br>
Again, in a manner similar to that of Example 1 and using glycidyl n-dodecyl thioether, glycidyl tert-dodecyl thioether or glycidyl isooctyloxycarbonylmethyl thioether instead of glycidyl n-octyl thioether, compounds 103,104 and 111 (Table 1) are prepared.<br>
In a manner similar to that of Example 1 and using 4-(1,3-dimethylbutylamino)diphenylamine instead of 4-isopropylaminodiphenylamine, compound 107 (Table 1) is obtained. Additionally replacing glycidyl n-octyl thioether with glycidyl n-dodecyl thioether, glycidyl tert-dodecyl thioether or glycidyl tert-nonyl thioether gives compounds 105,106 and 108 (Table 1).<br>
In a manner similar to that of Example 1, the reaction of glycidyl n-dodecyl thioether with 4-(2-octylamino)diphenylamine gives compound 109 (Table 1). Again in a manner similar to that of Example 1, the reaction of glycidyl n-dodecyl thioether with 4-cyclohexylaminodiphe-nylamine gives compound 110 (Table 1).<br><br><br><br><br>
Example   2:   Preparation   of   4-{N-isopropyl-N-[3-(n-octylsulfinyl)-2-hyclroxypropyl]amino}-diphenylamine (compound 201, Table 2).<br>
4.53 g of 30% strength aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (H2O2) are added to a solution of 10 g of compound 101 (Example 1, Table 1) in 25 ml of acetone. The reaction mixture is stirred for 9 hours at 40°C. The reaction mixture is then treated with 100 ml of water and 50 ml of toluene. Most of the acetone is distilled off on a rotary evaporator under suction. The organic phase is separated off, washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated by evaporation on a rotary evaporator under suction. Chromatography of the residue on silica gel with hexane/ethyl acetate/ethanol (12:7:1) gives 7.14 g (69%) of 4-{N-isopropyl-N-[3-(n-octylsulfinyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]amino}dtphenylamine (compound 201, Table 2), brownish resin, molecular weight C26H40N2O2S (444.68). Analysis calculated: C 70.23; H 9.07; N 6.30; S 7.21%. Analysis found: C 70.04; H 9.04; N 6.42; S 7.05%. EI-MS: 444 (M*), 239 (M minus octyl-S(=0)CH2CH(OH), base peak).<br><br>
In a manner similar to that of Example 2 and using compound 102 (Example 1, Table 1), 62% of 4-{N-isopropyl-N-[3-(tert-nonylsulfinyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]amino}diphenylamine (com¬pound 202, Table 2) is obtained as a brownish resin. Molecular weight C27H42N2O2S (M 458.71). Analysis calculated: C 70.70; H 9.23; N 6.11; S 6.99%. Analysis found: C 70.84; H9.19; N6.05; S 7.35%. EI-MS: 458 (M*), 332 (M minus CgHia), 239 (M minus tert-no-<br><br><br>
Example 3: Preparation of 4,13-dithia-7,10-dioxa-1,16-bis[N-isopropyl-4-(phenylamino)-anili-no]-2,15-dihydroxyhexaclecane (compound 301).<br><br>
20.6 g (0.07 mol) of bisglycidyl thioether of 3,6-dioxa-1,8-octanedithiol are added dropwise over a period of 2 hours at 150°C to 22.6 g (0.10 mol) of 4-isopropylaminodiphenylamine [Vulkanox4010 (RTM), Bayer] and 0.28 g (2 mmol) of salicylic acid. The reaction mixture is then stirred for a further 6 hours at 150°C. The reaction mixture is cooled and chromato-graphed on silica gel using ethyl acetate/hexane (1:1). The pure fractions are combined, and the solvent is removed by evaporation on a rotary evaporator with suction. This gives 13.25 g (36%) of 4,13-dithia-7,10-dioxa-1,16-bis-[N-isopropyl-4-(phenylamino)anilino]-2,15-dihydroxyhexadecane (compound 301), viscous oil. Empirical formula C42H58N4O4S2 (747.08). Analysis calculated: C 67.52; H 7.83; N 7.50; S 8.58%. Analysis found: C 67.58; H 7.78; N 7.21; S 7.93%. El-MS: 746 (M*), 239 (C6H5NHC6H4N(C3H7)CH2 base peak).<br><br><br>
17.5 g (0.07 mol) of bisglycidyl thioether of 3-oxa-1,5-pentanedithiol are added dropwise over a period of 2 hours at 150°C to 22.6 g (0.10 mol) of 4-isopropylaminodiphenylamine [Vulkanox 4010 (RTM), Bayer] and 0.28 g (2 mmol) of salicylic acid. The reaction mixture is then stirred for a further 6 hours at 150°C. The reaction mixture is cooled and chromato-graphed on silica gel using ethyl acetate/hexane (1:1). The pure fractions are combined, and the solvent is removed by evaporation on a rotary evaporator with suction. This gives 37.0 g (92%) of compound 302, viscous oil. EI-MS: 702 (M*), 239 (C6H5NHC6H4N(C3H7)CH2*; base peak).<br>
Example 5: Preparation of compound 303.<br>
28.1 g (0.13 mol) of glycidyl tert-nonyl thioether are added dropwise over a period of 2 hours at 150°C to 9.2 g (0.05 mol) of 4-aminodiphenylamine and 0.14 g (1 mmol) of salicylic acid. The reaction mixture is then stirred for a further 2 days at 150°C. The reaction mixture is cooled and chromatographed on silica gel using ethyl acetate/hexane (1:3). The pure frac¬tions are combined, and the solvent is removed by evaporation on a rotary evaporator with suction. This gives 6.1 g (16.5%) of compound 303, viscous oil. Empirical formula C48H84N2O3S3 (833.40). Analysis calculated: C 69.23; H 10.09; N 3.36; S 11.53%. Analysis found: C 68.83; H 10.09; N 3.54; S 11.68%. C1-MS: 833 (M*), 127 (C9H19*; base peak).<br><br>
Example 6: Stabilization of black vulcanizate.<br>
40.0 parts by weight of Cariflex® 1220 [polybutadiene, SHELL] are processed on mixing rolls at 60°C with 60.0 parts by weight of natural rubber and 55.0 parts by weight of carbon black (N 330), 6.0 parts by weight of Ingralen 450 (RTM) [extender oil], 5.0 parts by weight of zinc oxide [vulcanization activator], 2.0 parts by weight of stearic acid [vulcanization activator], 0.2 parts    by    weight    of    IRGANOX1520    (RTM)    [processing    stabilizer,    Ciba<br><br>
Spezialitatenchemie], 2.0 parts by weight of sulfur [vulcanizer], 0.6 part by weight of Vulkacit MOZ (RTM) [vulcanization accelerator, BAYER] and 2.0 parts by weight of the stabilizer to be tested in accordance with Table 3, to give a homogeneous mixture, the vulcanization system [sulfur and Vulkacit MOZ (RTM)] not being added until the end of the mixing process. The mixture is vulcanized in electrical heating presses at 150°C to T95 on the rheometer curves, to give elastomer sheets of 2 mm thickness, 21 cm length and 8.0 cm width. Sections of the 2 mm rubber sheets are placed on a white cardboard underlay and stored in a circulating-air cabinet at 50°C for 5 days. The contact surface or its margin is then evaluated visually for contact discoloration (staining): 0 = no discoloration (or the discoloration of the reference in which no AO is present) and 5 = greatest degree of discoloration. The slighter the contact discoloration, the better the stabilization. The results are given in Table 3.<br><br><br>
