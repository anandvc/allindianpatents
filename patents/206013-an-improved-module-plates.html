COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
	(See Section 10, Rule 13)<br><br><br><br>
AN IMPROVED MODULE PLATES<br>
HANOJ HANSRAJ GADA of 8-36, MANJU NIKETAN, TOPIWALA COMPOUND, GOREGAON (W), MUMBAI - 400 062, MAHARASHTRA, India , INDIAN national<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
1 1 APR 2002            22 -3 2005     Granted<br><br>
The invention relates to an improved module plate for fixing electrical /electronic switch member without any fixing screw. The module plate is made from molded plastic material preferably square or rectangular in shape which is used as a switch board or panel for fixing screw less electrical or electronic switches.<br>
The conventional system of fixing switches on the board or panel which are required to be fixed with the wall by fixing a box member on which the panels or the switch board is screwed for fixing. Therefore the metal switches which are difficult to replace due to the rust forming on the metal body therfore replacing switches are often difficult.<br>
The inventor has deviced an improved module plate to obviate the above drawbacks by introducing a plastic module plate of box type construction having inwardly projections which will make interlocking engagement with the groove provided in the switch body thereby providing a switch member fitted on the module plate without any screwing. Thereby the switches which are releasibly attached with the module plate can be replaced easily.<br>
Accordingly there is provided an Improved Module Plate (a) made from molded plastic material of box type construction having inwardly directed projection (b, c, d, e) which will interlock with the grooves provided in the switch member thereby providing mounting of switch member on the module plate without any metal screw. The curvature of the top surface of the switch member having tapering at the edges which are coated enamals with different colours and designs.<br><br>
The invention further relates to electrical/electronic switch members without any fixing screw which are pushed fit on the module member from the front side. The projection provided in the module member locked inside the grooves provided on top and bottom of the bottom parts of the switch members. The bottom member of the switch is preferably of rectangular box type construction open at top provided with a rectangular flap top members/knob having a inner projected central grooves through which stainless steel spring loaded plunger operating on a rocker lever pivoted on "V" shaped lever works as a operating member for on or off a switch. The top member having grooves on either side on the flunges is snapped fit on the bottom member on matching projections provided at its sides. The metal rocker member having a rounded bimetal contact with a layer of silver cadium oxide makes the contact with the pillar bimetal contact rigidlly attached to the one of the silverised terminals.<br>
In the prior art systems the electrical switch are required to be fixed on a panal by means of metal screws which is visible and dangerous for human beings for the risks of shocks and their prone to moisture in case of humid climate thereby require frequent replacement which is labourious and costly. The asthetic look is also not very good.<br>
The principal object of this invention is therefore to provide an electrical/electronic switch member without any fastening screws which overcome the above drawbacks.<br><br><br>
The another object of this invention is to provide electrical/electronic switch member for installation which is cost effective, easy to manufacture and users friendly.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide electrical/electronic switch member for installation which can be used with different coloured and designed flap members for good asthetic look with mono and multi colour combination.<br>
The said switch member is provided electrical/electronic switch comprising a decorative/multi coloured switch member made from plastic moulding material comprising a bottom member of box type construction open at top and a top rectangular flap members which is a operating member having a spring loaded nylon plunger at the middle projecting from inside of the top member and housed in a moulded channel which impages on the rocker member "V" shaped metal piece pivoted on a metal piece to make and break contact with pillar contact rigidlly fasten to one of the terminals thereby making and breaking the contacts. The top member having grooves on either side on the flunges is snapped fit on the bottom member on matching projections provided at its sides. The metal rocker member having a rounded bimetal contact with a layer of silver cadium oxide makes the contact with the pillar bimetal contact rigidlly attached to the one of the silverised terminals. Referring to figure 1 to 3, of an improved module plate consisting of :<br>
Fig. 1 is a top view of the module plates. Fig. 2 is the sectional elevation of the module plate. Fig. 3 is a sectional side view of the module plate.<br><br>
A Module Plate made from plastic material of preferably rectangular shaped having projection at the back is used to house the electrical switch having matching grooves at its back which when pressed from the top will lock by the projection inter locking with the groove member of the switches thereby making a screwless electrical installation which avoids accidental shock and frequent replanishment due to the rustless installation.<br>
One of the embodiment it has been shown a rectangular construction by any type of shaped and size possible or any type of colour combination, mono colour or multi colour which are within the ambid of this invention.<br>
The invention will now describe with reference to figure 1 to 3 in the accompanying specification.<br>
Fig. 1 is a elevation view of the electrical/electronic switch member for installation.<br>
Fig. 2 is the top view fo the electrical/electronic switch member for installation.<br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view of the electrical/electronic switch member for installation.<br>
Fig. 4 is a exploded view of the components serially in unassembelled condition.<br>
Referring to figure 1 to 3 an electrical/electronic switch without any fastening screw member as claimed in claim (1) wherein, said switch comprises mainly a rectangular bottom member (3) with box type<br><br>
construction open at top (4) and a top rectangular flap members/knob as operating member (2) having a plunger inside the top member (5) which is spring loaded (6) the top member is engaged with a bottom member by groove (13, 14) and projection (15), (16) inter locking means; a rocker pin (8) , "V" shaped metal piece pivoted on "V" shaped metal stand (10) which is rigidly secured with silverised terminal (12) ; a round bimetal contact (9) provided at one end of rocker pin makes contact with metal pillar (11) to make and break the contact due to the on and off of the switch knob (2) ; the said metal pillar (11) is connected to the terminal (12).<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described in the accompanying specification.<br><br>
