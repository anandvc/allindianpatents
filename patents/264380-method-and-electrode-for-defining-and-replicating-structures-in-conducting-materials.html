 The present invention relates to a method for creating structures.<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a new etching or plating method for simplifying production of applications involving micro and nano structures by  using a special electrode, according to the appended claims.<br>
The present invention is closely related to electrochemical etching, plating, photolithography and pattern replication and is within the micro- and nanotechnic area.<br>
The method is particularly useful for fabrication of PWB (printed wiring boards), PCB (printed circuit boards), MEMS (micro'electro mechanical systems), sensors, flat panel display, magnetic and optical storage devices. Integrated circuits, different types of structures in conductive polymers, structures in semiconductors, structures in metals, and others are possible to produce using this method. Even 3D-structuree in silicon, by using formation of porous silicon, are possible.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The ever-increasing demand for smaller, faster and less expensive microelectronic and micro-electromechanical systems requires corresponding development of- efficient-and suitable manufacturing techniques.<br>
Either additive or subtractive techniques are used in the fabrication of micro- and/or nano-structures on a surface. One general subtractive technique is etching and one general additive technique ia plating.<br>
The etching methods are usually divided into two subgroups, dry- and wet etching. In general, dry etching is .<br><br>
used for eubmicron structures and/or where straight sidewalls are important. Wet etching is used for large structures where some undercutting is acceptable or sometimes desirable. The wet etching techniques can be divided into chemical- and electrochemical etching.<br>
The advantages of dry etching compared with wet etching is that anisotropic etched profiles can be generated in both crystalline and polycrystalline/amorphous material. Some of the disadvantages of dry etching are high equipment costs, lack of selectivity, problems with re-deposition on the sample, environmentally hazardous chemicals, surface damages on the etched sample and safety and disposal problems.<br>
The advantages of wet etching are that it is a simple and inexpensive process. One of the disadvantages is that it does not involve any directional driving force and therefore the etching rate is the same in all directions, which results in an iaotropic etched profile. Some other disadvantages are that wet etching baths generally contains aggressive and toxic chemicals, which gives safety and disposal problems. In many wet etching processes waste treatment and disposal costs often surpasses actual etching costs, the same applies for dry etching.<br>
Detailed descriptions regarding the above mentioned etching processes are considered known by a man skilled in the art and will not be presented in this paper. Because of the close relationship between the etching method according to the present invention and the electrochemical etching some details regarding the later will be presented as follows.<br>
Electrochemical etching is an etching method, which is used to get an anisotropic etched profile from simple inexpensive wet etching processing. In electrochemical etching an external electrical potential is applied between an etched sample and a counter electrode, all immersed in a<br><br>
liquid etchant. An electrochemical cell with, the working electrode, the sample, aa anode and the counter electrode as cathode are formed, as shown in figure 1. An external potential is applied to drive the oxidation process at the working electrode. The corresponding reduction at the cathode is usually hydrogen gas formation. As electrolyte, and etchant, neutral salt solutions or very diluted mixtures of conventional etchant can be used. The applied potential and the electric field from it give a directional etching in the vertical direction.<br>
One problem the designers of electrochemical etching cells are facing is that, to reduce the resistive losses from charge transfer in the electrolyte, one wants a small electrode distance. A small distance, which makes just a tiny unevenness in the electrode, give rise to a relatively big Ad that, gives a non-uniform current density distribution. The result is that some parts of the sample are over-etched while some parts are not etched to the desired depth. No mechanical support is possible to keep the electrode in. position over the whole surface, since no contact between sample and counter electrode is allowed. Another problem in electrochemical etching is non-uniformed current density distribution arising from accumulated currents from non-etched areas, due to the fact that all parts of the counter electrode is in contact with the electrolyte, not only the desired areas above the etched parts.<br>
The second option, additive techniques, for pattern transfer is to add material in the structure formed on top of the substrate by the pattern-defining step. Electro-deposition, physical vapour deposition and chemical vapour deposition are examples of additive processes.<br>
When the purpose of etching ie to provide a structure in the etching material by etching away selected parts thereof, the etching material which is not to be etched<br><br>
away is usually coated with an etching preventing layer, a so called mask or resist. The primary technique to define patterns to be etched is photolithography and a common etching preventing layer ia a photo-resiat. The photoresist is exposed by electromagnetic radiation and developed to transfer the pattern where etching is wanted. Every sample that is etched has to be coated with resist, pre-baked, exposed, developed and hard-baked before the etching process can start.<br>
Most of today's micro-devices are built up by a large number of functional layers and each layer has to be patterned and aligned in a photolithography process followed by a pattern transfer process. Pig 6 shows a conventional etching process with the lithography process. The complicated nature of the pattern defining lithography process and the large number of lithography steps needed to fabricate a micro-device makes it to a major time and cost carrier in the total manufacturing chain.<br>
From the European patent publication EP 1060299 it is known to use a method of making, by etching, depressions in selected portions of an etching surface by using an electrode with electrically conductive electrode portions in selected portions of an electrode surface, where the electrode portions is forming an electrode pattern which corresponds to the etching pattern.  The method is different compared to the present invention by using electromagnetic radiation to dissolve a passivating layer, which is formed on the etching material. During etching the electrode is placed at a distance from the electrically conductive etching material, which also differs from the present invention. The electrodes according to EP 1060295 has to be transparent to electromagnetic radiation and they do not compensate for unevennesa in the micro/nano areas<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
One object of the present invention is to simplify production of applications involving micro and nano structures where an etching or plating pattern, which is defined by a conductive electrode, a master electrode, is replicated on an electrically conductive material, a substrate.<br>
This object is met by a special contact<br>
electrochemical etching/plating method that is called the electrochemical pattern replication method. To simplify the description of the electrochemical pattern replication method according to the present invention it ±e stated as the ECPR method further in this description. This method is based on a structured electrode and an electrochemical etching/plating method.<br>
The master electrode and the substrate are put in close contact, where local etching/plating cells are formed in the open or closed cavities between the master electrode and the substrate. Some of the advantages of the ECPR method is that it enables a high and well controlled aniaotropic etch profile, etch rate and surface finishing and uniformity, a possibility of accurate process control, minimised undercut, environmentally friendly process (since electrolytic or very diluted etchants is used) and low costs.<br>
Another object is to design the master electrode, which is used in the ECPR method.<br>
This object is met by integrating a counter electrode and pattern defining structures of an electrochemical etching/plating cell into one device, the master electrode. This master electrode will operate both as counter electrode and pattern master in the etching/plating cell used in the ECPR method. The substrate, the sample on which the pattern is to be etched or plated on, operates as a<br><br>
working electrode in the etching/plating cell used, in the EC?R method.<br>
By using this master electrode combined with the ECPR method, several replicas can be produced in conducting materials by electrochemical material removal or addition in areas defined by the master electrode.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the present invention will be obvious to a person skilled in the art from reading the detailed description below of preferred embodiments.<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments A master electrode 8 of the present invention operates both as a counter electrode 1 and a pattern defining master and a substrate 9 operates as a working electrode 2 in an etching/plating cell, which is shown in fig.3, used in the ECPR process, according to the present invention.<br>
Further on in the description will only etching process be mentioned but it should be obvious to a man skill in the art that it also concerns the plating process.<br>
Master electrode construction<br>
The purpose of the master electrode 8 is to provide electrical connection to all local etching cells 12 formed when compressing the master electrode 8 and the substrate 9 and, at the same time, to provide electrical insulation to<br><br>
the areas where electrochemical action is undesired, i.e. at the contact areas between an insulating pattern layer 3 and the substrate 9. To enable a well-defined pattern transfer, even for relatively rough substrate surfaces, a conformable behaviour is needed. This is satisfied by a compressible elastomer layer 20, 21 within the master electrode construction.<br>
The insulating pattern layer 3 ia fabricated by using an electrically insulating material that is chemically inert in the electrolytes that is used, enables high aspect ratio structures and is easily patterned using i.e. UV, X-ray, electron beam, laser or etching/plating combined with an insulating process. Examples of insulating materials to be used are polyimide, SU-8, SC 100, MRL 6000, ED-resist and Teflon materials. In another embodiment the insulating portions are made by anodising a. conducting material, e.g. a metal.<br>
The counter electrode 1 is a conducting electrode layer l1 . The conducting electrode layer could be a flexible conducting foil 1' ' , a solid metal sheet or a thin conducting layer on a mechanical support layer23. When the conducting electrode layers 1', 1' are deposited on a mechanical support layer23 or an elastomer layer 21 with a very high surface uniformity, the two features planarity and high surface uniformity are combined. Crucial material characteristics for the conducting electrode layer 11, 111 are high conductivity, chemically inertnees in the electrolytes used, good seed layers for electrochemical material deposition and suitable methods for depositing or in other ways incorporating the layer into the integrated master electrode construction. Examples of conducting electrode layer 1', 1'1 materials used are stainless steel, platinum, palladium, titanium, gold, graphite, chromium, aluminium and nickel.<br><br>
The master electrode is manufactured by using a conventional microfabrication method, which is described in figure 5. The different embodiments of master electrodes used for ECPR processing are described in figures lOa-lOh. All different electrode layer 11, 1' embodiments can be combined with all different combinations of insulating pattern layer 3, flexible elastomer layer 20, 21, mechanical support layer23 and intermediate metal layers 22. All these configurations can be used for both an open cavity concept and a closed cavity concept. These concepts will be explained further on in the document.<br>
Master electrodes for the open cavity configuration may be fabricated using the method described below.<br>
The master electrode used for open cavity configuration is fabricated in two major steps. In the first step the counter electrode layer 1 is shaped and prepared to meet the different requirements stipulated as crucial for successful ECPR processing. After meeting these requirements an insulating pattern layer 3 is deposited and patterned on the counter electrode layer 1.<br>
In the preferred embodiment titanium has been chosen as a master electrode material since it is inert in the electrolytes being used. Furthermore, anodiaing can form a dense insulating outer layer of Ti02 at the contact areas. It ia possible to use other materials as well, which has been mentioned before.<br>
Since the master electrode B is in contact with the working electrode 2, some parts of the master electrode have to be made of an insulating material, an insulating pattern layer 3 on the contact side, the master side 11. The insulating pattern layer 3 prevents the areas where etching is undesired from etchant contact.<br>
All the manufacturing steps of the master electrode 8 is carried out with conventional microfabrication processes, known from prior art and shown in figure 6.<br><br>
Accordingly, the roaster electrode 8 will be fabricated out of two titanium foil layers 16, as stated before, which is shown in figures 2 a to 2e, with a sacrificial photo-resist layer 17 in between, to form gas/electrolyte transport channels. An example of how the fabrication of this master electrode could be performed ia as follows:<br>
1.	The starting material, the sample in figure 6, is<br>
a 4 µm Ti-foil layer 16. A 1 µm sacrificial photo<br>
resist layer 17 is electrochemical deposited, as<br>
shown in fig 2a. To form fluidic channels, the<br>
resist forms square with 4µm width, separated<br>
with 1 µm resist lines, as shown in fig. 2b, A<br>
second Ti-foil layer 16, 3 µm, is deposited on top<br>
of the sacrificial resist layer 17, as shown in<br>
fig. 2c.<br>
2.	Both long sides of the "sandwich", which are shown<br>
in fig. 2c, are coated with ED-reeist 18, as shown<br>
in fig. 2d. The master side 11 is patterned with<br>
desired master pattern and the outer side 10 is<br>
patterned with 1 um holes, according to the<br>
pattern definition process shown in fig 6.<br>
3.	Double-aided electrochemical etching is performed,<br>
according to the pattern transferring process<br>
shown in figure 6. The outer side 10 is etched to<br>
the sacrificial resist layer and the master side<br>
11 is etched to a depth of 3 µm, saving 1 µm for<br>
gaa traps. A new layer of ED resist is deposited.<br>
The contact areas are exposed and developed. The<br>
contact areas are anodised and isolating Ti02 is<br>
formed, as shown in fig. 2e.<br>
4.	The photo-resist is stripped thoroughly in<br>
alkaline solution to dissolve outer layers and<br>
sacrificial layer, as shown in fig. 2f.<br><br>
All fabrication steps for the outer side 10 of the master electrode 8 are standardised and do not depend on what kind of master structure that is used, Universal standard masks can be used. Only the masks for the master-side 11 have to be selected for every specific master structure. The master electrode is ready to be mounted in an etching cell.<br>
The fabrication of a closed cavity master electrode may be performed in the same way as the above described fabrication process of the open cavity master electrode except for the sacrificial resist layer. Several combinations of material are shown' in fig lOa to lOh.<br>
A very important part of the BCPR process is to use a suitable insulating layer. One of many benefits of the process is that it would no longer be needed to apply a resist on each sample but instead the resist would be out on a reusable master. For this to be a benefit it of course requires that the resist withstand several process cycles. Besides that, the resist also governs how small structures that can be made, what volume electrolyte to sample depth ratio one can have and also, how easy it would be to keep all structures in contact with the sample. Electro-deposited photo-resist, ED resist, which is often used for lithography processes, is suitable for these etching processes and it can be deposited with very precise thickness control.<br>
The embodiments of the master electrode according to the present invention are in no way limited to the example cons tract ions showed neither in figure 2a-2i, lOa-lOh nor to the materials listed as suitable in the description above .<br>
An electrical conductive material durable to electrochemical stresses , e.g. copper, may be used as substrate material.<br><br>
Electrolyte<br>
The electrolyte composition is crucial in controlling an electrochemical process and its different features. Conductivity, ion mobility, ionic atmosphere, relaxation, migration, diffusion and transport numbers are important concepts -<br>
When an electrolytic etchant is used there is no or less chemical etching and the negative influences will be negligible on the replicated structures. The existence of chemical etching depends on if there is a chemical oxidation agent in the electrolyte solution.<br>
On important issue that the electrolyte has to take care of is to optimise a mass-transport of electro-active ions in'electrochemical cells, which has to occur to achieve an optimised ECPR-process. The optimisation of the electrolyte to cause an optimised mass-transport is described after the description of the ECPR-proceas.<br>
Reducing components, e.g. metal ions, could be added to the electrolyte solution if one wants to prevent deposition of substrate material and to cause the etch process to stop in a natural way. When reducing components are added the reduction process will take place in the electrolyte and there will be a natural ending of the etching process when there is a balance between the reduction components and the deposited components.<br>
ECPR process<br>
The substrate 9 and the master electrode 3 are put together in close contact and form an etching cell, as shown in fig. 4a.<br>
They will be mounted in an apparatus where the ECPR process will take place. This apparatus will be described in more details below. One of its main issues is to keep the electrodes in exact place once they are put in contact and to supply with a conformable contact.<br><br>
The insulating pattern layer 3 defines the distance between the counter electrode 1 part of the master electrode and the substrate 9. Thanks to the fact that the distance is short and precise all over the surface it solves the problems with non-uniform current density distribution and non-etched areas. It also minimises the resistive losses from charge transfer in the electrolyte. The structure will be replicated on the substrate 9 because the field and motion of the ions in the etching/plating solution is controlled in vertical direction by the master electrode 8.<br>
Since the master electrode 8 and the substrate 9 are in close contact, closed or open cavities, local etching cells 12, is provided between the electrode surfaces. If the cavities are open or closed depends on how master electrode 8, that is used, is constructed, with or without sacrificial resist layer 17. The cavities are considered to be closed further in. the document. These, very small and well-controlled, spaces between the electrodes admits an effective etching with high precision. Every local etching cell 12 has a surface on the mast-er electrode 8, which corresponds to a surface on the substrate 9 which should be etched away and thereby avoiding the problems with fluctuating current density distribution in the vicinity of large insulating areas with adjacent small structures.<br>
According to the invention, an ECPR method for etching selected parts of a surface defined by the master electrode, which was described above, has thus been provided.<br>
Figures 3, 4a and 4b show the different steps in the ECPR etching process, according to the present invention. The steps are as follows:<br>
1. Th.e master electrode 8 and the substrate 9, is immersed into an electrolyte solution 6, which will be described later, as shown in fig. 3.<br><br>
2. They are compressed and an etching cell with local etching cells 12, filled with electrolyte solution 6, is formed. This is shown in figure 4a. It is also possible to apply the electrolyte solution as a very thin layer of liquid on one of the surfaces before the electrodes are compressed, to dip the surfaces into the electrolyte solution before the compress procedure, or to supply the electrolyte solution to the etching cell, after compressing the electrodes, through a porous material or through the layer on the outer side 10 in the master electrode 8. 3. An external pulsed voltage with or without<br>
additional ultrasound is applied over the etching cell, where the substrate 9 becomes the anode and the master electrode 8 becomes the cathode. '4. Figure 4b shows how the pattern 3, which is<br>
defined by the master electrode 8, is replicated on the substrate 9. The material that has been etched away has been deposited on the master electrode 8, a deposit material 13.<br>
5. Since some of the substrate material is deposited in the structure on the master electrode B it will eventually be filled with substrate material, deposit material 13, and therefore it is essential to have an easy way to clean the master electrode. After a number of etching cycle a cleaning process is normally performed. The deposit material 13 is etched away from the master electrode 6.<br>
Figure 5a and 5b shows the different steps in the ECPR plating process, according to the present invention-The plating process is almost the same as the etching process except following steps:<br><br>
1.	Before the electrodes 8, 9 are compressed and<br>
immersed into electrolyte solution, plating<br>
material 15 has been deposited on the maater<br>
electrode 8 in the cavities, which are defined by<br>
the insulating pattern layer 3. When, a certain<br>
height of the plating structure has been reached<br>
will the apace, the local plating cells 14 between<br>
the master electrode 8 and the substrate 9, be<br>
filled with electrolyte solution 6, as shown in<br>
fig 5a.<br>
2.	The pattern, which is defined by the master<br>
electrode 8, replicates on the substrate 9 when<br>
the external pulsed voltage is applied over the<br>
plating cell 14, where the master electrode 8<br>
becomes the anode and the substrate 9 becomes the<br>
cathode. The plating material 15, which was<br>
deposited on the master electrode 8, has been<br>
plated on the substrate 9, as shown in figure 5b.<br>
Since all plating material, which can be plated on<br>
the substrate, haa, from the beginning, been<br>
deposited on the master structure, can the amount<br>
of plating material, which is plated on the<br>
substrate, be controlled with high precision.<br>
An optimised mass-transport of electro-active ions in these cells has to occur to achieve an optimised ECPR-procesa. The mass-transfer, with movement of material from one location in solution to another, arises from differences in electrical or chemical potential at two locations, or from movement of a volume element of solution. There are three modes of mass-transfer, migration,' diffusion and convection. For thin-layer electrochemical cells, as is in this case, there is a much larger A/V ration than for regular macroscopic cells. The<br><br>
high A/V ratio implies large frictional forces per unit volume, making all electrolyte volumes to stagnant layers. This means no forced convective mass transfer, except when using ultrasound, leaving only the diffusion and migration mechanisms to exert the material transport. This concerns the closed cavity master electrode. In the open cavity master electrode there is a micro-convection because of the sacrificial resist layer, where the channels in the layer allow a micro-convection mechanism.<br>
Following actions is made to optimise the mass-transport ;<br>
1. Electrolyte solution<br>
The parameters that were adjusted in the solution were the pH-value and the electro-active species/supporting electrolyte ratio.<br>
In one embodiment was acid copper electrolyte used as electrolyte solution. The pH-value was changed by adding either H2S04 or diluted NaOH. Several experiments were made to establish which pH-value was the best. It was settled, in. this embodiment, that a pH-value of 2 to 5 was satisfying.<br>
No or less supporting electrolyte in combination with a higher concentration of electro-active species, compared to standard electrolytes, also improves the mass-transport. A concentration of electro-active species of 10 to 1200 mM is preferred.<br>
The ECPR process involves both electrochemical etching and electro-deposition at the same time. Electro-deposition is the reversed electrochemical etching process, where ions from the electrolyte is reduced and deposited on the cathode. The same conditions apply and the same parameters control the two processes. There is a tendency to obtain a higher deposition rate at the top of a cavity, than at the bottom, when the high aspect ration structures<br><br>
are to be filled. This might result in voids, affecting the mechanical and electrical properties of the microstructure in a negative way. The geometry of the electrochemical cell and the use of additives are a solution to enable "bottom-up-filling" without any voids. Additives are added to give a sufficient electro-deposition. Additives is something that is often used in plating processes to make the plating even. It contains several active components but predominantly it prevents the forming of pillars by being attracted to and covered high current density areas as soon as the pillars start forming. This turned out to be the key to the problem and as soon as it was used a clean and solid substrate material was formed on the cathode. Several commercial systems have been tested with satisfactory results. Coveted additives are wetting agents, which lowers the surface tension, accelerators, which are molecules that locally increases current density where they absorb, suppressors, which are polymers which tend to form current-suppressing film on the entire substrate surface (could sometimes use chloride as co-suppressor) and levelers, which are current suppressing molecules with mass transfer dependent distribution.<br>
To avoid a far to high concentration of electro-active species at the anode, which give a local saturated compound and deposition of solid salt, the counter-ions are exchanged to ones, which provide a higher solubility product. Further, a sequestering agent could be added, e.g. EDTA, to dissolve more metal ions without causing any further precipitation.<br>
2. Voltage<br>
Pulsed-voltage was chosen because it enhances mass transfer and disturbs the formation of blocking layers at the electrode-solution interface. Tests were made to determine what kind of frequencies, duty cycles and potentials to use. Both periodic pulse reverse voltage<br><br>
 (PPR) and complex waveforms have been used with success. Frequencies of 2 to 20 kHz have been tested with satisfactory results but also higher frequencies are possible. In the described embodiment the frequency of 5 kHz is preferred. The potential is from 0 to 10 V.<br>
3. Ultrasound<br>
Ultrasound is sometimes used together with pulsed voltage to enhance the mass-transport by micro-convection.<br>
A machine solution to exert the actions described in this document is a crucial part of the invention. The purpose of the machine ia to compress the two electrode surfaces, the master electrode and the substrate, to create the micro/nano cavities where the local electrochemical cells are formed. To enable conformable surfaces in both micro/nano- and macro scale, flexible layers in the machine, for macro scale conformable behaviour and plane parallelism, are combined with flexible layers within the master electrode, which enables micro- and nano scale conformable behaviour. In this way both bent and dented substrates with a rather high surface roughness can be used for ECPR processing.<br>
Before compressing the electrodes 8, 9 to create the local etching cells 12, all gas has to be evacuated from the solution and from the solid/liquid interface between the master electrode B/electrolyte 6 and electrolyte 6/the substrate 9. In one embodiment this is done using a vacuum system and in another using ultrasound. The two gas bubble elimination methods can also be combined. Evacuated gas and electrolyte has been taken care of by a buffer volume connected between a reaction chamber and a vacuum system.<br>
To enable the ECPR process, both master electrode 8 and substrate 9 has to be electrically contacted in the same machine solution. This has been done with outer side 10 contacting on the master electrode 8 and front side, the<br><br>
contacting side, contacting on the substrate 9. The invention is in no way depending on this configuration.<br>
There are two main machine embodiments to perform the desired actions for ECPR processing.<br>
The first embodiment, which is shown in figure 8, is based on a membrane solution where a pressurised membrane 24 is expanded against the master electrode 8 or the substrate 9. The medium 19 inside the pressure volume can be both gas and liquid. Gas bubbles are eliminated by a combination of ultrasound and vacuum, or just using ultrasound. In this embodiment electrical contact to the master electrode 8 is provided from the outer side ID, i.e. from the membrane 24 and contact to the substrate 9 from the front side. Plane parallelism is ensured by the nature of the expanding membrane, applying an even pressure in a conformable way. Both flexible and rigid master electrodes and substrates can be used in this embodiment.<br>
The second embodiment is based on a cylinder, which is shown in figure 9, containing a moveable piaton, not shown in the figure. The entire system ie confined. Pressure is applied to compress the two electrodes 8,9 pneumatically using a combination of vacuum and overpressure or hydraulically using a hydraulic piston or mechanically using a screw. Gas bubbles are eliminated by a combination of ultrasound and vacuum. In this embodiment electrical contact 26 to the master electrode is provided from the outer side 10 and contact to the substrate 25 from the front side using conducting movable rods. Plane parallelism is ensured by two flexible elastomer layers between the sample and the piston, one being more compressible than the other is. These elastomer layers can also be placed behind the master electrode 8, i.e. between master electrode and cylinder wall. Both flexible and rigid master electrodes and substrates can be used in this embodiment.<br><br>
