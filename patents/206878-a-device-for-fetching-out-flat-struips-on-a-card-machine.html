Drive unit in a card with revolving flat and a flat brush	<br><br><br>
The invention pertains to a drive unit in a card with a revolving flat and &amp; flat, brush, in which the driven, rotating flat brush (cleaning device) is allocated to the flat rods of the revolving flat   rotating endlessly around two flat guide pulleys.<br>
In a known drive unit, both drives, the drive of the one flat guide pulley and the drive of the flat brush are drawn off by the motor-driven drive for the drum over flat belts. For this, a special gear is available, which has two worm drives, a bevel gear drive and a cogged belt drive with several guide pulleys. This leads to the fact that, for each service the cogged belt drive has to be released and again tensioned. Besides, the unit is also very cumbersome.<br>
It is therefore the task of this invention to produce a drive unit of the type already described above, which avoids the mentioned disadvantages, which is design-wise particularly simple and allows simplified service jobs.<br><br>
This task is fulfilled with the help of the highlighted features of the invention.<br>
Through the measure as per the invention, a significant design simplificationisattained. Especially, the cogged belt drive with several guide pulleys is no longer required. Thereby, the device is also production-technically and, from the point of view of assembly, significantly less cumbersome. A further advantage lies in the fact, that for each service the cogged belt no longer has to be released and again tensioned to a pregiven precise value. Apart from these simplifications, there is a significant reduction in service time and hence increase in production time.<br>
Ideally, the gear can be axially rotated around the axis of the flat guide pulley. The gear is preferably a push-on gear   It is advantageous that the revolving flat circulates slowly. The revolving flat should preferably circulate at a speed of approx. 200 mm/min. The flat brush<br><br>
2<br>
also ideally circulates slowly. The flat brush should preferably circulate at a speed of approx 4 to 8 per minute. A drive motor is allocated to the inlet of the gear. The gear is arranged in a housing. The housing is ideally rotatable around the axis of the flat guide pulley. Preferably, the housing of the flat cleaning device and the bracket (drive housing of the revolving flat) are combined into one housing.<br>
The invention is explained in more details below on the basis of drawn design examples.<br>
The following are shown:<br>

guide pulley (flat drive); Fig. 5   Side view of a combined housing for the flat cleaning device and the bracket<br>
(drive housing of the revolving flat); Fig. 6a The device as per the invention with gear, in which the flat brush is fixed and<br>
the drive belt with the flat rods are movable back and forth in gripped-in<br>
position;<br>
Fig.6b The device as shown in fig. 6a outside gripped-in position; Fig. 7a The device as per the invention, in which the flat brush is movable to the drive<br>
belt with the flat rods back and forth in gripped-in position; and Fig. 7b The device as shown in fig. 7a outside gripped-in position.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a card, e.g. Trutzschler EXACTACARD DK 803, with feed roller 1, feed table 2, lickers 3a, 3b, 3c, drum 4, doffing cylinder 5, stripping roller 6, squeezing rollers 7, 8, web guiding element 9, web funnel 10, draw-off rollers 11, 12, revolving flat 13 with flat rod 14, can 15 and can coiler 16. The rotation directions of the rollers are indicated with bent arrows. M denotes the centre point (axis) of the drum 4. The rotation direction (arrow A, B) of the front and rear flat guide pulley 13a, 13b (cogged belt wheels) is opposite to the rotation<br><br>
3<br>
direction (arrow E) of the drum 4. The flat rods 14 are drawn over the sliding guide through an endless cogged belt 23   On the upper side of the revolving flat 13 lying opposite to the sliding guide, the flat rods 14 lying on the endless cogged belt 23 are guided back in the direction of the arrow C.<br>
To the clothings of the flat rods 14, a slow-running, rotating flat brush 17 is allocated, whose clothing is in locked contact with the clothing of the quick-running rotating clearer roller 18. The flat guide pulley 13a and the flat brush 17 are driven through two output of a common gear, whose input is connected to a drive motor.<br>
To the machine frame 20 of the card, according to fig. 2, sampsons are fastened, in which the flat guide pulleys 13a, 13b are supported. Through these flat guide pulleys 13a, 13b, in the known method, the flats 44 ire guided. The detachment of the flat clearer from the flats 14 takes place by means of the flat brush 17 with a hook-shaped clothing 17a. At a flat speed of say 200 mm/min., the flat brush 17 has a rotation speed of 6 per minute (circumference speed 2564 mm/min. for a diameter of 136 mm). A rotating clearer roller 18 cleans the flat brush 17, whereby the 18a of the clearer roller 18 has a small distance to the clothing of the flat brush 17 The clearer roller 18 has a rotation speed of 1350 per minute (circumference speed 466.5 m/min. for a diameter of 110 mm). Between the clearer roller 18 and the flats 14, a guard 42 is foreseen, which is supposed to prevent that centrifuged waste gets on to and between the flats 14. The clearer roller 18 spins the card flat strip into a suction device 22.<br>
The gear 24 as shown in fig. 3a has an input 25 and two outputs 26 and 27. To the input, a drive motor 28, e.g. electrical motor, is allocated. The output 26 is coaxially connected to the shaft 17a of the flat brush 17, and the output 27 is coaxially connected to the shaft 13a1 of the flat guide roller 13a. The distance 'a' between both the outputs 26 and 27 is constant   The gear 24 is surrounded by a housing. Within the housing, the input 25 is designed as worm gear, which works together with a worm gear 30 staggered by 90°, which is arranged on a shaft 31. Both the ends of the shaft 31 are designed as worm shaft 31a, 31b, which work together with worm gears 32 or 33, which on their part are allocated to both the outputs 27 or 26 respectively.<br><br>
4<br>
According to fig. 3b, the flat guide pulley 13a circulates in direction A with a rotation speed n( and the flat brush 17 in direction F with rotation speed n2.<br>
According to fig. 4, the housing 29 - in which the gear 24 is arranged - is axially rotatable around the axis 13a' of the flat guide pulley 13a in the direction of the arrow G, H. The figure 34 denotes an adjustable unit, with which the housing 29 is rotated. The adjustable unit has two screw bolts 35a, 35b with different thread turning, which grip with their ends respectively with a common union 36 with inner threading. The one end of the screw bolt 35a is fastened on to the machine frame and the other end of the screw bolt 35b is guided on to the housing 29. Through axial rotation of the union 36, the housing 29 is rotated around the axis 13a', so that the flat brush 17 goes in the direction towards the flat rods 14 and away from it.<br>
It is emphasised that the design as shown in fig. 4 can also be fixed, i.e without the adjustable unit 34 and without rotatability of the housing around the axis 13a1.<br>
According to fig. 5, the housing 29 and bracket 21 are combined in one housing   The number 37 denotes an adjustable unit, in which - on the return side of the flat rods 14 - is arranged on the side of the cogged belt 23 away from the flat rods 14, and is in a position to shift the location of the cogged belt 23 along with the flat rods 14 in the direction of the arrow 1, K   If the flat brush 17 is arranged in a fixed manner, then in this way the cogged belt 23 can moved along with the flat rods 14 towards the flat brush 17 to and fro in such a way location-wise shifted - as compared to fig. 6a - in direction I to the extent that the clothing 14a and 17a stay in grip-contact with one another or get into this position   During operation, the flat brush 17 rotates in the direction F and the section 23a of the cogged belt 23 is moved in direction C In this way, different clothings 17a grip into the clothing 14a of different flat rods 14 timewise one after the other and fetch out flat strips.<br>
The flat brush 17 and the clearer roller 18 together form the flat-cleaning device<br>
According to fig. 7a, the housing 27 with the flat brush 17 is rotated in the direction of the arrow H to such an extent around the axis of the flat guide pulley 13a, that the clothing 14a of the flat rods 14 and the clothing 17a of the flat rods 17 are in grip-contact with one another or get into this position. The cleaning effect is the same as described in the case of fig 6b<br><br>
5<br>
According to fig. 7b, between the tips of die clothing 17a of the shiftable flat brush 17 and the tips of the clothing 14a of the fiat rods 14, there is a distance 'c\ i.e. the clothings 17a and 14a are not in contact. The housing 29 with the flat brush is rotated in the direction of the arrow G around the axis of the flat guide pulley 13a.<br><br>
