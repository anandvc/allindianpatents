CLEANSING WIPE ARTICLE AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE<br><br>
The invention foamable wipe improved 5  personal cleans<br>
art]<br>
manufacture<br>
relates to a substantially dry, disposable icle with physical features allowing for<br>
The article is especially useful for ing and conditioning of skin or hair.<br><br>
Traditional personal cleansing vehicles have been in the form of gels, bars and pourable liquid products.  These forms are highly effective for cleansing purposes. Nevertheless, they are somewhat boring and, indeed, have<br>
10  some deficiencies.  Often consumers combine the cleaning chemicals delivered by gels, bars and liquids with a wash cloth.  Advantages of a cloth include improved spreadability, ebrasive action and a pleasant ergonomic handfeel.  Realization of such advantages for combining<br>
15  cleansing chemicals with a wipe have led to a rather large body of technology.<br>
Among the most recent additions are a series of disclosures concerning substantially dry, disposable personal cleansing products activated upon use by wetting.  Illustrative is<br>
20  U.S. Patent 5,97 2,361 (Fowler et al.) disclosing a disposable, single use personal care cleansing and conditioning product wherein a lathering surfactant and oil soluble conditioning agent are during manufacture each separately applied to a substrate.  Similar disclosures are<br>
25  found in U.S. Patent 6,074,655 (Fowler et al.), U.S. Patent 5,951,991 (Wagner et al.) and U.S. Patent 6,132,746 (Hasenoehrl et al..).<br><br>
WO 02/056741<br><br>
PCT/EP02/00326<br><br>
- 2<br><br>
U.S. Patent 5, Mackey et al., of dry wipes, is reported to coating or by s<br>
52,043 and U.S. Patent 5,863,663, both to describe typical procedures for manufacture Application of the chemicals to the substrate be either through spraying, rotogravure creen printing.  Coatings are simply applied<br>
to either or both surfaces of the substrate.  Figure 2 describes a system where the substrate passes between a pair of presses thereby simultaneously coating each surface of the substrate.<br>
10  Amounts of transferred surfactant or conditioning emulsion<br><br>
are reported to<br><br>
be controlled by either of two general<br><br><br><br>
15<br>
20<br>
25<br><br>
adjustments. One of these is by control of the width of the nip area between the contact cylinders or other nip areas of the presses. The second general manner of adjustments is achieved through a change in the relief (valley depth) or print pattern on the areas of the cylinders contacting the substrate.<br>
Among problems associated with the process is selectivity of deposition, especially where different amounts and patterns of chemicals must, be deposited on opposite sides of the substrate web.  In particular, it may be desirable to produce a wipe where one surface bears a major amount of cleansing chemicals and the opposite surface is limited to a much smaller amount, but the latter being deposited in defined areas.  Articles of this type have the advantage that, with the aid of cues, the consumer will wet the chemically heavier deposited side and obtain instantly a richer foam.  On the other hand, for those consumers who have missed the cue, there still will be a small amount of<br><br><br><br>
30  foam generated on<br><br>
the side not intended for cleansing.<br><br>

Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to be able to provide a disposable, substantially dry cleansing product which includes a wiping substrate and a foamable composition wherein a major portion of the composition is applied onto one side of the wiping substrate and a minor portion on the other.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to be able to provide a disposable, substantially dry cleansing product formed as flexible wiping cloth, with one surface of the wiping cloth haying a different surface topography and a different amount: of composition deposited thereon than an opposite second surface.<br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is to be<br><br><br><br>
15  able to provide<br><br>
a method for producing a disposable,<br><br>
substantially dry cleansing product in a process which<br><br>
readily allows c wiping substrate<br><br>
oating of juxtaposed opposite surfaces of a<br>
but requiring application of the foamable<br><br>
composition to only a first of those surfaces.<br><br>
20  In a first aspect substantially dry<br>
(i)<br>
25<br><br>
of the invention, there is provided a cleansing product which includes:<br>
a water insoluble substrate defined by juxtaposed first and second major surfaces, the first major surface being formed with a plurality of upwardly projecting moguls spaced apart from one another; and<br><br>

(ii<br><br>
)     a foamable composition including a<br>
lathering surfactant wherein more of the composition is deposited on  the  second major surface than on the first major surface of the substrate.<br><br><br><br>
10<br><br><br>
Also provided is a method for producing a cleansing article which includes an apertured water-insoluble substrate having first and second major surfaces opposite one another, the first major surface being formed with a plurality of spaced apart moguls, and the article delivering a foamable composition including a lathering surfactant, the method<br><br>
including:<br><br>
15<br><br>
feeding the substrate onto a guide roller, the first major surface of the substrate being juxtaposed against a surface of the guide roller;<br>
applying the foamable composition to the second major surface of the substrate while the first<br><br><br><br>
majo:<br><br>
surface remains juxtaposed against the<br><br><br><br>
20<br><br>
guido roller; and<br>
allowing a minor amount of the applied foamable composition to transfer through the apertured substrate from the second to the first major surfc.ce.<br><br>
Further objects, 25  invention will<br>
consideration of<br>
advantages and features of the present become more readily apparent from the following drawing in which:<br><br>

15  Now it has been found that providing a pattern of raised<br>
20<br>
moguls onto a first surface of a substrate aids in achieving partial coating of that surface when an opposite surface is supplied with a foamable composition.  The moguls function as spacers between the first surface of the substrate and a surface of the guide roller.  Foamable composition when applied to the opposite surface of the substrate can penetrate through apertures in the substrate and, as a result of the spaced apart relationship seep through to the first surface of the substrate between the moguls.  Without the moguls, pressure of guide roller against coating roller would reduce the interstitial space into which seepage to the first surface occurs.<br><br>

The fibers can either be random 25  (i.e., randomly aligned) or they can be carded (i.e. combed to be oriented in primarily one direction).  Furthermore, the non-woven substrate can be composed of a combination of layers of random and carded fibers.<br>

from 12 to 22 carbon atoms; and X is an anion selected from<br>
chloride, bromide;, iodide, acetate, phosphate, nitrate, sulfate, methyl sulfate, ethyl sulfate, tosylate, lactylate, citrate, glycolate, and mixtures thereof.  Additionally, the alkyl groups can also contain ether linkages, or hydroxy or amino group substituents (e.g. the alkyl groups can contain polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol moieties). Preferably the anion is phosphate, especially preferred is<br><br>

Amino silicones; quats may similarly be employed.  Most 5  preferred is Silquat AD designated by the CTFA as Silicone Quaternium 8, a.vailable from Siltech Inc.<br>
Amounts of each, cationic agent may range from about 0.06% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 3%, optimally 10  from about 0.3 to about 2.5% by weight of the foamable composition.<br>
When water or mbisture is used or present in the<br><br>
manufacturing pirocess, the resulting treated substrate is 15  then dried so that it is substantially free of water.  The term "substantially dry" means the amount of water should not exceed 30% but may range from about 1% to about 15%, preferably no higher than about' 4% by weight of the total product. The treated substrate can be dried by any means 20  known to those skilled in the art.  Non-limiting examples of known drying means include the use of convection ovens, radiant heat sources, microwave ovens, forced air ovens, and heated rollers or cams.  Drying also includes air drying without the addition of heat energy, other than that present 25  in the ambient environment.  Also, a combination of various drying methods can be used.<br><br>
