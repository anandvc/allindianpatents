				<td>Description<br>
Method and apparatus for voltage measurement<br>
The invention relates to a method for measuring the voltage at<br>
a point in a power distribution network by means of a measuring<br>
circuit, which has a voltage sensor, which is coupled to a<br>
current-carrying conductor of the network, and a<br>
further-processing arrangement, which is connected to the<br>
voltage sensor, and outputs a measured voltage value as the<br>
output signal at its output, and to an apparatus for carrying<br>
out this method.<br>
In power distribution networks, preferably in the voltage range<br>
of 6-20 kV, at present devices are still predominantly used for<br>
protection and control purposes which represent directionally<br>
independent overcurrent protection. This is sufficient in<br>
networks having a central supply and in which the current<br>
direction is predetermined. In the case of a decentralized<br>
supply, however, it is also necessary, for the response of<br>
protective devices, for the direction of a current to also be<br>
detected, in addition to the level of the current. This can be<br>
determined by additional voltage measurements in the network.<br>
For this purpose, inductive voltage transformers are generally<br>
used today as the voltage sensors. They make it possible to<br>
measure the voltage accurately, but represent a considerable<br>
cost factor, in particular if they are installed<br>
retrospectively in existing networks.<br>
The German laid-open specification DE 23 25 449 Al describes<br>
the use of a capacitive voltage transformer as a voltage sensor<br>
for the purpose of measuring the voltage in high-voltage<br>
switchgear assemblies, said voltage transformer being formed<br>
from a current-carrying conductor of the<br><br>
high-voltage network and an electrode embedded in a post<br>
insulator of the conductor. Such capacitive voltage<br>
transformers are generally used today, however, merely for<br>
establishing the presence of a voltage having a specific<br>
minimum level on a line of a power distribution network the<br>
displacement current of a high-voltage coupling capacitor,<br>
since the measurement result obtained is sometimes relatively<br>
inaccurate, with the result that it can only be used to<br>
establish the presence of the voltage but not to determine its<br>
precise value.<br>
The object of the present invention is to specify a method and<br>
an apparatus of the abovementioned type, by means of which<br>
accurate voltage measurement can be carried out irrespective of<br>
the type of voltage sensor.<br>
In terms of the method, this object is achieved according to<br>
the invention by the fact that, in a method of the mentioned<br>
type, the output signal from the measuring circuit is corrected<br>
so as to achieve a correct measured value by means of a<br>
correction element having a transfer function which is inverse<br>
to the transfer function of the measuring circuit. As a result<br>
of the fact that the output signal from the measuring circuit<br>
is corrected so as to achieve a correct measured value by means<br>
of a correction element having a transfer function which is<br>
inverse to the transfer function of the measuring circuit, it<br>
is possible, using comparatively simple means, for sufficiently<br>
accurate voltage measurement to be carried out irrespective of<br>
the type of voltage sensor.<br>
The method according to the invention can advantageously<br>
provide for a capacitor device to be used as the voltage sensor<br>
of the measuring circuit. The use of a capacitor device - i.e.<br>
a capacitive voltage<br><br>
transformer - as the voltage sensor represents a comparatively<br>
cost-effective possibility for voltage measurement.<br>
In this context, it is also regarded as advantageous if a<br>
coupling capacitor, formed from the current-carrying conductor<br>
of the network and an electrode which is DC-isolated from said<br>
current-carrying conductor, is used as the capacitor device.<br>
Such capacitor devices have a comparatively simple design; in<br>
addition, capacitor devices of this type are already often<br>
provided, for example, in high-voltage bushings of switchgear<br>
cells.<br>
As an alternative, however, it is also advantageously possible<br>
to provide for an inductive voltage transformer, which is<br>
connected on the primary side to the current-carrying<br>
conductor, to be used as the voltage sensor. This is regarded<br>
as being particularly advantageous because such an inductive<br>
voltage transformer generally makes very accurate voltage<br>
measurement possible. Since, however, the measuring circuit can<br>
also have a transfer function which slightly falsifies the<br>
measured voltage value when an inductive voltage transformer is<br>
used, even more accurate measured voltage values can be<br>
achieved in this case too when using the correction by means of<br>
the correction element in accordance with the method according<br>
to the invention.<br>
In this case, however, it is also regarded as advantageous if a<br>
correction element is used which can optionally be bypassed via<br>
a switch. In this manner, the correction element can easily be<br>
bypassed if the measured voltage values achieved using the<br>
inductive voltage transformer are sufficiently accurate; in<br>
such a case no correction of the measured voltage values<br>
therefore takes place.<br><br>
Depending on whether the output signal from the measuring<br>
circuit is analog or digital, an analog or digital filter<br>
having a transfer function which is inverse to the transfer<br>
function of the measuring circuit can be used as the correction<br>
element. The analog filter expediently simulates a transfer<br>
function having a PID characteristic.<br>
When using a digital filter, a temporally discrete	transfer<br>
function is suitable as the inverse transfer function.	This can<br>
be generated in a manner known per se by means of a	bilinear<br>
transformation.<br>
In this context, it is also regarded as advantageous if, in the<br>
case of the digital filter, the coefficients of the temporally<br>
discrete transfer function can be altered. In this case, the<br>
transfer function of the correction element can be matched in a<br>
particularly simple manner to transfer functions of the<br>
measuring circuit brought about by different voltage sensors.<br>
One further advantageous development of the method according to<br>
the invention also provides for a further-processing<br>
arrangement to be used which has a DC isolating element in its<br>
input region. The further-processing arrangement and the<br>
correction element can thus be DC-isolated from the<br>
high-voltage side without any problems.<br>
In terms of the apparatus, the object on which the invention is<br>
based is achieved by a measuring apparatus for measuring the<br>
voltage at a point in a power distribution network by means of<br>
a measuring circuit, which has a voltage sensor, which is<br>
coupled to a current-carrying conductor of the network, and<br><br>
a further-processing arrangement, which is connected to the<br>
voltage sensor, and outputs a measured voltage value as the<br>
output signal at its output, a correction element being<br>
connected to the measuring circuit on the output side in<br>
accordance with the invention so as to achieve a correct<br>
measured value from the output signal from the measuring<br>
circuit, said correction element having a transfer function<br>
which is inverse to the transfer function of the measuring<br>
circuit. Owing to the use of a correction element having a<br>
transfer function which is inverse to the transfer function of<br>
the measuring circuit, it is possible to achieve accurate<br>
measured voltage values with such a measuring apparatus using<br>
any desired measuring sensors.<br>
For reasons of cost, provision can advantageously be made for<br>
the voltage sensor to be a capacitor device. In accordance with<br>
one preferred embodiment, such a capacitor device may also be a<br>
coupling capacitor formed from the current-carrying conductor<br>
of the network and an electrode which is DC-isolated from said<br>
current-carrying conductor. An electrode having this design may<br>
preferably be a so-called ring electrode.<br>
As an alternative, however, provision may also be made for the<br>
voltage sensor to be an inductive voltage transformer, which is<br>
connected on the primary side to the current-carrying<br>
conductor.<br>
Since such an inductive voltage transformer often already<br>
produces measured voltage values of a very high quality, in<br>
this context provision may also be made for it to be possible<br>
for the correction element to be optionally bypassed via a<br>
switch.<br>
However, even in the case of an inductive voltage transformer,<br>
the quality of the measured voltage values can often be<br><br>
increased further still by the use, according to the invention,<br>
of<br><br>
a correction element having an inverse transfer function, with<br>
the result that it is also worthwhile in this case to use the<br>
correction element, which in this case is therefore not<br>
bypassed.<br>
In other words, a measuring apparatus according to the<br>
invention has, for example, an input terminal for the optional<br>
connection to any desired voltage sensors, for example to the<br>
electrode of the coupling capacitor or to the secondary winding<br>
of an inductive voltage transformer, which is connected on the<br>
primary side to the current-carrying conductor. As a result, it<br>
is in this case possible to connect the measuring apparatus to<br>
the corresponding voltage sensor irrespective of whether a<br>
coupling capacitor or an inductive voltage transformer has<br>
already been installed at the measurement point in the network.<br>
The measuring apparatus is then provided with a switch for<br>
optionally switching the correction element which simulates the<br>
inverse transfer function on or off in order to switch the<br>
correction element on in the event of a connection to the<br>
coupling capacitor and to switch the correction element off, if<br>
required, in the event of a connection to the voltage<br>
transformer. Even in the case of the inductive voltage<br>
transformer, in this case the correction element could remain<br>
switched on, in which case the inverse transfer function of<br>
said correction element would have to be correspondingly<br>
altered. It would be possible for this to be carried out in a<br>
simple manner, in particular in the case of a digital filter<br>
having a temporally discrete transfer function as the<br>
correction element, by adjusting the coefficients.<br>
Depending on whether the output signal from the measuring<br>
circuit is an analog or a digital output signal, an analog<br>
filter having a PID characteristic or a digital filter can<br>
correspondingly be used.<br><br>
One advantageous development of the measuring apparatus<br>
according to the invention provides for the further-processing<br>
arrangement to have a DC isolating element in its input region.<br>
It is thus possible to DC-isolate the high-voltage part of the<br>
measuring apparatus from the low-voltage part in a simple<br>
manner. The DC isolating element can preferably be an inductive<br>
current transformer.<br>
In accordance with one further advantageous development of the<br>
measuring apparatus according to the invention, the voltage<br>
sensor is connected on the output side to a series circuit<br>
comprising a resistor having a high resistance value and the<br>
primary winding of the inductive current transformer. The input<br>
voltage of the further-processing arrangement is converted to a<br>
comparatively low current via the resistor having a high<br>
resistance value such that the inductive current transformer<br>
can be designed to be comparatively small and thus inexpensive.<br>
One further advantageous development of the measuring apparatus<br>
according to the invention also provides for the secondary<br>
winding of the current transformer to be loaded by a negative<br>
feedback operational amplifier with an internal resistance of<br>
0 ohm. In turn, a current/voltage conversion takes place using<br>
the operational amplifier, in which case the range of the level<br>
of the resulting voltage can be adjusted by the negative<br>
feedback of the operational amplifier, for example via a<br>
resistor arranged in the negative feedback path.<br>
In addition, one advantageous embodiment of the measuring<br>
apparatus according to the invention is regarded as the fact<br>
that the measuring circuit has an analog-to-digital converter<br>
on the output side in order to generate digital output signals<br>
from the measurement arrangement.<br><br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below with reference to an<br>
exemplary embodiment illustrated in the figure of the accompanying drawing.<br>
The figure shows the circuit diagram of a measuring apparatus MV for voltage<br>
measurement using a digital filter as the correction element KG in order to<br>
correct the measured voltage values.<br>
A current conductor 1 of a power distribution network forms an electrode of a<br>
capacitive voltage transformer as the voltage sensor SG in the form of a high-<br>
voltage coupling capacitor 2. The other electrode of the coupling capacitor 2,<br>
which is preferably passed around the current conductor 1 in annular fashion<br>
such that it is DC-isolated from said current conductor 1, is connected to an input<br>
terminal 3 of a further-processing arrangement WA of the measuring apparatus<br>
MV. In a similar manner, other forms of capacitive voltage transformer are also<br>
possible as the voltage sensor SG, however. As illustrated in the figure, the<br>
capacitive voltage transformer may optionally be a capacitive divider, whose low-<br>
voltage capacitor is represented by dashed lines in the figure. An embodiment in<br>
the form of a capacitive divider is not absolutely necessary, however. Instead,<br>
as is indicated by the further dashed line, the secondary winding of an inductive<br>
voltage transformer 4, which is connected on the primary side to the current<br>
conductor 1, can also be connected to the input terminal 3 of the further-<br>
processing arrangement WA. As is indicated in the figure by the curved bracket,<br>
the voltage sensor SG and the further-processing arrangement WA together form<br>
a so-called measuring circuit MS.<br>
The text which follows will consider the case in which the coupling<br>
capacitor 2 as the voltage sensor SG is connected to the input terminal<br>
3 of the further-processing arrangement WA. A series resistor 5 (Rv),<br>
which generally has a high resistance value and is arranged downstream of<br>
the input terminal 3, carries out a voltage / current conversion of the<br><br>
voltage, which has been tapped off capacitively at the<br>
electrode, which is DC-isolated from the current conductor 1,<br>
of the coupling capacitor 2, to a displacement current. In<br>
addition, the series resistor 5 forms, with the capacitance of<br>
the coupling capacitor 2, a high-pass filter and therefore<br>
improves the input-side EMC (electromagnetic compatibility)<br>
performance of the measuring apparatus MV.<br>
A DC isolating element, which is connected on the primary side<br>
in series with the series resistor 5 and is in the form of an<br>
inductive current transformer 6, on the one hand serves the<br>
purpose of potential isolation and, on the other hand, serves<br>
the purpose of reducing the coupling capacitance with respect<br>
to the high-voltage conductor and thus brings about further EMC<br>
shielding. Owing to the displacement current which is low as a<br>
result of the dimensions of the series resistor 5, the<br>
inductive current transformer 6 can be designed to be<br>
relatively small.<br>
An operational amplifier 7 having a feedback resistor 8 (Rm) is<br>
connected to the secondary side of the inductive current<br>
transformer 6. The operational amplifier 7 acts as an active<br>
load for the inductive current transformer 6 with an internal<br>
resistance of 0 ohm. At the same time, the operational<br>
amplifier 7 takes on the function of current/voltage conversion<br>
and converts the current produced by the inductive current<br>
transformer 6 to a voltage. The ratio between the output<br>
voltage and the input current of the operational amplifier 7 is<br>
determined by the value Rm for the feedback resistor 8. This<br>
value can be switched over by means of a link or an analog<br>
switch, as indicated in the figure, in order to be able to<br>
match the driving of the current transformer 6, which driving<br>
is dependent on the coupling capacitor 2 or the voltage<br>
transformer 3, to the measurement range of an analog-to-digital<br>
converter 9 downstream of the operational amplifier 7.<br><br>
Said analog-to-digital converter 9 converts its input voltage<br>
to a digital sample sequence.<br>
If the input terminal 3 of the further-processing arrangement<br>
WA is connected to the inductive voltage transformer 4, the<br>
transfer performance of the measuring circuit MS formed from<br>
the voltage sensor SG (i.e. in this case the inductive voltage<br>
transformer 4) and the further-processing arrangement WA is<br>
independent of the frequency in the relevant frequency range<br>
(50 or 60 Hz).<br>
In contrast, in the event of a connection to the coupling<br>
capacitor 2, the following transfer function for the measuring<br>
circuit MS to the analog-to-digital converter 9 results:<br><br>
where UA is the voltage at the output of the operational<br>
amplifier 7, UPrim is the voltage of the current conductor 1,<br>
and CD is the capacitance of the coupling capacitor 2. If the<br>
value for UA resulting using this transfer function is left<br>
unchanged, a measured voltage value is obtained which is<br>
completely unsuitable for accurate voltage measurement. The<br>
transfer function of the entire measuring apparatus MV<br>
(comprising the voltage sensor SG, the further-processing<br>
arrangement WA and the correction element KG) therefore needs<br>
to be corrected by a downstream correction element KG by means<br>
of a transfer function which is inverse to the transfer<br>
function of the measuring circuit MS. This correcting inverse<br>
transfer function of the correction element KG should be formed<br>
in accordance with the following equation:<br><br><br>
The resultant transfer function of the entire measuring<br>
apparatus MV in turn represents a high-pass filter, but with a<br>
new cut-off frequency 1/ (2*pi*TK) . The time constant TK can in<br>
this case be selected such that the cut-off frequency is below<br>
the frequency range to be detected for the measured voltage<br>
value, with the result that the transfer function of the entire<br>
measuring apparatus MV is linear in this frequency range. It is<br>
particularly advantageous if TK is equal to the time constant<br>
of the current transformer used for detecting the current<br>
signals, which are likewise measured at the same time as the<br>
voltage signal.<br>
If, as shown in the figure, a digital filter 10 is used to<br>
correct the transfer function of the measuring circuit MS, the<br>
correcting transfer function Gcorr can previously be transformed<br>
into a temporally discrete transfer function G(z-1). This takes<br>
place with the aid of the bilinear transformation<br><br>
The right-hand side of this equation is the series expansion,<br>
terminated after the first element, of the function e-jω'T. This<br>
gives:<br><br>
where z-1 is the delay of a sampled value by a sampling<br>
interval; a0, a1 and b1 are coefficients of the temporally<br><br>
discrete transfer function. This temporally discrete transfer<br>
function G(z-1) is implemented by the digital filter 10<br>
illustrated in the figure. This in turn has a final<br>
amplification at the frequency 0, with the result that the<br>
numerical stability of the apparatus is ensured even in the<br>
case of an offset of the analog-to-digital converter 9.<br>
A switch 11 is used to connect the output of the<br>
analog-to-digital converter 9 to the measured value output 12<br>
of the measuring apparatus MV either directly or via the<br>
digital filter 10. The direct connection can be selected if the<br>
inductive voltage transformer 4 as the voltage sensor SG is<br>
connected to the input terminal 3 of the further-processing<br>
arrangement WA, and the connection via the digital filter 10 is<br>
selected if the coupling capacitor 2 as the voltage sensor SG<br>
is connected to the input terminal 3. The switch 11 could,<br>
however, also be dispensed with, with the result that, in both<br>
cases, the digital filter 10 is included since an improvement<br>
in the quality of the measured voltage values can be achieved<br>
owing to the shift in the cut-off frequency of the transfer<br>
function of the entire measuring apparatus MV even in the case<br>
in which the inductive voltage transformer 4 is used. However,<br>
the coefficients of the digital filter 10 can in each case be<br>
adjusted differently for the connection to the inductive<br>
voltage transformer 4, on the one hand, and to the coupling<br>
capacitor 2, on the other hand.<br>
Correspondingly, a measuring apparatus can also be implemented<br>
using analog voltage signals, in which case an analog filter<br>
would be used in place of the digital filter, and the<br>
analog-to-digital converter would be dispensed with.<br><br>
