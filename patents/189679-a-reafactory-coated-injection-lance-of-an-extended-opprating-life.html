				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The   invention relates to a refractory coated injection lance  of an extended operating life suitable for use  repeatedly in the pretreatment of hot metal and refining  of steel by injecting  a mixture  of reagents and gases  or only gases   in the hot  metal  or steel  bath.<br>
To meet the  increasing demand  for metal and steel of stringent quality standard,  the  pretreatment of hot metal and refining of steel by following the injection process has  become essential at present.     In the  injection process,  a mixture  of reagents  and gases  or gases alone are  injected into the  hot metal  or steel  bath by mixing them with a certain carrier gas in a vessel  called  'Dispenser1.     From the  dispenser reagents are  conveyed to an injection lance which is  dipped into the hot molten metal  or steel to  release the  mixture   of reagents  and gases  ar gases alone at  a desired depth inside the bath,  generally at the  maximum depth of the  bath.<br>
The  drawbacks  of a conventional lance are :<br>
(i)     it  is not  refractory coated;<br>
(ii)     it  is not suitable  for injecting solid reagents in the  hot  metal  bath;<br>
(iii)     it  is not  suitable  for injecting gases  into  the hot  metal  bath at  any desired depth of the  hot metal  bath;<br>
(iv)     it  is  subject  to appreciable  vibrations  during  use;<br>
(v)     all  of its nozzles  are provided at  the   bottom surface thereof and to be used simultaneously;     and<br>
(vi)     it  is not   reusable if one  or more   of its nozzles  is blocked.<br>
The  object of the present invention is to provide an improved lance which is  refractory coated,   can be used for injecting  a mixture  of multiple solid reagents  in powder or granular forms with carrier gases or gases alone at any desired depth of the hot metal bath,   can be  supported at the ladle  bottom for minimising its vibration during use,   is provided with multiple nozzles  on its vertical surface at  different heights  from its bottom end to facilitate injection of reagents and gases at any desired depth of hot metal bath without getting choked easily, can be used repeatedly by making only 1   or 2 nozzles  operative at a time and activating the  remaining  nozzles when the used nozzles  are  blocked and is  provided with lifting lugs   for facilitating  its placement  at the  lance  carriage   or  inside  the heating  furnace.<br>
The  improved lance has been  constructed to have  a maximum number of eight nozzles and make  it suitable  for use with :-<br>
(a)	depth of  injection	- 0.5m to 3.5m<br>
(b)	pressure  of  carrier gas"	-   1.0 to 7.0  Kg/cm<br>
(c)	ratio of gas to solid<br>
reagents  injected	- 4 lit/kg to  120 lit/kg<br>
(d)	particle size of solid<br>
reagents  injected	-  100 microns to  1   mm<br>
(e)	minimum number of outlet<br>
nozzles  functioning  at a<br>
time	-  1<br>
(f)	maximum number of outlet<br>
nozzles functioning at a<br>
time	- 2<br>
Thus the invention provides a refractory coated injection lance  of an extended operating life  of 10-12 heats  being  suitable  for injecting mixture of solid reagents and carrier gases or gases alone at<br>
any desired depth of the  hot metal bath in a ladle,  and capable<br>
of being  supported at the tafch.   bottom in for operating a vibrat: ion-free manner,<br>
characterised in that the lance comprises  a robust carbon steel pipe;  a plurality of anchors attached to the  outer vertical surface  of pipe by v/elding at desired intervals,  the anchors and pipe being  covered with cushioning materials to overcome the  effect  of the  difference   in their thermal expansions;   a coating of the mixture of monolithic  refractory materials around the lower part of the lance;   a plurality of nozzles protruding the lance  body laterally near the lower part thereof,   making only one   or two of the  said nozzles operative at a time;   and lugs  fitted to the lance near its upper part for facilitating handling  of the lance 'during  its transfer from the lance  stand to the  heating  bay and vice  versa.<br>
The  construction  of the  invented injection lance   is described with reference to the  drawings accompanying the provisional specification and the  revised fresh drawings accompanying  the revised complete specification?in an unrestricted manner by v/ay of example  only,   in which -<br>
Figure 1 shows the sectional sketch of the injection lance illustrating its main components'and an enlarged view of the bottom part of the injection lance.<br>
In Fig.   1  of both the provisional and. revised complete specifications,  a robust  carbon steel pipe   d)  is provided at the centre  of the  lance for conveying the  mixture  of reagents  and gases or gases alone supplied through a hose  connected to the top of the lance by a coupling arrangement at  (5)  for injection into the hot metal bath through outlet nozzles  (6) at the vertical side of the lance near its bottom part.     A number of anchors  (2) are attached to the outer vertical surface of pipe  (1)  by welding at predetermined intervale,  the anchors and the pipe being covered with suitable cushioning materials such as scraps, coconut  ropes,  light v/ood chips etc.  to  overcome the effect  of the  difference  in their thermal expansions.     The portion of the lance length,  marked (AB),   is coated with a mixture  of monolithic refractory materials  (3)«     Lugs   (4) are  fitted to the lance near its top part for facilitating its handling during  its transfer from the  lance stand to the  heating bay and from the  heating bay to the lance stand.<br>
The  outlet nozzles  (6) are arranged  in a straight line across the lance body near its  bottom part to facilitate their cleaning for repeated applications of the  lance.     Upto a maximum of eight  outlet nozzles  can be provided in the lance  although not more than two of these are allowed to be  operational at a time. The  remaining  outlet nozzles are put into  action when the nozzles already used get damaged or blocked.     An enlarged view (A1)  of bottom portion of the lance  is given in Fig.   1  of revised complete specification.     This ensures  an extended operating life  of the invented lance  compared with a conventional lance.     The  other<br>
merits  of the   invented lance are   :-  (i)  it  can be used for injecting  multiple  solid reagents  such as   mixture  of finely powdered lime,   sodaash,   calcium carbide  and magnesium carbide, (ii)  it  can be used for injecting both gases  and mixture  of gases and said solid reagents,   (iii)  it is capable of being positioned is a vibration-free  manner at the  bottom of the hot metal  bath to facilitate precise control of the  depth of the location inside the  bath where the   injection of the  mixture  of reagents and gases  or gases alone take place and (iv)   it  is provided with lugs to facilitate  its handling during transfer from the lance  stand to the  heating bay and vice versa.<br><br><br><br><br>

operating life of 10-12 heats  compared with normal 4-6 heats,<br>
