[Title of the Invention]  FRONT BODY COVER STRUCTURE FOR MOTORCYCLE [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a front body cover structure for a motorcycle which has a rear cover for covering a head pipe, which steerably supports a steering stem and is provided at the front end of a body frame, and the steering stem from the rear, the rear cover having formed therein a bulged portion that is curved rearwardly convex so as to avoid interference with the head pipe and the steering stem. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
In a known scoter-type motorcycle disclosed in Patent Document 1, a leg shield serving as a rear cover for covering a steering stem and a head pipe from the rear is integrally formed of synthetic resin from a step floor to a handlebar cover. [Patent Document 1] JP Patent No. 3875029 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
In the laterally central portion of the leg shield disclosed in Patent Document 1 mentioned above, there is integrally formed a bulged portion that is curved rearwardly convex so as to avoid interference with the steering stem and the head pipe. Since this bulged portion has a larger curvature than the portions positioned on the left and right of the bulged<br><br>
portion, the shape of a molding die used for molding the leg shield becomes complex, and the freedom of design of the leg shield may become restricted as a result. Further, the resulting constraint may also affect the freedom in creating a design that satisfies increasingly diverse user preferences. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the circumstances mentioned above, and accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a front body cover structure for a motorcycle which achieves simplification of the molding die for molding a rear cover and can enhance the degree of freedom in molding the rear cover. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0005]<br>
To attain the above-mentioned object, in an aspect of the invention in Claim 1, there is provided a front body cover structure for a motorcycle, including a rear cover for covering a head pipe, which steerably supports a steering stem and is provided at a front end of a body frame, and the steering stem from the rear, the rear cover having a bulged portion that is curved rearwardly convex so as to avoid interference with the head pipe and the steering stem, in which the rear cover includes a rear cover main body, and a cover member that is attached to the rear cover main body so as to form the bulged portion. [0006]<br>
In an aspect of the invention in Claim 2, in addition to the aspect of the invention in Claim 1, the cover member which<br><br>
is matched in color tone to a handlebar cover for covering an upper portion of the steering stem and a central portion of a bar-shaped steering handlebar coupled to an upper end of the steering stem, and which differs in color tone from the rear cover main body is formed in a shape that is smoothly continuous to a back surface of a central portion of the handlebar cover. [0007]<br>
In an aspect of the invention in Claim 3, in addition to the aspect of the invention in Claim 1 or 2, an accessory is attached to the cover member. [0008]<br>
In an aspect of the invention in Claim 4, in addition to the aspect of the invention in Claim 3, the accessory is a loading hook formed integrally with the cover member. [0009]<br>
In an aspect of the invention in Claim 5, in addition to the aspect of the invention in Claim 3, a battery is arranged in front of the head pipe, and a speaker or a navigation unit as the accessory is disposed on the cover member. [Effect of the Invention] [0010]<br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 1, since the bulged portion of the rear cover is formed by the cover member attached to the rear cover main body, it is possible to simplify the shape of a molding die used for molding the rear cover main body, and also enhance the degree of freedom in the overall shape of the rear cover.<br><br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 2, the cover member is formed smoothly continuous to the handlebar cover located above the cover member, and is matched in color tone to the handlebar cover. A sense of integrity with the handlebar cover can be thus created, which provides an effect of increasing the sharpness of the overall body design, and also allows for differentiation of the motorcycle by accentuating the body design. [0012]<br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 3, a motorcycle having an accessory function can be obtained by replacing only the cover member without replacing the entire cover member, thereby making it possible to achieve differentiation of the motorcycle at low cost. [0013]<br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 4, since the loading hook is formed integrally with the cover member, as compared with a case where the loading hook is provided separately from the body cover, it is possible to avoid an increase in the number of parts, and obtain a motorcycle including the loading hook by only replacing the cover member. [0014]<br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 5, a motorcycle having the speaker or navigation unit disposed at a position near the battery can be obtained without replacing the entire vehicle cover. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br><br>
