FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This invention pertains to a system and method for evaluating a machined<br>
surface of a cast metal component More particularly, the invention relates to cast-metal<br>
parts and vision based, non-contact inspection systems for inspecting cast-metal parts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Manufacturers of cast-metal components having machined surfaces<br>
typically inspect each component to identify presence of surface defects, to determine if<br>
the component is in compliance with quality standards. Surface defects of interest<br>
typically include pores, or openings, which indicate voids in the cast metal. Such voids<br>
are caused, for example, by impurities in the cast metal, and metal flow problems<br>
during the casting process. A specific pore may indicate a small void, or it may indicate<br>
and lead to a much larger void below the surface. A pore may be located in a critical<br>
location in the cast part, such as an edge of a casting, or near a heat-affected zone,<br>
and affect overall part quality and performance in-use. Alternatively, a pore may be<br>
located in a non-critical location, with little or no effect on part quality and in-use<br>
reliability and performance. Voids in the casting typically associated with surface defects<br>
include, by way of example, a small isolated opening, a pore with a concave region, a<br>
convex hull in the casting created prior to pore separation, a top edge-connected pore,<br>
or, an edge-connected pore on the inside of a concave region.<br>
[0003]	One present method and apparatus for inspecting and detecting surface<br>
defects comprises having a human operator measure a machined surface used a<br>
MYLARâ„¢ (or equivalent) template, and visually evaluating the result to identify and<br>
detect defects therefrom. The quality and reliability<br><br>
of such inspection is subject to the operator's overall capability and<br>
performance over time.<br>
[0004]	A second method and system as been developed comprising a<br>
surface porosity inspection process using a line-scan camera and lighting<br>
system to obtain an image of a surface. Software was developed to evaluate<br>
surface pores using adaptive threshold and characterization of isolated and<br>
edge-connected pores. An adaptive threshold grayscale process generates a<br>
black and white image of the surface. An inverted binary (i.e. pure black and<br>
white) image is presented for processing to identify the pores using<br>
algorithms. Such a system is not robust in a manufacturing production<br>
environment because of limitations related to identification of surface defects<br>
with edge-connected pores. These limitations included an inability to reliably<br>
detect a pore with a concave region, a convex hull created prior to pore<br>
separation, or an edge-connected pore on an inside of a concave region. In<br>
addition, size of convexity defects and neighboring pores may be inaccurately<br>
measured, leading to false detections. Furthermore, the system may falsely<br>
detect small defects, or sharp features, or tightly-cornered features. Such a<br>
system typically requires an operator to inspect and sort parts after machine<br>
inspection in conjunction with the analysis from the inspection system,<br>
defeating the purpose of the inspection station, and introducing risk of human<br>
error into the process.<br>
[0005]	Therefore, there is a need to objectively inspect and analyze a<br>
surface of a machined, cast-metal part at manufacturing line processing rates<br>
to accurately, rep'eatably, and reliably identify defects so as to minimize and<br>
eliminate false-pass errors. There is a further need to reliably identify<br>
intricately-shaped defects and high-density small-sized defects. There is a<br>
further need to minimize operator involvement in the inspection process, and<br>
improve part throughput rate of the inspection process.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	In accordance with the present invention, a method and system<br>
provides a computer-based visual, non-contact, inspection of machined<br>
surfaces of cast metal parts, to reliably identify and detect surface defects,<br>
according to predetermined quality specifications. The disclosed method and<br>
system operates at production line rates. The method and system provide a<br>
vision-based system to identify and evaluate specific casting defects generally<br>
known as pores, and eliminate a need for close operator attendance and<br>
interaction that previously has been required to visually inspect critical<br>
machined surfaces of certain components, for example cast engine<br>
components. The method and system reduce part evaluation time, improve<br>
product reliability, and provide greater consistency of part evaluation while<br>
eliminating potentially arbitrary decision-making by an operator regarding<br>
surface quality that may occur in a production environment. In general, all<br>
parts are evaluated using the same measurement system and evaluation<br>
criteria, and unacceptable parts are automatically removed from the<br>
manufacturing line.<br>
[0007]	The present method and system for evaluating a machined<br>
surface of a cast-metal part preferably comprises a plurality of conveyors,<br>
operable to move the cast-metal part to and from a porosity inspection station.<br>
The porosity inspection station comprises a digital monochrome camera, a<br>
lighting station, and a precision-controlled transfer station. There is a<br>
computer workstation, having a plurality of data processing computers, and a<br>
graphical user interface. The workstation is operably connected to the<br>
plurality of conveyors, and signally and operably connected to the porosity<br>
inspection station.<br>
[0008]	In accordance with the present invention, the system and<br>
method are operable to acquire an original pixelated image of the machined<br>
surface, wherein each pixel comprises a digitized representation of a portion of<br>
the machined surface, and identify known design surface features in the<br>
original pixelated image, based upon predetermined criteria. The original<br><br>
pixelated image of the machined surface is oriented and scaled to an XY<br>
coordinate system, based upon the known design surface features. An<br>
inverted digital image of the machined surface is generated. A second image<br>
of the machined surface is generated, comprising eliminating the known<br>
design surface features from the inverted digital image. Each pixel of the<br>
inverted digital image is compared with a correspondingly located pixel of the<br>
second image, with pixel location based upon the pixelated image oriented and<br>
scaled to the XY coordinate system. Any surface feature common to the<br>
inverted digital image and the second image is identified. Each identified<br>
surface feature common to both images is analyzed statistically for<br>
conformance to a threshold. A defect is identified as any identified surface<br>
feature common to both images which exceeds the threshold.<br>
[0009]	Another aspect of the invention comprises the computer<br>
workstation operable to control the plurality of conveyors to move the cast-<br>
metal component into position for further processing when a quantity of<br>
identified defects is below a threshold. The computer workstation is operable<br>
to control the plurality of conveyors to move the cast-metal component out of<br>
position for further processing when the quantity of identified defects exceeds<br>
the threshold.<br>
[0010]	It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide the<br>
method and system with a decision scheme in which only parts meeting the<br>
predetermined quality specifications are accepted for further processing.<br>
[0011]	It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide the<br>
method and system with a scheme to determine density of surface defects<br>
within a specified region of interest.<br>
[0012]	It is an aspect of the present invention to identify surface<br>
defects with: a concave region, and, when a convex hull is created prior to<br>
defect (pore) separation, a top edge-connected pore, an isolated pore, and, an<br>
edge-connected pore on an inside portion of a concave region, It is also an<br>
aspect of the present invention to analyze a pore and defect in relationship to<br>
neighboring defects and sharp or tight cornered features.<br><br>
[0013]	These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following<br>
detailed description of the embodiments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0022]	Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for<br>
the purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of<br>
limiting the same, Fig. I shows a schematic diagram of an exemplary vision<br>
system which has been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The exemplary vision system comprises a feed conveyor 12,<br><br>
porosity inspection station 14, processing conveyor 16, part shuttle 18,<br>
production conveyor 20, and scrap conveyors 22, 24. Each of the<br>
aforementioned devices is operably controlled by the workstation 10, as<br>
described in detail hereinafter. In overall operation, a component 1 for<br>
inspection (not shown) is presented to the feed conveyor 12, preferably at a<br>
production line rate. An exemplary line rate is preferably in the range of<br>
twenty seconds per component evaluated, whereas the actual process of<br>
acquiring an image of the surface of the component 1 takes approximately five<br>
to seven seconds. When the porosity inspection station 14 is prepared to<br>
receive and inspect the component 1, the workstation 10 controls feed<br>
conveyor 12 to move the component 1 into the porosity inspection station 14.<br>
The component 1 is moved thereto, and inspected, as described herein. When<br>
the inspection is complete, the workstation 10 controls the processing<br>
conveyor 16 to move the component to part shuttle 18. When the workstation<br>
10 determines the component 1 is acceptable, i.e. contains insufficient defects<br>
to warrant scrap or rework, the shuttle 18 moves the component to the<br>
production conveyor 20 for further processing. When the workstation 10<br>
determines the component 1 is unacceptable, i.e. contains sufficient defects<br>
requiring the component 1 to be scrapped or reworked, the shuttle 18 moves<br>
the component to the scrap conveyors 22, 24. The exemplary component 1 of<br>
this embodiment comprises a cast-aluminum block for an internal combustion<br>
engine having multiple cylinders.<br>
[0023]	Referring now to Figs. 2 - 4A, front-view, plan-view, and side-<br>
view schematic diagrams of the porosity inspection station 14 with the<br>
workstation 10 of the exemplary inspection system are described in detail.<br>
The porosity inspection station 14 includes a base 32, having a roller conveyor<br>
26 and a part elevator and inspection surface 28, and an inspection station 42 comprising a two-tiered camera/lighting scanning mast arrangement. The base<br>
32 has conventional roller conveyor 26 operable to move component 1 into<br>
position, wherein the component is elevated onto the inspection surface 28 for<br>
inspection. The component 1 is preferably placed on the inspection surface 28<br><br>
in a substantially correct position and orientation using the roller conveyor 26<br>
and the part elevator, including a part placement sensor (not shown), with the<br>
machined surface of interest for inspection suitably positioned for viewing by<br>
the two-tiered camera/lighting scanning mast arrangement 42. This is<br>
preferably accomplished using known conveying and positioning systems. A<br>
skilled practitioner is able to correctly place and orient a series of components<br>
in a predetermined location for inspection. The workstation 10 is operable to<br>
detect that each component 1 is in correction position for inspection, prior to<br>
executing any inspection algorithm. The base 32 includes a pair of bearing<br>
tracks 30, each track 30 running parallel to an axis 27 longitudinal to flow of<br>
components through the system 14. Inspection system 42 includes a<br>
precision-controlled transfer station, operable to tram the two-tiered<br>
camera/lighting scanning mast arrangement on the bearing tracks 30 and over<br>
the component 1 for inspection. Inspection system 42 comprises a pair of<br>
support masts 34, an upper tier 38 for mounting a camera 40, and a lower tier<br>
36 for mounting a lighting system 37, and has an enclosure 44 to visually<br>
enclose and shield at least a portion of the component from ambient light, to<br>
facilitate the vision inspection process. The support masts 34 comprise a pair of vertical support legs orthogonal to the inspection surface 28. The base of<br>
each of the support masts 34 is placed on one of the bearing tracks 30. In this<br>
configuration, the inspection system 42 is able to move across the bearing<br>
tracks 30, over the base with the inspection surface 28, to inspect each<br>
component 1 placed thereon.<br>
[0024]	The upper tier 38 comprises a horizontal beam attached to and<br>
supported by the support masts 34, and having fixturing to which the camera<br>
40 is mounted. The exemplary camera 40 comprises a digital, monochrome<br>
line-scan camera, having eight kilobyte (8K) resolution, with a 175 millimeter<br>
lens attached, and preferably located a range of 150 millimeters to 450<br>
millimeters from the surface of the inspected component 1. The camera 40<br>
preferably provides a minimum pixel resolution of four kilobytes, and a<br>
maximum square pixel size of ten microns by ten microns. The camera 40<br><br>
electrically signally interfaces to a first computer 50 in the workstation 10<br>
using an image acquisition card, preferably a PCI- or PXI-based frame grabber<br>
card (not shown).<br>
[0025]	The lower tier 36 comprises a horizontal beam attached to and<br>
supported by the support masts 34, and having fixturing to which the lighting<br>
system 37 is mounted. The lighting system 37 includes a light source (not<br>
shown) emitted in the direction of the inspected surface 28. The light source<br>
preferably comprises red diffuse light generated using an array of red light-<br>
emitting diodes ('LED'). Light emanating from the array of red LEDs is preferably passed through a corresponding array of fresnel lens to diffuse the<br>
light source projected onto the inspected component 1. The light system is<br>
preferably located so the emanating light is not directly orthogonal to the<br>
surface of the component, with the object being to create a visually discernible<br>
difference between a surface pore and the machined surface. Red light is<br>
preferably used when the inspected surface is machined aluminum, although<br>
other colors of the spectrum may be used when other metal material is to be<br>
inspected. The lighting system 37 includes a scanning slit 39 placed<br>
perpendicular to axis 27, and providing an opening at least the width of the<br>
component 1 positioned for inspection. Axis 27 defines a Y-dimension, and<br>
an X-dimension is defined to be orthogonal to the Y-dimension in a plane :<br>
defined by inspected surface 28, thus defining an XY coordinate system,<br>
which is discussed hereinafter. The upper tier 38 is preferably located above<br>
lower tier 36 in a manner to permit the camera 40 to capture an image of a<br>
portion of the inspected surface of the component 1 when it is positioned for<br>
inspection. The camera 40 is preferably positioned to capture an image of the<br>
component through the scanning slit 39 in the lighting system 37.<br>
[0026]	The exemplary workstation 10 comprises a rack-mountable<br>
stack including five computers 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, each said computer<br>
preferably having a single microprocessor device, each operable to function<br>
independently and concurrently. All five computers are mounted in a single<br>
cabinet or rack, and appropriately interconnected to accept input data from the <br><br>
camera 40, analyze the input data, render a decision on acceptability of the<br>
machined surface of the specific component being inspected, provide and store<br>
detailed statistical analysis of the input data for each component, and advance<br>
each component through the inspection station 14, either directly or through<br>
interaction with an operator. Computer 50 acquires input data from the<br>
camera 40 in form of a digital image of the machined surface of the<br>
component 1, as previously described; Computers 51, 52, and 53 process the<br>
image to a scaled image, analyze and invert the scaled image, and compare the<br>
image to a known, expected image of the surface, further analyze the scaled<br>
image and compare it to the inverted image to create a final image. Computer<br>
54 performs statistical analysis on the final image, outputs the statistical analysis results to one or mores screens for operator review, and provides<br>
coordination of graphical user interfaces ('GUI), the output of which includes<br>
viewing and workstation monitors. The GUIs are developed to meet the<br>
specific need of the individual application and the operators and engineers, as<br>
known to one skilled in the art, and not discussed in detail herein. The various<br>
systems and components are electrically connected using appropriately sized<br>
and shielded cables which conform to industry standards applicable to a<br>
manufacturing facility.<br>
[0027]	Computer 50 is signally electrically connected to an output of<br>
the line-scan camera 40. The camera 40 is operable to acquire an original,<br>
two-dimensional (in XY coordinates), digital, monochrome image of the machined surface of interest on the component 1, and communicate the image<br>
to computer 50. The original digital monochrome image comprises a series of<br>
pixels, each comprising a digitized representation of a portion of the machined<br>
surface of interest, and preferably having eight-bit grayscale resolution, i.e.<br>
ranging in value from 0 (black) to 255 (white), each pixel a square sized in the<br>
range of ten microns by ten microns.<br>
[0028]	Referring now to Fig. 5, a method to use a vision system to<br>
capture an image of the machined surface of the cast-metal component, to<br>
evaluate the image to identify and separate surface defects from design<br><br>
features, is described in detail. The method is preferably executed as one or<br>
more algorithms contained in one of the computers of the workstation 10. A<br>
skilled practitioner is generally able to design, develop, implement, and<br>
execute algorithms for application in a computer, in conjunction with external<br>
devices such as those described with reference to Figs. 1 - 4, and this process<br>
is not described in detail herein.<br>
[0029]	The method includes capturing and processing a digital image<br>
representative of the machine surface of component 1, using the<br>
aforementioned vision system described with reference to Figs. 1-4. This<br>
includes first acquiring the original pixelated image of the machined surface<br>
(Block 110), wherein each pixel comprises a digitized representation of a<br>
portion of the machined surface, as described hereinabove. The inspection<br>
station 42 moves along the pair of bearing tracks 30, parallel to the Y-axis, at a ,<br>
predetermined rate, with the lighting system 37 illuminating the surface of the<br>
inspected component 1. The camera 40 digitally captures a series of line-scan<br>
images of the component, each one pixel in length. When a complete original<br>
digital image of the machined surface of the component 1 is acquired, it is<br>
oriented and scaled to the aforementioned XY coordinate system, and has<br>
units of measure, preferably in millimeters, representative of the actual<br>
component being inspected (blocks 112, 114). The orientation and scaling is<br>
accomplished by employing pattern recognition methods combined with<br>
known design features of the machined surface. The known design features,<br>
include, for example, cylinder bores and bolt holes when the component 1<br>
comprises an engine block, and have been predetermined and preprogrammed .<br>
into at least one of the computers 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 for use as an element of<br>
algorithm execution. A series of regions of interest are predetermined and<br>
preprogrammed into the computer for use during component analysis. Each<br>
region of interest comprises a specific area of the machine surface being<br>
inspected, with corresponding image captured by the vision system. Each<br>
region of interest has a unique threshold level assigned thereto, useable when<br>
identifying surface defects (Block 116).<br><br>
[0030]	A series of operations are executed to identify surface defects<br>
in the inspected surface (Block 118). The imaging algorithm, designated as<br>
Threshold I through Math Operations I, (blocks 120 through 132) describes<br>
the steps executed to process the acquired image and separate the particles, in<br>
a binary form, to identify porosity defects in the inspected surface. The first<br>
portion of this process includes generating an inverted digital image of the<br>
machined surface. This preferably comprises analyzing each pixel of the<br>
original pixelated image relative to a cluster of pixels contiguous thereto;<br>
resolving each analyzed pixel to be either one of a digital "1" or digital "0",<br>
based upon the analysis of the original pixelated image and the cluster of<br>
pixels contiguous thereto; and, inverting each resolved analyzed pixel, as<br>
described hereinbelow.<br>
[0031]	Referring again to Fig. 5, a threshold I step is executed (Block<br>
120) wherein a clustering threshold operation is executed. The clustering<br>
threshold operation uses a statistical algorithm, comprised of known Gaussian<br>
analysis techniques, to convert each greyscale pixel to a digital zero value or a<br>
digital 255 value, thus resolving the acquired image into a binary image. A<br>
cluster of pixels contiguous to a specific pixel is analyzed. The value of the<br>
specific, centrally located pixel, is converted to either 0 (black) or 255 (white),<br>
based on the statistical analysis of the cluster. Each pixel in the acquired<br>
image is analyzed thusly.<br>
[0032]	A basic morphology I operation is executed (block 122),<br>
comprising an erosion function wherein small particles are filtered out of the<br>
acquired image, e.g. an individual pixel having a value of 255 surrounded by a<br>
large mass of pixels, each having a value of zero, is converted to a value of<br>
zero. This step is able to run several times during execution of the algorithm<br>
to clean the image and minimize the number of noisy objects in a specific<br>
region of interest, thus improving accuracy of the inspection process.<br><br>
[0033]	The image remaining after execution of the basic morphology I<br>
operation is inverted (block 124). This comprises changing each pixel value<br>
from zero to 255, or, alternatively, from 255 to zero. The result is an image<br>
that is digitally reversed from the input image, i.e. a digital equivalent of a<br>
photographic negative. The inverted image is stored in an image buffer,<br>
preferably in computer 52, for subsequent use (block 128).<br>
[0034]	In the advanced morphology step, a second image of the<br>
machined surface is generated, comprising eliminating the known design<br>
surface features from the inverted digital image (block 130). This comprises<br>
identifying the aforementioned known design features of the machine surface,<br>
using information stored in the computer 54. Identifiable large objects and<br>
border objects are removed, whereas known cavities, comprising, e.g. valve<br>
seats, guides, and holes, are 'filled in' in the image data file. Known edges are<br>
smoothed.<br>
[0035]	The math operation step (block 132) comprises comparing each<br>
pixel of the inverted digital image with a correspondingly located pixel of the<br>
second image. Pixel location is based upon the pixelated image oriented and<br>
scaled to the XY coordinate system, as previously described. The result of<br>
this action is to identify any surface feature, i.e. pores and other defects,<br>
common to the inverted digital image and the second image. The math<br>
operation step preferably comprises comparing each pixel of the inverted<br>
digital image with the correspondingly located pixel of the second image by<br>
executing a simple digital logic operation referred to as an Exclusive-OR<br>
(XOR) function. The resultant image from this operation is analyzed for<br>
conformance to predetermined quality standards.<br>
[0036]	Statistical particle analysis is performed on the resultant image.<br>
(Block 134). This comprises identifying the regions of interest in the original<br>
pixelated image of the machined surface, relative to the scaled XY coordinate<br>
system for the digital image (Block 136). A high detection threshold is<br>
employed for evaluating pores and identifying defects when the region of<br>
interest comprises a critical region of interest, thus identifying relatively small<br><br>
surface pores, typically in the range of 0.3 millimeters, to be identified as<br>
defects. A low detection threshold is employed for evaluating surface pores<br>
and identifying defects when the region of interest comprises a non-critical<br>
region of interest, thus requiring a pore to be relatively large, typically in the<br>
range of 2.0 millimeters, before being identified as a defect (Block 138). A<br>
critical region of interest for a machined surface of a cast metal component<br>
typically includes any region subjected to high levels of mechanical stress or<br>
thermal stress in-use. Typical regions include cylinder walls and edges, and<br>
gasket squish areas, i.e. areas at which gaskets are compressed on a typical<br>
engine block when a cylinder head (not shown) is assembled thereto.<br>
[0037]	The defects are identified and classified within each region of<br>
interest, comprising identifying location and magnitude of each surface defect<br>
within each region of interest, relative to the scaled XY coordinate system for<br>
the digital image (Block 140). Magnitude of each surface defect is classified<br>
based upon several analysis techniques, including defect or pore diameter,<br>
defect or pore area ratio, and defect XY location. The pore diameter is<br>
preferably defined as a diameter of the smallest circle able to completely<br>
circumscribe the identified pore, or defect, and is measured in millimeters.<br>
Pore area ratio comprises a calculation of a ratio between area of the circle<br>
defined by the pore diameter, and actual area of the identified pore, based<br>
upon pixels. As part of analysis, a high detection threshold for pore size is<br>
typically in the range of 0.3 millimeters when in a critical region of interest.<br>
Therefore, any pore having a diameter in excess of 0.3 millimeters is<br>
considered an identifiable defect in a region of interest near a cylinder wall, or<br>
near a gasket squish area and edge. Alternatively, a low detection threshold<br>
for pore size is typically in the range of 2.0 millimeters when in a non-critical<br>
region of interest. Therefore any pore having a diameter in excess of 2.0<br>
millimeters is considered an identifiable defect in a region of interest<br>
substantially away from a cylinder wall. Proximity of pores in each region of<br>
interest is important, and a typical threshold for minimum distance between<br>
pores is in the range of 3.0 millimeters (Block 142).<br><br>
[0038]	After defects have been identified and classified, they are<br>
analyzed by the computer 54. An estimate of defect density is calculated for<br>
each region of interest (Block 144). A histogram is generated, comprising a<br>
showing of quantity of defects by size for each region of interest and for the<br>
entire machined surface of the component. Other analyses are conducted<br>
involving estimating area ratio for each identified defect (block 148), and<br>
estimating area ratios of defects of each region of interest, adjusted for<br>
irregular shapes (block 150).<br>
[0039]	The defects are statistically analyzed and evaluation criteria are<br>
applied, and a decision is made whether to reject or accept the component<br>
being inspected (block 152). Statistical analysis is preferably provided using<br>
readily available software packages, known to a skilled practitioner, and not<br>
described in detail herein. The defects leading to rejection of a given part are<br>
physically marked on the part (block 154), and it is either scrapped or used in<br>
further analysis (block 156), as determinable by quality procedures in the<br>
manufacturing plant. The accepted parts are conveyed down the<br>
manufacturing line for further processing and assembly (block 158).<br>
[0040]	Referring now to Fig. 6, a second system and method to<br>
evaluate the machined surface of a cast-metal component, to identify and<br>
separate surface defects from design features, is described in detail. The<br>
hardware referred to with regard to Fig. 1 - 4 is unchanged, and a laser probe<br>
(not shown) is added to the two-tiered camera/lighting scanning mast<br>
arrangement of inspection station 42 and signally connected to the workstation<br>
10 for processing of the signal. The laser probe is operable to detect a depth<br>
of each detected surface defect. The method, as shown in Fig. 6, is in essence<br>
equivalent to the method detailed with regard to Fig. 5, with steps 160, 162<br>
added. The depth dimension, in the Z-dimension orthogonal to the XY-<br>
coordinate system, is input into the analysis as an added element to the<br>
classification of defects (blocks 162, 142). The evaluation criteria (block 152)<br>
determining whether to accept or reject a specific component may be adjusted,<br><br>
and this evaluation and decision making is determinable by a skilled<br>
practitioner.<br>
[0041]	The invention has been described with specific reference to the<br>
embodiments and modifications thereto. This includes any embodiment<br>
wherein the inspected component is moved under the camera, and alternative<br>
methods of acquiring the original image, e.g. using a multidimensional digital<br>
camera. Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon<br>
reading and understanding the specification. It is intended to include all such<br>
modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br><br>

common to both images is analyzed statistically for conformance to a<br>
threshold. A defect is identified as any identified surface feature common to<br>
both images which exceeds the threshold. The system moves the part for<br>
further processing if a statistical analysis of defects indicates an acceptable<br>
component, and alternatively, removes the part from further processing if the<br>
analysis indicates a flawed component.</td>
