				<td>The present  invention relates to compounds which act as DNA-PK inhibitors, their use and synthesis.<br>
The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated upon association with DNA.  Biochemical and genetic data have revealed this kinase to be composed of a large catalytic subunit, termed DNA-PKcs, and a regulatory component termed Ku.  DNA-PK has been shown to be a crucial component of both the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair machinery and the Y(D)J recombination apparatus.  In addition, recent work has implicated DNA-PK components in a variety of other processes, including the modulation of chromatin structure and telomere maintenance (Smith, G. C. M. and Jackson, S.P., Genes and Dev. 13: 916-934 (1999)).<br>
Human DNA is constantly under attack from reactive oxygen intermediates principally from by-products of the oxidative metabolism we have evolved for energy supply.  Reactive oxygen species are capable of producing DNA single-strand breaks and, where two of these are generated in close proximity, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) .  In addition, single- and double-strand breaks can be induced when a DNA replication fork encounters a damaged template, and are generated by exogenous agents such as ionising radiation (IR) and certain anti-cancer drugs (e.g. bleomycin) .  DSBs also occur as intermediates in site-specific V(D-)J recombination, a process that is critical for the generation of a functional vertebrate immune system. If DNA DSBs are left unrepaired or are repaired inaccurately, mutations and/or chromosomal aberrations are induced, which in turn may lead to cell death.  To combat the serious threats<br>
posed by DNA DSBs, eukaryotic cells have evolved several mechanisms to mediate their repair. In higher eukaryotes, the predominant of these mechanisms is DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), also known as illegitimate recombination. DNA-PK plays a key role in this pathway.<br>
Biochemical studies on DNA-PK revealed that it is activated most potently by DNA DSBs, suggesting that it might play a role in recognising DNA damage.  This stimulated investigations into the potential role of DNA-PKcs and Ku in DNA repair and led to the identification of cell lines which are radiosensitive due to mutations in DNA-PK components (Smith and Jackson, 1999).  Cloning of the DNA-PKcs cDNA revealed that it corresponds to a -470 kDa polypeptide, the N-<br>
V- â€¢<br>
terminal -3500 amino acid residues of which does not appear to have significant homology to other characterised proteins (Hartley, K.O., et al., Cell 82: 849-856 (1995)). More significantly, the C-terminal -500 amino acid residues of DNA-PKcs comprises a catalytic domain that falls into the PI 3-kinase family.  Although this initially suggested that DNA-PK might be capable of phosphorylating inositol phospho-lipids, like certain well-characterised members of the PI 3-kinase family (Toker, A. and Cantley, L.C., Nature 387: 673-676 (1997)), the available evidence indicates that DNA-PK has protein but not lipid kinase activity (Hartley et al. 1995; Smith et al., 1999).  At a similar time to the cloning of the DNA-PKcs cDNA, the genes and cDNAs for a range of other large PI 3-kinase like (PIKL) proteins were identified and cloned (Jackson, S.P., Cancer Surv. 28: 261-279 (1996)). These proteins have been shown to be involved in controlling transcription, the cell-cycle and/or genome stability in organisms from yeast to man.  DNA-PKcs appears to be restricted to higher eukaryotes.<br>
Besides DNA-PKcs, probably the best characterised member of the PIKL family is ATM, the protein deficient in the human neurodegenerative and cancer predisposition condition ataxia-telangiectasia I'A-T; Lavin, NI.F. and Shiloh,Y., Annu. Rev. Immunol, 15: 177-202 (1997)).  ATM has been linked intimately to che detection and signalling of DNA damage.<br>
It also has been previously found that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
is able to inhibit DNA-PK function in vitro (Izzard, R.A., et al., CaricerP.es. 59: 2581-2586 (1999)).  The IC50<br>
(concentration at which 50% of enzyme activity is lost) for LY294002 towards DNA-PK is, at ~luM, the same as that for PI 3-kinase.  Furthermore it has been shown that LY294002 is also able to weakly sensitise cells to the effects of IR<br>
(Rosenzweig, K.E., et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 3: 1149-1156<br>
(1999) ) .<br>
Given the involvement of DNA-PK in DNA repair processes, and that LY294002 has been shown to radiosensitise mammalian cells in culture, an application of (specific) DNA-PK inhibitory drugs would be to act as agents that will enhance the efficacy of both cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  DNA-PK inhibitors may also prove useful in the treatment of retroviral mediated diseases.  For example it has been demonstrated that loss of DNA-PK activity severely represses the process of retroviral integration {Daniel R, et al., Science, 284:644-7 (1999)).  DNA-PK inhibitors may also have<br>
potential as modulators of the immune system.  DNA-PK has also been shown to play an important role an telornere maintenance, and hence annibitors of DNA-PK may play a role in modulating telomere functions (Goytisolo, et al, Mol. Cell. Biol., 21:3642-3651 (2001).<br>
The present inventors have now discovered compounds which exhibit inhibition of DNA-PK; these compounds also exhibit selective inhibition of DNA-PK over the PI 3-kinase family members PI 3-kinase and ATM.<br>
Accordingly, the first aspect of the invention provides for the use of compounds of formula I:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and isomers,   salts,   solvates,   chemically protected forms,   and<br>
prodrugs thereof,   in the preparation of a medicament  for<br>
inhibiting the activity of DNA-PK,   wherein:<br>
R1  and R2  are   independently hydrogen,   an optionally substituted<br>
C1-7  alkyl  group,   C3-20 heterocyclyl  group,   or C5-20  aryl  group,<br>
or may together  form,   along with  the nitrogen atom to which<br>
they are  attached,   an optionally  substituted heterocyclic  ring<br>
having  from 4   to  8  ring atoms;<br>
X and Y are   selected from CR4  and 0,   0 and  CR' 4   and NR"4   and N,<br>
where   the  unsaturation  is   in the   appropriate place  in the<br>
ring, and where one of R3 and R4 or R'4 is an optionally substituted C3-20 heteroaryl or C5-20 aryl group, and the other of R2 and R3 or R, 4 is H, or R3 and R4 or R"4 together are -A-B-, which collectively represent a fused optionally substituted aromatic ring;<br>
except that when X and Y are CR4 and O, R3 and R4 together form a fused benzene ring, and R1 and R2 together with the N to which they are attached form a morpholino group, then the fused benzene does not bear as a sole substituent a phenyl substituent at the 8- position.<br>
Thus, the three different possibilities for X and Y results in compounds of formulae la, Ib and Ic: <br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
One aspect of the first aspect of the present invention relates to compounds of formulae Ia or Ib, where one R3 and R4 (or R'4) is a C3-20 heteroaryl or C5-20 aryl group, and the other of R3 and R4 (or R'4) is H.<br>
Another aspect of the first aspect of the present invention relates to compounds of formulae la and Ic, where R3 and R4 or R"4 together are -A-B-, which collectively represent a fused optionally substituted aromatic ring, with the proviso given above.<br>
It IE preferred that the medicament of the first aspect selectivity inhibits the activity of DNA-PK compared to PI 3-kinase and/or ATM.  Selectivity is an important issue as inhibition of other PI 3-kinase family members may lead to unwanted side-effects associated with the loss of function of those enzymes.<br>
A second aspect of the invention provides for the use of compounds as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for use as an adjunct in cancer therapy or for potentiating tumour cells for treatment with ionising radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
A third aspect of the invention provides for the use of compounds in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of retroviral mediated diseases or disease ameliorated by the inhibition of DNA-PK.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides an active compound as described herein for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides a method of inhibiting DNA-PK in vitro or in vivo, comprising contacting a cell with an effective amount of an active compound as described herein.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides novel compounds as described herein.<br>

Includes Other Forms<br>
Included in the above are the well known ionic, salt, solvate,<br>
and protected forms of these substituents.  For example, a<br>
reference to carboxylic acid (-COOJ-1) also includes the anionic (carboxylate) form (-COO), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventiunal protected forms.  Similarly, a reference to an arnino group includes the protonated form (-N4HR1R^) , a salt or solvate of the amino group, for example, a hydrochloride salt, as well as conventional protected forms of an ainirio group. Similarly, a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic form (-0"), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms of a hydroxyl group.<br>
Isomers, Salts, Solvates, Protected Forms, and Prodrugs Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, stereoisomeric, tautomeric , ' conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r- forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and 1-forms; ( + ) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; a- and (3-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as "isomers" (or "isomeric forms").<br>
Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term "isomers", as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space).  For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH3, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl.  However, a reference to a class of structures<br>
may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g., C3.7 alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).<br>
The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, atnide/imino alcohol, ami dine/ami dine , nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including 1H, 2H (D) , and 3H (T) ; C may be in any isotopic form, including 12C, 13C, and 14C; O may be in any isotopic form, including 160 and 1BO; and the 1 ike.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof.  Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g., fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.<br>
Unless   otherwise   specified,   a   reference   to  a  particular compound  also   includes   ionic,    salt,    solvate,    and  protected forms   of  thereof,    for  example,   as   discussed below.<br>
It may be   convenient   or  desirable   to prepare,   purify,   and/or handle   a  corresponding  salt  of   the   active   compound,   for example,   a pharmaceutically-acceptable   salt.      Examples   of pharmaceutically   acceptable  salts   are  discussed  in Berge   et al.,   1977,    "Pharmaceutically Acceptable   Salts",   J.   Pharm. Sci.,   Vol.   66 ,   pp.   1-19.<br>
For  example,   if   the   compound is  anionic,   or has  a   functional group which may be  anionic   (e.g.,   -COOH may be  -COO"),   then a salt may be  formed with a  suitable  cation.     Examples  of suitable  inorganic   cations  include,   but   are  not   limited  to, alkali  metal   ions   such as  Na4  and  1C",   alkaline  earth cations such  as  Ca2+  and  Mg2+,   and  other  cations   such as Al3"1".     Examples of  suitable organic  cations include,   but  are  not  limited to, ammonium ion   (i.e.,   NH4+)   and substituted ammonium  ions   (e.g., NHsR'4',   NH2R2+,   NHR3+,   NR/) .     Examples  of  some   suitable substituted ammonium ions  are  those  derived from:   ethylamine, diethylamine,   dicyclohexylamirie,   triethylamine,   butylamine, ethylenediamine,   ethanolamine,   diethanolamine,   piperazine, benzylamine,   phenylbenzylamine,   choline,   meglumine,   and tromethamine,   as well  as  amino acids,   such as  lysine  and arginine.     An example of  a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4+.<br>
If the  compound  is  cat ionic,   or has  a  functional  group which may be  cationic   (e.g.,   -NH2 may be  -NH3+) ,   then  a  salt may be formed with a suitable  anion.     Examples  of  suitable  inorganic anions   include,   but   are  not  limited to,   those   derived  from  the following  inorganic   acids:   hydrochloric,   hydrobromic,<br>
hydroiodic, sulphuric, sulphurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous.  Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: acetic, propionic, succiriic, glycolic, stearic, palmitic, lactic, malic, pamoic, tartaric, citric, gluconic, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, aspartic, benzoic, cinnamic, pyruvic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-acetyoxybenzoic, fumaric, phenylsulfonic, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, pantothenic, isethionic, valeric, lactobionic, and gluconic.  Examples of suitable polymeric anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound.  The term vsolvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g. active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent.  If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in a chemically protected form. The term "chemically protected form", as used herein, pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions, that is, are in the form of a protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group or a blocked or blocking group). By protecting a reactive functional group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group; the protecting group<br><br>
may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule.  See, for example. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green snd P. Wuuts, Wiley, 1995).<br>
For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=0)E), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (uriphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=O)CH3, -OAc).<br>
For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal or ketal, respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=0) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2)/ by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol.  The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
For example/ an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide or a urethane, for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3) ; a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5, -NH-Cbz) ; as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3) 3, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC (CH3) 2CeH4C6H5, -NH-Bpoc) , as a 9-f luorenylmethoxy amide (-NB-Fmoc) , as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide {-NH-Nvoc) , as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), as a 2(-phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec) ;, or, in suitable cases, as an N-oxide (&gt;NO$) .<br>
For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an C1-7 alkyl ester (e.g. a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester) ; a C1-7 haloalkyl ester (e.g., a C1-7<br><br>
trihaloalkyl ester);  a triCi.7 alkylsilyl -C1-7 alkyl ester; or a C5-20 aryl-C1-7 alkyl ester (e.g. a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide.<br>
For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC (=0) CH3) .<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in the form of a prodrug.  The term "prodrug", as used herein, pertains to a compound which, when metabolised (e.g. in vivo), yields the desired active' compound.  Typically, the prodrug is inactive, or less active than the active compound, but may provide advantageous handling, administration, or metabolic properties.<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g. a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester).  During metabolism, the ester group (-C(=0)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug.  Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=0)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.  Examples of such metabolically labile esters include those wherein R is C1-7 alkyl (e.g. -Me, -Et) ; C1-7 aminoalkyl (e.g. aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl; 2-(4-morpholino) ethyl) ; and acyloxy-C1-7 alkyl (e.g. acyloxymethyl; acyloxyethyl; e.g. pivaloyloxymethyl; acetoxymethyl; 1-acetoxyethyl; 1-(1-methoxy-l-methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxyethyl; 1-(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
cyclohexyioxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-cyclohexyloxy-carbonyioxyethyl; (4 -tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl ; 1- (4 - tetranydropyranyloxy) carbonyicxyethyl; (4 - tetrahydropyranyl) carbonyloxymethyl; and 1-(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethyl).<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound.  For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.<br>
Selective Inhibition<br>
Selective inhibition' means the inhibition of one enzyme to a greater extent than the inhibition of one or more other enzymes.  This selectivity is measurable by comparing the concentration of a compound required to inhibit 50% of the activity (IC50) of one enzyme against the concentration of the same compound required to inhibit 50% of the activity (IC50) of the other enzyme (see below).  The result is expressed as a ratio.  If the ratio is greater than 1, then the compound tested exhibits some selectivity in its inhibitory action.<br>
The compounds of the present invention preferably exhibit a selectivity of greater than 3, 10, 20 or 50 against DNA-PK over PI 3-kinase.<br>
The compounds of the present invention preferably exhibit a selectivity of greater than 5, 10, 50 or 100 against DNA-PK over ATM.<br>
It is preferred that the IC50s used to determine selectivity are determined using the methods described herein.<br>

Synthesis Routes<br>
Compounds as described in the first aspect of the invention car; be synthesised by a number of methods, examples of some of which are given below.<br>
Broadly, the synthetic strategy involves performing a cyclisation to form the central core followed by a coupling reaction such as a Suzuki reaction to add substituents to the core structure.<br>
The key step in most of these synthesis routes is the formation of the central aromatic ring; this can be accomplished in numerous ways, as shown below, and include condensative cyclisation.<br>
In many cases appropriate substitution can be present in the starting materials, although example of the further derivation of end products is also given.<br>

The active compound or pharmaceutical composition comprising the active compound may be administered to a subject by any convenient route of administration, whether systemically/ peripherally or at the site of desired action, including but not limited to, oral (e.g. by ingestion); topical (including e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual); pulmonary (e.g. by inhalation or insufflation therapy using, e.g. an aerosol, e.g. through mouth or nose); rectal; vaginal; parenteral, for example, by injection, including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, subcuticular, intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrasternal;<br>
by  implant   of   a depot,    for   example,    subcutaneously   or intramuscularly.<br>
The   subject   may be   a   eukaryote,    an   animal,   a  vertebrate animal,   a  mammal,   a  rodent    (e.g.   a  guinea pig,   a  hamster,   a rat,   a  mouse) ,   murine    (e.g.   a  mouse) ,   canine   (e.g.   a  dog) , feline    (e.g.   a   cat) ,   equine   (e.g.   a horse) ,   a  primate,    simian (e.g.   a  monkey or  ape) ,   a  monkey   (e.g.   marmoset,   baboon) ,   an ape   (e.g.   gorilla,   chimpanzee,   orang-utan,   gibbon),   or  a human.<br>
Formulations<br>
While   it  is  possible   for the  active   compound to  be administered  alone,    it  is  preferable  to present   it   as   a pharmaceutical  composition   (e.g.   formulation)   comprising  at least  one  active  compound,   as  defined above,   together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable  carriers,   adjuvants, excipients,   diluents,   fillers,   buffers,   stabilisers, preservatives,   lubricants,   or  other materials  well  known  to those  skilled in the  art  and optionally other therapeutic  or prophylactic  agents.<br>
Thus,   the present  invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions,   as  defined above,   and methods  of  making a pharmaceutical composition  comprising admixing  at  least  one active   compound,   as  defined above,   together with  one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,   excipients,   buffers, adjuvants,   stabilisers,   or other materials,   as  described herein.<br>
The term  "pharmaceutically acceptable"   as used herein pertains to  compounds,   materials,   compositions,   and/or  dosage  forms which  are,   within the  scope of   sound medical  judgement,<br>
suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human; without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.  Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
Suitable carriers, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990.<br>
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.  Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.  In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product.<br>
Formulations may be in the form of liquids, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, syrups, tablets, losenges, granules, powders, capsules, cachets, pills, ampoules, suppositories, pessaries, ointments, gels, pastes, creams, sprays, mists, foams, lotions, oils, boluses, electuaries, or aerosols.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration (e.g. by ingestion) may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution   or   suspension   in   an   aqueous   or   non-aqueous   liquid;   or as  an   oil-in-water   liquid   emulsion   or   a  water- in-oil   liquid emulsion;   as   a   bolus;   as   an   electuary;   or   as   a  paste.<br>
A tablet  may  be made  by  conventional  means,    e.g.,    compression or moulding,   optionally with  one  or  more  accessory ingredients.      Compressed  tablets  may be  prepared  by compressing   in  a   suitable  machine   the   active   compound  in  a free-flowing   form  such  as   a  powder  or  granules,   optionally mixed  with  one   or more  binders   (e.g.   povidone,   gelatin, acacia,   sorbitol,   tragacanth,   hydroxypropylmethyl   cellulose); fillers  or  diluents    (e.g.   lactose,   microcrystalline  cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate);   lubricants   (e.g.   magnesium stearate,   talc,   silica);   disintegrants   (e.g.   sodium starch glycolate,   cross-linked povidone,   cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl   cellulose);   surface-active  or  dispersing or wetting agents   (e.g.   sodium lauryl   sulfate);   and preservatives (e.g.   methyl  p-hydroxybenzoate,   propyl  p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic   acid) .     Moulded  tablets may be made by moulding  in  a suitable machine  a mixture of  the powdered compound moistened with an inert  liquid diluent.     The  tablets may optionally be coated or  scored and may be formulated so  as  to provide  slow or controlled release  of  the active  compound therein using, for example,   hydroxypropylmethyl  cellulose  in varying proportions to provide  the  desired release profile.     Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric  coating,   to provide release  in parts  of  the  gut  other  than the  stomach.<br>
Formulations   suitable   for  topical   administration    (e.g. transdermal,   intranasal,   ocular,   buccal,   and sublingual)   may be  formulated as  an ointment,   cream,   suspension,   lotion, powder,   solution,   past,   gel,   spray,   aerosol,   or  oil. Alternatively,   a   formulation may  comprise   a  patch   or  a<br>
dressing such ae a bandage or adhesive plaster impregnated with active compounds and optionally one or .-more excipients or diluents.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include losenges comprising the active compound in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active compound in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active compound in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active compound is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active compound. <br>
Formulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 Â£o about 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to., the nose.  Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as, for example, nasal spray Â£ nasal drops, or by aerosol administration by nebuliser, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active compound.<br>
Formulations suitable for administration by inhalation include those presented as an aerosol spray from a pressurised pack, with the use of a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichoro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration via the skin include ointments, creams, and emulsions.  When formulated in an ointment, the active compound may optionally be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active compounds may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.  If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least about 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof.  The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active compound through the skin or other affected areas.  Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogues.<br>
When formulated as a topical emulsion, the oily phase may optionally comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), or it may comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophllic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabiliser.  It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat.  Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabiliser(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and/or fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
Suitable emulgents and emulsion stabilisers include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulphate.  The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on<br>
achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations may be very low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers.  Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters.  These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required.<br>
Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active compound, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, including cutaneous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) , include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers,<br>
bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-agaeouE sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents, and liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are designed to target the compound to blood components or one or more organs. Examples of suitable isotonic vehicles for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection.  Typically, the concentration of the active compound in the solution is from about 1 ng/ml to about 10 pg/ml, for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 ug/ml.  The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.  Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets.  Formulations may be in the form of liposomes or other microparticulate systems which' are designed to target the active compound to blood components or one or more organs.<br>
Dosage<br>
It will be appreciated that appropriate dosages of the active compounds, and compositions comprising the active compounds, can vary from patient to patient.  Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects of the treatments of the present invention.  The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular<br>
compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration 01 the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, and the age, sex, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient.  The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, although generally the dosage will be to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.<br>
Administration in vivo can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g. in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell being treated, and the subject being treated.  Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.<br>
In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 pg to about 250 rag per kilogram body weight of the subject per day.  Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to ,be used is increased proportionately.<br>

Synthesis of starting material<br>
5,6,7, 8-Tetrahydro-l-hydroxy-2-naph.th.oie acid.<br>
A mixture of 5 , 6 , 7 , 8-tetrahydro-l-naphthol (7.42 g, 50 mmol) and potassium carbonate (25.5 g, 185 mmol) were placed in a glass tube inside a stainless steel pressure reactor.  The reactor was charged with C02 at 40 bar and then heated to 145Â°C.  The pressure rose to 60 bar and then slowly dropped to 20 bar over the 3 day reaction period.  The bomb was cooled and the solid product was taken up in water (-500 ml) and acetone (-500 ml) .  The mixture was evaporated in vacuo to remove the acetone and then washed with DCN (3 x 150 ml) .  The aqueous was acidified with 2M hydrochloric acid to give a white suspension.  This was extracted with DCM (4 x 250 ml) , which was then dried over sodium sulphate and evaporated in vacuo to give the crude product.  This was recrystallised from aqueous ethanol and dried under high vacuum to provide 8.64 g (45 mmol, 90% yield) of the title compound as a pale brown powder.  1H NMR (200 MHz., d6-DMSO)  Î´  1.81 (4H, m) ; 2.67 (2H, m) ; 2.81 (2H, m) ; 6.73 (1H, d) ; 7.61 (1H, d) ; 11.78 (1H, bs) .

The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then poured onto ice-water (200 ml) .  The mixture was extracted into DCM ( 100 ml).  The organic extract was washed with 2N HC1, water, and was evaporated in vaccuo to give a brown residue which was used without further purification.<br>
(iii) 2-Methyl-4-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-morpholine<br>
Sodium hydroxide (0.91 g, 0.02 mol) suspended in methanol (15 ml) was added to a stirred solution of  Toluene-4-sulfonic acid 2- [ (2-hydroxy-propyl)-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-amino]-ethyl<br>
ester (9.69 g, 0.02 mol) in DCM (15 mi).  After 1 h, water (50ml) was added to the solution.  The organic layer was collected, dried over sodium sulphate and evaporated in vaccuo to yield a green oily residue.  This was purified by chromatographic separation (20% Ethyl acetate : petrol) to yield the title compound as a white solid.  (1.70 g, 6.66 ramol, 33%).<br>
(iv) 2-Methyl morpholine<br>
2-Methyl-4-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-morpholine (1.65g, 6.51 mmol) was dissolved in warm pentanol ( 30 ml) .  The solution was cooled to room temperature and sodium ( 1.49 g, 65 mmol) was added in small portions.  The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously and heated to reflux for 3 h.  Upon cooling, water (50 ml) was added.  The two layers were separated, the aqueous layer was extracted with ether, and this in turn was extracted with 2N HCl.  The alcoholic soution was extracted with 2N HCl. The combined acidic solutions were then made alkaline by addition of sodium hydrogen carbonate, and continuously extracted with ether.  The ether was evaporated irr vaccuo to yield the title compound as a colourless oil. (0.517 g, 5.11 minol, 79%)  ZH NMR (200 MHz, CDC13) Î´1.15 (3H, d) ; 2.74 (5H, m) ; 3.81 (4H, m) .<br>

Biological Examples<br>
DNA-PK inhibition<br>
In order to assess the inhibitory action of the compounds against DNA-PK in vitro, the following assay was used to determine IC50 values.<br>
Mammalian DNA-PK, isolated from Hela cell nuclear extract (Cell, D. and Jackson S.P., .Nucleic Acids Res. 27:3494-3502 (1999)), was incubated with Z buffer (25 mM Hepes (Sigma); 12.5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma); 50 mM KCl (Sigma); lmM DTT (Sigma); 10% Glycerol (Sigma); 0. 1% NP-40 (Sigma); pH 7.4) in polypropylene 96 well plates and varying concentrations of inhibitor added. All compounds were diluted in DMSO to give a final assay concentration of between 10 and 0.001 uM, with DMSO being at a final concentration of 1% per well.  The total assay volume per well was 40 Âµl.<br>
After 10 minutes of incubation at 30Â°C the reactions were initiated by the addition of Na-ATP (50uM final) , 33P-yATP and a 30mer double stranded DNA oligonucleotide (l0ng/yl) in a volume of l0Âµl.  Designated positive and negative reaction wells were done in combination with compound wells (unknowns) in order to calculate % enzyme activities. The plates were then shaken for 2 minutes and incubated at 30Â°C for 45 minutes,<br>
Following the incubation, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 ui 30% acetic acid to each well. The plates were then shaken for 5 minutes and the contents of each plate (80 Âµl from each well) transferred over to a 96 well Polyfiltronics filtration plate, containing P81-phosphocellulose membrane (TRADE MARK)(Whatman, UK).  The solutions were vacuum pumped through the membrane and each well membrane washed four times using 300 ul of 15% acetic acid.  The well membranes were then air dried and 20 yl of scintillant was added to each well.<br>
The plates were transferred to a TopCount NXT (TRADE MARK) (Packard, UK) for scintillation counting. Values recorded are counts per minute (cpm) following a 1 minute counting time for each well.<br>
The enzyme activity for each compound is then calculated using the following equation: <br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
The results are detailed below in Table 1 as IC50 values (the concentration at which 50% of the enzyme activity is inhibited) . These are determined over a range of different concentrations, normally from 10 ÂµM down to 0.01 ÂµM. Such IC50 values are used as comparative values to identify increased compound potencies.  LY294002 exhibited an IC50 of 1.5 ÂµM.<br>
Enhancement .Rat10<br>
The Enhancement Ratio (ER) is a ratio of the enhancement of cell growth inhibition elicited by the DNA-PK inhibitor after 2 Grays of irradiation compared to untreated control cells.<br>
DNA-PK  inhibitors   were   used   at   a   fixed   concentration  of   25 micromolar.      Radiation  was   delivered   by   a  Faxitron  43855D  X-ray  system at   a  dose  rate   of   1Gy per  minute       The   Enhancement ratio   at 2  Gy  irradiation  was   calculated  from the   formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Cell growth was assessed using the sulforhodamine E (SRB) assay (Skehan, P., Storung, R., Scudiero, R. , Monks, A., McMahon, J. , Vistica, D., Warren, J. T., Bokesch, H., Kenny, S. and Boyd, M. R. (1990) New colorimetric cytotoxicity assay for anticancer-drug screening.  J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82:1107-1112) .  400 HeLa cells were seeded into each well of a flat-bottomed 48-well microtiter plate in a volume of 200 pi and incubated for 6 h at 37Â°C.  Cells were either replaced with media alone or with media containing DNA-PK inhibitor at a final concentration of 25 ÂµM.  Cells were allowed to grow for a further 1 h before irradiation or mock irradiation.  Cells untreated with DNA-PK inhibitor or unirradiated were used as a control.  Cells treated with DNA-PK inhibitor alone were used to assess the growth inhibition by the DNA-PK inhibitor.<br>
Cells were left for a further 16 h before replacing the media and allowing the cells to grow for a further 6 days at 37Â°C. The media was then removed and the cells fixed with 200Âµl of ice cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid.   The plates were incubated at 4Â°C for 20 minutes and then washed four times with water.  Each well of cells was then stained with 200Âµ1 of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid for 20 minutes before washing four times with 1% acetic acid.  Plates were then dried for 2 h at room temperature. 'The dye from the stained cells was solubilized by the addition of l00Âµl of l0mM Tris Base into each well.  Plates were gently shaken and left at room<br>
temperature for 30 minutes before measuring the optical density at 564nM on a Microquant microtiter plate reader.<br>
The results are detailed below in table 2.  LY294002 exhibited an Enhancement Ration of 1.09.<br>
PI 3-kinase inhibition<br>
In order to assess the inhibitory action of the compounds against PI 3-kinase in vitro, the following assay was used to determine IC50 values.<br>
Baculoviral recombinant GST-fused PI 3-kinase (pllOa/p85a) was purified from Sf9 insect cells using GSH-sepharose affinity chromatography as described (Wymann, M. T et al. , (1996) Wortmannin inactivates phosphoinositide 3-kinase by covalent modification of Lys-802, a residue involved in the phosphate transfer reaction. Mol. Cell Biol. 16:1722-1733).  PI 3-kinase (1 yl)  was diluted in reaction buffer (89 pi of 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM Sodium Orthovanadate, containing 20 yg of phosphatidylinositol) and varying concentrations of inhibitor compound added.  All compounds were diluted in DMSO to give a final assay concentration of beween 100 and 0.1 uM, with DMSO being at a final concentration of 1%.  After 10 minutes of incubation at 37Â°C the reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 pi of 50 yM Na-ATP, 20 mM MgCl2 and 2.5 yCi 33p-yATP.   Reactions were incubated for a further 20 minutes at 37Â°C, before quenching with the addition of 400 pi of chloroform/methanol (1:1) .  Reactions were acidified by the addition of 200 Âµl of 1M HCl, before separation of the organic and aqueous phases by centrifugation at 10,000g for 30 seconds.  The organic phase was transferred to a fresh tube and washed twice with 150 Âµl of 1M hydrochloric acid/methanol (1:1), discarding the aqueous phase.  The washed reaction<br>
product was then placed in a white 96-well plate with lOOpl of scintillation fluid and transferred to a TopCount NXT for scintillation counting.  Counts per minute, following a one minute counting time, were recorded for each reaction.  The inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity by compounds was calculated as described above for the DNA-PK assay.<br>
The selectivity was determined by the following equation:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The results are detailed below in table 3.  294 exhibited an IC5C of 1.5 ÂµM, and a A(DNA-PK/PI 3-K) of 1.<br>
ATM inhibition<br>
In order to assess the inhibitory action of the compounds against ATM in vitro, the following assay was used to determine IC5D values.<br>
ATM protein was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell nuclear extract using rabbit polyclonal antisera raised to the C-terminal -500 amino-acid residues of the human ATM protein. The immunoprecipitation was performed according to the methodology described by Banin, S. et al. (1998) Enhanced phosphorylation of p53 by ATM in response to DNA damage. Science 281:1674-1677.  10 pi of immunoprecipitated ATM in Buffer C (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 6 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 4 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) was added to 32.5 Âµl of buffer C containing 1 ug of the ATM substrate GSTp53N66 in a V-bottomed 96 well polypropylene plate.  The GSTp53N66 substrate is the amino terminal 66 amino acid residues of human wild type p53 fused to glutathione S-transferase.  ATM phosphorylates p53 on the<br>
residue serine 15 (Banin, S. et al. (1998) Enhanced phosphorylation of p53 by ATM in response to DNA damage. Science 2Si.1674-1677).  Varying concentrations of inhibitor were then added.  All compounds were diluted in DMSO to give a final assay concentration of beween 100 and 1 ÂµM, with DMSO being at a final concentration of 1%.  After 10 minutes of incubation at 37Â°C, the reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 pi of 50 uM Na-ATP.  After 1 h with shaking at 37 Â°C, 150 Âµl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was added to the reaction and the plate centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes.  5 Âµl of the reaction was then transferred to a 96 well opaque white plate containing 45 Âµl of PBS to allow the GSTp53N66 substrate to bind to the plate wells.  The plate was covered and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with shaking before discarding the contents.  The plate wells were washed twice by the addition of PBS prior to the addition of 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with shaking before discarding the contents and washing twice with PBS.  To the wells, 50 pi of a 1:10, 000 dilution of primary phosphoserine-15 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, #9284L) in 3% BSA/PBS was added to detect the phosphorylation event on the serine 15 residue of p53 elicited by the ATM kinase.  After 1 h of incubation at room temperature with shaking, the wells were washed four times with PBS prior to the addition of an anti-rabbit HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce, 31462) with shaking for 1 h at room temperature.  The wells were then washed four times with PBS before the addition of chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Renaissance, NEL105).  The plate was then shaken briefly, covered with a transparent plate seal and transferred to a TopCount NXT for chemiluminescent counting.  Counts per second, following a one second counting time, were recorded for each reaction.  The inhibition of ATM activity by<br>
compounds was   calculated   as   described  above   for  the  DNA-PK assay.<br>
The  selectivity was   determined by   the   following   equation:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The results are detailed below in table 4.  294 exhibited an ICso of &gt;100 ÂµM, and a A (DNA-PK/ATM) of &gt;67.<br>
All the compounds showed activity in DNA-PK inhibition, exhibiting an IC50 of less than about 12 ÂµM and/or % inhibition at 1 ÂµM of more than about 22%.<br>
Selected compounds and their IC50 values are listed in table 1.<br>
