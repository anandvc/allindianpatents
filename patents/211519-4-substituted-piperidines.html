"4-SUBSTITUTED PIPERIDINES"<br>
FAES, FABRICA ESPANOLA DE PRODUCTOS QUIMICOS Y FARMACEUTICOS, S.A., a Spanish company of Maximo Aguirre, No. 14, 48940-Lejona, Vizcaya, Spain,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
Original 18 JUL 2007 18-07-2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to 4-substituted piperidines.<br>
Introduction<br>
In recent years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have started to be used for treating 5      depression and other central nervous system disorders, noteworthy among which are fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline and paroxetine. They all have different chemical structures, which helps to explain   their   different   metabolic   and   pharmacokinetic   profiles,   their   performance   as antidepressants compares with rhar of classic tricyclic compounds, but their advantage is that they are safer and better tolerated. 10      The present invention relates to a number of new 4-substituted piperidines having an aryloxy functionality and potently inhibiting serotonin and/or noradrenaline reuptake, as a result :6f their " .      high affinity for their neuronal transporters. This characteristic provides" them with an enhanced antidepressant potential in human therapy. Other potential dierapeutic applications of these compounds are treatment of nervous bulimia, alcohol addiction, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive 15      disorders, panic, pain, pre-menstrual syndrome and social phobia, as well as migraine prophylaxis. Bibliography also describes other piperidine derivatives with aryloxy functionality as potential antidepressants, albeit with a chemical nature differing essentially from those claimed"herein, since the piperidine is substituted at- the 3-position. That is for instance the case of such compounds as 3-[(2-merhoxyphenoxy)phenyl]methyl-piperidine I (Melloni, P., Carniel, G., Delia 20      Torre, A-, Bonsignalari. A.. Buonamici, M., Pozzi, O., Ricciardi, S., Rossi, A.C. Eur. J, Med Chem. Chim. Ther. 1984, 3, 235-242; Melloni, P., Delia Torre, A., De Munari, Si, Merohf, M, Tonani, R. Gazena Chimica Italiana 19S5,  115,   159-163)  and 3-[(phenoxy)phenyl]methyl-piperidine 2 (FR 2,0I0,6"15 CA73; 66442J; GB 1,203,140 CA73: 120509b). In these compounds, the substitution of the piperidine ring at the 3-position results in an additional chiral centre. The 25      presence of the two chiral centres results in diastereomeric mixtures, which is the form in which the preparation of these compounds<br><br><br><br>
50<br><br>
has been described. The preparation and/or isolation of pure enantiomers is not described in any 35      case. However, the compounds claimed in the present specification possess a single chiral centre,<br>
2<br><br>
since they have the piperidine ring substituted at the 4-position, They have been prepared as racemic mixtures and as pure enantiomers, using synthetic methods differing from those used in preparing 1 and 2<br>
Moreover, other piperidine derivatives having aryloxy functionality and the piperidine ring substituted at the 4-position have been described as potential antidepressants (formulae 3 and 4). Thus, in the case of 3 type compounds (JP 96 40,999 CA124: 343333n),<br>
the arytoxy group is directly joined ro die piperidine ring, whereas in the 4 type compounds (JP 96 40,999 CAI24: 343333nJ said group is joined to the piperidine ring trough a. methylene group which has no further substitutions. The compounds described herein differ largely from those, since they have the aryloxy group joined to the piperidine ring through a methylene group wherein, in all cases, one of the methylene group"hydrogens is substituted by an aryl group, substituted or not, as defined hereinafter. These compounds arc therefore structurally different from the 3 and 4 rypes and the synthetic methodology used in preparing the same is"also absolutely different.<br>
The present invention is novel and inventive over Chemical Abstracts 106: 213767z and<br>
JP-A-61/227565.<br>
Description<br>
The new 4-substirude piperidines described in the present invention are represented by general formula (I), in which groups R, and R2 are non-substituted aryl radicals or aryl radicals mono- or poly-substituted with halogen (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine), alkyl, alkoxy, cyano, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoromethyl, benzoyl, phenyl, nitro, amino, a"minoalkyl, aminoaryl and carbonylamino. <br>
The compounds of genera] formula (I) have an .asymmetric centre and have been prepared as racemic mixtures and as pure enantiomers. The present invention includes all optical isomers of the compounds of general formula (J) and racemic mixtures thereof.<br><br><br>
The racemic compounds of general formula (7) were prepared using well-known synthetic methods starting with the compounds of general formula (II). 5 Formation of the alkylarylether group was carried out using the Mitsunobu reaction (Mitsunobu, 0. Synthesis 1981, 1; Hughes, D.L. Organic Reactions 42, 335) with phenols RrOH, in which R2 is an aryl radical, substituted or not, as described for general formula (I), and the compounds of general formula (II), in which R, is an aryl radical, substituted or not as described for general formuJa (I), and Rj is hydrogen or R,, which is an alkoxycarbonyl radical, preferably 10      ethoxycarbonyl and t-butoxycarbonyl.<br><br><br>
15<br><br><br>
The alkylarylether group was also prepared using an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction (Berglund, R.A. Org. Proc. Res. Dev. 1997 1, 32S-330) with the compounds of general formula (IT) defined above, arid the fluorinated derivatives Rj-F, in which R3 is an aryl radical mono- or poly-substituted  with  halogen  (fluorine,  chlorine,  bromine,   iodine),  allcyl.   alkoxy,  cyano, 20      trifluoromethoxy, trifluoromefhyl, benzoyl, phenyl, nitro, amino,  aminoalkyl, aminoaiyl and carbonylamino. The compounds of general formula (11) were prepared  using conventional synthetic methods-, starring with the compounds of general formula (III) (Duncan,; R.L., Helsley, G.C.. Welstead, WJ, DaVanzo, J.P., Funderburk, W.H., Lunsford, CD. J. Med Chem. 1970, 15 (1), 1), in which R5 is an acetyl radical, ethoxycarbonyl and R<s is cyano or carboxy.></s>
(TO)<br>
The compounds of general formula (III) defined above were transformed into the compounds of 30      general formula (IV), in which R| is an aryl radical, substituted or not,<br>
* * J<br><br>
■<br>
as described for the compounds of general formula (I), and R1 is hydrogen, acetyl or R4, which is an alkoxycarbonyl radical, preferably ethoxycarbonyl and t-butoxycarbonyl. Such transformation was made using two reaction types: a) a Friedel-Crafts reaction of the acid chlorides derived from the compounds of general formula (HI), in which R5 is an acetyl or ethoxycarbonyl and R4 is 5 carboxy (Duncan, R.L., Helsley, G.C., Welstead, W.J., DaVanzo, J.P., Funderburk, W-H Lunsford, CD. J. Med. Chem. 1970, 13 (1), 1) with benzene or conveniently functionalised derivatives thereof; or b) a Grignard reactive addition reaction, prepared from conveniently funtiionansed ary\ halides, to compounds of general formla (III) in Which R1 is acetyl, ethoxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl and R« is cyano (Duncan, R.L., Helsley, G.C., Welstead,<br>
10 W.J., DaVanzo, J.P., Funderburk, W.H., Lunsford, CD. J. Med. Chem. 1970, 13 (1), I). Reduction of the compounds of general formula (IV) described provides the general formula (IT) alcohols defined above.<br>
The enantiomers composing the racemic mixtures of general formula (I) were obtained using two different pathways: a) resolution of the corresponding racemic mixture by split crystallisation of<br>
15 the diaslereomeric salts prepared with chiral acids (D or L-dibenzoyltartaric, D or L-tartaric, D or L-di- p-toluyltartaric and D or L-mandclic) and b) enantioselective synthesis. In the latter case, the enantiomers of general formula (I) were obtained by reacting phenols R2-OH or the fluorinated aromatic derivatives R2-F defined above, with the enantiomers of the general formula (II) alcohols, as described for the racemic mixtures of general formula (I). In the enantiomers of the<br>
20 general formula (II) alcohols, R1 is an aryl radical, substituted or not, as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), and R3 is hydrogen or R4, which is an alkoxycarbonyl radical, preferably ethoxycarbonyl and t-butoxycarbonyl. The enantiomers of the general formula (II) alcohols defined above were obtained by enantioselective reduction (Ramachandran, P.V., Teodorovic, A.V., Rangaishenvi, M.V., Brown, H.C. J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 2379-2386) of the<br>
25      compounds of general formula (fV) (Duncan, R.L., Helsley, G.C., Welstead, W.J., DaVanzo. J.P., Funderburk, W.H., Lunsford, CD- J- Med. Chem. 19707 13(1), 1), in which R1 is an aryl radical, substituted or not as defined for-the compounds of general formula (I), and R1 is hydrogen or R4, defined above. The pharmacological activity of the compounds of general formula (I) was determined using well-<br>
30 established in vitro and in vivo pharmacological processes. The affinity of the compounds for the serotonin reuptake receptors (SHT) was evaluated in full rat cerebral cortex, using [3H]-paroxetine as radioligand (Habert, E., Graham, D., Tahraoui, L., Claustre, Y., Langcr, S.Z. Eur J. Pharmacol. 1985, 118, 107-114) yielding Ki values ranging between 0.5 and 500 nmol/1. The affinity of the compounds for noradrenaline (NA) reuptake receptors was evaluated in full rat cerebral cortex,<br>
35      using [H]-nisoxetine as radioligand (Tejani-Butt, S.M, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992, 260, 1,<br>
29-oct-1999 22:08	+34 915566SS7	98%	P.<br><br>
427-436), yielding Ki values ranging between 1 and 500 nmol/1. The following were used as assays predicting antidepressant activity: mouse tail suspension (Stem, L., Chermat, R., Thierry, B., Mico, J.A., Lenegre, A., Steru, M., Simon, P., Porsolt, R.D. Prog. Neurophsychopharmacol. Biol Psychiat, 1987, 11, 659-671), rat or mouse desperate behaviour (Porsolt, R.D., Anton, G., Blavet, N., Jalfre, M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1978, 48, 379-394) and enhancing rat yohimbine induced lethality (Quinton, R.M., Brit J. Pharacol. 1963, 21, 51-66). The compounds with Ki ranging between 0.5 and 40 nmol/1, for one of the transporters or for both, displayed an excellent antidepressant activity in the three models when administered within the 1 to 30 mg/Kg range orally, intraperitoneally or subcutaneously.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided 4-substituted piperidines, of general formula (I), in which Ri and R2 are non-substituted aryl radicals or aryl radicals mono- or poly-substituted with halogen (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine), alkyl, alkoxy, cyano, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoromethyl, benzoyl, phenyl, nitro, amino, aminoalkyl, aminoaryl and carbonylamino, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts with inorganic acids and organic acids of the kind such as herein described.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is also provided pharmaceutical compositions containing a therapeutically effective quantity of a compound of general formula (I) comprised between lmg and 200 mg, mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, to be orally, parenterally and topically administered.<br>
