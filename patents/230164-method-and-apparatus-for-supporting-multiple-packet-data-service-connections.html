				<td>A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPORTING<br>
MULTIPLE PACKET DATA SERVICE CONNECTIONS<br>
Reference(s) to Related Application(s)<br>
The present application claims priority from provisional application,<br>
Serial No. 60/431,556, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR<br>
SUPPORTING MULTIPLE PACKET DATA SERVICE CONNECTIONS,"<br>
filed December 6, 2002, which is commonly owned and incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for supporting<br>
multiple packet data service connections and, in particular, to supporting multiple<br>
packet data service connections.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
IS-2000 requires a mobile requesting the setup of a packet d ata<br>
application requiring multiple service instances to originate each of the<br>
services instances sequentially. If a traffic channel has not been assigned<br>
to a mobile, the mobile will first send an Origination Message (ORM) to<br>
the base station (BS) followed by an Enhanced Origination Message<br>
(EOM) for each of the additional service instances required to support the<br>
application. If a traffic channel has already been assigned to a mobile,<br>
the mobile sends an EOM for each of the additional service instances<br>
required to support the application.<br><br>
For reconnection of a packet data application that is dormant, IS-<br>
2000 allows a mobile to request the reactivation of a single packet data<br>
service instance by including the service reference identifier (i.e., the<br>
SR_ID) for the service instance in the ORM/EOM, or the mobile may<br>
request reactivation of all dormant service instances in the mobile by<br>
setting the SR_ID field to "7" (per IS-2000-C). If the mobile requires the<br>
reactivation of more than one, but not all dormant service instances in the<br>
mobile, the mobile is required to send multiple ORM/EOM, one for each of<br>
the dormant service instances required by the packet data application.<br>
Moreover, when a handoff is required for dormant packet data<br>
service instances, IS-2000 requires the mobile to send multiple<br>
ORM/EOM to the BS to request a handoff for each of the dormant service<br>
instances i n t he mobile. E ach m essage i ncludes an SR_ID and service<br>
option field associated with a single service instance.<br>
The use of multiple messages for these service requests wastes<br>
valuable air interface resources and increases the overall delay to<br>
complete the service requests. Thus, a need exists for an apparatus and<br>
method to support multiple packet data service instances in a more<br>
efficient manner.<br>

Detailed Description of Embodiments<br>
To address the need to support multiple packet data service<br>
instances in a more efficient manner, various signaling enhancements are<br>
provided. These enhancements will result in faster packet data call<br>
setups, reactivations, and dormant handoffs of multiple service instances<br>
while reducing over-the-air signalling. For originations of multiple packet<br>
data service connections, the mobile requests the setup of up to six<br>
service instances with a single origination message. For packet data<br>
dormant handoffs, the mobile requests the handoff of up to six service<br>
instances using a single message. And for reactivations, the mobile<br>
requests the reconnection of multiple, dormant packet data service<br>
instances with a single message.<br>
The disclosed embodiments can be more fully understood with<br>
reference to FIGs. 1-6. FIG. 1 is a block diagram depiction of a<br>
communication system 100 in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Communication system 100 is a well-known Code<br>
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, specifically a cdma2000<br>
system, which is based on the Telecommunications Industry Association /<br>
Electronic Industries Association (TIA/EIA) standard IS-2000, suitably<br>
modified to implement the present invention. The IS-2000 standard is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference. (The TIA/EIA can be contacted at 2001<br>
Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, D.C. 20006). In various<br>
embodiments, communication system 100 may utilize other cellular<br>
communication system protocols such as, but not limited to, IS-856<br>
(HRPD).<br>
Communication system 100 includes radio access network (RAN)<br>
entities, such as BS 111 (comprising one or more BTSs), PCF 120, PDSN<br>
121, and MSC 130, and includes remote units, such as mobile station<br>
(MS) 101. However, the present invention is not limited to remote units or<br><br>
MSs that are mobile. For example, a remote unit may comprise a desktop<br>
computer wirelessly connected to the radio access network.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that FIG. 1 does not depict all<br>
of the network equipment necessary for system 100 to operate but only<br>
those system blocks and logical entities particularly relevant to the<br>
description of embodiments of the present invention. Those skilled in the<br>
art are aware of the many ways each of these entities can be<br>
implemented and/or purchased from wireless communications companies<br>
such as "MOTOROLA."<br>
MS 101 and BS 111 comprise well-known entities such as<br>
processors 104 and 114, transmitters 102 and 112, and receivers 103 and<br>
113. Processors, for example, typically comprise components such as<br>
microprocessors, digital signal processors, memory, and/or logic circuitry<br>
designed to implement algorithms that have been expressed as computer<br>
instructions and/or in circuitry. Given an algorithm or a logic flow, those<br>
skilled in the art are aware of the many design and development<br>
techniques available to implement a processor that performs the given<br>
logic.<br>
Typically, transmitters and receivers are components of RAN base<br>
stations (BSs), and typically BSs interface with other RAN devices such as<br>
mobile switching centers (MSCs), packet control functions (PCFs), and<br>
packet data serving nodes (PDSNs). As shown in FIG. 1, BS 111<br>
interfaces to Internet 122 via PCF 120 and PDSN 121 and interfaces to<br>
the public telephone system via MSC 130. In a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a known CDMA 2000 BS is adapted using known<br>
telecommunications design and development techniques to implement the<br>
BS aspect of the present invention. The result is BS 111.<br>
BS 111 and MS 101 communicate via CDMA 2000 air interface<br>
resource 110. MS 101 comprises processor 104, receiver 103, and<br>
transmitter 102. Transmitters, receivers, and processors as used in CDMA<br>
MSs are all well known in the art. This common set of MS components is<br><br>
adapted using known telecommunications design and development<br>
techniques to implement the wireless unit aspect of the present invention.<br>
Operation of a first embodiment, in accordance with a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention, occurs substantially as follows. MS<br>
processor 104 generates a message that requests a service request<br>
operation, such as a connection origination, a connection reactivation (i.e.,<br>
a reconnection), or a dormant handoff, for multiple packet data<br>
connections between MS 101 and PDSN 121. These connections, or<br>
service instances, are each individually identified using a service<br>
reference identifier value (an SR_ID) in a message field or using a bit<br>
value in a bitmap. Processor 104 then instructs transmitter 102 to transmit<br>
the message to BS 111.<br>
BS processor 114 receives the message via receiver 113 and<br>
processes the message in order to facilitate the service request operation<br>
indicated. Message flow diagrams 200 and 300, as shown in FIGs. 2 and<br>
3 respectively, illustrate this messaging. In addition, message flow<br>
diagrams 200 and 300 illustrate the related messaging and procedures<br>
that occurs primarily between a n M S, a B S, a nd a P DSN, s uch a s M S<br>
101, BS 111, and PDSN 121, to facilitate the service request operation<br>
indicated.<br>
Message flow 200 illustrates a single Origination message and a<br>
single Reconnection message, which request connection<br>
origination/reconnection for SR_IDs 1, 2, and 3. Prior art IS-2000<br>
messaging would require three messages instead of either single<br>
message. For the origination case, after receiving the Origination<br>
message, the BS acknowledges it, and the BS and MS exchange the<br>
required messaging to establish a traffic channel (TCH). The BS also<br>
begins packet call setup procedures with the PDSN in order to establish<br>
the packet data connections for service instances 1, 2, and 3 between the<br>
MS and PDSN.<br><br>
Message flow 300 illustrates a single Origination message that<br>
requests dormant handoff for SR_IDs 1, 2, and 3. Prior art IS-2000<br>
messaging would require six messages instead. After receiving the<br>
Origination message, the BS begins dormant mode handoff procedures<br>
with the PDSN and sends a release to the MS, if a traffic channel is not<br>
required.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram depiction of an Origination message 400<br>
in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. Each field<br>
relevant to the first embodiment is shown in FIG. 4 with its associated bit-<br>
length. Most fields shown have a bit length of "0 or" followed by a number.<br>
This indicates, of course, that that field may not be included in the<br>
message. The SERVICE_OPTION, DRS, SR_ID, SYNC_ID_LEN, and<br>
SYNC_ID fields are all part of the present IS-2000 Origination message.<br>
The remaining fields explicitly shown in message 400 are proposed for the<br>
first embodiment of the present invention as described in detail below.<br>
First, a more general description is in order. Service options refer to<br>
specific packet data services, such as high speed data and voice over IP<br>
(VoIP). Message 400 includes a message extension that includes a<br>
record for each SR_ID indicated in the message extension. Each SR_ID<br>
refers to a packet data, MS-PDSN connection. Some Origination<br>
messages will include one or more service option indicators that indicate a<br>
service option value to correspond to one or more of these packet data<br>
connections.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, message 400 includes an SR_ID field, a<br>
SERVICE_OPTION field, an ADD_SR_ID (additional SR_ID) field, and an<br>
ADD_SERVICE_OPTION (additional service option) field. An<br>
ADD_SR_ID_INCL field, a NUM_ADD_SR_ID field, and an<br>
ADD_SERVICE_OPTION_INCL field are also shown. These fields<br>
indicate whether a particular message includes one or more additional<br>
SR_IDs, how many additional SR_IDs, and whether a particular message<br>
includes one or more additional service options, respectively.<br><br>
A detailed description of each field in the message extension of<br>
message 400 follows:<br>
ADD_SR_ID_INCL	Additional service reference identifiers included<br>
indicator.<br>
If this messaging is supported (i.e., if<br>
P_REV_IN_USES is less than eleven), or if the<br>
DRS field is set to T and either the SYNC_ID<br>
field is set to '0' or the SR_ID field is set to<br>
'111', then the MS shall omit this field;<br>
otherwise, the mobile station shall include this<br>
field and set it as follows:<br>
If the DRS field is set to '0' and the MS is<br>
performing dormant handoff of a single packet<br>
data service instance, or if the DRS field is set<br>
to '1' and the mobile station requests<br>
restoration of a single service option<br>
connection from the stored service<br>
configuration, then the MS shall set this field to<br>
'0'; otherwise, the mobile station shall set this<br>
field to'1'.<br>
NUM_ADD_SR_ID	Number of additional service reference<br>
identifiers included.<br>
If ADD_SR_ID_INCL is not included or is<br>
included and set to '0', the mobile station shall<br>
omit this field; otherwise, the mobile station<br>
shall include this field and set it to one less<br>
than the number of occurrences of the<br>
ADD_SR_ID field included in this message.<br><br>
If ADD_SR_ID_INCL is included and set to '1', then the mobile station<br>
shall include NUM_ADD_SR_ID + 1 occurrences of the following variable-<br>
field record:<br>
ADD_SR_ID	Additional service reference identifier.<br>
If the DRS field is set to '0' and the MS is<br>
performing dormant handoff of an additional<br>
packet data service instance, or if the DRS<br>
field is set to '1' and the mobile station<br>
requests restoration of an additional service<br>
option connection from the stored service<br>
configuration, then the MS shall set this field to<br>
the corresponding service reference identifier.<br>
ADD_SERVICE_OPTION_INCL<br>
Additional service option included indicator.<br>
If the SYNC_ID field is set to '1', then the<br>
mobile station shall omit this field; otherwise,<br>
the mobile station shall include this field and<br>
set it as follows:<br>
The mobile station shall set this field to '0' if<br>
the service option number of the service<br>
corresponding to the ADD_SR_ID field of this<br>
record is the same as SERVICE_OPTION;<br>
otherwise, the mobile station shall set this field<br>
to T.<br><br><br>
ADD_SERVICE_OPTION Additional service option number.<br>
If the ADD_SERVICE_OPTION_INCL field is<br>
set to '0', the mobile station shall omit this field;<br>
otherwise, the mobile station shall include this<br>
field and set it to the service option number of<br>
the service corresponding to the ADD_SR_ID<br>
field of this record.<br>
Origination message 400 is shown and described above in<br>
accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention. Origination<br>
message 600, as shown in FIG. 5, represents a second and alternative<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Message 400 individually identified<br>
the MS-PDSN connections using an SR_ID in individual message fields.<br>
Instead, Origination message 600 individually identifies the MS-PDSN<br>
connections using bit values in a bitmap, specifically, the SR_ID_BITMAP<br>
field. A detailed description of the fields in message 600 relevant to the<br>
second embodiment follows:<br>
SPECIAL_SERVICE	Special service option indicator.<br>
To request a single special service option, the<br>
mobile station shall set this field to '1'. To<br>
request the default service option (Service<br>
Option 1) or multiple service options, the<br>
mobile station shall set this field to '0'.<br>
SERVICE_OPTION	Requested service option for this origination.<br>
If the SPECIAL_SERVICE field is set to '1',<br>
the mobile station shall set this field to the<br>
value specified in [30], corresponding to the<br>
requested service option.<br><br>
If the SPECIAL_SERVICE field is set to '0' and<br>
the SERVICE_OPTION_LIST field is not<br>
included, the mobile station shall omit this field<br>
to request the default service option. If the<br>
SERVICE_OPTION_LIST field is included, the<br>
mobile station shall omit this field.<br><br>
SR_ID	Service reference identifier.<br>
If P_REV_IN_USES is less than six, the mobile<br>
station shall omit this field; otherwise, the<br>
mobile station shall include this field and set it<br>
as follows:<br>
If the SYNC_ID_INCL field is not included or is<br>
included and is set to '0', the mobile station<br>
shall set this field as follows:<br>
If the service instance provides a<br>
service reference identifier, the mobile<br>
station shall set this field to the service<br>
reference identifier specified by the<br>
service instance. If the service instance<br>
does not provide a service reference<br>
identifier, the mobile station shall set<br>
this field to the smallest unused service<br>
reference identifier value between 1 and<br>
6 (inclusive). If the SR_ID field is set to<br>
'0', refer to the SR_ID_BITMAP field for<br>
a list of service reference identifiers.<br>
Otherwise, the mobile station shall set this field<br>
as follows:<br><br>
If the mobile station requests the<br>
restoration of a single service option<br>
connection from the stored service<br>
configuration, the mobile station shall<br>
set this field to the corresponding<br>
service reference identifier; otherwise<br>
(that is, the mobile station requests the<br>
restoration of all the service option<br>
connections from the stored service<br>
configuration), the mobile station shall<br>
set this field to '111'<br>
SR_ID_BITMAP	Service Reference Identifier Bitmap<br>
If P_REV_IN_USES is less than nine (or<br>
another appropriate revision), the mobile<br>
station shall omit this field. If the SR_ID field is<br>
not included, or is included but is not set to '0',<br>
the mobile station shall omit this field;<br>
otherwise, the mobile station shall include this<br>
field and set it as follows.<br>
This field contains a bitmap list of SR_IDs<br>
requested for originating, reconnecting, or<br>
dormant handoff of a packet data call. Bits 1-6<br>
map to SR_IDs 1-6. At least two SR_IDs are<br>
specified.<br><br>
SR_ID_BITMAP<br><br>
Value (binary)	SR_ID Requested<br>
xxxxxx1	SR_ID=1<br>
xxxxx1x	SR_ID=2<br>
xxxx1xx	SR_ID=3<br>
xxx1xxx	SR_ID=4<br>
xx1xxxx	SR_ID=5<br>
x1xxxxx	SR_ID=6<br>
1xxxxxx	SR_ID=7<br>
SERVICE_OPTION_LIST Service Option List<br>
If the SR_ID_BITMAP field is not included, the<br>
mobile station shall omit this field; otherwise,<br>
the mobile station shall include this field and<br>
set it as follows.<br><br>
This field contains the list of Service Options<br>
associated with each SR_ID requested by the<br>
mobile specified in SR_ID_BITMAP. The<br>
mobile station shall set the fields to the value<br>
specified in [30], corresponding to the<br>
requested service options. 2-6 Service Options<br>
may be present. The first service option<br>
corresponds to the service instance with the<br>
smallest SR_ID value in the SR_ID_BITMAP<br>
field; the last Service Option in the list<br>
corresponds to the largest SR_ID value in the<br>
SR_ID_BITMAP field. The mobile station shall<br>
set the fields to the value specified in [30],<br>
corresponding to the requested service<br>
options.<br>
Logic flow 700, as shown in FIG. 6, is intended to provide a high-<br>
level description of the information gathered and then incorporated into a<br>
message extension in accordance with various embodiments of the<br>
present invention. Logic flow 700 purposefully does not address the many<br>
details of message generation described above in order to summarize the<br>
process as a whole. Also, FIG. 6 illustrates but one order in which these<br>
general steps may be performed. A person of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize that these steps may be performed in a different order or even<br>
concurrently depending on the particular design or implementation goals<br>
of an implementation.<br>
Logic flow 700 begins (701) with the MS determining (702) which<br>
service instances (i.e., which packet data connections) are involved in the<br>
service request operation the message is requesting. The MS also<br>
determines (703) whether service options for these service instances<br>
need to be indicated. For example, the service options do not need to be<br><br>
transmitted to the RAN in the case of a reactivation operation, since the<br>
service options associated with each service instance are known as part<br>
of the stored service configuration.<br>
To identify the instances individually, the MS indicates (704) a first<br>
SR_ID and (705) any additional SR_ID s. For example, for an Origination<br>
message in the first embodiment, the first SR_ID is indicated in the<br>
message body, while the additional SR_IDs are indicated in individual<br>
records in the message extension. For an Origination message in the<br>
second embodiment, the SR_IDs are indicated together in a bitmap.<br>
If (706) service options are not required in the message, the<br>
message (including its extension) can be transmitted to the RAN, and the<br>
logic flow ends (710). Otherwise, the MS indicates (707) a service option<br>
corresponding to the first SR_ID and (708) service options for each<br>
additional SR_ID. For example, for an Origination message in the first<br>
embodiment, the service option corresponding to the first SR_ID is<br>
indicated in the message body, and service options for each additional<br>
SR_ID are indicated in the message extension. Because a number of<br>
SR_IDs may have the same corresponding service option, this<br>
embodiment also provides that the service option corresponding to the<br>
first SR_ID be a default service option for SR_IDs for which no other<br>
service option is indicated.<br>
The present embodiments describe how the IS-2000 Origination,<br>
Enhanced Origination, and Reconnect messages can be enhanced to<br>
support multiple packet data connections for existing service instances<br>
requiring dormant mode handoffs or reactivation, or for each new service<br>
instances requested. For example, when a dormant mode handoff is<br>
required for a packet data session, the mobile will only be required to<br>
send one IS-2000 Origination or Enhanced Origination message for all<br>
service instance connections requiring a dormant mode handoff to a new<br>
BS. When new service instance connections are requested, the mobile<br><br>
will only be required to send one IS-2000 Origination message regardless<br>
of how many connections are required.<br>
This is useful for example when a user wants to make a VoIP call,<br>
the mobile will only be required to send one Origination message<br>
requesting both the main high speed packet data service option<br>
connection and the VoIP SO connection. Multiple occurrences of the<br>
Service Option element are also described herein. While dormant mode<br>
handoffs currently only occur for high speed packet data SO 33 (not<br>
required for circuit voice/data, Voice Over IP), the messages are future-<br>
proofed by including a SO identifier for each dormant service instance to<br>
allow for efficient dormant mode handoff of new packet data service<br>
options that will be supported in the future.<br>
The present application addresses the problem described above by<br>
greatly reducing over the air signaling required to support multiple packet<br>
data connections in the RAN. This will lead to faster packet call<br>
originations, dormant mode handoffs and reactivations, and thus,<br>
increased call capacity in the network and increased battery life in<br>
mobiles, particularly in networks where packet zones are small and<br>
frequent dormant mode handoffs occur.<br>

To address the need to support multiple packet data service instances<br>
in a more efficient manner, various signaling enhancements are provided.<br>
These enhancements will result in faster packet data call setups,<br>
reactivations, and dormant handoffs of multiple service instances while<br>
reducing over-the-air signaling. For originations of multiple packet data<br>
service connections, the mobile (101) requests the setup of up to six service<br>
instances with a single origination message (e.g. 400). For packet data<br>
dormant handoffs, the mobile requests the handoff of up to six service<br>
instances using a single message. And for reactivations, the mobile requests<br>
the reconnection of multiple, dormant packet data service instances with a<br>
single message.</td>
