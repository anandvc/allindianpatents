				<td>AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ACETIC ACID OR METHYL ACETATE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of acetic acid or methyl acetate.<br>
An iron and a tin containing compound as a catalyst is reported for producing acetic acid and or methyl acetate from methanol with high activity without an iodide promoter and without carbon monoxide in one pot reaction. The present invention relates to a process for production of acetic acid and or methyl acetate in the presence of catalyst system comprising of an iron containing compound and a tin containing compound with or without an organic compound containing C, N, O, P, S, diamine, diketone, and or diphosphines as a ligand, with methanol as a reactant and nitrile or nitro compound as a solvent. Background of the invention<br>
Acetic acid has been produced industrially on a large scale by methanol carbonylation by the well-known Monsanto and Cativa TM processes. References may be made to US 3816490A, EP 728726A1, EP 752406A1,wherein rhodium or iridium is used as catalyst to produce acetic acid using methanol and carbon monoxide. The drawbacks are the catalysts used in these processes are highly expensive. The processes also use an iodide promoter, which causes corrosion of the reactor and downstream equipments. Further, the need of high purity carbon monoxide as a reactant restricts the conditions of location of the plant. In addition the reaction is usually effected in liquid phase containing water consuming high energy to separate the product acetic acid. Nickel containing catalysts are also active for the carbonylation of methanol. Reference may be made to US 4902659, wherein the nickel containing catalysts are reported for the production of acetic acid. The drawbacks are the use of iodide promoters, which causes corrosion of the reactor and downstream equipments. Further, the need of high purity carbon monoxide as a reactant restricts the conditions of location of the plant. In addition the reaction is usually effected in liquid phase containing water consuming high energy to separate the product acetic acid.  The use of Ru-Sn heteronuclear cluster compounds has also been proposed. Reference may be made to J. Chem.   Soc.   Chem.   Commun.   1511-1512(1990)  wherein  Ru-Sn  heteronuclear  cluster compounds containing an anion comprising of [Ru(SnCl3)sL]3- (wherein L represents a ligand) as a catalyst for producing acetic acid and or methyl acetate from methanol in absence of CO in one stage reaction in liquid phase has been suggested. The drawbacks are the above-mentioned heteronuclear clusters contain Ruthenium, which is expensive and the solubility of<br>
the anionic cluster is very low in methanol, methyl acetate, acetic acid and other organic solvents. Also the catalyst precipitates out during reaction due to formaldehyde formed as an intermediate product. Thus catalyst deactivation takes place within a short period of reaction time. In particular, the catalyst is liable to be deactivated at higher temperature. A ruthenium containing catalyst has been suggested for producing acetic acid and or methyl acetate from methanol, methyl format, and or Para formaldehyde. Reference can be made to EP 0631814A1 wherein the ruthenium catalyst having general formula Ru(SnY3)m (L)n (wherein Y represents a halogen atom, a alkyl group, an aryl group, an aralkyl group or an alkoxyl group, L represents a ligand, m is an integer of 1 to 6, n is an integer of 0 to 5 and m+n is an integer of 1 to 6) is active for the conversion of methanol to acetic acid or methyl acetate. The drawbacks are the above mentioned heteropolynuclear complexes contain expensive ruthenium and the solubility of the anionic cluster is very low in methanol, methyl acetate, acetic acid and other organic solvents. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object or the present invention is to provide a process for acetic acid or methyl acetate which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a cheaper catalyst for the production of acetic acid or methyl acetate from methanol.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a noncarbonylative route for producing acetic acid or methyl acetate.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process without corrosive iodide promoter for producing acetic acid or methyl acetate. Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of acetic acid or methyl acetate, said process comprising; characterized in that reacting methanol in the presence of a catalyst comprising of an iron containing compound and a tin containing compound optionally in presence of a ligand comprising an organic compound containing C, N, O, P, S, diamine, diketone, and or diphosphines in one pot reaction with nitrile or nitro compound as a solvent at a temperature in the range of 0 to 300Â°C, separating the product by conventional methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention compound containing iron, a compound containing tin reacts with methanol in presence of nitrile or nitro compounds as solvent to produce acetic acid or methyl acetate.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention one or more coordinative nitrogen containing compound is used as a ligand along with the compound containing iron and a compound containing tin to produce acetic acid or methyl acetate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention one or more coordinative phosphorous containing compound is used as a ligand along with the compound containing iron and a compound containing tin to produce acetic acid or methyl acetate.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention one or more coordinative oxygen containing compound is used as a ligand.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention a coordinative sulfur containing compound is used as a ligand.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention a coordinative carbon containing compound is used as a ligand. Detailed description of the invention<br>

Examples of oxime containing ligand are the condensation products of aldehyde and hydroxylamine.<br>
A tetra dentate ligand containing oxygen and nitrogen as donor elements, are the examples of salen type of ligands. The salen structure is formed by condensation of salicylaldehyde and diamine compound having formula H2N(CH2)nNH2 (wherein n represents a digit from 1 to 4) or aromatic diamines like o-phenylenediamine, as the examples of the present investigation.<br>

Examples of coordinative oxygen containing ligand include H2O, alcohols including aliphatic alcohols and aromatic alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and diketones like acetyl acetonate.<br>
Examples of coordinative sulfur containing ligand include ionic compounds containing thiocyanate group, MSCN (wherein M represents alkali metal), compounds represented by RSR and RSH (wherein R represents an alkyl group cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, arylalkyl group, and an alkoxyl group), and heterocyclic compounds containing sulfur atom.<br>
Examples of the solvents used in the present investigation include the compounds containing nitrile group having general formula RCN (where R represents an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, an arylalkyl group or an alkoxyl group), the compounds containing nitro group having general formula RNO2 (where R represents an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, an arylalkyl group or an alkoxyl group).<br>
The catalyst components as per the present invention contain a compound containing an iron and a compound containing tin and optionally a ligand. The molar ratio of tin containing compound to the iron-containing compound in the reaction mixture can be for example from 1 to 30, preferably from 2 to 20. The ratio of methanol to the iron-containing compound is 10 to 800, preferably from 50 to 300. The ratio of methanol to the tin-containing compound is from 1 to 60, preferably from 2 to 20. The ratio of the ligand used to the iron-containing compound is from 0 to 10, preferably from 1 to 4 according to the coordinating sites of the ligand.<br>
The catalyst formed by the combination of an iron compound a tin compound and a ligand can be reacted with methanol in presence of a solvent at a reaction temperature for example from 0 to 300Â°C, preferably from 40 to 200Â°C. The reaction can be effected in an inert atmosphere (for example, nitrogen helium, or argon) under atmospheric pressure or elevated pressure.<br>
Thus, the catalyst formed insitu due to the addition of components described above can be used for the formation of acetic acid and or methyl acetate by reacting it with methanol in presence of a solvent as described above. The contact time of the reaction mixtures at the conditions described above can be from 1 hour to 72 hours, preferably from 1 to 24 hours.<br>
The reaction in the present investigation proceeds as follows: 2CH3OH â2HCHO + 2H2 2HCHO â HCOOCH3 HCOOCH3 â CH3COOH CH3COOH + CH3OH â CH3COOCH3 + H2O.<br>
As these reactions clearly show the acetic acid thus formed further reacts with methanol employed as the starting material to give methyl acetate. Therefore, suppressing the formation of methyl acetate by lowering the ratio of methanol in the reaction system can increase the formation of acetic acid.<br>
In addition under some reaction conditions, methyl formate and methylal, which are useful compounds as precursors of acetic acid and methyl acetate, can also be formed.<br>
Accordingly the process of the present invention is usable also as a process for producing methyl formate and or methylal by appropriately selecting the reaction conditions. The formation of methylal is believed to proceed by the following way:<br>
HCHO + 2CH3OH â CH3OCH2OCH3 +H2O.<br>
