				<td>Description<br>
This invention is in the field of paleontology, more especially it relates with lungs. This invention will assist paleontologist to assess the Performance of Lungs in asthma &amp; other lungs related diseases with high accuracy.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary dieses (COPD) are the dieses of lungs in which the airways become narrowed. This leads to a limitation of the flow of air to and from the lungs causing the shortness of breath .In contrast to asthma the limitation of air flow is poorly reversible and usually gets progressively worse over time.<br>
The diagnosis of COPD is confirmed by spirometry test that measures the forced expiratory volume in one second, which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in first second of a large breath. Pyrometer also measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a whole large breath. Normally at least 70% of the FVC comes out in the first second (the FEV/FVC ratio should&gt; 70%. In COPD this ratio is less than normal. Spirometers are medical instruments which measure lung function and are used regularly by physicians to help diagnose respiratory problems. To use a spirometer a patient is required to take a deep breath and exhale as vigorously as possible into the portable part of the instrument, which is called the mouthpiece. The mouthpiece is a flow sensor which is connected to the main part of the instrument which houses electronics, data presentation hardware and so on. In view of the fact that some patients may be sick, and for purposes of general hygiene, spirometer mouthpieces are<br><br>
designed for single patient use and are therefore disposable. They are hence manufactured and used in fairly large numbers.<br>
Test Procedure<br>
The basic FVC test varies slightly depending on the equipment used. Generally, the patient is asked to take the deepest breath they can, and then exhale into the sensor as hard as possible, for as long as possible. It is sometimes directly followed by a rapid inhalation (inspiration), in particular when assessing possible upper airway obstruction. Sometimes, the test will be preceded by a period of quiet breathing in and out from the sensor (tidal volume), or the rapid breath in (forced aspiratory part) will come before the forced exhalation.<br>
The Spirometers reading is used for generatating pneumotarograph, which are helpful in assessing conditions such as asthma, pulmonary, fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and copd. Generally the patient asked to take the deepest breath they can, and then exhale into the sensor as hard as possible, for as long as possible. During the test care should be taken for not escaping the air. For getting good and accurate reading we need good breathing tube, which will guide the air to the sensor. So sensor can sense it accurately. The breathing tube should fit to the machine and to the patient in all the ages from child to old ones. The cost should also very practically approachable to the patients.<br>
Need for the Development<br>
We surveyed in the market and find that many breathing tubes are presently available and doctors are mostly using Paper tubes which are not efficient in guiding blown air to the sensors. Some breathing tubes are lengthier and fitted with filters which are very costly and imported from outside. The main problem in this is paper inlet of breathing tube is not fitted to all the age<br><br>
of the patients and the leakage results in inaccurate results. Some breathing tubes are very hard which gives pain to patients.<br>
So, an attempt was made by us keeping in mind all the requirements to device a breathing tube for flow measuring instrument which will be economic, and effective in guiding all the air to the sensor.<br>
The following steps were followed for designing and fabricating the mouthpiece taking into consideration all the requirements<br>
Designing the Mouthpiece<br>
1. The first requirement for designing the mouthpiece was that the inlet of the<br>
mouthpiece should be compatible to all the age of user's and also the breathing<br>
tube should have such a shape that it should tight lip to the mouth and no air<br>
should leak out.<br>
2.The second requirement of the mouthpiece is it should fit mechanically to the<br>
instrument.<br>
3.	The third requirement of the mouthpiece is it have aerodynamic model so that resultant flow will have minimal velocity loss in the air path.<br>
4.	The fourth requirement was that the mouth piece inlet requires grips in order to avoid slipping from the mouth when blowing during the measurement.<br>
5.	The fifth requirement was that the Mouth piece should be made of a flexible material so that it can be easily go to the mouth of the patient. Moreover, the material should not be harmful under any condition and should have easy manufacturing ability. The part should be manufactured with hygienic condition at low cost.<br><br>
Embodiment of The mouth piece<br>
1.Taking into consideration the above requirement, the mouthpiece inlet is designed elliptical and size of the major axis and minor axis fixed to 38 and 23.4 ram respectively.(Fig.l).<br>
2.	The second requirement is to mechanically fit the outlet of the mouth piece with the instrument directly or through the adopter. The diameter 30 mm which is commonly used in most of the instruments is finalized at the outlet of the model (Fig.2).<br>
3.	The third requirement was the aerodynamic shape of the inlet area, so that the blown air will be guided to the circular outlet area with uniform velocity and with minimum velocity loss. (Fig.3).<br>
4.	The fourth requirement was that the mouth piece should not slip from the mouth of the patient. This is taken care by providing grip in two sides of the mouthpiece with 0.8 mm deep(Fig.4).<br>
5.	The fifth requirement is to make it from flexible material. The first choice<br>
was LDPE (Low Density Poly Ethylene), the choice was made since it was<br>
flexible &amp; food grades are available, also cost effective and easy process<br>
ability. The basic thickness was finalized at inlet of the mouthpiece is 0.8mm<br>
since LDPE has good fatigue strength.<br><br>
Advantage of the development<br>
Exact and accurate air can be sensed by sensor.<br>
Disposable so no chance of contamination.<br>
Economical so patient can easily approach to it.<br>
Technology can be applied to design respiratory disease instruments.<br><br><br>
We claim<br>
l. A device for guiding blown air to flow measuring instrument, which consist of elliptical(l) shape at inlet and round shape at outlet(4),two sets of grips(2) provided at both the sides of the inlet, inlet and outlet joined in aerodynamic(3)<br>
way to minimize velocity loss.<br>
2.	A device as claimed in claim 1 where the length of major axis 38 mm and minor axis 23.4<br>
3.	A device as claimed 1&amp;2 where in the radius of the outlet is 15 mm.<br>
4.	A device as claimed 1, 2&amp;3 wherein groves in each side of the inlet kept 0.8<br>
mm.<br>
5.	A device as claimed lto4 wherein the shape of the mouthpiece is aerodynamic<br>
shape minimizes velocity loss.<br>
6. A device is claimed in claims Ito 5 wherein the device is made of low density</td>
