Summary of the Related Art<br>
Tokunaga et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst 72 (1984) 955-96;. Pisetsky et al; Reich et al, Mol. Biol. Rep. 18(1993) 217-221; Kriege/a/.,Yi etal, Nature 374 (1995) 546-549 and Sato et al, Science 273 (1996) 352-354 teach that bacterial DNA, 15   synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, and DNA vaccines containing unmethylated CpG-dinucleotides in specific sequence contexts (CpG DNA) activate the vertebrate immune system.<br>
Krieg et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 20 (2002) 709-760; Dalpke et al., Biol. Chem. 383 (2002) 1491-1500 and Kandimalla et al, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 4 (2002)<br>
20   122-129 teach that CpG DNAs induce innate immune cells to produce Thl cytokines that promote cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses and production of immunoglobulins by B cells. The immunostimulatory properties of CpG DNAs have allowed their use as therapeutic agents for a broad spectrum of disease indications including cancers, viral and bacterial infections, inflammatory disorders and as<br>
25   adjuvant in immunotherapy.<br>

In addition to chemical modifications, a number of structural modifications influenced the activity of CpG DNAs. Kandimalla et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 30 (2002) 4460-4469 teaches that CpG DNAs that contained two freely accessible 5'-ends through a 3'-3'-linkage had greater activity than did conventional CpG DNAs 5   containing multiple copies of CpG motifs and a single 5'-end.<br>
Kandimalla et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 306 (2003) 948-953 teaches that the presence of a secondary structure in CpG DNAs significantly affected their activity depending on the position and nature of the secondary structure, that the presence of a hairpin structure at the 5'-end abrogated stimulatory activity, and that 10   the same structure at the 3'-end had an insignificant effect on stimulatory activity but caused lower IL-6 secretion and contributed to higher stability against nucleases.<br>
There remains a need to "customize" the immune response through modification of oligonucleotide analogs.<br>

oligonucleotides have from about 5 to about 18, or from about 5 to about 14, nucieoside residues. As used herein, the term "about" implies that the exact number is not critical. Thus, the number of nucieoside residues in the oligonucleotides is not critical, and oligonucleotides having one or two fewer nucieoside residues, or from 5   one to several additional nucieoside residues are contemplated as equivalents of each of the embodiments described above. In some embodiments, one or more of the oligonucleotides have 11 nucleotides.<br>
A self-complementary sequence as used herein refers to a base sequence which, upon suitable alignment, may form intramolecular or, more typically,<br>
10   intermolecular basepairing between G-C, A-T, A-U and/or G-U wobble pairs. In one embodiment the extent of self-complementarity is at least 50 percent. For example an 8-mer that is at least 50 percent self-complementary may have a sequence capable of forming 4, 5,6,7, or 8 G-C, A-T, A-U and/or G-U wobble basepairs. Such basepairs may but need not necessarily involve bases located at either end of the self-<br>
15   complementary immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or immunomer. Where<br>
nucleic acid stabilization may be important to the immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or immunomer, it may be advantageous to "clamp" together one or both ends of a double-stranded nucleic acid, either by basepairing or by any other suitable means. The degree of self-complementarity may depend on the alignment between<br>
20   immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and/or immunomer, and such alignment may or may not include single- or multiple-nucleoside overhangs. In other embodiments, the degree of self-complementarity is at least 60 percent, at least 70 percent, at least 80 percent, at least 90 percent, or even 100 percent.<br>
Similar considerations apply to intermolecular basepairing between 25   immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or immunomers of different base sequence.

Such basepairs may but need not necessarily involve bases located at either end of the complementary immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or immunomers. The degree of complementarity may depend on the alignment between 10   immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or immunomers, and such alignment may or may not include single- or multiple-nucleoside overhangs.

Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides were created as immunomers using the following protocols for synthesis. The immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or<br>
20   immunomers of the invention may conveniently be synthesized using an automated synthesizer and phosphoramidite approach as schematically depicted in Figures 2 and 4. In some embodiments, the immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or immunomers are synthesized by a linear synthesis, approach (see Figure 2). Representative linkers for this synthesis are presented in Figure 3. As used herein, the<br>
25   term "linear synthesis" refers to a synthesis that starts at one end of the immunomer and progresses linearly to the other end. Linear synthesis permits incorporation of either identical or un-identical (in terms of length, base composition and/or chemical modifications incorporated) monomeric units into the immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or immunomers.<br>

 <br>

An alternative mode of synthesis for immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or immunomers is "parallel synthesis", in which synthesis proceeds outward from a central linker moiety (see Figure 4). Representative linkers for this method of synthesis are presented in Figure 5. A solid support attached linker can be used for 5   parallel synthesis, as is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,912,332. Alternatively, a universal solid support, such as phosphate attached to controlled pore glass support, can be used.<br>
Parallel synthesis of immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or immunomers has several advantages over linear synthesis: (1) parallel synthesis permits the 10   incorporation of identical monomeric units; (2) unlike in linear synthesis, both (or all) the monomeric units are synthesized at the same time, thereby the number of synthetic steps and the time required for the synthesis is the same as that of a monomeric unit; and (3) the reduction in synthetic steps improves purity and yield of the final immunomer product.<br>
1S	At the end of the synthesis by either linear synthesis or parallel synthesis<br>
protocols, the immunostimulatory oligonucleotides or immunomers according to the invention may conveniently be deprotected with concentrated ammonia solution or as recommended by the phosphoramidite supplier, if a modified nucleoside is incorporated. The product immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and/or immunomer is<br>
20   preferably purified by reversed phase HPLC, detritylated, desalted and dialyzed.<br>
The compositions disclosed in the first second and third aspects of the invention can comprise the immunostimulatory oligonucleotide or immunomer alone or as oligonucleotide/immunomer conjugates. An oligonucleotide/immunomer conjugate comprises an oligonucleotide or immunomer, as described above, and an 25   antigen conjugated to the oligonucleotide and/or immunomer at a position other than the accessible 51 end. In some embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker comprises an antigen, which is conjugated to the oligonucleotide. In some other embodiments, the antigen is conjugated to the oligonucleotide at a position other than its 3' end. In<br>

some embodiments, the antigen produces a vaccine effect. The immunostimulatory oligonucleotide or immunomer alone or as oligonucleotide/immunomer conjugates can be administered in the methods discussed below.<br>
The antigen is optionally selected from antigens associated with a pathogen, 5   antigens associated with a cancer, antigens associated with an auto-immune disorder, and antigens associated with other diseases such as, but not limited to, veterinary or pediatric diseases, or wherein the antigen is an allergen. For purposes of the invention, the term "associated with" means that the antigen is present when the pathogen, cancer, auto-immune disorder, food allergy, skin allergy, respiratory 10   allergy, asthma or other disease is present, but either is not present, or is present in reduced amounts, when the pathogen, cancer, auto-immune disorder, food allergy, skin allergy, respiratory allergy, or disease is absent.<br>
The immunomer is covalently linked to the antigen, or it is otherwise operatively associated with the antigen. As used herein, the term "operatively<br>
15   associated with" refers to any association that maintains the activity of both immunomer and antigen. Nonlimiting examples of such operative associations include being part of the same liposome or other such delivery vehicle or reagent. In embodiments wherein the immunomer is covalently linked to the antigen, such covalent linkage preferably is at any position on the immunomer other than an<br>
20   accessible 5' end of an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide. For example, the antigen may be attached at an internucleoside linkage or may be attached to the non-nucleotidic linker. Alternatively, the antigen may itself be the non-nucleotidic linker.<br>

Administration of the therapeutic compositions of immunomers can be carried out using known procedures at dosages and for periods of time effective to reduce symptoms or surrogate markers of the disease. When administered systemically, the therapeutic composition is preferably administered at a sufficient dosage to attain a blood level of immunomer<br>
15   from about 0.0001 micromolar to about 10 micromolar. For localized administration, much lower concentrations than this may be effective, and much higher concentrations may be tolerated.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) function as sensors of infection and induce the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. TLRs recognize a wide variety of ligands, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon recognizing conserved pathogen-associated molecular products, TLRs activate host<br>
5   defense responses through their intracellular signaling domain, the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, and the downstream adaptor protein MyD88. Dendritic cells and macrophages normally respond to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and cytokines (for example, interleukin-lP; IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor, TNF), which they also produce; natural killer (NK) cells and T cells are also involved in the pro-<br>
10   inflammatory circuit. After TLR stimulation by bacterial compounds, innate immune cells release a range of cytokines. Some examples of TLR ligands include, but are not limited to, lipoproteins; peptidoglycan, zymosan (TLR2), double-stranded RNA, polyhpolyC (TLR3), lipopolysaccharide, heat shock proteins, taxol (TLR4), flagellin (TLR5), and imidazoquinolines- R848, resiquimod, imiquimod; ssRNA (TLR7/8),<br>

Triggers of EIA include, but are not limited to, breathing airborne pollens during exercise, breathing air pollutants during exercise, exercising with viral respiratory tract infections and exercising in cold, dry air. Occupational asthma is directly related to inhaling irritants and other potentially<br>
25   harmful substances found in the workplace. Triggers of occupational asthma include, but are not limited to, fumes, chemicals, gases, resins, metals, dusts, vapors and insecticides.<br>

As used herein, the term "autoimmune disorder" refers to disorders in which "self proteins undergo attack by the immune system. Such term includes autoimmune asthma.<br>
Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, decreased exposure to 5   bacteria may be partially responsible for the increased incidence of, severity of, and mortality due to allergic diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and rhinitis in the developed countries. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that bacterial infections or products can inhibit the development of allergic disorders in experimental animal models and clinical studies. Bacterial DNA or synthetic<br>
10   oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and/or modified CpG dinucleotides in certain sequence contexts (CpG DNA) potently stimulate innate immune responses and thereby acquired immunity. The immune response to CpG DNA includes activation of innate immune cells, proliferation of 6 cells, induction of Thl cytokine secretion, and production of tmmunoglobulins (lg). The activation of<br>
15   immune cells by CpG DNA occurs via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a molecular pattern recognition receptor. CpG DNA induce strong Thl-dominant immune responses characterized by secretion of 1L-12 and IFN-y. Immunomers (IMO) alone or as allergen conjugates decrease production of IL-4, IL-5, and IgE and reduce eosinophilia in mouse models of allergic asthma. IMO compounds also effectively<br>
20   reverse established atopic eosinophilic airway disease by converting a Th2 response to a Thl response.<br>
OVA with alum is commonly used to establish a Th2-dominant immune response in various mouse and rat models. TheTh2 immune response includes increased IL-4, IL-5, and 1L-13 production, elevated serum levels of total and antigen-25   specific IgE, lgG 1, and lower levels of lgG2a. IMO compounds prevent and reverse established Th2-dominant immune responses in mice. The co-administration of IMO compounds with OV A/alum to mice reduces IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 production and induces IFN-y production in spleen-cell cultures subjected to antigen re-stimulation.<br>

 <br>
WO 2006/002038	PCT/US2005/020911<br>
Furthermore, IMO compounds inhibit antigen-specific and total IgE and enhance lgG2a production in these mice.<br>
Injection of OVA/alum and IMO compounds induces a lymphocyte antigen-recall response (Thl-type) in mice characterized by low levels of Th2-associated 5   cytokines, IgE and IgGl, and high levels of Thl-associated cytokines and IgG2a. Co-administration of IMO compounds with other kinds of antigens, such as S. masoni egg and hen egg lysozyme, also result in reversal of the Th2-response to a Thl -dominant response in in vitro and in vivo studies. As described herein, IMO compounds effectively prevent development of a Th2 immune response and allow a 10   strong Thl response.<br>
While Th2 cytokines trigger an Ig isotype switch towards production of IgE and IgGl, the Thl cytokine IFN-y induces production of IgG2a by B-lymphocytes. Mice injected with OVA/alum and IMO compounds produce lower levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and higher levels of IFN-y, accompanied by lower IgE and IgGl and 15   higher IgG2a levels, than mice injected with OVA/alum alone. This suggests the<br>
existence of a close link between Thl-cytokine induction and immunoglobulin isotype switch in mice that receive antigen and IMO compounds.<br>
Serum antigen-specific and total IgE levels are significantly lower in mice receiving OVA/alum and IMO compounds than in mice receiving OVA/alum alone.<br>
20   In contrast, OVA-specific IgGl levels are insignificantly changed and total IgGl<br>
levels are only slightly decreased compared with mice injected with OVA/alum alone (data not shown). The different response may result from different mechanisms involved in the control of IgE and IgGl class switch, though both isotypes are influenced by IL-4 and IL-13. For example, IL-6 promotes B lymphocytes to<br>
25   synthesize IgG 1 in the presence of IL-4.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1:  Oligonucleotide Synthesis, Purification and Thermal Melt Profiles<br>
CpG oligonucleotides (immunostimulatory oligonucleotides/ immunomers) were synthesized on a 1 to 2 umole scale using p-cyanoethylphosphoramidites on a<br>
5   PerSeptive Biosystem's 8909 Expedite DNA synthesizer (PerSeptive Biosystem, Boston, MA). The phosphoramidites of dA, dG, dC, and T were obtained from PE Biosystems (Foster City, CA). As described by Iyer R.P., et al. {J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112:1253-1254 (1990)), an iodine oxidizing agent was used to obtain the phosphorothioate backbone modification. All oligos were deprotected using standard<br>
10   protocols, purified by HPLC, and dialyzed against USP quality sterile water for<br>
irrigation. The oligos were lyophilized and dissolved again in distilled water and the concentrations were determined from UV absorbance at 260 nm. AH oligos were characterized by CGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystem's Voyager-DETM STR BiospectrometryTM Workstation) for purity and molecular<br>
15   mass, respectively. The purity of full-length oligos ranged from 90-96% with the rest being shorter by one or two nucleotides (n-1 and n-2) as determined by GGE and/or denaturing PAGE. All oligos contained less than

10   Example 9:  Cytokine Analysis<br>
The secretion of IFN-a in vertebrate ceils, preferably BALB/c mouse spleen cells or human PBMC, was measured by sandwich ELISA. The required reagents including cytokine antibodies and cytokine standards were purchased form 15   PharMingen, San Diego, CA. ELISA plates (Costar) were incubated with appropriate antibodies at 5 ng/mL in PBSN buffer (PBS/0.05% sodium azide, pH 9.6) overnight at 4°C and then blocked with PBS/1% BSA at 37 °C for 30 minutes. Cell culture supernatants and cytokine standards were appropriately diluted with PBS/10% FBS, added to the plates in triplicate, and incubated at 25 °C for 2 hours. Plates were 20   overlaid with I ug/mL appropriate biotinylated antibody and incubated at 25 °C for 1.5 hours. The plates were then washed extensively with PBS-T Buffer (PBS/0.05% Tween 20) and further incubated at 25 °C for 1.5 hours after adding streptavidin conjugated peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The plates were developed with Sure Blue™ (Kirkegaard and Perry) chromogenic reagent and the reaction was terminated 25   by adding Stop Solution (Kirkegaard and Perry). The color change was measured on a Ceres 900 HDl Spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments).<br>
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation 30   (Histopaque-1077, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, heparinized blood was layered<br>

onto the Histopaque-1077 (equal volume) in a conical centrifuge and centrifuged at 400 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature. The buffy coat, containing the mononuclear cells, was removed carefully and washed twice with isotonic phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation at 250 x g for 10 minutes. The resulting cell 5   pellet was then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing L-glutamine<br>
(MediaTech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS and penicillin-streptomycin (lOOU/ml). Cells were cultured in 24 well plates for different time periods at 1 X 106 cells/ml/well in the presence or absence of oligonucleotides. At the end of the incubation period, supernatants were harvested and 10   stored frozen at -70 "C until assayed for various cytokines including IFN-a<br>
(BioSource International) by sandwich ELISA. The results are shown in Table 3A-3D below.<br>
In all instances, the levels of IFN-a in the cell.culture supernatants was calculated from the standard curve constructed under the same experimental 15   conditions for IFN-a.<br>

Example 10: Flow Cytometric Analysis<br>
Cell surface markers of CD69 and CD86 were detected with a Coulter Epics-XL Flow Cytometer using anti-human CD69-Fitc and CD86-Fitc, which were<br>
15   purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, USA). Staining methods were briefly descried as follow. The activated culture cells were blocked with 10% Human AB serum (Sigma) in staining buffer (PBS with 1 % BSA and 0.1 % NaN3) at 4°C for 1  ¦ hour and stained with the antibodies at 4°C overnight. PBMCs (4xl05) were stained with CD69-Fitc and CD86-Fitc. PDCs (2x10s) were stained CD86-Fitc. The cell<br>
20   staining data were acquired and analyzed with Coulter System II software (see Tables 4A-4F below).<br>
