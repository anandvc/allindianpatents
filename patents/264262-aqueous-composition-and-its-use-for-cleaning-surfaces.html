				<td>AQUEOUS HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-CONTAINING COMPOSITION AND ITS<br>
USE FOR CLEANING SURFACES<br>
The present invention relates to an aqueous composition comprising hydrogen<br>
peroxide and its use for cleaning surfaces.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide-containing cleaning or disinfecting compositions are generally<br>
known. Thus US 5,349,083 discloses an aqueous composition comprising a lower<br>
aliphatic peroxyacid (e.g. peracetic acid), prepared by combining hydrogen<br>
peroxide and a lower aliphatic acid.<br>
WO 99/28427 discloses an aqueous bleaching composition comprising hydrogen<br>
peroxide, a polymeric thickener, a rheology stabilizing agent, and an alkalinity<br>
buffering agent. The pH of the compositions disclosed in the Examples is at least<br>
7.<br>
A method for cleaning a roof using an aqueous peroxide-containing cleaning<br>
composition is known from Australian Patent Application No. 2002100596. This<br>
document discloses a method for cleaning a roof which involves the steps of (i)<br>
placing an effective amount of a neutralizing agent on the lower part of the roof, (ii)<br>
applying an aqueous composition comprising a cleaning agent to the roof, and (iii)<br>
rinsing said composition from the roof with water, whereby the rinse water runs<br>
from the roof towards the neutralizing agent, so that residual cleaning agent is<br>
neutralized. Disclosed cleaning agents are hydrogen peroxide, percarbonates,<br>
preformed percarboxylic acids, persilicates, persulphates, perborates, organic and<br>
inorganic peroxides, and/or hydroperoxides. The cleaning composition also<br>
contains a surfactant.<br>
It has now been found that such cleaning compositions can be further improved by<br>
the addition of an active thickener. An active thickener is a polymeric thickener<br><br>
capable of forming peroxy groups (e.g. peroxyacid groups) under acidic conditions<br>
and in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The aqueous composition according to the present invention has a pH of 3 or less<br>
and comprises the following ingredients, based on the total weight of the<br>
composition:<br>
a)	0.05-40 wt% of a polymeric thickener having -COOR groups, wherein R is<br>
independently chosen from H, OH, and a carbon-atom containing group, and<br>
b)	0.05-60 wt% of hydrogen peroxide,<br>
wherein the active oxygen content attributable to ingredient a) is at least 0.02 wt%,<br>
based on the total weight of the composition, with the proviso that (co)polymers<br>
prepared from (meth)acrylate monomers are absent.<br>
The aqueous composition in accordance with the invention comprises an active<br>
thickener comprising peroxy groups and having cleaning capabilities. An<br>
advantage of the active thickener is that it remains active over a longer period of<br>
time and is more effective specifically on the surface to be cleaned compared to<br>
conventional peroxyacids. The relatively low pH of the aqueous composition allows<br>
the composition to remain stable upon storage, i.e. gives a reduced loss of activity<br>
over time. The storage stability is particularly improved if the aqueous composition,<br>
and particularly the polymeric thickener, is essentially free of contaminants such as<br>
transition metals like copper, cobalt, iron, etc. If such transition metals are present,<br>
metal sequestering compounds can be added to the aqueous composition to<br>
provide a stable composition. Additionally, the lower the pH, the more stable the<br>
peroxy acid functionality is in combination with the stabilizer mix prescribed.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the aqueous composition has a pH of 3 or less<br>
and comprises the following ingredients, based on the total weight of the<br>
composition:<br>
a) 0.05-20 wt% of a polymeric thickener having 20-100,000 monomeric units and<br>
on average containing at least 0.8 -COOR groups per monomeric unit,<br><br>
wherein R is independently chosen from H, OH, and a carbon atom-containing<br>
group,<br>
b)	0.05-30 wt% of hydrogen peroxide, and<br>
c)	0.5-60 wt% of one or more aliphatic carboxylic acids having 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms, their alkyl esters, anhydrides, and/or peroxyacids,<br>
wherein the active oxygen content attributable to ingredients a) and c) is at least<br>
0.02 wt%, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Due to the presence of the polymeric thickener (ingredient a), the cleaning<br>
composition according to the invention is more active in the cleaning of surfaces<br>
than comparable compositions that do not contain a thickener or that contain other<br>
thickeners.<br>
Furthermore, the thickener reduces the composition's mobility, so that longer<br>
contact times with non-horizontal surfaces are possible. When cleaning a roof with<br>
the composition according to the invention, the composition has already been<br>
deactivated (i.e. has a lower active oxygen content and a higher pH) before it<br>
enters the environment. Hence, a separate neutralizing agent - as in the above-<br>
mentioned Australian Patent Application - is not required, meaning that the<br>
cleaning composition according to the invention is more environmentally friendly<br>
and allows a simpler cleaning procedure.<br>
The polymeric thickener is present in the composition according to the invention in<br>
a concentration of at least 0.05 wt%, preferably at least 0.1 wt%, and more<br>
preferably at least 0.2 wt%. The maximum concentration is 20 wt%, preferably 10<br>
wt%, and more preferably 2.5 wt%, all weight percentages based on the total<br>
weight of the composition. As one skilled in the art will recognise, the concentration<br>
of polymeric thickener in the composition also depends on the molecular weight of<br>
the thickener: the higher the molecular weight, the lower the preferred<br>
concentration.<br><br>
The polymeric thickener typically has at least 20 monomelic units, preferably the<br>
thickener has 20-100,000, more preferably 100-75,000, and even more preferably<br>
200-50,000 monomeric units.<br>
In one embodiment the polymeric thickener contains, on average, at least 0.6<br>
COOR groups per monomer unit, preferably at least 0.7 -COOR groups per<br>
monomer unit, and most preferably at least 0.8 -COOR groups per monomer unit,<br>
wherein R is independently chosen from H, OH, or a carbon atom-containing<br>
group. In other words, the thickener contains carboxylic acid (R=H), peroxyacid<br>
(R=OH), and/or ester (R=carbon atom-containing group). The carbon atom-<br>
containing group can be any substituent comprising at least one carbon atom.<br>
Typically, the carbon atom-containing group is selected from the group consisting<br>
of alkyl, acyl, and aryl.<br>
In at least part of the -COOR groups present in the thickener R is OH, indicating<br>
the formation of peroxyacid functionalities. It is noted that the -COOR groups may<br>
be present in the polymeric thickener already before addition to the aqueous<br>
composition, i.e. before contact with hydrogen peroxide, or may be formed after<br>
contact with hydrogen peroxide.<br>
In this specification, the term "monomeric unit" does not refer to the repeating unit,<br>
but to the basic monomeric unit. For instance, in xanthan gum the repeating unit is<br>
a pentamer of five pyranose rings. The monomeric units, however, are the<br>
individual pyranose rings. Another example is that the monomeric units of<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) are the individual glucose units.<br>
In the context of the present application, "R is independently chosen" means that<br>
for each individual -COOR group in the polymeric thickener R is independently<br>
chosen.<br>
The polymeric thickener can be any polymeric thickener comprising -COOR groups<br>
and which can form peroxy groups. The peroxidized polymeric thickener further<br><br>
has an active oxygen content of at least 0.02 wt%, based on the total weight of the<br>
composition. The inventors have observed that xanthan gum, which generally has<br>
0.6 -COOR groups per monomer unit, does not form peroxy groups in an amount<br>
which is in accordance with the invention. Examples of suitable polymeric<br>
thickeners are homo-, co-, and terpolymers of carboxylic acids, functionalized<br>
cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, functionalized and/or crosslinked<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, functionalized<br>
polystyrene (SMA polymers), alpha methyl styrene polymaleic acids, functionalized<br>
EHEC, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVP, and functionalized polyolefins and/or<br>
halogenated polyolefins.<br>
The synthetic polymers obtained through addition polymerization, and in particular<br>
the (co)polymers prepared from (meth)acrylate monomers, are less preferred, as<br>
they are generally less biodegradable and burden the environment.<br>
Also, these synthetic polymers are expensive. Moreover, peroxidized acrylate<br>
(co)polymers tend to separate and/or sediment from the aqueous composition.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the polymeric thickener is selected from<br>
cellulose ethers, starches, and polyesters. Examples of such polymeric thickeners<br>
are carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and carboxymethyl starch.<br>
It is also envisaged to use a combination of two or more of the above polymeric<br>
thickeners.<br>
In a further embodiment, these thickened compositions can contain other inert<br>
thickeners to assist in adjustment of the viscosity without any negative effect on the<br>
cleaning ability of the composition.<br>
The pH of the composition is 3 or less, preferably 1 to 3.<br>
Because the pH of the aqueous composition is less than 3 and because the<br>
composition comprises hydrogen peroxide, an equilibrium is established between<br><br>
the carboxylic acid or ester functionalities and the peroxyacid functionalities in the<br>
thickener.<br>
As a second ingredient (ingredient b), the composition according to the invention<br>
contains hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is present in the composition<br>
according to the invention in an amount of 0.05-30 wt%, preferably 1.5-20 wt%,<br>
calculated as H2O2 and based on the total weight of the aqueous composition.<br>
As a third ingredient (ingredient c), the composition according to the present<br>
invention comprises at least 0.5 wt%, preferably at least 1 wt%, more preferably at<br>
least 4 wt%, and most preferably at least 7 wt% of one or more aliphatic carboxylic<br>
acids having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, the corresponding alkyl esters, anhydrides,<br>
and/or peroxyacids. The maximum amount of this third ingredient is 60 wt%,<br>
preferably 55 wt%, and most preferably 50 wt%, all based on the total weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
In this specification, the term "aliphatic carboxylic acid" refers to carboxylic acids in<br>
which the carboxylic acid group (i.e. the -COOH group) is not directly attached to<br>
an aromatic ring. Although aromatic carboxylic acids - i.e. acids that have the<br>
carboxylic acid moiety directly attached to an aromatic ring (as in benzoic acid or<br>
dipicolinic acid) - may be present in the composition according to the invention as<br>
an additive, it is essential that the composition contains at least 0.5 wt% of an<br>
aliphatic carboxylic acid having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, its corresponding alkyl ester,<br>
anhydride, and/or peroxyacid.<br>
The aliphatic carboxylic acid can be a mono-, di-, or tri-acid.<br>
In one embodiment, the aliphatic carboxylic acid is a di-acid or a mixture of di-<br>
acids. In another embodiment, the aliphatic carboxylic acid contains 3 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms.<br><br>
Preferred aliphatic carboxylic acids are glutaric add, succinic acid, adipic acid,<br>
citric acid, glycidic acid, hydroxy acetic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, citraconic<br>
acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, valeric acid, butyric acid, itaconic acid, and<br>
mixtures thereof. More preferred are glutaric acid, a mixture of glutaric acid and<br>
citric acid, or a mixture comprising 40-60 wt% glutaric acid, 15-35 wt% adipic acid,<br>
and 15-30 wt% succinic acid. The advantage of glutaric acid is that it has good<br>
solubility, performance, and smell (it is odourless).<br>
Aliphatic carboxylic acids that preferably should not be present in the composition<br>
according to the present invention are monochloropropionic acid (MCPP) and<br>
acetic acid. The former contains chlorine, which is undesred from an<br>
environmental point of view; the latter is undesired due to its irritating odour and its<br>
aggressive and volatile nature.<br>
The alkyl ester of the aliphatic carboxylic acid having 1 to 8 carbon atoms<br>
preferably is a C1-C5 alkyl ester, more preferably a C1-C3 alkyl ester, and most<br>
preferably a methyl ester. Mono-, di-, and triesters can be used. Also monoesters<br>
of di- or tricarboxylic acids are suitable; the non-esterified carboxylic group(s) of<br>
such compounds may have an acid, anhydride, or peroxyacid functionality.<br>
In the presence of hydrogen peroxide (ingredient b), the carboxylic acid, its<br>
anhydride and/or alkyl ester will be in equilibrium with the corresponding<br>
peroxyacid. The amount of peroxyacid present in the composition attributable to<br>
ingredient c) preferably is at least 0.5 wt%, more preferably at least 1 wt%, and<br>
most preferably at least 2 wt%. The maximum amount of peroxyacid attributable to<br>
ingredient c) preferably is 20 wt%, more preferably 10 wt%, and most preferably 5<br>
wt%, all based on the total weight of the aqueous composition.<br>
In an embodiment that is preferred from an economical point of view, ingredient c)<br>
comprises a mixture of the monoperoxyacids of the monoalkyl esters of glutaric<br><br>
acid, succinic acid, and/or adipic acid. More preferably, it comprises a mixture of<br>
the monoperoxyacids of the monomethyl esters of giutaric acid, succinic acid,<br>
and/or adipic acid. Even more preferred are mixtures of the monoperexyacids of<br>
the monomethyl esters of giutaric acid, succinic acid, and adipic acid in the<br>
respective amounts (based on the total weight of ingredient c) of 40-60 wt%, 15-30<br>
wt%, and 15-35 wt%.<br>
The active oxygen content attributable to the peroxy functionalities in ingredients a)<br>
and c) is, in sum, at least 0.02 wt%, preferably at least 0.05 wt%, and most<br>
preferably at least 0.1 wt%. The total active oxygen content of the composition<br>
according to the invention preferably is at least 1 wt%, more preferably 1-25 wt%,<br>
and most preferably 2-9 wt%. The active oxygen content is determined by the<br>
method described in the Examples and is based on the tote! weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
Optionally, the composition according to the present invention may comprise an<br>
additional Brønsted acid, e.g. an inorganic acid such as H2SO4, H3PO4, or H3PO3.<br>
This acid catalyzes the formation of peroxyacid functionalities in the thickener and<br>
the carboxylic acid, its anhydride or alkyl ester and serves to quickly establish the<br>
equilibrium. It also serves to stabilize the composition and to maintain the required<br>
pH at 3 or less.<br>
This acid is preferably present in the composition in an amount of 0.01-2 wt%,<br>
more preferably 0.02-0.5 wt%, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The water content of the composition according to the invention preferably is in the<br>
range of 30 to 90 wt%, more preferably 35 to 85 wt%, most preferably 40 to 80<br>
wt%.<br><br>
Additional components that may be present in the composition according to the<br>
invention include stabilizers, such as dipicolinic acid, alkyl phosphates, alkyl<br>
phosphonates, aminophosphates (e.g. Dequest®), amino carboxylates (e.g. NTA,<br>
EDTA, PDTA), and di- or polycarboxylates (e.g. polycitric acid, polyacrylate, or<br>
styrene maleic acid copolymers). A stabilizer is preferably present in a<br>
concentration of 10-20,000 ppm, more preferably 100-15,000 ppm, and most<br>
preferably 200-10,000 ppm (depending on the quality of the starting raw materials).<br>
Also surfactants (e.g. cationics, non-ionics, and anionics derived from long chain<br>
fatty acids or alcohols), chelating agents, or water-soluble alcohols (e.g. methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol, glycols, glycerine) may be present in the composition. It is<br>
emphasized that, although surfactants and chelating agents may be present in the<br>
composition, their presence is not required.<br>
Further, the composition according to the invention may contain one or more<br>
additional thickeners in order to enhance the viscosity and improve the viscosity<br>
stability and lead to a longer contact time between the composition and the surface<br>
to be cleaned. Examples of additional thickeners are xanthan gum, clays, inorganic<br>
nanoparticles (including naturally occurring clays), and/or functionalized inorganic<br>
nanoparticles.<br>
For stability reasons, the metal content - in particular the content of Cu, Co, Fe, Ce,<br>
Mn, V, Cr, or Ni - of the composition according to the invention preferably is less<br>
than 1 ppm, more preferably less than 0.5 ppm (calculated as metal and based on<br>
the weight of the total composition),<br>
The composition according to the present invention preferably has the form of a<br>
clear aqueous solution.<br><br>
Preferably, the composition according to the invention is sprayable. Typically,<br>
"sprayable" means that the Brookfield viscosity of the composition at its<br>
temperature of use preferably is not higher than 6,000 cps. However, it is also<br>
envisaged to use equipment suitable for spraying compositions having a Brookfield<br>
viscosity above 6,000 cps. Alternatively, aqueous compositions exhibiting shear<br>
thinning behaviour may have a Brookfield viscosity exceeding 6,000 cps.<br>
Preferably, the Brookfield viscosity of the aqueous composition of the invention is<br>
in the range of 0.1-6,000 cps, more preferably 20-2,000 cps, even more preferably<br>
50-1,000 cps, and most preferably 50-750 cps.<br>
The composition according to the invention can be prepared by mixing an aqueous<br>
hydrogen peroxide solution (e.g. a 70% H2O2 solution) with (i) the polymeric<br>
thickener, and (ii) optionally additional water and/or additional ingredients.<br>
Preferably, the polymeric thickener is pre-dissolved in water to create a<br>
composition sufficiently viscous and homogenized. The hydrogen peroxide is then<br>
added to this system to create the aqueous composition of the invention.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the aqueous composition can be prepared<br>
by mixing an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (e.g. a 70% H2O2 solution) with<br>
(i) the polymeric thickener, (ii) at least one aliphatic carboxylic acid having 1-8<br>
carbons atoms, its alkyl ester, anhydride, or mixed anhydride, and (iii) optionally<br>
additional water and/or additional ingredients. An example of a suitable mixed<br>
anhydride is the mixed anhydride formed by reacting glutaric anhydride and citric<br>
acid.<br>
The ingredients may be added in any order of addition. On an industrial scale,<br>
safety might require that the hydrogen peroxide be added as the last compound.<br>
In another embodiment, the polymeric thickener and the hydrogen peroxide are<br>
mixed together before being added to the carboxylic acid having 1 to 8 carbon<br><br>
atoms, its alkyl ester, or (mixed) anhydride. This allows better dissolution of the<br>
thickener and accelerates peroxyacid formation.<br>
In order to enhance (i) the rate at which the composition reaches equilibrium, (ii) its<br>
sprayability, and/or (iii) its cleaning performance, the aqueous composition<br>
according to the invention may be heated during its preparation, storage, transport,<br>
and/or application. It is preferably heated to a temperature in the range of 25-70°C,<br>
more preferably 35-70°C, and most preferably 40-60°C.<br>
The composition according to the invention is particularly suitable for the cleaning<br>
of surfaces, both porous and non-porous, both indoor and outdoor, and both<br>
horizontal and non-horizontal. Types of surfaces that can be cleaned with the<br>
composition of the invention include stone (e.g. bricks), concrete, plaster,<br>
plasterboard, glass, asphalt, natural or synthetic polymeric materials (elastomers,<br>
thermoplasts, thermosets), metals, ceramics (glazed or non-glazed), asbestos,<br>
(aged) wood (hard, soft, or synthetic), coated surfaces, and enamel surfaces, and<br>
fabrics (synthetic or natural).<br>
The composition is particularly suitable for the cleaning of exterior (porous)<br>
surfaces, such as roofs, facades of buildings, fences, and paving.<br>
The composition according to the invention makes cleaning of surfaces very easy,<br>
because the only action required is applying, e.g. spraying, the composition onto<br>
the surface. Brushing or other mechanical treatments are optional.<br>
If desired, the composition may be removed from the surface. It can be removed<br>
actively, for instance by rinsing with water. However, in the case of exterior<br>
surfaces, removal can be simply performed by nature, e.g. by exposing the surface<br>
to rain and/or wind.<br>
For optimum effect, it is recommended to wait at least one hour, more preferably at<br>
least three hours, between the application of the composition on and its removal<br>
from the surface.<br><br>
With the composition according to the invention, both chemical and bio fouling can<br>
be removed from surfaces.<br>
Depending on the formulation of the composition, the nature of the surface, and the<br>
amount and nature of the fouling, the composition according to the invention is<br>
preferably applied to the surface in an amount of 100-500 ml/m2. If necessary,<br>
multiple treatments can be applied.<br>
In addition, it should be noted that the composition according to the invention may<br>
also be used as a bleaching agent, e.g. for textiles or paper.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
a) Measurement of the total active oxygen content ("AO")<br>
The active oxygen content was measured by placing 20 ml of glacial acetic acid in<br>
a 200 ml conical flask fitted with a ground glass joint and an inlet tube for nitrogen<br>
gas. Nitrogen gas was then passed over the surface of the liquid. After 2 minutes,<br>
4 ml of 770 g/l potassium iodide solution was added and a sample containing<br>
approximately 1.5 meq of active oxygen was added to the reaction mixture with<br>
mixing. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for at least 10 minutes at 25°C ±<br>
5°C.<br>
Demineralized water (50 ml) was then added, followed by 3 ml of a 5 g/l starch<br>
solution. The reaction mixture was then titrated with a 0.1 N sodium thiosulphate<br>
solution to a colourless end point. A blank should be run alongside this titration.<br>
The active oxygen content, in wt%, was then calculated by subtracting the volume<br>
in ml of sodium thiosulphate solution used in the blank from the amount used in the<br>
titration, multiplying the value by the normality of the sodium thiosulphate solution<br>
and then by 800, and finally dividing by the mass of the peroxide sample in<br>
milligrams.<br><br>
b) Potentiometric measurement of the peroxyacids concentration and the active<br>
oxygen content attributable to peroxyacids<br>
Weigh 0.1 to 5 g peroxide sample and charge it into a 150 ml beaker. Add 100 ml<br>
demi-water and titrate it with a 0.1N potassium hydroxide solution in ethanol, using<br>
a potentiometric titrator with automatic endpoint detection, equipped with a<br>
combined glass calomel electrode (3M KCI in water).<br>
Two potential jumps are observed, the first from the organic acid (=V1) and the<br>
second from the peroxyacid (=V2).<br>
The peroxyacid functionality content of both the thickener and the carboxylic acid<br>
containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms (in wt%) is calculated by subtracting V1 from V2 and<br>
multiplying this figure by the normality of the potassium hydroxide solution and then<br>
by the average molar mass of the percarboxylic acid and the monomelic units of<br>
the peroxiclized thickener, and finally dividing it by 10 times the mass of the sample<br>
in grams. The result is in wt% peroxyacid.<br>
The AO content attributable to peroxyacid groups is achieved by multiplying the<br>
wt% found above by 16 and finally dividing it by the molar mass of the peroxide<br>
involved. Free H2O2 does not influence the data generated by this method.<br>
In the Examples below, the total active oxygen content of the composition was<br>
measured as above (method (a)), the active oxygen content attributable to the<br>
peroxyacid groups of both the carboxylic acid having 1-8 carbon atoms and the<br>
polymeric thickener was determined using method (b), and the active oxygen<br>
content attributable to H2O2 was determined by subtracting the active oxygen<br>
content attributable to the peroxyacids (method (b)) from the total active oxygen<br>
content (method (a)).<br><br>
Example 1<br>
The following compounds were mixed in a two-litre beaker: 713.4 g water, 155.4 g<br>
of a 70% H2O2 solution, 0.70 g Dequest® 2010 (an aqueous solution of 1-<br>
hydroxyethyfidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid ex Solutia) and 0.40 g 2,6-pyridine<br>
dicarboxylic acid (dipicolinic acid). The resulting mixture was heated to 32°C while<br>
stirring. Then 5.0 g of CMC (Akucell AF 0305 ex Akzo Nobel): a food grade<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose with an average number of monomeric units of approx.<br>
2,000 and an average amount of -COOR groups per monomeric unit in the range<br>
of 0.8-1.2) were added and the mixture was homogenized by stirring for another 30<br>
minutes. Next, 165.4 g glutaric acid were added, followed after 5 minutes by 2.31 g<br>
of a 96% H2SO4 solution. The mixture was stirred for 60 min at 32°C and filtered<br>
through a glass filter (size G-2), yielding a clear, colourless solution. The mixture<br>
was then stored for 4 days at 30° C.<br>
The resulting solution had a pH of 1. Its composition and active oxygen (AO)<br>
content are indicated in Table 1. The formation of peroxyacid functionalities in the<br>
CMC was confirmed by spectroscopic analysis.<br>
Example 2<br>
In a two-litre beaker, 681.7 g water were heated to 50°C. 10.64 g CMC (5.32 g<br>
Akucell® AF 0305 and 5.32 g Akucell® AF 3275) were added slowly under stirring<br>
at 250 rpm. The CMC had an average amount of -COOR groups per monomeric<br>
unit in the range of 0.8-1.2. Stirring was continued at 1,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Full<br>
homogenization was attained. Dimethyl glutarate (187.9 g) was then added, the<br>
mixture was cooled down to 20°C, and dipicolinic acid (0.41 g) and Dequest® 2010<br>
(0.85 g) were added. Next, 13.8 g of a 20 wt% sulphuric acid solution were added<br>
under stirring, resulting in a decrease of the pH from 4.54 to 1.70.<br>
The obtained mixture was heated at 40°C and 148.9 g of a 70% H2O2 solution<br>
were added. The mixture was stirred for an additional 165 minutes at 40°C. The<br><br>
mixture was cooled down to 20°C and stored for 11 days. Its composition and<br>
active oxygen content are listed in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
A solution according to Example 1 was prepared, except that the CMC was<br>
replaced by 5.0 g of xanthan gum (Rhodopol® 23). Xanthan gum contains, on<br>
average, 0.6 -COOR groups per monomelic unit.<br>
The resulting solution had a pH of 1. Its composition and active oxygen content are<br>
indicated in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
The following compounds were mixed in a 25-litre vessel: 6,993.6 g water, 1,489.0<br>
g of a 70% H2O2 solution, 1,612.6 g glutaric acid, 4.07 g dipicolinic acid, 6.62 g<br>
Dequest® 2010, and 20.05 g of a 96% H2SO4 solution. The mixture was swirled for<br>
a few minutes, whereby the temperature rose adiabatically to 24°C. The mixture<br>
was stored for 5 days at 20°C in order to reach equilibrium.<br>
The resulting solution had a pH of 1. Its composition and active oxygen content are<br>
indicated in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
Comparative Example 4 was repeated, except that no glutaric acid was added. The<br>
active oxygen content is indicated in Table 1. No peroxyacids were detected.<br><br><br>
Table 1<br>
Example 6<br>
The samples of Example 1 and Comparative Examples 3 and 4 were tested as<br>
cleaning agents for china surfaces according to the following method.<br>
Tea was prepared by adding 2 litres of boiling water to 30 grams of Ceylon black<br>
tea. After standing for 5 minutes, the tea was filtered. To the filtrate, 0.1 ml of an<br>
aqueous iron sulphate solution (containing 5 g iron sulphate and 1 ml 37% HCI per<br>
litre) was added in order to darken any tea stains.<br>
A 180 ml tea cup was filled with 100 ml of the resulting tea mixture. The<br>
temperature of the mixture in the tea cup was 85°C. After 5 minutes, the tea<br>
mixture was removed from the cup using a pipette. The same cup was then again<br>
filled with the tea mixture, which was again removed with a pipette after 5 minutes.<br>
After 24 hours standing at room temperature, the now stained tea cup was sprayed<br>
with 2 grams of the solution according to one of the above-mentioned Examples.<br>
After 5 minutes, the cup was rinsed by being filled slowly with 175 ml of water at<br>
30°C, being left for 15 s, and then being emptied. The cups were evaluated for tea<br>
stains immediately. The results are listed in Table 2.<br>
The test shows that the composition according to the invention (Example 1) has a<br>
better cleaning performance than the composition with another type of thickener<br><br>
(Comp. Example 3) or no thickener at all (Comp. Example 4). The latter showed<br>
only very limited cleaning performance.<br><br>
Reference Examples 7-10<br>
A series of preparations was made to establish the degree of peroxidation of the<br>
thickening agents that can be achieved using the above-described manufacturing<br>
procedures. The compositions prepared do not contain ingredient c), i.e. the<br>
aliphatic carboxylic acid, its anhydride, alkyl ester, or peroxyacid. The following<br>
compounds were prepared:<br>
Reference Example 7<br>
To 356.7 g of demineralized water, 77.7 g H2O2-70%, 0.35 g Deques*® 2010, and<br>
0.20 g dipicolinic acid were added with stirring. The mixture was heated to 33ºC.<br>
Additionally, 3.75 g of CMC (Akucell AF 0305 ex Akzo Nobel) were solubilized over<br>
a period of about 60 min. Then, 1.16 g H2SO4-96% were added and the mixture<br>
was stirred at 33°C for another 120 min. The resulting mixture was filtered over a<br>
G-2 filter to remove traces of insoluble CMC. The mixture was then stored in an<br>
oven at 35°C for 4 days. pH after storage: 1.2.<br>
The AO associated with the peroxyacid groups formed from the reaction of<br>
hydrogen peroxide with the CMC was analyzed to be 0.3 wt%. Additionally, on<br>
aging for one week the concentration of AO associated with these chemical<br>
species rose to a level of 0.8 wt%.<br><br>
Reference Example 8<br>
To 356.7 g demineralized water, 77.7 g H2O2-70%, 0.35 g Dequest® 2010, and<br>
0.20 g dipicolinic acid were added with stirring. The mixture was heated to 33°C.<br>
Additionally, 3.75 g of xanthan gum (RhodopoKS) 23) were solubilized into the<br>
mixture over a period of about 60 min. Then, 1.16 g H2SO4-96% were added and<br>
the mixture was stirred at 33°C for another 60 min. After standing overnight (under<br>
slow stirring using a magnetic stirrer) the mixture was filtered and stored in an oven<br>
at 35°C for 4 days. pH after storage: 1.2.<br>
Although a very small amount of AO associated with the peroxyacid groups formed<br>
from reaction of the hydrogen peroxide with the xanthan gum is present, it is below<br>
the minimum level of detection to accurately quantify.<br>
Reference Example 9<br>
To 356.7 g demineralized water, 77.7 g H2O2-70%, 0.35 g Dequest® 2010, and<br>
0.20 g dipicolinic acid were added with stirring. The mixture was heated to 33°C.<br>
Additionally, 3.75 g of CMC (Akucell AF 0305 ex Akzo Nobel) were solubilized into<br>
the solution over a period of about 60 min. Then the mixture was stirred at 33°C for<br>
another 60 min, then slowly agitated using a magnetic stirrer bar overnight. The so<br>
obtained homogeneous mixture was then stored in an oven at 35°C for 4 days.<br>
The AO associated with peroxyacid groups formed from the reaction of hydrogen<br>
peroxide with the thickener was measured to be 0.3 wt%<br>
Reference Example 10<br>
To 356.7 g water, 0.35 g Dequest® 2010, and 0.20 g dipicolinic acid were added<br>
with stirring. The mixture was heated to 33°C. Additionally, 7.5 g of CMC (Food<br>
grade, ex Akzo Nobel) were solubilized into the solution over a period of about 45<br>
min. Then the mixture was stirred overnight using a magnetic stirrer bar. The so<br><br>
obtained homogeneous mixture was then analyzed for peroxyacid content. No<br>
peroxyacid groups were present in the sample.<br>
The compositions according to Reference Examples 7-10 were analyzed for their<br>
total active oxygen content and peroxyacid assay, using the methods described<br>
above. The samples were stored for 4 days at 35°C before analysis. The results of<br>
the analysis are shown in Table 3.<br>
The results of the analysis indicate that the polymeric thickeners are able to form<br>
peroxyacid groups. The composition of Reference Example 7 was also analyzed<br>
upon prolonged storage at room temperature. The analytical data indicate that the<br>
peroxyacid content increases upon storage.<br><br><br>
