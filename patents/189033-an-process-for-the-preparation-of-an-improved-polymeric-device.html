Example 1<br><br>
100 mg of poly (carboxyphenoxyvaleric acid) and 100 mg of poly (carboxyphenoxyhexane) were dissolved in 2 ml of dichioromethane to get a clear, homogeneous solution. This solution was injected through a hypodermic needle into 80 ml of liquid paraffin containing 10 per cent dichloromethane and 8 per cent sorbitan monooleate and ke~ptstirred at 400 rpm in a round-bottom flask. After 5 mm, 100 ml of petroleum ether was added over 20 mm. The hardened microspheres were isolated by filtering, washed with petroleum ether, and dried at room temperature for 2 hours under vacuum. These dried microspheres were stirred in 20 ml of 0.01 N sodium hydroxide solution for 12 hours. The microspheres were filtered, washed, and dried at room temperature for 8 hours over frised calcium chloride under vacuum. These microspheres were immersed in 5 ml of a 10% solution of p-nitrophenol in distilled<br><br>
water taken in a stoppered test tube. A few cycles of applying and releasing of vacuum were carried out on the system with intermittent swirling of the test tube. The microspheres were allowed to settle down and the supernatant solution was removed. The microspheres were then freeze-dried.<br><br><br><br>
Example-2<br><br>
50 mg of poly(carboxyphenoxyvaleric acid) and 150 mg of poly(carboxyphenoxy¬hexane) were dissolved in 2 ml of dichloromethane to get a clear, homogeneous solution. The solution is then injected through a hypodermic needle into 80 ml of 0.5 per cent aqueous solution of poly(vinyl alcohol) which was stirred at 400 rpm in a round-bottom flask. 5 mm after the addition of the solution, vacuum was applied to the system for one and a half hours. The poly(vinyl alcohol) solution was then diluted with distilled water, and the hardened microspheres were washed and stirred in 20 ml of 0.01 N sodium hydroxide solution for 12 hours. The microspheres were filtered. washed, and dried at room temperature for 8 hours over fused calcium chloride under vacuum. These microspheres were immersed in 5 ml of a 10% solution of the dye. Brilliant Blue BL. in distilled water taken in a stoppered test tube. A few cycles of applying and releasing of vacuum were carried out on the system with intermittent swirling of the test tube. The microspheres were allowed to settle down and the supernatant solution was removed. The microspheres were then freeze dried.<br><br>
Example-3<br><br>
125 mg of poly(carboxyphenoxyvaleric acid) and 375 mg of poly(carboxyphenoxv¬hexane) were taken in a glass cup of 2 ml capacity. The cup was heated to l70~~C. After the polymers melted, the contents were mixed well and dispersed into 30 ml of<br>
stirred silicone oil maintained at 1700C in a 100 ml beaker. After 3 mm. heati~1~ was stopped and the dispersion was allowed to cool to room temperature under continuous stirring. The silicone oil was diluted with petroleum ether and the microspheres were filtered, washed, and dried under vacuum for 2 hours. These dried microspheres were stirred in 30 ml of 0.01 N sodium hydroxide solution for 12 hours. The microspheres were filtered, washed, and dried at room temperature for<br><br>
8 hours over fused calcium chloride under vacuum. These microspheres were immersed in 5 ml of a 10% solution of p-nitrophenol in distilled water taken in a stoppered test tube. A few cycles of applying and releasing of vacuum were carried out on the system with intermittent swirling of the test tube. The microspheres were allowed to settle down and the supernatant solution was removed. The microspheres were then freeze-dried.<br><br>

Example-6<br><br>
250 mg of poly(carboxyphenoxyvaleric acid) and 750 mg of poly(carboxyphenoxy¬hexane) were mixed and packed compactly into a wire-extruding die of 0.5 cm<br><br><br>
internal diameter and 0.5 mm orifice diameter. The inner surface of the die was wetted with liquid paraffin before packing the polymer-dye mixture. The die was heated to 1600C using band heaters. After the polymers melted, the melt was extruded into a cooling bath containing liquid paraffin. The solidified extrudate was washed with n-hexane, dried, and cut into pellets of 3 mm length. These pellets were stirred in 50 ml of 0.01 N in sodium hydroxide solution for 12 hours. The pellets were filtered, washed, and dried at room temperature for 8 hours over fused calcium chloride under vacuum. These pellets were immersed in 5 ml of a 5% aqueous solu¬tion of p-nitrophenol taken in a stoppered test tube. A few cycles of applying and releasing of vacuum were carried out on the system with intermittent swirling of the test tube. The supernatant solution was removed. The pellets were then freeze-dried.<br><br><br><br><br>
