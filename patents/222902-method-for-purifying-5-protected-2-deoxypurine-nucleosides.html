				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
METHOD FOR PURIFYING 5'-PROTECTED 2'-DEOXYPURINE<br>
NUCLEOSIDES<br>
1.Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of purifying<br>
5'-protected 2'-deoxypurine nucleoside and a derivative<br>
thereof, as well as solvent-inclusion compounds thereof<br>
obtained by the method. More specifically, the present<br>
invention relates to a method of purifying 5'-protected<br>
2' -deoxypurine nucleosides useful for producing them as well<br>
as a solvent inclusion compounds of 5'-protected<br>
2'-deoxypurine nucleosides which are obtained by the<br>
purification method.<br>
2.Description of the Related Art<br>
5'-protected 2'-deoxy-b-purine nucleosides are<br>
compounds useful as raw materials for antisense DNA or the<br>
like, which has recently been developed.<br>
In recent years, with developments in manufacturing<br>
genomic drugs, antisense DNA drugs or the like have rapidly<br>
been developed. Therewith, a DNA oligomer used as a raw<br>
material, and further, protected deoxy nucleosides used as<br>
raw materials for the oligomer are increasingly demanded.<br>
Regarding the pharmaceutical uses, it is necessary to use an<br>
extremely highly purified intermediate product to reduce<br>
generation of by-products formed based on impurities to a<br>
minimum.<br>
As is clear from Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 58-180500<br>
and 63-179889, National Publication of International Patent<br>
Application No. 6-507883, etc., 5'-protected deoxypurine<br>
nucleosides have been purified by column chromatographic<br>
method till now. By this method, separation of impurities<br>
greatly different in their polarities or structures may be<br>
carried out relatively easily, but elimination of impurities<br>
having a similar structure is difficult. In particular, there<br>
are many cases where it is difficult to eliminate a<br>
3'-substituted isomer that is a especially problematic<br>
impurity. In addition, since this method needs a large-scale<br>
purification device, in view of mass production and mass supply<br>
in the future, it cannot help saying that this method has a<br>
large problem.<br>
Up till now, studies regarding elimination of impurities<br>
without using column chromatography have been made.<br>
Specifically, purification by reprecipitation method is<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 60-152495 and a<br>
PCT application. WO200075154. The reprecipitation method is<br>
a method in which, after a crude compound is dissolved in a<br>
soluble solvent, the compound is compulsively reprecipltated<br>
by addition of an insoluble solvent or dropping into an<br>
insoluble solvent. Consequently, its purification ability<br>
is basically low. Moreover, it is industrially difficult to<br>
appropriately control the amount ratio between the soluble<br>
solvent and the insoluble solvent. In addition, where the<br>
amount ratio of these solvents is set inappropriately, it<br>
easily results in oilification or generates a viscous<br>
precipitate so that purification is apt to end in failure.<br>
Actually, according to a method described in Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-Open No. 60-152495, in some cases, the purified product<br>
is obtained as a viscous syrupy substance, and, from an<br>
industrial viewpoint, this is a problem. Although some<br>
methods of forming amorphous by reprecipitation has been<br>
disclosed till now, no methods for obtaining a crystal by<br>
crystallization or recrystallization are known.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been completed in view of the<br>
conventional problems, and the object of the present invention<br>
is to provide a purification method, which is efficient and<br>
does not need special facilities by which extremely highly<br>
purified 5'-protected 2'-deoxypurine nucleosides can be<br>
obtained.<br>
As a result of intensive studies by the present inventors<br>
directed toward the above object, it has been found that, using<br>
a nltrile solvent such as acetonitrile, 5'-protected<br>
2' -deoxypurine nucleosides can be obtained as a crystal that<br>
includes the solvent, and then it can be purified by a<br>
purification method using crystallization or<br>
recrystallization, thereby completing the present invention.<br><br>

of the above listed other solvent (s) is 100% by weight or less<br>
with respect to the solvent for inclusion, preferably 20% by<br>
weight or less, and more preferably 10% by weight or less.<br>
The term "inclusion crystal" inclusing a solvent is herein<br>
used to mean that a solvent plays an auxiliary role to form<br>
a crystal structure, such that a crystal is formed in a form<br>
wherein a solvent is taken up into a crystal lattice thereof,<br>
or a complex is formed by a weak interaction between a crystal<br>
and a solvent. The inclusion form and the crystal structure<br>
are not particularly limited.<br>
The amount of a nitrile solvent in crystallization and<br>
recrystallization are not particularly limited, as far as the<br>
amount is below the saturation solubility of a compound to<br>
be purified to the solution, but desirably the amount of the<br>
solvent is 5 times by weight or more to 150 times by weight<br>
or less of the amount of the compound of the formula (1), and<br>
further desirably it is 8 times by weight or more to 50 times<br>
by weight or less of the amount of the compound of the formula<br>
(1).<br>
A temperature for crystallization and recrystallization<br>
are not particularly limited, but a temperature within a range<br>
from -10°C to the boiling point of a solvent or a liquid medium<br>
is desired. Generally, purification can be performed more<br>
sufficiently by a single time of recrystallization. but<br>
purification at higher purity can also be realized by<br>
performing recrystallization repeatedly. A preferable<br>
liquid medium for recrystallization is that consisting of a<br>
solvent for inclusion alone and it is more preferable to used<br>
the same single solvent for inclusion in both of<br>
crystallization and recrystallization.<br>
As stated above, according to the present invention, it<br>
becomes possible to efficiently purify protected 5' protected<br>
2'-deoxypurine nucleosides.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will be further specifically<br>
described in the following examples. The examples are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Production of a N2-lsobutyryl-5'-0-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)<br>
-2'-deoxyguanosine and acetonitrile (2:1) complex<br>
110 g (95% content) of N2-isobutyryl-2-deoxyguanosine<br>
was subjected to azeotropic dehydration with pyridine, and<br>
then dissolved in 2.4 L of pyridine. After adding 118.3 g<br>
of 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl chloride at room temperature, the<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. After<br>
neutralizing hydrochloric acid with sodium bicarbonate, the<br>
reaction solution was concentrated to about 400 g. After<br>
adding 1.5 L of ethyl acetate and 1.5 L of water were added<br>
thereto, the mixed solution was separated, and then washing<br>
with water was repeatedly performed until no<br>
N2-isobutyryl-2-deoxyguanosine as a raw material was found<br>
in an organic layer thereof. After washing with 1 kg of 20%<br>
sodium chloride solution, drying with sodium sulfate was<br>
performed. After performing filtration, a solvent was<br>
removed and ethyl acetate was then added so that the total<br>
amount became 700 g.<br>
This solution was dropped into 3,200 g of diisopropyl<br>
ether, while intensively stirring, and thereafter the obtained<br>
solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The<br>
solid obtained by filtration was subjected to vacuum drying<br>
at 5C0C, and after confirming that a constant weight was<br>
obtained, it was dissolved in 4.4 L of acetonitrile at room<br>
temperature. After stirring at room temperature for 4 hours.<br>
the deposited solid was filtrated. The obtained product was<br>
subjected to vacuum drying at room temperature for 4 hours<br>
and then an NMR analysis. It was found by the analysis that<br>
the obtained product included 2 molecules of acetonitrile per<br>
one molecule of the target compound to be purified. Where<br>
vacuum drying was performed at 40°C for 12 hours, it was found<br>
by the subsequent NMR analysis that the obtained product<br>
included one molecule of acetonitrile per one molecule of the<br>
target compound to be purified.<br>
Where vacuum drying was performed at 50°C for 15 hours,<br>
it was found by the subsequent NMR analysis that the obtained<br>
product included 0.67 molecule of acetonitrile perone molecule<br>
of the target compound to be purified. Further, where vacuum<br>
drying was performed at 55°C until a constant weight was<br>
obtained (for 24 hours), it was found by the subsequent NMR<br>
analysis that the obtained product included 0.5 molecule of<br>
acetoritrile per one molecule of the target compound to be<br>
purified. By X-ray diffraction (XRD). it was found that the<br>
obtained product was a crystal in any of the above dry conditions.<br>
Moreover, by TG-DTA analysis, it was found that, regarding<br>
a crystal included 0.5 molecule of acetonitrile per one<br>
molecule of the target compound to be purified, that was<br>
obtained by drying until a constant weight was obtained, the<br>
weight of the crystal was not reduced until a temperature was<br>
raised to the temperature for endothermic reaction (81°C to<br>
93°C), the crystal having no attached solvent. The yield was<br>
168 g (yield rate 84.8%). As a result of an analysis by HPLC<br>
(UV 254 nm). the purity was 99.7% by area. The largest impurity<br>
was N2-isobutyryl-3',5'-O-bis(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-2'-<br>
deoxyguanosine (0.17% by area).<br>

Example 2<br>
Production of <br>
N6-benzoyl-5' -0- (4,4' -dimsthoxytrltyl)-2' -deoxgadengsine<br>
45.0 g (0.127 mol) of N6-benzoyldeoxyadenosine was<br>
dissolved in 500 ml of pyridine followed by azeotropic<br>
dehydration, and then the obtained product was dissolved in<br>
500 ml. of pyridine. While stirring. 42.9 g (0.127 mol) of<br>
4.4'-climethoxytrityl chloride was added thereto, and the<br>
mixture was further stirred at room temperature for 2.5 hours.<br>
After 12.8 g of sodium bicarbonate was added thereto and the<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, a<br>
solvent was removed at reduced pressure. To the residue, 830<br>
ml of methylisobutylketone was added, and while stirring 830<br>
ml of water was further added thereto followed by stirring<br>
for 10 minutes. Subsequently, an organic layer thereof was<br>
collected, washed with a saturated saline solution and dried<br>
with sodium sulfate, and thereafter a solvent was removed at<br>
reduced pressure. The residue was dropped in 800 ml of<br>
diiscpropyl ether that was intensively stirred, and the<br>
genezated precipitate was collected by filtration.<br>
 The precipitate was recrystallized from 750 ml of<br>
acetcnitrile, and the crystal product was collected by<br>
filtration. As a result of an NMR analysis, the product<br>
included one molecule of acetonitrile per one molecule of the<br>
target compound to be purified. When the crystal product was<br>
subjected to vacuum drying, acetonitrile was lost. The weight<br>
was 66.7 g. When the obtained product was analyzed by high<br>
performance liquid chromatography [ODS: octadecyl silica gel<br>
column. acetonitrile/water (8:2)], using a UV detector (254<br>
nm), the purity was 99.5%. The yield of<br>
