				<td>GRAY SODA-LIME SILICATE GLASS COMPOSITION INTENDED FOR THE<br>
MANUFACTURE OF WINDOWS<br>
The invention relates to a soda-lime silicate glass composition of gray color, in<br>
particular for producing flat glass by the float process on a bath of molten metal, such as<br>
tin, or by rolling, this glass being intended to form windows for the building and<br>
automobile industries.<br>
Bulk-tinted gray glass is generally sought after for its esthetic character and for<br>
the specific properties that it may have, especially protective properties as regards solar<br>
radiation.<br>
In the building field, such glass is used in particular for glazing buildings located<br>
in regions exposed to strong sunlight, but can also be employed for decoration, for<br>
example in the form of furniture, components and balustrades for flat roofs, or stairwells.<br>
Gray glass may also be used as windows for automobiles, especially rear windows, and<br>
for railroad vehicles.<br>
Soda-lime silicate glass is in general widely manufactured in the form of a ribbon<br>
by the float process, the ribbon then being cut into the form of sheets that may<br>
subsequently be bent or undergo a treatment for enhancing the mechanical properties,<br>
for example a thermal toughening operation.<br>
The desirable gray coloration is obtained by adding, as coloring agents, selenium<br>
and cobalt to the standard soda-lime silicate composition.<br>
The amount of selenium and cobalt to be introduced depends on the initial iron<br>
content in the standard composition, and more particularly on the Fe2O3 content that<br>
gives the glass a yellow to green coloration. Selenium provides a pink, red or orange<br>
component depending on the oxidation state that it is in, which component is set against<br>
that of iron, thereby allowing the final color of the glass to be adjusted.<br>
However, the use of selenium in glass compositions has several drawbacks from<br>
the industrial standpoint.<br>
In glass, selenium exists in several stable oxidation states, some of which give<br>
the glass a particular and relatively intense coloration (for example Se° gives a pink<br>
coloration). In addition, the final color depends on the nature of the other colorants<br>
present in the glass, with which selenium can be combined: for example, Se2- forms a<br>
chromophore with the ferric ions, which gives the glass a red-brown coloration. To<br>
control the tint therefore requires the redox to be very precisely controlled within a<br>
relatively narrow range of values.<br>
Next, the temperature within the furnace in which the glass batch is melted is<br>
very much greater than the selenium vaporization temperature. It follows that most of<br>
the selenium (more than 85%) is in the atmosphere of the furnace, which means that<br>
the stacks have to be equipped with electrostatic filters for retaining the selenium<br>
present in the flue gases and the dust. Added to the already very high cost of these<br>
filtration devices is the problem of recycling the dust retained by the filters, only some of<br>
which can be reintroduced into the furnace.<br>
It has in fact been proposed to limit selenium fly-off by adding oxidizing agents to<br>
the glass batch so as to obtain oxidized forms of selenium that are more soluble in the<br>
glass. However, this method is not satisfactory since the recommended oxidizing agents<br>
are nitrates, usually sodium nitrates, which generate considerable NOX emissions as an<br>
additional source of pollution.<br>
Finally, selenium has a high toxicity, even at low concentration, in particular when<br>
it is in the form of a selenite or selenate. Special measures are therefore necessary for<br>
handling it.<br>
To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, several solutions have been<br>
proposed with the aim of completely or partly eliminating selenium in glass<br>
compositions.<br>
It has been envisioned to replace selenium with cadmium sulfide CdS and/or<br>
cadmium selenide CdSe. Under the conditions of the process, these compounds cannot<br>
be used because of their very high toxicity.<br>
It has also been proposed to use copper, which, in colloidal (Cu° or Cu2O) form<br>
gives a red-to-green coloration. However, the crystallization of copper aggregates is a<br>
tricky operation to control and furthermore requires an additional heat treatment in order<br>
to reveal the color.<br>
In US-A-5 264 400, it has been proposed to replace some of the selenium with<br>
erbium oxide Er2O3. The glass obtained has a bronze color and contains 0.2 to 0.6%<br>
iron, 0.1 to 1% CeO2, 0 to 50 ppm CoO, 0 to 100 ppm NiO, 0.2 to 3% Er2O3 and 3 to<br>
50 ppm Se.<br>
The coloring power of erbium oxide is relatively low and the amount to be<br>
introduced into the glass is high. Moreover, erbium oxide is a compound not found<br>
widely in the natural state, and it is also found mixed with other oxides and therefore<br>
has to undergo purification treatments. Its cost is consequently very high.<br>
US-A-5 656 500 has proposed a selenium-free gray or bronze glass containing<br>
the following colorants: 0 to 0.45% Fe2O3, 0 to 0.5% V2O5, 0.5 to 2% MnO2, 0 to 0,05%<br>
NiO, 0 to 0.1% CuO and 0 to 0.008% CoO.<br>
Another solution widely reported in the literature consists of the use of nickel<br>
oxide.<br>
JP-B-52 49010 has proposed a soda-lime silicate glass containing 0.1 to 05%<br>
Fe2O3, 0.003 to 0.02% CoO, 0.0005 to 0.0010% Se and 0 to 0.002% NiO.<br>
EP 677 492 has disclosed a gray-to-green glass containing 0.45 to 0.95% total<br>
iron, 0.09 to 0.185% FeO, 8 to 30 ppm cobalt and at least one of the following<br>
components: Se (0-10 ppm), MnO (0-0.5%) and NiO (0-30 ppm).<br>
FR-A-2 672 587 has disclosed a gray glass for automobiles, comprising 0.2 to<br>
0.6% ion, 5 to 50 ppm Se, 0 to 50 ppm CoO, 0 to 100 ppm NiO, 0 to 1% TiO2 and 0.1 to<br>
1%CeO2.<br>
JP-B-56 41579, has proposed a gray glass containing 0.1 to 0.2% Fe2O3, 0.02<br>
to 0.06% NiO, 0.001 to 0.004% CoO and 0.01 to 0.5% MnO. This glass has a shade<br>
ranging from purplish blue to purplish red.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to propose a selenium-free gray soda-<br>
lime silicate glass composition that can be used to form windows, particularly for<br>
buildings, this composition retaining optical properties similar to those of the known<br>
compositions that contain selenium.<br>
This object is achieved according to the present invention by the gray glass<br>
composition that comprises the following coloring agents with contents varying within<br>
the following weight limits:<br>
Fe2O3 (total iron) 0.01 to 0.14%<br>
CoO 40 to 150 ppm<br>
NiO 200 to 700 ppm<br>
the NiO/CoO weight ratio being between 3.5 and 6 and the glass having an overall light<br>
transmission (TLD65) under illuminant D65 of between 20 and 60% measured for a<br>
thickness of 6 mm.<br>
As indicated above, a glass falling within the scope of the present invention is<br>
gray glass, that is to say it has a transmission curve as a function of the visible<br>
wavelength that is practically invariant.<br>
In the CIE (International Lighting Commission) system, gray substances do not<br>
have a dominant wavelength and their excitation purity is zero. By extension, any<br>
substance whose curve is relatively flat in the visible range, but which nevertheless has<br>
weak absorption bands allowing a dominant wavelength to be defined, and a low but<br>
nonzero purity is generally accepted as being gray.<br>
The gray glass according to the invention is consequently defined by its<br>
chromatic coordinates L*, a* and b* measured under the standard illuminant D65 defined<br>
by the CIE, which represents average daylight, with UV, having a color temperature of<br>
6500 K, allowing the optical properties of windows for buildings with a thickness of 6<br>
mm to be evaluated. The glass according to the invention is defined as follows:<br>
L* varies from 50 to 85, preferably 65 to 75;<br>
a* varies from - 4 to 0; and<br>
b* varies from - 5 to + 3.<br>
The use of the aforementioned coloring agents within the limits of the invention<br>
gives the desired gray coloration and also allows the optical and energy properties of<br>
the glass to be optimally adjusted.<br>
The action of the colorants taken individually is in general well described in the<br>
literature.<br>
The presence of iron in a glass composition may result from the raw materials, as<br>
impurities, or from an intentional addition with the aim of coloring the glass. It is known<br>
that iron exists in the form of ferric (Fe3+) ions and ferrous (Fe2+) ions. The presence of<br>
Fe3+ ions gives the glass a slight yellow coloration and allows ultraviolet radiation to be<br>
absorbed. The presence of Fe2+ ions gives the glass a more pronounced green-blue<br>
coloration and induces absorption of infrared radiation. The increase in iron content in<br>
both its forms increases the absorption of radiation at the extremities of the visible<br>
spectrum, this effect taking place to the detriment of light transmission. Conversely, by<br>
reducing the proportion of iron, particularly in Fe2+ form, the performance in terms of<br>
energy transmission is degraded, while the light transmission increases.<br>
In the present invention, the total iron content in the composition is between 0.01<br>
and 0.14%, preferably between 0.07 and 0.12%. An iron content of less than 0.01%<br>
means having to have raw materials with a high degree of purity, which makes the cost<br>
of the glass much too high for use as windows in buildings. Above 0.14% iron, the glass<br>
composition does not have the desired coloration. It should be emphasized that here<br>
this is a low iron content, making it possible to produce glass by the float process in<br>
plants dedicated to the production of « clear » glass, in which the maximum iron content<br>
is of the order of 0.1%. By operating under such conditions, the transition time needed<br>
for switching from one glass composition to another can be reduced and also allows the<br>
total amount of energy needed to melt the glass batch to be lowered, which helps to<br>
reduce the cost of the glass.<br>
Furthermore, the low iron content used in the compositions according to the<br>
invention makes it possible to have an a* value close to zero, that is to say one that<br>
does not give glass too green a shade. In particular, when the glass is intended to be<br>
thermally toughened, it is beneficial to have an a* value of greater than - 3, as this<br>
tends to approach 0 after toughening, which means that the glass becomes even more<br>
neutral.<br>
Cobalt produces an intense blue coloration and also decreases the light<br>
transmission. The amount must therefore be perfectly controlled in order to make the<br>
light transmission compatible with the use for which the glass is intended. According to<br>
the invention, the cobalt oxide content is between 40 and 150 ppm, preferably between<br>
70 and 90 ppm.<br>
Nickel oxide gives the glass a brown coloration. In the present invention, the<br>
nickel oxide content is limited to 700 ppm so as to prevent it from combining with sulfur<br>
compounds coming from the raw materials or from other compounds intentionally<br>
added, which form nickel sulfide balls. It is in fact well known that the « high<br>
temperature » phase of nickel sulfide, which is « frozen in » during thermal toughening,<br>
may progressively be transformed into a « low temperature » phase, the larger size of<br>
which induces mechanical stresses that shatter the glass, hence the risk of an accident.<br>
Preferably, the nickel oxide content is between 300 and 500 ppm.<br>
By combining NiO and CoO in a weight ratio of between 3.5 and 6, it is possible<br>
to obtain the gray color that corresponds to the abovementioned chromatic coordinates.<br>
By varying the NiO/CoO, it is especially possible to adjust the b* value in the region<br>
corresponding to a blue shade, this shade proving to be particularly beneficial from the<br>
esthetic appearance standpoint.<br>
As a general rule, it is typical to predict the optical and energy properties of a<br>
glass when it contains several coloring agents. These properties result in fact from a<br>
complex interaction between the various agents, the behavior of which is directly<br>
dependent on their oxidation state.<br>
In the present invention, the choice of colorants, their content and their<br>
oxidation/reduction state is key in obtaining the gray coloration and the optical<br>
properties.<br>
In particular, the redox defined by the ratio of the weight content of ferrous oxide<br>
(expressed as FeO) to the weight content of total iron (expressed as Fe2O3) varies from<br>
0.1 to 0.3, preferably from 0.15 to 0.28, for reasons essentially associated with the<br>
melting and refining of the glass.<br>
The redox is generally controlled using oxidizing agents such as sodium sulfate<br>
and reducing agents such as coke, the relative contents of which are adjusted in order<br>
to obtain the desired redox.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, the glass composition is<br>
characterized in that the NiO/CoO weight ratio is between 5 and 6, which allows glasses<br>
having a b* value between -1 and +2 to be obtained.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the invention, the glass composition is<br>
characterized in that the NiO/CoO weight ratio is between 3.5 and 4.5, thus making it<br>
possible to have a b* value that varies from -5 to -1, corresponding to a bluish glass.<br>
It has been found that by selecting the NiO/CoO ratio within the range of values<br>
indicated, it is possible for the b* value to lie between -5 and +3 before toughening,<br>
corresponding to a neutral-to-blue shade. As will be indicated later, it is particularly<br>
advantageous to control the NiO/CoO ratio in order to obtain a glass having a gray<br>
coloration after a thermal toughening step.<br>
The composition according to the invention makes it possible to obtain a glass<br>
preferably possessing an overall light transmission TLD65 of between 35 and 50% for a<br>
thickness of 6 mm, which makes it useful for the suppression of dazzling by sunlight.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the composition contains no Se and no<br>
MnO2.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the gray glass<br>
composition comprises the following colorants in contents that vary within the following<br>
weight limits:<br>
Fe2O3 (total iron) 0.07 to 0.12%;<br>
CoO 70 to 90 ppm;<br>
NiO 300 to 500 ppm.<br>
Using the above preferred composition, it is possible to obtain a glass whose<br>
overall light transmission (TLD65) is between 35 and 45% for a glass thickness of 6 mm.<br>
The term « soda-lime silicate » is used here in a broad sense and relates to any<br>
glass composition consisting of a glass matrix that comprises the following constituents<br>
(in percentages by weight):<br>
SiO2 64 - 75%<br>
AI2O3 0 - 5%<br>
B2O3 0 - 5%<br>
CaO 5-15%<br>
MgO 0-10%<br>
Na2O 10-18%<br>
K2O 0 - 5%<br>
BaO 0 - 5%.<br>
It is recommended here that the soda-lime silicate glass composition may<br>
include, apart from the inevitable impurities contained especially in the raw materials, a<br>
small proportion (up to 1%) of other constituents, for example agents (SO3, Cl, Sb2O3,<br>
As2O3) that help in melting or refining the glass or coming from the optional addition of<br>
recycled cullet into the glass batch.<br>
In the glass according to the invention, the silica content is generally maintained<br>
within narrow limits for the following reasons. Above 75%, the viscosity of glass and its<br>
ability to devitrify greatly increase, which makes it more difficult for the glass to melt and<br>
to flow on a bath of molten tin. Below 64%, the hydrolytic resistance of the glass rapidly<br>
decreases, and the transmission in the visible also decreases.<br>
The alkali metal oxides Na2O and K2O facilitate melting of the glass and allow its<br>
viscosity at high temperatures to be adjusted so as to keep it close to that of a standard<br>
glass. K2O can be used up to 5%, as above this the problem of the high cost of the<br>
composition arises. Moreover, the K2O content may be increased, but, for the most part,<br>
only to the detriment of the Na2O content, which helps to increase the viscosity. The<br>
sum of the Na2O and K2O contents, expressed as percentages by weight, is preferably<br>
equal to or greater than 10% and advantageously less than 20%. If the sum of these<br>
contents is greater than 20% or if the Na2O content is greater than 18%, the hydrolytic<br>
resistance is greatly reduced.<br>
Alkaline-earth metal oxides allow the viscosity of the glass to be matched to the<br>
production conditions.<br>
MgO may be used up to about 10% and its omission may be at least partly<br>
compensated for by an increase in the Na2O content and/or the SiO2 content.<br>
Preferably, the MgO content is less than 5% and particularly advantageously is less<br>
than 2%, which has the effect of increasing the infrared absorption capacity without<br>
impairing the transmission in the visible.<br>
BaO allows the light transmission to be increased and it can be added to the<br>
composition with a content of less than 5%.<br>
BaO has a much smaller effect than CaO and MgO on the viscosity of the glass<br>
and an increase in its content is essentially to the detriment of the alkaline-earth oxides,<br>
MgO and most particularly CaO. Any increase in BaO helps to increase the viscosity of<br>
the glass at low temperatures. Preferably, the glass according to the invention contains<br>
no BaO.<br>
Apart from complying with the limits defined above or the variation in the content<br>
of each alkaline-earth metal oxide, it is preferable in order to obtain the desired<br>
transmission properties to limit the sum of the MgO, CaO and BaO weight contents to a<br>
value of 15% or less.<br>
The composition according to the invention may furthermore include additives, for<br>
example agents that modify the optical properties within certain parts of the spectrum,<br>
especially within the ultraviolet range, such as CeO2, TiO2, WO3, La2O3 and V2O5. The<br>
total content of these additives does not in general exceed 2% by weight of the<br>
composition, and preferably does not exceed 1%.<br>
The glass composition according to the invention can be melted under float glass<br>
and rolled glass production conditions. The melting generally takes place in fired<br>
furnaces, optionally provided with electrodes for heating the glass through the bulk by<br>
passing an electric current between the two electrodes. To facilitate melting, and<br>
especially to make this mechanically beneficial, the glass composition advantageously<br>
has a temperature corresponding to a viscosity ? such that log? = 2 which is less than<br>
1500°C. More preferably, the temperature corresponding to the viscosity ? such that<br>
logri = 3.5 (denoted by T(log ?=3.5)) and the liquidous temperature (denoted by Tliq)<br>
satisfy the equation:<br>
Tlog ? = 3.5 - Tliq &gt; 20°C<br>
and better still:<br>
Tlog ? = 3.5 - Tliq &gt; 50°C.<br>
The thickness of the glass sheet formed generally varies between 2 and 19 mm.<br>
In the float process, the thickness of the ribbon obtained by sheeting out the<br>
molten glass on the tin bath preferably varies between 3 and 10 mm for glazing<br>
intended for buildings.<br>
By rolling, the thickness of the glass preferably varies between 4 and 10 mm.<br>
The glass sheet obtained by cutting the glass ribbon may subsequently undergo<br>
a bending and/or toughening operation.<br>
Thermal toughening is a well-known operation that consists in heating the glass<br>
sheet to a temperature of around 600 to 700°C for a time that does not generally<br>
exceed a few minutes and in suddenly cooling it, for example by pressurized air jets.<br>
The toughened glass sheet obtained from the composition according to the<br>
invention is noteworthy in that it has a gray coloration characterized in particular by an<br>
a* value varying from - 2 to 0 and a b* value varying from -10 to + 2, preferably from - 4<br>
to 0.<br>
Under the thermal toughening conditions, the variation in the color of the glass is<br>
adjusted by the relative NiO content. It has been found that, in the toughened glass, the<br>
chemical environment of the nickel is modified, giving it different absorption properties.<br>
This results in an increase in the a* value and a decrease in the b* value. These<br>
changes are greater the higher the NiO content.<br>
The glass sheet obtained may also undergo other subsequent treatment<br>
operations, for example for the purpose of coating it with one or more metal oxide films<br>
for the purpose of reducing its heat-up by solar radiation.<br>
The glass sheet according to the invention has high solar radiation transmission<br>
values due to the low iron content. However, the transmission may be easily reduced by<br>
coating that surface of the glass which is exposed to the solar radiation with one or<br>
more films of at least one metal oxide, for example silver oxide, which has the effect of<br>
reflecting infrared radiation without appreciably modifying the color of the glass.<br>
The optionally toughened glass sheet can be used as such or can be combined<br>
with another glass sheet to form glazing for buildings.<br>
The examples of the glass compositions given below give a better appreciation of<br>
the advantages of the present invention.<br>
In these examples, the values of the following properties measured for a glass<br>
thickness of 6 mm are indicated:<br>
- the overall light transmission factor (TLD65) under illuminant D65 measured between<br>
380 and 780 nm and calculated according to the EN 410 standard, together with the<br>
chromatic coordinates L*, a* and b*. The calculations are carried out taking the CIE<br>
1931 colorimetric reference observer;<br>
- the redox defined as the ratio of FeO to total iron expressed in the form of Fe2O3. The<br>
total iron content is measured by X-ray fluorescence and the FeO content is measured<br>
using wet chemistry.<br>
Each of the compositions given in Table 1 was produced from the following glass<br>
matrix, the contents of which are expressed in percentages by weight, this being<br>
corrected as regards silica in order to be matched to the total content of coloring agents<br>
added:<br>
SiO2 71%<br>
AI2O3 0.70%<br>
CaO 8.90%<br>
MgO 3.80%<br>
Na2O 14.10%<br>
K2O 0.10%.<br>
The glass obtained was thermally toughened in a furnace at 600-700°C for 1 to 3<br>
minutes, and was then cooled by nozzles blasting air at a pressure of 1 bar (0.1 MPa)<br>
for 1 minute.<br>
All the glass compositions according to the invention (examples 1 to 14) were<br>
characterized by an overall light transmission (TLD65) of between 20 and 60% and a<br>
gray coloration, these characteristics being comparable to those obtained with a glass<br>
containing selenium (comparative example 2). However, the markedly lower iron<br>
content than in comparative example 1 allows the composition to be used in « clear»<br>
glass plants as indicated above.<br>
Compared with the gray glass of comparative example 1 without selenium but<br>
containing nickel oxide, the glass compositions of the invention have a more neutral<br>
gray coloration before and after the thermal toughening step. This results from the lower<br>
iron content.<br>
