AN EDIBLE COMPOSITION COMPRISING A BIOAVAILABLE IRON COMPOUND AND A BIOAVAILABLE ZINC COMPOUND<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
30-11-2008				                             GRANTED<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the use of certain micro-nutrients in the preparation of an edible composition for aiding the cognitive development or performance of humans having an age of up to 18 years. It also relates to a method of aiding the cognitive development or performance of such humans by using the aforementioned edible composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the link between nutrition and cognitive performance in humans, especially, in the impact of nutrition on the development of cognitive abilities during childhood.<br>
Iron is thought to be an important nutrient for the cognitive performance and development of children because the areas of the brain that are sensitive to iron deficiency (such as the cortex, frontal lobes and hippocampus) are the areas responsible for higher level cognitive functions such as executive functions and memory (Beard, 1995, American Journal of Nutrition, 62, 709-710).<br>
Zinc may have independent effects on cognitive performance, as well as an indirect effect through the enhancement of the efficacy of iron (Black &amp; Miguel, 2001, The emerging roles of zinc in human nutrition, development and infectious disease, part 1, Nutrition Today, 36, 281-290). Zinc is important for cognitive performance and development of children because it is important for myelination and release of the neurotransmitters<br><br>
GABA and glutamate that are key modulators of neuronal excitability (Bhatnagar &amp; Taneja, 2001, Zinc &amp; cognitive development. British Journal of Nutrition, 85, S139-S145). Intervention studies show that 20mg/day zinc plus other micronutrients has a positive effect on reasoning and visual recognition in Chinese and Mexican American school-aged children (Penland, 2000, Behavioural data and methodological issues in studies of zinc nutrition in humans, Journal of Nutrition, 130, 361S-364S).<br>
Vitamin B-6 may affect the glutaminergic system and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor that is important for learning and memory (Calvaresi &amp; Bryan, 2001, B vitamins, cognition and ageing: A review.  Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, 56, P327-P339). Correlational studies in children in India (Refsum et al., 2001 - Hyperhomocysteinemia and elevated methylmalonic acid indicate a high prevalence of cobalamin deficiency in Asian Indians. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 74, 233-241) and Indonesia (Setiawan, et al., 2000 Vitamin B-6 inadequacy is prevalent in rural, and urban Indonesian children. Journal of Nutrition, 130, 553-558) have shown associations between B-12 and B-6 deficiency and poorer cognitive performance.<br>
Certain omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) have been linked with cognitive performance. Studies have shown that infants who are fed formula milk supplemented with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a-linolenic acid (ALA) and arachidonic acid (AA), and those who are breast-fed demonstrate better visual acuity and cognitive performance, including problem solving (Uauy et al, 2001, Essential fatty acids in<br><br>
iomatic growth and brain development. Nutrition and fitness: &gt;iet, genes, physical activity and health. NY: Karger. pp.134-60).<br>
'O03/003981 discloses compositions which are claimed to be eneficial in improving mental performance. These compositions  omprise vitamin B12 on ion exchange resin, docosahexaenoic acid, ertain herbal extracts and may comprise iron and/or zinc.<br>

There is an increasing demand in the art for edible compositions that will aid the cognitive development or performance of humans, especially those having an age of up to 18 years. Preferably, such edible compositions can be added to ordinary foodstuffs, or, they can be consumed separately e.g. as a foodstuff in its own right.<br>
The present invention seeks to provide edible compositions that aid the cognitive development and/or performance of humans, especially those having an age of up to 18 years.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the invention to provide compositions that aid the cognitive development and/or performance of humans, especially those having an age of up to 18 years and that can be added to ordinary foodstuffs, or, can be consumed separately.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that edible compositions according to the invention, can aid the cognitive development or performance of humans, especially those having an age of up to 18 years. These edible compositions can be added to ordinary foodstuffs, or, can be consumed separately.<br>
According to a first aspect, the present invention provides the use of;<br>
1.	a bioavailable iron compound and a bioavailable zinc compound in a weight ratio of at least 2:1, and<br>
2.	at least one B vitamin,<br><br>
in the manufacture of an edible composition, for use in aiding the cognitive development or cognitive performance of humans having an age of up to 18 years.<br>
According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a method for aiding the cognitive development or cognitive performance of humans having an age of up to 18 years, the method comprising the step of administering to said human by means of an edible composition;<br>
1)	a bioavailable iron compound, and a bioavailable zinc compound in a weight ratio of at least 2:1, and<br>
2)	at least one B vitamin.<br>
It is preferred according to both the second and first aspect of the invention that the edible composition after consumption aids the cognitive development or performance of humans having an age of from 6 to 9 years.<br>
The terms "cognition" and "cognitive function" as used herein   are interchangeable and refer to a construct of a range of functions:<br>
—	Intelligence (fluid, crystallised),<br>
—	Creativity (generate and open to new ideas, perceive new relationships),<br>
&gt; — Memory (encoding, storage, retrieval),<br>
-	Executive functions (dealing with novelty, planning &amp;<br>
implementation, monitoring performance, vigilance, inhibition<br>
of task irrelevant info),<br>
-	Cognitive resources (speed of information processing, working<br>
)  memory capacity, attentional capacity).<br>
The term "cognitive development" as used herein refers to<br><br>
the development of cognition (cognitive function) over time. The quality of cognition (cognitive function) in a human can be assessed by tests measuring cognitive performance. As cognition (cognitive function) of a growing child develops over time with   brain development, measuring the cognitive performance over time for a given child, provides a measure of cognitive development. For example, for children aged 6-9 years, cognitive development is generally recognised by :<br>
—	A spurt in information processing capacity and/or executive<br>
 	functions.<br>
—	Development of the frontal lobes of the brain (involved in<br>
executive functions).  These growth spurts may also occur at<br>
other periods during childhood (e.g. 0-2 and mid-teens).<br>
The present invention provides a convenient and effective way of aiding the cognitive development or performance of humans having an age of up to 18 years.<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word  about". All amounts are as percentages by weight unless otherwise stated.  For the edible compositions, all percentages are by weight based on the total weight of the composition unless otherwise stated.<br>
The term "comprising" is meant not to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance.  In other words the listed steps, elements or options need not be exhaustive.  Whenever the words "including" or "having" are<br><br>
used, these terms are meant to be equivalent to "comprising" as defined above.<br>
A serving of the edible composition as referred to herein refers to the amount of the edible composition that is provided to be consumed as a single portion, typically in a single sitting.  For beverages, the typical serving size is in the range of from 100 to 500 ml and for a bar product or cookie etc will be in the range of from 20 to 100 g.  However, it will be understood that the serving size will vary according to the type of edible composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
According to the present invention, edible compositions that comprise the specific mixture of nutrients according to the present invention can be used to aid the cognitive development or performance of humans having an age of up to 18 years. Further details of the edible compositions and their components are given below.<br>
Iron compound<br>
The present invention uses a bioavailable iron compound, that<br>
is, an iron compound that is at least partially bioavailable to<br>
the body. Any bioavailable iron compound may be used according<br>
to the present invention although ferrous iron is generally<br>
better utilized by the body than ferric iron.<br>
Bioavailable iron compounds which can be used include edible inorganic iron compounds such as edible ferrous compounds, for example ferrous sulfate. Whilst ferrous iron is typically more bioavailable, certain ferric salts can also provide highly bioavailable compounds of iron and these may also be used<br><br>
according to the present invention. Suitable examples include ferric sulfate and ferric chloride and mixtures thereof.<br>
Edible bioavailable iron organic compounds may also be used according to the present invention. Preferred examples include ferrous carboxylate salts such as ferrous fumurate, ferrous succinate, ferrous tartarate, ferrous lactate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous citrate and mixtures thereof. Whilst, as stated above ferrous iron is typically more bioavailable, highly bioayailable edible ferric compounds that may be used in the present invention include ferric carboxylate salts such as ferric ammonium citrate, ferric citrate and mixtures thereof.<br>
An especially preferred bioavailable iron organic compound is ferric EDTA (sodium ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or sodium iron ethylenediaminotetracetic acid, NaFeEDTA). Ferric EDTA has the advantage that it does not appreciably interchange with other cations often present in a edible compositions with added vitamin/mineral mixes (e.g., sodium, calcium, potassium, zinc, iodine, vitamin C, vitamin E, and the like) and thus no significant free iron is generated. This aids in the colour and flavour stability of the food product. It is also relatively stable in edible compositions and has good bioavailability.<br>
Other edible iron, organic compounds which can be used according to the present invention include bioavailable iron-sugar-carboxylate complexes. These materials are referred to herein as "complexes," but they may, in fact, exist in solution as complicated, highly hydrated, protected colloids. However, the term "complex" is used for the purpose of simplicity. Such materials are described in US 6 509 045 which is incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
In these iron-sugar-carboxylate complexes, the carboxylate provides the counterion for the ferrous (preferred) or ferric iron. Sugars that can be used to produce these complexes include any of the edible saccharidic sugars such as glucose, sucrose and fructose, mannose, galactose, lactose, maltose, and the like, with sucrose and fructose being preferred. Mixtures thereof may also be used. The carboxylic acid used may be any edible carboxylic acid such as citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, propionic acid, and mixtures thereof. Particular examples include ferric saccharide, ferric saccharate and mixtures thereof.<br>
US 6 509 045 also discloses that it is known that iron is more bioavailable if administered in the form of chelates wherein the chelating ligands are amino acids or protein hydrolysates (see U.S. 3,969,540 and U.S. 4,020,158). These chelated iron compounds are known in the art by various names such as iron proteinates, iron amino acid chelates and peptide or polypeptide chelates. Such materials may also be used according to the present invention.<br>
Particularly suitable ferrous amino acid chelates are those where the reacting ligands are glycine, lysine, and leucine, including the ferrous amino acid chelate where the reacting ligand is glycine.<br>
Ferrous amino acid chelates particularly suitable as highly bioavailable amino acid chelated irons for use in the present invention are those having a ligand to metal ratio of at least 2:1. For example, suitable ferrous amino acid chelates having a ligand to metal mole ratio of two are those of formula: Fe(L) 2 where L is an alpha amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide or<br><br>
quadrapeptide reacting ligand. Thus, L can be any reacting ligand that is a naturally occurring alpha amino acid selected from alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, cystine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, hydroxyproline, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine or dipeptides, tripeptides or uadrapeptides formed by any combination of these alpha amino acids. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,969,540 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,158 rfhich are incorporated by reference.<br>
Elemental iron may also be used according to the present Invention and is considered herein to be a bioavailable compound even though, strictly speaking, it is not a compound.<br>
mixtures of one or more of any of the above bioavailable iron compounds may also be used. It is preferred that the bioavailable iron compound is selected from ferrous inorganic compounds, ferrous carboxylate salts, iron-sugar-carboxylate complexes, chelated iron compounds and mixtures thereof. The bioavailable iron compounds, where appropriate, may be in a hydrated form. An especially preferred bioavailable iron compound is sodium ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or sodium iron ethylenediaminotetracetic acid, known as NaFeEDTA.<br>
the bioavailable iron compounds, may if desired, be in an encapsulated form.<br>
the amount of bioavailable iron compound used in the edible composition may be any amount which aids the cognitive ievelopment or performance of humans having an age of up to 18 fears provided that the requirement for the weight ratio of iron to zinc according to the present invention is met. It is<br><br>
preferred that an amount of up to 50mg of iron from the bioavailable iron compound is used in the edible compositions, more preferably 0.5 to 30 mg, most preferably 1 to 20 mg, such as 2 to 15mg per serving of the edible composition. These amounts are based on the weight of the iron in the bioavailable iron compound and not on the total weight of the bioavailable iron compound. Thus the weight of the bioavailable iron compound will be correspondingly greater depending upon the compound used.<br>
Sine Compounds<br>
rhe present invention uses a bioavailable zinc compound, that is, a zinc compound that is at least partially bioavailable to the body.<br>
3ioavailable zinc compounds which can be used include edible inorganic zinc compounds such as zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, zinc chloride and mixtures thereof.<br>
Sdible bioavailable zinc organic compounds may also be used according to the present invention. Preferred examples include sine carboxylate salts such as zinc acetate, zinc gluconate, 2inc ascorbate, zinc citrate, zinc aspartate, zinc picolinate and mixtures thereof.<br>
toino acid chelated zinc compounds of the typed referred to above for iron compounds may also be used.<br>
mixtures of one or more of any of the above bioavailable zinc compounds may also be used. Preferably the bioavailable zinc compound is selected from inorganic zinc salts, zinc carboxylate salts, chelated zinc compounds and mixtures<br><br>
thereof. The compounds, where appropriate, may be in a hydrated form.<br>
The bioavailable zinc compounds, may if desired, be in an encapsulated form.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, it is particularly preferred that iron compound comprises NaFeEDTA<br>
and the zinc compound comprises zinc sulphate.7H2O,<br>
The amount of bioavailable zinc compound used in the edible composition may be any amount which aids the cognitive development or performance of humans having an age of up to 18 years provided that the requirement for the weight ratio of iron to zinc according to the present invention is met. It is preferred that an amount of up to 50 mg of zinc from the bioavailable zinc compound is used in the edible compositions, more preferably 0.5 to 20 mg, most preferably 0.7 to 15 mg, such as 1 to 10 mg per serving of the food product. These  amounts are based on the weight of the zinc in the bioavailable zinc compound and not on the total weight of the bioavailable zinc compound.  Thus the weight of the bioavailable zinc compound will be correspondingly greater depending upon the compound used.<br>
It is especially preferred that the weight ratio of the bioavailable iron compound to the bioavailable zinc compound is in the range of from 2:1 to 5:1, most preferably 2:1 to 4:1.<br>
 B vitamins The present invention uses at least one B vitamin, preferably, selected from vitamins B6, Bll and B12. It is especially<br><br>
preferred that the edible compositions comprises any two of vitamins B6, Bll and B12, even more preferably each of B6, Bll and B12.<br>
The at least one B vitamin is preferably used in amounts of up to 5 mg in a serving of the edible composition, preferably 0.05 to 3 mg, more preferably 0.1 to 2mg.<br>
It is preferred that Vitamins B6 and Bll are individually used in amounts of from 0.05 to 5 mg, more preferably from 0.075 to 3 mg, most preferably from 0.1 to 2 mg per serving of the edible composition.<br>
It is preferred that Vitamin B12 is used in amounts of from 0.0001 to 1 mg, preferably from 0.001 to 0.5 mg, most preferably from 0.0015 to 0.2 mg per serving of the edible composition.<br>
For all the B vitamins above, the amount of the ingredient referred to is to the amount of the active ingredient.<br>
Polyunsaturated fatty acid<br>
The present invention preferably further uses a polyunsaturated<br>
fatty acid in the preparation of the edible composition.<br>
Preferably, any oil comprising omega 3 fatty acids, especially<br>
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C20:5) and/or eicosapentaenoic acid<br>
(EPA, C22:5) may be used. Preferred omega 3 fatty acids are the<br>
following C18:3, C18:4, C20:4, C20:5, C22:5 and C22:6.<br>
Preferably the polyunsaturated fatty acid may be incorporated by the inclusion in the edible composition of fish oil and/or an oil derived from algae.<br><br>
The polyunsaturated fatty acid preferably comprises DHA and EPA in a weight ratio of at least 2:1, more preferably at least 3:1, such as at least 4:1.<br>
  The polyunsaturated fatty acid is preferably used in amounts of up to 2g per serving of the edible composition, more preferably 50 mg to 1 g per serving, more preferably 100 to 500 mg per serving.<br>
  It is especially preferred according to the present invention that the polyunsaturated fatty acid is used with either a bioavailable iron compound or a bioavailable zinc compound in the edible composition.  Most preferred is that a polyunsaturated fatty acid, especially a mixture of DHA and EPA is used with both a bioavailable iron compound and a bioavailable zinc compound in the edible composition.<br>
Vitamins A and C<br>
It known that concurrent supplementation with vitamin C can<br>
improve iron absorption by the body. Vitamin A may enhance iron<br>
mobilisation and vitamin A and beta carotene increase the<br>
absorption of non-heme iron (Mejia &amp; Chew, 1988, Hematological<br>
effects of supplementing anaemic children with vitamin A alone<br>
and in combination with iron. American Journal of Clinical<br>
Nutrition, 48,   1271-1276).<br>
Vitamin A and/or vitamin are C preferably included in the edible composition.<br>
Vitamin A is preferably used in amounts of from 0.5 to 50 mg, preferably 1 to 20 mg, such as 2 to 10 mg based on the retinol acetate equivalent amount. Vitamin C is preferably used in<br><br>
amounts of from 1 to 100 mg, preferably 5 to 75 mg, such as 10 to 65 mg.<br>
It is especially preferred according to the present invention that the edible composition comprises in addition to the B vitamins recited herein a polyunsaturated fatty acid, a bioavailable iron compound, a bioavailable zinc compound and vitamins A and/or C, especially both vitamins A and C.<br>
