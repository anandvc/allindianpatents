COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
MODIFIED-IMMOBILIZED   ENZYMES   OF   HIGH   TOLERANCE   TO HYDROPHILIC SUBSTRATES IN ORGANIC MEDIA<br>
2. APPLICANT:<br>
Name: TRANSBIODIESEL LTD.<br>
Nationality: Israel<br>
Address: L.N. Innovative Technologies, 99 Hahistadrut Avenue, 32960 Haifa,<br>
Israel.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
1<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to immobilized interfacial enzymes, particularly lipases and phospholipases, as well as other hydrolases, having improved activity and stability towards alcohols, in particular short-chain alcohols, as well as other hydrophilic substances. The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of such enzymes, and their various industrial and investigational uses, particularly for the production of fatty acid short-chain alkyl esters, such as methyl esters, typically used as biodiesel,<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Interfacial enzymes are a class of enzymes that comprise two domains in their proteinous structure; the first is a hydrophilic domain, while the second is a hydrophobic domain. This unique feature imparts this class of enzymes to favor the interfacial area once present in a two-phase system. Under these conditions, the active conformation is formed where the hydrophilic domain of the enzyme molecules faces the aqueous layer while the hydrophobic domain faces the hydrophobic layer.<br>
Lipases and phospholipases are the most familiar interfacial enzymes that express their catalytic activity once present in an interfacial system. Lipases (triacylglycerol hydrolase E.C. 3.1.1.3} are defined as hydrolytic enzymes that act on the ester linkage in triacylglycerol in aqueous systems to yield free fatty acids, partial glycerides and glycerol, Phospholipases also belong to the class of hydrolytic enzymes, however they cleave favorably and specifically the ester linkage of phospholipids present in aqueous systems, to yield free<br>
2<br><br>
fatty acids, lysophospholipids, glycerophospholipids, phosphatide acid and free alcohol, depending on the type of phospholipase.<br>
Lipases and phospholipases are widely distributed among animals, plants and microorganisms. The interest in the industrial application of lipases and phospholipases has been rapidly growing during the last two decades. It has been found that under low water activity this class of enzymes catalyzes their reverse hydrolysis reaction. The reverse catalytic activity of lipases and phospholipases has been widely exploited for the synthesis of valuable compounds that contain ester and amide linkages or other related chemicals containing functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxylic and amino groups. In particular, lipases and phospholipases have been utilized for reforming fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids and sphingolipids to obtain new desired functional properties, and for separating optically active compounds from their racemic mixtures. Of particular interest is the use of interfacial enzymes for the synthesis of short-chain alkyl esters (biodiesel), disclosed herein.<br>
Currently, there are more than 40 different lipases and phospholipases commercially available, however only a few of them are prepared in commercial quantities. Some of the most industrially promising interfacial enzymes are derived from Candida antarctica, Candida rugosa, Rhizomucor miehei, Pseudomonas sp., Rhizopus niveus, Mucor javanicus, Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium camembertii, Alcaligenes sp.t Burkholderia sp.t Thermomyces lanuginosa, Ckromobacterium viscosum, papaya seeds, and pancreatin,<br>
3<br><br>
Immobilization of enzymes has been described by a vast number of techniques basically aiming at reducing the cost contribution of enzymes in the overall process, facilitating the recovery of enzymes from the products and enabling continuous operation of the process, Immobilization techniques are in general divided according to the following:<br>
1.	Physical adsorption of enzymes to solid supports, such as silica and insoluble polymers.<br>
2.	Adsorption on ion-exchange resins,<br>
3.	Covalent h in ding of enzymes to a solid support material, such as epoxidated inorganic or polymer supports.<br>
4.	Entrapment of enzymes in a growing polymer.<br>
5.	Confinement of enzymes in a membrane reactor or in semi-permeable<br>
gels-<br>
6.	Cross-linking enzyme crystals (CLECS's) or aggregates (CLEAS's).<br>
All the aforementioned enzyme immobilization procedures are comprised nf the following steps:<br>
1.	Dissolving the enzyme in an appropriate buffer system with respect to pH, temperature, type of buffer salts and ionic strength,   v<br>
2.	Adding the solid support into the enzyme solution and mixing for some time until enzyme molecules are immobilized on the solid support.<br>
3.	Filtering off the solid support which contains the immobilized enzyme.<br>
4.	Washing the support with an appropriate buffer to remove loosely bound enzyme molecules and then drying-the solid support.<br>
Interfacial enzymes, mostly lipases, have been immobilized following the aforementioned techniques. These offered immobilized enzyme preparations possessing low synthetic activity and/or short operational half-life time. In an<br>
4<br><br>
attempt to increase the synthetic activity of immobilized lipases and other interfacial enzymes different activation methods have been applied. These methods include:<br>
1.	Binding the surface functional groups of enzymes with hydrophobic<br>
residues such as fatty acids or polyethylene glycol.<br>
2,	Coating the surface of enzymes with surfactants, such as polyol fatty<br>
acid esters.<br>
3.	Contacting enzymes with hydrophobic supports, typically<br>
polypropylene, which have been pre treated with hydrophilic solvents,<br>
such as ethanol or iso-propanol.<br>
4,	Adding enzyme activators, such as salt solution, glycerol, etc, at low<br>
concentration, typically below 1%, into the reaction system.<br>
None of the above mentioned methods yielded satisfactory results with respect to activation, stabilization and cost-effectiveness of immobilized interfacial enzymes in order to carry out enzymatic reverse conversions at industrial quantities, Also, it has been reported that most enzymes, when immobilized according to the aforementioned procedure, either lose a significant portion of their synthetic activity or do not exhibit their full activity performance due to certain constraints imposed by the immobilization procedure. For example, coating lipases and phospholipases with polyol fatty acid esters encountered a serious challenge where lipase molecules were not fully coated with the activator; therefore those enzyme molecules not brought into contact with the activator, remained inactive.<br>
Another major drawback of lipases and phospholipases is their low tolerance towards hydrophilic substrates, particularly short-chain alcohols and short-chain fatty acids (below C4). It has been observed in many research studies<br>
5<br><br>
that short-chain alcohols and short-chain fatty acids, such as methanol and acetic acid, are responsible for detaching essential water molecules from the quaternary structure of those enzymes, leading to their denaturation and consequently loss of their catalytic activity. This drawback has prohibited the application of lipases for production' of commercial quantities of fatty acid methyl esters 'Tuodiesel" using oil triglycerides and methanol as substrates.<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a new method for obtaining highly active and stable immobilized interfacial enzymes, in particular lipases and phospholipases far synthetic applications. Of particular interest is the use of these enzymes for the synthesis of fatty acid short-chain alkyl esters for use as "biodiesel".<br>
immobilized interfacial enzymes, possessing high tolerance towards short-chain alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol and glycerol, and short-chain fatty acids, such as acetic acid,<br>
These and other objects of the invention will become apparent as the description proceeds,<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In search for a new highly active and stable immobilized interfacial enzymes,<br>
in particular lipases and phospholipases, of high tolerance towards<br>
hydrophilic substrates, such as short-chain alcohols and short-chain fatty<br>
acids, the present inventor found that a hydrophobic microenvironment of<br>
transesterification reaction medium in the vicinity of the active-site of the<br>
enzyme, may serve as means for enhancing the activity of lipases and for<br>
increasing their resistance to hydrophilic short-chain alcohols and acids, as<br>
well as other hydrophilic agents which may be present in the reaction<br>
mixture.		<br>
The inventor thus developed different enzyme preparations, in which the enzyme is immobilized on an insoluble matrix, and is rendered hydrophobic. The enzyme may be rendered hydrophobic either directly, as shown below, for example by attachment of lipophilic residues, e.g. by epoxidation with lipid epoxides, or by being immobilized onto a hydrophobic matrix, which supplies the hydrophobic microenvironment by which the enzyme is surrounded, or in which the enzyme is embedded. It is demonstrated in this work that a hydrophobic micro-environment in the vicinity of the enzyme's active-site acts<br>
15<br><br>
as a buffer region which is capable of protecting the enzyme from exposure to inhibiting concentrations of substrates and products having hydrophilic moieties. The hydrophobic micro-environment provided for the enzyme is responsible for controlling the access of non-inhibiting concentration ranges of short-chain alcohols to the enzyme's active-site, and also responsible for the removal of the hydrophilic reaction products formed in the vicinity of the active-site of the enzyme into the reaction medium.<br>
Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, the hydrophobic immobilized enzyme may be prepared by a two-step technique, substantially as follows:<br>
Step 1: Forcing all interfacial enzyme molecules to adopt their active confirmation by reacting them with a lipid epoxide in a biphase system comprised of aqueous phase and an organic phase containing the lipid epoxide (see Fig. 1). The lipid epoxide is present in large excess, and thus each enzyme molecule is covalently coated with a large number of lipid molecules.<br>
Step 2: Adding a suitable support into the bi-phase system which already<br>
contains the coyalently coated enzyme.	<br>
Under these conditions, the enzyme molecules covalently coated with lipid residues or complexes that are positioned at the bi-phase interface, can be readily immobilized onto the support by simple physical adsorption, covalent binding with activated resins containing functional groups such as epoxy or aldehyde groups, or by adsorption on ion-exchange resins.<br>
This two-step technique is employed in the preparation of active modified-immobilized interfacial enzyme in accordance with the invention.<br>
16<br><br>
In accordance with this aspect, the invention relates to a process for preparing stable, highly active modified-immobilized interfacial enzymes, particularly lipases, esterases and phospholipases, in which a bi-phase system comprised of an aqueous buffer solution and at least one organic solvent containing a lipid epoxide is provided; the interfacial enzyme is mixed with a large excess of the biphase system; a solid support is added to the mixture; and the covalently lipid-coated interfacial enzyme immobilized on the support is isolated.<br>
The solid support is preferably a porous support which may be organic or inorganic, particularly selected from the group consisting of porous inorganic supports such as silica- or alumina-based supports, organic supports such as polymer-based support, wherein said support may optionally contain active functional groups such as epoxy or aldehyde groups, or ionic groups. Some specific supports are given in the Examples below, particularly in Table 1,<br>
The bi-phasic system is prepared from a suitable aqueous buffer and an organic solvent. This organic solvent may be, but is not limited to, an alkane (such as octane^, an ether (such as di-iso-propyl ether), an alcohol (such as n-octanol), an aldehyde (such as decanaldehyde), a ketone (such as 2-octanone) and any mixture thereof.<br>
The immobilized enzyme of the invention, or prepared by the above epoxidation method of the invention, is very active, and particularly stable and of high tolerance to hydrophilic substrates, such as short-chain alcohols and short-chain fatty acids. Activity of about 90% is retained after even 10 cycles of reaction. This stability is of major economic importance.<br>
17<br><br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to an alternative method for lipase hydrophobization, avoiding the need for epoxidation and coating the enzyme with lipid moieties. Physically attached immobilized enzymes with hydrophobic micro-environment were produced by contacting hydrophobic porous polymeric matrices with a water solution or with a water-organic solvent bi-layer [also termed bi-phase] system containing different lipases. The immobilized enzymes so produced were tested in a transcsterification reaction between oil triglycerides and methanol, for the production of bio dies el and glycerol, which transcsterification reaction was used as a reaction model in this work. Without being bound by theory, it is suggested that the hydrophobic nature of the micro -environment is responsible for lowering the concentrations of the hydrophilic substances in the vicinity of the enzyme molecules. These hydrophilic substances may be either substrate/s used in the reaction, or the products formed by the reaction. Such a "hydrophobicized" biocatalyst ensures controlled concentrations of the hydrophilic short-chain alcohols and acids reactants which reach the enzyme vicinity, and/or fast removal of any hydrophilic substances formed in the vicinity of the enzyme molecules. As a major result the enzyme molecules are protected fron\the hydrophihe substrates and products by controlling the concentrations of reactants which reach the vicinity of the immobilized enzyme, as well as the fast removal of hydrophilic products once formed by the reaction. This suggestion was tested with four different lipases, each separately immobilized on four supports which differ with respect to their hydrophobicity, as shown in Example 5.<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of fatty acids short-chain alkyl esters, in particularly fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel). Generally, in this process, methanol is first added<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of immobilized lipase (Lipozyme TL)<br>
Lipase derived from Thermomyces lanuginosa (1ml of Lipozyme TL 100L,<br>
Novozymes, Denmark) was mixed in a bisolvent system comprised of 1ml<br>
phosphate buffer of 0.05 M and pH 6.5, and 10ml of ?r-hexane containing a<br>
lipid epoxide. The mixture was stirred for 48 hours, A support (|g) was added<br>
into the system and the mixture was stirred for 8 hours. The support<br>
containing the modified-immobilized enzyme was filtered off and dried in a<br>
desiccator  overnight  to  yield  the  highly   active  covalently  lipid-coated-<br>
immobilized lipase.<br>
Table 1 shows the relative trans ester ification activity of Lipozyme TL 100L immobilized on different supports. Reactions were carried out by adding immobilized lipase (0.2g) to soybean oil (2.5g) and methyl alcohol (0.3g). The reaction system is mixed magnetically or by shaking at 30°C The reaction<br>
20<br><br>
rate is determined by measuring the fatty acid methyl esters produced after 1 hour under the above mentioned conditions<br>
Table 1: The reaction rate using different fatty acid epoxide-modified Lipozyme for the transesterifcation of soybean oil triglycerides to obtain fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Reaction conditions: olive oil (2.5g) and methanol (0.2g) are mixed with lipase TL 100L modified-immobilized on different supports (0.2g) for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is shaken at 300 rpiu and at 30°C,<br>
21<br><br><br>
22<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of immobilized lipase<br>
The immobilization procedure of Example 1 was repeated using different lipases (lOOmg) and using triglycerides epoxides. Reaction rates for production of fatty acid methyl esters under the above described conditions are described in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: The reaction rate using different fatty acid epoxide-modified lipases for the transesterifcation of soybeans oil triglycerides to obtain fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Reaction conditions: Soybean oil (2,5g) and methanol (0.3g) are mixed with different lipases coated covalently with triglycerides epoxides and immobilized on Amberlite XAD 4 (0,2g) for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is shaken at 300rpm and at 30°C.<br>
23<br><br><br>
24<br><br>
The hydrolytic and synthetic activities of the different enzyme preparations [Buffcr-Epoxide-OA in which the enzyme is covalently coated with oleic acid, and Buffer-Epoxide-Oil, in which the enzyme is covalently coated with an oil (triglyceride, e,g. triolein)] were compared with those of other enzyme preparation (thai are nut covalently coated with a lipid): Buffer (control) in which the enzyme is simply immobilized on the support; Buffer-Oleic acid (Buffer-OA) in which the support immobilized enzyme is coated with the fatty acid; Buffer-SMO, in which the support-immobilized enzyme is coated with sorbitan monostearate,<br>
The re suits are shown in Figures 2 to 4 . As can he seen, both the hydrolytic and synthetic activities of the enzymes of the invention, which are covalently coated with a lipid component, were considerably and significantly higher than those of the other enzyme preparations.<br>
In addition, most of the activity of the enzyme is retained even after 10 and more cycles of reacLion (data not shown).<br>
The epoxide-modified enzyme preparations of the invention thus exhibit high activity and increased stability.<br>
25<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Immobilization of Upases in buffer or bi-phase systems<br>
Lipase (3000 units of Thertnomyces lanuginose lipase, Candida antarctica<br>
lipase   Bh  both from   Novozymes,  Denmark,   PReudomonas  cepacia  lipase,<br>
Amano Enzyme Inc., Japan, or Alcaligenes sp, lipase, Meito Sangyo, Japan)<br>
was mixed in a buffer solution {lOmL pH-7) containing a polymeric support<br>
(lg) at room temperature for 8 hours. The immobilized enzyme was filtered<br>
off and dried over silica in a desiticator, The same procedure can be carried<br>
out in a bi-phase system comprised of similar volumes of a buffer solution and<br>
an organic solvent, for example iso-octane.<br>
The following supports all manufactured by Rohm &amp; Haas, USA, were used: Amberlite XAD 1600, defined as hydrophobic adsorbent; Amber! ite XAD761, defined as hydro phi lie adsorbent; Amberlite XAD7HP defined as polar and non-polar adsorbent; and Amberlite IRA-95S defined as a polar anion exchange resin,<br>
Example 5<br>
Use of the immobilized lipases of Example 4 in the production of<br>
biodiesel<br>
The activity of the immobilized lipases prepared in Example 4 was evaluated<br>
using  the   tmnsesterification   of oil   triglycerides   and   methanol  for  the<br>
production of biodiesel and glycerol as a by-product. Reactions were initiated<br>
by the addition of 10% w/w immobilized lipase into magnetically stirred<br>
soybean oil (2.5g) containing methanol (0,3g added in three portions one hour<br>
apart over 1 hours).<br>
26<br><br>
The conversion (%) of the oil into fatty acid methyl esters for the different lipases immobilized on various matrices, using the same batch of hiocatalyst while exchanging the reaction medium after 4 hours, is shown in Figures 5-8. Lipases immobilized on a hydrophobic support (adsorbent) such as Amberlite11 XAD 1600 maintained their transesterification activity in repeated use for a much higher number of batches compared to other similar enzymes, however immobilized on other types of supports. Also, it can be clearly seen that for this type of reaction, all lipases immobilized on hydrophilic supports exhibited poor transesterification activity as well as poor repeated use in consecutive batches. It has been noticed that lipases immobilized on hydrophilic supports like Amberlite* XAD761 and AmberlileR IRA-95B formed aggregates of hincatalysts saturated with the formed hydrophilic product of the reaction, namely glycerol. Due to the accumulation of the formed product and also because of the high concentration of methanol in the vicinity of the immobilized enzyme, the biocatalysts exhibited poor activity as well as low number of repeated uses.<br>
In contrast, lipases, especially Thermomyces lanuginnse and Pseudomonan cepacia lipases, immobilized on hydrophobic supports lik^e AmberliteR XAD 1600 and AtnberliteR XAD7HP yielded higher transesterification activity and alao maintained their transesterification activity in more than 50 repeated cycles using the same batch of biocatalyst.<br>
