				<td>The  present  invention  relates  to  a  herbicidal  composition comprising 4-aminopicolinate of formula I.<br>
This invention relates to certain novel 4~ aminopicolinates and their derivatives and to the use of these compounds as herbicides.<br>
A number of picolinic acids and their pesticidal properties have been described in the art. For example, U.S. Patent 3,285,925 discloses 4-amino-3, 5, 6-trichloropicolinic acid derivatives and their use as plant growth control agents and herbicides. U.S. Patent 3,325,272 discloses 4-amino-3,5-dichloro-picolinic acid derivatives and their use for the control of plant growth,  U.S. Patent 3,317,549 discloses 3, 6-dichloropicolinic acid derivatives and their use as plant growth control agents. U.S. Patent 3,334,108 discloses chlorinated dithiopicolinic acid derivatives and their use as parasiticides. U.S. Patent 3,234,229 discloses 4-amino-polychloro-2-trichloromethylpyridines and their use as herbicides, In Applied and Environmental Microbiology,  Vol. 5.9../... No. 1,   July 1993, pp. 2251-2256, 4-amino-3,6-dichloropicolinic acid is identified as a product of the anaerobic degradation of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloroÂ¬picolinic acid, the commercially available herbicide picloram,<br>
While picloram is recommended for the control of woody plants and broadleaf weeds in certain applications, its properties are not- ideal. It would be highly desirable to discover related compounds that<br>
are more potent, more selective or of broader spectrum in their herbicidal activity and/or that have improved toxicological or environmental properties.<br>
It has now been found that certain 4-amino-picolinic acids and their derivatives having selected substituents in the 3-, 5-, and 6-positions are potent herbicides with a broad spectrum of weed control and excellent crop selectivity.  The compounds further possess excellent toxicological or environmental profiles.<br>

The invention also includes a method of use of. the compounds and compositions of the present invention to kill or control undesirable vegetation by application of an herbicidal amount of the compound to the vegetation or to the locus of the vegetation as well as to the soil prior to emergence of the vegetation.  The use of the compounds to kill or control woody plants and broadleaf weeds in grass crops is a preferred utility and post-emergent application of the compounds to the undesirable vegetation is a preferred method of application.<br>
The herbicidal compounds of the present invention are derivatives of 4-aminopicolinic acids:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These compounds are characterized by possessing halogen, C1-C6alkoxy, C1-C6 alkylthio, aryloxy or nitro substituents in the 3-position with halogen being preferred and chlorine being most preferred; by possessing hydrogen, halogen, C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 alkylthio, aryloxy, nitro or trifluoromethyl substituents in the 5-position with hydrogen and fluorine being preferred; and by possessing halogen,<br>
C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 alkylthio, aryloxy, heteroary.loxy or trifluoromethyl substituents in the 6-position with fluorine, chlorine, bromine or aryloxy being preferred.  Preferred aryloxy groups in the 6-position are 3-substituted phenoxy groups, most preferably phenoxy groups substituted with halogen or C1-C4 alkyl groups in the 3-position.<br>
The amino group at the 4-position can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C6 alkenyl, C3-C6 alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, hydroxy, C1-C6 alkoxy or amino substituents.  The amino-group can be further derivatized as an amide, a carbamate, a urea, a sulfonamide, a silylamine, a phosphoramidate, an imine or a hydrazone.  Such derivatives are capable of breaking down into the amine. An unsubstituted amino group or one substituted with one or more alkyl substituents is preferred.<br>
The carboxylic acids of Formula I are believed to be the compounds that actually kill or control undesirable vegetation and are typically preferred.  Analogs of these compounds in which the acid or amine group of the picolinic acid is derivatized to form a related substituent that can be transformed within plants or the environment to a acid group possess essentially the same herbicidal effect and are within the scope of the invention.  Therefore, an "agriculturally acceptable derivative", when used to describe the carboxylic acid functionality at the 2-position, is defined as any salt, ester, acylhydrazide, imidate, thioimidate, amidine, amide, orthoester, acylcyanide, acyl halide, thioester,<br>
thionoester, dithiolester, nitrile or any other .acid derivative well known in the art which (a) does not substantially affect the herbicidal activity of the active ingredient, i.e., the 4-aminopicolinic acid, and (b) is or can be hydrolyzed in plants or soil to the picolinic acid of Formula I that, depending upon the pH, is in the dissociated or the undissociated form.  Likewise, an "agriculturally acceptable derivative", when used to describe the amine functionality at the 4-position, is defined as any salt, silylamine, phosphorylamine, phosphinimine, phosphoramidate, sulfonamide, sulfinimine, sulfoximine, aminal, hemiaminal, amide, thioamide, carbamate, thiocarbamate, amidine, urea, imine, nitro, nitroso, azide, or any other nitrogen containing derivative well known in the art which (a) does not substantially affect the herbicidal activity of the active ingredient, i.e., the 4-aminopicolinic acid, and (b) is or can be hydrolyzed in plants or soil to a free amine of Formula I.  N-Oxides which are also capable of breaking into the parent pyridine of Formula I are also covered by the scope of this invention.<br>
Suitable salts include those derived from alkali or alkaline earth metals and those derived from ammonia and amines.  Preferred cations include sodium, potassium, magnesium, and aminium cations of the formula:<br>
R5R6R7NH+<br>
wherein R5,   R6,   and R6  each,   independently represents hydrogen or C1-C12  alkyl,   C3-C12 alkenyl or C3-C12<br>
alkynyl, each of which is optionally substituted by one or more hydroxy, C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 alkylthio or phenyl groups, provided that R5, R6/ and R7 are., sterically compatible.  Additionally, any two of R5/ R6, and R7 together may represent an aliphatic difunctional moiety containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms and up to two oxygen or sulfur atoms.  Salts of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared by treatment of compounds of Formula I with a metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, or an amine, such as ammonia, trimethylamine, diethanolamine, 2-methyl-thiopropylamine, bisallylamine, 2-butoxyethylamine, morpholine, cyclododecylamine, or benzylamine.  Amine salts are often preferred forms of the compounds of Formula I because they are water-soluble and lend themselves to the preparation of desirable aqueous based herbicidal compositions.<br>
Suitable esters include those derived from C1-C12 alkyl, C3-C12 alkenyl or C3-C12 alkynyl alcohols, such as methanol, iso-propanol, butanol, 2-ethylhexanol, butoxyethanol, methoxypropanol, allyl alcohol, propargyl alcohol or cyclohexanol.  Esters can be prepared by coupling of the picolinic acid with the alcohol using any number of suitable activating agents such as those used for pep tide couplings such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), by reacting the corresponding acid chloride of a picolinic acid of Formula I with an appropriate alcohol or by reacting the corresponding picolinic acid of Formula I with an appropriate alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst. Suitable amides include those derived from ammonia or from<br>
C1-C12 alkyl, C6-C12 alkenyl or C3-C12 alkynyl mono- or di-substituted amines, such as but not limited to dime thy lamine, diethanolamine, 2-methylthiopropyl-amine, bisallylamine, 2-butoxyethylamine, cyclo-dodecylamine, benzylamine or cyclic or aromatic amines with or without additional heteroatoms such as but . not limited to aziridine, azetidine, pyrrolidine, pyrrole, imidazole, tetrazole or morpholine. Amides can be prepared by reacting the corresponding picolinic acid chloride, mixed anhydride, or carboxylic ester of Formula I with ammonia or an appropriate amine.<br>
The terms "alkyl", "alkenyl" and "alkynyl", as well as derivative terms such as "alkoxy", "acyl", "alkylthio" and "alkylsulfonyl", as used herein, include within their scope straight chain, branched chain and cyclic moieties.  Unless specifically stated otherwise, each may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents selected from but not limited to halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, alkylthio, C1-C6 acyl, formyl, cyano, aryloxy or aryl, provided that the substituents are sterically compatible and the rules of chemical bonding and strain energy are satisfied.  The terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" are intended to include one or more unsaturated bonds.<br>
The term "aryl", as well as derivative terms such as "aryloxy", refers to a phenyl or naphthyl group.  The term "heteroaryl", as well as derivative terms such as "heteroaryloxy", refers to a 5- or 6-membered aromatic ring containing one or more heteroatoms, viz., N, 0 or S; these heteroaromatic<br>
rings may be fused to other aromatic systems.  The aryl or heteroaryl substituents may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents selected from halogen, hydroxy, nitro, cyano, aryloxy, formyl, C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl, C1-C6 alkoxy/ halogenated C1-C6 alkyl, halogenated C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 acyl, C1-C6 alkylthio, C1-C6alkylsulfinyl, Ca-C6 alkylsulfonyl, aryl, C1-C6 OC (0) alkyl, C1-C6 NHC{0)alkyl, C(0}OH, CC1-C6 C(0)0alkyl, C(0)NH2, C1-C6 C{0)NHalkyl, or C1-C6 C(0)N(alkyl)2/ provided that the substituents are sterically compatible and the rules of chemical bonding and strain energy are satisfied.<br>
Unless specifically limited otherwise, the term halogen includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be made using well-known chemical procedures.  The required starting materials are commercially available or readily synthesized utilizing standard procedures.<br>
In general, reduction of picolinate N-oxides can be used to prepare the corresponding picolinates. Electrolytic dehalogenation of 5-halogenated picolinates can be used to prepare the 5-H (unsubstituted) picolinates, and hydrolysis of pyridines substituted at the 2 position by nitriles, amides, esters and other hydrolyzable functionalities can be used to prepare the desired picolinates.<br>
4-N-amide, carbamate, urea, sulfonamide, silylamine and phosphoramidate amino derivatives can be prepared by the reaction of the free amino compound<br>
with, for example, a suitable acid halide, chloroformate, carbamyl chloride, sulfonyl chloride, silyl chloride or chlorophosphate.  The imine or hydrazone can be prepared by reaction of the free amine or hydrazine with a suitable aldehyde or ketone<br>
6-Bromo analogs can be prepared by the reduction of several key intermediates, e.g., the corresponding 6-bromo-4-azido, 6-bromo-4-nitro, and 6-bromo-4-nitro pyridine N-oxide analogs.  These intermediates, in turn, can be prepared either by nucleophilic displacement of 6-bromo-4-halo analogs with NaN3 or by electrophilic nitration of the corresponding 6-bromopyridine-N-oxides. Alternatively, such analogs can be prepared by direct amination of the corresponding 4,6-dibromo analogs.<br>
6-Fluoro analogs can be prepared by direct amination of the corresponding 4,6-difluoro analog.<br>
3- and 5-Alkoxy and aryloxy analogs can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding 4-azido derivatives, which in turn can be prepared by nucleophilic displacement of the corresponding 4-bromopyridines with NaN3. The required 3- and 5-alkoxy-4-bromopyridines can be prepared according to literature procedures.<br>
6-Alkoxy, alkylthio, aryloxy and<br>
heteroaryloxy analogs can be prepared by nucleophilic displacement with alkoxide, thioalkoxide, aryloxide or heteroaryloxide on the appropriate 6-halopyridine.<br>
3- and 5-Alkylthio analogs can be prepared by lithiation of the appropriate chloropyridines at low temperature and sequential treatment with alkyl disulfides and carbon dioxide.  Reaction of the resulting picolinic acids with ammonium hydroxide gave the desired products.<br>
6-Cyano analogs can be prepared by amination of the appropriate 4-halo-6-cyanopicolinate.  4-Haloâ 6-cyanopicolinates can be prepared by action of trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) on the appropriate pyridine IV-oxide, which can be prepared by hydrogen peroxide mediated oxidation of the corresponding pyridine.<br>
3- and 5-Cyano analogs can be prepared by action of KCN on the appropriate fluoropyridine at high temperature.  3- and 5-Fluoro, bromo, iodo and nitro analogs can be prepared by electrophilic reaction of the unsubstituted precursor with positive halogen or nitro sources such as fluorine gas, bromine, iodine and fuming nitric acid respectively.<br>
6-Trifluoromethyl analogs can be prepared by amination of readily available methyl trifluoromethyl-picolinate (oxidative halogenation of the 4-position followed by displacement with ammonia or an amine equivalent) followed by chlorination of the 3- and 5-positions.<br>
3- and 5-Trifluoromethyl analogs can be orepared by standard manipulations known to those skilled in the art starting from the known compounds<br>
2-fluoro-3-chloro-5-trifluorometylpyridine and 2,5-dichloro-3-trifluoromethylpyridine.<br>
Substituted 4-amino analogs can be prepared by reacting the corresponding 4-halopyridine-2-carboxylate or any other displaceable 4-substituent with the substituted amine.<br>
The compounds of Formula I, obtained by any of these processes, can be recovered by conventional means.  Typically, the reaction mixture is acidified with an aqueous acid, such as hydrochloric acid, and extracted with an organic solvent, such as ethyl acetate or dichloromethane.  The organic solvent and other volatiles can be removed by distillation or evaporation to obtain the desired compound of Formula I, which can be purified by standard procedures, such as by recrystallization or chromatography.<br>
The compounds of Formula I have been found to be useful pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides.  They can be employed at non-selective (higher) rates of application to control a broad spectrum of the vegetation in an area or at lower rates of application for the selective control of undesirable vegetation. Areas of application include pasture and rangelands, roadsides and rights of ways, and crops such as corn, rice and cereals. It is usually preferred to employ the compounds post-emergence.  It is further usually preferred to use the compounds to control a wide spectrum of broadleaf weeds, including Dock species (Rumex spp), Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) , pigweed species (Amaranthus spp.), Senna species (Cassia spp.), spurge species<br>
(Euphorbia spp), ragweed species (Ambrosia spp.), Sida species (Sida spp.), field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), and knapweed species(Centaurea spp.), among others.  Use of the compounds to control undesirable vegetation in grassy areas is especially indicated. While each of the 4-aminopicolinate compounds encompassed by Formula I is within the scope of the invention, the degree of herbicidal activity, the crop selectivity, and the spectrum of weed control obtained varies depending upon the substituents present.  An appropriate compound for any specific herbicidal utility can be identified by using the information presented herein and routine testing.<br>
The term herbicide is used herein to mean an active ingredient that kills, controls or otherwise adversely modifies the growth of plants.  An herbicidally effective or vegetation controlling amount is an amount of active ingredient which causes an adversely modifying effect and includes deviations from natural development, killing, regulation, desiccation, retardation, and the like.  The terms plants and vegetation include germinant seeds, emerging seedlings and established vegetation.<br>
Herbicidal activity is exhibited by the compounds of the present invention when they are applied directly to the plant or to the locus of the plant at any stage of growth or before planting or emergence.  The effect observed depends upon the plant species to be controlled, the stage of growth of the plant, the application parameters of dilution and spray drop size, the particle size of solid<br>
components, the environmental conditions at the. time of use, the specific compound employed, the specific adjuvants and carriers employed, the soil type, and the like, as well as the amount of chemical applied. These and other factors can be adjusted as is known in the art to promote non-selective or selective herbicidal action.  Generally, it is preferred to apply the compounds of Formula I postemergence to relatively immature undesirable vegetation to achieve the maximum control of weeds.<br>
Application rates of 1 to 50.0 g/Ha are generally employed in postemergence operations; for preemergence applications, rates of 10 to 1000 g/Ha are generally employed.  The higher rates designated generally give non-selective control of a broad variety of undesirable vegetation.  The lower rates typically give selective control and can be employed in the locus of crops.<br>
The herbicidal compounds of the present invention are often best applied in conjunction with one or more other herbicides to obtain control of a wider variety of undesirable vegetation.  When used in conjunction with other herbicides, the presently claimed compounds can be formulated with the other herbicide or herbicides, tank mixed with the other herbicide or herbicides, or applied sequentially with the other herbicide or herbicides.  Some of the herbicides that can be employed in conjunction with the compounds of the present invention include sulfonamides such as metosulam, flumetsulam, cloransulam-methyl, diclosulam and florasulam, .<br>
sulfonylureas such as chlorimuron, nicosulfuron- and raetsulfuron, imidazolinones such as imazaquin, imazapic, imazethapyr and imazamox, phenoxyalkanoic acids such as 2,4-D and MCPA, pyridinyloxyacetic acids such as triclopyr and fluroxypyr, carboxylic acids such as clopyralid and dicamba, dinitroanilines such as trifluralin and pendimethalin, chloroacetanilides such as alachlor, acetochlor and metolachlor and other common herbicides including acifluorfen, bentazon, clomazone, fumiclorac, fluometuron, fomesafen, lactofen, linuron, isoproturon, and metribuzin. Particularly preferred combinations are those with florasulam, 2,4-D and fluroxypyr, which, against some weed species, may actually exhibit synergy.  A synergistic response may also be obtained with compounds of the present invention when mixed with auxin transport inhibitors such as diflufenzopyr and chlorflurenol.  The herbicidal compounds of the present invention can, further, be used in conjunction with glyphosate and glufosinate on glyphosate-tolerant or glufosinate-tolerant crops.  It is generally preferred to use the compounds of the invention in combination with herbicides that are selective for the crop being treated and which complement the spectrum of weeds controlled by these compounds at the application rate employed.  It is further generally preferred to apply the compounds of the invention and other complementary herbicides at the same time, either as a combination formulation or as a tank mix.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can generally be employed in combination with known herbicide safeners, such as cloquintocet, furilazole,<br>
dichlormid, benoxacor, mefenpyr-ethyl, fenclorazole-ethyl, flurazole, and fluxofenirn, to enhance their selectivity.  They can additionally be employed to control undesirable vegetation in many crops that have been made.tolerant to or resistant to them or to other herbicides by genetic manipulation or by mutation and selection.  For example, corn, wheat, rice, soybean, sugarbeet, cotton, canola, and other crops that have been made tolerant or resistant to compounds that are acetolactate synthase inhibitors in sensitive plants can be treated.  Many glyphosate and glufosinate tolerant crops can be treated as well, alone or in combination with these herbicides.  Some crops (e.g. cotton) have been made tolerant to auxinic herbicides such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.  These herbicides may be used to treat such resistant crops or other auxin tolerant crops.<br>
While it is possible to utilize the 4-amino-picolinate compounds of Formula I directly as herbicides, it is preferable to use them in mixtures containing a herbicidally effective amount of the compound along with at least one agriculturally acceptable adjuvant or carrier.  Suitable adjuvants or carriers should not be phytotoxic to valuable crops, particularly at the concentrations employed in applying the compositions for selective weed control in the presence of crops, and should not react chemically with the compounds of Formula I or other composition ingredients.  Such mixtures can be designed for application directly to weeds or their locus or can be concentrates or formulations that are normally diluted with additional carriers and<br>
adjuvants before application.  They can be solids, such as, for example, dusts, granules, water dispersible granules, or wettable powders, or liquids, such as, for example, emulsifiable concentrates, solutions, emulsions or suspensions.<br>
Suitable agricultural adjuvants and carriers that are useful in preparing the herbicidal mixtures of the invention are well known to those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
Liquid carriers that can be employed include water, toluene, xrylene, petroleum-naphtha, crop oil, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, ethyl acetate, amyl acetate, butyl acetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, amyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerine, and the like.  Water is generally the carrier of choice for' the dilution of concentrates.<br>
Suitable solid carriers include talc, pyro-phyllite clay, silica, attapulgus clay, kaolin clay, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earth, lime, calcium carbonate, bentonite clay, Fuller's earth, cotton seed hulls, wheat flour, soybean flour, pumice, wood flour, walnut shell flour, lignin, and the like.<br>
It is usually desirable to incorporate one or more surface-active agents into the compositions of the present invention.  Such surface-active agents are advantageously employed in both solid and liquid compositions, especially those designed to be diluted<br>
with carrier before application.  The surface-active agents can be anionic, cationic or nonionic in character and can be employed as emulsifying agents, wetting agents, suspending agents, or for other purposes.  Typical surface-active agents "include salts of alkyl sulfates, such as diethanolammonium lauryl sulfate; alkylarylsulfonate salts, such as calcium dodecy Ibenz enesul f onat e; alkylphenol-alkylene oxide addition products, such as nonylphenol-C18 ethoxylate; alcoho1-alkylene oxide addition products, such as tridecyl alcohol-C16 ethoxylate; soaps, such as sodium stearate; alkylnaphthalenesulfonate salts, such as sodium dibutylnaphthalenesulfonate; dialkyl esters of sulfosuccinate salts, such as sodium di(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate; sorbitol esters, such as sorbitol oleate; quaternary amines, such as lauryl trimethyl-ammonium chloride; polyethylene glycol esters of fatty acids, such as polyethylene glycol stearate; block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide; and salts of mono and dialkyl phosphate esters.<br>
Other adjuvants commonly used in agricultural compositions include compatibilizing agents, antifoam agents, sequestering agents, neutralizing agents and buffers, corrosion inhibitors, dyes, odorants, spreading agents, penetration aids, sticking agents, dispersing agents, thickening agents, freezing point depressants, antimicrobial agents, and the like. The compositions may also contain other compatible components, for example, other herbicides, plant growth regulants, fungicides, insecticides, and the like and can be formulated with liquid fertilizers or<br>
solid, particulate fertilizer carriers such as ammonium nitrate, urea and the like.<br>
The concentration of the active ingredients in the herbicidal compositions of this invention is generally from 0.001 to 98 percent by weight. Concentrations from 0.01 to 90 percent by weight are often employed.  In compositions designed to be employed as concentrates, the active ingredient is generally present in a concentration from 5 to 98 weight percent, preferably 10 to 90 weight percent. Such compositions are typically diluted with an inert carrier, such as water, before application.  The diluted compositions usually applied to weeds or the locus of weeds generally contain 0.0001 to 1 weight percent active ingredient and preferably contain 0.001 to 0.05 weight percent.<br>
The present compositions can be applied to weeds or their locus by the use of conventional ground or aerial dusters, sprayers, and granule applicators, by addition to irrigation water, and by other conventional means known to those skilled in the art.<br>

32.  Evaluation of Postemergence Herbicidal Activity<br>
Seeds of the desired test plant species were planted in Grace-Sierra MetroMixÂ® 306 planting mixture, which typically has a pH of 6.0 to 6.8 and an organic matter content of about 30 percent, in plastic pots with a surface area of 64 square centimeters. When required to ensure good germination and healthy plants, a fungicide treatment and/or other chemical or physical treatment was applied.  The plants were grown for 7-21 days in a greenhouse with an approximate 15 hr photoperiod which was maintained at about 23-29Â°C during the day and 22-28Â°C during the night. â¢Nutrients and water were added on a regular basis and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead metal halide 1000-Watt lamps as necessary.  The plants were<br>
employed for testing when they reached the first or second true leaf stage.<br>
A weighed amount, determined by the highest rate to be tested"," of each test "compound was placed in a 20 mL glass vial and was dissolved in 4 mL of a 97:3 v/v (volume/volume) mixture of acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain concentrated stock solutions.  If the test compound did not dissolve readily, the mixture was warmed and/or sonicated.  The concentrated stock solutions obtained were diluted with an aqueous mixture containing acetone, water, isopropyl alcohol, DMSO, Atplus 411F crop oil concentrate, and Triton x-155 surfactant in a 48.5:39:10:1.5:1.0:0.02 v/v ratio to obtain spray solutions of known concentration.  The solutions containing the highest concentration to be tested were prepared by diluting 2 mL aliquots of the stock solution with 13 mL of the mixture and lower concentrations were prepared by serial dilution of the stock solution.  Approximately 1.5 mL aliquots of each solution of known concentration were sprayed evenly onto each of the test plant pots using a DeVilbiss atomizer driven by compressed air pressure of 2 to 4 psi (140 to 280 kiloPascals) to obtain thorough coverage of each plant.  Control plants were sprayed in the same manner with the aqueous mixture.  In this test an application rate of 1 ppm results in the application of approximately 1 g/Ha.<br>
The treated plants and control plants were placed in a greenhouse as described above and watered by sub-irrigation to prevent wash-off of the test<br><br>
compounds.  After 2 weeks the condition of the test plants as compared with that of the untreated plants was determined visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100 percent where 0 corresponds to no injury and 100 corresponds to complete kill.<br>
By applying the well-accepted probit<br>
analysis as described by J. Berkson in Journal of the American Statistical Society, 48, 565 (1953) and by D. Finney in "Probit Analysis" Cambridge University Press (1952), the above data can be used to calculate GR50 and GRso values, which are defined as growth reduction factors that correspond to the effective dose of herbicide required to kill or control 50 percent or 80 percent, respectively, of a target plant.<br>

33.      Evaluation of Preemergence Herbicidal Activity<br>
Seeds of the desired test plant species were planted in a soil matrix prepared by mixing a loam soil (43 percent silt, 19 percent clay, and 38 percent sand, with a pH of about 8.1 and an organic matter content of about 1.5 percent) and sand in a 70 to 30 ratio.  The soil matrix was contained in plastic pots with a surface area of 113 square centimeters.  When required to ensure good germination and healthy plants, a fungicide treatment and/or other chemical or physical treatment was applied.<br>
A weighed amount, determined by the highest rate to be tested, of each test compound was placed in a 20 mL glass vial and was dissolved in 4 mL of a 97:3<br>
v/v (volume/volume) mixture of acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide to obtain concentrated stock solutions.  If the test compound did not dissolve readily, the mixture was warmed and/or sonicated.  The stock solutions obtained were diluted with a 99.9:0.1<br>
mixture of water and TweenÂ® 155 surfactant to obtain application solutions of known concentration.  The solutions containing the highest concentration to be tested were prepared by diluting 2 mL aliquots of the stock solution with 15 mL of the mixture and lower concentrations were prepared by serial dilution of the stock solution.  A 2.5 mL aliquot of each solution of known concentration was sprayed evenly onto the soil surface (113 sq. cm) of each seeded pot using a Cornwall 5.0 mL glass syringe fitted with a TeeJet TN-3 hollow cone nozzle to obtain thorough coverage of the soil in each pot.  Control pots were sprayed in the same manner with the aqueous mixture.<br>
The treated pots and control pots were placed in a greenhouse maintained with an approximate 15 hr photoperiod and temperatures of about 23-29Â°C during the day and 22-28Â°C during the night. Nutrients and water we're added on a regular basis and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead metal halide 1000-Watt lamps as necessary.  The water was added by top-irrigation.  After 3 weeks the condition of the test plants that germinated and grew as compared with that of the untreated plants that germinated and grew was determined visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100 percent where 0 corresponds to no injury and 100 corresponds to complete kill or no<br>
