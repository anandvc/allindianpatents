				<td>AMINOALKOXYINDOLES  AS   5-HT6-RECEPTOR LIGANDS   FOR  THE  TREATMENT   OF   CNS-DISORDERS<br>
This invention relates to aminoalkoxyindoles and associated compositions, methods for use as therapeutic agents, and methods of preparation thereof.<br>
The actions 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as a major modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain, are mediated through a number of receptor families termed 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5- HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. Based on a high level of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in the brain, it has been stated that the 5-HT6 receptor may play a role in the pathology and treatment of central nerve system disorders. In particular, 5-HT2-selective and 5-HT6 selective ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, mood disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia, bulimia and obesity, panic attacks, akathisia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, B.L Roth et al., /. Pharmacol Exp. Ther., 1994,268, pages 1403-14120, D. R. Sibley et al., Mol Pharmacol, 1993, 43, 320-327, AJ. Sleight et al., Neurotransmission, 1995,11&gt; 1-5, and A. J. Sleight et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997,2(3), 115-8.<br>

Compounds of the present invention can be made by a variety of methods depicted in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes shown and described below.<br>
The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fiesefs Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-15; Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplemental^ and Organic Reactions, Wiley &amp; Sons:<br><br>
New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.<br>
The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature<br>
range of from about -78 °C to about 150 °C, more preferably from about 0 °C to about 125 °C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20 °C.<br>
In one embodiment, compounds of formula I are prepared by the procedure<br>
1	O	^	A	C	/T	*7<br>
shown in Scheme A, wherein X is a leaving group and n, m, p, R , R , R , R , R , R , R and R8 are as described herein. The procedure of Scheme A is preferred for preparation ofindoles with -S(O)n-R at the 3-position.<br><br>
In Step 1 of Scheme A, a phenol O-alkylation is carried out by reacting a methylnitrophenol c with an alkylating agent d. This step may, in some embodiments,<br><br>
involve treatment of a methylnitrophenol c with K2CO3 or like base under polar solvent conditions to generate a phenolate anion (not shown), followed by treatment with alkylating agent d, wherein X is halo. The presence of iodide may be used to facilitate this alkylation where X is chloro. In other embodiments, leaving group X of alkylating agent d may be hydroxyl, and alkylation of phenol c may be achieved by treatment of phenol c with triphenylphosphine and diethylazodicarboxylate (DEAD) in the presence of alkylating agent d.<br>
Various aminoalkyl, heterocyclylalkyl, and heterocyclyl compounds with suitable leaving groups maybe used in Step 1. For example, alkylation with l-(2-haloethyI)-pyrrolidine provides an alkylating agent d wherein p is 2, R and R are hydrogen and R and R form a five-membered pyrrolidine ring. The alkylating agent N-(2-haloethyl)-dimethylamine provides a p equal to 2, with R5 and R6 as hydrogen and R7 and R8 as methyl. Use of 4-halopiperidine as alkylating agent d provides a p of 1, with R5 and R7 as hydrogen, and with R and R together forming a six-membered piperidine ring. In instances where one or both of R7 and Rs are hydrogen, such as 2-chloroethylamine and 2-chloroethylmethylamine, BOC protection or other suitable protection strategies may be used to protect the nitrogen of compound d in this step and in subsequent steps. See, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Syitthesis, 3r edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference. Numerous other suitable alkylating agents d will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art and may also be used in Step 1.<br>
In Step 2, indole synthesis is carried out by: (1) reaction of the O-alkyated methylnitrophenol e with dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDA) in the presence of base to form a condensation product (not shown); and (2) reduction of the nitro group on the condensation product to a corresponding amine to effect ring closure and provide the indole compound f. The condensation product is not isolated in Step 2, but is reduced in situ to allow ring closure for indole formation. Both condensation and reduction in this step may be carried out under polar solvent conditions. The in situ reduction may be achieved by addition of Pt or Pd catalyst on activated carbon in the presence of a hydrogen source such as potassium formate to provide the condensation product<br>
In Step 3, indole f prepared in Step 2 is sulfanylated by treatment with a disulfide I2—S—S—R2 g in the presence of metal hydride or like base under dry polar aprotic ;olvent conditions to provide a sulfanylated indole compound h. R may be aryl or<br><br>
heteroaryl as noted above, depending upon the particular embodiment desired. Many aryl disulfides and heteroaryl disulfides are available using known synthetic techniques and may be used in this Step to obtain sulfanylated indole compound h.<br>
In Step 4, sulfanylated indole h may optionally be oxidized using a peracid, OXON , or like oxidizing agent to provide a substituted indole I wherein n is 1 (sulfinyl) or 2 (sulfonyl)<br>
Numerous variations on the above procedure will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure. For example, O-alkylation may be carried out subsequent to formation of the indole ring as shown in the Examples below. Also, indole synthesis may be achieved via well-known routes other than that used in Step 2. The number, functionality and/or location of the R1 substituent groups may be selected to facilitate O-alkylation of phenolic hydroxyl groups at selected positions as desired for specific embodiments of the subject compounds.<br>
Compounds of formula I may also be prepared by the procedure shown in Scheme B, wherein m, p, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 are as described herein. The procedure of Scheme B is preferred for preparation of indole compounds with -S(O)n-R at the 2-position.<br><br>
Indole compound fas used in Step 1 of Scheme B may be prepared as described above for Scheme A or by other synthetic technique. In this Scheme, R is alkyl or a removable protecting group, and also serves as a directing group for lithiation.<br>
In Step 1 of Scheme B, indole compound f is treated with an alkyllithium reagent or other strong base under anhydrous polar aprotic conditions and dry ice/acetone temperature to generate a corresponding indole-lithium compound j by deprotonation at the 2- or 3- position. Where R4 is hydrogen, a suitable removable protecting group may be used to protect the indole nitrogen of compound f. Indole-lithium compound \ is not isolated but is used directly in Step 2.<br><br>
In Step 2, an aiylsulfonyl halide or heteroarylsulfonyl halide k^(X is preferably fluoro in this step) is added directly to indole-lithium compound j to provide substituted indole I. As in the case of Scheme A, many variations in the synthetic procedure shown in Scheme B may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure, and such synthetic procedures may also be used in accordance with the invention.<br>

Example 1 3-Benzenesulfonyl-7-(2-pyrrolidin-l-vl"ethoxy)-lfJ-indoIehydrochloride<br>
This example illustrates a method for producing 3-benzenesulfonyl-7-(2-pyrrolidin-l-yl-ethoxy)-lH-indole hydrochloride and other substituted indole compounds in accordance with the invention using the synthetic procedure outlined below in Scheme C<br><br><br><br>
Potassium carbonate (34.9g., 252 mmol) and sodium iodide (1.0 go 6.5 mmol) were added to a solution of 3-methyl-2-nitrophenol (10 g., 65.3 mmol). With stirring, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-pyrrolidine hydrochloride (16.65 g., 98 mmol) was added portion-wise to the solution. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 15 hours, at which time l-(2-chloroethyl)-pyrrolidine hydrochloride (8.5 g., 50 mmol) and potassium carbonate (18 g.&gt; 130 mmol) were added. After an additional hour of reflux, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and was washed with sequentially with water (1 x 100 mL) and brine (1 x 100 mL) The combined organic fractions spontaneously crystallized, and the solid was purified by flash chromatography (5% MeOH in CH2CI2) to give l-[2-(3-Methyl-2-nitrophenoxy)-ethyl]-pyrrolidine (10.291 g., 69%). MS: 251 (M+H)+<br>
Also prepared in a similar fashion, using N-(2-chloroethy)-dimethylamine hydrochloride as an electrophile rather than l-(2-cMoroethyl)-pyrrolidine hydrochloride, was the compound: Dimethyl-[2-(3-methyl-2-nitro-phenoxy)-ethyl]-amine (72%), MS: 225 (M+H)+<br><br>
A 100 mL flask equipped with magnetic stirrer and reflux condenser was charged with l-[2-(3-methyl-2-nitrophenoxy)-ethyl]-pyrrolidine (5.8 g.? 23 rnmol) from Step 1 and 50 mL dimethylformamide. To this solution was added pyrrolidine (5.0 g., 70 rnmol) and dimethylformamide dimethylacetal (8.3 g., 70 mmol.). With stirring, the<br><br>
solution was refluxed at 140°C for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated by heating at 100°C under 500 millitorr pressure for 5 hours, giving a crude brown solid which was dissolved in 50 mL ethanol. To this solution was added 100 mg of 5% Pd on charcoal and potassium formate (10.73 g.? 128 mmol.). The reaction mixture was refluxed ad 85°C for 1 hour and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by flash chromatography (5% MeOH in CH2C12) to give 4.53 g. of 7-(2-pyrrolidin-l-yl-ethoxy)-lH-indole as a viscous oil (74%), MS: 231 (M+H)+<br>
The following compound was prepared in a similar fashion, starting with dimethyl-[2-(3-methyl-2-nitro-phenoxy)-ethyl]-arnine rather than l-[2-(3-methyl-2-nitrophenoxy)-ethyl]-pyrrolidine: [2-(lH-indol-7-yloxy)-ethyl]-dimethyl-amine (69%), MS: 205 (M+H)+<br>
Step 3 3-Phenylsulfanyl-7-(2-pvrrolidin-l-yl-ethoxy)-l.fjr-indole<br><br>
To a solution of 7-(2-pyrrolidin-l-yl-ethoxy)-lH-indole (0.610 g.5 2.7 mmol) in 15 mL anhydrous dimethylformamide was added sodium hydride (0.140 g. of a 60% suspension in mineral oil, 3,5 rnmo!) portion-wise. The solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature for 20 minutes, at which time the initial off-gassing ended. Phenyi disulfide (0.654 g., 3 mmol) was added in one portion and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 hours. The reaction mixture was partitioned between water (50 mL) and ethyl acetate (50 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 25 mL) and the combined organic fractions were washed with water (2 x 25 mL) and brine (2 x 25 mL). After drying over MgSO4, the organic fraction was concentrated in vacuo and the resulting brown residue was purified by flash chromatography (10:1:0.1, CH2Cl2:MeOH:NH4OH) to give 0.653 g. 3-phenylsulfanyl-7-(2-pyrrolidin-l-yl-ethoxy)-lff-indole as a viscous brown oil (72%) MS: 339 (M+H)+.<br>

where Hill is the Hill slope, [ligand] is the concentration of competing radioligand and IC50 is the concentration of radioligand producing half-maximal specific binding of radioligand. The specific binding window is the difference between the Bmax and the basal parameters.<br>
Using the procedures of this Example, compounds of Formula I were tested and found to be selective 5-HT6 antagonists. Representative 5-HT6 affinity values (pKi) for compounds of the invention from the above assay are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
Example 10 Cognition Enhancement<br>
The cognition-enhancing properties of compounds of the invention maybe in a model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model.  4-month-old male Wistar rats (Charles River, The Netherlands) were used. Compounds were prepared daily and dissolved in physiological saline and tested at three doses. Administration was always given i.p. (injection volume 1 ml/kg) 60 minutes before Tl. Scopolamine hydrobromide was injected 30 minutes after compound injection. Two equal testing groups were made of 24 rats and were tested by two experimenters. The testing order of doses was determined randomly. The experiments were performed using a double blind protocol. All rats were treated once with each dose condition. The object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, AM Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for<br><br>
neurobiological studies of memory in rats. 1: Behavioral data. Behav. Brain Res. 31, 47-59.<br>
