				<td>Field of the invention<br>
This present invention relates to an improved green process for the preparation of 14-hydroxycodeinone from thebaine. This invention particularly relates to an efficient, improved and green method for the production of 14-hydroxycodeinone (2) (Scheme 1), which is a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of a strong analgesic agent Oxycodone (3). More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved green process for the preparation of 14-hydroxycodeinone from readily available starting material thebaine (1) which on oxidation produces 14-hydroxycodeinone (2) in excellent yield (92-81%).<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Reference may be made to J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955, 77, 6359-6361 for the production of 14-hydroxycodeinone.In this paper cold Chromic acid was applied for the oxidation of thebaine to 14-hydroxycodeinone. A solution of Chromic acid in 10 N sulphuric acid was added to a solution of thebaine in 1 N sulphuric acid maintained at 3-5 °C over 6-8 hours period. One hour after completion of addition, Na2SO3 was added to destroy any oxidant left and after work-up it produced of 14-hydroxycodeinone in 25% yield.<br>
Drawbacks: In this method, toxic Chromic acid and strong acidic reaction medium was used. The yield was very poor (25%).<br>
Another reference may be made to J. Med. Chem. 1974, 17, 1117. In this research paper, Thebaine was oxidized to 14-hydroxycodeinone by m-Chloroperbenzoic acid in a mixture of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid which produced 14-hydroxycodeinone in 74% yield. Here, thebaine in a mixture of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid was treated with m-chloroperbenzoic acid over 12 minute. The reaction mixture was then placed in a preheated (95 °C) stirring wax bath for 15 minutes and after removing from preheated bath, additional amount m-chloroperbenzoic acid was added. The reaction mixture was again placed in a heating bath for 20 minute and after removing it was again stirred for 10 minute and cooled in an ice bath. After work-up, it produced 14-hydroxycodeinone in 74% yield.<br>
Drawbacks: This method involved expensive m-chloroperbenzoic acid and very strong trifluoroacetic acid which are not cost effective and environment friendly. The procedure is a tedious one. More importantly, Ijima et al. reported that this reaction<br>
did not give reproducible yield (about 24.3%) and many undesirable products were formed (Helv. Chim. Acta. 1977, 60, 2135).<br>
Yet another reference may be made to Helv. Chim. Acta. 1977, 60, 2135.In this method, Thebaine was oxidized to 14-hydroxycodeinone by m-chloroperbenzoic acid in a mixture of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid in 24% yield. Here, thebaine in a mixture of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid was treated with m-chloroperbenzoic acid over 5 min. After heating for 5 min. at 95 °C (bath temperature) additional amount of m-chloroperbenzoic acid was added over 5 min. The reaction mixture was again heated for 10 min at 90 °C and then stirred for 10 min at RT, cooled and poured in ice water. After work-up it produced 14-hydroxycodeinone in 24.3% yield. Apart from this, 8-acetoxy-14-hydroxydihydrothebaine was also formed in 36.5% yield as undesired product. Drawbacks: It involved expensive m-chloroperbenzoic acid and very strong trifluoroacetic acid. The procedure was also a complex one. Above all, the yield is very poor (24.3%).<br>
Yet another reference may be made to Indian J. Chem. 1998, 37B, 749-753.In this procedure, microbial transformation of thebaine to 14-hydroxycodeinone was carried out by employing Bacillus sp which was isolated from soil using morphine as the sole source of carbon. The yield of 14-hydroxycodeinone by this method was 53%.<br>
Drawbacks: It produced poor yield (53%) of 14-hydroxycodeinone from thebaine accompanying 14-hydroxycodeine as the side product (yield 9%).<br>
Yet another reference may be made to Tetrahedron 1999, 55, 11429-11436. Rice et al. developed a method for the oxidation of codeinone to 14-hydroxycodeinone by employing different oxidizing agents. Among them stoichiometric amount of Co(OAc)3 furnished maximum yield (51%) of 14-hydroxycodeinone.<br>
Drawbacks: The yield of the method is poor and many side products are formed. Additionally, stoichiometric amount of toxic metal catalyst was required.<br>
Yet another reference may be made to US Patent, 2005, 6,864,370. Here, thebaine bitartrate monohydrate was used for the preparation of 14-hydroxycodeinone. 30% Hydrogen peroxide was added to a solution of thebaine bitartrate monohydrate in a mixture of water, isopropanol and formic acid at 0-5 °C.<br>
The reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1-2 hours followed by heating at 40- 45 °C for 2-3 hours. After work-up, yield of 14-hydroxycodeinone was 90%.<br>
Drawbacks: Though the yield was excellent, the preparation of starting material thebaine bitartrate monohydrate was a laborious process and involved several steps such as thebaine bitartrate monohydrate was prepared from N-carboethoxynorthebaine, which itself was produced from N-carboethoxynorcodeinone. Additionally, it involved acidic reaction media.<br>
Yet another reference may be made to US Patent, 2006, 7,071,336. Francis et al. used concentrate poppy straw as the source of thebaine. Poppy straw was treated with water, dilute H2SO4, formic acid and 30% H2O2. After 30 min stirring the solution was heated in an oil bath to 50 °C for 20-24 hours to furnish 14-hydroxycodeinone in 74% yield.<br>
Drawbacks: The required time for the completion of the reaction was very long and the yield was not also very good. Additionally the method involved acidic reaction media.<br>
Yet another reference may be made to U.S. patent application, 2006, 20060111383 A1. Oxidation of thebaine was carried out by adding 30% hydrogen peroxide in 85% formic acid over a period of two hours followed by stirring for additional 3 hours. The corresponding yield of 14-hydroxycodeinone is 75%.<br>
Drawbacks: The method involved acidic reaction media and the yield was also not References may be made to<br>

Oxidation of thebaine to 14-hydroxycodeinone by V2O5 in presence of 30% H2O2 in water/THF mixture and followed by hydrogenation by Pd/C in aqueous acetic acid to produce oxycodone<br>
Example (1A):<br>
Preparation of 14-hydroxycodeinone:<br>
In a 100 ml two-necked round bottom flask, thebaine (1) (0.311 g, 1 mmol) was mixed with 30% H2O2 (1.5 equiv.) and 20 mol% of vanadium pentoxide (0.036 g) in a 10 ml mixture of H20/THF (1:1). The reaction mixture was then refluxed for 30 min. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was neutralised with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and was extracted with ethyl acetate (3x10 ml). The organic layer was washed with brine (1x10 ml), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under vacuum to give the crude product which was recrystallized from methanol to afford<br>
pure 14-hydrxycodeinone (2) in 92% yield (0.287 g). The aqueous phase was<br>
reused for the subsequent fresh reactions for the five times without any loss of<br>
activity.<br>
