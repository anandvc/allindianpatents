SYNTHESIS METHOD OF CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL RAW MATERIALS AND HIGH-OCTANE FUEL, AND HIGH-OCTANE FUEL COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field The present invention relates to a method of producing chemical industrial raw materials, a high-octane fuel, and a mixture thereof from ethanol by using calcium phosphate or calcium phosphate carrying thereon a metal as a catalyst.<br>
Background of the Invention Recently, an attempt of supplying a large amount of chemical industrial raw materials by using alcohols, in particular, ethanol as the raw material in place of chemical industrial raw materials induced from petroleum as been widely noticed.<br>
A method of producing ethylene from ethanol as the raw material wherein calcium phosphate is used as a catalyst is known but the method shows a low activity and is economically disadvantageous. Also, as a dehydration method of an alcohol, the use of a solid acid catalyst such as zeolite, etc., is known but in the method, aluminum in the zeolite structure is released by the action of water formed by the reaction, which results in lowering the catalyst activity, and the method cannot be industrially used for a long period of time.<br><br>
A method of producing acetaldehyde from ethanol by using calcium phosphate or calcium phosphate carrying a metal such as Cu, Ni, etc. is known but the activity and the selectivity are low, and the method is economically disadvantageous. Also, as a dehydration method of ethanol, a solid base catalyst such as a carrier-type platinum-group catalyst, MgO, etc., is known but there are problems in the point of the dispersion of the characteristics with impurities and the stability.<br>
As a method of producing diethyl ether from ethanol, a solid acid catalyst such as zeolite, etc., is known but aluminum in the zeolite structure is released by water formed by the reaction, whereby the catalyst activity is lowered and the catalyst cannot be used for a long period of time.<br>
As a method of producing 1,3-butadiene from ethanol, a method of using AI2O3' ZnO (6 : 4) as a catalyst [S-K, Bhattacharyya and N.O.Ganguly; J. Appl. Chem.; 12, 105 (1962) ) ] and a method of using sepiolite adsorbed with a metal (Mn, V, Mo. W. etc.) (Japanese Patent Application Nos. 178281/1980 and 157814/1981) are proposed. However, in the former method, there are problems about a method of stably producing the catalyst and the thermal stability of the catalyst itself, and the latter method is the result in a batch test level and thus in the method, there is a problem in the point of a mass production.<br><br>
Accordingly, 1, 3-butadiene is generally produced from a fossil fuel containing butenes' As an industrial synthesis method of 1-butanol, an acetaldehyde method, a Reppe method, etc., are known but these methods are complicated and poor in efficiency. Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 305238/1993 discloses a method of obtaining gasoline-base hydrocarbons from lower alcohols using a catalyst formed by carrying a metal on a calcium phosphate-base compound.<br>
DisclQSurf'of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a production method for efficiently obtaining chemical industrial raw materials such as ethylene, acetaldehyde, diethyl ether, 1-butanol, 1,3-butadiene, etc., a high-octane fuel, and a mixture thereof using ethanol as the raw material.<br>
As the result of detailed investigations on the method of obtaining chemical industrial raw materials such as ethylene, acetaldehyde, diethyl ether, 1-butanol, 1,3-butadiene, etc., and a high-octane fuel, etc./ using ethanol as the raw material by an industrially advantageous method, the present invention has found that the above-described object can be attained by using a calcium phosphate-base catalyst.<br><br>
Brief Description of the Invention Fig. 1 is a graph showing the X-ray diffraction patterns of a high-crystalline powder and a low-crystalline powder.<br>
Fig. 2 is a view showing the reaction apparatus used in the example of the invention, and<br>
Fig. 3 is a view showing the relation between the reaction time of a catalyst repeating a regeneration treatment and the ethanol conversion.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Then, the invention is described in detail.<br>
As calcium phosphate, the existences of hydroxyapatite [Ca10 (PO4) '(OH) 2] / calcium tertiary phosphate [Ca3(PO4) 2]/ calcium hydrogen phosphate [CaHP04- (0 to 2)H20], calcium diphosphate (CazPzO,) / octacalcium dihydrogen phosphate [CagHg (PO4) g- 5H2O], tetracalcium phosphate [Ca4 (PO4) 2O], amorphous calcium phosphate [Caj (PO4) 2-nH20, etc., are known.<br>
Hydroxyapatite is usually shown by the above-described stoichiometric composition but the feature thereof is that even when the composition does not satisfy the stoichiometric composition, hydroxyapatite can take an apatite structure. The hydroxyapatite of such a non-stoichiometric composition can be shown by [Ca10-.(HP04),(P04)6.,{OH)2-z-nH20 {0 
Also, amorphous calcium phosphate is calcium<br><br>
phosphate which is halo in the X-ray diffraction.<br>
A low-crystalline powder in the invention is a low-crystalline powder the X-ray diffraction peak of which is broad as compared with that of a high-crystalline powder. For example, using hydroxyapatite, the X-ray diffraction patterns of the high-crystalline powder and the low-crystalline powder are shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In the present invention, by using a catalyst made of these calcium phosphates, particularly low-crystalline calcium phosphates singly or as a mixture, wherein the Ca/P mol ratio is adjusted to from 1.4 to 1.8, as it is, or a catalyst by carrying an activation metal or the oxide thereof on the catalyst such that the (ca + metal)/P mol ratio becomes from 1 to 2, the above-described chemical industrial raw materials and a high-octane fuel are efficiently produced.<br>
In this invention, there is no particular restriction on the production method of the calcium phosphate (s) used as the catalyst, and the calcium phosphate (s) can be synthesized by a known synthesizing method such as a dry solid-phase reaction method, a wet precipitation reaction method, a wet solid-phase reaction method, a hydrothermal synthetic method, etc. Also, the low-crystalline calcium phosphate(s) can be obtained by burning the calcium phosphate (s) synthesized by the above-described method in a low-temperature region or by mechanochemically grinding the burned powder.<br><br>
Also, by using a proper template, pores thereof may be controlled. Furthermore, the Ca/P mol ratio can be properly changed at the preparation of the calcium phosphate(s).<br>
For example, in the case of synthesizing hydroxyapatite, a calcium salt solution or phosphate solution of a definite concentration is added dropwise to an aqueous solution with stirring at room temperature while controlling the pH, the product precipitated is collected, washed, dried, ground, and, if necessary, burned to form a catalyst raw material. As the calcium salt used, Ca{0H)2 or Ca(N03)2 is preferred and the phosphate used, ammonium phosphate is preferred. The control of the Ca/P mol ratio of hydroxyapatite is carried out by controlling the composition ratio of the salts of the raw materials and the synthetic condition. For example, at the synthesis, when the aqueous solution is controlled to basic with aqueous ammonia, etc., the Ca/P mol ratio is increased, and when the aqueous solution is controlled to neutral or weak acidic with a diluted acid, the Ca/P mol ratio is lowered. Also, hydroxyapatite can be obtained, after mixing calcium phosphates having the known Ca/P mol ratio, by burning the mixture in a moisture atmosphere.<br>
When hydroxyapatite is used as a catalyst, the Ca/P mol ratio is adjusted to from 1.4 to 1.8, and preferably from 1.5 to 1.7 and, if desired, the burning temperature<br><br>
and the burning atmosphere are selected. In this case, it is desirable that the specific area of the catalyst is at least 2 m2/g.<br>
The control of the Ca/P mol ratio in calcium phosphate means to control the kinds and the distribution densities of a solid acid point and a solid base point, which are catalytically active points of the catalyst surface. In this case, the strength and the amounts of the acid point and base point can be determined by NH3-TPD andCOa-TPD, or a pyridine adsorption method, an indicator method, etc.<br>
Also, as a method of controlling the acidity and the basicity of the catalyst surface, it is known to carry a metal as a generally known means.<br>
For example, by carrying a dehydrogenation reaction accelerating metal such as, typically, Ni, Zn, Cu, Pd, or Pt on hydroxyapatite, the effect same as the increase of the Ca/P mol ratio is obtained, that is, the solid basicity is increased.<br>
Also, in the case of hydroxyapatite, by carrying a dehydration reaction accelerating metal such as, typically, Al on the hydroxyapatite, the effect same as lowering the Ca/P mol ratio is obtained, that is, the solid acidic feature is increased.<br>
Accordingly, in place of changing the Ca/P mol ratio, by carrying such a metal on hydroxyapatite, the solid-  acid/basicity  of  the  surface  of  the<br><br>
hydroxyapatite catalyst can be also changed.  Also, according to the desired product, it is preferred plural metals are carried on together for obtaining the synergistic  effect  or  improving  the  durability. Examples of the plural metals which are carried on together include transition metals such as Zn, Co, Cr, Mo, W, Fe, Ni, Cu, Mn, Ti, V, Ga, Zr, Nb, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Pb, La, Ce, Eu, Y, etc.; noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Au, Ir, Ru, Ag, etc.; alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as Ba Na, K, Li, Sr, Ca, Mg, Cs, Rb, etc. Also, as the case may be, the oxides or the sulfides of these metals can be used. These plural metals which are carried on together can be used in the range of from 0.05 to 70 mol% to calcium of the calcium phosphate catalyst and the kinds of them are properly selected according to the purposes.<br>
These metals, metal oxides, or metal sulfides are carried on calcium phosphate by an ordinary method. For example, definite amounts of the salts of the metals which are carried on the calcium phosphate are added to the liquid containing the calcium phosphate(s) obtained by treating as described above, and the mixture is solidified by evaporating off water. Or, the solution of the salts of the metals which are carried on calcium phosphate is sprayed onto the calcium phosphate(s) obtained and after drying, the mixture is burned in the air or in a reducing atmosphere.<br><br>
Also, a catalyst having both the characteristics of the solid acid point and the solid base point can be synthesized by properly mixing a solid acidic catalyst and a solid basic catalyst.<br>
In the present invention, the synthesis of the chemical industrial raw materials and a high-octane fuel from ethanol as the raw material is practiced by properly selecting the calcium phosphate(s) used, the Ca/P mol ratio, the activation metals, and the reaction conditions (temperature, space velocity, pressure, etc.).<br>
For example, hydroxyapatite the Ca/P mol ratio of which is controlled to 1.6 or lower or calcium tertiary phosphate having an increased specific area value have the property of a solid acid. In this case. By carrying the dehydration reaction accelerating metal such as Al, etc., on the above-described calcium phosphate, the property of the catalyst as a solid acid is increased.<br>
The addition amount of one kind of the metal or the oxide thereof is in the range of from 0.05 to 50 mol% to calcium of the calcium phosphate. When the addition amount is less than 0.05 mol%, the effect of adding the metal is not obtained. When at least 50 mol% one metal component is added, the main constituent becomes the metal phosphate, which holds the position of the calcium phosphate-containing catalyst.<br>
When such a calcium phosphate or metal-carrying calcium phosphate having the increased property as a<br><br>
solid acid is used as the catalyst of the conversion reaction of ethanol, the selectivity of ethylene and diethyl ether in the reaction product can be increased.<br>
For example, in the case of ethylene, the use of the above-described calcium phosphate having replaced with and/or carrying thereon 3 mol% Al improves the catalyst activity as compared with the case of using the above-described calcium phosphate carrying no metal, and the temperature at which 100% the conversion or the selectivity of ethanol is lowered by 50'C or more.<br>
Also, in the case of diethyl ether, the use of the above-described calcium phosphate carrying Al largely improves the selectively as compared with the case of the above-described calcium phosphate carrying no metal.<br>
Also, by carrying the combination of at least two dehydrogenation reaction accelerating metals such as, Ni/ Zn, Cu, Fe, Al, In, Pd, etc., on hydroxyapatite wherein the Ca/P mol ratio is adjusted to at least 1.55 or calcium phosphate having the (Ca + metal) /P mol ratio of from 1 to 2, the property of the catalyst as the solid base is increased. In this case, the addition amounts of the metals are in the range of from 1 to 70 mol% in sum total (the upper limited the addition amount of one metal is 30 mol%) to calcium of the calcium phosphate. When the addition amounts are less than 1 mol%, the above-described catalyst is not excellent as compared with existing known metal-added catalysts. On the other<br><br>
hand, in the case of adding at least 70 mol% the plural metals in sum total, there occurs a problem in the stability of the calcium phosphate.<br>
When such a hydroxyapatite having the strengthened property as the solid base is used for an ethanol conversion reaction as the catalyst, the selectivity of acetaldehyde in the reaction product can be increased,<br>
For example, in the case of using the calcium<br>
phosphate carrying thereon Cu, Fe, and Al and having the<br>
(Ca + metal)/P mol ratio of from 1 to 2, the conversion<br>
and the selectivity of acetaldehyde are largely improved<br>
as compared with the case of existing known catalysts.<br>
When a catalyst made of hydroxyapatite the Ca/P mol ratio of which is adjusted to from 1.60 to 1,80, or a catalyst made of calcium phosphate having the (Ca + metal)/P mol ratio of from 1 to 2 and having carried thereon at least one metal selected from the above-described dehydrogenation reaction accelerating metals and dehydration reaction acceleratingmetals, such as Ba, Na, K, Li, Cs, Sr, Y, Ce, Sb, Eu, Ti, W, and Zr, or the oxides and sulfides of these metals in the range of not more than 50 mol% to calcium of the calcium phosphate such that an acid and a base co-exist is used for the ethanol conversion reaction, the selectivity of 1-butanol can be increased at the range of from 300°C to 450'C.<br>
For example, hydroxyapatite wherein the Ca/P mol<br><br>
ratio is adjusted to 1.65 or the above-described calcium phosphate carrying thereon Ce can increase the selectivity of 1-butanol to from 60 to 65% at about 4002'0.<br>
Also, when a catalyst made of hydroxyapatite wherein the Ca/P mol ratio is adjusted to from 1.55 to 1.80, or a catalyst made of calcium phosphate having the (Ca + metal) /P mol ratio of from 1 to 2 and having carried thereon at least one metal selected from the above-described dehydrogenation reaction accelerating metals and dehydration reaction accelerating metals, such as W, Zr, Al, Zn, Ti, Sb, Y, La, Au, and Na, or the oxides and sulfides of these metals in the range of not more than 50 mol% to calcium of the calcium phosphate such that an acid and a base co-exist is used for the ethanol conversion reaction, the selectivity of 1,3-butadiene can be increased at the range of from 450'C to 700'C.<br>
For example, hydroxyapatite wherein the Ca/P mol ratio is adjusted to 1.62 or the above-described calcium phosphate carrying thereon Al or Zr can increase the selectivity of 1, 3-butadiene to from 35 to 50% at about 500°C,<br>
Furthermore, when a catalyst made of hydroxyapatite wherein the Ca/P mol ratio is adjusted to from 1. 55 to 1. 80, or a catalyst made of calcium phosphate having the (Ca + metal)/P mol ratio of from 1 to 2 and having carried thereon at least one metal selected from the   above-described   dehydrogenation   reaction<br><br>
accelerating metals and dehydration reaction accelerating metals, such as Ni, Ba, Li, Cs, Zn, Ag, Mn, Ce, Sr, Y, Co, Fe, Sb, Eu, Ti, and W, or the oxides and sulfides of these metals in the range of not more than 50 mol% to calcium of the calcium phosphate such that an acid and a base co-exist is used for the ethanol conversion reaction, the selectivity of a high-octane fuel can be increased at the range of from 300'C to 7 00'C.<br>
For example, hydroxyapatite wherein the Ca/P mol ratio is adjusted to 1.65 or the calcium phosphate carrying thereon Li or Zn and having the (Ca + metal)/P mol ratio of from 1 to 2 can increase the selectivity of the high-octane fuel to at least 80% at about from 300'C to 700'20<br>
The high-octane fuel in this invention is a motorcar fuel having at least 96,0 by a Research method octane value test method regulated by JIS K 2280, and mean liquid hydrocarbons containing oxygen-containing compounds such as alcohols, ethers, etc., which are known as octane booster, in the components.<br>
Because the composition of gasoline at present is nonpolar hydrocarbons, when few % water intermixes in gasoline, a trouble occurs in starting of engine, and hence a draining agent is required but the high-octane fuel of the invention contains large amounts of polar oxygen-containing hydrocarbons such as unreacted ethanol, butanol, etc., and is a fuel without need of a draining<br><br>
agent,<br>
Now, the existing amount of the oxygen-containing compounds in the fuel of the invention can be controlled by the Ca/P mol ratio, the addition of the metal, and the reaction temperature. That is, by increasing the Ca/P mole ratio, by adding the dehydrogenation reaction accelerating metal, or by lowering the reaction temperature, the existing amount of the oxygen-containing compounds in the fuel can be increased.<br>
In addition, if necessary, in the case of lowering the content of the oxygen-containing compounds, the Ca/P mol ratio may be lowered, the dehydration reaction accelerating metal is added, or the reaction temperature may be raised.<br>
The calcium phosphate prepared as described above can be used in any form such as, for example, granules, powders, etc., and if necessary, after molding the calcium phosphate to an optional form such as spheres, pellets, a honeycomb form, etc., the molded product is dried and burned at use. The calcium phosphate may be carried on  a  carrier  such  as  alumina,  silica, alumina-silica,  zeolite, clay, etc., well-known in persons skilled in the art. Burning is carried out at a temperature of from200'C to 1200'C, and preferably from 500°C to 700°C.<br>
In general, when a solid catalyst is used, it is said that the existence of water in raw materials is not<br><br>
preferred since the activity of the catalyst is lowered. However, in the catalyst of the invention, in the existence of water, lowering of the activity of the catalyst is not observed and thus, the catalyst can be used for a long period of time. Accordingly, in the case of water-containing ethanol, the reaction proceeds sufficiently, and hence the catalyst of the invention has the advantage that crude ethanol which is a simple distillate of fermentation ethanol obtained by a biotechnology can be used in a commercial plant.<br>
The reaction temperature in the invention, at which ethanol is brought into contact with the calcium phosphate catalyst, is usually in the range of from 200'2C to 700°C, and the optimum reaction temperature can be properly selected according to the kind of the catalyst and the kind of the synthesized product. In the reaction with the catalyst of the invention, acetaldehyde, diethyl ether, and 1-butanol are high-selectively obtained in a relatively low-temperature region and ethylene and 1,3-butadiene are high-selectively obtained in a relatively high-temperature region. The gas time space velocity (GHSV) is from 100 to 100,000 (1/h) , and preferably from 5,000 to 50,000 (1/h) . Also, the space velocity is lower than 100, the economy becomes bad. Also, when the space velocity is higher than 100,000, the temperature control in the inside of the reaction column by endothermic or exothermic becomes difficult to cause<br><br>
a temperature distribution, which results in lowering the selectivity of the desired synthetic product. By contacting ethanol as the vapor-phase directly or under the existence of an inert carrier gas such as nitrogen or helium with the catalyst, the ethanol can be reacted with a good efficiency.<br>
In this case, for keeping the catalyst activity, a reactive gas such as hydrogen, a hydrocarbon, etc., may be adding into the carrier gas. As the reaction system of the reaction column, an any method such as a batch system, a continuous system, a fixed bed system, a moving bed system, or a fluid bed system, may be employed and the reaction may be carried out at normal pressure or under pressure. In the case of a reaction of precipitating a large amount of carbon on the catalyst, a plant by the above-described system incorporating a catalyst regeneration treatment apparatus is desirable. When the catalyst which is used for the synthetic reaction of the above-described chemical industrial raw materials other than the synthetic reaction of ethylene and diethyl ether is used for a long period of time, carbon is precipitated on the surface of the catalyst to lower the ethanol conversion. Therefore, the catalyst is periodically subjected to a regeneration treatment by heating under an oxygen atmosphere, whereby the activity of the catalyst can be regenerated. Fig. 2 is a schematic view of an embodiment of the apparatus of practicing the<br><br>
present invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, ethanol as a raw material is supplied to an alcohol carburetor 2 through a micro-feeder (moderate pressure liquid feed pump) 1. To the alcohol carburetor 2 are supplied a 1% Ar/He-base carrier gas from a gas bomb 3 and a gas from a model gas mixer 4, they enter a reaction pipe 5 together with ethanol, and reaction products according to the reaction temperature are exhausted. The reaction products are chemically confirmed by an analyzer 6.<br>
The reaction products thus obtained can be separated and purified using a separation and purification method which has hitherto been used, such as a rectification, an extraction, an adsorption method, etc. [Example]<br>
A catalyst was synthesized as follows. Also, for the measurement of the specific area of the powder obtained, SA3100, manufactured by COLTER CO., LTD., was used, and for the measurements of the Ca/P mol ratio and the (Ca + metal)/P mol ratio, a fluorescent X-ray analyzer, RIXIOOO, manufactured by Rigaku Denki Kogyo K.K. was used.<br>

Each sample prepared in Samples 67 to 96 and Comparative Samples 47 to 67 was formed to tablets of from #14 to #2 6. Then, the pretreatment was applied to the sample as the case of ethylene.<br>
After finishing the pretreatment, the reaction was carried out under the conditions of a ethanol<br><br>
concentration of 20%, a methanol concentration of 20%, a carrier gas flow rate of 80 cc/minute (total flow rate 100 cc/minj and a space velocity (GHSV) of 10,000 (1/h) at a normal pressure. In the case of the synthesis of high-octane fuel,, the synthesis was carried out at a reaction temperature of from 300°C to TOO2'C. The identification and the determination of the reaction gas were carried out by the same methods as the case of ethylene. As the reaction apparatus, the gas flow-type catalytic reaction apparatus shown in Fig. 2 was used. Evaluation results are shown in Table 7 and Table 8 below. In the tables, the liquid fraction is the reaction gas liquefied by a cooling pipe set to 0'C. The evaluation of the liquid fraction was carried out the evaluation method of JIS.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As an example of the composition analysis of the liquid fraction, the analytical results of Sample 73 are shown below. The main components were oxygen-containing hydrocarbon compounds and the contents were as follows.<br>
Ethanol = 10% (unreacted ethanol) , C2Hio = 6%, C4HeO<br><br>
The components of other liquid fractions formed by the reactions used the catalysts of the examples were almost same as those of Sample 73 but the contents of the components in the fuels were different by the kind of the catalyst and the reaction temperatures.<br>
After operating 12 hours using 0.6 ml of the tablets of #14 to #26 formed by Sample 73, under the conditions of a reaction temperature of 500'20, an ethanol concentration of 20%, a space velocity (GHSV) of 10,000 (1/h), a supplying mixed gas total flow rate of 100 cc/min., and a normal pressure, the catalyst was treated in a 2% oxygen atmosphere at 480'C for 15 minutes as a catalyst regeneration treatment, the catalyst was successively used under the same conditions (500°C, EtOH concentration = 20%, GHSV= 10,000 (l/h) , andV= 0.6ml), the conversion of ethanol was measured, whereby the stability of the catalyst activity with the passage of time was measured. The result is shown in Fig. 3. The result shows that by a periodical catalyst activity treatment,  the  catalyst  activity  is  completely<br><br>
maintained.<br>
Industrial Applicability The catalyst of the present invention can be easily produced, is stable, and can efficiently obtain desired substances from ethanol by selecting the Ca/P mol ratio of the catalyst, the activating metal, and a reaction temperature according to the desired substances without lowering the activity even in the existence of water.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
