The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Tetracyclic dipyrano-coumarin compounds with anti-HIV and anti-Mycobacterium Tuberculosis activities<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the compounds that inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and possess anti-Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB) activities. The present invention also relates to the synthesis of the compounds and to the use of such compounds as effective candidate drugs for treatment of HIV-1 and/or TB infections in patients. More specifically, this invention relates to certain tetracyclic dipyrano-coumarin derivatives that possess both anti-HIV-1 and anti-TB activities.<br><br>
Background of the invention<br>
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by HIV infection is a malignant infectious disease affecting human health, and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortility in human. Since the first case of AIDS patient was reported in USA in 1981,the FDA has approved total 22 different drugs for the treatment of AIDS patients in clinic. Even though the successful combination treatment of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was used, most of the AIDS patients still can not be cured up to now. Because the current launched anti-HIV drugs are expensive and toxic, it is difficult for the administration of the HIV-infected patients for a long term therapy. Furthermore, the emergence of the drug resistance is frequently occurred leading that the therapy has to be ceased. Thus it is a long-sought goal of countries and pharmacologists to develop highly effective drugs against not only the wild strains but also the resistant strains of HIV with low toxic and inexpensive properties.<br>
In 1992, researchers of national cancer institute (NCI) of USA reported 8 novel dipyrano-coumarin derivatives containing tricyclic and tetracyclic rings with anti-HIV-1 activities (J. MED. CHEM. 1992, 35, 2735), which were first isolated from a tropical rainforest plant (calophllum lanigerum) in Malaysia. Among them, the most active (+)-calanolide A (2) exihibited an EC50 value of 0.1 µM and TC50 value of 20µM, repectively. The therapeutic index (TI) is within 16-279 (J. MED. CHEM. 1996, 39, 1303). When the concentration reached at 0.1 µM, (+)-calanolide A not only inhibited HIV-1 replication but also protected CEM-SS cells (human T-lymphoblastic cells) from HIV-1 attack. (+)-Calanolide A is active against the AZT- -resistant strains (G-9106) of HIV-1 as well as the TIBO of pyridinone-resistant A17 strains. Experimental studies further demonstrated that (+)-calanolide A synergized well with the first line of nucleosides reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) against HIV-1 such as AZT or other NNRTIs against HIV-1 in present clinical practice. Conseqently, (+)-calanolide A is confirmed as a novel HIV-1 non-nucleosides reverse transcriptase inhibitor.<br><br>
Recent investigation in vitro also demonstrated naturally occurring anti-HIV-1 drug calophyllum compounds to be active against TB (Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2004, 1199-1207). (+)-Calanolide A inhibited H37Rv strain growth with MIC90 of 3.13 µg/mL. Many patients with AIDS died as a result from a variety of infections, in which infections caused by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis often occurred. To find a novel active compound which can directly inhibit HIV virus and anti-TB has important significance in study of prolonging life of the patients with AIDS and reducing the death rate of the patients caused by TB infection. <br>
In the treatment of the patients with infections of HIV and TB, current strategies, such as the therapies of HAART and antituberculosis drugs, can always result in the related side effects including nausea, vomiting, rash, abnormal liver function and the like, the therapy for HIV has to be ceased. Discontinuing treatment results in a higher probability of the virus infections. Thus, to find a pharmaceutical agent which can be used for treatment of HIV and TB infections in patients has importante significance.<br>
Due to the low content of naturally occurring calophyllum compounds in plants, the amount of these compounds which can be extracted from the plants is very limited.  It would pose a risk of destroying the environment to obtain a large amount of the compounds. Chenera and Kucherenko et al. reported the synthesis routes of racemic calanolide A, respectively (J Org Chem, 1993, 58, 5605; Tetrahedron Lett, 1995, 36, 5475). The present inventors also reported the total synthesis of racemic calanolide A and 11-demethyl calanolide A (Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica, 1999, 34 (9):  673; Chinese Chem. Lett. 1997, 8: 859,Chinese Chem. Lett. 1998, 9: 433). In 2003, the present inventors have applied for Chinese patent (Application Number: 03123628, 6, CN154849A) which described a new synthesis method by using PPA as a reaction reagent to selectively provide a key intermediate of tricyclic coumarin in large scale. In fact, it is important to identify compounds with enhanced activity by modifying the structure of compound 2, and reducing chiral centre of the structure based on the current research results.<br>
In a further research, the present inventors found that compound 3 gave a similar activity level against HIV-1 as compared to the parent native compound (+)-calanolide A in vitro;yet compound 3 has two chiral centre carbons less, and is  simpler and more convenient to synthesize. Compound 3 can be obtained from phloroglucinol as starting material through three reaction steps. Through the further structural development to compound 3, the invention has been accomplished.<br><br>

The purpose of the present invention is to provide a procedure (scheme 1) for synthesis of compound 4 through an improved Pechman reaction to offer coumarin (6) from phloroglucinol as starting material, characterized in that methanol saturated with dry HCl gas is used to replace usual sulfuric acid catalyst. Good yields are achieved at the room temperature for the condensation reaction of phloroglucinol with ?-substituted-?-alkylacyl (alkanoyl) ethyl acetates, such as ethyl propionylacetate, ethyl butyrylacetate, ethyl benzoylacetate in the methanol containing HCl gas. According to a previous method (CN1548439A), reaction of the obtained compound 6 with crotonic acid in PPA, which  acts as both a solvent and a catalyst for cyclization, gives chromenes (5a) in high yield and a minor by-product (5b). The additional characteristic is to construct ring D from compound 5a for synthesizing tetracyclic compound (4) by the aid of microwave catalysis, a new synthetic means, as shown in the following reaction scheme 1:<br>
Reaction scheme (1):<br><br>
All compounds mentioned above are racemates. R1-R8 are as defined the same as above description.<br>
Wherein the ?-substituted-?-alkanoyl ethyl acetates used in Pechman reaction are obtained with the methods of:<br>
(1)	A chlorine atom is introduced at the position R2 of the coumarin (6) by the reaction (Cabon O., Buisson D., Larcheveque M., et al. Tetrahedron Asymmetry, 1995, 6 (9): 2199-2210). Further replacement of the chlorine atom with the related reagents can introduce more diversity at the position R2, such as replacement of the chlorine atom through the nucleophilic reagents.<br><br>
(2)	 Reaction of malonic acid with acetone resulted in Meldrum’s acid (Lermer L., Neeland E. G., Ounsworth J. P., et al. Can J Chem, 1992, 70 (5): 1427-1445). Condensation of the Meldrum’s acid with any organic acid offered diversity at the ?-position of the Meldrum’s acid. Further, diversity is introduced at the R1 position by reaction of phloroglucinol.<br><br>
(3) Another characteristic of the present invention is to provide a chloroethyl group at the R1 position by the improved Pechman reaction with ?-chloro-?-substituted-?-alkanoyl acetic ester, such as  . Chlorine atom of the chloroethyl group at the R1 position can be replaced by various reactions to introduce more diversity, such as nucleophilic substituted reaction (as shown scheme below), Grignard reagent reaction, wittig reaction, and so on. <br><br>
The present invention uses the building blocks shown below for introducing diversity at R1 and/or R2 position and has investigated the structure activity relationships (SARs) for anti-HIV-1 and anti-TB thereof. <br><br>
2. The synthetic method of the compound of general formula I in which X is S is described as reaction scheme 2. After the compound (6) is obtained as described above, both hydroxyl groups of 6 are protected by groups such as p-methylphenylsulfonyl group to give compound 8. 8 reacts with a thionating reagent to give compound 9 in which the C=O group is replaced by C=S group at the C2 position. Removal of two protective groups gave compound 10. Accordingly, construction of ring C (11) and ring D (4) is completed subsequently. The reaction is shown in the following reaction scheme 2:<br><br>
Reaction scheme 2<br><br>
3. Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a novel synthetic strategy for the compound of 4 (reaction scheme 3), characterized in that the two protecting groups of compound 8 are selectively removed under different reaction conditions. The 5-OH is selectively free at first to give compound 12, subsequently ring D is constructed to offer compound 13. Removal of the remaining protecting group gains 7-OH compound of 14, which allows constructing the ring C at the last step. To address this novel synthetic strategy, it is valuable with its regioselectivity of reaction for large-scale synthesis of chemical library in a parallel manner synthesis.<br><br>
Reaction scheme 3  <br>
Wherein, R1-R7 are as defined above. <br>
The synthesis method of the present invention is detailed as follows.<br>
4. The specific reaction conditions of the first synthesis method of the present invention are indicated in reaction scheme 4. The compound 6 is synthesized from phloroglucinol as starting material reacted with ß-keto-ethylacetate in dry HCl gas saturated methanol. The tricyclic ring compound 5 can be obtained via the described procedure above. Ring D is finally constructed to give compound 4 by microwave catalysis. When campared to the conventional method, this method has the advantages of significantly shortened reaction time, increased yield, simplified experimental operation, and being suitable for extensive parallel reaction. The reaction is shown in the following reaction scheme 4:<br>
Reaction scheme 4:<br><br>
Wherein, R1-R8 are as defined as above.<br>
In the reaction a, compound 6 is obtained from phloroglucinol according to the literature method (J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39: 1303-1313). For example, compound 6 is produced by Pechmann reaction of phloroglucinol with ?-substituted-?-alkanoyl acetic esters, such as acetoacetic ester in the presence of phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, or sulfuric acid as catalyst. The present inventors found that compound 6 can be obtained by using methanol saturated with dry HCl gas as reaction system. The reaction can be completed at room temperature, without heating. All of the compound 6 produced is directly crystallized out of the reaction system. Thus, the target compound can be obtained by filtration, and no more purification step is necessary. Consequently, it is a preferable method. Suitable reagents for this first reaction step (a) acetoacetic ester reagents bearing corresponding R1, R2 substitutents, for example, ethyl acetylacetate, ethyl propionylacetate, ethyl butyrylacetate, ?-trifloro-ethyl butyrylacetate, ethyl pentanoylacetate, ethyl 4-substituted-acetylacetate, ethyl 2-substituted-acetylacetate, ethyl 2-substituted- butyrylacetate, ethyl substituted-benzoylacetate containing ethyl benzylacetate, 2-oxo-cyclopentanoic acid ethyl ester, 2-oxo-cyclohexanoic acid ethyl ester, and so on. The molar ratio between the reagents and phloroglucinol ranges from 1:1to1:2, with a preferable ratio being 1:1; the amount of the solvent used in the medium can be an amount just sufficient to completely dissolvethe starting solid.<br>
The reagents used in the second reaction step b consist of various corresponding substituted ?, ?-unsaturated organic acid, such as crotonic acid, 3,3-dimethyl acroleic acid and the like, which is reacted with coumarin compound 6 to give tricyclic compound 5 with ring A, B and C. The molar ratio between ?, ?-unsaturated organic acid and compound 6 is 1 ? 1.5:  1, with a preferable range of 1 ? 1.2:  1 and a more preferable range of 1.05:  1. Using PPA as a catalyst, the reaction temperature is maintained at 50?C~100?C, preferable 90?C. The reaction time is 0.5-24h, preferable 1-10h, and more preferably 3-5h. The reaction conditions of b are expemplified in the CN1548439A, but the invention is not limited to those specific conditions.<br>
The reagents used in the third reaction step c consist of substituted propenal acetals with corresponding R5 and R6 groups, such as 1,1-diethoxyl-3-methyl-2-butene, 1,1-diethoxyl-2-butene, 1,1-diethoxyl-2-propene, etc. The acetals are reacted with tricylic compound (5a) to obtain the final product of tetracyclic coumarin compounds 4. The molar ratio between the tricyclic intermediate (5a) and 1,1-diethoxyl-3-methyl-2-butene is 2~6:1, preferably 3~5:1, and more preferably 4:1. The present invention found that the reaction is significantly accelerated by microwave irradiation, thus the reaction time is apparently shortened. The microwave power is set up at 50-300 watt, preferable 100-200 watt, and more preferably 150 watt. The reaction temperature is 80-200?C, preferable 100-150?C, and more preferably 120?C. The irradiation time is between 10-40 minutes, preferably 20 minutes. <br>
5. The present invention also relates to a novel synthesis method of compound (7). The characteristic of this method is that two hydroxyl groups of the compound (6) are protected by groups such as p-methylphenylsulfonyl group to give compound (8), and then the replacement of the C=O group with a C=S group by using a thionating reagent to obtain compound (9) as indicated in the reaction scheme 5.<br><br>
Reaction scheme 5<br><br>
The purpose of the first reaction step (d) is to protect both hydroxyl groups of compound (6) with some sulfonyl chlorides. The preferred protection reagents are methylsulfonyl chloride and paramethylphenylsulfonyl chloride; more preferably,  paramelthylphenylsulfonyl chloride. The reaction molar ratio between sulfonyl chloride and compound (6) is 4~10:1, preferably 5~8:1, and more preferably 6:1. <br>
The second reaction step e is carried out by employing thionating reagent such as P2S5 or Lawesson’s reagent. A preferred reagent is P2S5. The reaction molar ratio between P2S5 and compound (6) is 5~20: 1, preferably 8~15:1, and more preferably 10:1. Toluene and dimethyl benzene or other aromatic solvents are used as reaction solvent. A preferable solvent is dimethyl benzene. The reaction temperature is 60?C to the refluxing temperature of the solvent used. The refluxing temperature of the solvent is preferred. Reaction time depends on the specific reaction; generally, it is 9-21 hours, and preferably 12 hours.<br>
The purpose of the third reaction step f is to deprotect 5,7-ditosyl protective groups (phenolic hydroxyl group) of compound 9 by using tetrabutyl ammonium salts, such as tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride (TBAF), tetrabutyl ammonium chloride (TBAC), tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB). TBAF is preferred. The reaction molar ratio between TBAF and compound 9 may be selected depending on the specified case of the reaction. A preferred reaction molar ratio is about 2:1 and the reaction solvent is aprotic solvent with THF as a preferred solvent. The reaction temperature is from room temperature to the refluxing temperature of the solvent used. The refluxing temperature of the refluxing solvent used is preferred. The reaction time is 3~20 hours, preferably 6~15, and more preferably about 10 hours.<br>
Both reaction steps of b and c are as the same as the description above. <br>
In the preceding reaction scheme 5, a specific compound is used as example. Apparently, when the corresponding groups of R1-R6 are as defined  the same as mentioned above, the preceding synthetic objects can also be carried out.<br><br>
6. The present invention further provids a novel synthetic strategy of the compounds of general formula (4). The first protective group at the 7-position of the compound (8) is selectively deprotected to give 5-OH of compound (12). The ring D is then constructed. The second protective group is subsequently removed to give 9-OH of compound (14). The ring C is built lastly as indicated in reaction scheme 6.<br>
Reaction scheme 6<br>
 wherein R1-R8 are as defined above.<br>
The reaction step g is to deprotect one protective group of compound 8. The two groups can be selectively removed with different reaction conditions. At room temperature, the protective group at the 5-position is deprotected in priority by using the reagent, solvent and reaction time referred to the reaction step f of synthetic scheme 5.<br>
The second reaction step c is as the same as the previous description.<br>
The third reaction step f is as the same as the previous description and its reaction temperature is the refluxing temperature of the solvent used.<br>
The forth reaction step h utilizes acyl halide of ?-?-unsaturated acid, such as acyl chloride of ?-?-unsaturated acid. The molar ratio between the acyl chloride and compound (14) is 1~6:1, and preferably 4:1. Lewis acid is used as catalyst and BF3/ethyl ether solution is preferable. The reaction temperature is room temperature to the refluxing temperature of the solvent used, and is preferably the refluxing temperature of the solvent used. The reaction time is 1-4 hours, preferably 2 hours.<br>
In addition, when R3 is bromomethyl group, it can be reacted with primary or secondary amines in THF at room temperature. The reaction molar ratio between amine and the corresponding bromide is 2:1. The reaction time is about 12 hours. As shown in the following reaction scheme, it illustrates that, when the reagent is a secondary amine, the reaction gives compound 15 accordingly. When the reagent is a primary amine, the structure of tricyclic ring A, B, D is unchanged and ring C happens to be opened by a rearrangement reaction to give the compound 16 and a byproduct 17, which has a 3-member saturated cyclic ring formed by R3 at position C10 and R4 at position C11, together with the carbon atom to which they are attached.<br><br><br><br>
Y comes from various primary amines having substituted groups, such as C1-10 aliphatic chains, various  aromatic or non-aromantic rings as well as heterocyclic rings. Each of Z1 and Z2 is halogen, cyano, hydroxyl, azido, benzene substituted by amino, C1-10 aliphatic chain or C1-6 alkyl, amide substituted by aryl, sulfonyl amide, ureido, thioureido and guanidino group and so on.<br>
Because of all of the reactions mentioned above possess the characteristic of the rather mild reaction conditions, the shorten reaction time and the stable yield, the synthesis procedure in this invention is compatible with the synthesis of the chemical library by employing combinatorial method. Therefore, the procedure for synthesizing chemical library is also included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
It is believed that one skilled in the art can modify the preceding procedure in order to improve the yield. They also can use the conventional knowledge in the art to confirm synthetic route or scheme or procedure for example, selection of the reactants, solvents and temperatures of the reaction. This modifications or variations are included in the scope of the present invention. It also can use a different conventional procedure in order to avoid some side reaction and/or improve the yield of product. This method of conventional protective groups can see for example “T. Greene,Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis” (the Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.)<br>
