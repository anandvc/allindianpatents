Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of beta-lactam antibiotics, which have wide range of anti-bacterial activity. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics of the formula (I) as sulphate salt.<br><br>
wherein R1 represents CH3, CRaRbCOORc where Ra and Rb independently represent hydrogen or methyl and R6 represents hydrogen or (C1-C6)alkyl; R2 is carboxylate ion or COOR^, where Rd represents a counter ion which forms a salt; R3 represents,<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cefquinome and Cefpirome are the important antibiotics and are administered as their sulphate salt. There are several literature evidence reports the preparation of the said compound. All of them involve isolation of these compounds as HC1 or HI salt followed by converting the salt into sulphate salt<br><br>
using Amberlite LA-2 resin. None of them provide a direct isolation of these compounds as sulphate salt.<br>
US patent Nos. 4,767,852 and 5,003,073 discloses a process for the production of cephalosporin derivatives by acylating 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic   acid  with  2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl-(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-<br><br>
using solvents such as chlorinated hydrocarbon, or ethers such as ethyl acetate or in a mixture of such solvent with water. US patent 5,003,073 discloses and claims the compound of formula (II) and its use in the preparation of different cephalosporin derivatives.<br>
US patent 4,845,087 discloses a process for preparing cefquinome acid addition salts after isolating the inner salt. Preparation of inner salt is carried out by condensing MAEM with different moieties in presence of DMF/water,and the obtained inner salt is further converted into its sulfate salt with Amberlite LA-2, followed by sulfuric acid.<br>
US patent number 4,667,028 discloses and claims a process for the preparation of the different cephalosporin derivatives by the condensation of 2-Mercaptobenzothiazolyl-(Z)-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl]-2-methoxyiminoacetate or its activated derivative with different cephem moieties in the presence of a base and<br><br>
tri-Cl-C4-alkyl-iodosilane. According to this patent the final product is isolated as iodide or hydrochloride salt which is further converted into sulfate salt.<br>
So far the reported prior art process that are widely reported for the preparation of the title compound involve preparation of intermediary salts like hydrochloride or iodide to achieve purity. These salts are further converted into sulphate salt using resins like Amberlite LA-2 (J.Antibiotics. (1988), 41(10), 1374-94). All the above procedures involve cumbersome processes like washing (several times) with resin to achieve quality. So there exists a need to develop an industrially viable process, which does not involve the use of resins and its recovery.<br>
During the course of our research, we have made a lot of efforts to develop an easily scalable and commercially viable process for the preparation of cephalosporins. Unexpectedly it was observed that, this condensation and salification could be achieved in a single step. This invention is cost effective, high yielding and easy to scale up with very less unit operations.<br><br>
The primary objective of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics of the general formula (I) as sulphate salt, which is simple, high yielding and cost effective.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to produce cephalosporin antibiotics that are highly pure industrially.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to produce sulphate salt of cephalosporin antibiotics, directly without isolating any intermediary compounds like inner salt or any other acid addition salts like hydrochloride, hydroiodide etc.,<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to replace usage of resins such as Amberlite LA-2<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to produce sulfate salts of cephalosporins antibiotics selected from Cefquinome, Cefpirome and Ceftazidime.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics of the formula (I) as sulphate salt<br><br>
wherein R1 represents CH3, CRaRbCOORc where Ra and Rb independently represent hydrogen or methyl and Rc represents hydrogen or (C1-C6)alkyl; R2 is carboxylate ion or COORd, where Rd represents a counter ion which forms a salt and R3 represents<br><br><br>
(i) <br>
wherein R is a group which forms a basis that a compound of formula (III) is in a reactive form ; including halogen, or a group which forms together with the -C=0 group to which R is attached as an active ester, and a group which forms together with the -C=0 group to which R is attached as mixed anhydride and R1 are as defined above, with 7-amino cephem derivative of the formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein R2 and   R3    are as defined above, and R4 represents hydrogen or<br>
trimethylsilyl, with or without base in the presence of organic solvent at a<br>
temperature in the range of-50 °C to +60 °C,<br>

Alternatively the compound of formula (IV) is employed in free or its silylated reactive derivative. The silylated<br><br>
derivative of formula (IV) is prepared using silylating agent like<br>
iodotrimethylsilane (TMIS), N,0-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoracetamide (BSTFA),<br>
N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoracetamide	(MSTFA);	1,1,3,3,3-<br>

The resultant solution was stirred at 5° C till completion of reaction. After completion of reaction the product was extracted with water. The aqueous layer was subjected to carbon treatment and to filtrate IP A was added to isolate the product. The solid filter washed with water to yield Cefpirome HC1.<br><br><br>

The clear solution was washed five times with 20% Amberlite LA-2 in ethyl acetate (1000 ml) solution (during washing acetic acid was added to mass). After washing the aqueous layer pH was aqueous layer was adjusted to 1.5 using 30% sulphuric acid and excess acetone was to precipitate the product.
