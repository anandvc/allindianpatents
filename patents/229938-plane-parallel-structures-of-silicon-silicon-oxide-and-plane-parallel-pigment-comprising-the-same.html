■PUUH^I—^1 i n|| nullirr-n of fiilirrnn/Eiilicon Oxide<br>
The present invention relates to plane-parallel structures of silicon/silicon oxide (silicon/silicon oxide flakes), obtainable by heating plane-parallel structures of SiOyin an oxygen-free atmosphere at a temperature above 400 °C, wherein 0.70 
In a first aspect the present invention relates to plane-parallel structures of silicon/silicon oxide.<br>
The particles of the plane-parallel structures of silicon/silicon oxide generally have a length of from 1 urn to 5 mm, a width of from 1 u.m to 2 mm, and a thickness of from 20 nm to 2 \xm, and a ratio of length to thickness of at least 2:1, the silicon/silicon oxide particles having two substantially parallel faces, the distance between which is the shortest axis of the core.<br>
The flakes of the present invention are not of a uniform shape. Nevertheless, for purposes of brevity, the flakes will be referred to as having a "diameter." The silicon/silicon oxide flakes have a high plane-parallelism and a defined thickness in the range of ± 10 %, especially ± 5 % of the average thickness. The silicon/silicon oxide flakes have a thickness of from 20 to 2000 nm, especially from 100 to 350 nm. It is presently preferred that the diameter of the flakes be in a preferred range of about 1-60 u,m with a more preferred range of about 5-40 urn. Thus, the aspect ratio of the flakes of the present invention is in a preferred range of about 2.5 to 625 with a more preferred range of about 50 to 250.<br>
The term "SiOy with 0.70 
The term "SiOx with 0.03 
*<br><br>
The term "silicon/silicon oxide layer or flakes" comprises plane-parallel structures obtainable by heating plane-parallel structures of SiOy or SiOx in an oxygen-free atmosphere at a temperature above 400 °C and optionally an oxidative heat treatment.<br>
According to the present invention the term "aluminum" comprises aluminum and alloys of aluminum. Alloys of aluminum are, for example described in G. Wassermann in Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der Industriellen Chemie, 4. Auflage, Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Band 7, S. 281 to 292. Especially suitable are the corrosion stable aluminum alloys described on page 10 to 12 of WO00/12634, which comprise besides of aluminum silicon, magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc, nickel, vanadium, lead, antimony, tin, cadmium, bismuth, titanium, Chromium and/or iron in amounts of less than 20 % by weight, preferably less than 10 % by weight.<br>
The present invention is illustrated in more detail on the basis of the "SiOy flakes", but is not limited thereto.<br>
The silicon/silicon oxide flakes are prepared by a process comprising the steps:<br>
a)	vapour-deposition of a separating agent onto a (movable) carrier to produce a separating agent layer,<br>
b)	vapour-deposition of an SiOy layer onto the separating agent layer, wherein 0.70 
c)	dissolution of the separating agent layer in a solvent,<br>
d)	separation of the SiOy from the solvent, and<br>
e)	heating the SiOy in an oxygen-free atmosphere to a temperature above 400°C.<br>
The SiOy layer in step b) being vapour-deposited from a vaporiser containing a charge comprising a mixture of Si and Si02, SiOy or a mixture thereof, the weight ratio of Si to Si02 being preferably in the range from 0.15:1 to 0.75:1, and especially containing a stoichiometric mixture of Si and S1O2 or a vaporiser containing a charge comprising silicon monoxide containing silicon in an amount up to 20 % by weight. Step c) being advantageously carried out at a pressure that is higher than the pressure in steps a) and b) and lower than atmospheric pressure. The SiOy flakes obtainable by this method have a thickness in the range preferably from 20 to 2000 nm, especially from 20 to 500 nm, the ratio of the thickness to the surface area of the plane-parallel structures being preferably less than 0.01 um"1. The plane-parallel structures thereby produced are distinguished by high uniformity of thickness.<br>
3<br><br>
The SiOtoo-1.8 layer in step b) is formed preferably from silicon monoxide vapour produced in the vaporiser by reaction of a mixture of Si and Si02 at temperatures of more than 1300°C.<br>
The SiOojo-0.99 layer in step b) is formed preferably by evaporating silicon monoxide containing silicon in an amount up to 20 % by weight at temperatures of more than 1300°C.<br>
If, under industrial vacuums of a few 10"2 Pa, Si is vaporised (instead of Si/Si02 or SiO/Si) silicon oxides can be obtained which have an oxygen content of less than 0.95, that is to say SiOx, wherein 0.03 <x especially very></x>
The vapour-deposition in steps a) and b) is carried out preferably under a vacuum of 
The separating agent vapour-deposited onto the carrier in step a) may be a lacquer (surface coating), a polymer, such as, for example, the (thermoplastic) polymers, in particular acryl- or styrene polymers or mixtures thereof, as described in US-B-6,398,999, an organic substance soluble in organic solvents or water and vaporisable in vacuo, such as anthracene, anthraquinone, acetamidophenol, acetylsalicylic acid, camphoric anhydride, benzimidazole, benzene-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid, biphenyl-2,2-dicarboxylic acid, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone, dihydroxyanthraquinone, hydantoin, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid monohydrate, 4-hydroxycoumarin, 7-hydroxycoumarin, 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, isophthalic acid, 4,4-methylene-bis-3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic anhydride, phthalimide and its potassium salt, phenolphthalein, phenothiazine, saccharin and its salts, tetraphenylmethane, triphenylene, triphenylmethanol or a mixture of at least two of those substances. The separating agent is preferably an inorganic salt soluble in water and vaporisable in vacuo (see, for example, DE 198 44 357), such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, lithium chloride, sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, lithium fluoride, calcium fluoride, sodium aluminium fluoride and disodium tetraborate.<br>
The movable carrier may consist of one or more discs, cylinders or other rotationally symmetrical bodies, which rotate about an axis (cf. WO01/25500), and consists preferably of<br>
k<br><br>
one or more continuous metal belts with or without a polymeric coating or of one or more polyimide or polyethylene terephthalate belts (DE19844357).<br>
Step d) may comprise washing-out and subsequent filtration, sedimentation, centrifugation, i decanting and/or evaporation. The plane-parallel structures of SiOy may, however, also be frozen together with the solvent in step d) and subsequently subjected to a process of freeze-drying, whereupon the solvent is separated off as a result of sublimation below the triple point and the dry SiOy remains behind in the form of individual plane-parallel structures.<br>
The plane-parallel structures of SiOy separated off in step d) are then heated in an oxygen-free atmosphere such as, for example, argon and/or helium or under a vacuum of less than 13 Pa (10'1 Torr) at a temperature of at least 400°C, especially at above 400°C, preferably in the form of loose material, in a fluidised bed, preferably at a temperature in the range from 900 to 1100°C, to form the silicon/silicon oxide flakes.<br>
The invention relates also to plane-parallel structures of silicon/silicon oxide that are obtainable by this method and have a thickness preferably in the range from 20 to 2000 nm, especially 20 to 500 nm.<br>
Except under an ultra-high vacuum, in technical vacuums of a few 10"2 Pa vaporised SiO always condenses as SiOy wherein 1 
On its further course, the belt-form carrier, which is closed to form a loop, runs through dynamic vacuum lock chambers of known mode of construction (cf. US 6 270 840) into a region of from 1 to 5 x 104 Pa pressure, preferably from 600 to 104 Pa pressure, and especially from 103 to 5 x 103 Pa pressure, where it is immersed in a dissolution bath. The temperature of the solvent should be so selected that its vapour pressure is in the indicated pressure range. With mechanical assistance, the separating agent layer rapidly dissolves and the product layer breaks up into flakes, which are then present in the solvent in the form of a suspension. On its further course, the belt is dried and freed from any contaminants still adhering to it. It runs through a second group of dynamic vacuum lock chambers back into the vaporisation chamber, where the process of coating with separating agent and product layer of SiO is repeated.<br>
r<br><br>
The suspension then present in both cases, comprising product structures and solvent, and the separating agent dissolved therein, is then separated in a further operation in accordance with a known technique. For that purpose, the product structures are first concentrated in the liquid and rinsed several times with fresh solvent in order to wash out the dissolved separating agent. The product, in the form of a solid that is still wet, is then separated off by filtration, sedimentation, centrifugation, decanting or evaporation.<br>
The product can then be brought to the desired particle size by means of grinding or air-sieving and delivered for further use.<br>
In the production of the silicon/silicon oxide flakes, variants are possible:<br>
It is possible to arrange several separating agent and product vaporisers one after the other in the running direction of the belt in the vaporisation zone. By that means there is obtained, with little additional outlay in terms of apparatus, a layer sequence of S + P + S + P, wherein S is the separating agent layer and P is the product layer. If the number of vaporisers is doubled and the belt speed is the same, twice the amount of product is obtained.<br>
Separating off the plane-parallel structures after washing-out at atmospheric pressure can be carried out under gentle conditions by freezing the suspension, which has been concentrated to a solids content of about 50 %, and subjecting it in known manner to freeze-drying at about -10°C and 50 Pa pressure. The dry substance remains behind as product, which can be subjected to the steps of further processing by means of coating or chemical conversion.<br>
Instead of using a continuous belt, it is possible to produce the product by carrying out the steps of vapour-deposition of separating agent and SiO, of dissolution, and of drying the carrier, in an apparatus having a rotary body, in accordance with WO01/25500. The rotary body may be one or more discs, a cylinder or any other rotationally symmetrical body.<br>
It should be noted that the silicon/silicon oxide flakes themselves show no colors when embedded in a transparent resin, which has an index of refraction ranging from 1.4 to 1.55. In such a case the embedded semi-transparent flakes act as UV absorber.<br>
It is assumed that by heating SiOy particles (or SiOx particles) in an oxygen-free atmosphere, i.e. an argon or helium atmosphere or in a vacuum of less than 13 Pa (10'1 Torr), at a temperature above 400 °C, especially 400 to 1100°C, SiOy disproportionates in Si02 and Si.<br>
6<br><br>
SiOy -&gt; (y/y+a) SiOy+a + (1 - (y/y+a)) Si<br>
In this disproportion SiOy+a flakes are formed, containing (1 - (y/y+a)) Si, wherein 0.70 
SiOy -* (y/2) Si02 + (1 - (y/2)) Si<br>
In the temperature range of from 400 to 900°C the formed silicon is amorph. In the temperature range of from 900 to 1100 °C silicon crystallites are formed. The average crystallite size is in the range of from 1 to 20 nm, especially 2 to 10 nm. The size is on the one hand dependent on the temperature. That is, at 1100 °C larger crystallites than at 900 °C are formed. On the other hand a clear tendency for the formation of smaller crystallites is found, the higher the oxygen level of the SiOy is. Depending on the preparation the Si containing, plane-parallel SiOy+a particles, especially Si02 particles can show photoluminescence. For example, plane-parallel structures of SiO0.86 (see example 2), which have been heated in vacuo at 900°C for at least 1 hour, show photoluminescence at a wavelength greater than 800 nm, especially greater than 840 nm (excitation wavelength: -300 nm).<br>
Before the silicon/silicon oxide flakes are processed to interference pigments, they can be subjected to oxidative heat treatment. Known methods are available for that purpose. Air or some other oxygen-containing gas is passed through the silicon/silicon oxide flakes, which are in the form of loose material or in a fluidised bed, at a temperature of more than 200°C, preferably more than 400°C and especially from 500 to 1000°C for several hours.<br>
In order to achieve orientation of the plane-parallel structures of silicon/silicon oxide approximately parallel to the surface of the surface coating layer(s), the surface tension of the structures can be modified by adding known chemicals to the surface coating, for example by means of commercially available silane oligomers. Such oligomers, known under the trade names DYNASILAN™, HYDROSIL™, PROTECTOSIL™ can also be deposited directly onto the surface of the plane-parallel structures, either from a liquid phase or by condensation, before the latter are introduced into the surface coating.<br>
1<br><br>
in contrast to silicon oxide flakes, which are white to slightly yellowish, SiOy flakes, which have been heated at 900°C under a vacuum of less than 10"1 Torr for about one hour (silicon/silicon oxide flakes), become colored in air and are semi-transparent. The observed color depends on the thickness of the flakes and changes in dependence of the observation angle. For particular applications such as cosmetics the silicon/silicon oxide flakes can be used as such, whereas for paint applications the silicon/silicon oxide flakes have to be provided with further layers, such as, for example, one or more metal oxide and/or metal layers, wherein in case of the metal oxide a metal oxide layer having a high index of refraction is advantageously deposited first. It being possible, where appropriate, for the metal oxides to be reduced (DE-A-19502231, WO97/39065, DE-A-19843014 and WO00/17277).<br>

Various coating processes can be utilized in forming coating layers. Suitable methods for forming the coating layer include vacuum vapor deposition, sol-gel hydrolysis, CVD in a fluidized bed (US-A-5,364,467 and US-A-5,763,086), and electrochemical deposition.

earbonyls in the presence of water vapour (relatively low molecular weight metal oxides such as magnetite) or in the presence of oxygen and, where appropriate, water vapour (e.g. nickel oxide and cobalt oxide). The metal oxide layers are especially applied by means of oxidative gaseous phase decomposition of metal earbonyls (e.g. iron pentacarbonyl, chromium hexacarbonyl; EP-A-45 851), by means of hydrolytic gaseous phase decomposition of metal alcoholates (e.g. titanium and zirconium tetra-n- and -iso-propanolate; DE-A-41 40 900) or of metal halides (e.g. titanium tetrachloride; EP-A-338 428), by means of oxidative decomposition of organyl tin compounds (especially alkyl tin compounds such as tetrabutyltin and tetramethyltin; DE-A-44 03 678) or by means of the gaseous phase hydrolysis of organyl silicon compounds (especially di-tert-butoxyacetoxysilane) described in EP-A-668 329, it being possible for the coating operation to be carried out in a fluidised-bed reactor (EP-A-045 851 and EP-A-106 235).

Phosphate-, chromate- and/or vanadate-containing and also phosphate- and Si02-containing metal oxide layers can be applied in accordance with the passivation methods described in DE-A-42 36 332 and in EP-A-678 561 by means of hydrolytic or oxidative gaseous phase decomposition of oxide-halides of the metals (e.g. Cr02CI2, VOCI3), especially of phosphorus oxyhalides (e.g. POCI3), phosphoric and phosphorous acid esters (e.g. di- and tri-methyl and di- and tri-ethyl phosphite) and of amino-group-containing organyl silicon compounds (e.g. 3-aminopropyl-triethoxy- and -trimethoxy-silane).<br>
Layers of oxides of the metals zirconium, titanium, iron and zinc, oxide hydrates of those metals, iron titanates, titanium suboxides or mixtures thereof are preferably applied by precipitation by a wet chemical method, it being possible, where appropriate, for the metal oxides to be reduced. In the case of the wet chemical coating, the wet chemical coating methods developed for the production of pearlescent pigments may be used; these are described, for example, in DE-A-14 67 468, DE-A-19 59 988, DE-A-20 09 566, DE-A-22 14 545, DE-A-22 15 191, DE-A-22 44 298, DE-A-23 13 331, DE-A-25 22 572, DE-A-31 37 808, DE-A-31 37 809, DE-A-31 51 343, DE-A-31 51 354, DE-A-31 51 355, DE-A-32 11 602 and DE-A-32 35 017, DE 195 99 88, WO 93/08237, and WO 98/53001.<br>
For the purpose of coating, the substrate particles are suspended in water and one or more hydrolysable metal salts are added at a pH suitable for the hydrolysis, which is so selected that the metal oxides or metal oxide hydrates are precipitated directly onto the particles<br>
I!<br><br>
without subsidiary precipitation occurring. The pH is usually kept constant by simultaneously metering in a base. The pigments are then separated off, washed, dried and, where appropriate, baked, it being possible to optimise the baking temperature with respect to the coating in question. If desired, after individual coatings have been applied, the pigments can be separated off, dried and, where appropriate, baked, and then again re-suspended for the purpose of precipitating further layers.<br>
The metal oxide layers are obtainable, for example, in analogy to a method described in DE-A-195 01 307, by producing the metal oxide layer by controlled hydrolysis of one or more metal acid esters, where appropriate in the presence of an organic solvent and a basic catalyst, by means of a sol-gel process. Suitable basic catalysts are, for example, amines, such as triethylamine, ethylenediamine, tributylamine, dimethylethanolamine and methoxy-propylamine. The organic solvent is a water-miscible organic solvent such as a C^alcohol, especially isopropanol.<br>
Suitable metal acid esters are selected from alkyl and aryl alcoholates, carboxylates, and carboxyl-radical- or alkyl-radical- or aryl-radical-substituted alkyl alcoholates or carboxylates of vanadium, titanium, zirconium, silicon, aluminium and boron. The use of triisopropyl aluminate, tetraisopropyl titanate, tetraisopropyl zirconate, tetraethyl orthosilicate and triethyl borate is preferred. In addition, acetylacetonates and acetoacetylacetonates of the afore¬mentioned metals may be used. Preferred examples of that type of metal acid ester are zirconium acetylacetonate, aluminium acetylacetonate, titanium acetylacetonate and diisobutyloleyl acetoacetylaluminate or diisopropyloleyl acetoacetylacetonate and mixtures of metal acid esters, for example Dynasil® (Huls), a mixed aluminium/silicon metal acid ester.<br>
As a metal oxide having a high refractive index, titanium dioxide is preferably used, the method described in US-A-3 553 001 being used, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, for application of the titanium dioxide layers.<br>
An aqueous titanium salt solution is slowly added to a suspension of the material being coated, which suspension has been heated to about 50-100CC, especially 70-80°C, and a substantially constant pH value of about from 0.5 to 5, especially about from 1.2 to 2.5, is maintained by simultaneously metering in a base such as, for example, aqueous ammonia solution or aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution. As soon as the desired layer thickness of precipitated Ti02 has been achieved, the addition of titanium salt solution and base is stopped.<br>
\b<br><br>
This method, also referred to as a titration method, is distinguished by the fact that an excess of titanium salt is avoided. That is achieved by feeding in for hydrolysis, per unit time, only that amount which is necessary for even coating with the hydrated Ti02 and which can be taken up per unit time by the available surface of the particles being coated. In principle, the anatase form of Ti02 forms on the surface of the starting pigment. By adding small amounts of Sn02, however, it is possible to force the rutile structure to be formed. For example, as described in WO 93/08237, tin dioxide can be deposited before titanium dioxide precipitation and the product coated with titanium dioxide can be calcined at from 800 to 900°C.<br>
Where appropriate, an Si02 protective layer can be applied on top of the titanium dioxide layer, for which the following method may be used: A soda waterglass solution is metered in to a suspension of the material being coated, which suspension has been heated to about 50-100°C, especially 70-80°C. The pH is maintained at from 4 to 10, preferably from 6.5 to 8.5, by simultaneously adding 10% hydrochloric acid. After addition of the waterglass solution, stirring is carried out for 30 minutes.<br>
It is possible to obtain pigments that are more intense in colour and more transparent by applying, on top of the Ti02 layer, a metal oxide of "low" refractive index, that is to say a refractive index smaller than about 1.65, such as Si02, Al203, AlOOH, B203 or a mixture thereof, preferably Si02, and applying a further Fe203 and/or Ti02 layer on top of the latter layer. Such multi-coated interference pigments comprising a silicon/silicon oxide substrate and alternating metal oxide layers of with high and low refractive index can be prepared in analogy to the processes described in WO98/53011 and WO99/20695.<br>
It is, in addition, possible to modify the powder colour of the pigment by applying further layers such as, for example, coloured metal oxides or Berlin Blue, compounds of transition metals, e.g. Fe, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, or organic compounds such as dyes or colour lakes.<br>
i It is furthermore possible to subject the finished pigment to subsequent coating or subsequent treatment which further increases the light, weather and chemical stability or which facilitates handling of the pigment, especially its incorporation into various media. For example, the procedures described in DE-A-22 15 191, DE-A-31 51 354, DE-A-32 35 017 or DE-A-33 34 598 are suitable as subsequent treatment or subsequent coating.<br>
|3<br><br>
In addition, the pigment according to the invention can also be coated with poorly soluble, firmly adhering, inorganic or organic colourants. Preference is given to the use of colour lakes and, especially, aluminium colour lakes. For that purpose an aluminium hydroxide layer is precipitated, which is, in a second step, laked by using a colour lake (DE-A-24 29 762 and DE 29 28 287).<br>
Furthermore, the pigment according to the invention may also have an additional coating with complex salt pigments, especially cyanoferrate complexes (EP-A-141 173 and DE-A-23 13 332).<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the pigment comprises in this order:<br>
(a1) a silicon/silicon oxide layer obtainable by heating a SiOx layer, especially a SiOy layer in<br>
an oxygen-free atmosphere at a temperature above 400 °C,<br>
(b1) a reflective layer, especially a metal layer, and<br>
(d) a silicon/silicon oxide layer obtainable by heating a SiOx layer, especially a SiOy layer in<br>
an oxygen-free atmosphere at a temperature above 400 "C, wherein 0.70 sy^ 1.8 and<br>
optionally further layers.<br>
The pigments obtainable by heating SiOy/reflective material/SiOy particles and comprising<br>
layers (a1), (b1) and (d) are prepared by a process comprising the steps:<br>
a) vapour-deposition of a separating agent onto a movable carrier to produce a separating<br>
agent layer,<br>
b1) vapour-deposition of an SiOy layer onto the separating agent layer, wherein 0.70 sys<br>
1.8, preferably wherein 0.70 
b2) vapour-deposition of a reflective material, especially aluminium, onto the layer obtained<br>
in step (b1),<br>
b3) vapour-deposition of an SiOy layer onto the metal layer,<br>
c)	dissolution of the separating agent layer in a solvent,<br>
d)	separation of the SiOy/reflective material/SiOy particles from the solvent, and<br>
e)	heating the SiOy/reflective material/SiOy particles in an oxygen-free atmosphere to a<br>
temperature above 400°C.<br>
If step (b3) is omitted, unsymmetrical pigments comprising layers (a1) and (b1) are obtained.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the above pigment comprises a further layer of a dielectric material having a "high" refractive index, that is to say a refractive index greater than about<br>
i*<br><br>
1.65, which is applied to the entire surface of the (silicon/silicon oxide)/reflective material/ (silicon/silicon oxide) substrate (see above). The dielectric material is preferably a metal oxide, it being possible for the metal oxide to be a single oxide or a mixture of oxides, with or without absorbing properties, for example CeC^, Ti02, Zr02, Fe203) Fe304, Cr203 or ZnO, with Ce02, Ti02, and Zr02 being especially preferred.<br>
The reflective layer consists preferably of a metallic reflecting material, especially Ag, Al, Au, Cu, Cr, Ge, Mo, Ni, Si, Ti, the alloys thereof, graphite, Fe203 or MoS2, particularly preferably Al or MoS2. If Al forms the reflective layer and the reflective layer should be retained, temperatures above 600 °C should be avoided to prevent reaction of the Al with silicon and/or silicon oxide contained in the neighbouring layers. If Al forms the reflective layer and the flakes are heated to temperatures above 600 °C, the Al reacts with silicon and/or silicon oxide contained in the neighbouring layers and the reflective layer is converted into a transparent aluminum silicate layer.<br>
If Al is used as metal of layer (b1), the thickness of layer (b1) is generally 20 to 100 nm, especially 40 to 60 nm. The Al is evaporated at temperatures of more than 1000°C.<br>
The thickness of layers (a1) and (d) is generally 2 to 500 nm, especially 50 to 300 nm.<br>
In addition, after heat-treatment in an oxygen-free atmosphere, the flakes can be subjected to oxidative heat treatment in air or some other oxygen-containing gas at a temperature of more than 200°C, preferably more than 400°C and especially from 500 to 1000°C.<br>
It is furthermore possible to convert plane-parallel structures of silicon/silicon oxide, starting from their surface, partially to silicon carbide (SiC) (in the context of the present Application, this procedure shall be referred to as "carburisation"; see PCT/EP03/01323). This processing step results in modified chemical and mechanical properties.<br>
After partial conversion to SiC, the surface of the plane-parallel structures is distinguished, in comparison to silicon oxide, by greater hardness, reduced electrical insulation properties and reflection in the infra-red of up to 80 % as opposed to reflection of 8 % in the case of Si02 structures. In accordance with the invention, the conversion is carried out on all sides, that is to say even at the side edges of the structures. Such a conversion makes use of the fact that silicon oxide reacts at elevated temperature in the presence of carbon-containing gases to<br>
ir<br><br>
form SiC. The plane-parallel structures obtained by such means are novel and the present invention relates also thereto.<br>
Consequently, the present invention relates also to plane-parallel structures (pigments) based on plane-parallel silicon/silicon oxide substrates having on their surface a layer comprising silicon carbide (SiC). The SiCyto-SiC reaction takes place starting from the surface of the plane-parallel structures and accordingly results in a gradient rather than a sharp transition. This means that, in that embodiment, the SiC-containing layer consists of (silicon/silicon oxide)a and (SiC)b, wherein 0 
For that purpose, the SiOy flakes, after they have been heated in an oxygen-free atmosphere, preferably Argon, at a temperature above 400°C, especially above 900 °C, are caused to react in a gas-tight reactor heatable to a maximum of about 1500°C, preferably in the form of loose material, with a carbon-containing gas selected from alkynes, for example acetylene, alkanes, for example methane, alkenes, aromatic compounds or the like, and mixtures thereof optionally in admixture with an oxygen containing compound, such as, for example, aldehydes, ketones, water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide or the like, or mixtures thereof, at from 500 to 1500°C, preferably from 500 to 1000°C, and advantageously with the exclusion of oxygen. In order to temper the reaction, an inert gas, for example argon or helium, may be admixed with the carbon-containing gas.<br>
At temperatures of less than about 500°C, that reaction generally proceeds too slowly whereas temperatures of more than about 1500°C necessitate expensive lining of the reaction vessel with inert materials such as SiC, carbon, graphite or composite materials thereof. At pressures of less than about 1 Pa the reaction generally also proceeds too slowly whereas, especially when the carbon-containing gases are less reactive or are highly diluted with inert gas, it is perfectly possible to operate at pressures of up to about 4000 bar, as are routinely used, for example, in HIP ("hot isostatic pressing") systems.<br>
In such carburisation, it is possible for all of the SiOy to be reacted to form SiC; preferably from 5 to 90 % by weight of the SiOy are reacted to form SiC.<br>
After carbide formation has been terminated, it is possible, optionally, for residual silicon oxide still present in the plane-parallel structures to be converted into Si02 by oxidation with<br>
i«&gt;<br><br>
/ an oxygen-containing gas, without destroying the SiC formed. Because of the large specific<br>
surface area of the plane-parallel structures, temperatures of about 400°C should not, in this<br>
case, be exceeded in the presence of oxygen. The thickness of the structures produced in<br>
accordance with the invention is from 20 to 2000 nm, preferably, from 20 to 500 nm for most<br>
applications. Complete conversion of SiC into Si02 would be the consequence if an<br>
excessively high oxidation temperature were to be used.<br>
The present invention relates furthermore to novel (plane-parallel) pigments based on SiOz substrates in platelet form having, on the surface of the Si02 substrates, wherein 0.95 
The pigment particles generally have a length of from 1 nm to 5 mm, a width of from 1 jxm to 2 mm, and a thickness of from 20 nm to 1.5 nm, and a ratio of length to thickness of at least 2:1, the particles having a core of SiOz having two substantially parallel faces, the distance between which is the shortest axis of the core, and having an SiC-containing layer applied to the entire surface of the core and, optionally, further layers. In a preferred embodiment, the pigment comprises a further layer of a dielectric material having a "high" refractive index, that is to say a refractive index greater than about 1.65, which is applied to the entire surface of the SiC/silicon/silicon oxide substrate (see above). The dielectric material is preferably a metal oxide, it being possible for the metal oxide to be a single oxide or a mixture of oxides, with or without absorbing properties, for example Ce02, Ti02, Zr02l Fe203, Fe304l Cr203 or ZnO, with Ce02, Ti02, and Zr02 being especially preferred.<br>
In this embodiment the thickness of the SiC/ (silicon/silicon oxide) flakes is generally from 20 to 1000 nm, preferably from 20 to 500 nm, and that of the Ti02 layer generally from 1 to 100 nm, preferably from 5 to 50 nm.<br>
Instead of a layer of a metal oxide having a high index of refraction US-B-6,524,381 materials, such as diamond-like carbon and amorphous carbon, can be deposited by plasma-assisted vacuum methods (using vibrating conveyors, rotating drum coaters, oscillatory drum coaters, and free-fall chambers) as described, for example in US-B-6,524,381, on the silicon/silicon oxide substrates.<br>
11<br><br>
Consequently, the present invention also relates to plane-parallel structures (pigments) based on plane-parallel silicon/silicon oxide substrates having on their surface a carbon layer especially a diamond-like carbon layer having a thickness of 10 to 150 nm.<br>
In the method described, for example, in US-B-6,015,597, diamond-like network (DLN) coatings are deposited onto particles from carbon-containing gases, such as, for example, acetylene, methane, butadiene and mixtures of these and optionally Ar, and optionally gases containing additional components by plasma deposition. Deposition occurs at reduced pressures (relative to atmospheric pressure) and in a controlled environment. A carbon rich plasma is created in a reaction chamber by applying an electric field to a carbon-containing gas. Particles to be coated are held in a vessel or container in the reactor and are agitated while in proximity to the plasma. Species within the plasma react on the particle surface to form covalent bonds, resulting in DLN on the surface of the particles.<br>
The term "diamond-like network" (DLN) refers to amorphous films or coatings comprised of carbon and optionally comprising one or more additional components selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, silicon, sulfur, titanium, and copper. The diamond-like networks comprise approximately 30 to 100 atomic percent carbon, with optional additional components making up the remainder.<br>

The pigments according to the invention can be used for all customary purposes, for example for colouring polymers in the mass, surface coatings (including effect finishes, including those for the automotive sector) and printing inks, and also, for example, for applications in cosmetics. Such applications are known from reference works, for example "Industrielle Organische Pigmente" (W. Herbst and K.

When the pigments according to the invention are interference pigments (effect pigments), they are goniochromatic and result in brilliant, highly saturated (lustrous) colours. They are accordingly very especially suitable for combination with conventional, transparent pigments, for example organic pigments such as, for example, diketopyrrolopyrroles, quinacridones, dioxazines, perylenes, isoindolinones etc., it being possible for the transparent pigment to have a similar colour to the effect pigment. Especially interesting combination effects are obtained, however, in analogy to, for example, EP 388 932 or EP 402 943, when the colour of the transparent pigment and that of the effect pigment are complementary. The pigments according to the invention can be used with excellent results for pigmenting high molecular weight organic material.<br>
The high molecular weight organic material for the pigmenting of which the pigments or pigment compositions according to the invention may be used may be of natural or synthetic origin. High molecular weight organic materials usually have molecular weights of about from<br>
&amp;<br><br>
10J to 10° g/mol or even more. They may tfe, for example, natural resins, drying oils, rubber or casein, or natural substances derived therefrom, such as chlorinated rubber, oil-modified alkyd resins, viscose, cellulose ethers or esters, such as ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetobutyrate or nitrocellulose, but especially totally synthetic organic polymers (thermosetting plastics and thermoplastics), as are obtained by polymerisation, polycondensation or polyaddition. From the class of the polymerisation resins there may be mentioned, especially, polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene or polyisobutylene, and also substituted polyolefins, such as polymerisation products of vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, styrene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid esters, methacrylic acid esters or butadiene, and also copolymerisation products of the said monomers, such as especially ABS or EVA.<br>
From the series of the polyaddition resins and polycondensation resins there may be mentioned, for example, condensation products of formaldehyde with phenols, so-called phenoplasts, and condensation products of formaldehyde with urea, thiourea or melamine, so-called aminoplasts, and the polyesters used as surface-coating resins, either saturated, such as alkyd resins, or unsaturated, such as maleate resins; also linear polyesters and polyamides, polyurethanes or silicones.<br>
The said high molecular weight compounds may be present singly or in mixtures, in the form of plastic masses or melts. They may also be present in the form of their monomers or in the polymerised state in dissolved form as film-formers or binders for surface coatings or printing inks, such as, for example, boiled linseed oil, nitrocellulose, alkyd resins, melamine resins and urea-formaldehyde resins or acrylic resins.<br>
Depending on the intended purpose, it has proved advantageous to use the pigments or pigment compositions according to the invention as toners or in the form of preparations. Depending on the conditioning method or intended application, it may be advantageous to add certain amounts of texture-improving agents to the pigment before or after the conditioning process, provided that this has no adverse effect on use of the effect pigments for colouring high molecular weight organic materials, especially polyethylene. Suitable agents are, especially, fatty acids containing at least 18 carbon atoms, for example stearic or behenic acid, or amides or metal salts thereof, especially magnesium salts, and also plasticisers, waxes, resin acids, such as abietic acid, rosin soap, alkylphenols or aliphatic alcohols, such as stearyl alcohol, or aliphatic 1,2-dihydroxy compounds containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, such as 1,2-dodecanediol, and also modified colophonium maleate resins or fumaric acid colophonium resins. The texture-improving agents are added in amounts of preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, especially from 2 to 15 % by weight, based on the end product.<br>
-ty<br><br>
The pigments according to the invention can be added in any tinctorially effective amount to the high molecular weight organic material being pigmented. A pigmented substance composition comprising a high molecular weight organic material and from 0.01 to 80 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, based on the high molecular weight organic f material, of an pigment according to the invention is advantageous. Concentrations of from 1 to 20 % by weight, especially of about 10 % by weight, can often be used in practice. High concentrations, for example those above 30 % by weight, are usually in the form of concentrates ("masterbatches") which can be used as colorants for producing pigmented materials having a relatively low pigment content, the pigments according to the invention having an extraordinarily low viscosity in customary formulations so that they can still be processed well.<br>
For the purpose of pigmenting organic materials, the pigments according to the invention may be used singly. It is, however, also possible, in order to achieve different hues or colour effects, to add any desired amounts of other colour-imparting constituents, such as white, coloured, black or effect pigments, to the high molecular weight organic substances in addition to the effect pigments according to the invention. When coloured pigments are used in admixture with the effect pigments according to the invention, the total amount is preferably from 0.1 to 10 % by weight, based on the high molecular weight organic material. Especially high goniochromicity is provided by the preferred combination of an effect pigment according to the invention with a coloured pigment of another colour, especially of a complementary colour, with colorations made using the effect pigment and colorations made using the coloured pigment having, at a measurement angle of 10°, a difference in hue (AH*) of from 20 to 340, especially from 150 to 210.<br>
Preferably, the effect pigments according to the invention are combined with transparent coloured pigments, it being possible for the transparent coloured pigments to be present either in the same medium as the effect pigments according to the invention or in a neighbouring medium. An example of an arrangement in which the effect pigment and the coloured pigment are advantageously present in neighbouring media is a multi-layer effect surface coating.<br>
The pigmenting of high molecular weight organic substances with the pigments according to the invention is carried out, for example, by admixing such a pigment, where appropriate in the form of a masterbatch, with the substrates using roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatuses. The pigmented material is then brought into the desired final form using methods known per se, such as calendering, compression moulding, extrusion, coating, pouring or injection moulding. Any additives customary in the plastics industry, such as plasticisers, fillers or stabilisers, can be added to the polymer, in customary amounts, before<br>
JK<br><br>
or after incorporation of the pigment. In particular, in order to produce non-rigid shaped<br>
articles or to reduce their brittleness, it is desirable to add plasticisers, for example esters of<br>
phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid, to the high molecular weight compounds prior<br>
to shaping.<br>
For pigmenting surface coatings and printing inks, the high molecular weight organic<br>
materials and the pigments according to the invention, where appropriate together with<br>
customary additives such as, for example, fillers, other pigments, siccatives or plasticisers,<br>
are finely dispersed or dissolved in the same organic solvent or solvent mixture, it being<br>
possible for the individual components to be dissolved or dispersed separately or for a<br>
number of components to be dissolved or dispersed together, and only thereafter for all the<br>
components to be brought together.<br>
Dispersing an pigment according to the invention in the high molecular weight organic<br>
material being pigmented, and processing a pigment composition according to the invention,<br>
are preferably carried out subject to conditions under which only relatively weak shear forces<br>
occur so that the effect pigment is not broken up into smaller portions.<br>
The colorations obtained, for example in plastics, surface coatings or printing inks, especially<br>
in surface coatings or printing inks, more especially in surface coatings, are distinguished by<br>
excellent properties, especially by extremely high saturation, outstanding fastness properties<br>
and high goniochromicity.<br>
When the high molecular weight material being pigmented is a surface coating, it is<br>
especially a speciality surface coating, very especially an automotive finish.<br>
The pigments according to the invention are also suitable for making-up the lips or the skin<br>
and for colouring the hair or the nails.<br>
The invention accordingly relates also to a cosmetic preparation or formulation comprising<br>
from 0.0001 to 90 % by weight of the silicon/silicon oxide flakes and/or of a pigment<br>
according to the invention and from 10 to 99.9999% of a cosmetically suitable carrier<br>
material, based on the total weight of the cosmetic preparation or formulation.<br>
Such cosmetic preparations or formulations are, for example, lipsticks, blushers, foundations,<br>
nail varnishes and hair shampoos.<br>
The pigments may be used singly or in the form of mixtures. It is, in addition, possible to use<br>
pigments according to the invention together with other pigments and/or colorants, for<br>
example in combinations as described hereinbefore or as known in cosmetic preparations.<br>
The cosmetic preparations and formulations according to the invention preferably contain the<br>
pigment according to the invention in an amount from 0.005 to 50 % by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the preparation.<br>
J6<br><br>

The Examples that follow illustrate the invention without limiting the scope thereof. Unless otherwise   indicated,   percentages  and   parts  are   percentages   and   parts   by  weight, respectively. EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
In a vacuum system which in its fundamental points is constructed analogously to the system described in US 6 270 840, the following are vaporised, from vaporisers, in succession: sodium chloride (NaCI) as separating agent at about 900°C, and silicon monoxide (SiO) as reaction product of Si and Si02 at from 1350 to 1550°C. The layer thickness of NaCI is typically 30-50 nm, that of SiOy being, depending on the intended purpose of the end product, from 100 to 2000 nm, in the present case 215 to 385 nm. Vaporisation is carried out at about 0.02 Pa, amounting to about 11 g of NaCI and 72 g of SiO per minute. For subsequently detaching the layers by dissolution of the separating agent, the carrier on which vapour-deposition has taken place is sprayed at about 3000 Pa with deionised water and treated with mechanical assistance using scrapers and with ultrasound. The NaCI dissolves and the SiOy layer, which is insoluble, breaks up into flakes. The suspension is continuously removed from the dissolution chamber and, at atmospheric pressure, is concentrated by filtration and rinsed several times with deionised<br>
water in order to remove Na+ and CI" ions that are present. That is followed by the steps of milling, sieving and drying. All the particles have an average diameter smaller than 40 microns. A molybden crucible is then filled with these SiO flakes and set in a quartz tube. The quartz tube containing the Mo crucible with the SiO flakes is evacuated till the vacuum reaches about 13 Pa (10"1 Torr). Then the tube is heated stepwise from room temperature to 900°C. The quartz tube is maintained at 900°C during at least 1 hour. During the heating the color of the SiO flakes changes and the SiO powder becomes more and more opaque. After cooling to room temperature a full colored powder is obtained, which shows color changes in dependence of the observation angle, wherein the color depends on the thickness of the SiO flakes.<br>
The reflection colour (CIE-L*C*h) of the silicon/silicon oxide flakes is determined at irradiation with standard illuminant D65 under a 10° observation angle.<br><br>

Example 2<br>
Example 1 is repeated, except that instead of a mixture of Si/Si02 a mixture of SiO containing 15 % by weight Si is used. The obtained flakes have a ratio of oxygen to silicon of ca. 0.86, a thickness of about 120 nm and an average diameter smaller than 40 microns. A molybden crucible is then filled with these SiO0.86 flakes and set in a quartz tube. The quartz tube containing the Mo crucible with the SiO0.86 flakes is evacuated till the vacuum reaches about 13 Pa (10'1 Torr). Then the tube is heated stepwise from room temperature to 900°C. The quartz tube is maintained at 900°C during at least 1 hour. During the heating the color of the silicon oxide flakes changes and the silicon oxide powder becomes more and more opaque. After cooling to room temperature a full colored powder is obtained, which shows color changes in dependence of the observation angle (blue/violet -&gt; yellow/orange), wherein the color depends on the thickness of the silicon oxide flakes. The plane-parallel structures of SiOo.se show photoluminescence at 890-900 nm (excitation wavelength: -300 nm).<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Example 1 is repeated, except that instead of a mixture of Si/Si02 SiO is used. The obtained yellow flakes have a ratio of oxygen to silicon of ca. 1.0 and a thickness of about 120 nm and do not show color changes in dependence of the observation angle.<br>
Example 3<br>
The silicon/silicon oxide flakes of Example 1 having a thickness of 215 nm are then coated with Ti02 using conventional wet chemistry. The Ti02 deposition is stopped when the Ti02 thickness reaches about 30 nm. The obtained Ti02 coated SiO flakes show a very bright yellow-green color in air. The reflection colour (CIE-L*C*h) of the Ti02 coated silicon/silicon oxide flakes is<br>
determined at irradiation with standard illuminant D6s under a 10° observation angle.<br><br>

Example 4<br>
In a vacuum system which in its fundamental points is constructed analogously to the system described in US 6 270 840, the following are vaporised, from vaporisers, in succession: sodium chloride (NaCI) as separating agent at about 900°C, Si (15 % by<br>
3&amp;<br><br>
weight)/SiO (85 % by weight) at from 1350 to 1550°C, silicon monoxide (SiO) as reaction product of Si and Si02 at from 1350 to 1550°C, and Si (15 % by weight)/SiO (85 % by weight) at from 1350 to 1550°C. The layer thickness of NaCI is typically 30-50 nm, that of the (SiO/Si)(50 - 200 nm)/SiO(50 - 400 nm)/(SiO/Si)(50 - 200 nm) being 180 to 800 nm. Vaporisation is carried out at about 0.02 Pa. For subsequently detaching the layers by dissolution of the separating agent, the carrier on which vapour-deposition has taken place is sprayed at about 3000 Pa with deionised water and treated with mechanical assistance using scrapers and with ultrasound. The NaCI dissolves and the (SiO/Si)/SiO/(SiO/Si) layer, which is insoluble, breaks up into flakes. The suspension is continuously removed from the dissolution chamber and, at atmospheric pressure, is concentrated by filtration<br>
and rinsed several times with deionised water in order to remove Na+ and CI" ions that are present. That is followed by the steps of milling, sieving and drying. All the particles have an average diameter smaller than 40 microns. A molybden crucible is then filled with these (SiO/Si)/SiO/(SiO/Si) flakes and set in a quartz tube. The quartz tube containing the Mo crucible with the (SiO/Si)/SiO/(SiO/Si) flakes is evacuated till the vacuum reaches about 13 Pa (10"1 Torr). Then the tube is heated stepwise from room temperature to 900°C. The quartz tube is maintained at 900°C during at least 1 hour. After cooling to room temperature a full colored powder is obtained, which shows color changes in dependence of the observation angle, wherein a different concentration of Si in the Si02 matrix leads to different refractive indices and, hence, interference colors.<br>
