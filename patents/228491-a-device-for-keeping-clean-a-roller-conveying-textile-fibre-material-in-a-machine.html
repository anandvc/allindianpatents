A device for keeping clean a roller conveying textile fibre material in a machine<br>
The invention relates to a device for keeping clean a roller conveying textile fibre material in a machine, with the device comprising a suction pipe and a stripper knife.<br>
During the operation, fibres, honeydew and/or other impurities frequently adhere to rollers which convey textile fibre material in a machine. It is common practice to arrange a stripper knife in contact with such a roller which strips off such elements from the roller and to provide adjacent to said roller and parallel thereto a suction pipe with a longitudinal slot through which said stripped elements are carried off. The stripper knife in particular, but also the suction pipe, must be cleaned periodically (relieved from any impurities or fibres that have got caught) . This cleaning can be very cumbersome when, as is often the case, there is little available space in the vicinity of the roller in the machine.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a device of the kind mentioned above in such a way that a rapid and easy cleaning of the stripper knife and the suction pipe is enabled.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in such a way that the stripper knife is held close to the suction pipe and that the suction pipe carries guide elements which can be guided on a guide means which is attached in the machine, which guidance occurs in such a way that the stripper knife and the suction pipe can be pushed out from the machine and can be pushed into the machine jointly as a unit.<br><br>
The advantage is clear: The stripper knife and the suction pipe can be pushed out of the machine jointly for the cleaning, so that the limited space in the machine does not obstruct the cleaning. After the cleaning outside of the machine the unit is simply pushed back into the machine again where it is favourably held by a snap connection.<br>
The suction pipe, which favourably comprises a longitudinal slot facing the roller, can preferably be rotatably adjustable with respect to the stripper knife. The adjustment of the suction pipe allows changing the effective width of the suction slot between the free edge of the stripper knife and one edge of the slot in the suction pipe.<br>
A particularly favourable keeping-clean effect is achieved when the stripper knife is pressed during the operation against the circumference of the roller by spring force in such a way that the stripper knife is held in pivot bearings in holding devices attached on the suction pipe and is spring-loaded in the swivelling direction with respect to the holding devices. Favourably, the amount of the spring load can be adjustable.<br>
The guide means can be attached in the machine transversally adjustable to the roller, so that the distance between the suction pipe and the roller can be changed. By adjusting the guide means the amount of the spring force is simultaneously altered with which the stripper knife held on the suction pipe is pressed against the circumferential surface of the roller during operation.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for keeping clean a roller which conveys textile fibre material in a machine, having a suction pipe and a stripper knife, characterized in that the stripper knife is held on the suction pipe carries guide elements which are relocatable supported on a guide means which is attached to the machine.<br>
An embodiment of the device in accordance with the invention is shown schematically<br>
in the drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross section through the device;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a view from the right in Fig. 1 and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a view from the left in fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the outline of a roller 1 with a broken line. Roller 1 is rotatably held in a machine (not shown) and co-operates with at least one counterroller (also not shown) in order to convey textile fibre material in the machine, e.g. in form of a lap or a fleece.<br>
The device for cleaning the roller 1 comprises a stripper knife with a knife plate 2 and a stripper carrier 3, on which the knife plate 2 is attached, as well as a suction pipe with a middle element 4 and two pipe sockets 5 and 6 which are attached at the two ends of the middle element 4. The knife plate 2 is parallel to the axis of the roller 1 and rests with its free end on the circumferential surface of the roller. The suction pipe 4, 5, 6 also extends parallel to the axis of roller 1 and comprises in its middle element 4 a longitudinal slot 4.1 which faces the roller 1. One end of the suction pipe 4, 5, 6 is closed with a stopper 7. During the operation a suction tube (not shown) is connected to the other end, i.e. to the free end of the pipe socket 5. Two holding devices 8 and 9 are arranged on the two pipe sockets and clamped tight with setscrews 10 and 11, respectively (fig. 2). The stripper carrier 3 comprises at its ends a tappet 12 and 13 (fig. 3) which<br><br>
is held in a bore in the holding device 8 and 9, respectively. Fig. 3 only shows the bore 14 in the holding device 8. Holding device 9 also comprises a respective bore. In this manner the stripper knife 2, 3 is held in the suction pipe 4, 5, 6. The bores in the holding devices 8 and 9, like the bores 14, form the pivot bearing for the stripper knife 2,   3.<br>
The stripper knife 2, 3 is spring-loaded in the pivoting direction with respect to the holding devices 8 and 9 in such a way that the free edge of the knife plate 2 is pressed against the circumferential surface of the roller 1. In the embodiment the spring load is produced by torsional coil springs 15 which are arranged in extended inner end sections of the bores 14 in the holding devices 8 and 9. One end of each torsional coil spring 15 is inserted in a bore in the stripper carrier 3. The other end rests in a recess in the respective holding device 8 and 9. If several such recesses are provided in the holding devices 8 and 9 for receiving the outer end of the respective spring, the outer end of the springs can be pushed into any other of the recesses in order to change the amount of the spring load as produced by the springs 15. Instead, several bores could also be provided for the same purpose in the stripper carrier 3 for receiving the inner ends of the springs 15.<br>
After loosening the set screws 10 and 11 (fig. 2) the suction pipe 4, 5, 6 can be rotated in the holding devices 8 and 9. In this way the suction pipe 4, 5, 6 and the stripper knife 2, 3 are mutually rot at ably adjustable about the axis of the suction pipe. By turning the suction pipe 4,5,6 with respect to the holding devices 8 and 9 the effective width of the suction slot is changed between the free edge of the<br><br>
knife plate 2 and one edge of the slot 4.1 in the suction pipe 4, 5, 6.<br>
The suction pipe 4, 5, 6 also carries guide elements 16 which are displaceable along a longitudinal guide means attached in the machine. In the embodiment the guide elements 16 have the shape of undercut grooves (fig. 1) which are arranged in the holding devices 8 and 9 and fit into a guide rail 17 which is attached in the machine and is parallel to the roller 1. The guide rail 17 is connected to guide holding devices 18 and 19. They are attached to the frame of the machine with screws (not shown). The screws extend through oblong holes 20 in the guide holding devices 18 and 19, so that the guide rail 17, after loosening the screws, is adjustable transversally to the roller 1 in order to change the distance of the suction tube 4, 5, 6 from the roller 1. At the same time the amount of the spring load of the stripper knife 2, 3 also changes, as it is adjusted together with the suction tube 4. 5, 6.<br>
By displacing the holding devices 8 and 9 along the guide rail 17 the holding devices can be pushed jointly out of the machine with the stripper knife 2, 3 and the suction tube 4, 5, 6 as a unit and, after cleaning and/or a repair, can be pushed back into the machine again.<br>
In the inserted condition the unit is held in the machine by a snap connection which is provided with an element carried by the suction tube 4, 5, 6 and an element attached in the machine. In the embodiment the snap connection is provided with a pin 21 (fig. 3) with a head, which pin is attached to the outer side of the holding device 9. The head of the pin 21 engages in an opening in a holder-up 22 which is used simultaneously as a limit stop for the displacement of the holding-<br><br>
device 9 with the suction pipe 4, 5, 6 and the stripper knife 2, 3. The holder-up 22 is adjustably attached transversally to roller 1 in the machine in a manner similar to the guide holding devices 18 and 19.<br><br><br><br><br>
