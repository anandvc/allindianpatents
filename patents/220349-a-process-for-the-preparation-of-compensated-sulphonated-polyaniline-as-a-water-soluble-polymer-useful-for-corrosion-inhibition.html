				<td>This invention relates to sulphonated polyaniline as a water soluble polymer useful for   corrosion inhibition and process for the preparation of the said polymer.<br>

WATER  SOLUBLE   POLYANILINE<br>
Where <br>
The water soluble polyaniline of the present invention finds various applications as an corrosion protection of iron and mild steel in HC1 medium and saline water.<br>
There has been recently an increased 'interest in conducting polymer polyaniline (PANI), which has been studied extensively because of its unique proto-electron conduction mechanism. Epstein et al. in " Effect of Sulfonic Acid Group on Polyaniline Backbone", J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113 (1991) 2665 - 71 describes results on preperation and characterization of a self-doped conducting polymer (SPAN). J. Yue et al. in "Comparison of different synthetic routes for sulphonation of polyaniline", Polymer, 33 (1992) 4410 - 4418 has explained various routes and the effect of nature of oxidant, time duration and the effect of temperature on the formation of final product (SPAN). In this paper, characterization of all the products formed by different routes has also been studied although the starting<br>
precursor for all routes are same. N. Kuramoto et.al. in "Modification of Growth rate and structure of electropolymerized aniline by sodium polyvinyl sulphonate", J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm., (1990) 1478 have described the influence of polyvinyl sulphonate on the electropolymerization of aniline which modifies the electroactive and redox properties of the resultant film. In an another paper, J. Yue and A.J. Epstein in "Electronic control of pH at sulfonated polyaniline electrodes", J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commu. (1992)1540 has studied the electrochemical modulation of self doped sulfonated polyaniline which can be used as a pH modulator. H.S.O.Chan et.al. in "Phosphonic doped emeraldine base", Macromolecules 27 (1994) 2159-64 explain better thermal stability without loss of a dopant species when polyaniline is doped with phosphonic acid esters. A recent paper by X.L.Wei ,Y.Z. Wang C. Bobeczko and A.J. Epstein on "Synthesis and Physical Properties of highly Sulphonated Polyaniline",J.Am.Chem. Soc. 118 (1996) 2545-2555) explains the details of synthesis and extensive characterization of LEB-SPAN. A paper by A.Talo et.al. " PANI/EPOXY coatings with good anticorrosion properties" Synth. Metals 85 (1-3) (1997) 1333-34 explains the complete electrochromical phenomenon of corrosion in presence of Hcl and also in presence of NaCl. A complete study of X-Ray Photoelectron spectroscopic study for corrosion protection of iron /steel by Emaraldene Base has been studied by M. Fahlman, S. Jasty, A.J. Epstein in "Corrosion Protection of Iron/Steel by EB PANI - an X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy study", Synth. Metals 85 (1-3) (1997) 1323-26. Genies et al. in "Polyaniline - A Historical survey", Synthetic Metals, 36<br>
(1990) 139 - 82 describes a detailed study on the electrochemical and chemical polymerization, redox mechanism and electrochemical properties of polyaniline. Another study related to corrosion is done by P.J. Kinlen et al "Corrosion protection using PANI coating formulation ", Pitture Vermici Eur 73 (17) (1997) 4847-53, in which PANI is used alongwith crylic resin primers and this also includes the whole study of salt fog tesdting done with PANI coatings. I V Yagova, S S Ivanov and V V Yagov in " Aniline based anodically polymerised coatings for corrosion -hydrogenation protection of steel," Prot.Met. 34(1) (1998) 51-53 have explained the effect of aniline polymerised coatings on the rate of corrosion A complete systematic study of PANI along with a series of epoxides has been reported by T.Page Mcandrew et al in "PANI in corrosion -resistant coating", ACS Symp. Ser. 689 (1998) 396-408. This paper also reports about good corrosion results of PANI especially when it is blended with other epoxides and diisocyanaies. US patents No. 5,164,465; 5,008,041; 789 095; WO 96 14, 343; WO 97 03, 127; WO 97 14, 729 had given detailed data of self protonated polyaniline, preparation of high molecular weight polyaniline and preparation of electrically conducting PANI salts having solubility in organic solvents and use of PANI coating formulations for corrosion protection. Reacting polyanilines with sultones can introduce an alkyl sulfonic acid group on the nitrogen atom of polyanilines (U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,859). Dehydrogenating polyanilines of emeraldine base with sodium hydroxide and then reacting with propane sultone, the reaction product, poly(aniline-co-sodium N-propane sulfonate aniline) exhibited relatively good water solubility, however since it is in undoped state, treatment with<br>
H-form ion exchange resin might be necassary to obtain green aqueous soluuon of poly(aniline-co-N-propanesu!phonic acid aniline). Naguen and Diaz (Macromolecules, 28 (1995)3411 have synthesised copolymer of aniline and o-anthranlic acid which are soluble in allkaline aqueous solutions but they have a problem of low solubility in water. US Patent No. 5645890 (1997) provides an improved method for inhibiting the corrosion of metal substrate by applying a chemically deposited polyaniline on exposed surface of iron substrate SS-304 and SS-340. US Patent No. 589170 (April 1999) relates to a process for the water soluble self acid doped polyaniline which are prepared by reacting polyaniline derivatives with 2-suiphobenzoic anhydride in the presence of pyridine and N-methylpyrrolidinone and treating the reaction product with ion excahnge resin to convert into doped state. Japanese patents No. JP1092,220( 98 92,220); JP 0987,575(97 87.515) and JP 06003813 (A2 94 0114)have given a description of water based electrically conductive PANI composites; manufacture of PANI based conductive polymer and technological uses of SPAN with its application to processibility.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of compensated sulphonated polyaniline as a water soluble polymer useful for corrosion inhibition which obviates the drawbacks mentioned above. Another object of the present invention is to provide a polymer useful as corrosion inhibitor of iron and mild steel in Hcl and saline water medium.<br>
Yet another object of the present is to provide a polymer which is thermally stable<br>
upto 320"C.<br>
Description of Drawings:<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification:<br>
Figure   1   represents  a graph  showing  forms  of polyaniline  and  sulphonated<br>
polyaniline .The complete reduced form of polyaniline is leucoemeraldine as shown<br>
in (a) whereas the emeraldine base as shown in (b) consists of 50% reduced and50%<br>
oxidized benzenoid and quinoid repeat units. The doping of the emeraldine base<br>
leads to the formation of conducting polyaniline as shown in (c).The sulfonation of<br>
the emeraldine base leads to the formation of sulphonated polyaniline as shown in<br>
(d) whereas water soluble compensated sulphonated polyaniline as shown in (e) is<br>
obtained by the treatment of sulphonated polyaniline with alkali hydroxides.<br>

observed are 320nm,461 and 633nm.<br>
Figure 2 (curve b) represents a graph showing UV-visible absorption spectra of self<br>
protonated  polyaniline  in dimethyl  sulphoxide  (DMSO).The  absorption  bands<br>
observed in DMSO lie at 330nm,460 and 620nm.<br>
Figure 2 (curve c) represents a graph   showing UV-visible absorption spectra of<br>
compensated self protonated polyaniline in water.The absorption band maxima lies<br>
at 259nm,311 and 534nm.<br>
Figure 2 (curve d) represents a graph showing UV-visible absorption spectra of C-<br>
SPAN in methanol.The band value observed in the present case lies at 260nm and<br>

Figure 3 (curve a) represents a graph showing UV-visible absorption spectra of 100<br>
ppm  of C-SPAN  in  1.0 N  HO  (in which Fe electrode was dipped  for 30<br>
minutes). UV spectra shows bands at 420nm,540nm and 979nm.<br>
Figure 3 (curve b) represents a graph showing UV-visible absorption spectra of 200<br>
ppm of C-SPAN in  1.0 N HC1 (in which Fe electrode was dipped  for 30<br>
minutes).The absorption spectra shows bands at 420nm,540nm and 979nm. However<br>
the absorption spectra of C-Span in water show bands at 259,310 and 534nm.The<br>
appearence of bands at 420 and 979nm shows the presence of charged moities in the<br>
polymeric backbone.<br>
Figure 3 (curve c) represents a graph showing UV-visible absorption spectra of 300<br>
ppm of NaSPAN in 1.0 N HC1 (in which Fe electrode was dipped for 30 minutes).<br>
Figure 3 (curve d) represents a graph showing UV-visible absorption spectra of 400<br>
ppm of NaSPAN in 1.0 N HC1 (in which Fe electrode was dipped for 30<br>

doped polyaniline, (4c) represents XRD analysis for sulphonated polyaniline and<br>
(4d) represents XRD analysis for compensated sulphonated polyaniline. The XRD<br>
data clearly indicates the amorphous nature of the parent polymer emeraldine base<br>
or its doped form and sulphonated polyaniline whereas higher degree of crystalinity is observed in case of compensated sulphonated polyaniline.The fraction crystalinity estimated by comparing the integerated intensity of the peaks above the amorphous hump intensity shows that the degree of crystallinity of the compensated polymer compred to the parent polymer is 91%.<br>
Figure 5 represents a graph showing DSC of compensated polyaniline (C-SPAN). Differential calorimetric analysis as shown in curve (a) of the C-SPAN, showed that the polymer has a sharp melting point (Tm) of the order of 251oC whereas the parent polymer in the doped or undoped state dose not show any Tm or sharp crystallization temperature,Tc, which is 180.6oC. Fig. 5 ( a) corresponds to the DSC of compensated polyaniline at a scan rate of 20°C/min on going from 50o C to 400°C and 5( b) corresponds to the rescanning of the DSC (after cooling the system from 400°C to 50°C) from 50oC to 400oC.<br>
In the present invention, we have prepared a polymer soluble in water which can be used for the corrosion protection of iron and mild steel in corrosive medium like HC1 and saline water. The crystallinity observed for the water soluble polymer has not been observed by any other group and the novelty of the present invention resides in the use of this polymer as a corrosion inhibitor for iron and mild steel in HC1 and NaCl. The novelty of the present invention lies in making a polymer water soluble by suitably treating the same with sulphur based compound and alkali hydroxides. The inventive step is in attaching a sulphonated group to the polymer backbone.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compensated sulphonated polyaniline as a water soluble polymer useful for corrosion inhibition which comprises:<br>
i)         adding oleum to a polymer such as herein described at a temperature in the range of<br>
- 5°C to 5°C, ii)        stirring the mixture as obtained in (i) continuously under cooling for a period in the<br>
range of 4 -6 hours, iii)        digesting the said polymer completely in oleum for a period in the range of 24 to 48<br>
hours to yield sulphonated polymer, iv)        regenerating by known methods the sulphonated   polymer in a mixture of organic<br>
solvent and water to get a green precipitate, filtering the said precipitate to obtain a<br>
green cake, v)         drying the green cake so obtained in step (iv) at a temperature in the range of 50 to<br>
60°C,<br>
vi)       treating the green cake so obtained in step (v) with an alkali hydroxide solution, vii)       drying the solution so obtained in step (vi) at a temperature in the range of 70°C to<br>
80°C to obtain compensated sulphonated polyaniline as water soluble polymer.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the polymer used may be selected from a group consisting of emeraldine base, leucoemeraldine.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the sulphur based chemical used is oleum in the range of 24-60%.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the organic solvent used tor<br>
regeneration as a mixture with water is selected from a group consisting of<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropanol.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the mixture of the organic<br>
solvent and water is in the range of 80 :20 to 90:10%.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the     alkali hydroxide is<br>
selected from a group consisting of sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and<br>
potassium hydroxide.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the strength of the alkali<br>
hydroxide is in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 M<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention,  the water soluble polyaniline<br>
prepared by the process of present invention is crystalline in nature.<br>
In a further embodiement of the present invention, the polymer may be used in the<br>
system as cooling towers,pipelines,ballast tanks and oil and gas production units<br>
where metals like iron are susceptible for corrosion.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the quantity required for its use as c<br>
orrosion inhibitor is in the range of 200-500 ppm.<br>
The present invention further provides a compensated sulphonated polyaniline<br>
having following characteristics :<br>
(i)thermal stability upto 320 °C (ii) environmentally stable in the presence of air and<br>
moisture (iii) orthorhombic crystalline nature (iv) sharp melting point of 251.06 °C<br>
and crystallization temperature of 180.60 °C (v) is water soluble.<br>
Accordingly the present invention further provides a water soluble compensated sulphonated polyaniline which can be useful as corrosion inhibitor of iron and mild steel.<br>
The compensated sulphonated polyaniline so obtained after treatment with aqueous NaOH is soluble in water which is a novel characteristic of the said compensated polyaniline. Conducting compensated polymer polyaniline is as such insoluble in any organic solvent whereas the undoped form of the polymer is soluble in organic solvents like N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF) etc. By attaching a sulphonate group in the polymeric backbone of polyaniline and compensating the polymer with alkali hydroxide like NaOH, we are able to prepare a polymer soluble in water. Emeraldine base and doped conducting form of polyaniline is amorphous whereas the compensated sulphonated polyaniline prepared by us is crystalline in nature as determined by x.r.d. pattern of the polymer (Figure4). The fraction crystallinity estimated by comparing the integerated intensity of the peaks above the amorphous hump intensity is found to be 91 %. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) curve of the compensated polyaniline shows a sharp melting point (Tm) at 251-C and the crystallization temperature (Tc) at 180.6-C (Figure 5) whereas the parent polymer does not show any Tm or Tc. The compensated polyaniline shows absorption bands at 305 and 535 nm whereas the emeraldine base show absorption bands at 320 and 620 nm in NMP.<br>

Next another iron piece of the same nominal dimension was taken and dipped in 1.0 N HC1 containing 500 ppm of water soluble compensated sulphonated polymer. The weight loss in this case was also measured and found to be 0.004 gms thereby giving corrosion<br><br>
inhibition efficiency of 96% and indicating efficiency of corrosion inhibition by the compensated sulphonated polyaniline polymer added to the acid solution.<br>
Example 6<br>

When the emeraldine base is completely dissolved, stirring was kept continued further for 43 hours at 30°C so that there is complete incorporation of sulphonate motety in the polymeric backbone. To this bluish violet solution, methanol - water mixture is added in the ratio of 90 : 10 under constant stirring till a green precipitate comes out .This solution was then kept as such for 15 hours and then filtered and the green cake of polymer so obtained is treated with aqueousLiOH of strength 1.0 M so that lithium is attached alongwith the sulphonated moiety and a blue solution is obtained. The solution was dried at 60°C by indirect heating and the polymer so obtained was named LiSPAN and was used for corrosion protection studies as detailed below:<br>

#	Water soluble polyaniline prepared by Epstein method<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	The water soluble polymer acts as a corrosion inhibitor to iron based materials in<br>
saline water and acid medium.<br>
2.	Only a tiny amount of the substance is required ro be mixed in the corroding<br>
medium for effective anticorrosion property.<br>
A corrosion inhibitor is a chemical substance which when added in small concentrations to a system retard the reaction of the metal with the atmospheric environment like oxygen,air and water. These are added to many systems like cooling towers , pipelines,ballast tanks,oil and gas production units and many other units where metals like iron,copper and aluminium are susceptible for corrosion.Organic inhibitors are of primary importance because organic molecules inhibits corrosion by adsorbing at the metal solution interface because of their strong adsorption on metallic surfaces due to the presence of pi-electrons.However inhibition efficiencies are not very high because of van der walls repulsion between neighbouring monomeric units, thus leaving the majority of the metal surface unprotected. We envisage that soluble compensated su!phonated polyaniline having quartenary ammonium nitrogen and pi-electrons from the aromatic nucleus would help in a strong adsorption of polymer on the iron surface to give uniform coverage by minimizing the van der walls repulsive forces so that the maximum metal surface can be protected.The sulphonated group attached to the polymeric backbone remains facing the electrolyte to prevent the corroding ions from reaching the iron surface and to give increased corrosion inhibition efficiencies.<br><br><br><br><br>
