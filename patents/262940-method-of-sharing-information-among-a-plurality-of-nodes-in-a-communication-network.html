				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to sharing of information in a communication network. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and system for efficiently utilizing the communication network resources while securely sharing the information in the communication network.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With an increase in the need for sharing information, communication networks are becoming increasingly popular. A communication network can include some nodes, some central servers and some external website servers. Some examples of a communication network include a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and the Internet, Some examples of nodes include persona! computers, laptop computers, and handheld computers. The communication network facilitates nodes to share information amongst them, in some examples, nodes can share information via a central server available in the communication network.<br>
There exist various scenarios according to which a node in the communication network can make a request for information. According to one such scenario, a first node in the communication network sends a request for information, which is available at a second node, in this scenario, the request for the information is received by a central server. The central server can initiate a peer-to-peer communication between the first node and the second node.<br><br>
Further, the sharing of information takes place in a peer-to-peer mode. Consider a second scenario in which the first node wants to download information from an external website server. In this scenario, the central server facilitates the first node in downloading the information from the external website server.<br>
However, the techniques facilitating the above mentioned scenarios suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages. In a technique using peer-to-peer mode for sharing information, identity of the second node is known to the first node. This technique does not enable a node to hide its identity while sharing the information with other nodes in the communication network. The technique that enables downloading of information does not take into account if the information to be downloaded by the first node, from the external website server, is already available at the second node. As a result, every time a request is made for downloading information from an external website server, the request is fonwarded to the external website server. This utilizes the bandwidth of a connection between the first node and the external website server.<br>
In light of the above discussion, there is a need for a method and system for securely sharing information in a communication network. Further, the method and system should also enable efficient utilization resources in a communication network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In an embodiment, a method for sharing informafion in a communication network is provided. The communication network includes a central server and a<br><br>
plurality of nodes. The method includes receiving a request for the information from a first node of the plurality of nodes. The method also includes determining a second node of the plurality of nodes where the information is stored. Further, the method includes verifying a checksum associated with the information and verifying validity of the information based on the checksum. Moreover, the method includes forwarding the information to the first node when the information is verified to be correct. Examples of the information includes, but are not limited to, data files, media files, and executable files. In an embodiment, the information is downloaded from an external website server. In this embodiment, the request received from the first node is for downloading the information from the external website server.<br>
In another embodiment, a central server is provided. The central server includes a receiver configured to receive a request for information from a first node of a plurality of nodes in a communication network.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The terms used to describe various embodiments are exemplary. It should be understood that these are provided to merely aid the understanding of the description, and that their use and definitions in no way limit the scope of the invention.<br><br>
2<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a communication network 100, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The network communication 100 can include one or more central servers and a plurality of nodes. Examples of the communication network 100 include, but are not limited to, a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Metropolitan Area Network, and the Internet. For the purpose of this description, the network 100 is shown to include a central server 102, a node 104, a node 106, a node 108, a node 110, a node 112, and a node 114. In some embodiments, the nodes in the communication network 100 may be referred to as a first node and/or a second node. Examples of one or more central servers and the plurality of nodes include, but are not limited to, personal computers, laptops computers, and handheld computers. This embodiment will be explained with the help of the central server 102, the node 104 and the node 106. However, it will be apparent to a person ordinarily skilled in the art that the present embodiment can be implemented by using any other central server and nodes in the communication network 100.<br>
The central server 102 facilitates sharing of information amongst nodes. According to one embodiment, the node 104 needs information that is stored at<br><br>
the node 106. In this embodiment, the node 104 sends a request for the information to the central server 102, The central server 102 forwards the request to the node 104. In an embodiment, the central server 102 receives the information from the node 106 and processes the information. The central server 102 can process the information to verify a checksum associated with the information and to hide identity of the node 106. The central server 102 can verify the checksum associated with the information by comparing the checksum with a checksum corresponding to the information that is stored in a log-file maintained at the central server 102. The central server 102 can hide the identity of the node 106 by routing the information via itself (i.e. by not establishing a peer-to-peer communication between the node 104 and the node 106). The process of sharing information in a communication network is explained in detail in conjunction with FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a communication network 200, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The network communication 200 can include a central server, a plurality of nodes, and one or more external website servers. The central server and the plurality of nodes form a LAN. In this embodiment, description of the plurality of nodes and central server is similar to the description of the central server and the plurality of nodes described in conjunction with FIG. 1. In this embodiment, the network 200 also includes an external website server 202 apart from the communication devices described in FIG. 1. In this embodiment, information required by the node 104 is also available at the external website server 202. This embodiment will be explained<br><br>
2<br>
with the help of the central server 102, the node 104, the node 106, and the external website server 202. However, it will be apparent to a person ordinarily skilled in the art that the present embodiment can be implemented by using any other central server, nodes, and an external website server in the communication network 200.<br>
In this embodiment, the node 104 sends a request for downloading information from the external website server 202. The central server 102, which is always monitoring request originating in LAN 204, receives this request. The central server 102 then determines if the information required by the node 104 is available at any other node in the LAN 204. If it determined by the central server 102 that the information required by the node 104 is not present in any of the nodes present the LAN 204, the central server 102 fonA^ards the request to the external website server 202. If it is determined by the central server 102 that the information required by the node 104 is available at a node, for example, the node 106, the central server 102 fonA^ards the request to the node 106. The central server 102 then verifies a checksum associated with the information. If the checksum is verified to be correct, the central server 102 forwards the information to the node 104. The path used for sharing the information is depicted by using 206 and 208. If the checksum is verified to be incorrect, the central server 102 fonA/ards the request to the external website server 202 for downloading the information. The process of sharing information in a communication network when the request is for downloading information from an external website server is explained in detail in conjunction with FIG. 5.<br><br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the central server 102, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The central server 102 includes a receiver 302, a processor 304, and a transmitter 306. The receiver 302 is configured to receive a request for information from the first node 104 of the plurality of nodes in a communication network (the communication network 100 and/or communication network 200). In an embodiment, the receiver 302 is also configured to receive the information from an external website server, for example, the external website server 202. The processor 304 is configured to determine the second node 106 of the plurality of nodes storing the information required by the first node 104. The processor 304 is also configured to verify a checksum associated with the information and verify validity of the information based on comparison of the checksum with the checksum (corresponding to the information) stored in a log-file. The transmitter 306 is configured to forward the information to the first node 104 when the information is verified to be correct.<br>
The validity of the information based on the checksum enables the central server 102 to determine whether the information stored at the second node 106 is correct or not. If the checksum of the information that is determined by the central server 102 based on the information is same as the checksum of the information that is maintained in a log-file, the information is verified to be correct. If the checksum of the information that is determined by the central server 102 based on the information is different from the checksum of the information that is maintained in the log-file, the information is corrupt or incorrect, hence shall delete that particular entry in the log-file for all future references. Apart from checksum associated with each information, the log-file<br><br>
also includes Universal Resource Locator (URL) of request made by the plurality of nodes, identity of the plurality nodes, and date and time the request was made by the plurality of nodes. Identity of a node can include IP address of a node and/or name of the node. In an embodiment, the central server 102 also includes a memory module 306 to store the log-file.<br>
In an embodiment, the central server also includes a multicasting module 310 for multicasting the information to a set of nodes of the plurality of nodes. The set of node request for the information and the information is related to a live media content. In another embodiment, the receiver 302 and the transmitter 308 can be integrated as a transceiver.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a flow chart depicting a method for sharing information in the communication network 100, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. To explain the method for sharing information, references will be made to FIG. 1 and FIG 3. However, it will be apparent to a person ordinarily skilled in the art that this embodiment can be described by using any other suitable embodiments of the present invention. Further, the method for sharing information can include more number of steps as depicted in FIG. 4. The method for sharing information is initiated at step 402. At step 404, the central server 102 receives a request for information from the first node 104 in the communication network 100. The receiver 302 in the central server 102 receives the request for the information. Examples of the information include, but are not limited to, data files, media files, executable files.<br><br>
In an embodiment, ttie central server 102 monitors request from the plurality of nodes in the communication network 100. In this embodiment, the central server 102 searches the log-file for the request made by the first node 104 and retrieves information from the second node 106 when the request matches an entry in the log-file. Further, the log-file is updated after the first node 104 receives the information. The log-file is updated by adding an entry of the first node 104 against the information. This helps the central server 102 to be updated with the number and/or address of the node storing the information.<br>
At step 406, the processor 304 in the central server 102 determines that a second node 106 of the plurality of nodes in the communication network 100 have/stores the information required by the first node 104. After determining the second node 106, the processor 304 in the central server 102 verifies a checksum associated with the information at step 408. The checksum can be verified by performing a cyclic redundancy check or any other similar mechanisms on the information.<br>
in an embodiment, the method also includes associating a checksum with the information. In an example, the checksum can be associated with information by the central server 102. The central server 102 also maintains a log-file for storing checksum associated with each information. The log-file also includes Universal Resource Locator (URL) requests made by the plurality of nodes, identity of the plurality of node, and date and time the request was made by the plurality of nodes. In this embodiment, the central server 102 can verify the checksum by comparing the checksum with the checksum (associated with the information) stored in the log-file.<br><br>
At step 410, the processor 304 in the central server 102 verifies the validity of the information based on the checksum. In an embodiment, the receiver 302 in the central server 102 receives the information from the second node 106 when the information is verified to be correct. At step 412, the transmitter 308 fonwards the information to the first node 104 when the information is verified to be correct. At step 414, the central server 102 updates the log-file by adding an entry of the first node 104 against the information. This enables the central server 102 to retrieve the information from the first node 104 when the second node 106 is down or when the information at the second node 106 is verified to be incorrect. Thereafter, the method for sharing information is terminated at step 416.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a flow chart depicting a method for sharing information in the communication network 200, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. To explain the method for sharing information, references will be made to FIG. 2 and FIG 3. However, it will be apparent to a person ordinarily skilled in the art that this embodiment can be described by using any other suitable embodiments of the present invention. Further, the method for sharing information can include more or fewer number of steps as depicted in FIG. 5A and 5B. The method for sharing information is initiated at step 502.<br>
At step 504, the central server 102 receives a request from the first node 104 in the communication network 200 for downloading information from the external website 202. At step 506, the central server 102 determines whether the information is available at the second node 106 in the communication<br><br>
network 200. If it is determined at step 506 that the information is available at the second node 106, the central server 102 redirects the request to the second node 106 in the communication network 200 at step 508. In an embodiment, the second node 106 has downloaded the information prior to the central server 102 receives the request from the first node 104. At step 510, the central server 102 verifies a checksum associated with the information. Techniques and objectives for verifying the checksum is similar to the techniques and objectives described in previous figures. At step 512, the validity of the information is verified based on the checksum. At step 514, the information is fonA^arded to the fist node 104 when information is verified to be correct. At step 516, the log-file is updated with the entry that the information is also available at the first node 104.<br>
If it is determined at step 506 that the information is not available at the second node 106, the request is sent to the external website server 202 at step 518. In an embodiment, the central server can multicast this information to a set of nodes of the plurality of nodes. The set of nodes request for the information and the information is related to a live media content, in this embodiment, the multicasting module 310 in the central serve 102 multicasts the information to the set of nodes. The central server 102 can determine whether the information is available at the second node 106 by checking the log-file maintained at the central server 102. If there is an entry corresponding to the request in the log-file the information is available at the second node 106, else the information is not available at the second node 106. In an embodiment, if the information does not pass the checksum verification, step 516 is performed. In this embodiment, an entry corresponding to the second node 106 and the information is deleted from<br><br>
the log-file maintained at the central server 102. At step 520, the information is downloaded from the external website server 202.<br>
At step 522, the log-fiie is updated based on the information and the first node 104. For example, identity of the first node 104 can be added against the information in the log-file. Further, the time and date of downloading the information can also be added with respect to the first node 104 and the information. The date and fime can be used by the central server 102 to determine the availability of a latest copy of the information. At step 524, the method for sharing information is terminated.<br>
Various embodiments of the invention provide the following advantages. The present invention provides a secure mechanism for sharing information in a communication network. The identity of a node sharing informafion is hidden from a node requesting for the information. Further, invention provides a mechanism which makes sure that when the informafion is provided to a node, the informafion is correct and uncorrupted. The invenfion also provides a mechanism of efficiently managing of communicafion network resources. For example, when a first node requires informafion to be downloaded from an external website server and the same informafion is available at a second node that is present in the local network of the first node, the informafion is provided to first node from the second node present in its local network. This helps to save the bandwidth of the external network, which is generally paid. Moreover, if mulfiple nodes request for a live media content from an external website server, the central serve can mulficast the live media content to the mulfiple nodes<br><br>
(while having only one connection with the external website server). As a result, the bandwidth of the external network is saved.<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it will be clear that the present invention and its advantages are not limited to these embodiments only. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as described in the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
