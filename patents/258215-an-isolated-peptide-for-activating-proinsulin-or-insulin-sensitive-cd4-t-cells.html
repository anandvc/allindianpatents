BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the 'field of immunotherapy and<br>
imnuinodiagnosis of autoimmune conditions. More particularly, the present invention<br>
provides agents which are recognized by or are specific for proinsulin- or insulinsensitized<br>
T-cells. The present invention further contemplates the use of the these agents<br>
in therapeutic and diagnostic applications for Type 1 'diabetes.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Bibliographic details of the publications referred to in this specification are also collected<br>
at the end of the description.<br>
Reference to any prior art in mis specification is not. and should not be taken as. an<br>
acknowledgmentor any form of suggestion that that prior an forms part of the common<br>
general knowledge in a n y country. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing<br>
pancreatic p cell. The onset of clinical diabetes is preceded by the appearance of antibodies<br>
to (pro)insulin, glutamic acid, decarboxylase (GAD) and tyrosine phosphatase-Hke<br>
insulmoma antigen-2 [IA-2] (Verge, et al, Diabetes 47:1857-1866, 1998; Harrison.<br>
Pediatr Diabetes, 2:71-82, 2001). Serum and T-cell transfer experiments in the non-obese<br>
diabetic (NOD) mouse, a spontaneous model of T1D, have shown that T-cells, not<br>
antibodies, mediate the destruction of the,p cells (Kitutani et al. Adv. Imimmol, 57:285-<br>
322,1992). Furthermore, CD4+ T-cells are absolutely required for the development of TlD<br>
in the NOD mice (Yagi et al., Eur. J. Immimol. 22:2387-2393, 1992). Many genetic loci<br>
have been associated with risk of TlD, but the--highest risk is with the major<br>
hislocoinpatibiliry locus llDDM I ) , in particular with class J) J-ILA genes in numaiis.<br>
specifically the haplotypes H1.A-D1G-DQ2 and HLA-DR4-DQ8 (Pugliese el aL Type 1<br>
diabcicx. Molecular, cellular, and cJinictil:immmolqgy:l3-\S2,\996; Tail et al, Him.<br>
Jmnniniil. 42: \ 16-122. 1995). HLA class 11 molecules present processed protein antigens in<br>
the form of short (1 lamino acids) peptides; to CD4H T-cells. underlining the importance<br>
of Cl 34" T-cells in the development of T1D.<br>
Proinsulin is the major protein product of the p. cell and. with the possible exception of rare<br>
self-anligen expressing cells in lymphoid tissues, is the only known human islet<br>
autoantigcn expressed solely in (3 cells. An increasing hody of evidence implicates<br>
autoimmune reactivity to proinsulin as a major mechanism of P cell destruction<br>
(Narendran et al., 2004. supra). Autoantibodies to insulin are associated with early onset<br>
of disease (Ziegler et al., Diabetes 40:709-714, 1991), and interestingly with HLA DR4<br>
(Eisenbarth et al., J. Ai/toimmiin.. SSuppl. A:241246, 1992). The second strongest genetic<br>
susceptibility locus for T1D, IDDM 2; maps to a variable nucleotide tandem repeat<br>
(VNTR) minisatellite upstream of theinsiuin,gene;(Lucassene/'3/.).Ate. Genet, 4:305-310.<br>
1993). The short class 1 VNTR (26-63 repeats) 'alleles are associated with lower levels of<br>
proinsulin gene transcription in the thymus'and, it is postulated, with less deletion of<br>
proinsulin-specific T-cells and an increased risk of developing T1D; "in contrast, the "long<br>
class HI (140-210 repeats) alleles are associated with higher proinsulin transcription in the<br>
thymus, greater deletion of proinsulin-specific T-cells and a lower risk of T1D (Pugliese et<br>
al, Nat Genet, 75:293-297. 1997). These findings infer that immune responses to<br>
proinsulin are criticaLfor the development of T1D.. ,<br>
The ammo acid sequence of human proinsulin is shown in Figure 1, Proinsulin-derived<br>
peptides that stimulate human T-cells have been,reported (Narendran et al., Autoimmun.<br>
Rev, 2:204-210, 2003, Lieberman -ei al., Tissue Antigens (52:359-377, 2003), but<br>
knowledge of these T-cell epitopes is fragmentary..Proinsulin-derived T-cell epitopes have<br>
been identified hi three different ways: (1) by cloning insulin- or proinsulin-specific CD4+<br>
T-cells and analyzing the epitope specificity of these cells in vitro; (2) by using synthetic<br>
peptides identical to the sequence of proinsuliivtp recall T-cell proliferation responses from<br>
peripheral blr. \l mononuclcar cells (T'BMC.1  in vin; or (3) by immunizing mice that<br>
cxpivss transyenie HLA genes, isolating T-cell hybridomas specific for proinsulin and<br>
analyzing their specificity in vitro. There are few -published reports that describe the<br>
cloning of human CD4H insulin- or proinsulin -specific T-cells (see Table 3). Schloot et al.<br>
J. Autoimimm 1 /:169-175, 1998 identified an HLA-DR- restricted epitope in the B-chain<br>
of insulin (B:ll-27). Semana el al, J. Avtoimnnw 72:259-267, 1999 detected T-ccIl<br>
proliferation in response to C35-50 of proinsulin. A single T-cell clone was isolated that<br>
recognized this C-peptide epitope although the responses were weak. The first proinsulin<br>
T-cell epitope identified from synthetic peptides was B24-C36. in individuals with islet<br>
autoantibodies at risk fo; T1D (Rudy, et al, Mtl MecL 7:625-633, 1995). Others have<br>
tested human T-cells for their capacity to respond to the B9-23 peptide recognized by<br>
CD4+ T-cells in NOD mice (Alleva, et al., J. CUn. Invest. 707:173-180, 2001). Responses<br>
to this peptide were detected in PBMC from diabetic and pre-diabetic donors, but not<br>
healthy controls. ELlSpot assays have been used to detect T-cell responses to GAD and<br>
proinsulin peptides from healthy and diabetic donors (Ott el al., J. CUn. Immunul. 24:321-<br>
339, 2004). T-cell responses Were detected to an epitope C18-A1 .in healthy, diabetic and<br>
pre-diabetic donors. Donors who had antibodies to islet autoantigens had responses to<br>
B11-C24 and C28-A21; donors who had .clinical-diabetes had responses to B20-C4<br>
(Durinovic-Bello et al, J. Autoimmun 75:55-66,2002,). HLA DRB 1-*0401-transgenic mice<br>
were used to identify an HLA DRB 1*0401-restricted proinsulin epitope [C56-64] (Congia<br>
et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci USA P5:3833r3838, 1998). Raju et al., Hwn. Immimol 55:21-<br>
29, 1997 found that pre-proinsulin 1-24, the entire leader sequence, and B21-C39 were<br>
dominant epitopes after immunization of HLA DQ8 transgenic mice. In similar<br>
experiments, HLA DQ6 transgenic mice responded to leader 14-B9 and C60-A5 (Raju el<br>
al., ] 997. supra). In summary, several T-cell epitopes in proinsulin have been reported, but<br>
only two have been identified using T-cell clones, and HLA restriction has only been<br>
defined with HLA transgenic mice.<br>
Modifications of amino acids that occur after translation of mRNA into polypeptide are<br>
known as post-translationaJ modifications.; (PTMs). PTMs. such as phosphorylation,<br>
glycosylation and disulphide bond,formation arj:; critical for correct protein folding and<br>
function. \\'-hile T-cells thai recognize self-pcptidc antigens are deleted during<br>
development or regulated post-natal))', PTMs; .particularly il' induced by inflammation<br>
and/or cellular stress, could create 'nep-antigens' that might .trigger T-ccll responses to<br>
modified self, leading to autoimmune disease (reviewed by Doyle and Mamula, Trends,<br>
hnmunot. 22:443-449. 2001). The paradigm that PTMs create target autoantigens is<br>
alUtctivc. hut there are few examples of PTMs that create human T-cell epitopes. Coeliac<br>
disease, although strictly speaking a food intolerance rather than an autoimmune disease,<br>
is the clearest example of a human disease in which a PTM of the target antigen leads to a<br>
pathogenic T-cell response (Molbcrg et.al.,Nat.'Med. 4:713-717. 1998; Anderson et «/..<br>
Nat. Med. 6:337-442, 2000). Glutamine .(Q) residues in the cereal protein gliadin are<br>
dcamidated by tissue transglutaminase to glutamic acid (E) residues, which are then<br>
recognized by pathogenic T-cells.<br>
There is a iwed to identify major T-cell epitopes in protnsulin and insulin in order to<br>
develop therapeutic and diagnostic agents for Til). i ,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides iinmunotherapcutic and imtnunudiagnostic methods and<br>
agei-is useful for T1D. The- present invention is predicated in part on the identification of a<br>
class ol'pvoinstilin- or insulin-derived A-ohain .epitppe requiring a PTM in order to be fully<br>
reactive to proinsulin or insulin-sensitive T-cells and... in particular CD4"1 T-cells. The PTM<br>
is preferably an intra-chain disuliiile bond between two adjacent cysteine residues.<br>
According! \ . the present invention provides an isolated peptide derivable from the A-chain<br>
of proinsulin or insulin and comprising an amino acid sequence having two adjacent<br>
cysteine residues which, when both participate in,an jntra-chain disulfide bond, enables the<br>
peptide, to activate proinsulin- or insulin-sensitive CD4+ T-cells or a homolog of • said<br>
peptide.<br>
The peptide or its homologs, analogs, orthologs, mutants or derivatives represent a T-cell<br>
epitope from proinsulin or .insulin which requires a:PTM in order io.be fully reactive with<br>
sensitized T-cells. For the sake of .brevity,, the peptide and its homologs, analogs,<br>
orthologs, mutants and derivatives are all.encompassed by the term "T-cell reactive agent"<br>
or'TCRA".<br>
The prescnl invention contemplates, therefore, methods for diagnosing T1D or a<br>
susceptibility for development of same in asubject. The present invention further provides<br>
methods of treatment or prophylaxis of a subject with or having a pre-disposition to<br>
develop T1D. The present invention also provides diagnostic and therapeutic, including<br>
prophylactic, agents to treat or help prevent T.1D oriat least ameliorate the symptoms of<br>
T1D. The present invention further contemplates a method for diagnosing and/or<br>
preventing immune T-cell responses that could attack transplanted (pro)insulin-producing<br>
cells o r tissue. <br>
Vaccines and tolerance-inducing compositions are .also provided in the treatment or<br>
prevention of T1D. Generally, the vaccines or .compositions comprise the TCRAs of the<br>
present .invention or agents capable of interapting -with same.<br>

or variations such as 'comprises1' or 'comprising", will be understood to imply the<br>
inclusion of a stated clement or integer or group of elements or integers but not the<br>
exclusion of am other element or integer or group of elements or integers.<br>
Nuelcolide and amino acid sequences are related to by a sequence identifier number (SEQ<br>
ID "NO:). The SEQ ID NOs: correspond numerically to the sequence identifiers 4001<br>
(SEQ ID N0:l), 4002 (SEQ ID N0;2), etc. A summary of the sequence identifiers is<br>

Figure 2 is a graphical representation showing that the epitope is in the first 12 amino<br>
acids of the A-chair of insulin. Proinsulin specific CD4'T-cell clones were tested against<br>
a panel of peptides corresponding to the sequence of human proinsulin. (A) Preliminary<br>
epitopc mapping. ISiner peptides shifted by three amino acids, comprising the entire<br>
sequence of proiusulin, were grouped into 8 pools of 3-4 peptides each. T-cell clones (5 x<br>
lO4 cells/well) were cultured in the presence of irradiated autologous PBMC (5 x 104/weH)<br>
and each peptide pool. Individual peptides were at a final concentration of 5u.g/ml and^<br>
recombinant human proinsulin at 10|o.g/ml. (B) Fine epitope mapping. The three peptides<br>
that comprised pool 8 were tested separately it'a final concentration of 5^ig/ml. Other<br>
conditions were the same as for (A) above. (C) Cloned T-cells were cultured without<br>
antigen or with lOug/ml proinsulin or 10(ig/ml recombinant human insulin. Anti-HLA DR<br>
monoclonal antibody (L243) was added to a final concentration of 5ug/ml. Proliferation<br>
(mean of triplicate +/- SD) was measured in all experiments by the addition of 0.5nCi/well<br>
3H-thymidine for the final 18 hours of a 72-hour culture. One representative ol'five clones<br>
is shown.<br>

(A) Insulin-specific T-cell clones were cultured in dilutions of a freeze-thaw lysate of<br>
hand-picked human islets or human spleen. Insulin"(lOug/ml) and cells in the absence of<br>
antigen served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Similar results were<br>
obtained with two other insulin-specific clones; '(B) Insulin-specific T-cell clones were<br>
cultured without antigen or with 1/400 dilution tf islet lysate or 10u.g/ml of insulin. Anti-<br>
HLA DR (L243, IgG2a) or anu'-HLA DQ (SPV-L3, IgG2a) were included at a final<br>
concentration of 5u.g/ml.<br>

Anlibodies specific for HI.A DR (L243); HLA DQ (SPV-L3) or HLA DP (B7/2V) were<br>
added to a final concentration of 5u,g/ml. .Similar results were obtained with three other<br>
insulin-specific clones. (TV) Insulin-specific T-cell clones were incubated with irradiated<br>

(KRGWEQCCTSICSL) or an equal volume of solvent. Peptide-pulsed BLS cells (1 x<br>
104/well) were cultured with 2.5 x 10" insulin-specific T-cell clone/well. Proliferation of<br>
the BLS cells without T-cells (1,000-5,000 cpm) was subtracted. Siinilar results were<br>
obtained with three other insulin-specific clones.<br>
Figure 5 is a graphical representation showing that adjacent cysteines are required to<br>
stimulate T'-call clones. The effect of substituting each cysteinc with serine was<br>
investigated. (A) Insulin-specific T-cell clones (2.5: x 104 cells/well) were cultured hi the<br>
presence of 10 to 0.001 (XM A-chain epitope or variants that have each cysteine. _(C)<br>
substituted with serine (S). The substituted amino acid is shown in bold type. Similar<br>
results were obtained with three other insulin-specific clones. (B) In separate experiments,<br>
responses to the native sequence (KRGIVEQGCTSICSL; SEQ ED N0:23) and a more<br>
potent variant (S-13, KRGIVEQCCTSISSL,; SEQ ID NO:26) were compared to the murine<br>
homologue (KRGIVDQCCTSICSL; SEQ ID N0:27).<br>
Figure 6 is a graphical representation showing that the A-chain epitope contains an intrachain<br>
disulphide bond. (A) To identify the modified epitope ihe S-13 peptide was<br>
incubated in serum-containing culture medium for Ih at 37°C. This mixture was separated<br>
by RP-HPLC and 0.5ml fractions collected. The.profilc shows absorbance at214nm. Solid<br>
bars show the proliferation of an insulin-specific.-T--cell clone in response to each fraction<br>
(1/400 dilution). A paraformaldehyde-fixedB-cell.h'ne that expresses HLA DRB1*0404<br>
was used as the APC (1 x 104/well). Proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine<br>
incorporation during the final 18 ,hours of a 72hr culture. (B) MALDI-QTOF mass<br>

In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology is used in<br>
accordance with the definitions set forth below.<br>
The terms "peptide", "compound", TCRA,, "active agent", "chemical agent",<br>
"pharmacologically active agent", "medicament", 'active" and "drug" are used<br>
interchangeably herein to refer to a TCRA that induces a desired pharmacological and/or<br>
physiological effect, The term "TCRA" also includes agonists and antagonists of TCRAs.<br>
The terms also encompass phamaceuticaUy acceptable and pharmacologically active<br>
ingredients of those active agents specifically mentioned herein including but not limited<br>
to salts, esters, amides, prodrags, active metabolites, analogs and the like. Whenthe-terms<br>
"peptide", "compound". TCRA, "active agent",, "chemical agent" "pharmacologically<br>
active agent"', "medicament", "active" and "drug" are used, then it is to be understood that<br>
this includes the active agent per se as well as pharmaceutically acceptable,<br>
pharmacologically active salts, esters, amides, prodrugs. metabolites, analogs, etc.<br>
Reference to a "peptide". "compound", TCRA, "active agent", "chemical agent"<br>
"pharmacologically active agent", "medicament", "active" and "drug" includes<br>

The terms "effective amount" and "therapeuticully effective amount" of an agent as used<br>
herein mean a sufficient amount of the agent (eg. TCRA) to provide the desired therapeutic<br>
or physiological effect or outcome including the desired immunological outcome (e.g.<br>
immunological tolerance). Undesirable effects, e.g. side effects, are sometimes manifested<br>
along with the desired therapeutic effect; hence, a practitioner balances the potential<br>
benefits against the potential risks in determining what is an appropriate "effective<br>
amount". The exact amount of agent required will vary from subject to subject, depending<br>
on the species, age and general condition of the subject, mode of administration and the<br>
like. Thus, it may not be possible 10 specify an exact "effective amount". However, an<br>
appropriate "effective amount" in any individual case may be determined by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.<br>
By "pbarmaceutically acceptable" carrier, excipient or diluent is meant a pharmaceuticalvehicle<br>
comprised of a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e. the<br>
material may be administered to a subject along with the selected active agent without<br>
causing any or a substantial adverse reaction. Carriers, may include excipients and other<br>
additives such as diluents, detergents, coloring agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, pH<br>
buffering agents, preservatives, and the like. .<br>

The present invention identifies an epitope in the A-chain of proinsulin or insulin which<br>
comprises a T-cell reactive portion to proinsulin- or insulin-sensitized CD4* T-cells. The<br>
epitopes are conveniently on a peptide, or a .hpmolog, analog, ortholog, mutant or<br>
derivative of the peptide, collectively referred to herein as a T-cell reactive agent or<br>
TCRA, The peptides or functional equivalents are, therefore, T-cell epitopes or have the<br>
capacity for T-cell epitopes. The present iriventipn.provides, therefore, T-cell pre-epitopes<br>
which, through PTM form T-cell neoepitopes frun ;proinsulin and insulin.<br>
j he "neoepitopc" in this context means that M is a newly formed epitope. The neocpitope<br>
forms Jiom a pre-epilopi1. In a preferred embodiment, a I'TM transforms a T-cell precpitope<br>
to an active T-cell neoepi lope which is capable of stimulating proinsulin or insulinscnsiti/<br>
ed T-cells, and in particular CD4" T-cells.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the PTM is the .formulation of a disulfide bond between two<br>
adjacent cystcine residues. The disulfide bond is, therefore an intra-chain disulfide bond.<br>
The present invention extends however, to other PTMs whether naturally occurring or<br>
ariificially induced.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an isolated peptide comprising at least 10<br>
amino acid residues in length forming a sequence substantially homologous to at least 10<br>
contiguous amino acids within amino acid residues 1 through 21 of the A-chain of human<br>
proinsulin or insulin or their mammalian homolbgs wherein said amino acid sequence<br>
comprises two adjacent cysteine residues whiph when participating in disulfide bond<br>
formulation between each other, renders .the peptide is capable of*stimulating proinsulin- or<br>
insulin-sensitized T-cells, or a homolog, analog, ortholog, mutant or derivative of said<br>
peptide.<br>
By "substantially homologous" includes the situation where within the homologous amino<br>
acid sequence on proinsulin or insulin, the sequence contains one or more amino acid<br>
substitutions, additions or deletions.<br>
The peptide of the present invention is regarded .as a T-cell epitope reactive with<br>
proinsulin- or insulin-sensitized T-cells and in particular CD4+ T-cells when the two<br>
adjacent cysteine residues participate in disulfide bond formulation. Prior to disulfide<br>
bond formulation, the peptide (or its functional equivalents) is said to be a T-cell preepitope.<br>
The peptide and its homologs, analogs, prthologs, mutants and derivatives are<br>
referred to as a "TCRA".<br>
in' concepi of :i "'1-cell cpitope" signifies an antigenic/immunogenic sequence of a<br>
protein which brings about an activati n of T-cells and comprises in accordance with the<br>
present invciuiun the primary sequence of the T-cell epitopc or the primary sequence of an<br>
(untigenic) polypcptidc or protein or antigen which contains at least one primary sequence<br>
.if a T-cell epitope. T-cdls recognize this stimulus normally in the form of a peptide<br>
hound to MHC molecules and in particular MHC class II molecules. T-ccll epitopes can<br>
also bring about only a partial activation in certain instances, in which a decoupling of<br>
various processes associated with the T-cell activation can take place. Full or partial<br>
activation of T-cells may result in release .of mediator substances (e.g. cylokines).<br>
A homolog, analog, ortholog, mutant or derivative of the subject peptide also includes an<br>
altered peptide ligand (APL). An APL of the present invention includes a single or<br>
multiple amino acid substitution, deletion or addition of an amino acid residue in the<br>
peptide or a change in PTM. Changes.in PTM include the introduction or removal of<br>
particular glycosylation patterns, covalent bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide bonds or the<br>
introduction of other groups such as unsaturated or saturated fatty acid moieties or chains.<br>
The present invention provides, therefore, an isolated T-cell neoepiiope created by a PTM<br>
characterized-by (i) comprising a peptide backbone of. at least 10 amino acids having an amino acid<br>
sequence substantially homologous to an arninp acid sequence of the A-chain of proinsulin<br>
or insulin;<br>

cysteine residues of which at least onexorresponds to Cys6 or Cys7 in human proinsulin or<br>
insulin A-chain or a non-human .mammalian equivalent thereof;<br>
(iii) when functioning as a T-cell epitope for proinsulin- or insulin-sensitized CD4+ Tcells,<br>
the two adjacent cysteine residues participate in disulfide bond formulation between<br>
each other;<br>
or a homolog. analog, ortholog. mutant or denvalivc ol said peptidc.<br>
The preierred T-cclJ epitope of the present invention comprises the amino acid sequence<br>
set forth in SHQ ID N0:26. However, the present invention extends to a range of<br>
fragments of the insulin A-diain which comprise at least two adjacent cysteine residues<br>
provided that at least one corresponds to Cys6 or Cys7 although most preferably both Cys6<br>
and Cys7.<br>

for proinsulin- or insulin-sensitized CD4'1 T-cells wherein the ?TM is the formulation of a<br>
disulfide bond between Cys6 and Cys7. Tho present invention extends lo trie introduction<br>
of non-naturallv occurring amino acid residues to facilitate the same conformational<br>
constraints imposed by ihe disulOde bond between Cys6 and Cys7. Alternatively, the use<br>
of non-naturally occurring amino acids can be used to stabilize the peptide for use in in<br>
vitro or in vivo diagnostic or therapeutic testing.<br>
An "analog" is generally a chemical analog and include, but are not limited to,<br>
modification lo side chains, incorporation of unnatural .amino acids and/or their derivatives<br>
during peptick. polypeptide or protein synthesis and the use of crosslinkcrs and other<br>
methods which impose conformational constraints on the peptides.<br>
Examples of side chain modifications contemplated by the present invention include<br>
modifications of amino groups such as by reductive alkylation by reaction with an<br>
aldehyde followed by reduction with NaBHU; amidination with methylacetimidate;<br>
acylation with acetic anhydride; carbamoylation of amino groups with cyanate;<br>
trinitrobenzylation of amino groups with ,2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulphonk.acid (TNBS);<br>
acylation of amino groups with.succinic anhydride and-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride;-and<br>
pyridoxylation of lysine with pyridoxal-5-phosphate followed by reduction with NaBH^,<br>
The guanidine group of arginine residues, may be modified by the formation of<br>
heterocyclic condensation products with reagents such as 2,3-butanedione, phenylglyoxal<br>
a n d glyoxal<br>
The carboxyl group may be modified by carbodiimide activation via O-acylisourea<br>
formation followed by subsequent derivitization, lor example, to a corresponding amide.<br>
Suiphydryl groups may be modified by methods such as cafboxymethylation with<br>
iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide; performic acid oxidation to cysteic acid: formation of a<br>
mixed disulphides with other thiol compounds; reaction with maleimide, maleic anhydride<br>
or other substituted malcimide; formation of mercurial derivatives using 4-<br>
chlnromercuntienzoatc. chloronierciiripbcnylsulphpnic acid, phenylmercury chloride, 2-<br>
chloronjereuri-l-nilropheno) anil other mercurials; carbauioylation with cyanalc at alkaline<br>
pll.<br>
Tryptophan residues may be modified by, for example, oxidation with Nbromosr.<br>
ecinhiride or ulkylation of the indole ring with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide<br>
or sulphenyl halides. Tyrosine residues on the other hand, may be altered by nitration with<br>
iciranitromethane to form a 3-nitrotyrosine derivative.<br>
Modification of the imidazole ring of a histidine residue may be accornplisbed by<br>
alkylation -with iodoacetic acid derivatives or N-carbethoxj'lation with<br>
diethy Ipyrocarbonate.<br>
Examples of incorporating unnatural amino acids and derivatives during peptide synthesis<br>
include, but are not limited to, use of norleucine, 4-arnino butyric acid, 4-amino-3-<br>
hydroxy-5-phenylpentanoic acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, t-butylglycine. non'ailine,<br>
phenylglycine, ornithine, sarcosine, 4-amino-3-hydrbxy-6-methylheptanoic acid, 2-thienyl<br>
alanine and/or D-isomers o"f amino acids. A list of "onnabiral 'amino "acid, "contemplated<br>
herein is shown in<br>
(Table Removed)osslinkers can be used, for example, to stabilize 3D conformations, using homobifunctional<br>
crosslinkers such as the bifunctional:irriido'esters having (CHz)n spacer groups<br>
with n=l to n=6, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimidc esters and hetero-bifunctional<br>
reagents which usually contain an amino-reactive moiety such as? N-hydroxysuccinimide<br>
and another group specific-reactive moiety sueh as maleirhido or dithio moiety (SI-I) or<br>
carbodiimide (COOH). In addition, peptides can bc conforniationally constrained by, for<br>
example, incorporation of Ca and "N 0-raethylamrnp acids, introduction of double bonds<br>
between Ca and Cp atoms of amino acids and the formation of cyclic peptides or analogues<br>
by introducing covalent bonds such as forming an amide bond between the N and C<br>
termini, between two side chains or between a side chain and the N or C terminus.<br>
The present invention further contemplates chemical analogs of the subject polypeptide<br>
capable of acting as antagonists or agonists of the T-cell epitope peptide or other TCRA.<br>
Chemical analogs may not necessarEy be derived from the instant peptide molecules but<br>
may share certain conformational similarities. Alternatively, chemical analogs may be<br>
specifically designed 10 mimic certain physiochcinical properties of the subject peptide Tce-<br>
11 cpitopi1. Chemical analogs may be chemically synthesized or may be delected<br>
following, for example, natural product screening or screening of chemical libraries. The<br>
latter refers to molecules identified from various environmental sources such a river beds.<br>
coral, plants, microorganisms and insects.<br>
These types of modifications raaj be important to stabilize the subject TCRAs if<br>
administered to an individual or for use as a diagnostic reagent.<br>
Other derivatives contemplated by the present invention include a range of PTMs such as<br>
glycosylation and sulfide bond changes.<br>
The designing of mimetics to a TCRA is a known approach to Ihe development of<br>
Pharmaceuticals based on a "lead" compound such as the:peptide defined by SEQ ID<br>
NO.26. This might be desirable where the .active peptide .compound is difficult or<br>
expensive to synthesize or where it is unsuitable for. a particular, method of administration,<br>
e.g. peptides are generally unsuitable active agents'for oral compositions as they tendlohe<br>
quickly degraded by proteases in the alimentary canal. Mimetic design, synthesis and<br>
testing is 'generally -used -to avoid -randomly-screening large -numbers -of-molecules_for_atarget<br>
property.<br>
There are several steps commonly taken in the design of a mimetic from a compound<br>
having a given target property. First, the particular, .parts of the compound that are critical<br>
and/or important in determining the target property are determined. In the case of a<br>
peptide, this can be done by systematically varying the amino acid residues in the peptide,<br>
e.g. by substituting each residue in turn. Alanine scans of peptides are commonly used to<br>
refine such peptide motifs. These parts or residues constituting the active region of the<br>
compound are known as its "pharmacophore".<br>
Once the pharmacophore has been found, .its structure is modeled according lo its physical<br>
properties, e.g. stereochemistry bonding, size and/or charge, using data from a range of<br>
'scurces. c.ii. spectroscopic techniques, x-ray diffraction data and !\VIR. Computational<br>
analysis, similarity mapping i which models the charge and/or volume of a phurmacophore,<br>
ralher than Ihf bonding hchvcen atoms) and oilier techniques can be used in this modeling<br>
process.<br>
In :i variani of this approach, the three-dimensional structure of the MHC class II molecule<br>
or the pcptidc is determined. This can be especially useful where the MIC molecule<br>
and/or peptidee change conformation on binding, allowing the model to take account of<br>
this hi the design of the mimetic. Modeling can be used to generate inhibitors which<br>
interact with the linear sequence or a three-dimensional configuration.<br>
A template molecule is then selected onto which chemical groups which mimic the<br>
pharmacophore can be grafted. The template molecule and the chemical groups .grafted<br>
onto it can conveniently be selected so that the mimetic is easy to synthesize, is likely to be<br>
pharmacologically acceptable, and does not degrade in vivo, while retaining the biological<br>
activity of the lead compound. Alternatively, the stability can be achieved by cyclizing the<br>
peptidee, increasing its rigidity. The mimetic or mimctics found by this approach can then<br>
be screened to see whether they have the target property, or to what extent they exhibit it.<br>
Further optimization or modification can then-be carried-out-to arrive at -one-or more final<br>
mimetics for in vivo or clinical testing<br>
The goal of rational drug design is to produce structural analogs of biologically active<br>
polypeptides of interest or of small molecules with which they interact {e.g. agonists,<br>
antagonists, inhibitors or enhancers) in order to fashion drugs which are, for example,<br>
more active or stable forms of the polypeptide, or-which, e.g. enhance or interfere with the<br>
function of a polypeptide in vivo. Sec, e.g. Hodgson (BioTechnolog)' 9: 19-21..1991). In<br>
one approach, one first determines the three-dimensional structure of a protein of interest<br>
by x-ray crystallography, by computer modeling or most typically, by a combination of<br>
approaches. Useful information .regarding the structure of a polypeptide may also be<br>
gained by modeling based on the structure of homologous proteins. An example of rational<br>
drug design is the development of HIV protease inhibitors (Erickson et a!., Science 249:<br>
527-5?". 1990). In addition, target molecule.- may be analyzed by an alanine scan (Wells,<br>
Metliods Enzyniol. 202: 2699-270.. 1991). In this technique, an ;imino acid residue is<br>
replaced by Ala and itF effect on-ihe pcptide's activity is determined. Bach of the amino<br>
acid residues ol' the pcplide is analyzed in this manner to determine the important regions<br>
oftlic peptide.<br>
It is also possible to isolate a peplide-speeific antibody, selected by a functional assay and<br>
then to solve its crysul strueture. In principle, this approach yields a pharmacore upon<br>
which subsequent drug design can be based. It'is possible to bypass protein crystallography<br>
altogether by generating anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-ids) to a functional,<br>
pharmacologically active antibody. As a mirror image of a mirror image, the binding site<br>
of the anti-ids would he expected to be an analog of the original receptor. The anti-id could<br>
then, be used to identify and isolate peptides from banks of chemically or biologically<br>
produced bunks of peptides. Selected peptides would then act as the pharmacore.<br>
Two-hybrid screening is also useful in .identifying.other members of a biochemical or<br>
genetic pathway associated with a target. Two-hybrid screening conveniently uses<br>
Saccliaromyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pombe. Target interactions and screens for<br>
iiflubitors can~be carried out using the yeasfrwo-hyfarid system, -which-takes advantage-oftranscriptional<br>
factors that are composed of two physically, separable, functional domains.<br>
The most commonly used is the yeast GAL4 transcriptional activator consisting of a DNA<br>
binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. Two different cloning vectors are<br>
used to generate separate fusions iof the GAL4 domains to genes encoding potential<br>
binding proteins. The fusion proteins are co-expressed, targeted to the nucleus and if<br>
interactions occur, activation of a reporter gene (e.g. lacZ) produces a detectable<br>
phenotype. In the present case, for example, S. .cerevisiae is co-transformed with a library<br>
or vector expressing a cDNA GAL4 activation domain fusion and a vector expressing a<br>
holocyclot5dn-GAL4 binding domain fusion. If lacZ is used as the reporter gene, coexpression<br>
of the fusion proteins will produce a blue color. Small molecules or other<br>
candidate compounds which interact with a target will result in loss of colour of the cells.<br>
Reference may be made to the yeast two-hybrid systems as disclosed by Munder el al.<br>
.W/c.-iifr/n/. Biotechw'l. ?2: HI 1-320. 1999) and Young et a! (Nat. tiiotechnol. 16:<br>
y4d-950. 1998). Molecules Ihus identified by this system are then rc-tesied in animal cells.<br>
Another technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds<br>
having suitable binding affinity to a target and is described in detail in Geysen<br>
(International Patent Publication No. "WO 84/03564). Briefly stated, large numbers of<br>
different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, such as plastic<br>
pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds arc reacted with a target and<br>
washed. Bound target molecule is then detected by methods well known in the art. This<br>
method may be adapted for screening for non-peptidc. chemical entities. This aspect,<br>
therefore, extends to combinatorial approaches to screening for target antagonists or<br>
agonists.<br>
Purified target can be coated directly onto plates!for use in the aforementioned drag<br>
screening techniques. However, non-neutralizing antibodies to the target may also be used<br>
to immobilize the target on the solid phase.<br>
The present invention also contemplates the use .of competitive drug screening assays in<br>
whiclrneutralizmg-antibodies capable-of-specifically^binding the^arget-eompete-with-a-testi<br>
compound for binding to the target or fragments thereof. In this manner, the antibodies can<br>
be used to detect the presence of any peptide which shares one or more antigenic<br>
determinants of the target.<br>
As stated above TCRAs have a range of diagnostic and therapeutic utilities.<br>
Any number of methods may be employed to detect T-cells sensitized to the subject T-cell<br>
epitopc. Immunological testing is one paitficularnnethod screening for T-cells 'restricted'<br>
by particular MHC class n molecules. Acqprdingly,, the present invention extends to<br>
antibodies and other immunological agents directed to or preferably specific for the T-cell<br>
epitope or the disulfide bond or its binding MHC class H molecule. The antibodies may be<br>
monoclonal or polyclonal or may comprise Fab fragments or synthetic forms.<br>
Specific antibodies can be used to screen for the subject T-ocll epitope and its fragments.<br>
Techniques for the assays contemplated herein arc known in the art and include, for<br>
example, sandwich assays a n d EL1SA. It is within the scope of this invention to include any second antibodies (monoclonal.<br>
polyclonal or fragments of antibodies or synthetic antibodies) directed to the first<br>
mentioned antibodies referred to above. Both the first and second antibodies may be used<br>
in detection assays or a first antibody may be used with a commercially available antiimmunoglobulin<br>
antibody. An antibody as contemplated herein includes any antibody<br>
specific ip any region of the peptide at or near the T-cell epitope.<br>
Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are obtainable by immunization with the<br>
subject peptide or larger forms such as an A-chain or a complex between an MHC class II<br>
molecule and the peptide and either type is utjlizable for imrnunoassays. The methods of<br>
obtaining both types of antibodies.are well known in the art. Polyclonal sern are less<br>
preferred but are relatively easily prepared by injection of a suitable laboratory animal with<br>
an effective amount of subject polypeptide, or antigenic parts thereof, collecting serum<br>
from the 'animal and isolating specific sera .by-any of the -known immunoadsorbent<br>
techniques. Although antibodies produced by this method are utilizable in virtually any<br>
type of immunoassay, they arc generally less favoured because of the potential<br>
heterogeneity of the product.<br>
The presence of the instant T-cell epitope may be detected in a number of ways such as by<br>
Western blotting and ELISA procedures. A wide range of immunoassay techniques are<br>
available as can be seen by reference to U.S. Patent Nos. 4,016,043, 4,424,279 and<br>
4,018,653The T-cell epitope of the present invention iand its neoepitope has a range of uses in<br>
therapy.<br>
For example, the 1'CKA may he used in therapy to induce immunological tolerance. This<br>
may be -achieved in various ways including administering the pcptide by a lulerogenic<br>
route (eg vin rnucosHej.or in .a tolerogenic form (eg via immature dendritic colls), exposing<br>
the thyimiK to the peptide, using Ihe pepvidc to induce deletional tolerance such as by<br>
stimulating apoptosis in T-cells or by linking a eytotbxic moiety to- the peptide or to induce<br>
T-cell anergy. The TGRA may also be used to generate antibodies or other<br>
immunoteractivc molecules specific lo the TCRA.<br>
Accordingly, another aspect of ihc present invention contemplates a method for preventing<br>
or reducing the risk of onset of T1D in a subject said method comprising introducing into<br>
said subject a T-cell tolerance-inducing effective amount of a peptide .having the<br>
characteristics of:<br>
(i) comprising a pepTlDe backbone of at least, 10 amino acids having an amino acid<br>
sequence substantially homologous to an amino acidiseauence of the A-chain of proinsulin<br>
o r insulin<br>
(ii) wherein the amino acid sequence, of the, peppClDe comprises at least two adjacent<br>
cysteiiic residues of\vhich~atleast •one-corresponds'to"Gys6-or-eys7-in-human-proinsulin-erinsulin<br>
A-chain or a non-human mammalian; equivalent thereof;<br>
(iii) when functioning as a T-cell epitope for proinsulin- or insulinrsensitized CD Tcells,<br>
the two adjacent cysteine residues .participate in disulfide bond formulation between<br>
each cnher; .<br>
or a homolog, analog, orthobg, mutant or derivative of said peptide.<br>
hi an alternative method, the peptide is used to induce. selective depletion of proinsulin- or<br>
insulin-sensitized CD4+ T-cells. In this regard, the T-cell epitope peptide or other TCRA<br>
of the present invention and its neoepitopic form is fused or otherwise associated with a<br>
cytotoxic molecule including an apoptptic molecule or radioactive isotope.<br>
In siill  further alternative, catalytic antibodies"£ire generated which specifically target the<br>
disulfiUc- bond. In this regard, although not-wishing to limit the invention to any one<br>
hypothesis, it is conceivable that the disulfide bond formed between two adjacent existing<br>
rcsidiics results in .1 formation of substantial bend in the protein backbone. The omega<br>
torsion angle for such a bend may range from 180 degrees to negative 130 degrees. The<br>
result of this bending of the peptide backbone,is the possibility of generating an antibody<br>
such as a catalytic antibody which is specific for that conformation.<br>
Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a peptide:<br>
(i) comprising a peptide backbone of at least. -10 amino acids having an amino acid<br>
sequence substantially homologous to an amino.acid sequence of the A-chain of proinsulin<br>
or insulin;<br>
(ii) wherein the amino acid sequence qf the peptide comprises at least two adjacent<br>
cysteine residues of which at least one corresponds; to Cys6 or Cys7 in human proinsulin or<br>
insulin A-chain or a non-human mammalian equivalent thereof:<br>
(iii) when functioning as a T-cell epitope .for prpinsulin- or insulin-sensitized 004* Ttvlls,<br>
the two adjacent cysteine residues participate in disulfide bond formulation between<br>
each other:<br>
or a homolog, analog, ortholog, mutant or derivative of said peptide;<br>
wherein said peptide is fused or otherwise bound:,onassociated with a cytotoxic.moiety.<br>
Such a peptide is referred to herein as a cytptoxic TVcell targeting agent but is also<br>

The present invention further contemplates •&amp; inethod \for diagnosing and/or preventing<br>
immune T-cell -responses -that could attack "transplanted "(pro")insu1in-pf6ducii;(g cells "or"<br>

In another aspect, the present invention, contemplates MHC class II molecules are loaded<br>
with peptides comprising the subject T-cell epitope. The.peptides,ate typically .loaded into<br>
the binding groove formed by the Talpha und tbeta.l .domains and bind to the MHC class n<br>
molecules through non-covalent interactions. The peptides can be from about 9 to 10 lo<br>
about 20 amino acids, or more, in length. The peptides of the present invention are conveniently synthetically produced but the<br>
sequence is derived from proinsulin or insulin.<br>
The peptides can be prepared in a variety of, ways. For example, peptides can be<br>
synthcsi/cd using an automated pcptide synthesiser. The peptides can aiso DC<br>
synthesized (HauuUapiller c; ul. Nature 370:105-11. 1984, Siewarl and Young. Solid Phase<br>

Methoclun ckr organisi-'hen Chemie. Vol. IS/! and i'5'2, Bodanszky, Principles vf Pepticle<br>
Synthesis. Springer Ve.rlag 1984), alternatively, peptides can be synthesized by proteolytic<br>
cleavage (e.g. by trypsin, chymotrypsin. papain, VS protease, and the like) or. specific<br>
chemical cleavage (e.g. cyanogen bromide). The peptides can also be synthesized by<br>
expression of overlapping nucleic acid sequences in vivo or in vitro, each nucleic acid<br>
sequence encoding a particular peptide.<br>
The peptides optionally can be isolated and purified prior to contacting with the MI1C<br>
class II molecules. Suitable methods include, for example, chromatography (e.g. ion<br>
exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, sizing column chromatography. high<br>
pressure liquid chromatography. and the like), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by<br>
any other suitable technique for the purification of peptides or proteins. In certain<br>
embodiments, thejpeptides can be labeled (e.g.-with-a radioactive label, a luminescent label,<br>
an affinity tag, and the like) to facilitate purification of the peptides (infra).<br>
The peptides are "typically 'not CToss'linked rtp the-MHC class II molecules. ~In-.jQthet--<br>
embodiments, the peptides optionally ,can be cross-linked to the binding groove of the<br>
MHC class II molecules. For example, bi-functional crosslinking reagents (e.g. heterobifunctional,<br>
homo-bifunctional. etc.) can be used to covalentiy link the peptides to the<br>
MHC class II moelcules (Kunkel et al., Mol. Cell. Biochem. 34:3, 1981). Suitable<br>
crosslinking reagents include, for example, dimethylsuberimidate, glutaraldehyde,<br>
succinimidyloxycarbonyl-.alpha.-methyl-.alpha,(2-pyridyldithio)-toluene (SMTP). Nsuccinimidyl<br>
3-(2-pyridyldithio_-propionate (SPDP), sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(Nmaleimidomethyl)<br>

'DTSSP,) and the; liui- (Pierce Chemical Co. Pierce Immvno Technology Catalog ; ul<br>
Handbonk. 1990). In one embodiment, one or more anchor residues of a peptide can be<br>
cross-linked to the MHC class II molecule. In other embodiments, any suitable residue(s)<br>
of a pcpu'de can be cross-linked to the MHC class ,11 molecule.<br>
Alternatively, the pepiideb can be prepared as fusion proteins with a soluble MHC class<br>
Il.beui. subunii. For example, nucleic acids encoding a peptide, or a mixture of peptides,<br>
can be expressed as a fusion protein comprising a peptide. spacer or linker region (e.g 10<br>
to 20 amino acid linker), a soluble MHC class II subunit, and a ligand binding domain.<br>
The peptide can be linked for example, to the amino terminal end of the MHC class Il.beta.<br>
subunit. In one embodiment the fusion protein is expressed from an expression cassette.<br>
The expression cassette can included, for example, a promoter operably associated with,<br>
and in a 5' to 3' direction relative to the direction of transcription,, a nucleic acid encoding a<br>
polylinker cloning region, a nucleic acid encoding a spacer region, and a nucleic acid<br>
encoding an MHC class Il.beta. subunit. The expression cassette can be expressed in any<br>
suitable host organism and can be part of aa expression vector. In another embodiment,<br>
pools of MHC-classII/peptide fusion protein pairs.<w by .inserting degenerate></w>
semi-degenerate or non-degenerate nucleic acids into the polylinker region of an<br>
expression cassette, such as those described above. Alternatively, nucleic acids encoding a<br>
single peptide can be inserted into the polylinker region.<br>
The MHC class II molecules and peptides can be formed into multimeric MHC class II<br>
complexes. As used herein, forming multimeric MHC class Il/peptide complexes can<br>
include forming multimeric MHC class II/peptide complexes from MHC class II<br>
molecule/peptide pairs and/or forming multimeric 'MHC class II molecules from MHC<br>
class II molecules, which can be loaded with peptides.<br>
The multimeric complexes can comprise two, three, four, or more MHC class II/peptide<br>
complexes. Such complexes can be formed by interaction between a ligand on the MHC<br>
class 11 molecules anJ a polyvalent binding partner. As used herein, ihe phrase "ligandlitiand<br>
binding partner pair" refers to a ligand and its liganc1 binding partner that arc<br>
capnble of re. ognizing and binding in each other. The term "polyvalent" refers to a ligand<br>
binding partner that has at Icasi two binding sites, typically three or four, ligand binding<br>
sites. The lig;md(s) and bindiiu' partner can be any moieties that are capable of<br>
rccongin/ing and binding to each other to form a mullinicric complex. Additionally, the<br>
ligand and binding partner can interact via the binding of a third intermediary substance.<br>
Typically, the ligand and ligand binding partner constituting the ligand-binding partner<br>
pair are binding molecules that undergo a specific noncovalent interaction wife each other.<br>
The ligand ant! ligand binding partner can be naturally occurring or artificially produced,<br>
and optionally can be aggregated with other species of molecules.<br>
The binding partner can be free in solution or can be attached to a solid support. Examples<br>
of suitable solid supports include beads (e.g. .magnetic b.eads), membranes, mcirotitcr<br>
plates, and the like. The support can be glass, plastic (e.e. polystrene), polysaccharide,<br>
nylon, nitrocellulose. PVDF. and the like. The use of a binding partner linked to a solid<br>
support can be useful for immobilization, and/or isolation of T-cells (e.g. such as from a<br>
population of PBMC) that recognize the multimeric MHC class II molecule and the bound<br>
peptideIn an exemplary embodiment, one of the MHC. class II submits includes a modification<br>
sile (e.g. a BirA recognition sequence); BirA catalyzes biotinylation of the protein<br>
substrate. The biotinylated MHC class II moleculeis then bound to a polyvalent binding<br>
partner (e.g. streptavidin or avidin), to which biotin binds .with extremely high affinity.<br>
The multimers can then be stored until needed.<br>
The MHC class II molecules typically are loaded with peptide by incubation at<br>
37.degree.C. in a phosphate buffer at slightly acidic pH (.e.g lOOmM sodium phosphate,<br>
pH 6.0) in the presence of 0.2% n-octyl-D-glucopyranoisde (OG). A protease inhibitor is<br>
optionally added to the mixture. Suitable peptide loading times range from about 48 to<br>
about 72 hours, although greater and lesser .times are within the scope of the present<br>
invention. Suitable peptide: NJHC. class molecule molar ratios are in excess of !0:1,<br>
although L-roatcr and lesser ratios are within the scope of the present invention. Other<br>
liiiflVrs ;i:,.l pITs can be useJ. us will be appreciaiccl by the skilled artisan.<br>
In certain embodiments, the multimeric MHC class H/peptide complexes :••..,: labeled. As<br>
used herein, the terms "label" or "labeled" refer to n molecule or groups of molecules<br>
which can provide a detectable signal when the label is incorporated into, or attached to, a<br>
polypeptide, such as a MHC class II molecule or a polyvalent binding partner. For<br>
example, a polypeptide or a polyvalent binding partner can be labeled with a radioactive<br>
molecule, a luminescent molecule,;: fluorescent molecule, a chemi-luminesccnl molecule,<br>
an enzyme, or by biotinyl moieties. Methods of labeling polypeptides and binding partners<br>
are well known in the art. Examples of detectable labels include, but are not limited to, the<br>
following: radioisotopes (e.g. 3H, 14C., 32P, 35s, I25I, !3II, and the like), fluorescent<br>
molecules (e.g. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), rhodamine, phycoerythrin (PK),<br>
phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, ortho-phthaldehyde, fluorescamine, peridinin-chlorophyll a<br>
fPerCP), Cy3 (indocarbocyanine), Cy5 (mdDdiacarbocyanine), lanthanide phosphors, and<br>
the like), enzymes (e.g. horseradish peroxidase, .beta.-galactosidase, lucifcrase, alkaline<br>
phosphatase). biotinyl groups, and the like. In. some embodiments, detectable labels are<br>
attached-by spacerarms-of various -lengths to reduce; potential steric hindrance.<br>
In specific embodiments, the binding partner can be labeled. For example, a biotinylatcd<br>
MHC class II molecule can be detected with .labeled avidin or streptavidin (e.g streptavidin<br>
containing a fluorescent molecule or a colored molecule produced by enzymatic activity<br>
that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods). Alternatively, the MHC ckss JI<br>
molecule can be detected, for example, with a labeled antibody or other binding agent that<br>
will bind specifically bind to the multimeric MHC class II complex. Suitable labels<br>
include any of those described above or known toithe skilled artisan.<br>
In another aspect, the multimeric MHC class D/peptide complexes are contacted with Tcells<br>
to determine whether the complexes bind the T-cells in an epitope-specific manner.<br>
In certain embodiments, the multimeric 'MHC class Il/peptide complexes can be used to<br>
stain or deloaabh Libel the "J -cells. Abused'herein, "stain" refers to the ability of the<br>
multimeric Ml 1C class ll/'pcptide complexes to detecUihly label T-cells that can hind the<br>
complexes ii; .in fpitope-specifk manner.<br>
Human 1 cells can be isoiatul from fresh samples from a human subject, from an in vitro<br>
culture of cells from a human subject, from a frozen sample of cells, and the like. Suitable<br>
samples can include, for example, blood, lymph, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, kidney,<br>
pancreas, lonsil. thyrnus. joints, synovia, and other tissues from which T-cells can be<br>
isolated. Typically, the T-cells are isolated ,as..peripheral blood mononuclear cells<br>
(PBMO. PBMC can be partially purified,.for example, by ccntrifugation (e.g from a buffy<br>
coat), by density gradient centrifugation (e.g. through-a Ficoll-Hypaque), by panning,<br>
affinity separation, cell sorting (e.g. using antibodies specific for one or more cell surface<br>
markers) mid other techniques that provide enrichment of PBMC and/or Ttcells.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, PBMC are isolated from a blood sample by standard<br>
Ficoll-Hypaque method. The blood .sample is treated with heparin and underlain with :a__<br>
Ficoll solution. Following centrifugation, the recovered cells can be washed, for example,<br>
in PBS or T-cell culture medium (e.g. RPM1 1640 supplemented with 2mL L-glutamine,<br>
100.-mu:g/ml -penicillin/streptomycin, ImM sodium pyruvate and 15% pooled human"<br>
serum; A1M-V; and the like). The washed cells can be resuspendcd in T-cell culture<br>
medium, and the like. .<br>
The multimeric class Il/peptide complexes can be contacted with the T-cells to identify one<br>
or more MHC class II epitopes of a predetennmed antigen. The epitopes can be<br>
determined according to the specificity of the .alpha, and .beta, subunits comprising the<br>
MHC class II molecules. ,,<br>
Generally, the multimeric class Il/peptide complexes are contacted with a sample of Tcells<br>
of interest. In some embodiments, the T-cells are cultured for between about 1 to 10<br>
days, or more, in T-cell culture media in the presence of the predetermined antigen to<br>
stimulate proliferation of T-cells that are specific for that antigen. The media optionally<br>
can be supplemented other components-Tor the culture and.'or viability of T-cells (e,g.<br>
serum, antibiotics, cyiokines. co-stimulatory receptor agonists, and the like). In other<br>
embodiments, the T-cells are contacled with the multimerie class H/peptide complexes<br>
\vithoul antigen stimulation amU'r culturing (e.g. for patient monitoring).<br>
The T-cells are contacled with the multimeric MHC class II/peptide pools under suitable<br>
binding conditions. In one embodiment, the binding conditions are 37.degree.C. in any<br>
suitable T-cell culture media (c,g. ,RPMI 1640 or .A1M-V). phosphate buffered saline,<br>
Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, Iscove's<br>
medium, and the like. The media can be supplemented with other components for the<br>
culture and/or viability of T-cells (e.g. serum, antibiotics, cytokines. and the like). The<br>
multimeric complexes are typically contacted with the T-cells for at least about 5 minutes<br>
and typically within the range of about. 1 to 2 hours. The appropriate concentration of.<br>
multimeric complexes can be determined by titration.<br>
The amount ofmurtimeric complex bound to the T-cells is determined. For example, if the<br>
T-cells are substantially homogenous, then the amount of labeled multimeric.<br>
Still another-aspect -of -the present invention provides a -method -for-inducing tolerance -oranergy.<br>
This may be achieved in a number of ways including providing MHC class II/Tcell<br>
epitope complexes, introduction of the T-cell epitopes into the thymus, providing suboptimal<br>
levels of the T-cell epitope and providing antagonists of T-cell eptiope-TGR<br>
interaction. Examples of suitable antagonists .are antibodies or recombinant forms or<br>
chimcric forms or derivatives thereof. ;.<br>
The T-cell epitope peptides or their homologs, analogs, ortholpgs, mutants and derivatives<br>
(i.e. the TCRAs) pr antibodies, MHC class II complexes or T-cell receptor-TCR antagonist<br>
(also referred to herein as "active compounds") used in the methods of the invention can be<br>
incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject, e.g.<br>
a human. Such compositions typically also comprise a phannaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. As used herein the language "phannaceutically acceptable carrier" is intended to<br>
include am and all solvents, dispersion medin. coating, antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, isotonic ;ind absorption delaying ayents. and the like, compatible \vitii<br>
pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmnciiutically<br>
active substances is well known in the an. Except insofar as any conventional media or<br>
agent is incompatible with (he active compound, such media can be useci in the<br>
compositions of the invention. Supplementary active compounds can also b incorporated<br>
into the compositions.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its<br>
intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenternl,<br>
e.g. intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e,g. inhalation), transdermal (topical),<br>
transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solution or suspensions used for parenteral,<br>
intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile<br>
diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols,<br>
glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl<br>
alcohol or methyl paprabens; antioxidants.such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite;<br>
chelating agents such as ethylenedianuneletraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates<br>
or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride 01<br>
dextrose. ipH can be adjusted with acids or -bases, such as-hydrochloric acid .or sodium..<br>
hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or<br>
multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions<br>
(where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous<br>
preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration,<br>
suitable carriers include physiological. saline, bacteriostatis water, Cremophor EL.TM.<br>
(BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate .buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the<br>
composition must be sterile and should be fhiid to the extent that easy syringeability exists.<br>
It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved<br>
against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier<br>
can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for<br>
cxampk. glyr..-ivl, propylene glycoK and liquid po'yetheylene giycol. and the like), and<br>
suitable mixtures thcrcul'. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use<br>
of :i coating M.ic:h as lecithin, by (he maintenance of the required panicle size in the case of<br>
dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of mciroorganisrns can<br>
be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabcns,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be<br>
preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, poly-alcohols such as manitol.<br>
sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectahle<br>
compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an apent which delays<br>
absorption, for example, aluminium monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g. a<br>
small molecule, nucleic acid molecule, or peptide) in the required amount in an appropriate<br>
solveni with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed<br>
by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are .prepared by incorporating the active<br>
compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required<br>
other ingredients from those enumerated .above. In the case of sterile powders for the<br>
preparation of sterile injectable. solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum<br>
drying and freeze-drying which-yields a powder, of the active-ingredient plus any .additional<br>
desired ingredient from a previously sterilerfiltered solution thereof.<br>
Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be<br>
enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic<br>
administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the<br>
form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid<br>
carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orallj<br>
and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents<br>
and. or adjuvant materials can be included as part,of the .composition. The tablets, pills<br>
capsules, troches and the like can contain any of ihe following ingredients, or compounds<br>
of a similar nature: a binder such as mierpcystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelat4in;<br>
an excipient such as starch or lactose, a distingegrating agent as alginic acid, Primogel, or<br>
.•urn stare;, a lubricant such as mayneMuni stearate or Sterotes; a ^Want such as colloidal<br>
silicon .'inside; a sweetening agenl such a* sucrose or saccharin; or a flav .ring agent such<br>
as peppermint, methyl salicylaic. or orange flavoring.<br>
For administrating by inhalation., the compounds arc delivered in the form of an aerosol<br>
spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant. e.g. a gas<br>
such us cai ivw dioxide, or a neubulizer.<br>
Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For<br>
transmucosal or Iransdennal administration, penetrants appropriate, to the barrier to be<br>
permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are general! y known in thwart, and<br>
include, for exampk. for Iransmucosul administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic<br>
acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of<br>
nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are<br>
formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.<br>
The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositiories (;e.g with conventional<br>
suppository bases such as cocoa buttCTvand other, glycerides) or retention enemas-for rectal<br>
delivery: - ••-•-• ,.,;.'-'-....:;.r,,,-.....„...i.:.:_._ _ _..<br>
In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the<br>
compound against rapid elimination from .the body, such as a .controlled release<br>
formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery .systems. Biodegradable,<br>
biocompatable polymers can be used, such, as ethylene vinyl acetate, pblyanhdrides,<br>
polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, .and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation<br>
of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be<br>
obtained commercially from Alza iL orporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal<br>
suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to<br>
viral antigens) can Also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be<br>
prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described<br>

EXAMPLE 7<br>
identification ofproinsutin A-chain epitope<br>
Fifteen proinsulin-specific CD4" T-cell clones were isolated from the peripheral blood of a<br>
donor with established T1D3 as described in Example 1. The epitope was mapped against<br>
an overlapping panel of 15-mer peptides, each shifted .by three amino acids. First, the<br>
clones were eachjncubated with 8 pools of peptides, each comprising 3-4 peptides. Five of<br>
15 clones recognized a peptide witliin pool 8 (Figure'2A). The remaining clones failed to<br>
respond to any peptide. Second^ when the three peptides in pool 8 were tested separately, a<br>
peptide comprising the last two amino acids of the C-peptide (underlined) and the first 13<br>
amino acids of the A-chain oTinsulin (^GflVEQeCTSieSL-; -SEQiD-N0:23-)-strrrralated<br>
the clones as well as pool 8 or recombinant proinsulin (Figure 2B). The epitope is within<br>
the A-chain of insulin as clinical grade insulin was able to stimulate the clones. The<br>
epitope was confirmed to be witliin the first 12 amino acids of the A-chain of insulin using<br>
a panel of peptides. Finally, the response to insulin was due to antigen-specific recognition<br>
since it was blocked by anti-HLA DR specific mAb (Figure 2C).<br>
EXAMPLE*<br>
T-cell clones to the A-chain epilope recognize native insulin<br>
To confirm thai the T-cell clones recognize an epitope derived from native human insulin,<br>
their capacity to proliferate in response ID a human islet lysalc was tested. The results from<br>
two clones are shown (Figure '\A). Both proliferated in response to islet lysate, but not to<br>
spleen lysate from the same donor. Further experiments (Figure 3B) showed that this<br>
response was blocked hy antibodies specific for HLA DR. but not for HLA DQ.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
TheA-cliain epitope is presented by HLA DRBJ*0401, 0404, 0405<br>
The HLA type of the donor is shown in Table 5. The HLA molecule(s) that present(s)4the<br>
epitope to the clones was determined in two steps. First, blocking with HLA-isotypespecific<br>
antibodies showed that proliferation of all clones was prevented by anti HLA-DR<br>
specific mAb (L243), but not by HLA DQ ;(SP¥-L3)- or HLA DP (B7/21)-specific<br>
antibodies (Figure 4A). Second, HLA restriction was confirmed using the panel of B*cell<br>
lines transfected with HLA pdiain genes (Figure 4B). Cells transfected with DRB 1*0401<br>
(DR4), DRB 1*0404 (DR4) or DRB1*0405 (DR4) were all able to present peptide,<br>
whereas cells transfected with DRB4*0101 (DR52), DQB1*0201 (DQ2), DQB1*0302<br>
(DQ8) were unable to present the agoniw peptide. Similar results were obtained with a<br>
panel of HLA-typed EBV-transformed B cell lines. Hence, the HLA restriction is HLA<br>
DRB1*0401,0404-05.<br>
EXAMPLE™<br>
All clones that require the. A-chain epitope use the same Va Ja and Vf5 Jf3 sequences<br>
The TCR usage of A-chain epitope-specific T-cell clones was determined (Table 8). One<br>
clone uses VgtiSll while the other '.hree use Vo:i3.-2i, The same Ja 401 is expressed by<br>
all clones. All clones use V0 7-801 and Jp.lp:l The CDR3 sequence was identical for<br>
all but clone 4.19, which had different Va,and Vp GDR3 sequences.<br>
(Table Removed)  TheA-chain epitope requires adjacent cysteines<br>
Peptides were tested in which cysteine was substituted by serine to determine the role of<br>
cysteine in creating the epitope recognized by the A-chain-specific clones. Substitution oi<br>
either of the adjacent cysteines (A-6 and A-7) with serine completely abolished the<br>
capacity of the peptide to stimulate any of. the T-cell clones (Figure 5A), at peptide<br>
concentrations of up to SOfoM. Surprisingly, substitution of the cysteine at position Al 1<br>
with serine increased the activity -of the .'peptide 100-fold. A synthetic peptide<br>
corresponding to iho sequence in mouse '.insulin 11. u'fhich has aspartic acid instead of<br>
ghiumiic ucid at position VI. was 10-fold 'loss poien1 than the human peptide (Figure 5B).<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Adjacent cysleines in the A-chain epitope form an infra-chain disulphide bond<br>
It is proposed that the epitope recognized by the T-cell clones requires PTM of the<br>
cysieines at positions A6 and A7. To investigate this, the capacity of paraibrmaldehydefixed<br>
and -unfixed APC to present the epitope (as a synthetic peptide) to the T-ccll clones<br>
was compared. Fixation did not affect the response to the peptide. Therefore, it v^as<br>
concluded that the modification occurred spontaneously in the culture medium. To define<br>
the modification more exactly, peptide with a serine for cysteine substitution at residue 13<br>
(A-11), referred to as S-13 was incubated, in culture medium and then used RP-HPLC to<br>
separate the components. The resultant fractions were tested for their capacity lo stimulate<br>
proliferation of the clones. A single fraction (#7, Figure 6A) was able to stimulate<br>
proliferation of the T-cell clones. No fractions stimulated proliferation when peptide with a<br>
serine for cysteine substitution at position A-6 was used. Analysis of the active fraction by<br>
mass spectroscopy (Figure 6B) showed that it contained a single species that was 2 Daltons<br>
i ..,<br>
smaller than the parental S-13 peptide. Which is consistent with a loss of 2 .hydrogen<br>
atoms. MS/MS analysis showed that this loss of 2 Daltons arose at the adjacent cysteine<br>
residues (Table 9). From this, it is concluded that the .cognate epitope recognized by the Tcell<br>
clones contained an intra-chain disulphide bond between the two adjacent cysteines at<br>
positions A-6 and A-7.<br>
(Table Removed)Recognition of fin1 -l-chniu upitope is blocked.-by reduction :of disulphide bonds<br>
To confirm thai an intrachain disulphidc bond is required for .stimulation of the T-ccll<br>
clones, the affect of the disulphide reducing ageiv, Tris (2-earboxyethyl) phosphine<br>
hydrochliride (TCEP) on the re spouse-of T-ccll clones to peptide S-13 was tested. With<br>
increasing concentrations of TCEP a dose-dependent inhibition of the response of the Tcell<br>
clones to peptide S-13 was observed (Figure 7). The reduction in proliferation was not<br>
due to toxicity as the responses to PFIA or IL-2 were not reduced, but rather slightly<br>
increased, by TCEPi • -<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
T-cell clones to the A-chain epitope isolated from a healthy donor with pre-clinical T1D<br>
Eleven proinsulin-specific CD4T T-cell'clones were isolated from an islet autoantibody-<br>
• positive HLA DR4+ donor at risk of developing TiD. Three of the clones proliferated in<br>
response to both proinsulin and insulin (see for example Figure 8 A). These clones<br>
recognized the S-13 peptide in association with HLA DRB 1*0404-0405 (Figure 8B). The<br>
response was targeted to the A-chain epitope with an intra-chain disulphide bond because<br>
this fraction from the RP-HLC column was the only one that stmnilatcd this clone (Figure<br>
BC). Hence, T-cell clones specific for the post-translationally modified A-chain epitope<br>
were isolated from a donor at high risk for T1D never exposed to exogenous insulin.<br>

Prevention of tiiabi-it&amp; in »N O.D mice<br>
The aim of this Example i. to investigate human 'i'-cell response to Al-13 epitope and the<br>
use of the NOD mouse model to determine the efficacy of pepiide encompassing this<br>
cpi tope for prevention of type 1 diabetes (T1D),<br>
Introduction/rationale1<br>
T-cell responses to the islet autoaniigcns proinsulin and GAD can be detected in healthy<br>
subjects (Mannering at al, Ann A",)'. Acad Set J03":l6-2l, 2004). While the epitope<br>
specificity of these responses has not been determined it is possible that certain epitopes<br>
are associated with diabetes while other epitopes are recognized by T-cells from healthy<br>
subjects.<br>
The non obese diabetic (NOD) mouse spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes and is<br>
a widely used model of human type 1 .diabetes. Intranasal delivery of insulin protein<br>
(Harrison et al, J Exp Med 755:1013-1021 ,,1996) or a proinsulin peptide spanning the B-C<br>
chain junction (Martinez el al, J Clin Invesi 111:}365-1371, 2003) has been shown to<br>
prevent diabetes in the -N0D mouse. The -intranasaJ proinsulin -B-G chain -peptide-induees<br>
regulator)', anti-diabetogenic CD4+ T-cells. To elicit a 004-0611 response a peptide must<br>
first bind to an MHC class II molecule. This mouse expresses a single MHC class II<br>
moleculeThe peptide KRGIVEQCCTSICSL (SEQ ID. N0:32), or the murine homologue<br>
KRGIVDQCCTSICSL (SEQ ID NO:33) are referred to as the Al-13.epitope, because<br>
these peptides encompass the minimum epitppe described herein (GTVEQCCTSICSL<br>
(SEQ ID NO:34), or in the mouse QJVDQCCTSICSL (SEQ ID NO:35)).<br>
Methods:<br>
Analysis of clones from healthy HLA DR4 subjects: ,CD4+ T-cell clones 1hat proliferate in<br>
response to proinsulin were isolated as described (Mannering ci al, J Imnnmol Methods<br>
?0iS:83-lJ2. 2005). TIacli clone was cultured with irradiated antigen presenting cells (A?C)<br>
and either no antigen, proinsulin (lOng/ral) 6'r AM  pcptide (KRGIVEQCGTR1CSL<br>
(SFQ TD NO:32), lOjaM). Responses to a pepiide encompassing the Al-13 epitopc were<br>
detected by incorporation oi'3H-thymidinc durinu the fimil 16 hours of culture.<br>
I-Ag7 bindingii-Atil binding was determined by competition for a biotinylated reporter<br>
peptide (bio- 1TEL10-23), known to bind l-Ag7. Proinsulin pcptides were incubated in<br>
serial dilution with a fixed concentration of bio-HEL 10-23 (For full details sec<br>
Attachment 1). High-affinity peptides inhibit binding of the reporter peptide at low<br>
concentrations (~100-500nM), whereas low or non-binding peptides inhibited at high<br>
concentrations (2.0 |iM). Cysteine residues in the proinsulin peptides used for the I-Ag7<br>
binding were substituted for alanine to avoid oxidative modifications.<br>
Peptide therapy: NOD mice were used to test the capacity of peptide encompassing the<br>
Al-13 epitope to prevent diabetes (see protocol in Attachment 2). Mice were treated by<br>
intranasal delivery of a peptide of the Joltowing,peptides (KRGIVDQCC'l SICSL (SEQ ID<br>
NO:32 or a similar peptide whe.re the cysteines were substituted by serine<br>
(KRGIVDQSSTSISSL (SEQ ID NO:33)), or a control peptide<br>
(LQTLALEVAQQKRGrVDQCC (SEQ"BD N0:315).The cyste'ihe residues at positions A6-<br>
and A7 are required for formation of a vicinal disulfide bond and recognition by human<br>
CD44" T-cell clones (as shown previously). Binding of the peptulo encompassing the Al-<br>
epitope to HLA DR4 is not affected by substituting cysteine for serine. The murine form<br>
homologue of the Al-13 peptide binds to I-Ag7, as.shown below, when cysteine has been<br>
replaced with alanine. Diabetes incidence was monitored for 240 days by testing for urine<br>
glucose each week from 100 days of age. Diabetes was confirmed by two consecutive<br>
daily blood glucose concentrations  1 ImM.<br>

Prevention ofTID in the NOD mice<br>
NOD mice were treated with peptide encompassing the Al-13 epilope, variants of the<br>
epitope, or an irrelevant peptide from proinsulin. The incidence of diabetes was monitored<br>
until the mice were 240 days old. Of the mice treated with the a peptide encompassing the<br>
A]-13 epitope (KRGIVDQCCTSICSL (SEQ ID NO:32)), one of 12 developed diabetes<br>
(8.3%), whereas four of 10 treated with a similar peptide with the cysteines replaced with<br>
serine (KRGIVDQSSTSISSL (SEQ ID NO:33)) developed diabetes (40°/i,). When mice<br>
were treated with another peptide from proinsulin (LQTLALEVAQQKRGrVBQGC (SEQ<br>
ID NO:31)) four out of 11 (36.4%) developed diabetes (Figure 10).<br>
(a) Analysis ofpruinsulin-specific T-cell clones from healthy donors<br>
This shows that clones isolated from healthy subjects, who express HLA DR4, do not<br>
respond to the Al-13 epitope. This suggests that responses to this epitope may only be<br>
found in people at risk of T1D or those who already have T1D,<br>
(b) Binding 1o I-Ag7<br>
These data show that the peptide encompassing the Al-13 epitope binds to the MHC class<br>
1J molecule, I-Ag7. Intranasal treatment with a peptide encompassing the Al-13 epitope<br>
reduced diabetes development in NOD .mice, but only if cysteines were present. This<br>
supports the role of adjacent cysteine residues at A6 and A7 forming a vicinal-disulfide<br>
bond in the formation of the epitope recognized by T-cells that mediate protection against<br>
diabetes.<br>
